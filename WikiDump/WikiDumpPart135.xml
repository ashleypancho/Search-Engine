      <text xml:space="preserve">===DIRECT===
The content of the registers must be treated as values not pointers/addresses.
====With data register Dn====
* &lt;ea&gt; = Dn
* '''Syntax''': '''Dn''' where n is 0 ... 7
* '''Details''': The operand is in a data register. The effective address '''&lt;ea&gt;''' specifies this register.
* '''Comments''': It is very common in use. Size of the operand can be byte, word or long word.
* '''Example''':
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
   move.l d1, d0 ; Source -&gt; Destination
&lt;/source &gt;
Copies the content of the register D1 to register D0. When instruction is executed both registers will contain the same information. When copying a byte or a word, the upper part of the register will remain unchanged.
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
                 ; assuming D1 = 01234567, D0 = FFFFFFFF
   move.w d1, d0 ; copies a word
                 ; D1 = 01234567, D0 = FFFF4567
   ...
                 ; assuming D1 = 01234567, D0 = FFFFFFFF
   move.b d1, d0 ; copies a byte
                 ; D1 = 01234567, D0 = FFFFFF67
&lt;/source&gt;

====With address register An====
* &lt;ea&gt; = An
* '''Syntax''': '''An''' where n is 0 ... 7
* '''Details''': The operand is in an address register. The effective address '''&lt;ea&gt;''' specifies this register.
* '''Comments''': It is very common in use. Size of the operand can be word or long word. If you have a byte value extend the value to the word. All values will be treated as signed values.
* '''Example''':
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
   move.l a1, d0
&lt;/source&gt;
Copies the whole register A1 to register D0. When instruction is executed both registers will contain the same information. When a word operand is transferred to an address register, the bit 15 of the operand (sign bit) will be copied through the whole upper word of the register (bits 31 .. 16). If wasn't so a negative number will become positive.
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
                 ; assuming A1 = 01234567, D0 = FFFFFFFF
   move.w a1, d0 ; copies from an address register, no sign change
                 ; A1 = 01234567, D0 = FFFF4567
   ...
                 ; assuming D0 = 01234567, A0 = FFFFFFFF
   move.w d0, a0 ; copies to an address register, sign change
                 ; D0 = 01234567, A0 = 00004567
   ...
                 ; assuming D0 = 0000FFFF, A1 = 00000000
   move.w d0, a1 ; copies to an address register, sign change
                 ; D0 = 0000FFFF, A1 = FFFFFFFF
&lt;/source&gt;

===INDIRECT===
The content of the registers must be treated as pointers/addresses not values.
====Address register (An)====
* &lt;ea&gt; = (An)
* '''Syntax''': '''(An)''' where n is 0 ... 7
* '''Details''': The operand is in memory. The effective address '''&lt;ea&gt;''' refers the address of this location.
* '''Comments''': Classically C pointer. Size of the operand can be word or long word. If you have a byte value extend the value to the word. All values will be treated as signed values.
* '''Example''':
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
   move.l (a0), d0
&lt;/source&gt;
Copies the long word stored in memory at address specified by register A0 to register D0. When you refer a word or a long word the address of the location must be an even number.
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
                   ; assuming A1 = 00001000, D0 = FFFFFFFF, mem.addr. $1000 = 01234567
   move.w (a1), d0 ; copies word stored at the location pointed by A1 to D0
                   ; A1 = 00001000, D0 = FFFF0123
&lt;/source&gt;
====Address register with postincrement (An)+====
* &lt;ea&gt; = (An); An = An + sizeof(operand)
* '''Syntax''': '''(An)+''' where n is 0 ... 7
* '''Details''': The operand is in memory. The effective address '''&lt;ea&gt;''' refers the address of this location. After the operand is used, the value stored in &lt;ea&gt; is incremented with size of the operand. 
* '''Comments''': Very used in stacks management among with complementary mode -(An). Also is the quickest way to parse forwardly the elements of an array of chars or a string. If the register is the program stack pointer A7/SP, and the operand size is a byte, the address is incremented by two to keep the stack pointer aligned to a word boundary.
* '''Example''':
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
   move.l (a1)+, d0
&lt;/source&gt;
Copies the long word stored in memory at address specified by register A1 to register D0. Then increment value stored in A1 by 4 because of long operand specified in instruction suffix.
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
                    ; assuming A1 = 00001000, D0 = FFFFFFFF, mem.addr. $1000 = 01234567
   move.w (a1)+, d0 ; copies word stored at the location pointed by A1 to D0,
                    ; then increments the value stored in A1 by 2
                    ; A1 = 00001002, D0 = FFFF0123
&lt;/source&gt;
====Address register with predecrement -(An)====
* An = An - sizeof(operand); &lt;ea&gt; = (An)
* '''Syntax''': '''-(An)''' where n is 0 ... 7
* '''Details''': The operand is in memory. First, value contained by the address register is decremented with the size of the operand. The effective address '''&lt;ea&gt;''' refers the address of new location. 
* '''Comments''': Very used in stacks management among with complementary mode (An)+. Also is the quickest way to parse backwardly the elements of an array of chars or a string. If the register is the program stack pointer A7/SP, and the operand size is a byte, the address is decremented by two to keep the stack pointer aligned to a word boundary.
* '''Example''':
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
   move.l -(a0), d0
&lt;/source&gt;
First, value contained by the register A0 is decremented with the 4, size of the long operand, then copies the long word stored in memory at this address to register D0. 
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
                    ; assuming A1 = 00001004, D0 = FFFFFFFF, mem.addr. $1000 = 01234567
   move.w -(a1), d0 ; decrements the value stored in A1 by 2, 
                    ; then copies word stored at the new location pointed by A1 to D0
                    ; A1 = 00001002, D0 = FFFF4567
&lt;/source&gt;
====Address register with displacement (d16, An)====
* &lt;ea&gt; = (An) + d16
* '''Syntax''': '''x(An)''' where n is 0 ... 7 and x is a word
* '''Details''': The operand is in memory. The effective address '''&lt;ea&gt;''' refers the address stored to register An altered with the value of displacement. The displacement is sign extended to 32 bits prior to be used in effective address calculation.
* '''Comments''': Very used to address the global variables using A5 register as reference and the local variables using A7 or A6 register as reference.
* '''Example''':
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
   move.l 4(a1), d0
&lt;/source&gt;
Copies the long word stored in memory at address pointed by register A1 altered (increased in this case) with 4 to register D0. 
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
                    ; assuming A1 = 00001000, D0 = FFFFFFFF, mem.addr. $1002 = 01234567
   move.w 2(a1), d0 ; copies word stored at location pointed by A1 + 2 to D0
                    ; A1 = 00001000, D0 = FFFF0123
   ...
                    ; assuming A1 = 00001000, D0 = FFFFFFFF, mem.addr. $1002 = 01234567
   move.w 4(a1), d0 ; copies word stored at location pointed by A1 + 4 to D0
                    ; A1 = 00001000, D0 = FFFF4567
   ...
                    ; assuming A1 = 00001000, D0 = FFFFFFFF, mem.addr. $1004 = 01234567
   move.l 4(a1), d0 ; copies long word stored at location pointed by A1 + 4 to D0
                    ; A1 = 00001000, D0 = 01234567
&lt;/source&gt;
====Address register with index (d8, An, Xi)====
* &lt;ea&gt; = (An) + (Xi) + d8
* '''Syntax''': 
:::'''x(An,Dn.L)''' where n is 0 ... 7 and x is a byte
:::'''x(An,Dn.W)'''
:::'''x(An,An.L)'''
:::'''x(An,An.W)'''
* '''Details''': The operand is in memory. The effective address '''&lt;ea&gt;''' refers the address stored to register An altered with the value stored to index register Xi, and finally altered with the value of displacement. The displacement is sign extended to 16 bits prior to be used in effective address calculation.
* '''Comments''': Very used to address the elements of an array or the members of a structure.
* '''Example''':
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
   move.l 10(a1, a2.l), d0
&lt;/source&gt;
Copies the long word stored in memory at address A1 + A2 + 10 to register D0.

====Program counter with displacement (d16, PC)====
* &lt;ea&gt; = (PC) + d16
* '''Syntax''': '''x(PC)''' x is a word
* '''Details''': The operand is in memory (inside of the CODE SEGMENT). The effective address '''&lt;ea&gt;''' refers the address stored to PC altered with the value of displacement. The displacement is sign extended to 32 bits prior to be used in effective address calculation. Range of values for displacement -32k to +32k. This is the reason why the CODE SEGMENTS cannot be larger than 32k. If you forgot the PC points the address of the current instruction to be executed, inside the current CODE SEGMENT.
* '''Comments''': Used to address the locations of the branch labels or the routine labels inside of the CODE SEGMENT.

====Program counter with index (d8, PC, Xi)====
* &lt;ea&gt; = (PC) + (Xi) + d8
* '''Syntax''': 
:::'''x(PC,Dn.L)''' where n is 0 ... 7 and x is a byte
:::'''x(PC,Dn.W)'''
:::'''x(PC,An.L)'''
:::'''x(PC,An.W)'''
* '''Details''': Is similar with (d8, An, Xi).
* '''Comments''': Used to address the locations of the branch labels or the routine labels inside of the CODE SEGMENT.

===ABSOLUTE===
The given parameters must be treated as pointers/addresses not values.
====Short/Near Abs.W====
* &lt;ea&gt; = given value
* '''Syntax''': '''x''' where x is 16-bits constant
* '''Details''': The operand is in memory. The effective address '''&lt;ea&gt;''' of this location is the given value.
* '''Comments''': The 16-bits address is sign-extended to 32-bits, means the near addressing can only be used on the first 32Kb. Take care when you use this type of addressing because you can read/write directly the value of any address into the real memory, not only of your application.
* '''Example''':
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
   move.l $1000, d0
&lt;/source&gt;
Copies the long word stored in memory at address $1000 to register D0.

====Long/Far Abs.L====
* &lt;ea&gt; = given value
* '''Syntax''': '''x''' where x is 32-bits constant
* '''Details''': The operand is in memory. The effective address '''&lt;ea&gt;''' of this location is the given value.
* '''Comments''': Take care when you use this type of addressing because you can read/write directly the value of any address into the real memory, not only of your application.
* '''Example''':
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
   move.l $10000, d0
&lt;/source&gt;
Copies the long word stored in memory at address $10000 to register D0.

===IMMEDIATE #data===
* &lt;ea&gt; = none
* '''Syntax''': '''#x''' where x is 8, 16 or 32-bits constant
* '''Details''': 
* '''Comments''': Commonly used for initialization. If you copy a word to an address register the word will be sign-extended.
* '''Example''':
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
   move.l #$10002000, d0
&lt;/source&gt;
Copies the value $10002000 to register D0.

===IMPLIED SR/CCR===
* &lt;ea&gt; = none
* '''Syntax''': '''SR''' or '''CCR'''
* '''Details''': Used to read/write the status or condition code register.
* '''Comments''': The only allowed instruction to access SR/CCR are: MOVE to CCR, MOVE from CCR, ANDI to CCR, ORI to CCR, EORI to CCR, MOVE from SR, MOVE to SR, ANDI to SR, ORI to SR, EORI to SR. If the length is a byte the CCR will be changed. If it is a word, whole SR will be changed, but to do this S-bit (bit 13 from SR) must be set first.
* '''Example''': 
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
                 ; assuming CCR = $00
   ori  #5, ccr  ; 5 | CCR -&gt; CCR
                 ; CCR == $05, $05 == 00000101
&lt;/source&gt;
Set both carry flag (C) and zero flag (Z). The others flags will remain unchanged.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=INTRODUCTION=
Instructions are basic actions of a processor. They are designed to work with the processor registers. Therefore, any instruction that addresses memory locations having at least one register as a parameter. Even if the MOVE instruction when both parameters are memory locations, even in this case the transfer is not actually made directly between the two memory locations, but by successive execution of two instructions MOVE &quot;classical&quot; one, where one parameter is a register.
==What is an instruction?==
Difficult to answer this question. Instructions can substitute assignment or arithmetic operators, conditional statements or loops, can manipulate memory locations, can invoke system routines, can interrupt or continue the execution of a program. No matter what programming environment is a program written, in the end, it will be transformed by the compiler / assembler in a binary package that represents a collection of instructions to be executed by processor. &lt;br /&gt;
A question arises: is the optimal result code? Or it could be improved. For applications developed by large companies, with the participation of a large number of programmers, it could be. But in OnbC compiler/OnbA assembler case, result code is not the best solution, but it is safe. This the main reason to use directly OnbA instead of OnbC.
==Format==
Any instruction has a mnemonic (a name), followed by operand size and one, two or a set of operands. Some instructions have no operands. &lt;br /&gt;
::'''MNEMONIC'''['''.SIZE'''] '''&lt;ea&gt;'''
::'''MNEMONIC'''['''.SIZE'''] '''&lt;ea&gt; , &lt;ea&gt;'''
::'''MNEMONIC'''['''.SIZE'''] '''&lt;ea&gt;/&lt;ea&gt; , &lt;ea&gt;'''
::'''MNEMONIC'''['''.SIZE'''] '''&lt;ea&gt; , &lt;ea&gt;/&lt;ea&gt;'''
::'''MNEMONIC'''
For some instructions, size can be: byte ('''.b'''), word ('''.w''') or long ('''.l'''). &lt;br /&gt;
The effective address &lt;ea&gt; can be represented in one of the address modes: Dn, An, (An), (An)+, -(An), (d16, An), (d8, An, Xi), (d16, PC), (d8, PC, Xi), Abs.W, Abs.L, #data, CCR/SR. See the [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/User:Doruletz72/ONBA/Address_Modes Address Modess chapter]. Examples:
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
   ; one operand
   pea -2(a5)  ; push on the stack address contained in location referred by A5 and offset -2
   unlk a6     ; release stack created with A6, and restore the old value of A6 
   neg.w (a0)+ ; negate (2-complement) the WORD value from location referred by A0, then increment A0 with size of word (2) 
   neg.l d1  ; negate the LONG value from D1
   ...
   ; two operands
   move.b d0, d1 ; copy BYTE value from D0 to D1
   addq.w #100, d0; add  WORD value 100 to the content of D0
   ...
   ; set of operands
   move.l a0-a3, -4(a6) ; copies LONG contents of the registers A0-A3 to the location pointed by A6 - 4
   move.l -2(a5), d0-d7/a0-a4 
   ...
   ; no operands
   rts ; return from a procedure block; restore the old PC address
   reset ; reset the external circuits
&lt;/source&gt;

==Codification==
Each instruction is coded on two bytes (word), which means that the code segment is aligned to word size. Some of the operands can be encoded within this word, and the rest in the words immediately following the instruction. If you intend to disassemble the code record of a PRC file, read the first word, identify the instruction and then, interpret the words that follow, depending on the type of instruction that you just identified it. After decoding all the words belonging to the first instruction, the process can continue in the same way to decode the entire code record. Let's get back to the first instruction word. Usually, first four bits of this word contains the binary '''ID'''entifier of the instruction. The remaining bits can be codification of the size of the operands, or of the number of the registers used as operands, or of the type of the address mode used for the operands.&lt;br /&gt;
Let's consider the instruction ADD - add the source operand to the destination operand, using binary addition and store the result in the destination:
*Source + Destination -&gt; Destination
*'''Synopsis''':
:*ADD &lt;ea&gt;, Dn
:*ADD Dn, &lt;ea&gt;
*'''Operands size:''' .b, .w, .l
*'''Adress Modes:'''
:*if &lt;ea&gt; is the source: Dn, An*, (An), (An)+, -(An), (d16, An), (d8, An, Xi), (d16, PC), (d8, PC, Xi), Abs.W, Abs.L, #data
:*if &lt;ea&gt; is the destination: (An), (An)+, -(An), (d16, An), (d8, An, Xi), Abs.W, Abs.L
:An*: size is word or long only.
Normally, this information is enough to use the ADD instruction in the program. But in case you want to disassemble binary PRC data, you will need additional information:
:*'''Format:''' 1101,3:Reg,3:OpMode,6:3Mode3Reg (16 bits, first word of the instruction)
Where:
:*1101 - 4 bits; signature of ADD instruction
:*3:Reg - 3 bits; the number of Dn register operand (binary codified)
:*3:OpMode - 3 bits; this field specifies:
::*1st bit encodes operation order:
:::0xx &lt;ea&gt; + Dn -&gt; Dn
:::1xx Dn + &lt;ea&gt; -&gt; &lt;ea&gt;
::*2nd and 3rd bits encode the operand size:
:::x00 - byte x01 - word x10 - long x11 - not used
:*6:3Mode3Reg - 6 bits; this codifies address modes of the &lt;ea&gt;; 3Mode field specifies the code of address mode; 3Reg can specifies the number of the register used
{{anchor|Address Modes Table}}
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Address Mode || 3Mode || 3Reg || Address Mode || 3Mode || 3Reg

As suspected, if the situation requires, first word of instruction may be followed by additional words for the operands values not included in the first word of the instruction.&lt;br /&gt;

*'''Flags(CCR):''' not affected. 
*'''Comments:''' moves the contents of selected registers to or from consecutive memory locations starting with the location specified by the effective address &lt;ea&gt;.  A register is selected if the bit in the mask field corresponding to that register is set. The instruction size determines whether 16 or 32 bits of each register are transferred. In the case of a word transfer to either address or data registers, each word is sign-extended to 32 bits, and the resulting long word is loaded into the associated register. Selecting the addressing mode also selects the mode of operation of the MOVEM instruction, and only the control modes, the predecrement mode, and the postincrement mode are valid. If the effective address is specified by one of the control modes, the registers are transferred starting at the specified address, and the address is incremented by the operand length (2 or 4) following each transfer. The order of the registers is from D0 to D7, then from A0 to A7. If the effective address is specified by the predecrement mode, only a register-to-memory operation is allowed. The registers are stored starting at the specified address minus the operand length (2 or 4), and the address is decremented by the operand length following each transfer. The order of storing is from A7 to A0, then from D7 to D0. When the instruction has completed, the decremented address register contains the address of the last operand stored.

==Background==
References: PMID 18042939 
*Male breast cancer accounts for &lt;1% of all breast cancer cases in the US.
*BRCA2: 
**Overall, 14% risk of being BRCA2+ (unselected patients with male breast cancer)
**Risk of BRCA2+ in 77% in men with breast cancer in families with hereditary breast cancer
**Risk for development of breast cancer in BRCA2+ man: 6.3% by age 70 &lt;ref&gt;PMID 9245992 &lt;/ref&gt;; 2.8% by age 70 and 6.9% by 80&lt;ref&gt;PMID 11170890&lt;/ref&gt;; relative risk of 102&lt;ref&gt;PMID 17148771&lt;/ref&gt;
*BRCA1:
**Association is less clear than with BRCA2

==Epidemiology==
*'''MSKCC, 1999''' (1973-94) PMID 10463981 -- &quot;Localized male breast carcinoma and family history. An analysis of 142 patients.&quot; (Hill A, Cancer. 1999 Sep 1;86(5):821-5.)
**142 pts treated at MSKCC or Ochsner Clinic. 
**5-year OS 86%, 10-yr 64%.
**15% of pts had a 1st degree relative with breast cancer. 
**Conclusion: Family history did not affect the age at diagnosis, duration of symptoms, the stage, or survival.


==BRCA mutations==
*'''NCI, 2007''' PMID 18042939 -- &quot;Breast cancer risk among male BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers.&quot; (Tai YC, J Natl Cancer Inst. 2007 Dec 5;99(23):1811-4.)
**Retrospective. 97 men with breast cancer identified in multicenter database of families with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations.
**Male BRCA1 carriers: cumulative risk of breast cancer by age 70 of 1.2%
**BRCA2: cumulative risk by age 70 of 6.8%

==Retrospective series==
*'''MSKCC,1999''' - PMID 10463981 
**see above under Epidemiology

*'''Princess Margaret, 1999''' (1955-96) PMID 10091736 -- &quot;Male breast carcinoma: a review of 229 patients who presented to the Princess Margaret Hospital during 40 years: 1955-1996.&quot; (Goss PE, Cancer. 1999 Feb 1;85(3):629-39.)
**Retrospective. 229 pts over a 42 yr period. 5-yr DFS 47%, OS 53%, LC 91%

In this lesson you will be introduced to the radian as a common unit of angle measure in trigonometry. It is important that you become proficient converting back and forth between degrees and radians. Eventually, much like learning a foreign language, you will become comfortable with radian measure when you can learn to &quot;think&quot; in radians instead of always converting from degree measure. Finally, we will review the calculations of the basic trigonometry functions of angles based on 30, 45, and 60 degree rotations.

==Learning Objectives==
* Define radian measure.
* Convert angle measure from degrees to radians and from radians to degrees.
* Calculate the values of the six trigonometric functions for special angles in terms of radians or degrees.

==Understanding Radian Measure==
Many units of measure come from seemingly arbitrary and archaic roots. Some even change over time. The meter, for example was originally intended to be based on the circumference of the earth and now has an amazingly complicated scientific definition! We typically use degrees to measure angles. Exactly what is a degree? A '''degree''' is 1/360&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of a complete rotation around a circle. Radians are alternate units used to measure angles in trigonometry. Just as it sounds, a radian is based on the ''radius'' of a circle. One '''radian''' is the angle created by bending the radius length around the arc of a circle. Because a radian is based on an actual part of the circle rather than an arbitrary division, it is a much more natural unit of angle measure for upper level mathematics and will be especially useful when you move on to study calculus.

:[[File:Radian - en.svg|400px]]

What if we were to rotate all the way around the circle? Continuing to add radius lengths, we find that it takes a little more than 6 of them to complete the rotation.

:[[File:Radian Measure Figure 1.svg|400px]]

But the arc length of a complete rotation is really the circumference! The circumference is equal to the 2π times the length of the radius. 2π is approximately 6.28, so the circumference is a little more than 6 radius lengths. Or, in terms of radian measure, a complete rotation (360 degrees) is 2π radians.

With this as our starting point, we can find the radian measure of other angles easily. Half of a rotation, or 180 degrees, must therefore be π radians, and 90 degrees must be one-half pi. Complete the table below:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;
|+ Table 2.1
! scope=&quot;col&quot; | Angle in Degrees
! scope=&quot;col&quot; | Angle in Radians
|-
| 90 || &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\pi}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| 45 || &amp;nbsp;
|-
| 30 || &amp;nbsp;
|-
| 60 || &amp;nbsp;
|-
| 75 || &amp;nbsp;
|}

Because 45 is half of 90, half of one-half π is one-fourth π. 30 is one-third of a right angle, so multiplying gives:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\pi}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{\pi}{6}&lt;/math&gt;

and because 60 is twice as large as 30:

:&lt;math&gt;2 \cdot \frac{\pi}{6} = \frac{2\pi}{6} = \frac{\pi}{3}&lt;/math&gt;

Here is the completed table:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;
|+ Table 2.2
! scope=&quot;col&quot; | Angle in Degrees
! scope=&quot;col&quot; | Angle in Radians
|-
| 90 || &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\pi}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| 45 || &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\pi}{4}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| 30 || &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\pi}{6}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| 60 || &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\pi}{3}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| 75 || &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{5\pi}{12}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

The last value was found by adding the radian measures of 30 and 45:

:{| style=&quot;background:transparent;&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
| style=&quot;text-align:right;&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\frac{\pi}{4} + \frac{\pi}{6} =&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\frac{3 \cdot \pi}{3 \cdot 4} + \frac{2 \cdot \pi}{2 \cdot 6}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| style=&quot;text-align:right;&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\frac{3\pi}{12} + \frac{2\pi}{12} =&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\frac{5\pi}{12}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

There is a formula to help you convert between radians and degrees that you may already have discovered and we will discuss shortly, however, most angles that you will commonly use can be found easily from the values in this table, so learning them based on the circumference should help increase your comfort level with radians greatly. For example, most students find it easy to remember 30 and 60. 30 is π over 6 and 60 is π over 3. If you know these angles, you can find any of the special angles that have reference angles of 30 and 60 because they will all have the same denominators. The same is true of multiples of pi over 4 (45 degrees) and pi over 2 (90 degrees).

==&quot;Count&quot;ing in Radians==
Do you remember as a child watching the Count on Sesame Street? He would count objects like apples, &quot;one apple, two apples, three apples…&quot; and then laugh fiendishly as lightning and thunder erupted around him. Well, to be successful with radian measure, you need to learn to count all over again using radians instead of apples. Let's start counting right angles, which are really &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\pi}{2}&lt;/math&gt; radians.

:&quot;'''one''' π over 2, '''two''' π over 2 (really just π), '''three''' π over 2, '''four''' π over 2 (which is really 2π)&quot;

{{plain image with caption|90 degree rotations expressed in radian measure.svg|'''Figure 2.1''': 90-degree rotations expressed in radian measure.|400|none}}

You just covered all the angles that are multiples of 90 degrees in one rotation.

Here is the drawing for 45-degree angles:

{{plain image with caption|45 degree rotations expressed in radian measure.svg|'''Figure 2.2''': 45-degree rotations.|400|none}}

Notice that the additional angles in the drawing all have reference angles of 45 degrees and their radian measures are all multiples of &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\pi}{4}&lt;/math&gt;.  Complete the following radian measures by counting in multiples of &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\pi}{3}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\pi}{6}&lt;/math&gt;:

{| style=&quot;background:transparent; margin-left:1em;&quot;
| {{plain image with caption|60 degree reference angles.svg|'''Figure 2.3''': 60-degree reference angles.|300|none}}
| {{plain image with caption|30 degree reference angles.svg|'''Figure 2.4''': 30-degree reference angles.|300|none}}
|}

{{plain image with caption|60 degree rotations expressed in radian measure.svg|'''Figure 2.5''': 60-degree reference angle radian measure through one rotation.|400|none}}

{{plain image with caption|30 degree rotations expressed in radian measure.svg|'''Figure 2.6''': 30-degree reference angle radian measure through one rotation.|400|none}}

Notice that all of the angles with 60-degree reference angles are multiples of &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\pi}{3}&lt;/math&gt;, and all of those with 30-degree reference angles are multiples of &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\pi}{6}&lt;/math&gt;  If you can learn to count in these terms, rather than constantly having to convert back to degrees, it will help you to be effective dealing with most radian measures that you will encounter.

For other examples there is a formula.  Remember that:

: &lt;math&gt;\pi\text{ radians} = 180\text{ degrees}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

If you divide both sides of this equality by 180 you will uncover the formula for easy conversion:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\pi}{180}\text{ radians} = 1\text{ degree}&lt;/math&gt;

so

:&lt;math&gt;\text{radians} \cdot \frac{180}{\pi} = \text{degrees}&lt;/math&gt;

If we have a degree measure and wish to convert it to radians, then manipulating the equation above gives:

:&lt;math&gt;\text{degrees} \cdot \frac{\pi}{180} = \text{radians}&lt;/math&gt;

{{Robox|theme=10|title=Example 1}}
Convert &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{11\pi}{3}&lt;/math&gt; to degree measure.

----

'''Solution''':

Well, if you followed the last section, you should recognize that this angle is a multiple of &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\pi}{3}&lt;/math&gt; (or 60 degrees), so there are 11 individual &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\pi}{3}&lt;/math&gt;'s in this angle: &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\pi}{3}&lt;/math&gt; · 11 = 60 · 11 = 660°.

Here is what it would look like using the formula:

:{| cellpadding=&quot;3&quot; style=&quot;background:transparent;&quot;
| style=&quot;text-align:right;&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\text{radians} \cdot \frac{180}{\pi}=&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\text{degrees}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| style=&quot;text-align:right;&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\frac{11\pi}{3} \cdot \frac{180}{\pi}=&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;11\cdot 60 = 660^\circ\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Convert −120° to radian measure.  Leave the answer in terms of π.

----

'''Solution''':

Using the formula:

:{| cellpadding=&quot;3&quot; style=&quot;background:transparent;&quot;
| style=&quot;text-align:right;&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\text{degrees} \cdot \frac{\pi}{180} =&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\text{radians}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| style=&quot;text-align:right;&quot; | &lt;math&gt;-120 \cdot \frac{\pi}{180} =&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\frac{-120\pi}{180}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

and reducing to lowest terms gives:

:&lt;math&gt;-\frac{2\pi}{3}&lt;/math&gt;

However, you could also realize that 120 is 2 · 60.  Since 60° is &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\pi}{3}&lt;/math&gt; radians, then 120 is 2 individual &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\pi}{3}&lt;/math&gt;'s, or &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{2\pi}{3}&lt;/math&gt;.  Make it negative and you have the answer, −&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{2\pi}{3}&lt;/math&gt;.

{{Robox|theme=10|title=Example 3}}
Express &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{11\pi}{12}&lt;/math&gt; radians in degree measure.

{{NOTE|Sometimes students have trouble remembering if it is &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{180}{\pi}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\pi}{180}&lt;/math&gt;.  It might be helpful to remember that radian measure is almost always expressed in terms of π. If you want to convert from radians to degrees, you want the π to cancel out when you multiply, so it must be in the denominator.}}

==Radians, Degrees, and a Calculator==
Most scientific and graphing calculators have a &lt;tt&gt;[MODE]&lt;/tt&gt; setting that will allow you to either convert between radians and degrees, or to find approximations for trig functions using either measure. It is important that if you are using your calculator to estimate a trig function that you know which mode you are using. Look at the following screen:

&lt;div style=&quot;background-color:white; border:1px solid #000000; padding:0px 5px 0px 5px; margin-left:2em; width:120px; font-family: 'DejaVu Sans Mono', 'FreeMono', 'Nimbus Mono L', 'Liberation Mono', 'Courier New', 'Courier', monospace; font-size:12px;&quot;&gt;
sin(30)&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:right; margin:0px; padding:0px;&quot;&gt;-.9880316241&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

If you entered this expecting to find the sine of 30 ''degrees'' you would realize based on the last chapter that something is wrong because it should be &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;. In fact, as you may have suspected, the calculator is interpreting this as 30 ''radians''. In this case, changing the mode to degrees and recalculating we give the expected result.

&lt;div style=&quot;background-color:white; border:1px solid #000000; padding:0px 5px 0px 5px; margin-left:2em; width:120px; font-family: 'DejaVu Sans Mono', 'FreeMono', 'Nimbus Mono L', 'Liberation Mono', 'Courier New', 'Courier', monospace; font-size:12px;&quot;&gt;
sin(30)&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:right; margin:0px; padding:0px;&quot;&gt;-.9880316241&lt;/div&gt;
sin(30)&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:right; margin:0px; padding:0px;&quot;&gt;.5&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Scientific calculators will usually have a 3−letter display that shows either &lt;tt&gt;DEG&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;RAD&lt;/tt&gt; to tell you which mode you are in. Always check before calculating a trig ratio!

{{Robox|theme=10|title=Example 4}}
Find the tangent of &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{3\pi}{4}&lt;/math&gt;.

----

'''Solution''':

First of all, shame on you if you are using a calculator to find this answer! You should know this one!  &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{3\pi}{4}&lt;/math&gt; is a 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; quadrant angle with a reference angle of &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\pi}{4}&lt;/math&gt; (45 degrees).  The tangent of &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\pi}{4}&lt;/math&gt; is 1, and because tangent is negative in quadrant II, the answer is −1.  To verify this on your calculator, make sure the mode is set to ''radians'', and evaluate the tangent of &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{3\pi}{4}&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;div style=&quot;background-color:white; border:1px solid #000000; padding:0px 5px 0px 5px; margin-left:2em; width:120px; font-family: 'DejaVu Sans Mono', 'FreeMono', 'Nimbus Mono L', 'Liberation Mono', 'Courier New', 'Courier', monospace; font-size:12px;&quot;&gt;
tan(3π/4)&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:right; margin:0px; padding:0px;&quot;&gt;-1&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

{{Robox|theme=10|title=Example 5}}
Find the value of cos &lt;math&gt;\left (\tfrac{11\pi}{6}\right )&lt;/math&gt; to four decimal places.

----

'''Solution''':

Again, you should know the ''exact'' value based on your previous work.  &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{11\pi}{6}&lt;/math&gt; has a reference angle of &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\pi}{6}&lt;/math&gt; (30 degrees) and the sign of &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\pi}{6}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}&lt;/math&gt;.  Because &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{11\pi}{6}&lt;/math&gt; is in the 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; quadrant, the cosine is positive and so the exact answer is &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}&lt;/math&gt;.  Using the calculator gives:

&lt;div style=&quot;background-color:white; border:1px solid #000000; padding:0px 5px 0px 5px; margin-left:2em; width:120px; font-family: 'DejaVu Sans Mono', 'FreeMono', 'Nimbus Mono L', 'Liberation Mono', 'Courier New', 'Courier', monospace; font-size:12px;&quot;&gt;
cos(11π/6)&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:right; margin:0px; padding:0px;&quot;&gt;.8660254038&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Which, when rounded, is 0.8660. You can verify that it is indeed a very good approximation of our exact answer using your calculator as well.

&lt;div style=&quot;background-color:white; border:1px solid #000000; padding:0px 5px 0px 5px; margin-left:2em; width:120px; font-family: 'DejaVu Sans Mono', 'FreeMono', 'Nimbus Mono L', 'Liberation Mono', 'Courier New', 'Courier', monospace; font-size:12px;&quot;&gt;
cos(11π/6)&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:right; margin:0px; padding:0px;&quot;&gt;.8660254038&lt;/div&gt;
&amp;radic;(3)/2&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:right; margin:0px; padding:0px;&quot;&gt;.8660254038&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

{{Robox|theme=10|title=Example 6}}
Convert 1 radian to degree measure.

----

'''Solution''':

Many students get so used to using π in radian measure that they incorrectly think that 1 radian means 1π radians. While it is more convenient and common to express radian measure in terms of π, don't lose sight of the fact that π radians is actually a number! It specifies an angle created by a rotation of approximately 3.14 radius lengths. So 1 radian is a rotation created by an arc that is only a single radius in length. Look back at Figure 1.1. What would you estimate the degree measure of this angle to be? It is certainly acute and appears similar to a 60° angle. To find a closer approximation, we will need the formula and a calculator.

:&lt;math&gt;\text{radians} \cdot \frac{180}{\pi} = \text{degrees}&lt;/math&gt;

So 1 radian would be &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{180}{\pi}&lt;/math&gt; degrees.  Using any scientific or graphing calculator will give a reasonable approximation for this degree measure, approximately 57.3°.

&lt;div style=&quot;background-color:white; border:1px solid #000000; padding:0px 5px 0px 5px; margin-left:2em; width:120px; font-family: 'DejaVu Sans Mono', 'FreeMono', 'Nimbus Mono L', 'Liberation Mono', 'Courier New', 'Courier', monospace; font-size:12px;&quot;&gt;
180/π&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:right; margin:0px; padding:0px;&quot;&gt;57.29577951&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
{{Robox/Close}}

{{Robox|theme=10|title=Example 7}}
Find the radian measure of an acute angle ''θ'' with a sin ''θ'' = 0.7071.

----

'''Solution''':

First of all, it is important to understand that your calculator will most likely ''not'' give you radian measure in terms of π, but a decimal approximation instead. In this case you need to use the inverse sine function.

&lt;div style=&quot;background-color:white; border:1px solid #000000; padding:0px 5px 0px 5px; margin-left:2em; width:120px; font-family: 'DejaVu Sans Mono', 'FreeMono', 'Nimbus Mono L', 'Liberation Mono', 'Courier New', 'Courier', monospace; font-size:12px;&quot;&gt;
sin&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;(.7071)&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:right; margin:0px; padding:0px;&quot;&gt;.7853885734&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

This answer may not look at all familiar, but 0.7071 may sound familiar to you. It is an approximation of &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2}&lt;/math&gt;.  So, as you may know, this is really a 45° angle.  Sure enough, evaluating &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\pi}{4}&lt;/math&gt; will show that the calculator is giving its best approximation of the radian measure.

&lt;/div&gt;

If it bothers you that they are not ''exactly'' the same, good, it should! Remember that 0.7071 is only an approximation of &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\pi}{4}&lt;/math&gt;, so we are already starting off with some rounding error.

==Lesson Summary==
Angles can be measured in degrees or radians. A radian is the angle defined by an arc length equal to the radius length bent around the circle. One complete rotation around a circle, or 360° is equal to 2π radians. To convert from degrees to radians you use the following formula:

:&lt;math&gt;\text{degrees} \cdot \frac{\pi}{180} = \text{radians}&lt;/math&gt;

To convert from radians to degrees the formula becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;\text{radians} \cdot \frac{180}{\pi} = \text{degrees}&lt;/math&gt;

Much like learning a foreign language where you have to memorize vocabulary to be successful, it will be very helpful for you to understand and be able to communicate in radian measure if you become familiar with the radian measures of the quadrant angles (90° = &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\pi}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, 180° = π, 270° = &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{3\pi}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, 360° = 2π) and special angles (30° = &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\pi}{6}&lt;/math&gt;, 45° = &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\pi}{4}&lt;/math&gt;, 60° = &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\pi}{3}&lt;/math&gt;).

The image can be considered to result in a health benefit to the patient from the radiation exposure.  The generation of images of high quality at low patient dose can therefore be considered to be a key objective of Diagnostic Radiography.  Digital radiography images are generally viewed on specialised computer screens for diagnostic reporting.  Technical features of such screens are considered in this chapter and objective measures of physical image quality are described.  Various methods for evaluating image quality are also discussed.

== Image Display ==

[[W:CRT_display|CRT displays]] were once the only devices which could be used for displaying digital radiographic images. This situation changed in the early 21st century following the development of [[W:Liquid_crystal_display|Liquid Crystal Displays]] (LCDs) for use in digital television as well as in home and business computers. Medical imaging has benefitted from these developments. However it should be appreciated that digital radiography displays require superior performance because of the relatively large number of pixels in CR and DR images&lt;ref&gt;&lt;small&gt;Samei E, Ranger NT &amp; Delong DM, 2008. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18491530 A comparative contrast-detail study of five medical displays]]. Med Phys, 35:1358-64.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.

An LCD is a two-dimensional, electro-optical light modulator that is mounted in front of a back-light - see Figure 6.1. The light is modulated for each pixel by applying an electric field to a thin layer of nematic [[W:Liquid_crystal|liquid crystal]] mounted between two polarising films. Active Matrix Liquid Crystal Displays ([[W:Active-matrix_liquid_crystal_display|AMLCDs]]) apply the electric field to each pixel using a large array of [[W:Thin-film_transistor|Thin Film Transistor]] (TFT) switches made from [[W:Amorphous_silicon|amorphous silicon]] (a-Si) deposited on a glass substrate.

[[File:lcdSandwich.jpg|thumb|Fig. 6.1: Illustration of the sandwich of materials used to form an LCD.]]

Note that the development of such large TFT arrays has also led to the subsequent development of [[Basic_Physics_of_Digital_Radiography/The_Image_Receptor#Digital_Radiography|DR image receptors]].

The size of the monitor screens used in digital radiography is generally sufficient for 35 cm x 43 cm radiographs to be displayed at a resolution of 2,048x2,560 pixels (i.e. 5 megapixels) in [[W:Portrait_mode|portrait mode]], for instance, although 3 megapixel displays are also in use. Conventional computer monitors have been found to be inadequate for primary radiographic diagnosis, but can be used subsequently for display in conjunction with a radiological report. Display [[W:Luminance|luminance]] is also high, &gt;200 cd/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; typically, so as to achieve an image brightness adequate for diagnostic purposes. In addition, images are generally displayed following corrections for human [[W:Visual_perception|visual perception]]. The [[W:Digital_Imaging_and_Communications_in_Medicine|Grayscale Standard Display Function]] (GSDF), for instance, is widely applied in an attempt to generate consistent rendition of images irrespective of the actual display device used.

[[File:lcdDeconstruction.jpg|thumb|Fig. 6.1.5: Deconstruction of a medical-grade 3-Megapixel display.]]

Components of a medical-grade LCD are shown in Figure 6.1.5.  Here the LCD sandwich is shown in the top right photo, the back light consisting of fluorescent strips in the bottom left (note that the diffusing layer has been removed) and the LCD active layer in the bottom right.  The device contains a small photodetector at the faceplate (not shown) which is used to maintain the brightness of the displayed image, and an ambient light sensor.

Veiling glare degrades image quality as a result of light scattering within the display’s faceplate and electronic [[W:Crosstalk_(electronics)|cross-talk]]. This results in a low-frequency, image-dependent degradation of subtle features especially in dark regions with nearby bright areas. Veiling glare must therefore be minimised in the design of medical diagnostic displays.  Luminance uniformity is also an important feature.

The ambient lighting in the reporting room has been found to be critical. This is mainly because of light reflections onto the screen. Such reflections are generally of two types: [[W:Specular_reflection|specular]] (where spatial features of the reflecting objects can be seen in the reflection) and [[W:Diffuse_reflection|diffuse]] (which adds a relatively uniform luminance to the displayed image). Both types need to be minimised through appropriate room design.

Given the demanding applications for which these displays are used, many have features for remote performance monitoring and calibration for quality assurance purposes.

== Image Contrast ==

[[File:videoCameraGamma.jpg|thumb|Fig. 6.2: Transfer characteristic for three types of video camera.]]

[[Basic_Physics_of_Digital_Radiography/The_Patient#Subject_Contrast|Subject contrast]], developed by exposing the patient to an X-ray beam, is converted to image contrast on the display monitor.  In general, this conversion is expressed by the '''Transfer Characteristic''' of the image receptor and can be obtained by plotting the radiation exposures necessary to generate a broad range of image receptor outputs.  The transfer characteristic is generally linear in the case of CR and DR imagers, but this is not always so with XII-video systems.  The XII itself generally has a linear characteristic, but some video cameras, e.g. the vidicon, may use a transfer characteristic which selectively boosts low exposure regions of images - see Figure 6.2.  This type of behaviour is usually characterised by a power function which is expressed by what is called the camera's '''[[W:Gamma_correction|Gamma]]''', &amp;gamma;, i.e.

&lt;center&gt;I = k L&lt;sup&gt;&amp;gamma;&lt;/sup&gt;,&lt;/center&gt;

where I is the signal current developed by the video camera when L is light exposure at its input and k is the electronic gain.  In the case of the Plumbicon and Chalnicon, the gamma is close to unity, while for the vidicon its of the order of 0.7.

Image contrast is also affected by scattering processes within the image receptor.  In the case of the XII, with is multi-stage image transduction, these processes include:

::*X-ray scattering (Compton effects) in the entrance window,
::*X-ray scattering (Compton effects) in the input phosphor,
::*Lateral diffusion of light in the input phosphor,
::*Lateral diffusion of light in the output phosphor,
::*Electron scattering within the body of the XII tube, and
::*Retrograde emission of visible light by the output phosphor which cause electrons to be ejected from the photocathode which in turn will give rise to light emission from the output phosphor.

[[File:crTransferChar.jpg|thumb|Fig. 6.3: The transfer characteristic of CR technology showing excellent linearity and broad dynamic range, properties not shared by the traditional film-screen technology (see the red curve).]]

These scattering effects are collectively referred to as '''Veiling Glare'''.  They're substantially less with CR and DR image receptors, at below 10% as opposed to 30% or more in the XII, but they can nevertheless manifest themselves in a manner similar to scattered X-rays in the detected radiation beam and provide similar reductions in contrast.

Image contrast, in the context of our [[Basic_Physics_of_Digital_Radiography/The_Patient#Subject_Contrast|earlier consideration]], can be given simply by an expression derived from the subject contrast in scatter conditions, i.e.

&lt;center&gt;C = k [ln (I&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;+S+G) - ln (I&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;+S+G)]&lt;/center&gt;

where k is the gain of the image receptor and G is the veiling glare signal.  Once again, note that G is assumed to be the same in both bone and tissue regions in the above expression, when in fact it can be expected to vary slowly throughout an image.

[[File:pelvicPhantom.jpg|thumb|left|Fig. 6.4: Images of a pelvic phantom demonstrating the dynamic range of CR. The image on the left is taken using 2 mAs and the one on the right using 160 mAs exposure. The major discernible difference is a marked increase in variability of grey levels in the lower exposure image (e.g. see the region shown arrowed, for example).]]

A second parameter to be derived from the transfer characteristic is the [[W:Dynamic_range|dynamic range]], which expresses the range of input signals over which the image receptor is sensitive.  In the case of CR, its about four orders of magnitude - see Figure 6.3, which shows its transfer characteristic in comparison to the traditional film/screen technology.  The result is that under-exposure and over-exposure of regions traditionally seen radiographs are much less of an issue in clinical imaging.  This feature of CR is illustrated by the radiographs in Figure 6.4.

In fluoroscopy, automatic brightness control (ABC) and automatic dose rate control (ADRC) can be used to adjust the X-ray exposure factors to match the patient's anatomy being examined, as discussed in an [[Basic_Physics_of_Digital_Radiography/The_Image_Receptor|earlier chapter]].  This can be achieved using a photodetector at the XII output to sense image brightness, for instance, so as to feed a signal back to the HV generator to automatically adjust the kV and/or the mA.  It can also be achieved using the image signals themselves, sampled from the central portion of images, for example.

== Spatial Resolution ==

[[W:Spatial_resolution|Spatial resolution]] refers to the ability of a radiographic imaging system to record fine detail.  Obviously, detail is a pre-requisite for clinical images of excellent quality.  However, it should be appreciated that not all image receptors demonstrate the same performance in this regard.

[[File:pbBarTO.jpg|thumb|Fig. 6.5: A spatial resolution test object.]]

The maximum spatial resolution of an imaging system can be readily obtained by imaging a resolution test object - an example of which is shown in Figure 6.5, panel (a).  The test object consists of narrow parallel slits in a lead sheet at spacings which decrease to beyond the maximum resolution of the image receptor.  The minimum spacing resolved in images is called the '''Limiting Spatial Resolution''' and can be determined to be about 3.5 line pairs/mm from the figure.  

Note that the width of each slit in the test object is the same as that of the adjacent piece of lead, so that the radiation intensity transmitted through the test object can be considered in profile to be represented by a square wave - see panel (b).  A '''Spatial Period''' (usually measured in mm) can be used to characterize this square wave and is equal to the width of one line pair, i.e. the width of a slit plus its adjacent piece of lead.  Its reciprocal is called the [[W:Spatial_frequency|Spatial Frequency]], which is generally expressed in line pairs/mm (LP/mm) or cycles/mm.

[[File:pbBarTOprofile.jpg|thumb|left|Fig. 6.6: Profile (in blue) through a radiograph of a lead bar test object.]]

An amplitude profile through an image of the test object allows the modulation at each spatial frequency to be determined - see Figure 6.6 - and can be used to provide more complete information than the limiting resolution on its own.  

Here, the modulation is obtained from the difference between the maximum and minimum pixel value at each spatial frequency and expressed in the form of a '''Square Wave Response''' (SWR) as shown in Figure 6.7.  The modulation is seen to be relatively constant at low spatial frequencies and then to decrease rapidly towards zero.  The SWR allows the spatial imaging capabilities to be expressed for both broad, relatively uniform objects, i.e. those with low spatial frequencies, and fine detail, i.e. those with high spatial frequencies, as well as features with intermediate frequencies.

[[File:sqrf.jpg|thumb|Fig. 6.7: A square wave response.]]

A more complete and elegant approach to the assessment of spatial resolution is provided by [[Basic_Physics_of_Digital_Radiography/The_Basics#The_Fourier_Transform|Fourier methods]].  These computations can be used in the mathematical analysis of factors which contribute to and detract from the generation of images with excellent spatial resolution.

[[File:screenLSF.jpg|thumb|left|Fig. 6.8: The Line Spread Function (LSF) and its origin for an X-ray intensifying screen.]]

Fourier methods can be used to analyse the response of an imaging system to a square wave input using a narrow slit in a sheet of lead, for instance.  Remember that a square wave is the equivalent of the sum of an infinite number of sine waves.  The imaging of such a slit is illustrated in Figure 6.8 where the transmitted radiation is seen to excite fluorescence in an intensifying screen.  The fluorescent light is emitted in all directions and the image of the slit therefore becomes spread out over a broader area than is ideal.  The effect is seen in the illuminance profile which consists of a central peak, as expected, with tails extending around it.  This type of profile is called the '''Line Spread Function''' (LSF). The effect on the slit’s image as a result is seen as a slight tinge of greyness around the slit’s edges to an extent given by the tails of the LSF.  Better performance can therefore be seen as a narrowing in the LSF and a suppression of its tails.

The same type of data can be obtained for 2 dimensions using a small hole in a sheet of lead and is called the [[W:Point_spread_function|Point Spread Function]] (PSF).

[[File:mtfBasic.jpg|thumb|Fig. 6.9: The modulation transfer function (MTF).]]

When the Fourier Transform of an LSF is calculated, then the imaging system’s response to sine waves of all spatial frequencies is obtained.  This response is called the [[W:Inverse_Fourier_transform|Modulation Transfer Function]] (MTF) - see Figure 6.9.  It can be seen that the modulation falls off with increasing spatial frequency, as was seen with the Square Wave Response, but as a continuous curve representing all, and not just discrete, spatial frequencies.

The response of an ideal imaging system is also shown in the figure.  Its constant value of 1.0 at all spatial frequencies implies that all details in the patient will be imaged perfectly, unlike our real intensifying screen whose modulation drops by 20% at spatial frequency, A, and by 90% at frequency, B, for example - whatever their absolute values might be.

[[File:mtfTwoSystems.jpg|thumb|left|Fig. 6.10: MTFs of two hypothetical image receptors.]]

Spatial frequency, B, in Figure 6.9 can be considered to be approaching the extreme of the resolving capability of an imaging system.  The limiting spatial resolution is sometimes defined as the frequency where the modulation drops to 4%.  When the resolving ability of two different image receptors is compared, as in Figure 6.10 for instance, we could infer from measuring the limiting resolution alone that system B was superior to system A, at 8 compared to 5 LP/mm.  An MTF comparison would reveal however that system B in fact provides superior quality at frequencies less than about 3 LP/mm, which is where many features of clinical interest said to lie.
 
[[File:mtfCR.jpg|thumb|Fig. 6.11: MTFs for phosphor plates used in CR. Curves are for high resolution (HR) and standard (ST) plates. The MTF for a 400-speed film/screen receptor is also shown for comparative purposes.]]

The MTF performance of film/screen radiography is compared with Computed Radiography (CR) in Figure 6.11.  It can be seen that the standard resolution CR system (ST) is about equivalent to a regular film/screen receptor across the frequency range.  It can also be seen that the HR computed radiography system provides an improvement of ~20% at the intermediate spatial frequencies, while it approaches the performance of the other two receptors above 4 LP/mm.

[[File:mtfXII.jpg|thumb|left|Fig. 6.12: The MTFs of components of an X-ray image intensifier.]]

A major advantage of the MTF concept is that for an image receptor with a number of image transduction stages, the overall MTF can be obtained from the product of the individual component MTFs. This feature is demonstrated in Figure 6.12, which shows the component MTFs for an X-ray image intensifier. It can be seen that the contrast at high spatial frequencies is limited by the behaviour of the input phosphor and not the output phosphor in this hypothetical case. Thus, from a design point of view, a reduction in veiling glare in the input phosphor should improve the overall MTF of the XII. As an example of the multiplicative property of the MTFs, with reference to the figure, note that at a spatial frequency of 3 LP/mm the MTF of the image intensifier is:

&lt;center&gt;Modulation = 0.78x0.55x0.48 = 0.21.&lt;/center&gt;

[[File:pbBarTOprofileScatter.jpg|thumb|Fig. 6.13: Profile (in green) through a radiograph of a resolution test object imaged in scatter conditions.  The no scatter case is shown in blue for comparison.]]

In the presence of scatter, we can expect the reduction in contrast to give rise to reduced modulation at all spatial frequencies and a reduced ability to discriminate fine detail.  This is illustrated in Figure 6.13 where modulation reduction is quite evident.  

[[File:swrNormalizedSWR.jpg|thumb|left|Fig. 6.14: The absolute SWR in scatter and no scatter conditions is shown on the left, while a normalised plot is shown on the right.]]

The impact on the square wave response is shown in Figure 6.14.  It can be seen that scatter reduces the amplitude of the SWR and eliminates the modulation at frequencies above 2 LP/mm, in this case, so that they can no longer be resolved.  

Note that a large reduction in modulation at very low spatial frequencies can be inferred from the [[:File:swrNormalizedSWR.jpg|figure]].  This phenomenon is generally referred to as the '''Low Frequency Drop''' and could conceivably be used as an indicator of scatter (and veiling glare) levels.

== Image Noise ==

Mottle can typically be seen in radiographic images as minute random fluctuations in the greyness of the anatomical details portrayed - see the images in Figure 6.4, for an example.  When these fluctuations are large enough, they may obscure subtle changes in image contrast and render details invisible on the image.  We will consider the major source of mottle below.

[[File:noiseAddition.jpg|thumb|Fig. 6.15: Impact of noise on the ability to image objects of varying contrast. As the object contrast decreases the ability to discriminate it is masked by the noise.]]

The imaging of three objects of the same size but differing contrasts is considered in Figure 6.15.  Here, profiles through each object can be seen to decrease in amplitude until they are just above the background gray level.  In the presence of fluctuations in signal amplitude (generally called [[W:Noise_(video)|Noise]]), the ability to discern the low contrast object is severely compromised.  The noise is seen to add a randomness to both the object and its background.

[[File:noiseMottle.jpg|thumb|left|&lt;small&gt;Fig. 6.16: When an area of an image receptor is subdivided into small elements each element will absorb different numbers of X-ray photons because of statistical fluctuations in photon flux. In the left hand matrix the average photon flux is 100 per unit area with a standard deviation of 10 leading to quantum mottle of 10%. By increasing the photon flux by a factor of 100 the mottle can be decreased to 1% as shown in the right hand matrix.&lt;/small&gt;]]

Let’s continue by considering two equally-sized small areas of a hypothetical digital image containing nine pixels.  And let’s consider that the number of X-ray photons collected by each pixel is given by the numbers in Figure 6.16.  We can estimate that for the area on the left, the average number of photons detected is 100, while that on the right, possibly as a result of lower attenuation, collects an average of 10,000 photons.  The variation in the individual pixels within each area can be estimated statistically from the [[W:Standard_deviation|standard deviation]] of the number of detected photons.  The standard deviation can be calculated from the square root of the mean when the photon number is assumed to follow a [[W:Poisson_distribution|Poisson distribution]] as is the situation in radiography.  The variation arises because of the random nature of X-ray emission that occurs within the anode of the X-ray tube and gives rise to what is called [[W:Quantum_noise|Quantum Noise]].

Quantum noise is generally expressed as being plus/minus one standard deviation of the mean.  The noise in our panel on the left is therefore ±10 photons, while that on the right is considerably higher at ±100 photons.  It can therefore be inferred that noise increases with the number of X-rays detected.  On this basis, it can be concluded that noise increases with radiation exposure, i.e. mAs.

The mottle is given by the ratio of the noise to the mean number of photons and therefore is 10% for the left panel and just 1% for that on the right.  The mottle as a result is more apparent in the left than it is in the right.  In other words, mottle decreases with increasing radiation exposure so that subtle contrasts become more conspicuous.

The [[W:Signal-to-noise_ratio|Signal-to-Noise Ratio]] (SNR) is a more general concept applied in this form of image analysis and is given by the ratio of the noise to the mean signal.  Therefore, its 10:1 on the left, while its considerably higher at 100:1 for the right hand panel.  We can infer therefore that the SNR increases with increasing radiation exposure, implying improved image quality at higher mAs and for lower attenuating tissues.

Note that an assumption underlying the above discussion is that random X-ray emission is the sole source of random variations in the grey level of images.  In reality, noise also arises from electronic components within the digital image receptor.  This electronic source is sometimes called System Noise and should generally be much less than the Quantum Noise.  Note however that should the system noise increase above that due to quantum fluctuations, because of faulty electronics, for example, then increases in radiation exposure (i.e. mAs) to offset the appearance of mottle are unlikely to have any major effect on image quality. 

A final point to note is that the dependence of image noise on spatial frequency can be analysed using Fourier methods giving rise to the so-called Wiener Spectrum of an image receptor.

== Detective Quantum Efficiency (DQE) ==

[[File:dqeConcept.jpg|thumb|Fig. 6.17: The image reception process and the origin of the input and output SNR ratios.]]

The [[W:Detective_quantum_efficiency|DQE]] combines the effects on modulation, spatial frequency and noise of an image receptor and can be used to compare different receptors in a more general manner than the MTF alone - see Figure 6.17.  The parameter relates the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of images displayed by the imaging system, SNR&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt;, to the SNR of the incident X-ray intensity pattern, SNR&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;, i.e.

&lt;center&gt;DQE (f) = (SNR&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt;/SNR&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

[[File:exampleDQEs.jpg|thumb|left|Fig. 6.18: Illustrative comparison of the DQE for four possible image receptors: direct digital radiography (a-Se), indirect digital radiography (CsI), computed radiography (CR) and the traditional 400-speed screen/film (400 S/F).]]

where the DQE is defined as a function of spatial frequency. The imaging performance of different image receptors receptors is illustrated in Figure 6.18. Note that a perfect image receptor would have a DQE of 1.0 at all spatial frequencies.  In the cases illustrated, note that the DQE performance of CR is similar to that of a traditional regular screen/film combination.  Note also that the digital technologies illustrated show substantially superior DQE at all spatial frequencies, heralding potential dose reductions relative to those necessary with traditional and CR image receptors. In addition, the DQE of indirect image receptors is about 10-15% greater than XII-video technology.

DQE measurements are generally used to compare the physical image quality of different image receptor technologies.  Measurement methods have therefore been developed which are specified in standards such as those of the [http://webstore.iec.ch/preview/info_iec62220-1%7Bed1.0%7Den.pdf International Electrotechnical Commission] ([http://www.iec.ch/dyn/www/f?p=103:7:0::::FSP_ORG_ID,FSP_LANG_ID:1361,25 IEC]).  This had led to the commercial development of devices which can conveniently perform the necessary measurements, e.g. the [http://www.dqeinstruments.com/ DQEpro].

== Temporal Resolution ==

Temporal resolution expresses how quickly an image receptor can respond to a change in exposure and is a parameter of relevance only to fluoroscopic imaging.  Lag or image persistence (e.g. arising from incomplete readout of image signals) is generally an undesirable property of many photoconductive cameras. It can be seen as a blurring of the image whenever there is relative movement between the patient and the XII. It can also be seen as the finite time it takes for an image to build up following initiation of the X-ray exposure and to decay following termination of the exposure. 

[[File:pulsedProgressiveReadout.jpg|thumb|Fig. 6.19: Timing diagram for pulsed progressive readout of a video camera.]]

It does have the advantage of averaging statistical fluctuations to minimise the effects of mottle that normally occur with low dose fluoroscopy. Internal body structures can move with a velocity of 10-30 mm/s in X-ray examinations of the [[W:Gi_tract|gastrointestinal tract]] due to [[W:Peristalsis|peristalsis]]. In [[W:Cardiac|cardiac]] angiography the mean velocity of a [[W:Coronary_vessel|coronary vessel]] is typically  about 50 mm/s, while the peak velocity may exceed 100 mm/s. A typical vidicon camera tube might have 20% of the image signal remaining after three video frames and 5% remaining after as many as 10 frames - which would be totally useless in angiography applications, for instance. By contrast the lower lag of Plumbicon cameras, make them much more suitable for such application.  The magnitude of the lag can also be quite extensive in DR and approaches such as detector back-lighting can be applied to reduce the effects.

Pulsed progressive readout (PPR) of the video camera target can be used to minimise persistence effects. Here the conventional interlaced scanning of the target is replaced by a [[W:Progressive_scan|progressive scan]] where each video line is read sequentially. The sequence of events, see Figure 6.19, is as follows:
 
::*First, the exposure pulse is produced and the image accumulates on the target of the video camera. The target is blanked during this period, i.e. it is not scanned by the electron beam. 
::*Next, the target is scanned in a progressive fashion in a standard frame period and most of the image information is read off. This image information is fed to the digital image processor for subsequent processing. 
::*Finally, the target is read again in order to discharge the target of any residual image signals (lag) and to prepare the target for the next image. This latter scan is commonly referred to as a '''Scrub Frame'''.

The PPR mode of operation is also used because it allows video scanning to occur with independence from the duration of the radiation exposure. Such independence allows the application of exposure pulses of variable length - which gives some flexibility in the design of X-ray generators. 

Independence from image persistence effects allows the utilisation of the information from virtually all of the radiation exposure without any contributions from image build-up and decay effects. In addition, images of better spatial resolution have been obtained using the PPR mode. A disadvantage of the approach however is that, since two video frame periods are required for each image, the maximum frame rate for PPR exposures is about half that of continuous interlaced raster scanning.

== Image Quality Assessment ==

Image quality is a capacious term which can mean different things to different people.  For instance, a [[W:Radiologist#Radiologist_training|radiologist]] when viewing a radiograph may be interested primarily in the diagnostic value of an image, while a [[W:Radiographer|radiographer]] may focus on how well the image represents the anatomy and a [[W:Physicist|physicist]] may be interested in the contrast, resolution and noise properties&lt;ref&gt;&lt;small&gt;[http://www.icru.org/ ICRU], 1996. Medical Imaging - The Assessment of Image Quality. Report No. 54.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.  All have an interest nonetheless in keeping the patient's absorbed dose as low as reasonably achievable.

A physics perspective provides objective measures of image contrast, resolution and noise which can be used to compare the performance of different image receptors and different exposure techniques, for instance.  However, its apparent that such measurements on their own provide little  information of direct clinical value.  Furthermore, it is apparent that an absorbed dose measurement on its own provides little information regarding the value of an examination nor the physical image quality of the radiographs.

Given that there is a [[Basic_Physics_of_Digital_Radiography/The_Patient#Radiation_Biology|stochastic health risk]] from all X-ray examinations, it is reasonable to conclude that image quality should be assessed in conjunction with absorbed dose measurements so that the likely benefit to the patient can be determined relative to the health risk from the radiation exposure.

Various approaches are used for the assessment of image quality which include:

::*Physical measures of image quality as described above. These represent [[W:Objectivity_(science)|objective]] measurements and by their nature do not include the observer’s performance in the processes of image [[W:Perception|perception]] and analysis. As such, they indicate what can be achieved in ideal situations without the influence of [[W:Psychophysics|psychophysical]] factors of the observer and the detectability of lesions in complex projected anatomical backgrounds.

[[File:contrastDetailImage.jpg|thumb|Fig. 6.20: An image of a contrast-detail test phantom acquired using a fluoroscopy system.]]

::*[[W:Contrast_resolution|Contrast-detail]] evaluation combines physical indices of image quality with observer detection ability.  Contrast-detail [[W:Imaging_phantom|phantoms]] contain test objects of different sizes and subject contrast mounted on a plastic plate that is radiographed under specific exposure conditions - see Figure 6.20.  Contrast-detail plots are derived on the basis of the borderline visibility of test objects in the image.  A disadvantage of this approach however is the introduction of bias as a result of the observer's prior knowledge of the size, shape and location of the low-contrast objects.  The link between this type of evaluation and clinical imaging performance is therefore difficult to establish.

::*Anthropomorphic phantoms consist of anatomical models manufactured from synthetic materials representing various parts of the human body.  The synthetic materials have X-ray attenuation characteristics similar to that experienced clinically and subtle lesions can be simulated.  Images provide the ability to compare the influence of exposure factors and the use of different image receptors.  They have the advantage of being able to simulate clinical imaging conditions without irradiating patients. Phantoms can also be used for radiation dose measurements by placing small [[W:Thermoluminescent_Dosimeter|TLD]]s within their volume.  Their disadvantage however is that they lack the variations in patient anatomy experienced in the clinical environment with respect to body composition and anatomical backgrounds.

::*Detailed evaluation of patient images offers the most realistic method of image quality assessment. Patient images have the advantage of representing ''real world'' conditions. However there are numerous ethical considerations with the use of patients and their images in medical experiments.  Besides this feature, there is no reference standard to compare patient images against and, in many cases, no validation mechanism for the actual presence or absence of a lesion.  In addition, it is apparent that additional patient exposure is likely to be required in comparison studies.  Furthermore, a broad variation in lesion conspicuity generally does not exist in specific patient cohorts nor in ''[[W:Body_habitus#Body_habitus|body habitus]]'' demands on the imaging system.  Large numbers of patients and images have therefore to be included in such studies for statistical reasons.

:::Image quality assessment through [[W:Subjectivity|subjective]] scoring is widely used because of these constraints. In visual grading analysis, for instance, observers can subjectively grade the rendition of certain structures in images and score certain parameters on a decision scale with, for example, three or five levels.  Predefined decision levels are used, such as:

::::*the anatomical feature is detectable, but details are not fully reproduced,
::::*the details of anatomical structures are visible but not necessarily clearly defined, and 
::::*the anatomical detail is clearly defined in all respects.

[[File:ROC_general.svg|thumb|File 6.21: An interpretation of a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve as the degree of separation between two Gaussian distributions, where the perpendicular line marks the decision point. Positive diagnoses lie to the right of this line, while negative diagnoses lie to the left.  The decision point defines a point on the ROC curve.  See text for further details.]]

:::Image quality can also be assessed using descriptive statistics, e.g. [[W:Accuracy|accuracy]], [[W:Sensitivity_and_specificity|sensitivity and specificity]], with large patient cohorts and validated diagnoses.  Here, a [[W:Truth_table|truth table]] is constructed which details the number of true and false, positive and negative radiology interpretations - see Figure 6.21. Note that this perspective is similar to that adopted in the famous [[W:There_are_known_knowns|Known Knowns]] remark used in US politics!

:::[[W:Receiver_operating_characteristic|Receiver Operating Characteristic]] (ROC) curves can be derived from such cohort data. This method is based on [[W:Signal_detection_theory|signal detection theory]], where human observers score their level of confidence for their interpretations of the image data.  ROC curves are obtained by plotting the probability of true positive results against that of false positives.  A diagonal line is obtained in the case of random decisions and actual curves lie above this line.  Decision levels towards the extreme top right of the curve is referred to as ''Over-Reading'' while those close to the origin are referred to as ''Under-Reading''.  A major advantage of such data analysis is that it yields a single number - the area under the ROC curve - which describes the overall performance of a diagnostic system.  It should be appreciated, however, that ROC analysis requires the availability of a superior standard of truth, e.g. [[W:Biopsy|biopsy]] results, an adequate number of diseased and control subjects as well as a number of qualified observers.

Given this state of affairs, image quality studies that combine objective measurements with contrast-detail and/or visual grading analysis are used in many clinical evaluations.  Note that these evaluations do not take the whole diagnostic process into account and additional factors related to human perception, for instance, should also be considered&lt;ref&gt;&lt;small&gt;Krupinski EA, 2010. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20601701 Current perspectives in medical image perception]. Attention, Perception, &amp; Psychophysics, 72:1205-1217.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.  For objective measurements, it is apparent that DQE and dose data provide information about the physical imaging performance of image receptors and that this is just one contributor to the complete expression of image quality.  It is also apparent that visual-based image interpretation is subject to considerable sources of variability. These visually-derived indicators can be considered to result from at least two separate sources, one being the visual perception capability of the observer and the other being the clinical interpretation ability of that observer, in addition to the exact radiographic presentation of the patient's anatomy.  On this basis, it is clear that physical indicators of image quality provide an ability to compare the performance of different image receptors and exposure techniques ''in the lab'', and that the results of visual-based studies should be interpreted only as the performance of a particular diagnostic team in a specific clinical environment.

My name is Todd Tomasella and I was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, then spent 8 years in Alabama where God saved me out of a religious system. I have been living in the great state of Texas for 5 years now and love it.

From age zero I was taught to trust in the &quot;authority&quot; of my religion with it's dogmas, popes, priests and practices. When I heard the Gospel explained for the first time in my life from the Bible, I was quickened by the Holy Spirit to Jesus, &quot;who is the blessed and ONLY Potentate, the King of kings and Lord of lords.&quot; ( 1Timothy 6:15) That night my life was changed forever by the Lord's regenerating power as I chose to obey Him in repenting of my sins and receiving Christ as Lord of my life (Titus 3:5-6). He then baptized me with His Holy Ghost and has been changing my life every day since and I praise Him for His unspeakable gift of Christ the Lord.

After being saved for six months, I walked into a small independent Christian bookstore in a small town in north Alabama. A faithful pastor and his wife ran it as part of the church they pastored. After some acquaintance and chat, the pastor, who learned that I had been recently saved, asked me if I had been filled with the Holy Ghost. I told him exactly what the Ephesian believers stated in Acts 19:1-6. The dialogue went almost exactly like this:

Acts 19:2 KJV &quot;He said unto them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed? And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost.&quot;

I had simply never heard of being filled up with the Holy Spirit. The pastor then asked me if I would like to look into the Word with him and I agreed. We went to the back and sat down. He sat to my left, shoulder to shoulder, and took me on a tour of the New Testament doctrine of the baptism in the Holy Ghost (See Matthew 3:11). After studying about a dozen verses, he asked if I would like to &quot; receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.&quot; (Acts 2:37-39) I answered in the affirmative and we prayed to God for such. The Lord heard our prayer, as He promised for this specific request (Luke 11:11-13), and my life was changed again for ever. The baptism in the Spirit is a New Testament reality for all who are saved and for the whole dispensation of Grace (Acts 2:37-39). Divinely inspired boldness to witness and strength to live out the Christian life increased greatly as He led me in His path. But only if I abide in Him is this gift effectual (John 15:1-7; 1 Cor. 10:12). May God be praised. For more information on the Baptism in the Holy Ghost, see Holy Ghost Baptism

Not long after being apprehended by Him (saved), the Lord quickened me to record His Good News on paper and to start a Gospel tract ministry. I had no idea what a printing press even looked like. Well, over 2 million tracts later, the tract ministry is alive with the Jesus tract which is be utilized to win souls the world over. See Tracts

Blessings Upon You and Your Household in Jesus Christ,

todd tomasella - &quot;less than the least of all saints.&quot; Ephesians 3:8</text>

'''WATER CYCLE''' 

[[http://ramin.com.au/creekcare]]

Water is essential for all life on earth. About three billion years ago life began as small microscopic marine organisms. Nearly 300 million years ago primitive amphibians crawled out of their watery home on to dry land. Humans appeared about 1 million years ago. Since then our numbers have grown enormously and our way of life has had profound consequences for the water cycle, particularly in urban areas. 
The water cycle begins with water being evaporated by the sun mainly from the sea, which becomes vapour and forms into clouds. Some of the cloudy vapour blows inland where it falls as rain before eventually flowing back to the sea. 

'''Natural water cycle'''

[[http://tedfloyd.wordpress.com]]

	rain, hail, snow and fogs

	interception and evaporation from plant surfaces

	depression storage(puddles)

	runoff

	soil infiltration and percolation

	transpiration and evaporation

	water table and ground water

	creeks, brooks, rivers and lakes

	swamps, wetlands, billabongs and anabranches

	oceans, seas, harbours, bays and gulfs

The main source of fresh water is rainfall runoff which is widely used to meet human needs. Runoff is a vital part of long-term water supply and renews all water resources, be they rivers, lakes or reservoirs. 

Most plants living on land have roots buried in the soil and these plants absorb life-giving water from the soil. Nitrogen, phosphorus, calcium and many other essential plant nutrients are found in soils and are carried up into the stems and leaves by water. 

There is a continuous cycle of water on earth and the total amount remains close to a constant. The driving force is the sun evaporating water from the sea, lakes and pla&lt;big&gt;Big text&lt;/big&gt;nts. Water cycle in soils is especially important for the growth of plants. When rain falls onto the earth, water is absorbed by soils and excess water flows over the land into creeks and rivers. Water may evaporate from  soils or filter down through the soil to the water table. Plants absorb water from soils and the water is evaporated from leaves into the atmosphere, completing the soil water cycle.     

Every creek, river and lake is surrounded by a catchment and separating each catchment is a divide where water flows on the other side in the opposite direction into the neighboring catchment. The total catchment should be considered in water management schemes. When possible it is best if management schemes begin in the upper catchment.

'''Artificial water cycle'''
The urban water cycle in towns and cities differs from the natural water cycle in bushland. In cities the man made water cycle is an addition to the natural water cycle. The Artificial water cycle includes: town water supply, watering of parks and gardens, sewage system including the leakage of sewage into creeks and stormwater drains. Many suburban drains always have a water flow, even during long droughts because of artificial sources like excessive watering of gardens, washing cars and washing footpaths. 
In cities additional water is supplied to houses and industry by the town water system. Waste water is disposed of in the sewage system. The water catchment is altered and many creeks are converted to concrete lined drains.

'''Town Water Supply'''
Potable water is high quality water treated to remove harmful microorganisms and is distributed to houses where people can drink the healthy water.
Droughts are common in Australia and storage reservoirs need to be larger than many overseas cities. Sydney's reservoirs need to store more water than the total amount of water needed in several years.
Potable water supplied to town water systems is very valuable and should be used wisely. Large storage dams need to be built and valuable land is drowned under water. Town water supplies are treated and this costs money and uses energy.

'''Water harvesting'''
Town water should only be used when clean, healthy water is needed. A large proportion of water does not need treatment to health standards high enough for safe drinking.
Potable water is not needed for watering gardens or flushing toilets. Many industries do not need potable water.
The use of potable water directly from taps needs to be reduced and alternate water supplies should be utilized. Suburban water harvesting should be used when high quality potable water is not necessary for health reasons. Falling rain can be harvested directly in the suburbs and gardeners are now encouraged to install rainwater tanks.
Industry and Councils can save water by harvesting rainwater runoff for industrial purposes and irrigating parklands. 
Trees can be irrigated by water harvested from council stormwater drains. Well watered, fast growing trees will reduce floods and store carbon in a greenhouse sink.

'''Sewage systems'''
Water can leak from sewage pipes into natural drainage lines. Leakage of sewage can cause very serious pollution. Grey water is sewage consisting of water from kitchen, bathroom and laundry. Black water is water from toilets and is the most polluted form of sewage.
Water can leak from cracks in old dilapidated sewage pipes and during rainfall water can seep into sewagelines filling the pipes to capacity and forcing sewage to overflow from pipes into natural drainage lines.

'''Precipitation''' 
Precipitation is water falling from the atmosphere to the earth as rain, hail, snow, sleet, fog or dew.

When rain falls on the earth, it is first intercepted by vegetation which covers the land. A small proportion of the rain is evaporated directly from plant surfaces. Water is collected in the upper canopy of many tree species, flowing down the stems and trunk into the soil helping to improve water supply to trees surrounded by concrete and tar.

During rain, water is stored on the surfaces of leaves and stems. When it ceases to rain water will continue to drip from trees.  Leaf drip helps to even out the intensity of storms and may have a small effect on reducing flood peaks.

'''Evaporation'''

Failing rain is intercepted by vegetation. A small proportion of the rain is 
evaporated directly from the plants surfaces. Even during rainfall evaporation 
occurs, especially from tall trees. Studies on a south coast of NSW forest showed 15% 
of yearly rainfall was evaporated directly from the forest foliage.

With many tree species water is collected in the upper canopy and flows down the 
stems and eventually down the trunk into the soil. In many urban situations this 
process could be of major significance. The supply of water to the roots of a 
tree can be restricted by impermeable paving surrounding the tree. Water 
collected by the canopy and flowing down the trunk into the soil will help to 
increase water infiltration into the soil and to counter balance the restriction 
of water infiltration by impermeable paving.

During rain, water is stored on the surfaces of leaves and stems. When it ceases 
to rain water will continue to drip from a tree. This can help to even out a 
rainstorm and to reduce flood peaks.

An evaporimeter is used to measure the rate of evaporation directly 
fom a water surface. In Sydney the annual evaporation of 1800 mm is higher than 
rainfall, 1200 mm. The ratio between precipitation/evaporation is the P/E ratio 
and is a measure of the water available from rain for plant growth. In Sydney 
the annual P/E is 0.67.

The above data demonstrates evaporation is highly significant in Sydney. The 
climate in many cities in the world is different and evaporation is lower 
especially in the Northern cities of London and New York.

Water is also directly evaporated from surface soils into the atmosphere. 
Evaporation is faster from bare soils than protected soils. Mulches protect 
soils directly from sunlight and reduce water loss by evaporation. Mulches also 
insulate soils, keeping them cooler during summer months and reducing 
evaporation. Water evaporation from garden soils is a waste of water and in 
times of drought should be prevented.

'''Transpiration''' 

Growing plants transpire water into the atmosphere when they 
absorb large volumes of water from soils, which travels up the roots and stems 
to the leaves. Water evaporates into atmosphere through stomates, which are small pores in the 
leaf surface.

Water traveling up the stems transports minerals from soils up to the leaves 
where organic substances are manufactured for plant growth. Trees transpire 
large volumes of water. In Sydney a large gum tree transpires up to 200 liters 
of water on a sunny summer day.

Direct sunlight is the driving force of transpiration. Trees with a large leaf 
area transpire water quickly and high up in the canopy, winds blow moisture away 
encouraging faster transpiration. Native trees are evergreens and transpire 
water in all seasons, while very little transpiration occurs in deciduous trees 
during winter when they lose their leaves.

The rate of transpiration is proportional to the leaf area. Leaf 
area index (LAI) measures area of leaves and LAI equals 1 when the area of 
leaves equals land surface area. Trees have a large LAI, up to 6 and deep 
roots encouraging a high transpiration rate. Transpiration by plants helps to 
dry out soils. During rain, water will infiltrate more readily into a dry soil. 
The removal of water by transpiration allows more water to enter soils during 
rain and this will reduce water runoff and lower flooding.

The rate of transpiration is regulated by the total evaporation. Different 
plant species transpire at different rates. The ratio between 
transpiration/total evaporation is often called the crop factor and can be 
as high as 0.95 for lucerne in Jan(summer). Deciduous trees vary from 0.75 in Jan down 
to 0.1 in June (winter), when deciduous trees lose their leaves in winter.

Deep rooting plants have the ability to utilize water at greater depths in the 
soil. This enables these plants to grow and transpire when shallow rooting 
plants have wilted and ceased to transpire. Deep rooting plants generally have 
high crop factors. eg lucerne develops very deep roots and has a high crop 
factor.

Deep roots enhance transpiration. Many Australian native trees have very deep 
roots, up to 40 meters in favorable soils and often the roots of large trees 
reach down to the water table. During dry spells, surface soils dry out and 
native trees with deep roots continue to grow using water in the subsoil. This 
helps to make native trees drought resistant. In suburban Sydney the roots of 
trees sometimes penetrate into sewage pipes and are able to survive in the 
driest droughts.

The depth roots penetrate into a soil depends on the availability of water. If 
no available water is in the subsoil, plants develop a shallow root system. 
Frequent light watering encourages shallow roots while less frequent heavy 
watering ensures water penetrates deep into the subsoil and encourages growth of 
deep roots. Plants with deep roots are more drought tolerant.

Quick growing native trees have the ability to transpire 2-4 times more water in 
a year than the average annual rainfall.

Grasses have shallow roots. Annual grasses have very shallow roots often less 
than 0.5 meters deep. Permanent grasses have deeper roots and kikuyu roots can 
be as deep as 2.5 meters. Lawns with shallow rooted grasses need to be regularly 
watered at frequent intervals during hot summer weather. Many lawn grass species 
are not native to Australia and are not suited to hot dry summers and need to be 
watered regularly to be healthy and green. In drought prone Sydney water can be 
saved by replacing thirsty lawns with drought proof native species.

In certain situations the removal of trees has resulted in the rise of the water 
table. This has caused great problems when there is salt in the subsoil. A 
rising water table brings the salt to the surface and this can kill vegetation 
and in urban areas salt can cause damage to buildings.

The vegetation covering the land is a very important component of the water 
cycle. When vegetation is removed or reduced the checks and balances in the 
water cycle are disrupted. Trees are large, with deep roots having a major role 
in maintaining a balanced water cycle.

'''Stormwater'''
Water which does not infiltrate into soils becomes surface runoff which flows downhill eventually concentrating in rills, creeks and rivers. A small amount of water is trapped in puddles and becomes depression storage.

Undisturbed creeks meander through trees, bushes and grasses with flood plains waterholes, riffles and waterfalls. Swamps purify and store water. Aquatic plants and animals thrive in natural ecosystems. 

In urban areas, many original creeks are buried in pipes or bulldozed into straight concrete canals. Living native ecosystems disappear under the sterile drainage systems of the councils engineers. Fish have difficulty surviving in the polluted water.

Flash flooding is a problem in suburbs with concrete drains and where soils are covered with impermeable surfaces. Roads, buildings and other impermeable surfaces prevent water entering soils and all the water flows into stormwater drains. Natural drainage systems store water in swamps and flood plains reducing the severity of floods. Creeks have bends and meander through a valley slowing down the water velocity. 

A short time of concentration is another factor increasing flood peaks. The travel time from the most remote point of the catchment to the outlet is the time of concentration. In urban catchments water flows faster, the time of concentration is shorter and flood peaks higher, compared to rural or natural catchments

Water flowing in a concrete gutter flows about three times faster than in a grass waterway. Eco-designed waterways which meander increase length of the waterway and reduce the slope. Waterways incorporating natural features will reduce the velocity of water flow and reduce flood peaks.

Straight, concrete cannals are designed to swiftly drain water downhill away from upstream, flooded areas and can increase flooding downstream. Eco-designed drainage systems remove water slowly from flooded areas but reduce floods downstream. The design of drainage systems need to have a balance between these factors.   
 
Landform surrounding creek systems varies greatly, especially when the geology varies. In Sydney creeks running through areas of Hawkesbury Sandstone geology group, are found in narrow, rocky, steepsided valleys. The creeks flow swiftly along the steep gradient with riffle zones and small waterfalls. These creeks have small flood plains, few bends and do not meander.      

In Western Sydney many creeks meander through flat flood plains. On the Wianamatta Shale geology group, a common landform is gently undulating hills and creeks meandering through floodplains. Along the Nepean River valley there are extensive ancient floodplains dissected by creeks. 

Many new housing developments increase flash flooding when swamps and floodplains are filled in and built on. Culverts and bridges built in the earlier rural landscapes are now often too narrow and act as a dam during heavy rain, blocking the flow of creeks and causing flooding upstream. Stormwater is increased in new housing developments because of the extensive areas of impermeable buildings and road surfaces.

Water sensitive urban design is now used in new suburban developments. Houses, buildings, gardens and drainage systems are designed to reduce water wastage and stormwater flow.  Flooding can be reduced by reducing concrete paving, installing rainwater tanks and encouraging water infiltration into soils. Water detention basins temporarily hold and gradually release water after flood peaks. The severity of droughts can be reduced by harvesting stormwater and using the saved water in the home block.

'''Groundwater'''
Groundwater is found in saturated subsurface soils or rocks. The upper surface of groundwater is the water table. 

Leakage of excess water can occur down a soil profile beyond the root zone and into the groundwater. In urban areas impermeable surfaces reduce water reaching the groundwater. Cutting down trees decreases the removal of soil water by transpiration and the groundwater may rise. The groundwater can either rise or fall after urbanization.

Rainwater entering soils is returned to the atmosphere by evaporation and transpiration and excess water percolates down to the water table. The water table rises during rainy seasons or falls in dry periods.

When the water table comes to the surface a spring will form. The water table comes to the surface at rivers or lakes. The supply of ground water helps to keep rivers flowing when it is not raining. After heavy rain when the water table rises,  intermittent springs may form.

Many native gum trees have deep roots reaching down to the water table. During the severe drought of the early 2000's in Australia, the depth to the water table increased. Unfortunately many native trees died in country landscapes because of a lack of water and the inability of roots to reach down to deep water tables.  

The water table depth is equal to the depth down to the water surface in a well. A piezometer can be used to measure water table depth by drilling a small hole in the soil down to below the water table. The hole will fill up with water to the water table depth. Using two or more piezometers and measuring the difference in the water table between different  piezometers enables the direction of groundwater flow to be determined.

Salting occurs when salts in the subsoil are brought to the surface by a rising water table. Surface salting often kills plants and damage brick buildings. Salty subsoils are common in some parts of Western Sydney.



 
'''SOIL WATER''' 

'''Field Capacity'''
When a soil has drained freely for several days after rain or irrigation, the water content is the field capacity of the soil.

The field capacity is a measure of the soils ability to store water. A sandy soil freely drains and the field capacity is low. A clayey soil holds water and has a high field capacity. A clayey soil can store more water than a sandy soil.

Soil structure effects the field capacity. A structureless clay with no large pores has a very high field capacity. A well structured clay with large pores will drain freely and has a lower field capacity.

Organic matter can absorb water and increases field capacity.

The field capacity of a soil is mainly determined by the pore size distribution. Small pores hold water by capillary forces. Large pores freely drain and do not hold water at field capacity.


'''Wilting Point'''
When a soil is dry and plants suffer from permanent wilting because they are unable to absorb water, the moisture content is the wilting point of the soil.

When the moisture content is above the wilting point, plants can absorb water from the soil. Below the wilting point, water is tightly adsorbed to clay particles and is unavailable to plants.

Sandy soils have very low wilting points while clays have high wilting points. A clay contains a significant amount of water unavailable to plants.

'''Available Water'''
The amount of water stored by a soil that can be absorbed by a plant is the available water and is equal to the water held at the field capacity minus the wilting point.

The available water is the water stored by a soil and is useful to plants. Texture, structure and organic matter have an effect on the available water. Clayey soils generally have a hi
&lt;small&gt;#REDIRECT [[File:Urban flash floods.jpg]]
#REDIRECT [[Target page name]]&lt;/small&gt;gher available water than sandy soils. A well developed structure can increase the available water. Organic matter absorbs water and increases the available water.


Typical moisture properties of soils

 
Soil type         Field capacity         Wilting point                 Available water

Sand                      4.0%               1.3%                            2.7%

Loam                     25.5                12.2                            14.3

Clay                       34.3              16.5                            17.8

 

The available water stored in a soil is often measured as mm of water. Farmers prefer to sow a crop when there is sufficient water stored in the soil to ensure good plant growth. If the amount of stored water is low, the farmer needs to pray for rain. The amount of water available to plants also depends on the depth of the plant roots.


Water storage in soils

 

Available water                     mm water stored in 10 cm soil (soil bulk density 1.3 g/cc)

                  3%                                    2.3mm

                 10%                                   7.7

                 15%                                    11.5

Soluble salts in soils reduces the availability of water to plants. Salt increases the osmotic pressure of water. High salt content in soils will kill plants.


'''Depth of plant roots'''
Plants with deep roots can tap a larger reservoir of water are more drought resistant. Plants with a shallow root system can only absorb water from the surface soil and are more susceptible to droughts.

When irrigating enough water should only be applied to wet the soil to a depth slightly deeper than the root zone of the plants. Excess water will drain to a depth below the roots and will not be available to plants.

Roots do not penetrate into dry soils. When watering plants sufficient water should be applied so the water wets the soil to a depth a little greater than the root depth. Plant roots should be encouraged to grow deep roots and to help drought proof the plants.

'''Crop Root depth''' Grass

Pastures 0.6 metres               Kikuyu 2.4m

Sorghum 2                         Paspalum 1.5

Lucerne 6 or more metres          Couch 1.5

Wheat, Oates, Barley 3.3          Buffalo 1.0

Maize 1 to 2                      Kentucky bluegrass 0.4

Lettuce 0.1 to 0.2

Fruit trees 0.6 to 1.3

Gum trees up to 40m





'''SOIL WATER INFILTRATION'''

It is well known that urban development increases flooding. In urban areas the coefficient of runoff increases, and the time of concentration decreases. The coefficient of runoff in undisturbed areas can be as low as 0.1, while in inner city suburbs, coefficient of runoff can be as high as 0.9.

During rainfall a high value of coefficient of runoff occurs when most rainfall flows over the land and little water is absorbed by soils. When all the rain flows over the surface and no rain infiltrates into the soil the coefficient of runoff equals 1. If a high volume of water enters the soil the coefficient of runoff is small and approaches 0. 

The main source of fresh water is rainfall runoff, which is widely used to meet human needs. Runoff is a vital part of long term water supply and renews water resources be they rivers, lakes or reservoirs. Plants need water to grow and evapotranspiration by plants returns water from the soil into the atmosphere.

'''Rate of water infiltration'''
The rate at which water enters the soil during rain or irrigation is the infiltration rate.

When rain first enters a dry soil, infiltration is rapid, then decreases as it continues to rain. During the early stages of rainfall, water fills up the dry pores. When the pores are filled with water and the soil is saturated, infiltration slows down until it reaches a constant value.

When it has stopped raining, the surface soil will be saturated with water. Free water in a saturated soil will drain under gravity. After about 2 3 days, free water will have percolated downwards and the soil moisture will reach an equilibrium. When the free water has drained downwards, the moisture is at 'field capacity'.

At field capacity, soil water is held in the soil by several forces. The major part of the water is held by capillary forces. Some water is adsorbed onto the surfaces of soil particles, especially clay particles and organic matter.

Capillary water is the main supply of water to plants. Capillary water may be removed by transpiration by plants and evaporation. If the top soil is dry and the underlying soil is wet, water can move upwards by capillary action.

Above the water table there is a capillary fringe. Water moves upwards from the water table by Capillary forces. In some. soils, especially clays which contain many fine pores, the capillary fringe can be up to one metre above the water table.

During rain the infiltration rate slows down as the soil becomes wet.

Infiltration rates vary greatly between different soils, and typical values are, 100mm/hour during the first hour of rain, decreasing to 10mm/hr after six hours of rain. (figure 2 and table 4)

Peds are small aggregates (1  2mrn ) found in many soils. Pedal soils have a good structure and water flows easily through these soils. Apedal soils have a poor structure and apedal clayey soils have poor water infiltration. Sandy soils generally have high water infiltration and clayey soils have low infiltration rates.

If the intensity of rainfall is constant, and infiltration decreases at a typical rate, there is no runoff during the early stages of the rain event. When the infiltration rate is slower than the rainfall intensity, runoff is expected to occur.

Infiltration rate is controlled by the soil layer which has the lowest hydraulic conductivity. Often the top soil is a loam and has a high hydraulic conductivity. A clayey subsoil with a low hydraulic conductivity will act as a throttle, slowing down the final infiltration rate.

In the field, infiltration can be directly measured using a ring infiltrometer. (Black 1965) A circular tube is forced into the soil, which is ponded with water. At specific time intervals, rate of water flow into the soil is recorded. To reduce variability, the rings need to be fairly large, generally rings should be bigger than 112 meter in diameter. Often a double ring infiltrometer is used to reduce errors from lateral water movement. Variability in these experiments is often high, so it is advisable to carry out a number of replicates.

It is common in many soils for the infiltration rate to decrease by a factor of ten, after six hours of rain. A steady state equilibrium is usually reached before six hours. Infiltration rates vary greatly between different soils, and typical values are, 10Omm/hour during the first hour of rain, decreasing to 1 mm/hr after six hours of rain. (figure 1 and table 1)

'''Improving Water Infiltration'''

It infiltration is improved and more water penetrates into the soil, surface runoff is decreased and flooding is reduced.

For rapid infiltration the soil needs large pores which are connected vertically. Large pores are numerous in soils which have a well developed structure and stable aggregates.

The soil surface should be protected from the impact of raindrops. The force of falling raindrops is very high which can dislodge soil particles, breaking down structure and forming a puddle on the soil surface. When the soil is puddled, infiltration is low and when the surface drys, a crust will form. Vigorous plant growth protects the surface soil from raindrops. Mulches also help to protect surface soils. Excessive cultivation which break$ down the surface structure, will increase puddling during rain. Leaving large clods on the surface when cultivating, will reduce puddling. if a soil is cultivated when it is very wet, puddling often occurs during cultivation.

Vigorous plant growth helps to improve infiltration. Plant roots bind soil particles together into aggregates. Deep rooting plants increase infiltration into the subsoil. Decaying organic matter also improves structure. Organic matter can be added by using mulches, green manures and composts.

Earthworms are well known for improving soil fertility by creating a good structure, which is highly permeable. Other soil animals can help permeability. Micro organisms are very important in breaking down organic matter into substances which bind soil particles. Filamentous micro organisms are a powerful bonding force and many fungi help form a stable structure. Soil organisms need a supply of decaying plant material to feed on. Many modern gardening practices are harmful to soil organisms. Earthworms are harmed by many insecticides, fungicides and herbicides. Some fertilisers change the soil pH, which can be harmful to earthworms and micro organisms.

Compaction decreases infiltration. Inappropriate ploughing has produced plough pans in many farming soils. Heavy traffic, people or vehicles can cause compaction. Often it is best to form a path or road, so as to limit the area effected by compaction. Compaction in a garden can be relieved by cultivation or by inserting a fork and wobbling it.

For large expanses of lawn and turf, many special management techniques have been used. In special cases, an artificial soil can be created, consisting of sand overlaying gravel and drainage pipes. This may be necessary on first class sporting fields where vigorous grass growth is required and the field needs to be dry on sporting days.

Different types of machines have been used to re vigorate turf. Infiltration into turfs can be increased by: coring, spiking, 'Verti Draining', 'HydroJecting', grooving and slicing/slotting.

Soil ameliorates can be used to improve structure. In clayey soils which have a high exchangeable sodium %, the application of gypsum will improve structure. On the market there is a number of patented soil conditioners used to improve infiltration. The benefit of these products can vary greatly between products and under different conditions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Given any point P and a line not passing through P, the '''reflection of P in that line''' is defined as follows:

* Draw the perpendicular from P to the line; let it meet the line at O.
* Extend the perpendicular to the other side of the line.
* Let OQ equal OP in length.
* Then Q is the reflection.

If the line passes through P, then P is its own reflection in that line.

      <comment>/* Stack segment */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==INTRODUCTION==
In the followings we will consider a C simple example to have an idea how the memory is managed while an application is running. 
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
   //
   // globals -&gt; global segment (A5)
   //
   int intVar;
   long longVar;
   char charArray[20];
   //
   // Sum procedure -&gt; code segment (PC)
   //
   int Sum(int op1, int op2)
   {
      int res; // local variable -&gt; frame stack segment (A6)
      res = op1 + op2;
      return res;
   }
   //
   // Pilot Main function -&gt; code segment (PC)
   //
   unsigned long PilotMain
     (unsigned int cmd, void *cmdPBP, unsigned int launchFlags)
   {
      int operand1, operand2, result; // local variables-&gt; frame stack segment (A6)
      char string[8];                 // local variables-&gt; frame stack segment (A6)
      StrCopy(&quot;abcdefgh&quot;, string);    // &quot;abcdefgh&quot;, constant -&gt; code segment (PC)
      operand1 = 1;
      operand2 = 10;
      result = Sum(operand1, operand2);
      return result;
   }
&lt;/source&gt;
It is a good idea to read the section [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/User:Doruletz72/ONBA/Overview#RUNNING_AN_APPLICATION Running an application] first, if don't read it yet. Also, if you are eager to test your skills you can start OnbA. Follow the instructions from [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/User:Doruletz72/ONBA/Onboard_Assembler STARTING OnbA].
===Global segment===
First will refer the global variables. As I said before, all variables outside of the procedures forms the '''globals'''. They are stored inside of the DATA record in the PRC file. When application is started, it creates a portion of memory called GLOBAL SEGMENT.
[[File:Onba06.JPG|Onba01|left|alt=A]]
The base address of this segment is saved into register A5. So if you want to use this register for other purpose save its value (push it on the stack), then restore it after use. As you can see in the picture the variables are stored in backward order as they are declared in code. To use a global variable you must specify a value of offset relative to A5, where is stored the base address. These values are always negative numbers. Address modes used to do this are indirect address using register with index or with displacement.
&lt;br /&gt;
Unfortunately, the disassembler programs usually not disassembles the DATA segment. Under OnbA to declare global variables you must &quot;instruct&quot; Onba to switch in &quot;data mode&quot; its output, i.e. OnbA will write inside the DATA record of the PRC file.
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
   data ; instruct OnbA to switch to data mode
   intVar dc.w  0 
   longVar dc.l 0
   charArray dc.20 0
&lt;/source&gt;
To access the global variables OnbA allow you to use two modes:
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
   ; easy way to access variables
   move.w intVar(a5), d0
   move.l longVar(a5), d0
   ; hard a bit, this is what you will see into disassembled source
   move.w -26(a5), d0
   move.l -24(a5), d0
&lt;/source&gt;
The two modes are equals, because in fact OnbA will replace &quot;numeric labels&quot; with proper values into binary code. But when you disassemble the binary code there are no more &quot;numeric labels&quot;, so you must understand this mode of global variables organization in memory.

===Stack segment===
The STACK SEGMENT it is a little bit complicated than GLOBAL SEGMENT. This segment is created based on size stored in CODE 0 record of the PRC file. It holds the local variables - the variables inside of the procedures - and the intermediate values such parameters to be passed to a procedure or a system function at the moment of the call, values of the register pushed to the stack when situation demands.
[[File:Onba07.JPG|Onba01|left|alt=A]]
SP (A7) register keeps the current top pointer of the program stack. When a procedure/system function is called, the parameters are push it on the program stack (stack grows), along with PC register value (instructions pointer) and the current A6 register value (frame stack pointer). After that, the execution of the program will be continued with effective call of the procedure: creating a local stack frame (A6 hold the base address of this stack) and running of the instructions inside of the procedures.
&lt;br /&gt;
We can see in the picture the moment of PilotMain() initialization, when is created a local stack frame with the local variables. To access local variables of the PilotMain() we will proceed in the same way how we handled the GLOBAL SEGMENT. But now will use A6 register as reference:
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
   move.w #1, operand1(a6)  ; operand1 = 1
   move.w #10, operand2(a6) ; operand2 = 10
   ; or
   move.w #1, -2(a6)
   move.w #10, -4(a6)   
&lt;/source&gt;
Let see the next, the call of the OS system function StrCopy:
[[File:Onba08.JPG|Onba01|left|alt=A]]
The stack is increased, the parameters - string and &quot;abcdefgh&quot; addresses - , PC register value (the current instruction pointer),  status registers SR and the values of the A6 register (containing the PilotMain frame stack value) are pushed on the stack. System function StrCopy is a black box for us, but mainly the things are going in the same way like to the procedures call (see bellow).
&lt;br /&gt;
Part of this push process is not visible, but is done it by the TRAP instruction: it pushes PC, SR and A6, then it restores PC, SR and A6. And of course additionally stack management, too. SP contains now a new top stack value.
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
   pea string(a6)      ; push local variable &lt;ea&gt;, increases stack += 4
   pea stringParam(pc) ; push constant value &lt;ea&gt;, increases stack += 4
   trap #15             ; call OS API
   dc.w $A0C5           ; invoke StrCopy
   addq.l #8, sp        ; decreases stack -= 8
   ; or
   pea -14(a6)
   pea 48(pc)
   ...
&lt;/source&gt;
After the call of StrCopy, the variable '''string''' contains value &quot;abcdefgh&quot;. The value of PC, SR and A6 are restored and the stack is decreased. The SP contains now the old top stack value before calling of StrCopy. A6 register contains now the PilotMain frame stack reference so we can access the PilotMain local variable using A6 (see first picture).
&lt;br /&gt;
The next C code lines initialize the values of the operand1 and operand2. 
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
   move.w #1, operand1(a6)  ; operand1 = 1
   move.w #10, operand2(a6) ; operand2 = 10
   ; or
   move.w #1, -2(a6)
   move.w #10, -4(a6) 
&lt;/source&gt;
The values of Sum() parameters, operand1 and operand2 is pushed on the stack.  The procedure '''Sum()''' is called. 
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
   move.w operand2(a6), -(sp) ; push operand2 value on the stack, increases stack += 2
   move.w operand1(a6), -(sp) ; push operand1 value on the stack, increases stack += 2
   jsr Sum(pc)                ; jump to the procedure Sum()
   addq.l #4, sp              ; decreases stack -= 4 
   ; or
   move.w -4(a6), -(sp)
   move.w -2(a6), -(sp)
   jsr $ffc0(pc)
   ...
&lt;/source&gt;
[[File:Onba10.JPG|Onba01|left|alt=A]]
At this moment a new frame stack is created for Sum() procedure using A6 as reference register. The local variable '''res''' can be access through A6. As you can see by now the register SP is used only for stack management. If you want use SP register for other purpose, create a variable or use another register to save it, because SP cannot be pushed by itself on stack and then used. If you do this you will lose any reference to the top of the stack. So save it before.
&lt;br /&gt;
The assembly code of the Sum() procedures:
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
   ; OnbA source
   proc Sum(op1.w, op2.w)
   local res.w
   beginproc
      move.w op1(a6), d0 ; load op1 to D0 register
      add.w op2(a6), d0  ; add op2 to D0
      move.w d0, res(a6) ; res = op1 + op2
      move.w res(a6), d0 ; return res
   endproc
   ; or disassembled source
   ; this code start at address $ffc0 referred by PC
   link a6, #-2      ; save A6 on stack, allocate 2 bytes for local
   move.w 8(a6), d0  ; load op1 to D0 register
   add.w 10(a6), d0  ; add op2 to D0
   move.w d0, -2(a6) ; res = op1 + op2
   move.w -2(a6), d0 ; return res
   unlk a6           ; free local stack, restore A6
   rts               ; restore PC (jump back)
&lt;/source&gt;
Inside the Sum() procedure, the parameters op1, op2 which are pushed on the stack, are referred using positive values, starting with offset 8. This &quot;inversion&quot; is normally because stack segment is backward addressed, from higher addresses to lower addresses. So when when &quot;look in front&quot;, in fact you increase the negative absolute value, and when you try to &quot;look back&quot; you decrease the negative value. Because A6 is the reference, &quot;inside&quot; procedure means negative values, and before procedure means positive values. The offset of 8, between start of the procedure frame stack and its parameters, represents 4 bytes value of PC pushed by JSR instruction and 4 bytes value of old A6 pushed by LINK instruction when the procedure frame stack is created. The UNLK instruction restore the old A6 register value, and the RTS restore the PC old value.
We will insist no more here. Just I hope you now understand a little bit more the STACK SEGMENT internals.

===Code segment===
By now you saw some references to PC register, which hold the pointer of the current instruction. Only one thing to discuss: the reference to &quot;abcdefgh&quot; constant. The local constant are the only written inside the CODE SEGMENT (in fact record). You can declare constant anywhere inside your program using '''&lt;constant_name&gt; dc.b &quot;value&quot; ''' directive. OnbA will translate all string (array of chars) constants passed to functions/procedures after the end of current procedure body. You can do the same:
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
   procedure Example()
   beginproc
     ... ExampleStr(pc) ; reference of the constant
   endproc
   ExampleStr dc.b &quot;aadsdaddsd&quot;
   ;
   ;disassembled code
   ;
   link a6, #0
   ....
   unlk a6
   rts
   dc.b &quot;aadsdaddsd&quot;
   dc.w 0
&lt;/source&gt;
&quot;dc.w 0&quot; means that OnbA automatically adds '\0' terminator string and an addtional '\0', if situation demands, to keep word alignment of code.
&lt;br /&gt;
The entire equivalent OnbA source using all directives (easy way):

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
   prc &quot;WikiExample&quot;
   creator &quot;Doru&quot;
   ; put OnbA on data mode
   data
   intVar dc.w  0 
   longVar dc.l 0
   charArray dc.20 0
   ; put OnbA on code mode
   code
   ; some equ
   StrCopy equ $A0C5
   ;
   ; procedure Sum
   ;
   proc Sum(op1.w, op2.w)
   local res.w
   beginproc
      move.w op1(a6), d0
      add.w op2(a6), d0
      move.w d0, res(a6)
      move.w res(a6), d0
   endproc
   ;
   ; procedure PilotMain
   ;
   proc PilotMain_00(cmd.w, cmdPBP.l, launchFlags.w)
   local operand1.w
   local operand2.w
   local result.w
   local string.8
   beginproc
      systrap StrCopy(&amp;stringValue(pc).l, &amp;string(a6).l)
      move.w #1, operand1(a6)
      move.w #10, operand2(a6)
      call Sum(operand1(a6).w, operand2(a6).w)
      move.w d0, result(a6)
      move.w result(a6), d0
   endproc
   stringValue dc.b &quot;abcdefgh&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;
The entire equivalent OnbA source without using of '''systrap''' and '''call''' directives (harder way):
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
   prc &quot;WikiExample&quot;
   creator &quot;Doru&quot;
   ; put OnbA on data mode
   data
   intVar dc.w  0 
   longVar dc.l 0
   charArray dc.20 0
   ; put OnbA on code mode
   code
   ;
   ; procedure Sum
   ;
   Sum
      link a6, #-2
      move.w 8(a6), d0
      move.w 10(a6), d0
      move.w d0, -2(a6)
      move.w -2(a6), d0
      unlk a6
      rts
   ;
   ; procedure PilotMain
   ;
   proc PilotMain_00(cmd.w, cmdPBP.l, launchFlags.w)
   local operand1.w
   local operand2.w
   local result .w
   local string.8
   beginproc
      pea string(a6)
      pea stringValue(pc)
      trap #15
      dc.w $A0C5 ; StrCopy
      addq.l #8, sp
      move.w #1, -2(a6)
      move.w #10, -4(a6)
      move.w -4(a6), -(sp)
      move.w -2(a6), -(sp)
      jsr Sum(pc)
      addq.l #4, sp 
      move.w d0, result(a6)
      move.w result(a6), d0
   endproc
   stringValue dc.b &quot;abcdefgh&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

==VARIABLES==
*The variables types supported by OnbA are the '''byte''', '''word''' (2 bytes) and '''long''' (4 bytes), both '''signed''' and '''unsigned'''. The only difference between a signed and unsigned types is how is interpreted the most signifiant bit (MSBi) as a sign or as a value. If is a '''sign''' the range of value is symmetrical disposed around value 0, from '''- max_value / 2''' to '''+ max_value / 2 - 1'''. If bit is a '''value''', range is between 0 and '''max_value - 1'''. It is up to you, but check the supported type when you invoke an instruction or the correct type when call an OS function.
*The values stored to registers or variables, can be pure values or pointers. Again it is up to you to decide this, and to use the properly instructions to manipulate them. Take care when you move a value to an address register, it will be automatically signed. 
Now we iterate the knowledge enumerated in above examples:
* use '''registers''' as often as you can instead of global or local variables. The instructions are designed to work with them.
* '''global variables''' are referred by A5 register; to declare put OnbA on data mode; use directive '''dc.SIZE''', SIZE = .b, .w, .l or .&lt;VALUE&gt;; to access them you must be in code mode.
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
   ; put OnbA on data mode, is mandatory
   ; do this at the begining of your file
   ; for a single time
   data
   ; declaration name dc.SIZE init_value
   varByte dc.b 'a'        ; a byte, initialized with 'a'
   varWord dc.w 120        ; a word value, initialized with 120
   varWord1 dc.2 120       ; equivalent with previous variable
   varLong dc.l 0          ; a long value, initialized with 0
   varArray dc.24 0        ; an array variable of 24 bytes, initialized with 0
   ...
   ; access the global variables, using A5 register
   ; you must be in code mode!!!!
   ; so put OnbA on code mode 
   code 
   ...
   move.b varByte(a5), d0 ; copy byte value stored in varByte to D0
   pea varWord(a5)        ; push to the stack the address of the varWord variable
   move.l d0, varLong(a5) ; copy the entire value D0 (all 4 bytes) to varLong variable
&lt;/source&gt;
* '''local variables''' are referred by register A6 (you can use a different address register if you want, but OnbA directives use only A6 register); to declare use directive '''local name.SIZE'''; the &quot;local&quot; directive is valid only between directives '''proc''' and  the next '''beginproc'''.
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
   proc ExampleProc()
   ; declaring local variables
   local var1.w
   local var2.l
   local var3.20
   beginproc
      ...
      ; accessing local variables
      move.w var1(a6), d1    ; copy word value stored in var1 to register D1
      move.l #1000, var2(a6) ; var2 = 1000
      pea var3(a6)           ; push on the stack the address of var3
      ...
   endproc
&lt;/source&gt;
*'''Note:''' - at the assembly time, OnbA will replace the labels of the global or local variables with the proper numeric value.
===Arrays===
Here start the ugly part of the OnbA. It don't have proper support for arrays. There are no simple &quot;ways&quot; or directives to access array's elements. But let's take the good part, in this hard way you will understand the assembly language better.
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
void ExampleProc(void)
{
  long array[20];
  array[15] = 1000;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
Simple in C, isn't it?
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
   proc ExampleProc()
   local array.80 ; 20 * 4 bytes
   beginproc
      lea array(a6), a0         ; a0 = &amp;array
      moveq #15, d0             ; d0 = 15
      lsl.w #2, d0              ; d0 = d0 &lt;&lt; 2, d0 = 15 * 4
      move.l #1000, 0(a0, d0.w) ; &amp;(a0 + d0) = 1000 
   endproc
&lt;/source&gt;
In fact it doesn't matter how simple it looks in C or C++ or C#, finally it is only a matter how simple it looks in assembly code. Because the processor don't run the C code, but the assembly code. Let's parse the example. First of all to access an array's element we need to access the address of it, address of the first element, and calculate then the offset of the desired element, using element's size and index. First instruction, LEA, loads effective address of the arrays in register address A0. You can choose other address register if you wish. Then, we must compute the offset relative to this address. In this case, size of the elements is size of long (4 bytes), so the offset is 15*4. Both instructions used to compute this value are the fastest possible. MOVEQ is faster then classically MOVE, and LSL &lt;&lt; 2 (logical shift left) is faster than MUL * 4. These aspects are very important, because  accessing and using array's elements are very common inside of program source. The last instruction is a special type of address mode. Value 1000 is copied to the location pointed by base address stored in A0 shifted with the value of index stored in D0, and with value of the offset, 0 in this case. Perhaps is time to read more about [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/User:Doruletz72/ONBA/Address_Modes#Address_register_with_index_.28d8.2C_An.2C_Xi.29 address modes].
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
void ExampleProc(void)
{
  int *array;              // a pointer to an array of 20 int elements 
  int i                  // index variable
  array = MemPtrNew(40);   // dynamic memory allocation
  for(i = 0; i &lt; 20 ; i++) // initialization loop
   array[i] = i;
  MemPtrFree(array);       // free the memory
}
&lt;/source&gt;
In this example we use a pointer to an array instead of a static array, i.e. the allocated memory is in the DYNAMICALLY SEGMENT, so we keep a low size for the program stack. For simplicity there is no safe code to check if the allocation was succeeded.
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
   proc ExampleProc()
   local array.l  ; pointer (4 bytes)
   local i.w      ; don't use byte, use word at least
   beginproc
      systrap MemPtrNew(#40.l)  ; alloc memory, 20*2 bytes
      move.l a0, array(a6)      ; get the address of the memory location
      clr.w i(a6)               ; i = 0
      FOR_LOOP                     ; start loop label
         movea array(a6), a0       ; load base array address to A0
         move.w i(a6), d0          ; get crt index
         add.w d0, d0              ; calculate offset, i*2
         move.w i(a6), 0(a0, d0.w) ; array[a0+d0] = i
         addq.w #1, i(a6)          ; i ++
         cmpi.w #20, i(a6)         ; compare i with 20
         blt FOR_LOOP              ; if i &lt; 20, branch to FOR_LOOP 
      systrap MemPtrFree(array(a6).l) ; free memory
   endproc
&lt;/source&gt;
Now our local '''array''' variable is a pointer, an address of memory. So instead of LEA, we need only the MOVEA (move address) to load the base array address to the base register A0. In case of addresses we can use MOVEA instead of simple MOVE (don't ever use MOVEA with data registers). To calculate the offset, &quot;add &lt;register&gt;, &lt;register&gt;&quot; is faster than &quot;lsl 1, &lt;register&gt;&quot;. Last time we used LSL &lt;&lt; 2 instead of slower MUL * 4. Now we could do better. Results are the same in all cases, but you will save hundred of microseconds at the execution time. So your code is faster. The code is a simple disassembly of the C source compiled under Onboard C. Now we can understand why is good to &quot;know&quot; assembly language. The example can be improved, because the algorithm created by Onboard C is not the best, is only the safest. 
&lt;br /&gt;
Inside the for loop, first instruction &quot;movea array(a6), a0&quot; is looped on each iteration. And is not need for this. The value in register A0 is not altered, and there is no system functions calls inside the loop (system calls alters the contain of the registers), so it no need to refresh data in A0. We can move it outer. Why use only 2 neurons/registers of the processor, A0 and D0? Onboard C not allows register variables, I know, but here we can do this. So instead of local variable &quot;i&quot;, we will use another available data register, D1 by example. Don't forget registers are faster. 
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
   proc ExampleProc()
   local array.l  ; pointer (4 bytes)
   beginproc
      systrap MemPtrNew(#40.l)  ; alloc memory, 20*2 bytes
      move.l a0, array(a6)      ; get the address of the memory location
      clr.w d1                  ; d1 = 0, our new index
      movea array(a6), a0       ; load base array address
      FOR_LOOP                     ; start loop label
         move.w d1, d0             ; get crt index
         add.w d0, d0              ; calculate offset, d1*2
         move.w d1, 0(a0, d0.w)    ; array[a0+d0] = d1 
         addq.w  #1, d1            ; d1 ++
         cmpi.w #20, d1            ; compare d1 with 20
         blt FOR_LOOP              ; if d1 &lt; 20, branch to FOR_LOOP 
      systrap MemPtrFree(array(a6).l) ; free memory
   endproc
&lt;/source&gt;
So faster algorithm because less instructions and fasters. Now another example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
void ExampleProc(void)
{
  int array0[10], array1[10]; // 2 arrays of 10 int elements 
  int i;                      // index variable
  for(i = 0; i &lt; 10 ; i++)    // initialization loop
     {
        array0[i] = i;
        array1[i] = array0[i]*2; // array1[i] = 2*i in fact
     }
}
&lt;/source&gt;
And an optimized version of assembly code:
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
   proc ExampleProc()
   local array1.20 ; 10 * 2 bytes
   local array2.20 ; 
   beginproc
      lea array(a6), a0         ; a0 = &amp;array0
      lea array(a6), a1         ; a1 = &amp;array1
      clr.w d1                  ; index d1 = 0,
      FOR_LOOP                     ; start loop label
         move.w d1, d0             ; get crt index
         add.w d0, d0              ; calculate offset, d1*2
         move.w d1, 0(a0, d0.w)    ; array0[a0+d0] = d1 
         move.w d0, 0(a1, d0.w)    ; array1[a1+d0] = d0, d0 = 2*d1
         addq.w  #1, d1            ; d1 ++
         cmpi.w #10, d1            ; compare d1 with 10
         blt FOR_LOOP              ; if d1 &lt; 10, branch to FOR_LOOP 
   endproc
&lt;/source&gt;
You can't do this under Onboard C, but here you will do. For arrays of chars or strings  I will show another type of address mode:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
   void ExampleProc(void)
   {
      char String[40];
      int i;
      for(i = 0; i&lt; 40; i++)
       String[i] = i + 50;
   }
&lt;/source&gt;
This source is built by me, because Onboard C uses same type of address mode (d8,An,Xi). Here is the [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/User:Doruletz72/ONBA/Address_Modes#Address_register_with_postincrement_.28An.29.2B (An)+ address mode], indirect address register with post-increment. First will use the address in A0 for our interest, then the address is incremented with size of the operand, in this case size of byte, 1.
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
   proc ExampleProc()
   local String.40 ; 40 bytes
   beginproc
      lea String(a6), a0        ; a0 = &amp;String
      clr.w d0                  ; index d0 = 0,
      FOR_LOOP                     ; start loop label
         move.w d0, d1             ; d1 = d0
         addq.w #50, d1            ; d1 = d1 + 50
         move.b d1, (a0)+          ; String[a0] = d1, 
                                   ; then a0 = a0 + 1 (size of byte operand)
         addq.w  #1, d0            ; d0 ++
         cmpi.w #40, d0            ; compare d0 with 40
         blt FOR_LOOP              ; if d0 &lt; 40, branch to FOR_LOOP 
   endproc
&lt;/source&gt;
In conclusion, use faster instruction when you calculate the offset of an element:
:* '''moveq''' and '''lsl''' for arrays of '''long'''
:* '''add &lt;Dn&gt;, &lt;Dn&gt;''' instead of '''lsl''' for arrays of '''word'''
:* try '''(An)+''' address mode for arrays of '''byte'''

===Structures===
Here start the very, very ugly part of the OnbA. It don't have proper support for structures. No directives to access structure's elements. Even the &quot;equ&quot; directive is wrong implemented, and is working only in few cases. So you can't use some suggestive way to represent members of a structure. The only way is to use a lot of comments, or to avoid to use structures. Let's consider the following example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
   typedef struct{
      int member1;
      long member2;
      char member3[10];
      }MyStruct; // size of the structure 2 + 4 + 10
   //
   void ExampleProc(void)
   {
      MyStruct mys;
      mys.member1 = 10;
      mys.member2 = 1000;
      mys.member3[5] = 'a';
   }
&lt;/source&gt;
Assembly code built by OnbA:
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
   proc ExampleProc()
   local mys.16 
   beginproc
      lea mys(a6), a0 ; a0 = &amp;mys = &amp;first member
      move.w #10, a0  ; mys[a0] = 10
      lea mys(a6), a0     ; a0 = &amp;mys
      move.l #1000, 2(a0) ; mys[a0+2] = 1000
      lea mys(a6), a0         ; a0 = &amp;mys
      lea 6(a0), a0           ; a0 = a0 + 6 = &amp;mys + 6 = &amp;mys.member3
      moveq.l #5, d0          ; index of member3
      move.b #97, 0(a0, d0.w) ; mys.member3[d0] = 97, 'a'
   endproc
&lt;/source&gt;
Ugly, very ugly. An idea is to insert comment to have a clear view of your structure. Anyway, when use Onboard C you instruct first the compiler how the structure it looks. So you can proceed in the same manner, but to instruct yourself how the structure looks. A optimized source code for previous example: 
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
; MyStruct map offset
; 0 member1, int
; 2 member2, long
; 6 + i, member3[10], char
; 16, size
   proc ExampleProc()
   local mys.16
   beginproc
      lea mys(a6), a0     ; base address of mys
      move.w #10, (a0)    ; copy word #10 at address in A0 + 0, member1
      move.l #1000, 2(a0) ; copy long #1000 at address in A0 + 2, member2
      move.b #97, 11(a0)  ; copy byte #97 at address in A0 + 6 + 5, member3[5]
   endproc
&lt;/source&gt;
You can structure your comment as you consider is better, to easy see the offsets of the members. Normally you could use the &quot;equ&quot; directive to replace numerical offset with suggestive labels, but is not works here. Other assemblers support this, like Pila. But Pila is a desktop software.
&lt;br /&gt;
Now is the time to dig a lot inside the [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/User:Doruletz72/ONBA/Address_Modes address modes] to easy handle variables, cause we will continue with other assembly language elements.

==STRING CONSTANTS==
We refer here the implied string passed as arguments to the procedures or system functions.
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
   void ExampleProc(void)
   {
      char s[20];
      StrCopy(&quot;This a string constant&quot;, s);
   }
&lt;/source&gt;
Where is stored the value &quot;This a string constant&quot;? The string constants are the only data stored inside CODE SEGMENT. So if we refer a string constant we must use PC register as reference.
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
   proc ExampleProc()
   local s.20
   beginproc
      systrap StrCopy(&amp;sValue(pc).l, &amp;s(a6).l)
   endproc
   sValue dc.b &quot;This a string constant&quot;
&lt;/source&gt; 
Don't bother for '\0' null terminator or for padding. OnbA automatically adds a null terminator, and if the situation demands, adds a '\0' to preserve the word alignment boundary. Because string constants are stored inside CODE SEGMENT, which is read-only, don't attempt to write at these locations. You can't and your application probably will crash at this point. There is a minus: writing string constants inside will increase the size of the code segment. And as we know a code segment is limited to 32kb in size. Perhaps is better to use resources to store the strings or pdb files. It is up to you. If your code is too large you can use additional code segments.

==OPERATORS==
Assembly language is not use operators in the way of the high level languages they do. It treats the operators as operations and it uses instructions to cover this. 
===Assignment===
As you can see in the above examples, the most used operator, '''= assignment''', is covered mainly by memory movement instructions like MOVE, MOVEA, MOVEQ, LEA etc. 

===Integer arithmetic===
Also there are available instructions for integer arithmetic operators: 
:* +, addition - ADD, ADDA (add address), ADDI (immediate), ADDQ (quick), ADDX (extend with sign)
:* -, subtraction - SUB, SUBA, SUBI, SUBQ, SUBX
:* *, multiplication - MULS (signed), MULU (unsigned)
:* /, division - DIVS, DIVU
:* %, modulo/remainder is not available through an instruction. Here is an example for remainder operation:
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
   proc Modulo(op1.w, op2.w) ; return op1%op2
   local
   beginproc
      move.w op2(a6), d0 ; load op2 -&gt; D0
      ext.l d0           ; extends D0 from word to long
      divs.w op1(a6), d0 ; op1/op2
                         ; after execution of the instruction, D0 contains two values
                         ; the higher word -&gt; the remainder
                         ; the lower word -&gt; the quotient
                         ; R:Q
      swap d0            ; swaps the higher word with the lower word
                         ; Q:R
                         ; now, if you use content of the D0 as a word you will have the remainder
   endproc
&lt;/source&gt;

===BCD===
The 68k processor supports the integer numbers as BCD (binary-coded decimal). The BCD is a encoding of decimal integers where each digit of the number is represented by its binary codification. Read the wiki article http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary-coded_decimal for more information about BCD. There are available the following instructions: ABCD, SBCD, NBCD.

===Bits operations===
Also there is available a set of bits instructions: BTST, BSET, BCLR, TAS.

===Floating Point===
68k processor isn't supports the floating point numbers. You can use long and juggle with the decimal point. What is difference between 0,00000078 and 78/100000000? Or you can use the Palm OS the two sets of emulation libraries (FPLxxx and FLPxxx) to deal with the floating point numbers.
===Logical===
For logical operations are available: AND, ANDI, OR, ORI, EOR, EORI, NOT
===Shift and rotation===
:* shift: arithmetic ASL/ASR, logical LSL/LSR
:* rotations: ROL/ROR, ROXL/ROXR, SWAP
More information you can find in [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/User:Doruletz72/ONBA/Instructions_Set Instructions Set chapter].

==STATEMENTS==
Both conditional and loop statements are consist of a test portion, followed by a jump instruction to a label. Jump labels are visible in the whole code segment, so is not a bad idea to tag name prefixed with the procedures initials to make the code more readable and to avoid confusion and errors.
===Conditionals===
Let's consider an example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
   int ExampleProc(int Param)
   {
    if(Param == 0)
     return 0;
    else
     return 1;
   }
&lt;/source&gt;
Three alternatives for the C source:
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
   ; standard but not used in case of &quot;0&quot; comparison
   proc ExampleProc(Param.w)
   beginproc
     cmpi.w #0, Param(a6) ; CMPI sets the CCR register bits
                          ; according with (Param - 0) result 
     beq EP_Return0       ; if CCR, Z == 1, branch to EP_Return0 
     moveq #1, D0         ; D0 = 1
     bra EP_End           ; branch always to EP_End (return 1)
     EP_Return0
        moveq #0, D0      ; D0 = 0, return 0
     EP_End
   endproc
   ...
   ; alternative because is a &quot;0&quot; comparison
   ; so in fact it is no need for a comparison
   ; we can use a faster instruction, MOVE is faster than CMPI
   proc AnotherExample(Param.w)
   beginproc
     move.w Param(a6), D0 ; when MOVE load the Param to D0
                          ; it sets the CCR register bits
     beq AE_Return0       ; if CCR, Z == 1, branch to AE_Return0 
     moveq #1, D0         ; D0 = 1
     bra AE_End           ; branch always to AE_End (return 1)
     AE_Return0
        moveq #0, D0      ; D0 = 0, return 0
     AE_End
   endproc
   ...
   ; alternative, inverted logic
   proc AnotherAnotherExample(Param.w)
   beginproc
     move.w Param(a6), D0  ; when MOVE load the Param to D0
                           ; it sets the CCR register bits
     bne AAE_Return1       ; if CCR, Z == 0, branch to AAE_Return1
     moveq #0, D0          ; D0 = 0
     bra AAE_End           ; branch always to AAE_End (return 0)
     AAE_Return1
        moveq #1, D0      ; D0 = 1, return 1
     AAE_End
   endproc
&lt;/source&gt;
After the execution of an instruction, the register CCR flags are set according to the result value from the perspective of value 0. Considering this, if a comparison with 0 is sufficient to analyze the CCR register value immediately after the execution of instruction. For a comparison with a nonzero value, an additional CMP instruction must be executed. In fact the CMP is a SUB instruction without effective execution, but the flags (C, X, N, Z, V) are set in accordance.
&lt;br /&gt;
The '''Bcc''' instructions set ('''B'''ranch if '''C'''ondition '''C'''ode) can be used to create different conditional scenarios. Practically these instructions will cause a branch in the program if certain flags are set.

A '''switch ... case''' example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
   int SwitchProc(int Param)
   {
    switch(Param) {
       case 1: return 1;
       case 2: return 2;
       case 3: return 3;
       default: return 0;
      }
   }
&lt;/source&gt;
And the asm source: 
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
   proc SwitchProc(Param.w)
   beginproc
      cmpi.w #1, Param(a6)  ; Param - 1
         beq SP_ret1        ; if Z == 1 ( Param == 1) branch SP_ret1
      cmpi.w #2, Param(a6)  ; Param - 2
         beq SP_ret2        ; if Z == 1 ( Param == 2) branch SP_ret2
      cmpi.w #3, Param(a6)  ; Param - 3
         beq SP_ret3        ; if Z == 1 ( Param == 3) branch SP_ret3
      clr.w d0              ; else D0 = 0
         bra SP_End
      SP_ret1
         move.w #1, d0      ; D0 = 1
         bra SP_End
      SP_ret2
         move.w #2, d0      ; D0 = 2
         bra SP_End
      SP_ret3
         move.w #3, d0      ; D0 = 3
      SP_End                ; return
   endproc
&lt;/source&gt;
It's not so difficult as it seems to be.

===Loops===
For loop statements you need a starting label to identify the start of the loop. Then you must put a branch instruction to jump to the start of the loop or out of it. Between start label and the branch instruction you must alter the reference value.
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
   ...
   int var;
   ...
   for(int i = 0 ; i &lt; 10; i++)
     var = i;
   ...
&lt;/source&gt;  
We can use one of the '''Bcc''' instructions to do this: 
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
   ...
   local var.w
   ...
   ; we will use D1 as index
   move.w 0, d1          ; i = 0
   START_LOOP
      move.w d1, var(a6) ; var = i
      addi.w #1, d1      ; i++
      cmpi.w #10, d1     ; i ? 10
      blt START_LOOP     ; Branch if Less Than to START_LOOP
   ...
&lt;/source&gt;
Alternatively we could use '''DBcc''' instructions set ('''D'''ecrement and '''B'''ranch if a '''c'''ondition '''c'''ode):
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
   ...
   int var;
   ...
   for(i = 10; i &gt; 0 ; i --)
      var = i;
   ...
&lt;/source&gt;
But is not supported by OnbA:
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
   ...
   local var.w
   ...
   ; we will use D1 as index
   move.w #10, d1          ; i = 10
   START_LOOP
      move.w d1, var(a6) ; var = i
      dbhi d1, START_LOOP     ; branch if higher than 0 to START_LOOP and decrement D1
   ...
&lt;/source&gt;

==FUNCTIONS==
As we have seen, most examples have been structured as procedures. The goal was gaining habit of using them. There are two types of functions: system routines and the user procedures. In fact, the concept of function is very different from the C language. Here, there is no return values. In case of the system routines (Palm OS APIs):
:* register D0 will be used as a placeholder for return '''values''' 
:* register A0 will be used as a placeholder for return '''addresses''' (pointers)
So if you intend to use these values you must do this before to alter in some ways the content of the specified registers.
In case of user procedures there is no obligation to use D0 or A0 (it is up to you where/from write/read), but it is a good habit to use same standards.
===System Routines===
The system routines (Palm OS APIs) are blocks of binary code already placed at fixed memory locations by OS at the moment of device initialization. They are interfaces with memory, files area, interrupts, display registers and memory and so on. We can invoke them using TRAP #15 instruction followed by a word value containing the code of the routine. First of all we must do a PUSH operation of their arguments: increase the size of stack and put arguments on the stack into this space. The parameters must be pushed backwardly. After the call of the routine, we must decrease the size of the stack. And of course if we intend to use a &quot;return&quot; value, we must read D0 or A0, immediately after these. Let's consider a mixed example, a system routine, inside of a user procedure:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
   void Example(void)
   {
      MemHandle h;
      h = MemHandleNew(50); create a memory handle, 50 size
      ...
   }
&lt;/source&gt;
The asm &quot;real&quot; source:
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 Example            ; label of Example proc
  link a6, #-4      ; creates local frame for proc, only a long value for handle
  move.l #50, -(sp) ; increase the stack, then put the &quot;50&quot; parameter to the stack
  trap #15          ; call system api
  dc.w $A01E ;      ; invoke MemHandleNew
  addq.l #4, sp     ; decrease size of the stack  
  move.l a0, -4(a6) ; copy the returned address into -4(a6) handle 
  ...
  unlk a6           ; free the local frame 
  rts               ; return
&lt;/source&gt;
The asm OnbA source (easy way):
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
   proc Example()
   local h.l
   beginproc
      systrap MemHandleNew(#50.l)
      move.l a0, h(a6)
      ...
   endproc
&lt;/source&gt;
Using of '''systrap''' directive:
::systrap TrapName / #TrapNumber (parameter.size, ...)
where:
:* TrapName equ $&lt;NumberOfSystemTrap&gt;
:* size - specifies the size of the operand, for correct stack management; if you forgot to do this OnbA will use '''.w''', so take care!
In case of pointers, if you need to pass a &quot;location&quot;, use ampersand '''&amp;''' prefix and there is no need to specify a size:
::systrap TrapName / #TrapNumber ('''&amp;'''parameter, ...)
:* here size will be always '''long''', or 4, because it is an address.
:* in the PUSH sequence &quot;move.l ...&quot; will be replaced with &quot;pea ...&quot;

===User Procedures===
The user procedures are blocks of code referred using PC register. To access them you can use BSR/JSR instructions. See example above in this chapter [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/User:Doruletz72/ONBA/Assembly_Language#Code_segment Code Segment]. To define a procedure you must use the following OnbA directives:
:* '''proc''' ProcedureName(param.size, ...)
::* '''local''' var.size ; optional, valid only here
::* '''local''' ...
::* '''beginproc'''
::* ...
::* '''endproc'''
When you call a procedure defined with OnbA directives you must use '''call''' directive:
::call ProcedureName (parameter.size, ...)
where:
:* size - specifies the size of the operand, for correct stack management; if you forgot to do this OnbA will use '''.w''', so take care!
In case of pointers, if you need to pass a &quot;location&quot;, use ampersand '''&amp;''' prefix and there is no need to specify a size:
::call ProcedureName ('''&amp;'''parameter, ...)
:* here size will be always '''long''', or 4, because it is an address.
:* in the PUSH sequence &quot;move.l ...&quot; will be replaced with &quot;pea ...&quot;
To get the &quot;returned&quot; values, it is up to you where/from where write/read this values, but is better to use D0 for values and A0 for addresses. Is easy to read and everybody will talk same &quot;language&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This wikibook is designed to act as an introductory course in Python aimed at non-programmers with a particular emphasis on the use of Python in solving and modelling engineering problems. It is written in such a way that it could form part of the teaching material used in a degree-level course in programming for engineers. It is meant to give non-programmers a fast, simple and straightforward route into creating Python programs to solve mathematical problems, but is not meant to be a comprehensive course in using the Python language. There are already some good wikibooks on Python, this is meant to be a quick start guide for engineers. Think of it as a springboard to bounce you straight into using Python quickly!


'''The key aims of this book are:'''

* ''Expect no prior programming experience.''
* ''Be clear and straightforward to understand, keeping as non-technical as possible.''
* ''Get the reader programming as quickly as possible with plenty of examples.''
* ''Demonstrate that Python can be used to solve and model mathematical and engineering problems.''

In this lesson you will apply radian measure to various problem-solving contexts involving rotations.

==Lesson Objectives==
* Solve problems involving angles of rotation using radian measure.
* Solve problems by calculating the length of an arc.
* Solve problems by calculating the area of a sector.
* Approximate the length of a chord given the central angle and radius.

==Rotations==
{{Robox|theme=10|title=Example 1}}
The hands of a clock show 11:20. Express the obtuse angle formed by the hour and minute hands in radian measure to the nearest tenth of a radian.

The following diagram shows the location of the hands at the specified time.

:[[File:Applications of Radian Measure Example 1.svg|350px]]

----

'''Solution''':

Because there are 12 increments on a clock, the angle between each hour marking on the clock is &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{2\pi}{12}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\pi}{6}&lt;/math&gt; (or 30°).  So, the angle between the 12 and the 4 is 4 · &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\pi}{6}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{2\pi}{3}&lt;/math&gt; (or 120°).  Because the rotation from 12 to 4 is one-third of a complete rotation, it seems reasonable to assume that the hour hand is moving continuously and has therefore moved one-third of the distance between the 11 and the 12. So, &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{3}&lt;/math&gt; · &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\pi}{6}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\pi}{18}&lt;/math&gt;, and the total measure of the angle is therefore &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\pi}{18}&lt;/math&gt; + &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{2\pi}{3}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\pi}{18}&lt;/math&gt; + &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{12\pi}{18}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{13\pi}{18}&lt;/math&gt;.  Using a calculator to approximate the angle would give:

&lt;div style=&quot;background-color:white; border:1px solid #000000; margin-left:2em; padding:0px 5px 0px 5px; width:120px; font-family: 'DejaVu Sans Mono', 'FreeMono', 'Nimbus Mono L', 'Liberation Mono', 'Courier New', 'Courier', monospace; font-size:12px;&quot;&gt;
13π/18&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:right; margin:0px; padding:0px;&quot;&gt;2.268928028&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

To the nearest tenth of a radian it is 2.3 radians.

==Length of an Arc==
The length of an arc on a circle depends on both the angle of rotation and the radius length of the circle. If you recall from the last lesson, we defined a radian as the length of the arc the measure of an angle ''θ'' in radians is defined as the length of the arc cut off by one radius length, so that a half-rotation is π radians, or a little more than 3 radius lengths around the circle. What if the radius is 4 cm? The length of the half-circle arc would be π radius lengths, or 4π cm in length.

:[[File:Applications of Radian Measure Figure 1.svg|300px]]

This results in a formula that can be used to calculate the length of any arc.

:&lt;math&gt;s = r\theta\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where ''s'' is the length of the arc, ''r'' is the radius, and ''θ'' is the measure of the angle in radians.

Solving this equation for ''θ'' will give us a formula for finding the radian measure given the arc length and the radius length:

:&lt;math&gt;\theta = \frac{s}{r}&lt;/math&gt;

{{Robox|theme=10|title=Example 2}}
The free-throw line on an NCAA basketball court is 12 ft wide. In international competition, it is only about 11.81 ft. How much longer is the half circle above the free-throw line on the NCAA court?

:[[File:Applications of Radian Measure Example 2.svg|400px]]

----

'''Solution''':

Arc length calculations:

:{| cellpadding=&quot;3&quot; style=&quot;background:transparent;&quot;
! scope=&quot;col&quot; | NCAA
! scope=&quot;col&quot; style=&quot;padding-left:20px;&quot; | International
|-
| ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''rθ'' || style=&quot;padding-left:20px;&quot; | ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ''rθ''
|-
| ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 6(π) || style=&quot;padding-left:20px;&quot; | ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ≈ 5.905(π)
|-
| ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 6π || style=&quot;padding-left:20px;&quot; | ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ≈ 5.905π
|}

So the answer is approximately 6π − 5.905π ≈ 0.095π.

&lt;div style=&quot;background-color:white; border:1px solid #000000; margin-left:2em; padding:0px 5px 0px 5px; width:120px; font-family: 'DejaVu Sans Mono', 'FreeMono', 'Nimbus Mono L', 'Liberation Mono', 'Courier New', 'Courier', monospace; font-size:12px;&quot;&gt;
.095π&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:right; margin:0px; padding:0px;&quot;&gt;.0.29845130209103&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

This is approximately 0.3 ft, or about 3.6 inches longer.

{{Robox|theme=10|title=Example 3}}
Two connected gears are rotating. The smaller gear has a radius of 4 inches and the larger gear's radius is 7 inches. What is the angle through which the larger gear has rotated when the smaller gear has made one complete rotation?

:[[File:Applications of Radian Measure Example 3.svg|400px]]

----

'''Solution''':

Because the blue gear performs one complete rotation, the length of the arc traveled is:

:''s'' = ''rθ''
:''s'' = 4 · 2π

So, an 8π arc length on the larger circle would form an angle as follows:

:''θ'' = &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{s}{r}&lt;/math&gt;

:''θ'' = &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{8\pi}{7}&lt;/math&gt;

:''θ'' ≈ 3.6

So the angle is approximately 3.6 radians.

:3.6 · &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{180}{\pi}&lt;/math&gt; ≈ 206°
{{Robox/Close}}

==Area of a Sector==
One of the most common geometric formulas is the area of a circle:

:&lt;math&gt;A = \pi r^2\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

In terms of angle rotation, this is the area created by 2π radians.

:&lt;math&gt;2\pi\text{ radian angle} = \pi r^2\text{ area}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

A half-circle, or π radian rotation would create a section, or '''sector''' of the circle equal to half the area or:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}\pi r^2&lt;/math&gt;

So an angle of 1 radian would define an area of a sector equal to:

:{| cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
| style=&quot;text-align:right;&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\frac{2\pi}{2\pi} =&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\frac{\pi r^2}{2\pi}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| style=&quot;text-align:right;&quot; | &lt;math&gt;1 =\,\!&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2} r^2&lt;/math&gt;
|}

From this we can determine the area of the sector created by any angle, ''θ'' radians, to be:

:&lt;math&gt;A = \frac{1}{2}r^2\theta&lt;/math&gt;

Crops are often grown using a technique called center pivot irrigation that results in circular shaped fields.

[[File:PivotIrrigationOnCotton.jpg|400px]]

Here is a satellite image taken over fields in Kansas that use this type of irrigation system.

[[File:Crops Kansas AST 20010624.jpg|400px]]

If the irrigation pipe is 450 m in length, what is the area that can be irrigated after a rotation of &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{2\pi}{3}&lt;/math&gt; radians?

:[[File:Applications of Radian Measure Example 4.svg|300px]]

----

'''Solution''':

Using the formula:

:&lt;math&gt;A = \frac{1}{2}r^2\theta&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;A = \frac{1}{2}(450)^2 \left (\frac{2\pi}{3}\right )&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;background-color:white; border:1px solid #000000; margin-left:2em; padding:0px 5px 0px 5px; width:120px; font-family: 'DejaVu Sans Mono', 'FreeMono', 'Nimbus Mono L', 'Liberation Mono', 'Courier New', 'Courier', monospace; font-size:12px;&quot;&gt;
.5*450&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;*2π/3&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:right; margin:0px; padding:0px;&quot;&gt;212057.5041&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

The area is approximately 212,058 square meters.

==Length of a Chord==
You may recall from your [[High School Geometry|Geometry]] studies that a chord is a segment that begins and ends on a circle.

:[[File:Applications of Radian Measure Figure 2.svg|300px]]

&lt;math&gt;\overline{AB}&lt;/math&gt; is a chord in the circle.

We can calculate the length of any chord if we know the angle measure and the length of the radius. Because each endpoint of the chord is on the circle, the distance from the center to ''A'' and ''B'' is the same as the radius length.

:[[File:Applications of Radian Measure Figure 3.svg|300px]]

Next, if we bisect the angle, the angle bisector must be perpendicular to the chord (we will leave the proof of this to your Geometry class). This forms a right triangle.

:[[File:Applications of Radian Measure Figure 4.svg|300px]]

We can now use a simple sine ratio to find half the chord, called ''c'' here, and double the result to find the length of the chord.

:[[File:Applications of Radian Measure Figure 5.svg|300px]]

:{| cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
| style=&quot;text-align:right;&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\sin \left (\frac{\theta}{2} \right ) =&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\frac{c}{r}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| style=&quot;text-align:right;&quot; | &lt;math&gt;c =\,\!&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;r \cdot \sin \left ( \frac{\theta}{2} \right )&lt;/math&gt;
|}

So the length of the chord is:

:&lt;math&gt;2c = 2r \sin \left ( \frac{\theta}{2} \right )&lt;/math&gt;

{{Robox|theme=10|title=Example 5}}
Find the length of the chord of a circle with radius 8 cm and a central angle of 110°. Approximate your answer to the nearest mm.

----

'''Solution''':

It's always a good problem solving technique to estimate the answer first. A thought process for estimating the measure might look something like this:

The angle is slightly more than 90°, or &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\pi}{2}&lt;/math&gt; radians.  &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\pi}{2}&lt;/math&gt; radians is slightly more than 1.5 radius lengths. One and a half radii would be 12, so we might expect the answer to be a little more than 12 cm. Let's see how the actual answer compares.

:[[File:Applications of Radian Measure Example 5.svg|300px]]

We must first convert the angle measure to radians:

:&lt;math&gt;100 \cdot \frac{\pi}{180} = \frac{11\pi}{18}&lt;/math&gt;

Using the formula, half of the chord length should be the radius of the circle times the sine of half the angle.

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{11\pi}{18} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{11\pi}{36}&lt;/math&gt;

8 · sin &lt;math&gt;\left (\tfrac{11\pi}{36}\right )&lt;/math&gt; (Make sure your calculator is in radians!)

Multiply this result by 2.

&lt;div style=&quot;background-color:white; border:1px solid #000000; margin-left:2em; padding:0px 5px 0px 5px; width:120px; font-family: 'DejaVu Sans Mono', 'FreeMono', 'Nimbus Mono L', 'Liberation Mono', 'Courier New', 'Courier', monospace; font-size:12px;&quot;&gt;
8sin(11π/36)&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:right; margin:0px; padding:0px;&quot;&gt;6.553216354&lt;/div&gt;
Ans*2&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:right; margin:0px; padding:0px;&quot;&gt;13.10643271&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

So, the length of the arc is approximately 13.1 cm. This seems very reasonable based on our estimate.

# The state championship game is to be held at Ray Diaz Memorial Arena. The seating forms a perfect circle around the court. The principal of Archimedes High School is sent the following diagram showing the seating allotted to the students at her school.&lt;br /&gt;[[File:Applications of Radian Measure Question 4.svg|450px]]&lt;br /&gt;It is 55 ft from the center of the court to the beginning of the stands and 110 ft from the center to the end. Calculate the approximate number of square feet each of the following groups has been granted:
#:(a) the students from Archimedes
#:(b) general admission
#:(c) the press and officials
# [[File:Flag of Colorado.svg|200px|border|right]] To the right is an image of the state flag of Colorado.  It turns out that the diameter of the gold circle is &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{3}&lt;/math&gt; the total height of the flag (the same width as the yellow stripe) and the outer diameter of the red circle is &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{2}{3}&lt;/math&gt; of the total height of the flag. The angle formed by the missing portion of the red band is &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\pi}{4}&lt;/math&gt; radians. In a flag that is 33 inches tall, what is the area of the red portion of the flag to the nearest square inch?

#:(a) i. &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\pi}{12}&lt;/math&gt;
#:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;ii. ≈ 0.3 radians
#:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;iii. 15°
#:(b) i. 20°.  Answers may vary, anything about 15° and less than 25° is reasonable.
#:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;ii. &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\pi}{9}&lt;/math&gt;.  Again, answers may vary.
# &amp;nbsp;
#:(a) &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\pi}{6}&lt;/math&gt;
#:(b) ≈ 26 cm
# &amp;nbsp;
#:(a) &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\pi}{16}&lt;/math&gt;
#:(b) Let's assume, to simplify, that the chord stretches to the center of each of the dots. We need to find the measure of the central angle of the circle that connects those two dots.&lt;br /&gt;[[File:Alexander Hall Princeton University Window Right Detail2.png|250px]]&lt;br /&gt;Since there are 13 dots, this angle is &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{13\pi}{16}&lt;/math&gt;.  The length of the chord then is:
#:&lt;math&gt;= 2r \sin \left (\frac{\theta}{2} \right )&lt;/math&gt;
#:&lt;math&gt;= 2 \cdot 1.2 \cdot \sin \left (\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{13\pi}{16} \right )&lt;/math&gt;

#:The chord is approximately 2.30 cm.
# Each section is &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\pi}{6}&lt;/math&gt; radians. The area of one section of the stands is therefore the area of the outer sector minus the area of the inner sector:
#:(a) The students have four sections or ≈ 9,503 ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
#:(b) There are three general admission sections or ≈ 7,127 ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
#:(c) There is only one press and officials section or ≈ 2,376 ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
#:&lt;math&gt;A = A_{\text{outer}} - A_{\text{inner}}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
#:&lt;math&gt;A = \frac{1}{2}(r_{\text{outer}})^2 \cdot \frac{\pi}{6} - \frac{1}{2}(r_{\text{inner}})^2 \cdot \frac{\pi}{6}&lt;/math&gt;
#:&lt;math&gt;A = \frac{1}{2}(110)^2 \cdot \frac{\pi}{6} - \frac{1}{2}(55)^2 \cdot \frac{\pi}{6}&lt;/math&gt;
#:&lt;div style=&quot;background-color:white; border:1px solid #000000; margin-top:5px; padding:0px 5px 0px 5px; width:120px; font-family: 'DejaVu Sans Mono', 'FreeMono', 'Nimbus Mono L', 'Liberation Mono', 'Courier New', 'Courier', monospace; font-size:12px;&quot;&gt;.5*110&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;*π/6-.5*55&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*π/6&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:right; margin:0px; padding:0px;&quot;&gt;2375.829444&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
#:The area of each section is approximately 2376 ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.
# There are many different approaches to the problem. Here is one possibility:
#: First, calculate the area of the red ring as if it went completely around the circle:
#::&lt;math&gt;A = A_{\text{total}} - A_{\text{gold}}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
#::&lt;math&gt;A = \pi \left ( \frac{2}{3} \cdot 33 \right )^2 - \pi \left ( \frac{1}{3} \cdot 33 \right )^2&lt;/math&gt;
#::&lt;math&gt;A = \pi \cdot 22^2 - \pi \cdot 11^2\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
#::&lt;math&gt;A = 484\pi - 121\pi = 363\pi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
#::&lt;math&gt;A \approx 1140.4\text{ in}^2\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
#:[[File:Applications of Radian Measure Answer 5-1.svg|250px]]
#: Next, calculate the area of the total sector that would form the opening of the &quot;c&quot;:
#::&lt;math&gt;A = \frac{1}{2}r^2\theta&lt;/math&gt;
#::&lt;math&gt;A = \frac{1}{2}(22)^2 \left ( \frac{\pi}{4} \right )&lt;/math&gt;
#::&lt;math&gt;A \approx 190.1\text{ in}^2\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
#:[[File:Applications of Radian Measure Answer 5-2.svg|250px]]
#: Then, calculate the area of the yellow sector and subtract it from the previous answer.
#::&lt;math&gt;A = \frac{1}{2}r^2\theta&lt;/math&gt;
#::&lt;math&gt;A = \frac{1}{2}(11)^2 \left (\frac{\pi}{4}\right )&lt;/math&gt;
#::&lt;math&gt;A \approx 47.5\text{ in}^2\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
#::&lt;math&gt;190.1 - 47.5 = 142.6\text{ in}^2\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
#:Finally, subtract this answer from the first area calculated.
#:[[File:Applications of Radian Measure Answer 5-3.svg|250px]]
#:The area is approximately 998 in&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Starting OnbA==
[[File:Onba11.JPG|Onba01|left|alt=A]]
Many guys stop their attemps to use the OnbA simply because it have a poor interface with no help. Now is time to solve this.
&lt;br /&gt; 
To use OnbA you will need an assembler source code file. To do this open SrcEdit, edit a file and save it with &quot;.asm&quot; extension. Start the OnbA and tap DOC button. Now all your &quot;.asm&quot; files will be listed. Select one and tap &quot;Build&quot; button to compile it.
&lt;br /&gt;
Don't forgot to specify in your file the '''prc''' destination name and the '''creator''' identifier:
*   prc &quot;MyPRC&quot;
*   creator &quot;Me00&quot;
Also, if you have a multi-segment application, take care with your output, which record will be overwritten or created inside your prc file. 
*   code - will write to the current code record, default CODE 1
*   code &lt;number&gt; - will write to the code segment &lt;number&gt;, CODE &lt;number&gt;
*   '''Note:''' valid values are integers bigger than 0
If you need additionally resources, create an Onboard C project with the same '''prc name''' and '''creator identifier''', include in project your resource files, then build it. Next time when you launch OnbA, it will overwrite only the data or code records which you have specified. So don't bother cause you will damage the prc file. Got the point? Very simple.

==First program==
Open the SrcEdit and type this code:
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
   ; Simple skeleton app
   ;
   ; name of the prc to produce
   prc &quot;MyFirst&quot;
   ; name of creator, 4 chars
   creator &quot;test&quot;
   ;  put OnbA into code generating mode
   code
   ; some equ's of common systrap names
   include &quot;systraps.inc&quot;
   ;
   proc PilotMain_00(cmd.w, cmdPBP.l launchFlags.w)
   local err.w
   local evt.24
   beginproc
      tst.w cmd(a6)           ; is normal launch?
      bne PmReturn            ; no jump to PmReturn
      systrap FrmAlert(#1000) ; yes show the form alert 1000
     PmReturn
   endproc
&lt;/source&gt;
If you don't have a '''systraps.inc''' file, replace the line
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
include &quot;systraps.inc&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;
with
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
FrmAlert equ $A192
&lt;/source&gt;
Now save the file as &quot;MyFirst.asm&quot; and compile it. Before running you will need an alert resource named 1000. Open the RsrcEdit, find and open file &quot;MyFirst&quot; with creator &quot;test&quot;, then create an alert resource with id 1000. Now save and run your application.

==Skeleton with no forms==

      case penDownEvent:
         // do something
         handled = 1;
         break;
         // add more events here
     default: handled = 0; break;
     }
   return handled;
}
//
UInt32  PilotMain(UInt16  cmd,
void *cmdPBP, UInt16  launchFlags)
{
  EventType  event;
  UInt16 error;
  if(cmd == 
    sysAppLaunchCmdNormalLaunch)
  {
    startApp();
    do
        {
           EvtGetEvent(&amp;event, 0);
           if (SysHandleEvent (&amp;event))
                continue;
           MyEventHandler(&amp;event);
        } while (event.eType != appStopEvent);
    stopApp();
  }
  return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

      <comment>/* KBG Application */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
This is a cheat sheet for making applications to admit prior statements as evidence for the truth of its contents. 

The need to admit the prior statement in for the truth of its contents arises out of several scenarios:
* the witness states they do not recall the evidence from the statement and their memory cannot be refreshed (either honestly or not);
* the witness states that the events occurred differently from how they were stated in the statement;
* the witness is unavailable;

The options for the Crown is to do any of the following:
* refresh the memory of the witness with the prior statement (Coffin Application)
* seek to admit the prior statement for the truth of its contents (KGB or Khan Application)
* seek to cross-examine the witness on the prior statement (s. 9(2) of CEA)
* seek to cross-examine the witness as an adverse/hostile witness (s. 9(1) of CEA)

Many times all these options are chosen. The Coffin Application is generally required before the latter options are to be considered. This is to allow the witness a chance to adopt the statement without going through the other steps. The cross-examination applications can be used to bring out evidence discrediting the reliability of the new version of events (as the case may be), or to establish the reliability and necessity of the prior statement for the purpose of the Hearsay Application.

==Process Summary==
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Scenario !! &quot;I can't remember what happened&quot; !! &quot;I wasn't accurate in my prior statement&quot; !! Witness is Absent
|-
| When to invoke
|| 
#The witness states that they cannot recall events that are recorded in a prior statement
|| 
#The witness states that their prior statement was false or inaccurate from events they can testify to in court
|| 
#The witness is missing or otherwise unavailable to testify
|-
| Step 0: Before Court
|| 
# Have copies of transcript or written statement as well as the audio / video recording
# Have the witness review the written statement before court
|| 
#
|| 
#
|-
| Step 1: Est. Type of Hearsay Issue
|| 
#Exhaust the memory of the witness
(Coffin Application)
#Establish a prior occasion where they talked to police about the case
#Establish when/where/how of the prior statement
#Allow the witness to read the transcript of the statement to refresh the memory (This is best done before court)
#Confirm that the statement is accurate in recording the questions asked and answers given 
||
#Establish new version of events that are different from the original statement
#Establish a prior occasion where they talked to police about the case
#Establish when/where/how of the prior statement
#Allow the witness to read the transcript of the statement to refresh the memory (This is best done before court)
#Confirm that the statement is accurate in recording the questions asked and answers given 
|| 
#Establish that a witness who gave a statement to the police is not present at court (all evidence coming from the relevant peace officer)
#Establish a prior occasion where the missing witness talked to police about the case
#Establish when/where/how of the prior statement
#Allow the witness to read the transcript of the statement to refresh the memory (This is best done before court)
#Confirm that the statement is accurate in recording the questions asked and answers given 
|-
| Step 2: Est. Inconsistency 
|| 
(9(2) Application)
# Crown should have the witness and jury excused for beginning of voir dire
# Crown may have to call additional evidence to prove the prior statement, if not already established by the witness, defence can cross-examine on creation of statement
#Crown indicates that in comparing the statement to the current testimony, there may be an inconsistency 
# Crown proceeds with 9(2) Application
## Crown shows transcript to the judge - marked as exhibit
## Crown begins voir dire, asks for consent to having V/D evidence apply to trial
## Judge hears submissions from both sides on whether there is an inconsistency
# Factors in argument include: i) the level of detail which is not remembered; ii) whether any omissions are significant in the context iii) the materiality of the inconsistency
# The judge makes a ruling allowing cross-examination on the prior statement

|| 
&lt;center&gt;N/A&lt;/center&gt;
|-
|Step 3: Impeachment on Statement
||
(only permitted if the Judge permits cross-examination)&lt;br&gt;
# If not already, the Jury should be excused for the duration of the voir dire
# The witness is recalled
# witness is cross examined on circ. of statement, personal circumstances at the time, voluntariness of statement, importance of statement, consequences of a false statement
# Impeach witness: confirm current testimony, confront with prior statement, give credit to prior statement
||
&lt;center&gt;Same&lt;/center&gt;
||
&lt;center&gt;N/A&lt;/center&gt;
|-
|Step 4: Attack Overall Credibility
||
(9(1) Application)&lt;br&gt;
# request judge to declare witness as Hostile 
# reasons will be based on the evidence established in impeachment as well as demeanor evidence
# if judge declares witness hostile, counsel may cross-examine at large
||
&lt;center&gt;Same&lt;/center&gt;
||
&lt;center&gt;N/A&lt;/center&gt;
|-
|Step 5: Hearsay Application
||
# jury should be excused if not already 
# Crown should have the witness and jury excused for beginning of voir dire
# Crown may have to call additional evidence to prove the prior statement, if not already established by the witness, defence can cross-examine on creation of statement
# Crown should call evidence supporting necessity and reliability of the statement
# Crown may be able to rely on evidence heard in 9(2) application and subsequent cross-examination to establish both necessity and reliability of the prior statement.
# Crown argument includes: i) direct evidence either not possible or too difficult; ii) prior statement contains information that provides full and accurate account
||
# Crown may be able to rely on evidence heard in 9(2) application and subsequent cross-examination to establish both necessity and reliability of the prior statement.
# Crown argument includes: i) direct evidence either not possible or too difficult; ii) prior statement contains information that provides full and accurate account
||
# Establish that the witness was searched for diligently and was not found ''or'' was reasonably believed to be unavailable due to death, incapacity, or active avoidance
# Crown may also rely on evidence of officer testifying to the making of the statement / may want to call any other witnesses who can testify to the circumstances of the taking of the statement to establish voluntariness, presence of any pressures, emotional and physical state, etc.
# Crown argument includes: i) direct evidence either not possible or too difficult; ii) prior statement contains information that provides full and accurate account

In a sense the process involves a number of voir dires. The process can be done in separate parts or all in a seamless process, the latter being the preferred method. Regardless of the method, the evidence from one phase may be used to support the next phase. Effectively, the evidence of each voir dire is considered as a whole regardless of whether the defence consents or not.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. H. (S.) (1998), 14 C.R. (5th) 80, 37 W.C.B. (2d) 362 (Ont. Prov. Div.) at para. 14 - 22&lt;/ref&gt;
The court, in determining whether to grant the KGB application, may in certain cases also consider evidence hearing in the trial itself, again without consent of defence.&lt;ref&gt;
H(S) at para. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coffin Application (Refreshing Memory)==
Where a witness is testifying and cannot recall their anticipated evidence (whether feigned or honest) the party should attempt to refresh their memory from their prior statement. A [[Canadian Criminal Evidence/Testimonial Evidence/Refreshing Memory|Coffin Application]] is the method by which a witness's memory can be refreshed in anticipation of a Hearsay application. 

Once the application is complete and the witness' memory is not refreshed, the applicant should turn to either a KGB application, if the lack of memory is believed to be feigned, or a Khan application if the memory loss is genuine. The court should make a ruling on which it is, however, where it is unclear, it is best to proceed as a KGB application. The KBG has a higher standard of evidence than a Khan application.

See R v Stewart, [http://canlii.ca/t/1z6bm 1976 CanLII 202] (SCC), [1977] 2 SCR 748

===Written Statement===
This applies to written statements made in the course of the police taking statement as part of their investigation.

The witness should be asked about recalling the following:
# encountering the police at a specific time and place
# knowledge of the manner the police became involved
# speaking to officers
# officers names
# ID'ing officers at court
# the officers asking about what happened
# telling them some information in response
# gave a ''written'' statement between a certain period of time
# the number of pages in length
# had a chance to review it
# had a chance to make any changes needed
# never made any changes to it
# signed it on completion
# signed by officer present at court

'''Next ask the court permission to have the witness review the statement. If the judge does not allow it, then call the officer to prove the statement.'''
# confirm statement in their hand writing
# confirm their signature on each page
# confirm polices signature on page
# go line by line confirming, whether that was what was said by the witness
# confirm whether it is his statement
# confirm whether the statement refreshes their memory

'''if the witness denies that it is her statment, you must call the officer to prove that it was her statement.'''

'''Go back to the original question asked for which the witness could not recall'''
# confirm whether the statement refreshes their memory to answer the initial question

===Oral Statement reduced to writing===
This applies to oral statements that were reduced to writing such as in a police officer's notebook.

The witness should be asked about recalling the following:
# encountering the police at a specific time and place
# knowledge of the manner the police became involved
# speaking to officers
# officers names
# ID'ing officers at court
# the officers asking about what happened
# telling them some information in response
# gave a ''verbal'' statement
# saw the officers take note in their books
# officers give them a chance to review the statement
# officers give them a chance to correct or change the statement
# the witness signed the statement

** Next ask the court permission to have the witness review the statement. If the judge does not allow it, then call the officer to prove the statement. **
# go line by line confirming, wehther that was what was said by the witness

** Go back to the original question asked for which the witness could not recall
# confirm whether the statement refreshes their memory to answer the initial question

===Oral Statement recorded===
This applies to oral statements that was recorded such as a 911 call.

The witness should be asked about recalling the following:
# calling 911
# speaking to an operator
# being asked what the emergency was
# made a report
# asked questions and details

'''Next ask the court permission to play the recording. If the judge does not allow it, then call the 911 operator to prove the statement.'''
# ID voices recorded
# confirm the recording is complete, nothing is missing, and is accurate

'''Go back to the original question asked for which the witness could not recall'''
# confirm whether the statement refreshes their memory to answer the initial question

==Khan Application==
'''When Available'''
* '''witness unavailable''' (e.g. missing or dead) -- application should be brought before the beginning of a jury trial; but any time while in Judge-alone trial.
* '''witness is incompetent''' 
* '''witness is unable to recall events'''

Steps:
:1. seek consent to start voir dire and that evidence will blend with trial
:2. call witness to establish necessity (that the prior statement was ''reasonably'' necessary)
:3. call witness to establish signs of reliability (threshold)
:4. other side may cross-examine witness on reliability/necessity
:5. defence may call witnesses; crown will cross-examine
:6. argument on admissibility of statement

===Necessity===
Must show:
* necessary to prove fact in issue
* other direct evidence either not possible or too difficult
* prior statement contains info that provides full and accurate account (see Khan, Smith, FWJ)
* why the witness is not available

'''Examples'''
* witness dead (Smith 1992 SCC)
* witness left jurisdiction
* witness failed to attend after being subpeonaed 
* witness has memory loss (Fullerton 1994)
* witness has false memory loss &lt;ref&gt;
See: R. v. Conway, (1997), 121 CCC (3d) 397 at 410 (Ont. C.A.) [http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/1997/1997canlii2726/1997canlii2726.html]&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Savoy, [2000] B.C.J. No. 551 (B.C.S.C.)&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Diu, (2000), 144 C.C.C. (3d) 481 (Ont. C.A.)[http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/2000/2000canlii4535/2000canlii4535.html]&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Tat (1997), 117 C.C.C. (3d) 481 (Ont. C.A.)[http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/1997/1997canlii2234/1997canlii2234.html]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;
* witness refuses to testify (Trudell, Green)
* spousal privilege (Hawkins 1996 SCC)
* witness is child
* witness is incompetent
* witness has disability

==KGB Application==
'''When Available?'''
* When the Witness recants from a prior statment and adopts a new version of events

Steps:
:1. get '''all details''' from the witness' present memory
:2. ask how clear the memory is. if memory not clear:
::a. refresh memory by showing prior statement (N.B. confirm author/time/place)
::b. ask if it refreshes memory
::c. ask for recollection again (witness will likely give some excuse why not able to remember)
:3. ask about circumstances of giving prior statement to give signs of reliability:
::a. whether witness made the complaint to police
::b. whether statement given to official/police officer
::c. type of narrative of statment (Questions and Answer style)
::d. whether witness knew if statement was being recorded
::e. whether the statement was sworn
::f. whether witness was warned of risk of lying
::g. state of sobriety at the time of statement
::h. emotional state at time of statement
::i. voluntariness of giving statement

At this point the accused may be able to cross examine the witness. This point the applicant will ask the court whether to declare the witness as hostile to be cross-examined.

Cross-examination on Statement:
:1. establish voluntariness of statement
:2.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Python can be downloaded from the official Python website:

http://www.python.org/

If you are running Microsoft™ Windows™ then you can download a simple installation file from the downloads section of the official Python website and run that. If you are using a Linux distribution (such as Ubuntu, Debian, Red Hat etc.) you will most probably already have python installed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Windows&amp;trade;==

In Microsoft&amp;trade; Windows&amp;trade; you can run IDLE which is a piece of software called a development environment, by clicking on Start Menu, Python, IDLE. This is a program in which you can write and run Python programs.

==Linux Based Operating Systems==
In a Linux operating system such as Ubuntu, you can simply use Python in the Terminal. You can write a python program using GEdit and saving the file with the ending '.py', for example:&lt;br&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;filename.py&lt;/tt&gt;

You can then run your program by typing the following in the terminal:&lt;br&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;python filename.py&lt;/tt&gt;

You must make sure your file is saved in the directory in which your terminal is in.

The rest of this wikibook shall assume that you are running Windows&amp;trade; and using IDLE, everything is much the same in a Linux system or if you are running a Macintosh&amp;trade;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Python can be run in two modes, the first is called ''interactive mode''. This is where every command you type in is immediately ''interpreted'' by python and the result outputted onto your screen. For example type:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
print(&quot;Hello and welcome to python!!!&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

This will immediately print 'Hello and welcome to python!' on your screen.&lt;br&gt;

Alternatively you can use python in ''non-interactive (standard) mode''. Write your lines of code into a file, save it and then run that file. This is convenient if your program starts to become large - otherwise you would have to type all the lines of your program every time you started using python.

When you first load IDLE, it is running in interactive mode. To write a program script (to save and run later), click on 'File; New Window'. Here you can write your program and save it. To run it you can either click on 'Run; Run Module' or press F5. Alternatively, you can run a python script by typing the following in a DOS Prompt (or in the Terminal on a Linux machine).

&lt;tt&gt;python myfilename.py&lt;/tt&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Firstly, let's just quickly see how you can do simple arithmetic in Python. The table below list the basic mathematical operators and the associated code in python.

| &lt;tt&gt;2&lt;/tt&gt;
|

| &lt;tt&gt;8.0/3&lt;/tt&gt;
| &lt;tt&gt;2.666...&lt;/tt&gt;
|-

| %
| &lt;tt&gt;8%3&lt;/tt&gt;
| &lt;tt&gt;2&lt;/tt&gt;
|
| Exponential

| &lt;tt&gt;3**2&lt;/tt&gt;
| &lt;tt&gt;9&lt;/tt&gt;
|}


For more complex arithmetic, python contains a special module called &lt;tt&gt;math&lt;/tt&gt;. This module contains an array of different functions (such as square root) and constants (such as pi). To use a module, we must first import it, like so:

    &lt;tt&gt;import math&lt;/tt&gt;

We can then use for example:

    &lt;tt&gt;math.sqrt(16)&lt;/tt&gt;    #to find the square root of 16.
    &lt;tt&gt;math.pi&lt;/tt&gt;          #to get the value of pi.

Alternatively you can import modules in the following way:

    &lt;tt&gt;from math import *&lt;/tt&gt;

This will import everything from the math module directly allowing us instead to call the functions as follows:

    &lt;tt&gt;sqrt(16)&lt;/tt&gt; to find the square root of 16.
    &lt;tt&gt;pi&lt;/tt&gt; to get the value of pi.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In python, values can be saved as one of several different numeric data types. The main types that you will encounter to start with are integer values (whole numbers) and floating-point values. Note that python &lt;u&gt;always&lt;/u&gt; rounds ''down'' to the nearest whole number when using integers. (This is due to be changed in python version 3). When you enter a value into python it will automatically decide what data type it is, so for example:

Typing &lt;tt&gt;8&lt;/tt&gt; will create an integer value.
Typing &lt;tt&gt;8.0&lt;/tt&gt; will create a floating point value.

From thereon, python will treat that value as either an integer of floating (decimal) number.


You can convert between them using the &lt;tt&gt;int()&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;float()&lt;/tt&gt; functions. For example:

    &lt;tt&gt;my_variable = 8    #Creates a variable and assigns it the integer value 8&lt;br /&gt;
    my_variable_float = float(my_variabe)    #Creates a new variable with a floating point value of 8.0&lt;/tt&gt;

Notice that after a # symbol, the python interpreter ignores everything until the next line. This allows you to put comments in your code reminding you of what each line in your program is doing.

== Rounding Numbers ==

The built in function &lt;tt&gt;round()&lt;/tt&gt; will round a number up or down to the nearest whole number, for example:

    &lt;tt&gt;round(3.5)&lt;/tt&gt; will return the answer 4.

      <text xml:space="preserve">If you want your program to get an input from the user (for example to enter some parameters for your program to use), we use the &lt;tt&gt;input(''&quot;Message here&quot;'')&lt;/tt&gt; command, as follows:

 number = input(&quot;Enter a number: &quot;)

When the program is run, this will show the user the message ''Enter your name:'' and will then save whatever the user inputs as the variable ''username''. This can be very useful when writing a program to solve engineering type problems, as your program could ask the user to enter some parameters (such as mass, volume etc.) for your program to use.
{{NOTE|In Python 2, '''input''' actually evaluates the input as python code. In the new version of Python, Python 3, '''input''' has the functionality of '''raw_input''' in Python 2. To replicate the functionality of '''input''' in Python 2, use '''eval(input)'''.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">You may want your program to input/output data to/from a file. For example if your program calculates something repeatedly you may want it to store the value from each calculation in a file rather than let hem all print on screen. This can be done using the &lt;tt&gt;open()&lt;/tt&gt; command. For example:

    &lt;tt&gt;datafile = open(&quot;data.txt&quot;,'w')&lt;/tt&gt;

This creates a file called 'data.txt' and makes it available for writing (the w parameter). The file can then be accessed by your program using the reference 'datafile'. To write to the file we then use the ''write()'' command in the following way:

    &lt;tt&gt;datafile.write(&quot;Add this text to the file&quot;)&lt;/tt&gt;

This will add the text in quotation marks to the end of the file. It is important that you use the following command to close the file when you are done. If you are using Windows&amp;trade; and you don't do this, nothing will be written to the file!

    &lt;tt&gt;datafile.close()&lt;/tt&gt;


Functions to read/write to files are shown in the list below:


{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
! Command
! Description
|-
|open(&quot;filename&quot;,'w')
|Opens a file and makes it available for writing to.
|-
|open(&quot;filename&quot;,'r')
|Opens a file and makes it available for reading from.
|-
|reference.write(&quot;text&quot;)
|Writes the text &quot;text&quot; to the file that is referenced to by 'reference'.
|-
|reference.readline()
|Returns the next line of the file.
|-
|reference.read()
|Returns the entire file as a single string.
|-
|reference.readlines()
|Returns a list of strings. Each string is one line of the file.
|-
|reference.close()
|Closes the file.
|}

      <text xml:space="preserve">Now that you have a few of the basic components under your belt, it is now the time to make some extra tools available to you. The most important part of a program is often the ability to get your program to do something ''if'' something is true (or false). For example if an inputted value is above a set value. For example:

    &lt;tt&gt;yourage = input(&quot;Please enter your age: &quot;)
    if yourage &gt;= 18: 
        print(&quot;You may continue...&quot;)
    else:
        print(&quot;You are too young..... go away!&quot;)&lt;/tt&gt;

This little program will ask the user to input their age and then test whether it is greater than or equal to 18. If the user is old enough, a message saying continue is printed on screen, otherwise the user is told to go away!

'''The if statement will run a logical test and then run the commands after it if the test result is true. If the result is false, it will run the commands after the else: statement. If there is no else statement and the result is false, the program will do nothing.'''

You can add further tests before the else commands are run using the ''elif'' statement (stands for else if). It will act like another ''if'' statement after the first one until if all if test are false, then and only then will the else commands be run. For example:

    &lt;tt&gt;yourage = input(&quot;Enter your age: &quot;)
    if yourage &gt;= 80:
       print(&quot;Hello gramps!&quot;)
    elif yourage &gt;= 60:
       print(&quot;You can get your free bus pass now!&quot;)
    elif yourage &gt;= 40:
       print(&quot;Mid-life crisis due&quot;)
    elif yourage &gt;= 18:
       print(&quot;Make the most of those looks whilst you still can!&quot;)
    else:
       print(&quot;Go back to school!&quot;)&lt;/tt&gt;

If you are not quite sure what's going on try putting this into a script and running it in IDLE. See what message you get!

      <text xml:space="preserve">For loops give you a way to repeatedly do something. This can be either a set number of times, or to repeat a part of your program several times, but each time with a different value of a variable each time.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
for i in [1,2,3,4,5]:
    print(i)
&lt;/source&gt;

This will continually loop around, printing the value of i each time. This is a good time to quickly introduce you to two things, list and the range() command. As you have seen in the example, we can produce a list by using square brackets containing the values of our list, each one separated by a comma. For example, we can produce a variable and assign a list of values to it as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;countlist = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]&lt;/source&gt;

This variable is now of type 'list' and contains multiple entries. We can save ourselves the effort of writing out a long list just to count simply by using the ''range(startvalue,endvalue)'' command;

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
countlist = range(1,11)
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that the end value is 10, and not 11 as you might expect. This is because the range() does '''not''' include the end value. We can use this in our 'for' loop, as a quick way to repeat some part of our program with a list of values in a set range, for example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
for i in range(1,20):
    answer = i**2
    print(&quot;The value of i squared is... &quot; + str(answer))
&lt;/source&gt;

This will tell you the value of i squared, starting with i=1, up to i=19. Note that we have had to use the str() command to get Python to print out the message and the value of 'answer'. This converts the ''integer'' value of 'answer' to a string, so that it can be added to the message (which itself is a string!). Give it a go and try playing around with different values and different calculations.

      <text xml:space="preserve">While loops will repeat a section of code whilst a logical test is true.

Instead of repeating something with a defined list of values or a set number of times, a while loop will happily continue repeating its section of code until a logical test is satisfied. For example 

    &lt;tt&gt;done = False             # Creates a variable and gives it the logical vlue 'False'
    count = 0                # Creates a variable and gives it integer value 0
    while done == False:     # Repeats following code until logical test no longer satisfied
        count = count + 1    # Adds 1 to value of count variable
        print(&quot;The value of count is... &quot; + str(count))   # Prints value of count

The same code could also be written using != which means NOT EQUAL TO, for example:

    &lt;tt&gt;done = False             
    count = 0                
    while done != True:     
        count = count + 1    
        print(&quot;The value of count is... &quot; + str(count))&lt;/tt&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Before we can start any algebra, we must first tell Python what we want it to treat as symbols instead of numbers (x,y,z etc.). We do this in the following way, having imported the sympy module:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
x = Symbol('x')
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that it is important to use the capital S otherwise this won't work. What we are doing here, is telling Python to create a new variable x and to assign the value 'x' to it. This way, it won't treat it as a numeric value, but just the symbol x. The module sympy.abc contains all the letters of the alphabet as premade symbols.

We can then create a variable that is a function of x. In this case I shall call the variable that will contain the function, myfunction;

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
myfunction = x**2
&lt;/source&gt;

If we ask python what the value of myfunction is (by typing just 'myfunction'), we get the equation that we put in. Now, we can substitute a value for x into the equation by using ''.subs(old value, new value)'', for example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
myfunction.subs(x,5)
&lt;/source&gt;

This will replace x with 5, making the value of myfunction 25.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Matrices can be created in the following way:

    &lt;tt&gt;mymatrix = Matrix([[1,2],[3,4]])&lt;/tt&gt;

In this example, &lt;tt&gt;[1,2]&lt;/tt&gt; produces the first line of the matrix and &lt;tt&gt;[2,3]&lt;/tt&gt; creates the second.

==Quick Standard Matrices==
The following built in functions can be used to quickly create some standard matrices of specified size.

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
! Command
! Description
! Example
|-
|&lt;tt&gt;eye()&lt;/tt&gt;
|Identity Matrix
|&lt;tt&gt;eye(4)&lt;/tt&gt; ''creates a 4x4 identity matrix''
|-
|&lt;tt&gt;zeros()&lt;/tt&gt;
|Empty Matrix
|zeros(2,3)&lt;/tt&gt; ''creates a 2x3 matrix of zeros''
|-
|&lt;tt&gt;ones()&lt;/tt&gt;
|Matrix of 1s
|&lt;tt&gt;ones(2)&lt;/tt&gt; ''creates a 2x2 matrix of ones''
|}

==Getting the Size of a Matrix==
You can find out the size of a matrix using the ''.shape[]'' command, for example:

    &lt;tt&gt;mymatrix.shape[0]&lt;/tt&gt;

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
! Command
! Description
|-
|.shape[0]
|Gives number of rows
|-
|.shape[1]
|Gives number of columns
|}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{wikipedia|Geography of Europe}}
Europe is a continent of over 50 countries with a border that is largely undefined (defining which countries are European and which aren't is argued a lot) and with many different landscapes, climates and wildlife.
[[Image:Mbcourmayeur0001.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Mont Blonc (Monte Bianco), the highest mountain in western Europe]]
== Islands of Europe ==
[[Image:Laponie1.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Arctic conditions in Lapland, Finland]]
Europe has many thousands of islands and some of these are countries ([[../Iceland/]] and [[../Cyprus/]], for example).  The largest islands are Iceland, Great Britain, Ireland (includes the country called &quot;Ireland&quot; and Northern Ireland which is part of the UK), Sicily, Spitsbergen and Sardinia.

[[Image:Northwestern_Europe_at_Night.JPG|thumb|250px|right|North-west Europe at night, London on the left, Brussels and Amsterdam above and to the right of London, Pairs below and Milan can be seen near the far-right of the picture]]

== Mountains of Europe ==

In the east of the continent are the [[w:Ural mountains|Ural mountains]] (click the mountain links to read the article on Wikipedia) which separate Europe from Asia.  North of the Mediterranean Sea are the [[w:Alps|Alps]]  which run through [[../France/]], [[../Switzerland/]], [[../Italy/]], [[../Germany/]], [[../Austria/]] and [[../Slovenia/]].  In the centre and south of the continent are the [[w:Carpathian Mountains|Carpathian Mountains]].

== Climate of Europe ==

The far north (Iceland, [[../Norway/]], [[../Sweden/]], [[../Finland/]] and [[../Russia/]]) pass through the Arctic Circle which is the area near the North Pole where temperatures can be very low.  Countries to the east and inland of Europe can have very cold winters but those in the west have milder winters because of warmth from the Gulf Stream which brings hotter temperatures.  Southern areas around the Mediterranean Sea can have constantly hot summers and pleasant winters.

== Volcanoes and Other Natural Occurrences in Europe ==
[[Image:EtnaAvió.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Etna, Sicily, Italy erupting]]
Europe has 11 volcanoes.  The second-highest and most famous is Etna in Sicily, Italy at 3,263 metres.  It is well-known for its height, its close location to the major city of Catania and its constant eruptions over the past few years.  Europe's highest volcano is Pico del Teide in the Canary Island, [[../Spain|Spain]].

== Landlocked Countries ==
A landlocked country is a country which has no connection to a sea or ocean.  Countries like [[../Georgia|Georgia]] and [[../Ukraine|Ukraine]] are not landlocked because they have coastlines on the Black Sea.  There are 16 landlocked countries in Europe: [[../Andorra|Andorra]], [[../Armenia|Armenia]], [[../Austria|Austria]], [[../Belarus|Belarus]], [[../Czech Republic|Czech Republic]], [[../Hungary|Hungary]], [[../Kazakhstan|Kazakhstan]], [[../Liechtenstein|Liechtenstein]], [[../Luxembourg|Luxembourg]], [[../Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[../Moldova|Moldova]], [[../San Marino|San Marino]], [[../Serbia|Serbia]], [[../Slovakia|Slovakia]], Switzerland and [[../Holy See|Vatican City]].  Liechtenstein is unique in Europe because it is doubly-landlocked meaning it is both landlocked and surrounded by countries which are also landlocked.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== &quot;Merged&quot; content ==
I've acted on the pending merge request and moved all the information that could be used (I will redirect the merge to the Java book) since there is still much valid content that can be used there or may already be duplicated in the Java book).

I also removed the further reading section. I move it the references here as they can be used to further extend the content in this book.
*[[More C++ Idioms]]
*[http://kent.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/papafactory/PapaFactory-9.06.pdf C++ Abstract Factory] C++ abstract factory design and tutorial
*[http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?HistoryOfPatterns History of Design Patterns]

The remaining content on [[Computer Science Design Patterns]] could be used in the [[Computer Programming]] book if no use is found for it. I'll make a note on that as I re-tag it for merge.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 07:49, 4 February 2011 (UTC)</text>

the point of design patterns is that they are independent of implementation.
Merging is therefore a ''bad idea''.
And yes there are examples in various languages in the text, but they are to illustrate the patterns.
Linking the pages, and moving the language specific examples over to the Java Programming/Design Patterns book is a good idea in keeping with the principles of hypertext. 
That I would vote for .. but not a merge as proposed.

:I was not proposing a final merge (to what you object). I'm only making use of the merge proceedings as to make the process move along and make people aware as to prevent part of the content and the edit history from being lost (please see the post I indicated on the source talk page). That was the reason I kept that part there in the first place, to preserve the data.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 00:07, 2 March 2011 (UTC)
:I posted on the main discussion mentioned above. I am of similar opinion to [[User:VulcanWikiEdit|VulcanWikiEdit]], but I would go as far a saying design pattern examples are an exception to the general rule of where to place example code. For this subject, grouping them together under the specific pattern name is logically correct and increases their usefulness. Then, to avoid duplication add a single link to [[Computer Science Design Patterns]] ''from'' each language. - [[User:Rfrankla|Rfrankla]] ([[User talk:Rfrankla|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Rfrankla|contribs]]) 13:02, 21 April 2014 (UTC)</text>

My first programming language was BASIC: the TS-1000/ZX-81's Sinclair BASIC, then ATARI's BASIC, GWBASIC, and finally MSX BASIC to complete my BASIC adventures.

After that, I learned Pascal (which I consider my first serious PL) at university as a freshman.

Currently, I have delved into C, Java, Ruby &amp; Python. I have to say that I'm really impressed by Python and Ruby.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{book title|Chapter VIII: A Carer copes}}

''Today’s society is changing. Those who are retired – the over sixty-fives, are living longer, fitter, healthier lives. They are taking a greater part in the life of the nation, stimulated by their television, radio, and music player; handling their latest wireless handheld gadget under the tutelage of their grandchildren. Unfortunately living longer gives debilitating illnesses time to take root and grow… especially fatty deposits that thicken the artery lining. One of these common illnesses is multi-infarct (number of small strokes) dementia, which damages the central nervous system (cerebral thrombosis). The present UK population is sixty-two and a half million… over sixteen percent are over sixty-five. It is believed that that will increase to twenty-three percent, by 2034. The disparity between the sexes - of those reaching one hundred, is closing. The figures for all dementia sufferers will rise proportionally - as the aging population grows. No paper on the subject can be devoid of medical terminology… any research exposes descriptions of steps, tests and effects, different, but meaning the same. I hope I have given a layman’s understanding in a way that helps interested readers, sufferers and carers.'' 

===Vascular dementia=== 

This peripheral vascular disease – a disability described as short-term memory loss (impairment of cognitive ability), expresses itself as a mental problem. The illness is mainly age-related although can occur to younger adults. The patient experiences problems associated with: anxiety, depression, panic attacks, muscle-spasms, and convulsions. This paper is directed towards carers looking after aged citizens who have retired from work, and deals with a condition known as: ''''multi-infarct'''' (circulatory matters) ''''vascular'''' (blood related) ''''dementia'''' (brain damaged). There are a number of other diseases and syndromes that can be confused with this complaint. However, a CT scan of the brain, and a number of suitable, clinical, diagnostic tests - day-to-day functionality tests, give signs and symptoms of the illness. The test results are a record of: time needed to make a decision; the concentration afforded to the task, the amount of study given, and the behaviour exhibited afterwards. These investigations give an indication as to which dementia it might be. However, it must be appreciated that early on there are no tests to make a definitive diagnosis - for other under-laying conditions may be present - only time points towards certainty. Changes in behaviour are often remarkably difficult to identify and in this instance the regression is slow.
 
===The Problem===

An individual can age, without being aware that they may be susceptible to vascular dementia. All individuals have inherent weaknesses that can lay dormant, be undetected, until old age degenerates, or the person falls seriously ill. Hereditary illnesses - weaknesses, and physical abnormalities, play a part in every person’s make-up. Some individuals never suffer from vascular dementia until very late in life, others not at all, and some have the problem in middle-age. The problems, when discussing this particular dementia, are the linings of the arteries - that feed blood to the brain. In other dementias the heart and legs are affected. The arteries become coated with fatty deposits (plaques)… which build up and thicken, narrowing the vessel… and over time… harden. The hardened cholesterol, plaque deposits, crack… blood cells (platelets) gather together, forming clots - around the cracks… bits drop off become lodged and the artery becomes choked. The one time free passage of blood is now prevented from feeding the cells with oxygen and nutriments. The progression of fatty build-up in other arteries continues, sufficient to starve more cells. It is believed by neuroscientists that some brain cells can grow new neurons although the growth occurs mostly when young – and then only when receiving the optimum oxygen and nutrients. Once damaged, by blood starvation, however momentary, they die. Aging and stress cause progressive deterioration and impairment, the damaged cell structure cannot reform nor be replaced and the cortex of the brain irreparably damaged.  

===Function of blood===

Blood is the transporter of oxygen to the body’s tissue. It receives oxygen in the lungs which is the function of erythrocytes (red blood cells). Fifty-five percent of the blood is plasma (albumin, globulin and fibrinogen) - the protein, a yellowy coloured fluid… is the medium by which the blood cells are transported round the body - consisting of just over ninety percent water… which diffuses carbon dioxide. The other forty-five percent are the blood cells (electrolytes) - sodium chlorine, potassium, manganese, and carbon irons. The controlled movement of blood (homeostasis): controls body temperature, maintains the correct balance of alkalinity and electrolytes, and carries hormones around the body. The white blood cells are to do with producing anti-bodies, dealing with bacteria, worms, histamine, serotonin, heparin – releasing enzymes; detecting and defending the body’s tissue. It is the lymphocytes within the white cell structure which produce memory cells. As a simple explanation of body needs: food is its nutriments, the liver converts this into energy, bone marrow produces blood cells, the cells: transmit, insulate, protect and nourish; the lungs oxygenates the blood, that produces water… which releases energy; blood transports the cells around the body, the heart pumps the blood, and liver cleans it. It is clear from this simple explanation that anything which restricts the flow of blood is serious.

===Restriction of blood===

Any action or deficiency that restricts the normal flow of blood is serious… These are some illnesses, deficiencies and congenital problems that have a particular link to vascular dementia: heart problems, high blood pressure, irregular heart beats, high cholesterol levels, strokes, hemorrhagic lesions, diabetes (insulin resistance), and damage brain’s cells. Ageing, alcohol consumption, cancer, dietary matters, sedentary life-style, and stress - that reduces neutrophils – allows bacteria to grow, all play a part in the degeneration process. Preventing the free flow of blood exacerbates underlying conditions… many individuals who suffer from a restricted blood-flow eventually experience some form of dementia.

===Psychological effects===

If the flow of blood to the brain is seriously constrained the brain cells do not receive rejuvenating glucose and oxygen and start to die. This process cannot be prevented but can be slowed down. The unpreventable deterioration is observed by the persons: behavioural dysfunction, change of personality, intellectual deterioration, and memory loss. These changes are experienced by: feelings of insecurity, lacking confidence, of being unloved, threatened – not being cared for - being bypassed - left out, and not wanted. The patient lashes out verbally, accusing those nearest of being unfaithful and uncaring.  The unhappy patient gives way to: sleeplessness, jealousy, becomes depressed, feels sad and lonely, starts to become disinterested in food - feels unchallenged and unrewarded… all these depressive feeling reduces self-worth; this further reduces confidence… leads to indecision… and eventually to loss of control.

===Symptoms===

There is a natural loss of memory as a normal process of aging. Dementia is one or a number of mental skills coming on top of the normal degeneration process – affecting short-term memory, concentration, speech, and logical progression. The degeneration, when is does occur, is more obvious when more difficult mental tasks are attempted. Stress, suffered from failure, further pushes the patient’s remaining confidence even lower.  Lapses in memory and reasoning are followed by periods of stability… these give way to further lapses. The gradual downward spiral can be brought up short by a stroke – interruption of blood supply to specific parts of the brain, the results being sudden and permanent: paralysis, speech defect, or seizures. The damage to the vascular system is mainly due to hardening of the arteries… deposits of fatty deposits that restrict the flow of blood… an action that affects the heart (cardiovascular disease, which if blocked causes myocardial infarction - a heart attack); brain (cerebrovascular) disease, blocked arteries causes cerebral thrombosis, and legs (claudication) experience cramps, tingling, numbness, and swollen joints…

===The Brain=== 

Vascular Dementia is to do with a shortage of blood to some brain cells that damage the cortex. The cause is by fatty particles momentarily blocking tiny blood vessels, called the vascular system, carry oxygen and nutriments to the brain. Without the blood’s life giving properties, even for just a few seconds, the receptor cells in the brain die, never to be activated again… the cortex is that part of the brain associated with mental ability – memory, problem solving, control, alertness and behavioural changes. There is no set progression rate for speed of regression; it depends upon which cognitive effect, or effects, are being experienced. The cause of the constriction to the vascular system can be attributed to: a damaged heart, high cholesterol and diabetes. Which of these, and it could be more than one, needs identifying, for remedial help can slow the degeneration? 

===Diagnosis of vascular dementia===

Recognising that you have a mental problem – difficulty managing day-to-day living, sorting out your financial matters, or remembering a sequence of events – is upsetting, disturbing, and notoriously difficult to evaluate. The onset of one or other of these may extend over a long period, to the extent that you may not notice a difference, perhaps you may think it’s just something to put up with – link it to old age, and compensate by being more organized. Your change in behaviour maybe recognised by someone close who can see the difference. Whatever route taken to recognise and accept your deterioration you must do something about it.

There are a number of very good reasons why you should make an effort to find out what the problem is. First, there are chemical procedures that will improve your mental state. These will not present a problem for you to take nor will they remove any other physiological function. There are support groups, and early diagnosis will allow you to make provision for housing, day-to-day living assistance, adapting your life-style and rectifying any bad habits.

===Your first immediate action===

Your mental health concerns will interest your doctor, who will give you a simple question and answer functionality test. His evaluation, if your fears are correct, will suggest a diagnostic screening to make certain of his diagnosis. First though, he will ask for a urine and blood test to check for mineral deficiencies and infections. He may well offer you a low dose of a named sedative for short term relief. The radiologist will carefully compare and observe the scans, checking for imperfections - giving title to your medical condition… this will confirm some, if not all, of your doctor’s opinions. The neurologist may then give you his opinion on the observations of the radiologist - about your nervous system; a geriatrician or psychologist will advise your doctor on the amount of mental impairment using a series of mini-mental state examinations and abbreviated mental tests… Based on these tests and their scores your doctor will confirm the diagnosis and prescribe a course of antidepressants to lower anxiety, this will slow down the degeneration process, taking away some of the stress and anxiety. A psychiatric nurse will visit on a weekly or fortnightly basis to afford security and well-being. 

===Long-term prognosis===

There are two main types of vascular dementia: those caused by a stroke and a small vessel disease where the tiny arteries are partially or totally blocked. There are others where the patient has a combination of these two. Included are a number of other named types all to do with an interruption of blood to the brain. Starving blood to the brain can occur: slowly and evenly, over a relatively long period of time; in a series of intermittent step-by-step actions, or by a sudden heart attack. If the impairment has been caused by a blow to the head, the effect may not be progressive or fatal but prove to be a permanent disability. A caring sympathetic observation of the patient dressing, putting on and tying shoes, washing, flushing the toilet, and problems of incontinence, will indicate where outside help is eventually required. Evaluating these five daily tasks give The Barthel Index of a person’s functionality.  

===Treatment===

All medicines can cause side effects. Taking a new treatment should be carefully monitored by the doctor but if at all possible by the patient and carer as well… noting changes in behavior and physical condition. It is essential that both the doctor and patient discuss the benefits against possible side-effects. The main treatments - tablets or/and drops, are prescribed for depression – feeling nervous, confused, lack of motivation and apathy… panic attacks - sweating – feelings of fear, anxiety, palpitations of the heart, trembling, pins and needles in arms or head, fast shallow breathing and unnecessary worry about feelings of insecurity and agitation. Talking therapy, is as important as chemicals – directed conversation by the carer refreshes memory - stimulates, distracts, and interests, the best daily prescription… Communication is essential to promote consciousness, awareness, and positive sensations. If possible try and encourage the sufferer to jot down daily thoughts, reminders, and feelings, without laying too much emphasis on what is written. Both talking and writing therapy is wearing on the carer for any negative remarks or doubtful disclosures cause depression and sets back any confidence built up. Doing jobs in company with the carer is very beneficial. It is clear that in time the patient has to be closely overseen and a referral sought to find a home to make their safety paramount. Relatives must not be overly worried if their loved one seeks and forms an attachment with another resident. It is the job of the care home to act as chaperon for their charges - to see that the attachment does not get out of hand. The Prime Minister sets out a proactive approach for Dementia Strategy to prevent a crisis. He wishes to push forward early diagnosis for suspected sufferers. The latest treatment Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitors (Achei's) have been produced to slow down the progressive decline principally for Alzheimers but also used in some vascula dementia sufferers. There are four brands which are on the market some in tablet and patch form one given in later stages but now being considered for early treatment in conjunction with other Achei's.

===Welcoming a good death===
You might feel you shouldn’t think about death as that is considered morbid. There is nothing more natural than dying. How often do you hear the remark, “He died a good death.”? What is a good death, what does one have to do to bring that about? By death I mean irreversible brainstem dysfunction where the body cannot be resuscitated.
Being in peaceful surroundings occupying a place of calm where you can maintain self respect and have your wishes respected is the basis of a good death. Leaving behind your personal effects in a tidy state that gives instructions what is to be done when you have departed goes a long way to setting your mind at rest. This preparation for death can be started now. You cannot possibly have everything in order but at least just thinking about it positively, will start the process off. Opening your mind to the possibility of death is recognition of where you are now and how you got there.
Life is a journey along a path leading from your mother’s womb. You receive genes from both your parents that predetermine certain characteristics both mental and physical these continue to grow influenced by nutriments and stimulations peculiar to your time, place and parents, particularly those from your mother. Your upbringing, schooling, work and leisure shape you as an individual. Along the way you form prejudicial opinions, harm others and say unkind things. Whilst you are still alive there is always time to acknowledge these mistakes. Admitting these, even if its only to yourself, is beneficial, doing something about them by seeking forgiveness is by far the hardest part… but how rewarding when you do especially to achieve your goal of a good death.
Writing a Will, appointing an Attorney, filling in an order for your funeral – arranging the sort of farewell service you would like, can be a rewarding experience - highlighting essentials and prioritizing your wishes. When accomplished this will put your mind at rest and may well remind you of happy times, long forgotten friends and mistakes that can be admitted. As the time approaches death try to arrange having a reliable caring friend close by that’ll attend and give notice to your needs. Make sure you acknowledge all your friends and close relatives by remembering their name in your Will mentioning them tells them they have been thought about and not forgotten.
A new concept in caring is a Soul Midwife who will be with you to the end observing your needs, giving comfort and safety. An American counterpart is a Doula Midwife who performs a similar task. Their members give training, advice and guidance. As a pregnant woman during labour needs support so do those who are dying? You may move in and out of consciousness just before your death, before your brain ceases to function so don’t put off last minute wishes. To be able to breathe gently is not always possible so try to concentrate on breathing either by counting your breaths or visualizing blowing up a balloon.
A good vibration copies the song’s lyrics. Atomic particle science and nanotechnology defines life through energy. Anything which keeps the body vibrating strongly – in tune with time and space will be beneficial. The carer should be confident, calmly responsive to the patient’s mood and condition. Life has an affinity to an infinite variety of electromagnetic waves. It is the lack of nutriments, light and air which results in energy loss. The physics of light colour and sound plays an essential part in life.
It would seem clear from those who have been close to those dying a last minute effort is made by the body that is all consuming… this effort leads to a great tiredness that cannot be fought. Holding hands with a loved one, being stroked, kept warm and comfortable as life continues outside the open window… listening to gentle music, are all comforting. The carer may describe the day the music or what is happening outside in gentle tones… a prayer maybe said. As responses fall away a transition occurs which reduces energy, the person passes to peace and well-being, when the soul (a person’s being) is finally freed - given up.--[[Special:Contributions/78.147.159.202|78.147.159.202]] ([[User talk:78.147.159.202|discuss]]) 12:47, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Optimization is the term that is applied to the process in which code is tuned to be better in some respects: either speed, memory consumption, input/output (disk read and writes or network reads and writes), etc. In mathematics, optimization means a process in which one finds the values with the best performance. In computing, where programs are very complex, usually optimizing for speed in the mathematical sense is impossible. Instead the term has come to mean just advancing in the direction of better performance in one or more respects.

This document will focus on optimizing code to run faster. However, as you will see later, doing this may involve having to optimize the code in a different aspect. Furthermore,  often when programmers are trying to optimize one aspect of a program, they are doing so in order to increase speed.

== Intended Audience ==

The intended audience of this article are software developers, primarily programmers who know at least one programming language well enough to write moderately complex programs. If you're interested in becoming involved in the world of software development, refer to the [http://teachingopensource.org/ Teaching Open Source site], and especially the essay [http://teachingopensource.org/index.php/How_to_start_contributing_to_or_using_Open_Source_Software &quot;How to start contributing to or using Open Source Software&quot;] there. Note that not all software developers are programmers, whether those that actively program as part of their job definition, or even those that are qualified to write source code. The essay and the book that is maintained on the site refer to resources about learning how to program in case you're interested in doing that.

Then and only then you can return to this wikibook. 

== Why optimize? ==

So why should we optimize? If you've been using a computer system for a while, and experimented with not-so-&quot;polished&quot; software applications, it is more than likely that you've encountered places where the application annoyed you: it took too long to start; it didn't behave as you expected; there were bugs; it took too long to perform an operation that seemed trivial; it was impossible to cancel an operation; the error messages were cryptic and did not explain how to overcome the issue; the program wouldn't exit; and the list goes on; it caused you to lose data. All these issues likely annoyed and irritated you and made you feel unhappy. With all due respect to the computation power and storage capacities of modern computers and their multi-purpose functionality, computers are still tools in the hand of their masters, the sentient human beings. As a result, they should perform the function that their masters instructed them to as quickly, as correctly and as thoroughly as possible and allow us to continue using them flawlessly for our own work or pleasure, or alternatively take a break from computing and do something else instead of fighting with the computer.

A software component or application that performs its function well, is of high &lt;b&gt;quality&lt;/b&gt; and makes the user feel happy and in control. On the other hand, a software component that is too slow, too buggy, too unstable, etc. lacks the essential &lt;b&gt;quality&lt;/b&gt; and makes the user feel frustrated, miserable, angry, or not in control. No one likes to feel that. 

How to create and maintain software that is high quality in all respects is out of the scope of this article, and the interested reader is directed to a previous installment by the originator as this one titled [http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/computers/high-quality-software/rev2/ &quot;What makes software high quality?&quot;]. This article will focus on the making our software speedy and responsive, which are an important aspect of quality, that is sometimes overlooked.

If our program is too slow or unresponsive (the latter is also known as being &quot;sluggish&quot;), then our user will feel frustrated at it, or get bored while it is running and do something something else. In that case, we should usually  optimize to make sure our program runs quickly enough or is responsive/snappy enough that will make the user happier as he doesn't have to wait for it to finish or respond. We cover more aspects of that below.

== In which programs is optimization required? ==

There are several type of programs in which optimization is required. One type of them is [[wikipedia:Real-time_computing|real time programs]]. Despite common mis-conception, these are not necessarily programs that need to be very fast. Instead real time programs are programs that must respond to certain events within a certain time limit that was dedicated to the event. So for example, if the user presses a keyboard key while inside a word processor window, it should display the character relatively promptly. A 5 seconds delay will be unacceptable and  as such a word processor is a kind of application that has some real-time constraints.

Some parts of real-time systems may need optimization. However, once the time falls below the required delay, no other optimization is necessary. (At least not until testing proves it is again exceeding the limit.)

Other programs that require optimization are programs that cannot be fast enough. Examples for such programs are Artificial Intelligence programs, games, multimedia programs, virtual machines and interpreters for programming languages, or any type of publicly available library or module whose use &quot;in the wild&quot; may necessitate it to be very fast.

Naturally, another type of such programs are programs that are too slow or perceived to be too slow. There usually is no inherent reason for them to be slow, and often nothing prevents such a program from being fast. Such programs that are considered too slow should be optimized to make them run faster.

However, other programs are inherently slow. For example, key-strengthening algorithms are specifically designed to be slow with no known shortcuts. Another example is that copying 8 gigabytes through a a 12 Mbit/s &quot;USB full-speed&quot; port inherently requires more than an hour, due to the constraints of the hardware.

== When to optimize? ==

The rule of the thumb is that one should optimize if the program is not fast enough compared to the desired speed. A common misconception is that if a program is not fast enough now, it will run faster as hardware gets faster. However that is not always the case.

If your program is slow, it is usually because the code is not optimized (such as due to the fact it uses sub-optimal algorithms). While better hardware will usually improve performance, it does not guarantee a noticeable speed increase. Furthermore, while the progress in hardware speed has allowed programmers to write more wasteful code (see [http://www.paulgraham.com/hundred.html Paul Graham's &quot;The Hundred Years Language&quot; essay]), some programs are still excessively slow.

When writing a program on a modern setup, one should make it fast enough already. Some people have claimed that we have already reached the end of [[wikipedia:Moore's_law|Moore's First Law]] in regards to uni-core processors, and we cannot expect single-processed single-threaded program to run faster. In any case, even if the program runs well on a high-end platform, it may still need to run on older hardware.

We've all seen the fact that while computers got faster, software has often become slower to run unless the hardware is upgraded. [[wikipedia:Gates'_Law|The so-called &quot;Gates' Law&quot;]] claims that commercial programs decrease in speed by half every 18 months, due to various reasons. It is well known that the various versions of the [[wikipedia:DOS|DOS]] operating system ran adequately on a PC XT's and 286's and that an Intel 386 was a &quot;lean and mean DOS machine&quot; as a certain journalist noted back then. On the other hand, Microsoft Windows 3.0 and Microsoft Windows 3.1 already required a fast 486 computer to be ran comfortably, while Windows 95 was barely usable there and needed a Pentium computer. Windows XP already ran slowly on a Pentium machine and required a high end Pentium III or Pentium 4 computer. [[wikipedia:Windows Vista|Windows Vista]] requires even more hardware resources than Windows XP, up to the point that many computers in use today cannot run it comfortably.

Now, while software simulations that run directly against the CPU and memory (and possibly hard-disk) are still running much faster than before, the responsiveness of the system itself does not seem to improve much.

== When not to optimize? ==
One should not optimize when the program in question runs fast enough. However, if it also has to run adequately on slower hardware, handle a greater load, or work well with fewer resources at its disposal, then the program might need to be optimized further based on such requirements.

Surprisingly, often profiling reveals that applying a particular optimization technique to a particular program makes it slower.
One should revert to the previous &quot;un-optimized&quot; version of the program in those cases.

=== Optimization vs. Modularity and Readability ===
Optimization may have a bad influence on such code-quality factors as modularity and readability. Consider for example, what the developers of [http://gmplib.org/ GMP (GNU Multi-precision)], wrote in [http://gmplib.org/manual/Introduction-to-GMP.html#Introduction-to-GMP their manual]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The speed of GMP is achieved by using fullwords as the basic arithmetic type, by using sophisticated algorithms, by including carefully optimized assembly code for the most common inner loops for many different CPUs, and &lt;b&gt;by a general emphasis on speed (as opposed to simplicity or elegance)&lt;/b&gt;.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Also consider that short [[wikipedia:Subroutine|functions]] and [[wikipedia:Method_(computer_science)|methods]] are considered preferable over longer methods, to allow for greater code re-use, testing, and self-documentation. (See the [http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ExtractMethod &quot;Extract Method&quot; refactoring pattern]). However, function or method calls are considered a relatively costly operation, and so this extra code-quality, will probably make the program slower. 

Therefore, it's not hard to imagine that a developer who wishes to save some extra cycles will merge a function that gets used only once or a few times into its caller code (or incorporating its code using a [[wikipedia:Macro (computerscience)|macro]], or a preprocessing stage if possible), and therefore making the code less modular.

Similarly, highly optimized code may also become much more unreadable. For example, the C Preprocessor's macros are notorious for making code that uses them unreadable. I heard [http://www.mail-archive.com/linux-il@cs.huji.ac.il/msg15826.html some complaints] that mentioned that [[wikipedia:OpenSSL|OpenSSL]]'s code, which is based on the preprocessor macros, identically named static functions and lots of code-generation is very hard to understand and follow due to these facts.

Similar complaints are constantly voiced against [[wikipedia:XS (Perl)|perl5's XS]], its interface for creating subroutines in ANSI C and other lower-level languages. The API was designed to be as efficient and fast as possible and, as a result, is hard to learn, understand and follow.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Automated tests ==
The first thing you need to do before optimizing is make sure that your code has many automated tests with a good test coverage. Optimizing the code (or any other kind of modification) may break something, and the automated tests will catch that.

== Refactoring ==
The next thing you need to do is to make sure your code is modular. Duplicate code and other properties that make a code non-modular can prevent a clear analysis of the code's bottlenecks by profiling it.

== Profiling ==
Both before and after changing code to &quot;optimize&quot; it, it is important to [[wikipedia:Performance analysis|profile your code using a good software profiler]]. There are [[Wikipedia: list of performance analysis tools| many profiler tools]]. Profiling will help show which code does not take a lot of time to run and therefore it would be best not to invest a lot of optimization effort in it. One should start by optimizing the most time-consuming tasks first. 

It takes some expertise to  knowing how to properly analyze the results given by the profiler, and seeing what needs to be optimized. For example, some IO-intensive routines may appear to consume a lot of time, while in fact that time cannot be effectively eliminated because the amount of IO is minimal (while still being relatively time consuming). I feel that discussing this aspect of profiling further is orthogonal to the mission of this article, so I'm not going to cover it here.

== Code review ==
Finally, it is a good idea that someone will review the code and give general remarks on speed bottlenecks found there. To quote Eric Raymond from [http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/ &quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot;] &quot;Given enough eyeballs, all bugs become shallow&quot;.

== Other ways to optimize ==
Someone who commented on the first draft of this essay, said I was not giving enough focus about profiling and said that &quot;profiling is the only good way to optimize.&quot;. While I agree that one should profile before optimizing, I strongly disagree that the only way to optimize is by profiling first.

For once, it's possible that one will perform accidental optimizations by trying to achieve a different aim. Sometimes I increased Freecell Solver's performance by changing the code in order to overcome running out of stack on Windows NT. Moreover, sometimes a programmer can realize that changing an aspect of the program in a certain way will increase the performance without profiling the code. 

Finally, sometimes profiling the code (at least with the limited tools that one has) does not tell one much. On one of my projects after profiling, the most offending function takes about 15% of the time, with most of the other top candidates taking a few percents. So what should I profile there?

So while profiling is important, it is not the only good way to optimize and sometimes one needs to take different approaches.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What is order of complexity? ==

Generally, an algorithm has an [[wikipedia:Computational complexity theory|asymptotic computational complexity]]. Assuming the input is of size N, we can say that the algorithm will finish at O(N), O(N^2), O(N^3), O(N*log(N)) etc. This means that it is a certain mathematical expression of the size of the input, and the algorithm finishes between two factors of it.

Generally, the smaller the order of complexity of the program's underlying algorithm, the faster it will run and the better it will scale as the input gets larger. Thus, we should often seek more efficient algorithms in order to reduce the order of complexity.

== Some examples for reducing Order of Complexity ==

=== Lookup ===

Let's suppose we're looking for a certain item in a collection of '''N''' items. A naïve algorithm for looking for such an item would be to go over all the items one after the other, and see if they match this item. Then we can stop when we found this item, or declare that it wasn't found if we did not find it.

This is called a [[wikipedia:Linear search|linear search]], and has an average (and worst-case) complexity of O(N). Now, if we're going to do such a naïve lookup many times, then it will cost us O(N) every time. And this is usually unacceptable.

A better idea would be to use a more efficient lookup. For example, a [[wikipedia:Binary search|Binary search]] is O(log(N)). It assumes we keep the existing items in a sorted array, or in a balanced tree. A [[wikipedia:Hash table|Hash table]] is a heuristic that with a good design of its underlying parameters provides an '''average''' O(1) lookup, but often O(log(N)) is good enough.

==== Case study for Lookup - the Freecell Solver States Collection ====

[http://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/ Freecell Solver] is a library written in [[wikipedia:ANSI C|ANSI C]] that solves deals of [[wikipedia:FreeCell|FreeCell]] and similar &quot;full-knowledge&quot; Solitaire games. Freecell Solver used traditional [[wikipedia:Game artificial intelligence|Game artificial intelligence]] heuristics from the beginning such as [[wikipedia:Depth-first search|Depth-First Search]] and [[wikipedia:Best-first search|Best-First Search]]. As a result, there was a need to maintain a collection of the previously encountered board positions (or &quot;states&quot;) so they won't be checked twice.

The very first version of the solver (written in [[wikipedia:Perl|Perl]]) used a linear search over an array. That proved to be too slow to be effective to solve even the most elementary deals. Afterwards, the program was re-implemented in C, and used a sorted array, with a &quot;sort margin&quot; that was sorted using ANSI C's [http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/clibrary/cstdlib/qsort.html qsort's function], which performs the [[wikipedia:Quick Sort|Quick Sort]] algorithm, or a different efficient sorting algorithm, at an average complexity of O(N*log(N)), giving the program an average lookup of O(log(N)) and an accumulated addition of between O(N*log(N)) and O(N^2). 

Later versions made optional use of two [[wikipedia:Balanced Binary Tree|Balanced Binary Trees]] libraries: [http://www.stanford.edu/~blp/avl/ libavl] and [http://libredblack.sourceforge.net/ libredblack], which have a maximal O(log(N)) lookup and insertion and an accumulative O(N*log(N)) run-time. Sometimes later, a custom hash table was coded, whose run-time was even somewhat faster than the balanced binary trees, and had an '''average''' run-time of O(N). This hash was later further optimized using micro-optimizations.

=== Counting Sort instead of Comparison-Based Sort ===

Normal comparison-based sort algorithms such as [[wikipedia:Quick Sort|Quick Sort]], [[wikipedia:Merge Sort|Merge Sort]] or [[wikipedia:Heap Sort|Heap Sort]] run at O(N*log(N)). This is much better than naïve comparison-based algorithms such as &quot;Insertion Sort&quot;, or &quot;Bubble Sort&quot; which run at O(N^2). However, we can improve upon O(N*log(N)) too, in some cases.

One of them is if the keys in question are, or can be mapped to integers in a certain range. In this case, we can use an algorithm such as [[wikipedia:Counting sort|&quot;Counting Sort&quot;]], to sort at a time of roughly O(N). We can also try using [[wikipedia:Radix sort|&quot;Radix sort&quot;]] along with counting sort, if we have more than one such &quot;digit&quot; in the radix (as long as their number remain constant).

On the other hand, sometimes using Insertion Sort is preferable over Merge Sort or Quick Sort, if the number of elements being sorted is very small, as the latter algorithms have a lot of overhead.

=== Joel Spolsky's Schlemiel the Painter's Syndrome ===

In his [http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000319.html article &quot;Back to Basics&quot;], Joel Spolsky illustrates a common (and unnecessary) pattern that increases the complexity of programs. Essentially, when one does in C:

   char string[1000];
   strcpy (string, &quot;One &quot;);
   strcat (string, &quot;Two &quot;);
   strcat (string, &quot;Three &quot;);
   strcat (string, &quot;Four &quot;);
   .
   .
   .

And so forth, then the strcat calls will keep starting from the beginning of the string and seek the (increasing) end times and again. As a result, the complexity of appending N strings each with a limited length, becomes O(N^2) instead of O(N).  

Eliminating such problematic mis-implementations in the code can yield a substantial speed-increase.

== Note about Order-of-Complexity Reduction ==

It should be noted that some algorithms with a proven lower Big-O notation than equivalent ones, are either too complicated to be effectively implemented or have a huge runtime factor that will make them impractical for most reasonable data-sets, or both. For example, there's an algorithm for finding the Median (= middle element) of an array in linear (O(N)) time, that was discovered in the nineties, but it's very complex and has a very large linear factor, so that an efficient O(N*Log(N)) sorting would normally be faster. That and we are very often interested in the Median for optimizing sorting, and so it would make sense not to use this algorithm in the first place.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What are Factor Optimizations? ==

Factor Optimizations are the opposite of order of complexity optimizations: they don't change the overall complexity of the algorithm, but rather make it run faster by a certain factor. As an extreme (but not so unrealistic) example, I may increase the formula for calculating the time that my program runs from 5 seconds times N^2 (where N is the length of the input) to 1 second times N^2. One can see that we increase the optimization by a certain factor, and still don't handle potential scalability problems.

== The Motivation for Factor Optimizations ==

Are factor optimizations worth-your-time? Some people don't seem to think so. For example Eric Raymond has [http://catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/ch12s01.html this to say in &quot;The Art of Unix Programming&quot;]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
One is the exponential effect of Moore's Law — the smartest, cheapest, and often fastest way to collect performance gains is to wait a few months for your target hardware to become more capable. Given the cost ratio between hardware and programmer time, there are almost always better things to do with your time than to optimize a working system.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We can get mathematically specific about this. It is almost never worth doing optimizations that reduce resource use by merely a constant factor; it's smarter to concentrate effort on cases in which you can reduce average-case running time or space use from O(n^2) to O(n) or O(n log n),[112] or similarly reduce from a higher order. Linear performance gains tend to be rapidly swamped by Moore's Law.[113]
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Randall Hyde presents an opposing view in [http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2004/05/06/writegreatcode.html his OnLAMP.com feature, &quot;Why Learning Assembly Language is Still a Good Idea&quot;]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Most of the time you can achieve very good performance boosts by simply improving the implementation of an existing algorithm. A computer scientist may argue that a constant improvement in performance isn't as good as, say, going from an algorithm with O(n^2) performance to one with O(n lg n) performance, but the truth is that most of the time a constant factor of two or three times improvement, applied throughout a piece of software, can make the difference between a practical application and one that is simply too slow to comfortably use. And it is exactly this type of optimization with which most modern programmers have little experience.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

So which viewpoint is correct? I tend to think that Raymond is wrong, while Hyde is correct. The factors in which your program is running are still important, and can make a world of difference. Some factor optimizations may yield huge benefits and will make you and your users happier.

Raymond is also misled because one cannot expect their end-users to upgrade their machines. Furthermore, it seems that we've [http://www.gotw.ca/publications/concurrency-ddj.htm hit the end of the linear CPU speed increase] for Semiconductor-based CPUs, and that we cannot expect a linear code to become faster with new hardware. Highly parallelized code may become faster, but parallelization is not always possible, or desirable.

[http://www.mail-archive.com/linux-il@cs.huji.ac.il/msg27751.html Another illustrative story] about why it's not a good idea to depend on Moore's law to speed up your code was posted by Gilboa Davara to the Linux-IL mailing list. Quoting from there while editing for coherency:

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A couple of years ago I worked for a medical software development company. I was working on the database development side. (We had our own proprietary object oriented database)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Our database was pretty cool; it could handle an hospital level load on a dual Pentium Pro machine. (Which was a far cry from most big iron machines that were used back then.)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Our medical software side used PowerBuilder (and later VB) to develop
the medical applications. To put it mildly, the medical application itself, was by far, slower and
heavier then the medical database that it was built upon. While 50 clients could run easily on a Pentium I 90 MHz with 32MB of RAM , the medical application ran very slowly on a Pentium I 166 MHz with 64MB of RAM machine!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
And every-time we pointed this anomaly to the med team, they claimed
that &quot;new machines are bound, new CPUs; by the time we are out, CPU
power won't be an issue.&quot;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
You know what, that med software now runs slower than a dead dog on a top-level Pentium 3 / Pentium 4 / Athlon machine… nothing has changed.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Are &quot;Small&quot; Optimizations Desirable? ===

Should we invest time working on optimizations that only save us 5 seconds (or fewer) out of the total run? Is a 5% increase in speed desirable? Some people are likely to say &quot;no&quot; to these questions, but the answer is not as straightforward. For example, Bill Raymond has written a solver for [[wikipedia:FreeCell|FreeCell]] that can [http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/fc-solve-discuss/message/584 reportedly solve 10,000,000 deals per hour on a 733 MHz computer] and he [http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/fc-solve-discuss/message/222 testified that]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I achieved my fast times by multitudes of 1% reductions.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From my experience working on [http://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/ my own solver] (which is open-source and has a public version control repository), I was able to [http://code.google.com/p/fc-solve/source/browse/fc-solve/trunk/fc-solve/benchmarks/log.txt gradually reduce the run-time of a certain benchmark over time] from 224 seconds down to 94 seconds (an improvement of 138% percent) just by shaving off a few seconds at a time and doing many different optimizations. [http://community.livejournal.com/shlomif_tech/20200.html In a blog post], I further explain how I quadrupled the performance of the &quot;File-Find-Object&quot; Perl 5 module by applying many small optimisations.

As a result, one should not rule out that even &quot;small&quot; optimisations are negligible and should not be pursued. It takes just four 20% speed increases to double the speed of your program, and while the yield of each small optimisation is not very dramatic, such increases adds up to a lot pretty quickly. On the other hand if you don't apply any small optimisations to your code, and instead wait for the pot at the end of the rainbow, then your code is likely to stay only as fast (or as slow) as it is presently.

=== Examples for Factor Optimizations ===

==== Managing Pointers to Structs Instead of the Structs Themselves ====

If we have a collection of many C/C++-structs (structures that contain an adjacent number of elements of possibly different data types), then swapping two such structs (say for re-ordering or sorting) will require a lot of memory access. On the other hand if we manage pointers to such structures, with permanent addresses, then swapping two 32-bit or 64-bit pointers will be relatively cheap.

The first ANSI C release (0.2.0) of Freecell Solver allocated a direct array of large C-structs, and then sorted them and binary searched them. In the 0.4.0 release, an array of pointers to individually-malloc()-ed structs was implemented instead, which resulted in a huge boost of speed. This taught me a valuable lesson on how to make a smart use of pointers as an optimization tool.

==== Reducing Memory Consumption ====

The more memory an application, or its individual elements consumes, the more cache misses it has, the more page swapping it requires, and it becomes more probable for data to require more than one cache line. As a result, reducing the size of a program can often lead to speed benefits.

As [http://www.mail-archive.com/linux-il@cs.huji.ac.il/msg07076.html documented in a post to Linux-IL], when Freecell Solver was converted from representing cards as 32-bit values, and converted to representing them using 8-bit octets, it became much faster. This is likely due to less swapping, due to less cache misses, and because more cards could fit in the Pentium's 32-byte cache row.

[http://lwn.net/Articles/82495/ The &quot;Cost of Inline Functions&quot; LWN.net story] is also illustrative. When one function in the Linux kernel was un-inlined, it made the kernel somewhat faster. The reason was that all of the inlined instances of it occupied a (relatively) large amount of memory per-instance, and as a result, the kernel was larger, and there were more cache misses.

===== Note about the Memory-Speed Tradeoff =====

After reading what was written here, you may think this contradicts the common Memory-Speed Trade-off &quot;truism&quot;. The Memory/Speed Trade-off has its origins in theoretical computer science, where it is shown that for certain tasks, one can reduce the run-time's asymptotic complexity by increasing the asymptotic amount of memory used (and vice versa). For example, we can sometimes reduce the asymptotic run-time from O(N^2) to O(N) by increasing the memory from O(1) to O(N). 

This is all nice and true, but it doesn't contradict the fact that given the architecture of contemporary computer hardware and operating systems, the less memory a program uses (while the logic of the algorithm remains the same) - the faster it will probably run. It's not an asymptotic trade-off, but rather a gain-gain situation.

==== Parallelization ====

By [[wikipedia:Parallel computing|parallelizing]] a task, one can split it into several lines-of-executions (processes, threads, tasks on different computers in the cluster, etc.) that each will run in parallel. As a result, the complete task itself will hopefully finish faster. A good example for parallelization is performing the same time-consuming operation on a lot of inputs. If we assign different processes subsets of the inputs, then they will likely finish it faster.

Lately, parallelization has become especially attractive for making code run faster due to the advancement of multi-core CPUs. However, it should be noted that parallelization is still limited by some factors such as locking, serialization and de-serialization of the inter-process data, context-switching, CPU and operating system-constraints, and the fact that often the number of tasks will exceed the number of available processors. Most importantly, [[wikipedia:Amdahl's law|Amdahl's law]] rules that the serial part of the task (by definition) cannot be parallelized, and so limits the amount of gain from the parallelization.

==== Putting the Most Important struct Members First ====

In the Linux kernel the order of the struct members is ordered so the most important members fit within the Pentium architecture's 32-byte cache line size. This way, access to the struct in general is sped up because all of its members remain in the cache line most of the time and can be accessed more quickly.

==== Copy-on-write ====

Another useful optimization is known as [[wikipedia:Copy-on-write|copy-on-write]]. A good example for this is when implementing a virtual machine for a programming language, and where we assign a variable to another one. While we can duplicate the contents of the variable each time, it would be cheaper to just increase the reference count, and wait for one of the variables to change before they are separated.

If the contents of the copies are significant, then copy-on-write can yield significant savings in time.

==== Caching ====

If we perform many costly queries, then caching commonly-issued queries along with the results we got in memory is likely to increase the overall performance of the program. Caching is implemented in all kinds of software - from operating system kernels that hold recently-accessed file-system entries in cache, to database servers that keep caches of the various stages of the queries given to them.

There's a variation on caching called [[wikipedia:Memoization|Memoization]], in which we never relieve of our results. It can be demonstrated that by memoizing the naïve (tree-recursive) Fibonacci-number calculation, one can actually reduce its complexity from an exponential one to a linear one.

One should note that caching or memoization cannot be done in many cases, for example, if the queries have most kinds of side-effects.

==== Avoiding Copying Altogether ====

[http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/hackers-il/message/2517 This Hackers-IL Post] gave the case for avoiding unnecessary copying of objects in order to increase performance. Calling copy constructors excessively can have a negative impact on performance, and reducing the number of calls to a minimum can improve performance. Just copying a large contiguous area in memory, several times, may have a negative effect on performance and eliminating it, may also turn out to be beneficial.

==== Inline Functions ====

Despite what was said earlier, in the context of reducing memory consumption, inlining functions in languages such as C or C++ can often have a positive effect on performance. Function calls are costly operations, and have a lot of overhead, and avoiding the function call by inserting the code in-place whenever the function is used, can increase performance. Inline functions become more and more beneficial the shorter they are, and if the memory occupied by the in-place calls is smaller than the memory used without inlining.

If you are unsure whether inlining a certain function has a positive or negative effect, then benchmark and see.

==== The Schwartzian Transform ====

The [[wikipedia:Schwartzian transform|Schwartzian transform]] is a way to optimize certain kinds of comparison-based sort operations. If the keys of the function that we want to compare take a lot of time to calculate (such as if they require access to the hard-disk), then we can first prepare an equivalent array with pairs of the inputs and their keys, then sort the pairs based on the keys, and finally filter only the original inputs from the pairs.

It should be noted that the Schwartzian transform actually reduced the order of complexity of the number of times the keys are calculated from O(N*log(N)) to O(N). However, the overall order of complexity of the sort remains O(N*log(N)). 

=== Call for a Catalog of Optimizations ===

I believe it would be a good idea to concentrate all the known optimizations in one place, in a similar fashion to the [http://www.refactoring.com/catalog/ Catalog of Refactorings] and the [[wikipedia:Portland Pattern Repository|Portland Pattern Repository]]. This would be a list that people can read for completeness, and to realize where their code can be improved, and for general inspiration, and to facilitate communication.

I'm not aware of a similar effort as of the time of this writing, and it will be useful. This section only covered a very small subset of the possible optimization strategies, just to give a taste of them, and did not aim to be comprehensive.

      <comment>Changed &quot;Assembler&quot; (a program) to &quot;Assembly&quot; (the language).</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Often the original choice of programming languages, or libraries can affect the execution speed, because they are not very optimized, too bloated, or otherwise too slow. Moving to a different programming language or library, including possibly replacing third-party code with your own, may have a positive effect on one's program's speed.

For example, if you're doing a lot of number-crunching code in dynamic, P-code languages such as Perl, Python or Ruby (at least without utilizing such APIs as [http://pdl.perl.org/ PDL] or [http://www.scipy.org/ SciPy]) or otherwise your code involves many loops and conditionals, then you can expect it to run slower than if it was written in C or Assembly.

Similarly, I found that [[wikipedia:GLib|GLib]]'s balanced binary trees performed more poorly than those of libavl and libredblack, and that its hash performed more poorly than my own custom hash (which was since then optimized further). As a result, eliminating a dependency on GLib's data structures may improve the performance of the program.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&quot;There ain't no such thing as a free lunch&quot;. The more features your program has, the more code is required to implement them, which in turn consumes more memory, and slows things down. Furthermore, it requires more conditionals and often even loops, which also require extra processing. Thus, by removing features from one's application, one can have faster code.

For example, in [http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/APIWar.html &quot;How Microsoft Lost the API War&quot;], Joel Spolsky tells that Microsoft has gone to great lengths to maintain bug-to-bug (binary) backward compatibility for their Windows-line of operating system. As a result, buggy software that relied on API quirks that got changed, often could still work in later versions of Windows, because Microsoft made sure that Windows supplied them with a similar environment. As a result of maintaining all of this backward compatibility, there was more code in Microsoft's products, which may have contributed to the common and notorious perception that they became slower with each release.

== Optimizing by Introducing Bugs ==
Furthermore, we can say that often bug fixes (for example boundary checks, sanity checks, etc.) will have a negative influence on the program's performance, and as a result not fixing these bugs or introducing new bugs is also a possible way to optimize (but not a very recommended one).

== Optimizing by Compromising on Security ==
I can go further than that, and claim that one can often optimize one's code by compromising on its security. The less sanity checks, input checks, etc. a code has - the faster it will run. For example, a code that does not have a lot of checking for the failure (and graceful handling) of dynamic memory allocation calls (in languages such as C without managed programming) such as &lt;tt&gt;malloc()&lt;/tt&gt;, will run faster. (Until and if it runs out of memory and then crashes.)

I read somewhere that [http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/hackers-il/message/1688 programmers complained that checking and handling errors in their programs made them have to write about 4 times more code], which makes sense. All this code slows the program down when everything runs as expected.

Note that &quot;Here be dragons&quot;. It's probably never a good idea to compromise on security in order to increase speed. But I've mentioned it here for completeness sake.

      <text xml:space="preserve">When I mentioned this article to some people on IRC (while it was still incomplete), someone said that &quot;The first rule of optimization is 'Don't!'&quot;. I think such attitude is harmful. While I agree that &quot;premature optimization is the root of all evil&quot;, sometimes one's code is just too slow and needs to be optimized. And if your code is what [http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/FiveWorlds.html Joel Spolsky calls &quot;Shrinkwrap&quot;] (i.e: code that is sold or otherwise distributed and made available for public consumption) then you can often not make assumptions on how fast it needs to be, and the faster it is - the better.

Speed and optimizing other resources are one important factor [http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/computers/high-quality-software/ in the general, abstract quality of programs]. If your program is slow, it is likely going to make your users frustrated and unhappy, which will be a failure in your mission as a software developer. So it is important that your program is fast enough, if not very much so.

My aim in this document was to explain the &quot;why&quot;'s, &quot;what&quot;'s and to a lesser extent &quot;how&quot;'s of optimization. I hope I was successful, and that people who read it will be more willing to optimize their software and more clueful in how to do so. 

== Further Reading ==

[[wikipedia:Jon Bentley|Jon Bentley]] discussed various kinds of optimisations extensively in the book ''Programming Pearls 2nd Edition'' ISBN 0-201-65788-0. which is a very recommended read. He also recommends there his out-of-print book ''Writing Efficient Programs'' ISBN 0-13-970244-X for more discussion on the subject. There's also a lot of discussion on optimisation in the book ''The Algorithm Design Manual, 2nd Edition'' ISBN 978-1848000698.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Morley's triangle''' was discovered by Frank Morley in 1899.

Take any triangle and trisect its three angles.  These trisectors define a smaller triangle inside the first one, known as the '''Morley's triangle''' of that triangle.  It is always equilateral.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==How To Use This Glossary==
This glossary is organized alphabetically, with all defined terms on the left in '''''bold italics''''', and all terms used in the definition that are also defined in the glossary are in '' italics''. The definition is then given, then a brief explanation of the word's etymology, if applicable, and then synonyms or antonyms.

===Notes===

* At some later date words in ''italics'' may be linked to their respective definition, but at the moment, that is not a priority. 

*If you want to add a definition, please at least put it in the proper alphabetical place, even if you don't provide a complete definition. 

*Please do not give the definition given by any other source, but compile it based on your personal knowledge. This is to reduce the risk of suit for copyright infringement.

*The author is not concerned with providing perfect definitions for words at the moment. If any good Samaritan comes along and notices something that they can improve, '''I beg them to please do so!'''

==A==

*'''''action potential''''' -- 'wave' that moves along an ''axon'' in response to a ''stimulus''. An action potential may be either ''afferent'' or ''efferent'', depending on its source.

*'''''adrenaline rush''''' -- a rush of energy that permeates the body when extreme danger is sensed. This response is mediated by the sympathetic division, and is antagonistic to the workings of the parasympathetic division. The actual 'rush' is caused by a release of ''epinephrine'' ''(adrenaline)'' and ''norepinephrine'' from the ''adrenal glands''.

*'''''afferent''''' -- referring to an ''action potential'' that does not originate in the ''central nervous system'', but instead originates in the ''sensory receptors'' of the ''peripheral nervous system''.

*'''''anterior''''' -- to the front. Synonymous with ''ventral''.

*'''''autonomic division''''' -- the nervous system division responsible for autonomous tasks like blinking, breathing, heartbeat and vascular control. It is not under conscious control, and therefore it cannot be controlled by thought.

==B==
*'''''Brain''''' -- the primary neurological center of the body.

*'''''Brainstem''''' -- the thin, tapering portion of the ''brain'' attached to the ''spinal cord'', responsible for coordinating ''autonomic'' muscle movements, such as breathing, heart beat, walking, etc.

*'''''Broca's area''''' --

==C==

*'''''cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)''''' -- the thick, cushy, nutrient dense fluid that surrounds vital neurological organs, including the ''brain''. CSF provides the organs and cells of the central nervous system with nutrients, protects them from shock and trauma, lubricates the sides of the cranial cavity, and helps cool the organs of the CNS.

*'''''central nervous system (CNS)''''' -- the control and integration sections of the nervous system, comprised of the ''brain'' and ''spinal cord''. It receives ''stimuli'' from the ''peripheral nervous system'', integrates and interprets those stimuli, and the sends the orders to execute an appropriate response to the stimulus

*'''''cephalization''''' -- the gradual expansion of the ''rostral'' portion of the ''central nervous system'', including increases in the number of ''neurons'' and ''ganglia'', and an increase in the blood flow to the associated areas. Cephalization is believed to increase ''intelligence'' in affected organisms, reaching it's pinnacle in the human brain.

*'''''contralateral''''' -- ''anatomical term'' referring to anything on the opposite side of the body, in relation to a ''midsagittal'' ''section''. Antonym of ''ipsilateral''.

*'''''cranial nerves''''' -- the 12 pairs of cranial nerves are ''nerves'' that link the various ''senses'' of the ''PNS'' to the ''brain'', in the ''CNS''.

==D==
*'''''diencephalon''''' --

==E==

*'''''effector''''' -- any organ, muscle or gland that performs an action upon reception of an ''action potential'' originating in the ''central nervous system''.

*'''''efferent''''' -- refers to any ''action potential'' originating in the ''central nervous system'' that gives orders to an ''effector'' to perform an action in response to a ''stimulus''.

==F==
==G==
==H==
==I==
*'''''ipsilateral''''' -- ''anatomical term'' referring to anything that is on the same side of the body, in relation to a ''midsagittal'' ''section''. Antonym of ''contralateral''.

==J==
==K==
==L==
*'''''limbic system''''' --

==M==
*'''''mesencephalon''''' --
*'''midsagittal section''' --

==N==
*'''''necrotic''''' -- dead.

==O==
*'''''organism''''' -- any living thing.

==P==
*'''''peripheral nervous system''''' -- the portion of the ''nervous system'' responsible for the reception of ''stimuli'', and the subsequent transfer of those stimuli to the ''central nervous system''.

*'''''pons''''' -- the portion of the ''brain stem'' that attaches to the underside of the ''brain'', thus allowing communication between the brain and the rest of the body. 'Pons' is Latin for 'bridge'.

==Q==
==R==
*'''''rostral''''' -- rostral is an ''anatomical term'' referring to the front or foremost part of an ''organ'' or ''appendage''. The word stems from Latin 'rostrum', or 'beak, nose'. Synonym to ''anterior''.

==S==
*'''''somatic division''''' -- the nervous system division under conscious control. Most skeletal muscles are under conscious control.

*'''''spinal nerves''''' -- the 31 pairs of spinal nerves connect to the ''spinal cord'' on either side all along its length, sending information from many ''afferent'' sources to be interpreted in the ''brain''.

*'''''stimulus''''' -- anything that elicits a ''response'' from an ''organism''.

==T==
*'''''terminal''''' --

==U==
==V==
*'''''ventral''''' -- to the front. Synonymous with ''anterior''. Typically used in veterinary medicine to refer to the underside of an animal.

==W==
*'''''Wernicke's area''''' --

==X==
==Y==
==Z==

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What Is Neuroscience?==
Neuroscience is the study of the anatomy, physiology, and pathology of the nervous system. Its aim is to understand and predict things that have their roots in the nervous system, namely emotions, reflexes, choices and memory.

==Who Uses Neuroscience?==
Many health care professionals require knowledge of the nervous system to performs their daily jobs. There are many diseases that originate in the nervous system, for instance Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, Autism, and Multiple Sclerosis. In addition to normal health care professional, professional neurologists and psychologists require extensive knowledge of the nervous system in order to diagnose and treat various neurological disorders.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The brain is a rather unassuming organ. It's hard to believe that about two fist fulls of quivery, grayish-pink matter of a custard like consistency is the seat of consciousness and control for our bodies. In fact, the human brain is the most vital organ we possess, but also the most delicate. 

==Regions and Organization==

The brain has three main divisions based on function: the '''''cerebrum''''', the '''''cerebellum''''', and the '''''brain stem'''''. These parts of the brain each carry out different functions in the grand symphony that is thought and action.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''''cerebrum''''' is the large, main part of the brain, which serves as the main thought and control center. It is the seat of 'higher level' thought, like '''''emotions''''' and '''''decision making''''', as opposed to 'lower level' thought, like balance, movements, and reflexes.  

The wrinkly, gray outer covering of the cerebrum is called the '''''cerebral cortex''''', and is made up of layers of neurons with many, many inputs; these cortical neurons function like mini microprocessors or logic gates, and while the cortex is less than 1/4&quot; thick, it is here that all sensation, perception, memory, association, thought, and voluntary physical actions occur. 

The inside of the cerebrum beneath the cortex is comprised of '''''white matter''''', which are myelinated neurons that carry information from one part of the brain to another.

The cerebrum is divided by the '''''longitudinal fissure''''' into a '''''right hemisphere''''' and a '''''left hemisphere'''''. These hemispheres each have their own unique 'persona', if you will. People who are described as being more 'right brained', are more intuitive, whereas people who are more 'left brained' are more logical. 
Each cerebral hemisphere perceives and controls the opposite side of the body.

The cerebrum is further divided into 5 separate '''''lobes''''' or regions, based upon what cranial bone is over the selected area, except for the Insula, which is cortical tissue buried beneath the junction of the frontal and temporal lobes.

* [[/The Frontal Lobe/]]
* [[/The Temporal Lobe/]]
* [[/The Parietal Lobe/]]
* [[/The Occipital Lobe/]]
* [[/The Insula/]]

==+Administrator== 
I would like to apply for admin-ship of Wiki Junior. What shall I do? 
Thanks,
--[[User:Achlochan]]  
:These tools are not something that the community hands out to just anyone who asks.  Rather, the tools are granted to those who have operated here for a while and have demonstrated that the community can invest trust in them.  You have made two edits here, both of which were to make this request.  Clearly we have nothing upon which to base such trust.  If you wish to serve as an administrator here, you need to participate as an editor first.  It will take time for that trust to be established. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 13:53, 11 January 2011 (UTC)

I would like to request permission to upload a book: Real Estate Financing and Investment. This book is licensed under the Creative Commons and GNU at its original location here: http://worldacademyonline.com/book/real_estate_financing_and_investing/. I have also uploaded this to the Wiki Commons here: http://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=File:Real_Estate_Financing_and_Investment.tif&amp;page=2

Please let me know how I can make this book available on Wikibooks. Thanks, --[[User:SarahPats]]

: You don't need to upload the tif version again, as the Wikimedia Commons file is accessible directly from here. What does need to be done is the tif version needs to be converted into wiki text form to allow anyone to easily edit it and maintain it. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 11:47, 10 January 2011 (UTC)

:::Thanks for the information. That's good to know. I am sorry if this question is quite basic, but how do I edit the tif file as a wiki text? Thanks, --[[User:SarahPats]]

::::You (or someone) will need to run the TIF file through a TIF to text (usually PDF) piece of software. Otherwise known as an OCR (optical character recognition) tool. Once that's been done, the text will need to be copied across... I may have a chance to look at doing this during the week. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 11:59, 10 January 2011 (UTC)

::::Thanks for the information. I have googled how to do this and, while it sounds difficult, I will have a go at it! We'll see how long this takes me though! Thanks, --[[User:SarahPats]]

:::::I have converted it into a PDF (well, 85 of them actually, one for each page). Just need to upload it all. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 13:25, 10 January 2011 (UTC)

:::::That was very very fast. I havent even gotten to downloading the software for this and youre all done! ok, well thank you very very much for the help. Let me know if there is anything else that I need to do to get this book shared on Wikibooks! Thank you! --[[User:SarahPats]]

::::::As QuiteUnusual mentioned, what he has done resulted in PDFs of images... which means that what is needed is OCR, Optical Character Recognition. What I can do is take either the TIFFs or QU's PDFs, and run them through some OCR software I work with at my day job. OCR is only 95-99% accurate, so it will need a lot of correction, but I can put the stuff here if you want -- you will need to edit it to make it make sense. Let me see what I can come up with... [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 06:51, 25 January 2011 (UTC)

::::::Actually, it looks to be simpler to copy it from the original source. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:59, 25 January 2011 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Customer focus (alpha = 0.72) ==
=== Description ===

Through a detailed analysis of the literature, twelve constructs of integrated quality management strategies were identified: [[Handbook of Management Scales/Top management commitment|top management commitment]], customer focus, [[Handbook of Management Scales/Supplier quality management|supplier quality management]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Design quality management|design quality management]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Benchmarking|benchmarking]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Statistical process control usage|SPC usage]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Internal quality information usage|internal quality information usage]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Employee empowerment|employee empowerment]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Employee involvement|employee involvement]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Employee training|employee training]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Product quality|product quality]], and [[Handbook of Management Scales/Supplier performance|supplier performance]]. Using a survey of 371 manufacturing firms, the constructs were then empirically tested and validated. For this purpose a confirmatory factor analysis approach was used.

=== Items ===

*Manufacturing managers are aware of the results of customer satisfaction surveys.
*A summary of customer complaints is given to manufacturing managers regularly.
*To achieve greater customer satisfaction, our company actively seeks ways to improve our primary product.
*Our company has been customer focused for the past two years.

== Process management (composite reliability = 0.89) ==
=== Description ===

The authors identify improvement and innovation as two critical plant level capabilities. These capabilities are each conceptualized as a second-order factor and measured through a distinct bundle of routines. The following routines underlying improvement capabilities are identified: [[Handbook of Management Scales/Continuous improvement|continuous improvement]], process management, and [[Handbook of Management Scales/Leadership involvement in quality|leadership involvement in quality]]. The routines closely related to improvement capability are: [[Handbook of Management Scales/Search for new technologies|search for new technologies]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Cross-functional product design|cross-functional product design]], and [[Handbook of Management Scales/Processes and equipment development|processes and equipment development]]. The items to measure each routine were selected based on a review of the relevant literature. Items were included that have been used in prior studies. A panel of five academic researchers and managers with expertise in manufacturing operations reviewed each of the items.

=== Definition ===

Process management is based on the view that an organization consists of systems of interrelated processes. It typically involves efforts to map, improve, and adhere to organizational processes.

=== Items ===

*A large percent of the processes on the shop floor are currently under statistical quality control.
*We make extensive use of statistical techniques to reduce variance in processes.
*We use charts to determine whether our manufacturing processes are in control.
*We monitor our processes using statistical process control.

== Supplier quality management (alpha = 0.78) ==
=== Description ===

Through a detailed analysis of the literature, twelve constructs of integrated quality management strategies were identified: [[Handbook of Management Scales/Top management commitment|top management commitment]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Customer focus|customer focus]], supplier quality management, [[Handbook of Management Scales/Design quality management|design quality management]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Benchmarking|benchmarking]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Statistical process control usage|SPC usage]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Internal quality information usage|internal quality information usage]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Employee empowerment|employee empowerment]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Employee involvement|employee involvement]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Employee training|employee training]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Product quality|product quality]], and [[Handbook of Management Scales/Supplier performance|supplier performance]]. Using a survey of 371 manufacturing firms, the constructs were then empirically tested and validated. For this purpose a confirmatory factor analysis approach was used.

=== Items ===

Answer with respect to a critical component of the primary product.

*Quality is a more important criterion than price in selecting suppliers of the major component.
*Our supplier rating system considers the supplier’s engineering capability.
*Our supplier rating system considers the supplier’s financial stability.
*Our supplier rating system considers the supplier’s delivery performance.
*We provide technical assistance to our suppliers of this component.
*We are more interested in developing a long-term relationship with these suppliers than reducing prices.

 __TOC__
 &lt;/noinclude&gt;

Ada '''streams'''  are a  powerful I/O mechanism that allows reading and writing any type of object to any type of &quot;''medium''&quot; (e.g., a network connection, a file on a disk, a magnetic tape, a memory buffer).  Streams are somewhat obscure for a beginner; this is because of the &quot;double generality&quot;: generality about the object to be written/read and generality about the medium involved.  The objective of this section is to give an intuitive introduction to Ada streams, skipping some of the finer details.  The reader is referred for a more precise and detailed description of Ada streams to the Ada Reference Manual, in particular {{Ada/RM|13|13|title=Streams}}.

== Concepts == 

The language designers split the problem of writing an object over a medium into two sub-problems:

# Convert the object in a sequence of bits 
# Write the bits over the stream

Note that the first step depends only on the object to be sent and not on the actual medium.  On the other hand, the details of the second step depend only on the employed medium and not on the object type.

Similarly, in order to &quot;read&quot; an object from a network connection one must

# Read a block of bits from the stream
# Parse the read block and convert it into an object

Note again that the first step depends only on the medium, while the second one depends only on the object type.


== Abstract streams ==

The abstract model for an Ada stream is, basically, a sequence of ''raw data'' (Stream_Element) that can be read and written in blocks.  This abstract view is formalized in the Stream package definition (from RM {{Ada/RM|13|13|1|title=The Package Streams.}} with some omissions and comments added) 

   {{Ada/kw|package}} Ada.Streams {{Ada/kw|is}}
   
      {{Ada/kw|type}} Root_Stream_Type {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|abstract}} {{Ada/kw|tagged}} {{Ada/kw|limited}} {{Ada/kw|private}};
   
      {{Ada/--|Elementary piece of data.  A Stream is a sequence of Stream_Element}}
      {{Ada/kw|type}} Stream_Element {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|mod}} ''implementation defined'';
    
      {{Ada/kw|type}} Stream_Element_Offset {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|range}} ''implementation defined'';
    
      {{Ada/--|A block of data}}
      {{Ada/kw|type}} Stream_Element_Array {{Ada/kw|is}} 
          {{Ada/kw|array}} (Stream_Element_Offset {{Ada/kw|range}} &lt;&gt;) {{Ada/kw|of}} {{Ada/kw|aliased}} Stream_Element;
     
      {{Ada/--|Abstract procedure that reads a block of data}}
      {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Read (
           Stream : {{Ada/kw|in}} {{Ada/kw|out}} Root_Stream_Type;
           Item   : {{Ada/kw|out}} Stream_Element_Array;
           Last   : {{Ada/kw|out}} Stream_Element_Offset) {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|abstract}};
   
      {{Ada/--|Abstract procedure that writes a block of data}}
      {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Write (
           Stream : {{Ada/kw|in}} {{Ada/kw|out}} Root_Stream_Type;
           Item   : {{Ada/kw|in}} Stream_Element_Array) {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|abstract}};
   
   {{Ada/kw|private}}
          ''implementation defined...''
   {{Ada/kw|end}} Ada.Streams;

Since the type Root_Stream_Type is {{Ada/kw|abstract}}, one cannot create objects of type Root_Stream_Type, but must first derive a new type from Root_Stream_Type.   Ada.Streams just specifies the ''minimal'' interface that a stream must grant: with a stream we must be able to

* '''read''' a block of data (with the procedure Read) and 
* '''write''' a block of data (with Write).  

Typically for every new medium (for example, network connections, disk files, memory buffers) one will  derive  a new type specialized to read and write to that medium. Note that both Read and Write are abstract, so that any non-{{Ada/kw|abstract}} type must necessarily override them with new procedures that will take care of the details of reading/writing from/to a specific medium. 

Note that the minimal interface of Ada.Streams does not include, for example, functions to open or close a stream, nor functions to check, say, an End-Of-Stream condition. This is reasonable since the details of the interfaces of those functions depend on the specific medium: a function that opens a stream associated to a file will expect a file name as argument, a function for opening a network stream will probably expect a network address and a function for opening the stream associated to a memory buffer will probably need the address and size of the buffer.  It will be the duty of the package that derives from Root_Stream_Type to define those &quot;auxiliary&quot; functions.

== Serialization functions ==

The second ingredient in the Ada stream system is what we called ''serialization functions'', that is, the functions whose duty is to convert an Ada object to a sequence of Stream_Elements and vice-versa.  Actually, we will see in a moment that the serialization functions do not interact with the caller by passing back and forth arrays of Stream_Element's, rather they interact directly with the streams.

The serialization functions associated to a given type are defined as type attributes.  For every subtype S of a type T, Ada defines the following attributes associated to stream-related functions and procedures

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Type !! Input !! Output
|-
| Simple || S'Read || S'Write 
|-
| Simple, class-wide  || S'Class'Read || S'Class'Write
|-
| Composite || S'Input || S'Output
|-
| Composite, class-wide || S'Class'Input || S'Class'Output
|}

We will first describe S'Read and S'Write since they are the simplest and, in some sense, the most &quot;primitive&quot; ones.

=== Write attribute ===

Procedure S'Write is defined in {{Ada/RM|13|13|2|title=Stream-Oriented Attributes (3)}} as follows (remember that S is a subtype of type T)

   {{Ada/kw|procedure}} S'Write(
         Stream : {{Ada/kw|not}} {{Ada/kw|null}} {{Ada/kw|access}} Ada.Streams.Root_Stream_Type'Class;
         Item   : {{Ada/kw|in}}  T);

The duty of S'Write is to convert Item to a sequence of Stream_Elements and write the result on Stream.  Note that Stream is an access to class-wide type Root_Stream_Type'{{Ada/at|Class}}, therefore the programmer can use S'Write with any stream type derived from Root_Stream_Type.

According to {{Ada/RM|13|13|2|title=Stream-Oriented Attributes (9)}}, Ada defines default implementations for S'{{Ada/at|Write}} as follows

* For elementary types (e.g., Integers, Character, Float) the default implementations write a suitable representation of Item to Stream.  That representation is ''implementation dependent'' but, most of the time, this corresponds simply to the in-memory representation.
* For composite types (e.g., record and array) the default implementation writes each component (array entry or record component) using the corresponding S'{{Ada/at|Write}} procedure.  Note that no other information is written.  For example, if Item is an array, the array dimensions are not written; if Item has a discriminant ''with no default value'', the discriminant is not written.  In some sense, S'{{Ada/at|Write}} writes a very &quot;raw&quot; representation of Item to Stream.

Clearly, the default implementation, being dependent on the machine and compiler, can be useful only if the data is written and read by programs compiled with the same compiler.  If the data, for example, is to be sent across the network and read by a program written in another language, running on an unknown architecture, it is important for the programmer to control the format of the data sent over the wire.  Because of this exigence, Ada allows the programmer to override S'{{Ada/at|Write}} (and the other stream-related functions described in the following), using an attribute definition clause (RM {{Ada/RM|13|3}}):

     {{Ada/kw|for}}  S'{{Ada/at|Write}} {{Ada/kw|use}} user_defined_subprogram;

Suppose, for example, a network protocol requires to format data in the following textual length-type-value format

* Integer values are formatted as &quot;&amp;lt;len&amp;gt; i &amp;lt;value&amp;gt;&quot;, where &amp;lt;len&amp;gt; is the number of digits used to represent the integer and &amp;lt;value&amp;gt; is the integer expressed in base 10. (For example, the integer 42 would be represented as &quot;2i42&quot;)

The following code defines a suitable S'Write procedure for the integer case (Note: for the sake of simplicity, the following code supposes that each Stream_Element is 8 bits long)

    {{Ada/kw|package}} Example {{Ada/kw|is}}
        {{Ada/kw|type}} Int {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Integer;
        {{Ada/kw|type}} Int_Array {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|array}} (Int {{Ada/kw|range}} &amp;lt;&amp;gt;) of Int;
       
        {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Print (
             Stream : {{Ada/kw|not}} {{Ada/kw|null}} {{Ada/kw|access}} Ada.Streams.Root_Stream_Type'{{Ada/at|Class}};
             Item   : {{Ada/kw|in}}  Int);
        
        {{Ada/kw|for}} Int'{{Ada/at|Write}} {{Ada/kw|Use}} Print;
    {{Ada/kw|end}} Example;

    {{Ada/kw|package}} {{Ada/kw|body}} Example {{Ada/kw|is}}
      {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Print (
           Stream : {{Ada/kw|not}} {{Ada/kw|null}} {{Ada/kw|access}} Ada.Streams.Root_Stream_Type'{{Ada/at|Class}};
           Item   : {{Ada/kw|in}}  Int) 
      {{Ada/kw|is}}
           ''-- Convert Item to String (with no trailing space)''
           Value  : String := Trim(Int'Image(Item), Left);
           
           ''-- Convert Value'Length to String (with no trailing space)''
           Len    : String := Trim(Integer'Image(Value'Length), Left);
      
           Descr  : String := Len &amp; 'i' &amp; Value;
           Buffer : Stream_Element_Array (1 .. Stream_Element_Offset (Descr'{{Ada/at|Length}}));
      {{Ada/kw|begin}} 
           ''-- Copy Descr to Buffer''
           {{Ada/kw|for}} I {{Ada/kw|in}} Buffer'{{Ada/at|Range}} {{Ada/kw|loop}}
               Buffer (I) := Stream_Element (Character'{{Ada/at|Pos}} (Descr (Integer (I))));
           {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|loop}}; 
        
           ''-- Write the result to Stream''
           Stream.Write(Buffer);
      {{Ada/kw|end}} Print;
    {{Ada/kw|end}} Example;

Note the structure of Print: first Item is &quot;serialized&quot; in a sequence of Stream_Element (contained in Buffer), then such a sequence is written to Stream by calling the Write method (that will take care of the details of writing on Stream).  Suppose now that one wants to print the description of 42 to the standard output.  The following code can be used 

    {{Ada/kw|with}}  Ada.Text_IO.Text_Streams;
    {{Ada/kw|use}}   Ada.Text_IO;  {{Ada/--|defines Current_Output. See RM {{Ada/RM|A|10|1}}}}
    
    {{Ada/--|Text_Streams.Stream (Current_Output) returns a stream access}}
    {{Ada/--|associated with the file given as parameter}}
    Int'Write (Text_Streams.Stream (Current_Output), 42); 

The result will be &quot;2i42&quot; printed on the standard output.  Note that the following code 

    Int_Array'Write (Text_Streams.Stream (Current_Output), (1=&gt;42, 2=&gt;128, 3=&gt;6)); 

would write on standard output the string &quot;2i42_3i128_1i6&quot; (the '_' are not actually present; they have been added for readability) corresponding to calling Int'Write on 42, 128 and 6 in sequence.  Note that the array dimensions are ''not'' written.

If one wanted to send the same description across a TCP connection, the following code could be used (with GNAT)

     {{Ada/kw|with}} GNAT.Sockets;
     {{Ada/kw|use}}  GNAT;
     ...
     Sock   : Sockets.Socket_Type;
     Server : Sockets.Sock_Addr_Type := ''server address'';
     ...
     Sockets.Create_Socket (Sock);
     Sockets.Connect_Socket (Sock, Server);
     
     {{Ada/--|Here Sock is connected to the remote server}}
     {{Ada/--|Use Sockets.Stream to convert Sock to a stream}}
     
     {{Ada/--|First send the integer 42}}
     Int'Write (Sockets.Stream (Sock), 42);
     
     {{Ada/--|Now send the array}}
     Int_Array'Write (Sockets.Stream (Sock), (1=&gt;42, 2=&gt;128, 3=&gt;6));

=== Read attribute ===

Procedure S'Read is defined in {{Ada/RM|13|13|2|title=Stream-Oriented Attributes (6)}} as follows 

   {{Ada/kw|procedure}} S'Read(
         Stream : {{Ada/kw|not}} {{Ada/kw|null}} {{Ada/kw|access}} Ada.Streams.Root_Stream_Type'Class;
         Item   : {{Ada/kw|out}}  T);

Its behavior is clearly symmetric to the one of S'Write: S'Read reads one or more Stream_Element from Stream and &quot;parse&quot; them to construct Item.  Similarly to the case of S'Write, Ada defines default implementations for S'Read that the programmer can override by using the attribute definition clause

   {{Ada/kw|for}} S'Read {{Ada/kw|use}} ...

For example, the following procedure could be assigned to type Int with ''{{Ada/kw|for}} Int'Read {{Ada/kw|use}} Parse;''.

   {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Parse (
                    Stream : {{Ada/kw|not}} {{Ada/kw|null}} {{Ada/kw|access}} Root_Stream_Type'Class;
                    Item   : {{Ada/kw|out}} Int)
   {{Ada/kw|is}}
      Len    : Integer := 0;
      Buffer : Stream_Element_Array (1 .. 1);
      Last   : Stream_Element_Offset;
      Zero   : Stream_Element := Stream_Element (Character'Pos ('0'));
      Nine   : Stream_Element := Stream_Element (Character'Pos ('9'));
   {{Ada/kw|begin}}
      {{Ada/--|Extract the length from the stream}}
      {{Ada/kw|loop}}
         {{Ada/--|Read one element from the stream}}
         Stream.Read (Buffer, Last);
       
         {{Ada/kw|exit}} {{Ada/kw|when}} {{Ada/kw|not}} (Buffer (1) {{Ada/kw|in}} Zero .. Nine);
         Len := Len * 10 + Integer (Buffer (1) - Zero);
      {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|loop}};
      
      {{Ada/--|Check for the correct delimiter}}
      {{Ada/kw|if}} Character'Val (Integer (Buffer (1))) /= 'i' {{Ada/kw|then}}
         {{Ada/kw|raise}} Data_Error;
      {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|if}};
   
      {{Ada/--|Now convert the following Len characters}}
      Item := 0;
      {{Ada/kw|for}} I {{Ada/kw|in}} 1 .. Len {{Ada/kw|loop}}
         Stream.Read (Buffer, Last);
         Item := 10 * Item + Int (Buffer (1) - Zero);
      {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|loop}};
   {{Ada/kw|end}} Parse;

=== Output attribute ===

Procedure S'{{Ada/at|Output}} is defined in {{Ada/RM|13|13|2|title=Stream-Oriented Attributes (19)}} as follows 

   {{Ada/kw|procedure}} S'{{Ada/at|Output}}(
         Stream : {{Ada/kw|not}} {{Ada/kw|null}} {{Ada/kw|access}} Ada.Streams.Root_Stream_Type'{{Ada/at|Class}};
         Item   : {{Ada/kw|in}}  T);

S'{{Ada/at|Output}} differs from S'{{Ada/at|Write}} in that its default implementation 

* first it writes arrays bound (if S is an array) and discriminants (if S is a record).  
* then it calls S'{{Ada/at|Write}} to write Item itself

Note that the bounds or the discriminant are written '''by calling the respective S'{{Ada/at|Write}} procedures'''.  Therefore, since Int_Array was defined above as an array of Int indexed by Int, the following line 

     Int_Array'Output (Text_Streams.Stream (Current_Output), (1 =&gt; 42, 2 =&gt; 128, 3 =&gt; 6));

would produce (the '_' are added for readability and are not actually present in the output)

     1i1_1i3_2i42_3i128_1i6

Note the array bounds &quot;1i1&quot; and &quot;1i3&quot; at the beginning of the line.

=== Input attribute ===

Procedure S'{{Ada/at|Input}} is defined in {{Ada/RM|13|13|2|title=Stream-Oriented Attributes}} as follows 

   {{Ada/kw|function}} S'Input(
         Stream : {{Ada/kw|not}} {{Ada/kw|null}} {{Ada/kw|access}} Ada.Streams.Root_Stream_Type'{{Ada/at|Class}})
         {{Ada/kw|return}}  T;

S'{{Ada/at|Input}} is for S'{{Ada/at|Read}} what S'{{Ada/at|Output}} is for S'{{Ada/at|Write}} in the sense that S'{{Ada/at|Read}} 

* first it reads the bounds or the discriminants ('''using the corresponding S'{{Ada/at|Read}}''')
* it uses the read values to create the object to be returned
* it calls the corresponding S'{{Ada/at|Read}} to initialize the object

Note that S'{{Ada/at|Input}} is a function, while S'{{Ada/at|Read}} is a procedure. This is coherent with the fact when S'{{Ada/at|Read}} is called any bound and/or discriminant must be already known, so that the caller can create the object and pass it to S'{{Ada/at|Read}}. With S'{{Ada/at|Input}}, on the other hand, the bounds/discriminants are not known, but read from the stream; therefore, the burden of creating the object is on S'{{Ada/at|Input}}.


=== Class-wide Read and Write ===

Note that S'{{Ada/at|Read}} and S'{{Ada/at|Write}} are not [[Ada Programming/Object Orientation|primitive subprograms]] of S and they cannot be dynamically dispatching, even if S is a tagged type.  In order to allow for dynamical dispatching of S'{{Ada/at|Read}} and S'{{Ada/at|Write}} methods, {{Ada/RM|13|13|2|title=Stream-Oriented Attributes|par=11}} defines procedures

   {{Ada/kw|procedure}} S'{{Ada/at|Class}}'{{Ada/at|Write}}(
      Stream : {{Ada/kw|not}} {{Ada/kw|null}} {{Ada/kw|access}} Ada.Streams.Root_Stream_Type'Class;
      Item   : {{Ada/kw|in}} T'Class);
   
   {{Ada/kw|procedure}} S'{{Ada/at|Class}}'{{Ada/at|Read}}(
      Stream : {{Ada/kw|not}} {{Ada/kw|null}} {{Ada/kw|access}} Ada.Streams.Root_Stream_Type'Class;
      Item   : {{Ada/kw|out}} T'Class);

Note that in both cases the type of Item is T'{{Ada/at|Class}}, so Item can be of any type derived from T.  The behavior of those procedures is to dispatch to the actual S'{{Ada/at|Write}} or S'{{Ada/at|Read}} identified by the tag of Item.  See [[Ada Programming/Input Output/Stream Tutorial/Example]] for an example of usage of the class-wide stream attributes S'{{Ada/at|Class}}'{{Ada/at|Read}} and S'{{Ada/at|Class}}'{{Ada/at|Write}}.

=== Class-wide Input and Output ===

Similarly to the case of S'{{Ada/at|Read}} and S'{{Ada/at|Write}}, {{Ada/RM|13|13|2|title=Stream-Oriented Attributes|par=28}} defines the class-wide versions of S'{{Ada/at|Output}} and S'{{Ada/at|Input}}

   {{Ada/kw|procedure}} S'{{Ada/at|Class}}'{{Ada/at|Output}}(
      Stream : {{Ada/kw|not}} {{Ada/kw|null}} {{Ada/kw|access}} Ada.Streams.Root_Stream_Type'Class;
      Item   : {{Ada/kw|in}} T'{{Ada/at|Class}})
   
   {{Ada/kw|function}} S'{{Ada/at|Class}}'{{Ada/at|Input}}(
      Stream : {{Ada/kw|not}} {{Ada/kw|null}} {{Ada/kw|access}} Ada.Streams.Root_Stream_Type'Class)
           {{Ada/kw|return}} T'{{Ada/at|Class}};

Their default behavior is almost obvious when one remembers that a tagged type can actually be considered as a record with an &quot;hidden discriminant&quot; 

* '''S'{{Ada/at|Class}}'{{Ada/at|Output}}''' first writes the tag to Stream by first converting it to string and then calling String'{{Ada/at|Output}} on the result.  Successively, S'{{Ada/at|Class}}'{{Ada/at|Output}} dispatches to the subprogram S'{{Ada/at|Output}}  of the specific type identified by the tag.
* '''S'{{Ada/at|Class}}'{{Ada/at|Input}}''' first reads the tag from Stream by first calling String'Input and converting the result to a tag. Successively, S'{{Ada/at|Class}}'{{Ada/at|Input}} dispatches to the subprogram S'{{Ada/at|Input}}  of the specific type identified by the tag.

See {{Ada/RM|13|13|2|title=Stream-Oriented Attributes|par=28}} for a more detailed and precise explanation.  See [[Ada Programming/Libraries/Ada.Streams/Example]] for an example of usage of the class-wide stream attributes.

= Benko Gambit =
=== 5. ... Bxa6 ===
The most common move. 5... g6 is more flexible. Here in case white continues b3 to oppose the black bishop on g7, black can't capture with the knight on a6 to pressurise d5.

= King's Indian Defence =
=== 5. f4 ===
The '''Four Pawns Attack''' is the most aggressive line for white in the King's Indian. White creates a massive pawn centre and has full control over the middle of the board ... for now. This is a dangerous line for black, and if the second player doesn't play correctly he will be knocked off the board by white's advancing army! However, if black can survive the initial onslaught, he will have the better game since white will have many weak squares in his camp that his pawns can't defend. For this reason, the Four Pawns Attack isn't seen frequently at the highest levels of chess, although it's still very viable at the amateur level.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Density is the mass per unit volume of a substance. The formula for density is:
 density = mass/volume.

The unit for mass is kilograms (kg)/grams (g) and volume in centimetres cubed (cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) or metres cubed (m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).
            
Example 1.  A stone of mass 20 kg with volume 4 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; calculate its density.
 density = mass/volume
         = 20kg/4cm3
         = 5kg/cm3

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Continuous flow (alpha &gt; 0.7; composite reliability = 0.75; average variance extracted = 0.45) ==
=== Description ===

The research takes a step toward clarifying the concept of lean production and develops and validates a multi-dimensional measure of lean production. The 10 distinct dimensions of a lean system are continuous flow, [[Handbook of Management Scales/Customer involvement|customer involvement]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Employee involvement|employee involvement]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/JIT delivery by suppliers|JIT delivery by suppliers]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Pull|pull]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Set up time reduction|set up time reduction]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Statistical process control|statistical process control]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Supplier development|supplier development]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Supplier feedback|supplier feedback]], and [[Handbook of Management Scales/Total productive and preventive maintenance|total productive/preventive maintenance]].

=== Definition ===

Lean production is an integrated socio-technical system whose main objective is to eliminate waste by concurrently reducing or minimizing supplier, customer, and internal variability. This dimension of lean production is about establishing mechanisms that enable and ease the continuous ﬂow of products.

=== Items ===

Please indicate the extent of implementation of each of the following practices in your plant. (1) no implementation;
(2) little implementation; (3) some implementation; (4) extensive implementation; (5) complete implementation.

*Products are classified into groups with similar processing requirements.
*Products are classified into groups with similar routing requirements.
*Equipment is grouped to produce a continuous flow of families of products.
*Families of products determine our factory layout.

=== Comments ===

Average variance extracted is too low. Some items appear to be formative rather than reflective.

The research takes a step toward clarifying the concept of lean production and develops and validates a multi-dimensional measure of lean production. The 10 distinct dimensions of a lean system are [[Handbook of Management Scales/Continuous flow|continuous flow]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Customer involvement|customer involvement]], employee involvement, [[Handbook of Management Scales/JIT delivery by suppliers|JIT delivery by suppliers]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Pull|pull]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Set up time reduction|set up time reduction]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Statistical process control|statistical process control]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Supplier development|supplier development]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Supplier feedback|supplier feedback]], and [[Handbook of Management Scales/Total productive and preventive maintenance|total productive/preventive maintenance]].

=== Definition ===

Lean production is an integrated socio-technical system whose main objective is to eliminate waste by concurrently reducing or minimizing supplier, customer, and internal variability. This dimension of lean production is about the employees’ role in problem solving, and their cross functional character.

=== Items ===

Please indicate the extent of implementation of each of the following practices in your plant. (1) no implementation;
(2) little implementation; (3) some implementation; (4) extensive implementation; (5) complete implementation.

*Shop-floor employees are key to problem solving teams
*Shop-floor employees drive suggestion programs
*Shop-floor employees lead product/process improvement efforts
*Shop-floor employees undergo cross functional training

== Employee involvement (alpha = 0.79) ==
=== Description ===

Through a detailed analysis of the literature, twelve constructs of integrated quality management strategies were identified: [[Handbook of Management Scales/Top management commitment|top management commitment]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Customer focus|customer focus]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Supplier quality management|supplier quality management]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Design quality management|design quality management]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Benchmarking|benchmarking]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Statistical process control usage|SPC usage]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Internal quality information usage|internal quality information usage]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Employee empowerment|employee empowerment]], employee involvement, [[Handbook of Management Scales/Employee training|employee training]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Product quality|product quality]], and [[Handbook of Management Scales/Supplier performance|supplier performance]]. Using a survey of 371 manufacturing firms, the constructs were then empirically tested and validated. For this purpose a confirmatory factor analysis approach was used.

=== Items ===

*Cross-functional teams are often used.
*All employee suggestions are evaluated.
*Most employee suggestions are implemented.

=== Comments ===

Both composite reliability and average variance extracted are too low. Especially for the first and third item it is questionable if the scale really measures just-in-time delivery.

=== Definition ===

Lean production is an integrated socio-technical system whose main objective is to eliminate waste by concurrently reducing or minimizing supplier, customer, and internal variability. This dimension of lean production is about facilitating JIT production including kanban cards which serves as a signal to start or stop production.

=== Items ===

Please indicate the extent of implementation of each of the following practices in your plant. (1) no implementation;
(2) little implementation; (3) some implementation; (4) extensive implementation; (5) complete implementation.

*Production is &quot;pulled&quot; by the shipment of finished goods.
*Production at stations is &quot;pulled&quot; by the current demand of the next station.
*We use a &quot;pull&quot; production system.
*We use Kanban, squares, or containers of signals for production control.

=== Comments ===

The last item might be formative rather than reflective, because it doesn't react to other signals than those mentioned.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Supplier development (alpha &gt; 0.7; composite reliability = 0.74; average variance extracted = 0.33) ==
=== Description ===

The research takes a step toward clarifying the concept of lean production and develops and validates a multi-dimensional measure of lean production. The 10 distinct dimensions of a lean system are [[Handbook of Management Scales/Continuous flow|continuous flow]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Customer involvement|customer involvement]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Employee involvement|employee involvement]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/JIT delivery by suppliers|JIT delivery by suppliers]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Pull|pull]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Set up time reduction|set up time reduction]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Statistical process control|statistical process control]], supplier development, [[Handbook of Management Scales/Supplier feedback|supplier feedback]], and [[Handbook of Management Scales/Total productive and preventive maintenance|total productive/preventive maintenance]].

=== Definition ===

Lean production is an integrated socio-technical system whose main objective is to eliminate waste by concurrently reducing or minimizing supplier, customer, and internal variability. This dimension of lean production is about developing suppliers so they can be more involved in the production process of the focal firm.

=== Items ===

Please indicate the extent of implementation of each of the following practices in your plant. (1) no implementation;
(2) little implementation; (3) some implementation; (4) extensive implementation; (5) complete implementation.

*Our suppliers are contractually committed to annual cost reductions.
*Our key suppliers are located in close proximity to our plants.
*We have corporate level communication on important issues with key suppliers.
*We take active steps to reduce the number of suppliers in each category.
*Our key suppliers manage our inventory.
*We evaluate suppliers on the basis of total cost and not per unit price.

=== Comments ===

Average variance extracted is too low. The items are quite heterogenous and sometimes they appear to be too far from measuring supplier development.

=== Definition ===

Lean production is an integrated socio-technical system whose main objective is to eliminate waste by concurrently reducing or minimizing supplier, customer, and internal variability. This dimension of lean production is about providing regular feedback to suppliers about their performance.

=== Items ===

Please indicate the extent of implementation of each of the following practices in your plant. (1) no implementation;
(2) little implementation; (3) some implementation; (4) extensive implementation; (5) complete implementation.

*We frequently are in close contact with our suppliers.
*We give our suppliers feedback on quality and delivery performance.
*We strive to establish long-term relationship with our suppliers.

=== Comments ===

Only the second item is about feedback rather than relationship. It is therefore questionable if this scale really measures what it is intended to measure.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The perl interpreter is case sensitive. This means that identifier names containing lowercase letters will be treated as being different and separate from those containing uppercase letters:

 # These variables are all different
 $dog='Benjamin';
 $Dog='Samba';
 $DOG='Bernie';
 print &quot;The dogs are named $dog, $Dog, and $DOG \n&quot;

== Converting Strings ==

The perl interpreter provides the following functions for converting strings to uppercase or to lowercase:
uc 	Converts a string to upper case
lc 	Converts a string to lower case
ucfirst 	Converts the first letter of a string to upper case
lcfirst 	Converts the first letter of a string to lower case

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Identifiers and keywords ==

The rexx interpreter is case insensitive. This means that identifier names and keywords containing lowercase letters are considered to be the same as those containing uppercase letters:

 /* These variables are all the same */

 count = 1
 Count = COUNT + 1
 say count

== Literal Strings ==

Lettercase is preserved within literal strings:

 say 'Hello!'  /* Hello! */
 SAY 'HELLO!'  /* HELLO! */

== Comparison of Strings ==

In rexx, the comparative operators are case sensitive , so strings containing differing letter cases will not be interpreted as matching strings:

 if &quot;abc&quot; = &quot;ABC&quot; then
   say &quot;The strings are the same!&quot;    /* This does not happen because the strings are not the same */

      <comment>Whitespace is not permitted within an identifier name</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The lua programming language uses a [[/freeform/]] syntax. This means that '''whitespace''' characters, such as [[/space/]], [[/tab/]] characters and [[/newline/]] characters can be inserted into the program code for the purpose of spacing, alignment or [[/indent/]]ation in either the horizontal or vertical directions.

== Line Breaks and Indentation ==

The use of [[/indent/]]ation and [[/linebreak/]]s can greatly improve the readability of the code, without affecting the way that the code performs. Using whitespace appropriately, makes the code easier to read and follow because at a glance it is very apparent where [[/function/]]s and [[/procedure/]]s end, and which lines are part of which [[/loop/]]s and [[/procedure/]]s:

!!Example need here

== Whitespace characters are ignored by the interpreter ==

The whitespace characters do not change the functionality of the code, and are ignored by the lua interpreter. The following lines of code [[/execute/]] as a single [[/statement/]]:

 print
 &quot;hello&quot;

== Strings ==

As with other programming languages, [[/space/]], [[/tab/]], and [[/newline/]] characters within a quoted [[/literal string/]] do not form whitespace, and are treated as part of the [[/string/]]:

 print &quot;hello    bob&quot;

=== Line breaks are not permitted within a literal string ===

In lua, a line break is not permitted within a [[/literal string/]]:

 -- This will produce an unfinished string error
 print &quot;hello
 bob&quot;

=== Whitespace is not permitted within an identifier name ===

It is not permissible to use whitespace in identifer names used for variables or functions:

 -- function names cannot contain whitespace
 function my function(myparameter)

 end

It is permissible to use underscore symbols in identifier names:

 function my_function(myparameter)

 end

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Lesson I.1: Wie heißt du? (1. Teil)&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
----

This lesson deals with basic conversation topics such as saying hello and  goodbye and asking people how they are feeling. This lesson features audio recordings by native speakers to help you with the pronunciation.

==Dialogue==
Read and listen to the following dialogue between two students: Franz and Greta. You don't have to understand anything! You should rather try to find out how each word is pronounced.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{German table|Dialogue|What's your name? (1st Part)|Wie heißt du? (1. Teil)|134|2|Dialogue franz greta 1.ogg}}
!Franz
|Hallo, ich bin Franz. Wie heißt du?
|-
!Greta
|Hallo, Franz. Ich heiße Greta. Wie geht's?
|-
!Franz
|Es geht mir gut. Kennst du den Lehrer?
|-
!Greta
|Ja, er heißt Herr Weiß.
|-
!Franz
|Oh, danke, Greta. Bis dann!
|-
!Greta
|Wiedersehen!
|}

{{German/Exercise|Listen carefully!
|The German pronunciation of many letters is similar to the English pronunciation, but there are also many differences. Try to answer the following question by listening carefully. Write your answers on a piece of paper or in a text file before you check them.
# How is the &quot;a&quot; in &quot;Hallo&quot;, &quot;Franz&quot;, &quot;Greta&quot;, &quot;ja&quot;, &quot;danke&quot;, and &quot;dann&quot; pronounced?
# How is the &quot;i&quot; in &quot;ich&quot; and &quot;bis&quot; pronounced?
# How is the &quot;ch&quot; in &quot;ich&quot; pronounced?
# How is the &quot;z&quot; in &quot;Franz&quot; pronounced?
# How is the &quot;w&quot; in &quot;wie&quot;, &quot;Weiß&quot; and &quot;wiedersehen&quot; pronounced?
# How is the &quot;ie&quot; in &quot;wie&quot; and &quot;Wiedersehen&quot; pronounced?
# How is the &quot;ei&quot; in &quot;heißt&quot;, &quot;heiße&quot; and &quot;Weiß&quot; pronounced?
# How is the &quot;ß&quot; in &quot;heißt&quot;, &quot;heiße&quot; and &quot;Weiß&quot; pronounced?
# How is the &quot;e&quot; in &quot;es&quot;, &quot;kennst&quot;, &quot;er&quot; and &quot;Herr&quot; pronounced?
# How is the first &quot;e&quot; in &quot;gehen&quot;, &quot;Greta&quot;, and &quot;geht&quot; pronounced?
|
# Similar to the &quot;a&quot; in &quot;hard&quot;.
# Similar to the &quot;i&quot; in &quot;hit&quot;.
# Similar to the &quot;ch&quot; in the Scottish word &quot;Loch&quot;.
# &quot;z&quot; is pronounced like &quot;ts&quot;.
# Similar to the &quot;v&quot; in &quot;vat&quot;.
# Similar to the &quot;ee&quot; in &quot;meet&quot;.
# &quot;ei&quot; is pronounced like &quot;ai&quot; in German or like the &quot;i&quot; in the English word &quot;time&quot;.
# &quot;ß&quot; is pronounced like &quot;s&quot;.
# Similar to &quot;e&quot; in &quot;pet&quot;.
# This is a long German &quot;e&quot;; the sound doesn't exist in English. It is between the &quot;i&quot; in &quot;hit&quot; and the &quot;e&quot; in &quot;pet&quot;.

==Hellos and Goodbyes==
There are many ways of saying hello and goodbye in German; some of them are:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{German table|Vocabulary|Greetings|Grüße|144|2}}
|-
!English||German
|-
|rowspan=3 valign=top|Hello!||Hallo!*
|-
||Servus! (used in eastern Austria, informal)
|-
||Moin! (used in northern Germany)
|-
|rowspan=3 valign=top|Good morning!||Moin Moin! (used in northern Germany)
|-
||Guten Morgen!*
|-
||Morgen! (shorter)
|-
|rowspan=2 valign=top|Good day!||Guten Tag!*
|-
||Tag! (used in Germany, shorter)
|-
||Good evening!||Guten Abend!*
|-
||Hello!||Grüß Gott! (used in southern Germany, Austria and South Tyrol)     
|-             
|rowspan=2 valign=top|Goodbye!||Auf Wiedersehen!*
|-             
||Wiedersehen! (shorter)
|-
|rowspan=3 valign=top|Bye!||Tschüss!*
|-
||Ciao! (pronounced as in Italian)
|-
||Servus! (used in eastern Austria, informal)
|-
||See you later!||Bis später!*
|-
|rowspan=2 valign=top|See you!||Bis dann!*
|-
||Bis bald!*
|-
||See you soon!||Bis gleich!
|-
||Good night!||Gute Nacht!*
|}

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;You will need to know each expression with an asterisk (*) after it. The others, of course, would be useful to know if you are traveling to regions where they are used. (As you can see, the different German-speaking regions often have their own ways of saying hello and goodbye. However, you will not be required to know any of these less common phrases for any problems or tests.)

The more formal phrases are ''guten Morgen'', ''guten Tag'', and ''auf Wiedersehen''. The less formal ones are ''tschüss'', ''Tag'', ''servus'', and ''ciao''. The others are somewhat neutral on the formal-informal scale. 


{{German/Exercise|Hellos and goodbyes
|How would you say hello and goodbye in these situations:
# You meet a friend in the morning.
# You meet a teacher in the classroom in the afternoon.
# You meet a classmate in the evening.
# You talk to a shop assistant in the morning.
| Avoiding local variants, these are some options:
# Hello: Hallo!/(Guten) Morgen!/(Guten) Tag! Goodbye: Tschüss!/Bis später!/Bis dann!/Bis bald!
# Hello: Guten Tag! Goodbye: Auf Wiedersehen.
# Hello: Hallo!/Guten Abend! Goodbye: Tschüss!/Bis dann!/Bis bald! 
# Hello: Guten Morgen!/Guten Tag! Goodbye: (Auf) Wiedersehen! 
}}


==Mr. and Mrs.==
In German, ''Herr'' and ''Frau'' are used instead of ''Mr.'' and ''Mrs.'' before a last name; e.g., ''Mr. Schwarz'' – ''Herr Schwarz''.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{German table|Vocabulary|Mr. &amp; Ms.|Herr und Frau|28|2}}
|-
!English||German
|-
|Mr.||Herr
|-
|Mrs.||Frau
|}

''Frau'' is used for married and unmarried women. Some people still use ''Miss'' – ''Fräulein'' in spoken German but it is no longer used in written German since it is considered an inappropriate discrimination of unmarried women.

Literally, ''der Herr'' means ''the gentleman'' and ''die Frau'' means ''the woman''.  If you use these words without a last name after them, you have to use an article before them; e.g., ''der Herr'' or ''die Frau''. This is actually just like in English, for example: 
* '''The''' woman's name is Mrs. Weiß – '''Die''' Frau heißt Frau Weiß. 

Note also that the German translation of ''the man'' is ''der Mann'' and ''the lady'' should be translated to ''die Dame''. Thus, without last names you would rather use these pairs:
* man and woman – Mann und Frau
* men and women – Männer und Frauen
* lady and gentleman – Dame und Herr
* ladies and gentlemen – Damen und Herren

==Replies to ''Wie geht's?''==
There are many ways to reply to the question ''Wie geht's?'' Here are some of them:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{German table|Vocabulary|How are you?|Wie geht's?|245|2}}
|-
!English||German
|-
|How are you?||Wie geht's? (longer: Wie geht es dir?)*
|-
|great||prima
|-
|good||gut
|-
|very good||sehr gut
|-
|miserable||miserabel
|-
|bad||schlecht
|-
|not (so) good||nicht (so) gut
|-
|O.K.||ganz gut
|-
|all right||Es geht so. (Or shorter: Geht so.) 
|}
&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;The more formal form is ''Wie geht es Ihnen?''

After replying to the question, you could continue with:
* And how are you? — Und wie geht es dir? (formal: Und wie geht es Ihnen?)
Or shorter:
* And you? — Und dir? (or: Und selbst?; or formal: Und Ihnen?)


{{German/Exercise|Wie geht's?
|Fill in the blanks:
# _______ geht's? 
# Prima. _______ dir? 
# Es _______ so.
# Wie geht _______ Ihnen?
# Sehr _______. _______ selbst?
# Ganz _______, danke.
|
# ''Wie'' geht's? 
# Prima. ''Und'' dir? 
# Es ''geht'' so.
# Wie geht ''es'' Ihnen?
# Sehr ''gut''. ''Und'' selbst?
# Ganz ''gut'', danke.
}}


==Test==

The test consists of three parts: pronunciation, vocabulary, and translation. As always, you should write down your answers before you check them. (Writing the German words is in fact a great way to practice the spelling of German words.) The vocabulary and translation problems are all from English to German because this is what you have to learn if you want to communicate in German. Once you are able to translate an English word to the corresponding German word, it won't be any problem to translate the German word back to English.

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Lesson I.2: Wie heißt du? (2. Teil)&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
----

The dialogue of this lesson is a conversation between two persons: Franz and Mr. Schwarz. While Franz uses the formal ''Sie'' to address Mr. Schwarz, the latter uses the informal ''du'' to address Franz. We also discuss some grammar: ''subject pronouns'' and some important verbs in the present tense.

==Dialogue==
In this short dialogue Mr. Schwarz uses the informal form ''you'' – ''du''. 
while Franz uses the formal translation of ''you'' – ''Sie''. When listening to the dialogue, try to find out how the word ''Sie'' is pronounced.

==''Sie'' and ''du''==
Why is Franz using the formal form of ''you'' — ''Sie'' while Mr. Schwarz is using the informal of ''you'' — ''du''?

First of all you should realize that Franz addresses Mr. Schwarz with his last name while Mr. Schwarz addresses Franz with his first name. This is probably the most important rule: if you (would) address someone with his or her last name, you should use the formal ''Sie''. On the other hand, if you are using the first name, you should use ''du''. Anything else would sound funny.

So, when do Germans address other people with their first name and say ''du''? 
* Some cases are very clear: children, relatives, and friends are always addressed with ''du''. (Mr. Schwarz uses ''du'' because Franz is still a child. Otherwise Mr. Schwarz would either use ''Sie'' or Franz would also use ''du''.) 
* Students (at universities etc.) usually say ''du'' to other students and everyone else who is of their age or younger. 
* The situation is not so clear for colleagues in companies. Fortunately, there is another rule for grown-ups: any two grown-ups address each other in the same way, either with ''du'' or ''Sie'', but never does only one of them use ''du'' and the other ''Sie''. Thus, if in doubt, you can just copy how the other person addresses you. 
* In all other situations you should use ''Sie''. If a German thinks that it would be more appropriate to say ''du'', he or she will be happy to suggest to use ''du''. On the other hand, it is almost always considered impolite to go from ''du'' to ''Sie''; thus, you shouldn't put someone in a position where he or she wants to suggest to use ''Sie'' instead of ''du''.

==Subject Pronouns==

A ''noun'' is a word that describes a thing or being, e.g. &quot;apple&quot;, &quot;woman&quot;, &quot;man&quot;, etc. ''Pronouns'' are the little words that refer to previously mentioned nouns, e.g. &quot;it&quot;, &quot;she&quot;, &quot;he&quot;, or even &quot;we&quot;, &quot;him&quot;, etc. 
 
The ''subject'' of a sentence is the noun or pronoun that the sentence is about. Usually it is the most active thing or being of the sentence. For example, in the sentence &quot;The woman ate an apple.&quot;, both &quot;woman&quot; and &quot;apple&quot; are nouns, but &quot;woman&quot; is the subject of the sentence because the sentence is about the action performed by the woman. (If you are curious: &quot;apple&quot; is the direct object of the sentence.)

If we replace the nouns of the example by pronouns, the sentence becomes: &quot;She ate it.&quot; In this example, &quot;she&quot; and &quot;it&quot; are pronouns. The subject of this sentence is the pronoun &quot;she&quot; and therefore this kind of pronoun is called a ''subject pronoun''.

Now that you know about the English subject pronouns, here is a table of them with their German counterparts. Note that ''you'' corresponds to three different words in German, depending on whether you address one or more persons and whether you are using a more formal or more familiar way of addressing them. 

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{German table|Grammar|Subject Pronouns|Subjekt-Pronomina|87|4}}
!colspan=&quot;2&quot;| 
!English||German
|-
!rowspan=&quot;3&quot;|singular!!1st person
|I

|-

|-

|we
|wir
|-
!2nd person
|you
|ihr, Sie*
|-
!3rd person
|they
|sie
|}

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;''Sie'' is the formal (polite) version of ''du'' and ''ihr''. 


{{German/Exercise|Subject pronouns
|Try to translate these English pronouns to German:

# we
# they
# he
# you
# I
# you (formal)
# it
# you guys
# she
|
# wir
# sie
# er
# du
# ich
# Sie (Make sure it's capitalized!)
# es
# ihr
# sie
}}

==Names==
To say the name of someone or something you can use ''to be called'' — ''heißen''. You have already seen some forms of the verb ''heißen''. Here is a more systematic table with all the forms in the present tense. Note that the subject pronouns are capitalized because they start the sentences.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{German table|Grammar|Names|Namen|179|2}}
|-
!English||German
|-
|My name is...||Ich heiße ...
|-
|His/Her/Its name is...||Er/Sie/Es heißt ...
|-
|Their names are...||Sie heißen ...
|-
|Our names are...||Wir heißen ...
|-
|Your name is...||Du heißt ...
|-
|Your names are...||Ihr heißt ...
|-
|What is your name?||Wie heißt du?*
|-
|What are your names?||Wie heißt ihr?*
|}

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;Remember, the formal way to ask someone's name is to ask ''Wie heißen Sie?''

'''Note:''' There ''are'' possessive pronouns (e.g. &quot;my&quot;, &quot;your&quot;, &quot;his&quot;, her&quot;, ...) in German, they just don't apply here. For instance, native speakers usually don't say ''Mein Name ist ...'' (''My name is...'').


{{German/Exercise|Names
|Translate to German:
# Hello. My name is ____ (put your name here).
# What is your name?
# My name is Iris. 
# What is his name?
# His name is Andreas.
# What are their names?
# Their names are Gerd and Udo.
# Her name is Eda.
# Its name is Mensch-ärger-dich-nicht. (This is a popular board game in Germany.)
|
# Hallo. Ich heiße ____.
# Wie heißt du? / Wie heißen Sie?
# Ich heiße Iris.
# Wie heißt er?
# Er heißt Andreas.
# Wie heißen sie?
# Sie heißen Gerd und Udo.
# Sie heißt Eda.
# Es heißt Mensch-ärger-dich-nicht.
}}

==Important Verbs==

Verbs are the words that describe the action of a sentence, e.g. ''(to) run'', ''(to) call'', ''(to) be'', etc. ''Conjugation'' refers to changing the form of a verb depending on the subject of a sentence. For example, the verb ''to be'' – ''sein'' has several different forms: ''(I) am...'', ''(you) are...'', ''(he) is...'', etc. Most English verbs, however, have only two forms in the present tense, e.g., ''(I/you/we/they) run'' and ''(he/she/it) runs''. German verbs, on the other hand, have usually several forms in the present tense.

You have already learned the forms of one German verb: ''to be called'' – ''heißen''.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{German table|Verb|to be called|heißen|229|7|German Verb - heißen.ogg}}
!colspan=&quot;2&quot;| 
!English||German
|-
!rowspan=&quot;3&quot;|singular!!1st person
|I am called
|ich heiße
|-
!2nd person
|you are called
|du heißt
|-
!3rd person
|he/she/it is called
|er/sie/es heißt
|-
!rowspan=&quot;3&quot;|plural!!1st person
|we are called
|wir heißen
|-
!2nd person
|you are called
|ihr heißt
|-
!3rd person
|they are called
|sie heißen*
|}

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;The form of verbs for ''you (polite)'' — ''Sie'' is exactly the same as for the plural, 3rd person pronoun ''they'' — ''sie''.


Two extremely common verbs are ''to be'' — ''sein'' and ''to have'' — ''haben''. They are conjugated like this:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{German table|Verb|to be|sein|76|5|German Verb - sein.ogg}}
!colspan=&quot;2&quot;| 
!English||German
|-
!rowspan=&quot;3&quot;|singular!!1st person
|I am 
|ich bin
|-
!2nd person
|you are 
|du bist
|-
!3rd person
|he/she/it is

|-
!rowspan=&quot;3&quot;|plural!!1st person
|we are 
|wir sind
|-
!2nd person
|you are 
|ihr seid
|-
!3rd person
|they are 
|sie sind*
|}

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;Don't forget that the form for ''you (polite)'' — ''Sie'' is the same as for the plural, 3rd person pronoun ''they'' — ''sie''.


{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{German table|Verb|to have|haben|140|5|German Verb - haben.ogg}}
!colspan=&quot;2&quot;| 
!English||German
|-
!rowspan=&quot;3&quot;|singular!!1st person
|I have
|ich habe
|-
!2nd person
|you have
|du hast
|-
!3rd person
|he/she/it has 
|er/sie/es hat
|-
!rowspan=&quot;3&quot;|plural!!1st person
|we have
|wir haben
|-
!2nd person
|you have
|ihr habt
|-
!3rd person
|they have 
|sie haben*
|}

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;This is also the form for ''you (polite)'' — ''Sie''.

==Test==

The test consists of three parts: grammar, vocabulary, and translation. The grammar part is about conjugation; i.e., different forms of verbs for different subject pronouns. The vocabulary and translation problems are all from English to German because this is what you have to learn if you want to communicate in German.

==Spielen, Machen and Other Verbs==

All three verbs that you were introduced to in Lesson 2 are irregular in some way; however, most verbs are regular verbs. In English, the regular conjugation is very easy: only for the third person singular an &quot;-s&quot; is added to the infinitive (&quot;to see&quot; becomes &quot;he/she/it sees&quot;). Unfortunately, there are more endings in German. The following two tables show the endings for the two regular verbs ''spielen'' (''to play'') and ''machen'' (''to do; to make''):

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{German table|Verb|to play|spielen|187|7}}

|-
!2nd person
|you||do/make
|ihr||mach'''t'''
|-
!3rd person
|they||do/make
|sie||mach'''en'''
|}

As you see, the endings are the same for corresponding forms of ''spielen'' and ''machen''. In fact, they are the same for all regular verbs. Thus, you can always just remove the ''-en'' from the infinitive of a regular German verb to form the stem (e.g., ''spielen'' becomes ''spiel-'' and ''machen'' becomes ''mach-'') and then add the ending for the particular person. Here is a table with these endings:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{German table|Verb|conjugation|Konjugation|168|6|German Verb - conjugation.ogg}}
!colspan=&quot;2&quot;| 
!colspan=&quot;2&quot;|English

|-
!2nd person
|you||'''-'''
|ihr||'''-t'''
|-
!3rd person
|they||'''-'''
|sie||'''-en'''*
|}
&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;The form for ''you (polite)'' — ''Sie'' is exactly the same as for the plural, 3rd person pronoun ''they'' — ''sie''.


===Examples===

*''Was machst du?''
:What are you doing?
*''Ich spiele Basketball.''
:I play basketball.
*''Spielst du Fußball?''
:Do you play soccer?
*''Ich mache Hausaufgaben.''
:I do homework.
*''Er macht Hausaufgaben.''
:He does homework.
*''Machst du Sport?''
:Do you play sports?

Note that in English one ''plays'' sport, while in German one ''does'' sport. You can also use the question words from [[German/Level I/Bitte_buchstabieren_Sie#Forming Questions|Lesson 3]] to form more combinations:

*''Warum spielst du Baseball?''
:Why do you play baseball?
*''Wann machst du die Hausaufgaben?''
:When do you do the homework?

To say &quot;not&quot;, use &quot;nicht&quot;. &quot;Nicht&quot; goes after the verb but before the sport. 

*''Wer spielt nicht Fußball?''
:Who doesn't play soccer?
*''Wir spielen nicht Tennis.''
:We don't play tennis.

===Compound Sentences===
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{German table|Vocabulary|Conjunctions|Verbindungen|72|2}}
!English||German
|-
|and||und
|-
|but||aber
|-
|or||oder
|}

Both German and English have compound sentences; the applications of these are enormous. They can be used in lists and also in compound sentences. For example,

*''Ich spiele Basketball und er spielt auch Basketball.''
:I play basketball, and he also plays basketball.

The new word, ''also — auch'' is very important. The one grammar rule about ''auch'' is that it always comes after the verb.

&lt;big&gt;[[/Problems#Spielen, Machen, and Other Verbs|Section Problems]]&gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

===Other Verbs and Their Conjugations===
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{German table|Grammar|Verbs|Verben|135|2}}
!English||German
|-
||(to) read||lesen
|-
||(to) watch||schauen
|-
||(to) see||sehen
|-
||(to) work||arbeiten
|-
||(to) write||schreiben
|-
||(to) swim||schwimmen
|}

''Schauen'', ''schreiben'' and ''schwimmen'' are all regular verbs; i.e., they follow regular conjugations. To conjugate them, you first remove the ''-en'' from the infinitive to form the stem (i.e., ''schau-'', ''schreib-'', and ''schwimm-''), and then add the correct ending. Here is an example:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!verb (infinitive)||first step (stem)||conjugated form
|-
|schau'''en'''||schau-||ich schau'''e'''
|}

''Arbeiten'' is an irregular verb; however, it has a simple change. Whenever the ending starts with a consonant, an ''-e-'' is added before it. For example, ''du arbeit'''e'''st'' (not &lt;s&gt;''du arbeitst''&lt;/s&gt;). As well as ''er/sie/es/ihr arbeit'''e'''t'' (not &lt;s&gt;''er/sie/es/ihr arbeitt''&lt;/s&gt;).

''Lesen'' is also an irregular verb. For the second and third person singular the form is ''liest'', i.e., ''du/er/sie/es l'''ies'''t'' (not &lt;s&gt;''du lesst''&lt;/s&gt;). 

''Sehen'' is the last irregular verb. The second person singular is ''du s'''ie'''hst'' and the third person singular is ''er/sie/es s'''ie'''ht''.

&lt;big&gt;[[/Problems#Other Verbs and Their Conjugations|Section Problems]]&gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

===Two More Verb Forms===

There are two common verb forms in English that just don't exist in German: the ing-form (or: present progressive); e.g., &quot;I am playing&quot; or &quot;he is making&quot;; and forms with &quot;to do&quot;; e.g., &quot;I do play&quot; or &quot;he does not play&quot;.

The simple rule is: these constructions don't exist in German. Thus, you should translate ''I am playing'' to ''ich spiele''. Similarly, ''I do play'' is also translated to ''ich spiele''. Anything else (&lt;s&gt;''ich mache spielen''&lt;/s&gt; or &lt;s&gt;''ich bin spielen''&lt;/s&gt;) is either not possible in German or has a different meaning.

The phrase ''I do not play'' should be translated to ''ich spiele nicht'' (literally: ''I play not'') since ''nicht'' (''not'') comes usually after the verb. This may sound like Early Modern English in a play by Shakespeare, and this is no coincidence since German and English are both West Germanic languages.

&lt;big&gt;[[/Problems#Two More Verb Forms|Section Problems]]&gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

==Expressing likes and dislikes==
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{German table|Vocabulary|Expressing likes and dislikes|Vorlieben und Abneigungen ausdrücken|1|2}}
!English||German
|-
|What do you like to do?||Was machst du gern*?
|-
|I like to play.||Ich spiele gerne*.
|-
|What do you like to play?||Was spielst du gerne*?
|-
|I like to play soccer.||Ich spiele gerne* Fußball.
|-
|}
&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; ''gern'' and ''gerne'' can be used interchangeably.

In German, there are several ways to express likes and dislikes; this is just one of them. You can also add other verbs for other activities, e.g., ''I like to read.'' — ''Ich lese gern.'' or ''I like to work.'' — ''Ich arbeite gern.'' or ''I like to watch TV.'' — ''Ich schaue gern Fernsehen.''

To express preference, you can use ''lieber'' instead of ''gern.'' For example, ''I prefer to play basketball.'' — ''Ich spiele lieber Basketball.'' or ''I prefer to read.'' — ''Ich lese lieber.''

To express favorite activities, you can use ''am liebsten'' (meaning ''most of all'') instead of ''lieber'' or ''gern''. For example, ''Most of all, I like to play chess.'' — ''Ich spiele am liebsten Schach.''

To express dislikes, you can use ''nicht gern'' instead of ''gern'', for example ''I don't like to swim.'' — ''Ich schwimme nicht gern.'' or ''I don't like to work.'' — ''Ich arbeite nicht gern.'' or ''I don't like to play soccer.'' — ''Ich spiele nicht gern Fußball.'' 

&lt;big&gt;[[/Problems#Expressing likes and dislikes|Section Problems]]&gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

==Numbers==

Numbers are among the most important and most useful words: we need them to talk about time, amounts, money, etc. Even if you are &quot;just&quot; a tourist, you often cannot avoid numbers. Learning numbers can be a bit of a pain; thus, here is an advice: whenever you have time, count something in German; e.g., steps, cars, people, seconds, whatever: just count.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{German table|Vocabulary|Numbers|Zahlen|536|2}}

|-
|hundred and one||hunderteins*
|-
|two hundred||zweihundert* 
|-
|thousand||tausend (or: eintausend)
|-
|two thousand||zweitausend*
|-
|}
&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;Some numbers are missing in the audio recording.

&lt;nowiki&gt;**&lt;/nowiki&gt;Some people sometimes say ''zwo'' instead of ''zwei'' in order to distinguishing it more clearly from ''drei'' (''three'').


Notice the pattern: ''-teen'' translates to ''-zehn'', and ''-ty'' to ''-zig''.

There is one big problem with the numbers: in German the unit position comes before the tens and is connected by ''und'' (''and''). For example: ''twenty-three'' — ''dreiundzwanzig'' (literally: ''three-and-twenty''),
''twenty-four'' — ''vierundzwanzig'', ''thirty-five'' — ''fünfunddreißig'', ''fourty-six'' — ''sechsundvierzig'', etc.

One exception is ''eins'' which becomes ''ein-'' in 21, 31, 41, etc.: ''twenty-one'' — ''einundzwanzig'' (literally: ''one-and-twenty''),
''thirty-one'' — ''einunddreißig'', ''fourty-one'' — ''einundvierzig'', etc.

Actually, German is not the only language with this funny order of numbers, Danish (another Germanic language) does it the same way.

=What's On the Test=

To go straight to the lesson test, go [[/Test|here]].

The test will have four parts to it: Grammar (79 points), Translating (95 points), Reading Comprehension (20 points), Vocabulary (20 points), and Previous Topics (10 points) in that order. The Grammar section will test your ability to know the verbs from this lesson and it's various visions, to know articles - the genders of them and the correct usage of them, and correct word order. 

The Translating section is worth the most points, and it too has three sections. You must know the translations for sentences and phrases going from English to German, and be able to take a German dialogue and translate it back into English. Also you must know the translation from Numbers to German.

The third section, Reading Comprehension, is Comprehension Questions you must know how to read the conversion and after reading you will be asked question on the previous conversion.

The fourth section is a vocabulary section. You get 20 English words on the left and 20 German words on the right, and be asked to match them. To study for that, check out the 401 flashcards related to this lesson at [http://www.flashcardexchange.com/flashcards/view/249128 FlashcardExchange.com]
''Part I'' and [http://www.flashcardexchange.com/flashcards/view/249218 FlashcardExchange.com] ''Part II''.

The last section, Previous Topics, is a quick review on [[German/Level I/Wie heißt du?|Lesson 1]] to get ready for this section, just look at some past notes or go to [[German/Level I/Wie heißt du?|Lesson 1]] and study. That is the whole test. [[German/Level I/Freizeit/Test|Take it!]]

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Lesson I.5: Geburtstag&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
----

==Asking the Time==

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{German table|Vocabulary|Time|Zeit|243|3}}
!||English||German
|-
|||What time is it? (How late is it?)||Wie spät ist es?
|-
|||What time is it? (How much clock is it?)||Wie viel Uhr ist es?
|-
|&lt;small&gt;Ef&lt;/small&gt;||It is 10:15||Es ist zehn Uhr fünfzehn.
|-
|&lt;small&gt;BoA&lt;/small&gt;||It is 10:15||Viertel nach Zehn 
|-
|&lt;small&gt;BoA&lt;/small&gt;||It is 10:45||Viertel vor Elf 
|-
|}

In table above you might have seen the Ef and BoA, those stand for exact form and before or after. Specific times can be expressed in two ways: Exact form (e.g. &quot;Four thirty-seven&quot;) or before or after form (e.g. &quot;Twenty-three to five&quot;).

==Exact form==

This form is the same as English. For example,

*'''Es ist zehn Uhr fünfzehn.'''
:It is 10:15 a.m.
 
*The new word '''Uhr''' means &quot;o'clock&quot;, and is used in all exact times, it comes between the hour and the minute.

*Also, German-speakers generally use the 24-hour clock when expressing time this way, therefore, 3:29 p.m. (15:29) is &quot;fünfzehn Uhr neunundzwanzig.&quot;

&lt;big&gt;[[German/Level_I/Freizeit/Problems#Exact form|Section Problems]]&gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

==Before or After the Hour==
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{German table|Vocabulary|BoA|BoA|111|2}}
|-
!English||German
|-
|After, Past||nach
|-
|Till, to||vor
|-
|quarter||Viertel
|-
|half before||Halb
|}

*Use the same form as in English. For example, 10:57 can be said as, &quot;drei vor Elf(three minutes to eleven&quot;. Likewise, 4:10 would be &quot;zehn nach Vier(ten minutes past four).&quot; 

*Typically, use the smaller time interval with 'nach' or 'vor'. Don't say, &quot;siebenundfünfzig nach Zehn.&quot; 

*You don't need a ''vor'' when using halb. Be careful! In German it´s not &quot;half past&quot;, but rather &quot;half to&quot;.  For example, 11:30 can be said as, &quot;Halb zwölf&quot;.

* 5:15 can be said as &quot;Viertel nach Fünf&quot;, 5:45 would be &quot;Viertel vor Sechs&quot;.

'''Note:''' This is only used with informal time telling. You don't use 'Uhr'.

&lt;big&gt;[[German/Level_I/Freizeit/Problems#Before/After the Hour|Section Problems]]&gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

===Saying When You Do Something===
''Wann spielst du Football?'' (Football means American Football. The much more popular soccer would be &quot;Fußball&quot;, which lit. means Football)

To say you play a sport at a certain time in English, you would answer, &quot;I play football ''at'' 3:30.&quot; This is all the same in German, with the translation of 'at' being ''um''. That makes the above response &quot;Ich spiele Football um halb Vier.&quot; or &quot;Ich spiele Football um fünfzehn Uhr dreißig.&quot;.

&lt;big&gt;[[German/Level_I/Freizeit/Problems#Saying When You Do Something|Section Problems]]&gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

==Times of Day==

|-
|(early) morning||Morgen*
|-
|morning||Vormittag
|-
|afternoon||Nachmittag
|-
|evening||Abend
|-
|night||Nacht
|}

*In German, except the capitalization, the words for &quot;morning&quot; and &quot;tomorrow&quot; are the same: ''morgen''. If you want to say ''tomorrow morning'' use ''morgen früh'' (meaning: ''early on the next day'').

*The words above can be combined into phrases like &quot;gestern Abend&quot;.

*To say &quot;2 days before yesterday&quot; use '''vorvorgestern''' (but 3 days before yesterday won't be ''vorvorvorgestern'')

&lt;big&gt;[[German/Level_I/Freizeit/Problems#Other Time|Section Problems]]&gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

|-
|Wednesday||Mittwoch

|-
|Saturday||Samstag

*Instead of &quot;Samstag&quot; you can say &quot;Sonnabend&quot;.

*To say &quot;on Monday&quot;, say ''&quot;am Montag&quot;'' or whatever applies. To say &quot;in January&quot;, say ''&quot;im Januar&quot;'' or whatever applies. This is the same for all of the days and months.

*You can also combine the times of day from earlier with the days of the week. But they're both nouns. To do this, therefore, we must combine the two words into one, as in &quot;Dienstagnacht&quot; (Tuesday night).

'''Culture Note:''' The German week begins on Monday.

&lt;big&gt;[[German/Level_I/Freizeit/Problems#Days and Months|Section Problems]]&gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

==Dates==

|-
|thirty-first of||einunddreißigster
|-

|}

*The ordinal numbers from 2 to 19 take the endings ''t''  and from 20 upwards take the ending ''st''

*For example &quot;on the 25th of December&quot;, 
:Simply say &quot;am fünfundzwanzigste'''n''' Dezember.&quot; 
:In other cases you say &quot;fünfundzwanzigste'''r''' Dezember&quot; or &quot;der fünfundzwanzigst'''e''' Dezember&quot;.

*In Germany, dates are written out in the logical order '''''Day'' . ''Month'' . ''Year''''', instead of the American ''Month''/''Day''/''Year''.
:German uses a dot instead of a slash. Do not use the slash in dates, as it is unusual and confusing because you cannot tell if &quot;4/6&quot; means 4th of June (4.6.) or 6th of April (6.4.) 

&lt;big&gt;[[German/Level_I/Freizeit/Problems#Dates|Section Problems]]&gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

===Birthdays===

|-
|Here is your present!||Hier ist dein Geschenk!
|-
|Thank you!||Dankeschön!
|-
|That's a nice party!||Das ist eine tolle Party!
|}

*To say, &quot;My birthday is on November 13th&quot;, say, &quot;Ich habe am dreizehnten November Geburtstag.&quot; 
Here ''am dreizehnten November'', ''am 13. November'', ''am dreizehnten elften'' and ''am 13. 11.'' represent the same date.
:Note the order; it translates back literally as &quot;I have on the 13th of November birthday.&quot;

|Summer||Sommer
|-

|Winter||Winter
|-
|in (the)||im
|}

To say &quot;in Summer&quot;, say &quot;im Sommer&quot;. For example, 

*''Im Sommer spiele ich Baseball.''
:I play baseball in summer.

The time always goes before the verb and the subject. (time, verb, and subject)

&lt;big&gt;[[German/Level_I/Freizeit/Problems#Seasons|Section Problems]]&gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

==Periods of Time==

If you want to express a certain period of time, but it doesn't have a specific name, like ''Nachmittag'', you can do it like this:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{German table|Vocabulary|Seasons|Jahreszeiten|0|2}}
!German||Time
|-
|von||Starting Time
|-
|bis||Ending Time
|}

*This is the same as ''from ... till ...'' in English.

*This can also apply with dates. For example, &quot;Wir haben Schule (school) von Montag bis Freitag&quot;.

*'''Exceptions'''
:Wir haben frei vo''m'' fünfundzwanzigsten Dezember bis ''zum'' zweiten Januar.

&lt;big&gt;[[German/Level_I/Freizeit/Problems#Periods of Time|Section Problems]]&gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

==How often?==

''Wie oft?'', there are many ways to answer this question. Two are &quot;once, twice, or three times in a ...&quot; or &quot;always, often, or never.&quot;

===A Number or Times===

To say, &quot;once a month&quot;, or &quot;four times a week&quot;, add ''&quot;mal&quot;'' to the end of the number and use the examples below.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{German table|Vocabulary|Daily|Täglich|0|2}}

|only||nur
|}

*To apply these words, put them in the sentence, '''after the verb and subject, but before the sport/activity'''. 

*You can also use 'nur' to say things like, ''Sie spielt nur manchmal Tennis.'' 

*Note that if this is translated word-for-word, it becomes, ''She plays only sometimes tennis.'' That's just the way German is.

==Time-Related Words==
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{German table|Vocabulary|Sometimes|Manchmal|0|2}}
!English||German
|-
|Time||die Zeit
|-
|Free time||die Freizeit
|}

*To say you have time, ignore the 'die'. 
*To say when, insert other phrases you have learned this lesson. For example, ''Ich habe am Samstagabend Zeit.''
::Note that the word order is the same as that of birthdays. You can use Freizeit in the same way.

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Lesson I.5: Geburtstag&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
----

==Asking the Time==

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{German table|Vocabulary|Time|Zeit|243|3}}
!||English||German
|-
|||What time is it? (How late is it?)||Wie spät ist es?
|-
|||What time is it? (How much clock is it?)||Wie viel Uhr ist es?
|-
|&lt;small&gt;Ef&lt;/small&gt;||It is 10:15||Es ist zehn Uhr fünfzehn.
|-
|&lt;small&gt;BoA&lt;/small&gt;||It is 10:15||Viertel nach Zehn 
|-
|&lt;small&gt;BoA&lt;/small&gt;||It is 10:45||Viertel vor Elf 
|-
|}

In table above you might have seen the Ef and BoA, those stand for exact form and before or after. Specific times can be expressed in two ways: Exact form (e.g. &quot;Four thirty-seven&quot;) or before or after form (e.g. &quot;Twenty-three to five&quot;).

==Exact form==

This form is the same as English. For example,

*'''Es ist zehn Uhr fünfzehn.'''
:It is 10:15 a.m.
 
*The new word '''Uhr''' means &quot;o'clock&quot;, and is used in all exact times, it comes between the hour and the minute.

*Also, German-speakers generally use the 24-hour clock when expressing time this way, therefore, 3:29 p.m. (15:29) is &quot;fünfzehn Uhr neunundzwanzig.&quot;

&lt;big&gt;[[German/Level_I/Freizeit/Problems#Exact form|Section Problems]]&gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

==Before or After the Hour==
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{German table|Vocabulary|BoA|BoA|111|2}}
|-
!English||German
|-
|After, Past||nach
|-
|Till, to||vor
|-
|quarter||Viertel
|-
|half before||Halb
|}

*Use the same form as in English. For example, 10:57 can be said as, &quot;drei vor Elf(three minutes to eleven&quot;. Likewise, 4:10 would be &quot;zehn nach Vier(ten minutes past four).&quot; 

*Typically, use the smaller time interval with 'nach' or 'vor'. Don't say, &quot;siebenundfünfzig nach Zehn.&quot; 

*You don't need a ''vor'' when using halb. Be careful! In German it´s not &quot;half past&quot;, but rather &quot;half to&quot;.  For example, 11:30 can be said as, &quot;Halb zwölf&quot;.

* 5:15 can be said as &quot;Viertel nach Fünf&quot;, 5:45 would be &quot;Viertel vor Sechs&quot;.

'''Note:''' This is only used with informal time telling. You don't use 'Uhr'.

&lt;big&gt;[[German/Level_I/Freizeit/Problems#Before/After the Hour|Section Problems]]&gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

===Saying When You Do Something===
''Wann spielst du Football?'' (Football means American Football. The much more popular soccer would be &quot;Fußball&quot;, which lit. means Football)

To say you play a sport at a certain time in English, you would answer, &quot;I play football ''at'' 3:30.&quot; This is all the same in German, with the translation of 'at' being ''um''. That makes the above response &quot;Ich spiele Football um halb Vier.&quot; or &quot;Ich spiele Football um fünfzehn Uhr dreißig.&quot;.

&lt;big&gt;[[German/Level_I/Freizeit/Problems#Saying When You Do Something|Section Problems]]&gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

==Times of Day==

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{German table|Vocabulary|Times of Day|Tageszeiten|364|2}}
!English||German
|-
|the day||der Tag
|-
|today||heute
|-
|tomorrow||morgen
|-
|the day after tomorrow||übermorgen
|-
|yesterday||gestern
|-
|the day before yesterday||vorgestern
|-
|(early) morning||Morgen*
|-
|morning||Vormittag
|-
|afternoon||Nachmittag
|-
|evening||Abend
|-
|night||Nacht
|}

*In German, except the capitalization, the words for &quot;morning&quot; and &quot;tomorrow&quot; are the same: ''morgen''. If you want to say ''tomorrow morning'' use ''morgen früh'' (meaning: ''early on the next day'').

*The words above can be combined into phrases like &quot;gestern Abend&quot;.

*To say &quot;2 days before yesterday&quot; use '''vorvorgestern''' (but 3 days before yesterday won't be ''vorvorvorgestern'')

&lt;big&gt;[[German/Level_I/Freizeit/Problems#Other Time|Section Problems]]&gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

==Days and Months==
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{German table|Vocabulary|Days|Tage|224|2}}
!English||German
|-
|Monday||Montag
|-
|Tuesday||Dienstag
|-
|Wednesday||Mittwoch
|-
|Thursday||Donnerstag
|-
|Friday||Freitag
|-
|Saturday||Samstag
|-
|Sunday||Sonntag
|}

*Instead of &quot;Samstag&quot; you can say &quot;Sonnabend&quot;.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{German table|Vocabulary|Months|Monate|328|2}}
!English||German
|-
|January||Januar
|-
|February||Februar
|-
|March||März
|-
|April||April
|-
|May||Mai
|-
|June||Juni
|-
|July||Juli
|-
|August||August
|-
|September||September
|-
|October||Oktober
|-
|November||November
|-
|December||Dezember
|}

*To say &quot;on Monday&quot;, say ''&quot;am Montag&quot;'' or whatever applies. To say &quot;in January&quot;, say ''&quot;im Januar&quot;'' or whatever applies. This is the same for all of the days and months.

*You can also combine the times of day from earlier with the days of the week. But they're both nouns. To do this, therefore, we must combine the two words into one, as in &quot;Dienstagnacht&quot; (Tuesday night).

'''Culture Note:''' The German week begins on Monday.

&lt;big&gt;[[German/Level_I/Freizeit/Problems#Days and Months|Section Problems]]&gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

==Dates==
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{German table|Vocabulary|Dates|Daten|305|2}}
!English||German
|-
|first of (''month'')||erster
|-
|second of (''month'')||zweiter
|-
|third of (''month'')||dritter
|-
|fourth of (''month'')||vierter
|-
|seventh of (''month'')||siebter
|-
|eighth of (''month'')||achter
|-
| -th of [''below 20'']||-ter
|-
|tenth of||zehnter
|-
|twentieth of||zwanzigster
|-
|thirty-first of||einunddreißigster
|-
| -th of [''20 to 31'']||-ster
|-
|on (the)||am
|}

*The ordinal numbers from 2 to 19 take the endings ''t''  and from 20 upwards take the ending ''st''

*For example &quot;on the 25th of December&quot;, 
:Simply say &quot;am fünfundzwanzigste'''n''' Dezember.&quot; 
:In other cases you say &quot;fünfundzwanzigste'''r''' Dezember&quot; or &quot;der fünfundzwanzigst'''e''' Dezember&quot;.

*In Germany, dates are written out in the logical order '''''Day'' . ''Month'' . ''Year''''', instead of the American ''Month''/''Day''/''Year''.
:German uses a dot instead of a slash. Do not use the slash in dates, as it is unusual and confusing because you cannot tell if &quot;4/6&quot; means 4th of June (4.6.) or 6th of April (6.4.) 

&lt;big&gt;[[German/Level_I/Freizeit/Problems#Dates|Section Problems]]&gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

===Birthdays===
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{German table|Vocabulary|Birthdays|Geburtstage|237|2}}
!English||German
|-
|Birthday||Geburtstag
|-
|Happy Birthday||Alles Gute zum Geburtstag!
|-
|Best wishes on your birthday!||Herzlichen Glückwunsch zum Geburtstag!
|-
|Here is your present!||Hier ist dein Geschenk!
|-
|Thank you!||Dankeschön!
|-
|That's a nice party!||Das ist eine tolle Party!
|}

*To say, &quot;My birthday is on November 13th&quot;, say, &quot;Ich habe am dreizehnten November Geburtstag.&quot; 
Here ''am dreizehnten November'', ''am 13. November'', ''am dreizehnten elften'' and ''am 13. 11.'' represent the same date.
:Note the order; it translates back literally as &quot;I have on the 13th of November birthday.&quot;

&lt;big&gt;[[German/Level_I/Freizeit/Problems#Birthdays|Section Problems]]&gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

==Seasons==
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{German table|Vocabulary|Seasons|Jahreszeiten|0|2}}
!English||German
|-
|Spring||Frühling
|-
|Summer||Sommer
|-
|Autumn||Herbst
|-
|Winter||Winter
|-
|in (the)||im
|}

To say &quot;in Summer&quot;, say &quot;im Sommer&quot;. For example, 

*''Im Sommer spiele ich Baseball.''
:I play baseball in summer.

The time always goes before the verb and the subject. (time, verb, and subject)

&lt;big&gt;[[German/Level_I/Freizeit/Problems#Seasons|Section Problems]]&gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

==Periods of Time==

If you want to express a certain period of time, but it doesn't have a specific name, like ''Nachmittag'', you can do it like this:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{German table|Vocabulary|Seasons|Jahreszeiten|0|2}}
!German||Time
|-
|von||Starting Time
|-
|bis||Ending Time
|}

*This is the same as ''from ... till ...'' in English.

*This can also apply with dates. For example, &quot;Wir haben Schule (school) von Montag bis Freitag&quot;.

*'''Exceptions'''
:Wir haben frei vo''m'' fünfundzwanzigsten Dezember bis ''zum'' zweiten Januar.

&lt;big&gt;[[German/Level_I/Freizeit/Problems#Periods of Time|Section Problems]]&gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

==How often?==

''Wie oft?'', there are many ways to answer this question. Two are &quot;once, twice, or three times in a ...&quot; or &quot;always, often, or never.&quot;

===A Number or Times===

To say, &quot;once a month&quot;, or &quot;four times a week&quot;, add ''&quot;mal&quot;'' to the end of the number and use the examples below.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{German table|Vocabulary|Daily|Täglich|0|2}}
!English||German
|-
|Day||''am'' Tag
|-
|Week||''in der'' Woche
|-
|Month||''im'' Monat
|-
|Year||''im'' Jahr
|-
|Weekend||''am'' Wochenende
|-
|Morning||''morgens''
|-
|Evening||''abends''
|-
|Afternoon||''nachmittags''
|-
|Night||''nachts'' oder ''in der'' Nacht
|}

'''For example'''

*''Wir kegeln zweimal in der Woche.''
:We bowl twice a week.

&lt;big&gt;[[German/Level_I/Freizeit/Problems#How often?|Section Problems]]&gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;big&gt;[[/Problems#Sports and Activities|Section Problems]]&gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

==Spielen, Machen and Other Verbs==

All three verbs that you were introduced to in Lesson 2 are irregular in some way; however, most verbs are regular verbs. In English, the regular conjugation is very easy: only for the third person singular an &quot;-s&quot; is added to the infinitive (&quot;to see&quot; becomes &quot;he/she/it sees&quot;). Unfortunately, there are more endings in German. The following two tables show the endings for the two regular verbs ''spielen'' (''to play'') and ''machen'' (''to do; to make''):

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{German table|Verb|to play|spielen|187|7}}
!colspan=&quot;2&quot;| 
!colspan=&quot;2&quot;|English
!colspan=&quot;2&quot;|German
|-
!rowspan=&quot;3&quot;|singular!!1st person
|I||play
|ich||spiel'''e'''
|-
!2nd person
|you||play
|du||spiel'''st'''
|-
!3rd person
|he/she/it||play'''s'''
|er/sie/es||spiel'''t'''
|-
!rowspan=&quot;3&quot;|plural!!1st person
|we||play
|wir||spiel'''en'''
|-
!2nd person
|you||play
|ihr||spiel'''t'''
|-
!3rd person
|they||play
|sie||spiel'''en'''
|}

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{German table|Verb|to do_make|machen|152|6}}
!colspan=&quot;2&quot;| 
!colspan=&quot;2&quot;|English
!colspan=&quot;2&quot;|German
|-
!rowspan=&quot;3&quot;|singular!!1st person
|I||do/make
|ich||mach'''e'''
|-
!2nd person
|you||do/make
|du||mach'''st'''
|-
!3rd person
|he/she/it||do'''es'''/make'''s'''
|er/sie/es||mach'''t'''
|-
!rowspan=&quot;3&quot;|plural!!1st person
|we||do/make
|wir||mach'''en'''
|-
!2nd person
|you||do/make
|ihr||mach'''t'''
|-
!3rd person
|they||do/make
|sie||mach'''en'''
|}

As you see, the endings are the same for corresponding forms of ''spielen'' and ''machen''. In fact, they are the same for all regular verbs. Thus, you can always just remove the ''-en'' from the infinitive of a regular German verb to form the stem (e.g., ''spielen'' becomes ''spiel-'' and ''machen'' becomes ''mach-'') and then add the ending for the particular person. Here is a table with these endings:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{German table|Verb|conjugation|Konjugation|168|6|German Verb - conjugation.ogg}}
!colspan=&quot;2&quot;| 
!colspan=&quot;2&quot;|English
!colspan=&quot;2&quot;|German
|-
!rowspan=&quot;3&quot;|singular!!1st person
|I||'''-'''
|ich||'''-e'''
|-
!2nd person
|you||'''-'''
|du||'''-st'''
|-
!3rd person
|he/she/it||'''-s'''
|er/sie/es||'''-t'''
|-
!rowspan=&quot;3&quot;|plural!!1st person
|we||'''-'''
|wir||'''-en'''
|-
!2nd person
|you||'''-'''
|ihr||'''-t'''
|-
!3rd person
|they||'''-'''
|sie||'''-en'''*
|}
&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;The form for ''you (polite)'' — ''Sie'' is exactly the same as for the plural, 3rd person pronoun ''they'' — ''sie''.


===Examples===

*''Was machst du?''
:What are you doing?
*''Ich spiele Basketball.''
:I play basketball.
*''Spielst du Fußball?''
:Do you play soccer?
*''Ich mache Hausaufgaben.''
:I do homework.
*''Er macht Hausaufgaben.''
:He does homework.
*''Machst du Sport?''
:Do you play sports?

Note that in English one ''plays'' sport, while in German one ''does'' sport. You can also use the question words from [[German/Level I/Bitte_buchstabieren_Sie#Forming Questions|Lesson 3]] to form more combinations:

*''Warum spielst du Baseball?''
:Why do you play baseball?
*''Wann machst du die Hausaufgaben?''
:When do you do the homework?

To say &quot;not&quot;, use &quot;nicht&quot;. &quot;Nicht&quot; goes after the verb but before the sport. 

*''Wer spielt nicht Fußball?''
:Who doesn't play soccer?
*''Wir spielen nicht Tennis.''
:We don't play tennis.

===Compound Sentences===
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{German table|Vocabulary|Conjunctions|Verbindungen|72|2}}
!English||German
|-
|and||und
|-
|but||aber
|-
|or||oder
|}

Both German and English have compound sentences; the applications of these are enormous. They can be used in lists and also in compound sentences. For example,

*''Ich spiele Basketball und er spielt auch Basketball.''
:I play basketball, and he also plays basketball.

The new word, ''also — auch'' is very important. The one grammar rule about ''auch'' is that it always comes after the verb.

||(to) read||lesen

||(to) see||sehen
|-
||(to) work||arbeiten
|-
||(to) write||schreiben
|-
||(to) swim||schwimmen
|}

''Schauen'', ''schreiben'' and ''schwimmen'' are all regular verbs; i.e., they follow regular conjugations. To conjugate them, you first remove the ''-en'' from the infinitive to form the stem (i.e., ''schau-'', ''schreib-'', and ''schwimm-''), and then add the correct ending. Here is an example:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!verb (infinitive)||first step (stem)||conjugated form
|-
|schau'''en'''||schau-||ich schau'''e'''
|}

''Arbeiten'' is an irregular verb; however, it has a simple change. Whenever the ending starts with a consonant, an ''-e-'' is added before it. For example, ''du arbeit'''e'''st'' (not &lt;s&gt;''du arbeitst''&lt;/s&gt;). As well as ''er/sie/es/ihr arbeit'''e'''t'' (not &lt;s&gt;''er/sie/es/ihr arbeitt''&lt;/s&gt;).

''Lesen'' is also an irregular verb. For the second and third person singular the form is ''liest'', i.e., ''du/er/sie/es l'''ies'''t'' (not &lt;s&gt;''du lesst''&lt;/s&gt;). 

''Sehen'' is the last irregular verb. The second person singular is ''du s'''ie'''hst'' and the third person singular is ''er/sie/es s'''ie'''ht''.

&lt;big&gt;[[/Problems#Other Verbs and Their Conjugations|Section Problems]]&gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

===Two More Verb Forms===

There are two common verb forms in English that just don't exist in German: the ing-form (or: present progressive); e.g., &quot;I am playing&quot; or &quot;he is making&quot;; and forms with &quot;to do&quot;; e.g., &quot;I do play&quot; or &quot;he does not play&quot;.

The simple rule is: these constructions don't exist in German. Thus, you should translate ''I am playing'' to ''ich spiele''. Similarly, ''I do play'' is also translated to ''ich spiele''. Anything else (&lt;s&gt;''ich mache spielen''&lt;/s&gt; or &lt;s&gt;''ich bin spielen''&lt;/s&gt;) is either not possible in German or has a different meaning.

The phrase ''I do not play'' should be translated to ''ich spiele nicht'' (literally: ''I play not'') since ''nicht'' (''not'') comes usually after the verb. This may sound like Early Modern English in a play by Shakespeare, and this is no coincidence since German and English are both West Germanic languages.

&lt;big&gt;[[/Problems#Two More Verb Forms|Section Problems]]&gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

==Expressing likes and dislikes==
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{German table|Vocabulary|Expressing likes and dislikes|Vorlieben und Abneigungen ausdrücken|1|2}}
!English||German
|-
|What do you like to do?||Was machst du gern*?
|-
|I like to play.||Ich spiele gerne*.
|-
|What do you like to play?||Was spielst du gerne*?
|-
|I like to play soccer.||Ich spiele gerne* Fußball.
|-
|}
&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; ''gern'' and ''gerne'' can be used interchangeably.

In German, there are several ways to express likes and dislikes; this is just one of them. You can also add other verbs for other activities, e.g., ''I like to read.'' — ''Ich lese gern.'' or ''I like to work.'' — ''Ich arbeite gern.'' or ''I like to watch TV.'' — ''Ich schaue gern Fernsehen.''

To express preference, you can use ''lieber'' instead of ''gern.'' For example, ''I prefer to play basketball.'' — ''Ich spiele lieber Basketball.'' or ''I prefer to read.'' — ''Ich lese lieber.''

To express favorite activities, you can use ''am liebsten'' (meaning ''most of all'') instead of ''lieber'' or ''gern''. For example, ''Most of all, I like to play chess.'' — ''Ich spiele am liebsten Schach.''

To express dislikes, you can use ''nicht gern'' instead of ''gern'', for example ''I don't like to swim.'' — ''Ich schwimme nicht gern.'' or ''I don't like to work.'' — ''Ich arbeite nicht gern.'' or ''I don't like to play soccer.'' — ''Ich spiele nicht gern Fußball.'' 

&lt;big&gt;[[/Problems#Expressing likes and dislikes|Section Problems]]&gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

==Numbers==

Numbers are among the most important and most useful words: we need them to talk about time, amounts, money, etc. Even if you are &quot;just&quot; a tourist, you often cannot avoid numbers. Learning numbers can be a bit of a pain; thus, here is an advice: whenever you have time, count something in German; e.g., steps, cars, people, seconds, whatever: just count.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{German table|Vocabulary|Numbers|Zahlen|536|2}}
!English||German
|-
|zero||null*
|-
|one||eins
|-
|two||zwei**

|-
|24 - 29||analogous to 22 and 23
|-

|-

|-

|-

|-

|-
|ninety||neunzig*
|-
|hundred||hundert (or: einhundert)
|-
|hundred and one||hunderteins*
|-
|two hundred||zweihundert* 
|-
|thousand||tausend (or: eintausend)
|-
|two thousand||zweitausend*
|-
|}
&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;Some numbers are missing in the audio recording.

&lt;nowiki&gt;**&lt;/nowiki&gt;Some people sometimes say ''zwo'' instead of ''zwei'' in order to distinguishing it more clearly from ''drei'' (''three'').


Notice the pattern: ''-teen'' translates to ''-zehn'', and ''-ty'' to ''-zig''.

There is one big problem with the numbers: in German the unit position comes before the tens and is connected by ''und'' (''and''). For example: ''twenty-three'' — ''dreiundzwanzig'' (literally: ''three-and-twenty''),
''twenty-four'' — ''vierundzwanzig'', ''thirty-five'' — ''fünfunddreißig'', ''fourty-six'' — ''sechsundvierzig'', etc.

One exception is ''eins'' which becomes ''ein-'' in 21, 31, 41, etc.: ''twenty-one'' — ''einundzwanzig'' (literally: ''one-and-twenty''),
''thirty-one'' — ''einunddreißig'', ''fourty-one'' — ''einundvierzig'', etc.

Actually, German is not the only language with this funny order of numbers, Danish (another Germanic language) does it the same way.

&lt;big&gt;[[/Problems#Numbers|Section Problems]]&gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

=What's On the Test=

To go straight to the lesson test, go [[/Test|here]].

The test will have four parts to it: Grammar (79 points), Translating (95 points), Reading Comprehension (20 points), Vocabulary (20 points), and Previous Topics (10 points) in that order.

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Lesson I.1: Wie heißt du? (1. Teil)&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
----

This lesson deals with basic conversation topics such as saying hello and  goodbye and asking people how they are feeling. This lesson features audio recordings by native speakers to help you with the pronunciation.

==Dialogue==
Read and listen to the following dialogue between two students: Franz and Greta. You don't have to understand anything! You should rather try to find out how each word is pronounced.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{German table|Dialogue|What's your name? (1st Part)|Wie heißt du? (1. Teil)|134|2|Dialogue franz greta 1.ogg}}
!Franz
|Hallo, ich bin Franz. Wie heißt du?
|-
!Greta
|Hallo, Franz. Ich heiße Greta. Wie geht's?
|-
!Franz
|Es geht mir gut. Kennst du den Lehrer?
|-
!Greta
|Ja, er heißt Herr Weiß.
|-
!Franz
|Oh, danke, Greta. Bis dann!
|-
!Greta
|Wiedersehen!
|}

{{German/Exercise|Listen carefully!
|The German pronunciation of many letters is similar to the English pronunciation, but there are also many differences. Try to answer the following question by listening carefully. Write your answers on a piece of paper or in a text file before you check them.
# How is the &quot;a&quot; in &quot;Hallo&quot;, &quot;Franz&quot;, &quot;Greta&quot;, &quot;ja&quot;, &quot;danke&quot;, and &quot;dann&quot; pronounced?
# How is the &quot;i&quot; in &quot;ich&quot; and &quot;bis&quot; pronounced?

# How is the &quot;e&quot; in &quot;es&quot;, &quot;kennst&quot;, &quot;er&quot; and &quot;Herr&quot; pronounced?
# How is the first &quot;e&quot; in &quot;gehen&quot;, &quot;Greta&quot;, and &quot;geht&quot; pronounced?
|
# Similar to the &quot;a&quot; in &quot;hard&quot;.
# Similar to the &quot;i&quot; in &quot;hit&quot;.
# Similar to the &quot;ch&quot; in the Scottish word &quot;Loch&quot;.
# &quot;z&quot; is pronounced like &quot;ts&quot;.
# Similar to the &quot;v&quot; in &quot;vat&quot;.
# Similar to the &quot;ee&quot; in &quot;meet&quot;.
# &quot;ei&quot; is pronounced like &quot;ai&quot; in German or like the &quot;i&quot; in the English word &quot;time&quot;.
# &quot;ß&quot; is pronounced like &quot;s&quot;.
# Similar to &quot;e&quot; in &quot;pet&quot;.
# This is a long German &quot;e&quot;; the sound doesn't exist in English. It is between the &quot;i&quot; in &quot;hit&quot; and the &quot;e&quot; in &quot;pet&quot;.

==Hellos and Goodbyes==
There are many ways of saying hello and goodbye in German; some of them are:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{German table|Vocabulary|Greetings|Grüße|144|2}}
|-
!English||German
|-
|rowspan=3 valign=top|Hello!||Hallo!*
|-
||Servus! (used in eastern Austria, informal)
|-
||Moin! (used in northern Germany)
|-
|rowspan=3 valign=top|Good morning!||Moin Moin! (used in northern Germany)
|-
||Guten Morgen!*
|-
||Morgen! (shorter)
|-
|rowspan=2 valign=top|Good day!||Guten Tag!*
|-
||Tag! (used in Germany, shorter)
|-
||Good evening!||Guten Abend!*
|-
||Hello!||Grüß Gott! (used in southern Germany, Austria and South Tyrol)     
|-             
|rowspan=2 valign=top|Goodbye!||Auf Wiedersehen!*
|-             
||Wiedersehen! (shorter)
|-
|rowspan=3 valign=top|Bye!||Tschüss!*
|-
||Ciao! (pronounced as in Italian)
|-
||Servus! (used in eastern Austria, informal)
|-
||See you later!||Bis später!*
|-
|rowspan=2 valign=top|See you!||Bis dann!*
|-
||Bis bald!*
|-
||See you soon!||Bis gleich!
|-
||Good night!||Gute Nacht!*
|}

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;You will need to know each expression with an asterisk (*) after it. The others, of course, would be useful to know if you are traveling to regions where they are used. (As you can see, the different German-speaking regions often have their own ways of saying hello and goodbye. However, you will not be required to know any of these less common phrases for any problems or tests.)

The more formal phrases are ''guten Morgen'', ''guten Tag'', and ''auf Wiedersehen''. The less formal ones are ''tschüss'', ''Tag'', ''servus'', and ''ciao''. The others are somewhat neutral on the formal-informal scale. 


{{German/Exercise|Hellos and goodbyes
|How would you say hello and goodbye in these situations:
# You meet a friend in the morning.
# You meet a teacher in the classroom in the afternoon.
# You meet a classmate in the evening.
# You talk to a shop assistant in the morning.
| Avoiding local variants, these are some options:
# Hello: Hallo!/(Guten) Morgen!/(Guten) Tag! Goodbye: Tschüss!/Bis später!/Bis dann!/Bis bald!
# Hello: Guten Tag! Goodbye: Auf Wiedersehen.
# Hello: Hallo!/Guten Abend! Goodbye: Tschüss!/Bis dann!/Bis bald! 
# Hello: Guten Morgen!/Guten Tag! Goodbye: (Auf) Wiedersehen! 
}}


==Mr. and Mrs.==
In German, ''Herr'' and ''Frau'' are used instead of ''Mr.'' and ''Mrs.'' before a last name; e.g., ''Mr. Schwarz'' – ''Herr Schwarz''.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{German table|Vocabulary|Mr. &amp; Ms.|Herr und Frau|28|2}}
|-
!English||German
|-
|Mr.||Herr
|-
|Mrs.||Frau
|}

''Frau'' is used for married and unmarried women. Some people still use ''Miss'' – ''Fräulein'' in spoken German but it is no longer used in written German since it is considered an inappropriate discrimination of unmarried women.

Literally, ''der Herr'' means ''the gentleman'' and ''die Frau'' means ''the woman''.  If you use these words without a last name after them, you have to use an article before them; e.g., ''der Herr'' or ''die Frau''. This is actually just like in English, for example: 
* '''The''' woman's name is Mrs. Weiß – '''Die''' Frau heißt Frau Weiß. 

Note also that the German translation of ''the man'' is ''der Mann'' and ''the lady'' should be translated to ''die Dame''. Thus, without last names you would rather use these pairs:
* man and woman – Mann und Frau
* men and women – Männer und Frauen
* lady and gentleman – Dame und Herr
* ladies and gentlemen – Damen und Herren


{{German/Exercise|Mr. &amp; Mrs.
|Translate the following words and phrases to German:
# Mr. Schwarz
# the man
# The man's name is Mr. Schwarz.
# the woman
# The woman's name is Mrs. Schwarz.
# ladies and gentlemen
|
# Herr Schwarz
# der Mann
# Der Mann heißt Herr Schwarz.
# die Frau
# Die Frau heißt Frau Schwarz.
# Damen und Herren
}}

==Replies to ''Wie geht's?''==
There are many ways to reply to the question ''Wie geht's?'' Here are some of them:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{German table|Vocabulary|How are you?|Wie geht's?|245|2}}
|-
!English||German
|-
|How are you?||Wie geht's? (longer: Wie geht es dir?)*
|-
|great||prima
|-
|good||gut
|-
|very good||sehr gut
|-
|miserable||miserabel
|-
|bad||schlecht
|-
|not (so) good||nicht (so) gut
|-
|O.K.||ganz gut
|-
|all right||Es geht so. (Or shorter: Geht so.) 
|}
&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;The more formal form is ''Wie geht es Ihnen?''

After replying to the question, you could continue with:
* And how are you? — Und wie geht es dir? (formal: Und wie geht es Ihnen?)
Or shorter:
* And you? — Und dir? (or: Und selbst?; or formal: Und Ihnen?)


{{German/Exercise|Wie geht's?
|Fill in the blanks:
# _______ geht's? 
# Prima. _______ dir? 
# Es _______ so.
# Wie geht _______ Ihnen?
# Sehr _______. _______ selbst?
# Ganz _______, danke.
|
# ''Wie'' geht's? 
# Prima. ''Und'' dir? 
# Es ''geht'' so.
# Wie geht ''es'' Ihnen?
# Sehr ''gut''. ''Und'' selbst?
# Ganz ''gut'', danke.
}}


==Test==

The test consists of three parts: pronunciation, vocabulary, and translation. As always, you should write down your answers before you check them. (Writing the German words is in fact a great way to practice the spelling of German words.) The vocabulary and translation problems are all from English to German because this is what you have to learn if you want to communicate in German. Once you are able to translate an English word to the corresponding German word, it won't be any problem to translate the German word back to English.

# &quot;f&quot;, &quot;r&quot;, &quot;n&quot; similar to the English pronunciation of these letters, &quot;a&quot; as in &quot;hard&quot;, &quot;z&quot; like &quot;ts&quot;.
# &quot;w&quot; as the &quot;v&quot; in &quot;vat&quot;, &quot;ie&quot; as the &quot;ee&quot; in &quot;meet&quot;, &quot;eh&quot; is the long German &quot;e&quot; (between &quot;i&quot; in &quot;hit&quot; and a &quot;e&quot; in &quot;pet&quot;), the other letters are pronounced similarly in English.

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Lesson I.2: Wie heißt du? (2. Teil)&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
----

The dialogue of this lesson is a conversation between two persons: Franz and Mr. Schwarz. While Franz uses the formal ''Sie'' to address Mr. Schwarz, the latter uses the informal ''du'' to address Franz. We also discuss some grammar: ''subject pronouns'' and some important verbs in the present tense.

==Dialogue==
In this short dialogue Mr. Schwarz uses the informal form ''you'' – ''du''. 
while Franz uses the formal translation of ''you'' – ''Sie''. When listening to the dialogue, try to find out how the word ''Sie'' is pronounced.

==''Sie'' and ''du''==
Why is Franz using the formal form of ''you'' — ''Sie'' while Mr. Schwarz is using the informal of ''you'' — ''du''?

First of all you should realize that Franz addresses Mr. Schwarz with his last name while Mr. Schwarz addresses Franz with his first name. This is probably the most important rule: if you (would) address someone with his or her last name, you should use the formal ''Sie''. On the other hand, if you are using the first name, you should use ''du''. Anything else would sound funny.

So, when do Germans address other people with their first name and say ''du''? 
* Some cases are very clear: children, relatives, and friends are always addressed with ''du''. (Mr. Schwarz uses ''du'' because Franz is still a child. Otherwise Mr. Schwarz would either use ''Sie'' or Franz would also use ''du''.) 
* Students (at universities etc.) usually say ''du'' to other students and everyone else who is of their age or younger. 
* The situation is not so clear for colleagues in companies. Fortunately, there is another rule for grown-ups: any two grown-ups address each other in the same way, either with ''du'' or ''Sie'', but never does only one of them use ''du'' and the other ''Sie''. Thus, if in doubt, you can just copy how the other person addresses you. 
* In all other situations you should use ''Sie''. If a German thinks that it would be more appropriate to say ''du'', he or she will be happy to suggest to use ''du''. On the other hand, it is almost always considered impolite to go from ''du'' to ''Sie''; thus, you shouldn't put someone in a position where he or she wants to suggest to use ''Sie'' instead of ''du''.

==Subject Pronouns==

A ''noun'' is a word that describes a thing or being, e.g. &quot;apple&quot;, &quot;woman&quot;, &quot;man&quot;, etc. ''Pronouns'' are the little words that refer to previously mentioned nouns, e.g. &quot;it&quot;, &quot;she&quot;, &quot;he&quot;, or even &quot;we&quot;, &quot;him&quot;, etc. 
 
The ''subject'' of a sentence is the noun or pronoun that the sentence is about. Usually it is the most active thing or being of the sentence. For example, in the sentence &quot;The woman ate an apple.&quot;, both &quot;woman&quot; and &quot;apple&quot; are nouns, but &quot;woman&quot; is the subject of the sentence because the sentence is about the action performed by the woman. (If you are curious: &quot;apple&quot; is the direct object of the sentence.)

If we replace the nouns of the example by pronouns, the sentence becomes: &quot;She ate it.&quot; In this example, &quot;she&quot; and &quot;it&quot; are pronouns. The subject of this sentence is the pronoun &quot;she&quot; and therefore this kind of pronoun is called a ''subject pronoun''.

Now that you know about the English subject pronouns, here is a table of them with their German counterparts. Note that ''you'' corresponds to three different words in German, depending on whether you address one or more persons and whether you are using a more formal or more familiar way of addressing them. 

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{German table|Grammar|Subject Pronouns|Subjekt-Pronomina|87|4}}
!colspan=&quot;2&quot;| 
!English||German
|-
!rowspan=&quot;3&quot;|singular!!1st person
|I
|ich
|-
!2nd person
|you
|du, Sie*
|-
!3rd person
|he, she, it
|er, sie, es
|-
!rowspan=&quot;3&quot;|plural!!1st person
|we
|wir
|-
!2nd person
|you
|ihr, Sie*
|-
!3rd person
|they
|sie
|}

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;''Sie'' is the formal (polite) version of ''du'' and ''ihr''. 


{{German/Exercise|Subject pronouns
|Try to translate these English pronouns to German:

# we
# they
# he
# you
# I
# you (formal)
# it
# you guys
# she
|
# wir
# sie
# er
# du
# ich
# Sie (Make sure it's capitalized!)
# es
# ihr
# sie
}}

==Names==
To say the name of someone or something you can use ''to be called'' — ''heißen''. You have already seen some forms of the verb ''heißen''. Here is a more systematic table with all the forms in the present tense. Note that the subject pronouns are capitalized because they start the sentences.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{German table|Grammar|Names|Namen|179|2}}
|-
!English||German
|-
|My name is...||Ich heiße ...
|-
|His/Her/Its name is...||Er/Sie/Es heißt ...
|-
|Their names are...||Sie heißen ...
|-
|Our names are...||Wir heißen ...
|-
|Your name is...||Du heißt ...
|-
|Your names are...||Ihr heißt ...
|-
|What is your name?||Wie heißt du?*
|-
|What are your names?||Wie heißt ihr?*
|}

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;Remember, the formal way to ask someone's name is to ask ''Wie heißen Sie?''

'''Note:''' There ''are'' possessive pronouns (e.g. &quot;my&quot;, &quot;your&quot;, &quot;his&quot;, her&quot;, ...) in German, they just don't apply here. For instance, native speakers usually don't say ''Mein Name ist ...'' (''My name is...'').


{{German/Exercise|Names
|Translate to German:
# Hello. My name is ____ (put your name here).
# What is your name?
# My name is Iris. 
# What is his name?
# His name is Andreas.
# What are their names?
# Their names are Gerd and Udo.
# Her name is Eda.
# Its name is Mensch-ärger-dich-nicht. (This is a popular board game in Germany.)
|
# Hallo. Ich heiße ____.
# Wie heißt du? / Wie heißen Sie?
# Ich heiße Iris.
# Wie heißt er?
# Er heißt Andreas.
# Wie heißen sie?
# Sie heißen Gerd und Udo.
# Sie heißt Eda.
# Es heißt Mensch-ärger-dich-nicht.
}}

==Important Verbs==

Verbs are the words that describe the action of a sentence, e.g. ''(to) run'', ''(to) call'', ''(to) be'', etc. ''Conjugation'' refers to changing the form of a verb depending on the subject of a sentence. For example, the verb ''to be'' – ''sein'' has several different forms: ''(I) am...'', ''(you) are...'', ''(he) is...'', etc. Most English verbs, however, have only two forms in the present tense, e.g., ''(I/you/we/they) run'' and ''(he/she/it) runs''. German verbs, on the other hand, have usually several forms in the present tense.

You have already learned the forms of one German verb: ''to be called'' – ''heißen''.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{German table|Verb|to be called|heißen|229|7|German Verb - heißen.ogg}}
!colspan=&quot;2&quot;| 
!English||German
|-
!rowspan=&quot;3&quot;|singular!!1st person
|I am called
|ich heiße
|-
!2nd person
|you are called
|du heißt
|-
!3rd person
|he/she/it is called
|er/sie/es heißt
|-
!rowspan=&quot;3&quot;|plural!!1st person
|we are called
|wir heißen
|-
!2nd person
|you are called
|ihr heißt
|-
!3rd person
|they are called
|sie heißen*
|}

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;The form of verbs for ''you (polite)'' — ''Sie'' is exactly the same as for the plural, 3rd person pronoun ''they'' — ''sie''.


Two extremely common verbs are ''to be'' — ''sein'' and ''to have'' — ''haben''. They are conjugated like this:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{German table|Verb|to be|sein|76|5|German Verb - sein.ogg}}
!colspan=&quot;2&quot;| 
!English||German
|-
!rowspan=&quot;3&quot;|singular!!1st person
|I am 
|ich bin
|-
!2nd person
|you are 
|du bist
|-
!3rd person
|he/she/it is 
|er/sie/es ist
|-
!rowspan=&quot;3&quot;|plural!!1st person
|we are 
|wir sind
|-
!2nd person
|you are 
|ihr seid
|-
!3rd person
|they are 
|sie sind*
|}

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;Don't forget that the form for ''you (polite)'' — ''Sie'' is the same as for the plural, 3rd person pronoun ''they'' — ''sie''.


{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{German table|Verb|to have|haben|140|5|German Verb - haben.ogg}}
!colspan=&quot;2&quot;| 
!English||German
|-
!rowspan=&quot;3&quot;|singular!!1st person
|I have
|ich habe
|-
!2nd person
|you have
|du hast
|-
!3rd person
|he/she/it has 
|er/sie/es hat
|-
!rowspan=&quot;3&quot;|plural!!1st person
|we have
|wir haben
|-
!2nd person
|you have
|ihr habt
|-
!3rd person
|they have 
|sie haben*
|}

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;This is also the form for ''you (polite)'' — ''Sie''.


{{German/Exercise|Verbs

1. heißen
*(ich) heiße
*(du/er/sie/es/ihr) heißt

==Test==

The test consists of three parts: grammar, vocabulary, and translation. The grammar part is about conjugation; i.e., different forms of verbs for different subject pronouns. The vocabulary and translation problems are all from English to German because this is what you have to learn if you want to communicate in German.

==&lt;font style=&quot;color: green;&quot;&gt;Accusative Case&lt;/font&gt;==

As you know from the [[../Introduction|introduction]], in German, there are four cases. Three are used often. The first, &lt;font style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;'''Nominative Case'''&lt;/font&gt;, you learned in [[../Wie heißt du?#Nominative Case|Lesson 1]]. It covers the [[w:Subject (grammar)|subject]], and the predicate noun (in &quot;He is (noun).&quot;, (noun) is the predicate noun). The second, the &lt;font style=&quot;color: green;&quot;&gt;'''Accusative Case'''&lt;/font&gt;, you will learn now. It covers the [[w:Direct object|direct object]] and the [[w:Preposition|object of several prepositions]]. The third, the &lt;font style=&quot;color: red&quot;&gt;'''Dative Case'''&lt;/font&gt; will be taught later on. It covers the [[w:Indirect object|indirect object]] and the object of many other prepositions. 

The object of a sentence will be in accusative case.  In, &quot;You hurt me.&quot;, 'me' would be accusative.

Note: The &lt;font style=&quot;color: green;&quot;&gt;'''Accusative Case'''&lt;/font&gt; and &lt;font style=&quot;color: red&quot;&gt;'''Dative Case'''&lt;/font&gt; are identical in English; that's why German has one case extra.

===Articles===

|- align=&quot;center&quot;
|
 || &lt;u&gt;Masculine&lt;/u&gt; || &lt;u&gt;Feminine&lt;/u&gt;

|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| Definite Article || '''den''' || die
| das || die
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| Indefinite Article || '''einen''' || eine
| ein || -eine*
|}
&lt;small&gt;'''* The indefinite article for plurals is non-existent. However related words, such as possessives and the kein- words that you will learn later this lesson, will end in ''eine'' for plurals.'''&lt;/small&gt;

In the articles, the memory hook for accusative case is &quot;Der goes to den (pronounced &quot;dane&quot; {{audio|De-den.ogg|audio}}) and the rest stays the same.&quot; The masculine indefinite article goes to ''einen'', and everything else stays the same there. Therefore above, ''der'' Hamburger goes to ''den'' Hamburger and ''ein'' Hamburger goes to ''einen'' Hamburger when the hamburger is the direct object, such as in &quot;Er hat einen Hamburger.&quot; (&quot;He has a hamburger.&quot;)

If you are getting confused, it's fine. This topic is one of the hardest for English speakers to grasp. Here are some solutions:

To find out the case of something, first find the verb. The verb rules the sentence. Everything revolves around it. Next you find the subject of the sentence. The subject is the thing/person that is ''doing'' the verb. '''The subject is always in the &lt;font style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Nominative Case&lt;/font&gt;, so it takes on the der, die, das, die, or ein, eine, ein.''' 

Now you look back at the verb. If it is a being verb (am, are, is, etc.), the next noun after the verb is the '''predicate noun'''. An easy way to figure this out is to write an equation. If the verb can be replaced with an equals sign (=), then the following noun is a predicate noun. If it can't be replaced by an equals sign, refer to the next paragraph. '''The predicate noun is also always in the &lt;font style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Nominative Case&lt;/font&gt;, so the same rules apply to it.

 &lt;font style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Ich&lt;/font&gt; bin &lt;font style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;'''ein''' Junge&lt;/font&gt;.
 &lt;font style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Sie&lt;/font&gt; ist &lt;font style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;'''eine''' Frau&lt;/font&gt;.

If the verb of the sentence is an action verb (playing, throwing, making, eating), find what the subject is doing the verb to. For example, if the verb is &quot;makes&quot; (macht), you look for what is being made. That is the direct object. '''The direct object is always in the &lt;font style=&quot;color: green;&quot;&gt;Accusative Case&lt;/font&gt;, so it takes on the den, die, das, die, or einen, eine, ein.'''

 &lt;font style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Sie&lt;/font&gt; haben &lt;font style=&quot;color: green;&quot;&gt;'''den''' Cheeseburger&lt;/font&gt;.
 Habt &lt;font style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;ihr&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font style=&quot;color: green;&quot;&gt;'''einen''' Salat&lt;/font&gt;?

The indefinite articles, when you just look at their endings, select e, -, e for nominative case, and en, e, -, e for accusative.

Remember, between nominative and accusative, the only third-person change is in the masculine form.

&lt;big&gt;[[/Problems#Articles|Section Problems]] &gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

===Pronouns===

The pronouns experience a much bigger change than the articles. This is also true in English, as the articles (a, an, the) do not change ever, but ''I'' goes to ''me'', ''we'' goes to ''us'', etc. 

Not everything is the same, though. While ''me'' is ''mich'' and ''us'' is ''uns'', the second and third persons undergo different changes. In third person, as in the articles, the only change is in masculine singular. Following the &quot;der goes to den&quot; rule, ''er'' goes to ''ihn'' when in the accusative case. 

The second person in English never changes. In German, ''du'' goes to ''dich'' and ''ihr'' goes to ''euch''. ''Sie'', the formal version of either, stays the same. Remember, ''Sie'' (2nd person formal) and ''sie'' (3rd person plural) only differ in their meanings and the fact that the former is capitalized and the latter is not. This stays true throughout German grammar.

Here is a tabular representation of the above.

{| border=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;background-color: #99FF99; width:50%;&quot;

|}
&lt;big&gt;[[/Problems#Pronouns|Section Problems]] &gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

===Antecedents===

Note: ''This is just a quick lesson in English grammar applied into German. If you already know all about antecedents in English, skip the first paragraph.''

When using a pronoun, you have to know what it is for it to work. There are some rare exceptions, such as in mysteries or drama, but otherwise this is always true. Sometimes in dialogue this is taken care of by pointing or making some other gesture, but most of the time, the pronoun modifies something already mentioned. '''The object/person mentioned earlier that turns into a pronoun later is called the antecedent.''' 

In German this is very useful. You can't simply say 'it' anymore. Many food words are masculine and feminine, and when you turn them into pronouns, they turn into 'he', 'she', 'him', and 'her', not always 'it'. For example, the sentence &quot;The cheeseburger tastes good. It's very crunchy.&quot; turns into &quot;The cheeseburger tastes good. ''He's'' very crunchy.&quot; Note: You will learn how to say this in German later in this lesson.

Why is it &quot;he&quot;? This is where the antecedent comes in. Because there are foods that are masculine and feminine in German, you can't assume the 'es'. You have to look back at the previous sentence, at the antecedent, ''der Cheeseburger''. &quot;Der Cheeseburger&quot; is replaced by ''er'' (since it is the subject, and therefore in Nominative Case). Therefore, all you need to know are these connections: der/den-er/ihn, die-sie, das-es, die-sie.

&lt;big&gt;[[/Problems#Antecedents|Section Problems]] &gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

==Food-Related Verbs==

* ''essen (I)''  - to eat, to be eating, to do eat
* ''trinken'' - to drink, to be drinking, to do drink
* ''bekommen'' - to get/receive, to be getting/receiving, to do get/receive
* ''möchten (M)'' - would like
* ''wollen (M)'' - to want, to be wanting, to do want

Of these five verbs, only trinken and bekommen are regular. Essen is ''irregular'' (that's what the &quot;I&quot; means). Do you remember from the last lesson 'lesen' and 'sehen'? In both of them, the first 'e' changed to 'ie' in the du- and er/sie/es-forms. Well ''essen'' experiences the same change, except that it changes to 'i', not 'ie'. Also, it acts the same as 'lesen' in the du-form: You don't have three s's in a row.

{| border=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;background-color: #FFFF66; width:50%&quot;
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| &lt;u&gt;Person&lt;/u&gt; || colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &lt;u&gt;Singular&lt;/u&gt;
|
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &lt;u&gt;Plural&lt;/u&gt;
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| '''1st''' || ich || ''esse'' ||
 || wir
| ''essen''
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| '''2nd''' || du || ''isst'' ||
 || ihr
| ''esst''
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| '''3rd''' || er/sie/es || ''isst''
|
 || sie || ''essen''
|}


''Isst'' sounds and looks a lot like ''ist''. The minute difference happens to be in the way you pronounce the ''s''. When you mean ''eats'' it is sometimes an overstressed hissing (i.e. extremely sharp) sound. In normal life Germans, too, can only tell which verb is meant from knowing the context. 

Just like in last lesson, where you could say, ''&quot;Ich spiele gerne Fußball.&quot;'', you can also extend it to food. &quot;I like to eat cheeseburgers.&quot; is translated as ''&quot;Ich esse gerne Cheeseburger.&quot; 

Before [[w:German spelling reform of 1996|1996]], the usage of ''ißt'' and ''eßt'' were common, but the new reform rules specify that these spellings are now the only correct spellings.

The last two verbs (marked ''(M)'') are ''modals''. They will be discussed in the next section.

&lt;big&gt;[[/Problems#Food-Related Verbs|Section Problems]] &gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

==Modals==

In [[../Introduction|the introduction]], you learned that German has no helping verbs. Instead, they have '''modals''', words that basically do the same thing.

Modals are conjugated very differently from normal verbs. The ich- and er/sie/es-forms are always the same, while the du-form adds an 'st'. Most modals experience a vowel change from singular to plural, and the rest is the same.

===Möchten===

'Möchten' isn't technically a modal, but it acts exactly the same. There is no vowel change, and the ich- and er/sie/es forms are &quot;möchte&quot;. Here is the complete conjugation:


{| border=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;background-color: #FFFF66; width:50%&quot;
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| &lt;u&gt;Person&lt;/u&gt; || colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &lt;u&gt;Singular&lt;/u&gt;
|
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &lt;u&gt;Plural&lt;/u&gt;
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| '''1st''' || ich || ''möchte'' ||
 || wir
| ''möchten''
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| '''2nd''' || du || ''möchtest'' ||
 || ihr
| ''möchtet''
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| '''3rd''' || er/sie/es || ''möchte''
|
 || sie || ''möchten''
|}

'Möchten' means &quot;would like&quot; and can be applied to food (i.e. Ich möchte einen Cheeseburger.). Möchten can be translated even more literally as &quot;would like to&quot;, and is traditionally used with an infinitive verb at the end of the sentence (i.e. &quot;Ich möchte jetzt gehen&quot;/&quot;I would like to go now&quot;). However, this infinitive is not neccesary if it's completely obvious what you're talking about (If you say &quot;Ich möchte einen Cheeseburger&quot;, everyone will assume that you would like a cheeseburger to eat.)

(Note: ''Technically, &quot;möchten&quot; is not a word. The above cited conjugation is actually the &quot;Konjunktiv&quot; of &quot;mögen&quot;, which has become so popular as a phrase, that even many Germans today aren't aware of it anymore, so you don't need to worry about it. &quot;Etwas mögen&quot; means &quot;to like to&quot;, and &quot;I would like&quot; is the closest translation of &quot;ich möchte.&quot;'')

===Wollen===

'Wollen' is a true modal; it even changes vowels. Ich/er/sie/es ''will'' and du ''willst''. Here is the complete conjugation:


{| border=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;background-color: #FFFF66; width:50%&quot;
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| &lt;u&gt;Person&lt;/u&gt; || colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &lt;u&gt;Singular&lt;/u&gt;
|
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &lt;u&gt;Plural&lt;/u&gt;
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| '''1st''' || ich || ''will'' ||
 || wir
| ''wollen''
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| '''2nd''' || du || ''willst'' ||
 || ihr
| ''wollt''
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| '''3rd''' || er/sie/es || ''will'' ||
 || sie
| ''wollen''
|}

'Wollen' can also be applied to food, but may be considered impolite and demanding (&quot;Ich will einen Cheeseburger!&quot; roughly means &quot;I demand a cheeseburger!&quot; ''Möchten'' should be used instead: &quot;Ich möchte einen Cheeseburger!&quot; = &quot;I want a cheeseburger!&quot;).

'Wollen' should not be confused with the future tense, despite the presence of the English word 'will' in the conjugations. However, [[Wiktionary:will|will]] can also mean an intent or a document showing what one ''wants'' to happen. So it is not so different from 'to want' as possibly originally presumed.

===Modals with other verbs===

'''This is very important.''' When you need to use another verb with a modal (such as expressing you would like or want to perform an action), the sentence's word order is somewhat different than it would be in English. In English, you would state the subject pronoun (such as &quot;I&quot;), an English equivalent to the modal verb (such as &quot;want&quot;), the action you want to perform (such as &quot;to eat&quot;) and then what the action will be performed on (such as &quot;hamburger&quot;), making the sentence &quot;I want to eat a hamburger.&quot; In German you must put the action at the end of the sentence, making the sentence &quot;I want a hamburger to eat.&quot; (''&quot;Ich will einen Hamburger essen.&quot;'')

&lt;big&gt;[[/Problems#Modals|Section Problems]] &gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

==Hunger and Thirst==

In German, instead of saying, &quot;I'm hungry.&quot;, you say &quot;I have hunger.&quot; The same applies to thirst. Here are the German translations of the corresponding nouns:

Hunger - der Hunger

Thirst - der Durst

Like in English, these two words do not have a plural form. When using them, you don't need to worry about the 'der'; you can just say, &quot;Ich habe Hunger.&quot; to say &quot;I am hungry.&quot;

&lt;big&gt;[[/Problems#Hunger and Thirst|Section Problems]] &gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

==Formal Conversations==

In [[../Wie heißt du?|Lesson 1]], you learned how to talk formally, using phrases like &quot;Guten Morgen!&quot; and &quot;Wie heißen Sie?&quot;. There are, however, a few words that are 'survival words' in Germany, specifically:

'''Danke''' - Thank you, Thanks

'''Bitte''' - Please ''and'' You're welcome.

To make this even more formal, you can tack on the word 'schön' to the end of &quot;Thank you&quot; and &quot;You're welcome&quot; to make 'dankeschön' and 'bitteschön' (both one word) in response. 'Schön' literally means 'pretty' (you'll relearn this next lesson). 

'''Some other ways to say &quot;thank you&quot;:'''
* Dankeschön - Thank you very much
* Danke sehr - Thanks a lot
* Herzlichen Dank (&quot;herzlichen&quot; means sincere or from the heart; you may remember it from &quot;&lt;u&gt;Herzlichen&lt;/u&gt; Glückwunsch zum Geburtstag!&quot; last lesson)
* Vielen Dank - Thanks a lot
* Tausend Dank* - Thanks a million (literally meaning a thousand, but English is more generous)
* Aufrichtigen Dank* - would be &quot;thank you sincerely&quot; (''very'' formal)

&lt;small&gt;* - You will not be tested on these phrases.&lt;/small&gt;

'''Some other ways to say &quot;You are welcome&quot;:'''

* Bitteschön!
* Bitte sehr!
* Gern geschehen! - Don't mention it
* Gerne! - also meaning &quot;gladly&quot;
* Kein Problem! - No problem
* Dafür nicht!* - (Do) not (thank me) for this (only used in Northern Germany)

&lt;small&gt;* - You will not be tested on this phrase.&lt;/small&gt;

These might also be useful:

'''Entschuldigung''' - Excuse me, Pardon

'''Es tut mir leid''' - Sorry, I'm sorry

&lt;big&gt;[[/Problems#Formal Conversations|Section Problems]] &gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

==Kein-words==

Twice you have been taught that the ending of the indefinite article for plurals ''would be'' eine (for Nominative and Accusative cases), if there was an indefinite article for plurals. Now that lesson applies. The '''k'''ein-words have the same endings as the ein-words, and they mean the opposite: no, not any, none. For example, &quot;kein Cheeseburger&quot; means &quot;no cheeseburger&quot;. &quot;Keine Cheeseburger&quot; (in this case Cheeseburger is plural) means &quot;No cheeseburger'''s'''&quot;. Notice the 'e' at the end of 'keine'. That's the ending for plurals and feminine nouns and can be likened to the &quot;der, die, das -&gt; die&quot; relationship, where the feminine article serves for the plural as well.

&lt;big&gt;[[/Problems#Kein-words|Section Problems]] &gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

==Ordering at a Restaurant in Germany==

das Restaur'ant' (French pronunciation)&lt;!--Gaststätte is older German and somewhat &quot;deprecated&quot;--&gt; - Restaurant {{Audio|Fr-Restaurant.ogg}}

There are many restaurants you might find in Germany. Much like in English-speaking countries, you would more likely use the name of the restaurant than name what kind of restaurant. If you want to address the wish to eat a certain food, there are two ways:

example: &quot;wanting to eat chinese food&quot;

1. &quot;Ich möchte gerne zum Chinesen.&quot; - literally: &quot;I want to go to the Chinese (restaurant).&quot;
2. &quot;Ich möchte gerne chinesisch essen (gehen).&quot; - literally: &quot;I want to (go) eat Chinese (style food).&quot;

Here are some more restaurants you can find in Germany:

* American food: &quot;zum Amerikaner&quot; / &quot;amerikanisch essen&quot;*
* Arabic food: &quot;zum Araber&quot; / &quot;arabisch essen&quot;
* Chinese food: &quot;zum Chinesen&quot; / &quot;chinesisch essen&quot;
* French food: &quot;zum Franzosen&quot; / &quot;französisch essen&quot;
* Greek food: &quot;zum Griechen&quot; / &quot;griechisch essen&quot;
* Italian food: &quot;zum Italiener&quot; / &quot;italienisch essen&quot;
* Indian food: &quot;zum Inder&quot; / &quot;indisch essen&quot;
* Japanese food: &quot;zum Japaner&quot; / &quot;japanisch essen&quot;
* Mexican food: &quot;zum Mexikaner&quot; / &quot;mexikanisch essen&quot;
* Spanish food: &quot;zum Spanier&quot; / &quot;spanisch essen&quot;
* Turkish food: &quot;zum Türken&quot; / &quot;türkisch essen&quot;
&lt;small&gt;* &quot;zum Amerikaner&quot; is often used in a jokey way, to express that one is going to either McDonald's or Burger King. There are few American restaurants, in Germany and they are mostly referred to as &quot;(American) Diner&quot;, so it is not used like &quot;zum Italiener&quot;.&lt;/small&gt;

==Accusative case prepositions==
You read at the beginning of this lesson that the &lt;font style=&quot;color: green;&quot;&gt;'''Accusative Case'''&lt;/font&gt; covers the direct object and the objects of some prepositions. Here are those prepositions that always fall under Accusative Case

''bis'' - until

''durch'' - through

''entlang'' - along

''für'' - for

''gegen'' - against

''ohne'' - without

''um'' - at, around

You learned ''um'' last lesson, and ''ohne'' earlier this lesson. ''Bis'', ''durch'', ''entlang'' and ''gegen'' will be taught in depth later, and ''für'' will be taught now. 

Up until this point, you have only worried about the Accusative Case in third person. ''Für'', meaning 'for', can and should be used in the first and second persons, too. Here's an example:

&quot;The cheeseburger is for me.&quot; - &quot;Der Cheeseburger ist ''für mich''.&quot;

As you can see, 'me' is put into accusative case because the preposition is ''für''.

&lt;big&gt;[[/Problems#Accusative case preparations|Section Problems]] &gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

==Saying How Food Tastes==

In German (as in English) there are several ways of telling how food tastes. You can do this with 'gut' and 'schlecht' from [[../Wie heißt du?|Lesson 1]] to say:

'''Der Cheeseburger schmeckt gut - The cheeseburger tastes good'''  

'''Der Cheeseburger schmeckt schlecht - The cheeseburger tastes bad'''

But this is bland. Hopefully the food has more flavor than the description of it. You can use the following words to more colorfully describe how the cheeseburger tastes:

* delicious - ''lecker''

* delicious - ''delikat''* (a lot more formal than lecker)

* tasty - ''schmackhaft''

* juicy - ''saftig''*

* crunchy - ''knackig'' (can also mean ''crispy'')

* crispy - ''knusprig''*

* spicy - ''würzig'', ''pikant''

* stale, tasteless - ''fade''* (Austria: fad) 

* salty - ''salzig''

* oversalted - ''versalzen''*

* sweet - ''süß''

* bitter - ''bitter''

* sour - ''sauer''

* creamy - ''cremig''*

* hot (in the sense of &quot;very spicy&quot;) - ''scharf'' - literally meaning &quot;sharp&quot;

* hot (in the sense of &quot;very warm&quot;) - ''heiß''

* burnt - ''angebrannt''*

* cold - ''kalt''

* disgusting, terrible - ''schrecklich''

&lt;small&gt;* - You will not be tested on these descriptors.&lt;/small&gt;

'''Schmecken''' is a regular verb. Here is it's conjugation:

| '''1st''' || ich || ''schmecke'' ||

| ''schmecken''
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| '''2nd''' || du || ''schmeckst'' ||

The first and second persons really shouldn't be used. No one is going to say, &quot;You guys taste salty&quot; or &quot;I taste creamy.&quot; So the only forms you ''really'' need to know are er/sie/es ''schmeckt'' and sie (plural) ''schmecken''.

You can use 'schmeckt' and 'schmecken' or 'ist' and 'sind' to state how the food tastes. Just use whichever one you would use in English and it'll usually be correct.

Although the English meaning of ''schmecken'' is simply ''to taste'', ''&quot;Schmeckt der Cheeseburger?&quot;'' can be taken in a positive way to mean &quot;Do you like the cheeseburger?&quot;. In other words, ''schmecken'' alone can mean ''to taste good''.

&lt;big&gt;[[/Problems#Saying How Food Tastes|Section Problems]] &gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

==Dieser-forms==

&quot;''The'' cheeseburger tastes good.&quot; does not sound that specific as to which cheeseburger you are talking about. You could be talking about a cheeseburger that is not directly in front of you. It just isn't clear. Now, if you said, &quot;''This'' cheeseburger tastes good.&quot;, it would be obvious that you're talking about the cheeseburger you're eating. 'Dieser' is the German translation for 'this': &quot;Dieser Cheeseburger schmeckt gut.&quot;

===Dieser===

'Dieser' is a special adjective. It changes forms in different situations: different genders and different cases. It can also mean 'these' when modifying a plural. Here are its forms:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;background-color: #99FF99; width:50%&quot;
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
|
 || &lt;u&gt;Masculine&lt;/u&gt; || &lt;u&gt;Feminine&lt;/u&gt;
| &lt;u&gt;Neuter&lt;/u&gt; || &lt;u&gt;Plural&lt;/u&gt;
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| Nominative Case || dies'''er''' || dies'''e'''
| dies'''es''' || dies'''e'''
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| Accusative Case || dies'''en''' || dies'''e'''
| dies'''es''' || dies'''e'''
|}

As you can see, ''dieser'' is only appropriate for modifying masculine nouns in nominative case. But 'Cheeseburger', which is masculine, is the subject of the sentence, &quot;Dieser Cheeseburger schmeckt gut.&quot; So it is correct in that circumstance.

===Jeder===

''Jeder'' means 'every'. It acts exactly like 'dieser' in its endings, so it should be easy to remember. Here are the different forms:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;background-color: #99FF99; width:50%&quot;
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
|
 || &lt;u&gt;Masculine&lt;/u&gt; || &lt;u&gt;Feminine&lt;/u&gt;
| &lt;u&gt;Neuter&lt;/u&gt;
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| Nominative Case || jed'''er''' || jed'''e'''
| jed'''es'''
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| Accusative Case || jed'''en''' || jed'''e'''
| jed'''es'''
|}

Notice the absence of the plural form. When you think about this, it's the same in English: no one says 'every books'.

===Welcher===

'Welcher' is the third of this threesome of adjectives. 'Welcher' means 'which' and is used like the other [w:Interrogative word|interrogatives] (wer, was, wann, wo, warum, wie, and welcher). However, because the general subject has to be specified, ''welcher'' must be inflected before use: &quot;Welcher Hamburger ist seine?&quot;  Its forms have the same endings as 'dieser'.

{| border=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;background-color: #99FF99; width:50%&quot;
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
|
 || &lt;u&gt;Masculine&lt;/u&gt; || &lt;u&gt;Feminine&lt;/u&gt;
| &lt;u&gt;Neuter&lt;/u&gt; || &lt;u&gt;Plural&lt;/u&gt;
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| Nominative Case || welch'''er''' || welch'''e'''
| welch'''es''' || welch'''e'''
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| Accusative Case || welch'''en''' || welch'''e'''
| welch'''es''' || welch'''e'''
|}

===Connection with Time===

You might want to say 'every day', 'this week', 'every morning', or 'which Tuesday night?'. But to do this, not only do you need to know the jeder-forms, but also the genders of the times and the cases. The second one is easy: '''Whenever you do something at a certain time, that time is put into &lt;font style=&quot;color: green;&quot;&gt;Accusative Case&lt;/font&gt;.''' Last lesson, you learned the gender of one time: ''der'' Tag. So now you know everything to say 'diesen Tag', 'jeden Tag', and 'welchen Tag?' (this day, every day, and which day?). Here are the cases of all the times in [[../Freizeit|Lesson 2]]:


{| border=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;width:50%&quot;
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| &lt;u&gt;Masculine&lt;/u&gt; || &lt;u&gt;Feminine&lt;/u&gt; || &lt;u&gt;Neuter&lt;/u&gt;
|- valign=&quot;top&quot;
|
* Tag
* Monat
* Morgen
* Abend
* Nachmittag
|
* Woche
* Nacht
|
* Jahr
* Wochenende
|}

When extending to 'which Tuesday night?', remember that the night stays feminine on Tuesday, so it stays &quot;Welche Dienstagnacht?&quot;. Likewise, you can say 'every June' the same as 'every month': 'jeden Juni'.

===This and That===

''Ich möchte einen Cheeseburger. Der schmeckt sehr gut.''

''Ich esse jeden Tag Cheeseburger. Die habe ich gern.''

Look at the second sentence of each of these German dialogues. What's missing? That's right, instead of &quot;Der Cheeseburger schmeckt sehr gut.&quot; and &quot;Die Cheeseburger habe ich gern.&quot;, both of the 'Cheeseburger's, so to speak, are dropped. We're left with just the articles, only in this case, they aren't articles. They're '''demonstrative pronouns'''.

Demonstrative pronouns aren't scary. They're just the same as the normal pronouns, only they give more ''oomph'' to the sentence. They can be translated as either 'this' or 'that' (&quot;I'd like a cheeseburger. That tastes very good.&quot;), or 'these' or 'those' for plurals (&quot;I eat cheeseburgers every day. These I like.&quot;).

Demonstrative pronouns are exactly the same as the definite articles (well, there is one change in dative, but that will be covered in [[../Das Fest|Lesson 7]]). If you are not sure of the gender (meaning in context, the speaker doesn't know, not that you've forgotten that it's 'der Cheeseburger'), use 'das', like in &quot;Was ist das?&quot; (What is that?).

==Money and Paying==



Germany, Austria, Luxemburg, Belgium and Südtirol – in other words: all German speaking regions except Switzerland and Liechtenstein– have given up their former currencies and adopted the Euro as of 1999. One ''Euro'' is worth 100 ''Cents''. Because they are not members of the European Union, Switzerland and Liechtenstein have kept the Swiss Francs (''Franken'' = 100 ''Rappen''). 

'Euro' normally does not change in the plural in German, so you would still say &quot;Ich habe 500 Euro.&quot; Nevertheless, there is an exception: Euro ''coins''. If you say &quot;Ich habe vier Euros.&quot;, you actually are saying that you have four 1-Euro coins. Because the backsides of euro coins look different in each country, many people in Europe have started collecting foreign euro coins. In this case you can say &quot;Ich habe irische Euros.&quot; (I have Irish euro coins.) for example.

There is not yet a rule whether or not the word ''&quot;Cent&quot;'' has a different plural form. The majority of Germans are using the word ''&quot;Cent&quot;'' as a plural form, but when they don't it is simply ''&quot;Cents&quot;''.

In German &quot;euro&quot; is pronounced [‘oi-ro], not [you-ro]. For &quot;Cent&quot; there are two pronunciations: you can either pronounce it as in English or you say &quot;tzent&quot;. The latter version seems to be preferred by older people.

When at a restaurant, you will want to pay at the end. You can use this vocabulary to help you.

* to pay - ''zahlen''

* the bill - ''die Rechnung''*

* the waiter - ''der Kellner'', ''die Bedienung (also ''der Ober'')**

* the waitress - ''die Kellnerin'' (but '''not''' ''die Oberin'' because this means ''Reverend Mother'')

* &quot;How much is that?&quot; - ''&quot;Was macht das?&quot;'' (&quot;What does that make?&quot;) or the &quot;umgangssprachliche&quot; ''&quot;Wie viel kostet das?&quot;''

&lt;small&gt; * To ask for the bill you can say, &quot;Bitte zahlen!&quot;, or make it a complete sentence: &quot;Ich würde gern zahlen!&quot;, or &quot;Wir möchten/wollen zahlen!&quot;. You can also say, &quot;(Herr Ober), die Rechnung bitte!&quot;. The term &quot;der Ober&quot; is the waiter, but this sounds very old fashioned and is hardly ever used today. To address the waiter you would probably say &quot;Entschuldigen Sie, ...&quot; (&quot;Pardon, ...&quot;) like in &quot;Entschuldigen Sie, wir würden gern zahlen&quot; (Pardon me, we would like to pay&quot;).&lt;/small&gt; 

&lt;small&gt; ** Although it is perfectly OK to say “Bedienung” or “Kellner” when talking about a waiter or a waitress, you should not address the waiter by saying &quot;Bedienung!&quot; or even “Fräulein!” which is regarded very impolite since the 1980s. &lt;/small&gt;

&lt;big&gt;[[/Problems#Dieser-forms|Section Problems]] &gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Graphing points is as simple as counting. First, a grid is needed which we will call a '''graph'''. A set of given '''coordinates''' are needed to plot a point which can be called '''ordered pairs'''. Ordered pairs follow this format: (x, y). The first number represents where at the point lies in the x-direction.  The second number represents where at the point lies in the y-direction, or how many units the point lies from the origin. For example, the coordinates (2, 3) tell you to move 2 units to the right on the x-axis, and 3 units up on the y-axis, then draw a point. For instance, if the coordinates given were (-5, 0) you would draw a point that is 5 units left of the origin (which is (0, 0)) and the point wouldn't go up or down because the second coordinate is 0. These points are often labeled as letters such as A, B, or C.

The word ''Kammmuschel'' is far from being a common German word. I'm quite sure that nobody will understand you if you order a ''Kammmuschel'' in a German restaurant. You might better just teach the word ''Muschel'' instead. [[Special:Contributions/85.179.37.72|85.179.37.72]] ([[User talk:85.179.37.72|discuss]]) 22:11, 6 February 2011 (UTC)</text>

== Дарсан хIума (Lesson Material) ==
In these lessons, we will learn the Chechen words for family members and also how to introduce them. We will also be able to express where we live and ask someone where he or she lives.

=== Доьзал (Family) ===
[[File:Family icon.png|left]] In Chechnya, like in most places in the world, family is an important aspect to daily life. Chechens are very close to their families. They might also be very curious about your family and background, especially if you are trying out your Chechen skills on them. Let's take a look at some vocabulary relating to family and friends.

We can see that forming family words can be actually quite simple in Chechen. Chechen is a literal and logical language, meaning to say &quot;grandfather&quot;, we can just say &quot;my mother's father&quot;. Try to see if you can find a pattern with the words given below.
[[Image:Muslim family of amdo note tibetan style hats.jpg|right|300px]]
'''доьзал''' - family &lt;/br&gt;
'''адам''' - person &lt;/br&gt;
'''жима бер''' - baby &lt;/br&gt;
'''неца''' - aunt(sister of mother) &lt;/br&gt;
'''дд''' - ??? &lt;/br&gt;
'''ваша''' - brother &lt;/br&gt;
'''йиша''' - sister &lt;/br&gt;
'''кIант''' - son&lt;/br&gt;
'''йоI''' - daughter &lt;/br&gt;
'''да''' - father &lt;/br&gt;
'''до''' -??? &lt;/br&gt;
'''шича''' - cousin &lt;/br&gt;
'''доттагI''' - friend &lt;/br&gt;
'''майра''' - husband &lt;/br&gt;
'''зуда''' - wife &lt;/br&gt;
'''дада''' - grandfather (father's father) &lt;/br&gt;
'''ненан да''' - grandfather (mother's father) &lt;/br&gt;
'''де нана''' - grandmother (father's mother) &lt;/br&gt;
'''ненан нана''' - grandmother (mother's mother) &lt;/br&gt;



[[Image:Coyote-cartoon-L.jpg|left|50px]] ''Vocabulary lists'' are available for '''[[Chechen/Vocabulary/Family|Family]]''' related words! If you wish to expand your Chechen vocabulary, check out the extensive list of related words.

=== Довзар (Meeting) ===
Try out some phrases below with what you learned above!

'''&lt;big&gt;Иза мила ву?&lt;/big&gt;''' - ''Who is he?'' &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; '''&lt;big&gt;Иза сан ваша ву.&lt;/big&gt;''' - ''He is my brother'' &lt;/br&gt;

'''&lt;big&gt;Иза мила ю?&lt;/big&gt;''' - ''Who is she?'' &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; '''&lt;big&gt;Иза сан йиша ю.&lt;/big&gt;''' - ''She is my sister'' &lt;/br&gt;

'''&lt;big&gt;Уьш муьлш бу?&lt;/big&gt;''' - ''Who are they?'' &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; '''&lt;big&gt;Уьш сан да-нана бу.&lt;/big&gt;''' - ''They are my parents'' &lt;/br&gt;

'''&lt;big&gt;Иза мила ву?&lt;/big&gt;''' - ''Who is he?'' &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; '''&lt;big&gt;Суна иза ца воьвза&lt;/big&gt;''' - ''I don't know him'' &lt;/br&gt;

'''&lt;big&gt;А иза мила ю?&lt;/big&gt;''' - ''And who is she?'' &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; '''&lt;big&gt;Суна иза ца йоьвза&lt;/big&gt;''' - ''I don't know her'' &lt;/br&gt;


'''&lt;big&gt;Хьо мичахь Iаш ву/ю?&lt;/big&gt;''' - ''Where do you live?'' &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; '''&lt;big&gt;Со Соьлжа-гIалахь Iаш ву/ю&lt;/big&gt;''' - ''I live in Grozny'' &lt;/br&gt;

'''&lt;big&gt;Иза мичахь Iаш ю?&lt;/big&gt;''' - ''Where does she live?'' &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; '''&lt;big&gt;Иза да-нана долчохь Iаш ю&lt;/big&gt;''' - ''She lives with her parents'' &lt;/br&gt;


'''&lt;big&gt;Хьан ваша мичахь Iаш ву?&lt;/big&gt;''' - ''Where does your brother live?'' &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; '''&lt;big&gt;Сан ваша Москвахь Iаш ву&lt;/big&gt;''' - ''My brother lives in Moscow'' &lt;/br&gt;

== Грамматика (Grammar) ==
In regards to Chechen grammar in this lesson, we are going to learn about grammatical cases and expand a bit more on the pronouns we learned in the last lesson. This all ties together, since we will be learning the ''genitive case endings'' for the personal pronouns. If you don't know what that means, you will in a few seconds!

=== Артикль (The Article) ===
Real quick, have you noticed something odd about the Chechen language yet? Let me ask you a question, how do you say 'the' or 'a'? Well, you can't! Like [[Russian]], [[Chinese]], and [[Finnish]], as well as many other languages, Chechen doesn't have any indefinite nor definite articles. Therefore, '''ваша''' can mean: ''a brother, the brother'' or just ''brother''. Don't worry, you will figure out where the articles are needed in translation with the context and enough practice. 

=== Дожараш (Cases) ===
In plain English, well...we don't really have cases in modern day English. This might be a bit difficult to explain if you are not already familiar with other languages. I am sure you have heard of the subject and object. Cases define what function the noun has in the sentence and changes the word accordingly. In Chechen, there are 8 cases, meaning, 8 different ways a word can change its form by adding or changing letters at the end of the word. 

The first case, '''ЦIерниг дожар''', or the [[:w:Nominative case|nominative case]], is the easiest case to learn. Words in the nominative case are in its original dictionary form and act as the subject of the clause in the sentence. Just remember, ''normal'' sounds like ''nominative'', and this is the case where the word is &quot;normal&quot;, if that helps you remember it.

We don't need to spend a lot of time on the nominative case, so we can talk about the second case briefly, which is '''Доланиг дожар''', or the [[:w:Genitive case|genitive case]]. The genitive case represents ownership, similar to our English &quot;mine, yours, his&quot; from &quot;I, you, he&quot;. Think of &quot;genetics&quot; to remember the genetive case. In Chechen, the genetive is actually pretty simple to put together. Just add '''н''' to the end of the word. If the word ends in a vowel, then add '''ан''' or '''ин'''. So for example:

'''ГIала''' - the city, '''ГIалан нах''' - the people of the city, the city's people

We will talk more about the genitive later, as there are some exceptions, like '''и''' can be added instead of '''а''', but we'll talk about it later. Just understand ''what'' the genitive is at first.

The final case we will talk about today is the [[:w:Substantive case|substantive case]], Хотталург дожар. This case is a locative case in Chechen as it describes &quot;where&quot; something is located. Think of it as the English, ''in'' or ''at''. Chechen uses this case to add an ending, '''ахь, ехь, ах, ех''' at the end of the word. So:

'''ГIала''' - the city, '''ГIалахь''' - in the city
'''Мотт''' - a language '''Маттахь''' - in a language

As I said, there are some exceptions, but down the road, you will pick up on how words and vowels change in Chechen. For now, just remember what you learned:

&lt;center&gt;

|-

|-
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

=== ЦIерметдешнаш (Pronouns) ===
Let's look at pronouns a bit more. Last time we learned ''I, you, he, she, it'' and this time we will learn the genitive pronouns, ''my, your, his, her, its''. Just like what you just read about the genitive case, the pronouns will take the ending '''н'''.

{|style=&quot;font-size:95%;&quot;

|-
|}

Therefore: '''сан ваша''' - my brother, '''иза сан ваша ву''' - he is my brother, '''иза хьан ваша а ву''' - he is also your brother

[[Image:Rus-Chechnya-district.png|right|thumb|Сурт Нохчийчоьн районийн карта оьрсийн маттахь]]
Chechnya is a small country buried in the mountains of the Northern Caucasus. It shares borders with Dagestan to the east, Georgia to the south, Ingushetia and North Ossetia to the west, and Russia to the north. Azerbaijan is very close to Chechnya as well. There are many mountains in the southern part close to the Georgian border, which are simply called the [[:w:Caucasus mountains|Caucasus Mountain Range]]. 

The capital of Chechnya is [[:w:Grozny|Grozny]], or '''Соьлжа-гIала''' (Solzh ghala). Grozny is located right in the center of Chechnya. Other major cities in Chechnya are Guderemes ('''Гудермес'''), Shali ('''Шали'''), Vedeno ('''Ведено'''), Argun ('''Устрада-гIала'''), and Urus Martan ('''Хьалхара-Марта'''). Major resources in Chechnya consist of zinc, oil, natural gas, and uranium, making it an essential area in the region.

There are three major rivers that run through the Chechen territory, [[:w:Terek River|the Terek]], [[:w:Sunzha River|Sunzha]], and [[:w:Argun River (Caucasus)|Argun]] rivers. There are no seaports since Chechnya is a landlocked country, but there are highways, railroads, bus routes, and an international airport in Grozny.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi,

I would appreciate if you wouldn't remove my contributions to the article on Language Learning difficulty for English Speakers just because you personally don't agree even though I gave a reference. It's true that noone becomes fluent in Esperanto in 150 hours.. Nobody becomes fluent in any of the languages in the times listed on that page. Those estimates were really just for how long it would take to have a good feel for the language and 'basic proficiency' (that being, the ability to navigate the language with the use of a dictionary). If you see the link I posted, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto#Education, you will clearly see that it says:

2000 hours studying German =
1500 hours studying English =
1000 hours studying Italian =
150 hours studying Esperanto.

On the Wikibooks page, it says students need 750-900 class hours for basic proficiency in German. Presumably they would also then do some private study and also make use of German from time to time, so I figured that 150 hours of Esperanto = 750-900 hours of German class time as was listed on the page. 

I was only trying to offer some insight. Learning Esperanto helped me to on my quest to learn other languages and it is a well-known technique among polyglots. For example: http://www.fluentin3months.com/2-weeks-of-esperanto/ (I would think that 2 weeks is not long enough for most people, but after all, that particular author was already a master polyglot).

I will add this to the discussion page and undo your revert. If you still think my contribution was out of place, you can respond on the discussion page. [[User:Kajaeo|Kajaeo]] ([[User talk:Kajaeo|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kajaeo|contribs]]) 03:01, 7 February 2011 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Diagonals.svg|thumb|A convex set; no line can be drawn connecting two points that does not remain completely inside the set]]

A '''convex set''' is a set of points such that, given any two points A, B in that set, the line AB joining them lies entirely within that set.

Intuitively, this means that the set is connected (so that you can pass between any two points without leaving the set) and has no dents in its perimeter.  Sections of the perimeter may be straight lines.

== Notes ==
# It is assumed that the concept of a line joining two points is defined.  In a vector space over the reals, it is the set {&amp;lambda;A+(1-&amp;lambda;)B}, 0 &lt; &amp;lambda; &lt; 1}.  It will be assumed that we are dealing with vector spaces over the reals unless the contrary is stated explicitly.
# By convention, the empty set and all sets consisting of a single point are regarded as convex.  Since we cannot find two distinct points in such sets, we cannot say that the line joining two such points isn't contained in the set.

== Theorem ==
If X is a convex set and x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ... x&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; are any points in it, then

&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle x = \sum_{i=1}^k \lambda_i x_i&lt;/math&gt; where all &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \lambda_i &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^k \lambda_i=1&lt;/math&gt;

is also in X.

'''Proof:''' If k=2, the theorem is true by the definition of a convex set.

Now proceed by induction.  Assume the theorem is true for k=m.  If k=m+1, we can formulate the definition of x as a linear combination of two points, one of which is itself a linear combination of the first m points and the other is the (m+1)th point.  By the induction hypothesis, the first point must be in X; therefore, from the definition, s is in X.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Theorem:''' Given any collection of convex sets (finite, countable or uncountable), their intersection is itself a convex set.

'''Proof:''' If the intersection is empty, or consists of a single point, the theorem is true by definition.

Otherwise, take any two points A, B in the intersection.  The line AB joining these points must also lie wholly within each set in the collection, hence must lie wholly within their intersection.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Example 1 ==
In a two-dimensional vector space, a '''parallelogram''' is a set such that in some suitably chosen basis '''x''', '''y''' of the space, the set consists of the points a'''x''' + b'''y''' with 0 &lt; a &lt; 1, 0 &lt; b &lt; 1.

All parallelograms are convex.  For, given any two points A, B in the parallelogram, we have

:A = a'''x''' + b'''y'''
:B = c'''x''' + d'''y'''

with all coefficients being between 0 and 1.  An arbitrary point on the line AB is

:C = (&amp;lambda;a+(1-&amp;lambda;)c)'''x''' + (&amp;lambda;b+(1-&amp;lambda;)d)'''y'''

with 0 &lt; &amp;lambda; &lt; 1.  These coefficients are also between 0 and 1, so C is also in the parallelogram.

== Example 2 ==
In Euclidean space, a '''ball''', centre O radius r is the set of points within distance r of O, i.e. it is the interior of a sphere or hypersphere.  (In two dimensions, a ball is often called a '''disc'''.)

All balls are conves.  For, given any two points A, B in the ball, we have their distances from O less than r.  For an arbitrary point C on AB,  C = &amp;lambda;A+(1-&amp;lambda;)B so

: dist(O,C) &lt;  &amp;lambda;dist(O,A) + (1-&amp;lambda;)dist(O,B) &lt; r.

Hence C is also in the ball.

      <comment>/* Using &quot;do shell script&quot; */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">AppleScript can interact with UNIX shell scripts in a couple of ways.  AppleScript can call UNIX shell scripts and utilities using the &quot;do shell script&quot; command.  UNIX shell scripts can call the &quot;osascript&quot; utility to execute AppleScript code.

== Using the &quot;do shell script&quot; command==

To run shell commands from Applescript:

&lt;source lang=&quot;applescript&quot;&gt;do shell script &quot;afplay /System/Library/Sounds/Glass.aiff&quot;&lt;/source&gt;

The user would hear a sound.

{{BookCat}}

== Using &quot;osascript&quot; ==

The osascript utility allows shell scripts to execute Applescript code.  For example, the following command in a shell script or at a prompt, will open a Mac OS X dialog box and wait for the user to respond:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;osascript -e 'tell app &quot;System Events&quot; to activate' -e 'tell app &quot;System Events&quot; to display dialog &quot;Hello, world!&quot;'&lt;/source&gt;

The user would see:

      <text xml:space="preserve">Main figures in Italian Renaissance comedy are Ruzante (Angelo Beolco, 1502-1542) and Niccolo Machiavelli (1469-1527). Ruzante wrote &quot;La Fiorina&quot; (Fiorina, 1531) and &quot;La Piovana&quot; (Rainwater, 1532) and Machiavelli &quot;Mandragola&quot; (The mandrake, 1518).

&quot;Fiorina&quot;. Time: 1530s. Place: Italy.

&quot;Rainwater&quot;. Time: 1530s. Place: Italy.

&quot;The mandrake&quot;. Time: 1510s. Place: Florence, Italy.

Callimacus has an eye on Nicia's wife. He pretends to be a doctor with a potion containing mandrake, a plant-substance able to make her fertile, provided a man copulates with her, though he dies from it. Nicia first protests but then agrees to kidnap a passing stranger for the deed. To convince the religious-minded Lucretia, Nicia's wife, to cooperate, Ligurio, Callimacus' parasite friend, proposes to use her confessor, Timoteo. To sound the priest's morals, Ligurio first invents a tale whereby the wife of Nicia's nephew is said to be pregnant in a convent and must be made to swallow with his help a potion to abort the foetus, in exchange for money. Timoteo hesitates but then agrees. He is then told the tale Nicia already heard, and agrees to participate in it. To Lucrecia's objections, Timoteo counters that this is a case of possible versus certain good. Whether the copulator dies is uncertain, whereas the goodness of a birth offered to the Lord is certain. Ligurio, Timoteo, Nicia, and Callimacus' servant grab Callimacus disguised as a musican and force him inside Nicia's house, where he is conveyed in Lucretia's bed. The next day, Nicia explains to Ligurio the success of the operation, how he first examined Callimacus' body to detect any type of disease, and, satisfied on this and other matters, is now joyfully certain to be a father. To Callimacus he is so thankful that he hands over to him a key to one of his rooms whereby he can enter as he pleases.

:::: On one hand, deliberation time for deletions is a protection against admins taking it on themselves to make snap judgments before all voices have been heard.  That's a very important principle, as allowing everyone to be heard is a community value, so one wants to be very leery of compromising the principle.  Being careful about certain things does not require a bureaucracy.  And what's on the other side?  Nothing.  The page has already been there for ''four and a half years''; the time to do this right is trivial.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 07:06, 31 January 2011 (UTC)

Can we just copy and paste Wikiversity's help? Afterall, it's wiki. :) --[[User:Girdi|Girdi]] ([[User talk:Girdi|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Girdi|contribs]]) 23:09, 7 February 2011 (UTC)
: The page is under copyright, and its edit history is a record of the copyright holders.  Preferred technique is to import the page from Wikiversity, which brings the edit history with it, and do a history merge.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 23:45, 7 February 2011 (UTC)
:: ... and I've done that.  You can now find the Wikiversity page content in the {{plainlinks|{{fullurl:Help:Quizzes|action=history}}|revision history}} of the page here.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 00:07, 8 February 2011 (UTC)
::: Nice job! Suprised though that something from Wikimedia is copyrighted. Thought it was all free content. So does this mean now we can copy and paste over the help section into this article or do we have to also import it? --[[User:Girdi|Girdi]] ([[User talk:Girdi|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Girdi|contribs]]) 00:55, 8 February 2011 (UTC)
:::: It's &quot;free&quot; in the sense that one doesn't pay to use it; but it is not to be used without attribution.  It's not [[w:public domain|public domain]].  It's the intellectual property of the users who contributed to the page, and by the act of submitting their edits they agreed to release it under certain terms meant, in essence, to keep it free.

:::: The stuff I imported is in the edit history of this page; it is effectively now part of this page, just a part of it that doesn't happen to be visible in the most recent revision.  Restoring content that &quot;used to be here&quot; is no problem.  So just copy-and-paste what you want from one of the earlier revisions &amp;mdash;such as from the {{plainlinks|{{fullurl:Help:Quizzes|oldid=2027576}}|most recent imported one}}&amp;mdash; and you're sure to be fine.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 01:38, 8 February 2011 (UTC)

:::: All works are copyrighted, even &quot;free content&quot; works.

'''Interactive quizzes and exams''' are a great way for readers to test their knowledge, see what they have learned, and check their progress as they read a book.

== Quiz usage ==
Books are intended to help people learn new things. Quizzes can be used to complement and improve the educational usefulness of a book.  However, any work intended to only test a person's existing knowledge belongs at [[v:|Wikiversity]].

== Help Guide ==
Thanks to the contribution of users from Wikiversity, a complex tutorial on how to build your quiz is provided below.

=== The quiz tag ===
This is how to insert a quiz into your Wikibook.

{| class=&quot;prettytable&quot;
!wikitext&lt;br /&gt;(what you write)!!rendering&lt;br /&gt;(what you see)!!comments
|-
|valign=top width=200|&amp;lt;quiz&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;''insert questions here''&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/quiz&amp;gt;
|valign=top|
{|
|&lt;quiz&gt;

{''This is where questions would appear.''}

&lt;/quiz&gt;
|}
|valign=top|The ''quiz'' tags do the following:
* They insert some standard quiz options at the top and a colour-key for marking. The colour-key only appears when the question is marked.
* They add a &quot;submit&quot; button at the bottom for when the learner has finished the quiz and wants it marked.
* Everything between the quiz tags is parsed by the quiz extension and turned into questions if possible.

Theoretically it is possible to put ''quiz'' tags around each individual question, allowing a learner to mark each one in turn. 

'''Shuffling questions''': if the shuffle questions button is shown, the questions can be shuffled by clicking the button. This only works so long as the quiz-taker has not started to answer the questions. Once the quiz-taker starts answering, the order is locked.

|-
|valign=top|&amp;lt;quiz display=simple&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;''insert questions here''&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/quiz&amp;gt;
|valign=top|
{|
|&lt;quiz display=simple&gt;

{''This is where questions would appear.''}

&lt;/quiz&gt;
|}
|valign=top| 
* Importantly, the addition of &quot;display=simple&quot; as an attribute of the quiz tag removes the points table at the top. 
* This is useful for short quizzes, and especially for situations where you insert single questions between text blocks.

|-
|valign=top|&amp;lt;quiz shuffle=none&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;''insert questions here''&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/quiz&amp;gt;
|valign=top|
{|
|&lt;quiz shuffle=none&gt;

{''This is where questions would appear.''}

&lt;/quiz&gt;
|}
| valign=top|
* If you'd like to keep the points table but get rid of the button for shuffling questions, use ''shuffle=none'' as shown.

|}

=== Inserting questions ===

The types of questions available are show below.

An important point is that '''each question must be separated by a blank line''', otherwise they are merged together into one question.

=== How to use the examples ===

In the examples on this page, there is both ''wikitext'' and ''rendering''. The ''wikitext'' shows you the code, which you can copy and paste into your pages, or just learn and understand. The ''rendering'' shows you what the result will look like.  

==== Copying and pasting ====

The markup has been slightly simplified in order to help ''understanding''. If you copy and paste, you must insert &amp;lt;quiz&amp;gt; tags before and after the markup. You may wish to use the quiz tags with the &quot;display=simple&quot; option as shown above.

Note that the actual example below also use ''tables'' for clarity. If a quiz is inserted into a table, this modifies the appearance of a quiz - for example, boxes appear around some elements in the quiz. If you don't use a table, these boxes disappear and your quiz will look plainer.

When pasting, ensure that '''all the symbols are aligned with the left of the page''' - i.e. if any line begins with a space, formating errors may occur.

==== Live demos ====

All the examples below should work. Don't be afraid to try them out. Hitting the ''correction'' button is OK - it won't change or damage this page.

== Basic question types ==

=== Multiple choice / single response ===

{| class=&quot;prettytable&quot;
!wikitext!!rendering!!comments
|-
|style=&quot;vertical-align:top;&quot;|
&lt;pre&gt;
{Question
|type=&quot;()&quot;}
+ The correct answer.
- Distractor.
- Distractor.
- Distractor.
&lt;/pre&gt;
|style=&quot;vertical-align:top;&quot;|
{|
|
&lt;quiz display=simple&gt;
{Question
|type=&quot;()&quot;}
+ The correct answer.
- Distractor.
- Distractor.
- Distractor.
&lt;/quiz&gt;
|}
|style=&quot;vertical-align:top;&quot;|
* This type of question allows a '''single''' correct response and any number of distractors (3 distractors are shown, but it could be one, or nine, or any other number).
* The correct answer may be in any position, and is marked by a plus sign. Distractors are marked by minus signs.
* The wikitext shown should be inserted between &amp;lt;quiz&gt; tags as shown above.
* Answers appear in the same order as in the markup, so it is advisable to shuffle them before exporting into markup. 
* Every symbol, i.e. '''|''', +, - and any other symbols listed further down, '''must''' be on a new line.
* The symbols must '''begin''' the newline - no spaces before them.
* The borders are a result of the border around the wiki table. They are optional.
* A ''distractor'' is the standard term for a multiple choice option which is wrong.
* The () symbol in the type attribute is supposed to look like a radio button.
* To see the full colour code (with four colours), try doing the quiz and clicking the correction button.
* A ''second'' click on a radio button (i.e. a click on an already clicked radio button) will deselect it.
|}

=== True/false questions ===

{| class=&quot;prettytable&quot;
!wikitext!!rendering!!comments
|-
|style=&quot;vertical-align:top;&quot;|
&lt;pre&gt;
{Bulgaria and Rumania joined the 
European Union in 2007.
|type=&quot;()&quot;}
+ TRUE.
- FALSE.
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
{Switzerland is a member of the 
European Union.
|type=&quot;()&quot;}
- TRUE.
+ FALSE.
&lt;/pre&gt;
|style=&quot;vertical-align:top;&quot;|
{|width=260|
&lt;quiz display=simple&gt;
{Bulgaria and Rumania joined the European Union in 2007.
|type=&quot;()&quot;}
+ TRUE.
- FALSE.

{Switzerland is a member of the European Union.
|type=&quot;()&quot;}
- TRUE.
+ FALSE.
&lt;/quiz&gt;
|}
|style=&quot;vertical-align:top;&quot;|
* In many quiz systems, true/false questions are listed as a separate kind of question, although they are really nothing more than a variety of multiple choice with a single response. The Quiz Extension correctly treats true/false questions as multiple choice with a single response. They are implemented in exactly the same way as above.
* The first of the two examples shows a true/false question where the correct answer is &quot;true&quot;.
* The second of the two examples shows a true/false question where the correct answer is &quot;false&quot;.
* The examples are live and can be tried out now.
* If you have a large number of true/false questions, a more efficient way to lay them out would be to use the [[Help:Quizzes#Tabular response type with radio buttons|tabular response type with radio buttons]] documented below.

&lt;/quiz&gt;
|}
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|
* This type of question is a multiple choice where more than one answer could be correct.
* Correct answers are indicated by plus signs, incorrect ones by minus signs.
* The wikitext shown should be inserted between &amp;lt;quiz&gt; tags as shown above.
* Answers appear in the same order as in the markup, so it is advisable to shuffle them before exporting into markup. 
* Every symbol, i.e. '''|''', +, - and any other symbols listed further down, '''must''' be on a new line.
* The symbols must '''begin''' the newline - no spaces before them.
* The borders are a result of the border around the wiki table. They are optional.
* The [] symbol in the type attribute is supposed to look like a checkbox.

* In a ''typed response'' the quiz-taker types an answer into a textfield using the keyboard.
* The question type is signalled using '''&quot;{}&quot;''' as the argument of the ''type''.
* A textfield is inserted using curly brackets at the desired position of the textfield. 
** Note that curly brackets alone don't create a textfield. The curly brackets must have spaces between them and the enclosed text. '''{ Answer }''' works, but '''{Answer}''' doesn't work.
** The correct answer must be inserted between the curly brackets.
** The textfield can be positioned anywhere in the text. Text before and after the text field will display as normal text.
* The borders are a result of the border around the wiki table. They are optional.
* A non-breaking space was inserted between { and |type=  because some text is required at that position (slightly buggy thing).
* Answers are case-sensitive, meaning if the answer contains a capital letter, it must be typed in the answer box with a capital letter.

* Typed responses often have more than one possible answer. You can list all the possible answers inside the curly brackets using a pipe to separate them.
* In the example, there are two possible answers. Try it - the demo is live.

|style=&quot;vertical-align:top;&quot;|
* To modify the size of the textfield, add an underscore and an integer following the answer within the curly brackets to represent the number of glyph spaces you need.
* This number depends, however it should be around n+2 (where n is the number of glyphs in the answer)

|-

|style=&quot;vertical-align:top;&quot;|
* You can group the items into one only question.
* Do not use line breaks between &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; and &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

* '''Case-sensitivity''': typed responses are ''case-sensitive'' unless you add '''''(i)''''' at the position shown. The (i) stands for case-'''in'''sensitive.

* Gapfills (or cloze exercises) are created in almost exactly the same way as typed responses. The difference is that you just write a bit more text and add a few more textfields.

* Numerical responses are a subtle modification of typed responses. The syntax is identical, except for some additions which allow numerical ranges and numerical tolerances if the answer is a number.
* In the example to the right, the uncertainty over Plato's date of birth is reflected in the answer by using a '''range'''. A simple hyphen between the numbers permits all numbers inbetween.

* This is an example of specifying a '''tolerance'''. The critical part is &quot;5%&quot;, which specifies the expected tolerance of 5%. In this example, values between 95 and 105 should work, but try it.
* At the time of writing, the underscore method of limiting the size of the textfield does not yet work in combination with a tolerance specification, so a range may be a better method of specifying numerical accuracy.

* Feedback is text which is initially hidden, and then shown to the user when they submit the quiz for correction. Feedback typically serves the purposes of encouragement, explanation, congratulation and commiseration.
* Feedback is set with all types by using a double vertical line '''||''' immediately after a response. 
* The pipes beginning the ''feedback'' section must be on a new line.
* Unlike some other quiz systems, '''all''' feedback items are displayed on correction. With other quiz systems, the norm is to display the feedback only for those items which were selected by the user.
* To try out the feedback effect, choose a response and click the correction button. The feedback will then appear.

===Using images as answers ===

* Unfortunately there does not yet seem to be a way of putting these into a row or tabularising the layout.
* Although this has not been done here for reasons of space, it is generally good practice to specify some kind of tooltip text for the images, but try to avoid text which gives away the answer.

===Using images in the question===

{| class=&quot;prettytable&quot;
!wikitext!!rendered!!comments
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;quiz display=simple&gt;
{ What is this? [[Image:Butterfly tongue.jpg|100px| ]]

- Tiger
+ Butterfly
- Bee

&lt;/quiz&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

| type=&quot;()&quot; }
- Tiger
+ Butterfly
- Bee
- Fly
&lt;/quiz&gt;
|}
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|
In this example, the image is part of the question. You just use normal wiki-markup to insert the image(s).
|}

=== Using animations ===

The section adds no new technical tricks, but it looks pretty.

{| class=&quot;prettytable&quot;
|valign=top|

&lt;quiz  display=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;

+ a radial engine
&lt;/quiz&gt;
|}
|valign=top|
{|
|&lt;quiz display=simple&gt;
{ [[Image:Pyramid of 35 spheres animation.gif|thumb|left|How many balls are there here?]]&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot; /&gt;
| typ=&quot;{}&quot; }
{ 35 }
&lt;/quiz&gt;
|}


|}

===Hyperlinks and other markup===

==== Markup that works inside quizzes ====

* Hyperlinks: &lt;nowiki&gt;[[....]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.
* Images: &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Image:....]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.
* Other media: &lt;nowiki&gt;[[....]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.
* Bold and italic.
* &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;big&gt; and &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;

==== Markup that partly works inside quizzes ====

* Templates: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{....}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.
** ''subst'' doesn't work.
* Tables: &lt;nowiki&gt;{|....|}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.
* Headings: e.g. &lt;nowiki&gt;===....===&lt;/nowiki&gt;.
** '''Warning:''' At the moment there is a problem with the table of contents feature.
* Lists and indents: using #, * and :

===Adding music and sound effects ===

This is similar to insertion of images. Standard wiki markup is used.

=== Configuring points ===

* By default, there is 1 point for a correct answer and 0 for a wrong answer.
* You can change this for the whole quiz by using a ''points'' attribute for the ''quiz'' tag.
* The format is &quot;X/Y!&quot;, where X gives the points for a correct answer and Y the points for a wrong answer. The Y points are expressed as a positive integer but are ''subtracted'' from the score.

* A ''coefficient'' is a way of giving a weighting to a specific question. Normally all the questions have the same number of points. By default, they all have one point. By specifying a coefficient for each or any question, you can multiply the number of points for that question by the coefficient.
* Coefficients can be both numbers above one and numbers between 0 and 1. If the coefficient is above 1, the question will receive greater weighting. If the coefficient is less than 1, the question will receive less weighting.
* You '''must''' put inverted commas around the argument of the ''coef'' attribute.

|}

== Troubleshooting ==

* You '''cannot''' test out the quiz while editing a page, because the ''submit'' button is grayed out. If you wish to test your new quiz, then create a sandbox page somewhere else first (e.g. as a subpage of your user page), then test the quiz there, and finally transfer the quiz to its final location (and test it again anyway).
* The quiz was developed for IE6, IE7, Firefox (and Opera?), but display quality on Opera may not be optimal, and there may be display differences between browsers.
* A reminder: each question must be separated by a blank line, otherwise the questions are merged together into one question.

== Project Portfolio Management (PPM) ==
A portfolio is composed of programs or projects without dependency between them. It aims strategic business objectives. Portfolio management is responsible for prioritization of program/projects and one of its goals is to have a better resource usage among them. A portfolio manager is responsible to manage several portfolios.

One example or portfolio would be to improve facility services. It would be composed of a program to improve water, other to improve electricity, other to improve gas.

== Program Management  ==
A program is a collection of related projects, all of them with similar goals. If projects have similar goals they would have a better performance through a centralized management. They will have also an improved resource utilization in those cases.

== Project Management  ==
A project management is application of tools an techniques to achieve a specific goal, reaching committed  deadline and budget.

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Талламанболх 1'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;big&gt;''Practice Quiz 1''&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

It's time now to test what you have learned in the past 3 lessons and alphabet. This exam will test your knowledge in the alphabet, vocabulary, grammar, and culture. If you have scored at least more than a 70%, then you should be safe in moving on to the next lessons. If not, you should go back and review the past few lessons and work on the topics that stumped you the most. Good luck, аьтто хийла!


&lt;quiz display=simple&gt;

{'''Part I: Language and Alphabet''' - these questions will test your ability to pick up on the Chechen alphabet. }

{How would you [[:w:Transliteration|transliterate]] '''So khuzakh 'ash vu''' in Cyrillic?
|type=&quot;()&quot;}
- Хьан цIе хIун ю?
||&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;This would transliterate as &quot;Han ts'e hun yu&quot; and means &quot;What is your name&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
- Нохчийн мотт чIогIа хаза бу.
||&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;This would transliterate as &quot;Nohchyn mott ch'ogh haz vu&quot; and mean &quot;The Chechen language is very beautiful&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
+ Со кхузахь Iаш ву.
||&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;This is the correct answer. It means &quot;I live here&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
- Со хIийнца АшгIабат-гIалахь ву.
||&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;This would transliterate as &quot;So h'ints Asghabat-ghalakh vu&quot; and mean &quot;I am now in Ashgabat&quot;.&lt;/span&gt;

{What sound in English does the Chechen letter, '''Аь''', closely resemble?
|type=&quot;()&quot;}
+ &quot;A&quot; as in &quot;apple&quot;
||&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;This is the correct answer. Аь closely resembles that of typical short &quot;a&quot; vowel sound in English, like in &quot;apple&quot; and &quot;path&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
- &quot;A&quot; as in &quot;fade&quot;
||&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;This letter does not make a long &quot;a&quot; sound. &quot;A&quot; as in &quot;fade&quot; would be represented by the Chechen diphthong of &quot;ей&quot;.&lt;/span&gt;
- &quot;O&quot; as in &quot;pond&quot;
||&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;Sometimes in foreign languages, the &quot;a&quot; might sound like a short &quot;a&quot; sound or a short &quot;o&quot; sound, but not in this case. That would just be a normal А in Chechen.&lt;/span&gt;
- &quot;Ab&quot; as in &quot;abstract&quot;
||&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;Although the Chechen letter, Аь, might look like an &quot;a&quot; and a &quot;b&quot; together, it does not resemble these letters in English&lt;/span&gt;

{What other two letters in Chechen when combined can make the same sound as the letter '''Я'''?
|type=&quot;()&quot;}
- уа
||&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;These letters make the sound, &quot;ua&quot;. The Chechen, &quot;У&quot;, is actually a &quot;u&quot; sound.&lt;/span&gt;
- ва
||&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;These letters make the sound &quot;va&quot; or &quot;wa&quot;.&lt;/span&gt;
- ра
||&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;These letters make the sound &quot;ra&quot;, which might confuse the learner since Я looks like an &quot;r&quot; in English&lt;/span&gt;
+ йа
||&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;This is the correct answer. ЙА can make the sound, &quot;ya&quot;, which is the same sound the letter Я makes&lt;/span&gt;

{What would the word, '''Чудигар''', transliterate to in English?
|type=&quot;()&quot;}
- Shudigar
||&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;This would be Шудигар&lt;/span&gt;
+ Chudigar
||&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;This is the correct answer. Careful not to confuse the false friend letters with English&lt;/span&gt;
- Hydigap
||&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;This would be Хидигап&lt;/span&gt;
- Chydirap
||&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;This would be Чудирап&lt;/span&gt;

{What language category does Chechen fall under?
|type=&quot;()&quot;}
- Indo-European, Germanic, North Germanic
||&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;Chechen is not part of the Indo-European language family&lt;/span&gt;
- Indo-European, Caucasian, Nakh
||&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;Chechen is not part of the Indo-European language family&lt;/span&gt;
+ Caucasian, North Caucasian, Nakh
||&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;This is the correct answer. Chechen is in the Caucasian Language family, part of the Northern Caucasian subcategory, and further divided into the Nakh languages. It's also argued, however, that it might also fall under the Alarodian language family as well.&lt;/span&gt;
- Semetic, Arabic, Caucasian
||&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;Although borrowing sounds and vocabulary from Arabic, Chechen does not fall under the Semetic language category&lt;/span&gt;


{ ---- }

{'''Part II: Vocabulary''' - answer these questions to the best of your ability. Questions that are entirely in Chechen should be responded with the most logical answer or response. }

{Хьо мичахь Iаш ву?
|type=&quot;()&quot;}
- Сан цIе Магомед ю
||&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;This means &quot;My name is Mohammed&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
+ Со Грозный-ГIалахь Iаш ву
||&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;This is the correct answer. The question was &quot;Where do you live?&quot; and the response is &quot;I live in Grozny&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
- Дика ду, баркалла
||&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;This means &quot;Ok, thank you&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
- ХIaъ, Iаш ву
||&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;This means &quot;Yes, I live/reside&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

{What does &quot;йиша&quot; mean in English?
|type=&quot;()&quot;}
- Father
||&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;This would be Да&lt;/span&gt;
+ Sister
||&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;This is the correct answer.&lt;/span&gt;
- Brother
||&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;This would be Ваша&lt;/span&gt;
- Cousin
||&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;This would be Шича&lt;/span&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Supply base availability (alpha = 0.91) ==
=== Items ===

*There were a lot of qualified and capable suppliers. (0.787)
*Many suppliers had the necessary capabilities to produce all items in the bundle. (0.915)
*Many suppliers possessed the required capacities. (0.922)

=== Source ===

*[http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jom.2007.05.001 Schoenherr/Mabert (2008): The use of bundling in B2B online reverse auctions. Journal of Operations Management, Vol. 26, No. 1, pp. 81-95.]

=== Comments ===

The central value of the Likert scale was 4. However, the mean values of the items are 4.778, 4.984, and 5.071, and thus larger than 4. It might therefore be recommended to use a more explicit wording (e.g. &quot;a '''very''' high number of suppliers&quot; instead of &quot;many suppliers&quot;). This could help to approach normal distributions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{honor_header|1|1938|Outreach|General Conference}}

==1. Describe the national, state or provincial, AY, Pathfinder, and Christian flags.==

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;5&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot;
|-
|
|[[Image:Pathfinderflag.jpg|thumb|300px|'''Pathfinder Flag:''' The Pathfinder flag is made from one of several materials, cotton bunting, rayon, or nylon. The flag is divided through the center both vertically and horizontally making four equal parts. The background colors are royal blue and white alternately sewed together with the upper left hand comer being royal blue. The Pathfinder emblem is centered in the heart of the background. The colors are descriptive of the purposes and ideals of Pathfindering. White means purity, blue means loyalty, red reminds us of the shed blood of Christ (sacrifice), and gold means excellence. The symbols also have meanings. The shield is the protection of God, the sword is his word, the Bible, and the triangle represents completeness. Completeness of the Godhead (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit), and completeness of the three parts of education (Mental, Physical, and Spiritual).]]
|-
|[[Image:Ayflag.jpg|thumb|300px|'''AY Flag:''' The background is red and white, red symbolizing the blood of Christ and white representing purity. In the center, there is a logo that has AY which means Adventist Youth and it has three angels meaning the 3 angels message.]]
|[[Image:Christian flag.svg|thumb|300px|'''Christian Flag:''' The &quot;Christian Flag&quot; is a white flag with a blue canton and a red cross in it. It was designed by Charles Overton in 1897 to represent Protestants of all denominations. The cross symbolizes the crucifixion of Christ.]]
|}

===Current state/provincial flags===
&lt;!-- Find images of all the provincial flags of your country and put them here.  --&gt;
&lt;gallery&gt;




&lt;/gallery&gt;

==2. Know how to display the national flag with two other flags under the following situations: a. Camp out/camporee b. Fair c. Pathfinder Day program d. Parade==
==3. Demonstrate how to fold and salute your national flag. Mention when and how it should be displayed. ==
===Folding===
===Flag Protocol===
==4. Explain the meaning of and reason for the National Anthem, and recite the words from memory. ==
==5. Give the rights and responsibilities of a citizen of your country. ==
===Rights===
===Responsibilities===
==6. Have an interview with a local, regional, or national official of your country, and learn about his duties. ==
It is generally easier to get a local official to agree to an interview, though it is often more exciting to interview a more prominent person.  The interview can be accomplished during a club meeting, and multiple Pathfinders can ask questions.  Invite your guest well ahead of time, and make sure everyone in the club is on time.  A visit by an official would be a very good reason to have everyone in the club wear their class A uniforms.  If desired, you can make up several questions ahead of time, writing them on index cards, and distributing them to the members of your club.  But do not be so rigid as to not allow them to ask spontaneous questions.  Having questions prepared ahead of time on index cards are a good way to get things rolling.  Here are some suggested questions:
* Could you describe a typical day at work?
* What is the most difficult part of your job?
* What is the most satisfying aspect of your job?
* To whom do you report?
* How did you get your position?  Were you elected, appointed, or hired?
* How should a young person prepare for a life of public service?

==7. Write a one-page essay or give a two-minute oral report about a famous person in your country. Mention what he has done to gain his recognition. ==
This would be an excellent opportunity to present a worship during the opening exercises of a regular club meeting.  Encourage your Pathfinder to choose a person they are personally interested in.  If they cannot think of anyone themselves, have a list of suggested persons at hand and encourage them to choose from the list.  Famous people might be historical figures, politicians, actors, sports stars, or anyone else.  It would be preferable to choose a person who has been a positive influence on the country.

Although the requirement asks that you &quot;mention what ''he'' has done to gain ''his'' recognition,&quot; this should not be interpreted as excluding women.  Men are not the ''only'' famous people in a country.

Note that just because the requirement suggests that the famous person should be male (''his'' recognition), the Pathfinder should in no way feel constrained to limit the selection to just men.

==8. Do one of the following ==
===a. Make a list of ten famous quotations from leaders of your country.===
===b. Make a list of ten famous historic places in your country. ===
===c. Make a list of ten famous historic events in your country.===
==9. Describe what you can do as a citizen to help your church and country. ==
The best way to help either your church or your country is by ''getting involved''.  Edmund Burke, an English philosopher summed this up when he said ''&quot;The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.&quot;''

In your church, this means that you will show up for services on a regular basis.  It also means you will support it with your tithes and offering, show up for business meetings, and not wait to be asked before you volunteer your services.  If you see something that needs done, ''do it.''  If you do not have the skill to do it, or you think that you need permission first, talk to your pastor, an elder, deacon, or deaconess.  Find your ministry!

For your country, it is much the same.  Show up for public meetings, stay informed about the issues of the day, vote if you are eligible, and pay your taxes fairly and promptly.

==10. Go through the steps of an individual acquiring citizenship in the country and learn how this is done. ==
==11. Know how to explain the process of government in your country. ==
==12. Explain the meaning of this statement Jesus made in Matthew 22:21: &quot;Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's. ==
This verse teaches that governmental authority is to be respected, as long as it does not conflict with the moral obligations of being a Christian.  Government serves a holy purpose; preserving social order, promoting the well-being of its citizens, and protecting their safety.  If you believe that this does not apply today because you see the government as corrupt, you are urged to research the Roman government of the first century A.D. when these words were spoken by Jesus.  Was Herod corrupt?  Was Pilate just?

==13. Explain why laws are established in your country. ==

== Incubator Proposal ==

Apparently there has been some discussion on foundation-l about using Wikibooks as an incubator for new projects (or sub-projects, I wasn't part of the original conversation so I don't know all the details). The example given was that a &quot;spin off&quot; could be created, say &quot;Wikibooks How To Guide&quot;, that could be developed and then launched when ready with some fanfare and publicity. This feels a little like how Wikijunior was developed. We could build it here, maybe in its own namespace, and then if it doesn't take off or develop the way we think it will then it could be left in WB or moved into the mainspace. This would also link into my views on the discussion on the deletion process (above) where I had suggested a way of hiding developing material away would help improve the WB experience for a casual reader... so, thoughts? Anybody up for creating a Wikibooks Incubator here? &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 21:19, 25 October 2010 (UTC)

: I hadn't seen the discussion on foundation-l. My understanding is WMF decided Wikibooks couldn't do it and the Wikibooks community supported this by including [[WB:INCUBATOR]]. If we ignore that though, I think [[incubator:]] would be the best place for new projects to be developed. If that project were closed by next suggestion would be [[wikiversity:]] before wikibooks because its scope is broader and I think Wikibooks has become more focused sense incubation was last allowed here and as it is incubation of Wikijunior and the Cookbook is messy at times. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 00:15, 26 October 2010 (UTC)

:I was writing this as Darklama replied. I read through the thread on the list over this including the two replies from Robert Horning [http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/foundation-l/2010-October/061777.html] [http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/foundation-l/2010-October/061849.html].  Definitely, [[WB:INCUBATOR]] would need to go for this to happen.  Despite being very active here, I am not what I'd consider an old-timer, so I do not know its origins, though I see a [[Wikibooks_talk:What_is_Wikibooks/Archive_1#Wikibooks_is_not_a_seed_for_another_wikisite|reference]] to it being there back in December 2005.  Rob Horning wrote on the list &quot;How-to books are on Wikibooks mainly due to the long-ago viewpoint that Wikibooks ought to be an incubator project for all kinds of ideas that didn't quite fit on Wikipedia... and the Wikibooks community was generally willing to try them out for a time.&quot;  So maybe the community was no longer willing at some point and put that entry in [[WB:WIW]].  I'm vaguely familiar with the video game strategy guide purge; what if they were in a separate namespace as an incubator project&amp;mdash;would the outcome still have been the same?  However, things have changed.  Many of the &quot;old-timers&quot; are gone, Jimbo Wales and Wikibooks co-founder Karl Wick are no longer involved, and today WMF functionaries [[Wikibooks:Reading_room/General#Five-year_WMF_targets|don't seem to pay us much heed]].  So I don't think anyone would swoop in from high to call for the removal of incubated content. 

:Bringing up Wikijunior above is an interesting example.  From what I've heard from others and read at [[m:Wikijunior#Online_Project|m:Wikijunior]] (&quot;Wikijunior aims to produce a separate website&quot;&amp;mdash;http://wikijunior.org), Wikijunior was supposed to be split out at some point.  Certainly that has not happened.  It's quite likely that anything we would incubate would never leave the nest.  The Cookbook is theoretically supposed to be a book, and Wikijunior is like a mini-me version of Wikibooks for children.  They, at least, aren't concerns with regard to diluting the Wikibooks &quot;brand&quot;.  I'd be concerned with compatibility with the main project for any incubation.  I've not seen any new policies or guidelines ratified during my time here, and someone's statement on Meta that my talk page is often more active than the reading rooms is apt, so I lack confidence that something this groundbreaking would have the administrative support or community involvement to work.  I would have to see specific incubation proposals before I could be sure.  &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 00:47, 26 October 2010 (UTC)

:: I think the inclusion of How-to books use to be controversial in Wikibooks' past, but I think that has long been resolved. I think there isn't a need to incubate How-tos and there is no longer any need in general to find them a new home at some other/new project. I think part of resolving that problem came when a way was found to reclassify individual how to books into specific subject areas. If proposed works are compatible with our main project there isn't likely to be any need to incubate because they would likely already be within Wikibooks' scope, and if they are not compatible with our main project, they are more likely to be compatible with Wikiversity and it would be better to host the works there. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 01:11, 26 October 2010 (UTC)

::: No, the WMF hasn't at all decided against Wikibooks doing incubation, and I know at least a couple of WMF board members who would actively look forward to such action.  Frankly, community initiative is what is needed here, and the strongest community for this is the Wikibooks community.  The new languages incubator is too tied up in bureaucracy, and Wikiversity isn't really a strong enough and mature enough community for this.  So I would say, step up Wikibooks, and give us the community leadership we need :)--[[User:Pharos|Pharos]] ([[User talk:Pharos|talk]]) 02:55, 26 October 2010 (UTC)

::::Additionally, the incubator says clearly on its main page that it is only for new languages of existing projects.  I recall some people saying that Wikibooks lost contributors when the video game strategy guides were forced out.  Part of me wonders if we could gain additional participation with fresh ideas.  Robert Horning's [http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/foundation-l/2010-October/061849.html post] states &quot;Previously, nearly all &quot;project incubator&quot; efforts were done strictly on Meta, Wikibooks, or as sub-pages in the &quot;User:&quot; space on Wikipedia&quot;, so there's support for it at Wikibooks.  On the list, Samuel Klein mentioned a proposal for a new project, [[m:WikiScholar|WikiScholar]].  That would work great at Wikiversity since it's a complement and deals with original research; people were discussing creating a Cite namespace there already and that proposal is for a universal bibliography.  There may be a few easily-integrated proposals that Wikibooks can take in quickly without clashing with its scope, if they have enough support. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 03:41, 26 October 2010 (UTC)

::::: A decision to not allow Wikibooks to incubate by the WMF is at least part of Wikibooks lore and dates back to at least 2004 when [[Meta:New project policy]] was policy. Maybe the decision was simply lost with time, but that isn't to say that today WMF couldn't reverse a decision or choose to ignore a previous one.
:::::: I don't know of any such decision; all projects are welcome to create new namespaces or incubate new wikiprojects or larger Projects as they see fit.  This isn't the sort of decision in which the WMF has ever involved itself to my knowledge, though individual people may have shared their opinions from time to time -- as I am now.  [[User:Sj|Sj]] ([[User talk:Sj|talk]]) 15:49, 26 October 2010 (UTC)
::::: Anyways I still think the incubator or Wikiversity would be the better places. Yes Incubator says its only for new languages of existing projects, but there is no reason its scope couldn't be expanded. I've read what I could find about the current discussion of incubation of new projects in the archives for foundation-l now and I see that people have also said that Incubator and its scope was never officially approved and agreed to by the whole Wikimedia communities, which seems like a good reason to reexamine what its purpose really should be. How is Wikiversity not strong and mature enough for incubation? I think incubation helped Wikibooks in the past to a degree reach any strength and maturity you see in us, but Wikibooks also with time outgrew it as part of continuing to grow, strengthen, mature and having gained a decent focus. I think now Wikiversity and new projects would benefit more from being hosted there. New projects would benefit from the fact one of Wikiversity's goals is to experiment with new ways wiki technology can be used as a tool to educate people, and Wikiversity would benefit because new projects would help it to grow, strength the community, help it reach maturity, and help bring focus to its goals. I haven't looked at the list of proposed new projects lately, but a lot of them when I last looked were things which were already within Wikibooks' or Wikiversity's scope. I think that is the real reason why there hasn't been any new projects approved since Wikiversity. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 07:15, 26 October 2010 (UTC)

Looking over some of the more popular [[m:proposals for new projects|proposals for new projects]] at Meta, [[m:Wikinac|Wikinac]] is an almanac and might be possible here, [[m:WikiEarth|WikiEarth]] is an atlas covered by Commons' [[commons:Atlas|Atlas]], [[m:Wikikids|Wikikids]] is a children's encyclopedia that could have been lumped into Wikijunior if its scope hadn't gotten limited, [[m:Medical dictionary wiki|Medical dictionary wiki]] could be put in Wiktionary, [[m:WikiMusic|WikiMusic]] seems to be getting infringed on by [[Songbook]] and [[Tablature]], [[m:Wikiscope|Wikiscope]] could be put in Meta or Strategy, [[m:Wikithink|Wikithink]] is a duplicate of Wikiversity, not sure about [[m:Wikihistory|Wikihistory]], [[m:Essentialpedia|Essentialpedia]] is a fork of Wikipedia, and [[m:Wikitainment Guides|Wikitainment Guides]] is not in scope for the WMF.  There are others.  But that page in general is ignored and the sortable list is only there because I refactored the page about a year ago. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 13:07, 26 October 2010 (UTC)

: I guess you see what I mean than? Wikikids could be Wikijunior at Wikipedia btw. Books in [[Subject:History]] probably covers or should cover everything that WikiHistory would likely cover. Entertainment Wikia is probably where people should contribute for something like Wikitainment Guides because as you said not in scope for WMF. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:06, 26 October 2010 (UTC)
:: I do not understand our current bias against game guides, as opposed to guides for other software.  (I would understand it better were it framed in terms of making both equally educational, rather than an opposition to a certain subject area.)  I don't think we suffer from a 'dilution of brand' by letting people develop educational materials about what interests them, including gaming, entertainment, and other popular culture.  I do think it is appropriate to hold all works to a standard of educational value and excellence, but when that translates into a restriction by ''subject matter'' it crosses the line into topic censorship, which we elsewhere discourage.  [[User:Sj|Sj]] ([[User talk:Sj|talk]]) 15:49, 26 October 2010 (UTC)
::: Magazines like Nintendo Power isn't likely to be considered educational by current standards in most contexts. Wikibooks doesn't restrict works by ''subject matter'', but by the purpose. Annotated texts of electronic games, the cultural significants of electronic games, the literary significants of electronic games, and the educational use of electronic games in classrooms to teach subjects are all examples in which electronic game coverage is considered educational and within scope. I'm not happy with the exact method of exclusion and I think we can do better, but I do think its fair and reasonable to exclude certain aspects of gaming based on whether its educational or not. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 17:38, 26 October 2010 (UTC)

:I am very skeptical that wikibooks is the place to incubate new projects. I think that I agree with Darklama that incubator or WV are better suited, particularly since any particular project looking for a place to incubate could start a WV learning project to experimentally find out if a that project idea could work on a wiki.  A second thought that occurs to me reading through Adrignola's commment is that it might be sensible for projects that are looking a place to incubate to turn to the most similar existing project.  For example, the wiktionary people would have a much better idea about how to help organize a medical terms dictionary then we would here.  Somehow if we tried to incubate the medical dictionary wiki here we would be failing to utilize the wiktionary communities hard earned expertise about creating dictionary's on a wiki.  And worse we would be trying to re-solve the problems they've encountered for ourselves. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub]][[Special:Contributions/Thenub314|314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 16:43, 26 October 2010 (UTC)
:: Yes I think turning to similar projects for incubation is the way to go. If you start putting all incubations on just one project you start to blur the lines between the projects and confuse people where exactly people should be concentrating their efforts. I'm not concerned with diluting projects, but with further blurring the lines between what Wikibooks and Wikiversity are for example. If a dictionary of medical terms were to be start being hosted at Wikibooks than you would blur the lines between what Wikibooks and Wiktionary are too. Existing projects are better prepared to contribute to new projects which are similar to their goals and interests as well. If we begin saying dictionary of medical terms can be hosted at Wikibooks than other dictionaries would want to be hosted at Wikibooks as well, and than you might as well turn Wiktionary into a book and merge Wiktionary with Wikibooks. I personally wouldn't object to Wiktionary and Wikipedia both becoming books at Wikibooks, but I seriously doubt most people would be happy with that idea, and so we should try to find the most appropriate place for new projects instead of trying to make Wikibooks into the place for everything. Wikiversity is more appropriate for everything else that is educational and doesn't fit into another project already. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 17:38, 26 October 2010 (UTC)
:::I agree with Darklama's assessment.  It makes no sense to incubate unbooklike projects here (such as dictionaries or research projects).  I don't think we need to change anything for us to be an incubator of books.  That's pretty much what we do already. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 12:46, 27 October 2010 (UTC)
::::It's no so much incubating books, but book-like projects, or at least that's what I thought was being proposed. So, WikiHowTo, the guide to do-it-yourself, could start here in its own namespace or incubator namespace because that would make it easier to structure it for future spin-off.  In doing so it could have a different manual-of-style, and would have different standards around inclusion criteria, etc. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 14:55, 27 October 2010 (UTC)
::::: The point is anyone is free to make a do-it-yourself book right now and it doesn't require a new namespace to do it. Every book has its own manual-of-style to begin with and standards around which material is included, etc. Books don't need to be spun-off in the future because they are in scope right now. To say that such work will have their own project in the future would be to limit the type of books Wikibooks are allowed in to have in the future in some arbitrary way that isn't likely to make any sense. BTW we already have do-it-yourself/howto books like [[How To Assemble A Desktop PC]]. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 16:50, 27 October 2010 (UTC)
:::::: Hmmm, I guess I didn't explain myself very well, probably by choosing a bad example (and yes I know we have how to guides)... Perhaps I should use different terminology. If today somebody started writing recipes (i.e., if we didn't have the Cookbook) they would probably get deleted for not fitting the inclusion criteria. If, instead, someone started an &quot;incubator&quot; discussion saying a cookbook should be developed starting by importing recipes from other projects and then overlaying them with technique, ingredient and equipment guides a debate would follow. At some point we'd arrive at agreement on the scope of this idea and a change to the inclusion criteria to allow it to develop. People would &quot;sign up&quot; to support it and help get it started. Over time it would develop and then, maybe, someone would then propose spinning it off to create Wikicook. All I'm suggesting is that this debate, creation of a &quot;sub project&quot; that extends the inclusion criteria, etc., is carried out here where it is a small change to our scope rather than at Meta as a &quot;proposal for a new project&quot;. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 22:01, 28 October 2010 (UTC)

:::::::I see what you mean now. That is a great idea. Remember that the incubated project has to fit into the scope of the wiki (as your cookbook example did) that is incubating it.

Wading into here after a long, long absence from the Reading Room.  Contrary to the statements made by SJ, there was a decision made by the WMF board of trustees about the status of Wikibooks as a project incubator, but it was done very informally and made through private e-mails (some of which I no longer have, unfortunately) talk pages, Founation-l, Meta, and other places.  The universal decision that was supported by all of the then members of the board of trustees universally said that Wikibooks was not to be the incubator for new projects.  I really nailed them down on that and then made numerous changes to policy statements both here and on Meta to send that point home.  Previously, the almost universal statement on Meta about how people should work with new project ideas was &quot;try it on Wikibooks first&quot;.

I was an admin here on Wikibooks and tired of constantly deleting content that clearly didn't fit on Wikibooks, some of which were huge projects.  One in particular that I got into a full blown wheel war over (not just a mere edit war) was the archiving of Wikimania content on Wikibooks.  I got bold and moved most of it to Meta, only to have Jimbo come back and get the developers to reinstate all of the content, which promptly got a VfD discussion and had it deleted by &quot;community consensus&quot; a couple of weeks later.  It is now on a completely separate wiki, which IMHO is how it should have been dealt with in the first place.  My #1 objection to the Wikimania content is that none of it was even remotely linked from the front page and was mostly added in stealth.  It wasn't until there were hundreds of pages on Wikibooks that I even noticed that the content was even on this wiki.  In other words, Wikibooks was being used merely as a web hosting service and nothing more.  Wikibooks policies were being clearly ignored and it was a project entirely unto itself.

I could name some other similar kinds of projects that came up from time to time, many of which I was able to successfully relocate onto other projects, including Wikiversity (I pretty much got the ball started to create that as a sister project), Wikisource (multiple projects including one complete language project there I helped to create), and Wiktionary.  I simply got tired of having to contradict people who were told by admins on other projects (notably editors and admins on Wikipedia and Meta) that Wikibooks was the place for their concepts.

To support the notion that there needed to be a project incubator, I even went so far as to create another sister project proposal to create a project incubator.  Well, we got [http://incubator.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page the Wikimedia incubator], but the new project incubator concept itself got thrown out of the window somewhere along the line after co-opting the name and even many of those who wanted to help manage the project.

To top this off, Wikicities (now Wikia) was conceived and for quite some time strongly encouraged to be the incubator for new projects.  Certainly it is by far and away much easier to create a new Wikia project than it is to create a Wikimedia sister project.  I needn't go into how much easier.

Most of the effort and the reasons for coming up with many of the policies now being dealt with here came from those working here on Wikibooks trying to find an identity for this project.  Keep in mind that Wikibooks itself was from a spin-off from Wikipedia, in part because Karl Wick started to write the [[Organic Chemistry]] Wikibook (currently that effort is still on Wikipedia as [[w:Outline of organic chemistry]] in a slightly different form, but the early edits for Karl Wick are still there) and that for a couple of years there wasn't even a requirement that the content written here on en.Wikibooks was even in English.  It was during my tenure as admin that the final non-English content was finally transwikied or deleted, with the final deletions far more recent than you would imagine.  Wikibooks was perceived as a dumping ground for nearly everything that didn't fit elsewhere, and keep in mind that places like Wikia didn't exist for people who wanted to create another wiki.  Their option was to either do without, or host the software on their own computer equipment.

Enough of the history of Wikibooks lesson.  The question here is on how to move forward.  I suppose that I burned most of the bridges that brought project incubation to Wikibooks, so I guess I'm to be blamed for the current status in that regard.  Wikiversity also has been much more open to trying new things out and has been going through a similar kind of self-identification that Wikibooks went through earlier.  How-to books came to Wikibooks before that process of rejecting the project incubation happened, which is why for good or ill it is here to stay.  Besides, How-to manuals are much more book-like than much of the other content that was removed some time ago and has pretty much stood the test of time as being compatible with the rest of the Wikibooks community.

== Wikibooks concept Proposal ==

Since I am a kind of outsider, excuse me if I do not follow the status quo. As I recently became a student, my greatest concern is &quot;what to read now?&quot;. My proposal is simple. I would like to see a wikipage that answers the question &quot;What books/articles should one read and in what order shoud one read them in order to become familiar with a subject?&quot; I guess this can be a kind of the wikilibrary for wikiversity or the way to study your subject for the wikischolar journal. (so to speak in wiki-terms)

It’s simple as it gets: 
# People share impressions of books 
# and their contents in a subject 
# organize these books together, 
# not only to cover the subject, but 
# to create a kind of hierarchy 
# of the very way you have to go through 
# if you really want to get to know the subject.

For instance, lets say one would like to understand the concept of Modernism. In order to do so, one  goes to the wikibooks page of Modernism. One finds there relevant reference books concerning epochs, which precede the epoch of Modernism (eg. Craske, M. (1997) Art in Europe 1700-1830: A History of the Visual Arts in an Era of Unprecedented Urban Economic Growth, Oxford Paperbacks.) This might serve as a recommended preliminary reading, that prepares one to grasp the concept of Modernism in a particular context, which, in this case, is Modernism of art. That book is followed by another one (eg. Brettel, R.  (1999) Modern Art 1851-1929: Capitalism and Representation, Oxford Paperbacks ). Note that these are only examples! The whole referencing system should not be that linear. These books cover Modernism only in terms of visual arts, which is essential, but still not that comprehensive. 

Moreover, this page should provide one with the best resources. For instance, given that Craske’s book is thorough enough so that one could get the necessary preparation for their study on Modernism of Visual Arts, there should be no need to flood the page with hunderts of other references. If that is not the case, then other more exhaustive books should be recommended.( Of course, such referencing hierarchy should be organized according to different levels of interest. In this way separate sub-hierachies are formed, which might be labelled “easy, medium and hard”. That is how the referencing system would be appropriate for deeply interested as well as for people who need just a quick dive in the subject. Note that it is important where these books are available! Everyone knows that a good study will often send you miles away from home just to get to read some 20 pages from a book only available in some National Library for instance.)

To get back on the track: My idea is to have books and articles classified according to their main subject and a recommended order to read them.

In other words, my idea is to link the knowledge of world with the right approach to it. (offer an inovative strategy for efficient and independent acquirement of knowledge)
Since this literary means to create an information stream, which does not exist in the digital world yet, it still remains to be discussed, which is the best possible way to sort out that information. 

A comment next to books &quot;what is this book to cover from the subject&quot;, “this book will give you a view of...” should make it easy to exclude the less needed books for understanding Modernism.  

It is important, that the project covers subjects in as many as possible different languages, so that as many as possible users can take advantage of it. That is how the multilingual way of studying a subject is presented.Note that studies are made in different languages, so this project might also need a way to present the &quot;multi-lungial&quot; way of studying a subject, because not all studies can be made only in english or in german or in french, most of the good studies include multi-lingual sources. That is not to say that it is needed to sepparate these wikipage's like in wikipedias way in different languages, but to create as I said the multy-lingual/babylonian page which contents all the suggested works in original(german, russian, ect)and then to separate page’s so that for instance the &quot;german way&quot; of studying the subject(for people who speak only german) is shown, which way suggests not the originals of the books(lets say originals that are in Russian), but the translations of these originals(if they exist) concerning the subject. So to speak there is no german equivalent of Modern Art 1851-1929 Capitalism and Representation, so you should either read it in english or suggest a german book that covers some or most of the content.

To generalize: 
The multy-lingual/babylonian page shows you all the books in different languages.
The german page shows you the books in german and the translations in german from the other languages.
There also may be a german/russian/hindu page, that is to say an option to exclude all books which are in languages you can not read.
Next, one must be provided with information where to find the needed book. For that purpose, a link to a online resourse/a bookshop/ a library must be presented. 
One more thing: This linkage system can be a good adviser for fiction. For instance: If you want to actualy read Modernism try Thomas Mann, if you liked him than read Hermann Hesse as well. If you want to get serious about them you can try reading C.G. Jung or a lecture about Hermann Hesse and Religion, ect ect.

I am posting my proposal here, since I contacted Wiki and they re-directed me.As far as the name of the concept is concerned,  Wikibooks sounds like a realy nice name for this concept, although not the only one appropriate. WikiStudy or WikiBookLink would work as well. &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Ivan Gospodinov|Ivan Gospodinov]] ([[User talk:Ivan Gospodinov|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ivan Gospodinov|contribs]]) 16:44, 21 January 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

: I think most books already describe what is or will be covered. Every book should already have a table of contents with chapters and pages listed in the order to be read. I think any books with [[Template:Prerequisite|prerequisites]] already mention them.  I think most of our books don't have any specific prerequisites though, because they try to cover the entire subject starting from the beginning for beginners. If there was a book about Modernism in Art for example, it would likely discuss art and art techniques from 1800 through 2011 that is of significants to Artists. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:29, 22 January 2011 (UTC)

I don't know if its just me, but I think there are millions of books who are not worth reading.

In this lesson you will view the trigonometric ratios of angles of rotation around the coordinate grid as a continuous, circular function. The connection will be made between how the ratios change as the angle of rotation increases or decreases, and how the graph of the function depicts that change.

==Learning Objectives==
* Identify the 6 basic trigonometric ratios as continuous functions of the angle of rotation around the origin.
* Identify the domain and range of the six basic trigonometric functions.
* Identify the radian and degree measure, as well as the coordinates of points on the unit circle for the quadrant angles, and those with reference angles of 30°, 45°, and 60°.

==''y'' = sin(''x''), The Sine Graph==
By now, you have become very familiar with the specific values of sine, cosine, and tangents for certain angles of rotation around the coordinate grid. In mathematics, we can often learn a lot by looking at how one quantity changes as we consistently vary another. In this case, what will happen to the value of, let's say, the sine of the angle as we gradually rotate around the coordinate grid. We would be looking at the sine value as a function of the angle of rotation around the coordinate grid. We refer to any such function as a circular function, because they can be defined using the unit circle. First of all, you may recall from earlier sections that the sine of an angle in standard position in the coordinate grid is the ratio of &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{y}{r}&lt;/math&gt;, where ''y'' is the ''y''-coordinate of any point on the angle and ''r'' is the distance from the origin to that point.

:[[File:Circular Functions of Real Numbers Figure 1.svg|500px]]

Because the ratios are the same for a given angle, regardless of the length of the radius ''r'', we can use the '''unit circle''' to make things a little more convenient.

:[[File:Circular Functions of Real Numbers Figure 2.svg|500px]]

The denominator is now 1, so we have the simpler expression sin(''θ'') = ''y''.  The advantage to this is that we can use the ''y''-coordinate of the point on the unit circle to trace the value of sin(''θ'') through a complete rotation. Imagine if we start at 0 and then rotate counter-clockwise through gradually increasing angles. Since the ''y''-coordinate is the sine value, watch the height of the point as you rotate.

Through Quadrant I that height gets larger, starting at 0, increasing quickly at first, then slower until the angle reaches 90°, at which point, the height is at its maximum value, 1.

:[[File:Circular Functions of Real Numbers Figure 3.svg|400px]]

:[[File:Circular Functions of Real Numbers Figure 4.svg|400px]]

:[[File:Circular Functions of Real Numbers Figure 5.svg|400px]]

:[[File:Circular Functions of Real Numbers Figure 6.svg|400px]]

:[[File:Circular Functions of Real Numbers Figure 7.svg|400px]]

:[[File:Circular Functions of Real Numbers Figure 8.svg|400px]]

As you rotate into the third quadrant, the change in the height now reverses itself and starts to decrease towards 0.

:[[File:Circular Functions of Real Numbers Figure 9.svg|400px]]

:[[File:Circular Functions of Real Numbers Figure 10.svg|400px]]

:[[File:Circular Functions of Real Numbers Figure 11.svg|400px]]

When you start to rotate into the third and fourth quadrants, the length of the segment increases, but this time in a negative direction, growing to −1 at 270° and heading back toward 0 at 360°.

:[[File:Circular Functions of Real Numbers Figure 12.svg|400px]]

After one complete rotation, even though the angle continues to increase, the sine values will simply repeat themselves. The same would have been true if we chose to rotate clockwise to investigate negative angles, and this explains why the sine function is periodic. The period is 2π radians or 360°, because that is the angle measure required before the sine of the angle will simply repeat the previous sequence of values.

Let's translate this circular motion into a graph of the sine value vs. the angle of rotation. The following sequence of pictures demonstrates the connection. As the angle of rotation increases, watch the ''y''-coordinate of the point on the angle as it traces horizontally. Ignore the values along the horizontal axis at this point as they just relative. What is important is that you make the connection between the circular rotation and the change in the height of the point.

:[[File:Circular Functions of Real Numbers Figure 20.svg|500px]]

Notice that once we rotate around once, the point traces back over the same values again. The red curve that you see is one period of a sine &quot;wave&quot;.  The below animation shows this happen in &quot;real time&quot;.

:[[File:ComplexSinInATimeAxe.gif]]

Let's look at some specific values so we can graph the sine function more precisely. Since we already know what happens in between, you can draw a fairly accurate sketch by plotting the points for the quadrant angles (0, &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\pi}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, π, &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{3\pi}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, 2π).

:[[File:Circular Functions of Real Numbers Figure 25.svg|400px]]

The value of sin(''θ'') goes from 0 to 1 to 0 to −1 and back to 0. Graphed along a horizontal axis showing ''θ'', it would look like this:

:[[File:Circular Functions of Real Numbers Figure 26.svg|500px]]

Filling in the gaps in between and allowing for multiple rotations as well as negative angles results in the graph of ''y'' = sin(''x'') where ''x'' is any angle of rotation (usually expressed in radians):

:[[File:Circular Functions of Real Numbers Figure 27.svg|500px]]

As we have already mentioned, sin(''x'') has a period of 2π. You should also note that the ''y''-values never go above 1 or below −1, so the '''range''' of a sine wave is {−1 ≤ ''y'' ≤ 1}. Because we can continue to spin around the circle forever, there is no restriction on the angle ''x'', so the '''domain''' of sin(''x'') is all reals.

==''y'' = cos(''x''), The Cosine Graph==
In [[../Trigonometry and Right Angles|chapter 1]], you learned that sine and cosine are very closely related. The cosine of an angle is the same as the sine of the complementary angle. So, it should not surprise you that sine and cosine waves are very similar in that they are both periodic with a period of 2π, a range from −1 to 1, and a domain of all real angles.

The cosine of an angle is the ratio of &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{x}{r}&lt;/math&gt;, so in the unit circle, the cosine is the ''x''-coordinate of the point of rotation. If we trace the x−coordinate through a rotation, you will notice the change in the distance is similar to sin(x), but cos(''x'') starts in a different place. The x−coordinate of a 0° angle is 1 and the ''x''-coordinate for 90° is 0, so the cosine value is decreasing from 1 to 0 through the 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; quadrant.

:[[File:Circular Functions of Real Numbers Figure 31.svg|400px]]

:[[File:Circular Functions of Real Numbers Figure 32.svg|400px]]

Here is a similar sequence of rotations to the one we used for sine. This time compare the ''x'' coordinate of the point of rotation with the height of the point as it traces along the horizontal.

:[[File:Circular Functions of Real Numbers Figure 40.svg|500px]]

The graph of ''y'' = cos(''x'') has a period of 2π. Just like sin(''x''), the ''x''-values never &quot;escape&quot; from the unit circle, so they stay between −1 and 1. The '''range''' of a cosine wave is also {−1 ≤ ''y'' ≤ 1}. And also just like the sine function, there is no restriction on the angle of rotation, so the '''domain''' of cos(''x'') is all reals.

==''y'' = tan(''x''), The Tangent Graph==
The graph of the tangent ratio as a function of the angle of rotation presents a few complications. First of all, the domain is no longer all real angles. As you may remember there are some angles (90° and 270°, for example) for which the tangent is not defined. As we will see in this section, the range of tan(''x'') is actually all real numbers.

The measurement of each of the six trig functions can be found by using a single segment from the unit circle, however, the remaining functions are not as obvious as sine and cosine. The name of the tangent function comes from the tangent line, which is a line that is perpendicular to the radius of a circle at a point on the circle so that the line touches the circle at exactly one, and only one, point. So, to create the tangent segment, first we draw a tangent line perpendicular to the ''x'' axis.

:[[File:Circular Functions of Real Numbers Figure 41.svg|450px]]

If we extend angle ''θ'' through the unit circle so that it intersects with the tangent line, the tangent function is defined as the length of the red segment.

:[[File:Circular Functions of Real Numbers Figure 42.svg|450px]]

The dashed segment is 1 because it is the radius of the unit circle. Recall that the tangent of ''θ'' is &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{y}{x}&lt;/math&gt;, so we can verify that this segment is indeed the tangent by using similar triangles.

:[[File:Circular Functions of Real Numbers Figure 43.svg|500px]]

:&lt;math&gt;\tan(\theta) = \frac{y}{x} = \frac{t}{1} = t&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\tan(\theta) = t\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

So, as we increase the angle of rotation, think about how this segment changes. When the angle is 0, the segment has no length. As we begin to rotate through the first quadrant, it will increase, very slowly at first.

:[[File:Circular Functions of Real Numbers Figure 44.svg|400px]]

:[[File:Circular Functions of Real Numbers Figure 45.svg|400px]]

:[[File:Circular Functions of Real Numbers Figure 46.svg|400px]]

:[[File:Circular Functions of Real Numbers Figure 47.svg|400px]]

But, you can see very soon that the value increases past one. As the angle gets closer to 90°, the segment will need to stretch quite high in order to intersect the extension of the angle and it will grow at a faster and faster rate.

:[[File:Circular Functions of Real Numbers Figure 48.svg|250px]]

:[[File:Circular Functions of Real Numbers Figure 49.svg|300px]]

As we get ''very'' close to the ''y''axis that the segment gets infinitely large, until when the angle really hits 90°, at which point the extension of the angle and the tangent line will actually be parallel and therefore never meet!

:[[File:Circular Functions of Real Numbers Figure 50.svg|400px]]

This means there is no definition for the length of the tangent segment, or as it may be helpful to think of it, the tangent segment is ''infinitely large''.

Before continuing, let's take a look at this portion of the graph through the first quadrant. The tangent starts at 0, for a 0° angle, then increases slowly at first. That increase gets much steeper and as we approach a 90° rotation.

Again, just a small break in the ''x'' axis on these graphs will make it more clear that these two concepts to note lie side-by-side on the same coordinate grid.

:[[File:Circular Functions of Real Numbers Figure 51.svg|400px]]

:[[File:Circular Functions of Real Numbers Figure 52.svg|400px]]

:[[File:Circular Functions of Real Numbers Figure 53.svg|400px]]

In fact as we get infinitely close to 90°, the tangent value increases without bound, until when we actually reach 90°, at which point the tangent is undefined. A line that a graph gets infinitely close to without touching is called an asymptote. So the tangent function has an asymptote at 90°.

:[[File:Circular Functions of Real Numbers Figure 54.svg|400px]]

As we rotate past 90°, now the intersection of the extension of the angle and the tangent line is actually below the ''x'' axis. This fits nicely with what we know about the tangent for a 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; quadrant angle being negative. It will be first be very, very negative, but as the angle rotates, the segment gets shorter, reaches 0, then crosses back into the positive numbers as the angle enters the 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; quadrant.

:[[File:Circular Functions of Real Numbers Figure 55.svg|250px]]

:[[File:Circular Functions of Real Numbers Figure 56.svg|400px]]

:[[File:Circular Functions of Real Numbers Figure 57.svg|400px]]

:[[File:Circular Functions of Real Numbers Figure 58.svg|250px]]

The segment will again get infinitely large as it approaches 270°. After being undefined at 270°, the angle crosses into the 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; quadrant and once again changes from being infinitely negative, to approaching zero as we complete a full rotation.

:[[File:Circular Functions of Real Numbers Figure 59.svg|250px]]

So, this motion graphed over several rotations would look like this:

:[[File:Tan proportional.svg|550px]]

Notice that the ''x'' axis is measured in radians (not in terms of π). Our asymptotes occur every π radians, starting at &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\pi}{2}&lt;/math&gt;. The period of the graph is therefore π radians. The domain is all reals except for the &quot;holes&quot; at &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\pi}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{3\pi}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, −&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\pi}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, etc. and the range is all real numbers.

==The Three Reciprocal Functions: cot(''x''), csc(''x''), and sec(''x'')==
===Cotangent===
Cotangent is the reciprocal of tangent, so it makes sense to generate the circular function for cotangent by drawing the tangent line at a point on the ''y'' axis and extending the angle, instead of the ''x'' axis.

:[[File:Circular Functions of Real Numbers Figure 60.svg|400px]]

We can verify that this is the case again by using similar triangles. Because the purported cotangent segment is parallel to the base of the yellow triangle, then angle ''θ'' is in the opposite corner and the triangles are indeed similar, even though their positions are reversed.

:[[File:Circular Functions of Real Numbers Figure 61.svg|500px]]

So,

:&lt;math&gt;\cot(\theta) = \frac{x}{y} = \frac{t}{1} = t&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\cot(\theta) = t\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Now that we have established the cotangent segment, think about how this segment changes as we rotate around the coordinate grid starting at 0°. First of all, at 0° itself, the cotangent is undefined because the segment is parallel to the ray of the angle ''θ''. As we begin to increase the angle of rotation, the segment will be extremely large and begin to get smaller as we approach 90°, very quickly at first, but then slowing down as it gets closer to 0 length at 90°.

:[[File:Circular Functions of Real Numbers Figure 62.svg|500px]]

:[[File:Circular Functions of Real Numbers Figure 63.svg|500px]]

After passing 90°, the segment will again start to lengthen, but this time it will be in the negative direction, increasing slowly at first, then getting infinitely large in the negative direction until 180°, at which point it is again undefined.

:[[File:Circular Functions of Real Numbers Figure 64.svg|500px]]

After passing this point, the periodic behavior kicks in and the function now repeats the same sequence of values as we rotate from 180°, back to 360°.

Tracing this motion on the graph over several rotations gives:

:[[File:Cotan proportional.svg|500px]]

Remember that cotangent and tangent are reciprocals of each other, so any point at which the tangent was equal to 0, the cotangent will be undefined and any point at which the tangent was undefined, the cotangent is equal to 0.

:[[File:Tan-cotan proportional.svg|500px]]

You might also notice that the graphs consistently intersect at 1 and −1. These are the angles that have 45° reference angles, which always have tangents and cotangents equal to 1 or −1. It makes sense that 1 and −1 are the only values for which a function and its reciprocal are the same. Keep this in mind as we look at cosecant and secant compared to their reciprocals of sine and cosine.

The cotangent function has a domain of all real angles except multiples of π {… − 2π. − π.0, π, 2π …} The range is all real numbers.

===Cosecant===
There are many ways possible to find the cosecant segment. One approach is to look at the right triangle formed by the cotangent segment and use the Pythagorean Theorem to generate the cosecant.

:[[File:Circular Functions of Real Numbers Figure 70.svg|400px]]

:{| cellpadding=&quot;3&quot; style=&quot;text-align:right;&quot;
| &lt;math&gt;a^2 + b^2 = c^2\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;1^2 + \left (\frac{x}{y}\right )^2 = c^2&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\left (\frac{y}{y}\right)^2 + \left (\frac{x}{y}\right )^2 = c^2&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\frac{y^2}{y^2} + \frac{x^2}{y^2} = c^2&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\frac{y^2 + x^2}{y^2} = c^2&lt;/math&gt;
|}

From the original triangle in the unit circle, ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

:{| cellpadding=&quot;3&quot; style=&quot;text-align:right;&quot;
| &lt;math&gt;\frac{r^2}{y^2} = c^2&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\left (\frac{r}{y} \right )^2 = c^2&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Since &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{r}{y}&lt;/math&gt; is cosecant, then the cosecant must be the same as side ''c''.

Tracing the length of this segment, it is undefined at 0°, infinitely large for very small angles, decreasing to 1 at 90° and then increasing infinitely until it is undefined at 180°. The process repeats from 180° to 360°, however, the segment starts infinitely negative, increases to −1 at 270° before approaching an infinitely negative length.

:[[File:Circular Functions of Real Numbers Figure 76.svg|400px]]

The period of the function is therefore 2π with a domain of all real angles except multiples of π {… −2π, −π, 0, π, 2π …}. The range is all real numbers greater than 1 or less than −1.

The graph then would look as follows:

:[[File:Cosec proportional.svg|500px]]

Here is the graph of ''y'' = sin(''x'') as well:

:[[File:Sin-cosec proportional.svg|500px]]

Notice again the reciprocal relationships at 0 and the asymptotes. Also look at the intersection points of the graphs at 1 and −1. Many students are reminded of parabolas when they look at the half period of the cosecant graph. While they are similar in that they each have a local minimum or maximum and they begin and end in the same direction the comparisons end there and they shouldn't be referred to as parabolic. The mathematics that defines the values, and therefore shape, of the graph is completely different from the quadratic function of a parabola.

===Secant===
Much like the relationship between sine and cosine, secant and cosecant share many similarities. The segment used to generate ''y'' = sec(''x'') is shown below:

:[[File:Circular Functions of Real Numbers Figure 77.svg|400px]]

You will be asked to demonstrate this in the exercises section. This segment is 1 unit for 0°, then grows through the first quadrant, and is undefined at 90°. It is infinitely negative shrinking down to −1 through the 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; quadrant, before lengthening back towards infinite negativity and is undefined at 270°. Translating this motion to a graph of ''y'' = sec(''x'') gives us:

:[[File:Sec proportional.svg|500px]]

Comparing it with the cosine graph:

:[[File:Cos-sec proportional.svg|500px]]

The period is 2π, the range is the same as ''y'' = csc(''x'') {''y'' : ''y'' ≥ 1 or ''y'' ≤ −1}, and the domain is all real angles except multiples of &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\pi}{2}&lt;/math&gt; {… −&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{3\pi}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, −&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\pi}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\pi}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{3\pi}{2}&lt;/math&gt; …}.

==Lesson Summary==
The six trigonometric functions defined by the ratios in a right triangle can be placed in the context of the coordinate grid by thinking of them in terms of a point (''x'', ''y'') rotating around a circle centered at the origin with a radius of one. This circle is called the '''unit circle'''. The sine of the angle of rotation is the ''y''−coordinate of the point, the cosine of the angle is the x coordinate, and the tangent is &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{y}{x}&lt;/math&gt;. The values of the other three ratios; cotangent, cosecant, and secant can also be found in terms of their reciprocal relationships, but all of these values can be constructed geometrically as various segments around the angle of rotation on the unit circle. Instead of finding isolated values, we can look at each ratio as a '''function''' of the angle of rotation. These are called '''circular functions'''. Here are the domains and ranges of the six circular trigonometric functions.

 {{Ada/Navigation}}
 __TOC__
 &lt;/noinclude&gt;
This page gives a (fairly complex) example of usage of class-wide stream related attributes {{Ada/at|Class}}'{{Ada/at|Read}}, {{Ada/at|Class}}'{{Ada/at|Write}}, {{Ada/at|Class}}'{{Ada/at|Input}}, and {{Ada/at|Class}}'{{Ada/at|Output}}.

== The problem == 

The problem we will consider is the following: suppose that two hosts communicate over a TCP connection, exchanging information about vehicles.   Each vehicle is characterized by its type (a car, a truck, a bicycle, and so on), its maximum speed (in km/h, represented by an integer number) and a set of further parameters that depend on the vehicle type.  For example, a car could have a parameter &quot;number of passengers,&quot; while a truck could have a parameter &quot;maximum load&quot; (an integer number of kg).  For the sake of simplicity we will suppose that every parameter is represented by an integer number.

The protocol used to communicate vehicle data over the wire is text-based and it is as follows

* The first octet is a character that denotes the vehicle type.  For example {{Ada/ch|c}} is for &quot;car,&quot; {{Ada/ch|t}} is for &quot;truck,&quot; {{Ada/ch|b}} is for &quot;bicycle.&quot;
* Next it comes the vehicle speed, represented as an integer number encoded as &quot;&amp;lt;len&amp;gt; i &amp;lt;value&amp;gt;&quot; where
** &amp;lt;value&amp;gt; is the speed value, expressed as a number in base 10 with &amp;lt;len&amp;gt; digits
** &amp;lt;len&amp;gt; is the length of the &amp;lt;value&amp;gt; field, expressed as a number in base 10. This field can have trailing spaces&lt;br/&gt; For example, the integer 256 would be encoded as &quot;3i256&quot;.
* The speed value is followed by the list of vehicle-specific parameter, encoded with the same format of the speed field.

We would like to use the features of Ada streams to read and write vehicle information from and to any &quot;medium&quot; (e.g., a network link, a file, a buffer in memory) and we would like to use the object-oriented features of Ada in order to simplify the introduction of a new type of vehicle.

== The solution ==

This is a sketch of the proposed solution

* We will create a hierarchy of objects to represent the vehicle types.  More precisely, we will represent each vehicle as a descendant of an abstract type (Abstract_Vehicle)
* Reading from a stream will be done via function Abstract_Vehicle'{{Ada/at|Class}}'{{Ada/at|Input}} that will work as follows
*# it reads the first octet (by using Character'{{Ada/at|Read}}) and uses it to determine the type of vehicle
*# it creates the object corresponding to the required vehicle type
*# it calls Abstract_Vehicle'{{Ada/at|Class}}'{{Ada/at|Read}} by giving to it the newly created object in order to read it from the stream
* Writing to a stream will be done via procedure Abstract_Vehicle'{{Ada/at|Class}}'{{Ada/at|Output}} that will work as follows
*# it checks the object tag and uses it to determine the first character to be written to the stream
*# it writes the first character to the stream by using Character'{{Ada/at|Write}}
*# it calls Abstract_Vehicle'{{Ada/at|Class}}'{{Ada/at|Write}} to write the object description to the stream
* We will derive a new type Int from Integer and we will define for it new procedures Int'{{Ada/at|Read}} and Int'{{Ada/at|Write}} that will read and write variables of type Int encoded in the format &quot;&amp;lt;len&amp;gt; i &amp;lt;value&amp;gt;&quot; described above
* In order to allow for the introduction of new vehicle types (maybe by dynamically loading a library at runtime),  at the step 2 of the Abstract_Vehicle'{{Ada/at|Class}}'{{Ada/at|Input}} function described we cannot use a {{Ada/kw|case}} on the character read in order to determine the type of the object to be created.  We will instead use the generic dispatching constructor provided by Ada (see {{Ada/RM2|3|9|Tagged Types and Type Extensions|par=1/2}}).  
* Since the generic dispatching constructor requires the tag of the object to be created, we must be able to determine the tag that corresponds to a given character.  We will achieve this by keeping an array of {{Ada/package|Ada|Tags}}.Tag indexed by character.  A package defining a new vehicle will &quot;register&quot; itself in the initialization part of the package (that is, the sequence of statements that follows the {{Ada/kw|begin}} in the package body, see {{Ada/RM2|7|2|Package Bodies}}) by writing the tag of the defined vehicle in the suitable position of that array.

== Implementation ==

=== Streamable types ===

The first package that we are going to analyze is a package that defines a new integer type in order to assign to it attributes {{Ada/at|Read}} and {{Ada/at|Write}} that serialize integer values according to the format described above.  The package specs are quite simple

   {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/package|Ada.Streams}};          
   
   {{Ada/kw|package}} Streamable_Types {{Ada/kw|is}}
      {{Ada/kw|use}} {{Ada/package|Ada}};
   
      {{Ada/kw|type}} Int {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}}  Integer;
      
      {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Print (Stream : {{Ada/kw|not}} {{Ada/kw|null}} {{Ada/kw|access}} {{Ada/package|Streams}}.Root_Stream_Type'{{Ada/at|Class}};
                       Item   : Int);
      
      {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Parse (Stream : {{Ada/kw|not}} {{Ada/kw|null}} {{Ada/kw|access}} {{Ada/package|Streams}}.Root_Stream_Type'{{Ada/at|Class}};
                       Item   : {{Ada/kw|out}} Int);
      
      {{Ada/kw|for}} Int'{{Ada/at|Read}} {{Ada/kw|use}} Parse;
      {{Ada/kw|for}} Int'{{Ada/at|Write}} {{Ada/kw|use}} Print;
      
      Parsing_Error : {{Ada/kw|exception}};
   {{Ada/kw|end}} Streamable_Types;

The new type is Int and the procedure assigned to attributes {{Ada/at|Read}} and {{Ada/at|Write}} are, respectively, Parse and Read.  Also the body is quite simple

   {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/package|Ada.Strings.Fixed}};

                       Item   : Int)
      {{Ada/kw|is}}

         Len      : String := Integer'Image (Value'Length);

         Buffer   : Stream_Element_Array
            (Stream_Element_Offset (Complete'First) .. Stream_Element_Offset (Complete'Last));
      {{Ada/kw|begin}}
         {{Ada/kw|for}} I {{Ada/kw|in}} Buffer'Range {{Ada/kw|loop}}
            Buffer (I) := Stream_Element (Character'Pos (Complete (Integer (I))));
         {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|loop}};
   
         Stream.Write (Buffer);
      {{Ada/kw|end}} Print;

The body of Streamable_Types should not require any special comment.  Note how the access to the stream is done by dispatching through the primitive procedures Read and Write, allowing the package above to work with any type of stream.

=== Abstract Vehicles === 

The second package we are going to analyze is Vehicles that define an abstract tagged type Abstract_Vehicle that represents the &quot;least common denominator&quot; of all the possible vehicles.

                               Object_Tag  : Ada.Tags.Tag);
      
      {{Ada/kw|type}} Kmh {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Streamable_Types.Int;
      {{Ada/kw|type}} Kg  {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Streamable_Types.Int;

            Weight : Kg;
         {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|record}};
   {{Ada/kw|end}} Vehicles;

This package defines

* Function Input_Vehicle and procedure Output_Vehicle to be used, respectively, as class-wide input and output procedures
* Abstract constructor &quot;Constructor&quot; that every non-abstract type derived by Vehicle must override. This constructor will be called by Generic_Dispatching_Constructor in the body.
* Procedure Register_Name that associates a vehicle &quot;name&quot; (represented by a character in this simplified case) to the corresponding type (represented by its Tag).  In the typical case this procedure will be called by the package that derives from Abstract_Vehicle in the body initialization part

The body of the package is


   {{Ada/kw|with}} Ada.Tags.Generic_Dispatching_Constructor;
   
   {{Ada/kw|package}} body Vehicles {{Ada/kw|is}}

               Character'Write (Stream, Name);
               Abstract_Vehicle'Class'Write (Stream, Item);
              
               {{Ada/--|We did our duty, we can go back}}
               {{Ada/kw|return}};
            {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|if}};
         {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|loop}};
   
         {{Ada/--|Note: If we arrive here, we did not find the tag of}}

      {{Ada/kw|end}} Output_Vehicle;
   
   
      {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Register_Name (Name        : Character;
                               Object_Tag  : Ada.Tags.Tag)
      {{Ada/kw|is}}
      {{Ada/kw|begin}}
         Name_To_Tag (Name) := Object_Tag;
      {{Ada/kw|end}} Register_Name;
   
   {{Ada/kw|end}} Vehicles;

Note the behavior of Input_Vehicle, the function that will play the role of class-wide input.  

# First  it reads the character associated to the next vehicle in the stream by using the stream-related function Character'Read.  
# Successively it uses the character read to find the tags of the object to be created
# It creates the object by calling the specialized version of Generic_Dispatching_Constructor
# It &quot;fills&quot; the newly created object by calling the class-wide Read that will take care of calling the Read associated to the newly created object

Procedure Output_Vehicle is much simpler than Input_Vehicle since it does not need to use the  Generic_Dispatching_Constructor.  Just note the call to Abstract_Vehicle'Class'Write that in turn will call the Write function associated to the actual type of Item.

Finally, note that Abstract_Vehicle does not define the Read and Write attributes.  Therefore, Ada will use their default implementation.  For example, Abstract_Vehicle'Read will read the two Streamable_Types.Int value Speed and Weight by calling twice the procedure Streamable_Types.Int'Read.  A similar remark apply to Abstract_Vehicle'Write.

=== Non-Abstract Vehicles ===

==== Car ====

The first non-abstract type derived from Abstract_Vehicle that we consider represents a car.  In order to make the example a bit more rich,  Car will be derived from an intermediate abstract type representing an engine-based vehicle.  All engine-based vehicles will have a field representing the power of the engine (still an integer value, for the sake of simplicity).  The spec file is as follows 

   {{Ada/kw|package}} Vehicles.Engine_Based {{Ada/kw|is}}
      {{Ada/kw|type}} Abstract_Engine_Based {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|abstract}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Abstract_Vehicle {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/kw|private}};
   {{Ada/kw|private}}
      {{Ada/kw|type}} Abstract_Engine_Based {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|abstract}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Abstract_Vehicle {{Ada/kw|with}}
         {{Ada/kw|record}}
            Power : Streamable_Types.Int;
         {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|record}};
   {{Ada/kw|end}} Vehicles.Engine_Based;

Note that also in this case we did not define any Read or Write procedure. Therefore, for example, Abstract_Engine_Based'Read will first call Streamable_Types.Int twice to read Speed and Weight (inherited from Abstract_Vehicle) from the stream, then it will call Streamable_Types.Int another time to read Power.

Note also that Abstract_Engine_Based does not override the abstract function Constructor of Abstract_Vehicle.  This is not necessary since Abstract_Engine_Based is  abstract.

The spec file of the package that defines the Car type is as follows


  {{Ada/kw|package}} Vehicles.Engine_Based.Auto {{Ada/kw|is}}
     {{Ada/kw|use}} Ada.Streams;
  
     {{Ada/kw|type}} Car {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Abstract_Engine_Based {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/kw|private}};
  
     {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Parse
       (Stream : {{Ada/kw|not}} {{Ada/kw|null}} {{Ada/kw|access}} Root_Stream_Type'Class;
        Item   : {{Ada/kw|out}} Car);
  
     {{Ada/kw|for}} Car'Read {{Ada/kw|use}} Parse;
  {{Ada/kw|private}}
     {{Ada/kw|type}} Car {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Abstract_Engine_Based {{Ada/kw|with}}
        {{Ada/kw|record}}
           Cilinders : Streamable_Types.Int;
        {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|record}};
  
     {{Ada/kw|overriding}}
     {{Ada/kw|function}} Constructor
       (Param : {{Ada/kw|not}} {{Ada/kw|null}} {{Ada/kw|access}} Parameter_Record)
        {{Ada/kw|return}} Car;
  {{Ada/kw|end}} Vehicles.Engine_Based.Auto;

No special remarks are needed about the spec file. Just note that Car defines a special Read procedure and that it overrides Construct, as required since Car is not abstract.

   {{Ada/kw|package}} {{Ada/kw|body}} Vehicles.Engine_Based.Auto {{Ada/kw|is}}
   
      
   
      {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Parse
        (Stream : {{Ada/kw|not}} {{Ada/kw|null}} {{Ada/kw|access}} Root_Stream_Type'Class;
         Item   : {{Ada/kw|out}} Car)
      {{Ada/kw|is}}
      {{Ada/kw|begin}}
         Abstract_Engine_Based'Read (Stream, Abstract_Engine_Based (Item));
         Streamable_Types.Int'Read (Stream, Item.Cilinders);
      {{Ada/kw|end}} Parse;
   
     
   
      {{Ada/kw|overriding}} {{Ada/kw|function}} Constructor
        (Param : {{Ada/kw|not}} {{Ada/kw|null}} {{Ada/kw|access}} Parameter_Record)
         {{Ada/kw|return}} Car
      {{Ada/kw|is}}
         Result : Car;
         {{Ada/kw|pragma}} Warnings(Off, Result);
      {{Ada/kw|begin}}
         {{Ada/kw|return}} Result;
      {{Ada/kw|end}} Constructor;
   {{Ada/kw|begin}}
      Register_Name('c', Car'Tag);
   {{Ada/kw|end}} Vehicles.Engine_Based.Auto;

The body of Vehicles.Engine_Based.Auto is quite simple too, just note that

* Procedure Parse (used as Car'Read) first calls Abstract_Engine_Based'Read to &quot;fill&quot; the part inherited from Abstract_Engine_Based, then it calls Streamable_Types.Int'Read to read the number of cylinders.  Incidentally, note that this is equivalent to the default behavior, so it was not really necessary to define Parse.  We did it just to make an example.
* Note the call to Register_Name in the body initialization part that associates the name 'c' with the tag of type Car (obtained via the attribute 'Tag).  An interesting property of this solution is that the information about the &quot;external name&quot; 'c' of objects of type Car is knew only inside the package Vehicles.Engine_Based.Auto.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Length operator ==

The hash symbol acts as a unary [[/length operator/]].

=== Length of a string ===

When used against a [[/string/]], the [[/length operator/]] returns the number of [[/byte/]]s within the [[/string/]].

=== Length of a table ===

When used against a[[/table/]] that is not [[/sparse/]], the [[/length operator/]] returns the number of the last non [[/null/]] element in the [[/table/]]. For an [[/empty/]] table, a value of [[/zero/]] will be returned:

==== Sparse tables ====

Note that if a [[/table/]] contains [[/hole/]]s, the [[/length operator/]] considers the first [[/null/]] element to be the end of the [[/table/]], and will return the [[/element/]] number that immediately precedes the [[/null/]] element.

A selection of clinical applications of Digital Radiography are described in this chapter.  General Radiography, being one of the mainstays of Diagnostic Radiography, has changed from a film-based imaging process to one based on digital technologies.  The impact of these changes in terms of radiation dose and image quality are discussed in this chapter.  Specialised applications such as Mammography, Digital Subtraction Angiography, C-Arm Computed Tomography, Multi-Detector CT, Dual-Energy Radiography and Image Fusion are also considered.

== General Radiography ==

Digital image receptors have been increasingly applied in general radiography since the turn of the century.  Early studies indicated its superior image quality relative to film/screen technology in skeletal radiography&lt;ref&gt;&lt;small&gt;Hamers S, Freyschmidt J &amp; Neitzel U, 2001. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11511898 Digital radiography with a large-scale electronic flat-panel detector vs. screen-film radiography: Observer preference in clinical skeletal diagnostics]. Eur Radiol, 11:1753-9.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;small&gt;Peer S, Neitzel U, Giacomuzzi SM, Pechlaner S, Künzel KH, Peer R, Gassner E, Steingruber I, Gaber O &amp; Jaschke W, 2002. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12014869 Direct digital radiography versus storage phosphor radiography in the detection of wrist fractures]. Clin Radiol, 57:258-62.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.  On this basis, refinements of exposure technique have also occurred&lt;ref&gt;&lt;small&gt;Uffmann M, Schaefer-Prokop C, Neitzel U, Weber M, Herold CJ &amp; Prokop M, 2004.

Radiology, 237:691-700.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.  Furthermore, dose comparisons with traditional radiography and various forms of Computed Radiography (CR) with direct and indirect Digital Radiography (DR) have been made&lt;ref&gt;&lt;small&gt;Bacher K, Smeets P, Bonnarens K, De Hauwere A &amp; Verstraete K, Thierens H, 2003. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14500203 Dose reduction in patients undergoing chest imaging: Digital amorphous silicon flat-panel detector radiography versus conventional film-screen radiography and phosphor-based computed radiography].  Am J Roentgenol, 181:923-9&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;small&gt;Völk M, Hamer OW, Feuerbach S &amp; Strotzer M, 2004. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14968260 Dose reduction in skeletal and chest radiography using a large-area flat- panel detector based on amorphous silicon and thallium-doped cesium iodide: Technical background, basic image quality parameters, and review of the literature]. Eur Radiol, 14:827-34.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;small&gt;Bacher K, Smeets P, Ver- eecken L, De Hauwere A, Duyck P, De Man R, Verstraete K &amp; Thierens H, 2006.  [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16928923 Image quality and radiation dose on digital chest imaging: Comparison of amorphous silicon and amorphous selenium flat-panel systems].  Am J Roentgenol, 187:630-7.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.  In addition, the performance of digital image receptors for fluoroscopic applications has also been investigated&lt;ref&gt;&lt;small&gt;Davies AG, Cowen AR, Kengyelics SM, Moore J &amp; Sivananthan MU, 2007.  [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17115166 Do flat detector cardiac X-ray systems convey advantages over image-intensifier-based systems? Study comparing X-ray dose and image quality]. Eur Radiol, 17:1787-94.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.

Results of these investigations have indicated significant advantages in favour of the digital technology.  In general, the change in image receptors has been technically similar to the transition from film-based to [[W:Digital_camera|digital cameras]] in photography.  However, work practice changes and capital cost are major considerations with the implementation of digital radiography&lt;ref&gt;&lt;small&gt;Stadlbauer A, Salomonowitz E, Radlbauer R, Salomonowitz G &amp; Lomoschitz F, 2010. A SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) analysis of current digital radiography systems for thorax- and skeletal diagnostics. [http://www.thieme.de/fz/gesqm.html Gesundheitsökonomie &amp; Qualitätsmanagement], 15:199-207.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.

Experience to the year 2010 has indicated that from a physics perspective&lt;ref&gt;&lt;small&gt;Schaefer-Prokop C, Neitzel U, Venema HW, Uffmann M &amp; Prokop M, 2008. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18431577 Digital chest radiography: An update on modern technology, dose containment and control of image quality]. Eur Radiol, 18:1818-30.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;small&gt;Schaefer-Prokop CM, De Boo DW, Uffmann M &amp; Prokop M, 2009. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19695809 DR and CR: Recent advances in technology]. Eur J Radiol, 72:194-201.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;:

::*Standard CR plates provide no dose reduction relative to traditional 400-speed film/screen systems,
::*Dual-side read-out CR has a DQE about 40–50% higher than single-side read-out CR,
::*Stuctured phosphor CR has a DQE about 50% higher than dual-side read-out CR and approaches that of indirect DR, 
::*Indirect DR receptors with structured phosphors have a DQE about twice that of direct DR receptors at spatial frequencies below 4 LP/mm,
::*Doses with indirect, structured phosphor DR are 30–50% lower than 400-speed film/screen systems, and 
::*Dose savings are limited for highly attenuating regions of the body (e.g. retro-cardiac and infra-diaphragmatic areas of chest radiographs), but can exceed 50% in regions of high X-ray transparency (e.g. the lung fields).

From a practical perspective, convenience has been enhanced in the clinical application of these devices by the incorporation of [[W:Wi-Fi|Wi-Fi]] connectivity between the image receptor and the digital image processor.  CR imaging cassettes, including read-out device, and DR cassettes of similar size to the traditional film/screen cassettes have also been developed.  These can therefore be used without much change in the design of patient tables, upright Bucky stands and other radiographic apparatus.

The application of DR technologies has also led the development of new imaging techniques, such as [[W:Tomosynthesis#Tomosynthesis|Digital Tomosynthesis]] and Temporal Subtraction, and to new forms of digital image processing, e.g. rib suppression in chest radiography&lt;ref&gt;&lt;small&gt;Veldkamp WJ, Kroft LJ &amp; Geleijns J, 2009. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19577393 Dose and perceived image quality in chest radiography]. Eur J Radiol. 2009 Nov;72(2):209-17.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and [[W:Computer-assisted_diagnosis|Computer-Assisted Diagnosis]] (CAD)&lt;ref&gt;&lt;small&gt;McAdams HP, Samei E, Dobbins J 3rd, Tourassi GD &amp; Ravin CE, 2006. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17114619 Recent advances in chest radiography]. Radiology. 2006 Dec;241(3):663-83.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.  These topics however are beyond the scope of our considerations here.

== Mammography ==

Mammography is a form of soft tissue imaging and the instrumentation used is designed specifically for imaging the female [[W:Breast|breast]].  Low X-ray energies are therefore required to exploit the [[Basic_Physics_of_Digital_Radiography/The_Patient#Photoelectric_Effect|Photoelectric Effect]] and thereby enhance the discrimination between different types of tissues. In addition, fine details such as microcalcifications also need to be resolved by the imaging system.  Small focal spot XRTs and high resolution image receptors are therefore required.  These specific requirements are considered in more detail below.

==== Mammography X-Ray Tubes ====

:An X-ray energy of ~20 keV is needed to generate adequate subject contrast between different tissues.  Such an energy provides discrimination between [[W:Mammary_ductal_carcinoma|infiltrating duct carcinomas]] and [[W:Adipose_tissue|fat]], for example, although with little differentiation between fat and [[W:Fibrous_tissue|fibrous tissue]]&lt;ref&gt;&lt;small&gt;Johns PC &amp; Yaffe MJ, 1987. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3039542 X-ray characterisation of normal and neoplastic breast tissues]. Phys Med Biol, 32:675-95.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[File:moAnodeSpectra.jpg|thumb|320px|center|Fig. 7.22:  X-ray energy spectra for (a) a Mo anode XRT, and (b) with the addition of 30 &amp;mu;m thickness of Mo filtration]]

:[[W:Molybdenum|Molybdenum]] (Mo) can be used instead of tungsten as the anode material in the [[Basic_Physics_of_Digital_Radiography/The_Source#X-Ray_Tube|X-ray tube]] (XRT).  The Mo energy spectrum consists of K-Characteristic lines between 17 and 19 keV and a Bremsstrahlung continuum - see Figure 7.22.  The Bremsstrahlung can be attenuated using an added Mo filter which preferentially eliminates the low energy radiation, that would otherwise be completely absorbed by the tissues and contribute little to image formation, as well as higher energy X-rays which would otherwise degrade subject contrast. This is an example of the application of [[Basic_Physics_of_Digital_Radiography/The_Source#Beam_Filtration|K-edge filtration]].

:[[W:|Rhodium]] (Rh) can also be used for both the anode and the filter materials. Rh has a K-edge at 23.2 keV, which is a little above that of Mo, and this can offer advantages for imaging the thicker, denser breast at a lower absorbed dose than with the Mo anodes.  This results because of the superior penetration of the Rh K-shell characteristic X-rays.  Other anode/filter combinations, such as Mo/Rh, W/Ag and W/Rh have also been used.

:Most X-ray tubes used for contact mammography have small focal spots (e.g. 0.3 mm) which are less than half the size used in general radiography. Such small focal spots are needed to image fine detail such as [[W:Microcalcification|microcalcifications]], that may be no larger than 100 μm. The resultant heating of the XRT anode can limit tube currents to a maximum of no more than ~100 mA at 25 kV so that long exposure times up to 3 seconds or more are needed to compensate. Patient movement therefore needs to be suppressed during the exposure.

:Mammography XRTs are generally constructed with a metal envelope, instead of the usual glass, with a thin [[W:Beryllium|beryllium]] (Be) exit port. This design has the advantage of suppressing [[Basic_Physics_of_Digital_Radiography/The_Source#Heel_Effect|extra-focal radiation]].  In addition, the tube can be constructed so that the anode-cathode axis is offset to achieve the small focal spot size - see Figure 7.23.

:Furthermore, it has been found that the focal spot should be located on a line, perpendicular to the image receptor, which contains the chest wall margin. Equally importantly, the collimator should also be adjusted to ensure that the X-ray beam intercepts the image receptor on that margin.

[[File:mammoXRT.jpg|thumb|320px|center|Fig. 7.23: A mammographic XRT with collimation and breast support.]]

==== Mammography Image Receptors ====

:An ideal imaging system for mammography would require a [[Basic_Physics_of_Digital_Radiography/The_Image#Spatial_Resolution|limiting spatial resolution]] of ~20 LP/mm or more and a dynamic range of at least 5,000:1, achieved with minimal radiation dose to the patient. A matrix size of at least 9,600x7,200 pixels, each with a minimum of 12 bits depth, would be needed to achieve the required spatial resolution within a typical field of view of 18x24 cm. The computer storage required for one image would therefore be 132 Mbytes. Even at a limiting resolution of 10 LP/mm, 33 Mbytes of storage would still be needed for a single digital image.

:The major problem with applying CR technology to mammography is its spatial resolution, which is limited to less than ~5 LP/mm, with the sampling rate of 10 pixels/mm as generally used. The anticipated loss of resolution may not be a serious problem, however, because of the superior contrast and dynamic range available for post-acquisition digital image processing. Reducing the diameter of the stimulating laser beam, use of a thinner phosphor layer and dual-sided read-out CR plates&lt;ref&gt;&lt;small&gt;Rivetti S, Canossi B, Battista R, Lanconelli N, Vetruccio E, Danielli C, Borasi G &amp; Torricelli P, 2009. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19922306 Physical and clinical comparison between a screen-film system and a dual-side reading mammography-dedicated computed radiography system]. Acta Radiol, 50:1109-18.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; are three approaches which can be used to address this issue.

:Both direct and indirect DR receptors can be used for Digital Mammography.  Here, the manufacturing technology limits pixel size to about 70-100 &amp;mu;m for image sizes up to 3,328x4,096 pixels of area up to 24x29 cm.  Once again, it is assumed that the lack of spatial resolution is compensated by the broad dynamic range of the image receptor as well as the spatial frequency and contrast enhancement capabilities of digital image processing.

:Another technique for obtaining a digital image involves coupling a conventional phosphor screen to a [[W:Charge-coupled_device|Charge Coupled Device]] (CCD) using lenses or fibre optic coupling. The CCD matrix can be just 1,024x1,024 pixels in small field applications and systems have demonstrated limiting spatial resolutions of ~10 LP/mm.  Larger fields of view can be achieved using an array of CCDs - see Figure 7.24, panel (a).  When individual pixels are of size 40 μm and a detector area of 18x24 cm, an image matrix of 4,800x6,400 pixels results, which can provide a spatial resolution of 12.5 LP/mm.  Broader area receptors have also found application in General Radiography, and digital implementation of Multiple Beam Equalization Radiography ('''AMBER''') has been investigated&lt;ref&gt;&lt;small&gt;Liu X, Shaw CC, Lai CJ, Wang T, 2011.

:Another alternative is to use a slot scanning arrangement - see Figure 7.24, panel (b). Here, X-rays transmitted through the compressed breast produce light in a strip of CsI:Tl phosphor and this light is collected by the fibre optics and conveyed to the CCD arrays. Some features of this design are:

::*the X-ray beam is collimated to a fan of narrow width (e.g. 22 x 1 cm), giving high level of scatter rejection,
::*the phosphor is coupled to a number of discrete CCD arrays abutted together to form a linear array. Each CCD array has 2,048x400 pixels of sufficiently small size that the system achieves a spatial resolution of 10 LP/mm or greater,
::*the image is acquired line by line by scanning the fan-shaped X-ray beam across the breast at a constant speed - see Figure 7.25. This form of image acquisition is analogous to the '''Scanned Projection Radiography''' image, also called ''Scout View'', used in Computed Tomography (CT) scanning,
::*Image acquisition time is 5 seconds, and
::*Since the X-ray field-of-view and phosphor detector are relatively small, scatter does not represent a serious problem and grids do not need to be used - which represents a potential dose saving for patients.

[[File:mammoScanningSlot.jpg|thumb|320px|center|Fig. 7.25: Illustration of scanned-slot digital mammography.]]

:One of the disadvantages of the scanning slot approach is the necessity for long exposure times which increases the load on the X-ray tube.  This can be addressed using a tungsten anode XRT, which has a substantially greater efficiency for X-ray production and heat dissipation than a tube with a molybdenum anode. The tube can operated between 20 and 45 kV with a choice of Al, Mo or Rh filters. This may seem counterproductive given the [[Basic_Physics_of_Digital_Radiography/The_Applications#Mammography_X-Ray_Tubes|earlier discussion]] on the importance of using low kV in order to achieve high subject contrast. However, the detector has a dynamic range of 5,000:1 so that, while subject contrast is reduced, high image contrast can nevertheless be achieved.

:Scanning systems have also been developed based on photon counting detectors, e.g. crystalline silicon X-ray detectors and multichannel gaseous ionisation chambers.  These have the advantage that they detect each X-ray photon absorption event in the detector, instead of integrating the image signal generated by multiple photons as occurs with conventional image receptors.  Image noise can therefore be suppressed using thresholding techniques.  

:The performance of five imaging systems for Digital Mammography is compared in Lazzari et al. (2007)&lt;ref&gt;&lt;small&gt;Lazzari B, Belli G, Gori C &amp; Rosselli Del Turco M, 2007.

A higher DQE for direct over indirect DR image receptors was found, and both were superior to a scanning-slot system. Further, the application of digital tomosynthesis to mammography, called '''Digital Breast Tomosynthesis''' (DBT), has been investigated&lt;ref&gt;&lt;small&gt;Gennaro G, Toledano A, di Maggio C, Baldan E, Bezzon E, La Grassa M, Pescarini L, Polico I, Proietti A, Toffoli A &amp; Muzzio PC.

==== Mammography AEC ====

:Unlike the AEC in conventional radiography, the controlling detector cannot be placed in front of a CR imaging cassette because it would attenuate the X-ray beam too severely and cast its own X-ray shadow. The shadow is significant especially at the low X-ray energies used in mammography.  However, when it is placed behind the cassette, the amount of X-ray flux reaching the controlling detector is strongly influenced by absorption in the image receptor, which in itself is strongly dependent on the energy of the X-ray photons emerging from the patient. The net result is that conventional AEC devices compensate very poorly for changes in breast type, thickness and kilo-voltage. These problems can be overcome,however, using microprocessor-controlled HV generator switching. The AEC detector measures the instantaneous dose-rate and, based on the selected kV and/or the measured breast thickness, terminates the exposure at the appropriate time using a look-up table (LUT). There can be a separate LUT set up for each operational mode, e.g. contact mammography with a grid, contact without a grid and magnified imaging.

:The function of an AEC can be expanded using the '''Auto-kV''' mode of operation. The control system quickly decides, within ~10-30 ms of exposure initiation, whether the selected kV is going to allow the desired image quality to be achieved in a sufficiently short time. If not, the kV can be increased appropriately to ensure that the exposure time limit, dictated by the [[Basic_Physics_of_Digital_Radiography/The_Source#TLC|tube loading]], is not exceeded.

Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 5116: 711-5.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.

==== Mammography Scatter Reduction ====

:Compression of the breast tissues is critical for:

::*[[Basic_Physics_of_Digital_Radiography/The_Patient#Scatter_Reduction|reducing scattered radiation]] that would otherwise reduce subject contrast,
::*improving contrast by decreasing the amount of [[Basic_Physics_of_Digital_Radiography/The_Source#Beam_Filtration|beam hardening]] that occurs as the X-ray beam passes through the tissues,
::*immobilising the breast,
::*locating breast structure closer to the imaging plane,
::*producing a more uniform breast thickness, and
::*reducing absorbed dose through the use of reduced exposure times. 

:Compression pads can be made from a thin plate of polycarbonate or perspex. Their design is such that creeping of breast tissue up the chest wall is prevented when the breast is being compressed.

:In addition, grids are used to further reduce scattered radiation and improve subject contrast. They are typically moving grids made with a carbon fibre interspace, although other designs are also in use, e.g. honeycomb grids with copper as the attenuator and air as the interspace material.  [[Basic_Physics_of_Digital_Radiography/The_Patient#BuckyF|Bucky Factors]] are typically 2-2.5 for grid ratios of 4:1 or 5:1.

:Adequate subject contrast is generally achieved with kilo-voltages less than 28 kV, and even lower (e.g. 23 kV) for thinner breast thicknesses.

==== Magnification Mammography ====

[[File:mammoLoRad.jpg|thumb|Fig. 7.26: Photograph of a mammography system.]]

:[[Basic_Physics_of_Digital_Radiography/The_Patient#Imaging_Geometry|Magnification]] mammography with m = 1.5-2.0 is widely used in follow-up studies where lesion localization techniques might be necessary. There are several technical advantages associated with magnification radiography, which include: 

::*improved spatial resolution of the recording system,
::*reduction of image noise arising from the structural components of the image receptor, and
::*reduction of scatter because of the air gap (e.g. 15-30 cm), particularly in coned down magnification studies.

:Note that these advantages are achieved at the expense of increased radiation dose to the part of the breast in the primary beam because of a consequent requirement to position the breast closer to the X-ray tube in many clinical systems - see Figure 7.26, for example.

:In addition, a focal spot as small as 0.1 mm is typically used for magnification mammography. Problems with long exposure times are significant in situations where the maximum tube current is only 15-25 mA. A compromise between patient movement and subject contrast can be reached by increasing the kilo-voltage to 30-32 kV so as to keep the exposure time within reasonable bounds. However, it should be appreciated that magnification imaging is a higher dose technique which is caused by the proximity of the breast to the focal spot, so that an increase in the skin dose by anything up to a factor of four results. Although this increase is partially offset by the fact that only a region of the breast is generally irradiated and a grid is not necessary for such views, the net result is an increase in absorbed dose by a factor of about two.

[[W:Stereotactic_biopsy|Stereotactic]] imaging can be used to assist core biopsy sampling using, for example, 14-[[W:Needle_gauge|gauge]] needles. Although attachments can be made to conventional mammography equipment for these procedures, superior ergonomics is provided by prone systems with the breast to be biopsied placed in a pendant position through a hole in the patient couch. The XRT, compression pad, imaging receptor and biopsy gun are all mounted below the table whose height can be adjusted to allow sufficient space for positioning the needle. The biopsy gun is typically mounted on a [[W:Vernier_scale|Vernier]] driven table that allows accurate positioning of the needle during the biopsy procedure. Images of the localized region containing the suspicious lesion in the compressed breast are generally taken with the XRT at two different locations, usually ±15° to a line perpendicular to the image plane, so to provide co-ordinate information for the computer-controlled advance of the biopsy needle.

Finally, it should be noted that [[W:Breast_cancer_screening|mammography screening]] was conducted annually in a cohort of 100,000 women from ages 40 to 55 years and biennially until 74 years at a dose of 3.7 mGy per breast examination&lt;ref&gt;&lt;small&gt;Yaffe MJ &amp; Mainprize JG, 2011. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21081671 Risk of radiation-induced breast cancer from mammographic screening]. Radiology, 258:98-105.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.  It was predicted that these exposures would ultimately induce 86 breast cancers, 11 fatal, and that 10,670 woman-years would be saved because of early detection. The risk of radiation-induced breast cancer associated with routine mammographic screening of women over 40 is therefore considered to be extremely low, especially when compared with the anticipated benefits of screening, and, as a consequence, radiation risk should not deter women from mammographic screening.

== Digital Subtraction Angiography ==

[[W:Digital_subtraction_angiography|Digital Subtraction Angiography]] (DSA), as the name implies, involves an image subtraction technique - see Figure 7.1. As will be seen below, the technique involves more than simply applying a subtraction process in the digital image processor. In addition, it will be seen that the type of technology utilised, while based on the design of fluoroscopy systems, needs to incorporate a number of modifications unique to DSA. Before addressing the technology however, some basic physics needs to be introduced which will aid in putting the subsequent technology discussion into context.

[[File:dsaImages.jpg|thumb|480px|center|Fig. 7.1: Images from a DSA study: (a) Mask Image; (b) Live Image; (c) Mask-Live Image; (d) Live-Mask Image.]]

==== Basic DSA Physics ====

:The process of subtraction angiography, as illustrated simplistically in Figure 7.2, involves the subtraction of a post-opacification image (commonly called the '''Live''' image) from a pre-opacification image of the same region (commonly called the '''Mask''' image). When it is assumed that monoenergetic X-rays irradiate the patient and that no scattered radiation is generated, the radiation intensity, I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, for an appropriate point of the live image is related to the intensity, I&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, for the same point of the mask image, by:

[[File:dsaIllustration.jpg|thumb|Fig. 7.2: Illustration of subtraction in angiography for a hypothetical blood vessel of thickness t&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;.]]

&lt;center&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = I&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; exp (-μ&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rho;&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; t&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;/center&gt;

:where μ&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;, &amp;rho;&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; and t&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; are the [[Basic_Physics_of_Digital_Radiography/The_Basics#Attenuation_of_X-Rays|mass attenuation coefficient]], concentration and thickness, respectively, of the contrast medium. Thus, when I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is subtracted directly from I&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, the subtracted image is given by:

&lt;center&gt;D = I&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; - I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;

:Thus, 
&lt;center&gt;D = I&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; - I&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; exp(-μ&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rho;&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; t&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;/center&gt;

:and, hence

&lt;center&gt;D = I&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; [1 - exp (-μ&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rho;&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; t&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;)].&lt;/center&gt;

:This equation indicates that the subtraction signal, D, contains information from the mask image I&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, as well as from the live image. As a result, the density of opacified vessels in the subtraction image will contain artifacts which are dependent on the anatomical details which underlie and overlap the blood vessels within the patient. These artifacts result because of the exponential nature of radiation attenuation in matter. They may be reduced ideally by computing the natural logarithm of the transmitted intensities prior to subtraction. When this is done the subtraction image is now dependent on the contrast medium only - with no artifacts from surrounding anatomy, as follows:

&lt;center&gt;D&lt;sub&gt;log&lt;/sub&gt; = ''ln'' I&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; - ''ln'' I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&lt;/center&gt;

:so that:

&lt;center&gt;D&lt;sub&gt;log&lt;/sub&gt; = ''ln'' I&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; - ''ln'' I&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + μ&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rho;&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; t&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

:and therefore,

&lt;center&gt;D&lt;sub&gt;log&lt;/sub&gt; = μ&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rho;&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; t&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;

:Many DSA systems utilise the above reasoning to logarithmically transform both the mask and the live images prior to subtraction. A second theoretical advantage of this logarithmic subtraction process is the generation of images which are not influenced by spatial non-uniformities of the imaging device.  [[Basic_Physics_of_Digital_Radiography/The_Image_Receptor#XII-Video_Systems|X-ray image intensifiers]], for example, display significant spatial non-uniformities.  

:A third theoretical advantage of logarithmic subtraction is the generation of images in which the image density is directly proportional to the projected thickness of the contrast medium, &amp;rho;&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;t&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;. This feature has given rise to the use of [[W:Densitometry|densitometric analysis]] of images so as to derive clinically-useful indices of function, e.g. percent [[W:Stenosis|stenosis]] and [[W:Ejection_fraction|left ventricular ejection fraction]]. However, it is important to note that the above reasoning is based on a number of simplifying assumptions (e.g. monoenergetic radiation, no scatter) which when included in the treatment above invalidate the general conclusions reached - see Figure 7.3.  Nevertheless, logarithmic subtraction is widely applied in clinical DSA. 

:Note that substantial compression of the gray scale results following direct logarithmic transformation and that multiplication of the transformed pixel values by a scaling factor is generally used to re-establish the gray scale. The term Digital Subtraction Angiography can now be appreciated to be a simplification in that to implement the technique ideally requires logarithmic transformation and multiplication as well as the subtraction of pixel values.

[[File:DlogSPRgraph.jpg|thumb|Fig. 7.3: The dependence of D&lt;sub&gt;log&lt;/sub&gt; on projected thickness for a typical range of scatter-to-primary ratios (SPR).]]

:Figure 7.3 illustrates the dependence of D&lt;sub&gt;log&lt;/sub&gt; on the [[Basic_Physics_of_Digital_Radiography/The_Basics#Attenuation_of_X-Rays|projected thickness]] of contrast medium for a range of scatter-to-primary ratios (SPRs), i.e. the ratios of the intensities of detected scattered and primary radiation. These plots were generated by including scatter contributions in the above analysis.  It is seen in the figure that D&lt;sub&gt;log&lt;/sub&gt; is reduced significantly as the SPR increases and that the dependence on projected thickness becomes non-linear.  For example, it is seen that D&lt;sub&gt;log&lt;/sub&gt; is reduced, at a projected thickness of 50 mg cm&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;, by about 85% when the SPR=5 relative to the no scatter condition, i.e. the contrast of an opacified blood vessel will be reduced by this factor.  In addition, it is seen that D&lt;sub&gt;log&lt;/sub&gt; becomes relatively independent of projected thickness, above about 20 mg cm&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; when SPR=5, for example, so that the ability to discriminate different projected thicknesses, and hence vessel opacity, is significantly impaired.

:A question relevant to this discussion relates to the SPRs that are typical of clinical imaging conditions. The following table shows measured SPRs for [[W:Chest_x-ray|chest radiography]] to illustrate the situation. It is seen, for example, that the SPR is greater than unity for all anatomical regions when no grid is employed, i.e. the scatter intensity consistently exceeds the primary intensity.  It is also seen that the greatest SPR reduction is achieved when a 12:1 grid is used. Referring now to the Figure 7.3, it can be seen that scatter reduction techniques, such as the use of an air gap or a grid are therefore likely to improve the contrast of opacified vessels and that their contrast will still be substantially reduced relative to the no scatter condition.

:Improved scatter reduction can be achieved using computerised image processing. These include methods based on estimates of scatter fields for subtraction from patient images and those based on image [[W:Deconvolution|Deconvolution]] techniques.  Scatter subtraction techniques use scatter and primary measurements to compute a smooth, slowly varying scatter field, are generally cumbersome and require at least two exposures of the anatomy.  In addition, subtracted images have a reduced dynamic range as a result of the discrete nature of digitised data as well as a reduced signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) because the subtraction process reduces the ''signal'' and maintains the noise.

:Image deconvolution techniques are based on [[Basic_Physics_of_Digital_Radiography/The_Computer#Spatial_Frequency_Processing|Spatial Filtering]] processes, where a low spatial frequency content is assumed for the scatter field, and such frequencies are suppressed in the scatter correction process.  This approach however suffers from a lack of exact knowledge of the actual spatial frequencies in a particular scatter field.

:It should be noted that scatter correction is critical to the successful application of [[Basic_Physics_of_Digital_Radiography/The_Applications#C-Arm_CT|Volume Tomography]]&lt;ref&gt;&lt;small&gt;Siewerdsen JH, Daly MJ, Bakhtiar B, Moseley DJ, Richard S, Keller H &amp; Jaffray DA, 2006.

Med Phys, 33:187-97.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.

==== DSA Image Noise ====

:The image subtraction process is highly sensitive to the presence of [[Basic_Physics_of_Digital_Radiography/The_Image#Image_Noise|noise]] in images - noise being increased by about 40%, theoretically, as a direct consequence of the subtraction process, due to the quadratic addition of noise [[W:Variance|variances]].  As a result, noise reduction techniques need to be applied in DSA imaging so as to improve the conspicuity of angiographic details.  The major sources of noise in DSA images are '''Quantum Noise''' - which results from the random nature of X-ray production and '''System Noise''' - which results from the electronic components of the imaging system. The major source of system noise in XII-based fluoroscopy, for example, is generally attributed to the video camera.

:The combined contributions from these sources can give rise to a mottled appearance of regions within the images.  An indicator of the quality of DSA images which accounts for this mottle is the [[W:Signal-to-noise_ratio|Signal- to-Noise Ratio]] (SNR) of the opacified regions of images.  Naturally, the SNR is high when high radiation exposures and high quality imaging components are used.  However, it also has a dependence on the opacity of the region being investigated in an individual examination as well as the quantity of contrast medium present.

:The SNR can be shown, when quantum noise is the dominant noise source, to be directly dependent on the concentration of the contrast medium, &amp;rho;&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;, and the square root of the absorbed dose at the XII entrance, D&lt;sub&gt;XII&lt;/sub&gt;, i.e.

&lt;center&gt;SNR  &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&amp;prop;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;   &amp;rho;&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; √D&lt;sub&gt;XII&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;

:This relationship indicates that in order to double the SNR, the concentration of contrast medium in the blood vessel can be doubled or the exposure can be quadrupled.  It is apparent that both methods involve increased risk to the patient from the procedure.

:Other factors which can be shown to beneficially influence the SNR include:

::*Equalisation of the transmittance throughout an image by placing, for instance, [[W:Bolus_(radiation_therapy)|bolus]] materials over regions of high transmittance in order to generate a roughly similar transmittance for all regions of an image.

::*Choosing an X-ray energy slightly above the [[Basic_Physics_of_Digital_Radiography/The_Patient#Tissue_Attenuation|iodine K-edge]] (i.e. above 33 keV).  As a result, images with a higher SNR are likely to result when a lower kilovoltage is used (say 65 kV rather than 100 kV), to a limit imposed by the K-edge and by the output of the X-ray tube (XRT).

:It is important to note that the above consideration assumes that quantum noise dominates the noise contributed by sources from within the imaging system. This condition can be satisfied directly only by using high quality imaging components. It should also be noted that, when the system noise dominates the quantum noise (as in, for example, a fluoroscopy system with a noisy or defective video camera), increases in radiation exposure are unlikely to decrease the noise in images.

:Image noise can also be reduced using the DSA image processor.  This is achieved by applying image averaging processes to the sequence of angiography images following computer acquisition and before subtraction. The simplest form of image averaging involves summing a number of images together and dividing by that number. It can be shown, based on statistical considerations, that this process reduces noise ideally by a factor of √N, where N is the number of averaged images. Thus, to double the SNR, four images should be averaged.  SNR improvement can also be achieved by integrating (i.e. adding) images and by [[W:Recursive_filter|recursive filtration]].  This latter process can involve the application of an [[W:Moving_average#Exponential_moving_average|exponentially-weighted moving average]] process to angiographic image sequences. It can be shown that such filtering is more powerful than simple averaging and can give a theoretical SNR improvement of √(2N-1).  Note that this type of filtering can also be applied for screening exposures providing what is sometimes referred to as '''Fluoro Noise Reduction''' (FNR).  Digital noise reduction techniques are generally performed using the [[Basic_Physics_of_Digital_Radiography/The_Computer#Digital_Image_Processor|Image ALU]] component of the DSA image processor.

[[File:VascTrace.jpg|thumb|150px|&lt;small&gt;Fig. 7.4: DSA image obtained by integration of eight images for both mask and live images before subtraction.&lt;/small&gt;]]

:The temporal-averaging feature of digital noise reduction can also be used for image presentation purposes so that the time course of the movement of contrast medium during a study can be displayed using just one image - see an example in Figure 7.4 from the [[W:Peripheral_arteries|peripheral]] study shown above - instead of a sequence of numerous images.  Such an image is sometimes referred to as a '''Vascular Trace'''.

:Conventional DSA imaging can be considered to be a subset of a generalised form of image processing which is referred to as '''Temporal Filtration'''. This general approach is directed at the processing of images with respect to time so as to eliminate features which, for instance, are common to all acquired images and to enhance features which change during the time course of the image sequence. In addition, the concept indicates that image subtraction is just one mechanism, from a family of possible mechanisms, which can achieve the desired result. One disadvantage of conventional DSA, for instance, is the amount of patient dose that does not contribute to the production of a diagnostic image. At the extreme, consider a DSA image sequence that involves the acquisition of 25 images and assume that only two of these images are used to generate an image showing the blood vessels of interest. In this case, only 8% (i.e. 2/25th) of the dose is utilised and the remaining 92% is essentially wasted. Temporal filtration of the image sequence attempts to overcome this limitation by involving more than just two of the 25 images for the digital processing involved in the generation of a diagnostic image.

:One method of temporal filtration, referred to as '''Integrated Mask-Mode DSA''' involves adding (also called integrating) a number of images, acquired prior to the arrival of the contrast medium, to form an integrated mask image and adding a number of peak-opacification images to form an integrated live image. This is the process that was used to generate the vascular trace image in Figure 7.4.  Thus, when four images are used to generate each integrated mask and live images, eight of the 25 images are now used in the subtraction process and, as a result, only 68% of the dose is wasted, and a subtraction image with lower noise results.

:A second method of temporal filtration, referred to as [[W:Matched_filter|Matched Filtration]], attempts to utilise all 25 images. It involves using information derived from the temporal variation in the concentration of contrast medium in the blood vessel of interest. This information can be obtained by using densitometric analysis software to plot the dilution curve for a region of the blood vessel, i.e. a plot of the time course of the contrast medium. This dilution curve is then used to define a range of weighting factors that are applied to each image in the sequence and the resulting images are simply added together. The processed DSA image has a relatively high SNR as a result of the integration of images. Further refinement of such filters can be used to colour-code parameters such as the time-of-arrival and the time-to-peak opacification, into the displayed image data.  Although Matched Filtration has been shown both theoretically and experimentally to generate a DSA imaging process with good image quality and dose utilisation characteristics&lt;ref&gt;&lt;small&gt;Nelson JA, Miller FJ Jr, Kruger RA, Liu PY &amp; Bateman W, 1982. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6753014 Digital subtraction angiography using a temporal bandpass filter: Initial clinical results]. Radiology, 145:309-13.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;, it has not gained widespread clinical application.

==== DSA Instrumentation ====

:DSA imaging systems are generally based on integrating fluoroscopy systems with computer technology.  We have considered the [[Basic_Physics_of_Digital_Radiography/The_Source |source of X-rays]] and [[Basic_Physics_of_Digital_Radiography/The_Image_Receptor|image receptors]] in previous chapters.  The treatment here concentrates on features of this technology which are specific to DSA.

:Figure 7.5 shows a block diagram of an imaging system used for DSA which is based on [[Basic_Physics_of_Digital_Radiography/The_Image_Receptor#XII-Video_Systems|XII-video technology]].  It is seen that images from the video camera are fed to a digital image processor for manipulation, storage and display. In order to implement a [[Basic_Physics_of_Digital_Radiography/The_Image_Receptor|pulsed exposure]] mode of operation, control connections are required between the image processor and both the video camera and the [[Basic_Physics_of_Digital_Radiography/The_Source#HV_Generator|HV generator]]. These control connections are used to instruct the HV generator to initiate each exposure pulse and to select the appropriate mode of operation of the video camera.  Systems frequently include a variable optical [[W:Aperture|aperture]] between the XII and the video camera. Note that this device is not included in the figure for reasons of clarity.

[[File:dsaXIIvideoSystem.jpg|thumb|320px|center|Fig. 7.5: Block diagram of a DSA imaging system based on XII-video technology.]]

:The intense radiation exposures used for pulsed exposure DSA generate relatively bright images at the XII output.  Since such bright XII images are likely to saturate the video camera (which typically has a high sensitivity to light), the optical aperture is generally used to control the illumination of the target of the video camera. The aperture is set wide when fluoroscopic exposures are used for patient positioning purposes and narrowed during the DSA exposures. The exact setting of the aperture is dependent on the particular examination and is generally set automatically by the digital image processor.

:High power X-ray generators and XRTs are required for DSA. Hence, generators are used which, for instance, can produce exposures up to 100 kV, 1000 mA with very short exposure times and XRTs are used which are of high heat capacity and small focal spots, e.g. 0.5 mm. The generator should also be capable of generating low, continuous exposures for catheter guidance and patient positioning purposes.

:Special-purpose video cameras are required for pulsed exposure DSA.  One factor influencing their design results from the need for low noise components, as discussed earlier.  This can be achieved using cameras with [[W:Electron_gun|electron guns]] based on diode configurations. Such designs allow relatively large electron currents to be used for scanning the target of the video camera and results in low noise images. It has been found that video cameras with SNRs of the order of [[W:Decibel|60 dB]] (1000:1) are required.

:A second factor influencing the design of video cameras for pulsed exposure DSA results from a requirement to generate images of good [[Basic_Physics_of_Digital_Radiography/The_Image#Temporal_Resolution|temporal resolution]]. Thus, the camera target should be of made from low persistence or, in other words, low lag, materials. Such a target can be obtained using lead oxide, as in the [[W:Video_camera_tube#Plumbicon|Plumbicon]] cameras.  An added advantage of using this type of target is its transfer characteristic with a gamma of unity - which is advantageous for the subsequent mathematical processing of images.

:A third factor influencing camera design is the specialised scanning mode used for reading the target with the electron beam.  Both [[W:Interlaced_video|interlaced]] and [[W:Progressive_scan|progressive]] scanning are used, as [[Basic_Physics_of_Digital_Radiography/The_Image#Temporal_Resolution|described earlier]].

:Finally, high resolution video cameras have found application in DSA.  These include 1049-line plumbicons and CCD cameras generating 1024 x 1024 x 10 bit images at up to 25 frames per second (fps) and 2099-line plumbicons generating 2048 x 2048 x 10 bit images at up to 7.5 fps.

==== DSA Image Processor ====

:A block diagram of a DSA image processor is shown in Figure 7.6.  It is seen that video signals from the XII-video image receptor are digitised using an analogue-to-digital converter (ADC) and the resulting digital data is passed through an Input Look-Up Table (ILUT) prior to storage in one of the image memories. The ILUT is generally used to logarithmically transform acquired images. It should be noted that in some system designs, logarithmic processing is performed using a look-up table between the image memory and the ALU so that displayed unsubtracted images appear in their conventional non-logarithmic format while subtracted images have the log transformation applied.

[[File:dsaImageProcessor.jpg|thumb|320px|center|Fig. 7.6: Block diagram of a DSA image processor.]]

:At least three image memories are required for routine DSA - one for each of the mask and live images and the third for the subtracted image, although most systems have the capacity for storing more than three images.  Image subtraction is performed using an arithmetic/logic unit (ALU) with the subtracted image data being fed along the Feedback Path so that it can be stored in image memory.  The ALU can also be used for averaging images for noise reduction purposes.

:The type of image processor shown in the figure can also be used to implement a number of variations on the basic theme of DSA imaging. One of these variations is referred to as '''Time- Interval-Difference''' (TID) Imaging, which involves periodically updating the contents of the mask image memory during the DSA study.  This approach allows short-term changes between images to be displayed and therefore lends itself to imaging fast moving events, such as cardiac contractions. 

:A second variation on the theme involves acquiring images of both the arterial and the venous vessels in the same region of the patient (e.g. the [[W:Carotid_arteries|carotid arteries]] and [[W:Jugular_vein|jugular veins]] in the neck) so that when a mask image in the arterial phase is subtracted from a live image from the venous phase, a subtracted image showing both arterial and venous vessels can be generated.  A third variation is referred to as '''Roadmapping''' - see Figure 7.7 - where an image at peak opacification is used as a mask and subsequent subtraction images, without injection of additional contrast medium, are used to guide advancement of a [[W:Seldinger_technique|catheter or guide-wire]].

[[File:roadmapping.jpg|thumb|center|320px|Fig. 7.7: Road Mapping: The top sequence illustrates conventional DSA highlighting the post-contrast image associated with maximum vessel opacification which becomes the roadmap mask. The lower sequences illustrate the result of subtracting live fluoroscopic images from the roadmap mask during insertion of a guidewire. The guidewire is clearly illustrated overlaid on the vasculature in direct contrast to the situation when conventional DSA is employed (see images on right).]]

:A number of image manipulations specific to DSA include:

::*'''Remasking''': This process is used to reduce motion artifacts in subtracted images which result when the patient moves between acquisition of the mask and live images - see Figure 7.8.  The process generally involves interactively choosing a more suitable mask image following image acquisition, so as to minimise the contribution of motion artifacts in the displayed DSA image.

::*'''Reregistration''': This process is also used to reduce motion artifacts in DSA images and is commonly referred to as '''Pixel Shifting'''. The process involves spatially shifting the mask image in small increments relative to the live image so that improved registration of features which are common to both images is achieved. Vertical and horizontal shifts, of the order of a fraction of a pixel, are possible under operator interaction.  An [[W:Basic_Physics_of_Digital_Radiography/The_Computer#Digital_Image_Processor|array processor]] can be used to perform the necessary calculations and image shifts at the required speeds.  Because of the complex nature of projected body movements, however, simple vertical and horizontal shifting is unlikely to remove all motion artifacts from images. However, the approach is generally useful for isolated regions within images.

::*'''Landmarking''': This process is used to provide anatomical landmarks in the subtracted images.  It is generally achieved by subtracting not the full live image, but a fraction of its intensity (e.g. 90%), from the mask image.

::*'''Spatial Enhancement''': This process is used to improve the cosmetic appearance of subtracted images so that edges of blood vessels are displayed with increased prominence (e.g. [[W:Edge_enhancement|edge enhancement]]) or sharp transitions in images are suppressed (e.g. image smoothing).  An array processor can be used to perform the necessary calculations at high speeds.

[[File:dsaMotionArtefact.jpg|thumb|Fig. 7.8: An example of motion artefact in a DSA study of the [[W:Foot|foot]].]]

::*'''Quantification''': This process is used to extract quantitative information from DSA images. The general-purpose computer with dedicated software is used for this purpose. Two general approaches have found application.  One approach is referred to as '''Geometric Analysis''' and involves measuring the number of pixels between points of interest in an image or the number of pixels within specified areas of the image. On this basis, for example, a stenotic region in a blood vessel can be referenced to a non-stenosed region of the vessel or the projected area of the left ventricle can be compared in [[W:Systole_(medicine)|systolic]] and [[W:Diastole|diastolic]] images.  In addition, following appropriate image calibration, distances can be computed in conventional units of measurement (e.g. mm or cm).  The second approach is referred to as '''Densitometric Analysis''' and involves computing the mean pixel value in opacified regions of images. Cardiac ejection fractions and stenoses, for example, can also be assessed using this approach.  Both of these approaches generally rely on accurate determination of the edges of blood vessels and cardiac chambers. For this reason, most quantification software also includes features which aid in reproducible [[W:Edge_detection|edge localisation]]. Note that both geometric and densitometric analysis can also involve significant measurement artefacts.  In the geometric case, these primarily result from the spatial distortion introduced by the imaging process.  In the densitometric case, they mainly result from contributions from scattered radiation and veiling glare - so that, as [[Basic_Physics_of_Digital_Radiography/The_Patient#Subject_Contrast|discussed earlier]], correction techniques need to be applied in situations where accurate measurements are required.

:Additional processes involve '''Bolus Chasing''', '''Rotational Angiography''' and '''Volume Tomographic Angiography'''. Bolus Chasing&lt;ref&gt;&lt;small&gt;Jurriaans E &amp; Wells IP, 1993. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8403764 Bolus chasing: A new technique in peripheral arteriography]. Clin Radiol, 48:182-5.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; has been found to be particularly helpful in peripheral angiography, for example. Here, the progress of the contrast medium is tracked automatically and used to increment the table and/or XRT/image receptor movement to the next anatomical region.  The subsequent set of subtraction images can then be used to construct a composite image of the peripheral vasculature.  In Rotational Angiography&lt;ref&gt;&lt;small&gt;Bosanac Z, Miller RJ &amp; Jain M, 1998. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9766722 Rotational digital subtraction carotid angiography: Technique and comparison with static digital subtraction angiography]. Clin Radiol, 53:682-7.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;, a [[Basic_Physics_of_Digital_Radiography/The_Basics#Radiography_Systems|C-arm assembly]], for example, can be caused to rotate at 10 - 30 degrees per second during the imaging sequence.  Subsequent dynamic display of the subtraction images can be used to generate a perceived 3D presentation so that complex relationships within the vasculature can be more readily appreciated.  Volume Tomographic Angiography&lt;ref&gt;&lt;small&gt;Anxionnat R, Bracard S, Macho J, Da Costa E, Vaillant R, Launay L, Trousset Y, Romeas R &amp; Picard L, 1998. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10048268 3D angiography. Clinical interest. First applications in interventional neuroradiology]. J Neuroradiol, 25:251-62.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; is similar to [[W:Computed_Tomography|Computed Tomography]] (CT) where the C-arm is rotated around the patient during the imaging sequence.  The image data is subject to a volume [[W:Reconstruction_algorithm|reconstruction algorithm]] which permits generation of three-dimensional images of the opacified vasculature.  We will consider this latter process in more detail below.

== Cone-Beam Computed Tomography ==

[[File:ctDegeneracy.jpg|thumb|&lt;small&gt;Fig. 7.9: The origin of image degeneracy: the attenuation of each element of tissue may be characterised by μ, the linear attenuation coefficient as in (a). The total attenuation of each of the two columns of elements in (b) is identical (ignoring unequal scattering effects) so that the image contrast is the same for quite different anatomy.&lt;/small&gt;]]

Conventional radiography is based on the attenuation of an X-ray beam by different tissues and is used to project a shadow onto an image receptor. Essentially, these images are projections of a 3-D object onto a 2-D plane. Small lesions are therefore not readily identified, image distortion results because of unequal magnification effects and since scatter contributes substantially to the image formation, low contrast masses are poorly delineated. Further, as illustrated in Figure 7.9, there is a degeneracy introduced into the image, i.e. two anatomically quite different objects may produce the same image contrast because the effective attenuation they each produce is identical. In short, there is a considerable loss of information. 

This situation can be improved using  [[W:X-ray_computed_tomography|Computed Tomography]] (CT). This was originally developed as a radiographic technique for producing cross-sectional images by scanning a slice of tissue from multiple directions using a narrow fan-shaped X-ray beam. The attenuation of each tissue element is calculated and converted to be shown as shades of grey on a display monitor. The basic principle of CT-scanning is that the internal structure of an object can be reconstructed from multiple projections of that object. [[W:Johann_Radon|Johann Radon]] established this principle, as early as 1917 and [[W:Allan_McLeod_Cormack|Allan Cormack]] published work on image reconstruction in 1963 and 1964. In the early 1970s, [[W:Godfrey_Hounsfield|Godfrey Hounsfield]] applied these concepts using computer technology and used it for diagnostic imaging&lt;ref&gt;&lt;small&gt;Kalender WA, 2006. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16790909 X-ray computed tomography]. Phys Med Biol, 51:R29-43.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;. And the rest as they say is history!

We'll start our treatment here with a consideration of the formation of an image of a single tomographic slice and then extend these concepts to describe cone-beam tomography.

==== Image Reconstruction Basics ====

[[File:ctVoxelDefinition.jpg|thumb|Fig. 7.10: Illustration of a tomographic slice represented by a large number of voxels.]]

:A cross-sectional layer called a tomographic slice of the body is obtained by dividing it into many tiny volume elements called [[W:Voxel|voxels]] - see Figure 7.10. When displayed on a computer screen, each voxel is represented in two dimensions by a pixel. The task in CT is to assign a number to each voxel that is proportional to its X-ray attenuation. This can be achieved by rotating an XRT and an array of detectors around the slice of interest to measure the radiation intensities projected at different angles around that slice.  In other words, multiple views around the slice are acquired.  An image reconstruction algorithm is then applied to this projection data to estimate the attenuation in each voxel.  The amount of attenuation for a voxel is determined by its composition and size, along with the X-ray energy, and is characterised by a parameter (which can be expressed in [[W:Hounsfield_unit|Hounsfield Units]], HU) derived from the [[Basic_Physics_of_Digital_Radiography/The_Basics#Attenuation_of_X-Rays|linear attenuation coefficient]], μ.  

:There are a number of image reconstruction methods that can be applied.  However, the one that is of interest to us is called [[W:Tomographic_reconstruction|Filtered Back Projection]] (FBP).

[[File:ctBackProjection.jpg|thumb|Fig. 7.11: Illustration of back projection - see text for details.]]

:A basic premise in back-projection is that any attenuation of the X-ray beam has occurred uniformly along the path followed from the source to the detector. Let's consider a simple tomographic slice containing just four voxels to illustrate the computational approach - see Figure 7.11.  The first projection, P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is obtained from a horizontal exposure from left to right in the figure.  The back-projection of P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; involves putting the values 7 and 9 in both elements of the first and second rows, respectively. The second projection, P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adds a 4 to the top right element, 1 to the bottom left element and 11 to the other two elements when it is back-projected.  The other projections are treated in a similar fashion. Following regularisation of the data set the final image is obtained at the bottom left of the figure.

:The representation in Figure 7.12 demonstrates the principle in action. A single projection is back-projected to give a dark stripe across the entire image plane - see panel (a). As the phantom is scanned from different angles and the projections back-projected onto the image plane from many directions, an image of the radio-opaque object begins to emerge - see panel (b). As the number of projections increases, the quality improves but there will always remain ''streaking'' as seen in panel (c). A certain amount of spurious background information remains which can severely degrade the quality of reconstructed images. In mathematical terms, the image is blurred because of a convolution with a 1/r functional dependence on distance, r. In other words, the [[W:Point_spread_function|point spread function]] (PSF) has a 1/r dependence which is totally attributable to the back projection process.

[[File:NM19_3.gif|thumb|320px|center|Fig. 7.12: Demonstration of simple back projection: (a) An X-ray tube scans a phantom, consisting of a radio-dense object in an otherwise uniform container, and generates the profile as shown for the back projection process. (b) Four profiles generated by scanning at slightly different angles around the phantom. (c) The image reconstructed from just four projections.]]

:Image quality can be improved substantially using a modified form of back-projection called Filtered Back Projection (FBP). In this technique - see Figure 7.13 - projection data is first filtered spatially to account for the effect of sudden density changes which cause the streaking in simple back-projection. The filter is referred to as a [[W:Convolution|convolution]] filter or kernel. The procedure can be performed in the spatial frequency domain using [[Basic_Physics_of_Digital_Radiography/The_Basics#The_Fourier_Transform|Fourier Transform]] (FT) methods or directly with [[Basic_Physics_of_Digital_Radiography/The_Computer#Digital_Image_Processing|spatial domain processing]]. After the convolution process, the data for each projection is inverse Fourier transformed before the back projection computation is undertaken. In practice the task of image reconstruction is performed using special array processors and dedicated hardware, which aids in speeding up the reconstruction task.

[[File:NM19_5.gif|thumb|320px|center|Fig. 7.13: Demonstration of filtered back projection: (a) An X-ray tube scans a phantom and generates the profile which is filtered using the Fourier transform. (b) Four filtered profiles generated by scanning at slightly different angles around the phantom. (c) A detailed view of the effect of the filtration process on one profile. (d) The reconstructed image is free of the star artefact.]]

[[Image:NM19_124.jpg|thumb|Fig. 7.14: A tomogram reconstructed using (a) a soft tissue filter, and (b) using a bone filter. Notice the subtle edge enhancement effect generated using the bone filter and the more smooth nature of the soft tissue filtration.]]

:A choice of filters can generally be selected to enhance either soft tissue features in the image or bone detail. Indeed, the image can be post-processed using a different filter after the scan has been completed if needed. Images can be generated to enhance bone detail or display subtle low contrast masses without the need to re-scan the patient. The filter choice therefore has a major impact on image quality. The two most common filters used in X-ray CT are those due to [[W:Gopalasamudram_Narayana_Iyer_Ramachandran|Ramachandran &amp; Lakshminarayana]] (commonly called the ''Ram-Lak'') and Shepp &amp; Logan. Viewed in spatial frequency space, the former is essentially a ramp filter with a cut off frequency and the latter combines a smoothing filter with the ramp to attenuate high frequency noise. The ramp filter compensates for the artefacts introduced by the simple back projection process but does not compensate for the increasing noise content of the data with increasing frequency. Images of an axial tomogram reconstructed with a soft tissue and with a bone algorithm can be seen in Figure 7.14.

==== C-Arm CT ====

:C-arms fluoroscopy systems can implement back-projection using images acquired at different angles around the patient&lt;ref&gt;&lt;small&gt;Kalender WA &amp; Kyriakou Y, 2007. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17587058 Flat-detector computed tomography (FD-CT)]. Eur Radiol, 17:2767-79.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;. The X- ray beam is collimated to a large cone with an XRT and image receptor rotated as one to acquire projections from a large number of slices simultaneously.  An approximate back projection reconstruction technique known as the '''Feldkamp''' algorithm is generally applied.  The result is a full 3D image acquisition in a single rotation about the patient.  [[#Multi-Detector_Computed_Tomography_.28MDCT.29|Multi-Detector CT]] (MDCT) scanners use this approach with an array of detectors (e.g. 64 rows and 800 columns) - and are sometimes referred to as Multi-Detector Row scanners.  C-arm fluoroscopy systems also use a broad-area image receptor but of much larger size, e.g. 1,920 dels in 2,480 columns.  

[[File:cArmCTgeometry.jpg|thumb|Fig. 7.15: Illustration of the geometry in C-arm CT for imaging a cylindrical phantom: (a) in the x-y plane, and (b) in the y-z plane.  The exposed volume is indicated by the shaded areas.]]

:C-arm systems can therefore acquire data simultaneously for a much larger number of projections.  A disadvantage, however, is that imaging with broad-area exposures generates a substantial amount of scattered radiation&lt;ref&gt;&lt;small&gt;Kyriakou Y &amp; Kalender WA, 2007. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17568538 X-ray scatter data for flat-panel detector CT]. Phys Med, 23:3-15.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; so that tomographic images do not have the resolving capacity for low subject contrasts that is achievable with MDCT.  Computerised scatter corrections are therefore applied to address the issue.  Another disadvantage is that the Feldkamp algorithm only performs well for small fields of view, e.g. the [[W:Head_and_neck_anatomy|head and neck]].  Its application to larger body areas involves handling truncated projections, which can be addressed using more sophisticated computational methods&lt;ref&gt;&lt;small&gt;Tang X, Hsieh J, Nilsen RA, Dutta S, Samsonov D &amp; Hagiwara A. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16467583 A three-dimensional-weighted cone beam filtered backprojection (CB-FBP) algorithm for image reconstruction in volumetric CT-helical scanning]. Phys Med Biol, 51:855-74.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.

:Similar designs have also found application in dental radiography&lt;ref&gt;&lt;small&gt;Scarfe WC &amp; Farman AG, 2008. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18805225 What is cone-beam CT and how does it work?] Dent Clin North Am, 52:707-30.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.

:The imaging geometry for C-Arm CT is illustrated in Figure 7.15.  The XRT and image receptor take images from different angles around the patient at a [[Basic_Physics_of_Digital_Radiography/The_Patient#X-Ray_Shadows|magnification]] of ~1.5.  Partial rotations of 150-200&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; have been found to be adequate - not the full 360&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; as in [[#Helical_CT|helical CT]].  In addition, rotations can be in orbital as well as oblique planes.  Rotation speeds of 30&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; per second and imaging frame rates of 7.5-10 frames per second are typically used to acquire 50 or more 2D projections.

:In neuroangiography, the data acquisition typically involves two rotational runs - one pre- and the other post-contrast injection.  The pre-contrast acquisition is called the '''Mask''' run, while the post-contrast one is called the '''Fill''' run.  The resultant 3D datasets can be subtracted (similar to DSA) to form the contrast medium data that is used for image reconstruction.  Quite detailed images of the [[W:Cerebral_circulation|cerebral vasculature]] can be generated, as illustrated in the following movies.

&lt;center&gt;

|}
&lt;/center&gt;

:3D Roadmapping can be achieved using this technology by superimposing live 2D images on top of a MIP projection of the opacified blood vessels. Sophisticated systems can be interfaced to allow guidance, for instance, for electronic surgical tools.  However, these topics are beyond the scope of this wikibook.

== Multi-Detector Computed Tomography (MDCT) ==

The evolution of MDCT from the days of '''[[W:Computerized_axial_tomography|Computerized Axial Tomography]]''' (CAT) is illustrated in Figure 7.1.5.1. Hounsfield's original parallel pencil-beam, translation-rotation scanning was improved with narrow fan-beam scanners (2nd generation) and later with broad fan-beam, rotation-rotation scanning (3rd generation). Images were acquired in the axial plane in the early [[W:EMI#Manufacturing|EMI Scanner]] designs using simultaneous acquisition of two slices of thicknesses of 8-13 mm per scan. Scan times for the head were about 5 minutes with the scanner generating non-contiguous 180° scans with the patient table incrementally stepped through the anatomical region of interest. The third generation design incorporated a curved, linear array of up to 896 detector elements (dels), each ~1 mm apart, and a fan-shaped X-ray beam which totally encompassed the patient's body.  This resulted in substantial decreases in scanning times.  The XRT and detector array were rotated around the patient at high speeds to irradiate slices of anatomy of thickness 1-10 mm. Furthermore, excellent contrast differentiation was achieved using pre- and post-patient collimation. In addition, bow-tie shaped filters, chosen to suit the body or head shape, were used to equalise exposures and to reduce patient dose in the periphery of the field of view.

&lt;center&gt;

|}
&lt;/center&gt;

A number of extensions to the 3rd generation design were developed because projections collected from opposite sides of the patient ideally generate the same projection data. In other words, half the scan data was redundant. These developments included the '''Flying Focus XRT''' where the electron beam could be switched alternately between two discrete focal spots during the acquisition of each projection. The foci were displaced from each other on the anode by half a del spacing. On this basis, the number of independent projections (or, equivalently, the number of dels), could be doubled by interleaving data from the two projections. One scanner design could increase the effective number of dels from 768 to 1,536 using this technique.

Scatter levels are relatively low in CT, given the narrow-beam geometry, compared to those in 2D projection radiography.  This feature has allowed application of densitometric analysis to assess brain perfusion&lt;ref&gt;&lt;small&gt;König M, 2003.

==== CT Image Display ====

:Following computation of the linear attenuation coefficient for each voxel in a slice using filtered back projection (FBP) reconstruction, the values are normalised to the value for water as a reference, scaled and presented as a Hounsfield Unit, HU, also called the CT-number, as follows:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;HU = 1,000. \frac{\mu_m - \mu_{\text{water}}}{\mu_{\text{water}}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

:where μ&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; and μ&lt;sub&gt;water&lt;/sub&gt; are the linear attenuation coefficients for the tissue material and for water, respectively.  The CT-number of water is therefore zero. CT-numbers for a number of tissues are shown in the table below.

:Reconstructed images can be presented on a computer screen using a grey scale.  The grey scale can be chosen to encompass all or some part of the entire range of CT-numbers by selecting a suitable window level and window width.  The window width is the range of CT-numbers selected for display and the window level is generally the central CT-number about which the window is chosen.  Typically, the highest number is assigned to white and the lowest number to black with all intervening numbers assigned intensities on a linear scale.  Air can therefore be displayed as black with cortical bone appearing relatively bright.

:Examples of image display manipulation are shown in the two figures above.  In Figure 7.15.2, the same image of a slice through a patient's liver is displayed using a relatively narrow window (high contrast) and also with a wide window.  The image with the narrower window appears noisier, but this is merely a reflection of the fact that the gray scale is spread over a narrow range of CT-numbers.  

:Figure 7.15.3 illustrates the use of a relatively narrow window to highlight pathology in the lungs.

==== Helical CT ====

[[File:ctHelicalSSP.jpg|thumb|150px|&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;Fig. 7.15.4: The slice sensitivity profile (SSP) for helical scanning as a function of pitch. An idealised rectangular SSP of width 5 mm is assumed for conventional scanning (pitch=0). SSPs are obtained by convolution of this SSP with a triangular function which accounts for the table movement and maintains a constant area under the curves.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;]]

:'''Helical scanning''', as illustrated in panel (d) of Figure 17.15.1, was developed on the basis of continuous movement of the patient table along the cephalocaudal direction (z-axis) of the scanner. Axial slices were generated through [[Basic_Physics_of_Nuclear_Medicine/X-Ray_CT_in_Nuclear_Medicine#Helical_Scanning|interpolation]] along the z-axis prior to Filtered Back-Projection (FBP) reconstruction.  Table speeds of 1-10 mm/s and complete 360° rotations were achieved in half a second or less with the fan beam collimated to 1-10 mm thick. A new scanning parameter called the '''Pitch''' was introduced, which defined the ratio of the table movement distance in a single rotation to the slice thickness. A table movement distance of 10 mm and a slice thickness of 10 mm would therefore generate a pitch of unity. Pitch values of 0.5-2 were used depending on the desired spatial resolution along the z-axis, with those less than one, e.g. 0.8, providing adequate over-lapping slices for 3D visualizations. No gaps in the data set occurred as the anatomy was being scanned, which can be contrasted with conventional axial scanning where inter-slice gaps result unless contiguous slices are specifically chosen to be scanned.

:[[File:CtAnim.gif|thumb|left|&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;Fig. 7.15.5: Animated sequence from a CT Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA) examination.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;]]

:Because of the relative motion between the patient table and the gantry, the &lt;u&gt;effective&lt;/u&gt; slice width given by the Slice Sensitivity Profile (SSP) was greater than the &lt;u&gt;nominal&lt;/u&gt; slice width because the slice profile is blurred by a convolution with a triangular profile attributable to the table motion - see Figure 7.15.4. Software advances using z-interpolation techniques were then applied to minimise this broadening of the SSP&lt;ref&gt;&lt;small&gt;Hu H, 1999. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9949393 Multi-slice helical CT: Scan and reconstruction]. Med Phys, 26:5-18.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;. '''Linear Interpolation''' could be applied, for example, to both 180&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; and 360&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; sequences from adjacent helical scans to give the so-called '''180LI''' and '''360LI''', or Slim and Wide, processing algorithms. However, regardless of the interpolation technique employed increasing the pitch led to increased effective slice widths.

:A significant reduction in examination times resulted since large sections of the anatomy could be scanned rapidly and contiguously with little influence from patient motion. For example, up to 80 slices could be scanned contiguously in 60 seconds of non-stop scanning - see an example in Figure 7.15.5. Single breathhold scanning became possible on this basis.  Furthermore, isotropic voxel dimensions, i.e. of equal size in all three axes, could be generated, instead of the rectangular-shaped voxels of single slice scanning, and reconstruction of sagittal, coronal, curved planar, off-axis and 3D images became feasible. Within the scanned volume, images could be reconstructed at arbitrary positions and spacings with slice widths controlled through collimation. One important difference was that the position and spacing of successive slices chosen for reconstruction could be made retrospectively without the need to re-scan the patient. Thin slices (e.g. &lt;3 mm) could be generated with an overlap of 80%, for instance, for the reconstruction of exquisite 3D images.

==== Multi-Slice CT ====

:[[File:ct4slice.jpg|thumb|150px|&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;Fig. 7.15.7: Illustration of 4-slice CT.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;]]

:Scanning speed increases for volume imaging subsequently generated technical advances such as multi-detector scanning (MDCT). Initially, about year 1998, four slices of thickness 0.5-10 mm were able to be scanned simultaneously using a 2D detector array with a z-axis length of 20-32 mm - see Figure 7.15.7. Scanner rotation times of half a second or less were achieved by mounting the XRT, the HV generator and the detector array on the same rotating gantry, for instance.  The speed improvements, along with reductions in tube loading, were found to result in only a modest increase in patient dose.  On this basis, techniques such as ECG-gated cardiac studies, coronary artery calcification scoring, Virtual Colonoscopy and CT Angiography (CTA) were developed.

:It should be noted that the original EMI Scanner used two pencil-beams and hence was a 2-slice scanner - and therefore could be considered to be the first multi-slice scanner.

:Algorithms for axial interpolation from helical scans were developed such as '''Multi-Slice Linear Interpolation''' (MLI), e.g. 180MLI and 360MLI, and were enhanced using z-filtration processes which applied an adaptive axial interpolation such as '''Multi-Slice Filtered Interpolation''' (MFI), e.g. 360MFI.

[[File:NM19_115.gif|thumb|150px|&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;Fig. 7.15.8: Illustration of four modes of multi-slice acquisition for a matrix array CT detector.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;]]

:The 2-D detector arrays are solid-state devices and the simplest example is the '''Matrix Array''', as illustrated in Figure 17.5.8.  The array can consist of 912 columns by 16 rows, for example, of identical dels, each 1.25 mm square, curved to fit the arc of the XRT rotation. Eight of these columns are shown, in panel (a) of the figure, being irradiated by an X-ray beam of width 6 mm, with the result that data for four 1.25 mm axial slices can be acquired simultaneously. More rows, up to sixteen in this case, can be irradiated simultaneously with this arrangement when the X-ray beam is broadened to encompass the width of the detector array. Flexibility can be built into this design by coupling the outputs of adjacent detector rows, as illustrated in panels (b), (c) and (d), where the outputs of 2, 3 and 4 rows, respectively, are summed to simultaneously generate four 2.5 mm thick slices, or four 3.75 mm slices, or four 5 mm slices.

:[[File:NM19_116.gif|thumb|left|150px|&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;Fig. 7.15.9: Illustration of an Adaptive Array CT detector.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;]]

:A more flexible design is provided by the '''Adaptive Array''' detector, as illustrated in Figure 7.15.9. Rather than columns of square detectors, this array uses columns of detectors of variable width, such that the width in the two central columns is relatively narrow, e.g. 1 mm as in the figure, with the column width increasing towards the periphery, e.g. from 1.5 mm, through 2.5 mm to 5 mm as shown in the figure.

:[[File:NM19_116a.gif|thumb|150px|&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;Fig. 7.15.10: Illustration of four modes of multi-slice acquisition for an adaptive array CT detector.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;]]

:Four modes of operation of this type of detector array are shown in Figure 7.15.10. It can be seen in panel (a) that two 0.5 mm slices can be acquired when a 1 mm thick X-ray beam is aligned with the central columns of the adaptive array. In panel (b), four 1 mm slices can be acquired using a beam of thickness 4 mm. Detector coupling is illustrated in panels (c) and (d), where the outputs of detectors in the four central columns are coupled so as to simulate two 2.5 mm wide detection columns, and hence acquire data for four 2.5 mm slices.

:A second advantage of the adaptive array is that the number of individual dels on each row can be considerably reduced, from 16 to 8 in the case we've just discussed. This adds greatly to the speed with which data can be generated by the array and reduces the number of computations necessary for uniformity and other corrections that must also be applied to the measured data.

==== Multi-Detector CT ====

:Z-axis coverage was increased and scan times reduced even further with the development of MDCT systems with, for instance, 16- (in the year 2001), 64- (in 2004), 128- (in 2005) and even 320- (in 2007) slice capabilities. Fan beam CT evolved into Cone-Beam CT on this basis, where the X- ray beam is collimated to a rectangular cone so that a rotating XRT/detector assembly can generate image data from multi-slice helical scans&lt;ref&gt;&lt;small&gt;Flohr TG, Schaller S, Stierstorfer K, Bruder H, Ohnesorge BM &amp; Schoepf UJ, 2005. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15833981 Multi-detector row CT systems and image-reconstruction techniques]. Radiology, 235:756-73.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;. Furthermore, scanner rotation speeds as quick as 0.3 seconds or less allowed 3D images of the heart to be captured in motion, at 0.25 mm slice thickness, adding a 4th dimension (4D).

:The gantry is an important design element of the CT scanner, where its rotating components are subject to the high centrifugal forces associated with very fast rotations.  Forces up to 10 G can be experienced, for example, with rotations of radius, 40 cm, and rotation speeds of less than half a second. Precise balancing is therefore needed, especially when the gantry is tilted for oblique acquisitions.

&lt;/center&gt;

:CT is acknowledged to be one of the more demanding X-ray tube applications. Most particularly, with the advent of single breathhold imaging of up to one minute, the X-ray tube and housing must be capable of quickly dissipating enormous heat loads. For example, an X-ray tube operated at 133 kVp and 250 mA for 60 seconds deposits ~2 MJ of energy in the anode. Cooling rates can be enhanced through the use of heat exchangers, for example, and software generally limits misapplication of the XRT.

:An XRT design which used liquid metal bearings to increase anode rotation speeds was introduced, but a major design breakthrough was achieved with the development of the '''Rotating Envelope XRT'''. Here, the electron beam can be focussed and deflected inside a small rotating metal tube using external electromagnets&lt;ref&gt;&lt;small&gt;Schardt P, Deuringer J, Freudenberger J, Hell E, Knüpfer W, Mattern D &amp; Schild M, 2004. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15487753 New x-ray tube performance in computed tomography by introducing the rotating envelope tube technology]. Med Phys, 31:2699-706.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;. Exceptional cooling rates have been obtained with the STRATON XRT, for example. In addition, precise control of the electron beam has allowed implementation of the Flying Focus principle in the z-direction. As a result, 64 slices of 3 mm thickness can be generated from two 32 slice, 6 mm thickness, simultaneous acquisitions, for example.  However, fewer photons reach the detector per exposure with this technique because the photons are divided between the two focal spots.

:Both pre- and post-patient collimation of the X-ray beam is generally used to reduce scattered radiation. Modern detectors can be made using strips of phosphor materials, e.g. CdWO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, Gd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and Gd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S, coupled to a-Si photodiode arrays. '''Ultra-Fast Ceramic''' (UFC) detectors are manufactured from doped gadolinium oxysulfide in the form of a polycrystalline wafer. These devices feature a relatively fast response, which improves the sampling rate, as well as high detection efficiency and broad dynamic range. Both matrix and adaptive arrays can be used in 64-slice scanners.

:A patient positioning system is typically used for the generation of accurate position data for the subsequent reconstruction process, especially during helical scanning.  This system can also allow the patient to be positioned at the isocentre of the scanner and the area of the patient for irradiation is generally indicated using laser beams.

:Forms of image reconstruction that are in clinical use include:

:::*'''Rebinning Algorithms''': These include algorithms optimized for small cone angles as in 64-slice CT, e.g. Advanced Single-Slice Rebinning ('''ASSR'''). The computation reduces three-dimensional cone-beam data to tilted 2D slices by minimizing the deviation of the reconstruction plane from the spiral for each reconstruction position. It has found application in both 16-slice and 64-slice CT scanners. The data are then sorted into angulated axial slices using filtered back projection (FBP). These oblique slices are finally interpolated to parallel axial slices. Examples are Adaptive Multi-Planar Reconstruction ('''AMPR''') and Weighted Hyperplane Reconstruction ('''WHR''') which can be implemented at relatively high speeds using dedicated hardware.
:::*'''Approximate Algorithms''': These are generally extensions of the Feldkamp algorithm for 3D filtered back-projection to multi-slice helical scanning. Parallel axial images are obtained directly from the raw projection data. Examples include the Cone-Beam Reconstruction Algorithm ('''COBRA''') algorithm and the True Cone-Beam Tomography ('''TCOT''') reconstruction and require considerable processing power to implement at high speeds.

:Most reconstruction algorithms require 180&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; projection data for reconstruction of the first and last image in helical acquisitions to ensure reconstruction of the anatomical section of interest. This process is known as '''Over-Ranging''' and it contributes to the overall patient exposure. Its contribution is relatively high when a small volume is scanned using a low pitch, e.g. inner ear examinations. Adaptive pre-patient z-collimation can be used to reduce this effect by using opposing collimator blades which automatically open at the start of the helical scan and shut at the end.

:'''Automatic Exposure Control''' (AEC) is generally implemented by modulating the mA depending on the size, shape and composition of the patient's anatomy so as to keep image noise constant through the scan. Both in-plane (xy-axis) and longitudinal (z-axis) mA modulation are used.

:Cardiac images can be acquired using 64-slice, helical MDCT scanning with slow table movements so that projection data from 180&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; gantry rotations can capture sufficient image data in both space and time, even in patients with irregular heart beats&lt;ref&gt;&lt;small&gt;Bardo DM &amp; Brown P, 2008. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19936200 Cardiac multidetector computed tomography: Basic physics of image acquisition and clinical applications]. Curr Cardiol Rev, 4:231-43.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.  '''ECG-gated''' acquisitions with a pitch of 0.15-0.25 can be used, with a consequent increase in radiation dose, although prospective-gating of acquisitions can also be used which provide reductions in patient exposure.  Scanning with a 320-slice system can be used to overcome these type of issues by direct coverage of the whole heart. Further details on cardiac CT are beyond the scope of this wikibook and the interested reader is referred to Halliburton (2009)&lt;ref&gt;&lt;small&gt;Halliburton SS, 2009.

:Finally, improvements in temporal resolution can be achieved using '''Dual-Source MDCT''' with two XRTs and two detector arrays mounted at right angles to each other in the CT gantry&lt;ref&gt;&lt;small&gt;Flohr TG, Bruder H, Stierstorfer K, Petersilka M, Schmidt B &amp; McCollough CH, 2008. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19175144 Image reconstruction and image quality evaluation for a dual source CT scanner]. Med Phys, 35:5882-97.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.

==== CT Fluoroscopy ====

:CT Fluoroscopy (CTF) has also been referred to as Continuous CT or Real-Time CT since it involves generating tomographic images at sufficiently high frame rates to allow guidance of needle placement in small or deep-seated lesions. Applications can include [[W:Biopsy|biopsy]] of thoracic lesions, biopsy/drainage of pelvic lesions, [[W:Vertebroplasty|vertebroplasty]] and drainage/aspiration of intracranial [[W:Haematoma|haematomas]]. The advantages of CTF include increased target accuracy and reduced procedure times&lt;ref&gt;&lt;small&gt;Kim GR, Hur J, Lee SM, Lee HJ, Hong YJ, Nam JE, Kim HS, Kim YJ, Choi BW, Kim TH &amp; Choe KO, 2011. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20730613 CT fluoroscopy-guided lung biopsy versus conventional CT-guided lung biopsy: A prospective controlled study to assess radiation doses and diagnostic performance]. Eur Radiol, 21:232-9.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.

:The major difference to a conventional CT system is that high speed reconstruction techniques are applied, and that an operator panel, exposure footswitch and image monitor are installed in the scanning room for use by the interventionist. Controls are generally available for table movement, gantry tilt, laser grid definition and fluoroscopic factors. The other significant operational change relates to the choice of tube current which is typically 30-50 mA in CTF. This should be compared with typical screening currents used in [[Basic_Physics_of_Digital_Radiography/The_Image_Receptor|conventional fluoroscopy]] of up to 5 mA, so that CTF can be regarded as a high dose procedure. In this context, additional beam filtration can be introduced automatically for CTF procedures to reduce patient exposure by up to 50%, for example. Furthermore, the use of protective gloves and needle holders can reduce the radiation exposure to the hands of the interventionist.

[[File:ctFluoroImages.jpg|thumb|&lt;small&gt;Fig. 7.15.11: CT Fluoroscopy images acquired at 80 kV, 56 mAs, and 5 mm slices are noisy in comparison with diagnostic images. In (a) the needle, barely in slice plane, is shown striking a rib whilst in (b) it is in the soft tissue.&lt;/small&gt;]]

:The fast reconstruction algorithm first applied for CTF used a partial (or incremental) reconstruction technique. It exploits the fact that each image in a sequence of CTF images contains a significant amount of data from previous images in that sequence, since the same slice is being scanned continuously. The image reconstruction process is as follows:

:::*raw data from the first 360&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; rotation is reconstructed by filtered back-projection and displayed;
:::*after the next N&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; of scanning has been completed, the same processing is performed and is used to update the displayed image; and
:::* the process is repeated continuously during the procedure.

:The value of N is typically 30&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;, 45&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; or 60&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;, with frame rates of 12, 8 and 6 frames per second, respectively. In the case of 60&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; updates and 6 frames per second, the delay between each image is 0.17 seconds. A Last-Image-Hold (LIH) technique can be used while the image is being updated with the resulting time lag being considered by the interventionist in terms of biopsy technique. Example images are shown in Figure 7.15.11. The display of three adjacent slices of thickness 5 mm with MDCT scanning can be used to improve visual feedback to the interventionist as the needle progresses.  In addition, [[Basic_Physics_of_Digital_Radiography/The_Computer#Multi-Planar_Reconstruction|multi-planar reconstructions]] (MPR) and volume rendered 3D images can be used to enhance fine control.

:Iterative reconstruction can also be applied for CTF to improve image quality and reduce patient exposure. Furthermore, techniques such as '''Angular Beam Modulation''' (ABM), where the X-ray beam is switched off for 120&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; during the XRT rotation proximal to the injection site, result in considerable reductions in patient dose as well as the dose to the hands of the interventionist&lt;ref&gt;&lt;small&gt;Hohl C, Suess C, Wildberger JE, Honnef D, Das M, Mühlenbruch G, Schaller A, Günther RW &amp; Mahnken AH, 2008. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18227544 Dose reduction during CT fluoroscopy: Phantom study of angular beam modulation]. Radiology, 246:519-25.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;. Lead drapes on the patient to decrease scattered radiation and mobile radiation shields can be used for additional radiation protection.

==== Iterative Reconstruction ====

:This was the method employed in the original EMI scanner but was superseded by faster analytical techniques such as Filtered Back Projection (FBP). Computer hardware and algorithm developments in the first decade of the 21st century, however, have enabled the rebirth of iterative reconstruction in clinical application of Computed Tomography.

:The reconstruction process is illustrated in Figure 7.15.12 for a simple image consisting of a 2x2 pixel matrix. It starts with a guess of a solution and then compares the actual projections with the ones obtained on the basis of the guess. Modifications are made to the pixel values and the procedure is repeated. Repetitive iterations are made until the differences between the measured and calculated projections are insignificant.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

:The first estimate of the image matrix is made by distributing the first projection, P1, evenly through an empty pixel matrix.  The second projection, P2, is then compared to the same projection from the estimated matrix and the difference between actual and estimated projections is added to the estimated matrix.  The process is repeated for all other projections.

:Developments in reconstruction algorithms such as '''Adaptive Statistical Iterative Reconstruction''' (ASIR) are based on using FBP images themselves for the initial guess and subsequently blending both FBP and IR reconstructions&lt;ref&gt;&lt;small&gt;Hara AK, Paden RG, Silva AC, Kujak JL, Lawder HJ &amp; Pavlicek W, 2009. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19696291 Iterative reconstruction technique for reducing body radiation dose at CT: Feasibility study]. Am J Roentgenol, 193:764-71.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;. ASIR and similar algorithms, e.g. '''Iterative Reconstruction in Image Space''' (IRIS), are able to selectively identify noise so as to subtract its contribution from the image data and generate CT scans of superior quality to FBP. This feature can be exploited for dose reduction and substantial decreases, e.g. 23-66%, have been reported&lt;ref&gt;&lt;small&gt;Sagara Y, Hara AK, Pavlicek W, Silva AC, Paden RG &amp; Wu Q, 2010.

Am J Roentgenol, 195:713-9.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.

As a final point, it should be appreciated that the concepts behind many contemporary developments in Computed Tomography, except helical scanning, have their origins in work done in the early days of its clinical application&lt;ref&gt;&lt;small&gt;Fleischmann D &amp; Boas FE, 2011.

== Dual-Energy Radiography ==

Dual-energy imaging can be used to eliminate bone information in an image, so that an image displaying tissues only is obtained. Alternatively, the technique can be used to generate the reverse effect where tissue information is eliminated and an image displaying bone only is generated. This latter option ideally allows the density of bones to be analysed. A theoretical background to this imaging technique will first be developed below with the discussion leading towards [[W:Dual-energy_X-ray_absorptiometry|Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry]] (DEXA).

==== Basic Dual-Energy Physics ====

[[File:macBoneTissue.jpg|thumb|Fig. 7.16: Energy dependence of the photoelectric mass attenuation coefficients of soft tissue and cortical bone.]]

:Dual-energy imaging is based on exploiting the difference in the attenuation of tissue and bone - see Figure 7.16 - at different X- ray energies. It generally involves acquiring images at two X-ray energies and processing them to suppress either the bone or the tissue information. A simplified mathematical model, similar to that developed earlier earlier for DSA, assumes that monoenergetic radiation is used and no scattered radiation, once again, is detected, so that the transmitted radiation intensity through a region of bone and tissue, acquired at a low X-ray and following logarithmic transformation, is given by:

&lt;center&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt; = μ&lt;sub&gt;tl&lt;/sub&gt; x&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; + μ&lt;sub&gt;bl&lt;/sub&gt; x&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

:where: 
::*μ&lt;sub&gt;tl&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Basic_Physics_of_Digital_Radiography/The_Basics#Attenuation_of_X-Rays|linear attenuation coefficient]] of tissue at the low X-ray energy,
::*x&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; is the tissue thickness,
::*μ&lt;sub&gt;bl&lt;/sub&gt; is the linear attenuation coefficient of bone at the low X-ray energy,and 
::*x&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; is the bone thickness.

:Similarly, the transmitted radiation intensity for the same region of an image acquired at a higher X-ray energy is given by:

&lt;center&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; = μ&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt; x&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; + μ&lt;sub&gt;bh&lt;/sub&gt; x&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

:where: 
::*μ&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt; is the linear attenuation coefficient of tissue at the higher X-ray energy, and 
::*μ&lt;sub&gt;bh&lt;/sub&gt; is the linear attenuation coefficient of bone at the higher X-ray energy.

:When these images are multiplies by separate weighting factors, k&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt; and k&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;, and the result combined to form a composite image, the result is given by:

&lt;center&gt;I = k&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt; I&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt; + k&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;

:Therefore

&lt;center&gt;I = (k&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt; μ&lt;sub&gt;tl&lt;/sub&gt; + k&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; μ&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt;) x&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; + (k&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt; μ&lt;sub&gt;bl&lt;/sub&gt; + k&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; μ&lt;sub&gt;bh&lt;/sub&gt;) x&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

:which suggests that tissue cancellation can be achieved by setting the coefficient of x&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; equal to zero, i.e.

&lt;center&gt;k&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt; μ&lt;sub&gt;tl&lt;/sub&gt; + k&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; μ&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.&lt;/center&gt;

:We can re-write this equation to get:

&lt;center&gt;k&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt; μ&lt;sub&gt;tl&lt;/sub&gt; = - k&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; μ&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

:and therefore:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{k_{h}}{k_{l}} = -\frac{\mu_{tl}}{\mu_{th}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

:which indicates that tissue can be eliminated from the composite image when the ratio of weighting factors are chosen to equal the negative of the ratio of the attenuation coefficients of tissue at the two X- ray energies. A similar approach can be used to effect bone cancellation by setting the coefficient for x&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; to zero.

==== Dual-Energy Imaging ====

[[Image:dualEnergyImageDemo.jpg|thumb|Fig. 7.17: Dual-Energy Radiography: A low and a high energy chest radiograph are shown in the top row, above the results for energy processing.]]

:CR and DR image receptors can generally be used for dual-energy radiography in either of two configurations:

::*Dual exposures: where two separate exposures are used in applications where patient movement isn't an issue; and
::*Single exposure: where two imaging plates separated by a filter are mounted in a dual-energy cassette to record the low energy image on the anterior plate and the high energy image on the other.

:The form of image data processing is illustrated in Figure 7.17.

:A chest radiograph acquired at 56 kV is shown in the top left panel of the figure.  This is referred to as a low energy image.  In the top right panel is a radiograph of the same patient's chest acquired at a high energy - 120 kV, with 1 mm copper filtration.  Results of the dual-energy processing are shown on the bottom row.  The bone-subtracted image is shown in the bottom left panel and the tissue-subtracted image in the bottom right panel.  Notice that the tissue-subtracted image demonstrates that the lesion in the patient's left lung is a calcified nodule, since it doesn't appear in the bone-subtracted image.

:Similar techniques to these have also been developed for '''Dual-Energy Computed Tomography''' (DECT)&lt;ref&gt;&lt;small&gt;Karcaaltincaba M &amp; Aktas A, 2010.

[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19995637 Thoracic applications of dual energy]. Radiol Clin North Am, 48:193-205.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;, for example.

==== DEXA Instrumentation ====

:Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) has its origin in a [[W:Nuclear_medicine|nuclear medicine]] procedure where transmission for two gamma ray energies was used to determine bone mineral density. The procedure is referred to as Dual Photon Absorptiometry and typically used the isotope [[W:Isotopes_of_gadolinium|&lt;sup&gt;153&lt;/sup&gt;Gd]], which emits gamma rays at 44 and 100 keV. As a result of limitations in photon flux and practical considerations, the radioactive source has been replaced by an X-ray tube in the DEXA technique. This technique has found widespread clinical application in the assessment and monitoring of [[W:Osteoporosis|osteoporosis]] and has surpassed the main alternative technique, Quantitative Computed Tomography (QCT) in terms of accuracy, precision and radiation dose.

[[Image:dexaScannerDiagram.gif|thumb|Fig. 7.18: Diagram of a DEXA scanning apparatus.]]

:Two general approaches to generating the appropriate X- ray energies have been developed. In one technique, the kilovoltage and filtration are switched rapidly during image acquisition, e.g. from 70 kV and 4 mm Al filtration to 140 kV with an additional 3 mm Cu filter. In the second technique, a single X-ray energy with two different filters is used, e.g. 80 kV with alternatively no added filtration and a [[W:Cerium|cerium]] or [[W:Samarium|samarium]] filter. Cerium has a K absorption edge at 40.4 keV, and samarium at 46.8 keV, and both materials generate a hardened beam compared with the unfiltered spectrum.

:The DEXA technique typically involves an X-ray tube and [[W:Scintillation_detector|scintillation detector]] mounted on a C-arm arrangement - see Figure 7.18 - so that the patient is exposed to a pencil X-ray beam scanning in a rectilinear fashion. The pencil beam is used to reduce the detection of scattered radiation and the scintillation detector typically consists of a [[W:Cadmium_tungstate|CdWO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] or NaI(Tl) scintillator coupled to a photodetector. The filter assembly is used to switch filters and calibration standards into and out of the pencil beam at appropriate intervals. Scan times with this approach are of the order of 2 to 5 minutes, depending on the examination, which are reduced in second generation instruments where a fan-shaped X-ray beam and an array of detectors are used. By rotating the C-arm around the patient during the scan in the second generation devices, a CT image can be formed. The output of the scintillation detector is fed to a computer for dual-energy data processing and image display. A host of body composition parameters can be derived from the image data, e.g. [[W:Bone_mineral_density|bone mineral density]] and soft tissue composition.

:Note that patient doses in DEXA are trivial, even in comparison to chest radiography&lt;ref&gt;&lt;small&gt;Mettler FA Jr, Huda W, Yoshizumi TT &amp; Mahesh M, 2008.  [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18566177 Effective doses in radiology and diagnostic nuclear medicine: A catalog].  Radiology, 248:254-63.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Image Superimposition ==

Correlative imaging is widely used in medical diagnosis so that information gleaned from a number of imaging modalities can be merged to form a ''bigger picture'' about a patient's condition.  It is generally necessary to spatially align image data prior to the fusion process so as to address differences in orientation, magnification and other acquisition factors. This alignment process is generally referred to as [[W:Image_registration|image registration]].

==== Image Registration ====

:Suppose we have two images to be registered - a planar nuclear medicine scan and a radiograph, as shown in Figure 7.19.

:The registration process generally assumes that a correspondence exists between spatial locations in the two images so that a '''Coordinate Transfer Function''' (CTF) can be established which can be used to map locations in one image to those of the other. In the above example, as in many clinical situations, a number of compatibility issues need to be addressed first. The obvious one arises from the different protocols used for image acquisitions, i.e. a palmar view in the bone scan and a posterior-anterior (PA) projection radiograph. We can handle this issue in our example case by extracting the right hand data from the bone scan and then mirroring it. A related issue arises when different digital resolutions are used - in this case, the nuclear medicine image was acquired using a 256 x 256 x 8-bit resolution, while the radiograph was acquired using a 2920 x 2920 pixel matrix with a 12-bit contrast resolution.

[[Image:NM13_33.jpg|thumb|center|320px|Fig. 7.19: A nuclear medicine bone scan of a patient's hands on the left and a radiograph of their right hand on the right.  The arrowed curves indicate examples of correspondence between these images on the basis of our knowledge of anatomy.]]

:When we assume minimal spatial distortion and identical positioning in the two images, we can infer a spatially uniform CTF, i.e. the transform applied to one pixel can also be applied to each and every other pixel. Let's call the two images to be registered A and B, with image A being the one to be processed geometrically to correspond as exactly as possible with image B. The CTF can then be represented by the following equations:

&lt;center&gt;u = f(x,y)&lt;br&gt;

:and &lt;br&gt;

v = g(x,y)&lt;/center&gt;

:where:
::*f and g define the transform in the horizontal and vertical image dimensions;
::*(u,v) are the spatial co-ordinates in image A; and
::*(x,y) are the spatial co-ordinates in image B. 

:The first computing step is to generate an initially empty image C in the co-ordinate frame (x,y) and fill it with pixel values derived from applying the CTF to image A. The resultant image we can say is a version of image A registered to image B.

:The question, of course, is how to determine the CTF. For situations where simple geometric translations and rotations in the x- and y-dimensions are required, the functions f and g can involve relatively straight-forward bilinear interpolations. Such transformations can also compensate for image magnification effects, and the resultant processes are referred to as '''rigid''' transforms. When spatial non-uniformities are encountered, '''non-rigid''' transforms can be used to apply different magnification factors in both x- and y-dimensions, as well as other geometric translations - in which case higher order interpolants can be applied.

[[Image:NM16_38.jpg|thumb|320px|center|Fig. 7.20: The bone scan registered with the radiograph, where a yellow colour scale has been used for the radiograph and a red/white scale for the bone scan data.]]

:Determination of the parameters of the CTF is needed and there are numerous methods we can use, for example:
::* '''Landmarks''' - where corresponding locations of prominent anatomical features in both images can be identified and two sets of co-ordinates can be derived on this basis to define the CTF. Note that artificial landmarks can be created using external markers during image acquisition, where, for instance, a set of markers which are both radioactive and radio-opaque can be mounted during image acquisitions.
::* '''Function Minimization/Maximization''' - where an indicator of the quality of registration is monitored as various geometric transformations are applied to the image in an iterative fashion to search for a set of parameters which minimize (or maximise) this indicator. Statistically-based computations such as [[Basic_Physics_of_Nuclear_Medicine/PACS_and_Advanced_Image_Processing#Spatial_Registration_of_Images|Mutual Information]] (MI) maximisation can be used for this purpose. A major advantage is that type of image registration can be achieved automatically without operator input.  An iterative process is generally followed, where the MI indicator is maximized initially for low resolution versions of the two images and then progressively for increasingly higher resolutions.  Note however that reducing the resolution of the radiograph can substantially effect its spatial quality and that, while registration may be effected at this lower resolution, the resultant CTF can be used with appropriate magnification to register the bone scan with the full resolution radiograph - as illustrated in Figure 7.20.

==== Image Fusion ====

:A method of combining image data to form a fusion display is required once images have been registered. A simple approach is to add the two images. Multiplying them is also an option.  However, this form of image fusion tends to obscure the underlying anatomy when hot spots exist in the nuclear medicine data.  A more effective approach is to use an image compositing technique called [[W:Alpha_compositing|Alpha Blending]], which uses a transparency value, α, to determine a proportional mixing of the two images, as illustrated in Figure 7.21.

[[Image:NM16_45.jpg|thumb|320px|center|Fig. 7.21: Image blending using four different opacity functions - '''Linear''': a linear opacity function; '''High-Low-High''': a high opacity is used for both small and large pixels values and a low opacity for intermediate pixel values; '''Low-High-Low''': low opacity used for both small and large pixel values and high opacity for intermediate pixel values; '''Flat''': a constant opacity is applied.]]

:This type of approach is highly developed in the publishing industry and a wide range of fusion options are available.  A common one, which was used for the images above, is to apply an equation of the form:

&lt;center&gt;Fused Image = (α) Image1 + (1-α) Image2.&lt;/center&gt;

:A transparency value of 0.5 was used to generate the image in the left panel of Figure 7.21, for instance, with the result that the underlying anatomy can be discerned through the hot spot.  A powerful feature of this approach is that the fusion transparency can be varied interactively so as to optimize the data presentation, for instance, or to confirm the quality of the registration process.

:This blending approach can be extended to incorporate a variable opacity function, where different transparency values are applied to different parts of the grey scale of one image.  Note that the terms '''transparency''' and '''opacity''' have a reciprocal relationship in this context.  Example blends are shown in the following figure.

:The '''High-Low-High''' opacity function, for instance, applies a high level of opacity to pixel values at the top and bottom ends of the contrast scale of one of the images and a low opacity to intermediate pixel values. The result is improved visualization of fused data outside of hot spot regions - as illustrated in the top right panel of Figure 7.21. The '''Low-High-Low''' function has the opposite effect and generates the capability to visualize the relevant anatomical detail with a highlighted region around it - as shown in the bottom left panel of the figure. Logarithmic, exponential and other opacity functions can also be applied, depending on the nature of the two images to be fused.

= King's Indian Defence - Sämish Variation =
=== 5. f3 ===
5. f3 is the '''Sämish Variation''', a well-known and popular line in the King's Indian. With this solid move white bolsters his centre. He remains noncommittal with regards to his king, with castling both queenside or kingside possible depending on what black does. This can be a tough nut to crack for black, who usually wants white to overextend when playing the King's Indian.

However, the Sämish does have some drawbacks for white. Most obviously, kingside development is impeded because the king's knight cannot go to its usual square, f3. Secondly, the g1-a7 diagonal is open and on a direct line to white's king, should white castle short. The Saemish has fallen somewhat out of favour at the highest levels of chess for the more natural-looking 5. Nf3, but it's still sometimes seen in grandmaster play. At the amateur level, this variation remains perfectly viable and gives both sides good chances.

= King's Indian Defence =
=== 6. Be3 ===
White defends the d4 pawn, which is usually the weakest in the Sämisch formation. Black now has a variety of options - usually he wants to strike in the centre with ...e5 or even the gambit line ...c5. The latter, although it gives up a pawn, gives black a lead in development with plenty of open lines and white's extra pawn is doubled, limiting its usefulness. In practice, black scores very well with the gambit line and it is partially due to it that the Sämisch is not quite as popular as it once was.

== Need English Technical Writer/Editor ==

I've only looked at a few pages (eg: PCA, SVD) but, based on those pages, I think this book needs a skilled editor. I think that the following needs to occur:
# Book needs to be reviewed for spelling and grammar. I found many mistakes on the SVD page despite not understanding most of what I was reading 
# I don't really have the right words to describe this problem but I'll give it a try. The style of the text is '''very''' formal. I understand that this text is aimed at a super-nerdy math/computer crowd, but I think the it should be written less formally. This text reads the way I write technical doc. As I read this doc, I keep hearing a former coworker, DM, yelling at me for thinking I could write something that wasn't too technical/formal. While I never learned to fix things the way DM fixed my text, I guess I learned that I needed her and recognize that here. If it is any help, DM always said I gave her great starting material and made her job easy. I think this text is great starting material for an editor. (If I didn't think that I wouldn't have spent so much time on this comment!)
# Be checked for consistency. For example the PCA page has a section labeled &quot;Scenario&quot; while, prior to my edit, the SVD page had a comparable section labeled &quot;Scenary&quot;.
# Probably be checked for errors that non-native English writers typically make. I'm not a language expert or technical editor so I have no knowledge if these exist but I imagine that they do and are different depending on the native language of the writer (eg: for reasons I can't identify, I think the original author of the pages I read natively spoke Chinese). 

I intend no offense to the author of this book, to non-native English writers, or native Chinese writers. (I only speak one language and I'm jealous of anyone who can speak multiple languages). I just think the quality, or perhaps better, the ''accessibility'' of this book would be greatly improved if someone who is more experienced at writing English technical documents gave it a good edit. Unfortunately I am not such a person.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Usage ==

=== write ( [ LIST ] ) ===

The '''write''' [[/function/]] is [[/variadic/]] and is used to produce simple standardized [[/output/]]. A [[/comma/]] separated [[/list/]] of items for [[/output/]] is provided in the [[/argument/]] list.

== Examples ==

 print (&quot;Hello&quot;)

== The write command does not automatically output a newline character ==

In lua, the [[/write/]] function does not automatically outputs a [[/newline/]] character.

=== Outputting a newline character ===

The [[/print/]] function automatically outputs a [[/newline/]] character. Alternatively it is possible to output a [[/newline/]] character by using an [[/escape sequence/]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Linear Motion==
Linear Motion refers to any motion moving in a straight line without changing it's direction

==Linear Motion with constant speed over time==
Any Linear Motion that has constant speed at all time can be expressed as
: v(t) = V

For any motion travels a Distance in Time caused by a Force has the following characters

:{| class=&quot;prettytable&quot; width=100% align=left border=1
! Characteristics !! Symbol !! Mathematic Formula !! Unit 
|-
| Speed || v || &lt;math&gt;\frac{s}{t}&lt;/math&gt; = a t || &lt;math&gt;\frac{m}{s}&lt;/math&gt; 
|-
| Accelleration || a || &lt;math&gt;\frac{v}{t}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\frac{s}{t^2}&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\frac{m}{s^2}&lt;/math&gt; 
|-
| Distance || s || v t = a t&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; || m 
|-
| Force || F || m a || kg &lt;math&gt;\frac{m}{s}&lt;/math&gt; 
|-
| Work || W || F s || kg &lt;math&gt;\frac{m^2}{s}&lt;/math&gt; 
|-
| Pressure || P || &lt;math&gt;\frac{F}{A}&lt;/math&gt;  || kg &lt;math&gt;\frac{m}{s^3}&lt;/math&gt; 
|-
| Impulse || F&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; || F t || kg &lt;math&gt;\frac{m}{s}&lt;/math&gt;  
|-
| Momentum || m&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; || m v || kg &lt;math&gt;\frac{m}{s}&lt;/math&gt; 
|-
| Energy || E || &lt;math&gt;\frac{W}{t}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;F \frac{s}{t}&lt;/math&gt; = F v || kg &lt;math&gt;\frac{m^2}{s}&lt;/math&gt; 
|-
|}

==Linear Motion with changing speed over time==
Any Linear Motion travels with different speed at different time v&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; at t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and  v at t

The Change in Speed
: &lt;math&gt;\Delta v =  v - v_o&lt;/math&gt;

The Change in Time
: &lt;math&gt;\Delta t = t - t_o&lt;/math&gt;

The ratio of Change in Speed over Change in Time gives the Accelerarion of the motion
: &lt;math&gt; a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} = \frac{v - v_o}{t - t_o}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\Delta v = a \Delta t&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; v =  v_o + a (t - t_1)&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Technical skills (composite reliability = 0.89; AVE = 0.73) ==
=== Description ===

A set of new, multi-item measures are operationalized. The authors define and measure the salient infrastructural competencies – termed business-to-business seller competence (B2B-SC) – associated with the seller-side of Internet-enabled commerce. They find that the conceptual domain of B2B-SC comprises seven theoretically important dimensions: (1) technical skills, (2) [[Handbook of Management Scales/Change disposition|change disposition]], (3) [[Handbook of Management Scales/Conflict management|conflict management]], (4) [[Handbook of Management Scales/Market acuity|market acuity]], (5) [[Handbook of Management Scales/Coordinated logistics|coordinated logistics]], (6) [[Handbook of Management Scales/Knowledge channels|knowledge channels]], and (7) [[Handbook of Management Scales/Fluid partnering|fluid partnering]].

=== Definition ===

Technical skills competence refers to the general abilities of the seller’s employees to use advanced information and communication technologies – such as the Internet, product development software, Internet-enabled EDI, and supply chain software – in their daily work to support business objectives.

=== Items ===

*Proficient in using information and communication technologies (ICT) to get work done. (0.83)
*Mastery of workplace ICT features and functions. (0.96)
*Make use of advanced features of ICT. (0.77)

=== Description ===

A set of new, multi-item measures are operationalized. The authors define and measure the salient infrastructural competencies – termed business-to-business seller competence (B2B-SC) – associated with the seller-side of Internet-enabled commerce. They find that the conceptual domain of B2B-SC comprises seven theoretically important dimensions: (1) [[Handbook of Management Scales/Technical skills|technical skills]], (2) [[Handbook of Management Scales/Change disposition|change disposition]], (3) conflict management, (4) [[Handbook of Management Scales/Market acuity|market acuity]], (5) [[Handbook of Management Scales/Coordinated logistics|coordinated logistics]], (6) [[Handbook of Management Scales/Knowledge channels|knowledge channels]], and (7) [[Handbook of Management Scales/Fluid partnering|fluid partnering]].

=== Definition ===

Conflict management is defined as a competence in which the selling firm has a systematic approach to the handling of disagreements with supply chain partners that consists of resolution strategies used to foster a mutually acceptable relationship.

=== Items ===

*Systems and procedures in place to resolve disputes with supply chain partners. (0.67)
*View differences in opinion with partners as an opportunity to improve relationship effectiveness. (0.72)
*Settling of disputes is joint responsibility of us and partners. (0.68)
*Regularly discuss with supply chain partners any differences in opinion we have with them. (0.85)

=== Comments ===

Much efforts have been made by the authors in order to ensure that the new scales exhibit sufficient psychometric properties, which make them quite useful. The items were evaluated on a Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). However, the observed mean value is 3.64 rather than 3. It might therefore be recommendable to change the wording, e.g. &quot;Settling of disputes is ALWAYS joint responsibility of us and partners&quot;.

=== Description ===

A set of new, multi-item measures are operationalized. The authors define and measure the salient infrastructural competencies – termed business-to-business seller competence (B2B-SC) – associated with the seller-side of Internet-enabled commerce. They find that the conceptual domain of B2B-SC comprises seven theoretically important dimensions: (1) [[Handbook of Management Scales/Technical skills|technical skills]], (2) [[Handbook of Management Scales/Change disposition|change disposition]], (3) [[Handbook of Management Scales/Conflict management|conflict management]], (4) market acuity, (5) [[Handbook of Management Scales/Coordinated logistics|coordinated logistics]], (6) [[Handbook of Management Scales/Knowledge channels|knowledge channels]], and (7) [[Handbook of Management Scales/Fluid partnering|fluid partnering]].

=== Definition ===

Market acuity denotes the ability of the seller to see the competitive environment clearly and to anticipate customers’ needs and wants.

=== Items ===

*Have a good understanding of competitors’ strengths and strategies. (0.72)
*Foresee customers’ product or service needs. (0.82)
*Understand target markets better than competitors. (0.69)
*Able to sense shifting boundaries of industry. (0.74)

== Market acuity (composite reliability = 0.77; average variance extracted = 0.52) ==
=== Description ===

The authors report a two-stage approach for the development and validation of new multi-item measurement scales reflecting a multidimensional construct called new service development competence. It is operationalized as a multidimensional construct reflected by five complementary dimensions: [[Handbook of Management Scales/New service development process focus|new service development process focus]], market acuity, [[Handbook of Management Scales/New service development strategy|new service development strategy]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/New service development culture|new service development culture]], and [[Handbook of Management Scales/Information technology experience|information technology experience]].

=== Definition ===

New service development competence reflects an organization’s expertise in deploying resources and routines, usually in combination, to achieve a desired new service outcome. Market acuity describes the ability of the service organization to see the competitive environment clearly and to anticipate and respond to customers’ evolving needs and wants.

=== Items ===

*Our service firm actively seeks out information about our company’s business environment. (0.484)
*New offerings are designed based on information actively collected on evolving market shifts and customer demands for these offerings. (0.843)
*Our service firm uses collected information to respond quickly to changes in the competitive environment. (.793)
*Customers, both internal and external, are viewed as potential and valuable sources of new offering ideas and opportunities. (0.716)

=== Comments ===

Much efforts have been made by the authors in order to ensure that the new scales exhibit sufficient psychometric properties, which make them quite useful. The mean value of the last item is 3.55 and therefore above the expected 3. It may therefore be reworded (e.g. &quot;are ''often'' viewed&quot; instead of &quot;are viewed&quot;).

== Market acuity (composite reliability = 0.80) ==
=== Description ===

The authors follow a two-phased approach to develop multi-item scales that measure dimensions of service orientation in the context of business-to-business e-commerce. Service orientation was conceptualized as a third-order construct comprised of five combinative service competency bundles: service climate; market focus; process management; human resource policy; and metrics and standards.

One of these five second-order dimensions, market focus, consists of three first-order dimensions: market acuity, [[Handbook of Management Scales/Relationship management|relationship management]], and [[Handbook of Management Scales/New service development|new service development]].

=== Definition ===

The ability to understand the business environment, the market, the competition, the customer requirements, and to implement strategies to compete successfully.

=== Items ===

*Market information is used to implement strategies to compete effectively. (0.65)
*We identify the drivers of value on the market/market segment. (0.70)
*We understand our customers’ business needs better than our competitors do. (0.68)

=== Comments ===

The third item was dropped due to low regression weight (or lower than remaining items) and due to redundancy.

=== Description ===

A set of new, multi-item measures are operationalized. The authors define and measure the salient infrastructural competencies – termed business-to-business seller competence (B2B-SC) – associated with the seller-side of Internet-enabled commerce. They find that the conceptual domain of B2B-SC comprises seven theoretically important dimensions: (1) [[Handbook of Management Scales/Technical skills|technical skills]], (2) [[Handbook of Management Scales/Change disposition|change disposition]], (3) [[Handbook of Management Scales/Conflict management|conflict management]], (4) [[Handbook of Management Scales/Market acuity|market acuity]], (5) coordinated logistics, (6) [[Handbook of Management Scales/Knowledge channels|knowledge channels]], and (7) [[Handbook of Management Scales/Fluid partnering|fluid partnering]].

=== Definition ===

Coordinated logistics competence represents the seller’s ability to effectively track and manage the flow of materials and information through a network of organizations that deliver products to customers.

=== Items ===

*Routinely provide customers with order status in real-time. (0.76)
*Able to account for inbound materials in real-time. (0.76)

=== Source ===

=== Comments ===

Much efforts have been made by the authors in order to ensure that the new scales exhibit sufficient psychometric properties, which make them quite useful. However, as a two-item scale it needs to be supplemented by additional items. Also, the composite reliability of this scale is too low. It might be questioned, if these two items really go right to the heart of logistics.

=== Description ===

A set of new, multi-item measures are operationalized. The authors define and measure the salient infrastructural competencies – termed business-to-business seller competence (B2B-SC) – associated with the seller-side of Internet-enabled commerce. They find that the conceptual domain of B2B-SC comprises seven theoretically important dimensions: (1) [[Handbook of Management Scales/Technical skills|technical skills]], (2) [[Handbook of Management Scales/Change disposition|change disposition]], (3) [[Handbook of Management Scales/Conflict management|conflict management]], (4) [[Handbook of Management Scales/Market acuity|market acuity]], (5) [[Handbook of Management Scales/Coordinated logistics|coordinated logistics]], (6) knowledge channels, and (7) [[Handbook of Management Scales/Fluid partnering|fluid partnering]].

=== Definition ===

Knowledge channels competence refers to the boundary-spanning strategies used by sellers that permit the transfer, recombination, and/or creation of knowledge among supply chain partners.

=== Items ===

*Managers regularly visit supply chain partners to enable two-way sharing of expertise. (0.85)
*Use teams that cross company boundaries. (0.81)
*Employees share expertise with partners via informal gatherings. (0.48)

=== Comments ===

Much efforts have been made by the authors in order to ensure that the new scales exhibit sufficient psychometric properties, which make them quite useful. The standardized path loading of the third item is quite low, but it might well be necessary to achieve content validity.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
To our knowledge, there is no taxonomy for VR-based medical simulators. However, there are many benefits of a taxonomy:
* Provides standardized terminology and classification;
* Helps to communicate between engineers, medical experts, educators and other important disciplines;
* Can be used after task analysis to prioritize components;
* Facilitates analysis and validation.
In summary a taxonomy supports communication and development.

The taxonomy on this page is based on &lt;ref name=&quot;Ullrich2011&quot;&gt;Ullrich S, Knott T, Kuhlen T. Dissecting in Silico: Towards a Taxonomy for Medical Simulators. Studies in health technology and informatics. Newport Beach CA, USA. 2011, February. 163:677-679. IOS Press.&lt;/ref&gt;. The intention is to make the taxonomy more accessible and dynamic to community-based extensions and changes.

== Related Work ==

In medical simulation there is an overwhelming amount of papers describing simulators and algorithms. To create a taxonomy we identified and analyzed numerous position papers &lt;ref name=&quot;Satava1996&quot;&gt;Satava RM. Medical virtual reality. The current status of the future. Studies in Health Technology and Informatics. 1996;29:100–106.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Liu2003&quot;&gt;Liu A, Tendick F, Cleary K, Kaufmann C. A survey of surgical simulation: applications, technology, and education. Presence: Teleoper Virtual Environ. 2003;12(6):599–614.&lt;/ref&gt;, surveys of existing simulators &lt;ref name=&quot;Delingette2004&quot;&gt;Delingette H, Ayache N. Soft Tissue Modeling for Surgery Simulation. In: Computational
Models for the Human Body. Elsevier; 2004. p. 453–550.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;John2008&quot;&gt;John NW. Design and implementation of medical training simulators. Virtual Reality. 2008;12(4):269–279.&lt;/ref&gt; to name a few.

Satava postulated five generations of simulators: geometric anatomy, physical dynamics modeling, physiologic characteristics, microscopic anatomy, and biochemical systems &lt;ref name=&quot;Satava1996&quot;/&gt;. Furthermore, he defined the following requirements for realism in medical simulators: visual fidelity, interactivity between objects, object physical properties, object physiologic properties, and sensory input.

Liu et al. &lt;ref name=&quot;Liu2003&quot;/&gt; discriminate between technical (deformable models, collision detection, visual and haptic displays, and tissue modeling and characterization) and cognitive components (performance and training).

Delingette &lt;ref name=&quot;Delingette2004&quot;/&gt; divided simulator components into input devices, surgery simulator (collision detection and processing, geometric modelling, physical modelling, haptic rendering, and visual rendering), and output devices.

In a recent overview by John &lt;ref name=&quot;John2008&quot;/&gt;, three areas have been defined: input data, processor, and interaction. Here, interaction has been subdivided into haptics, display technologies, other hardware components, and algorithms and software.

== Taxonomy ==

Merging the definitions and reports of the related work, we propose a taxonomy (see outline below) with three main classes: '''Datasets''', '''Hardware''', and '''Software'''. In the following we provide a brief definition of each class and give some examples, that will be discussed in the following chapters of this book in more detail.


# '''Datasets'''
#; Synthetic

#: Modeled
#; Subject-specific
#: In Vivo

=== Datasets ===

''Synthetic datasets'' can be ''Computed'' (e.g., based on statistic models or heuristics) or ''Modeled'' (e.g., produced by digital artists with 3D modeling tools, or sourced from CAD designs of instruments). Usually, these are well-meshed surface geometries with highly detailed textures. Another approach are ''Subject-specific datasets''. Several medical imaging modalities (e.g., sonography, MRI, CT) allow the reconstruction of volume data, that can either be used directly or segmented for further processing. Furthermore, physiological parameters, tissue properties and other can either be measured ''In Vivo'' or ''Ex Vivo''.

=== Hardware ===

''Interaction devices'' can either be ''Sensor-based'' or ''Props''. Sensor-based devices can be commercial off-the-shelf products, self-constructed prototypes or hybrids and examples range from game console controllers to haptic devices and optical tracking systems. Props can replicate body-parts or instruments, that are either augmented, tracked or simply passive parts of the overall setup. The ''Processing unit'' relates to the kind of computing systems that are used for the simulator. This can be ''Stationary'' (e.g., single- or multi-core systems, clusters, or servers) or ''Mobile'' systems (e.g., handheld devices, or streaming clients). Furthermore, GPUs can be used for parallelization. Finally, the ''Output'' can be realized on several modalities, ''Visual'', ''Haptic'' and ''Acoustic'' being the three most common. The visual component can be further divided into different display types: HMD, screen or projection screen with or without stereoscopic rendering. Likewise, haptics is divided into tactile and kinesthetic feedback.

=== Software ===

The ''Model'' is the link between the datasets and the algorithms. It can be regarded from two points of view: ''Technical'' (e.g., data structure, LODs, mappings &lt;ref name=&quot;Rosse2003&quot;&gt;Rosse C, Mejino JLV. A reference ontology for biomedical informatics: the Foundational Model of Anatomy. J Biomed Inform. 2003 Dec;36(6):478–500.&lt;/ref&gt;, etc.) and ''Content'' (e.g., patient, instruments, and environment &lt;ref name=&quot;Harders2008&quot;&gt;Harders M. Surgical Scene Generation for Virtual Reality-Based Training in Medicine. Springer-Verlag; 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;). One crucial element for the acceptance of a medical simulator is the Interaction with numerous solutions from HCI and 3DUI. Here, we can distinguish between ''Tasks'' (navigation, selection, manipulation &lt;ref name=&quot;Heinrichs2004&quot;&gt;Heinrichs WL, Srivastava S, Montgomery K, Dev P. The Fundamental Manipulations of Surgery: A Structured Vocabulary for Designing Surgical Curricula and Simulators. The Journal of the American Associacion of Gynecologic Laparoscopists. 2004;11(4):450–456.&lt;/ref&gt;, session management, assessment etc.), ''Metaphors'' (direct “natural” interaction, gestures, etc. &lt;ref name=&quot;Bowman2004&quot;&gt;Bowman DA, Kruijff E, LaViola JJ, Poupyrev I. 3D User Interfaces: Theory and Practice. Addison-Wesley Professional; 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;) and ''Technical'' (e.g., GUI elements, OSDs, or annotations). ''Simulation'' is divided into different levels: ''Static'' (e.g., fixed structural anatomy, environment), ''Dynamic'' (e.g., physics-based with collision detection and handling &lt;ref name=&quot;Teschner2005&quot;&gt;Teschner M, Kimmerle S, Heidelberger B, Zachmann G, Raghupathi L, Fuhrmann A, Cani MP, Faure F, Magnenat-Thalmann N, Strasser W, Volino P. Collision Detection for Deformable Objects. Computer Graphics Forum. 2005 March;24(1):61–81.&lt;/ref&gt;, rigid body dynamics, or continuum mechanics applied to soft tissue) and ''Physiological'' (e.g., functional anatomy &lt;ref name=&quot;Ullrich2007&quot;&gt;Ullrich S, Valvoda JT, Prescher A, Kuhlen T. Comprehensive architecture for simulation of the human body based on functional anatomy. In: Proceedings Bildverarbeitung fur die Medizin 2007. Springer Verlag; 2007. p. 328–332.&lt;/ref&gt;, or the physiome project). The ''Rendering'' is tightly coupled to the results of the simulation. It can be divided into ''Visual'', ''Haptic'' or ''Acoustic'' algorithms.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Fluid partnering (composite reliability = 0.79; AVE = 0.56) ==
=== Description ===

A set of new, multi-item measures are operationalized. The authors define and measure the salient infrastructural competencies – termed business-to-business seller competence (B2B-SC) – associated with the seller-side of Internet-enabled commerce. They find that the conceptual domain of B2B-SC comprises seven theoretically important dimensions: (1) [[Handbook of Management Scales/Technical skills|technical skills]], (2) [[Handbook of Management Scales/Change disposition|change disposition]], (3) [[Handbook of Management Scales/Conflict management|conflict management]], (4) [[Handbook of Management Scales/Market acuity|market acuity]], (5) [[Handbook of Management Scales/Coordinated logistics|coordinated logistics]], (6) [[Handbook of Management Scales/Knowledge channels|knowledge channels]], and (7) fluid partnering.

=== Definition ===

Fluid partnering competence represents the seller’s ability to change supply chain partners quickly.

=== Items ===

*Ability to rapidly assemble resources from dynamic pool of supply chain partners. (0.71)
*Adept at reconfiguring network of supply chain partners in very short time. (0.68)
*Able to work with a dynamic pool of supply chain partners. (0.84)

=== Source ===

=== Comments ===

Much efforts have been made by the authors in order to ensure that the new scales exhibit sufficient psychometric properties, which make them quite useful.

* Hi Andreas.  Please create a user page for yourself on this wiki.  I've had a look over this page.  There is a small change needed in one sentence for the English to make sense.  However, the whole page can be made more readable by some other changes which are not to do with correcting English.  --[[User:JamesCrook|JamesCrook]] ([[User talk:JamesCrook|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JamesCrook|contribs]]) 12:44, 10 February 2011 (UTC)

'''Definition:''' A '''convex polytope''' is the convex hull of a finite number of points.  Usually, there will be at least three non-collinear points.

'''Theorem:''' A set is a convex polytope if and only if:
:# It is not the empty set
:# It is bounded
:# It is the intersection of a finite number of closed half-spaces.

A '''simplex''' in an n-dimensional vector space is the convex hull of n+1 points that do not all lie on the same hyperplane.  If n=2, a simplex is a triangle; if n=3, it is a tetrahedron.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Viviani's theorem''' is as follows:

Take any point P in an equilateral triangle.  Drop perpendiculars from P to the three sides; let their feet be D, E, F.  Then whatever the location of P, PD+PE+PF equals the altitude of the triangle.

If P is outside the triangle, this still holds provided that the perpendicular or perpendiculars lying entirely outside the triangle are treated as having negative length.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=United States of America, Part 3=
: &lt;font size =3&gt;Part 3 covers software-generated stamps (PC stamps), those from public vending machines, and those used only in post offices and restricted to use by the military and other government agencies. Part 1 and Part 2 cover all stamps generated by stand-alone mechanical and digital meters available to the public. Click here to jump to Part 1: [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/International_Postage_Meter_Stamp_Catalog/United_States_of_America,_Part_1] and to Part 2: [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/International_Postage_Meter_Stamp_Catalog/United_States_of_America,_Part_2]


: &lt;font color=red&gt;A word of caution: Many of the type numbers used here may be changed at a later date. The specialized ''United States Postage Meter Stamp Catalog'' is undergoing revision at this time, and an effort will be made to have the type numbers in both catalogs correspond. This is likely to require changes to some type numbers in this section. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

----
&lt;br&gt;
*&lt;font size=3&gt;
:&lt;u&gt;The stamps are grouped according to appearance and usage as follows&lt;/u&gt;:

::: '''B''' - Square frank with wavy lines at the sides
::: '''C''' - Oval frank with wavy lines at the sides
::: '''D''' - Square or nearly square frank with simulated perforation frame
::: '''E''' - Frameless design containing text and arcs of various sizes

::: '''N''' - Digital stamps with torch-in-hand ornament
::: '''P''' - Simple rectangle with star ornaments
::: '''Q''' - Digital stamp with eagle head in oval ornament
::: '''R''' - Digital stamps without ornament except for manufacturer's name or initials
::: '''S''' - Digital stamps with flag ornament
:: Found in Part 3:
::: '''PC''' - Special designs generated by personal computer and printer
::: '''PO''' - Special designs generated only by machines in Post Offices
::: '''PV''' - Special designs generated only by self-service vending machines
::: '''OO''' - Special designs for official government mail use only
&lt;br&gt;
:'''NOTES''': 1) For specialized information about the meter stamps of the United States, see the ''United States Postage Meter Stamp Catalog'', 2nd edition, 1994, and the ''2001 Update'' by Joel Hawkins and Richard Stambaugh, privately published, Goodyear, Arizona.

: 2) The small green entries (&lt;font color=green&gt;'''''&quot;USPMSC: xxx&quot;'''''&lt;/font&gt;) located above the Type number are the corresponding ''United States Postage Meter Stamp Catalog'' type numbers. If not present, the numbers are the same in both catalogs.

: 3) Most recently issued digital stamps include a 2-dimensional barcode in the design. In the United States three types have been used so far. They are the large rectangular &quot;PDF417&quot;, square &quot;Datamatrix&quot;, and small rectangular &quot;IBI Lite&quot; barcodes. The listings use these terms in the descriptions. The Datamatrix barcode can vary in size, and the PDF417 barcode can vary in both size and proportions.

[[File:US barcodes.jpg|center|800px]]


: An additional barcode found as a printable option with many digital stamps is the Facer Identification Mark or &quot;FIM&quot;.

[[File:USA FIM examples.jpg|center|350px]]



: 4) This catalog does not include self-service, public vending machine stamps that do not show a date and town name. These stamps are portable, i.e. they can be carried away and used at any future time and from any location and thus function as traditional adhesive stamps rather than meter stamps. These include “Postal Buddy” and the “Postal Mailing Center” stamps (ECA-Gard, Unisys). See the specialized catalog referenced in Note 1 for information about these issues.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

==&lt;font color=blue&gt;GROUP PC: Special designs generated by personal computer==
&lt;font size=3&gt;
* All the stamps listed here are valid only on the date generated. PC stamps with unrestricted validity, i.e. they can be saved for future use, are more like traditional stamps than meter stamps and are not cataloged here. This eliminates Type SD1 from the original version of this catalog and excludes all photostamps.

* Group PC stamps can vary considerably in size, font styles, and color within the same stamp type depending on the users' printer settings, available fonts, etc. Size variations or colors other than black are unusual but should not be considered of great significance.

* The stamps are found on plain paper, adhesive labels of various sizes, and with or without fluorescent tagging. As with color and font, paper or label type is a user controlled variable and not of great significance.

* PC stamps are often found in a frame at the top right of large address labels. To the left of the stamp is a smaller frame containing a large letter or number representing the class of mail. Codes found are: '1' (first class), 'fcm' (first class), 'P' (priority), 'E' (express), 'M' (media), 'T' (parcel post), solid block (media, or other). Not all the codes are found with all the stamp types that use the labels.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;* * *
&lt;font size=3&gt;'''''NOTE''': &lt;br&gt;Several stamps in Group R resemble stamps in Group PC. If you don't find what you are looking for here, check there.''&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Sin Wave Oscillator==
The circuit configuration of a Sin Wave Oscillation is made from connecting two components L and C in series
: &lt;math&gt;L \frac{dI}{dt} + \frac{1}{C} I dt = 0&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2I}{dt^2} + \frac{L}{C}  = 0&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;S^2 + \frac{1}{LC}  = 0&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;S = \pm j \sqrt{\frac{1}{LC}} = 0&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;I = e^(j\omega t) + e^(-j\omega t)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;I = A Sin \omega t&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\omega = \sqrt{\frac{1}{LC}}&lt;/math&gt;

==Standing Wave Oscillator==
The circuit configuration of a Sin Wave Oscillation is made from connecting two components L and C in series operating at resonance
: &lt;math&gt;Z_L - Z_C = 0&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;V_L + Z_C = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Circuit has the capaability to generate Standing Wave oscillating at 
: &lt;math&gt;\omega = \sqrt{\frac{1}{LC}}&lt;/math&gt;
==Sin Wave with Decresing Amplitude Oscillator==
The circuit configuration of a Sin Wave Oscillation is made from connecting two components L and C in series
: &lt;math&gt;L \frac{dI}{dt} + \frac{1}{C} I dt + IR = 0&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2I}{dt^2} + \frac{R}{L} \frac{dI}{dt} + \frac{1}{LC} = 0&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;S^2 + \frac{R}{L} S + \frac{1}{LC}  = 0&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;S = -\alpha \pm \lambda = 0&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\alpha = -\frac{R}{2L}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\beta = \frac{1}{LC}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\lambda = \sqrt{\alpha^2 - \beta^2}&lt;/math&gt;

When &lt;math&gt;\alpha^2 &lt; \beta^2&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;I = e^(-\alpha t) [e^(j\omega t) + e^(-j\omega t)]&lt;/math&gt;

The circuit has the ability to generate Sin Wave with decreasing amplitude

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Number of Base Ten==
The number system in use of the ordinary real life is number in of base ten consists of digit from 0 to 9 . Any number greater than 9 can be expressed as
: &lt;math&gt;A x 10^n + B x 10^(n-1) + ... + Z x 10^1 + 10^0&lt;/math&gt;

For example
: &lt;math&gt;121 = 1x10^2 + 2x10^1 + 1x10^0 = 100 + 20 + 1&lt;/math&gt;

==Number of Base Two==
The number system in use of the ordinary real life is number in of base ten consists of digit from 0 to 1 . Any number greater than 1 can be expressed as
: &lt;math&gt;A x 2^n + B x 2^(n-1) + ... + Z x 2^1 + 2^0&lt;/math&gt;

For example
: &lt;math&gt;111 = 1x2^2 + 2x2^1 + 1x2^0 = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7&lt;/math&gt;

Complex Number and its Complex Conjugate is a number that has the general form
: Z = a + j b
: Z = a - j b
: [[File:Complex_conjugate_picture.svg|200px]]

==Mathematic Operations==
===Addition of 2 Complex Numbers===
: &lt;math&gt;(a+ jb) + (c+ jd) = (a+c) + j(b+d). \ &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;(a+ jb) + (a- jb) = 2a. \ &lt;/math&gt;

===Subtraction of 2 Complex Numbers===
: &lt;math&gt;(a+jb) - (c+jd) = (a-c) + j(b-d).\ &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;(a+jb) - (a-jd) = 2jb. \ &lt;/math&gt;

===Multiplication of 2 Complex Numbers===
: &lt;math&gt;(a + j b) \times (c + jd) = (ac - bd) + j (ad - bc)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;(a+jb) \times (a-jb) = a^2 - b^2. \ &lt;/math&gt;

===Division of 2 Complex Numbers===
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{(a + j b)}{(c + jd)} = \frac{(ac - bd) + j (ad - bc)}{(c + jd)^2}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{(a + j b)}{(a - j b)} = \frac{a^2 - b^2}{(a + jb)^2 }&lt;/math&gt;

===Square root===

The square roots of ''a'' + ''bi'' (with ''b'' ≠ 0) are &lt;math&gt; \pm (\gamma + \delta i)&lt;/math&gt;, where

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma = \sqrt{\frac{a + \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\delta = \frac{|b|}{b} \sqrt{\frac{-a + \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}{2}}.&lt;/math&gt;

This can be seen by squaring &lt;math&gt; \pm (\gamma + \delta i)&lt;/math&gt; to obtain ''a'' + ''bi''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; Here &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}&lt;/math&gt; is called the modulus of ''a + bi'', and the square root with non-negative real part is called the '''principal square root'''.
===Conjugation===
[[File:Complex conjugate picture.svg|right|thumb|Geometric representation of &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; and its conjugate &lt;math&gt;\bar{z}&lt;/math&gt; in the complex plane]]
The ''complex conjugate'' of the complex number {{nowrap begin}}''z'' = ''x'' + ''yi''{{nowrap end}} is defined to be ''x'' &amp;minus; ''yi''. It is denoted &lt;math&gt;\bar{z}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;z^*\,&lt;/math&gt;. Geometrically, &lt;math&gt;\bar{z}&lt;/math&gt; is the &quot;reflection&quot; of ''z'' about the real axis. In particular, conjugating twice gives the original complex number: &lt;math&gt;\bar{\bar{z}}=z&lt;/math&gt;.

The real and imaginary parts of a complex number can be extracted using the conjugate:
: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Re}\,(z) = \tfrac{1}{2}(z+\bar{z}), \,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Im}\,(z) = \tfrac{1}{2i}(z-\bar{z}). \,&lt;/math&gt;
Moreover, a complex number is real if and only if it equals its conjugate.

Conjugation distributes over the standard arithmetic operations:
: &lt;math&gt;\overline{z+w} = \bar{z} + \bar{w}, \,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\overline{z w} = \bar{z} \bar{w}, \,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\overline{(z/w)} = \bar{z}/\bar{w} \,&lt;/math&gt;
The reciprocal of a nonzero complex number {{nowrap begin}}''z'' = ''x'' + ''yi''{{nowrap end}} is given by
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{z}=\frac{\bar{z}}{z \bar{z}}=\frac{\bar{z}}{x^2+y^2}.&lt;/math&gt;
This formula can be used to compute the multiplicative inverse of a complex number if it is given in rectangular coordinates. Inversive geometry, a branch of geometry studying more general reflections than ones about a line, can be expressed in terms of complex numbers, too.

==Polar form== 

[[Image:Complex_number_illustration_modarg.svg|right|thumb|Figure 2: The argument ''φ'' and modulus ''r'' locate a point on an Argand diagram; &lt;math&gt;r(\cos \phi + i \sin \phi)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;r e^{i\phi}&lt;/math&gt; are ''polar'' expressions of the point.]]

===Absolute value and argument===
Another way of encoding points in the complex plane than using the ''x''- and ''y''-coordinates is to use the distance of a point ''P'' to ''O'', the point whose coordinates are (0, 0) (origin), and the angle of the line through ''P'' and ''O''. This idea leads to the polar form of complex numbers.

The ''absolute value'' (or ''modulus'' or ''magnitude'') of a complex number ''z'' = ''x''+''yi'' is
:&lt;math&gt;\textstyle r=|z|=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}.\,&lt;/math&gt;
If ''z'' is a real number (i.e., ''y'' = 0), then ''r'' = |''x''|. In general, by Pythagoras' theorem, ''r'' is the distance of the point ''P'' representing the complex number ''z'' to the origin.

The ''argument'' or ''phase'' of ''z'' is the angle to the real axis, and is written as &lt;math&gt;\arg(z)&lt;/math&gt;. As with the modulus, the argument can be found from the rectangular form &lt;math&gt;x+iy&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi = \arg(z) =
\begin{cases}
\arctan(\frac{y}{x}) &amp; \mbox{if } x &gt; 0 \\
\arctan(\frac{y}{x}) + \pi &amp; \mbox{if } x &lt; 0  \mbox{ and } y \ge 0\\
\arctan(\frac{y}{x}) - \pi &amp; \mbox{if } x &lt; 0 \mbox{ and } y &lt; 0\\
\frac{\pi}{2} &amp; \mbox{if } x = 0 \mbox{ and } y &gt; 0\\
-\frac{\pi}{2} &amp; \mbox{if } x = 0 \mbox{ and } y &lt; 0\\
\mbox{undefined } &amp; \mbox{if } x = 0 \mbox{ and } y = 0
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

The value of ''φ'' can change by any multiple of 2''π'' and still give the same angle (note that radians are being used). Hence, the arg function is sometimes considered as multivalued. Normally, as given above, the principal value in the interval &lt;math&gt;(-\pi,\pi]&lt;/math&gt; is chosen. Values in the range &lt;math&gt;[0,2\pi)&lt;/math&gt; are obtained by adding &lt;math&gt;2\pi&lt;/math&gt; if the value is negative. The polar angle of the origin is undefined but the value 0 is commonly used.

Together, ''r'' and ''φ'' give another way of representing complex numbers, the ''polar form'', as the combination of modulus and argument fully specify the position of a point on the plane. Recovering the original rectangular co-ordinates from the polar form is done by the formula called ''trigonometric form''
:&lt;math&gt; z = r(\cos \varphi + i\sin \varphi ).\,&lt;/math&gt;

Using Euler's formula this can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;z = r e^{i \varphi}.&lt;/math&gt;

Using the cis function, this is sometimes abbreviated to
:&lt;math&gt; z = r \ \operatorname{cis} \ \varphi. \,&lt;/math&gt;

In angle notation, often used in electronics to represent a phasor with amplitude ''r'' and phase ''φ'' it is written as&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;z = r \ang \varphi . \,&lt;/math&gt;

===Multiplication, division and exponentiation in polar form===
[[File:ComplexMultiplication.png|right|thumb|Multiplication of 2+''i'' (blue triangle) and 3+''i'' (red triangle). The red triangle is rotated to match the vertex of the blue one and stretched by √{{overline|5}}, the length of the [[hypotenuse]] of the blue triangle.]]
The relevance of representing complex numbers in polar form stems from the fact that the formulas for multiplication, division and exponentiation are simpler than the ones using Cartesian coordinates. Given two complex numbers {{nowrap begin}}''z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(cos φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''i''sin φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;){{nowrap end}} and {{nowrap begin}}''z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; =''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(cos φ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ''i''sin φ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;){{nowrap end}} the formula for multiplication is
:&lt;math&gt;z_1 z_2 = r_1 r_2 (\cos(\varphi_1 + \varphi_2) + i \sin(\varphi_1 + \varphi_2)).&lt;/math&gt;
In other words, the absolute values are multiplied and the arguments are added to yield the polar form of the product. For example, multiplying by ''i'' corresponds to a quarter-rotation counter-clockwise, which gives back ''i''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1. The picture at the right illustrates the multiplication of
:&lt;math&gt;(2+i)(3+i)=5+5i \,&lt;/math&gt;
Since the real and imaginary part of 5+5''i'' are equal, the argument of that number is 45 degrees, or π/4 (in radian). On the other hand, it is also the sum of the angles at the origin of the red and blue triangle are arctan(1/3) and arctan(1/2), respectively. Thus, the formula
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\pi}{4} = \arctan\frac{1}{2} + \arctan\frac{1}{3} &lt;/math&gt;
holds. As the [[arctan]] function can be approximated highly efficiently, formulas like this&amp;mdash;known as Machin-like formulas&amp;mdash;are used for high-precision approximations of π.

Similarly, division is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{z_1}{ z_2} = \frac{r_1}{ r_2} \left(\cos(\varphi_1 - \varphi_2) + i \sin(\varphi_1 - \varphi_2)\right).&lt;/math&gt;
This also implies de Moivre's formula for exponentiation of complex numbers with integer exponents:
:&lt;math&gt; z^n = r^n\,(\cos n\varphi + i \sin n \varphi).&lt;/math&gt;
The ''n''-th roots of ''z'' are given by
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt[n]{z}  = \sqrt[n]r \left( \cos \left(\frac{\varphi+2k\pi}{n}\right) + i \sin \left(\frac{\varphi+2k\pi}{n}\right)\right)&lt;/math&gt;
for any integer {{nowrap|''k'' satisfying 0 &amp;le; ''k'' &amp;le; n &amp;minus; 1}}. Here &lt;math&gt;\sqrt[n]{r}&lt;/math&gt; is the usual (positive) ''n''th root of the positive real number ''r''. While the ''n''th root of a positive real number ''r'' is chosen to be the ''positive'' real number ''c'' satisfying ''c''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''x'' there is no natural way of distinguishing one particular complex ''n''th root of a complex number. Therefore, the ''n''th root of ''z'' is considered as a multivalued function (in ''z''), as opposed to a usual function ''f'', for which ''f''(''z'') is a uniquely defined number. Formulas such as
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt[n]{z^n} = z&lt;/math&gt;
(which holds for positive real numbers), do in general not hold for complex numbers.

==de Moivre's formula==
In mathematics, '''de Moivre's formula''', named after Abraham de Moivre, states that for any complex number (and, in particular, for any real number) ''x'' and integer ''n'' it holds that

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\cos x+i\sin x\right)^n=\cos\left(nx\right)+i\sin\left(nx\right).\,&lt;/math&gt;

The formula is important because it connects complex numbers (''i'' stands for the imaginary unit) and trigonometry. The expression cos ''x'' + ''i'' sin ''x'' is sometimes abbreviated to cis ''x''.

By expanding the left hand side and then comparing the real and imaginary parts under the assumption that ''x'' is real, it is possible to derive useful expressions for cos (''nx'') and sin (''nx'') in terms of cos ''x'' and sin ''x''. Furthermore, one can use a generalization of this formula to find explicit expressions for the ''n''th roots of unity, that is, complex numbers ''z'' such that ''z&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' = 1.

===Derivation===

Although historically proven earlier, de Moivre's formula can easily be derived from Euler's formula:

:&lt;math&gt;e^{ix} = \cos x + i\sin x\,&lt;/math&gt;

and the exponential law for integer powers

:&lt;math&gt;\left( e^{ix} \right)^n = e^{inx} .\,&lt;/math&gt;

Then, by Euler's formula, 

:&lt;math&gt;e^{i(nx)} = \cos (nx) + i\sin (nx).\,&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Swapping concept comes in terms of process scheduling. Swapping is basically implemented by Medium term scheduler.Medium term scheduler removes process from CPU for duration and reduce the degree of multiprogramming. And after some time these process can again be reintroduced into main memory. Process execution will again be resumed from the point it left CPU. This scheme is called swapping. More generally we can say swapping is removing of process from memory to secondary memory and again back to main memory. 

Example: Assume a multiprogramming environment with Round-Robin CPU scheduling algorithm. When a quantum expires memory manager will start to swap out the process that just finished, and swap in another price to the memory space that has been freed. In the meantime, CPU scheduler will allocate a time slice to some other process in memory. when each process finishes its quantum it will be swapped back with another process. Ideally, memory manager can swap process fast enough so that there are always process in memory, ready to execute, when CPU scheduler wants to reschedule the CPU. The quantum must also be sufficiently large that reasonable amounts of computing are done between swaps.

Swapping can be implemented in various ways. For example, swapping can be priority based. That means if a higher priority process arrives and wants service, the memory manager can swap out the lower priority process to the secondary memory so that it higher priority process can be loaded to main memory for execution. As soon higher priority process finishes, the lower priority process will swapped back to main memory and execution will be continued. Sometimes swapping is also called roll out, roll in. 

Address binding rules over the memory space to be allocated to process. Because process that has been swapped out need to be swapped in on same memory location from where it let off. And address binding implements it.

Swapping requires a backing store. And this backing restore is as fast as disk. This backing store should be large enough to maintain copies of all memory images for all users.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Addition==
Addition is a mathematical operation of adding two quantities which can be represented by a mathematical expression
: A + B

==Rules of arithmetic and algebra==
The following laws are true for all values of a, b, and c, whether a, b, and c are numbers, variables, functions, or more complex expressions involving numbers, variable and/or functions.

===  Addition===
* Commutative Law: &lt;math&gt;a+b=b+a \,&lt;/math&gt;.
* Associative Law:  &lt;math&gt;(a+b)+c=a+(b+c)\,&lt;/math&gt;.
* Additive Identity: &lt;math&gt;a+0=a\,&lt;/math&gt;.
* Additive Inverse: &lt;math&gt;a+(-a)=0\,&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Subtraction=== 
*Definition:  &lt;math&gt;a-b = a+(-b)\,&lt;/math&gt;.
=== Multiplication=== 
*Commutative law:  &lt;math&gt;a\times b=b\times a\,&lt;/math&gt;.
*Associative law:  &lt;math&gt;(a\times b)\times c=a\times (b\times c)\,&lt;/math&gt;.
*Multiplicative identity: &lt;math&gt;a\times 1=a\,&lt;/math&gt;.
*Multiplicative inverse: &lt;math&gt;a\times \frac{1}{a}=1&lt;/math&gt;, whenever &lt;math&gt;a \neq 0\,&lt;/math&gt;
*Distributive law:  &lt;math&gt;a\times (b+c)=(a\times b)+(a\times c)\,&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Division=== 
*Definition: &lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{b}=a\times \frac{1}{b}&lt;/math&gt;, whenever &lt;math&gt;b \neq 0\,&lt;/math&gt;.

Let's look at an example to see how these rules are used in practice.

{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\frac{(x+2)(x+3)}{x+3}&lt;/math&gt;
| = &lt;math&gt;\left[(x+2)\times (x+3)\right]\times \left( \frac{1}{x+3}\right)&lt;/math&gt; (from the definition of division)
|-
|
| = &lt;math&gt;(x+2)\times \left[(x+3)\times \left(\frac{1}{x+3} \right) \right]&lt;/math&gt; (from the associative law of addition)
|-
|
| = &lt;math&gt;((x+2)\times (1)),\qquad x \neq -3 \,&lt;/math&gt; (from multiplicative inverse)
|-
|
| = &lt;math&gt;x+2, \qquad x \neq -3.&lt;/math&gt; (from multiplicative identity)
|-
|}

Of course, the above is much longer than simply cancelling &lt;math&gt;x+3&lt;/math&gt; out in both the numerator and denominator. But, when you are cancelling, you are really just doing the above steps, so it is important to know what the rules are so as to know when you are allowed to cancel.  Occasionally people do the following, for instance, which is incorrect:


:&lt;math&gt;\frac{2\times (x + 2)}{2}=\frac{2}{2}\times \frac{x+2}{2}=\frac{x+2}{2}&lt;/math&gt;.


The correct simplification is


:&lt;math&gt;\frac{2\times (x + 2)}{2}=\frac{2}{2}\times \frac{x+2}{1}=1 \times \frac{x+2}{1}=x+2&lt;/math&gt;,


where the number &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt; cancels out in both the numerator and the denominator.

==Rules==
Any number add zero is equal to the number
: a + 0 = a

Any number add to itself is doubled
: a + a = 2a

Any number add to its negative is zero
: a + (-a) = 0

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Subtraction==
Subtraction is an operation where one number is deducted from another. It can be represented by
: A - B

==Operation==
: a - b = -b + a
: a - b - c = a - (b + c) = (a - b) - c

==Rules==
Any number subtract zero is equal to the number
: a - 0 = a

Any number subtract to itself equals zero
: a - a = 0

Any number subtract its negative is doubled
: a - (-a) = 2a

: a x a = a&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

Any negative number multiply by itself is 
: (-a) x (-a) = a&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

Any number multiply to its negative is 
: a x (-a) = -a&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Division==
Division is a mathematical operation of adding two quantities which can be represented by
: A + B

==Operation==
: a + b = b + a
: a + b + c = a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c

==Rules==
Any number divides zero is equal to Infinity
: a / 0 = 00

Any number divides to itself is equal to 1
: a / a = 1

Any number divides to its negative is minus one
: a / (-a) = -1

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Root==
Root is an arithmatic operation opposite to power . If there exists &lt;math&gt;a ^ n = b &lt;/math&gt; Then &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{b} = a&lt;/math&gt;

==Rules==
Square root of zero is
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{0} = &lt;/math&gt;

Square root of one is one
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{1} = 1&lt;/math&gt;

Square root of negative one is an imaginary number j
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-1} = j&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Gradient==
A gradient is the rate of change of one variable compared to another variable.

If there is a change in y 
: &lt;math&gt;\delta y = y - y_1&lt;/math&gt;

and there is a change in x 
: &lt;math&gt;\delta x = x - x_1&lt;/math&gt;

Gradient , m
: &lt;math&gt;m = \frac{\delta y}{\delta x} = \frac{y - y_1}{x - x_1}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\delta y = m \delta x = m (x - x_1)&lt;/math&gt;



==Example==
two points on a straight line (2,3), (3,4) then the gradient of the straight line is
: &lt;math&gt;m = \frac{4-3}{3-2}&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Differentiation==
Differentiation is an arithmatic operation to find the value of Slope of a Curve represented by a function f(x)

For a function f(x)
:&lt;math&gt;m = \frac{\Delta f(x)}{\Delta x} = \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}.&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f'(a)=\lim_{h\to 0}{f(a+h)-f(a)\over h}&lt;/math&gt;

Then the Derivative of the function
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx} = Lim_{\delta x \to 0} \Sigma \frac{\delta y}{\delta x}&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Linear Function==
Linear Function is a function of a Straight Line

==General Form==
===Straight Line goes through point (0,0)===
For every x there is y = x 
:: x | y
:: -2 | -2
:: -1 | -1
::  0 | 0
::  1 | 1
::  2 | 2

If f(x) = y Then f(x) represents a Straight Line through point (0,0) with Slope equals 1

===Straight Line goes through two points===
If there is a Straight Line goes through 2 points (x&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;,y&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;) , (x,y)
: &lt;math&gt;m = \frac{y - y_o}{x - x_o} &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;y =  y_o + m (x - x_o) &lt;/math&gt;


===Straight Line goes through Two Intercept Points===
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{x}{a} + \frac{y}{b} = 1&lt;/math&gt;

When 
:: x = 0 y = b
:: y = 0 x = a

Function &lt;math&gt;f(x,y) = \frac{x}{a} + \frac{y}{b} = 1&lt;/math&gt;
of a Straight Line that cuts the x axis at (0,a) and the y axis at (0,b)

=== Usage ===
Use this template to insert links to letters. Example: {{tlx|Turkish/Letter|i}} or {{tlx|Turkish/Letter|o}} looks {{Turkish/Letter|i}} or {{Turkish/Letter|o}}. This template is not case sensitive. {{tlx|Turkish/Letter|A}} and {{tlx|Turkish/Letter|a}} both works: {{Turkish/Letter|A}} and {{Turkish/Letter|a}}, you can use both uppercase and lowercase .

* Please note that in Turkish, uppercase form of the letter &quot;i&quot; is &quot;İ&quot; not &quot;I&quot;. This template is specially coded to do that transformation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Getting Your Private Pilot License =

====About====
This wiki is put together in order to aid all of those out there who may be interested in the aviation field.  More will come, but at the moment I am more concerned with putting the very basics out there to get people interested in aviation.  Sections about aerodynamics, flight maneuvers, and other resources will follow.  The idea is to eventually create a '''free''' resource for training that may reduce the great burden that falls on the shoulders of every emerging student pilot.

==What, Why?==
The two greatest questions that may dissuade people from or entice people into flying are the questions &quot;what?&quot; and &quot;why?&quot;.

===What===
A '''Private Pilot License''' permits the holder to operate an aircraft under [[w:visual flight rules|visual flight rules]]. In most countries, a private pilot possessing an [[w:instrument rating|instrument rating]] may also conduct flights under [[w:instrument flight rules|instrument flight rules]]. Passengers may be carried and flight in furtherance of a business is permitted; however, a private pilot may not be compensated in any way for services as a pilot and must pay at least the pro rata share of a flight's expenses. Neither passengers nor cargo may be carried for hire.

For more information see:
[[w:Pilot certification in the United States#Private Pilot]]

===Why?===
People become pilots for many reasons.  You may do it to have a goal to work at.  You may do it because you need a way to commute to work faster.  You may do it because it is your life long dream.  Whatever the reason, aviation will become a way of life for you if you do.  It is an extremely expensive investment, and there's no going back - so you better be sure that's what you want to do.  Or go join the military.  That's probably the best way, if you're young enough.

== Getting Started ==
It's not just as easy as jumping into the cockpit and fire-walling the throttle, there is some work for you to do first.

== What You'll Need To Do==
According to the FARs (Federal Aviation Regulations) there are some things you'll need to do to become a pilot.

1.  First you will need to be at least 17 years old at the time of certification.

2. Have a current FAA third-class medical certificate. 

3. Log at least 40 hours of flight. At least 20 hours of flight with an instructor. At least 10 hours of solo flight.

2.  You must be able to read, speak, and write in English.  This is so that pilots can communicate between each other and with the air traffic controllers.  

3.  Pass two knowledge tests.  
a) The FAA Private Pilot Airmen Knowledge written test (on which you must score at least 70%). 
b) An oral exam administered by an FAA Designated Flight Examiner during a portion of your checkride. There is no pass/fail score given, simply a session where the examiner ensures that you have the proper knowledge to safely conduct flight as a private pilot. There is no requirement as to what questions must be asked or how long it should take, it is up to the discretion of the examiner. Some have been rumored to do straight Question/Answer oral exams, while others conduct their oral exam more like a discussion.


PLEASE NOTE: There is a new FAA approved Sport Pilot category which now permits a class of aircraft to be operated by individuals with a Sport Pilot license. This license has less stringent requirements, e.g. a valid U.S. driver's license can be used as evidence of medical eligibility (provided the individual does not have an official denial or revocation of medical eligibility on file with FAA). For more info, see www.sportpilot.org

==  What to Start With ==
Before you even try to spend your money on flying, try to get an introductory lesson at a lower price, or a ride in an airplane from a neighbor.  You want to know from the beginning if this is something you want to do.  After that, get all the information in written form you can.  The ASA FAR/AIM book is an excellent resource for all the regs, though ''Jeppesen's Private Pilot Manual'' is a more readable form.  Buy both of these books, and read as much of them as you can.  Go in to the whole situation with as much knowledge as you can, and use that knowledge to supplement the practical training you will receive as a student.

== Choosing a Flight School ==
In aviation, there are two types of schools: the larger more corporate flight schools, known as a &quot;Part 141&quot; school (a reference to the section of Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) which dictates operation of said school), like Sporty's, Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, etc., and the smaller &quot;Part 61&quot; flight schools, that typically are nothing much more than an instructor that calls his flight school his home business. The FAR Part that the flight school operates under has nothing to do with the quality of instructor you will find there. Either school will get you to where you wish to be. However, Part 141 schools are normally designed for &quot;streamlined&quot; training, that is, creating a lot of pilots in not a lot of time. These types of schools are typically more beneficial for those seeking to become professional pilots, due to slightly lower minimum requirements in terms of hours, and are usually structured as an &quot;aviation immersion&quot;, where you walk, talk, eat and sleep aviation. A Part 141 school is overseen by the FAA very closely, ensuring that the pilots, instructors, aircraft, and owner/operators all meet the standards as outlined in 14CFR 141. Part 141 schools are generally much larger than a Part 61 operation, and are required to have an FAA approved curriculum.    Part 61 operations can be owned by one or two instructors, and are typically small. Keep in mind, though there are schools that operate under part 61, it does NOT have to be an official &quot;school&quot; to teach you how to fly. Your neighbor the flight instructor could instruct you under part 61 regardless of a school affiliation. However, there are regulations that pertain to the aircraft used for flight instruction, which your instructor needs to be aware of if he is using a privately owned aircraft. Both are good, but again, you must keep your goals in mind.  A Part 61 school will be fine for renting and learning to fly a [[w:The New Piper Aircraft|Supercub]], but it may not be the best choice on the road to becoming an [[w:Airline Transport Pilot License|ATP]]. However, whether you conduct your training under Part 61 or 141, you can reach the same level, and attain the same certificate without limitations. Talk to graduates from your local schools, and see who they'd recommend.  Remember, pilots want safe pilots flying with them, and if they don't think a certain instructor trains competent pilots, heed their warnings, you want to be the very safest pilot in the air.

== Flight School For Dummies==

=== Follow Through ===
Remember during your training this one thing: &quot;I CAN DO IT.&quot;  Regardless of how tough it may seem along the way, you will always regret it if you decide half-way through that you did not have what it takes.  Your own drive is probably the greatest of your allies.
===Cost===
Flight school can cost a lot.  The average flight training for a Private Pilot Certificate costs about $10,000 dollars. (2008)  Most flight schools charge by the hour. Typical rates for a training airplane is $125-$150 per hour. Typical rates for an instructor is $35-$60 per hour.  The current average student in the US will need between 50 and 70 hours to get the private pilot certificate.  Again, the quality of the training, and your own commitment are going to play a role in this.  If you cannot afford to fly every day for a month, your price is going to increase due to the extra time it will take you to get back in the habit every week when you do fly.  The best and cheapest way to get your certificate is to do it all at once.  That way, you can feel your progress, and have a more intuitive grasp on how the plane flies.  This is crucial to the training of a successful pilot. There are organizations that offer scholarships to people wishing to become pilots. As well, there are companies that specialize in loans for those interested in learning to fly, so that you can have the money available to complete your training in a timely manner. Someone at your flight school can help you with these different options.

===The Framework Of Regulations===
You are going to move in an environment where safety is the main factor: the world of aeronautics. For this reason the rules and regulations are created so that they can be adapted to the world of aeronautics today to guarantee the safety of those who, at present, take part.
The great majority of countries that take part in aeronautical activities move in a framework of regulations always for the reasons of security. We are interested in the regulations that affect the Private Pilot and the 'insight flying. (VFR Visual Flight Rules.)
The organizations that are active at different levels, [World, European, National and Regional] produce the text and carry out the regulations and controls that apply to them. All that are active in aeronautics, and in particular the users, depend on such organizations. We are going to take and look at these frameworks of regulations that you will move in to get the title of Private Pilot and In sight flight VFR.
We are interested, right away, in the aspect of the regulations that affect us closely. You are going to need to know the rules of navigation. We are talking about the license and the privileges it offers, the rules of pilot training. In particular certain qualifications and the medical condition of the trainee pilot. We will look at what is an 'aircraft'. The term is generic and designates all apparatus that can take off and move in the air: airplanes, microlights, helicopters, hang gliders, balloons, and so on.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Aeroforces.svg|520px|thumb|none|The four forces of flight.]]

==Aerodynamics==
[[w:Aerodynamics|Aerodynamics]] is a branch of dynamics concerned with studying the motion of air, particularly when it interacts with a moving object.  To be a competent pilot, you will need to know and understand aerodynamics intuitively, and also scientifically.  See [[w:lift (force)|lift]].

==Why an airplane flies==
===Lift===

Lift is the upward force exerted by the wings pushing down the air around them. 
This counteracts weight.

===Drag===

Drag is the backward force of the friction produced from the airplane moving through the air.

This slows the plane down.

===Thrust===

 Thrust is the pull that the propeller produces, pulling the airplane through the air.

This counteracts drag.

===Weight===

Weight is the downward force on the aircraft produced by the Earth's gravitational pull.

===Maneuvering===


==Axes of Flight==
An airplane moves in three dimensions, or along three axes. When driving a car or boat, it which moves in two dimensions. Adding a third dimension makes the control much more complex. A banking, climbing turn requires skill and concentration.

===Pitch===

 Pitch is the change of attitude of flight about the lateral axis of the aircraft. It simple words it is nose down or nose up of the aircraft. 
The airplane climbs or descends by changing the pitch. Pulling back the yoke or stick results in a change in the [[#elevator|elevator]] causing a downward force on it and resulting in an equal upward change in attitude of the nose about the vertical plane.

===Roll===

Roll is the longitudinal axis causing one wing tip to go up while the other goes down. 
The airplane turns about this axis from the center of the nose through the center of the tail. During a roll the airplane turn like a kabob on a rotisserie. Turning the yoke or moving the stick left or right causes one [[#aelerons|aeleron]] to rotate up while the other simultaneously rotates down.

===Yaw===

Yaw is the horizontal axis on which the airplane turns left and right. 
A left or right turn is a rotation of the airplane about an imaginary line through the center of the airplane from top to bottom. The rudder pedals are moved with the feet left and right to move the [[#rudder|rudder]] which turns the airplane about the horizontal plane.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In this segment we will cover the systems for a 1967 Cessna 150.  We chose this aircraft because it is a fairly common training aircraft, and it has fairly simple systems.  More complex aircraft require more study when it comes to systems.

==Pitot-Static==
==Powerplant==
==Electrical==
==Flight Control Surfaces==

===Elevator===
The controllable surface, usually on the back of the horizontal stabilizer, which causes the airplane to pitch up or down when changes are made to the yoke or stick by pulling back or pushing in.

===Ailerons===
The small controllable surfaces, typically on the outside of the back of each wing which causes the airplane to roll when changes are made via turning the yoke or moving the stick stick left or right. Ailerons move in opposite directions, one moving up while the other moves down, in order to create a change in the longitudinal axis.

===Rudder===
The controllable surface, usually on the back of the vertical stabilizer, which steers the airplane left and right when changes are made via the rudder pedals.

===Flaps===
About the size and shape and inboard of the ailerons are the flaps. These change the shape of the wing and increase the wing's lift but at the same time adding to the drag. They are used when landing to slow the plane down without causing change the pitch. The flaps move in the same direction unlike the ailerons.  They are in the neutral position when they are retracted or in the up position.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The basic thing to remember in the cockpit is this: &quot;THINK!&quot;  Being impulsive is only useful in a close-range dogfight, and since it is not 1916, being impulsive is useless. It can, in fact, get you killed mighty fast - know what and how to do what ever needs to be done.  If you don't, ask someone.  They will be certain to help.

==Checklists==
Aviation is very procedural.  Every action you will undertake in the aircraft will have a checklist tied to it somewhere.  Many of the checklists are simple, and can be memorized, but this is not always a good practice.  Memories can be faulty, and in aviation a faulty memory can be a death sentence.  Use your checklists.

===Preflight===
Here is an example of a checklist for a 1967 [[W:Cessna 150]Cessna 150] (which is the aircraft we will use as an example most often in this tutorial.  This checklist should not be used as a replacement for your instructor's checklist.  It should only be used as an example

'''PREFLIGHT CHECKLIST'''

'''(1)Remove Control Locks and Tiedown Ropes'''

''This is the first portion.  Here we approach the aircraft, and begin our systematic search for problems that will make the aircraft unsafe.  We unrope the aircraft, and remove the control locks so that the aircraft is free and able to move.''

'''(2)Master - - On'''

''By turning on the master switch, we have given the aircraft instruments, gyroscopes, and other electrically driven systems life.''

'''(3)Flaps - - Down'''

''We lower the flaps so that we may later inspect their integrity.''

'''(4)Fuel Gauge - - Check''' 

''The fuel gauges only work when the master is on''

'''(5)Master - - Off'''

''By turning the master off, we insure battery life.  Without it, the engine will not be able to start.''

'''(6)Ignition (MAGS) - - Off'''

''This is to make sure that the magnetos, which control the engine sparkplugs are off. If the magnetos are on and the prop is turned by accident, the engine might start up and the propeller could injure, or kill you.''

'''(7)Throttle - - Closed (Pulled Out)'''

''This is to make sure that if even if the magnetos were not grounded, and the engine were to start, it will not be able to run because there would be little or no fuel running into the engine.''

'''(8)Mixture - - Lean (Pulled Out)'''

''Similar to above, this ensures that even if the throttle has some fuel running through it, the fuel-air mixture in the cylinders will be excessively lean, and the engine will be unable to continue running.''

'''(9)Sample Fuel (Check for Water &amp; Sediment) - - Left Wing'''

''By draining fuel into a small clear container, we ensure that there is no water or debris in the fuel.  Unclean fuel could lead to engine damage, or, in a bad case, to engine failure.'' Water in the engine would cause the engine to stop because water will not combust.

'''(10)Inspect Left Side of Fuselage for Damage'''

''Here we are looking for wrinkles, or anything that might impede the integrity of the airflow.  If the aircraft is not streamlined, it will not fly very well.''

'''(11)Inspect Leading Edge of Horizontal &amp; Vertical Stabilizer for Damage'''

''Again, check for wrinkles, and any sort of damage.  If our vertical stabilizer was broken, maintaining a level attitude would be hard.''

'''(12)Inspect Skin on Tail Surfaces for Damage'''

''Smooth airflow is the key.  Rough airflow will get you killed.''

'''(13)Check Stabilizers, Elevator, and Rudder for excessive travel'''

''If they seem to go to far up or down, there is probably a problem.  The push rods that control their movement may be damaged.''

'''(14)Check that Hinge Bolts are fastened &amp; Cotter Pins are in Place on Tail''' '''Surfaces'''

''This is to make sure that the aircraft's tail is actually fastened in place, and not just hanging there.''

'''(15)Inspect Right Side of Fuselage for Damage'''

''Yet again we are looking for wrinkles, or anything that might impede the integrity of the airflow. Again, if the aircraft is not streamlined, it will not fly very well.

'''(16)Drain Fuel (Check for Water &amp; Sediment) - - Right Wing'''

''Same purpose as the above check.''

'''(17)Check Flaps for excessive travel, bolts are fastened, and Control Rod is

      <text xml:space="preserve">The basic point behind take off is simple.  Get the airplane in the air without crashing into anything!  There are a couple of standard ways to do this:

==Standard==
The standard way to take off is fairly simple.  Advance the throttle to full, and start off down the runway.  Once your speed has sufficiently built (this should be your Vy speed) you pull back slightly on the stick, and raise the nose gear off of the runway.  The airplane should, at this point, fly itself off the runway and into the air.  Keep the airspeed at that Vy speed until you have finished climbing.

==To Clear a Fifty Foot Obstacle==
Climb out at Vx, to clear a 50 foot obstacle at the end of the runway.

==Soft Field==
With a soft field take off, the aircraft needs to get off the ground as soon as possible. Adjust flaps to 10degree, full aft on the yoke, and advance throttle full. You will prematurely lift off due to ground effect. Stay within ground effect (about the length of your wing span), and build your speed to Vx. Climb out at Vx.

      <comment>/* Go-Arounds */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Standard==
A standard landing is just that, standard. If the runway is well light, dry, smooth, and no obstructions at either end of the runway. Your landing would be standard.

==Short Field==
With a short field landing, you have almost no room for error. Make sure you establish an approach with a low speed. For a Cessna 152, a steady 60kias will do. Sometimes it is necessary to slip your aircraft (Forward Slip), to lose altitude fast without increasing airspeed. As you cross over the threshold, reduce power to idle, after your flare, apply full brakes and back pressure.

==Soft Field==
Would be the same as a Standard landing or a Short field landing expect once you flare. To prevent your wheels to dig in to a soft runway, like grass, sometimes you must extend your flare. When you flare, you might need to add  a notch of power, to prevent your nose gear from digging in. Once all wheels are on the ground , retract flaps to 0.

==Go-Arounds==
A Go-Around happens when a pilot aborts a landing. This might be due from a obstruction on the runway, or the pilot's approach being too high or too low. A Go-Around is also called a Balked Landing. To perform a go-around in a typical flight training aircraft, like a Cessna 152 or Cessna 172: FIRST advance throttle to full open, to prevent the aircraft of touching the ground, maintaining the ground separation, slowly retract flaps, continuing with a steady rate of climb and speed. Advice the tower or CTAF.

      <comment>Added the section Background and Theory (which needs more information) and created the section heading for How to perform the Maneuver.  Added location to find manuevering speed.  Added wiki link to directional gyro</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Steep turns are fun, and the aircraft will feel 'in the groove'.  They are a great maneuver for learning coordination and getting familiar with the characteristics of any new aircraft.  This section discusses steep turns as applied to a light aircraft such as a Cessna 150 or 172.
&lt;br /&gt;
== Background and Theory ==
There are a few important concepts to be understood when learning to perform steep turns.  Among them is the concept of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_factor_%28aeronautics%29 Load Factor].  More specifically, a pilot needs to realize that the load factor increases with the bank angle during a turn.  The load factor reaches significant levels during a steep turn and will play a role in increased stalling speeds.  

== How to perform a Steep Turn ==
'''Before you do a steep turn or any flight maneuver make sure that the area is clear of other aircraft or collision hazards.'''
&lt;br /&gt;

To perform a steep turn safely, begin at [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maneuvering_speed manuevering speed] and at a safe altitude (at least 1500 feet AGL).  Manuevering speed may be found in the pilot operating handbook (POH) and should be discussed with your instructor.  Speeds higher than manuevering speed may overstress the airframe of the aircraft and should be avoided.  Attaining maneuvering speed may require slowing the aircraft down from its normal cruising speed which could mean initially reducing the power setting.  It is helpful to pick out a visual reference point in front of you so you may determine when you have completed a 360 degree turn and time the rollout appropriately.  Alternatively or additionally you might use a reference heading on your [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directional_gyro directional gyro] if the plane is equipped.  
&lt;br /&gt;

To begin the turn, bank the aircraft smoothly over to 45 degrees. Smoothly coordinate the turn entry with appropriate rudder pressure and maintain a small amount of back pressure to keep the nose from dipping below the horizon.  As you pass 30 degrees of bank you will need to add a small amount of power (200 rpm for example) and more back pressure on the yoke. It is important to keep the aircraft from diving or climbing. Use sufficient back pressure to maintain the pitch.  At first this can seem like a lot, but you will soon appreciate this and anticipate it. The reason that you add power is because the aircraft speed will drop when back pressure is applied.  Insufficient airspeed can contribute to adverse behavior of the aircraft.  
&lt;br /&gt;

During the turn you should feel firmly planted in your seat.  Both butt cheeks should feel even seat pressure in a coordinated steep turn!  You may notice that when passing a certain bank angle the airplane will feel like it wants to continue to roll over.  This is called overbanking tendency.  To keep the airplane from rolling over, maintain control with the ailerons.  You will in fact be relaxing the pressure on both the ailerons and rudder during the heart of the turn.  Ask your instructor to explain and demonstrate for more information.
&lt;br /&gt;

Begin your rollout prior to seeing your visual reference point.  A rule of thumb for timing the rollout is to lead the rollout at half of the bank angle.  For a 30 degree turn you would start your rollout 15 degrees prior to reaching the desired heading.  When rolling out be aware that the aircraft will want to pitch up. Be ready for it; exit the maneuver nice and smoothly by keeping the nose to the horizon and reducing the power (added earlier) simultaneously.

==Maneuvering==
==Power Off Stalls==

Practicing power off stalls teaches the student to recognize and avoid stall situations that might be encountered during engine failure.  If a stall should occur, the student learns how to recover quickly.

Stalls occur when the airflow over the wing is at an excessive Angle of Attack (AOA).  An excessive angle-of -attack disrupts the smooth flow of air over the wings.  As the angle of attack, relative to the direction of movement, increases, air begins to separate from the rear of the wing and begins to swirl causing increases drag.  As the AOA increases, the flow disruption creeps towards the front of the wing until the drag caused by the airflow disruption exceeds the lift.  At this point, the aircraft begins to drop until the flow of air is corrected by reducing the angle of attack.  Since the aircraft is now headed towards the ground, the angle of attack is reduced by pushing the stick forward and pointing the nose of the aircraft towards the ground.  Since this is a power off stall, recover will take longer than a power on stall because all of your increased airspeed is generated by the effect of gravity.

Typically, stall practice is performed at high altitudes so the student will feel comfortable and have plenty of time to recover.  A power off stall is most likely to occur during landing approach, so it is a vital skill to master.  It is also very easy for most students to learn.

==Power On Stalls==

Practicing power-on stalls teaches the student to recognize and avoid stall situations, an how to properly recover should the stall occur during take off phase of the flight while full power is applied.


Since this is a power on stall, recovery is quick and easy because you have the assistance of the engine.  You simply push forward on the stick to reduce the angle of attack, and increase the power to maximum.

A power-on stall is most likely to be encountered during take-off.  Due to the low altitude, it is vital that you recover quickly.

Typically, stall practice is performed at high altitudes so the student will feel comfortable and have plenty of time to recover.  A power on stall is most likely to occur during takeoff, so it is a vital skill to master.  It is also very easy for most students to learn.

==Spins==
[[Image:ASIWarp.gif]]

Practicing spins teaches the student to recognize and avoid spin situations that might be encountered during takeoff or normal flight.  In a spin, the nose of the aircraft is pointed towards the ground and rotating.  The longer the aircraft is in a spin, the faster it rotates and the airspeed continues to increase.  If a spin should occur, the student learns how to recover quickly.

----

Typically, spin practice is performed at high altitudes [1000m or 3500' is the minimum] so the student will feel comfortable and have plenty of time to recover.  A spin is most likely to occur during the early part of the takeoff, so recognizing a spin situation and avoiding it is a vital skill to master.  Preventing a spin is as easy as reducing pressure on the pedal and pushing forward on the stick.  

To recover from an actual spin, the pilot reduces the throttle to idle (to reduce acceleration), Ailerons are placed in the straight and level position (you want them neutral to avoid aggravating the spin...), and presses the opposite rudder all the way to the floor (to counter the rotation).  Once the spin is broken (this happens quickly), the pilot pushes forward on the yoke/stick to unstall the aircraft. A spin is caused by a stall, so you want to get back into the flight regime as soon as you stop rotating. The common instinct and a recipe for death is to &quot;pull back on the stick&quot;, which will put you right back into a stall, and then into another spin and increases power until the aircraft resumes level flight.

In modern planes, Spins are not difficult to recover from, but many students find them to be quite a scary experience at first.  As you build confidence though, the nervousness will fade.

==Getting More Complex==

====Ground Reference Maneuvers====

Ground Reference Maneuvers are just that.  Maneuvers where the pilot is mainly looking at a reference point or intersection on the ground to keep the position and path of the airplane lined up with the point or intersection on the ground.  The goals of these maneuvers is to learn to keep the airplane at the same airspeed and altitude during the entire maneuver. These maneuvers are best practiced in remote areas and at 1000 feet above ground level (AGL) which is the same as the pattern altitude at most airports.  Variations of these maneuvers are sometimes called for while flying in the pattern around an airport in preparation for landing.  This is the main reason for practicing these maneuvers away from an airport.

=====S-Turns=====



=====Turns Arround A Point=====

====Navigation====
Navigating in an airplane, is a tough thing. There are many different ways of navigating. More known than others. One of the easiest ways of navigating in the air - is visual navigation. An example to this, is trying to follow a highway, seen from above - found on a map, for instance.

There are also more difficult ways to navigate (note that visual navigation was the only easy one that's mentioned). As an example, we have VOR and NDB. Both of these (as most navigation aids) sends out radio beams, what the instruments in the airplane gathers together, and shows it in an easy way for the pilots to understand, via the instruments. The NDB works the easiest, though. It's simply shown as an arrow, pointing towards the radio-beacon on a compass.
VOR works a little bit more complicated, though it is just as easy when you get into it. It works somehow like lining up to a certain bearing. No matter what angle you come from, you have to decide what bearing you want after flying trough the beacon. The instruments will help you line up on that course. Very poorly explained, but that's how it works.

Then again, if we move into the commercial world (not what you are supposed to learn, really - but just mentioned for you to try to understand all the different varieties of navigation), we have the most common thing, on high-tech airliners, something called FMS (Flight Management System) or the more known word FMC (Flight Management Computer) which is the same thing. It simply works as a &quot;computer&quot; you type in waypoints and navigational aids into, as well as altitudes and speeds (on the more complicated models only), and it will guide the airplane to it. Also, if we look back 10 years, before the FMC was in use (or in full use), there was something called INS or Inertial Navigation System. It works almost like the FMC, but instead of typing in the names of the identifiers and all the other additions; one could ONLY add coordinates on the INS. It was a very complex navigation aid of its time, but today it's out to date, and in many countries around the world, it's now forbidden to fly with a INS - as they easily drifted off course.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
The main function of the balance system, or vestibular system, is to sense head movements, especially involuntary ones, and counter them with reflexive eye movements and postural adjustments that keep the visual world stable and keep us from falling.

Together with the cochlea, the vestibular system is carried by a system of tubes called the ''membranous labyrinth''. These tubes are lodged within the cavities of the bony labyrinth located in the inner ear. A fluid called ''perilymph'' fills the space between the bone and the membranous labyrinth, while another one called ''endolymph'' fills the inside of the tubes spanned by the membranous labyrinth. These fluids have a unique ionic composition suited to their function in regulating the electrochemical potential of hair cells, which are as we will later see the transducers of the vestibular system. The electric potential of endolymph is of about 80 mV more positive than perilymph.

Since our movements consist of a combination of linear translations and rotations, the vestibular system is composed of two main parts: The otolith organs, which sense linear accelerations and thereby also give us information about the head’s position relative to gravity, and the semicircular canals, which sense angular accelerations.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Information technology experience (composite reliability = 0.85; average variance extracted = 0.56) ==
=== Description ===

The authors report a two-stage approach for the development and validation of new multi-item measurement scales reflecting a multidimensional construct called new service development competence. It is operationalized as a multidimensional construct reflected by five complementary dimensions: [[Handbook of Management Scales/New service development process focus|new service development process focus]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Market acuity|market acuity]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/New service development strategy|new service development strategy]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/New service development culture|new service development culture]], and information technology experience.

=== Definition ===

New service development competence reflects an organization’s expertise in deploying resources and routines, usually in combination, to achieve a desired new service outcome. Information technology experience refers to the use of information technology for facilitating or improving interorganizational coordination of activities and information processing in the new service development process.

=== Items ===

*Information technologies are used to speed up the introduction of new services and products. (0.471)
*IT is used to identify and diagnose customer needs. (0.635)
*IT is used to share information that coordinates new service/product development activities. (0.858)
*Communication flow within the new service development project groups is facilitated through IT-based channels. (0.911)
*Our service firm utilizes technology to facilitate the flow of information to people participating in the new service development process. (0.819)

=== Comments ===

Much efforts have been made by the authors in order to ensure that the new scales exhibit sufficient psychometric properties, which make them quite useful.

=== Definition ===

New service development competence reflects an organization’s expertise in deploying resources and routines, usually in combination, to achieve a desired new service outcome. New service development culture captures the values and beliefs fostered by the service organization that indicate a willingness and desire to innovate.

=== Items ===

*Our firm encourages entrepreneurial efforts and is accepting of risk-taking efforts. (0.548)
*The glue that holds our organization together is a commitment to innovation and new service/product development. (0.766)
*Our firm emphasizes its human resources and places a premium on high cohesion and morale in its new service development activities. (0.486)
*Non-monetary rewards are employed in new service/product development projects as a means of recognizing employee efforts. (0.581)

=== Comments ===

Much efforts have been made by the authors in order to ensure that the new scales exhibit sufficient psychometric properties, which make them quite useful. However, the values of both composite reliability and specificially average variace extracted are too low. Thus, this scale may not be used without modifications and/or new items.

=== Definition ===

New service development competence reflects an organization’s expertise in deploying resources and routines, usually in combination, to achieve a desired new service outcome. New service development process focus represents the availability and use of systematic service development practices and routines.

=== Items ===

*Our new service/product development efforts are comprised of formal stages of development activities. (0.745)
*Our service firm employs standard resources and routines in all new service development projects. (0.493)

=== Comments ===

Much efforts have been made by the authors in order to ensure that the new scales exhibit sufficient psychometric properties, which make them quite useful. The wording may be changed, because all mean values are lower than the 3 (e.g. &quot;for ''many'' new &amp;hellip; projects&quot; rather than &quot;for ''all'' new &amp;hellip; projects&quot;). That might ensure that the data is normal distributed.

=== Description ===

The authors report a two-stage approach for the development and validation of new multi-item measurement scales reflecting a multidimensional construct called new service development competence. It is operationalized as a multidimensional construct reflected by five complementary dimensions: [[Handbook of Management Scales/New service development process focus|new service development process focus]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Market acuity|market acuity]], new service development strategy, [[Handbook of Management Scales/New service development culture|new service development culture]], and [[Handbook of Management Scales/Information technology experience|information technology experience]].

=== Definition ===

New service development competence reflects an organization’s expertise in deploying resources and routines, usually in combination, to achieve a desired new service outcome. New service development strategy defines the role of development within the overall business strategy. It integrates the overall business strategy with the new services/products strategy and service design/delivery decisions.

=== Items ===

*Current service capabilities are critical factors in determining the &quot;go/no go&quot; decision for the development of new services/products. (0.577)
*Ideas for new service/product development are largely driven by the service’s overall business strategy. (.737)
*Our firm’s new service development strategy and new offerings decisions are always formulated with the overall business strategy in mind. (0.821)
*Senior managers are always willing to commit resources to promising new service/product development projects. (0.589)

=== Comments ===

Much efforts have been made by the authors in order to ensure that the new scales exhibit sufficient psychometric properties, which make them quite useful. The mean values of all items are between 3.45 and 3.76, and therefore above the expected 3. The items may therefore be reworded to achieve normal-distributed data (e.g. &quot;are ''the most'' critical factors&quot; instead of &quot;are critical factors&quot;).

I disagree that &quot;we created&quot; the basic arithmetic operations (who is &quot;we&quot; anyway). These basic operations are natural operations that already existed before humans discovered and labelled them.

== Reference to Number Line ==

I wouldn't assume that readers who don't know what addition and subtraction is understand the concept of a number line. I would prefer to explain this in terms of real world problems. Like you buy one apple and then another two apples, how many apples do you have?

      <text xml:space="preserve">I would like to learn a wide range of subjects, when I have time.
Evolution of Computers and the tremendous advances that influence the present day to day has changed is remarkable.
I am even looking forward to the day, when I may be dictating or interacting with this machine (instead of using the keyboard).
I am a mature medical Doctor with multinational experience and trying to understand Humanity, how much we have evolved over the period,as Homosapiens we have survived inspite of our initial inability to overpower more stronger animal and other species. Explosion of Human brain, birth of an immature baby with a almost a fully functional brain but needed the ability to get up and run unlike other animals.I believe that the Humans learnt to survive against all odds due to our development of thinking, learning , running when we can and learnt to evolve into a dominant species.The present exponential increase in power of Technology, curiosity, willingness to learn and survive in the most Hostile conditions, even in Natural disasters, compassion, willingness to exchange information for mutual benefit and see fellow Humans as a Group to instinctinly suppress the self destuct button for Global existence. It is never too late to learn, overcome our individual deficiencies and improve ourselves for sake of Humanity and survive in the Material World. We have learnt a lot by space expolration, deep sea expedition, improved our communication Technology and reaching an exciting era of Universal Open learning Access and willing to change and adapt our way of life. We live longer, fitter, try to find the mental balance to overcome our mortal ageing process and at the verge of nanotechnology in the Cosmic exploration potential. I wish I could live my life all over again and why not?

Section ''' Wikijunior ''' needs care since it not only attracts growing young children but also the parents of such youngsters. I feel the kids willing to learn should be presented with material in simplified form which inspire them to absorb in their brain to shape thir future.(' Dummies ' version in various topics has similar format.) Interesting ways to present topics needs special skills, which is not to be underestimated. I recall one of my teachers in my College days stating ' It is more difficult to teach an undergraduate than a Postgraduate student. ' I see similarity in filling a young mind with good material to learn. Each youngster has different capacity and hence a simplified format with cross reference for those willing to learn more etc. So far the Wikijunior format seem OK; let us not underestimate young brains; they are born in Multimedia, if not 3D &amp; virtual reality in the near future. The ease with which a kid learns to operate a digital camera, or enjoy Computer games are amazing. Young champions invariably have good genes, nature, nurture, inspiration, guidance, destiny, aspirations, Hero-worship and ..........Even the Politicians, the Presidents are getting younger and inspire (r)evolution. Kids tend to make the independent choice for their own needs in the family and have unique personality. They bring pride to their elders. I would welcome any corrections or editing my personal views.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Function==
Function is a mathematical expression representing the relation of one quantity with another quantity. For example 
# Function of one variable f(x) 
# Function of two variables f(x,y) 
# Function of three variables f(x,y,z)

==Basic Functions==
===Straight Line Function===
''f(x) = x''
: y = x
:  x | -2 -1 0 1 2
:  y | -2 -1 0 1 2
: ''A function of a straight line that goes through point (0,0)''
:[[File:Graphofyequals2x.png|200px]]

# [[/Slope-intercept form/]]

==Two-point form==
Two points also uniquely determine a line.  Given points &lt;math&gt;(x_1,y_1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(x_2,y_2)&lt;/math&gt;, we have the equation
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; y - y_1 = \frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}(x-x_1). &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
This presentation is in the '''two-point form'''.  It is essentially the same as the point-slope form except we substitute the expression &lt;math&gt;\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}&lt;/math&gt; for ''m''.

===Parabola Function===
''f(x) = x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''
: y = x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
:  x | -2 -1 0 1 2
:  y | 4 -1 0 1 4
: ''A function of a parabola that goes through point (0,0)''
:[[File:Qfunction.png|200px]]

===Hyperbole Function===
''f(x) = x&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;''
: y = x&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
:  x | -2 -1 0 1 2
:  y | -8 -1 0 1 8
: ''A function of a hyperbola that goes through point (0,0)''

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Axioms===
Euclidean geometry is an axiomatic system, in which all theorems (&quot;true statements&quot;) are derived from a small number of axioms.&lt;ref name=Wolfe&gt;

The assumptions of Euclid are discussed from a modern perspective in {{cite book |title=Introduction to Non-Euclidean Geometry |author=Harold E. Wolfe |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=VPHn3MutWhQC&amp;pg=PA9 |page=9 |isbn=1406718521 |year=2007 |publisher=Mill Press}}

&lt;/ref&gt; Near the beginning of the first book of the ''Elements'', Euclid gives five postulates (axioms) for plane geometry, stated in terms of constructions (as translated by Thomas Heath):&lt;ref&gt;tr. Heath, pp. 195-202.&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Let the following be postulated&quot;:
# &quot;To draw a straight line from any point to any point.&quot;
# &quot;To produce [extend] a finite straight line continuously in a straight line.&quot;
# &quot;To describe a circle with any centre and distance [radius].&quot;
# &quot;That all right angles are equal to one another.&quot;
# ''The parallel postulate'': &quot;That, if a straight line falling on two straight lines make the interior angles on the same side less than two right angles, the two straight lines, if produced indefinitely, meet on that side on which are the angles less than the two right angles.&quot;

Although Euclid's statement of the postulates only explicitly asserts the existence of the constructions, they are also taken to be unique.

The ''Elements'' also include the following five &quot;common notions&quot;:

# Things that equal the same thing also equal one another.
# If equals are added to equals, then the wholes are equal.
# If equals are subtracted from equals, then the remainders are equal.
# Things that coincide with one another equal one another.
# The whole is greater than the part.

Mention the абетка/алфавіт, sounds that may be foreign to English speakers, and basic grammar (sentence order, declensions, etc.). Also include links to other useful sites, at least until this Wikibook is comprehensive enough to stand on its own. I'll do this soon, but feel free to contribute ideas and additions to the textbook.

Bienvenue - Willkommen - Bienvenidos - Dobrodošli - Welcome - Добро пожаловать - 歡迎I was hoping the clever use of engaging innovations would lure the best and the brightest from around the world to gather here at en.wikibooks and there would be an invigorating renaissance of creative individuals who would actually do all that work ''for'' me...and that maybe I could smoke a pipe surrounded by the Gertrude Steins and Ernest Hemingways of my generation, marvelling at how difficult it is to get an edit in without hitting an edit conflict.

From Paulo Friere's seminal contribution, a divergent set of views have emerged with respect to silence - is it a grim wet blanket foisted by guilt and shamers, or is it a sublime vehicle for negotiating the heights of mystic intuition and the rootedness of worldly wisdom?

===Others (needing documentation)===


[[Template:Awaiting import]] For pages that need content but for which the templator is not prepared to go so far as to put in a request for import. Needs documentation.
[[Template:Welcomeback]]
===Even Babe Ruth had Strikeouts: Rejected templates===

&lt;s&gt;[[Template:Stub outline]]&lt;/s&gt; Rejected as redundant/redirected to Template:Stub. IMO it is aesthetically more pleasing to me to distinguish drafts from outlines. But I would concur that it is a level of redundancy which might warrant redirect to Template:Stub if the real issue is simply to avoid willy-nilly proliferation of templates. I suppose maybe someday this could be re-evaluated but for now simplicity seems to be the higher virtue. 

&lt;s&gt;[[Template:Stub draft]]&lt;/s&gt; See above discussion

&lt;s&gt;[[Template:Possible high risk]]&lt;/s&gt; Redirected to Template:high risk. Intention was for use on new templates for which it was not clear whether or not they will actually become high use.

==Gameplan for Wikibooks==

Develope the major books as TOC+subschapter.

Develope the simpler topics as one page books with # anchors and links in a TOC.

Create guidleines, templates and gizmos to encourage collaborative contributions.

==Help requested==
Adrignola I was wondering if you can recommend language or wording to acknowledge that the basis for this book was a wikipedia article that I wrote and no one else edited. Specifically, is it just a courtesy to acknowledge that or is it a policy imperative due to copyright, etc.? Thanks in advance you have been quite helpful, patient and considerate in the past.

==Classifying,Talk headers and TOC-Subpage expansion: y==
[[Wikibooks:CCO Resources]] details the classifications each book should have.  [[Wikibooks:Categories]] emphasizes the need to use specific categories for each book, as it's not a keyword list, but rather the most accurate representation of what subject the book covers.  You can use {{tl|talk header}} to stub out a discussion page. Are you planning to expand the many one-page books you have created using imported material?  Have you seen our help guide [[Using Wikibooks]] for developing a table of contents for linking to &quot;subpages&quot;? &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 14:32, 19 May 2011 (UTC)
===Reposted for ease of reading ''inline'' reply===
:[[Wikibooks:CCO Resources]] details the classifications each book should have. &lt;font color=green&gt;OK I am adding them in.-Geof &lt;/font color&gt; [[Wikibooks:Categories]] emphasizes the need to use specific categories for each book, as it's not a keyword list, but rather the most accurate representation of what subject the book covers. &lt;font color=green&gt;Hmmm...guess that means a 'one per customer' policy on the categories. I will read or re-read WB:Categories.-Geof &lt;/font color&gt;

You can use {{tl|talk header}} to stub out a discussion page.&lt;font color=green&gt;Cool. I will try to resist the temptation to over use them they are nice little gizmos. 

(Not sure if they are gadgets or gizmos, will have to check on google or slang.en.wiktionary.net.)-Geof &lt;/font color&gt; 

Are you planning to expand the many one-page books you have created using imported material? &lt;font color=green&gt; Yes. I assume it is still OK to keep many books one page, such as http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Radioactive_Waste_Management/Spent_Nuclear_Fuel#Dry_Storage


t...otherwise, please see [[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/User:Geofferybard#Gameplan_for_Wikibooks|The Gameplan]] on my user page-Geof &lt;/font color&gt; Have you seen our help guide [[Using Wikibooks]] for developing a table of contents for linking to &quot;subpages&quot;?&lt;font color=green&gt;Well I did use that set up for my first book, [[California Public Policy and Citizen Participation]] which is of course not &quot;completed&quot;. But I thought that for some books, one page with anchor-links works better and prints out more easily? I will review the advice on structure. Please bear with me in that it seems once one commits to a TOC-subpage format, one is stuck with that format. I would rather develope content for a while, first, and see if I do attract hordes of gifted collaborators, before getting too wrapped up in TOC/subpaging any particular book. -Geof &lt;/font color&gt;[[User:Geofferybard|Geofferybard]] ([[User talk:Geofferybard|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Geofferybard|contribs]]) 23:51, 19 May 2011 (UTC)

== Thenub:Thank you for the rights upgrade. ==

And I thank you, with thoughts of the old adage, be careful what you pray for, as you may indeed obtain it, rueing the day you wook on such larger bite than thou canst indeed chew...when I emerge weeks later with bags under my eyes, we will know that at this time I am Only Joking, of course. Now I have to deliver the goods but I will be thrilled to do a full baseline write up. I had hoped that I could do simple one-pagers on some less compelling topics but maybe that is discouraged?????

== Hi! ==

I have an account here. Just haven't done anything at Wikibooks and I'm not really familiar with how it works. I'll have to take some time to look around. Feel free to give me any useful advice, information etc. Regards, [[User:Mattisse|Mattisse]] ([[User talk:Mattisse|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Mattisse|contribs]]) 12:22, 20 May 2011 (UTC)

== Thanks to Jomegat ==

Thank you Jim for your attention to my requests which I think were better stated as import oriented. I notice you are from New Hampshire, where I did some climbing at Fraconia Notch and Tuckerman's Ravine. I sauntered up Mt Washington on the first day of spring, up the winter route, and after climbing in the Tetons and Candadian Rockies expected something quite apart from what I encountered. Maybe some day we will see some rockclimbing mountaineering and iceclimbing guidebooks on Wikibooks which will be updated as seasonal conditions change. This could result in live-saving changes in the way guidebooks are developed.[[User:Geofferybard|Geofferybard]] ([[User talk:Geofferybard|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Geofferybard|contribs]]) 22:39, 20 May 2011 (UTC)
:I drove through the Notch today on the way home from a weekend in Maine. I'd love to see some material developed here on Rock Climbing, as then I could paste it into one of the chapters of the book I came here to work on - [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book]] - with proper attribution, of course! Be careful on Mt Washington - it has a well-deserved reputation for being a deadly place.  --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jomegat|contribs]]) 00:11, 23 May 2011 (UTC)
::Franconia Notch - yes, I did a 5.8 climb there with a guy from the Dartmouth Mountaineering Club. I think part of the mountain broke off a few years later and the route I climbed no longer exists. I would like to see a wikibook on Clean Climbing Techniques. Maybe also guidebooks, perhaps in the Wikibooks Jr section.

==Linking==
I've just spent a while cleaning up all the redirects you created with the multiple page moves. I noticed you are using full name links rather than relative links, which is making a lot of work for you. If you link to a subpage like this &lt;nowiki&gt;[[/subpage/]] instead of [[main page/subpage|subpage]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; then you won't need to keep editing all the pages as you &quot;rename&quot; the main page. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 23:15, 21 May 2011 (UTC)
===Oh, hmmmm, of course! ===
I should have tried that, as the new name, despite its' virtues, does seem a bit awkward. Now I can continue with substantive edits, thanks for the HeadsUp. Maybe 
[[/subpage]] rather than [[/subpage/]] createes a cleaner page because it doesn't have the superflous &quot;/&quot; displayed at the top of the page. {?)...anyway I was fixing some of the redirects guess you got to them before I did, sorry about that. I try to do my own clean up work whenever possible.

:No actually the thought was that there would be a second book in the series focused on SONGS (San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station) which is also on the California coast and shares much of the same regulatory climate. Fukushima Aftermath is envisioned as a sort of general introduction to the series itself. But I was wondering and have been asking for feedback on whether the Diablo book should be a name without the colon and question mark, and if the word Renaissance works better.
Perhaps: Fukushima Aftermath: Diablo Nuclear Renaissance or Industry Meltdown?
The question is whether the subpages would work, etc.[[User:Geofferybard|&amp;#91;&amp;#91;User:Geof Bard गीता&amp;#93;&amp;#93;]] ([[User talk:Geofferybard|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Geofferybard|contribs]]) 23:26, 15 June 2011 (UTC)

Your edit was not saved because it contains a new external link to a site registered on Wikibooks' blacklist.

    * To save your changes now, you must go back and remove the blocked link (shown below), and then save.
    * If you feel the link is needed, you can:
          o Request that the entire website be allowed, that is, removed from the local or global spam blacklists (check both lists to see which one is affecting you).
          o Request that just the specific page be allowed, without unblocking the whole website, by asking on the spam whitelist talk page. 

Blacklisting indicates past problems with the link, so any requests should clearly demonstrate how inclusion would benefit Wikibooks.

== Google problem ==

Google of &quot;fiddle+wikibooks brings up User:Fiddle in several slots .
It seems that use names that coincide with topics will do this.
Is there someway to fix this so that the search engines can distinguish mainspace accordingly?
:The only way to fix it would be to exclude user pages from search engines entirely.  That's something that can be done, but would likely deserve greater input from the community before implementation. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 00:08, 7 July 2011 (UTC)
:: Perhaps going forward, anyway, we should have a policy to disallow ''user names which search engines would confuse with topics'' or book names. It only seems like common sense. Someone could take a user name like &quot;Nuclear energy&quot; and pull search engine hits onto completely unrelated topics. Also, if search engine designers see their ouputs returning what they will regard as garbage, they themselves might downgrade WikiBooks altogether, favoring sites, perhaps non-collaborative sites, which don't have that issue. I noticed a huge shift in google policy which at one time returned WMF hits top and then suddenly down beneath dozens of &quot;professional&quot; sites. It seems that if we let this issue languish on the vine, it will hurt the long term viability of the site as increasingly sophisticated search engineering will perhaps not be nimble enough to sort User space and will simply downgrade WMF and all collaborative sites except those which specialize in topic areas.

:::: Well I can see your point. But in the case under discussion, the username (User:Fiddle) is (1) a topic (musical instrument/subgenre)  and also (2) not a typical name for persons, nor even a typical cy bername. A general exclusion from search engines would probably have some drawbacks as well as advantages and would require a broad discussion, agreed.

::::: I meant to discuss the general or overall problem as you see it and possible solutions mentioned in this discussion rather than the more specific case of Fiddle that this discussion is about. Whether usernames turning up in search results for topics is even considered a problem in need of a solution is something the community should decide on. I think the solutions suggested so far are probably ones that no Administrator should be doing on their own without community consensus as they might be considered high impact. To get back a bit on the initial question asked, you could use &quot;fiddle wikibooks -intitle:User:&quot; in Google to exclude any usernames from the results. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 16:05, 13 August 2011 (UTC)

====User:Fiddle====
The user has not had a talk page edit since 2005. If it is an inactive user, they will not be able to respond to a request to change their name and that username will clog the search engines for perpetuity. Is there no remedy?

:A quick remedy is to add &lt;nowiki&gt;__NOINDEX__&lt;/nowiki&gt; to the user page, as I have done to [[User:Fiddle]].

==Mothers for Peace==

It is great to see some new editorial initiative on the book however it needs to be up to standard. Wikimedia Foundation projects generally have differing policies but across the board favor independent secondary source material and discourage essay-style writing, opinion, and self-promotional material.

Of course your recent edits were in good faith, so there have been some hopefully helpful {{Citation needed}} templates so that hopefully folks will get the idea. Hopefully you will find that the search for references will lead you to some very useful insights. 

(For instance, I discovered in the course of researching the book that there is actually more information about some aspects of Diablo on a website in Australia maintained by the Australian government, inoformation which would otherwise not be available on the web, anywhere. I was really quite shocked, and I'd bet Jane Swanson would love to know that little tid bit - it fits rather nicely into her whole pitch. Buuut....it is up to her whether or not she participates in WikiAnythingWhatsoever.

To be frank, if there are some botched up public advocacy failures with repercussions for the next 80,000 years of spent fuel storage, it won't be due to any slacker attitudes on my part. The Wikimedia community and I  built this book and it is up to the community to either keep the ball rolling or let it die on the vine. I am moving on to other projects, i.e., creating a series of music books and Wikiversity classes.

However, if you need any help, anything at all, don't hesitate to post here, on the discussion page at the articles/book pages, send me email and I will do anything humanly possible to assist in keeping the book up to date and viable. You can also pose questions to the administrators and you will find that Adrignola and QuiteUnusual are very generous with their time and willing to spend it in order to bring WikiBooks up to a higher level. They are a tremendous asset and they are available to help you at any time, for the asking. Just post a question on their talk pages and they will help.
 

It would not surprise me at all if policymaker staff persons view this book when they research DCPP. I saw Das Williams tonight at dinner and talked to him about DCPP and I have also talked to his staffperson Hilary. They are letting Sam Blakeslee take the lead but I am trying to get him to keep an eye on the issue. But it is up to the folks in the community to decide to use the book, or let it &quot;decay&quot;. The book may live, the book may &quot;decay&quot;. But the [[W:Spent nuclear fuel|spent fuel]] will continue, whether we apply our intellect and our will, or if we slack off. The fuel is still there...[[User:Geofferybard|&amp;#91;&amp;#91;User:Geof Bard गीता&amp;#93;&amp;#93;]] ([[User talk:Geofferybard|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Geofferybard|contribs]]) 02:08, 19 July 2011 (UTC)

= Needs fixin' ==

Blackberry Blossum is both Bluegrass and Old Time but I am working on tunebook companion guides for both genres. For ease of printing they probably both need to have separate pages but I could not create a unique page for Fiddler's Companion because of the ol' WP blacklist issue. Perhaps you can fix that?[[ Fiddlers Companion Volume III Bluegrass/Blackberry Blossom (tune)]] is the text which I wish to replicate. Many complex references which took a couple  few hours or so to compile into the article. It would be nice to keep the references and have individual pages for each book, if you get time perhaps you can take a look?[[User:Geofferybard|&amp;#91;&amp;#91;User:Geof Bard गीता&amp;#93;&amp;#93;]] ([[User talk:Geofferybard|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Geofferybard|contribs]]) 01:59, 22 July 2011 (UTC)
:I'm really not sure what you're asking here.

::OK I will try that. But I am not sure that when I get to creating printable versions if the issue will reassert itself. But I don't think that people necessarily want to print a lot of references for that particular book.  I was asking for the blacklist to not block saving the edits. It seems that the blacklist is overly inclusive. It might be blogspot which is causing the problem. But edits will not save, I get an error message that says it is necessary to remove the blacklisted reference.[[User:Geofferybard|&amp;#91;&amp;#91;User:Geof Bard गीता&amp;#93;&amp;#93;]] ([[User talk:Geofferybard|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Geofferybard|contribs]]) 23:30, 22 July 2011 (UTC)

===Detail: The error message===
Spam protection filter

Your edit was not saved because it contains a new external link to a site registered on Wikibooks' blacklist.

    To save your changes now, you must go back and remove the blocked link (shown below), and then save.

    If you feel the link is needed, you can:

        Request that the entire website be allowed, that is, removed from the local or global spam blacklists (check both lists to see which one is affecting you).

        Request that just the specific page be allowed, without unblocking the whole website, by asking on the spam whitelist talk page. 

Blacklisting indicates past problems with the link, so any requests should clearly demonstrate how inclusion would benefit Wikibooks.

===What I wish to accomplish===

I would like to be able to create a printable HTML version of [[Bards_Old_Time_Fiddle_Tunebook_Supplement|this]] book: 
which includes the references. But [[Bards Old Time Fiddle Tunebook Supplement/Blackberry Blossom|the page in question]] resists re-creation at [[Bards Bluegrass Fiddle Tunebook Supplement/Blackberry Blossom|this]] book. The tune is used in both genres, and since I wrote the entire article there is no need to worry about edit histories. So what I would like would be for the blacklist to be eased up a bit, if possible. Alternatively, maybe there is a way to overide the block. If worse comes to worse, maybe there can be some kind of macro or bot that will isolate the blacklisted link, which is somewhat of a mystery.
:It's reference #14. Blogspot is not a reference for facts and using it as a source is as bad as using Wikipedia as a citation in one's doctorate thesis.  If you really can't live without it, it can be overridden at [[MediaWiki:Spam-whitelist]], but I strongly suggest you consider the reliability of your sources. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 14:08, 23 July 2011 (UTC)

I started the Print Version [[Bards Old Time Fiddle Tunebook Supplement/Print Version 1|here]] and got through the first couple of songs, Angeline the Baker and Arkansas Traverler. When I got to Blackberry Blossom, I got stuck...if you try to paste the copy from the main book into the printable version, everything is fine until you put in the references tag in curly brackets, and then you are blocked from saving. Some readers will definitely prefer having the footnotes, so maybe this can be remedied without too much trouble. If not, I can work around it. Thanks for your time and attention, I am quite pleased with this little book and look forward to upgrading it.

:You shouldn't be copying and pasting into a print version.  It won't be kept up to date with changes on the original pages themselves.  You need to use the method I showed for transcluding a page onto another.  This will also save you loads of time and you won't have to manually update the print version.  Harness the power of the wiki.  You can then use {{tag|noinclude}} tags around the references section on the page to keep them from showing up in the print version, if desired.  Please see [[Help:Print versions]] and the modifications I made to your print version page. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 14:03, 23 July 2011 (UTC)

:Note that there is a limit to the number of transclusions. It may be only possible to provide a by chapter/section print version. I also remember seeing a template/hack that permits to have all references in a print version aggregated into a single page, I think this is the page [[Annotations of The Complete Peanuts/References]] (don't know if it works).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 14:13, 23 July 2011 (UTC)
::I appreciate the suggestion, but probably it's not a matter of the quantity of references, it seems the problem is that there are certain domains listed on the WikiBooks server which are blocked because they are suspected of obtrusive commercial activity (spamm). However, the page in question is not blocked at either Wikipedia nor at Wikiversity, where I tested, and so it is probable that WB has more sites blacklisted than WP or WV.But thanks for the suggestion.

::RE: references  I thought that a curly bracket references tag at the end of the print version is all that would be needed. Perhaps if the book is kept short enough the threshold &quot;transclusions&quot; limit won't be reached? Actually I was thinking of a references-free &quot;Economy Print&quot; version which had a Bibliography at the end, anyway, because what with global warming [?] and all, I think we are supposed to be thrifty with paper. But it is important in the long run that WB books be able to go to print fully references. Cheers.

:::Well for changes to the list you should continue to talk with Adrignola (he made some changes recently [[MediaWiki:Spam-blacklist]] or you can make a post on the administrative requests/discussion area), you can probably circumvent the block by using for instance the Wayback Machine http://www.archive.org (my favorite even if the resource is up and usable) or some working redirector (use only if you must).
:::Transclusions limit doesn't have to do with size but number of pages transcluded. I never use the reference stile on Wikibooks, I chose to add the a wikilink to wikipedia's relevant article or a direct (or using the Wayback Machine) to the relevant resource. My feeling is that it is easier to maintain, better for readers and more format portable (it would be marvelous if Wikimedia could support some sort of page formating scheme, even a special markup for the generation of collections PDFs would be great).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 17:36, 23 July 2011 (UTC)

== Definition ==

The '''convex hull''', also known as the '''convex envelope''', of a set X is the smallest convex set of which X is a subset.  Formally,

'''Definition:''' The '''convex hull''' H(X) of a set X is the intersection of all convex sets of which X is a subset.

If X is convex, then obviously H(X) = X, since X is a subset of itself.  Conversely, if H(X) = X, X is obviously convex.

'''Theorem:''' If X is closed and bounded, so is H(X).

'''Theorem:''' H(X) is the union of all straight lines joining all pairs of points in X (where the line includes the end-points).

'''Proof:''' Let A, B be any two points in X.  They are also in any convex set Y containing X.  The line joining them must also lie within Y hence it must lie within the intersection of all convex sets containing X, i.e. within H(X).  Thus the union of all such straight lines is a subset of H(X).

      <text xml:space="preserve">In general, four straight lines define four triangles (by omitting each line in turn we have three lines forming a triangle).

The four circumcircles of these triangles all intersect at the '''Miquel point'''.  This point and the four circumcentres all lie on a circle.

The unique parabola of which the four lines are all tangents has its focus at the Miquel point.

= Latvian Gambit =
===3. Nxe5===
White is threatening a fearsome queen check on h5, with the e5-knight ready to pounce on the g-pawn should Black advance it to g6. There's also the incidental threat of exf5. So that's the Latvian Gambit refuted then? Most top players would say &quot;yes&quot;. But there is a particularly optimistic breed of chess player that looks at the pawns on f5 and e4 and thinks that if the knight could just be driven away from e5, it's Black who will be capturing a pawn (fxe4), and possibly even defending it with ...d5. 

And so the move [[/3...Qf6/]] was invented. Yes, it's not usual to move the queen so early, but then again, following up a wild lunge like 2…f5 with solid-looking moves is a recipe for disaster.

There's also [[/3...Nc6/]], the Fraser Variation. &quot;You're threatening to win the exchange? Coward! I shall FORCE you to win the exchange!&quot;

[[/3...Nf6/]] has recently been suggested, preventing Qh5+ but allowing exf5. This may or may not be suicidal.

===3...Qf6===
Black's queen has come lumbering out to poke the e5-knight in the ribs. Should White hold the line, or retreat?

[[/4. d4/]] is the (old) main line. It temporarily establishes a classical pawn centre (d4+e4) allowing easy development of the remaining White pieces. If Black now wants to shift the knight from e5, she will have to play …d6 shutting in the f8-bishop.

[[/4. Nc4/]] is the Leonhardt Variation, recommended by Latvian Gambiteer Tony Kosten and now considered a more critical test of the Latvian than d4. White knows she can't prevent …fxe4, so reserves the option of confronting that pawn with a d2-d3 advance when it arrives on e4.

Other knight retreats (to d3 or f3) allow …fxe4 with an attack on the knight, giving Black time to follow up with …d5 to great advantage.

Black remains a pawn down, but White's knight has run off, so Black may now dream of playing …d5 in one move. That pawn on e4 will have to be cleared out of the way first, with [[/4…fxe4/]]. (If Black delays, White will play exf5 and retain the extra pawn.)

Black threatens to play …d5 with beautiful development and only a slightly misplaced queen to worry about. But [[/5. Nc3/]] covers d5 and gains further time by hitting the e4-pawn. Rarely do such delicate works as Black's encounter such a robust spanner as 5. Nc3.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Right Triangle==
Right Triangle is a triangle that has one angle equal to 90&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; and the sum of the other two angles equal to 90&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;
:[[File:Sohcahtoa.svg|200px]]

== Pythagoras's Theorem ==
The three sides of the right triangle relate to each other as shown
: (Hypotenuse)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = (Adjacent)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + (Opposite)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;b^2 = a^2 + c^2&lt;/math&gt;

==Trigonometry Triangle==
[[Image:Trigonometry triangle.svg|200px]]

In right triangles, the trigonometric ratios of sine, cosine and tangent can be used to find unknown angles and the lengths of unknown sides. The sides of the triangle are known as follows:
* The ''hypotenuse'' is the side opposite the right angle, or defined as the longest side of a right-angled triangle, in this case '''h'''.
* The ''opposite side'' is the side opposite to the angle we are interested in, in this case '''a'''.
* The ''adjacent side'' is the side that is in contact with the angle we are interested in and the right angle, hence its name. In this case the adjacent side is '''b'''.

===Sine ===
The '''sine''' of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. In our case
:&lt;math&gt;\sin A = \frac {\textrm{opposite}} {\textrm{hypotenuse}} = \frac {a} {h}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

===Cosine===
The '''cosine''' of an angle is the ratio of the length of the adjacent side to the length of the hypotenuse. In our case
:&lt;math&gt;\cos A = \frac {\textrm{adjacent}} {\textrm{hypotenuse}} = \frac {b} {h}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

===Tangent===
The '''tangent''' of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the adjacent side. In our case
:&lt;math&gt;\tan A = \frac {\textrm{opposite}} {\textrm{adjacent}} = \frac {a} {b}\,.&lt;/math&gt;


=== The sine, cosine and tangent rules ===
[[Image:Triangle with notations 2.svg|thumb||left|A triangle with sides of length a, b and c and angles of α, β and γ respectively.]]

The [[law of sines]], or sine rule,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clarku.edu/~djoyce/trig/laws.html|title=The Laws of Cosines and Sines|author=Prof. David E. Joyce|publisher=Clark University|accessdate=2008-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; states that the ratio of the length of a side to the sine of its corresponding opposite angle is constant, that is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{\sin \alpha} = \frac{b}{\sin \beta} = \frac{c}{\sin \gamma}.&lt;/math&gt;

This ratio is equal to the diameter of the circumscribed circle of the given triangle. Another interpretation
of this theorem is that every triangle with angles &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;
is similar to a triangle with side lengths equal to &lt;math&gt;\sin\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\sin\beta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sin\gamma&lt;/math&gt;. This triangle can be constructed by first constructing a circle of diameter 1, and inscribing in it two of the angles of the triangle. The length of the sides of that triangle will be &lt;math&gt;\sin\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\sin\beta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sin\gamma&lt;/math&gt;. The side whose length is &lt;math&gt;\sin\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is opposite to the angle whose measure is &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, etc.

The [[law of cosines]], or cosine rule, connects the length of an unknown side of a triangle to the length of the other sides and the angle opposite to the unknown side. As per the law:

For a triangle with length of sides &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; and angles of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; respectively, given two known lengths of a triangle &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, and the angle between the two known sides &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; (or the angle opposite to the unknown side &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;), to calculate the third side &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, the following formula can be used:
:&lt;math&gt;c^2\ = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab\cos(\gamma)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;b^2\ = a^2 + c^2 - 2ac\cos(\beta)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;a^2\ = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc\cos(\alpha)&lt;/math&gt;

If the lengths of all three sides of any triangle are known the three angles can be calculated:
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha=\arccos\left(\frac{b^2+c^2-a^2}{2bc}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\beta=\arccos\left(\frac{a^2+c^2-b^2}{2ac}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\gamma=\arccos\left(\frac{a^2+b^2-c^2}{2ab}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

The [[law of tangents]] or tangent rule, is less known than the other two. It states that:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{a-b}{a+b} = \frac{\tan[\frac{1}{2}(\alpha-\beta)]}{\tan[\frac{1}{2}(\alpha+\beta)]}.&lt;/math&gt;

It is not used very often, but can be used to find a side or an angle when you know two sides and an angle or two angles and a side.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Botswana, officially the Republic of Botswana (Tswana: '''Lefatshe la Botswana'''), is a country located in Southern Africa. The citizens are referred to as '''Batswana''' (singular: Motswana). Formerly the British protectorate of Bechuanaland, Botswana adopted its new name after becoming independent within the Commonwealth on 30 September 1966. It has held free and fair democratic elections since independence.

==Geography==
Geographically the country is flat and up to 70% of Botswana is covered by the Kalahari Desert. It is bordered by [[../South Africa|South Africa]] to the south and southeast, [[../Namibia|Namibia]] to the west and north, and [[../Zimbabwe|Zimbabwe]] to the northeast. It meets [[../Zambia|Zambia]] at a single point.

==History==
At the end of the 19th century conflicts occurred between Boer settlers and the native Tswana people.  The region was administered by Britain and parts of Botswana became part of South Africa.  Botswana has been '''an independent country since 1966'''.

==Economy==
A small, landlocked country of just over two million people, Botswana was one of the poorest countries in Africa at the time it gained independence from Britain in 1966, with a GDP per capita of about US$70. Botswana has transformed itself, moving into the ranks of middle-income status to become one of the fastest growing economies in the world with its average annual growth rate of about 9 percent with income per capita of about '''$14,800'''.

Botswana’s impressive track record of good governance and economic growth supported by prudent macroeconomic and fiscal management, stands in contrast to the country’s high levels of poverty and inequality and generally low human development indicators. While education expenditure is high at 10 percent of GDP and significant educational achievements have been attained, including the provision of nearly universal and free education, overall outcomes have not created the skills and workforce Botswana needs. 

The country is trying to diversify its economy, which is heavily dependent on diamonds and the beef market. Other minerals are soda ash, copper and nickel matte, gold, and coal.

==People==
There are two official languages in Botswana: [[Wikijunior:Languages/English|English]] and [[Setswana]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''Trapezoid''' (American English) or '''Trapezium''' (British English) is a quadrilateral that has two parallel sides and two non parallel sides.

Some properties of trapezoids:
* The interior angles sum to 360&amp;deg; as in any quadrilateral.
* The parallel sides are unequal.
* Each of the parallel sides is called a ''base (b)'' of the trapezoid. The two angles that join one base are called 'base angles'. 
* If the two non-parallel sides are equal, the trapezoid is called an ''isosceles trapezoid''. 
** In an isosceles trapezoid, each pair of base angles are equal.
** If one pair of base angles of a trapezoid are equal, the trapezoid is isosceles.
* A line segment connecting the midpoints of the non-parallel sides is called the ''median (m)'' of the trapeziod.
** The median of a trapezoid is equal to one half the sum of the bases (called ''b&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''b&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'').
* A line segment perpendicular to the bases is called an ''altitude (h)'' of the trapezoid. 

The ''area (A)'' of a trapezoid is equal to the product of an altitude and the median.
:&lt;math&gt; A = mh&lt;/math&gt;

Recall though that the median is half of the sum of the bases.
:&lt;math&gt; m = \frac {1}{2}(b_1+b_2) &lt;/math&gt;

Substituting for m, we get:
:&lt;math&gt; A = \frac {1}{2}(b_1+b_2) h &lt;/math&gt;

Straight Line is a line that can be drawn from any 2 points

==Straight Line Equations==
===Straight Line through 2 points===
If there are 2 points  (x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and (x,y) a line can be drawn these two points with a slope
: &lt;math&gt;m = \frac{y-y_1}{x-x_1} &lt;/math&gt;

The equation of the line can be

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Change in Variable==
A Change in variable is a term used to express the diffeence between 2 variables . Let &lt;math&gt;{\Delta}&lt;/math&gt; represents Change in 2  variables x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and x then
: &lt;math&gt;\Delta x = x - x_o&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;x = x_o + \Delta x   &lt;/math&gt;

If there is a function  f(x) such that when x change by an amount  &lt;math&gt;{\Delta} x&lt;/math&gt; the change in function will be
: &lt;math&gt;\Delta f(x) =  f(x) -  f(x_o)   &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;f(x) =  f(x_o) + \Delta f(x)  &lt;/math&gt;

==Example==
There are 2 points (1,3) (5,7) then
: &lt;math&gt;\Delta x = x - x_o = 5 - 1 = 4&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\Delta f(x) =  7 -  3   = 4&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Portfolio management ==
Portfolio management (or Project Portfolio Management - PPM) is about grouping two or more programs or projects that may help business to achieve its strategic goals. Portfolio management helps in prioritization, improve resource usage by sharing them, better communication among programs/projects participants of the portfolio.

Scope for portfolios are business goals that change according to business strategic.

Example of portfolio could be to lower costs by improving some facility's services. This portfolio would have one program/project for gas, other for water, other for electricity.

== Project program management ==
Program management is about grouping two or more projects that have similar objectives and will get more benefits if managed together, instead of alone. Program management helps in resolving issues constraints and better direction alignment.

Scope for programs are larger than projects and impacts in a more significant way.

== Project management ==
A project is a temporary endeavor, having a defined beginning and end (usually constrained by date, but can be by funding or deliverables), undertaken to meet unique goals and objectives, usually to bring about beneficial change or added value. The temporary nature of projects stands in contrast to business as usual (or operations), which are repetitive, permanent or semi-permanent functional work to produce products or services. In practice, the management of these two systems is often found to be quite different, and as such requires the development of distinct technical skills and the adoption of separate management.

Scope for projects are defined and progress through project life cycle.

== Levels ==
A portfolio may be composed of other portfolios. In that case first one would be called High Level Portfolio, and former would be Low Level Portfolio.

Levels interactions are:
* From Higher level portfolio to Lower level portfolio, Higher level program or project
* From Lower level portfolio to Lower level portfolio, Higher level program or project
* From Higher level program to Lower level program or project
* From Programs to projects

Interaction from higher level to lower (e.g. what High level portfolio sends to program):
* Strategies and priorities.
* Progressive elaboration.
* Governance .
* Impacts from changes in other portfolios, programs or projects.

Interaction from lower level to higher(e.g. what projects sends back to High level portfolio sends):
* Performance reports.
* Change requests with impact on other portfolios, programs or projects.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Derivative==

A derivative is a mathematical operation to find the rate of change of a function.

--[[Special:Contributions/174.117.102.136|174.117.102.136]] ([[User talk:174.117.102.136|discuss]]) 20:19, 2 March 2012 (UTC)

==Formula==
For a non linear function f(x) = y . The rate of change of f(x) correspond to change of x is equal to the ratio of change in f(x) over change in x
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\Delta f(x)}{\Delta x} = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}  &lt;/math&gt;

Then the Derivative of the function is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} f(x) = Lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \Sigma \frac{\Delta f(x)}{\Delta x} = Lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \Sigma \frac{y}{x}&lt;/math&gt;

but the derivative must exist uniquely at the point x. Seemingly well-behaved functions might not have derivatives at certain points. As examples, f(x)= 1/x has no derivative at x = 0; F(x) = |x| has two possible results at x = 0 (-1 for any value for which x&lt;0 and +1 for any value for which x&gt;0) On the other side, a function might have no value at x but a derivative of x, for example  f(x)= x/x at x = 0. The function is undefined at x = 0, but the derivative is 0 at
x = 0 as for any other value of x.

Practically all rules result, directly or indirectly, from a generalized treatment of the function.

==Table of Derivative==
{{wikipedia|Table_of_derivatives}}
===General Rules===
&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}(f + g)= \frac{df}{dx} + \frac{dg}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}(cf)= c\frac{df}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}(fg)= f\frac{dg}{dx} + g\frac{df}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}\left(\frac{f}{g}\right) = \frac{g\frac{df}{dx} - f\frac{dg}{dx}}{g^2}&lt;/math&gt;

===Powers and Polynomials===
*&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} (c) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}x=1&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}x^n=nx^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}\sqrt{x}=\frac{1}{2\sqrt x}&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}\frac{1}{x}=-\frac{1}{x^2}&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}(c_n x^n + c_{n-1} x^{n-1} + c_{n-2}x^{n-2} + \cdots +c_2x^2 +  c_1 x + c_0) = n c_n x^{n-1} + (n-1) c_{n-1} x^{n-2} + (n-2) c_{n-2}x^{n-3} + \cdots + 2c_2x+ c_1 &lt;/math&gt;

===Trigonometric Functions===
&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} \sin (x)= \cos (x)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} \cos (x)= -\sin (x)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} \tan (x)= \sec^2 (x)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} \cot (x)= -\csc^2 (x)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} \sec (x)= \sec (x) \tan (x)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} \csc (x) = -\csc (x) \cot (x)&lt;/math&gt;

===Exponential and Logarithmic Functions===
*&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} e^x =e^x&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Sequence==
In [[mathematics]], a '''sequence''' is an ordered list of objects (or events). Like a [[Set (mathematics)|set]], it contains [[Element (mathematics)|members]] (also called ''elements'' or ''terms''), and the number of terms (possibly infinite) is called the ''length'' of the sequence.  Unlike a set, order matters, and exactly the same elements can appear multiple times at different positions in the sequence. A sequence is a [[Discrete mathematics|discrete]] [[function (mathematics)|function]].

For example, (C, R, Y) is a sequence of letters that differs from (Y, C, R), as the ordering matters. Sequences can be ''[[finite set|finite]]'', as in this example, or ''[[Infinite set|infinite]]'', such as the sequence of all [[even and odd numbers|even]] [[positive and negative numbers|positive]] [[integer]]s (2, 4, 6,...).  Finite sequences are sometimes known as ''strings'' or ''words'' and infinite sequences as ''streams''.  The empty sequence&amp;nbsp;(&amp;nbsp;) is included in most notions of sequence, but may be excluded depending on the context.

# 1, 3, 5, ... , 2n + 1

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Series==
A '''series''' is the sum of the terms of a [[sequence]]. 
: '''Finite sequences and series''' have defined first and last terms, whereas 
: '''infinite sequences and series''' continue indefinitely

The sum of terms of a sequence is a [[series (mathematics)|series]]. More precisely, if (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ...) is a sequence, one may consider the sequence of [[partial sum]]s (''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''S''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ...), with
:&lt;math&gt;S_n=x_1+x_2+\dots + x_n=\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}x_i.&lt;/math&gt;

==Sums of powers==
*&lt;math&gt;\sum_{m=1}^n m = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

*&lt;math&gt;\sum_{m=1}^n m^2 = 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + ... + n^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} = \frac{n^3}{3} + \frac{n^2}{2} + \frac{n}{6}  \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

*&lt;math&gt;\sum_{m=1}^n m^3 = 1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + ... + n^3 = \left[\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\right]^2 = \frac{n^4}{4} + \frac{n^3}{2} + \frac{n^2}{4} = \left(\sum_{m=1}^n m\right)^2\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

*&lt;math&gt;\sum_{m=1}^{n} m^{4} = = 1^4 + 2^4 + 3^4 + ... + n^4 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)(3n^{2}+3n-1)}{30}=\frac{6 n^5+15 n^4+10 n^3-n}{30}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

*&lt;math&gt;\sum_{m=0}^n m^s = \frac{(n+1)^{s+1}}{s+1} + \sum_{k=1}^s\frac{B_k}{s-k+1}{s\choose k}(n+1)^{s-k+1}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:where &lt;math&gt;B_k\,&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;k\,&lt;/math&gt;th [[Bernoulli number]], and &lt;math&gt;B_1\,&lt;/math&gt;  is negative.

*&lt;math&gt;\sum^{\infty}_{m=1} \frac{1}{m^2} = \frac{\pi^2}{6}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\sum^{\infty}_{m=1} \frac{1}{m^4} = \frac{\pi^4}{90}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\sum^{\infty}_{m=1} \frac{1}{m^{2n}} = (-1)^{n+1} \frac{B_{2n} (2\pi)^{2n}}{2(2n)!} &lt;/math&gt;

*&lt;math&gt;\sum_{m=1}^\infty m^{-s} = \prod_{p \text{ prime}} \frac{1}{1-p^{-s}} = \zeta(s)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:where &lt;math&gt;\zeta(s)\,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Riemann zeta function]].

===Factorial denominators===
Many power series which arise from [[Taylor's theorem]] have a [[coefficient]] containing a [[factorial]].

*&lt;math&gt;\sum^{\infty}_{m=0} m^4 \frac{x^m}{m!} = (x + 7x^2 + 6x^3 + x^4) e^x&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\sum^{\infty}_{m=0} m^n \frac{x^m}{m!} = x \frac{d}{dx}\sum^{\infty}_{m=0} m^{n-1} \frac{x^m}{m!}&lt;/math&gt;

*&lt;math&gt;\sum^{\infty}_{m=0} \frac{(-1)^m}{(2m+1)!} x^{2m+1}=  x - \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^5}{5!} - \cdots = \sin x &lt;/math&gt;

*&lt;math&gt;\sum^{\infty}_{m=0} \frac{(-1)^m}{(2m)!} x^{2m} =  1 - \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^4}{4!} - \cdots = \cos x &lt;/math&gt;

*&lt;math&gt;\sum^{\infty}_{m=0} \frac{x^{2m+1}}{(2m+1)!} = \sinh x &lt;/math&gt;

*&lt;math&gt;\sum^{\infty}_{m=0} \frac{x^{2m}}{(2m)!} = \cosh x &lt;/math&gt;

==Limits of general functions==

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{h\to 0}{f(x+h)-f(x)\over h}=f'(x)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{h\to0}\left(\frac{f(x+h)}{f(x)}\right)^\frac{1}{h}=\exp\left(\frac{f'(x)}{f(x)}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{h \to 0}{ \left({f(x(1+h))\over{f(x)}}\right)^{1\over{h}} }=\exp\left(\frac{x f'(x)}{f(x)}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

==Notable special limits==

: &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to+\infty} \left(1+\frac{k}{x}\right)^m=e^{mk}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to+\infty} \left(1-\frac{1}{x}\right)^x=\frac{1}{e}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to+\infty} \left(1+\frac{k}{x}\right)^x=e^k&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{n}{\sqrt[n]{n!}}=e&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to \infty }\, 2^{n} \underbrace{\sqrt{2-\sqrt{2+\sqrt{2+\text{...} +\sqrt{2}}}}}_n= \pi&lt;/math&gt;

==Simple functions==

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to c} a = a&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to c} x = c&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to c} ax + b = ac + b&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to c} x^r = c^r \qquad \mbox{ if } r \mbox{ is a positive integer}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to 0^+} \frac{1}{x^r} = +\infty&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to 0^-} \frac{1}{x^r} = \begin{cases} -\infty, &amp; \text{if } r \text{ is odd} \\ +\infty, &amp; \text{if } r \text{ is even}\end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

==Logarithmic and exponential functions==
:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{For } a &gt; 1: \,&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to 0^+} \log_a x = -\infty&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to \infty} \log_a x = \infty&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to -\infty} a^x = 0&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to \infty} a^x = \infty&lt;/math&gt;

==Trigonometric functions==

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to a} \sin x = \sin a&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to a} \cos x = \cos a&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin x}{x} = 1&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{1-\cos x}{x} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{1-\cos x}{x^2} = \frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to n^\pm} \tan \left(\pi x + \frac{\pi}{2}\right) = \mp\infty \qquad \text{for any integer } n&lt;/math&gt;

==Near infinities==

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to\infty}N/x=0 \text{ for any real }N &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to\infty}x/N=\begin{cases} \infty, &amp; N &gt; 0 \\ \text{does not exist}, &amp; N = 0 \\ -\infty, &amp; N &lt; 0 \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to\infty}\sqrt[N]{x}= \infty \text{ for any } N &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to\infty}\log x=\infty&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to0^+}\log x=-\infty&lt;/math&gt;

= Latvian Gambit =
===3...Qf6===
Black's queen has come lumbering out to poke the e5-knight in the ribs. Should White hold the line, or retreat?

[[/4. d4/]] is the (old) main line. It temporarily establishes a classical pawn centre (d4+e4) allowing easy development of the remaining White pieces. If Black now wants to shift the knight from e5, she will have to play …d6 shutting in the f8-bishop.

[[/4. Nc4/]] is the Leonhardt Variation, recommended by Latvian Gambiteer Tony Kosten and now considered a more critical test of the Latvian than d4. White knows she can't prevent …fxe4, so reserves the option of confronting that pawn with a d2-d3 advance when it arrives on e4.

Other knight retreats (to d3 or f3) allow ...fxe4 with an attack on the knight, giving Black time to follow up with …d5 to great advantage.

Black remains a pawn down, but White's knight has run off, so Black may now dream of playing …d5 in one move. That pawn on e4 will have to be cleared out of the way first, with [[/4...fxe4/]]. (If Black delays, White will play exf5 and retain the extra pawn.)

Black threatens to play ...d5 with beautiful development and only a slightly misplaced queen to worry about. But [[/5. Nc3/]] covers d5 and gains further time by hitting the e4-pawn. Rarely do such delicate works as Black's encounter such a robust spanner as 5. Nc3.

= Latvian Gambit, Leonhardt Variation =
===5. Nc3===
White's c3-knight is threatening to capture on e4 hitting the queen on f6, and taking advantage of this diversion to retreat safely to c3. Were the queen not on f6, Black could turn the tables after Nxe4 with ...d5! picking up a knight. So the queen must move again. In the old days of the Leonhardt Variation, [[/5...Qg6/]] was the move, defending e4 and pressuring g2. The modern preference is [[/5...Qf7/]], renewing the threat of ...d5.

Black is planning ...d5 again. Now comes perhaps the only &quot;unnatural&quot; move with which a White player facing the Latvian must be familiar: [[/6. Ne3/]]. There's no other way to defend against ...d5.

= Latvian Gambit, Leonhardt Variation =
===6. Ne3===
White has seemingly thwarted ...d5 yet again, and is now asking the Black army how they're going to save Private Ryan on e4. 

There are two options for Black: abandon e4 and make another non-developing move with [[/6...c6/]] to finally establish an iron grip over d5, or continue the charge with [[/6...d5/]], the Atars Gambit, accepting the loss of the d-pawn and saddling White with only the minor inconvenience of having to come and capture it.

It should be pointed out here that, in fact, the suicidal-looking 6...d5 is one of Black's last remaining attempts to revive the Latvian Gambit. If it doesn't work, the swashbuckling old opening will likely be tucked away on a shelf with a label &quot;suitable only for unprepared opponents&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Resilience in Graph Theory ==
=== Definition ===

Sudakov and Vu (2008)&lt;ref name=&quot;Sudakov and Vu 2008&quot;&gt;Sudakov and Vu 2008,&quot;Local Resilience of Graphs&quot;. http://www.math.ucla.edu/~bsudakov/resilience.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; have proposed the most concrete definition of resilience in graph theory: if graph G has property P, what is the minimum number of edges that need to be removed so that G no longer has P?&lt;ref name &quot;Sudakov 2008&quot;&gt;Sudakov 2008&lt;/ref&gt; For example, consider the graph in figure 1 and its resilience with respect to connectivity. Removing any one edge leaves a graph that is still connected. It is necessary to remove two edges to produce a graph that is not connected (figure 2).  Thus, we could say that this graph has a resilience of 2 with respect to connectivity. Note that this does not mean that removing any two edges will destroy connectivity in this graph. Figure 3 demonstrates the possibility of removing two edges while leaving the graph connected.

&lt;gallery perrow=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
File:Resilience-figure.001.png|Figure 1
File:Resilience-figure.002.png|Figure 2
File:Resilience-figure.003.png|Figure 3
&lt;/gallery&gt;

Under this definition, a given graph will have different values of resilience with respect to different properties. As a result the definition is concrete but flexible, and can be usefully applied to real-world networks where properties are of variable importance from different perspectives.

Some discussions of resilience focus on vertex removal rather than edge removal. The effect of removing a vertex on the rest of the network is equivalent to the effect of removing all edges attached to that vertex.

=== Edge Removal Methods: Random and Targeted ===
The example above highlights the difference between random edge removal and targeted edge removal. If edges are removed randomly, a property might survive the removal of many edges. Targeted edge removal implies that the graph is analyzed and edges are chosen which will achieve the minimum. &lt;ref name=&quot;Newman 2003&quot;&gt;Newman 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Resilience of Scale-Free Graphs ===
The effect on the network of either type of edge removal depends in part on degree distribution. Graphs following a power-law distribution (scale-free) tend to be highly resilient to random edge removal, because there is a very good chance that the edges removed will connect only low-degree vertices and therefore the overall graph structure will be affected only slightly. They are much more vulnerable, however, to targeted removal of edges attached to high-degree nodes, and especially to the removal of those nodes themselves. In scale-free graphs, these high-degree vertices are critical in connecting subgraphs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Newman 2003&quot;/&gt;

=== Resilience and Vulnerability ===
A graph with a low resilience with respect to a property can lose that property as a result of only a few edge removals. We can say that the graph is vulnerable with respect to that property.

But this is only part of a complete consideration of vulnerability. The other half has to do with the effect on the network’s performance if the property in question has been lost, and is discussed under [[Transportation Geography and Network Science/Reliability]].

== Resilience of Transportation Networks ==
[[File:Resilience-figure.004.png|thumb|Figure 4]]
In graph theory, resilience is a binary concept: an edge either exists or it does not; a graph either has a property or it does not. In real-world transportation networks, links have additional properties such as capacity and cost. We can apply the concepts of resilience to transportation networks by considering the effects of changes in link properties on properties of the overall network.
[[File:Resilience-figure.005.png|thumb|Figure 5]]
For example, consider the network in figure 4, where the nodes represent cities and the links represent freight rail lines. Each link has a cost representing the time required to traverse it, in hours. It is a property of the network that there exists a path from A to D whose total cost is 10 hours or less. Now imagine some event occurs which increases the cost of the A-D link by 50%, to 15. The exact nature of the event is irrelevant; it could be a snowstorm, fatigued rails, or a government-imposed speed limit. This event was sufficient to destroy the network’s property of having an A-D path of cost 10 or less.

However, it did not destroy the network’s property of connectivity; A and D are still connected (though at a higher path cost). When evaluating the resiliency of a transportation network, it is important to keep in mind that the network will have different levels of resiliency with respect to different properties.

===Improving Resilience===
Once a network’s resilience with respect to a certain property has been evaluated, it is often desirable to improve the resilience. This can be achieved in two fundamental ways: by adding redundancy or by over-provisioning existing links. (Bell 2000, Intro)

====Redundancy====
Imagine that we could reduce the cost of links A-B and C-D from 8 to 6, as shown in figure 5. This improved network has three node-independent paths from A to D of cost 10 or less. If the same event happens to this network, the property will not be destroyed. Destroying the same property in the improved network requires more changes that it did in the original network. Therefore we can say that the improved network is more resilient with respect to this property.

====Over-provisioning====
A link is over-provisioned if it has more capacity than needed to handle normal levels of traffic. This &quot;reserve capacity&quot; can help the link, and therefore the overall network, maintain adequate levels of performance when link capacity is degraded. Capacity will still be reduced, but may remain able to provide a desired level of service. In our example, we can represent over-provisioning by upgrading the A-D link so that its initial cost is 6. The same event increasing its cost by 50% will now result in a cost of 9 hours — still less than the desired service level of 10 hours.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Exercise 7 ==

Is it really a good idea to encourage readers to implement their own sorting algorithm, without a discussion of why this is a bad idea in general? If the aim is to build the reader's understanding of static arrays, rather than to teach Algorithms 101, perhaps it would be better to specify a sorting algorithm in pseudocode. --[[User:Fishpi|Fishpi]] ([[User talk:Fishpi|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Fishpi|contribs]]) 17:16, 15 February 2011 (UTC)

:Isn't it covered on the theory side of the book ? If not you can add that information, you can also like to a Wikibook on algorithms or the Wikipedia page (but I thing it may have a solution included). Probably looking into the STL implementation (add the required information on the algorithm and link to that section) this would address all your issues...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 22:57, 16 November 2011 (UTC)

== Exercise 7 mistakes==

It has been a long time without programming, and actually this is the first time I find myself programming in C++ (for teaching a friend), but I think there are some mistakes on the sorting exercise (1st selection algorithm and bubble sorting). I had to change one of the operators in the second &quot;for&quot;. I've replaced the &lt;&lt; by &lt; in order to avoid a segmentation fault. At the moment I am not 100% sure of what &lt;&lt; does, but I am quite sure that its functionality is not what is needed there.

On the other hand, there were two lines in the 2nd selection algorithm that wouldn't work with my compiler (g++ on linux). These are:

system(&quot;pause&quot;);
fflush(stdin);

Both things are lines of code stated as to be avoid in C/C++ programming as you can check easily running a quick search on any searching engine. I don't see the need of pausing the program before exiting (and not at all using a function that is not C/C++ standard but a function of the OS, so not portable). And the fflush one, as you can check on the Internet, is absolutely pointless.

Obviously I might be wrong making any of these points, but at the moment I am quite sure they are all mistakes.

What do you think?

Thanks for the wiki anyway. It is being quite helpful for me :-)

[[User:Vicisbue|Vicisbue]] ([[User talk:Vicisbue|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Vicisbue|contribs]]) 21:30, 16 November 2011 (UTC)

:The system(&quot;pause&quot;) would disqualify the proposed solution. I have to look at the example, so I'm talking without looking (I will give it a closer look as I have time) fflush(stdin) may be necessary if the code uses the stdin to read the input since the pause requires a return (it would cause issues in a loop). I would appreciate if you moved that non compilable solution to a new section to be fixed (see the top of the exercises as example). You do not need to give clues to the problems and/or you could yourself take to the job of fixing it as an exercise :) . The &lt;&lt; is explained in the theory section of the book.
:As you go through the exercises do the same for others you find that do not compile, take the right input or give the proper solution. Thanks for the help.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 22:54, 16 November 2011 (UTC)</text>

:Hi there,

*I go to [[m:Meetup/London/42|Wikipedia London Meet ups]]
*I went to [[M:Wikimania 2010|Wikimania 2010]]

I am a Russian teacher who has lived in London over 20 years. Together with family and friends [http://www.youtube.com/user/LearnRussianLanguage we make videos to help students learn Russian].

I started making my first site in January 2010 [http://www.learnrussianspeakrussian.org/ LearnRussianSpeakRussian.org]. However I realised that I need other teachers to help me and therefore I have remade the site as wiki, so other teachers can help me to teach Russian and the students can ask us their questions. I have opened the [http://www.facebook.com/home.php?sk=group_186939257983333 LearnRussianSpeakRussian.org facebook group] and we started to make translations of the site into different languages. We want to use the [[w:en:Direct_method_%28education%29|direct method of teaching]], we are teaching Russian in Russian.

I started to make [http://wikitranslate.org WikiTranslate.org] to enable language students (of any language) to make translations of folk songs, fairy-tales, cartoons and prayers, etc. from a [[w:en:Target_language|target language]] to their native language (any language as well) and other way around. I want this site to help students to learn a new language and teachers to teach thier language. I hope that in the process of this work the users of this wiki will make friends and start having conversations not only on the wiki site, but on skype, etc. I have opened [http://www.facebook.com/home.php?sk=group_161671873864536 WikiTranslate.org facebook group].

We have made translations and voiceovers for the Russian fairy-tale [http://wikitranslate.org/wiki/%D0%9A%D1%83%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%87%D0%BA%D0%B0_%D1%80%D1%8F%D0%B1%D0%B0 Курочка ряба] into [http://wikitranslate.org/wiki/%D0%9A%D1%83%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%87%D0%BA%D0%B0_%D1%80%D1%8F%D0%B1%D0%B0/en:_English English], [http://wikitranslate.org/wiki/%D0%9A%D1%83%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%87%D0%BA%D0%B0_%D1%80%D1%8F%D0%B1%D0%B0/fr:_French French], [http://wikitranslate.org/wiki/%D0%9A%D1%83%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%87%D0%BA%D0%B0_%D1%80%D1%8F%D0%B1%D0%B0/it:_Italian Italian], [http://wikitranslate.org/wiki/%D0%9A%D1%83%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%87%D0%BA%D0%B0_%D1%80%D1%8F%D0%B1%D0%B0/el:_Greek Greek], etc. We want to translate all the fairy-tales of the world!

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Wet weather driving''' is the operation of a motor vehicle in the rain, snow, sleet and fog.  It is considerably more dangerous than motor vehicle operation in dry conditions.  While driving through snow, many drivers slow down, limit distractions and drive carefully.  However, in the rain and fog, people do not take the same precautions, leading to thousands of accidents a year in the United States alone.  Most of these accidents are preventable; caused by drivers who fail to realize that wet weather driving is fundamentally different than dry weather driving.

== Road hazards ==
Road debris and other hazards contribute to potential problems.

=== Engine oil and grease build up on the roads ===
Over time, grease and engine oil can build up on road surfaces, especially roads that are frequently used such as interstate and state highways.&lt;ref name=ed&gt;{{cite web |author=Kim, Liz, and Joanne Helperin |title=Tips and Techniques for Driving in Rain |work=Edmunds.com |url=http://www.edmunds.com/ownership/safety/articles/45401/article.html |accessdate=February 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The longer the roads are dry, the longer oil and grease have to build up. When the roads are dry, this is not a problem, however, when the rain starts to fall, it brings this oil and grease up to the surface and it rises above the water coating the road.  This makes the wet conditions even more dangerous.&lt;ref name=ed/&gt;  Although this oil and grease is washed away after a few hours of rain, those first few hours are critical. The stopping distance for a car traveling at 50mph is 65m.&lt;ref name=ed/&gt;

=== Crowned roads ===
In the United States, most roads are crowned, or built so that the center of the road is slightly higher than the sides.&lt;ref name=ed/&gt;  The purpose of crowning is to allow rain to run off the roads.  However, in many cases, especially in the spring, sand from winter plowings and dead leaves build up along the sides of the roads, trapping the water and preventing natural runoff.  This creates puddles on the roadsides, which can lead to hydroplaning and spray that obstructs a driver's view.&lt;ref name=ed/&gt;

=== Puddles and cross-running water ===
[[Image:hydroplaning.svg|thumb|300px|right|A hydroplaning tire.]]

A puddle may hide a very large pothole that can damage a tire or an electrical component.&lt;ref name=ed/&gt;&lt;ref name=mob/&gt; A puddle may also splash a large quantity of water up onto the windshield and obscure vision for an extended period depending on the puddle size.   Another danger of puddles is hydroplaning, when the tires lose contact with the road and instead ride on a pocket of water. This makes the vehicle very hard to control as it loses traction with the road and prevents the vehicle from steering, braking, or accelerating.  

Running water may also be dangerous when driven through.  If the current is powerful enough, it can push the car off of the road.

== Vehicle Hazards ==
=== Window Fog ===
When it is raining, the windshield and other windows may quickly fog up, obscuring the driver’s vision. Window defoggers can eliminate the problem.&lt;ref name=ed/&gt;&lt;ref name=mob&gt;{{cite web |author=Clemens, Kevin |title=Safer Wet-Weather Driving |work=Mobil 1 |url=http://www.mobiloil.com/usa-english/motoroil/car_care/notes_from_the_road/safer_wet-weather_driving.aspx?pg=1 |accessdate=February 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many rear windshield defoggers consist of wires that run across the glass.  When the defogger is activated, these wires heat up to clear the fog from the glass.&lt;ref name=mob/&gt;

=== Balding and Improperly Inflated Tires ===
Over time, tires lose their tread in a process that is generally known as balding. Tires will all wear down over time, although aggressive driving and alignment problems can speed up the process.  The tire tread is what allows the tire to grip the road and take away water on a wet road, and a vehicle that lacks adequate tread has a greater risk of [hydroplaning] on wet surfaces.  Tires should have a tread of at least 1/16 of an inch, anything less and it is time to replace it.  A trick to see if the tire in question has enough tread is to stick a Lincoln penny into the tire tread, with Lincoln’s head pressed into the grove.  If the top of Lincoln’s head is visible it means there is not enough tread.&lt;ref name=geek&gt;{{cite web |title=What are Bald Tires? |work=Wisegeek |url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-are-bald-tires.htm |accessdate=February 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tires that are not properly inflated are also a driving hazard that is magnified in wet road conditions, and are at risk of blowing out should the car go into a skid.&lt;ref name=geek/&gt;

=== Braking Power/Stopping Distances ===
Average Dry Stopping Distance (Assuming two-thirds of a second reaction time):&lt;ref name=dist&gt;{{cite web |author=Wren, Eddie |title=Stopping Distances |work= Drive and Stay Alive |url=http://www.driveandstayalive.com/info%20section/stopping-distances.htm |date=August 2004 |accessdate=February 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the road is wet, the average stopping distance for a five passenger automobile is twice what it is on a dry road. Coupled with poor visibility, which can lengthen the time the driver takes to react, the stopping distances may be even larger.  Therefore, drivers should position themselves twice as far away from the vehicle in front of them.

=== Water buildup on brakes === 
After driving through a puddle, brake rotors can become coated with water that can affect their ability to safely slow the car.  In order to prevent this from happening, the driver should lightly tap the brakes after each puddle; this removes the excess water and ensures that the brakes will be there when they are needed.&lt;ref name=ed/&gt;

=== Windshield wipers ===
The largest factor that affects driver visibility in the rain is the windshield wipers. Older wipers tend to become cracked and brittle after long periods of use, lasting only six months to a year in areas with frequent rain.  However, wipers do not last forever even if they do not get much use.  They can become brittle and warped by the sun, rendering them useless in heavy rain.  There are several indicators that the wipers need to be replaced including: windshield streaking, windshield smearing, rubber that flakes off when touched, wiper screeching, and frayed wipers.

Philadelphia: Research Studies Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This definition is useful but general: any specific measure of reliability will depend on the nature of the desired function and what levels of performance are acceptable. As a result, a wide range of both definitions and measures of reliability have been proposed, each designed for application to a specific type of transportation network or a specific network function.

==Measures of Reliability in Transportation Networks==

===Terminal Reliability===
Terminal reliability measures the probability that a transportation network can perform a very basic function: providing a path — any path, regardless of cost — from an origin to a destination. To determine this measure, each link in a network is assigned a functional probability x that represents the likelihood that the link will function at any given time. This will be 1 if the link always functions and 0 if it never functions; intermediate values of x denote links that function x% of the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nicholson et al 2003&quot;&gt;Nicholson, A. J., Schmöcker, J-D., Bell, M. G. H., &amp; Iida, Y. (2003). Assessing transport reliability: Malevolence and user knowledge. In Bell, M. G. H., &amp; Iida, Y. (Eds.), ''The network reliability of transport'' (pp. 1-22). Oxford: Elsevier Science.&lt;/ref&gt;

These probabilities can be combined logically. In order for any single path to function, all of the links in that path must function. Since basic probability theory shows that P(A∩B)=P(A)×P(B), the probability that a single path will function is the product of the probabilities of all links in that path. In the case where the origin and destination are connected by more than one path, the network will function as long as any one path functions. Since P(A∪B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A∩B), the probability that the origin and destination are connected can be calculated after establishing the functional probability of each possible path.&lt;ref name=&quot;Berdica 2002&quot;&gt;Berdica, K. (2002). An introduction to road vulnerability: what has been done, is done and should be done Transport Policy, 9 (2), 117-127 DOI: 10.1016/S0967-070X(02)00011-2&lt;/ref&gt;

As an example, imagine a national rail network where each link is closed for maintenance two days out of every year. Scheduling of maintenance is handled separately by regional authorities, and a national coordinator wants to evaluate the chance that specific pairs of destinations might become disconnected at some point in a year due to maintenance closures. He assigns each link a functional probability of 363/365 = 99.45%, identifies the possible paths between the points of interest, and applies the logic above to evaluate the reliability of each path and then of the connection.

===Travel Time Reliability===
Travel time reliability refers to the probability that a trip from an origin to a destination can be made in a specific time, or within a given range of times. It is used most often on networks where travel demand fluctuations are to some degree random, such as road networks and other multi-user networks. Travel time reliability should not be confused with delays caused by predictable variations. For example, queues due to bottleneck congestion in the fixed demand case. 

Most treatments of travel time reliability establish a baseline travel time through observation and then evaluate how different sources of uncertainty will affect actual travel times. The measured reliability is the probability that the baseline travel time plus uncertainty will be less than a desired value. Uncertainty is generated by two fundamental source: demand variation and capacity variation. Most attempts at describing travel time reliability have been based on the variation of travel time under normal daily (or other cyclical) usage variations. In these studies, each link is generally assumed to offer a normally-distributed range of travel times. These link travel time distributions are combined to compute the probability distribution of travel times for an entire path.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nicholson et al 2003&quot;/&gt; &lt;ref name=&quot;Berdica 2002&quot;/&gt;

Travel time reliability is analyzed from two approaches: Scheduling Delays with uncertainty, and Mean-Variance. The first assumes travelers have a preferred arrival time, and thus variations around this time time may be classified as schedule early or late delays. The second assumes an average travel time (mean) for the travelers, and variations around this time are classified as variance. Both approaches may be equal under some circumstances &lt;ref&gt;Carrion, C. and Levinson, D. (2011), Value of Reliability: A review of current evidence&lt;/ref&gt;

===Capacity Reliability===
Capacity reliability measures the probability that the network can handle a specific amount of demand. It can also be viewed as the probability that a network use will be able to complete a trip without encountering a degraded or over-capacity link. In this sense it is a refinement of terminal reliability, which considers neither link capacity nor user demand and link selection.

Proposed calculations of capacity reliability begin estimating a network’s reserve capacity, which represents the volume of traffic the network can handle above some baseline without reaching its maximum capacity or exceeding some defined service level. Existing studies have modeled reserve capacity as a multiplier applied to the baseline traffic volume. Simulation techniques are then applied to model network users’ responses to degraded links, rerouting network flow as links begin to reach capacity. &lt;ref name=&quot;Nicholson et al 2003&quot;/&gt; &lt;ref name=&quot;Berdica 2002&quot;/&gt;

==Vulnerability==
Vulnerability has been treated with varying degrees of complexity. In its simplest treatment, vulnerability is effectively the inverse of reliability: as a network’s reliability decreases, its vulnerability increases and vice versa.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nicholson et al 2003&quot;/&gt;

A more complex theory of vulnerability connects the ideas of reliability and network resilience by considering how network structure mitigates or aggravates the effect of link degradation. Vulnerability is evaluated for each link in the network and reflects the degree to which network performance (by some chosen measure) is affected if a particular link is degraded. A link is highly vulnerable if a small degradation results in a large reduction of network performance.&lt;ref name=&quot;D'Este Taylor 2003&quot;&gt;D'Este, G. M., &amp; Taylor, M. A. P. (2003). Network vulnerability: An approach to reliability analysis at the level of national strategic transport networks. In Bell, M. G. H., &amp; Iida, Y. (Eds.), ''The network reliability of transport'' (pp. 1-22). Oxford: Elsevier Science.&lt;/ref&gt;

This approach to vulnerability could be extended to encompass whole-network vulnerability by computing the ratios of links in a network that have various values of vulnerability. A network with a high proportion of highly vulnerable links would be described as highly vulnerable.

Create another script called server.py:

Save server.py in the same folder as index.py, then run it : &lt;code&gt;python server.py&lt;/code&gt;. This will launch the built-in web server.

Finally, in a web browser enter the address ''h&amp;#116;tp://localhost/index.py/index''
.
Congratulations, you just ran your first Karrigell script ! The address ''index.py/index'' requested to run the function &lt;CODE&gt;index()&lt;/CODE&gt; in the script index.py. The value returned by this function is printed in the web browser.

In fact, you could have written the url ''h&amp;#116;tp://localhost/index.py'' : if no function name is specified, the function index() is run by default, with no argument.

And you could even have called ''h&amp;#116;tp://localhost'' : if no script is specified, the server searches a script called index.py and if it finds one, it executes its function index().

      <comment>Nicer layout + remove &quot;from HTMLTags import *&quot;</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">There are 3 ways you can build HTML in a script

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
==== Raw HTML ====
&lt;p&gt;The first one is to return a string with HTML tags, like this :
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;def index():
    return &quot;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;Hello world&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&quot;&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
==== Templates ====
&lt;p&gt;For a document that holds mainly static HTML, with only a few dynamic values, you can use templates. For instance, create a file called page.tmpl with:

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
Hello world
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

and save it in the same folder as index.py. Then modify index.py like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;def index():
    return Template(&quot;page.tmpl&quot;)&lt;/source&gt;

The built-in function Template is available in all the scripts managed by Karrigell. It reads the content from the file located at the relative url ''page.tmpl'' and returns it. More on the templating system later.

&lt;li&gt;
==== The HTMLTags module ====

The third way, recommended when the page is mostly made of dynamic content, is to use the HTMLTags module, included in the package :

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;def index():
    return HTML(BODY(&quot;Hello world&quot;))&lt;/source&gt;

The HTMLTags module defines classes for all valid HTML tags, in uppercase letters : the classes for tags &amp;lt;html&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;body&amp;gt; are &lt;code&gt;HTML&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;BODY&lt;/code&gt; (surprise !). These classes are available in the scripts managed by Karrigell

The function index() returns an instance of the class &lt;code&gt;HTML&lt;/code&gt;, called with an instance of the class &lt;code&gt;BODY&lt;/code&gt; ; the server returns its string representation, which is the HTML code &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;Hello world&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Edit the same script, index.py, like this :

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def index():
	form = FORM(action=&quot;show&quot;)
	form &lt;= INPUT(name=&quot;city&quot;)
	form &lt;= INPUT(Type=&quot;submit&quot;,value=&quot;Ok&quot;)
	return HTML(BODY(form))

def show(city):
	return city
&lt;/source&gt;

This script defines 2 functions, index() and show(). In index() we build an HTML form, in show() we handle the data entered in the form

In function index() we first create an HTML form with the class FORM, with the parameter &quot;action&quot; set to &quot;show&quot;, the name of the function that will handle the data entered by the user

Then we build this form with INPUT instances. For this we &quot;add a child&quot; to the FORM instance with the operator &lt;= (think of it as a left arrow, meaning &quot;add child&quot;) : first an input tag with name &quot;city&quot;, then a submit tag with value &quot;Ok&quot;. Note that the attribute &quot;type&quot; is written Type with an uppercase initial, to avoid confusion with the Python name &quot;type&quot;

When the script is called by ''h&amp;#116;tp://localhost/index.py/index'', the form is printed in the web browser. Enter a value in the input field, then click on &quot;Ok&quot; : the value in the address bar of your browser will be set to ''h&amp;#116;tp://localhost/index.py/show?city=...'', and you will see the data you entered

How does this work? The value entered in the field &quot;city&quot; is passed as the argument to the function show() - the &quot;action&quot; attribute of the form. This function just returns this value, so the browser prints it

The name of the arguments of the function that receives the HTML form must be the same as the names in the HTML form. You can also use the usual Python syntax for unspecified arguments :

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def show(**kw):
	return kw['city']
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Instead of the default GET method, form fields can be submitted with the POST method. You just have to specify it when creating the instance of FORM :

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;form = FORM(action=&quot;show&quot;,method=&quot;POST&quot;)&lt;/source&gt;

      <comment>dots at the end of sentences + prints -&gt; display + RESPONSE-HEADER -&gt; RESPONSE_HEADER</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Create another script called upload.py:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def index():
    form = FORM(action=&quot;upload&quot;,method=&quot;post&quot;,enctype=&quot;multipart/form-data&quot;)
    form &lt;= INPUT(Type=&quot;file&quot;,name=&quot;src&quot;)
    form &lt;= INPUT(Type=&quot;submit&quot;,value=&quot;Ok&quot;)
    return HTML(BODY(form))

def upload(src):
    import mimetypes
    gtype,encoding = mimetypes.guess_type(src.filename)
    RESPONSE_HEADERS['Content-type'] = gtype
    data = src.file.read()
    return data
&lt;/source&gt;

The function index() looks like the previous example. The changes are the `enctype` parameter of the FORM, set to &quot;multipart/form-data&quot;; and the type of the first INPUT field.

In the upload function, we receive the argument `src`. Since it was sent as a file inside a multipart/form-data form, this object has an attribute filename matching the name of the uploaded file ; it also has an attribute file, a file-like object with a method read() that returns bytes.

The Python module mimetypes can guess the type of this file by its extension ; for instance if the uploaded file was a JPEG image, with the extension `.jpg`, the result of mimetypes.guess_type(src.filename) will be &quot;image/pjpeg&quot;.

The line &lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;RESPONSE_HEADERS['Content-type'] = gtype&lt;/source&gt; introduces another name which is always available in Python scripts run by Karrigell : &lt;code&gt;RESPONSE_HEADERS&lt;/code&gt;. It is a dictionary-like object (in fact, an instance of class &lt;code&gt;email.message.Message&lt;/code&gt;, used to set the response headers that will be sent to the web browser. Here, the line sets the Content-type header to the type of the file received.

In the next line we read the binary data from the attribute &quot;file&quot; of src, and finally return this binary data. The Karrigell engine sends the response headers, then the binary data ; with this information, the browser renders the file content under the appropriate format : if the file was a JPEG picture, the browser displays it.

      <comment>/* Sum into product */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">In this section, we shall see how to convert a product of two trigonometric functions into a sum or difference of two such functions, and vice versa.

== Product into sum ==
We have already seen that

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \sin(A) \cos(B) + \cos(A) \sin(B) = \sin(A+B)&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \sin(A) \cos(B) - \cos(A) \sin(B) = \sin(A-B)&lt;/math&gt;.

Adding these two equations and dividing both sides by 2, we get

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \sin(A) \cos(B) = \frac{1}{2} (\sin(A+B) + \sin(A-B))&lt;/math&gt;

Subtracting the second from the first equation and dividing both sides by 2, we get

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \cos(A) \sin(B) = \frac{1}{2} (\sin(A+B) - \sin(A-B))&lt;/math&gt;

We also know that

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \cos(A) \cos(B) - \sin(A) \sin(B) = \cos(A+B)&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \cos(A) \cos(B) + \sin(A) \sin(B) = \cos(A-B)&lt;/math&gt;.

Adding these two equations and dividing both sides by 2, we get

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \cos(A) \cos(B) = \frac{1}{2} (\cos(A+B) + \cos(A-B))&lt;/math&gt;

Subtracting the first from the second equation and dividing both sides by 2, we get

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \sin(A) \sin(B) = \frac{1}{2} (\cos(A-B) - \cos(A+B))&lt;/math&gt;

Thus we can express:

# The product of a sine and cosine as the sum or difference of two sines;
# The product of two cosines as the sum of two cosines;
# The product of two sines as the difference of two sines.

== Sum into product ==

Let C = A+B and D = A-B.  Then

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle A = \frac{1}{2} (C+D); \,\,\,\, B = \frac{1}{2} (C-D)&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting into the above expressions and multiplying both sides by two in each of them, we have:

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \sin(C) + \sin(D) = 2 \sin(\frac{C+D}{2}) \cos(\frac{C-D}{2})&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \sin(C) - \sin(D) = 2 \cos(\frac{C+D}{2}) \sin(\frac{C-D}{2})&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \cos(C) + \cos(D) = 2 \cos(\frac{C+D}{2}) \cos(\frac{C-D}{2})&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \cos(C) - \cos(D) = -2 \sin(\frac{C+D}{2}) \sin(\frac{C-D}{2})&lt;/math&gt;

Note the negative sign in the last formula.

These formulae are sometimes expressed in words, e.g.

:cos plus cos = two cos half sum cos half diff.

      <comment>/* Clinical assessment */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Substance use disorders or SUDs encompass a spectrum of conditions varying in severity from problematic use, abuse and varying grades of  mild to more severe dependence. Over the last half century, various drug use epidemics have characterised different population groups worldwide. As the knowledge base of clinical neuroscience has expanded, the understanding of these disorders has developed from being viewed as a moral weakness to being viewed as complex biomedical disorders affecting the brain and manifesting clinically as chronic relapsing disorders. In addition, research has demonstrated equivalent rates of relapse for addictive disorders and non-compliance to treatment for medical disorders such as hypertension and diabetes.

=== Epidemiology ===

Trends in substance use vary from country to country and fluctuations occur in the prevalence rates across time periods. Epidemiology investigates the distribution and determinants of substance use disorders; as well as patterns of drug use over time and its association with age, gender and associated risk factors. Epidemiologists use various definitions for substance use and substance use disorders. Definitions of substance use can vary from substance use once in past month or year, life time use or use characterised by the fully developed syndrome of addiction. Life time prevalence refers to fulfilling the criteria for a specified pattern of use(i.e., abuse or dependence) at least once in a person’s lifetime. Depending on the nature of substance use disorders, the chronicity and the related mortality rates, prevalence and incidence rates can differ markedly. For example, due to the chronic nature of drug dependence, the prevalence rates of substance dependence can be significantly higher than incidence rates. Period prevalence measures, such as past year prevalence, records the rate of patients fulfilling diagnostic criteria over the past year form the total population at risk. 

Prevalence: 
  
&lt;u&gt;Total number of cases at time/period&lt;u&gt;

Total population at risk at time/period

Incidence measures refer to the occurrence of newly diagnosed cases over a specified time period. Cumulative incidence or the incidence proportion is usually expressed as the total number of new cases per 10 000 or 100 000 patients over a period of time i.e., over a five year period. Alternatively, incidence rates or density can also be expressed as the number of new cases occurring in the at risk population, over the total number of person years of observation.             
                                                             
Incidence:    

&lt;u&gt;Number of new cases over period of time&lt;u&gt;
              
Total population at risk (without the disease) over period of time

Most large epidemiological samples across countries have found that men are at least 2-3 times  more likely than  women to use illicit substances and develop substance use disorders such as abuse or dependence (Brady and Randall, 1999). In addition, whereas men start using drugs at a younger age and take longer to develop full blown dependency syndromes; women tend to develop problems with addiction later in life, but develop severe problems more rapidly. However, there is evidence of a trend toward lower differences in substance misuse rates, particularly alcohol abuse, in younger age cohorts; and between males and females in the context of more equal and less traditional gender roles (Grant, 1996; Seedat et al. 2009). Certain religious and ethnic groups also show differential patterns of use. In the UK Afro Caribbean’s and in the US black patients are less likely to abuse alcohol and illicit drugs.

In the National Comorbidity Replication Study (NCS-R)(Kessler et al. 2005), conducted between 2001-2003, the lifetime prevalence for alcohol abuse in the general US population was 13.2% and for alcohol dependence 5.4%. Lifetime drug abuse had a lifetime prevalence of 7.9% whereas dependence had a prevalence of 3 %. 

Within the United States certain patterns of epidemics in the use of illicit substances have emerged over the past 30 years. Whereas cannabis use peaked in the mid 1970’s, there has been a decline in the early to mid 1990’s but a rapid upsurge in the mid 1990’s. The cocaine use epidemic reached a peak in the early to mid 1980’s and has been followed by a stimulant use epidemic dawning in the late early to mid 1990’s. Since the start of the new millennium an upsurge in methamphetamine use has plagued many countries among who include the USA, Japan, Australia, South East Asia, Eastern Europe and South Africa. 

Epidemiological studies identified different developmental trends in the age of onset of first drug use to the development of dependence. Cocaine dependence follows a risk trajectory of average age of onset of use in early 20’s with a comparatively higher cumulative risk of developing dependence than other substances of up to 15-16% in the 10 years following the onset of first use. Whereas the high risk periods for development of dependence for illicit drugs after first use are confined to the late teen years for drugs such as cannabis, early twenties thorough to the early 30’s for cocaine, risk of the developing  alcohol dependence continues throughout later life (Wagner and Anthony, 2002).
Despite stringent drug legislation and law enforcement, substantive evidence that such measures are effective have not been forthcoming

=== Pathogenesis === 

==== Biological Factors ====
===== Neuroanatomy and pathophysiology =====

The syndrome of drug dependence occurs as a result of a complex interplay of a variety biological mechanisms as well as psychological and social factors. Dependence is characterised by repeated use of a substance resulting that ultimately results in state of neural adaptation in the brain. Various drugs of abuse act on different receptor subsystems with many of these systems  converging onto to the final common pathway involved in reward seeking behaviours, the mesolimbic dopamenergic pathway (Kalivas and Volkow, 2005; Koob and Volkow, 2009). Altogether a number of neuro-anatomical circuits are involved in the pathophysiology of addiction. These include:

a) The Reward-Seeking system consisting primarily mesolimbic dopamenergic pathway and its subcomponents. This pathway stretches from the cell bodies of the dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area of the brainstem (substantia nigra) which project their axons onto the nucleus accumbens in the ventral striatum. Pulsatile stimulation of these dopaminergic neurons result in highly a pleasurable sensations

b) The prefrontal cortex subcomponents are thought to be involved in impulse regulation and modulation of reward seeking behaviour. These components include the OFC orbitofrontal cortex, the DLPFC, and the ventro-medial cortex (VMC) as well as the loop circuits that stretch from the frontal cortex through the striatum to the thalamus and back to the cortex (cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical circuits or CSTCC). These circuits that  traverse the dorsal aspects of the striatum are also implicated in the compulsive aspects of drug addiction.

c) The extended amygdala (consisting of the central nucleus of the amygdala, the Bed Nuleus of the striae terminalis and the shell of the nAcc) and its connections with the VTA and Nu Accumbens, plays an important role in learning and conditioning of behaviours related to drug use.. The extended amygdala is sensitive to stress hormones such as cortisol, and plays a potentially important role in the triggering of relapses into drug taking behaviour caused by environmental and intrapsychic stressors.

d) The basolateral cortical amygdala. This structure represents the neocortical cellular layers of the amygdala and is thought to play an important role in environmental cue detection. This structure is therefore potentially important in cue induced drug taking behaviours. People, places and objects such as drug paraphranelia that has become conditioned with drug taking can potentially lead to stimulation this anatomical area to induce relapses.

e) Memory systems in the hippocampal formation, involved in the memory consolidation of events associated with substance use. This system is interconnected among others with the extended amygdala.

===== Pathophysiology: Substance binge/intoxication phase and type 1 craving (Stage I addiction) =====

The initial use of substances, in particular psychostimulants such as cocaine and methamphetamine, is associated with a surge in dopamine release in the mesolimbic dopaminergic pathway. The principal neurotransmitter in the reward pathway is dopamine which binds to D1 and D2 receptors. Whereas drug like cocaine and amphetamines result in a direct surge of dopamine release at dopaminergic synapses (via Dopamine re-uptake-DRI- inhibition in case of cocaine and increased release in case of amphetamines) other substances such as opoids and alcohol and cannabis are thought to indirectly result in increased dopamine release after affecting brain stem mu opoid, GABA inhibitory interneurions and CB1 (cannabinoid type one) receptors. In addition to the effects mediated indirectly via the dopaminargic system on learning, conditioning and reward-motivation, non stimulant drugs such opiates, cannabis and alcohol also exert effects on the glutamatergic, serotonergic, and cannabinoid systems that have been postulated to be crticial in the pathophysiology of addictive syndromes, independent of the effects of the dopaminergic system. The basolateral and extended amygadala is associated with craving, also known as type I craving, characterised by operant conditioning in the form of positive reinforcement of drug taking behaviour paired with rewarding sensations as well as classical conditioning by the pairing of neutral stimuli with the drug of abuse.

===== Pathophysiology: Withdrawal and protracted withdrawal/type 2 craving (Stage II addiction)=====

Prolonged use of a substance results in a state of neuroadaptation. Human Imaging studies have revealed decreased dopamine uptake activity in frontal striatal areas associated with chronic drug use. This downregulation of dopaminergic function results in a dampened reward system and the clinical phenomenon of tolerance. In addition repeated use and binging activates the hypothalamic pituitary axis (HPA axis) driven stress response and hormones such as corticotrophin releasing hormone (CRF) are mobilized. Anti stress hormones such as neuropeptide Y (NPY) levels also decrease. The activation of the stress response is has also been conceptualized as an anti-reward system.   Whereas the presence of the substance is experienced as pleasurable the withdrawal is experienced as unpleasant and anhedonia frequently characterises protracted withdrawal states. In contrast to the positive emotional state of intoxication, withdrawal is associated with a negative emotional state. These negative emotional states are thought to drive increased drug taking. Increased drug use associated with stress/negative emotional states is termed type 2 craving or negative reinforcement (Koob, 2009).

===== Pathophysiology: Relapsing recurring stage (Stage III addiction)=====

In addition to neuro-adaptation at transmitter and receptor level, intracellular molecular changes also occur during the state of drug dependence. These include the activation of transcription factors such as CREB (cAMP response element binding protein) and delta Fosb. These transcription factors in turn lead to the switching on of genes that code for neurotransmitter receptors, enzymes involved in the synthesis of neurotransmitters and  to altered neurotransmitter receptor numbers (up or down regulation). Increased cAMP in the nucleus accumbens associated with opoid, cocaine and alcohol use has also been linked to increased expression of the kappa opioid receptor that bind to the dysphoria inducing hormone dynorphine. This mechanism is thought to underlie the development of tolerance and is associated with the negative emotional state characterising withdrawal of the substance of abuse (Hyman, 2005). These molecular changes establish addiction and drive the relapsing and recurrent nature of addition.

===== Pathophysiology: Genetic vulnerability =====

Research into the genetics of alcohol dependence based on family, twin, and adoption studies have revealed that the heritability of alcohol dependence can be as high as 60%-80%. Genome wide association studies have implicated a number of genes in the development of alcoholism. In particular genes involved in the metabolism of alcohol are thought to play an important role. Asian populations are known to have low rates of alcoholism in comparison to Europeans. Persons from Asian descent experience highly unpleasant reactions upon alcohol ingestion such as severe nausea, flushing and tachycardia. This reaction is due to a rapid accumulation of the toxic breakdown and accumulation of the alcohol metabolite, acetaldehyde. This clinical observation lead to a search for associations with enzymes such as alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) that converts alcohol into acetaldehyde and acetaldeyhe dehydrogenase which converts acetaldehyde to acetate. This  search has revealed that variants in the alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) genes on chromosomes 4q and 12q respectively, are implicated. A variant of the ADH gene, ADH1B on chromosome 4q that encodes for a more robust ADH enzyme leading to higher levels of the toxic metabolite acetaldehyde, has been shown to protect against alcoholism in a Chinese population, reducing the rate of alcoholism with up to 80%. In turn a variant of the ALDH2 gene on chromosome 12q that produces weaker acetaldehyde dehydrogenase enzymes have been shown to reduce alcoholism with up to 67% in heterozygous subjects. As alcohol is an agonist on GABAA receptors, a search for genes encoding for the GABA receptor has revealed a strong relationship between alcoholism and the GABRA2 subunit gene on chromosome 4p that encodes for the ?2 subunit of the GABAA receptor. The GABAA receptor plays an important role in mediating the effects of alcohol intoxication as well as withdrawal (Hartz and Bierut, 2010).

Nicotine dependence carries a heritability estimated as high as 75%. Strong associations have been found between nicotine dependence and variants of genes coding for nicotinic cholinergic receptors (nAChR’s). In particular the gene CHRNA5, coding for the ?5 subunit of the nicotinic cholinergic receptor has been implicated. This gene is located on chromosome 15q. Nicotinic cholinergic receptors are distributed in the striatum on dopaminergic neurons and interact with these neurons in the  dopaminergic reward pathways. In turn the CHRNA5 gene has also been implicated in cocaine dependence (Hartz and Bierut, 2010). 
Of recent interest has been the study of potential gene environment (GxE) interactions in the development of addictive disorders. Whereas many of these findings represent non specific risk factors for a variety of psychiatric disorders, they are also likely to play a role in addictive disorders. Gene environment interaction studies have demonstrated interactions between variants of genes such as the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR) short and long variants and childhood maltreatment and negative family relations; the monoamine oxidase (MAOA-LPR) gene and childhood maltreatment and sexual abuse, as well as the GABRA2 gene and marital status. Although the findings of GXE studies are intriguing, many of these studies await replication(van der Zwaluw and Engels, 2009).

==== Psychological Factors ====

===== Learning, conditioning and cognitive factors =====

The development of drug dependence is driven by two different types of associative learning behavioural psychologists refer to as classical and operant conditioning.

Classical (or Pavlovian conditioning-referring to Pavlov’s experiments with dogs) consists of the repeated pairing of a neutral stimulus with a particular stimulus (uncontioned stimulus) that elicits a physiological, reflexive response (unconditioned response) such as activation of salivary glands or activation of a sexual response. With repeated co-administration of the unconditioned stimulus with the neutral or conditioned stimulus the neutral stimulus becomes a conditioned stimulus (CS) and elicits a conditioned response (CR).  People, places and objects associated with the drug use can become conditioned to elicit conditioned responses such as craving before using and therefore reactivate substance seeking behaviour. 

Operant conditioning refers to a positive or negative reward that follows certain behaviour such as taking a drug. Thus the euphoriant effects of a drug will positively reinforce drug taking behaviour. Negative affective states associated with the absence of drug taking behaviour or withdrawal become a negative reinforce that also increase further substance use behaviours.

In addition to behavioural factors, cognitive styles of persons with addictions can also perpetuate addictive behaviours. Dysfunctional and irrational beliefs about drug taking, triggered by environmental cues or intrapsychic stressors, can also lead to craving and consequent relapses into drug taking cycles. These beliefs may include thoughts such as &quot;I cannot socialize without drinking,&quot; &quot;I need some drugs to enjoy myself,&quot; &quot;I am able to control my drinking,&quot; &quot;there is  no life for me without drugs, as I am essentially a bad person.&quot;

===== Cycle of change and motivation =====

Prochaska and Diclemente have forwarded the cycle of change model of addiction (DiClemente et al. 2004). This model forms a useful framework of understanding motivation to change and forms the basis for motivational enhancement therapy. According to this model patients cycle through a number of stages throughout a recovery process. Patients can enter or exit at any stage of this cycle. These stages are:

a) Precontemplation stage: a stage where drugs are not considered problematic and dependence on the substance is denied.

b) Contemplation stage: Ambivalence is developed where the negative impacts of substances are weighed up against the perceived benefits, and change is contemplated.

c) Preparation: During this phase the person devises a plan for implementing change and strengthens their motivation to commit to such a plan
c) Determination: The client is determined to seek help

d) Action: Advice is followed and a rehabilitation plan is followed

e) Maintenance phase: triggers for use are identified and new coping strategies are learnt, leading to a new lifestyle.

f) Relapse: Relapse into substance taking behaviour are viewed not in a negative light but as positive learning experiences for the future.
Clients can cycle back and forth through these stages and recycle through these stages until a level of completion is reached that allows for a sustained change. Researchers also differentiate between readiness for change and readiness to engage in treatment. Whereas a client may show behaviours indicating a readiness to change, this does not necessarily translate into a willingness to follow a specific treatment program. Self-efficacy, the degree of confidence a client has in their ability to effect changes, plays an important role in shaping motivation and low self-efficacy can be an important predictor of relapse.

===== Understanding the psychodynamics of addiction =====

Although unmodified psychodynamic techniques play a limited direct role the treatment of most persons with addictions, psychodynamic  theory is useful in understanding the behaviour and family interactions that characterise the lives of people with addiction. Psychodynamic understanding is also useful in informing other therapeutic modalities such as CBT, MET, and group therapy. Comorbidity with various personality disorders is common in patients with addictions, with as many as 73% of addicts receiving a diagnosis of a co-occuring personality disorder, a prevalence rate several times that in psychiatric patients or persons without any psychiatric disorder. The most common personality disorders are borderline and antisocial personality disorders with the later particularly prevalent in individuals with alcohol use disorders (Verheul, 2001).

The self medication hypothesis advanced by Khantzian has been put forward to explain substance taking behaviour (Khantzian, 1997). According to these theory patient abuse substances to aid in the regulation of strong affects and painful emotions that the person may experience as overwhelming. Furthermore the good, euphoriant effects of substances are used as a substitute for deficient positive affirmation of the self by significant others in the person’s past, leading to low self esteem and deficits in self care.

During the early stages of precontemplation and contemplation where substance dependence may not be considered problematic by the client, primitive ego defences characterise the defensive style of the individual. These defences include denial of the addiction, splitting objects, family members and loved ones into all good or bad and projective identification whereby family members often unconsciously identify with distressing internal self-representations that have been projected onto others by the client and therefore either become the good, &quot;benevolent rescuer” or the &quot;punitive, bad family member.&quot;

A subjective sense of overwhelming powerlessness characterises persons with addictions. Together with the roles of benevolent rescuer and malevolent punisher, feelings of helplessness are often projected onto family members who unconsciously identify with this sense of loss of control and power and may defensively insist on unhelpful, inappropriately restrictive and even punitive measures. Important distinction therefore need to be made between setting limits (a desirable therapeutic measure) and punishment (undesirable and may worsen the addiction) as well as rescuing behaviour which will take away the effects of the substance use on the lies of the addicted individual and absolve them of responsibility and therefore further enable substance taking behaviour. 
In addition to more primitive defences, more mature, neurotic defences such as rationalization and intellectualization also characterise certain individuals with addictive disorders. With substance use disorders, particularly higher are functioning personalities with more mature and neurotic defensive personality structures.

=== Phenomenology ===

==== Symptoms and classification ====

The term addiction is not formally endorsed by the DSM-IV-TR or ICD-10 diagnostic classifications. A proposed revision to the DSM-IV-TR is that this term be reintroduced to differentiate benign dependence states on medication such as antidepressants and beta blockers from malignant and dysfunctional states that characterise drug and alcohol dependence. The term &quot;addiction&quot; is sometimes used interchangeably with the category described in diagnostic systems as substance dependence. The syndrome of substance dependence or addiction develops over time with repeated use of the substance and is accompanied by neuro-adaptive changes in the brain. The diagnosis of a substance use disorder is made clinically through patient and collateral interview and is based on a clustering together of various symptoms. The most used diagnostic systems used to diagnose addiction are the DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association, 2005) and the ICD-10 (World Health Organization Geneva, 1992). See table X for the ICD-10 diagnostic criteria. These systems of disease classification sets out specified operational criteria that need to be present before a diagnosis can be made of drug abuse or dependence. Laboratory tests for substance use disorders can be used as confirmatory tool where the reliability of self report or collateral sources of information is questionable. 

Substance abuse (as it is referred to in the DSM-IV) or harmful use (as referred to in the ICD-10) consists of the presence of behaviour whilst under the influence of the effects of a substance that result in adverse social,  psychological, legal or physical consequences to the person involved. (See table 2 for ICD-10 Diagnostic Research Criteria) The ICD-10 differs from the DSM-IV in that abuse is termed &quot;harmful use&quot; and the criteria is less specific than the DSM-IV  and requires symptoms to be present for at least one month or repeatedly within a twelve month period. The DSM-IV-TR specifies certain criteria to be present relating to failure to fulfil social and occupational responsibilities, using substances in circumstances that are physically hazardous such as driving under the influence, negative consequences in interpersonal relationships and being frequently in trouble with the law as a result of substance use.

Substance dependence
|}

Substance dependence is a syndrome that is characterised by compulsive use of the substance and loss of control over substance using behaviour. It can be accompanied by the phenomenon of tolerance to the effects of the substance and substance specific withdrawal syndrome. Tolerance is characterised by the need for increased amounts of the substance to achieve the same desired effect or by the same dose not resulting in the desired effects. Withdrawal is characterised by a characteristic cluster of symptoms on cessation or reduction of the substance. If either tolerance or withdrawal is present ICD-10 and DSM-IV allow the subtype specification of physiological or physical dependence to be noted.  Substance dependent individuals also spent increasing durations of time engaging in substance taking behaviour and may give up other activities previously enjoyed in order to use the substance. Substance use continues compulsively despite adverse consequences to the person’s psychological or physical health. 

Table 3 sets out the key similarities and differences in ICD-10 and DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for substance dependence.

As noted the term &quot;addiction&quot; is often used interchangeably with substance dependence.  Addiction can be defined as a chronic relapsing medical disorder characterised by

a) loss of control over substance intake

b) and compulsive drug use associated

c) with the development of neuro-adaptations that result in the presence of

d) negative affective states when the substance is withdrawn.

B) The nature of the harm should be clearly identifiable (and specified).

C) The pattern of use has persisted for at least 1 month or has occurred repeatedly within a 12-month period.

D) The disorder does not meet criteria for any other mental or behavioural disorder related to the same drug in the same time period (except for acute intoxication).
|-
| '''Dependence syndrome:''' 

Three or more of the following manifestations should have occurred together for at least one month or, if persisting for periods of less than 1 month, should have occurred repeatedly within a 12 month period:

1) A strong desire or sense of compulsion to take the substance.

2) Impaired capacity to control substance taking behaviour in terms of its onset, termination, or levels of use, as evidenced by the substance being often taken in larger amount s over a longer period than intended, or by a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to reduce or control substance use.

3) A physiological withdrawal state when substance use is reduced or ceased, as evidenced by the characteristic withdrawal syndrome for the substance or by use of the same (or closely related) substance with the intention of relieving or avoiding withdrawal symptoms.

4) Evidence of tolerance to the effects of the substance, such as that there is a need for significantly increased amounts of the substance to achieve intoxication or the desired effect, or a markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of the substance.

5) Preoccupation with substance use, as manifested by important alternative pleasures or interests being given up or reduced because of substance use; or a great deal of time spent in activities necessary to obtain, take or recover from the effects of the substance.

6) Persistent use of substance despite clear evidence of harmful consequences, as evidenced by continued use when the individual is actually aware, or may be expected to be aware, of the nature and extent of harm.

Substance intoxication syndromes:

Syndromes of intoxication that are specific to the substance of abuse characterise use of each substance. Intoxication is usually defined as a substance specific syndrome that develops during or immediately after the ingestion of a substance and is characterised by maladaptive behavioural or psychological changes as a result of the effect of the substance on the central nervous system. Drugs of abuse can broadly be classified into &quot;uppers&quot; and &quot;downers&quot; and often persons addicted to drugs of abuse use a combination of both stimulant and depressant substances. Classified within the &quot;downer&quot; group are substances such as alcohol, cannabis, heroin and sedative hypnotics. Uppers consist of stimulants such as amphetamines, methamphetamines, and cocaine and club drugs such as ecstasy. A third designated class of substances include the hallucinogens and consist of substances such as LSD, mescaline and psylopsiben.
The specific features of each syndrome is determined by the  unique effects of each substance on the receptor systems of the brain as well as the half life of the substance which determines the duration of the substance related effects. 

Table 5 contains the details of various substance intoxication syndromes.

==== Substance withdrawal syndromes ==== 

===== Alcohol withdrawal =====
Depending on the severity of the dependency syndrome alcohol withdrawal can range from mild and spontaneously resolving states to severe, potentially life threatening states. Mild withdrawal is characterised by gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, retching and vomiting, sympathetic hyperactivity as manifested by sweatiness, tachycardia, tremor and insomnia. In the majority of cases mild to moderate withdrawal states can be managed with outpatient detoxification regimes. Less than 5-10% of patients with alcohol dependence will develop complicated withdrawal also termed delirium tremens. Risk factors for complicated withdrawal include:

a) Previous history of complicated withdrawal
b) History of withdrawal seizures
c) Severe nutritional deficiencies (Vit B and thiamine)
d) Underlying medical complications such as pancreatitis, liver damage, peptic ulceration or oesophageal varices.

Delirium tremens typically develops 48 to 72 hours following cessation of drinking and is characterised by clouding of consciousness, severe tremor, visual and tactile hallucinations often in the form of small animal figures or insects, agitation and fidgetiness as well as nausea and vomiting.
Withdrawal seizures can also develop 48 to 72 hours following the last drink. Delirium tremens is considered a medical emergency and treatment in a facility geared towards the management of medical ill patients is essential.

Wernicke’s encephalopathy is a further potential complication of alcohol withdrawal. This condition can arise due to nutritional depletion of thiamine leading to a cluster of neurological symptoms on the background of a delirium. Physical signs of Wernicke’s encephalopathy include opthalmoplegia with cranial nerve III and VI palsies as well as ataxia. Only 10% of patients with Wernicke's will have the classical triad of confusion, ataxia, and nystagmus. Cranial nerve signs also only occur in about 25% of patients. Therefore, a diagnosis of Wernicke's should always be considered in patients’ who present with alterations in level of consciousness in the context of alcohol withdrawal. Untreated Wernicke's can result in death in up to 20%, and as many as 20% of patients go on to develop  neuronal damage in the diencaephalic brain regions such as the mediodorsal thalamus, periaquadauctal grey and mammilary bodies of the hypothalamus. Damage in these neuroanatomical regions can result in anterograde amnesia, characterised by the inability to learn new information. Also known as diencephalic amnesia, this form of memory loss is characteristic of Korsakoff’s psychosis, which is diagnosed according to the DSM-IV as &quot;Alcohol induced persistent amnestic disorder.&quot;

===== Opioid withdrawal =====

Discontinuation of heroin and other opioid derivatives is characterised by a pronounced withdrawal syndrome. Although highly unpleasant, unlike alcohol withdrawal heroin withdrawal is rarely associated with life threatening complications. The syndrome of withdrawal is characterised by severe dysphoria, craving for heroin, agitation, yawning, diaphoresis, lacrimation, piloerection (goose bumps) pupil dilatation, muscle and abdominal cramps as well as diarrhoea. For drugs such as heroin with a short duration of action, the acute withdrawal syndrome usually reaches a peak after 48 to 72 hours and subsides after 7 to 10 days.
 
'''Stimulant withdrawal (cocaine and methamphetamine)'''

Characteristic withdrawal syndromes have been described for stimulants such as cocaine, amphetamines and methamphetamine. The acute withdrawal syndrome usually has its onset within 12 to 24 hours of the last dose. The acute withdrawal syndrome is sometimes described as a &quot;crash&quot; after the period of a high. This syndrome is characterised by feelings of intense sadness and depression, severe fatigue and a tendency to oversleep and eat. The acute withdrawal syndrome typically subsides after 10 to 14 days. This is followed by a period from week 2 to week 8 post cessation that is characterised by renewed energy and a newfound confidence in abstinence. This period has also been described as the &quot;honeymoon period&quot; where persons typically feel confident that they are able to quit using stimulants on their own. In the treatment setting this can often be characterised by treatment drop-outs. By 2 months post drug cessation a third phase sometimes described as &quot;the wall&quot; is described. This phase is characterised by severe fatigue and a loss of the ability to experience pleasure (anhedonia). Usual routes to experience pleasure are often drug associated. Recovering addicts often experiences this stage is profoundly isolating.

===== Comorbidity =====

Rates of substance use disorder have been reported as high as 75% in the treatment settings for patients with severe mental illness such as schizophrenia. The odds ratio for bipolar mood disorder in patients with substance use disorders in the NCS study has been reported to be as high as 6.8.  Similarly major depressive disorder occurs in up to half of treatment seeking individuals with substance use disorders whereas the rates of substance use disorders in persons diagnosed with major depression is 2-3 times that of the general population (Kessler et al. 1996). Patients with anxiety disorders in particular panic disorder OCD and PTSD are also more likely to have a co-occurring substance or alcohol use disorder than persons from the general population. Whereas women with  alcohol dependence are more likely to have co-occurring anxiety and mood disorders as compared to men, men are in turn more likely to have co-morbid ADHD, conduct disorder and antisocial personality disorder (Brady and Randall, 1999).

===== Clinical assessment =====

''Substance use history and mental status examination:''

In the routine clinical setting a thorough substance history should include the following:

a)  The various different substances used including the substance of preference.

b) Age at first use, the frequency and amount of use over time.

c) Date of last use.

d)  The amount of money spent on substances.

e) The amount of time spent daily on drug taking.

f) Attempts at trying to quit, as well as the duration of abstinent periods.

g) History of medical/physical complications including overdoses. This includes a history of risk taking behaviour placing the individual at risk of contracting transmissible conditions such as HIV or Hepatitis B.

h) An assessment of the social and relationship consequences of the substance.

i) Screening for mood, anxiety, psychotic and other psychological symptoms that may co-occur with drug use.

j) Family history of drug dependence and abuse.

k) A thorough forensic history and history of any legal involvement.

The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test or AUDIT (Saunders et al. 1993) is a brief (2-3 minute) 10-item screening tool of particular use in primary care, general practice settings. It includes both a self report and clinician administered version that rate items relating to different aspects of drinking patterns, harmful use and dependency on a 4-point Likert-type scale (&quot;never&quot; to &quot;daily or almost daily&quot;). A total score of more than 8 on this scale is indicative of alcohol related problems that calls for further in-depth diagnostic interviewing. Lower cut-off scores than 8 are suggested for female populations.  This instrument has demonstrated good sensitivities varying from 0.76 to 0.92 and specificities from 0.70 to 0.92 in various populations including psychiatric patients with severe mental illness and primary are patients (Reinert and Allen, 2002). 

The Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test (MAST)(Selzer, 1971) is a slightly more comprehensive instrument that in addition to current alcohol use also assesses use over the subject’s entire lifetime. This self report screening instrument consists of 25 yes or no items and is available in two shorter 13 and 10 item versions. It is suitable for a variety of clinical and non-clinical settings. In addition to assessing alcohol use it also enquires about a number of related consequences of alcohol abuse such as medical, psychological, psychiatric, social, interpersonal, and occupational complications (Selzer, 2008). Despite its strength as regards comprehensiveness it is less likely to be suitable in busy time pressured clinical settings.

The Drug Abuse Screening Test (DAST)(Skinner, 1982) is a self report instrument based on the MAST but specific to illicit drug use. Similar to the MAST it assesses the presence of a variety of social, occupational, interpersonal and medical consequences relating to illicit non-medical drug use. Depending on the cut-off scores, the 20, 28 and 10- item versions of the DAST have a high sensitivity and specificity values for the detection of DSM-III-R diagnoses of substance use disorders diagnoses across a variety of settings including in patients with severe mental illness.  This instrument is suitable for patients who are non-treatment seeking and assesses overall consequences of all, including polydrug use and does not specify which drugs are more likely to cause particular consequences. The test requires less than 10 minutes completing and scoring. 

A brief and clinically useful tool to identify alcohol related disorders is the CAGE questionnaire (Ewing, 1984). This very brief instrument takes less than 1 minute to complete and consists of 4 brief questions as contained in the acronym &quot;CAGE.&quot;  Cut down- refers to the need to cut down or decrease drinking; Annoyed refers to feeling annoyed at criticism from others about drinking too much; Guilt refers to feeling bad or guilty about drinking; Eye opener refers to the need to have a drink first thing in the morning. The total score of the test is out of 4. A cut-off of 1 out of 4 has a high sensitivity varying from 0.86 to 0,90 but lower specificity (and hence higher false positive rate) ranging from as low as 0.52 to 0.53 to detect alcohol use disorders of clinical threshold (abuse and dependence as identified by DSM or ICD-10 criteria). Consequently some have recommended that a cut-off of ?2/4 be used to identify abuse or dependence as a result of the higher specificity and hence lower false positive rates. Clinicians also need to be aware of its limitations in certain populations as studies have shown to be a less accurate instrument in white women, pregnant women and college students who tend to binge drink (Dhalla and Kopec, 2007).

A similar test to the CAGE is the TWEAK test (Russell et al. 1991). This brief 5-item self or clinician rated instrument has been designed for and specifically validated in samples of females including pregnant women. The name of the scale is an acronym derived from the letters that represent the main constructs that are measured. In the TWEAK-HOLD version designed for the binge drinking population Tolerance refers to the amount of drinks a person can hold.  In the TWEAK-HIGH version the question is phrased &quot;does it take three or more drinks to feel high?&quot; Worried refers to complaints or worries expressed by friends or close relatives about the patients drinking in the past year.  Eye-openers refer to having a drink first thing in the morning. Amnesia refers to reports from others of blackouts where events or conversations are forgotten while drinking. The K refers to cut down or the need to cut down on drinking.  The first two items are allocated a score of 2 if rate positive and the remaining items are all scored one to give a total for the entire test of 7 points. Cut–off scores of 2 or higher have been demonstrated to be associated with harmful drinking in pregnancy complicated by significantly lower birth weight, head circumference, APGAR scores and cognitive deficits by age 6 years. Cut-offs of 3 or higher are characterised by good levels of sensitivity and specificity to detect alcohol dependence in women in general population and emergency room settings (Russell et al. 2008). The TWEAK performs less well in primary care settings to detect harmful drinking where the AUDIT may be a more valid test (Bush et al. 2003).

In addition to non-structured clinical diagnostic classification systems such as the ICD-10 and DSM-IV, more structured instruments exist to aid in the diagnosis of substance abuse and dependence. The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV or  SCID-I (First et al. 1994) is a semi-structured clinical interview designed to generate categorical diagnoses based on DSM-IV diagnostic criteria. This interview is available in a clinician and research version and takes on average 90-120 minutes to complete depending on patient factors and clinician experience. Formal training is required and experience and background in clinical work is advantageous although not essential to conduct this interview successfully. The instrument consist of several modules that assess various mental  disorders in addition to substance use disorders and depending on the needs and research designs or clinical need these modules included or excluded with the module assessing substance use disorders.

The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI)(Sheehan et al. 1998) is a briefer diagnostic instrument in comparison to the SCID-I and that generates a wide variety of diagnoses including substance and alcohol use disorder categories. The MINI is available in variety of languages including English and takes approximately 15 to 20 minutes to complete. Three versions the MINI, MINI-plus and MINI kid are available. The MINI evaluates the presence of 17 axis I disorders, with 8 additional disorders included in the MINI plus. The interviewers are required to have some training in its administration (2-3 hour training) with non clinicians requiring more extensive training. The MINI questions are structured to be delivered verbatim and have a yes no outcome. This instrument has been designed to maximise sensitivity introducing the possibility of false positives and therefore necessitating more in depth probing by clinicians in cases where positive predictive values need to be maximized (the likelihood that a positive screen represents a true positive).
The most widely used scale in the measurement of addiction severity within addiction treatment settings is the addiction severity index or ASI (McLellan et al. 1992). This multidimensional instrument measures the consequences of drug use across 7 domains. These domains include the assessment of drug and alcohol use, medical consequences, psychiatric complications, impacts on employment and support, family history, family and social support and legal status. This scale requires training in its administration and takes 40-60 minutes to complete. Severity can be calculated by calculating composite scores and by means of clinician rated severity scale for each measured domain. It can be used to track treatment progress over time. Its limitations include low test retest reliability in some populations such as in dual disorder, severely mentally ill and homeless individuals, and lower inter-rater reliabilities among interviewers with less training. The calculation of composite scores  has been recommended in follow up studies as opposed clinician rated severity scales (McLellan et al. 2008; Makela, 2004). 

'''Laboratory tests:'''

In the clinical setting it is important to realize that laboratory tests merely detect recent use of substances and are not diagnostic of abuse, dependence or addiction. During the diagnostic work-up laboratory tests should only be used when the reliability of the patient’s account of use is in doubt. In turn routine random, unannounced testing does from an important part in treatment settings, where rewards or limit setting may be contingent upon urine test results. 

Laboratory tests are routinely based on urine samples but hair, blood, saliva and sweat samples can also be used. The availability of inexpensive on-site, point of collection rapid urine drug tests has made routine testing much more practically useful to many treatment facilities. Urine immune-essay tests typically a have shorter detection range, varying from 1-3 days with all the typical drugs of abuse usually eliminated from the body within 48 hours. One exception is in chronic heavy users of cannabis where detection in the urine can be present for up to 1 month.  Hair analysis by means of gas chromatography, mass spectrometry (GCMS) has a much wider detection range vary from 7-90+ days. Hair analysis, although prone to false positives in cases of passive ingestion of substances, can also quantify severity of drug use as the length of hair containing drugs of abuse correlates with frequency of use. In addition hair testing may be useful in opiate addicts in patients claiming false positive urine test due to poppy seeds, or in patients who are cheating or evading urine drug testing (Dolan et al. 2004).

Blood tests are also useful in the treatment of patients with alcohol dependence. The most sensitive and specific tests are serum gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) and carbohydrate deficient transferrin (CDT). Although the most sensitive of markers, GGT is also influenced by age and obesity and can be false positive as a result of a number of chronic illnesses such as liver disease and medication treatments .CDT, although less reliable in female patients, is specific to high levels of alcohol intake and when done in combination with GGT increases sensitivity and specificity. These markers will remain positive for up to 2-3 weeks following cessation of alcohol use.  Mean corpuscular volume of red blood cells (MCV) is another sensitive marker, particularly in female patients and remains positive for up to 2-4 months following the start of abstinence (Niemela, 2007).

=== Treatment === 

==== Treatment setting and level of care ==== 

The consequences of addictive disorders span across a wide array of potential biopsychosocial complications. Consequently the treatment needs of individuals with addictions span across medical, psychiatric, psychological, legal, social occupational and financial domains. Due to this multidimensional nature of treatment needs many health providers are likely to be involved in the treatment process. Treatment providers can include medical services, specialized psychiatric services, social services, the criminal justice system and psychological services. As the treatment needs of patients are highly heterogeneous, treatment intensity and treatment modalities needs to be matched to the individual patients needs. This requires frequent and effective interaction between various role players in the addiction treatment process. A standardized intake assessment procedure that determines the level and intensity of the required treatment needed is essential to ensure integrated and appropriate treatments. Research has demonstrated that patients who are not appropriately matched in terms of the intensity of treatment are more likely to drop out of treatment and relapse earlier (Deck et al. 2003). One such standardized assessment procedure is the revised version of Patient Placement Criteria (PPC-2R) for the treatment of substance related conditions endorsed by the American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM)(Mee-Lee et al. 2001). This system allows for placement in five main levels of care with further specifications in the revised system. These levels consist of an early intervention level (level 0.5), outpatient based care (level I), intensive outpatient or partial hospitalization care (level II), inpatients residential care (level III) and medically managed inpatients services (level IV). In addition the type of care is further determined along six dimensions: acute intoxication or withdrawal potential; biomedical conditions or complications; emotional, behavioural or cognitive conditions and complications; readiness to change; relapse, continued use or continued problem potential and recovery environment.

==== Stages of treatment ==== 

Treatment can be conceptualized in phases according to the stage of readiness of a client. However, these stages should not be regarded as rigid as therapeutic interventions may be applicable across different stages of motivation. Both psychological and pharmacological interventions differ across the various stages of change. 

'''a) Precontemplative, contemplative and early determination stages:''' 

''Psychological interventions''

During the early phases the dependence syndrome, denial of the fact that drug use is problematic may be the rule rather than the exception. Interventions such as motivational enhancement therapy and its related interventions such as brief interventions are particularly effective in patients who display high levels of resistance to change and manifest denial of drug and alcohol problems. During this early phase two techniques are useful to motivate patients towards recovery:

Brief motivational interventions:

This is a suitable intervention for primary care and emergency room practitioners who often can only spend a few minutes with a client. Key principles in counselling patients with addiction problems are non-judgementality and empathy.  Described by Bien at.al (Bien et al. 1993), it is summarized by the mnemonic &quot;FRAMES&quot; which entail the following:

F- Feedback: The practitioner provides feedback regarding the negative effects the substance has had on the physical health, interpersonal relations and occupational roles of the client.

R- Responsibility: It is emphasised that the responsibility to stop using remains that of the client.

A-Advice- Advice is given that the cause for many problems relate to drug use and that abstinence or cutting down is advised. Possible options that will facilitate recovery are explored and practical advice is given.

M-Menu for change: Interest is expressed to aid the recovery of the patient and the various options and pathways are discussed such as referral to specialist centres for recovery.

E-Empathy: The counselling style is characterised by a warm and caring style that is empathic and non-judgemental.

S-Self-Efficacy: Hope is instilled by encouragement and emphasising that the patient has the ability and power to change.

Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET):

This is a counselling intervention that requires a greater deal of skill and training than brief interventions. It is primarily a client-centred approach that emphasizes a non-judgemental empathic style of interviewing and communicating. In this respect it differs from more confrontational techniques such as Minnesota model and 12-step facilitation, although should not be seen as incompatible with such techniques but in fact complementary. The role of the therapist in addiction treatments may vary according to the stage of readiness for change, treatment setting and context and therapists need to be comfortable in adapting this role within the network of role players in addiction treatment that may include the therapist but also family members, employers and other professionals. Motivational enhancement therapies are aimed particularly at persons with high levels of denial and resistance to change. Although client centred, motivational enhancement therapy is not passive but in fact subtly directive in its selective attention to particulars in the clients’ communication. Practitioners trained within the medical model often find this approach difficult in the beginning as medical model interviewing often requires more closed ended questioning and more active information gathering exercises. 

The following are principles of this technique:

a) Expressing empathy

b) Avoiding argumentation

c) Developing discrepancy

d) Rolling with resistance

e) Enhancing self-efficacy

The aim of this interview technique or communication style is to reflect empathically on the consequences drug taking behaviour has had on the person’s life and to develop and point out discrepancies between what the person’s life is currently like and what the person  aspires to be like. The ultimate goal is to increase the client’s ambivalence and develop a sense of discrepancy and cognitive dissonance that in turn will drive motivation to change. A cardinal principal in this communication style is the avoidance of argumentation (i.e., when patients deny or rationalize their drug taking behaviour). Instead resistance to change is met with reflective and empathic listening. Various techniques of reflective listening are used to mobilise initial resistance and thus transforming resistance via self reflection into motivation to change. Self motivating statements are elicited and the therapist empathises with both the part of the client that wants to change and the resistant part, whilst at the same time pointing out discrepancies in the between the clients goals and actual behaviour. It is important to instil hope as self efficacy or the confidence the client has in their ability to effect change, is an important factor in successful recovery.

'''b) Precontemplative, contemplative and early determination stages:''' 

''Pharmacotherapy''

The cessation of drug use is accompanied by substance specific withdrawal syndromes. These syndromes typically consist of highly unpleasant symptoms. For certain substances such as alcohol, benzodiazepines, sedative-hypnotics and opioids these syndrome are often more pronounced and requires pharmacological treatment within an inpatient or, in less severe cases, outpatient settings. Most withdrawal regimes consists of substituting the drug of abuse with a agonist medications that act on similar receptor sites as the drug of abuse but that does not have the typical euphoriant side effect profiles.
Although several withdrawal regimes exist it is important to measure the presence of a withdrawal syndrome objectively with rating scales and to titrate the dosages of the replacement therapy according to the symptom severity of the withdrawal.

Alcohol withdrawal: Uncomplicated, mild alcohol withdrawal:

Most patients (75-85%) will only experience milder forms of alcohol withdrawal. Symptoms typically consist of nausea, tremors, sweating and tachycardia. Uncomplicated, mild withdrawal can be managed without medication and may only require as needed benzodiazepine treatment on an outpatient basis. Medication should be limited to 5-7 day course of decreasing dose regime. Long acting benzodiazepines are preferable such as chlordiazepoxide or diazepam, with shorter acting agents such as lorazepam and oxazepam reserved only for patients with impaired liver functions. Thiamine replacement therapy should always accompany withdrawal treatment.

Alcohol withdrawal: moderate, severe and complicated alcohol withdrawal.
Of all patients with alcohol dependence as many as 25 % of patients may experience symptomatically severe withdrawal syndromes, whilst 5-15% of all alcohol dependence patients may experience complicated withdrawal syndromes. A past history of withdrawal seizures, physical illness such as liver, cardiac or pancreatic disease, hallucinations and psychotic symptoms or delirium tremens should be regarded as indicators of potential complicated withdrawal. Complicated alcohol withdrawal carries a high mortality, is potentially dangerous and is best managed in an inpatient setting equipped and staffed to monitor patients physically on a regular basis. Three approaches on the initiation of benzodiazepine withdrawal regimes are described in the literature (Saitz and O'Malley, 1997). The frontloading approach involves starting the patient on high initial doses (20mg of diazepam) repeated every 2 hours in order to prevent withdrawal. A second approach, the fixed dose regime, involves the prescription of 6hly benzodiazepines (usually 20mg of diazepam), with as needed doses for breakthrough symptoms in between. Alternatively a third approach the &quot;symptom trigger&quot; method involves the regular monitoring for withdrawal symptoms and the administration of benzodiazepines when clinical symptoms reach a threshold above 8 on the CIWA-Ar scale. There is some evidence that initiation of pharmacotherapy after the emergence of symptoms (symptoms trigger approach) produces superior (yet non-significant) outcomes in terms of symptoms relief (Ntais et al.  2005). Practitioners should however be flexible and treat patients according to the severity of symptoms. Under or over treatment with benzodiazepines should be avoided. Intravenous or intramuscular thiamine replacement with additional vitamin B complex should always accompany withdrawal prior to administration of glucose as the administration of glucose prior to thiamine can precipitate a rapid depletion of neuronal thiamine and lead to Wernicke’s encephalopathy. Intravenous thiamine administration should be monitored due to the rare potential complication of an anaphylactic reaction. Antipsychotics should be avoided during the acute withdrawal stage as they can precipitate withdrawal seizures by lowering seizure threshold. In certain circumstances such as delirium tremens antipsychotics can be used cautiously for severe agitation and hallucinations, but care should be taken not to use lower potency agents as these are more likely to precipitate seizures.

Opiate withdrawal and detoxification:

Cessation of opioid use in individuals dependent on opioids is characterised by a highly unpleasant withdrawal  syndrome consisting of anxiety, increased sweating,  dysphoria, restlessness, craving, irritability, pupillary dilation, lacrimation, rhinorhea, muscle cramps, abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, raised blood pressure and increased heart rate (American Psychiatric Association, 2005). Whereas less severe withdrawal syndromes can occur with opioids other than heroin, the following discussion will focus on the detoxification of heroin. In contrast to alcohol withdrawal that represents a condition with considerable morbidity and mortality, opioid withdrawal is rarely ever dangerous. The acute syndrome reaches a peak 48-72 hours after the last dose of opioids and resolves within 7 to 10 days (Mattick and Hall, 1996)
The aim of medically assisted opoid withdrawal should always be to prepare patients for ongoing inpatient or outpatient psychosocial rehabilitation. Detoxification of opioids without concomitant rehabilitation serves little purpose. Medications used in the detoxification of opioids are full or partial agonists at the mu opioid receptor site. The most commonly used medications with a good evidence base to support its efficacy are buprenorphine and methadone. Whereas buprenorphine is a partial agonist at mu opioid receptor sites, methadone acts as a full agonist. Both these drugs are long acting and ameliorate the unpleasant withdrawal symptoms associated with cessation of opioid use. Buphrenorphine has a long duration of action making once or even alternate day dosing possible. In contrast to methadone buprenorphine is less sedative and interferes little with QTc interval and cardiac conduction at higher doses. This property together with its ceiling effect at higher dosages (due to lower intrinsic activity as a result of its partial agonist activities) renders this drug safer in overdose and makes it an attractive medication for outpatient, office based detoxification treatment. As buprenorphine can precipitate withdrawal due to its partial agonist actions it is important that this medication be initiated only after symptoms of withdrawal have manifested, usually 12 hours after the last use of heroin.

'''c) Determination, action and maintenance stages:''' 

''Psychological interventions''

Twelve-Step Facilitation (TSF):

Twelve step facilitation is a manual based therapy that is aimed at facilitating and encouraging the involvement of patients into community based self-help twelve step programmes such as alcoholics anonymous and narcotics anonymous.  Twelve-step facilitation can be delivered in a time limited manner on a weekly basis over 12 weeks or, as in many cases as an ongoing intervention over months to years. The twelve step facilitator therapists are required to have an excellent working knowledge of the twelve step manual as well as the principles that underlie twelve step programs such as AA and NA. This entails reading the AA handbook, twelve step manuals as well as attending several 12 step meetings as a professional guest (in cases where  therapists are not recovering addicts). Therapists function as educators that introduce patients to the 12 step principles, elucidating the structure and functioning of 12-step meetings, the importance of regular attendance and the role of sponsors. Therapists should be actively encouraging participation in 12-step meetings and explore patient’s views of 12-step principles such as the pertinent role of spirituality and the notion of a higher power. Central to twelve step facilitation is the notion that addiction is a disease with a physical, emotional as well as spiritual component. In the 12-step model cure from addiction is not viewed as a realistic option but rather management of an ongoing chronic illness, with abstinence from drugs and alcohol viewed as a central treatment goal. Surrender to a higher power, which may be symbolized by treatment principles, structures and philosophy or more spiritual notions such as God, is viewed as a critical step in treatment. Patients are required to keep a diary of their attendance of meetings and the issues discussed at meetings. In turn therapists confront patients in a non-judgemental manner should there be signs of resistance or denial of drug and alcohol related problems. Denial may manifest in non attendance of meetings and rationalizations as to why attendance is not possible. It is important for therapist to explore patient’s experiences of 12-step meetings in order to identify each patient’s unique views and beliefs about twelve step programs. This will enable therapists to explore problems relating to denial or irrational or erroneous beliefs about 12-step programs and make suggestions as to how this can be addressed. Twelve step programs have been found to be as effective as cognitive behavioural and motivational enhancement treatments in reducing alcohol intake at 1 and 3 years follow up in the large multisite randomized controlled trial, project MATCH. In turn twelve step facilitation has shown somewhat superior outcomes in promoting abstinence and higher AA and NA attendance rates in aftercare settings (Humphreys, 1999).  

CBT for relapse prevention:

Cognitive behavioural therapy is based on the principles of learning theory and has as one of its main targets to promote cognitions and behaviour that disrupt the cycle of learned drug taking behaviours that is encoded via the mechanisms of classical and operant conditioning. It is a highly structured; time limited (12-24 weeks) therapy in characterised by a collaborative client therapist relationship. It forms part of the active treatment and maintenance phases of the treatment cycle, with the principal objective being that of acquiring the necessary skills to prevent relapses into drug taking behaviour. Sessions are highly structured in that time is devoted first on feedback and homework assignments, then on didactic discussion of skills and behaviour followed by setting goals and targets. An important tool in therapy is functional analysis of behaviour that is associated with drug taking. In this analysis internal (emotional and cognitive) and external (environmental) triggers are identified and skills and techniques are then acquired on how to manage and deal with these triggers. Aspects of the functional analysis include identifying thoughts and feelings associated with internal triggers such as craving as well as environmental triggers that may drive dysfunctional beliefs about drug use. Skills training involve the learning of techniques to cope with craving and social pressures and may include distraction techniques and assertiveness training. CBT has been demonstrated to be effective as a relapse prevention treatment across a wide variety of substance use disorders including cocaine, alcohol, cannabis, nicotine and heroin addictions (Magill and Ray, 2009). CBT has also been shown to offer additional benefits for patients with co-occurring psychiatric disorders such as depression. Findings from Project Match, a large multicentre randomised controlled trail in patients with alcohol dependence investigating the efficacy of twelve step facilitation (TSF), cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) and motivational enhancement therapy (MET), demonstrated CBT to be efficacious in reducing drinking (Project MATCH Research Group, 1998a; Project MATCH Research Group, 1998b). An important effect demonstrated by earlier studies of CBT for drug addiction is the lingering effect after therapy has been terminated (Carroll et al. 1994). This effect is particularly useful when CBT is used in combination with behavioural treatments such as contingency management that often show potent effects early on in treatment, which subsides wanes as treatment is discontinued (Rawson et al. 2006). In addition recent research has demonstrated superior outcomes for CBT in comparison to interpersonal therapy (IPT) in patient with cocaine dependence (Carroll et al. 2004). An important potential active ingredient for CBT efficacy has been shown to be high compliance with additional session and homework assignments. Thus patients who comply more diligently with home work assignments have been shown to have superior outcome in CBT (Carroll et al.  1994; Carroll et al.  2005). Although treatment programs may be eager to roll out manualized forms of CBT treatment, therapist training associated with active session to session direct personal supervision has been demonstrated to be associated significantly higher fidelity to CBT criterion standards.

Combined psychosocial modalities: matrix model

The matrix model of treatment is an intensive, manualized, outpatient based treatment model for addictive disorders. Although it originated during the cocaine epidemic during the 1980’s in the United States, it has been developed as a treatment for methamphetamine addiction as well as other non-stimulant addictions (Obert et al. 2000; Rawson et al. 1995). This eclectic treatment model incorporates various evidence based psychosocial interventions such as motivational enhancement therapy, 12-step facilitation, cognitive behavioural therapy, contingency management and family therapy. A typical treatment program consists of a highly structured 4 month, 3 times per week intensive outpatient based program followed by somewhat less structured 8 month continuing care program. Treatments are structured according to the stage of recovery and include early recovery groups in the early recovery stages and relapse prevention and social support groups in the more advanced stages. Information about the nature of addiction and the recovery process is also given early on in the treatment and a family psycho-education group forms a critical part of treatment. Early recovery groups focus on ways patients can attain abstinence early on in treatment. Relapse prevention groups focus on identifying external and internal triggers for relapse as well as methods to cope with such triggers. Social support groups are aimed at helping clients develop of social and interpersonal supports that are non drug users. An important part of the program involves facilitation into 12-step self help groups. Individual counselling and support is also received in parallel with group therapy. In contrast to more confrontational inpatient based models, the therapist style is non-confrontational and firmly based on motivational interviewing principles. Therapists are however not passive and actively pursue non-compliant patients in a non-confrontational caring manner. Weekly urine tests are conducted and negative tests are positively re-inforced with rewards. Some programs also make use of structures contingency management schedules of reward (Obert et al.  2002).

'''d) Determination, action and maintenance stages:''' 

''Pharmacological interventions''

Alcohol dependence

Disulfiram:

Disulfiram is an irreversible inhibitor of the enzyme acetaldehyde dehydrogenase. Administration of disulfiram causes an accumulation of acetaldehyde, a toxic breakdown product of in the metabolism of alcohol. This results in a highly unpleasant reaction characterised by facial flushing, severe nausea and vomiting, hypotension and headaches. This reaction is thought to be a powerful negative reinforcer promoting abstinence. Studies have however shown that the efficacy of this medication is highly dependent on compliance with this drug, which can be very poor (Fuller et al. 1986). More recent research has shown that supervised consumption of disulfiram by family members of addicts has improved outcomes (De Sousa et al. 2008; Laaksonen et al. 2008). Therapy with disulfiram has to be initiated cautiously as this medication is contraindicated in alcohol dependent individuals with liver, kidney and cardiac conditions. Disulfiram treatment has also been reported to be associated with the development of psychotic symptoms. 

Naltrexone:

One postulated mechanism whereby alcohol produces its reinforcing effects is via the increased release of endogenous opioids. Endogenous opioid  secretion  increases the release of dopamine directly via stimulation of the nucleus accumbens or indirectly by inhibiting the tonically inhibitory effect of GABA neurons on dopamine neurons within the nucleus accumbens (Gianoulakis, 2009). Evidence from randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses has supported the use of naltrexone a mu opiate receptor antagonist in the maintenance treatment of alcohol dependence (Srisurapanont and Jarusuraisin, 2005). There is also evidence that naltrexone can help to prevent a lapse into drinking from turning into a full blown relapse.  As an antagonist of mu opiate receptors naltrexone blocks the stimulation of opiate receptors by beta endorphins which in turn is postulated to result in less dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens. Via this mechanism the positive reinforcing euphoriant effects of alcohol is attenuated and type I craving is diminished.   Naltrexone is well tolerated in the majority of patients. Contraindications include abnormalities in liver function and the comorbid presence of opioid dependence. Monitoring requirements include baseline and follow up liver enzymes. Concurrent use of medications that are potentially hepatotoxic should be avoided (such as disulfiram). Use with opioid containing analgesics is contraindicated. Naltrexone is also available in long acting depot formulation (XR-NLX) for once monthly administration.

Acamprosate:

Acamprosate is related to the amino acid taurine. Acamprosate modulates hyperglutamatergic states characteristic of acute and protracted alcohol withdrawal via its inhibitory action on excitatory NMDA receptors and facilatatory action on GABA function. The prolonged withdrawal stage is characterised by increased excitatatory glutamatergic neurotransmission due to  NMDA receptor upregulation that takes place during the intoxication phases in the presence of high alchohol levels. Via its inhibitory action on NMDA receptors acamprosate curbs negative or   type 2 craving associated with unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. Studies have demonstrated that acamprosate is effective in preventing relapse into heavy drinking. This effect may be more pronounced in patients who are more motivated to remain abstinent (Johnson et al. 2007; Johnson et al. 2008).

Topiramate:

Other candidate drugs in the maintenance treatment of alcohol dependence include topiramate, a drug that is thought to both enhance GABAA inhibitory activity over the positive reinforcing effects of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens (type I craving) and at the same time attenuates glutamatergic hyperactivity via its action on AMPA glutamatergic receptors (type 2 craving). In turn it is thought that the decrease of glutamatergic activity results in decreased dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens (Kenna et al.  2009). Two randomized controlled trials, one of which is a multisite trial, have demonstrated the superior efficacy of topiramate over placebo on a number of outcome measures such as time abstinent from drinking, level of self reported drinking, compulsive cravings for alcohol and improved physical and psychosocial wellbeing (Johnson et al.  2003; Johnson et al.  2007; Johnson et al.  2008).

Baclofen:

In recent years baclofen, a GABAB receptor agonist, has received increasing attention in pharmacotherapy trials for alcohol maintenance (Addolorato et al. 2009). Due to the fact that it is not metabolized in the liver makes it an attractive alternative for patients with alcohol dependence and existing liver damage (Garbutt and Flannery, 2007). Three randomized controlled trails have been conducted to date with two showing significant superiority over placebo in reducing alcohol intake and prolonging periods of abstinence from alcohol (Addolorato et al. 2002; Addolorato et al. 2007; Garbutt et al.  2007). A third trial conducted in the US failed to replicate these findings and further research is necessary to clarify the role of baclofen in the treatment of alcohol dependence (Garbutt et al. 2007).

Opioid dependence:

Prospective cohort studies have demonstrated that long term abstinence based community residential rehabilitation programmes can be successful for opioid dependent patients with up to 50% achieving abstinence at 5 year follow up (Gossop et al. 2003). Nevertheless a subgroup of patients with severe heroin dependence is unlikely to succeed with traditional abstinence based approaches and may require harm reduction approaches that consist of opioid substitution maintenance prescribing. The primary aim of substitution maintenance treatment is to reduce the use of illicit heroin and in turn the associated morbidity and criminal behaviours that often accompany heroin addiction. Table 6 summarizes some of the goals of opioid substitution therapies.

During substitution maintenance treatment patients are given the opportunity to reconstruct their lives and improve their psychosocial and occupational functioning in order to obtain greater stability. Maintenance treatments can be time limited over 12 to 24 months but may be a treatment option over many years.

The main medications used in substitution maintenance programs are methadone, a full mu receptor agonist and buprenorphine, a partial mu receptor agonist. Research has shown that methadone, in particular high dose methadone maintenance is somewhat superior to buprenorphine in reducing illicit heroin use. Nevertheless as the side effect profile of methadone includes mild oversedation and somnolence; both agents are recommended as treatment options in maintenance programs. Substitution maintenance programs have to adhere to certain standards to be effective. These standards include staff trained and experienced in prescribing substitution medications. Daily supervised consumption including a full pre-treatment medical workup (including HIV and Hepatitis testing) is mandatory for all patients initiated on substitution therapies. Daily supervised consumption is less critical in patients treated with burprenorphine or buprenorphine-naloxone combinations, however still recommended in the early stabilization phase of treatment. Random urine tests testing for heroin is also mandatory. A pre-treatment contract between the treating doctor and patients stipulating the consequences of a positive urine tests is also important. 
One particular clinical problem is the injection of substitution medicines to obtain a high or the selling of these medicines (called diversion) to raise funds for illicit heroin. In some countries electronic methadone prescription monitoring services have been launched to prevent patients from obtaining prescriptions more than once at different pharmacies. Another strategy to counter diversion and injection practice is the use of Suboxone, a combination of buprenorphine (opioid agonist) and naloxone (opioid antagonist) in a 4:1 ratio. When taken sublingually the bioavailability of naloxone is not sufficient to lead to any clinical effect. However in the context of diversion practices and intravenous abuse of substitution medicines, naloxone has a high bioavailability leading to the induction of unpleasant withdrawal reactions and therefore acts as a discouragement for injection practices.

Patients on maintenance treatment may prematurely want to discontinue their opioid substitution medication in order to become drug free and independent. Each individual case needs to be carefully reviewed in terms of the particular clients’ strengths and ongoing risks of relapse. Factors that can contribute to relapse such as instability in interpersonal, occupational or living circumstances need to borne in mind when considering suitability to wean patients from opioid substitution medications.

=== Expiry date ===
The ''expiry'' parameter can be used to specify when an editnotice will cease to be visible on a page. This can be useful when an editnotice is created for reasons of a temporal nature. Any valid time format may be used, for example:
*January 2012
*4 April 2009
*11:09 April 5 2013
To specify that an editnotice never expire, {{para|expiry|indefinite}} may be used.

=== Editnotices created so far ===
See the list at [[Special:PrefixIndex/Template:Editnotices/]].

=== Usage ===
Insert as an edit notice for a user page as &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{editnotice userpage}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

===To insert===
To insert, go to your userpage. Click the 'edit this page' button at the top. When the editing screen comes up, there should be some small words on top of the edit box that read 'Page notice'. Click on this, then create a page called User:YourName/Editnotice. Paste &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{editnotice userpage}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; into it and save. Then, whenever somebody clicks to edit your userpage, there should be a box reminding them.

This is the {{tl|editnotice pagename}} meta-template.

It returns the full pagename for the editnotice of the current page. It works both for subject pages such as books and for their discussion pages.

=== Usage ===
This template takes no parameters and automatically outputs a proper formatted editnotice page address. Like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{editnotice pagename}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Which outputs the pagename of the editnotice for this page itself:

:{{editnotice pagename}}

This can for instance be used to produce a link to the editnotice for the current page. Like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
[[{{editnotice pagename}}]]
&lt;/pre&gt;

:[[{{editnotice pagename}}]]

This template works for all editnotices.

* {{tl|editnotice talkpagename}} - Returns the full talkpage name for the editnotice for the current page.

Namespace aliases are accepted, too:
* {{tlx|NAMESPACEID|Image}} → {{NAMESPACEID|Image}}
* {{tlx|NAMESPACEID|File}} → {{NAMESPACEID|File}}
* {{tlx|NAMESPACEID|WB}} → {{NAMESPACEID|WB}}
* {{tlx|NAMESPACEID|Project}} → {{NAMESPACEID|Project}}
* {{tlx|NAMESPACEID|Wikibooks}} → {{NAMESPACEID|Wikibooks}}

The template returns a ''state of error'' (recognized as such by a wiki parser function), and optionally an ''error-message text'' in red (visible for the user).

=== Usage ===
* {{tlx|error|An exemplary error}} → {{error|An exemplary error}}
* Compare, used in a Parser Function: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{#expr:Foo}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; → {{#expr:Foo}}

===Tag option===
The tag to contain the error message can be given through the &lt;code&gt;tag&lt;/code&gt; parameter, but it will only accept &lt;code&gt;span&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;strong&lt;/code&gt;, since those are the only tags recognized by the &lt;code&gt;#iferror&lt;/code&gt; parser function. It defaults to &lt;code&gt;strong&lt;/code&gt;, the tag generated e.g. by &lt;code&gt;#expre&lt;/code&gt;. To prevent &lt;code&gt;strong&lt;/code&gt; message, use one of the other tags, e.g. &lt;code&gt;tag=span&lt;/code&gt;.

* ABC {{tlx|error|An exemplary error demo no tag (default)}} XYZ → ABC {{error|An exemplary error demo no tag (default)}} XYZ 
* ABC &lt;nowiki&gt;{{error|An exemplary error demo span|tag=span}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; XYZ → ABC {{error|An exemplary error demo span|tag=span}} XYZ
* ABC &lt;nowiki&gt;{{error|An exemplary error demo div|tag=div}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; XYZ → ABC {{error|An exemplary error demo div|tag=div}} XYZ
* ABC &lt;nowiki&gt;{{error|An exemplary error demo p|tag=p}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; XYZ → ABC {{error|An exemplary error demo p|tag=p}} XYZ
* ABC &lt;nowiki&gt;{{error|An exemplary error demo strong|tag=strong}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; XYZ → ABC {{error|An exemplary error demo strong|tag=strong}} XYZ

This is the {{tl|editnotice load}} template.

This template is normally only used by the system, it is the [[Help:Editnotices|editnotice]] loader used in Wikibooks. It displays the editnotices and the links to them, at the top of pages when editing pages.

=== Technical details ===

This template loads and displays the namespace notice. It also calls the sub-template {{tl|editnotice load/core}}. That sub-template handles the loading of the group and page notices and the links to them. This template does parameter preprocessing, thus simplifying the code.

This template is placed in the main MediaWiki namespace notices named [[MediaWiki:Editnotice-0]], [[MediaWiki:Editnotice-1]] and so on. See [[WB:NS]] for the full list of namespace numbers. Therefore this template needs no parameter.

==== The links ====

When a page is edited this template often displays red or blue links at the top of the edit page looking like this:

&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; float: right; margin: 0px 0.8em; padding: 0; line-height: 1em;&quot;&gt; &lt;small&gt;[[This page should not exist|Page notice]]&lt;/small&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
{{clear}}

Or like this:

&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; float: right; margin: 0px 0.8em; padding: 0; line-height: 1em;&quot;&gt; &lt;small&gt;[[Example|Book/group notice]] &amp;nbsp; [[This page should not exist|Page notice]]&lt;/small&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
{{clear}}

Those links are to the book/group and page editnotices of the page. Admins always see both links, even if the notices have not yet been created, since they can create and edit the editnotices. Normal users only see the red &quot;Page notice&quot; link on their own user and user talk basepage, since they can create and edit such notices. Normal users also see blue links to book/group and page notices if they already have been created, so they can find and view the source code of the notice. But normal users still can't edit those notices, except the ones in userspace.

==== View source or edit ====
The editnotices are also displayed when a user &quot;views the source&quot; of a protected page. (When a non-admin tries to edit a fully protected page, or when an IP-user tries to edit a semi or fully protected page.) The group and page notices are displayed, but not the namespace notices. 

Most editnotices have useful information even when just viewing the source of a protected page, but in some cases we want to display different information to users who are just viewing the source of the page. This template feeds &quot;&lt;code&gt;notice action = view&lt;/code&gt;&quot; to the editnotices it loads when in view mode. This can be used inside the editnotices like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{#ifeq: {{{notice action|}}} | view
| &lt;!--A non-admin is &quot;viewing the source&quot; of a protected page--&gt;
| &lt;!--A user with sufficient rights is editing the page--&gt;
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

This is the {{tl|editnotice load/core}} sub-template.

Do not use this template directly, use {{tl|editnotice load}} instead.

This template is called from {{tl|editnotice load}}. It holds parts of the code for {{tl|editnotice load}}, while {{tl|editnotice load}}  does parameter preprocessing, thus simplifying the code.

This template is used by the [[Help:Editnotices|editnotice]] system.

=== Technical details ===

This sub-template handles the loading of the group and page notices, and the links to them. This template currently expects these parameters:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{editnotice load/core
| notice action = {{{notice action|}}}   &lt;!--&quot;view&quot; or empty string--&gt;
| group allowed = {{ns has subpages}}   &lt;!--&quot;yes&quot; or empty string--&gt;
| groupnotice =  &lt;!--The possible group notice pagename--&gt;
| pagenotice =  &lt;!--The possible page notice pagename--&gt;
| userpage =   &lt;!--&quot;yes&quot; if a user editable userpage notice, else empty string--&gt;
| ownuserpage =   &lt;!--&quot;yes&quot; if the user is on his own 
                  user or user talk rootpage, else empty string--&gt;
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

For more documentation see {{tl|editnotice load}}.

I'm a graduate student in pure mathematics at the University of New Hampshire. My interests are a bit too diverse for my own good, but seem to be settling down; my ''major'' interests include foundations (particularly approached through categorical model theory) and algebraic topology. I like to do things categorically when I can get away with it.

My interest here is mostly in hacking on the math books, and getting them to the point where I can in good conscience suggest them in place of traditional textbooks for the courses I teach.</text>

'''Editnotices''' are message boxes shown above the edit window when a user edits a page. All users can create editnotices for their user and talk pages, but editnotices for other namespaces can be created and edited only by [[Wikibooks:Administrators|administrators]].

To use editnotices, you should have a basic understanding of the concept of Wikibooks [[WB:NS|namespaces]]; that is, a set of Wikibooks pages whose names begin with a prefix recognized by the [[MediaWiki]] software, followed by a colon, or in the case of the main namespace, with no prefix.

Some of the message boxes you see when editing a page (or viewing the source of a protected page) are not editnotices; instead, they are [[Special:AllMessages|MediaWiki interface messages]].

== Editnotice links ==

When a page is edited red or blue links are often displayed at the top of the page looking like this:

&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; float: right; margin: 0px 0.8em; padding: 0; line-height: 1em;&quot;&gt; &lt;small&gt;[[This page should not exist|Page notice]]&lt;/small&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
{{clear}}

Or like this:

&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; float: right; margin: 0px 0.8em; padding: 0; line-height: 1em;&quot;&gt; &lt;small&gt;[[Example|Book/group notice]] &amp;nbsp; [[This page should not exist|Page notice]]&lt;/small&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
{{clear}}

They are links to the group and page editnotices of the page. Administrators always see both links, even if the notices have not yet been created, since they can create and edit the editnotices. Normal users only see the red &quot;Page notice&quot; link on their own user and user talk basepage, since they can create and edit such notices. Normal users also see blue links to group and page notices if they already have been created, so they can find and view the source of the notice. But normal users still can't edit those notices, except the ones in userspace.

See also the section [[#Hiding the red links|Hiding the red links]] below.

== Editnotices ==

When creating editnotices, the template {{tl|editnotice}} can be used for formatting; see its template page for how to use it. See  [[:Category:Editnotice templates]] for specialized editnotices.

=== User and user discussion ===

Insert as an [[Template:Editnotice userpage|edit notice for a user page]] as &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Editnotice userpage}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

For example:
{{editnotice
| id =
| header =ExampleUser's User Page
| headerstyle =font-size: 150%;
| text = Hello. You're editing the userpage of ExampleUser. Please make your edits friendly as this is a userpage and is only supposed to be edited by the user!
| textstyle =font-size: 120%;
| image =[[File:Wikibooks-logo.svg|80px|link=|alt=]]
}}

This appears on top of the editing box screen when people would like to edit your page. The '''ExampleUser''' part will automatically change to your username.

Anyone can create an editnotice for a user or user talk page. (But editnotices for user subpages can only be created by administrator.) User page editnotice names take one of these forms:
:&lt;code&gt;User:Example/Editnotice&lt;/code&gt;
:&lt;code&gt;User talk:Example/Editnotice&lt;/code&gt;

You can create an editnotice for your own user or talk page with a preloaded {{tl|editnotice}} template by using these links:
:{{preload|Special:MyPage/Editnotice|Create your user page notice|Template:Editnotice/preload}}
:{{preload|Special:MyTalk/Editnotice|Create your user discussion page notice|Template:Editnotice/preload}}

=== Other namespaces ===

Editnotices for other namespaces and for user subpages can be created and edited only by administrators. There are three main types of editnotices:
:Namespace notices&amp;nbsp;– Displays on all pages within a namespace.
:Group notices&amp;nbsp;– Displays on a page and all its subpages.  Useful for having a notice for an entire book.
:Page notices&amp;nbsp;– Displays only on the page it belongs to.

Editnotice names take one of these forms:

:Namespace notices&amp;nbsp;– See below.
:Group notices&amp;nbsp;– &lt;code&gt;Template:Editnotices/Group/''&lt;Full page name of the root page or book name&gt;''&lt;/code&gt;
:Page notices&amp;nbsp;– &lt;code&gt;Template:Editnotices/Page/''&lt;Full page name&gt;''&lt;/code&gt;

=== Creating editnotices ===
To edit a namespace-wide editnotice, click on the respective link below. To create an editnotice for a page, enter the page name after the slash or colon and click &quot;Create&quot;. For your own User: and User talk: pages, you don't need to type anything, just click &quot;Create&quot;.

Page names are case sensitive— if the page shows the first character as capitalized, then it ''must'' be capitalized when entered here.

To request the creation of an editnotice if you are not an admin:
* Open the edit window of the page where you want to create an editnotice
* Place this request on the page: {{tl|editnotice talkpagename}}
* Preview the page and follow the link to the editnotice's talkpage.
* On the editnotice's talkpage write up the exact markup you want for the editnotice, then place an {{tl|editprotected}} request above it

Another way to find the link for an editnotice is to:
* Open the edit window of the page where you want to create an editnotice
* Place this code on the page: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[{{editnotice pagename}}]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
* Preview the page and follow the link to the editnotice

=== Batch of identical editnotices ===
If you need to display a batch of identical editnotices, please create a single template which you then transclude in each editnotice, to allow easier modification and maintenance. You can place such templates in [[:Category:Editnotice templates]].

== When displayed ==

Editnotices are displayed when editing a page, but their content can also be useful when just viewing a page so they are also displayed in these cases:

* Page notices are displayed on top of .css and .js pages in MediaWiki space. See for instance the notice at the top of [[MediaWiki:Common.css]] that begins &quot;''This is the CSS for all skins''&quot;. The namespace notice is not displayed and MediaWiki space doesn't have group notices.

* In any namespace, when a non-admin &quot;views the source&quot; of a protected page, or an IP-user views the source of a semi-protected page. The group and page notices are displayed, but not the namespace notices.

When the editnotices are shown in &quot;view mode&quot; the loading system feeds them &quot;&lt;code&gt;notice action = view&lt;/code&gt;&quot;. This can be used inside the editnotices like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{#ifeq: {{{notice action|}}} | view
| &lt;!--A non-admin is &quot;viewing the source&quot; of a protected page--&gt;
| &lt;!--A user with sufficient rights is editing the page--&gt;
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Hiding the red links ==

If you don't want to see the red &quot;Group notice&quot; and &quot;Page notice&quot; links, then add the below markup to your [[Special:MyPage/skin.css|personal CSS]], then wait a minute, then [[MediaWiki:Clearyourcache|bypass]] your browser cache.

&lt;source lang=&quot;css&quot;&gt;
/* Hide the red &quot;Group notice&quot; and &quot;Page notice&quot; links. */
.editnotice-area .editnotice-redlink { 
  display: none !important;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

If you don't want to see any of the &quot;Group notice&quot; and &quot;Page notice links, then use this markup instead:

&lt;source lang=&quot;css&quot;&gt;
/* Hide all the &quot;Group notice&quot; and &quot;Page notice&quot; links. */
.editnotice-area .editnotice-link { 
  display: none !important;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

== Listing editnotices ==
* [[Special:PrefixIndex/MediaWiki:Editnotice]]&amp;nbsp;– The main MediaWiki namespace notices, and any lingering MediaWiki page notices.
* [[Special:PrefixIndex/Template:Editnotices]]&amp;nbsp;– All templates and sub-templates with names beginning with &quot;Template:Editnotices...&quot;.
* [[Special:WhatLinksHere/Template:Editnotice]]&amp;nbsp;– Pages that use the {{tl|editnotice}} template.

== Technical details ==
{{namespaces}}
Anything put on the pages [[MediaWiki:Editnotice-0]] through [[MediaWiki:Editnotice-15]], [[MediaWiki:Editnotice-102]], [[MediaWiki:Editnotice-103]], and [[MediaWiki:Editnotice-108]] through [[MediaWiki:Editnotice-113]] will appear as an editnotice for ''every'' page in an entire namespace.  Editnotice-0 is for mainspace pages, Editnotice-1 for the talk space pages, Editnotice-2 for user space pages, etcetera.

The template {{tl|editnotice load}} has been put on each of those MediaWiki namespace pages.  The template causes each article to use a subpage specific to it as its editnotice rather than using a namespace-wide editnotice.

The editnotice load system uses two methods of storing the editnotices:

* For User and User talk space the editnotice is stored as a subpage of the user or talk page named /Editnotice. This method allows users to edit these notices.
* For all other namespaces and for user sub-pages the editnotice is stored as a subpage of [[Template:Editnotices]]. Template:Editnotices and its subpages are protected by the [[MediaWiki:Titleblacklist]] so that only administrators can create and edit them.

Although all of the namespaces could initially store editnotices directly as MediaWiki messages, this was found to cause performance issues as the MediaWiki namespace grew. The display of MediaWiki editnotices for namespaces that have the MediaWiki subpage feature has been disabled; even though an editnotice can be created as a MediaWiki message for these namespaces, it will not show. For consistency, and to keep the MediaWiki namespace clean, all editnotices are now stored as subpages of Template:Editnotices. This means we again can create editnotices for all namespaces.

Group notices stored as &lt;code&gt;Template:Editnotices/Group/...&lt;/code&gt; can be created for pages in all namespaces except File (image), MediaWiki, Subject, and Transwiki. The reason is that those namespaces don't have the MediaWiki subpage feature, thus group notices would not be meaningful in those namespaces. The talk spaces of those namespaces understand subpages and can use group notices, although group notices are usually not meaningful there either.

== Emailnotice ==
Emailnotices allow registered users with a confirmed email to display a custom message at [[Special:EmailUser]] for their username. Emailnotices are located at [[Special:MyPage/Emailnotice]] (&lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[{{fullurl:Special:Search|redirs=1&amp;search=%2Femailnotice&amp;fulltext=Search&amp;ns2=1&amp;title=Special%3ASearch&amp;advanced=1&amp;fulltext=Advanced+search}} uses]&lt;/span&gt;). The system was implemented in [[MediaWiki:Emailpagetext]].

== Related templates ==
* {{tl|editnotice}}&amp;nbsp;– A template for making editnotices.
* {{tl|editnotice pagename}}&amp;nbsp;– Returns the pagename for the editnotice for the current page.
* {{tl|editnotice talkpagename}}&amp;nbsp;- Returns the talkpage name for the editnotice for the current page.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi there. This is the person who edited the dates- my name's Mike- on February 16, 2011.  I actually made the edits, then realized that I'd have to do it again if I wanted to create an account. Basically, I put the edits in because I am a practicing attorney, only in my third year, and I have had confusion in my own practice about the computation of time, as apparently, between my 2005 Civil Procedure appendix book that I still have from law school, and 2008 when I began really practicing civil litigation on the federal level, they changed the computation of time requirements and many of the deadlines. This led to consternation in my own practice, and I hope to save others the trouble.  If you go to Westlaw, Lexis, or the free version of the FRCP that Cornell Law puts on the internet via the LII, you'll see that the &quot;20 day&quot; time period is no longer good law; it's now 21 calendar days. Same with the time to answer following the court's ruling or an order continuing a Rule 12 motion. These are the changes I made. Also: this is a great, great article/book that you made. I am emailing myself the link and am going to print it out and keep it for a quick &quot;cheat sheet.&quot; Great work!

Best,
Mike</text>

      <comment>Better LaTeX for large brackets.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">In this section, we present alternative ways of solving triangles by using '''half-angle formulae'''.

Given a triangle with sides ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'', define

:''s'' = {{frac|1|2}}(''a''+''b''+''c'').

Note that

:''a''+''b''-''c'' = 2''s''-2''c'' = 2(''s''-''c'')

and similarly for ''a'' and ''b''.

We have from the cosine theorem

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \cos(A) = {{b^2+c^2-a^2} \over {2bc}}&lt;/math&gt;

== Sin(A/2) ==
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle 2\sin^2\left(\frac{A}{2}\right) = 1 - \cos(A) = 1 - {{b^2+c^2-a^2} \over {2bc}} = {{(a+b-c)(a-b+c)} \over {2bc}} = {{2(s-b)(s-c)} \over {bc}}&lt;/math&gt;

So

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \sin\left(\frac{A}{2}\right) = \sqrt{{(s-b)(s-c)} \over {bc}}&lt;/math&gt;.

By symmetry, there are similar expressions involving the angles B and C.

Note that in this expression and all the others for half angles, the positive square root is always taken.  This is because a half-angle of a triangle must always be less than a right angle.

== Cos(A/2) and tan(A/2) ==
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle 2\cos^2\left(\frac{A}{2}\right) = 1 + \cos(A) = 1 + {{b^2+c^2-a^2} \over {2bc}} = {{(a+b+c)(b+c-a)} \over {2bc}} = {{2s(s-a)} \over {bc}}&lt;/math&gt;

So

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \cos\left(\frac{A}{2}\right) = \sqrt{{s(s-a)} \over {bc}}&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \tan\left(\frac{A}{2}\right) = {\sin(\frac{A}{2}) \over \cos(\frac{A}{2})} = \sqrt{{(s-b)(s-c)} \over {s(s-a)}}&lt;/math&gt;.

Again, by symmetry there are similar expressions involving the angles B and C.

== Sin(A) and Heron's formula ==
A formula for sin(A) can be found using either of the following identities:

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \sin(A) = 2 \sin\left(\frac{A}{2}\right)\cos\left(\frac{A}{2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \sin(A) = \sqrt{(1+\cos(A))(1-\cos(A))}&lt;/math&gt;

These both lead to

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \sin(A) = \frac{2}{bc} \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}&lt;/math&gt;

The positive square root is always used, since A cannot exceed 180º.  Again, by symmetry there are similar expressions involving the angles B and C.  These expressions provide an alternative proof of the sine theorem.

Since the area of a triangle

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \Delta = \frac{1}{2} bc \sin(A)&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \Delta = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}&lt;/math&gt;

which is Heron's formula.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The [http://www.openssh.org/ OpenSSH] suite provides secure remote access and file transfer.  Since its initial release, it has grown to become the most widely used implementation of the SSH protocol.  During the first ten years of its existence, ssh has largely replaced older corresponding unencrypted tools and protocols.  
The OpenSSH client is included by default in most operating system distributions, including OS X, Linux, BSD and Solaris.  Any day you use the Internet, you are using and relying on dozens if not hundreds of machines operated and maintained using OpenSSH.  A survey in 2008 showed that of the SSH servers found running, just over 80% were OpenSSH.  &lt;ref name=&quot;OpenSSH_marketshare_2008&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.openssh.com/usage/ssh-stats.html
 |title=Statistics from the current scan results |publisher=OpenSSH.org |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OpenSSH was first released towards the end of 1999.  It is the latest step in a very long and useful history of networked computing, remote access and telecommuting.

This book is for fellow users of OpenSSH to help them save effort and time through using OpenSSH, and especially SFTP, where it makes sense to use it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Encryption has been a hot topic in computing for a long time.  It became a high priority item in national and international politics in 1991 when Dr. Phil Zimmermann at MIT first published Pretty Good Privacy (PGP).  Encryption went from a specialty to a requirement with the arrival the first web shops and increasing volumes of money changed hands online.  By 1996 encryption became essential for e-business.  By 2000 it became recognized as a general, essential prerequisite in electronic communication.  Currently, 2010, there is almost no chance of maintaining control over or integrity of any networked machine for more than a few minutes without the help of encryption.  

Currently much communication over computer networks is still done without encryption.  That would be most communication, if inadequate encryption is also taken into account.  This is despite years of warnings, government recommendations, best practice guidelines and incidents.  As a result, any machine connected to the network can intercept communication that passes over that network.  The eavesdroppers are many and varied.  They include administrators, staff, employers, criminals, corporate spies, and even governments.  Corporate espionage alone has become an enormous burden and barrier.  

Businesses are well aware of dumpster diving and take precautions to shred all paper documents.  But what about electronic information?  Contracts and negotiations, trade secrets, patent applications, decisions and minutes, customer data and invoicing, personnel data, financial and tax records, calendars and schedules, product designs and production notes, training materials, and even regular correspondence go over the net daily.  Archived materials, even if they are not accessed directly, are usually on machines that are available and accessed for other reasons.  

Many company managers and executives are still unaware that their communications and documents are so easily intercepted, in spite of apparent and expensive access restrictions.  In many cases these can be show to be ineffectual and at best purely cosmetic.  Security Theater is one aspect and in the field of security it is more common to find snake oil than authentic solutions.  Still, there is little public demonstration of awareness of the magnitude of corporate espionage nowadays or the cost of failure.  Even failure to act has its costs.  
Not only is sensitive data available if left unencrypted, but also trends in less sensitive data can be spotted with a large enough sampling.  A very large amount of information can be inferred even from lesser communications.  Data mining is now a well-known concept as is the so-called wireless wiretap.  With the increase in online material and activity, encryption is more relevant than ever even if many years have passed since the issues were first brought into the limelight.

==Excerpt of ssh-1.0.0  README from July 12, 1995==

Tatu Ylönen, then at the Helsinki University of Technology, wrote the README&lt;ref name=&quot;SSH-1.0.0-README&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/mirrors/ftp.cs.hut.fi/pub/ssh/old/
 |title=SSH 1.0.0 README |publisher=FUNET |year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; accompanying the early versions of his Open Source software, SSH.  The following is an excerpt about why encryption is important.

...

WHY TO USE SECURE SHELL

Currently, almost all communications in computer networks are done
without encryption.  As a consequence, anyone who has access to any
machine connected to the network can listen in on any communication.
This is being done by hackers, curious administrators, employers,
criminals, industrial spies, and governments.  Some networks leak off
enough electromagnetic radiation that data may be captured even from a
distance.

When you log in, your password goes in the network in plain
text.  Thus, any listener can then use your account to do any evil he
likes.  Many incidents have been encountered worldwide where crackers
have started programs on workstations without the owners knowledge
just to listen to the network and collect passwords.  Programs for
doing this are available on the Internet, or can be built by a
competent programmer in a few days.

Any information that you type or is printed on your screen can be
monitored, recorded, and analyzed.  For example, an intruder who has
penetrated a host connected to a major network can start a program
that listens to all data flowing in the network, and whenever it
encounters a 16-digit string, it checks if it is a valid credit card
number (using the check digit), and saves the number plus any
surrounding text (to catch expiration date and holder) in a file.
When the intruder has collected a few thousand credit card numbers, he
makes smallish mail-order purchases from a few thousand stores around
the world, and disappears when the goods arrive but before anyone
suspects anything.

Businesses have trade secrets, patent applications in preparation,
pricing information, subcontractor information, client data, personnel
data, financial information, etc.  Currently, anyone with access to
the network (any machine on the network) can listen to anything that
goes in the network, without any regard to normal access restrictions.

Many companies are not aware that information can so easily be
recovered from the network.  They trust that their data is safe
since nobody is supposed to know that there is sensitive information
in the network, or because so much other data is transferred in the
network.  This is not a safe policy.

Individual persons also have confidential information, such as
diaries, love letters, health care documents, information about their
personal interests and habits, professional data, job applications,
tax reports, political documents, unpublished manuscripts, etc.


There is also another frightening aspect about the poor security of
communications.  Computer storage and analysis capability has
increased so much that it is feasible for governments, major
companies, and criminal organizations to automatically analyze,
identify, classify, and file information about millions of people over
the years.  Because most of the work can be automated, the cost of
collecting this information is getting very low.  

Government agencies may be able to monitor major communication
systems, telephones, fax, computer networks, etc., and passively
collect huge amounts of information about all people with any
significant position in the society.  Most of this information is not
sensitive, and many people would say there is no harm in someone
getting that information.  However, the information starts to get
sensitive when someone has enough of it.  You may not mind someone
knowing what you bought from the shop one random day, but you might
not like someone knowing every small thing you have bought in the last
ten years.

If the government some day starts to move into a more totalitarian
direction, there is considerable danger of an ultimate totalitarian
state.  With enough information (the automatically collected records
of an individual can be manually analyzed when the person becomes
interesting), one can form a very detailed picture of the individual's
interests, opinions, beliefs, habits, friends, lovers, weaknesses,
etc.  This information can be used to 1) locate any persons who might
oppose the new system 2) use deception to disturb any organizations
which might rise against the government 3) eliminate difficult
individuals without anyone understanding what happened.  Additionally,
if the government can monitor communications too effectively, it
becomes too easy to locate and eliminate any persons distributing
information contrary to the official truth.

Fighting crime and terrorism are often used as grounds for domestic
surveillance and restricting encryption.  These are good goals, but
there is considerable danger that the surveillance data starts to get
used for questionable purposes.  I find that it is better to tolerate
a small amount of crime in the society than to let the society become
fully controlled.  I am in favor of a fairly strong state, but the
state must never get so strong that people become unable to spread
contra-offical information and unable to overturn the government if it
is bad.  The danger is that when you notice that the government is
too powerful, it is too late.  Also, the real power may not be where
the official government is. 

For these reasons (privacy, protecting trade secrets, and making it
more difficult to create a totalitarian state), I think that strong
cryptography should be integrated to the tools we use every day.
Using it causes no harm (except for those who wish to monitor
everything), but not using it can cause huge problems.  If the society
changes in undesirable ways, then it will be to late to start
encrypting.

Encryption has had a &quot;military&quot; or &quot;classified&quot; flavor to it.  There
are no longer any grounds for this.  The military can and will use its
own encryption; that is no excuse to prevent the civilians from
protecting their privacy and secrets.  Information on strong
encryption is available in every major bookstore, scientific library,
and patent office around the world, and strong encryption software is
available in every country on the Internet.

Some people would like to make it illegal to use encryption, or to
force people to use encryption that governments can break.  This
approach offers no protection if the government turns bad.  Also, the
&quot;bad guys&quot; will be using true strong encryption anyway.  Thus, any
&quot;key escrow encryption&quot; or whatever it might be called only serves to
help monitor the ordinary people and petty criminals; it does not help
against powerful criminals, terrorists, or espionage, because they
will know how to use strong encryption anyway.

...

Thanks also go to Philip Zimmermann, whose PGP software and the
associated legal battle provided inspiration, motivation, and many
useful techniques, and to Bruce Schneier whose book Applied
Cryptography has done a great service in widely distributing knowledge
about cryptographic methods.

==Phil Zimmermann on encryption and privacy, from 1991, updated 1999==

Phil Zimmermann wrote the encryption tool Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) in 1991 to promote privacy and to help keep encryption, and thus privacy, legal around the world.  Considerable difficulty occurred in the United States until PGP was published outside and re-imported in a very visible, public manner.   

{{quote|
'''Why I Wrote PGP'''&lt;br /&gt;
''Part of the Original 1991 PGP User's Guide (updated in 1999)''

&quot;Whatever you do will be insignificant, but it is very important that you do it.&quot;

–Mahatma Gandhi.

It's personal. It's private. And it's no one's business but yours. You may be planning a political campaign, discussing your taxes, or having a secret romance. Or you may be communicating with a political dissident in a repressive country. Whatever it is, you don't want your private electronic mail (email) or confidential documents read by anyone else. There's nothing wrong with asserting your privacy. Privacy is as apple-pie as the Constitution.

The right to privacy is spread implicitly throughout the Bill of Rights. But when the United States Constitution was framed, the Founding Fathers saw no need to explicitly spell out the right to a private conversation. That would have been silly. Two hundred years ago, all conversations were private. If someone else was within earshot, you could just go out behind the barn and have your conversation there. No one could listen in without your knowledge. The right to a private conversation was a natural right, not just in a philosophical sense, but in a law-of-physics sense, given the technology of the time.

But with the coming of the information age, starting with the invention of the telephone, all that has changed. Now most of our conversations are conducted electronically. This allows our most intimate conversations to be exposed without our knowledge. Cellular phone calls may be monitored by anyone with a radio. Electronic mail, sent across the Internet, is no more secure than cellular phone calls. Email is rapidly replacing postal mail, becoming the norm for everyone, not the novelty it was in the past.

Until recently, if the government wanted to violate the privacy of ordinary citizens, they had to expend a certain amount of expense and labor to intercept and steam open and read paper mail. Or they had to listen to and possibly transcribe spoken telephone conversation, at least before automatic voice recognition technology became available. This kind of labor-intensive monitoring was not practical on a large scale. It was only done in important cases when it seemed worthwhile. This is like catching one fish at a time, with a hook and line. Today, email can be routinely and automatically scanned for interesting keywords, on a vast scale, without detection. This is like driftnet fishing. And exponential growth in computer power is making the same thing possible with voice traffic.

Perhaps you think your email is legitimate enough that encryption is unwarranted. If you really are a law-abiding citizen with nothing to hide, then why don't you always send your paper mail on postcards? Why not submit to drug testing on demand? Why require a warrant for police searches of your house? Are you trying to hide something? If you hide your mail inside envelopes, does that mean you must be a subversive or a drug dealer, or maybe a paranoid nut? Do law-abiding citizens have any need to encrypt their email?

What if everyone believed that law-abiding citizens should use postcards for their mail? If a nonconformist tried to assert his privacy by using an envelope for his mail, it would draw suspicion. Perhaps the authorities would open his mail to see what he's hiding. Fortunately, we don't live in that kind of world, because everyone protects most of their mail with envelopes. So no one draws suspicion by asserting their privacy with an envelope. There's safety in numbers. Analogously, it would be nice if everyone routinely used encryption for all their email, innocent or not, so that no one drew suspicion by asserting their email privacy with encryption. Think of it as a form of solidarity.

Senate Bill 266, a 1991 omnibus anticrime bill, had an unsettling measure buried in it. If this non-binding resolution had become real law, it would have forced manufacturers of secure communications equipment to insert special &quot;trap doors&quot; in their products, so that the government could read anyone's encrypted messages. It reads, &quot;It is the sense of Congress that providers of electronic communications services and manufacturers of electronic communications service equipment shall ensure that communications systems permit the government to obtain the plain text contents of voice, data, and other communications when appropriately authorized by law.&quot; It was this bill that led me to publish PGP electronically for free that year, shortly before the measure was defeated after vigorous protest by civil libertarians and industry groups.

The 1994 Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) mandated that phone companies install remote wiretapping ports into their central office digital switches, creating a new technology infrastructure for &quot;point-and-click&quot; wiretapping, so that federal agents no longer have to go out and attach alligator clips to phone lines. Now they will be able to sit in their headquarters in Washington and listen in on your phone calls. Of course, the law still requires a court order for a wiretap. But while technology infrastructures can persist for generations, laws and policies can change overnight. Once a communications infrastructure optimized for surveillance becomes entrenched, a shift in political conditions may lead to abuse of this new-found power. Political conditions may shift with the election of a new government, or perhaps more abruptly from the bombing of a federal building.

A year after the CALEA passed, the FBI disclosed plans to require the phone companies to build into their infrastructure the capacity to simultaneously wiretap 1 percent of all phone calls in all major U.S. cities. This would represent more than a thousandfold increase over previous levels in the number of phones that could be wiretapped. In previous years, there were only about a thousand court-ordered wiretaps in the United States per year, at the federal, state, and local levels combined. It's hard to see how the government could even employ enough judges to sign enough wiretap orders to wiretap 1 percent of all our phone calls, much less hire enough federal agents to sit and listen to all that traffic in real time. The only plausible way of processing that amount of traffic is a massive Orwellian application of automated voice recognition technology to sift through it all, searching for interesting keywords or searching for a particular speaker's voice. If the government doesn't find the target in the first 1 percent sample, the wiretaps can be shifted over to a different 1 percent until the target is found, or until everyone's phone line has been checked for subversive traffic. The FBI said they need this capacity to plan for the future. This plan sparked such outrage that it was defeated in Congress. But the mere fact that the FBI even asked for these broad powers is revealing of their agenda.

Advances in technology will not permit the maintenance of the status quo, as far as privacy is concerned. The status quo is unstable. If we do nothing, new technologies will give the government new automatic surveillance capabilities that Stalin could never have dreamed of. The only way to hold the line on privacy in the information age is strong cryptography.

You don't have to distrust the government to want to use cryptography. Your business can be wiretapped by business rivals, organized crime, or foreign governments. Several foreign governments, for example, admit to using their signals intelligence against companies from other countries to give their own corporations a competitive edge. Ironically, the United States government's restrictions on cryptography in the 1990's have weakened U.S. corporate defenses against foreign intelligence and organized crime.

The government knows what a pivotal role cryptography is destined to play in the power relationship with its people. In April 1993, the Clinton administration unveiled a bold new encryption policy initiative, which had been under development at the National Security Agency (NSA) since the start of the Bush administration. The centerpiece of this initiative was a government-built encryption device, called the Clipper chip, containing a new classified NSA encryption algorithm. The government tried to encourage private industry to design it into all their secure communication products, such as secure phones, secure faxes, and so on. AT&amp;T put Clipper into its secure voice products. The catch: At the time of manufacture, each Clipper chip is loaded with its own unique key, and the government gets to keep a copy, placed in escrow. Not to worry, though–the government promises that they will use these keys to read your traffic only &quot;when duly authorized by law.&quot; Of course, to make Clipper completely effective, the next logical step would be to outlaw other forms of cryptography.

The government initially claimed that using Clipper would be voluntary, that no one would be forced to use it instead of other types of cryptography. But the public reaction against the Clipper chip was strong, stronger than the government anticipated. The computer industry monolithically proclaimed its opposition to using Clipper. FBI director Louis Freeh responded to a question in a press conference in 1994 by saying that if Clipper failed to gain public support, and FBI wiretaps were shut out by non-government-controlled cryptography, his office would have no choice but to seek legislative relief. Later, in the aftermath of the Oklahoma City tragedy, Mr. Freeh testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that public availability of strong cryptography must be curtailed by the government (although no one had suggested that cryptography was used by the bombers).

The government has a track record that does not inspire confidence that they will never abuse our civil liberties. The FBI's COINTELPRO program targeted groups that opposed government policies. They spied on the antiwar movement and the civil rights movement. They wiretapped the phone of Martin Luther King. Nixon had his enemies list. Then there was the Watergate mess. More recently, Congress has either attempted to or succeeded in passing laws curtailing our civil liberties on the Internet. Some elements of the Clinton White House collected confidential FBI files on Republican civil servants, conceivably for political exploitation. And some overzealous prosecutors have shown a willingness to go to the ends of the Earth in pursuit of exposing sexual indiscretions of political enemies. At no time in the past century has public distrust of the government been so broadly distributed across the political spectrum, as it is today.

Throughout the 1990s, I figured that if we want to resist this unsettling trend in the government to outlaw cryptography, one measure we can apply is to use cryptography as much as we can now while it's still legal. When use of strong cryptography becomes popular, it's harder for the government to criminalize it. Therefore, using PGP is good for preserving democracy. If privacy is outlawed, only outlaws will have privacy.

It appears that the deployment of PGP must have worked, along with years of steady public outcry and industry pressure to relax the export controls. In the closing months of 1999, the Clinton administration announced a radical shift in export policy for crypto technology. They essentially threw out the whole export control regime. Now, we are finally able to export strong cryptography, with no upper limits on strength. It has been a long struggle, but we have finally won, at least on the export control front in the US. Now we must continue our efforts to deploy strong crypto, to blunt the effects increasing surveillance efforts on the Internet by various governments. And we still need to entrench our right to use it domestically over the objections of the FBI.

PGP empowers people to take their privacy into their own hands. There has been a growing social need for it. That's why I wrote it.

OpenSSH: Secure Shell integrated into OpenBSD
Secure communications package no longer third-party add-on

[October 25, 1999: Calgary, Canada] -- The OpenBSD developers are
pleased to announce the release of OpenSSH, a free implementation
of the popular Secure Shell encrypted communications package. 
OpenSSH, to be released with OpenBSD 2.6, is compatible with
both SSH 1.3 and 1.5 protocols and dodges most restrictions on the 
free distribution of strong cryptography.

OpenSSH is based on a free release of SSH by Tatu Ylonen, with major
changes to remove proprietary code and bring it up to current
security and functionality standards.  Secure Shell operates like the
popular TELNET remote terminal package but with an encrypted link
between the user and the remote server.  SSH also allows &quot;tunnelling&quot;
of network services through the scrambled connection for added
privacy. OpenSSH has been tested to interoperate with ssh-1.2.27 from 
SSH Communications, and the TTSSH and SecureCRT Windows clients.

&quot;Network sessions involving strong cryptographic security are a
requirement in the modern world,&quot; says lead developer Theo de Raadt.
&quot;Everyone needs this.  People using the telnet or rlogin protocols are
not aware of the extreme danger posed by password sniffing and session
hijacking.&quot;

In previous releases of OpenBSD, users were urged to download SSH as
soon as possible after installing the OS. Without SSH, terminal
sessions transmitted in clear text allow eavesdroppers on the Internet
to capture user names and password combinations and thus bypass the
security measures in the operating system.

&quot;I asked everyone `what is the first thing you do after installing
OpenBSD?' Everyone gave me the same answer:  they installed ssh,&quot; says
de Raadt.  &quot;That's a pain, so we've made it much easier.&quot;

All proprietary code in the original distribution was replaced, along
with some libraries burdened with the restrictive GNU Public License
(GPL). Much of of the actual cryptographic code was replaced by calls
to the crypto libraries built into OpenBSD. The source code is now
completely freely re-useable, and vendors are encouraged to re-use it
if they need ssh functionality.

OpenSSH relies on the Secure Sockets Layer library (libssl) which
incorporates the RSA public-key cryptography system. RSA is patented
in the US and OpenBSD developers must work around the patent
restrictions. Users outside the US may download a libssl file based
on the patent-free OpenSSL implementation. For US non-commercial
users, OpenBSD is preparing a libssl based on the patented RSAREF
code. Unfortunately, the US legal framework effectively bans US
commercial users from using OpenSSH, and curtails freedom of choice
in that market.

OpenSSH was developed and integrated into OpenBSD by Niels Provos,
Theo de Raadt, Markus Friedl for cryptographic work; Dug Song, Aaron
Campbell, and others for various non-crypto contributions; and Bob
Beck for helping with the openssl library issues. The original SSH
was written by Tatu Ylonen. Bjoern Groenvall and Holger Trapp did the
initial work to free the distribution.

OpenBSD is an Internet-based volunteer effort to produce a secure
multi-platform operating system with built-in support for
cryptography. It has been described in the press as the world's most
secure operating system. For more information about OpenSSH and 
OpenBSD, see the project Web pages at http://www.OpenBSD.org/.

==The European Union (EU) on Encryption==

During 2000, the European Commission investigated the state of international and industrial electronic espionage.  Counter-measures and solutions were investigated as well as the risks.  The result was a resolution containing a summary of the findings and a series of recommended actions for Member States to carry out and goals to meet.  
Recommendations to EU Member States from 
the European Parliament resolution ECHELON, A5-0264/2001 (emphasis added):

: &quot;29.	Urges the Commission and Member States to devise appropriate measures to promote, develop and manufacture European encryption technology and software and above all to support projects at developing user-friendly '''open-source encryption''' software;&quot;
: . . .
: &quot;33.	Calls on the Community institutions and the public administrations of the Member States to provide training for their staff and make their staff familiar with new '''encryption technologies and techniques''' by means of the necessary practical training and courses;&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;EchelonReport&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=TA&amp;reference=P5-TA-2001-0441&amp;format=XML&amp;language=EN |title=European Parliament resolution on the existence of a global system for the interception of private and commercial communications (ECHELON interception system) (2001/2098(INI))|id=ECHELON  A5-0264 2001  |publisher=European Parliament|year=2001|accessdate=2011-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was found during the investigation that businesses were the most at risk and the most vulnerable and that widespread use of open source encryption technology is to be encouraged.  The same can be said even today.

      <comment>rfc 4251</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The current set of Secure Shell protocols is SSH2.  It is a rewrite of the old, deprecated SSH1 protocol.   It contains significant improvements in security, performance, and portability.  The default is now SSH2.  OpenSSH uses the SSH protocol, connecting over TCP.   Normally, one SSH session per TCP connection is made, but multiple sessions can be multiplexed over a single TCP connection if planned that way.  

The Secure Shell protocol is an open standard.  As such, it is vendor-neutral and maintained by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).  The current protocol is described in RFC 4250 through RFC 4256 and standardized by the IETF secsh working group.  The overall structure of SSH2 is described in RFC 4251, The Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol Architecture.  

The SSH protocol is composed of three layers: the transport layer, the authentication layer, and the connection layer.

:'''SSH-CONNECT''' – The connection layer runs over the user authentication protocol.  It multiplexes many different concurrent encrypted channels into logical channels over the authenticated connection.  It allows for tunneling of login sessions and TCP-forwarding.  It provides a flow control service for these channels.  Additionally, various channel-specific options can be negotiated.  This layer manages the SSH session, session multiplexing, X11 forwarding, TCP forwarding, shell, remote program execution, invoking SFTP subsystem.    

:'''SSH-USERAUTH''' – The user authentication layer authenticates the client-side to the server.  It uses the established connection and runs on top of the   transport layer. It provides several mechanisms for user authentication.  These include password authentication, public-key or host-based authentication mechanisms, challenge-response, pluggable authentication modules (PAM), Generic Security Services API (GSSAPI) and even dongles.  

:'''SSH-TRANS''' – The transport layer provides server authentication, confidentiality and data integrity over TCP.  It does this through algorithm negotiation and a key exchange. The key exchange includes server authentication and results in a cryptographically secured connection: it provides integrity, confidentiality and optional compression. &lt;ref name=&quot;OpenSSH-Manual&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.openssh.com/manual.html |title=OpenSSH Manual Pages |publisher=OpenSSH| accessdate=2011-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the differences between the current protocol, SSH2, and the deprecated protocol, SSH1, are that SSH2 uses host keys for authentication.  Whereas SSH1 used both server and host keys to authenticate.  There's not much which can be added about the protocols which is not already covered with more detail and authority in RFC 4251 &lt;ref name=&quot;RFC42511&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4251 | title=RFC 4251:  The Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol Architecture | date=2006-01 |accessdate=2013-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  

==SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP)==

The SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) is a binary protocol to provide secure file transfer, access and management.  

SFTP on the server side was added by Markus Friedl in time for the 2.3.0 release of OpenSSH in November 2000.  Damien Miller added support for SFTP to the client side in time for 2.5.0.  Since then, many have added to both the client and the server.

===SFTP is not FTPS===

For basic file transfer, nothing more is needed than an account on the machine with the OpenSSH server.  SFTP support is built into the OpenSSH server package.  The SFTP protocol, in contrast to old FTP, has been designed from the ground up to be as secure as possible for both login and data transfer.  

Unless the use-case calls for publicly available, read-only, downloads, don't worry about trying to fiddle with FTP.  It is the protocol FTP itself that is inherently insecure.  It's great for read-only, public data transfer.  The programs vsftpd and proftpd, for example, are secure insofar as the  server software itself goes, although the protocol is insecure.  In other words the program itself is more or less fine and if you need to provide read-only, publicly available downloads then FTP maybe the right tool.  Otherwise forget about FTP.  
Nearly always when users ask for &quot;FTP&quot; they don't mean specifically the old file transfer protocol from 1971 as described in RFC 114, but a generic means of file transfer and there are many ways to solve that problem.  This is especially true since the next part of their request is usually how to make it secure.  The name &quot;FTP&quot; is frequently mis-used generically to mean any file transfer utility, much the same way as the term &quot;Coke&quot; is used in some of the Southern States to mean any carbonated soft drink, not just Coca-Cola.  Consider SFTP or, for larger groups, even SSHFS, Samba or AFS.  While old FTP succeeded very well in achieving its main goal to promote use of networked computers by allowing users at any host on the network to use the file system of any cooperating host, it cannot be made secure.  There's nothing to be done about that, so it is time to get over it.  

Again, it is the protocol itself, FTP, which is the problem.&lt;ref name=&quot;StopUsingFTP1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.jdpfu.com/2011/07/10/why-you-need-to-stop-using-ftp |title=Why You Need To Stop Using FTP  |publisher=JDPFu.com| date=2011-07-10 | accessdate=2012-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With FTP, the data, passwords and user name are all sent back and forth unencrypted.&lt;ref name=&quot;StopUsingFTP2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://olex.openlogic.com/wazi/2011/stop-using-ftp-how-to-transfer-files-securely/ |title=Stop Using FTP! How to Transfer Files Securely | author=Manolis Tzanidakis | publisher=Wazi| date=2011-09-09 | accessdate=2012-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Anyone on the client's subnet, the server's subnet or any subnet in between can 'sniff' the passwords and data when FTP is used.  With extra effort it is possible to wrap FTP inside SSL or TLS, thus creating FTPS.  However, tunneling FTP over SSL/TLS is complex to do and far from an optimum solution.  

Unfortunately name confusion combined with the large number of posts and discussions created by complex, nit-picky tasks like wrapping FTP in SSL to provide FTPS, the wrong way still turns up commonly in web searches regarding file transfer.  In contrast, easy, relatively painless solutions vanish because it is rarely necessary to post how to do those.  Also, an easy solution can be summed up in very few lines and maybe a single answer.  Thus, there is still a lot of talk online about 'securing' FTP and very little mention of using SFTP.  It's a vicious cycle that this book hopes to help break:  Difficult task means lots of discussion and noise, lots of discussion and noise means strong web presence, strong web presence means high Google ranking.  

SFTP tools are very common, but might be taken for granted and thus overlooked.  SFTP tools are just as easy to use and more functional than old FTP clients.  In fact a lot of improvements have been made in usability.  There is no shortage of common, GUI-based SFTP clients to transfer files:  Filezilla,  Konqueror, Dolphin, Nautilus, Cyberduck, Fugu, and Fetch top the list but there are many more.  Most are Free Software.
These SFTP clients are very easy to use.  For example, in Konqueror, just type in the URL to the sftp server,  where the server name or address is xx.yy.zz.aa.  
&lt;pre&gt;
sftp://xx.yy.zz.aa
&lt;/pre&gt;
If it is desirable to start with a specific directory, then that too can be specified.  
&lt;pre&gt;
sftp://xx.yy.zz.aa/var/www/pictures/
&lt;/pre&gt;
One special client worth knowing about is sshfs.  With sshfs as an SFTP client the other machine is accessible as an open folder on your machine's local file system.  In that way any program you normally have to work with files, such as openoffice.org, inkscape or gimp can access the remote machine via that folder.

===Background of FTP===

FTP is from the 1970s. It's a well proven workhorse, but from an era when if you were on the net you were supposed to be there and if there was trouble it could usually be cleared up with a short phone call or an e-mail or two. It sends the login name, password and all of the data unencrypted for anyone to intercept.  
FTP clients can connect to the FTP server in either passive or active modes.  Both active and passive modes for FTP use two ports, one for control and one for data.  In FTP Active mode, after the client makes a connection to the FTP server it then allows an incoming connection to be initiated from the server to  for data transfer.  In FTP Passive mode, after the client makes a connection to the FTP server, the server then responds with information about a second port for data transfer and the client initiates the second connection. 
Thus FTP is most relevant now as Anonymous FTP, which is still excellent for read-only downloads without login. To transfer read-only data, FTP is still one way to go, as would be using the web (HTTP or HTTPS) or a P2P protocol like bittorrent are other options for offering read-only downloads. 
Using tcpdump to show FTP activity

An illustration of how the old protocol, FTP, is insecure can be had from the utility '''tcpdump'''.  It can show what is going over the network during an Anonymous FTP session, or for that matter any FTP session.  Look at the manual page for '''tcpdump''' for an explanation of the individual arguments, but the overall result of the usage below is that it displays the first FTP or FTP-Data packets going from the client to the server and vice versa. 

The output below hows an excerpt from the output of '''tcpdump''' which captured packets between an FTP client and the FTP server, one line per packet. 

&lt;pre&gt;
$ sudo tcpdump -q -s 0 -c 10 -A -i eth0 \
&quot;tcp and ( port ftp or port ftp-data) &quot;

…

… 
&lt;/pre&gt;

As can be seen in lines 3 and 7, data, such as text, from the server is visible.  In lines 1 and 5, text entered by the user is visible, in this case including the user name and password used to log in.  Fortunately the session is Anonymous FTP, which is read-only and used for downloading.  Anonymous FTP is a rather efficient way to publish material for download.  For Anonymous FTP, the user name is always &quot;anonymous&quot; and the password the user’s e-mail address and the server's data always read-only.  

If you have the package openssh-server already installed, no further configuration of the server is needed to start using SFTP for file transfers.  Though comparatively speaking, FTPS is significantly more secure than FTP.  If you want remote remote login access, then both FTP and FTPS should be avoided.  A very large reason to avoid both is to save work.

===On FTPS===

FTPS is FTP tunneled over SSL or TLS.  A goal of FTP was to encourage the use of remote computers.  It, along with the web, has succeeded.  A goal of FTPS was to secure logins and transfers, and was a necessary step in securing file transfers with the legacy protocol.  

Since SFTP is so much easier to deploy and most systems now include both graphical and text-based SFTP clients, FTPS can really be considered deprecated for most occasions.  Some good background material can be found in the Request for Comments (RFCs) for FTP and FTPS.  There, SFTP and even HTTPS are better matches and largely supercede FTPS.  See the section on [[OpenSSH/Client Applications|Client Applications]] for an idea of the SFTP clients available.

==Privilege Separation==

Privilege separation is when a process is divided into sub-processes, each of which have just enough access to just the right services to do their part of the job.  An underlying principle is that of least privilege, which is where each process has exactly enough privileges to accomplish a task, neither more nor less.  The goal of privilege separation is to compartmentalize any corruption and prevent a corrupt process from accessing the entire system.  
Privilege separation is applied in OpenSSH by using several levels of access, some higher some lower, to run [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html sshd(8)] and its subsystems and components.  The server starts out with a privileged process which then creates an unprivileged process to work with the network traffic.  Once the user has authenticated, another unprivileged process is created with the privileges of that authenticated user.  

Privilege separation has been the default in OpenSSH since version 3.3&lt;ref name=&quot;Provos_Privilege_Separation&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.citi.umich.edu/u/provos/ssh/privsep.html |title=Privilege Separated OpenSSH  |publisher=University of Michigan| author=Nils Provos| accessdate=2011-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since version 5.9, privilege separation further applies mandatory restrictions on the system calls the privilege separated child can perform.  The intent is to prevent a compromised privilege separated child from being used to attack other hosts either by opening sockets and proxying or by probing local kernel attack surface. &lt;ref name=&quot;OpenSSH_release_notes_5.9&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.openssh.com/txt/release-5.9 |title=OpenSSH 5.9 Release Notes |publisher=OpenSSH | date=2011-09-06 | accessdate=2012-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since version 6.1, this sandboxing is the default.

== Tips ==

I've corrected the root page of [[OpenSSH]].  Most content there needs to go to subpages as it's supposed to be a contents page.  Headings start at level *two* as seen in the edit toolbar.  Level one headings are reserved for the page's title and print versions. Subpages need to have {{tl|BookCat}} on them in order to categorize them into the book's category.  For further tips, please see [[Using Wikibooks]]. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 15:56, 17 February 2011 (UTC)

== Blanking ==

Blanking a page does not delete it and the page will show up in our maintenance list of pages with no links to them.  If you are the only/major contributor to a page, please add {{tlx|speedy|Author request}} to the page to have an administrator delete it. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 13:44, 18 February 2011 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">A pattern consists of zero or more non-whitespace characters. An asterisk ('''*''') matches zero or more characters in a row, and a question mark ('''?''') matches exactly one character.  
For example, to specify a set of declarations that apply to any host in the &quot;.co.uk&quot; set of domains in '''ssh_config''', the following pattern could be used:

&lt;pre&gt;
Host *.co.uk
&lt;/pre&gt;
The following pattern would match any host in the 192.168.0.1 - 192.168.0.9 range:

&lt;pre&gt;
Host 192.168.0.?
&lt;/pre&gt;
A pattern-list is a comma-separated list of patterns.  The following list of patterns match hosts in the &quot;.co.uk&quot; or &quot;.ac.uk&quot; domains.
&lt;pre&gt;
Host *.co.uk, *.ac.uk
&lt;/pre&gt;
Individual patterns by themselves or as part of a pattern-lists may be negated by preceding them with an exclamation mark ('''!''').  The following will match any host from ''example.org'' except for ''gamma''. 

&lt;pre&gt;
Host *.example.org !gamma.example.org
&lt;/pre&gt;


For example, to allow a key to be used from anywhere within an organisation except from the dialup pool, the following entry in '''authorized_keys''' could be used:
&lt;pre&gt;
from=&quot;!*.dialup.example.com,*.example.com&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

On the client side, '''ssh''', '''scp''' and '''sftp''' provide a wide range of capabilities.  Interactive logins and file transfers are just the tip of the iceberg.  

: [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html ssh(1)] - The basic login shell-like client program.
: [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sftp&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html sftp(1)] - FTP-like program that works using the SSH protocol.
: [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=scp&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html scp(1)] - File copy program that acts like rcp(1).

: [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh_config&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html ssh_config(5)] - The client configuration file.

==The SSH client==

'''ssh''' is a program which provides the client side for secure, encrypted communications between  hosts over an insecure network.  Its main use is for logging into and  running programs on a remote host.  It can also be used to secure remote X11 connections and and forward arbitrary TCP ports to secure legacy protocols.
ssh is was made, in part, to replace insecure tools like '''rsh''' and '''telnet'''.  It has largely succeeded at this goal.  '''rsh''' and '''telnet''' are rarely seen anymore for interactive sessions or anywhere else.  
ssh can authenticate using regular passwords or with the help of a public-private key pair.  More options, such as use of Kerberos, smartcards, or one-time passwords can be configured.  

Remote login, authenticating via password:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh fred@somehost.example.org 
&lt;/pre&gt;

Another way of logging in to the same account:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -l fred somehost.example.org
&lt;/pre&gt;

Remote programs can be run interactively when the client is run via the shell on the remote host.  Or they can be run directly when passed as an argument to the SSH client.  They can even be	 pre-configured in the authentication key or the server configuration.  

Run '''uname''' on the remote machine:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -l fred  somehost.example.org  &quot;uname -a&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

See what file systems are mounted and how much space is used there:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -l fred  somehost.example.org  &quot;mount; df -h&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

It is possible to configure in great detail which programs are allowed by which accounts.  There are many combinations of options that give extra capabilities, such as re-using a single connection for multiple sessions or passing through intermediary machines.  The level of granularity can be increased even more with the help of [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sudo&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html sudo(8)].  

===ssh client environment variables===

Of course the foundation of most SSH activity is based upon the shell.  Upon a successful connection, OpenSSH sets several environment variables. 

&lt;pre&gt;
SSH_CLIENT='192.168.223.17 36673 22'
SSH_CONNECTION='192.168.223.17 36673 192.168.223.229 22'
SSH_TTY=/dev/pts/6
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''SSH_CLIENT''' shows the address of the client system, the outgoing port number on the client system and the incoming port on the server.  '''SSH_CONNECTION''' shows the address of the client, the outgoing port on the client, the address of the server and the incoming port on the server.  '''SSH_TTY''' names the pseudo-terminal device, abbreviated Ppty, on the server used by the connection.  For more information on pseudo-terminals see [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=pty&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html pty(7)], [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tty&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html tty(1)] and [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tty&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=4&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html tty(4)].  

The login session can be constrained to a single program with a predetermined set of parameters using '''ForceCommand''' in the server configuration or '''Command=''' in the authorized keys file.  In that case an additional environment variable gets set.

&lt;pre&gt;
SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND=echo &quot;hello, world&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Other variables are set depending on the user's shell settings and the system's own settings.  

===SSH client configuration options===

Configuration options can be passed to '''ssh''' as arguments, see [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html ssh(1)] for the full list.

Connect very verbose output, GSSAPI authention: 
&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -vv -K -l account host.example.org
&lt;/pre&gt;

A subset of options can be defined on the server host in the user's own authorized keys file, in conjunction with specific keys.  See [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html sshd(8)] for which subset exactly.  

&lt;pre&gt;
command=&quot;/usr/local/sbin/backup.sh&quot;,no-pty ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAQEAsY6u71N...
command=&quot;/usr/games/wump&quot;,no-port-forwarding,no-pty ssh-dss AAAAB3NzaC1kc3MAeELb...
environment=&quot;gtm_dist=/usr/local/gtm/utf8&quot;,environment=&quot;gtm_principal_editing=NOINSERT:EDITING&quot; ssh-rsa AAAA8a2s809poloh05yhh...
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note that some directives, like setting the environment variables, are disabled by default and must be changed in the server configuration before available to the client.  
More configuration directives can be set by the user in '''~/.ssh/config''' or by the system administrator in '''/etc/ssh/ssh_config'''.  These same configuration directives can be passed as arguments using '''-o'''.  See [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh_config&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html ssh_config(5)] for the full list with descriptions.  
&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -o &quot;ServerAliveInterval=60&quot; -o &quot;Compression=yes&quot; -l fred server.example.org
&lt;/pre&gt;

The system administrators of the client host can set some defaults in '''/etc/ssh/config'''.  Some of these global settings can be targeted per specific group or per user.

For example, if a particular SSH server is available via port 2022, it may be convenient to have the client use that port automatically.  Some of OpenBSD’s anoncvs servers accept SSH connections on this port.  However,  compression should not be used in this case because CVS already uses compression.  So that should be turned off.  So, one could specify something like the following in the '''$HOME/.ssh/config''' configuration file so that the default port is 2022 and the connection is made without compression:

&lt;pre&gt;
Host server.example.org
     Compression no
     Port 2022
&lt;/pre&gt;

See [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh_config&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html ssh_config(5)] for the client side and [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd_config&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html sshd_config(5)] for the server side for the full lists with descriptions.

==The SFTP client==

'''sftp''' is an interactive file transfer program which performs all operations over an encrypted SSH transport.  It may also use many features of [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh ssh(1)], such as public key authentication and compression.  It is also the name of the protocol used.  

The SFTP protocol is similar in some ways to the now venerable File Transfer Protocol (FTP), except that the entire session, including the login, is encrypted.  However, SFTP is not FTPS.  The latter old-fashioned FTP tunneled over SSH/SSL.  In contrast, SFTP is actually a whole new protocol.  '''sftp''' can also be made to start in a specific directory on the remote host.  

&lt;pre&gt;
$ sftp fred@server.example.org:/var/www
&lt;/pre&gt;

Frequently, SFTP is used to connect and log into a specified host and enter an interactive command mode.  See the manual page for [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sftp sftp(1)] for the available interactive commands.  Also, the same configuration options that work for '''ssh''' also apply to '''sftp'''.  '''sftp''' accepts all '''ssh_config''' options and these can be passed along as arguments at run time.  Some have explicit shortcuts, others can be specified by naming them in full using the '''-o''' option.

&lt;pre&gt;
$ sftp -o &quot;ServerAliveInterval=60&quot; -o &quot;Compression=yes&quot; fred@server.example.org
&lt;/pre&gt;

Another way to transfer is to write or retrieve files automatically.  If a non-interactive authentication method is used, the whole process can be automatic using batch mode.

&lt;pre&gt;
$ sftp -b session.batch -i ~/.ssh/some_key_rsa fred@server.example.org
&lt;/pre&gt;

Batch processing only works with non-interactive authentication.

==The SCP client==

'''scp''' is used for encrypted transfers of files between hosts and is used a lot like regular '''cp'''.    It is based on and a replacement for '''rcp''' from the original Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD), but uses ssh to encrypt the connection.

The '''scp''' client, unlike the SFTP client, is not based on any formal standard.  It has aimed at doing more or less what old '''rcp''' does and responding the same way.  Since the same program must be used at both ends of the connection and interoperability is required with other implementations of '''ssh'''.  Changes in functionality would probably break that interoperability, so new features are more likely to be added to '''sftp''' if at all.  Thus, it is best to lean towards using '''sftp''' instead when possible.  

Copy from remote to local:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ scp myaccount@sftp.example.org:*.txt .
&lt;/pre&gt;

Copy from local to remote, recursively:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ scp -r /etc myaccount@sftp.example.org:.
&lt;/pre&gt;

See also the '''sftp''' client above.

==GUI Clients==

There are a great many graphical utilities that support SFTP and SSH.  Many started out as transfer utilities with the outdated legacy protocol FTP and grew with the times to include SSH and SFTP support.  Sadly, many retain the epithet FTP program despite modernization.  Others are more general file managers that include SFTP support as one means of network transparency.  Most if not all provide full SFTP support including kerberos authentication.  

Below is a partial list to give an idea of the range of options available.  

'''Bluefish''' is a website managment tool and web page editor with built in support for SFTP.  Closed source competitors XMetaL and Dreamweaver are said to have at least partial support for SFTP.  Nothing for Quanta+ or Kompozer as of this writing.  
http://bluefish.openoffice.nl/

'''Cyberduck''' is a remote file browser for the Macintosh.  It supports an impressive range of protocols in addition to SFTP.  
http://cyberduck.ch/

'''Dolphin''' is a highly functional file manager for the KDE desktop, but can also be run in other environments.  It includes SFTP support

'''Fetch''', by Fetch Softworks, is a reliable and well-known SFTP client for the Macintosh.  It's been around since 1989, starting life as just an FTP client, and has many useful features combined with ease of use.  It is closed source, but academic institutions are eligible for a free of charge site license.  
http://fetchsoftworks.com/fetch/

'''Filezilla''' is presented as a FTP utility, but it has built in support for SFTP.  It is available for multiple platforms under the GPL.  
http://filezilla-project.org/

      <text xml:space="preserve">One parameter per line is allowed in the configuration file with the parameter name followed by its value or values.  Empty lines and lines starting with the hash ('''#''') are ignored.  An equal sign ('''=''') can be used instead of whitespace between the parameter name and the values.  

Values are case-sensitive, but parameter names are not.  

==System-wide Client Configuration Files==

System-wide client files set the default configuration for all users of OpenSSH clients on that system.  These defaults can be overridden, in many cases, by the user's own default settings in a local configuration file.  Both can be overridden, in many cases, by specifying various options or parameters at run time.  The prioritization is as follows:  

# run time arguments via the shell
# user's own configuration
# system-wide configuration

The first value obtained is used.

===''/etc/ssh/ssh_config''===

This file defines all the default settings for the client utilities for all users on that system.  it must be readable by all users.  The configuration options are described in detail in [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh_config&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html ssh_config(5)].

Below a shortcut is made for connecting to ''arc.example.org''.  It is enough to enter '''ssh arc''' and the rest of the information gets filled in automatically.

&lt;pre&gt;
Host arc
     Port 2022
     HostName arc.example.org
     User fred
     IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_arc
&lt;/pre&gt;

===''/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts''===

This contains the system-wide list of known host keys used to verify the identity of the remote host and thus hinder impersonation or eavesdropping.  This file should be prepared by the system administrator to contain the public host keys of all necessary hosts.  It should be world-readable. 

See '''~/.ssh/known_hosts''' below for more explanation or see [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html sshd(8)] for further details of the format of this file.

===''/etc/ssh/sshrc''===

Programs in this file are executed by '''ssh''' when the user logs in, just before the user's shell or designated program is started.  It is not run as root, but instead as the user who is logging in.  See the [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html sshd(8)] manual page in the section SSHRC for more information.

==User-specific Client Configuration Files==

Users can override the default system-wide client settings and choose their own defaults.  For situations where the same change is made repeatedly it can make save work to add them to the user's local configuration.  

===''~/.ssh/config''===

The user's own configuration file which, where applicable, overrides the settings in the global client configuration file, '''/etc/ssh/ssh_config'''.  The configuration options are described in detail in [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh_config&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html ssh_config(5)].  

This file must ''not'' be accessible to other users in any way.  Set strict permissions: read/write for the user, and not accessible by others.  It may group-writable if and only if that user is the only member of the group in question.

===''~/.ssh/environment''===

If the server is configured to accept user-supplied, automatic changes to environment variables as part of the login process, then these changes can be set in this file.  

If the server, the environment file and an authorization key all try to change the same variable, the file environment takes precedence over what a key might contain.  Either one will override any environment variables that might have been passed by '''ssh''' using '''SendEnv'''.  See also the '''AcceptEnv''' and '''PermitUserEnvironment''' directives in the manual page for [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd_config&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html sshd_config(5)].  

Authentication keys stored in '''authorized_keys''' can also be used to set variables.  

===''~/.ssh/rc''===

This is a script which is executed by [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sh&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html sh(1)] just before the user's shell or command is started.  It is not run if '''ForceCommand''' is used.  The script is run after reading the environment variables.  The corresponding global file, '''/etc/ssh/sshrc''', is not run if the user's '''rc''' script exists.

===''~/.shosts''===
===''~/.rhosts''===
'''.rhosts''' is a legacy from rsh containing a local list of trusted host-user pairs that are allowed to log in.  Login requests matching an entry are granted access.  

See also the global list of trusted host-user pairs, '''/etc/hosts.equiv'''

'''rhosts''' can be used as part of host-based authentication.  Otherwise it is recommended not to use rhosts for authentication, there are a lot of ways to misconfigure the rhosts file.

===''~/.ssh/authorized_keys''===

'''authorized_keys''' is a one-key-per-line register of public ECDSA, RSA and ED25519 keys that this account can use to log in with.  The file's contents are not highly sensitive, but the recommended permissions are read/write for the user and not accessible by others.  The whole key including options and comments must be on a single, unbroken line. 

&lt;pre&gt;
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAA...41Ev521Ei2hvz7S2QNr1zAiVaOFy5Lwc8Lo+Jk=
&lt;/pre&gt;

Lines starting with a hash (#) are ignored.  Whitespace is used to separate the key's fields.  They are, in sequence, an optional list of login options, the key type (usually ssh-dss or ssh-rsa), the key itself encoded as base64, and an optional comment.  

If a key is followed by an annotation, the comment does not need to be wrapped in quotes.  It has no effect on what the key does or how it works.  

&lt;pre&gt;
# an annotated key
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAA...zAiVaOFy5Lwc8Lo+Jk=  Fred @ Project FOOBAR
&lt;/pre&gt;

Keys can be preceded by a comma-separated list of options to affect what happens upon successful login.  See the next section, [[OpenSSH/Client_Configuration_Files#Available_key_login_options |Available key login options]], for details.  

&lt;pre&gt;
# launch tinyfugue automatically
command=&quot;/usr/bin/tinyfugue&quot; ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAA...OFy5Lwc8Lo+Jk=

# set the PATH
environment=&quot;PATH=/bin:/usr/bin/:/opt/gtm/bin&quot; ssh-rsa AAAAB3N...4Y2t1j=
&lt;/pre&gt;

The format of '''authorized_keys''' is described in the [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html sshd(8)] manual page.  Old keys should be deleted from the file when no longer needed.

===''~/.ssh/authorized_principals''===

By default this file does not exist.  If it is specified in [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd_config&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html sshd_config(5)], it contains a list of names which can be used in place of the username when authorizing a certificate.   This option is useful for role accounts, disjoint account namespaces and &quot;user@realm&quot;-style naming policies in certificates.  Principals can also be specified in '''authorized_keys'''.

===''~/.ssh/known_hosts''===

As with ''/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts'', this file contains the known keys for hosts that have been connected to in the past and is used to verify the identity of the remote host and protect against impersonation or man-in-the-middle attacks.  With each subsequent connection the key will be compared to the key provided by the remote server.   If there is a match, the connection will proceed.  If the match fails, ''ssh(1)'' will fail with an error message.  If there is no key at all listed for that remote host, then the key's fingerprint will be displayed and there will be the option to automatically add the key to the file.  This file can be created and edited manually, but if it does not exist it will be created automatically by [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html ssh(1)] when it first connects to a remote host.

===Local override of defaults===

Not all options can be set or overriden by the user.  Those options which may be set or overridden by the user can by defined at the end of the user's configuration, '''~/.ssh/config''', file by matching all hosts.  Those options which may not be set or overridden will be ignored.
&lt;pre&gt;
Host *
     ExitOnForwardFailure	yes
     Protocol	2
     ServerAliveInterval	400
&lt;/pre&gt;

==Available key login options==

The login options available for use in the local user authorized keys file might be overridden or blocked by the server's own settings.  

===cert-authority===

Specifies that the listed key is a certification authority (CA) trusted to validate signed certificates for user authentication.  Certificates may encode access restrictions similar to key options.  If both certificate restrictions and key restrictions are present, then the most restrictive union of the two is applied.  

===command=&quot;''program''&quot;===

Specifies a program, with options, that is executed when this key is used for authentication.  

The program is run on a pty if the client requests it, otherwise the default is to run without a tty.  The default, running without a tty, provides an 8-bit clean channel.  If the default has been changed, specify no-pty to get an 8-bit clean channel.
&lt;pre&gt;  
no-pty,command=&quot;&quot; ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAA...OFy5Lwc8Lo+Jk=
&lt;/pre&gt;

Quotes provided in the program's options must be escaped using a backslash.  ('\')
&lt;pre&gt;
command=&quot;sh -c \&quot;mysqldump db1 -u fred1 -p\&quot;&quot; ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc...Lwc8OFy5Lo+kU=
&lt;/pre&gt;

This option applies to execution of the shell, another program or subsystem.  Thus any other program specified by the user is ignored, but the program originally specified by the client remains available as the environment variable '''SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND'''.  

This way of forcing a program is useful to restrict a key to a single, specific operation, such as a remote backup.  However, TCP and X11 forwarding are still allowed unless explicitly disabled elsewhere.

===environment=&quot;''NAME''=''value''&quot;===

Sets the value of an environment variable when this key is used to log in.  It overrides default values of the variable, if it exists.  This option can be repeated to set multiple variables.  
This option is only allowed if the '''PermitUserEnvironment''' option is set.  The default is disabled, and this option becomes disabled automatically when '''UseLogin''' is enabled.

===from=&quot;''pattern-list''&quot;===

The canonical name of the remote host or its IP address required in addition to the key.              Addresses and hostnames can be listed using a comma-separated list of patterns, see PATTERNS in [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh_config&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html ssh_config(5)] for more information on patterns, or the CIDR address/masklen notation.

===no-agent-forwarding===

Forbids authentication agent forwarding when this key is used for authentication.

===no-port-forwarding===

Forbids TCP forwarding and any port forward requests by the client will return an error when this key is used for authentication.  
===no-pty===
tty allocation is prohibited and any request to allocate a pty will fail.  
===no-user-rc===
Use the '''no-user-rc''' option in '''authorized_keys''' to disable execution of '''~/.ssh/rc'''

===no-X11-forwarding===
Prevents X11 forwarding when this key is used for authentication, and requests to forward X11 will return an error.

===permitopen=&quot;''host'':''port''&quot;===
Limits local port forwarding ('''ssh -L''') to only the specified host and port.  IPv6 addresses can be specified with an alternative syntax: host/port.  Multiple permitopen options may be used and must be separated by commas.  No pattern matching is performed on the specified host names, they must be literal host names or IP addresses.  Used in conjunction with agent-forwarding.

===principals=&quot;''name1''[,''name2'',...]&quot;===
Specify a list of names that may be used in place of the username when authorizing a certificate trusted via the [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd_config&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html sshd_config(5)] '''TrustedCAKeys''' option.

===tunnel=&quot;''n''&quot;===
Select a specific [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tun&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html tun(4)] device on the server.  Otherwise when a tunnel device is requested without this option the next available device will be used.

==User-specific Keys==
'''ssh''' uses ECDSA, RSA or DSA key pairs to verify hosts or authenticate users.  Individual user accounts can maintain their own list of keys or certificates for authentication or  to verify the identity of remote hosts.  

===Public Keys from other Hosts – ~/.ssh/known_hosts===
'''known_hosts''' is for verifying the identity of other systems.  It contains a list of public keys for all the hosts which the user has logged into.  It can also include public keys for hosts that the user plans to log into but are not already in the system-wide list of known host keys.  '''ssh''' automatically adds keys to the user file, but they can be added manually as well.  Usually when connecting to a host for the first time, ssh adds the remote host's public key to the user's '''known_hosts''' file.  

The format is one public key or certificate per unbroken line.  Each line in contains a hostname, number of bits, exponent, and modulus.  At the beginning of the line is either the host name or a hash representing the host name.  An optional comment can follow at the end of the line.  These can be preceded by an optional marker to indicate a certificate authority, if a certificate is used instead of a SSH key.  These fields are separated by spaces.  It is possible to use a comma-separated list of the hostname.  

&lt;pre&gt;
# keys with basic hostnames
anoncvs.fr.openbsd.org,93.184.34.123 ssh-rsa AAAA...njvPw==
anoncvs.eu.openbsd.org ssh-rsa AAAAB3Nz...cTqGvaDhgtAhw==
&lt;/pre&gt;

Non-standard ports can be indicated by enclosing the hostname with square brackets and followed by a colon and the port number.  

&lt;pre&gt;
# key with non-standard port
[ssh.example.org]:2222 ssh-rsa AAAAB3Nz...AKy2R2OE=
[127.0.0.2]:4922 ssh-rsa AAAAB4mV...1d6j=
[anga.funkfeuer.at]:2022,[78.41.115.130]:2022 ssh-rsa AAAAB...fgTHaojQ==
&lt;/pre&gt;

Hostname patterns can be created using &quot;'''*'''&quot; and &quot;'''?'''&quot; as wildcards and &quot;'''!'''&quot; to indicate negation. 
#

Up to one optional marker per line is allowed. If present it must be either '''@cert-authority''' or '''@revoked'''.  The former shows that the key is a certificate authority key, the latter flags the key as revoked and not acceptable for use.   

See [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html sshd(8)] for further details of the format of this file and [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh-keygen&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html ssh-keygen(1)] for managing the keys.

==Manually Adding Public Keys to ~/.ssh/known_hosts ==

Manually adding public host keys to known_hosts is a matter of adding one unbroken line per key.  How the key is obtained is not important, as long as it is complete, valid and '''guaranteed to be the real key and not a fake'''.  
[http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh-keyscan&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html ssh-keyscan(1)] can fetch a key and [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh-keygen&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html ssh-keygen(1)] can be used to show the fingerprint for verification.  See examples in the cookbook chapter for methods of verification.  
The corresponding system-wide file is '''/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts'''

===Local User's Public / Private Key Pairs===
Users might have a variety of their own ECDSA, Ed25519, RSA and DSA keys around for various tasks and projects.   The naming convention for keys is only a convention, but recommended to follow anyway.  Public keys usually have the same name as the private key, but with '''.pub''' appended to the name.
  
====Public Keys –  ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub	~/.ssh/id_ecdsa.pub	~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub	~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub====

Public keys are used for authentication.  Public keys are not sensitive and are allowed to be readable by anyone, unlike the private keys, but don't need to be.

====Private Keys –  ~/.ssh/id_dsa	~/.ssh/id_ecdsa	~/.ssh/id_ed25519	~/.ssh/id_rsa====

These private keys are sensitive data and should be readable by the user but not accessible by others, mode 0600.  The directory they are in should also have mode 0700 or 0500.  If a private key file is accessible by others, ssh will ignore it.  

It is possible to specify a passphrase when generating the key which will be used to encrypt the sensitive part of this file using AES128.  Until version 5.3, the cipher 3DES was used to encrypt the passphrase.  Old keys using 3DES that are given new passphrases will use AES128 when they are modified.

====Legacy Protocol Keys ~/.ssh/identity	~/.ssh/identity.pub====
identity and identity.pub are for ssh protocol version 1, and thus deprecated.

==User-specific Public Key Authentication==

Users can authenticate using a private key stored on their system or fetched from a smartcard if the corresponding public key is stored on the system being connected to in '''authorized_keys'''. 
It is not highly sensitive, but the recommended permissions are read/write for the user, and not accessible by others.

The keys can be preceded by a comma-separated list of options.  The whole key must be on a single, unbroken line.  No spaces are permitted, except within double quotes.  Any text after the key is considered a comment.  
See the section above on the '''authorized_keys''' file for more discussion.  The '''authorized_keys''' file is a one-key-per line register of public RSA and DSA keys that can be used to log in as this user.  

User-specified Host-based Authentication Configuration is also possible using the '''~/.shosts''',  '''~/.rhosts''',  '''~/.ssh/environment''', and '''~/.ssh/rc''' files.


==Managing Keys==

When working with keys there are some basic, common sense actions that should take place to prevent problems.  

Keys should use strong pass phrases.  If autonomous logins are required, then  the keys should be first loaded into an agent and used from there.  See [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh-add&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html ssh-add(1)] to get started there.  It uses [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh-agent&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html ssh-agent(1)] which many systems have installed and some have running by default.  

Keys should always be stored in protected locations, even on the client side. This is especially important for private keys.  The private keys should not have read permissions for any user or group other than the owner.  They should also be kept in a directory that is not accessible by anyone other than the owner in order to limit exposure.

Old and unused keys should be removed from the server.  In particular, keys without a known, valid purpose should be removed and not allowed to accumulate.  Using the comment field in the public key for annotation can help eliminate some of the confusion as to the purpose and owner when time has passed.  Along those lines, keys should be rotated at intervals.  In practice, rotation means generating new key pairs and removing the old ones.  This gives a chance to remove old and unused keys. It is also an opportunity to review access needs, whether access is required and if so at what level.  

Following the principle of least privilege can limit the chance for accidents or abuse.  If a key is only needed to run a specific application or script, then its login options should be limited to just what is needed.  See [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html sshd(8)] for the ''Authorized_keys File Format'' section on key login options.  For root level access, it is important to remember to configure '''/etc/sudoers''' appropriately.  Access there can be granted to a specific application and even limit that application to specific options.

== For beginners, Fibonacci not the best choice ==

This is an introduction page.  

If the target audience for this page is a user already familiar with mathematics and programming, a Fibonacci-series example can make sense.  If however, the target reader is new to programming or not that savvy mathematically, Fibonacci is not a good choice.  May I suggest the example code be replaced with something newcomers to Python are more likely to relate to?

Further, while &quot;a,b = 0,1&quot; is a valid Python construct it confuses readers new to Python, especially without explanation.  Python is a very powerful language but it would be better to use more conventional constructs lest the newcomer see Python as too complex and not worth the time to delve deeper.

==sshd==

[http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd sshd(8)] is the secure shell daemon and it listens for incoming connections.  The standard port for [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh ssh(1)] as specified by IANA is 22 &lt;ref name=&quot;IANA_ports&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ietf.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.txt |title=Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry |publisher=IETF |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  .  If [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd sshd(8)] does not listen to a privileged port, it does not have to be launched by root.  However there are few, if any occasions where a non-standard port should be considered.  
[http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd sshd(8)] can be bound to multiple addresses or just certain ones.  Multiple instances of [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd sshd(8)], each with a different configuration, can be run on the same machine, someting which may be useful on multi-homed machines.  
An absolute path must be given to launch [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd sshd(8)], i.e. '''/usr/sbin/sshd'''

Configuration data is parsed first from the arguments and options passed by the shell, the user-specific file, and lastly the system-wide configuration file.
 
:[http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd sshd(8)] - The ssh daemon that permits you to log in.

:[http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sftp-server sftp-server(8)] - SFTP server subsystem, started automatically by sshd when needed.
:[http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh-keysign ssh-keysign(8)] - Helper program for hostbased authentication.

:[http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd_config sshd_config(5)] - The server configuration file.

[http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd sshd(8)] can be made to parse the configuration file, test it for validity and then report the effective configuration settings.  This is done by running the extended test mode ('''-T''').   The extended test will print out the actual server settings.  It can also report modifications to the settings through use of the '''Match''' directive when combined with the connection specification ('''-C''') parameter.  The options for '''-C''' are '''user''', '''host''', and '''addr'''.  This is where '''host''' and '''addr''' refer to the host running [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd sshd(8)] and the address from which the connection is being made, respectively.

The following will print out the configurations that will be applied if the user ''fred'' tries to log in to the host ''server.example.org'' from the address ''192.168.100.5''.
&lt;pre&gt;
/usr/sbin/sshd -TC user=fred,host=server.example.org,addr=192.168.100.5
&lt;/pre&gt;

The output is long, so it might be sensible to pipe it through sort(1) or less(1).  See the section on [[OpenSSH/Logging#Debugging_a_server_configuration| Debugging a Server Configuration]] for more options.

By default, login is allowed for all groups.  However, if '''AllowGroups''' or '''AllowUsers''' is specified, then all users or groups not listed are prohibited from logging in.   The allow/deny directives are processed in the following order: 
# '''DenyUsers''', 
# '''AllowUsers''', 
# '''DenyGroups''', and finally, 
# '''AllowGroups'''.  

The first pattern matched takes effect, so if '''AllowUsers''' exists it will completely override '''AllowGroups''' regardless of the order in which they appear in the configuration file.   So for the most flexibility, it is recommended to use '''AllowGroups'''.   In contrast, '''DenyUsers''' and '''DenyGroups''' do not interfere with each other and may be used together.  List group names or patterns of group names, separated by spaces.  If specified, login is allowed or denied only for users who are members of a group that matches a group or pattern on the list.  Only group or user names are valid; numerical group or user IDs are not recognized.

==sshd under inetd / xinetd==

[http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=inetd&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html inetd(8)], the Internet services daemon, is a server to launch other servers on demand.  [http://linux.die.net/man/8/xinetd xinetd(8)] and [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=inetd&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html inetd(8)] are two variants.  All variants will be referred to as [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=inetd&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html inetd(8)] in this book.  [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=inetd&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html inetd(8)] can be used to specify additional parameters and constraints, including running the launched service as a particular user and group.  By having a single daemon active, which invokes others as needed, demands on the system can be reduced.  Launching [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html sshd(8)] this way means [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=inetd&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html inetd(8)] waits for an incoming request, launches [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html sshd(8)] and then when the SSH session is over, closes [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html sshd(8)].

There are many more possibilities.  See the manual pages for [http://linux.die.net/man/5/xinetd.conf xinetd.conf(5)] or [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=inetd.conf&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html inetd.conf(5)] for a full overview of [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=inetd&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html inetd(8)] configuration options.  

[http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=inetd&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html inetd(8)] is '''tcpd'''-aware and can make use of '''tcpd''''s tcpwrappers to further control access or logging.  So is [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html sshd(8)] by itself.  See the manual pages for [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=hosts_access&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=5&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html hosts_access(5)] for more information about how to use the configuration files '''hosts.allow''' and '''hosts.deny'''.

The two main disadvantages with [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=inetd&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html inetd(8)] are that there can be a slight increase in the delay during the start of the connection and that [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html sshd(8)] must be configured to allow launching from [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=inetd&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html inetd(8)].  The delay only affects the initial connection and thus does not get in the way of actual operation.  [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=inetd&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html inetd(8)] should not be used for stateless services like http, where every action is essentially a new connection.  Again, see the manual page for [http://linux.die.net/man/5/xinetd.conf xinetd.conf(5)] or [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=inetd.conf&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html inetd.conf(5)] for more details.  

Example from xinetd.conf(5)
&lt;pre&gt;

	protocol        = tcp
	wait            = no

}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Example from inetd.conf(5)
&lt;pre&gt;
ssh    stream  tcp     nowait  root /usr/sbin/sshd -i
ssh    stream  tcp6    nowait  root /usr/sbin/sshd -i
&lt;/pre&gt;

One advantage with [http://linux.die.net/man/8/xinetd xinetd(8)] is that it allows the configuration to include other files.

https://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=OpenSSH/Server&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3

==The SFTP Server Subsystem==

The SFTP subsystem first appeared in OpenBSD 2.8 / OpenSSH 2.3&lt;ref name=&quot;OpenSSH_2.3.0p1_Release_Notes&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.openssh.com/txt/release-2.3.0p1 |title=OpenSSH 2.3.0p1 release notes |publisher=OpenSSH.org |month=November |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  It is called by [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html sshd(8)] as needed using the Subsystem option and not intended to operate standalone.  There are two forms of the subsystem.  One is the regular sftp-server.  The other is an in-process SFTP server, which requires no support files when used with ''ChrootDirectory''.  The '''Subsystem''' configuration directive can be used to pass options: 

'''-d''' specifies an alternate starting directory for users, the default is the user's home directory.  (First in 6.2)

&lt;pre&gt;
Subsystem sftp internal-sftp -d /var/www
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''-e''' causes logging information to be sent to ''stderr'' instead of syslog.  

&lt;pre&gt;
Subsystem sftp internal-sftp -e
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''-f''' specifies the syslog facility code that is used when logging messages from sftp-server.  The possible values are: DAEMON, USER, AUTH, LOCAL0, LOCAL1, LOCAL2, LOCAL3, LOCAL4, LOCAL5, LOCAL6, LOCAL7.   

&lt;pre&gt;
# the actual path will vary from distro to distro
Subsystem    sftp    /usr/libexec/sftp-server -f LOCAL0
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''-l''' Specifies which messages will be logged by sftp-server.  The default is AUTH.  The other possible values are: QUIET, FATAL, ERROR, INFO, VERBOSE, DEBUG, DEBUG1, DEBUG2, and DEBUG3.  INFO and VERBOSE log transactions that sftp-server performs on behalf of the client.  DEBUG and DEBUG1 are equivalent while DEBUG2 and DEBUG3 each specify higher levels of debugging output.  Log levels DEBUG through DEBUG3 will violate user privacy and should not be used for regular operation.  The default log level is ERROR.

&lt;pre&gt;
# the actual path will vary from distro to distro
Subsystem    sftp    /usr/libexec/sftp-server -l VERBOSE
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''-p''' and '''-P''' specify whitelisted and blacklisted protocol requests, respectively.  The comma separated lists are permitted or prohibitted accordingly, the blacklist  is applied first if both are used.  '''-Q''' provides a list of protocol features supported by the server.  All three are available as of version 6.5. 

In version 6.5 ''requests'' are the only protocol features queriable.

&lt;pre&gt;
/usr/libexec/sftp-server -Q requests
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''-R''' places the SFTP subsystem in read-only mode.  Attempts to change the filesystem, including opening files for writing, will fail.

'''-u''' overrides the user's default umask and explicity sets the [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=umask&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html umask(2)] to be used for creating files and directories.  
See the manual page for [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=syslog.conf&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=5&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html syslog.conf(5)] for more information about log level or log facility.  
sshd must be able to access '''/dev/log''' for logging to work.  Using the sftp-server subsystem in conjunction with sshd's '''ChrootDirectory''' option therefore requires that syslogd(8) establish a logging node inside the chroot directory.

&lt;pre&gt;
# umask for sftp subsystem OpenSSH 5.4 and later
Subsystem sftp internal-sftp -u 0002
&lt;/pre&gt;

==Environment Variables==

[http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html ssh(1)] and [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html sshd(8)] set some environment variables automatically when logging in.  Other variables can be explicitly defined by users in '''~/.ssh/environment''' if the file exists and the user is allowed to change the environment.  Variables can also be set on a key by key basis in the '''authorized_keys''' file, if the user is allowed to change the environment.

In '''~/.ssh/environment''', the format '''NAME=value''' is used to set the variable.  In '''~/.ssh/authorized_keys''' and '''/etc/ssh/authorized_keys''' the format is '''environment=&quot;NAME=value&quot;'''

For more information, see the '''PermitUserEnvironment''' and '''AcceptEnv''' options in [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd_config&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html sshd_config(5)] and the '''AcceptEnv''' option in [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh_config&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html ssh_config(5)].

The following variables can be set by [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html ssh(1)], depending on the situation.  

'''DISPLAY'''	If X11 is tunnelled, this is set with the '''DISPLAY''' variable indicates the location of the X11 server.  It is automatically set by [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html ssh(1)] to point to a value of the form ''hostname'':''n'', where ''hostname'' indicates the host where the shell runs, and ''n'' is an integer greater than or equal to one.  [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html ssh(1)] uses this special value to forward X11 connections over the secure channel.  The user should normally not set '''DISPLAY''' explicitly, as that will render the X11 connection insecure (and will require the user to manually copy any required authorization cookies).

'''HOME'''	The path of the user's home directory.

'''LOGNAME'''	Synonym for USER; set for compatibility with systems that use this variable.

'''MAIL'''	The path of the user's mailbox.

'''PATH'''	The default PATH, as specified when compiling ssh.

'''SSH_ASKPASS'''	If '''DISPLAY''' and '''SSH_ASKPASS''' are both set, and ssh does not have a terminal associated with it, it will execute the program specified by '''SSH_ASKPASS''' and open an X11 window to read the passphrase when one is needed.  This is particularly useful when calling ssh from a xsession or related script.  On some machines it may be necessary to redirect the input from '''/dev/null''' to make this work.

'''SSH_AUTH_SOCK'''	The path on the client machine to tell ssh the UNIX-domain socket used to communicate with a ssh key agent.

'''SSH_CLIENT'''	Identifies the client end of the connection.  It contains three space-separated values: the client IP address, client port number and the server port number.  

'''SSH_CONNECTION'''	Identifies the client and server ends of the connection.  The variable contains four space-separated values: client IP address, client port number, server IP address, and server port number.

'''SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND'''	If ForceCommand was used, then this variable contains the original command line if a forced command is executed.  It can be used to extract the original arguments.

'''SSH_TTY'''	This is set to the name of the tty (path to the device) associated with the current shell or command.  If the current session has no tty, this variable is not set.

'''TZ'''	This variable is set to indicate the present time zone if it was set when the daemon was started (i.e. the daemon passes the value on to new connections).

'''USER'''	Set to the name of the user logging in.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Leandro Fernández de Moratín (1760-1828) is an important Spanish author of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. One of his most notable works in the late 18th century is &quot;La comedia nueva&quot; (The new comedy, 1792).

==&quot;The new comedy&quot;==

&quot;The new comedy&quot;. Time: 1790s. Place: Madrid, Spain. 

&quot;The new comedy&quot; text at ?

[[File:Ilustración para La comedia nueva o el café (L. F. Moratín).jpg|thumb|Eluterio seeks his friends' approval of his play. Paris edition of &quot;The new comedy&quot;, 1825]]

Eluterio has written his first comedy entitled &quot;The siege of Vienna&quot;, which he reads aloud to Antonio and Pedro, about a woman who dies after starving for six days, but not before pronouncing a very long diatribe against a vizier. Antonio murmurs some mild compliments, but Pedro calls it stupid. Hermogenus, devoted to Eluterio's sister, Mariquita, arrives to settle the question. According to Eluterio, he is the &quot;most eminently capable arbiter of the question that so agitates us&quot;. Hermogenus admits that Eluterio has arrived at the &quot;pinnacle of knowledge&quot;. But before judgment is rendered, Pedro leaves in disgust. Because Hermogenus is threatened by his landlord for failing to pay his rent for 18 months, he and Eluterio are counting on the play's success. Mariquita has doubts about Hermogenus' sincerity either towards the play or herself, which is regrettable, because her own love has no limits. &quot;Has a Pyramus, a Marc Antony, Ptolemies of Egypt or all the Seleucides of Assyria ever nourished a flame like mine that burns up all my being?&quot; she asks. Agustina, sister to Eluterio, also has aspirations as an author. She complains of often being distracted from writing by nursing her children: &quot;For learned women, fecundity is a malediction,&quot; she asserts. Hermogenus waxes eloquent on the subject of poetry, certain that &quot;verses are written thanks to the pineal gland...&quot; But the group is abashed on learning from Eluterio that only three copies of his play were sold. In talking thus, no one has noticed that Hermogenus' watch has stopped and they are late for the opening of the play. Pedro encounters Antonio, not having remained to the end of the play. He reports that he heard among the crowd &quot;a low grumbling sound, harbinger of the storm.&quot;  The group re-enters, defeated. Mariquita reports on the public reaction: &quot;How agitated they were, how they coughed, how they yawned! At last from all sides infernal noise!&quot; The famine scene was interrupted by ironic applause and out the public went. Hermogenus now agrees with public opinion, and is cursed by all for his hypocrisy. Having lost him, Mariquita is anxious for her future: &quot;Sixteen already, and without a husband!&quot; she exclaims. Due to the play's bad reception, Eluterio is worried as well, mainly about his finances, all the more so with having to care for a family of four children, none older than six years old. However, Pedro hires him to free him of his debts.

==ssh-agent==

'''ssh-agent''' is a tool to hold private keys in memory for re-use during a session.  Usually it is started at the beginning of a session and subsequent windows or programs run as clients to the agent.

==ssh-add==

'''ssh-add''' is a tool to load key identities into an agent for re-use.  It can also be used to remove identities from the agent.  The agent holds the private keys used for authentication.

==ssh-keyscan==

'''ssh-keyscan''' has been part of the OpenSSH suite since OpenSSH version 2.5.1 and is used to retrieve public keys.  Keys retrieved using '''ssh-keyscan''', or any other method, must be verified by checking the key fingerprint to ensure the authenticity of the key and reduce the possibility of a man-in-the-middle attack.  The default is to request a ECDSA key using SSH protocol 2.  
David Mazieres wrote the initial version of '''ssh-keyscan''' and Wayne Davison added support for SSH protocol version 2.

==ssh-keygen==
'''ssh-keygen''' is used to generate key pairs for use in authentication, update and manage keys or to verify key fingerprints.  It can generate either ECDSA, Ed25519, RSA or DSA keys and can do the following: 

* generate new key pairs, either ECDSA, Ed25519, RSA or DSA
* remove keys from known hosts
* regenerate a public key from a private key
* change the passphrase of a private key
* change the comment text of a private key
* show the fingerprint of a specific public key
* show ASCII art fingerprint of a specific public key
* load or read a key to or from a smartcard, if the reader is available

If the legacy protocol, SSH1, is used, then '''ssh-keygen''' can only generate RSA keys.  

One important use for key fingerprints is when connecting to a machine for the first time.  A fingerprint is a hash or digest of the public key.  Fingerprints can be sent ahead of time out of band via post, fax, SMS or other means not related to the Internet.  

The verification data for the key should be sent out of band, not done via the Internet.  It can be sent ahead of time by post, fax, SMS or a phone call instead or some other way you can be sure it is an authentic and unchanged key.  

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -l fred centipede.example.org
The authenticity of host 'centipede.example.org (192.168.212.24)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is 7c:c7:8d:23:69:fc:2d:e7:b3:26:7c:03:6f:b3:97:3e.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
&lt;/pre&gt;

If you see that and the key matches what your were given in advance, the connection is probably good.  If you see that and the key is different than what you were given in advance, then stop and disconnect and get on the phone or voip to work out the mistake.  Once the SSH client has accepted the key from the server, it is saved in '''known_hosts'''.  

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -l fred centipede.example.org
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
@    WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!     @
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOMEONE IS DOING SOMETHING NASTY!
Someone could be eavesdropping on you right now (man-in-the-middle attack)!
It is also possible that the RSA host key has just been changed.
The fingerprint for the RSA key sent by the remote host is
37:af:05:99:e7:fb:86:6c:98:ee:14:a6:30:06:bc:f0.

Offending key in /home/fred/.ssh/known_hosts:2
RSA host key for 192.168.212.24 has changed and you have requested strict checking.
Host key verification failed.
&lt;/pre&gt;

If you start to connect to a known host and you get an error like the one above, then either the first connection was to an impostor or the current connection is to an impostor, or something very foolish was done to the machine.  Regardless, disconnect and don't try to log in.  Contact the system administrator out of band to find out what is going on.&lt;ref name=&quot;SecurityFocus2004&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=Brian Hatch |url=http://www.securityfocus.com/infocus/1806
 |title=SSH Host Key Protection |publisher=SecurityFocus |year=2004 |accessdate=2013-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is possible that the server was reinstalled, either the whole OS or just the OpenSSH server, without saving the old keys resulting in new keys being generated.  Either way, check with the system administrator before connecting to be sure.  

It is possible to use more than one key per account or the same key on more than one machine.  Single-use keys allow some remote data transfer tasks to be automated fairly securely.  

The public keys of the hosts you have verified the connections to are stored in '''known_hosts''' whereas the public keys of the users you accept logins from are kept in '''authorized_keys'''.  There are also global files kept on each machine though each account has its own local ones.  

When generating keys use good, solid passphrases.  Good passphrases are 10 to 30 characters in length and are not simple sentences or otherwise easily guessable words or phrases from any language.  It should contain a mixture of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and non-alphanumeric characters.  Passphrases can be changed later, but there is no way to recover a lost passphrase.  If the passphrase is lost or forgotten, the key is useless and must be replaced with a new key pair.  Hashed host names and addresses can be looked up in '''known_hosts''' using '''-F''' or '''-R''' can be used to delete them.

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh-keygen -F sftp.example.org -f ~/.ssh/known_hosts
# Host sftp.example.org found: line 7 type RSA
|1|slYCk3msDPyGQ8l0lq82IbUTzBU=|KN7HPqVnJHOFX5LFmTXS6skjK4o= ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABIwAAAIEA3cqqA6fZtgexZ7+4wxoLN1+YDvPfBtt4/m+N/RI8o95CXqvqZMIQjuVarVKjwRwt9pTJIVzf6bwjcNkrUx9dQqZNpNBkcvBRdmd775opWCAfkHEueKxkNx3Kb1yitz0dUaFkRwfTsXAjh+NleBq2ofAfjowu/zzCnnbAKy2R2OE=
&lt;/pre&gt;

==ssh-vulnkey==

'''ssh-vulnkey''' is included in some distros to check a key against a blacklist of compromised keys.  The blacklist was made necessary when a broken version of OpenSSL was distributed by some distros&lt;ref name=&quot;Debian_OpenSSL_vuln&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=Jake Edge |url=https://lwn.net/Articles/282230/ |title=Debian vulnerability has widespread effects |publisher=LWN |year=2008|accessdate=2013-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;, resulting in bad keys that were easily predicted and compromised.  Keys made while that broken version was in use that are found to have been compromised cannot be repaired and must be replaced.  The problem has since been fixed and new keys should be all right.

==ssh-copy-id==

'''ssh-copy-id''' is included in some distros to install a public key into a remote machine's '''authorized_keys''' file.  It is a simple shell script and the '''authorized_keys''' file should still be checked manually after first login to verify that everything went ok and that the key was copied as it should be.

      <text xml:space="preserve">It is possible to advance OpenSSH through donations of hardware or money.  See the OpenSSH project web site at [http://www.openssh.org www.openssh.org]  for details.  

OpenSSH is a volunteer project with the goal of making quality software.  In that way it relies upon hardware and cash donations to keep the project rolling.  Funds are needed for daily operation to cover network line subscriptions and electrical costs.  Hardware is needed for development and porting to new architectures and platforms always requires new hardware.  

OpenSSH is currently developed by two teams.  The first team works providing code that is as clean, simple and secure as possible as part of the OpenBSD project.  The second team works using this core version and ports it to a great many other operating systems.  Thus there are two development tracks, the OpenBSD core and the portable version.  The work is all done in countries that permit export of cryptography.

__TOC__

==Use the Source, Luke==

The main development branch of OpenSSH is part of the OpenBSD project.  So the &quot;-current&quot; branch of OpenBSD, available as source code, is where to look for current activity.  

The source code for the portable releases of OpenSSH are published using anonymous CVS, so no password is needed to download source from the read-only repository.  It is provided and maintained by Damien Miller.  
Nightly, bleeding-edge snapshots of OpenSSH itself are publicly available from its own CVS tree.  Use a mirror when possible.  

&lt;pre&gt; 
export CVSROOT=anoncvs@anoncvs.mindrot.org:/cvs
export CVS_RSH=/usr/bin/ssh
cvs get openssh
&lt;/pre&gt;

The fingerprints for the keys used by the OpenSSH source code repository, as of this writing, are: 
&lt;pre&gt;
2048 8e:09:e9:fb:dc:af:e4:a5:e6:a0:e2:28:59:63:84:17 ssh_host_rsa_key.pub
1024 3e:38:50:b8:d7:b7:dc:bc:13:c4:d8:76:c8:31:e3:44 ssh_host_dsa_key.pub
&lt;/pre&gt;

We ask anyone wishing to report security bugs in OpenSSH to please use the contact address given in the source and to practice responsible disclosure.

==libssh2==

'''libssh2''' is an independent project providing a lean C library implementing the SSH2 protocol for embedding specific SSH capabilities into other tools.  It has a stable, well-documented API for working on the client side with the different SSH subsystems:  Session, Userauth, Channel, SFTP, and Public Key.  The API can be set to either blocking or non-blocking.  The code uses strict name spaces, is C89-compatible and builds using regular GNU Autotools.  

'''libssh2''' is available under a modified BSD license.  The functions are each documented in their own manual pages.  The project web site contains the documentation, source code and examples:
	http://www.libssh2.org/ 

There is a mailing list for '''libssh2''' in addition to an IRC channel.  The project is small, low-key and, as true to the spirit of the Internet, a meritocracy.  Hundreds of specific functions allow specific activities and components to be cherry-picked and added to an application:
* Shell and SFTP sessions
* Port forwarding
* Password, public-key, host-based keys, and keyboard-interactive authentication methods.
* Key Exchange Methods diffie-hellman-group1-sha1, diffie-hellman-group14-sha1, diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha1
* Host Key Types: ssh-rsa and ssh-dss
* Ciphers: aes256-cbc (rijndael-cbc@lysator.liu.se), aes192-cbc, aes128-cbc, 3des-cbc, blowfish-cbc, cast128-cbc, arcfour, or without a cipher.  
* Compression Scheme zlib or without compression
* Message Authentication Code (MAC) algorithms for hashes: hmac-sha1, hmac-sha1-96, hmac-md5, hmac-md5-96, hmac-ripemd160 (hmac-ripemd160@openssh.com), or none at all
* Channels: Shell, Exec – including the SCP wrapper, direct TCP/IP, subsystem
** Channel Requests: x11, pty
* Subsystems: sftp version 3, public-key version 2
* Thread-safe, blocking or non-blocking API
* Your sockets: the app hands over the socket, calls select() etc.
* Builds with either OpenSSL or gcrypt

See also the library '''libcurl''' which supports SFTP and SCP URLs.  

==Other language bindings for the SSH protocols==

What follows is a list of resources by programming language:

===Perl===

* [http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Net::SSH2 Net::SSH2]: a wrapper module for '''libssh2'''.
* [http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Net::SSH::Perl Net::SSH::Perl]: a full SSH/SFTP implementation in pure Perl. Unfortunately this module is not being maintained any more and has several open bugs. Also, installing it can be a daunting task due to some of its dependencies.
* [http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Net::OpenSSH Net::OpenSSH]: a wrapper for OpenSSH binaries and other handy programs ('''scp''', '''rsync''', '''sshfs'''). It uses OpenSSH multiplexing feature in order to reuse connections. 
* [http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Net::OpenSSH::Parallel Net::OpenSSH::Parallel] a module build on top of '''Net::OpenSSH''' that allows to transfer files and run programs on several machines in parallel efficiently.
* [http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?SSH::Batch SSH::Batch] another module build on top of '''Net::OpenSSH''' that allows to run programs on several hosts in parallel.
* [http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Net::SSH::Expect Net::SSH::Expect]: this module uses [http://search.cpan.org/search?query=expect Expect] to drive interactive shell sessions run on top of SSH.
* [http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Net::SSH Net::SSH]: a simple wrapper around any SSH client. It does not support password authentication and is very slow as it establishes a new SSH connection for every remote program invoked.
* [http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Net::SCP Net::SCP] and [http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Net::SCP::Expect Net::SCP::Expect]: modules wrapping the '''scp''' program. Note that '''Net::SSH2''', '''Net::SSH::Perl''' and '''Net::OpenSSH''' already support file transfers via '''scp''' natively.
* [http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Net::SFTP::Foreign Net::SFTP::Foreign]: a full SFTP client written in Perl with lots of bells and whistles. By default is uses '''ssh''' to connect to the remote machines but it can also run on top of '''Net::SSH2''' and '''Net::OpenSSH'''.
* [http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?GRID::Machine GRID::Machine], [http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?IPC::PerlSSH IPC::PerlSSH] and [http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?SSH::RPC SSH::RPC]: these modules allow to distribute and run Perl code on remote machines through SSH.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Both the OpenSSH client and server offer a lot of choice as to where the logs are written and how much information is collected.   

A prerequisite for logging is having an accurate system clock using the Network Time Protocol, NTP.  Having the NTP server running provides time synchronization with the world.  The more accurate the time stamp in the log is, the faster it is to coordinate forensics between machines or sites or service providers.  If you have to contact outside parties like a service provider, progress can usually only be made with very exact times.  

==Server Logs==

By default [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd sshd(8)] logs to the system logs, with log level INFO and syslog facility AUTH.  So the place to look for log data from [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd sshd(8)] is in '''/var/log/auth.log'''.  These defaults can be overridden using the '''SyslogFacility''' and '''LogLevel''' directives.  Below is a typical server startup entry in the authorization log.  
&lt;pre&gt;
Jan 27 10:01:11 eee sshd[20601]: Server listening on 0.0.0.0 port 22
&lt;/pre&gt;

In most cases the default level of logging is fine, but during initial testing of new services or activities it is sometimes necessary to have more information.  Debugging info usually goes to '''stderr'''.  The log excerpt below show the same basic server start up with increasing detail.  Contrast debug level 3 below with the default above:  
&lt;pre&gt;
debug1: sshd version OpenSSH_5.6
debug1: read PEM private key done: type RSA
debug1: private host key: #0 type 1 RSA
debug1: read PEM private key done: type DSA
debug1: private host key: #1 type 2 DSA
debug1: rexec_argv[0]='/usr/sbin/sshd’
debug1: rexec_argv[1]='-d’
debug1: Bind to port 22 on ::.
Server listening on :: port 22.
debug1: Bind to port 22 on 0.0.0.0.
Server listening on 0.0.0.0 port 22.
And same at the most verbose level, DEBUG3:
debug2: load_server_config: filename /etc/ssh/sshd_config
debug2: load_server_config: done config len = 144
debug2: parse_server_config: config /etc/ssh/sshd_config len 144
debug3: /etc/ssh/sshd_config:98 setting Subsystem sftp  /usr/libexec/sftp-server
debug1: sshd version OpenSSH_5.6
debug3: Not a RSA1 key file /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.
debug1: read PEM private key done: type RSA
debug1: private host key: #0 type 1 RSA
debug3: Not a RSA1 key file /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key.
debug1: read PEM private key done: type DSA
debug1: private host key: #1 type 2 DSA
debug1: rexec_argv[0]='/usr/sbin/sshd’
debug1: rexec_argv[1]='-ddd’
debug2: fd 4 setting O_NONBLOCK
debug1: Bind to port 22 on ::.
Server listening on :: port 22.
debug2: fd 5 setting O_NONBLOCK
debug1: Bind to port 22 on 0.0.0.0.
Server listening on 0.0.0.0 port 22.
&lt;/pre&gt;
Note that failed login attempts are not logged until half the value in directive '''MaxAuthTries''' is exceeded.  Below is how the default log looks after some failed attempts: 
&lt;pre&gt;
...
Nov 23 20:31:12 server sshd[15798]: Connection from 188.124.3.41 port 32889 
Nov 23 20:31:14 server sshd[15798]: Failed password for root from 188.124.3.41 port 32889 ssh2 
Nov 23 20:31:14 server sshd[29323]: Received disconnect from 188.124.3.41: 11: Bye Bye 
Nov 23 22:04:56 server sshd[25438]: Connection from 200.54.84.233 port 45196 
Nov 23 22:04:58 server sshd[25438]: Failed password for root from 200.54.84.233 port 45196 ssh2 
Nov 23 22:04:58 server sshd[30487]: Received disconnect from 200.54.84.233: 11: Bye Bye 
Nov 23 22:04:59 server sshd[21358]: Connection from 200.54.84.233 port 45528 
Nov 23 22:05:01 server sshd[21358]: Failed password for root from 200.54.84.233 port 45528 ssh2 
Nov 23 22:05:01 server sshd[2624]: Received disconnect from 200.54.84.233: 11: Bye Bye
...
&lt;/pre&gt;
It is usually a good idea not to allow root login.  That simplifies log analysis greatly.  It in particular eliminates the time consuming question of who is trying to get in and why.  Tasks that need root level access can be given it through custom-made entries in '''/etc/sudoers'''.  People that need root level access can gain it through '''sudo''' or '''su'''.  

===Successful logins===

By default, the server does not store much information about user transactions.  That is a good thing.  It is also a good thing to recognize when the system is operating as it should.  Here is a successful SSH login:
&lt;pre&gt;
Jan 28 11:47:59 server sshd[18884]: Accepted password for fred from 192.0.2.60 port 6647 ssh2
&lt;/pre&gt;
And one using a key for authentication.
&lt;pre&gt;
Jan 28 11:51:43 server sshd[5104]: Accepted publickey for fred from 192.0.2.60 port 60594 ssh2: RSA e8:31:68:c7:01:2d:25:20:36:8f:50:5d:f9:ee:70:4c
&lt;/pre&gt;
In older versions of OpenSSH, prior to 6.3, the key fingerprint is missing.
&lt;pre&gt;
Jan 28 11:52:05 server sshd[1003]: Accepted publickey for fred from 192.0.2.60 port 20042 ssh2
&lt;/pre&gt;

A password authentication for SFTP

&lt;pre&gt;
Jan 28 11:46:36 server sshd[14002]: Accepted password for fred from 192.0.2.60 port 15440 ssh2
Jan 28 11:46:36 server sshd[25260]: subsystem request for sftp
&lt;/pre&gt;
Here is a successful SFTP login using a key for authentication. 
&lt;pre&gt;
Jan 28 11:43:11 server sshd[5104]: Accepted publickey for fred from 192.0.2.60 port 60594 ssh2: RSA e8:31:68:c7:01:2d:25:20:36:8f:50:5d:f9:ee:70:4c
Jan 28 11:43:11 server sshd[9813]: subsystem request for sftp
&lt;/pre&gt;
Additional data, such as connection duration, can be logged with the help of '''xinetd'''.

===Logging Chrooted SFTP===

Logging the built-in '''sftp-subsystem''' inside a chroot jail needs a '''/dev/log''' node to exist inside the jail.  This can be done by having the system logger such as '''syslogd''' add additional log sockets when starting up.  On some systems that is as simple as adding more flags, like &quot;'''-u -a /chroot/dev/log'''&quot;, in '''/etc/rc.conf.local''' or whatever the equivalent startup script may be.  

Here is a SFTP login with password to a chroot jail, using log level ''Debug3'' for the SFTP-subsystem logging a file upload:
&lt;pre&gt;
Jan 28 12:42:41 server sshd[26299]: Connection from 192.0.2.60 port 47366
Jan 28 12:42:42 server sshd[26299]: Failed none for fred from 192.0.2.60 port 47366 ssh2
Jan 28 12:42:44 server sshd[26299]: Accepted password for fred from 192.0.2.60 port 47366 ssh2
Jan 28 12:42:44 server sshd[26299]: User child is on pid 21613
Jan 28 12:42:44 server sshd[21613]: Changed root directory to &quot;/home/fred&quot;
Jan 28 12:42:44 server sshd[21613]: subsystem request for sftp
Jan 28 12:42:44 server internal-sftp[2084]: session opened for local user fred from [192.0.2.60]
Jan 28 12:42:58 server internal-sftp[2084]: open &quot;/docs/somefile.txt&quot; flags WRITE,CREATE,TRUNCATE mode 0644
Jan 28 12:42:58 server internal-sftp[2084]: close “/docs/somefile.txt” bytes read 0 written 400
&lt;/pre&gt;
Remember that SFTP is a separate subsystem and that like the file creation mode, the log level and facility are set separately from the SSH server in [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd_config sshd_config(5)]:  
&lt;pre&gt;
Subsystem internal-sftp -l ERROR
&lt;/pre&gt;

===Logging Revoked Keys===

If the '''RevokedKeys''' directive is used to point to a list of public keys that have been revoked, [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd sshd(8)] will make a log entry when access is attempted using a revoked key.  The entry will be the same whether a plaintext list of public keys is used or if a binary Key Revocation List (KRL) has been generated.  

If password authentication is allowed, and the user tries it, then after the key authentication fails there will be a record of password authentication.  

&lt;pre&gt;
Apr 30 20:40:44 server sshd[10669]: error: WARNING: authentication attempt with a revoked RSA key 73:b5:83:af:b5:21:ef:b6:0a:ff:93:b4:61:17:24:dd
...
Apr 30 20:40:51 server sshd[10669]: Accepted password for fred from 192.0.2.10 port 51106 ssh2
&lt;/pre&gt;

If password authentication is not allowed, [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd sshd(8)] will close the connection as soon as the key fails.  

&lt;pre&gt;
Apr 30 20:41:51 server sshd[98]: error: WARNING: authentication attempt with a revoked RSA key 73:b5:83:af:b5:21:ef:b6:0a:ff:93:b4:61:17:24:dd
...
Apr 30 20:41:57 server sshd[98]: Connection closed by 192.0.2.10[preauth]
&lt;/pre&gt;

The same happens if the user cancels the connection without trying a password after the key attempt fails.  In both cases, there will be no clue as to which user tried to log on, so it will be necessary to try to look up the key by its fingerprint from your archive of old keys using '''ssh-keygen -lf''' and read the key's comments.

On the client side, no warning or error will be given if a revoked key is tried.  It will just fail and the next key or method will be tried.

===Brute force and Hail Mary attacks===

It’s fairly common to see failed login attempts almost as soon as the server is connected to the net.  Brute force attacks, where one machine hammers on a few accounts trying to find a valid password, are becoming rare.  In part this is because packet filters, like IP Tables for Linux and PF for BSD, can limit the number and rate of connection attempts from a single host.  The server configuration directive '''MaxStartups''' can limit the number of simultaneous, unauthenticated connections.  
&lt;pre&gt;
...
Nov 23 19:35:42 server sshd[14000]: Connection from 116.28.64.132 port 55680 
Nov 23 19:35:44 server sshd[14000]: Failed password for root from 116.28.64.132 port 55680 ssh2 
Nov 23 19:35:44 server sshd[11034]: Received disconnect from 116.28.64.132: 11: Bye Bye 
Nov 23 19:35:45 server sshd[3096]: Connection from 116.28.64.132 port 55932 
Nov 23 19:35:48 server sshd[3096]: Failed password for root from 116.28.64.132 port 55932 ssh2 
Nov 23 19:35:48 server sshd[11289]: Received disconnect from 116.28.64.132: 11: Bye Bye
...
&lt;/pre&gt;

The way to deal with brute force attacks is to customize the server host’s packet filter to limit the attacks or even temporarily block machines that overload the maximum number or rate of connections.  Optionally, one should also contact the attacker’s net block owner with the IP address and exact date and time of the attacks.  

A kind of attack common at the time of this writing is one which is distributed over a large number of compromised machines, each playing only a small role in attacking the server.  

To deal with Hail Mary attacks, contact the attacker’s net block owner.  A form letter with a cut-and-paste excerpt from the log is enough, if it gives the exact times and addresses.  Alternately, teams of network or system administrators can work to pool data to identify and blacklist the compromised hosts participating in the attack.

==Client Logging==

The OpenSSH the client normally sends log information to stderr.  The '''-y''' option can be used to send output to the system logs, managed by syslogd or something similar. Working with the system logs are something which can be useful when running ssh in automated scripts.  Below is a connection to an interactive shell with the normal level of client logging:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -l fred server.example.org    
fred@server.example.org‘s password: 
Last login: Thu Jan 27 13:21:57 2011 from 192.168.11.1
&lt;/pre&gt;

The same connection at the first level of verbosity gives lots of debugging information, 42 lines more.
&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -v -l fred server.example.org

...
&lt;/pre&gt;

The same login with the maximum of verbosity, '''-vvv''', gives around 120 lines of debugging information.  Remember that debugging information is sent to stderr rather than stdout.  Regular pipes and redirects work only with stdout so output on stderr must be sent to stdout first if one is going to capture it at the same time.  That is done with a redirect, '''2&gt;&amp;amp;1'''.  Mind the spaces, or lack of them:

This will only capture the session in a file, debugging info goes only to the screen, not to the output log:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -vvv -l fred  somehost.example.org  | tee ~/ssh-output.log
&lt;/pre&gt;

The tool [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tee tee(1)] is like a T-pipe and sends output two directions, one to stdout and one to a file.

This will capture both debugging info and session text:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -vvv -l fred  somehost.example.org  2&gt;&amp;1  | tee ~/ssh-output.log
&lt;/pre&gt;

Also, the escape sequences '''~v''' and '''~V''' can be used to increase or decrease the verbosity of an existing connection.

==Debugging==

The SFTP-subsystem logging defaults to ERROR, reporting only errors.  To track transactions made by the client, change the log level to INFO or VERBOSE:
&lt;pre&gt;
Subsystem internal-sftp  -l INFO 
&lt;/pre&gt;
Caution.  Operating with elevated logging levels would violate the privacy of users, in addition to filling a lot of disk space, and should generally not be used in production once the changes are figured out.

===Debugging a script, configuration or key===

Usually log levels need only be changed when writing and testing a script, new configurations, new keys, or all three at once.  When working with sudo, it is especially important to see exactly what the client is sending so as to enter the right pattern into '''/etc/sudoers''' for safety.  Using the lowest level of verbosity, the exact string being sent by the client to the remote server is shown in the debugging output:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ rsync -e &quot;ssh -v -i /home/webmaint/.ssh/bkup_key -l webmaint&quot; \
	-a server.example.org:/var/www/ var/backup/www/
...
debug1: Authentication succeeded (publickey).
Authenticated to server.example.org ([192.0.2.20]:22).
debug1: channel 0: new [client-session]
debug1: Requesting no-more-sessions@openssh.com
debug1: Entering interactive session.
debug1: Sending command: rsync --server --sender -vlogDtpre.if . /var/www/
receiving incremental file list
... 
&lt;/pre&gt;
What sudoers then needs is something like the following, assuming account ''webmaint'' is in the group ''webmasters'':
&lt;pre&gt;
%webmasters ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/rsync --server \
--sender -vlogDtpre.if . /var/www/
&lt;/pre&gt;

The same method can be used to debug new server configurations or key logins.  Once things are set to run as needed, the log level settings can be lowered back to INFO for [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd sshd(8)] and to ERROR for '''internal-sftp'''.  Additionally, once the script is left to run in fully automated mode, the client logging information can be set use the syslog system module instead of '''stderr''' by setting the '''-y''' option when it is launched.

===Debugging a server configuration===

Running the server in debug mode provides a lot of information about the connection and a smaller amount about the server configuration.  The server's debugging level ('''-d''') can be raised once, twice ('''-dd''') or thrice ('''-ddd''').  
&lt;pre&gt;
$ /usr/sbin/sshd -d
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note that the server in this case does not detach and become a daemon, so it will terminate when the SSH connection terminates.  To make a subsequent connection from the client, the server must be started again.  Though in some ways this is a hassle, it does make sure that session data is a unique set and not mixes of multiple sessions and thus possibly different configurations.  Alternately, another option ('''-e''') when debugging sends the debugging data to '''stderr''' to keep the system logs clean.  

In recent versions of OpenSSH, it is also possible to log the debug data from the system logs directly to a separate file and keep noise out of the system logs.  Since OpenSSH 6.3, the option '''-E''' will append the debug data to a particular log file instead of sending it to the system log.  This facilitates debugging live systems without cluttering the system logs.  
&lt;pre&gt;
$ /usr/sbin/sshd -E /home/fred/sshd.debug.log
&lt;/pre&gt;

On older versions of OpenSSH, if you need to save output to a file while still viewing it live on the screen, you can use '''tee(1)'''.  
&lt;pre&gt;
$ /usr/sbin/sshd -ddd 2&gt;&amp;1 | tee /tmp/foo
&lt;/pre&gt;

That will save output to the file ''foo'' by capturing what [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd sshd(8)] sent to '''stderr'''.  This works with older versions of OpenSSH, but the '''-E''' option above is preferable.  

If the server is remote and it is important to reduce the risk of getting locked out, the experiments on the configuration file can be done with a second instance of [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd sshd(8)] using a separate configuration file and listening to a high port until the settings have been tested. 
&lt;pre&gt;
$ /usr/sbin/sshd -dd -p 22222 -f /home/fred/sshd_config.test
&lt;/pre&gt;

It is possible to make an extended test ('''-T''') of the configuration file.  If there is a syntax error, it will be reported, but remember that even sound configurations could still lock you out.  The extended test mode can be used by itself, but it is also possible to specify particular connection parameters to use with '''-C'''.  [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd sshd(8)] will then process the configuration file in light of the parameters passed to it and output the results.  Of particular use, the results of '''Match''' directives will be shown.  

When passing specific connection parameters to [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd sshd(8)] for evaluation, ''user'', ''host'', and ''addr'' are the minimum required for extended testing.  The following will print out the configurations that will be applied if the user ''fred'' tries to log in to the host ''server.example.org'' from the address ''192.0.2.15'':
&lt;pre&gt;
$ /usr/sbin/sshd -TC user=fred,host=server.example.org,addr=192.0.2.15
&lt;/pre&gt;

Two more parameters, ''laddr'' and ''lport'', may also be passed.  They refer to the server IP number and port connected to.  
&lt;pre&gt;
$ /usr/sbin/sshd -TC user=fred,host=server.example.org,addr=192.0.2.15,laddr=192.0.2.2,lport=2222
&lt;/pre&gt;

Sometimes when debugging a server configuration it is necessary to track the client, too.  With [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sftp sftp(1)] the options are also passed to [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh ssh(1)]. 

&lt;pre&gt;
$ sftp -v -o &quot;IdentityFile=~/.ssh/weblog.key_rsa fred@server.example.org
&lt;/pre&gt;

The debugging verbosity on the client can be increased just like on the server.  
&lt;pre&gt;
$ sftp -vvv -o &quot;IdentityFile=~/.ssh/weblog.key_rsa fred@server.example.org
&lt;/pre&gt;

The extra information can be useful to see exactly what is being sent to or requested of the server.   

Even when a connection is already established, it is possible to change the verbosity of the client.  Using the escape sequences '''~v''' and '''~V''' it is possible to raise and lower the logging level for the client in an existing connection.  In order, it will raise the log level to VERBOSE, DEBUG, DEBUG2, and DEBUG3, if starting from the default of INFO.  When lowering the log level, it will descend through ERROR, FATAL, to QUIET if starting from the default of INFO.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The [http://www.openssh.org/ OpenSSH] suite provides secure remote access and file transfer.  Since its initial release, it has grown to become the most widely used implementation of the SSH protocol.  During the first ten years of its existence, ssh has largely replaced older corresponding unencrypted tools and protocols.  
The OpenSSH client is included by default in most operating system distributions, including OS X, Linux, BSD and Solaris.  Any day you use the Internet, you are using and relying on dozens if not hundreds of machines operated and maintained using OpenSSH.  A survey in 2008 showed that of the SSH servers found running, just over 80% were OpenSSH.  &lt;ref name=&quot;OpenSSH_marketshare_2008&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.openssh.com/usage/ssh-stats.html
 |title=Statistics from the current scan results |publisher=OpenSSH.org |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OpenSSH was first released towards the end of 1999.  It is the latest step in a very long and useful history of networked commuting, remote access and telecommuting.

==History of OpenSSH==

The first release of OpenSSH was in December 1999 as part of OpenBSD 2.6. The source code was originally derived from a re-write of the last available open version, ssh 1.2.12 specifically, of SSH&lt;ref name=&quot;OpenSSH_History&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://openssh.org/history.html |title=OpenSSH History |publisher=OpenSSH|accessdate=2012-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  SSH went on to become Tectia SSH.   


Ongoing development of OpenSSH is done by the OpenBSD group.  Core development occurs first on OpenBSD, then portability teams bring the changes to other platforms.  OpenSSH is an integral part of as good as all server systems today and a good many network appliances such as routers, switches and networked storage.  
The first steps were in many ways the biggest.  

===The Early Days of Remote Access===

Some of the tools that inspired the need for SSH have been around since the beginning, too, or very near the beginning of the Internet.  Remote access has been a fundamental part of the concept since the idea stage and the nature and capabilities of this access has evolved as the network has evolved in scale, scope and usage.  See the web version of the ''Levnez Unix Timeline''&lt;ref name=&quot;Unix-Timeline&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.levenez.com/unix/ |title=UNIX History Timeline |publisher=Éric Lévénez|accessdate=2011-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Éric Lévénez for an overview of systems development and the web version of ''Hobbes' Internet Timeline''&lt;ref name=&quot;Hobbes-Internet-Timeline&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zakon.org/robert/internet/timeline/ |title=Hobbes' Internet Timeline |publisher=Robert H'obbes' Zakon|accessdate=2011-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Robert H Zakon for an overview of the development of the Internet.

'''1969'''
* Telnet was one of the original ARPAnet application protocols, named in RFC 97.  It was used to access a host at a remote site locally.  Telnet was described starting two years later in RFC 137, RFC 139, RFC 318 and others, including the lost RFC 97.  That is as good a turning point as any to delineate Telnet.  

'''1971'''
* Thompson Shell, by Ken Thompson, was an improvement on the old text-based user interface, the shell.   This new one allowed redirects but was only a user interface and not for scripting.
* In the same year FTP, the file transfer protocol, was described in RFC 114.  A key goal was to promote use of computers over the net by allowing users at any host on the network to use the file system of any cooperating host.

'''1978'''
* Bill Joy created BSD's C shell which is named for the C-like syntax it uses.  It allows job control, history substitution, and aliases, which features we find in today's interfaces.  
* In the same year, the Bourne Shell by Steve Bourne at Bell Labs &lt;ref name=&quot;CW-Bourne-Shell&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.computerworld.com.au/article/279011/a-z_programming_languages_bourne_shell_sh/
 |title=The A-Z of Programming Languages: Bourne shell, or sh | author=Howard Dahdah| publisher=Computerworld |year=2009|accessdate=2011-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; was created.  It is the progenitor to the default shells used in most distros today: '''ksh''' and '''bash'''.  

'''1983'''
* The remote file copy utility, '''rcp''', appeared in 4.2 BSD.  rcp copied files across the net to other hosts using '''rsh''', which also appeared staring 4.2 BSD, to perform its operations.  Like '''telnet''' and '''ftp''', all passwords, user names and data are transmitted unencrypted in clear text.  Both '''rsh''' and '''rcp''' were part of the '''rlogin''' suite.  

'''1991'''
* PGP, written at MIT by Philip Zimmermann&lt;ref name=&quot;WhyIWrotePGP&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mit.edu/~prz/EN/essays/WhyIWrotePGP.html |title=Why I Wrote PGP| author=Phil Zimmermann| publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology |year=1991|accessdate=2011-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;, charted new waters for encrypted electronic communications with the goals of preserving civil liberties online, ensuring individual privacy, keeping encryption legal in the USA, and protecting business communications.  Like SSH it uses asymmetric encryption with public / private key pairs.
  
'''1993'''	
* Kerberos V (RFC 1510) authentication service from MIT's project Athena &lt;ref name=&quot;WikiMarkup&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.mit.edu/Kerberos/dialogue.html |title=Designing an Authentication System: a Dialogue in Four Scenes. |Author=Bill Bryant|Author=Theodor Ts'o|accessdate=2011-02-17|year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;  provides a means for authentication over an open, unsecure network.  Kerberos  got its original start in 1988.

===SSH - open then closed===

'''1995'''
* Tatu Ylönen at the Helsinki University of Technology developed the first SSH protocol and programs, releasing them under an open license&lt;ref name=&quot;SSH-1.0.0-license&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/mirrors/ftp.cs.hut.fi/pub/ssh/old/ssh-1.0.0.tar.gz  |title=Help:SSH 1.0.0 license |publisher=FUNET |
accessdate=2013-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; as per the norm in computer science, software engineering and advanced development.  &lt;ref name=&quot;SSH-Announce&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://groups.google.com/group/comp.security.unix/msg/67079d812a19f499?dmode=source&amp;hl=en&amp;pli=1 |title=ANNOUNCEMENT: Ssh (Secure Shell) Remote Login Program |author=Tatu Ylönen|publisher=news://comp.security.unix|date=1995-07-12|accessdate=2011-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
'''1995?'''
* Björn Grönvall dug out the most recent open version of ssh, version 1.2.12&lt;ref name=&quot;SSH-1.2.12-license&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wwwcip.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/~msfriedl/LIC/ssh-1.2.12/COPYING  |title=Help:SSH 1.2.12 license |publisher=friedl |
accessdate=2011-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;ref name=&quot;SSH-1.2.12.92-license&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wwwcip.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/~msfriedl/LIC/ssh-1.2.12.92/COPYING  |title=Help:SSH 1.2.12.92 license |publisher=friedl |
accessdate=2011-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  He and Holger Trapp did the initial work to free the distribution, resulting in OSSH

'''1996'''
* SSH2 protocol is defined

===OpenSSH===

'''1999'''
* OpenSSH begins based on OSSH.  Niels Provos, Theo de Raadt, Markus Friedl developed the cryptographic components during the port to OpenBSD which became the OpenSSH we know today.  Dug Song, Aaron Campbell and many others provided various non-crypto contributions.   openssl library issues were sorted by Bob Beck.  Damien Miller, Philip Hands, and others started porting OpenSSH to Linux 

'''2000'''
* Markus Friedl added SSH 2 protocol support to OpenSSH version 2.0, which was released in June.&lt;ref name=&quot;SSH-History&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.openssh.com/history.html
  |title=OpenSSH Project History and Credits |publisher=OpenSSH |
accessdate=2011-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  OpenSSH 2.0 shipped with OpenBSD 2.7.   Niels Provos and Theo de Raadt did most of the checking.  Bob Beck updated OpenSSL.  Markus also added support for the SFTP protocol later that same year.  
* In September of 2000, the long wait in the USA was over for the patents on the RSA algorithms to expire.  In the European Union, the European Patent Convention of 1972, frees software, algorithms, business methods or literature, unlike the unfortunate, anti-business situation in the USA.  This freedom in Europe hangs by a thread at the moment.  
* SSH Tectia changes licenses again.  

'''2001'''
* Damien Miller completed the SFTP client which was released in February.  
* SSH2 became the default protocol

'''2008'''
* Built-in chroot support for '''sshd'''.

'''2010'''
* As of OpenSSH 5.4, the legacy protocol SSH1 is finally disabled by default.
Note: OpenSSH can be used anywhere in the whole world because it uses only algorithms unencumbereed by software patents, business method patents, algorithm patents, and so on.  These types of patents do not apply in Europe, only physical inventions can be patented in Europe, but there are regions of the world where these problems do occur.  Small and medium businesses in Europe have been active in politics to keep the advantage.

==Why Use OpenSSH?==

A lot has changed since the commercialization of the Internet began in 1996.  It was once a University and Government research network and if you were on the net back then, odds were you were supposed to be there.  Though it was far from being utopia, any misbehavior could usually be quickly narrowed down to the individuals involved and dealt with easily, usually with no more than a phone call or a few e-mails.  Few, if any, sessions back then were encrypted and both passwords and user names were passed in clear text. 
 
By then, the WWW was more than a few years under way and undergoing explosive growth.  The estimated number of web servers online in 1996 grew from 100,000 at the beginning of the year to close to 650,000 by the end of the same year&lt;ref name=&quot;Hobbes' Internet Timeline&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zakon.org/robert/internet/timeline/ |title=Hobbes' Internet Timeline | Author=Robert H'obbes' Zakon| publisher=Zakon Group LLC|Accessdate=2011-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  When other types of servers are included in those figures, the estimated year-end number is over 16,000,000 hosts, representing approximately 828,000 domains.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hobbes' Internet Timeline&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowadays, hosts are subject to hostile scans from the moment they are connected to the network.  Any and all unencrypted traffic is scanned and parsed for user names, passwords and other sensitive information.  Currently, the biggest espionage threats come from private companies, but governments, individuals, and organized crime are not without a presences.  

Each connection goes through many networks and each packet may take the same or a different route there and back again.  Thirteen hops among three organizations in this example from a student computer to a search engine:

&lt;pre&gt;
% /usr/sbin/traceroute -n www.google.com
traceroute: Warning: www.google.com has multiple addresses; using 74.125.95.106
traceroute to www.l.google.com (74.125.95.106), 30 hops max, 40 byte packets

11 209.85.241.27        17.736 ms	17.592 ms	17.519 ms	Google, Inc.
12 72.14.239.193        17.767 ms	17.778 ms	17.930 ms	Google, Inc.
13 74.125.95.106        17.903 ms	17.835 ms	17.867 ms	Google, Inc.:
&lt;/pre&gt;


The net is big.  It is not uncommon to find a trail of 15 to 20 hops between client and server nowadays.  Any machine on any of the subnets the packets travel over can eavesdrop with little difficulty if the packets are not well encrypted.  

===What OpenSSH Does===

The OpenSSH suite gives the following:

* Encrypted remote access, including tunneling insecure protocols.
* Encrypted file transfer
* Run remote commands, programs or scripts and, as mentioned, 
* Replacement for '''rsh''', '''rlogin''', '''telnet''' and '''ftp'''

More concretely, that means that the following undesirable activities are prevented:
* Eavesdropping of data transmitted over the network.
* Manipulation of data at intermediate elements in the network (e.g. routers).
* Address spoofing where an attack hosts pretends to be a trusted host by sending packets with the source address of the trusted host.
* IP source routing 

As a free software project, OpenSSH provides:
* Open Standards
* Flexible License - freedom emphasized for developers
* Strong Encryption using these ciphers:
** 3DES
** AES
** Arcfour
** Blowfish
** ChaCha20-Poly1305&lt;ref name=&quot;ChaCha20&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.djm.net.au/2013/11/chacha20-and-poly1305-in-openssh.html |title= ChaCha20 and Poly1305 in OpenSSH  |author=Damien Miller|date=2013-11-29 |accessdate=2014-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Strong Authentication
** Public Key
** Single Use Passwords
** Kerberos
** Dongles
* Built-in SFTP
* Data Compression
* Port Forwarding
** Encrypt legacy protocols
** Encrypted X11 forwarding for X Window System
* Key Agents
* Single Sign-on using 
** Authentication Keys
** Agent Forwarding
** Ticket Passing
** Kerberos
** AFS

===What OpenSSH Doesn't Do===

OpenSSH is a very useful tool, but much of its effectiveness depends on correct use.  It cannot protect from any of the following situations.

* Misconfiguration, misuse or abuse.
* Compromised systems, particularly where the root account is compromised. 
* Insecure or inappropriate directory settings, particularly home directory settings.

OpenSSH must be properly configured and on a properly configured system in order to be of benefit.  Arranging both is not difficult, but since each system is unique, there is no one-size-fits-all solution.  The right configuration is dependent on the uses the system and OpenSSH are put to.

If you login from a host to a server and an attacker has control of root on either side, he can listen to your session by reading from the pseudo-terminal device, even though SSH is encrypted on the network SSH must communicate in clear text with the terminal device.  

If an attacker can change files in your home directory, for example via a networked file system, he may be able to fool SSH.  

Last but not least, if OpenSSH is set to allow everyone in, whether on purpose or by accident, it will.

      <text xml:space="preserve">One of the main functions of OpenSSH is that of accessing and running programs on other systems.  In addition to an interactive login, ssh can be used to simply execute a program or script.  Logout is automatic when the program or script has run its course.  Some combinations are readily obvious.  Others require more careful planning.  Sometimes it is enough of a clue just to know that something can be done, at other times more detail is required.  A number of examples of useful combinations of using OpenSSH to run remote tasks follow.  

__TOC__

==Run a Remote Process==

An obvious use of [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh ssh(1)] is to use the shell interactively.  That is, after all, one of the main purposes of the program.  There are several ways to expand upon that, either interactively or as part of unattended scripts.  [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh ssh(1)] returns whatever exit value was returned by the remote process.  When a remote process is completed, [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh ssh(1)] will terminate and pass on the exit value of the last remote process to complete.  So in this way, it can be used in scripts and the outcome of the remote processes can be used.

The following will return success, 0, on the local system where [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh ssh(1)] was run.
&lt;pre&gt;
ssh -l fred server.example.org /bin/true
echo $?
&lt;/pre&gt;

The following will return failure, 1, on the local system where [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh ssh(1)] was run.

&lt;pre&gt;
ssh -l fred server.example.org /bin/false
echo $?
&lt;/pre&gt;

If any other values, from 0 to 255, were returned, [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh ssh(1)] will pass them on.  

===Run a remote process and capture output locally===

Output from programs run on the remote machine can be saved locally using a normal redirect.  Here we run [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=dmesg dmesg(8)] on the remote machine:
&lt;pre&gt;
ssh -l fred server.example.org dmesg &gt; /tmp/dmesg.from.server.log
&lt;/pre&gt;
Interactive processes will be difficult or impossible to operate in that manner because no output will be seen.  For interactive processes requiring any user input, output can be piped through tee  instead  to send the output both to the file and to stdout.  This example runs a FTP session remotely and logs the output locally.

&lt;pre&gt;
ssh -l fred server.example.org &quot;ftp -a anotherserver&quot; | tee /tmp/ftp.log
&lt;/pre&gt;

It may be necessary to force pseudo-tty allocation to get both input and output to be properly visible.  
&lt;pre&gt;
ssh -t -l fred server.example.org &quot;ftp -a anotherserver&quot; | tee /tmp/ftp.log
&lt;/pre&gt;

===Run a remote process in the background while disconnected===

Many routine tasks can be set in motion and then left to complete on their own without needing to stay logged in.  When running remote process in background it is useful to spawn a shell just for that task.
&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -t -l fred server.example.org 'sh -c &quot;tar zcf /backup/usr.tgz /usr/&quot; &amp;' 
&lt;/pre&gt;
Another way is to use a terminal multiplexer, like [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tmux tmux(1)] or [http://linux.die.net/man/1/screen screen(1)], to be able to reconnect and follow the process from time to time.  
&lt;pre&gt;
# start session and go about business
$ ssh -l fred server.example.org screen
&lt;/pre&gt;
Once a [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tmux tmux(1)] or [http://linux.die.net/man/1/screen screen(1)] session is running, it is possible to detach it and close the ssh connection without disturbing the background processes it may be running.  
&lt;pre&gt;
# start session and pick up (reattach) session in progress
$ ssh -l fred server.example.org &quot;screen -x&quot;  ???
&lt;/pre&gt;
More on using terminal multiplexers [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tmux tmux(1)] or [http://linux.die.net/man/1/screen screen(1)] below.  In some environments it might be necessary to also use [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=pagsh pagsh(1)], especially with kerberos, see below.  Or [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=nohup nohup(1)] might be of use.

==Reconnect and restore a session==

Sessions can be restored after either an intentional or accidental break using a terminal multiplexer like [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tmux tmux(1)] or [http://linux.die.net/man/1/screen screen(1)].  Here [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh ssh(1)] is to assume that the connection is broken after 5 seconds of not being able to reach the server and to exit.  
&lt;pre&gt;
# using screen
while ! ssh -t fred@example.org -o 'ServerAliveInterval 5' screen -d -RR;  
do true;
done
&lt;/pre&gt;
Each time [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh ssh(1)] exits, the shell tries to run it again and to look for a screen session to attach to.  If the tcp connection is broken, none of the applications or sessions running inside the terminal multiplexer stop.  
&lt;pre&gt;
# using tmux
while ! ssh -t fred@example.org -o 'ServerAliveInterval 5' 'tmux attach -d || tmux new-session';  
do true;
done
&lt;/pre&gt;
The above examples give only an overly simplistic demonstration where at their most basic they are useful to resume a shell where it was after the tcp connection was broken.  Both [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tmux tmux(1)] or [http://linux.die.net/man/1/screen screen(1)] are quite capable of much more and worth exploring for travelers and telecommuters. 

===Keeping authentication tickets for a remote process after disconnecting===

Authentication credentials are often deleted upon logout and thus any remaining processes no longer have access to whatever the authentication tokens were used for.  In such cases, it is necessary to first create a new credential cache sandbox to run an independent process in before disconnecting.  Using [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=pagsh pagsh(1)] is one solution for some environments.  
&lt;pre&gt;
$ pagsh
$ /usr/local/bin/a-slow-script.sh
&lt;/pre&gt;
Kerberos and AFS are two examples of services that require valid, active tickets.

==Sharing a remote shell==

Teaching, team programming, supervision and creating documentation are some examples of when it can be useful for two people to be sharing a shell.  There are several options for read-only viewing as well as for multiple parties being able to read and write.
  
===Read-only Monitoring or Logging===

Pipes and redirects are a quick way to save output from an ssh session or to allow additional users to follow along read-only.  

Sample use-case: Router needs to be reconfigured and is only available via serial console.  Say your router is down and a consultant must log in via your laptop's 3G modem to access the router's serial console and you need to see what is done or help at certain stages.  It is also very useful in documenting various activities, including configuration or installation.  

It is also possible for advanced users of [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tmux tmux(1)] or [http://linux.die.net/man/1/screen screen(1)] or [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tmux tmux(1)] to allow read-only observers.  

====Read-only using tee(1)====

Capture shell activity to a log file and optionally use tail to watch it real time.  The utility [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tee tee(1)], like a t-joint in plumbing, is used here to send output two directions.  Output is sent with a pipe ( | ) to [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tee tee(1)] which then sends the output both to '''stdout''' and to a file.  
&lt;pre&gt;
ssh fred@server.example.org | tee /tmp/session.log
&lt;/pre&gt;
The resulting file can be monitored live in another terminal using [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tail tail(1)] or after the fact with a pager like [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=less less(1)].

====Force Serial Session with Logging using tee(1)====
[http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tee tee(1)] can capture output from any program that can write to stdout.  It is very useful for walking someone at a remote site through a process or supervising. 

This example uses [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=chroot chroot(8)] to keep the choice of actions as simple as possible.  The guest user is a member of the group cconsult. The serial connection for my test is on device ttyUSB0, which is a USB to serial converter and [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=cu cu(1)] is used for the connection.  [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tee tee(1)] takes the output from [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=cu cu(1)] and saves a copy to a file for logging while the program is used.  
&lt;pre&gt;
# from sshd_config
Match Group cconsult
   ChrootDirectory /var/chroot-test
   AllowTCPForwarding no
   X11Forwarding no
   ForceCommand cu -s 19200 -l /dev/ttyUSB0 | tee /var/tmp/cu.log
&lt;/pre&gt;

Then one or more people can follow the activity in [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=cu cu(1)] as it happens, use tail.
&lt;pre&gt;
# using the same logfile name as set in sshd_config
tail -f /var/tmp/cu.log.
&lt;/pre&gt;

Or the log can be edited and used for documentation.  

Read-only using [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tmux tmux(1)] or [http://linux.die.net/man/1/screen screen(1)] or [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tmux tmux(1)] is done by wrapping the (re-)connection attempt in a script.

&lt;pre&gt;
#!/bin/sh

# try attaching to an existing screen session or,
# or if none exist, make a new screen session

/usr/bin/screen -x || \
  /usr/bin/screen \
     sh -c &quot;/usr/bin/cu -s 19200 -l /dev/ttyUSB0 | \
     /usr/bin/tee /tmp/consultant.log&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

===Interactive Sharing Using a Terminal Multiplexer===

The terminal multiplexers [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tmux tmux(1)] or [http://linux.die.net/man/1/screen screen(1)] or [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tmux tmux(1)] can attach two or more users to the same session.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sharing Terminal Sessions With Tmux And Screen&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.howtoforge.com/sharing-terminal-sessions-with-tmux-and-screen
 |title=Sharing Terminal Sessions With Tmux And Screen |publisher=HowToForge |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The session can either be read-only for some or read-write for all participants.

====screen(1)====

If the same account is going to share a session, then it's an easy procedure.  In the one terminal, where ''sessionname'' is the name of your screen session, start a new session:

&lt;pre&gt;
screen -S sessionname
&lt;/pre&gt;

In the other terminal, attach to that session:

&lt;pre&gt;
screen -x sessionname
&lt;/pre&gt;

If two different accounts are going to share the same session, then the following steps are necessary.  ''user 1'' does this:

&lt;pre&gt;
screen -S sessionname
^A :multiuser on
^A :acladd user2
&lt;/pre&gt;

Then ''user 2'' does this:
&lt;pre&gt;
screen -x user1/sessionname
&lt;/pre&gt;


In [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tmux tmux(1)] or [http://linux.die.net/man/1/screen screen(1)], if more than one user account is used the '''aclchg''' command can remove write access for the other user: '''^A :aclchg user -w &quot;#&quot;'''.  Note that [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tmux tmux(1)] or [http://linux.die.net/man/1/screen screen(1)] must run as SUID for multiuser support.  If it is not set, you will get an error message reminding you when trying to connect the second user.  You might also have to set permissions for '''/var/run/screen''' to 755.

====tmux(1)====

If the same account is going to be sharing the session, then it's
rather easy.  In the first terminal, start [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tmux tmux(1)] where 'sessionname' is the
session name:

&lt;pre&gt;
tmux new-session -s sessionname
&lt;/pre&gt;

Then in the second terminal:

&lt;pre&gt;
tmux attach-session -t sessionname
&lt;/pre&gt;


For different users, you have to set the permissions on the [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tmux tmux(1)] socket so that both users can read and write it.  That will require a group which has both users as members.  

In the first terminal, start [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tmux tmux(1)] where 'sessionname' is the session name and 'shareds' is the name of the socket:

&lt;pre&gt;
tmux -S /tmp/shareddir/shareds new-session -s sessionname
&lt;/pre&gt;

Then [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=chgrp chgrp(1)] the socket (/tmp/shareddir/shareds) and the socket's directory to a group that both users share in common.

In the second terminal attach using that socket and session

&lt;pre&gt;
tmux -S /tmp/shareddir/shareds attach-session -t sessionname
&lt;/pre&gt;

====scripting====

It is possible to automate some of the connection.  Make a script, such as '''/usr/local/bin/screeners''', then use that script with the '''ForceCommand''' directive.  Here is an example of a script that tries to reconnect to an existing session.  If no sessions already exist, then a new one is created and automatically establishes a connection to a serial device.  

&lt;pre&gt;
#!/bin/sh

# try attaching to an existing screen session,
# or if none exist, make a new screen session

/usr/bin/screen -x || \
  /usr/bin/screen \
     /bin/sh -c &quot;/usr/bin/cu -s 19200 -l /dev/ttyUSB0 | \
     /usr/bin/tee /tmp/consultant.log&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

==Run a local process and capture remote data==

Data can be produced on one system and used on another.  This is different than tunnelling X, where both the program and the data reside on the other machine and only the graphical interface is displayed locally.  The simplest way to read data on one machine and use it on another is to use I/O redirection.  

&lt;pre&gt;
ssh fred@server.example.org 'cat /etc/ntpd.conf' | diff /etc/ntpd.conf - 
&lt;/pre&gt;

Or

&lt;pre&gt;
cat /etc/ntpd.conf | ssh fred@server.example.org 'diff /etc/ntpd.conf - 
&lt;/pre&gt;

In the case where the local program expects to read a file from the remote machine, a named pipe can be used in conjunction with a redirect to transfer the data.  In the following example, a named pipe is created as a transfer point for the data.  Then [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh ssh(1)] is used to launch a remote process which sends output to '''stdout''' which is captured by a redirect on the local machine and sent to the named pipe.  Any [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sudo sudo(8)] privileges for [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tcpdump tcpdump(8)] also need to operate without an interactive password, so great care and precision must be exercised to spell out in '''/etc/sudoers''' exactly which program and parameters are to be permitted and nothing more. The authentication for [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh ssh(1)] must also occur non-interactively, such as with a key and key agent.  Once the configurations are set, [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh ssh(1)] is run and sent to the background after connecting.   With [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh ssh(1)] in the background the local application is launched, in this case [http://linux.die.net/man/1/wireshark wireshark(1)], a graphical network analyser, which is set to read the named pipe as input.  

&lt;pre&gt;
mkfifo -m 600 netdata

ssh -fq -i /home/fred/.ssh/key_rsa \
    'sudo tcpdump -lqi eth0 -w - &quot;not port 22&quot;' &gt; netdata

wireshark -k -i netdata &amp;
&lt;/pre&gt;

In this particular example, it is important to add a filter rule to [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tcpdump tcpdump(8)] itself to prevent an infinite feedback loop if [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh ssh(1)] is connecting over the same interface as the data being collected.  This loop is prevented by excluding either the SSH port, the host used by the SSH connection, or the corresponding network interface.

On some systems, process substitution can be used to simplify the transfer of data between the two machines.  Doing process substitution requires only a single line.  

&lt;pre&gt;
wireshark -k -i &lt;( ssh -fq -i /home/fred/.ssh/key_rsa \
                  'sudo tcpdump -lqi eth0 -w - &quot;not port 22&quot;' )
&lt;/pre&gt;

However, process substitution is not POSIX compliant and thus not portable across platforms.  It is limited to [http://linux.die.net/man/1/bash bash(1)] only and not present in other shells.  For portability, use a named pipe.  

==X11 Forwarding==
It is possible to  run graphical programs on the remote machine and have them display locally by forwarding '''X11''', the current implementation of the X Window system. It is used to provide the graphical interface on many systems.  See the website [http://www.x.org/ www.X.org] for its history and technical details.  '''X11''' is built into most desktop operating systems.  It is even distributed as part of Macintosh OS X, though there it is not the default method of graphical display.  

'''X11''' forwarding OpenSSH is off by default and must be enabled on both the ssh client and the server if it is to be used.  

'''X11''' uses a client server architecture with the X server being the part that does the display for the end user and the various programs acting as the clients connecting to the server.  By putting the client and server on different machines and forwarding the '''X11''' connections, it is possible to run programs on other computers but have them displayed and available as if they were on the user's computer.  

A note of caution is warranted.  Allowing the remote machine to forward '''X11''' connections will allow it and its applications to access many devices and resources on the machine hosting the X server.  Regardless of the intent of the users, these are the devices and other resources accessible to the user account.  So forwarding should only be done when the other machine, that user account account and its applications are reliable.  

On the server side, to enable '''X11''' forwarding by default, put the line below in [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd_config sshd_config(5)]:
&lt;pre&gt;
X11Forwarding yes
&lt;/pre&gt;
On the client side, forwarding of '''X11''' is also off by default, but can be enabled using three different ways.  It can be enabled using '''-X''' or '''-Y''' as a run-time argument or in [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh_config ssh_config(5)].  
&lt;pre&gt;
ssh -l fred -X desk.example.org 
&lt;/pre&gt;

===Using ''ssh_config'' to specify X11 forwarding===
Or '''X11''' forwarding can be enabled in '''/etc/ssh_config''' for all accounts.  In '''~/.ssh/config''' and '''/etc/ssh/ssh_config''' it can be enabled for all hosts or for specific ones.   
&lt;pre&gt;
#  Enable for all hosts.  Maybe this is not a good idea.
X11Forwarding yes
&lt;/pre&gt;
It is possible to use ssh_config or '''~/.ssh/config''' to limit forwarding by default to an individual host by hostname or ip number.

&lt;pre&gt;
# enable for one machine by name
Host desk.example.org 
	X11Forwarding yes

# enable for one machine by ip number
Host 192.168.111.25 
	X11Forwarding yes
&lt;/pre&gt;

Or likewise use limited pattern matching to allow forwarding for a subdomain or a range of ip addresses:

&lt;pre&gt;
# Any host in the subdomain
Host *.pool.example.org 
	X11Forwarding yes

# Any host in the range 192.168.100.100 - 192.168.100.109
Host 192.168.100.10?
	X11Forwarding yes

# Any host in the range 192.168.123.1 - 192.168.123.255
Host 192.168.123.*
	X11Forwarding yes
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''X11''' is built-in to most desktop systems with optional add-on for OS X which has its roots in NextStep.  
'''X11''' support may be missing from some particularly outdated, legacy platforms.  But even there it is often possible to retrofit them, one example being the tool [http://www.straightrunning.com/XmingNotes/ Xming].

'''Status: This book is still under construction.'''

This book is an introduction to the art of software engineering.  It is intended as a textbook for an undergraduate level course.

Software engineering is about teams and it is about quality.  The problems to solve are so complex or large, that a single developer cannot solve them anymore.  Software engineering is also about communication.  Teams do not consist only of developers, but also of testers, architects, system engineers, customer, project managers, etc.  Software projects can be so large that we have to do careful planning.  Implementation is no longer just writing code, but it is also following guidelines, writing documentation and also writing unit tests.  But unit tests alone are not enough.  The different pieces have to fit together.  And we have to be able to spot problematic areas using metrics.  They tell us if our code follows certain standards.  Once we are finished coding, that does not mean that we are finished with the project: for large projects maintaining software can keep many people busy for a long time.  Since there are so many factors influencing the success or failure of a project, we also need to learn a little about project management and its pitfalls, but especially what makes projects successful.  And last but not least, a good software engineer, like any engineer, needs tools, and you need to know about them.

So we invite you to join us on the journey through the mazes of software engineering!

      <text xml:space="preserve">Host-based authentication allows hosts to authenticate on behalf of all or some of the system's users.  It can apply to all users on a system or a subset using the '''Match''' directive.   This type of authentication can be useful for managing computing clusters and other fairly homogenous pools of machines.  

In all, three files on the server and one on the client must be modified to prepare for host-based authentication.  


==Server Configuration for host-based authentication==

Three files on the server or target host must be modified to get host-based authentication working:
: /etc/ssh/shosts.equiv	- same syntax as old '''rhosts.equiv''', can point to '''netgroups'''
: /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts - hold the identities of the clients
: /etc/ssh/sshd_config	- turn on host-based authentication

===/etc/ssh/shosts.equiv===

The '''/etc/ssh/shosts.equiv''' identifies which addresses are allowed to try authenticating.  The file can contain hostnames, IP addresses, or netgroups.  
Best to keep this file simple and oriented to just the list of hosts, either by name or IP number.  It provides only the first cut, anyway.  For fine tuning, use [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd_config sshd_config(5)] to set or revoke access for specific users and groups.  &lt;pre&gt;
client1.example.org
192.0.2.102
client8.example.org -bull
@statcluster
&lt;/pre&gt;

Two more files may optionally be modified, if they are referred to from within '''shosts.equiv'''.  Each line in the '''netgroup''' file consists of a net group name followed by a list of the members of the net group, specifically host, user, and domain.
&lt;pre&gt;
 /etc/netgroup	default netgroup list
 /etc/netgroup.db	netgroup database, build from netgroup
&lt;/pre&gt;

However, these are mostly legacy from the old '''rhosts''' and can be avoided.

===/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts===

Those hosts listed in the server's '''shosts.equiv''' must also have their public keys in '''/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts''' on the server to be acknowledged.  There are three required data fields per line.  First is the host name or IP address or comma separated list of them, corresponding to those from '''shosts.equiv'''.  Next is the key type, either ssh-rsa for RSA keys or ssh-dss for DSA keys.  Third is the public key itself.  Last, and optionally, can be a comment about the key.  
&lt;pre&gt;
desktop,192.0.2.102 ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABIw ... qqU24CcgzmM=
&lt;/pre&gt;

There are many ways of collecting the public key information.  It can be copied using [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sftp sftp(1)], copied from '''~/.ssh/known_hosts''' or it can be grabbed using [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh-keyscan ssh-keyscan(1)].  Though the latter two only work if the client host also has an SSH server running.  
&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh-keyscan -t rsa client.example.org &gt;&gt; /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts
&lt;/pre&gt;

If it is not possible for there to be a valid DNS entry resolving the hostname and address of the client, then it might be necessary to use a work-around to make up for that lack.  One choice is to use or set up a local name service using '''dnsmasq''' or some other easy option.  Or another choice is to set [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd sshd(8)] to accept the hostname information provided in the connection itself as being what it claims to be.  See the '''HostbasedUsesNameFromPacketOnly''' directive for '''sshd_config''' below.

===/etc/ssh/sshd_config===

The third file that must be changed on the server is '''sshd_config'''.  It must be told to allow host-based authentication.  That is done using the '''HostbasedAuthentication''' directive, either for all users or just some users or groups.  
&lt;pre&gt;
   HostbasedAuthentication yes
&lt;/pre&gt;

Host-based authentication can be limited to specific users or groups.  Here is an example excerpt from '''sshd_config''' allowing allow any user in the group ''turtles'' to let the hosts authenticate on their behalf:  

&lt;pre&gt;
Match Group turtles
   HostbasedAuthentication yes
&lt;/pre&gt;

If the client machine is not listed in DNS, then the server might have trouble recognising it.  In that case you might have to tell [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd sshd(8)] not to do reverse lookups in DNS for connecting hosts.  Excerpt from '''/etc/ssh/sshd_config''' to work around lack of DNS records for the client using the '''HostbasedUsesNameFromPacketOnly''' directive.  
&lt;pre&gt;
   HostbasedAuthentication yes
   HostbasedUsesNameFromPacketOnly yes
&lt;/pre&gt;
  
Sometimes the host connecting gets identified to the target host as something other than what was expected.  So make sure that the configuration files match what the host is actually calling itself.  

====Local user host-based authentication====

The list of allowed hosts can be either local for the user or global.  Individual users can have a local '''.shosts''' containing a list of trusted remote machines, or user-machine pairs, which are allowed to try host-based authentication. 

'''.shosts''' must not writable by any group or any other users.  Permissions set to 0644 should do it.  The usage and format of '''.shosts''' is exactly the same as .rhosts, but allows host-based authentication without permitting login by insecure, legacy tools '''rlogin''' and '''rsh'''.  The list is one line per host.  The first column is obligatory and contains the name or address of the host permitted to attempt host-based authentication.  

The second column is optional contains either a user name or netgroup name.  But the user name checks using this method are not secure and restricting which specific users or groups may authenticate should be configured in '''sshd_config''' instead by using the '''Match Group''' directive.  

See the manual page [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=hosts.equiv&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html hosts.equiv(5)] for more details on '''.shosts.'''

==Client Configuration for Host-based Authentication==

On the client or source host, a single file must be configured:
: /etc/ssh/ssh_config	- allow clients to request host-based authentication

There two changes are needed.  The OpenSSH client's configuration must request host-based authentication when connecting, either for all hosts or for specific ones.  Also, the global OpenSSH client configuration file must be set to enable [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh-keysign ssh-keysign(8)].  It is a helper application to access the local host keys and generate the digital signature required for host-based authentication.  The '''EnableSSHKeysign''' configuration must be done globally in '''/etc/ssh/ssh_config'''.  The program [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh-keysign ssh-keysign(8)] itself must be SUID root, but that was probably set when it was installed and no changes there are needed.  

Here is an excerpt from '''/etc/ssh/ssh_config''' on the client trying host-based authentication to all machines:
&lt;pre&gt;
Host * 
	HostbasedAuthentication yes
	EnableSSHKeysign yes
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note that the '''Host''' directive in [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh_config&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html ssh_config(5)] can be used to further constrain access, and other configuration specifics, to a particular server or group of servers.
&lt;pre&gt;
Host *.pool.example.org
	HostbasedAuthentication yes
	EnableSSHKeysign yes
&lt;/pre&gt;

If the home directory of the client host is one that is shared with other machines, say using NFS or AFS, then it may be useful to look at the '''NoHostAuthenticationForLocalhost''' directive, too.  

Further, at least one of the following files must exist and contain the appropriate private key.  The private key used should match the public key stored in the server or target host's '''ssh_known_hosts''' file.  Any of the three types can be used, RSA, DSA or ECDSA.    
: /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key
: /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key
: /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key

The program [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh-keysign ssh-keysign(8)] needs to read the client host's private keys in '''/etc/ssh/'''.  It is enough to have the keys by themselves, or at least one key.  If the client host's private key does not exist, it will be necessary to add one manually before host-based authentication will work.  The easy way to add the key is to install the OpenSSH server.  These keys are then created automatically when the package containing [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd sshd(8)] is installed.  Note that the client's machine does not have to have an SSH server actually running in order to use host-based authentication.  So it is entirely feasible to install but then disable or uninstall the SSH server on the client's machine just to get the host keys in place.  


==Debugging==

Configuration should be quite straight forward, with small changes in only three files, plus a key, to manage.  If there are difficulties, be prepared to run [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd sshd(8)] standalone at debug level 1 ('''-d''') to 3 ('''-ddd''') and [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh ssh(1)] at debug level 3 ('''-vvv''') a few times to see what you missed.  The mistakes have to be cleared up in the right order, so take it one step at a time.  

Here is a sample excerpt from a successful host-based authentication for user ''fred'' from the host at ''192.0.2.102'', also known as ''desktop1'', using an RSA key.

The basic SFTP service requires no additional setup, it is a built-in part of the OpenSSH server.  However, the same options and tricks available for the regular SSH client are also available for SFTP clients.  Some options may have to be specified with the full option name using the '''-o''' argument.   

For many graphical SFTP clients, it is possible to use a regular URL to point to the target.  Many file managers nowadays have built-in support for SFTP.  See the section &quot;[[OpenSSH/Client_Applications#GUI_Clients|GUI Clients]]&quot; above.

The subsystem '''sftp-server''' implements SFTP file transfer.  See [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sftp-server sftp-server(8)].  The subsystem [[OpenSSH/Server#The_SFTP_Server_Subsystem|internal-sftp]] implements an in-process SFTP server which may simplify configurations using '''ChrootDirectory''' to force a different filesystem root on clients.

==Basic SFTP==

Just to say it again, regular SFTP access requires no additional changes from the default configuration.  SFTP provides a very easy to use and very easy to configure option for accessing a remote system.  The usual clients can be used or special ones like '''sshfs'''.

===Automated SFTP===

SFTP uploads or downloads can be automated.  The prerequisite is [[OpenSSH/Cookbook/Authentication_Keys | key-based authentication]].  Once key-based authentication is working, a batch file can be used to carry out activities via SFTP.  See ''batchfile'' (-b) in [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sftp sftp(1)] for details.  

&lt;pre&gt;
$ sftp -b /home/fred/cmds.batch -i /home/fred/.ssh/foo_key_rsa server.example.org:/home/fred/logs/
&lt;/pre&gt;

If a dash ('''-''') is used as the batchfile name, SFTP commands will be read from '''stdin'''.

&lt;pre&gt;
$ echo &quot;put /var/log/foobar.log&quot; | sftp -b - -i /home/fred/.ssh/foo_key_rsa server.example.org:/home/fred/logs/
&lt;/pre&gt;

More than one SFTP command can be sent, but it is better then to use an actual batch file.

&lt;pre&gt;
$ echo -e &quot;put /var/log/foobar.log\nput /var/log/munged.log&quot; | sftp -b - -i /home/fred/.ssh/foo_key_rsa server.example.org:/home/fred/logs/
&lt;/pre&gt;

The batch file mode can be very useful in cron jobs and in scripting.

==SFTP-only Accounts==

Using the '''Match''' directive in [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd_config sshd_config(5)], it is possible to limit members of a specific group to using only SFTP for interaction with the server.  
&lt;pre&gt;
Subsystem sftp internal-sftp

Match Group sftp-only
	AllowTCPForwarding no
	X11Forwarding no
	ForceCommand internal-sftp
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note that disabling TCP forwarding does not improve security unless users are also denied shell access, as they can in principle install their own forwarders.

See PATTERNS in [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh_config ssh_config(5)] for more information on patterns avaiable to '''Match'''.

===Chrooted SFTP-only Accounts===

It's common that a group of users need to read and write files to their home directories on the server, but have little or no reason to access the rest of the file system.  SFTP provides a very easy to use and very easy to configure chroot.  In some cases, it is enough to chroot users to their home directories.
Depending on the opensshd version this may not be usable since some versions require that the chroot-target directory and all parent directories are owned by root and not writeable by any others.  In most cases home directories aren't owned by root and allow writing by at least one user.  One way around this restriction is to have the home directory owned by root, but have it populated with a number of other directories and files that are owned by the actual user to which the user can write.

&lt;pre&gt;
Subsystem sftp internal-sftp

Match Group sftp-only
	ChrootDirectory %h
	AllowTCPForwarding no
	X11Forwarding no
	ForceCommand internal-sftp
&lt;/pre&gt;

If it is not practical to have users' home directories owned by root, a compromise can be made.  '''ChrootDirectory''' can point to /home, which must be owned by root anyway, and then '''ForceCommand''' can then designate the user's home directory as the starting directory using the '''-d''' option.  

&lt;pre&gt;
Subsystem sftp internal-sftp

Match Group sftp-only
        ChrootDirectory /home
        AllowTCPForwarding no
        X11Forwarding no
        ForceCommand internal-sftp -d %u
&lt;/pre&gt;

If it is necessary to hide the contents of the home directories from other users, [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=chmod chmod(1)] should be used.  Permissions could be 0111 for /home and 0750 or 0700 for the home directories, be sure to check the group memberships as well.

Another common case is to chroot access to a web server's document root or server root.

&lt;pre&gt;
Subsystem sftp internal-sftp

Match Group webmasters
	ChrootDirectory /var/www
	AllowTCPForwarding no
	X11Forwarding no
	ForceCommand internal-sftp
&lt;/pre&gt;

===Umask===
Starting with OpenSSH 5.4, [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sftp-server sftp-server(8)] can set a umask to override the default one set by the user’s account.  The in-process SFTP server, internal-sftp, accepts the same options as the external SFTP subsystem.

&lt;pre&gt;
Subsystem sftp internal-sftp -u 0022
&lt;/pre&gt;

Earlier versions can do the same thing through the use of a helper script, but this complicates chrooted directories very much.  The helper script can be a regular script or it can be embedded inline in the configuration file though neither works easily in a chroot jail.  It’s often easier to get a newer version of [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd sshd(8)] which supports umask as part of the server’s configuration.

&lt;pre&gt;
# inline helper script for umask in OpenSSH 5.3 and earler, based on one by gilles@
Subsystem sftp /bin/sh -c 'umask 0022; /usr/libexec/openssh/sftp-server'
&lt;/pre&gt;

This umask is server-side only.  The original file permissions on the client side will usually, but not always, be used when calculating the final file permissions on the server.  This depends on the client itself.  Most clients pass the file permissions on to the server, FileZilla being a notable exception.  As such, permissions can generally be tightened but not loosened.  For example, a file that is mode 600 on the client will not be automatically made 664 or anything else less than the original 600 regardless of the server-side umask.  That is unless the client does not forward the permissions, in which case only the server's umask will be used.  So for most clients, if you want looser permissions on the uploaded file, change them on the client before uploading.

===Chrooted SFTP to Shared Directories===

Another common case is to chroot a group of users to different levels of the web server they are responsible for.  For obvious reasons, symbolic links going from inside the jail to parts of the filesystem outside the chroot jail are not accessible to the chrooted users.  So directory hierarchies must be planned more carefully if there are special combinations of access.  
&lt;pre&gt;
Subsystem sftp internal-sftp

Match Group webdevel
	ChrootDirectory /var/www/site1
	ForceCommand internal-sftp

Match Group webauthors
	ChrootDirectory /var/www/site1/htdocs
	ForceCommand internal-sftp
&lt;/pre&gt;

In these kinds of directories, it may be useful to give different levels of access to more than just one group.  In that case, ACLs should be used.

===Chrooted SFTP Accounts Accessible Only from Particular Addresses===

More complex matching can be done.  It is possible to allow a group of users to use SFTP, but not a shell login, only if they log in from a specific address or range of addresses.  If they log in from the right addresses, then get SFTP and only SFTP, but if they try to log in from other addresses they will be denied access completely.  Both conditions, the affirmative and negative matches, need to be accounted for.  

&lt;pre&gt;
Subsystem sftp internal-sftp

Match Group sftp-only, Address 192.0.43.10
        AllowTCPForwarding no
        X11Forwarding no
        ForceCommand internal-sftp
        ChrootDirectory  /home/servers/

Match Group sftp-only, Address *,!192.0.43.10
        DenyGroups sftp-only
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note that for negation a wildcard must be specified first and then the address or range to be excluded following it.  Mind the spaces or lack thereof.  Similar matching can be done for a range of addresses by specifying the addresses in CIDR address/mask format, such as 192.0.32.0/20.  Any number of criteria can be specified and only if all of them are met then the directive in the subsequent lines take effect.  

Again, the first '''Match''' block that fits is the one that takes effect, so care must be taken when constructing conditional blocks to make them fit the precise situation desired.  Also, any situations that don't fit a '''Match''' conditional block will fall through the cracks.  Those will get the general configuration settings whatever they may be.  Specific user and source address combinations can be tested with the configurations using the '''-T''' and '''-C''' options with the server for more options.  See the section [[OpenSSH/Logging#Debugging_a_server_configuration| Debugging a Server Configuration]] for more.

===Chrooted SFTP with Logging===
The logging daemon must establish a socket in the chroot directory for the sftp-server subsystem to access as '''/dev/log'''   See the section on [[OpenSSH/Logging|Logging]].

===Chrooted login shells===

The chroot and all its components, must be root-owned directories that are not writable by any other user or group.  The '''ChrootDirectory''' must contain the necessary files and directories to support the user's session.  For an interactive session this requires at least a shell, typically '''bash''' or '''ksh''' or [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sh sh(1)], and basic '''/dev''' nodes such as [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=null null(4)], [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=zero zero(4)], [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=stdin stdin(4)], [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=stdout stdout(4)], [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=stderr stderr(4)], [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=arandom arandom(4)] and [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tty tty(4)] devices.  
The path may contain the following tokens that are expanded at runtime once the connecting user has been authenticated: '''%%''' is replaced by a literal ''''%'''', '''%h''' is replaced by the home directory of the user being authenticated, and '''%u''' is replaced by the username of that user.

==sshfs - SFTP file transfer via local folders==

Another way to transfer files back and forth, or even use them remotely, is to use '''sshfs'''  It is a file system client based on SFTP and utilizes the sftp-subsystem.  It can make a directory on the remote server accessible as a directory on the local file system which can be accessed by any program just as if it were a local directory.  The user must have read-write privileges for mount point to use '''sshfs'''.  

The following creates the mount point, ''server'', in the home directory if none exists.  Then '''sshfs''' mounts the remote server.

&lt;pre&gt;
$ test -e ~/mountpoint || mkdir --mode 700 ~/mountpoint
$ sshfs fred@server.example.org:. ~/mountpoint
&lt;/pre&gt;

Reading or writing files to the mount point is actually transferring data to or from the remote system.  The amount of bandwidth consumed by the transfers can be reduced using compression.  That can be important if the network connection has bandwidth caps or per-unit fees.  However, if speed is the only issue, compression can make the transfer slower if the processors on either end are busy or not powerful enough.  About the only way to be sure is to test and see which method is faster.   Below, compression is specified with '''-C'''.

&lt;pre&gt;
$ sshfs -C fred@server.example.org:. ~/mountpoint
&lt;/pre&gt;

Or try with debugging output:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ sshfs -o sshfs_debug fred@server.example.org:. /home/fred/mountpoint
&lt;/pre&gt;

Named pipes will not work over '''sshfs'''.

===sshfs with a key ===
The '''ssh_command''' option is used to pass parameters on to &lt;tt&gt;ssh(1)&lt;/tt&gt;.  In this example it is used to have &lt;tt&gt;ssh(1)&lt;/tt&gt; point to a key used for authentication to mount a remote directory, /usr/src, locally as /home/fred/src.  
&lt;pre&gt;
$ sshfs -o ssh_command=&quot;ssh -i /home/fred/.ssh/id_rsa&quot; fred@server.example.org:/usr/src /home/fred/src/
&lt;/pre&gt;

If a usable key is already loaded into the agent, then &lt;tt&gt;ssh(1)&lt;/tt&gt; should find it and use it on behalf of &lt;tt&gt;sshfs(1)&lt;/tt&gt; without needing intervention.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==MaxStartups==

If the number of incoming connections is not managed at the network level by a packet filter or other tricks like round-robin DNS, it is possible to limit it at the SSH server itself.   Setting '''MaxStartups''' to an integer sets a hard limit to  the maximum number of concurrent unauthenticated connections to the SSH daemon.  Additional connections will be dropped until authentication succeeds or the '''LoginGraceTime''' expires for another connection.  The old default was 10.

&lt;pre&gt;
MaxStartups   10
&lt;/pre&gt;

Alternately, random early drop can be enabled by specifying the three colon-separated values ''start'':''rate'':''full''.  After the number of unauthenticated connections reaches the value specified by ''start'', '''sshd''' will begin to refuse new connections at a percentage specified by ''rate''.  The proportional rate of refused connections then increases linearly as the limit specified by ''full'' is approached until 100% is reached.  At that point all new attempts at connection are refused until the backlog goes down.  

&lt;pre&gt;
MaxStartups   10:30:100
&lt;/pre&gt;

For example, if '''MaxStartups 5:30:90''' is given in '''sshd_config''', then starting with 5 new connections pending authentication the server will start to drop 30% of the new connections.  By the time the backlog increases to 90 pending unauthenticated connections, 100% will be dropped.  

In the default settings, the value for ''full'' has been increased to 100 pending connections to make it harder to succumb to a denial of service due to attack or heavy load.  So the new default is 10:30:100.

==Preventing timeouts of a not so active session==

There are two connections that can be tracked during an SSH session, the network's TCP connection and the encrypted SSH session traveling on top of it.  Some tunnels and VPNs might not be active all the time, so there is the risk that the session times out or even that the TCP session times out at the router or firewall.  The network connection can be be tracked with '''TCPKeepAlive''', but is not an accurate indication of the state of the actual SSH connections.  It is, however, a useful indicator of the status of the actual network.  Either the client or the server can counter that by keeping either the encrypted connection active using a heartbeat.  

On the server side, '''ClientAliveInterval''' sets the interval in seconds between client alive heartbeats.  '''ClientAliveCountMax''' sets the maximum number of missed client messages allowed before the encrypted SSH session is considered closed.  If no other data has been sent or received during that time, sshd(8) will send a message through the encrypted channel to request a response from the client.  If sshd_config has ClientAliveInterval set to 15, and '''ClientAliveCountMax''' set to 4, unresponsive SSH clients will be disconnected after approximately 60 (=15 x 4) seconds.  

&lt;pre&gt;
ClientAliveInterval  15
ClientAliveCountMax  4
&lt;/pre&gt;

On the client side, if the global client configuration is not set, individual users can use '''ServerAliveInterval''' to set the interval in seconds between server alive heartbeats and  '''ServerAliveCountMax''' sets the corresponding maximum number of missed client messages allowed before the encrypted SSH session is considered closed.  The same principal applies as with the server.  This is set in [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh_config ~/.ssh/config].

&lt;pre&gt;
ServerAliveInterval  15
ServerAliveCountMax  4
&lt;/pre&gt;

==TCP Wrappers (tcpd)==

'''tcpwrappers''', also known as [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tcpd&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html tcpd(8)], is an access control utility for incoming requests to Internet services.  It can be used for services that have a one-to-one mapping to executables, such as '''sshd''', and that have been compiled to interact with '''tcpd'''.  Other options that can be used with or without '''tcpd''' include packet filters like PF &lt;ref name=&quot;Hansteen_PF&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://home.nuug.no/~peter/pf/
 |title=Firewalling with PF  |author=Peter N M Hansteen |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;, ipf or IPTables.  

'''tcpd''' checks first a whitelist ('''/etc/hosts.allow''') and then a blacklist ('''/etc/hosts.deny''') to approve or deny access.  The first pattern to match any given connection attempt is used.  The default in '''/etc/hosts.deny''' is to block access, if no rules match in '''/etc/hosts.allow''':

&lt;pre&gt;
sshd: ALL
&lt;/pre&gt;
In addition to access control, tcpd can be set to run scripts using twist or spawn when a rule is triggered.  spawn launches another program as a child process of tcpd.  From '''/etc/hosts.allow''':

&lt;pre&gt;
sshd: .example.org : allow
sshd: .example.com : spawn \
	/bin/date -u +&quot;%%F %%T UTC from %h&quot; &gt;&gt; /var/log/sshd.log : allow
&lt;/pre&gt;
The variable '''%h''' expands to the connecting clients host name or ip number.  The manual page for  [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=hosts_access&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html hosts_access(5)] includes a full description of the variables available.  Because the program in the example, date, uses the same symbol for variables, the escape character ('''%''') must be escaped ('''%%''') so it will be ignored by '''tcpd''' and get passed on to date correctly.  

'''twist''' replaces the service requested with another program.  It is sometimes used for honeypots, but can really be used for anything.  From '''/etc/hosts.deny''':

&lt;pre&gt;
sshd: .example.org : deny
sshd: ALL : twist /bin/echo &quot;Sorry, fresh out.&quot; : deny
&lt;/pre&gt;
With '''tcpwrappers''' the whitelist '''/etc/hosts.allow''' is searched first, then the blacklist '''/etc/hosts.deny'''.  The first match is applied.  If no applicable rules are found, then access is granted by default.  

===Using tcp wrappers to allow connections only from a specific subnet===

Ok, it is possible to just set [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html sshd(1)] to listen only to the local address and not accept any external connections by setting '''sshd_config''' accordingly.  That is one way.  To use '''tcpwrappers''' for that, put a line in '''/etc/hosts.deny''' blocking everything:

&lt;pre&gt;
sshd: ALL
&lt;/pre&gt;

And add an exception for the in '''/etc/hosts.allow''' by designating the ip range using CIDR notation or by domain name
&lt;pre&gt;
sshd: 192.0.32.0/20
&lt;/pre&gt;
The same method can be used to limit access to just the localhost (127.0.0.0/8) by adding a line to '''/etc/hosts.allow''':  
&lt;pre&gt;
sshd: 127.0.0.0/8
&lt;/pre&gt;
Again, the best practice is to block from everywhere and then open up exceptions.  Keep in mind that if domains are used instead of IP ranges, DNS entries must be in order and DNS itself accessible.

==The Extended Internet Services Daemon (xinetd)==

The Extended Internet Services Daemon, '''xinetd''', can provide many kinds of access control. It includes but is not limited to name, address or network of remote host and time of day.  It can place limits on the number of services per each service as well as discontinue services if loads exceed a certain limit.

The super-server listens for incoming requests and launches '''sshd''' on demand, so it is necessary to first stop '''sshd''' from running as standalone daemon.  This may mean modifying System V init scripts or Upstart configuration files.  Then make an '''xinetd''' configuration file for the service SSH. It will probably go in '''/etc/xinetd.d/ssh'''  The argument '''-i''' is important as it tells '''sshd''' that it is being run from '''xinetd'''.

&lt;pre&gt;
service ssh
{
	socket_type     = stream
	protocol        = tcp
	wait            = no
	user            = root
	server          = /usr/sbin/sshd
	server_args     = -i
	per_source      = UNLIMITED
	log_on_failure  = USERID HOST
	access_times    = 08:00-15:25
	banner          = /etc/banner.inetd.connection.txt
	banner_success  = /etc/banner.inetd.welcome.txt	
	banner_fail     = /etc/banner.inetd.takeahike.txt

	# log_on_success  = PID HOST DURATION TRAFFIC EXIT
	# instances       = 10
	# nice            = 10
	# bind            = 192.168.0.100
	# only_from       = 192.168.0.0
	# no_access       = 192.168.54.0
	# no_access       += 192.168.33.0
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Finally, reload the configuration by sending SIGHUP to '''xinetd'''.

:I'd say that [[SSH, the Secure Shell]] is a book fragment that can safely be removed at this point.  The sections 'Using SSH' and 'FAQ' are both empty and the sections 'Introduction' and 'Configuration' are extremely sparse.  These topics are already covered in great detail in [[OpenSSH]].  The section 'Installation' is redundant because all distros manage that through their package manager.  In some cases, like OS X and OpenBSD, it comes pre-installed.  As mentioned in [[OpenSSH]] there are multiple implementations of SSH. If someone with knowledge of them were to expand on them in the book, the book OpenSSH could then be renamed to a more general 'SSH, the Secure Shell' [[User:Larsnooden|Larsnooden]] ([[User talk:Larsnooden|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Larsnooden|contribs]]) 10:29, 1 March 2013 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">A proxy is an intermediary that forwards requests from clients to other servers.  Performance improvement, load balancing, security or access control are some reasons they are used.  Some proxies include caching to save bandwidth and increase speed by avoiding going out to the net to keep retrieving the same, unchanged documents.  

==SOCKS Proxy==
It's possible to connect via an intermediate machine using a SOCKS proxy.  SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxies are currently supported by OpenSSH.  SOCKS5&lt;ref name=&quot;WikiMarkup&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1928
 |title= SOCKS Protocol version 5|publisher=IETF|accessdate=2011-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; allows transparent traversal, by an application, of a firewall or other barrier and can use strong authentication with help of GSS-API.Dynamic application-level port forwarding allows the outgoing port to be allocated on the fly thus creating a proxy at the tcp session level.  

Here the web browser can connect to the SOCKS proxy on port 3555 on the local host:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -D 3555 server.example.org 
&lt;/pre&gt;

Using ssh as a socks5 proxy, or in any other capacity where forwarding is used, you can specify multiple ports in one action:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -D 80 -D 8080 -f -C -q -N fred@server.example.org
&lt;/pre&gt;

For example in Firefox, you'll also want the DNS requests to go via your proxy, so changing''' about:config''' needs '''network.proxy.socks_remote_dns''' set to '''true'''

It'll be similar for other programs that support SOCKS proxies.

You can tunnel samba over ssh, too.

===Tunneling SSH Over Tor with Netcat===

Instead of using '''ssh''' as a SOCKS proxy, it is possible to tunnel the SSH protocol itself over a SOCKS proxy such as [https://www.torproject.org/ Tor].  Tor is anonymity software and a corresponding network that uses relay hosts to conceal a user's location and network activity.   Its architecture is intended to prevent surveillance and traffic analysis.  Tor can be used in cases where it is important to conceal the point of origin of the SSH client.  

On the end point that the client sees, Tor is a regular SOCKS 5 proxy and can be used like any other SOCKS 5 proxy.  So this is tunneling SSH over a SOCKS proxy.  For example, if Tor is installed locally and listening on a port, then SSH can run over Tor
&lt;ref name=&quot;sshtor&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO/ssh |title= SSH Over Tor |publisher=The Tor Project | date=2012-08-28 | accessdate=2013-05-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; using [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=nc netcat]:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -o ProxyCommand=&quot;nc -X 5 -x localhost:9150 %h %p&quot; server.example.org
&lt;/pre&gt;

If the user name on the remote system is different from that on the local system, it is possible to pass along a different user name.

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -o User=fred -o ProxyCommand=&quot;nc -X 5 -x localhost:9150 %h %p&quot; server.example.org
&lt;/pre&gt;

When attempting a connection like this, it is very important that it does not leak information.  In particular, the DNS lookup should occur over Tor and not be done by the client itself.  Make sure that if '''VerifyHostKeyDNS''' is used that it be set to 'no'.  The default is 'no' but check to be sure.  It can be passed as a run-time argument to remove any doubt or uncertainty.

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -o &quot;VerifyHostKeyDNS=no&quot; -o ProxyCommand=&quot;nc -X 5 -x localhost:9150 %h %p&quot; server.example.org
&lt;/pre&gt;

Using the netcat-openbsd '''nc''' package, this seems not to leak any DNS information.  Other netcat packages might or might not be the same.  It's also not clear if there are other ways in which this method might leak information.  YMMV.

==Jump Hosts -- Passing through a gateway or two==
It is possible to connect to another host via an intermediary or two so that the client can act as if the connection were direct.  '''ProxyCommand''' works and the utility Netcat fits here, too.

A useful trick is &quot;ssh -tt&quot; which forces tty allocation, so instead of the above you can do the following, connecting to server2 via firewall as the jump host: 

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -tt firewall.example.com ssh -tt server2.example.org
&lt;/pre&gt;

This opens an ssh terminal to the remote machine. You can also pass commands.  For example, to reattach to a remote screen session using [http://linux.die.net/man/1/screen screen] you can do the following:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -tt firewall.example.com ssh -tt server2.example.org screen -dR
&lt;/pre&gt;

The chain can be arbitrarily long and is not limited to just two hosts. 


===Port Forwarding via an Intermediate Host===

Tunneling, also called port forwarding, is when a port on one machine mapped to a connection to a port on another machine.  In that way remote services can be accessed as if they were local.  Or in the case of reverse port forwarding, vice verse.  Forwarding can be done directly from one machine to another or via a machine in the middle.  

Below we are setting up a tunnel from the ''localhost'' to ''machine2'', which is behind a firewall, ''machine1''.  The tunnel will be via ''machine1'' which is publicly accessible and also has access to ''machine2''.
&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -L 2222:machine2.example.org:22 machine1.example.org
&lt;/pre&gt;

Next connecting to the tunnel will actually connect to the second host, ''machine2''.

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -p 2222 remoteuser@localhost
&lt;/pre&gt;

That's it.

It is possible to use all the options in this way, such as '''-X''' for X11 forwarding.  Here is an example of running '''rsync''' between the two hosts using ''machine1'' as an intermediary with the above setup.

&lt;pre&gt;
$ rsync -av -e &quot;ssh -p 2222&quot;  /path/to/some/dir/   localhost:/path/to/some/dir/
&lt;/pre&gt;

===ProxyCommand with Netcat===

Another way is to use the '''ProxyCommand''' configuration directive and [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=nc netcat].  The utility '''netcat''' is for reading and writing network connections directly.  It can be used to pass connections onward to a second machine.  In this case, ''login'' is the final destination reached via the intermediary ''jumphost''.

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -o 'ProxyCommand ssh %h nc login.example.edu 22' \
      -o 'HostKeyAlias=login.example.edu' \
      jumphost.example.org
&lt;/pre&gt;

Keys and different login names can also be used.  Using '''ProxyCommand''', '''ssh''' will first connect to ''jumphost'' and then from there to login.example.edu.  The '''HostKeyAlias''' directive is needed to look up the right key for login.example.edu, without it the key for ''jumphost'' will be tried and that will, of course, fail unless both have the same keys.  The account ''user2'' exists on ''jumphost''.  
&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -o 'ProxyCommand ssh -i key-rsa -l user2 %h nc login.example.edu 22' \
      -o 'HostKeyAlias=login.example.edu' \
      jumphost.example.org
&lt;/pre&gt;

It's also possible to make this arrangement more permanent and reduce typing by editing '''ssh_config'''  Here a connection is made to host2 via host1:

&lt;pre&gt;
Host host2.example.org
  ProxyCommand ssh fred@host1.example.org nc %h %p
&lt;/pre&gt;

Here a connection is made to server2 via server1 using the shortcut name 'jump'.

&lt;pre&gt;
Host jump
  ProxyCommand ssh %h nc server2.example.org 22
  HostKeyAlias server2.example.org
  Hostname server1.example.org
  User fred
&lt;/pre&gt;

It can be made more general:

&lt;pre&gt;
Host gateway.example.org
  ProxyCommand none

Host *.example.org my-private-host
  ProxyCommand ssh myuser@gateway.example.org nc %h %p
&lt;/pre&gt;

The same can be done with '''sftp''' by passing parameters on to '''ssh'''.   Here is a simple example with '''sftp''' where machine1 is the jump host to connect to machine2.  The user name is the same for both hosts.

&lt;pre&gt;
$ sftp -o 'ProxyCommand=ssh %h nc machine2.example.edu 22' \
       -o 'HostKeyAlias=machine2.example.edu' \
       fred@machine1.example.edu
&lt;/pre&gt;

Here is a more complex example using a key for server1 but regular password-based login for the SFTP server.  

&lt;pre&gt;
$ sftp -o 'ProxyCommand ssh -i /Volumes/Home/fred/.ssh/server1_rsa \
       -l user2 server1.example.edu nc sftp.example.edu 22'   \
       -o 'HostKeyAlias=sftp.example.edu' sftp.example.edu
&lt;/pre&gt;

If the user accounts names are different on the two machines, that works, too.  Here, 'user2' is the account on the second machine which is the final target.  The user 'fred' is the account on the intermediary or jump host.

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -l user2 \
      -o 'ProxyCommand ssh -l fred %h nc machine2.example.org 22' \
      -o 'HostKeyAlias machine2.example.org' \
      machine1.example.org
&lt;/pre&gt;

===Passing through a gateway using netcat mode===
As of OpenSSH 5.4&lt;ref name=&quot;Netcat_mode&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.openssh.com/txt/release-5.4
 |title=OpenSSH 5.4 Release Notes|publisher=OpenSSH|accessdate=2013-04-19|date=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;, a 'netcat mode' can connect stdio on the client to a single port forwarded on the server.  This can also be used to connect using '''ssh(1)''', but it needs the '''ProxyCommand''' option either as a run time parameter or as part of '''~/.ssh/config'''.  However, it no longer needs netcat to be installed on the intermediary machine(s).  Here is an example of using it in a run time parameter.  

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -o ProxyCommand=&quot;ssh -W %h:%p jumphost.example.org&quot; server.example.org
&lt;/pre&gt;

In that example, authentication will happen twice, first on the jump host and then on the final host where it will bring up a shell.  

The syntax is the same if the gateway is identified in the configuration file.  '''ssh(1)''' expands the full name of the gateway and the desintation from the configuration file.  The following allows the destination host to be reached by entering ''ssh server'' in the terminal.  

&lt;pre&gt;
Host server
  Hostname server.example.org
  ProxyCommand ssh jumphost.example.org -W %h:%p
 &lt;/pre&gt;

The same can be done for SFTP.  Here the destination SFTP server can be reached by entering ''sftp sftpserver'' and the configuration file takes care of the rest.  If there is a mix up with the final host key, then it is necessary to add in '''HostKeyAlias''' to explicitly name which key will be used to identify the destination system.  

&lt;pre&gt;
Host sftpserver
  HostName sftpserver.example.org
  HostKeyAlias sftpserver.example.org
  ProxyCommand ssh jumphost.example.org -W %h:%p
 &lt;/pre&gt;

It is possible to add the key for the gateway to the ssh-agent which you have running or else specify it in the configuration file.  The option '''User''' refers to the user name on the destination.  If the user is the same on both the destination and the originating machine, then it does not need to be used.  If the user name is different on the gateway, then the '''-l''' option can be used in the '''ProxyCommand''' option.  Here, the user ''fred'' on the local machine, logs into the gateway as ''fred2'' and into the destination server as ''fred3''.

&lt;pre&gt;
Host server
  HostName server.example.org
  User fred3
  ProxyCommand ssh -l fred2 -i /home/fred/.ssh/rsa_key jumphost.example.org -W %h:%p
&lt;/pre&gt;

If both the gateway and destination are using keys, then the option '''IdentityFile''' is used to point to the destination's private key.  

&lt;pre&gt;
Host jump
  HostName server.example.org
  IdentityFile /home/fred/.ssh/rsa_key_2
  ProxyCommand ssh -i /home/fred/.ssh/rsa_key jumphost.example.org -W %h:%p
&lt;/pre&gt;

The old way prior to OpenSSH 5.4 used netcat, '''nc(1)'''.

&lt;pre&gt;
Host server
  Hostname server.example.org
  ProxyCommand ssh jumphost.example.org nc %h %p
&lt;/pre&gt;

But that should not be used anymore and the netcat mode, provided by '''-W''', should be used instead.  The new way does not require netcat at all on any of the machines.

===Recursively chaining gateways===
It is possible to make the configuration more abstract and allow passing through an arbitrary number of gateways.   This particular configuration only works if the user name is the same across all hosts involved.  There are limitations resulting from using the slash as a separator, as there would be with other symbols.  However, it allows use of '''dirname(1)''' and '''hostname(1)''' to process the host names.  

&lt;pre&gt;
Host */* 
  ProxyCommand ssh $(dirname %h) -W $(basename %h):%p
&lt;/pre&gt;

In this way hosts are separated with a slash (/) and can be arbitrary in number&lt;ref name=&quot;proxycommand-chaining&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://joshua.hoblitt.com/rtfm/2011/09/recursively_chaining_ssh_proxycommand/ |title=Recursively chaining SSH ProxyCommand |author=Josh Hoblitt | publisher=[Read This Fine Material] from Joshua Hoblitt|date=2011-09-03 |accessdate=2014-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh host1/host2/host3/host4
&lt;/pre&gt;

If keys are to be used, then agent forwarding can be specified in the command given in the '''ProxyCommand''' option using '''-A''' and first loading the keys into the agent.

The following configuration uses '''sed(1)''' to allow different port numbers and user names using the plus sign (+) as the delimiter for hosts, a colon (:) for ports, and an equal sign (=) for user names.  The basic structure is ''ssh $() -W $():$()'' and where '''%h''' is substituted for the target host name.  

&lt;pre&gt;
Host *+*
  ProxyCommand ssh -v $(echo %h | sed -e 's/+[^+]*$//; s/\([^+=]*\)=\([^+]*\)$/\2 -l \1/; s/^\([^+:]*\):\([0-9]*\)+/-p \2 \1+/' ) -W $(echo %h | sed -e 's/^.*+//; s/:.*$//;'):$(echo %h | sed -e ' s/^.*+//; /:/!s/^.*/22/; s/^.*://' ;)
&lt;/pre&gt;

The port can be left off for the default of 22 or delimited with a colon (:) for non-standard values.  

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh host1+host2:2022+host3:2224
&lt;/pre&gt;

As-is, the colons confound '''sftp(1)''', so the above configuration will only work with it using standard ports.  If '''sftp(1)''' is needed on non-standard ports then another delimiter, such as an underscore (_), can be configured.  

Any user name except the final one can be specified for a given host using the designated delimiter, in the above it is an equal sign (=).  The destination host's user name is specified with '''-l''' and all others can be joined to their corresponding host name with the delimiter.

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -l user3 user1=host1+user2=host2+host3
&lt;/pre&gt;

If user names are specified, depending on the delimiter, '''ssh(1)''' can be unable to match the final host  to an IP number and the key fingerprint in ''known_hosts''.  In such cases, it will ask for verification each time the connection is established, but this should not be a problem if the equal sign (=) is used.

==Passing through a gateway with an ad hoc VPN==
Two subnets can be connected over ssh by configuring the network routing on the end points to use the tunnel.  The result is a VPN.  A drawback is that root access is needed on both hosts, or at least '''sudo''' access to '''ifconfig''' and '''route'''.  Note, there are very few instances where use of a VPN is legitimately called for, not because VPNs are illegal (quite they opposite, indeed data protection laws in many countries make them absolutely compulsory to protect content in transit) but simply because OpenSSH is usually flexible enough to complete most routine sysadmin and operational tasks using normal SSH methods as and when required. This SSH ad-hoc VPN method is therefore needed only very rarely.
 
Take this example with two networks.  One network has the address range 10.0.50.1 through 10.0.50.254.  The other has the address range 172.16.99.1 through 172.16.99.254.  Each has a machine, 10.0.50.1 and 172.16.99.1 respectively, that will function as a gateway.  Local machine numbering starts with 3 because 2 will be used for the tunnel interfaces on each LAN.  
&lt;pre&gt;
              +----10.0.50.1       172.16.99.1----+
              +    10.0.50.2 ===== 172.16.99.2    +
              |                                   |
10.0.50.3-----+                                   +---172.16.99.3
              |                                   |
10.0.50.4-----+                                   +---172.16.99.4
              |                                   |
10.0.50.5-----+                                   +---172.16.99.5
              |                                   |
10.0.50.etc---+                                   +---172.16.99.etc
              |                                   |
10.0.50.254---+                                   +---172.16.99.254
&lt;/pre&gt;

First a tun device is created on each machine, a virtual network device for point-to-point IP tunneling.  
Then the tun interfaces on these two gateways are then connected by an ssh tunnel.  Each tun interface is assigned an IP address.  

The tunnel connects machines  10.0.50.1 and  172.16.99.1 to each other, and each are already connected to their own local area network (LAN).  Here is a VPN with the client as 10.0.50.0/24, remote as 172.16.99.0/24.  First, set on the client:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -f -w 0:1 192.0.2.15 true
$ ifconfig tun0 10.1.1.1 10.1.1.2 netmask 255.255.255.252
$ route add 10.0.99.0/24 10.1.1.2
&lt;/pre&gt;

On the server:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ifconfig tun1 10.1.1.2 10.1.1.1 netmask 255.255.255.252
$ route add 10.0.50.0/24 10.1.1.1
&lt;/pre&gt;

Using OpenSSH with keys can facilitate secure automated backups.  It's a myth that remote root access must be allowed.  '''sudo''' works just fine -- if properly configured.  '''rsync'''&lt;ref name=&quot;RsyncWorks&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.samba.org/rsync/how-rsync-works.html |title=How Rsync Works |publisher=Samba}}&lt;/ref&gt;, '''tar''', and dump are the foundation for most backup methods.  Remember, that until the backup data has been tested and shown to restore reliably, it does not count as a backup copy.  

==Backup with rsync==

'''rsync''' now defaults to using SSH.  But it still can be specified explicitly:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ rsync --exclude '*~' -avv \
        -e &quot;ssh&quot; \
        fred@server.example.org:./archive \
        /Users/fred/archive/.
&lt;/pre&gt;

For some types of data, transfer can be speeded up greatly by using '''rsync''' with compression, -z.

===Rsync with keys===

'''rsync''' can authenticate using SSH keys.  If the key is added to an agent, then the passphrase only needs to be entered once:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ rsync --exclude '*~' -avv \
        -e &quot;ssh -i ~/.ssh/key_rsa&quot; \
        fred@server.example.org:./archive \
        /Users/fred/archive/.
&lt;/pre&gt;

===Backup with rsync and sudo===
'''rsync''' is often used to back up locally or remotely.  '''rsync'''
is fast and flexible and copies incrementally so only the changes are transferred, thus avoiding wasting time re-copying what is already at the destination.  It does that through use of its now famous algorithm.  When working remotely, it needs a little help with the encryption and the usual practice is to tunnel it over SSH.  

Preparation: create an account to use for the backup, create a pair of keys to use only for backup, then make sure you can log in to that account with '''ssh''' with and without those keys.  

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -t -i ~/.ssh/mybkupkey bkupacct@www.example.org
&lt;/pre&gt;

Step 1: Configure '''sudoers''' and test '''rsync''' with '''sudo''' on the remote host.  In this case data is staying on the remote machine.  

Step 2: Test '''rsync''' with '''sudo''' over '''ssh'''. 
&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -l bkupacct www.example.org sudo rsync -av:/var/www/ /tmp/
&lt;/pre&gt;
It will be necessary to tune '''/etc/sudoers''' a little at this stage.  More refinements may come later.  
Note that there is an '''rsync''' user and an '''ssh''' user.   The data in this case gets copied from the remote machine to the local '''/tmp'''.
&lt;pre&gt;
$ rsync -e &quot;ssh -t -l bkupacct&quot; --rsync-path='sudo rsync' \
-av bkupacct@www.example.org:/var/www/ /tmp/
&lt;/pre&gt;
Step 3: Use the key.
&lt;pre&gt;
$ rsync -e &quot;ssh -i ~/.ssh/key -t -l bkupacct&quot; --rsync-path='sudo rsync' \
-av bkupacct@www.example.org:/var/www/ /tmp/
&lt;/pre&gt;

Step 4: Adjust '''/etc/sudoers''' so that the backup account has enough access to run rsync but only in the directories it is supposed to run in and without free-rein on the system.  
Use the first debugging level to see the actual parameters getting passed to the remote host.  That provides the basis of what '''/etc/sudoers''' will need:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ rsync -e &quot;ssh -t -v&quot; --rsync-path='sudo rsync' \
-av bkupacct@www.example.org:/var/www/ /tmp/
...
debug1: Sending command: sudo rsync --server --sender -e.iLs . /var/www
...
&lt;/pre&gt;
Be sure that the backed up data is not accessible to others.  At this point you are done.  
However the process can be automated much further.  

Step 5: Test '''rsync''' with '''sudo over '''ssh'''.  
&lt;pre&gt;
$ rsync -e &quot;ssh -t&quot; --rsync-path='sudo rsync' \
-av bkupacct@www.example.org:/var/www/ /tmp/
&lt;/pre&gt;
Ok. The account on the server is named '''bkupacct''' and the private RSA key is '''~/.ssh/key_bkup_rsa''' on the client. On the server, the account bkupacct is a member of the group '''autobackup'''.

The public key, '''~/.ssh/key_bkup_rsa.pub''', has been copied to the account bkupacct on server and placed in '''~/.ssh/authorized_keys''' there. 

The following directories on server are owned by root and belong to the group bkupacct and not group readable, but not group writeable, and definitely not world readable: '''~''' and '''~/.ssh'''. Same for the file '''~/.ssh/authorized_keys''' there. (This assumes you are not also using ACLs)  This is one way of many to set permissions on the server:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ sudo chown root:bkupacct ~
$ sudo chown root:bkupacct ~/.ssh/
$ sudo chown root:bkupacct ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
$ sudo chmod u=rwx,g=rx,o= ~
$ sudo chmod u=rwx,g=rx,o= ~/.ssh/
$ sudo chmod u=rwx,g=r,o=  ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
&lt;/pre&gt;

Say you're backing up from server to client. '''rsync''' on the client uses '''ssh''' to make the connection to rsync on the server.  '''rsync''' is invoked from client like this to see exactly what parameters are being passed to the server:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ rsync \
  -e &quot;ssh \
          -i ~/.ssh/key_bkup_rsa  \
          -t             \
          -l bkupacct&quot;   \
  --rsync-path='sudo rsync' \ 
  --delete   \
  --archive  \
  --compress \
  --verbose  \
  bkupacct@server:/var/www \
  /media/backups/server/backup/
&lt;/pre&gt;
'''sudo''' will need to be configured on the server.  The argument '''--rsync-path''' tells the server what to run in place of '''rsync'''. In this case it runs '''sudo rsync'''.  The argument '''-e''' says which remote shell tool to use. In this case it is '''ssh'''.  For the SSH client being called by the '''rsync''' client, '''-i''' says which key, specifically, to use. That is independent of whether or not an authentication agent is used for ssh keys. Having more than one key is a possibility, since it is possible to have different keys for different tasks.  

Keep making adjustments to '''/etc/sudoers''' on the server until it works as it should.  You can find the exact settings(s) to use in '''/etc/sudoers''' by running the SSH in verbose mode ('''-v''') on the client.  Be careful when working with patterns not to match more that is safe.

&lt;pre&gt;
%autobackup ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/rsync --server \
--sender -vlogDtpre.if . /var/www/
&lt;/pre&gt;

==Backup using tar==
The main choice for creating archives is [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tar tar].  But since it copies whole files and directories, '''rsync''' is usually much more efficient for updates or incremental backups.  

The following will make a tarball of the directory '''/var/www''' and send it via stdout into sdtin via a pipe into '''ssh''' where, on the remote machine it is directed into the file called backup.tar.  Here '''tar''' runs on a local machine and stores the tarball remotely:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ tar cf - /var/www/ | ssh -l fred server.example.org &quot;cat &gt; backup.tar&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

There are really limitless options for that recipe:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ tar zcf - /var/www/ /home/*/www/ \
	|  ssh -l fred server.example.org &quot;cat &gt; $(date +&quot;%Y-%m-%d&quot;).tar.gz
&lt;/pre&gt;

That will do the same, but also get user www directories, compress the tarball using '''gzip''', and label the resulting file according to the current date.  

&lt;pre&gt;
$ tar zcf - /var/www/ /home/*/www/ \
	|  ssh -i key -l fred server.example.org &quot;cat &gt; $(date +&quot;%Y-%m-%d&quot;).tgz
&lt;/pre&gt;

It is just as easy to tar what is on a remote machine and store the tarball locally.  

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh fred@server.example.org &quot;tar zcf - /var/www/&quot; &gt;  backup.tgz
&lt;/pre&gt;

Or a fancier example of running tar on the remote machine but storing the tarball locally.  
&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -i key -l fred server.example.org &quot;tar jcf - /var/www/ /home/*/www/&quot; \
	&gt; $(date +&quot;%Y-%m-%d&quot;).tar.bz2
&lt;/pre&gt;

The secret to the backup is the use of '''stdout''' and '''stdin''' to effect the transfer through judicious use of pipes and redirects.

==Backup using dump==
Using [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=dump dump] remotely is like using '''tar'''.  One can copy from the remote server to the local server. 
&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -t source.example.org 'sudo dump -0an -f - /var/www | gzip -c9' &gt; backup.dump.gz
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note that the password prompt for '''sudo''' might not be visible and it must be typed blindly. 

Or one can go the other direction, copying from the locate server to the remote:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ sudo dump -0an -f - /var/www | gzip -c9 | ssh target.example.org 'cat &gt; backup.dump.gz' 
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note that here the password prompt might get hidden in the initial output from '''dump'''.  It's still there.

== Preface ==
When preparing an undergraduate class on Software Engineering, I found that there are a lot of good articles in Wikipedia covering different aspects related to software engineering.  For a beginner, however, it is not so easy to find her or his way through that jungle of articles.  It is not evident what is important and what is less relevant, where to start and what to skip in a first reading.  Also, these articles contain too much information and too few examples.  Hence the idea for this book came about: to take the relevant articles from Wikipedia, combine them, edit them, fill in the missing pieces, put them in context and create a wikibook out of them. 

The hope is that this can be used as a textbook for an introductory software engineering class.  The advantage for the instructor is that she can just pick the pieces that fit into her course and create a [[Wikibooks:Collections|collection]].  The advantage for the student is that he can have a printed  or pdf version of the textbook at a reasonable price (free) and with reasonable licenses (creative commons).

As for the philosophy behind this book: brevity is preferred to completeness, and examples are preferred to theory. If this effort was successful, you be the judge of it, and if you have suggestions for improvement, just use the ’Edit’ button!

My special thanks go to [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] and [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] who did the tedious work of importing the original articles (with all their history) from Wikipedia to Wikibooks!

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{documentation subpage}}

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

This is the {{tl|script doc auto}} template.

It is used in the [[MediaWiki:Clearyourcache]] system message that is shown on top of .css and .js pages. This template is only loaded when in &quot;User:&quot; space. It produces the small green doc box seen on top of user .css and .js pages.

When this template is called on top of [[User:Davidgothberg/monobook.js]] it produces this output:

{{script doc auto| page = User:Davidgothberg/monobook.js }}

When this template is called on top of [[User:Davidgothberg/clock.js]] it produces this output:

{{script doc auto| page = User:Davidgothberg/clock.js }}

The above boxes are not transparent, instead they use the same background color as the blue doc box.

When this template is called on a user skin file such as &quot;/monobook.css&quot; it gives a link to the accompanying &quot;/monobook.js&quot; file. It shows that link even if the accompanying skin file does not exist, but it then uses slightly different text.

For .css and .js pages in user space other than the skin files:

This template links to the documentation page for the script. It shows that link even if the documentation has not been created, but it then uses slightly different text. The doc pages of scripts are the page name but without the ending &quot;.css&quot; or &quot;.js&quot;. For instance [[User:Davidgothberg/clock.js]] has its documentation at [[User:Davidgothberg/clock]].

This template also detects if a .js page has an accompanying .css file and then links between them. It doesn't show that link if the other file does not exist.

For testing and demonstration purposes this template can take a parameter named '''page'''. Like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{script doc auto| page = User:Davidgothberg/clock.js }}
&lt;/pre&gt;

The '''page''' parameter makes this template behave exactly as if on that page.

=== Technical details ===

Internally this template uses the {{tl|str len}} template. Since {{tl|str len}} is heavy on the servers this template only calls it once, then it feeds the result to {{tl|script doc auto/core}} which contains most of the code for this template, that template then in turn calls {{tl|script doc auto/core2}} which renders the green doc box and the actual text messages.

'''Note to admins:''' MediaWiki does not parse and convert HTML wikimarkup in system messages the same way as it does for normal pages. This means for instance that &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;br&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is not automatically converted to &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;br /&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and missing &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;/td&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags are not automatically added. Thus see to that any HTML code you use in this template is valid XHTML. That is, close all tags that you begin. However, regular wikimarkup works fine in most system messages.

      <text xml:space="preserve">__NOTOC__
== Introduction ==
This book is an introduction to the art of software engineering. It is intended as a textbook for an undergraduate level course.

Software engineering is about teams. The problems to solve are so complex or large, that a single developer cannot solve them anymore. Software engineering is also about communication. Teams do not consist only of developers, but also of testers, architects, system engineers, customer, project managers, etc. Software projects can be so large that we have to do careful planning. Implementation is no longer just writing code, but it is also following guidelines, writing documentation and also writing unit tests. But unit tests alone are not enough. The different pieces have to fit together. And we have to be able to spot problematic areas using metrics. They tell us if our code follows certain standards. Once we are finished coding, that does not mean that we are finished with the project: for large projects maintaining software can keep many people busy for a long time. Since there are so many factors influencing the success or failure of a project, we also need to learn a little about project management and its pitfalls, but especially what makes projects successful. And last but not least, a good software engineer, like any engineer, needs tools, and you need to know about them.
 
==== Developers Work in Teams ====
In your beginning semesters you were coding as individuals.  The problems you were solving were small enough so one person could master them.  In the real world this is different: the problem sizes and time constraints are such that only teams can solve those problems.

For teams to work effectively they need a language to communicate (UML). Also teams do not consist only of developers, but also of testers, architects, system engineers and most importantly the customer.  So we need to learn about what makes good teams, how to communicate with the customer, and how to document not only the source code, but everything related to the software project.
 
==== New Language ==== 
In previous courses we learned languages, such as Java or C++, and how to turn ideas into code.  But these ideas are independent of the language.  With UML we will see a way to describe code independently of language, and more importantly, we learn to think in one higher level of abstraction.  UML can be an invaluable communication and documentation tool.

We will learn to see the big picture: patterns. This gives us yet one higher level of abstraction.  Again this increases our vocabulary to communicate more effectively with our peers.  Also, it is a fantastic way to learn from our seniors.  This is essential for designing large software systems.

==== Measurement ==== 
Also just being able to write software, doesn’t mean that the software is any good.  Hence, we will discover what makes good software, and how to measure software quality. On one hand we should be able to analyse existing source code though static analysis and measuring metrics, but also how do we guarantee that our code meets certain quality standards?  Testing is also important in this context, it guarantees high quality products.

==== New Tools ==== 
Up to now, you may known about an IDE, a compiler and a debugger.  But there are many  more tools at the disposal of a software engineer.  There are tools that allow us to work in teams, to document our software, to assist and monitor the whole development effort.  There are tools for software architects, tools for testing and profiling, automation and re-engineering.

This is the {{tl|script doc auto/core}} sub-template.

Do not use this template directly, use {{tl|script doc auto}} instead.

This template is called from {{tl|script doc auto}}. This template in turn calls {{tl|script doc auto/core2}} which renders the green doc box.

This sub-template currently expects these parameters:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{script doc auto/core
| page = User:Example/script.js
| pagelen = 22   &lt;!--Length of pagename fed to &quot;page&quot;--&gt;

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

This is the {{tl|script doc auto/core2}} sub-template.

Do not use this template directly, use {{tl|script doc auto}} instead.

This template is called from {{tl|script doc auto/core}}, which in turn is called from {{tl|script doc auto}}.

This template renders the green doc box.

This sub-template currently expects these parameters:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{script doc auto/core2
| pagetype = js / css

| gotdocpage = yes / 'empty string'
| docpage = User:Example/script

| gotsisterpage = yes / 'empty string'

| sistertype = css / js
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Factory method ==

Is this the same thing as the Factory Method pattern? --[[User:Fishpi|Fishpi]] ([[User talk:Fishpi|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Fishpi|contribs]]) 20:57, 17 February 2011 (UTC)

I'm having severe doubts such a simple design guideline should be called an idiom at all. But let's assume it is. The implementation using static methods is &quot;sub-optimal&quot;, as it returns by value which will entail one unnecessary copy construction. The obvious implementation for this &quot;idiom&quot; is by using type tags:

class Game
{
  public:
struct SinglePlayerTag {};
struct MultiPlayerTag {};

    Game(SinglePlayerTag): Game(0) {} // named constructor
    Game(MultiPlayerTag ): Game(1) {} // named constructor
private:
    Game (int game_type);
};


An alternative is using Int2Type used on an enum specyfing single and multiplayer.</text>

      <comment>just because the page is for html4 doesn't mean you also need to ignore quotes in the &lt;source&gt; tags...</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Rails generates XHTML by default.  It can be made to generate HTML4.01 that can be validated with [http://validator.w3.org/ The W3C HTML validator].

== DOCTYPE ==

Layouts begin with the HTML4.01 Strict DOCTYPE:

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd&quot;&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== ApplicationHelper ==

&lt;code&gt;application_helper.rb&lt;/code&gt; looks something like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;rails&quot;&gt;
module Html4ize

  # Supports making alternative versions of Rails helpers that output HTML
  # 4.01 markup as opposed to XHTML.  Example:
  #
  #   html4_version_of :submit_tag
  #
  # ..which creates a submit_tag_html4 helper that takes the same options as
  # submit_tag but which renders HTML 4.01.
  #
  def html4_version_of  helper_name
    define_method &quot;#{helper_name}_html4&quot; do |*args|
      html = send  helper_name, *args
      html.gsub! &quot; /&gt;&quot;, &quot;&gt;&quot;
      html
    end
  end

  def html4_versions_of *helper_names
    helper_names.each do |helper_name|
      html4_version_of  helper_name
    end
  end

  class &lt;&lt; self
    def included  receiver
      receiver.extend Html4ize
    end
  end

end


# Methods added to this helper will be available to all templates in the application.
module ApplicationHelper

  include Html4ize

  html4_versions_of :stylesheet_link_tag, :image_tag, :text_field, :submit_tag

  ...

end


# Extend FormBuilder with our own helper methods
class ActionView::Helpers::FormBuilder

  include Html4ize

  html4_versions_of :text_field, :check_box, :hidden_field, :submit

  ...

end
&lt;/source&gt;

== Views ==

Views can then refer to the newly-wrapped helpers:

&lt;source lang=&quot;rails&quot;&gt;

  ...

  &lt;%= image_tag_html4 &quot;logo.png&quot; %&gt;

  ...

  &lt;% form_for :person do |form| %&gt;

    &lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Name:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;%= form.text_field_html4 :name %&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    ...

    &lt;div class=&quot;submit&quot;&gt;&lt;%= form.submit_html4 &quot;Save&quot; %&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;% end %&gt;

&lt;/source&gt;

== Labs ==

=== Lab 1a: StarUML (30 min) ===
We need to learn about a UML modelling tool.  StarUML&lt;ref&gt;http://staruml.sourceforge.net/en/ StarUML - The Open Source UML/MDA Platform&lt;/ref&gt; is a free UML modelling tool that is quite powerful, it allows for forward and reverse engineering.  It supports Java, C++ and C#.  A small disadvantage is that it is no longer supported, hence it is limited to Java 1.4 and C# 2.0, which is very unfortunate.

Start StarUML, and select ’Empty Project’ at the startup. Then in the Model Explorer add a new model by right-clicking on the ’untitled’ thing. After that you can create all kinds of UML diagrams by right-clicking on the model.

More details can be found at the following StarUML Tutorial. &lt;ref&gt;http://cnx.org/content/m15092/latest/ StarUML Tutorial&lt;/ref&gt;


=== Lab 1b: objectiF (30 min) ===
Another UML modelling tool, which is free for personal use is objectiF.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.microtool.de/objectif/en/index.asp objectiF - Tool for Model-Driven Software Development with UML&lt;/ref&gt;  To learn how to use objectiF, take a look at their tutorial.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.microtool.de/mT/pdf/objectiF/01/Tutorials/JavaTutorial.pdf Developing Java Applications with UML&lt;/ref&gt;


=== Lab 2: Restaurant Example (30 min) ===
Take the restaurant example from class and create all the different UML diagrams we created in class using StarUML or your favorite UML modelling tool. 

Once you are done with the class diagram, try out the 'Generate Code' feature.  In StarUML you right-click with your mouse in the class diagram, and select 'Generate Code'.  Look at the classes generated and compare them with your model.

Important Note: the restaurant example actually is not a very good example, because it may give you the impression that actors become objects.  They don't.  Actors never turn into objects, actors are always outside the system, hence the Tetris example below is much better.


=== Lab 3: Tetris (60 min) ===
Most of us know the game of Tetris.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris Tetris&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.percederberg.net/games/tetris/index.html Java Tetris&lt;/ref&gt; (However, I had students who did not know it, so in case you don't please learn about it and play it for a little before continuing with this lab).  If you recall from class, when inventing UML, the Three Amigos started with something that was called Object Oriented Analysis and Object Oriented Design.    So let's do it.

==== Object Oriented Analysis and Design ====
We want to program the game Tetris.  But before we can start we need to analyze the game.  We first need to identify 'objects' and second we must find out how they relate and talk to each other.  So for this lab do the following:
* build teams of 5 to 6 students per team
* looking at the game, try to identify objects, for instance the bricks that are dropping are objects
* have each student represent an object, e.g., a brick
* what properties does that student/brick have? (color,shape,...)
* how many bricks can there be, how do they interact?
* is the player who plays the game also an object or is she an actor?
* how does the player interact with the bricks?
* what restrictions exist on the movement of the bricks, how would you implement them?
* how would you calculate a score for the game?

==== Game Time ====
Once you have identified all the objects, start playing the real game.  For this one student is the 'actor', one student will write the minutes (protocol), and the other students will be objects (such as bricks).  Now start the game: the actor and the different objects interact by talking to each other.  The student who writes the minutes, will write down who said what to whom, i.e., everything that was said between the objects and the actor and the objects amongst themselves.  

Play the game for at least one or two turns.  Does your simulation work, did you forget something?  Maybe you need to add another object, like a timer.  

==== UML ====
We now need to make the connection between the play and UML.  
* Use Case diagram:  this is pretty straightforward, you identify the actor as the player, and write down all the use cases that the player can do.  One question you should check, if the timer is an actor.  The Use Case diagram tells you how your system interacts with its environment.  Draw the Use Case diagram for Tetris.
* Activity diagram:  from your game you find that there is some repetition, and some decisions have to be made at different stages in the game.  This can be nicely represented with an Activity diagram.  Draw a high level Activity diagram for the game.

Next we come to our minutes (protocol): this contains all the information we need to draw a Sequence diagram and finally arrive at the Collaboration diagram.
* Sequence diagram: take a look at your minutes (protocol).  First, identify the objects and put them horizontally.  Then go through your minutes line for line.  For every line in your minutes, draw the corresponding line in your Sequence diagram.  As you can see the Sequence diagram is in one-to-one correspondence with the minutes.
* Collaboration diagram: from the Sequence diagram it is easy to create the Collaboration diagram.  Just do it.
* Class diagram (Association): from the Collaboration diagram, you can infer the classes and the methods the classes need.  As for the attributes, some you have already identified (like the color and shape of the bricks), others you may have to think about for a little.  Draw the class diagram, and for every class try to guess what attributes are needed for the class to work properly.
* Class diagram (Inheritance): if you have some more experience with object-oriented languages, you may try to identify super classes, i.e., try to use inheritance to take into account common features of objects.

If you performed this lab properly, you will have learned a lot.  First, you have seen that through a simulation it is possible to identify objects, connections between the objects, hidden requirements and defects in you assumptions.  Second, using a carefully written protocol of your simulation is enough to create Sequence, Collaboration and Class diagrams.  So there is no magic in creating these diagrams, it is just playing a game.  Although you may think this is just a funny or silly game, my advice to you: play this game for every new project you start.

= Dutch Defence with 2.Bg5 =
=== 2. ... h6 ===
Black drives back the white bishop. White can now play either Bf4 or Bh4, the latter maintaining the pin on the pawn. Because 2. ... h6 weakens black's kingside squares, some players prefer to avoid it, although there is no obvious refutation for white.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==1st Order Differential Equations==
1st Order Differential Equations has the Characteristic Equation of the form shown below
:&lt;math&gt;A \frac{d}{dx} f(x) + B = 0&lt;/math&gt;

It can be shown that roots o the differential equation above is
:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = Ae^(- \alpha x) &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\alpha = \frac{B}{A}&lt;/math&gt;

==Proof==
The above equation can be rewritten as
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d f(x)}{dx} + \frac{B}{A} f(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
Then
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d f(x)}{dx} = - \frac{B}{A} f(x) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\int \frac{d f(x)}{f(x)} = - \frac{B}{A} \int dx&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Ln f(x) = - \frac{B}{A} x + C&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = e^(- \frac{B}{A} x + C)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = Ae^(- \frac{B}{A} x) &lt;/math&gt;

==Summary==
First ordered differential equation of the form
:&lt;math&gt;A \frac{d}{dx} f(x) + B = 0&lt;/math&gt;

has a exponential root of the form
: &lt;math&gt;f(x) = e^(-\alpha x + c)&lt;/math&gt;
where
: &lt;math&gt;\alpha x = \frac{B}{A}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;A = e^c&lt;/math&gt;
or
: &lt;math&gt;f(x) = A e^(-\alpha x)&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==2nd Order Differential Equation==
2nd Order Differential Equation is an equation that has the general form
:&lt;math&gt;a \frac{d^2}{dx^2} f(x) + b \frac{d}{dx} f(x) + c = 0&lt;/math&gt;

==Characteristic Equation==
2nd Order Differential Equations above can be rewritten as shown
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2 }{dx^2} f(x) + \frac{b}{a} \frac{d }{dx} f(x) + \frac{c}{a} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Let 
: &lt;math&gt;s = \frac{d}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;
Then
:&lt;math&gt;s^2 + \frac{b}{a} s + \frac{c}{a}= 0&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;s = (-\alpha \pm \sqrt{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;) t
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \frac{b}{2a}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\beta = \frac{c}{a}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda = \sqrt{\alpha^2 - \beta^2} &lt;/math&gt;

===Case 1===
When 
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda = 0&lt;/math&gt;
Then
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha^2 = \beta^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;s = e^(-\alpha t)&lt;/math&gt;
Equation has ''one real'' roots

===Case 2===
When
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;
Then
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha^2 &gt; \beta^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;s = e^(-\alpha x) e ^ [\pm (\lambda x)]&lt;/math&gt;
Equation has ''two real'' roots

===Case 3===
When
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;
Then
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha^2 &lt; \beta^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;s = e^(-\alpha t) [e^(\pm j\lambda t)]&lt;/math&gt;
Equation has ''two compex'' roots

==Special Case==
===Case 1===
Differential Equation of the form
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2 f(t)}{dt^2} + \lambda = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;s^2 = -\lambda &lt;/math&gt;

Roots of equation
:&lt;math&gt;s = \pm j\sqrt{\lambda} &lt;/math&gt;
===Case 2===
Differential Equation of the form
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2 f(t)}{dt^2} - \lambda = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;s^2 = \lambda &lt;/math&gt;

Roots of equation
:&lt;math&gt;s = \pm \sqrt{\lambda} &lt;/math&gt;

==Summary==
2nd Order Differential Equation
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2 }{dx^2} f(x) + \frac{b}{a} \frac{d }{dx} f(x) + \frac{c}{a} = 0&lt;/math&gt;
has roots depend on the value of &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\lambda = 0 . f(x) = e^(-\alpha x) &lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\lambda &gt; 0 . f(x) = e^(-\alpha x) e^(\pm \lambda x)&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\lambda &lt; 0 . f(x) = e^(-\alpha x) e^(\pm j\lambda x)&lt;/math&gt;
With
: &lt;math&gt;\alpha = \frac{b}{a}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\beta = \frac{c}{a}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\lambda = \sqrt{\alpha^2 - \beta^2}&lt;/math&gt;

==scanssh==
'''scanssh''' scans hosts and networks for running services.
ScanSSH - Scanning the Internet for SSH Servers
&lt;ref name=&quot;Provos_ScanSSH&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.citi.umich.edu/u/provos/papers/scanssh.pdf
 |title=ScanSSH - Scanning the Internet for SSH Servers|author=Niels Provos|author=Peter Honeyman |publisher=CITI|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It checks the version number of the server and displays the results in a list.  It detects ssh, sftp and several kinds of  SOCKS, HTTP, and telnet  proxies.  

Scan a small subnet for ssh servers:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ sudo scanssh -n 22 -s ssh 192.168.100.32/26
&lt;/pre&gt;

Scan the same small network for socks proxies:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ sudo scanssh -s socks5,socks4 192.168.100.32/26
&lt;/pre&gt;
Variable scanning speeds can be set as well as random sampling.  Open proxy detection scans to detect open proxies on common ports.

Scan 1000 hosts randomly selected from 172.16.1.1 through 172.31.254.254, at a rate of 200 per second :
&lt;pre&gt;
$ sudo scanssh -r 200 -p random(1000)/172.16.0.0/12
&lt;/pre&gt;

The hosts and networks to be scanned can be either specified as an IPv4 address or an CIDR like IP prefix with ip address and network mask.  Ports can be appended by adding a colon at the end of address specification.  The sequence of hosts scanned is random, but that can be modified by the following two parameters, random and split:

'''random(n[,seed])/''' selects a sample of n random addresses from the range specified as targets for scanning.  n is the number of address to randomly create in the given network and seed is an optional seed for the pseudo random number generator.
For example, it is possible to sample 10000 random hosts from the Internet by specifying 'random(10000)/0.0.0.0/0' as the address.

'''split(s,e)/'''	selects a specific segment of the address range for use.  e specifies the number of segments in parallel and s is the segment number used by this particular scan.  This can be used to scan from several hosts in parallel by scanning a different segment from each host. 

'''-n''' Specifies the port numbers to scan.  Ports are separated by commas.  Each specified scanner is run for each port in this list.  The default port is 22.

Scan for ssh servers on both port 22 and 2022:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ scanssh -s ssh -n 22,2022 192.168.0.0/24
&lt;/pre&gt;

==sshfs==

'''sshfs''' builds on Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE) to use allow non-privileged users to create a secure, reliable file system framework.  As the name implies, this is done in user space and not the kernel as is usually required for file systems.  FUSE has a stable API library and bindings to C, C++ and Java.  In this case it is specifically the SFTP client that is mounted as a file system.  

'''sshfs''' allows a remote file system to be mounted as a local folder taking advantage of the SFTP subsystem.   It uses SFTP to mount a directory from a remote server as a local directory. In that way, all use applications can interact with that directory and its contents as if it were local.   

See the Cookbook section on [[OpenSSH/Cookbook/SFTP|SFTP]]

==sshfp==

'''sshfp''' generates SSHFP NS records using the public keys stored in a '''known_hosts''' file or provided by '''ssh-keyscan''', as a means to use DNS to publish SSH key fingerprints.  That in turn allows DNSSEC lookups to verify SSH keys before use.  
SSHFP resource records in DNS are used to store fingerprint of SSH public host keys that are associated with host names.  A record itself consists of an algorithm number, fingerprint type and the fingerprint of the public host key.  
See RFC 4255 for details on SSHFP.

==keychain==

'''keychain''' is a manager for '''ssh-agent''' to allow multiple shells and processes, including cron jobs, to use the keys held by the agent.  It is often integrated into desktop-specific tools like Apple Keychain on OS X or kdewallet for KDE.  
http://www.funtoo.org/en/security/keychain/intro/

==rsync==

'''rsync''' is a file transfer utility to transfer files between computers very efficiently. It can run on top of SSH or use its own protocol.  SSH is the default.  http://rsync.samba.org/

==Gnome SSH Tunnel Manager (gstm)==
'''gstm''' is a graphical front-end for managing SSH connections and especially port forwarding.
http://sourceforge.net/projects/gstm/

==sslh==
'''sslh''' is a protocol demultiplexer.  It accepts connections on specified ports and forwards them based on the first packet sent by the client.  It can be used to share a single port between SSH, SSL, HTTP, OpenVPN, tinc and XMPP.
http://www.rutschle.net/tech/sslh.shtml

==Additional Third Party Utilities==

The following are useful in working with OpenSSH, but outside the scope of this book to go into detail.  However, they are enough worth mentioning to warrant a list:

: '''netstat''' – Show network connections, routing tables, interface statistics, masquerade connections, and multicast memberships
: '''nc''' or '''netcat''' – Netcat, the TCP/IP swiss army knife.
: '''socat''' – SOcket CAT, a multipurpose relay similar to netcat.
: '''nmap''' – Network exploration tool and security scanner.
: '''tcpdump''' – Display network traffic realtime.
: '''telnet''' – Unencrypted interaction with another host.
: '''pagsh''' – Creates a new credential cache sandbox and process authentication group (PAG).  
: '''nohup''' – Invoke a process that ignores HANGUP signals
: '''sudo''' – Execute programs as another user
: '''lftp''' – A handy interactive multi-protocol file transfer text-based client supporting SFTP.
: '''curl''' – A multi-protocol file transfer text-based client supporting SCP and SFTP.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Multiplexing is the ability to send more than one signal over a single line or connection.  With multiplexing, OpenSSH can re-use an existing TCP connection for multiple concurrent SSH sessions rather than creating a new one each time.  

__TOC__

==Advantages of Multiplexing==

An advantage with SSH multiplexing is that the overhead of creating new TCP connections is eliminated.  The overall number of connections that a machine may accept is a finite resource and the limit is more noticeable on some machines than on others, and varies greatly depending on both load and usage.  There is also significant delay when opening a new connection.  Activities that repeatedly open new connections can be significantly sped up using multiplexing.

The difference multiplexing and standalone sessions can be seen by comparing the tables below.  We see in the table &quot;SSH Connections, Separate&quot; that without multiplexing each new login creates a new TCP connection, one per login session.  Following that we see in the other table, &quot;SSH Connections, Multiplexed&quot;, that when multiplexing is used, new logins are channeled over the already established TCP connection.    

&lt;pre&gt;
#              Local Address       Foreign Address         State

# one connection
tcp    0   0   192.168.x.y:45050   192.168.x.z:22       ESTABLISHED

# two separate connections
tcp    0   0   192.168.x.y:45050   192.168.x.z:22       ESTABLISHED
tcp    0   0   192.168.x.y:45051   192.168.x.z:22       ESTABLISHED

# three separate connections
tcp    0   0   192.168.x.y:45050   192.168.x.z:22       ESTABLISHED
tcp    0   0   192.168.x.y:45051   192.168.x.z:22       ESTABLISHED
tcp    0   0   192.168.x.y:45052   192.168.x.z:22       ESTABLISHED

Table 1: SSH Connections, Separate
&lt;/pre&gt;

Both tables show TCP/IP connections associated with SSH sessions.  The table above shows a new TCP/IP connection for each new SSH connection.  The table below shows a single TCP/IP connection despite multiple active SSH sessions.  

&lt;pre&gt;
#              Local Address       Foreign Address         State

# one connection
tcp    0   0   192.168.x.y:58913   192.168.x.z:22       ESTABLISHED

# two multiplexed connections
tcp    0   0   192.168.x.y:58913   192.168.x.z:22       ESTABLISHED

# three multiplexed connections
tcp    0   0   192.168.x.y:58913   192.168.x.z:22       ESTABLISHED

Table 2: SSH Connections, Multiplexed
&lt;/pre&gt;

As we can see, with multiplexing only a single TCP connection is set up and used regardless of whether or not there are multiple SSH sessions carried over it.

Or we can compare the time it takes to run [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ls ls(1)] on a slow remote server, using [http://linux.die.net/man/1/time  time(1)], first without multiplexing:

&lt;pre&gt;
real	0m0.658s
user	0m0.016s
sys	0m0.008s
&lt;/pre&gt;

Then we do the same, but use a multiplexed connection:

&lt;pre&gt;
real	0m0.029s
user	0m0.004s
sys	0m0.004s
&lt;/pre&gt;

The difference is quite large and will definitely add up for any activity where connections are made repeatedly.

==Setting Up Multiplexing==

OpenSSH does multiplexing using the '''ControlMaster''', '''ControlPath''' and '''ControlPersist''' configuration directives and get defined in [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh_config&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html ssh_config(5)] ('''~/.ssh/config''').  All three are described in the manual page for [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh_config&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html ssh_config(5)].   

'''ControlMaster''' determines whether [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh ssh(1)] will listen for control connections and what to do about them.  '''ControlPath''' is the location for the control socket used by the multiplexed sessions.  These can be set globally or locally in [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh_config&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html ssh_config(5)] or specified at run time.  Control sockets are removed automatically when the master connection is ended.  '''ControlPersist''' can be used in conjunction with '''ControlMaster'''.  If set to 'yes', it will leave the master connection open in the background  indefinitely to accept new connections until either killed explicitly or closed with '''-O'''.

&lt;pre&gt;
Host machine1
	HostName machine1.example.org
	ControlPath ~/.ssh/controlmasters/%r@%h:%p
	ControlMaster auto
	ControlPersist 10m
&lt;/pre&gt;

With that configuration, the first connection to ''machine1'' will create a control socket in the directory '''~/.ssh/controlmasters/'''  Then any subsequent connections, up to 10 by default as set by '''MaxSessions''', will re-use that control path automatically as multiplexed sessions.   Confirmation of each new connection can be required if '''ControlMaster''' set to 'autoask' instead of 'auto'.  

The option '''-O''' can be used to manage the connection using the same shortcut configuration.   

&lt;pre&gt;
ssh -O check machine1
ssh -O stop machine1
&lt;/pre&gt;

First, the status of the connection is checked.  Then the master connection is told not to accept further multiplexing requests.  To cancel all existing connections, including the master connection, use 'exit' instead of 'stop'.

====Manually Establishing Multiplexed Connections====

Multiplexed sessions need a control master to connect to.  The run time parameters '''-M''' and '''-S''' also correspond to '''ControlMaster''' and '''ControlPath''', respectively.   So first an initial master connection is established using '''-M''' when accompanied by the path to the control socket using '''-S'''.

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -M -S /home/fred/.ssh/controlmasters/fred@server.example.org:22 server.example.org
&lt;/pre&gt;

Then subsequent multiplexed connections are made in other terminals.  They use '''ControlPath''' or '''-S''' to point to the control socket.  

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -S /home/fred/.ssh/controlmasters/fred@server.example.org:22 server.example.org
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note that the control socket is named &quot;fred@server.example.org:22&quot;, or ''%r@%h:%p'', to try to make the name unique.  The sockets should be given unique names.  The combination %r,  %h and %p stand for the remote user name, the remote host and the remote host's port.  

Multiple '''-M''' options place [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh ssh(1)] into '''master''' mode with confirmation required before slave connections are accepted.  This is the same as '''ControlMaster=ask'''.  Both require X to ask for the confirmation.  

Here is the master connection for the host ''server.example.org'' as set to ask for confirmation of new multiplexed sessions:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -MM -S ~/.ssh/controlmasters/fred@server.example.org:22 server.example.org
&lt;/pre&gt;

And here is a subsequent multiplexed connection:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -S ~/.ssh/controlmasters/fred@server.example.org:22  server.example.org
&lt;/pre&gt;

The status of the control master connection can be queried using '''-O check''', which will tell if the it is running or not.

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -O check -S ~/.ssh/controlmasters/fred@server.example.org:22  server.example.org
&lt;/pre&gt;

If the control session has been stopped, the query will return an error about &quot;No such file or directory&quot; even if there are still multiplexed sessions running because the socket is gone.  

Alternately, configuration options can be spelled out in full using '''-o'''.   The way below sets configuration options as run time parameters.  First, a control master is started.

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -o &quot;ControlMaster=yes&quot; -o &quot;ControlPath=/home/fred/.ssh/controlmasters/%r@%h:%p&quot; server.example.org
&lt;/pre&gt;

Then subsequent sessions are connected to the control master via socket at the end of the control path.

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -o &quot;ControlPath=/home/fred/.ssh/controlmasters/%r@%h:%p&quot;  server.example.org
&lt;/pre&gt;

And of course all that can be put into '''ssh_config'''.

===Ending Multiplexed Connections===

One way to end multiplexed sessions is to exit all related '''ssh''' sessions, including the control master.  If the control master has been placed in the background using '''ControlPersist''', then it will be necessary to stop it with '''-O''' and either '''stop''' or '''exit'''.  That also requires knowing the full path and filename of the control socket, if it has not been defined in a short cut in '''ssh_config'''.

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -O stop server1
$ ssh -O stop -S ~/.ssh/controlmasters/fred@server1.example.org:22 server1.example.org
&lt;/pre&gt;

The multiplex command '''-O stop''' will gracefully shutdown multiplexing.  After issuing the command, the control socket is removed and no new multiplexed sessions are accepted for that master.  Existing connections are allowed to continue and the master connection will persist until the last multiplexed connection closes.  

The multiplex command '''-O exit''' removes the control socket and immediately terminates all existing connections.  

The directive '''ControlPersist''' can also be set to timeout after a set period of disuse.  The time interval there is written in a time in a format listed in [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd_config sshd_config(5)] or else defaults to seconds if no units are given.   It will cause the master connection to automatically close if it has no client connections for the specified time.  

&lt;pre&gt;
Host server1
 	HostName server1.example.org
	ControlPath ~/.ssh/controlmasters/%r@%h:%p
	ControlMaster yes
	ControlPersist 2h
&lt;/pre&gt;

The above example lets the control master timeout after 2 hours of inactivity.  Care should be used.   A user that can read and write to a control socket can establish new connections without further authentication.  

===Multiplexing Options===

The values for configuring session multiplexing can be set either in the user-specific [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh_config&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html ssh_config(5)] or the global '''/etc/ssh/ssh_config''' or using parameters when running from the shell or a script.   '''ControlMaster''' can be overridden in the run time arguments to re-use an existing master when '''ControlMaster''' is set to 'yes', by setting it explicitly to 'no':

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -o &quot;ControlMaster=no&quot; server.example.org
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''ControlMaster''' accepts five different values: 'no', 'yes', 'ask', 'auto', and 'autoask'.   

* 'no' is the default.  New sessions will not try to connect to an established master session, but additional sessions can still multiplex by connecting explicitly to an existing socket.

* 'yes' creates a new master session each time, unless explicitly overridden.  The new master session will listen for connections.   

* 'ask'  creates a master each time, unless overridden, and listens for connections.  If overridden,  [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh-askpass&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html ssh-askpass(1)] will popup an message in X to ask the master session owner to approve or deny the request.  If the request is denied, then the session being created falls back to being a regular, standalone session.    

* 'auto' creates a master session automatically but if there is a master session already available, subsequent sessions are automatically multiplexed.

* 'autoask' automatically assumes that if a master session exists, that subsequent sessions should be multiplexed, but ask first before adding a session.   

Refused connections are logged to the master session.

&lt;pre&gt;
Host * 
	ControlMaster ask 
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''ControlPath'''  can be a fixed string or include any of serveral pre-defined variables.  '''%L''' is for the first component of the local host name and '''%l''' for the full local hos
t name.  '''%h''' is the target host name and '''%n''' is the original target host name and '''%p''' is for the destination port on the remote server.  '''%r''' is for the remote user name and '''%u''' for the user running [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html ssh(1)]

&lt;pre&gt;
Host * 
	ControlMaster ask 
	ControlPath ~/.ssh/controlmasters/%r@%h:%p
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''ControlPersist''' accepts 'yes', 'no' or a time interval.  If a time interval is given, the default is in seconds.  Units can extend the time to minutes, hours, days, weeks or  a combination.  If 'yes' the master connection stays in the background indefinitely. 

&lt;pre&gt;
Host * 
	ControlMaster ask 
	ControlPath ~/.ssh/controlmasters/%r@%h:%p
	ControlPersist 10m
&lt;/pre&gt;

====Port Forwarding After the Fact====

It is possible to request port forwarding without having to establish new connections.  Here we forward port 8080 on the local host to port 80 on the remote host using '''-L''':

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -O forward -L 8080:localhost:80 -S ~/.ssh/controlmasters/fred@server.example.org:22  server.example.org
&lt;/pre&gt;

The same can be done for remote forwarding, using '''-R'''.  The escape sequence '''~C''' is not available for multiplexed sessions, so '''-O forward''' is the only way to add port forwarding on the fly.  

Port forwarding can be canceled without having to close any sessions using '''-O cancel'''.  

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -O cancel -L 8080:localhost:80 -S ~/.ssh/controlmasters/fred@server.example.org:22  server.example.org
&lt;/pre&gt;

The exact same syntax used for forwarding is used for cancelling.  However, there is no way currently to look up which ports are being forwarded and how they are forwarded.  

==Additional Notes About Multiplexing==

Never use any publicly accessible directory for the control path sockets.  Place those sockets in a directory somewhere else, one to which only your account has access.  For example '''~/.ssh/socket/''' would be a much safer choice and '''/tmp/''' would be a bad choice. 

In cases where it is useful to have a standing connection, it is always possible to combine multiplexing with other options, such as '''-f''' or '''-N''' to have the control master drop to the background upon connection and not load a shell.  

In [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd_config sshd_config(5)], the directive '''MaxSessions''' specifies the maximum number of open sessions permitted per network connection.  This is used when multiplexing ssh sessions over a single TCP connection.  Setting '''MaxSessions''' to 1 disables multiplexing and setting it to 0 disables login/shell/subsystem sessions completely.  The default is 10.  The '''MaxSessions''' directive can also be set under a '''Match''' conditional block.

===Errors Preventing Multiplexing===

The directory used must be on a file system that allows the creation of sockets.   AFS is one example, as are some implementations of HFS+.  If an attempt is made at creating a socket on a file system that does not allow it, an error something like the following will occur:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -M -S /home/fred/.ssh/mux 192.0.2.57
muxserver_listen: link mux listener /home/fred/.ssh/mux.vjfeIFFzHnhgHoOV =&gt; /home/fred/.ssh/mux: Operation not permitted
&lt;/pre&gt;

If the file system cannot be reconfigured to allow sockets, then the only other option is to place the control path socket somewhere else on a file system that does support creation of sockets.

==Multiplexing HTTPS and SSH Using sslh==

A different kind of multiplexing is when more than one protocol is carried over the same port.  [http://www.rutschle.net/tech/sslh.shtml sslh] does just that with SSL and SSH.  It figures out what kind of connection is coming in and forwards it to the appropriate service.  Thus it allows a server to receive both HTTPS and SSH over the same port.  Note that this does not actually hide SSH.  A scan for SSH on the listening port, say with [[OpenSSH/Third_Party_Utilities#scanssh|scanssh(1)]], will show that it is there.  What it does is make it possible to have one less port open in the firewall.  Here's how [http://linux.die.net/man/8/sslh sslh(8)] can be installed in four steps:

* First install your web server and configure it to accept HTTPS.  Be sure that it listens for HTTPS on the localhost only.  It can also help if it is on a non-standard port, say  2443, instead of 443.  

* Next, set your SSH server to accept connections on the localhost for port 22.  It really could be any port, but port 22 is the standard for SSH.

* Next, create an unprivileged user to run [http://linux.die.net/man/8/sslh sslh(8)].  The example below has the user ''sslh'' for the unprivileged account.  

* Lastly, install and launch [http://linux.die.net/man/8/sslh sslh(8)] so that it listens on port 443 and forwards HTTPS and SSH to the appropriate ports on the localhost.  Substitute the external IP number for your machine.  The actual name of the executable and path may vary from system to system:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ /usr/local/sbin/sslh-fork -u sslh -p xx.yy.zz.aa:443 --tls 127.0.0.1:2443 --ssh 127.0.0.1:22
&lt;/pre&gt;

Another option is to use a configuration file with [http://linux.die.net/man/8/sslh sslh(8)] and not pass any parameters at runtime.  There should be at least one sample configuration file, ''basic.cfg'' or ''example.cfg'', included in the package when it is installed.  The finished configuration file should look something like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
user: &quot;sslh&quot;;
listen: ( { host: &quot;xx.yy.zz.aa&quot;; port: &quot;443&quot; } );
on-timeout: &quot;ssl&quot;;
protocols:
(
   { name: &quot;ssh&quot;; host: &quot;localhost&quot;; port: &quot;22&quot;; probe: &quot;builtin&quot;; },
   { name: &quot;ssl&quot;; host: &quot;localhost&quot;; port: &quot;2443&quot;; probe: &quot;builtin&quot;; }
);
&lt;/pre&gt;

Mind the quotes, commas, and semicolons.  

If SSH is used in conjunction with TCP Wrappers, as described in [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=hosts_access&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=5 hosts_access(5)], then the option '''service:''' works to provide the name of the service that they need.    

&lt;pre&gt;
   { name: &quot;ssh&quot;; service: &quot;ssh&quot;; host: &quot;localhost&quot;; port: &quot;22&quot;; probe: &quot;builtin&quot;; },
&lt;/pre&gt;

If TCP Wrappers are not used, which is most likely the case, then '''service:''' is not needed.  

Runtime parameters override any configuration file settings that may be in place.  [http://linux.die.net/man/8/sslh sslh(8)] supports the protocols HTTP, SSL, SSH, OpenVPN, tinc, and XMPP out of the box.  But actually any protocol that can be identified by regular expression pattern matching can be used.  There are two variants of [http://www.rutschle.net/tech/sslh.shtml sslh], a forked version (sslh or sslh-fork) and a single-threaded version (sslh-select).

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:DNA replication split.svg|thumb|250px|right|[[DNA replication]]. DNA is unwound and [[nucleotide]]s are matched to make two new strands.]]
As we know Cell division is essential for an organism to grow, but, when a cell divides, it must replicate the DNA (DNA replication take place during S phase) in its genome so that the two daughter cells have the same genetic information as their parent. The double-stranded structure of DNA provides a simple mechanism for DNA replication. Here, the two strands are separated and then each strand's complementary DNA sequence is recreated by an enzyme called '''DNA polymerase'''. This enzyme makes the complementary strand by finding the correct base through complementary base pairing, and bonding it onto the original strand. As DNA polymerases can only extend a DNA strand in a 5′ to 3′ direction, different mechanisms are used to copy the antiparallel strands of the double helix. In this way, the base on the old strand dictates which base appears on the new strand, and the cell ends up with a perfect copy of its DNA.

==Replication==
[[Image:Replication fork.svg|right|350px|thumb|Schematic representation of the replication fork.&lt;br&gt;'''a:''' template, '''b:''' leading strand, '''c:''' lagging strand, '''d:''' replication fork, '''e:''' primer, '''f:''' Okazaki fragments]]
In a cell, DNA replication begins at specific locations in the genome, called '''&quot;origins&quot;'''. Unwinding of DNA at the origin, and synthesis of new strands, forms a '''replication fork'''. In addition to DNA polymerase, the enzyme that synthesizes the new DNA by adding nucleotides matched to the template strand, a number of other proteins are associated with the fork and assist in the initiation and continuation of DNA synthesis.
DNA replication can also be performed ''in vitro'' (outside a cell). DNA polymerases, isolated from cells, and artificial DNA primers are used to initiate DNA synthesis at known sequences in a template molecule. The polymerase chain reaction '''(PCR)''', a common laboratory technique, employs such artificial synthesis in a cyclic manner to amplify a specific target DNA fragment from a pool of DNA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_replication DNA replication]&lt;/ref&gt;


===Leading strand===
The leading strand template is the template strand of the DNA double helix that is oriented in a 3' to 5' manner. All DNA synthesis occurs 5'-3'. The original DNA strand must be read 3'-5' to produce a 5'-3' nascent strand.
The leading strand is formed along the leading strand template as a polymerase &quot;reads&quot; the template DNA and continuously adds nucleotides to the 3' end of the elongating strand. This polymerase is DNA polymerase III (DNA Pol III) in prokaryotes and presumably Pol ε in eukaryotes.

===Lagging strand===
[[Image:Dnareplication.png|thumb|250 px|Lagging strand during DNA replication]]
The lagging strand template is the coding strand of the DNA double helix that is oriented in a 5' to 3' manner. The newly made lagging strand still is synthesized 5'-3'. However, since the DNA is oriented in a manner that does not allow continual synthesis, only small sections can be read at a time. An RNA primer is placed on the DNA strand 3' to the origin of replication. Just as before, DNA Polymerase reads 3'-5' on the original DNA to produce a 5'-3' nascent strand. Polymerase reaches the origin of replication and stops replication until a new RNA primer is placed 3' to the last RNA primer. These fragments of DNA produced on the lagging strand are called Okazaki fragments. The orientation of the original DNA on the lagging strand prevents continual synthesis. As a result, replication of the lagging strand is more complicated than of the leading strand.
On the lagging strand template, primase &quot;reads&quot; the DNA and adds RNA to it in short, separated segments. In eukaryotes, primase is intrinsic to '''Pol α'''. '''DNA polymerase III''' or '''Pol δ''' lengthens the primed segments, forming '''Okazaki fragments'''. Primer removal in eukaryotes is also performed by Pol δ. In prokaryotes, DNA polymerase I &quot;reads&quot; the fragments, removes the RNA using its flap endonuclease domain, and replaces the RNA nucleotides with DNA nucleotides (this is necessary because RNA and DNA use slightly different kinds of nucleotides). DNA ligase joins the fragments together.

====Okazaki fragment====

An '''Okazaki fragment''' is a relatively short fragment of DNA (with no RNA primer at the 5' terminus) created on the lagging strand during DNA replication. The lengths of Okazaki fragments are between 1,000 to 2,000 nucleotides long in ''E. coli'' and are generally between 100 to 200 nucleotides long in eukaryotes.  It was originally discovered in 1968 by Reiji Okazaki, Tsuneko Okazaki, and their colleagues while studying replication of bacteriophage DNA in ''Escherichia coli''.&lt;ref&gt;Okazaki R, Okazaki T, Sakabe K, Sugimoto K.  Mechanism of DNA replication possible discontinuity of DNA chain growth. An American scientist, by the last name Shandel, discovered this mechanism prior to Okazaki, however he was never accredited with the discovery since the head of his research team decided the discovery was an erronus interpretation of test results.  Jpn J Med Sci Biol. 1967 Jun;20(3):255-60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ogawa T, Okazaki T, Discontinuous DNA Replication. ''Annu. Rev. Biochem.'' 49:421-457, 1980&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:DNA_replication_editable.svg|thumb|550px|right|DNA replication. The double helix is unwound by a helicase and topoisomerase. Next, one DNA polymerase produces the leading strand copy. Another DNA polymerase binds to the lagging strand. This enzyme makes discontinuous segments (called Okazaki fragments) before DNA ligase joins them together.]]

===Classification of DNA polymerase===

Based on sequence homology, DNA polymerases are subdivided into seven different families:''' A, B, C, D, X, Y, and RT'''.

'''1.Family A'''
Polymerases contain both replicative and repair polymerases. Replicative members from this family include the extensively-studied T7 DNA polymerase, as well as the eukaryotic mitochondrial DNA Polymerase γ. Among the repair polymerases are Escherichia coli DNA pol I, Thermus aquaticus pol I, and Bacillus stearothermophilus pol I. These repair polymerases are involved in excision repair and processing of Okazaki fragments generated during lagging strand synthesis.

'''2.Family B'''
In XPV patients, alternative error-prone polymerases, e.g., Pol ζ (zeta) (polymerase ζ is a B Family polymerase a complex of the catalytic subunit REV3L with Rev7, which associates with Rev1), are thought to be involved in mistakes that result in the cancer predisposition of these patients. The DNA polymerase which belongs to B family contain DTDS motif. The  other members are Pol ε, Pol α, Pol δ.  

'''3.Family C'''
Polymerases are the primary bacterial chromosomal replicative enzymes. DNA Polymerase III alpha subunit from E. coli is the catalytic subunit  and possesses no known nuclease activity. A separate subunit, the epsilon subunit, possesses the 3'-5' exonuclease activity used for editing during chromosomal replication. Recent research has classified Family C polymerases as a subcategory of Family X.

'''4.Family D'''
Polymerases are still not very well characterized. All known examples are found in the Euryarchaeota subdomain of Archaea and are thought to be replicative polymerases.

'''5.Family X'''
Contains the well-known eukaryotic polymerase pol β, as well as other eukaryotic polymerases such as pol σ, pol λ, pol μ, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT). Pol β is required for short-patch base excision repair, a DNA repair pathway that is essential for repairing abasic sites. Pol λ and Pol μ are involved in non-homologous end-joining, a mechanism for rejoining DNA double-strand breaks. TdT is expressed only in lymphoid tissue, and adds &quot;n nucleotides&quot; to double-strand breaks formed during V(D)J recombination to promote immunological diversity. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has only one Pol X polymerase, Pol IV, which is involved in non-homologous end-joining.

'''6.Family Y'''
''Y Polymerases differ from others in having a low fidelity'' on undamaged templates and in their ability to replicate through damaged DNA. Members of this family are hence called translesion synthesis (TLS) polymerases. Depending on the lesion, TLS polymerases can bypass the damage in an error-free or error-prone fashion, the latter resulting in elevated mutagenesis. Xeroderma pigmentosum variant (XPV) patients for instance have mutations in the gene encoding Pol η (eta), which is error-free for UV-lesions. Other members in humans are Pol ι (iota), Pol κ (kappa), and Rev1 (terminal deoxycytidyl transferase). In E. coli, two TLS polymerases, ''Pol IV'' (DINB) and ''Pol V'' (UmuD'2C), are known.

'''7.Family RT (reverse transcriptase)'''
The reverse transcriptase family contains examples from both retroviruses and eukaryotic polymerases. The eukaryotic polymerases are usually restricted to telomerases. These polymerases use an RNA template to synthesize the DNA strand.

==Replication is semiconservative==
[[Image:DNAreplicationModes.png|thumb|400px|right|A summary of the three postulated methods of DNA synthesis]]
The '''Meselson and Stahl experiment''' was an experiment by [[Matthew Meselson]] and [[Franklin Stahl]] in 1958 which supported the hypothesis that ''DNA replication'' was semiconservative. Semiconservative replication means that when the double stranded DNA helix was replicated, each of the two double stranded [[DNA]] helices consisted of one strand coming from the original helix and one newly synthesized. It has been called &quot;the most beautiful experiment in biology.&lt;ref&gt;John Cairns to Horace F Judson, in The Eighth Day of Creation: Makers of the Revolution in Biology (1979). Touchstone Books, ISBN 0-671-22540-5. 2nd edition: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1996 paperback: ISBN 0-87969-478-5.&lt;/ref&gt;&quot;


'''Three hypotheses had been previously proposed for the method of replication of DNA.'''  

In the ''semiconservative'' hypothesis, proposed by [[James D. Watson|Watson]] and [[Francis Crick|Crick]], the two strands of a DNA molecule separate during replication.  Each strand then acts as a template for synthesis of a new strand &lt;ref name=&quot;Watson&amp;Crick&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=WATSON JD, CRICK FH |title=The structure of DNA |journal=Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory|Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. |volume=18 |issue= |pages=123–31 |year=1953 |pmid=13168976 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The ''conservative'' hypothesis proposed that the entire DNA molecule acted as a template for synthesis of an entirely new one.  According to this model, [[histone]] proteins bound to the DNA, distorting it in such a way as to expose both strands' bases for hydrogen bonding &lt;ref name=&quot;Bloch&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bloch DP |title=A POSSIBLE MECHANISM FOR THE REPLICATION OF THE HELICAL STRUCTURE OF DESOXYRIBONUCLEIC ACID |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=41 |issue=12 |pages=1058–64 |year=1955 |month=December |pmid=16589796 |pmc=528197 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

The ''dispersive'' hypothesis is exemplified by a model proposed by [[Max Delbrück]], which attempts to solve the problem of unwinding the two strands of the double helix by a mechanism that breaks the DNA backbone every 10 nucleotides or so, untwists the molecule, and attaches the old strand to the end of the newly synthesized one.  This would synthesize the DNA in short pieces alternating from one strand to the other &lt;ref name=&quot;Delbruck&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Delbrück M |title=ON THE REPLICATION OF DESOXYRIBONUCLEIC ACID (DNA) |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=40 |issue=9 |pages=783–8 |year=1954 |month=September |pmid=16589559 |pmc=534166 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Each of these three models makes a different prediction about the distribution of the &quot;old&quot; DNA in molecules formed after replication.  In the conservative hypothesis, after replication, one molecule is the entirely conserved &quot;old&quot; molecule, and the other is all newly synthesized DNA.  The semiconservative hypothesis predicts that each molecule after replication will contain one old and one new strand.  The dispersive model predicts that each strand of each new molecule will contain a mixture of old and new DNA &lt;ref name=”Delbruck&amp;Stent”&gt;{{cite book |last1=Delbrück | first1=Max |last2=Stent |first2=Gunther S. |editor1-first=William D.| editor1-last=McElroy |editor2-first=Bentley |editor2-last=Glass |title=A Symposium on the Chemical Basis of Heredity|publisher=Johns Hopkins Pr. |date=1957 |pages=699–736 |chapter=On the mechanism of DNA replication}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The semi-conservative theory can be confirmed by making use of the fact that DNA is made up of nitrogen bases. Nitrogen has an isotope N15 (N14 is the most common isotope) called heavy nitrogen. The experiment that confirms the predictions of the semi-conservative theory&lt;ref name=&quot;Meselson&amp;Stahl&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Meselson, M. and Stahl, F.W. | title=The Replication of DNA in Escherichia coli | year=1958 | journal=PNAS | volume=44 | pages=671–82 |pmid=16590258 | url = http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&amp;pubmedid=16590258 | doi=10.1073/pnas.44.7.671}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meselson M, Stahl FW. Demonstration of the semiconservative mode of DNA duplication.  In “Phage and the Origins of Molecular Biology” (editors Cairns J, Stent GS, Watson JD) pages 246-251 of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory of Quantitative Biology, First edition (1966). ASIN: B00C2G89LM&lt;/ref&gt; makes use of this isotope and runs as follows:
Bacterial (E coli) DNA is placed in a media containing heavy nitrogen(N15), which binds to the DNA, making it identifiable.
Bacteria containing this DNA are then placed in a media with the presence of N14 and left to replicate only once. The new bases will contain nitrogen 14 while the originals will contain N15
The DNA is placed in test tubes containing caesium chloride (heavy compound) and centrifuged at 40,000 revolutions per minute.
The caesium chloride molecules sink to the bottom of the test tubes creating a density gradient. The DNA molecules will position at their corresponding level of density (taking into account that N15 is more dense than N14)
These test tubes are observed under ultraviolet rays. DNA appears as a fine layer in the test tubes at different heights according to their density.
According to the semi-conservative theory, after one replication of DNA, we should obtain 2 hybrid (part N14 part N15) molecules from each original strand of DNA. This would appear as a single line in the test tube. This result would be the same for the dispersive theory. On the other hand, according to the conservative theory, we should obtain one original DNA duplex and a completely new one i.e. two fine lines in the test tube placed separately one from the other. Up to this point, either the semi-conservative or the dispersive theories could be truthful, as experimental evidence confirmed that only one line appeared after one replication. In order to conclude between those two, DNA had to be left to replicate again, still in a media containing N14.
In the dispersive theory, after 2 divisions we should obtain a single line, but further up in the test tube, as the DNA molecules become less dense as N14 becomes more abundant in the molecule According to the semi-conservative theory, 2 hybrid molecules and 2 fully N14 molecules should be produced, so two fine lines at different heights in the test tubes should be observed. Experimental evidence confirmed that two lines were observed therefore offering compelling evidence for the semi-conservative theory.

''Genetic evidence''

An independent 'genetic' evidence for the semi-conservative theory was provided more recently by high throughput genomic sequencing of individual mutagenized bacteria. '' E. coli'' were treated with Ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS), known to induce G:C → A:T transitions due to generation of abnormal base O-6-ethylguanine, which is further misrecognized during DNA replication and paired with T instead of C. The sequenced DNA from individual colonies of EMS-mutagenized bacteria exhibited long stretches of solely G → A or C → T transitions, which in some cases were spanning entire bacterial genome. The elementary explanation of this observation is based on semi-conservative mechanism: one should expect the segregation between daughter strands into different cells after replication, which leads to each descendant cell having exclusively G → A or C → T conversions.

'''Nitrogen''' is a major constituent of DNA. [[Nitrogen-14|&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N]] is by far the most abundant isotope of nitrogen, but DNA with the heavier (but non-radioactive) [[Nitrogen-15|&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N]] isotope is also functional. 

''[[E. coli]]'' were grown for several generations in a medium with &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N.  When DNA is extracted from these cells and centrifuged on a salt density gradient, the DNA separates out at the point at which its density equals that of the salt solution. The DNA of the cells grown in &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N medium had a higher density than cells grown in normal &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N medium. After that, ''E. coli'' cells with only &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N in their DNA were transferred to a &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N medium and were allowed to divide; the progress of cell division was monitored by measuring the optical density of the cell suspension. 

DNA was extracted periodically and was compared to pure &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N DNA and &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N DNA. After one replication, the DNA was found to have close to the intermediate density. Since conservative replication would result in equal amounts of DNA of the higher and lower densities (but no DNA of an intermediate density), conservative replication was excluded.  However, this result was consistent with both semiconservative and dispersive replication. Semiconservative replication would result in double-stranded DNA with one strand of &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N DNA, and one of &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N DNA, while dispersive replication would result in double-stranded DNA with both strands having mixtures of &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N and &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N DNA, either of which would have appeared as DNA of an intermediate density.

The authors continued to sample cells as replication continued.  DNA from cells after two replications had been completed was found to consist of equal amounts of DNA with two different densities, one corresponding to the intermediate density of DNA of cells grown for only one division in &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N medium, the other corresponding to DNA from cells grown exclusively in &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N medium.  This was inconsistent with dispersive replication, which would have resulted in a single density, lower than the intermediate density of the one-generation cells, but still higher than cells grown only in &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N DNA medium, as the original &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N DNA would have been split evenly among all DNA strands.  The result was consistent with the semiconservative replication hypothesis &lt;ref name=&quot;Meselson&amp;Stahl&quot; /&gt;

==Replication in prokaryote==
DNA replication in prokaryotes is extensively studied in E. coli. It is bi-directional and originates at a single origin of replication 
'''(OriC)'''.

===Primase===
In bacteria, primase binds to the DNA helicase forming a complex called the primosome. Primase is activated by DNA helicase where it then synthesizes a short RNA primer approximately 11 ±1 nucleotides long, to which new nucleotides can be added by DNA polymerase.

===Primosome===
A primosome is a protein complex responsible for creating RNA primers on single stranded DNA during DNA replication.Primosomes are nucleoproteins assemblies that activate DNA replication forks. Their primary role is to recruit the replicative helicase onto single-stranded DNA. The &quot;replication restart&quot; primosome, defined in Escherichia coli, is involved in the reactivation of arrested replication forks. 

Assembly of the Escherichia coli primosome requires six proteins, PriA, PriB, PriC, DnaB, DnaC, and DnaT, acting at a primosome assembly site (pas) on an SSBcoated single-stranded (8s) DNA. Assembly is initiated by interactions of PriA and PriB with ssDNA and the pas. PriC, DnaB, DnaC, and DnaT then act on the PriAPriB- DNA complex to yield the primosome.

The primosome consists of '''seven proteins''': '''DnaG''' primase, '''DnaB''' helicase, '''DnaC''' helicase assistant, '''DnaT, PriA, Pri B,''' and '''PriC'''. The primosome is utilized once on the leading strand of DNA and repeatedly, initiating each Okazaki fragment, on the lagging DNA strand. Initially the complex formed by '''PriA, PriB, and PriC''' binds to DNA. Then the DnaB-DnaC helicase complex attaches along with '''DnaT'''. This structure is referred to as the '''pre-primosome'''. Finally, '''DnaG''' will bind to the pre-primosome forming a complete primosome. The primosome attaches 1-10 RNA nucleotides to the single stranded DNA creating a DNA-RNA hybrid. This sequence of RNA is used as a primer to initiate DNA polymerase III. The RNA bases are ultimately replaced with DNA bases by RNase H nuclease (eukaryotes) or DNA polymerase I nuclease (prokaryotes). DNA Ligase then acts to join the two ends together.
===Elongation of DNA strand===
Once priming is complete, ''DNA polymerase III holoenzyme'' is loaded into the DNA and replication starts. The catalytic mechanism of DNA polymerase III involves the use of two metal ions in the active site, and a region in the active site that can discriminate between deoxyribonucleotides and ribonucleotides. The metal ions are general divalent cations that help the 3' OH initiate a nucleophilic attack onto the alpha phosphate of the deoxyribonucleotide and orient and stabilize the negatively charged triphosphate on the deoxyribonucleotide. Nucleophilic attack by the 3' OH on the alpha phosphate releases pyrophosphate, which is then subsequently hydrolyzed (by inorganic phosphatase) into two phosphates. This hydrolysis drives DNA synthesis to completion.

Furthermore, DNA polymerase III must be able to distinguish between correctly paired bases and incorrectly paired bases. This is accomplished by distinguishing Watson-Crick base pairs through the use of an active site pocket that is complementary in shape to the structure of correctly paired nucleotides. This pocket has a tyrosine residue that is able to form van der Waals interactions with the correctly paired nucleotide. In addition, dsDNA (double stranded DNA) in the active site has a wider and shallower minor groove that permits the formation of hydrogen bonds with the third nitrogen of purine bases and the second oxygen of pyrimidine bases. Finally, the active site makes extensive hydrogen bonds with the DNA backbone. These interactions result in the DNA polymerase III closing around a correctly paired base. If a base is inserted and incorrectly paired, these interactions could not occur due to disruptions in hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions.

DNA is read in the 3' → 5' direction, therefore, nucleotides are synthesized (or attached to the template strand) in the 5' → 3' direction. However, one of the parent strands of DNA is 3' → 5' while the other is 5' → 3'. To solve this, replication occurs in opposite directions. Heading towards the replication fork, the '''leading strand is synthesized in a continuous fashion''', only requiring one primer. On the other hand, the '''lagging strand''', heading away from the replication fork, is synthesized in a series of '''short fragments known as Okazaki fragments''', consequently requiring many primers. The RNA primers of Okazaki fragments are subsequently degraded by RNAse H and DNA Polymerase I (exonuclease), and the gap (or nicks) are filled with deoxyribonucleotides and sealed by the enzyme ligase.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prokaryotic_DNA_replication Prokaryotic DNA replication]&lt;/ref&gt;

The rate of semiconservative DNA replication in a living cell was first measured as the rate of phage T4 DNA strand elongation in phage-infected E. coli.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = McCarthy | first1 = D. | last2 = Minner | first2 = C. | last3 = Bernstein | first3 = H. | last4 = Bernstein | first4 = C. | title = DNA elongation rates and growing point distributions of wild-type phage T4 and a DNA-delay amber mutant. | journal = J Mol Biol | volume = 106 | issue = 4 | pages = 963-81 | month = Oct | year = 1976 | doi =  | PMID = 789903 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the period of exponential DNA increase at 37°C, the rate of strand elongation was 749 nucleotides per second.  The mutation rate per base pair per round of replication during phage T4 DNA synthesis is 2.4 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Drake | first1 = JW. | last2 = Charlesworth | first2 = B. | last3 = Charlesworth | first3 = D. | last4 = Crow | first4 = JF. | title = Rates of spontaneous mutation. | journal = Genetics | volume = 148 | issue = 4 | pages = 1667-86 | month = Apr | year = 1998 | doi =  | PMID = 9560386}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Thus semiconservative DNA replication is both rapid and accurate.

===Termination===
Termination of DNA replication in ''E. coli'' is completed through the use of termination sequences and the '''Tus''' protein.
Tus is a sequence-specific DNA binding protein that promotes termination in prokaryotic DNA replication. In ''E. Coli'', Tus binds to ten closely related 23 basepair binding sites encoded in the bacterial chromosome. These sites, called '''Ter sites''', are designated '''TerA, TerB, ..., TerJ'''. The binding sites are asymmetric, such that when a Tus-Ter complex (Tus protein bound to a Ter site) is encountered by a replication fork from one direction, the complex is dissociated and replication continues (permissive). When encountered from the other direction, however, the Tus-Ter complex provides a much larger kinetic barrier and halts replication (non-permissive). The multiple Ter sites in the chromosome are oriented such that the two oppositely moving replication forks are both stalled in the desired termination region.

==DNA polymerase in prokaryote==
[[Image:PolymeraseDomains.jpg|right|thumb|300px|&lt;center&gt;Functional domains in the Klenow Fragment (left) and DNA Polymerase I (right).&lt;/center&gt;]]
In Prokaryotic there are 5 kind of DNA polymerases:

'''Pol I:''' implicated in DNA repair; has 5'-&gt;3' polymerase activity, and both 3'-&gt;5' exonuclease activity (proofreading) and 5'-&gt;3' exonuclease activity (RNA primer removal).

'''Pol II:''' involved in repairing damaged DNA; has 3'-&gt;5' exonuclease activity.The enzyme is 90 kDa in size and is coded by the polB gene. DNA Pol II can synthesize DNA new base pairs at an average rate of between 40 and 50 nucleotides/second.

'''Pol III:''' the main polymerase in bacteria (responsible for elongation); has 3'-&gt;5' exonuclease activity (proofreading).The replisome is composed of the following:
2 DNA Pol III enzymes, made up of α, ε and θ subunits.
the α subunit synthesizes the RNA/DNA primer.
the ε subunit synthesizes the leading strand.
the θ subunit stimulates the ε subunit's proofreading.
2 β units which act as sliding DNA clamps, they keep the polymerase bound to the DNA.
2 τ units which acts to dimerize two of the core enzymes (α, ε, and θ subunits).
1 γ unit which acts as a clamp loader for the lagging strand Okazaki fragments, helping the two β subunits to form a unit and bind to DNA. The γ unit is made up of 5 γ subunits which include 3 γ subunits, 1 δ subunit, and 1 δ' subunit. The δ is involved in copying of the lagging strand

'''Pol IV:''' a Y-family DNA polymerase.

'''Pol V:''' a Y-family DNA polymerase; participates in bypassing DNA damage.
===DNA Polymerase I or Pol I===

DNA Polymerase I (or Pol I) is an enzyme that participates in the process of DNA replication in prokaryotes. It contains 928 amino acids, and is an example of a processive enzyme - it can sequentially catalyze multiple polymerisations. It was Discovered by '''Arthur Kornberg in 1956''', it was the first known DNA polymerase (and, indeed, the first known of any kind of polymerase). It was initially characterized in E. coli, although it is ubiquitous in prokaryotes. In E. coli and many other bacteria, the gene which encodes '''Pol I is known as polA'''.
Pol I possesses three enzymatic activities: (1) a 5' -&gt; 3' (forward) DNA polymerase activity, requiring a 3' primer site and a template strand; (2) a 3' -&gt; 5' (reverse) exonuclease activity that mediates proofreading; and (3) a 5' -&gt; 3' (forward) exonuclease activity mediating nick translation during DNA repair.

==== Klenow fragment====
The 5' → 3' exonuclease activity of DNA polymerase I from E. coli makes it unsuitable for many applications, the Klenow fragment, which lacks this activity, can be very useful in research. The Klenow fragment is extremely useful for research-based tasks such as: (1) Synthesis of double-stranded DNA from single-stranded templates; (2) Filling in (meaning removal of overhangs to create blunt ends) recessed 3' ends of DNA fragments; (3) Digesting away protruding 3' overhangs; (4) Preparation of radioactive DNA probes.
The Klenow fragment was also the original enzyme used for greatly amplifying segments of DNA in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) process, before being replaced by thermostable enzymes such as Taq polymerase.

==Helicases and Topoisomerase==

Many cellular processes (DNA replication, transcription, translation, recombination, DNA repair, ribosome biogenesis) involve the separation of nucleic acid strands. Helicases are often utilized to separate strands of a DNA double helix or a self-annealed RNA molecule using the energy from ATP hydrolysis, a process characterized by the breaking of hydrogen bonds between annealed nucleotide bases. They move incrementally along one nucleic acid strand of the duplex with a directionality and processivity specific to each particular enzyme. There are many helicases '''(14 confirmed in E. coli, 24 in human cells)''' resulting from the great variety of processes in which strand separation must be catalyzed.

Helicases adopt different structures and oligomerization states. Whereas DnaB-like helicases unwind DNA as donut-shaped hexamers, other enzymes have been shown to be active as monomers or dimers. Studies have shown that helicases may act passively, waiting for uncatalyzed unwinding to take place and then translocating between displaced strands,[1] or can play an active role in catalyzing strand separation using the energy generated in ATP hydrolysis. In the latter case, the helicase acts comparably to an active motor, unwinding and translocating along its substrate as a direct result of its ATPase activity. Helicases may process much faster in vivo than in vitro due to the presence of accessory proteins that aid in the destabilization of the fork junction.
Defects in the gene that codes helicase cause Werner syndrome, a disorder characterized by the appearance of premature aging.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicase Helicase]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Superfamilies'''

Helicases have been classified in 5 superfamilies (SF1-SF5). All of the proteins bind ATP, and, as a consequence, all of them carry the classical Walker A (phosphate-binding loop or P-loop) and Walker B (Mg2+-binding aspartic acid) motifs.

Superfamily I: UvrD (E. coli, DNA repair), Rep (E. coli, DNA replication), PcrA (Staphylococcus aureus, recombination), Dda (bacteriophage T4, replication initiation), RecD (E. coli, recombinational repair), TraI (F-plasmid, conjugative DNA transfer). This family includes RNA helicases thought to be involved in duplex unwinding during viral RNA replication. Members of this family are found in positive-strand single-stranded RNA viruses from superfamily 1. This helicase has multiple roles at different stages of viral RNA replication, as dissected by mutational analysis.

Superfamily II: RecQ (E. coli, DNA repair), eIF4A (Baker's Yeast, RNA translation), WRN (human, DNA repair), NS3[5] (Hepatitis C virus, replication). TRCF (Mfd) (E.coli, transcription-repair coupling).

Superfamily III: LTag (Simian Virus 40, replication), E1 (human papillomavirus, replication), Rep (Adeno-Associated Virus, replication, viral integration, virion packaging). 
Superfamily 3 consists of helicases encoded mainly by small DNA viruses and some large nucleocytoplasmic DNA viruses.[6][7] Small viruses are very dependent on the host-cell machinery to replicate. SF3 helicase in small viruses is associated with an origin-binding domain. By pairing a domain that recognises the ori with a helicase, the virus can bypass the host-cell-based regulation pathway and initiate its own replication. The protein binds to the viral ori leading to origin unwinding. Cellular replication proteins are then recruited to the ori, and the viral DNA is replicated.

DnaB-like family: dnaB (E. coli, replication), gp41 (bacteriophage T4, DNA replication), T7gp4 (bacteriophage T7, DNA replication).

Rho-like family: Rho (E. coli, transcription termination).
Note that these superfamilies do not subsume all possible helicases. For example, XPB and ERCC2 are helicases not included in any of the above families.

'''RNA Helicases'''
RNA Helicases and DNA Helicases can be found together in all the Helicase Super Families except for SF6.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;RNA Helicases&quot; Edited by Eckhard Jankowsky, RSC Publishing 2010&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all RNA Helicases exhibit helicase activity as defined by enzymatic function, i.e., proteins of the Swi/Snf family. Although these proteins carry the typical helicase motifs, hydrolize ATP in a nucleic acid-dependent manner, and are built around a helicase core, in general, no unwinding activity is observed.&lt;ref&gt;Trends Biochem Sci. 2010 Aug 31.  [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20813532 RNA helicases at work: binding and rearranging]. Jankowsky E.  Center for RNA Molecular Biology &amp; Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, 10900 Euclid Ave., Cleveland, OH 44106, USA&lt;/ref&gt;

RNA Helicases that do exhibit unwinding activity have been characterized by at least two different mechanisms: canonical duplex unwinding and local strand separation. Canonical duplex unwinding is the stepwise directional separation of a duplex strand, as described above, for DNA unwinding. However, local strand separation occurs by a process wherein the helicase enzyme is loaded at any place along the duplex. This is usually aided by a single-stranded region of the RNA, and the loading of the enzyme is accompanied with ATP binding.&lt;ref&gt;Yang et al., DEAD-box proteins unwind duplexes by local strand separation, Mol. Cell 28 (2007), pp. 253–263&lt;/ref&gt; Once the helicase and ATP are bound, local strand separation occurs, which requires binding of ATP but not the actual process of ATP hydrolysis.&lt;ref&gt;. Liu et al., ATP hydrolysis is required for DEAD-box protein recycling but not for duplex unwinding, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 105 (2008), pp. 20209–20214&lt;/ref&gt; Presented with fewer base pairs the duplex then dissociates without further assistance from the enzyme. This mode of unwinding is used by DEAD-box helicases.&lt;ref&gt;Jarmoskaite, I. and Russell, R., (2010) DEAD-box proteins as RNA helicases and chaperones. WIREs: RNA, in press.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Topoisomerase'''

Topoisomerases are enzymes that unwind and wind DNA, in order for DNA to control the synthesis of proteins, and to facilitate DNA replication. 
The double-helical configuration that DNA strands naturally reside in makes them difficult to separate, and yet they must be separated by helicase proteins if other enzymes are to transcribe the sequences that encode proteins, or if chromosomes are to be replicated. In so-called circular DNA, in which double helical DNA is bent around and joined in a circle, the two strands are topologically linked, or knotted. Otherwise, identical loops of DNA having different numbers of twists are topoisomers, and cannot be interconverted by any process that does not involve the breaking of DNA strands. Topoisomerases catalyze and guide the unknotting or unkinking of DNA[3] by creating transient breaks in the DNA using a conserved Tyrosine as the catalytic residue.
The insertion of viral DNA into chromosomes and other forms of recombination can also require the action of topoisomerases.

Topoisomerases can fix these topological problems and are separated into two types separated by the number of strands cut in one round of action:&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid1849888&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Wang JC | title = DNA topoisomerases: why so many? | journal = J. Biol. Chem. | volume = 266 | issue = 11 | pages = 6659–62 | year = 1991 | month = April | pmid = 1849888 | doi = | url = http://www.jbc.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=1849888 | issn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both these classes of enzyme utilize a conserved tyrosine.  However these enzymes are structurally and mechanistically different. 

* [[Type I topoisomerase]] cuts one strand of a DNA double helix, relaxation occurs, and then the cut strand is reannealed.  Cutting one strand allows the part of the molecule on one side of the cut to rotate around the uncut strand, thereby reducing stress from too much or too little twist in the helix.  Such stress is introduced when the DNA strand is &quot;supercoiled&quot; or uncoiled to or from higher orders of coiling.  Type I topoisomerases are subdivided into two subclasses: type IA topoisomerases, which share many structural and mechanistic features with the type II topoisomerases, and type IB topoisomerases, which utilize a controlled rotary mechanism.  Examples of type IA topoisomerases include topo I and topo III.  In the past, type IB topoisomerases were referred to as eukaryotic topo I, but IB topoisomerases are present in all three domains of life.  It is interesting to note that type IA topoisomerases form a covalent intermediate with the 5' end of DNA, while the IB topoisomerases form a covalent intermediate with the 3' end of DNA.  Recently, a type IC topoisomerase has been identified, called topo V. While it is structurally unique from type IA and IB topoisomerases, it shares a similar mechanism with type IB topoisomerase.

* [[Type II topoisomerase]] cuts both strands of one DNA double helix, passes another unbroken DNA helix through it, and then reanneals the cut strand.  It is also split into two subclasses: type IIA and type IIB topoisomerases, which share similar structure and mechanisms.  Examples of type IIA topoisomerases include eukaryotic topo II, E. coli gyrase, and E. coli topo IV.  Examples of type IIB topoisomerase include topo VI.

Both type I and type II topoisomerases change the linking number (L) of DNA.  Type IA topoisomerases change the linking number by one, type IB and type IC topoisomerases change the linking number by any integer, while type IIA and type IIB topoisomerases change the linking number by two.

Many drugs operate through interference with the topoisomerases. The broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone antibiotics act by disrupting the function of bacterial type II topoisomerases.
Some chemotherapy drugs work by interfering with topoisomerases in cancer cells:
type 1 is inhibited by irinotecan and topotecan.
type 2 is inhibited by etoposide (VP-16), teniposide and HU-331, a quinolone synthesized from cannabidiol.
Topoisomerase I is the antigen recognized by Anti Scl-70 antibodies in scleroderma.
These small molecule inhibitors act as efficient anti-bacterial and anti-cancer agents by hijacking the natural ability of topoisomerase to create breaks in chromosomal DNA. These breaks in DNA accumulate, ultimately leading to programmed cell death, or apoptosis.

==Replication in Eukaryote==
[[Image:DNA polymerase.png|thumb|3D structure of the DNA-binding [[helix-turn-helix]] motifs in human DNA polymerase beta]]
[[Image:pre-RC.png|thumb|350px|Pre-RC assembly involves the  assembly of the ORC subunits, Cdc6 and Cdt1 and the Mcm2-7 complex]]
DNA replication in eukaryotes is much more complicated than in prokaryotes, although there are many similar aspects. Eukaryotic cells can only initiate DNA replication at a specific point in the cell cycle, the beginning of '''S phase'''.

DNA replication in eukaryotes occurs only in the S phase of the cell cycle. However, pre-initiation occurs in the G1 phase. Thus, the separation of pre-initiation and activation ensures that the origin can only fire once per cell cycle.
Due to the sheer size of chromosomes in eukaryotes, eukaryotic chromosomes contain '''multiple origins of replication'''. Some origins are well characterized, such as the '''autonomously replicating sequences (ARS)''' of yeast while other eukaryotic origins, particularly those in metazoa, can be found in spans of thousands of basepairs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eukaryotic_DNA_replication Eukaryotic DNA replication]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eukaryotic DNA polymerase===

There are at least 15 known Eukaryotic DNA polymerase:

POLA1, POLA2: Pol α (also called RNA primase): forms a complex with a small catalytic (PriS) and a large noncatalytic (PriL) subunit, with the Pri subunits acting as a primase (synthesizing an RNA primer), and then with DNA Pol α elongating that primer with DNA nucleotides. After around 20 nucleotides[3] elongation is taken over by Pol ε (on the leading strand) and δ (on the lagging strand).

POLB: Pol β: Implicated in repairing DNA, in base excision repair and gap-filling synthesis.

POLG, POLG2: Pol γ: Replicates and repairs mitochondrial DNA and has proofreading 3'-&gt;5' exonuclease activity.

POLD1, POLD2, POLD3, POLD4: Pol δ: Highly processive and has proofreading 3'-&gt;5' exonuclease activity. Thought to be the main polymerase involved in lagging strand synthesis, though there is still debate about its role.

POLE, POLE2, POLE3: Pol ε: Also highly processive and has proofreading 3'-&gt;5' exonuclease activity. Highly related to pol δ, and thought to be the main polymerase involved in leading strand synthesis[5], though there is again still debate about its role.

POLH, POLI, POLK, : η, ι, κ, and Rev1 are Y-family DNA polymerases and Pol ζ is a B-family DNA polymerase. These polymerases are involved in the bypass of DNA damage.

There are also other eukaryotic polymerases known, which are not as well characterized:
POLQ: 'θ
POLL: λ
φ
σ
POLM: μ
None of the eukaryotic polymerases can remove primers (5'-&gt;3' exonuclease activity); that function is carried out by other enzymes. Only the polymerases that deal with the elongation (γ, δ and ε) have proofreading ability (3'-&gt;5' exonuclease).



''Preparation in G1 phase''

The first step in DNA replication is the formation of the pre-initiation replication complex (the pre-RC). The formation of this complex occurs in two stages. The first stage requires that there is no CDK activity. This can only occur in early G1. The formation of the pre-RC is known as licensing, but a licensed pre-RC cannot initiate replication in the 
''G1 phase''
Current models hold that it begins with the binding of the origin recognition complex (ORC) to the origin. This complex is a hexamer of related proteins and remains bound to the origin, even after DNA replication occurs. Furthermore, ORC is the functional analogue of prokaryotic DnaA. Following the binding of ORC to the origin, Cdc6/Cdc18 and Cdt1 coordinate the loading of the MCM (Mini Chromosome Maintenance) complex to the origin by first binding to ORC and then binding to the MCM complex. The MCM complex is thought to be the major DNA helicase in eukaryotic organisms. Once binding of MCM occurs, a fully licensed pre-RC exists.

===DNA Replication occurs during the S phase===
Activation of the complex occurs in S-phase and requires Cdk2-Cyclin E and Ddk. The activation process begins with the addition of Mcm10 to the pre-RC, which displaces Cdt1. Following this, Ddk phosphorylates Mcm3-7, which activates the helicase. It is believed that ORC and Cdc6/18 are phosphorylated by Cdk2-Cyclin E. Ddk and the Cdk complex then recruits another protein called Cdc45, which then recruits all of the DNA replication proteins to the replication fork. At this stage the origin fires and DNA synthesis begins.
Activation of a new round of replication is prevented through the actions of the cyclin dependent kinases and a protein known as geminin. Geminin binds to Cdt1 and sequesters it. It is a periodic protein that first appears in S-phase and is degraded in late M-phase, possibly through the action of the anaphase promoting complex (APC). In addition, phosphorylation of Cdc6/18 prevent it from binding to the ORC (thus inhibiting loading of the MCM complex) while the phosphorylation of ORC remains unclear. Cells in the G0 stage of the cell cycle are prevented from initiating a round of replication because the Mcm proteins are not expressed.

At least three different types of eukaryotic DNA polymerases are involved in the replication of DNA in animal cells (POL α, Pol δ and POL ε).

Pol α forms a complex with a small catalytic (PriS) and a large noncatalytic (PriL) subunit, with the Pri subunits acting as a primase (synthesizing an RNA primer), and then with DNA Pol α elongating that primer with DNA nucleotides. After around 20 nucleotides elongation is taken over by Pol ε (on the leading strand) and δ (on the lagging strand).

Pol δ: Highly processive and has proofreading 3'-&gt;5' exonuclease activity. Thought to be the main polymerase involved in leading strand synthesis, though there is still debate about its role.

Pol ε: Also highly processive and has proofreading 3'-&gt;5' exonuclease activity. Highly related to pol δ, and thought to be the main polymerase involved in lagging strand synthesis, though there is again still debate about its role&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Eukaryotic_DNA_replication&amp;oldid=423827289&lt;/ref&gt;.
[[Image:Mitochondrial DNA en.svg|thumb|400px|right|Mitochondrial DNA.]]

==Replication in mitochondria==

Nuclear and mitochondrial DNA are thought to be of separate evolutionary origin, with the mtDNA being derived from the circular genomes of the bacteria that were engulfed by the early ancestors of today's eukaryotic cells. This theory is called the endosymbiotic theory. Each mitochondrion is estimated to contain 2-10 mtDNA copies. In the cells of extant organisms, the vast majority of the proteins present in the mitochondria (numbering approximately 1500 different types in mammals) are coded for by nuclear DNA, but the genes for some of them, if not most, are thought to have originally been of bacterial origin, having since been transferred to the eukaryotic nucleus during evolution.

mtDNA is replicated by the DNA polymerase gamma complex which is composed of a 140 kDa catalytic DNA polymerase encoded by the POLG gene and a 55 kDa accessory subunit encoded by the POLG2 gene. During embryogenesis, replication of mtDNA is strictly down-regulated from the fertilized oocyte through the preimplantation embryo. At the blastocyst stage, the onset of mtDNA replication is specific to the cells of the trophectoderm. In contrast, the cells of the inner cell mass restrict mtDNA replication until they receive the signals to differentiate to specific cell types.
D-loop replication is a process by which chloroplasts and mitochondria replicate their genetic material. An important component of understanding D-loop replication is that chloroplasts and mitochondria have a single circular chromosome like bacteria instead of the linear chromosomes found in eukaryotes.
In many organisms, one strand of DNA in the plastid comprises heavier nucleotides (relatively more purines: adenine and guanine). This strand is called the H (heavy) strand. The L (light) strand comprises lighter nucleotides (pyrimidines: thymine and cytosine). Replication begins with replication of the heavy strand starting at the D-loop (also known as the control region). An origin of replication opens, and the heavy strand is replicated in one direction. After heavy strand replication has continued for some time, a new light strand is also synthesized, through the opening of another origin of replication. When diagramed, the resulting structure looks like the letter D.
The D-loop region is important for phylogeographic studies. Because the region does not code for any genes, it is free to vary with only a few selective limitations on size and heavy/light strand factors. The mutation rate is among the fastest of anywhere in either the nuclear or mitochondrial genomes in animals. Mutations in the D-loop can effectively track recent and rapid evolutionary changes such as within species and among very closely related species.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrial_DNA Mitochondrial DNA]&lt;/ref&gt;

Repeated sequences in DNA. &lt;ref&gt;Science 161: 529-540.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it wasn't until the breakthrough DNA reassociation kinetics experiments of Britten and his colleagues that it was shown that not all DNA coded for genes. In fact, their experiments demonstrated that the majority of eukaryotic genomic DNA is composed of repetitive, non-coding elements.
The amount of single and double-stranded DNA is measured by rapidly diluting the sample, which slows reassociation, and then binding the DNA to a hydroxylapatite column. The column is first washed with a low concentration of sodium phosphate buffer, which elutes the single-stranded DNA, and then with high concentrations of phosphate, which elutes the double stranded DNA. The amount of DNA in these two solutions is then measured using a spectrophotometer.
Since a sequence of single-stranded DNA needs to find its complementary strand to reform a double helix, common sequences renature more rapidly than rare sequences. Indeed, the rate at which a sequence will reassociate is proportional to the number of copies of that sequence in the DNA sample. A sample with a highly-repetitive sequence will renature rapidly, while complex sequences will renature slowly.
However, instead of simply measuring the percentage of double-stranded DNA versus time, the amount of renaturation is measured relative to a C0t value. The C0t value is the product of C0 (the initial concentration of DNA), t (time in seconds), and a constant that depends on the concentration of cations in the buffer. Repetitive DNA will renature at low C0t values, while complex and unique DNA sequences will renature at high C0t values.

==DNA repair==
DNA damage, due to environmental factors and normal metabolic processes inside the cell, occurs at a rate of 1,000 to 1,000,000 molecular lesions per cell per day. While this constitutes only 0.000165% of the human genome's approximately 6 billion bases '''(3 billion base pairs)''', unrepaired lesions in critical genes (such as tumor suppressor genes) can impede a cell's ability to carry out its function and appreciably increase the likelihood of tumor formation.

The vast majority of DNA damage affects the primary structure of the double helix; that is, the bases themselves are chemically modified. These modifications can in turn disrupt the molecules' regular helical structure by introducing non-native chemical bonds or bulky adducts that do not fit in the standard double helix. Unlike proteins and RNA, DNA usually lacks tertiary structure and therefore damage or disturbance does not occur at that level. DNA is, however, supercoiled and wound around &quot;packaging&quot; proteins called histones (in eukaryotes), and both superstructures are vulnerable to the effects of DNA damage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_repair DNA repair]&lt;/ref&gt;
===Types of DNA damage===
[[Image:direct DNA damage.png|thumb|right|500px| Direct DNA damage: The UV-photon is directly absorbed by the DNA (left). One of the possible reactions from the excited state is the formation of a thymine-thymine cyclobutane dimer (right). The direct DNA damage leads to sunburn, causing an increase in melanin production, thereby leading to a long-lasting tan. However, it is responsible for only 8% of all melanoma.]]
There are five main types of damage to DNA due to endogenous cellular processes: (1) oxidation of bases [e.g. 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxoG)] and generation of DNA strand interruptions from reactive oxygen species; (2) alkylation of bases (usually methylation), such as formation of 7-methylguanine, 1-methyladenine, 6-O-Methylguanine; (3) hydrolysis of bases, such as deamination, depurination, and depyrimidination; (4) &quot;bulky adduct formation&quot; (i.e., benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide-dG adduct); (5) mismatch of bases, due to errors in DNA replication, in which the wrong DNA base is stitched into place in a newly forming DNA strand, or a DNA base is skipped over or mistakenly inserted.  '''Damage caused by exogenous agents''' Damage caused by exogenous agents comes in many forms. Some examples are described below.

UV-B light causes crosslinking between adjacent cytosine and thymine bases creating '''pyrimidine dimers'''. This is called direct DNA damage.

UV-A light creates mostly free radicals. The damage caused by free radicals is called indirect DNA damage.

Ionizing radiation such as that created by radioactive decay or in cosmic rays causes breaks in DNA strands. Low-level ionizing radiation may induce irreparable DNA damage (leading to replicational and transcriptional errors needed for neoplasia or may trigger viral interactions) leading to pre-mature aging and cancer.

Thermal disruption at elevated temperature increases the rate of depurination (loss of purine bases from the DNA backbone) and single-strand breaks. For example, hydrolytic depurination is seen in the thermophilic bacteria, which grow in hot springs at 40-80 °C. The rate of depurination (300 purine residues per genome per generation) is too high in these species to be repaired by normal repair machinery, hence a possibility of an adaptive response cannot be ruled out.

Industrial chemicals also play very important role in DNA damage, such as vinyl chloride and hydrogen peroxide, and environmental chemicals such as polycyclic hydrocarbons found in smoke, soot and tar create a huge diversity of DNA adducts- ethenobases, oxidized bases, alkylated phosphotriesters and Crosslinking of DNA just to name a few.
'''UV damage, alkylation/methylation, X-ray damage and oxidative damage are examples of induced damage'''. Spontaneous damage can include the loss of a base, deamination, sugar ring puckering and tautomeric shift.

===Sources of damage===
DNA damage can be subdivided into '''two''' main types:

'''Endogenous''' damage such as attack by reactive oxygen species produced from normal metabolic byproducts, especially the process of oxidative deamination, and this also includes base mismatches due to replication errors

'''Exogenous damage''' caused by external agents such as

ultraviolet [UV 200-300nm] radiation from the sun

other radiation frequencies, including x-rays and gamma rays

hydrolysis or thermal disruption

certain plant toxins

human-made mutagenic chemicals, especially aromatic compounds that act as DNA intercalating agents

cancer chemotherapy and radiotherapy

viruses

===Types of mutation===

When DNA damages are repaired this can sometimes give rise to a simple one base-pair mutation, described here.  (Deletions and translocations can also arise during repair)

'''Transition''' In molecular biology, a transition is a point mutation that changes a purine nucleotide to another purine (A ↔ G) or a pyrimidine nucleotide to another pyrimidine (C ↔ T). Approximately two out of three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are transitions.
Transitions can be caused by oxidative deamination and tautomerization. Although there are twice as many possible transversions, transitions appear more often in genomes, possibly due to the molecular mechanisms that generate them.
5-Methylcytosine is more prone to transition than unmethylated cytosine, due to spontaneous deamination. This mechanism is important because it dictates the rarity of CpG islands.

'''Transversion''' In molecular biology, transversion refers to the substitution of a purine for a pyrimidine or vice versa. It can only be reverted by a spontaneous reversion. Because this type of mutation changes the chemical structure dramatically, the consequences of this change tend to be more severe and less common than that of transitions. Transversions can be caused by ionizing radiation and alkylating agents.

==DNA repair and disorders==
Defects in the NER mechanism are responsible for squally several genetic disorders, including:

'''Xeroderma pigmentosum:''' hypersensitivity to sunlight/UV, resulting in increased skin cancer incidence and premature aging

'''Cockayne syndrome:''' hypersensitivity to UV and chemical agents

'''Trichothiodystrophy:''' sensitive skin, brittle hair and nails
Mental retardation often accompanies the latter two disorders, suggesting increased vulnerability of developmental neurons.

Other DNA repair disorders include:

'''Werner's syndrome:''' premature aging and retarded growth

'''Bloom's syndrome:''' sunlight hypersensitivity, high incidence of malignancies (especially leukemias).

'''Ataxia telangiectasia:''' sensitivity to ionizing radiation and some chemical agents

All of the above diseases are often called '''&quot;segmental progerias&quot;''' (&quot;accelerated aging diseases&quot;) because their victims appear elderly and suffer from aging-related diseases at an abnormally young age, while not manifesting all the symptoms of old age.

Other diseases associated with reduced DNA repair function include '''Fanconi's anemia''', hereditary breast cancer and hereditary colon cancer.

==Human Chromosome and Chromosomal aberrations ==
Chromosomes can be divided into two types—autosomes, and sex chromosomes. Certain genetic traits are linked to your sex, and are passed on through the sex chromosomes. The autosomes contain the rest of the genetic hereditary information. All act in the same way during cell division. Human cells have 23 pairs of large linear nuclear chromosomes, (22 pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes) giving a total of 46 per cell. In addition to these, human cells have many hundreds of copies of the mitochondrial genome. Sequencing of the human genome has provided a great deal of information about each of the chromosomes. Below is a table compiling statistics for the chromosomes, based on the Sanger Institute's human genome information in the Vertebrate Genome Annotation (VEGA) database. Number of genes is an estimate as it is in part based on gene predictions. Total chromosome length is an estimate as well, based on the estimated size of unsequenced heterochromatin regions.

Chromosomal aberrations are disruptions in the normal chromosomal content of a cell and are a major cause of genetic conditions in humans, such as [[Down syndrome]]. Some chromosome abnormalities do not cause disease in carriers, such as [[translocations]], or [[chromosomal inversions]], although they may lead to a higher chance of birthing a child with a chromosome disorder. Abnormal numbers of chromosomes or chromosome sets, [[aneuploidy]], may be lethal or give rise to genetic disorders. [[Genetic counseling]] is offered for families that may carry a chromosome rearrangement.

The gain or loss of DNA from chromosomes can lead to a variety of [[genetic disorders]]. Human examples include:
* [[Cri du chat]], which is caused by the [[Genetic deletion|deletion]] of part of the short arm of chromosome 5. &quot;Cri du chat&quot; means &quot;cry of the cat&quot; in French, and the condition was so-named because affected babies make high-pitched cries that sound like those of a cat. Affected individuals have wide-set eyes, a small head and jaw, moderate to severe mental health issues, and are very short.
* [[Down syndrome]], usually is caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21 ([[trisomy 21]]). Characteristics include decreased muscle tone, stockier build, asymmetrical skull, slanting eyes and mild to moderate developmental disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Kenneth R.|title=Biology|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey|year=2000|edition=5th |pages=194–5|chapter=9-3|isbn=0-13-436265-9|accessdate=2008-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Edwards syndrome]], which is the second-most-common trisomy; Down syndrome is the most common. It is a trisomy of chromosome 18. Symptoms include motor retardation, developmental disability and numerous congenital anomalies causing serious health problems. Ninety percent die in infancy; however, those that live past their first birthday usually are quite healthy thereafter. They have a characteristic clenched hands and overlapping fingers.
* [[Idic15]], abbreviation for Isodicentric 15 on chromosome 15; also called the following names due to various researches, but they all mean the same; IDIC(15), Inverted duplication 15, extra Marker, Inv dup 15, partial tetrasomy 15
* [[Jacobsen syndrome]], also called the terminal 11q deletion disorder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.11q.org European Chromosome 11 Network&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; This is a very rare disorder. Those affected have normal intelligence or mild developmental disability, with poor expressive language skills. Most have a bleeding disorder called [[Paris-Trousseau syndrome]].
* [[Klinefelter's syndrome]] (XXY). Men with Klinefelter syndrome are usually sterile, and tend to have longer arms and legs and to be taller than their peers. Boys with the syndrome are often shy and quiet, and have a higher incidence of speech delay and [[dyslexia]]. During puberty, without testosterone treatment, some of them may develop [[gynecomastia]].
* [[Patau Syndrome]], also called D-Syndrome or trisomy-13. Symptoms are somewhat similar to those of trisomy-18, but they do not have the characteristic hand shape.
* [[Small supernumerary marker chromosome]]. This means there is an extra, abnormal chromosome. Features depend on the origin of the extra genetic material. [[Cat-eye syndrome]] and [[Isodicentric 15|isodicentric chromosome 15 syndrome]] (or Idic15) are both caused by a supernumerary marker chromosome, as is [[Pallister-Killian syndrome]].
* [[Triple-X syndrome]] (XXX). XXX girls tend to be tall and thin. They have a higher incidence of dyslexia.
* [[Turner syndrome]] (X instead of XX or XY). In Turner syndrome, female sexual characteristics are present but underdeveloped. People with Turner syndrome often have a short stature, low hairline, abnormal eye features and bone development and a &quot;caved-in&quot; appearance to the chest.
* [[XYY syndrome]]. XYY boys are usually taller than their siblings. Like XXY boys and XXX girls, they are somewhat more likely to have learning difficulties.
* [[Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome]], which is caused by partial deletion of the short arm of chromosome 4. It is characterized by severe growth retardation and severe to profound mental health issues.

Chromosomal mutations produce changes in whole chromosomes (more than one gene) or in the number of chromosomes present.
* Deletion&amp;nbsp;– loss of part of a chromosome
* Duplication&amp;nbsp;– extra copies of a part of a chromosome
* Inversion&amp;nbsp;– reverse the direction of a part of a chromosome
* Translocation&amp;nbsp;– part of a chromosome breaks off and attaches to another chromosome
Most mutations are neutral&amp;nbsp;– have little or no effect. Chromosomal aberrations are the changes in the structure of chromosomes. It has a great role in evolution. A detailed graphical display of all human chromosomes and the diseases annotated at the correct spot may be found at the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ornl.gov/hgmis/posters/chromosome/ ORNL.gov&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;], Exploring Genes &amp; Genetic Disorders&lt;/ref&gt;

==DNA Recombination==
[[Image:Morgan crossover 1.jpg|thumb|200px|Thomas Hunt Morgan's illustration of crossing over (1916)]]
[[Image:Morgan crossover 2.jpg||thumb|200px|A double crossing over]]
[[File:Homologous Recombination.jpg|thumb|400px|A current model of meiotic recombination, initiated by a double-strand break or gap, followed by pairing with an homologous chromosome and strand invasion to initiate the recombinational repair process. Repair of the gap can lead to crossover (CO) or non-crossover (NCO) of the flanking regions. CO recombination is thought to occur by the Double Holliday Junction (DHJ) model, illustrated on the right, above. NCO recombinants are thought to occur primarily by the Synthesis Dependent Strand Annealing (SDSA) model, illustrated on the left, above. Most recombination events appear to be the SDSA type.]]
Recombination is a process by which a molecule of nucleic acid (usually DNA, but can also be RNA) is broken and then joined to a different one (or in which genetic information is exchanged between two such molecules). Recombination ordinarily occurs between similar molecules of DNA, as in homologous recombination. Recombination is a common method of DNA repair in both bacteria and eukaryotes. In eukaryotes, recombination also occurs in meiosis, where it facilitates informational exchange and/or chromosomal crossover. The crossover process leads to offspring's having different combinations of genes from those of their parents, and can occasionally produce new chimeric alleles. In organisms with an adaptive immune system, a type of genetic recombination called V(D)J recombination helps immune cells rapidly diversify to recognize and adapt to new pathogens. The shuffling of genes brought about by genetic recombination can have long term advantages, as it is a major engine of genetic variation and also allows sexually reproducing organisms to avoid Muller's ratchet, in which the genomes of an asexual population accumulate deleterious mutations in an irreversible manner.
In genetic engineering, recombination can also refer to artificial and deliberate recombination of disparate pieces of DNA, often from different organisms, creating what is called recombinant DNA. A prime example of such a use of genetic recombination is gene targeting, which can be used to add, delete or otherwise change an organism's genes. This technique is important to biomedical researchers as it allows them to study the effects of specific genes. Techniques based on genetic recombination are also applied in protein engineering to develop new proteins of biological interest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_recombination Genetic recombination]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Chromosomal crossover'' in eukaryotes is an exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes. It can occur in one of the final phases of genetic recombination, which occurs during prophase I of meiosis (pachytene). The pairing of homologous chromsomes during meiosis (synapsis) begins before the synaptonemal complex develops, and is not completed until near the end of prophase I. Crossover usually occurs when matching regions on matching chromosomes break and then reconnect to the other chromosome.
Crossing over was described, in theory, by Thomas Hunt Morgan. He relied on the discovery of the Belgian Professor Frans Alfons Janssens of the University of Leuven who described the phenomenon in 1909 and had called it 'chiasmatypie'. The term chiasma is linked if not identical to chromosomal crossover. Morgan immediately saw the great importance of Janssens' cytological interpretation of chiasmata to the experimental results of his research on the heredity of Drosophila. The physical basis of crossing over was first demonstrated by Harriet Creighton and Barbara McClintock in 1931.

'''Meiotic recombination''' can be initiated by double-stranded breaks that can be introduced into the DNA by the Spo11 protein. In addition, meiotic recombination can be induced in response to spontaneous double strand breaks, possibly caused by reactive oxygen species, carried over from the prior round of synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;Carofiglio F, Inagaki A, de Vries S, Wassenaar E, Schoenmakers S, Vermeulen C, van Cappellen WA, Sleddens-Linkels E, Grootegoed JA, Te Riele HP, de Massy B, Baarends WM. (2013). SPO11-independent DNA repair foci and their role in meiotic silencing.PLoS Genet. 9(6):e1003538. doi: 10.1371/journal.pgen.1003538. PMID: 23754961&lt;/ref&gt;  One or more exonucleases then digest the 5’ ends generated by the double-stranded breaks to produce 3’ single-stranded DNA tails (see lowest Figure in this section). The meiosis-specific recombinase Dmc1 and the general recombinase Rad51 coat the single-stranded DNA to form nucleoprotein filaments.The recombinases catalyze invasion of the opposite chromatid by the single-stranded DNA from one end of the break. Next, the 3’ end of the invading DNA primes DNA synthesis, causing displacement of the complementary strand.  

'''Crossover recombinants''' are generated by a process in which the displaced complementary strand subsequently anneals to the single-stranded DNA generated from the other end of the initial double-stranded break (see DHJ pathway on the Figure). The structure that results is a cross-strand exchange, also known as a Holliday junction. The contact between two chromatids that will soon undergo crossing-over is known as a chiasma. The Holliday junction is a tetrahedral structure which can be 'pulled' by other recombinases, moving it along the four-stranded structure (see Double Holliday Junction or DHJ in the Figure).

'''Gene conversion''' can result from the repair of a double strand break.  Gene conversion involves the unidirectional transfer of genetic sequence information from a 'donor' sequence to a highly homologous 'acceptor' chromosome.  Gene conversion usually occurs by Synthesis Dependent Strand Annealing (SDSA)&lt;ref name=Allers&gt; Allers T, Lichten M. (2001). Differential timing and control of noncrossover and crossover recombination during meiosis. Cell 106(1):47-57. PMID: 11461701&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; McMahill MS, Sham CW, Bishop DK. (2007). Synthesis-dependent strand annealing in meiosis. PLoS Biol. 5(11):e299. PMID:17988174 PMCID: PMC2062477.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Andersen&gt;Andersen SL, Sekelsky J. (2010). Meiotic versus mitotic recombination: two different routes for double-strand break repair: the different functions of meiotic versus mitotic DSB repair are reflected in different pathway usage and different outcomes. Bioessays. 32(12);1058-66. doi: 10.1002/bies.201000087. Review. PMID: 20967781&lt;/ref&gt; illustrated in the lowest Figure in this section.  In this model of SDSA DNA repair, a free strand of DNA from the end of a double strand break invades an homologous chromosome, extending itself by replication along the sequence on the complementary strand of DNA of the ‘donor’ chromosome.  The extended strand is then retracted from the donor chromosome and pairs with the complementary sequence on the recipient chromosome in a region at the other end of the double strand break (needing about 25 to 50 base pairs of homology).&lt;ref name=Allers /&gt;  This allows completion of healing of the double strand break by replication, to complete the duplex structure on the recipient chromosome, from information on the extended strand copied from the donor chromosome.  The usual length of a gene conversion tract in mammals is between 200 to 1,000 base pairs.&lt;ref&gt; Chen JM, Cooper DN, Chuzhanova N, Férec C, Patrinos GP. (2007) Gene conversion: mechanisms, evolution and human disease. Nat Rev Genet 8(10);762-75. Review. PMID: 17846636&lt;/ref&gt;

During meiosis, gene conversion is most often associated with non-crossover of outside regions (e.g. the SDSA pathway shown in the Figure).  Less frequently, gene conversion during meiosis is associated with crossover of outside regions and these events are usually generated by the DHJ pathway.  Gene conversion without crossover occurs more frequently than crossover recombination during meiosis in many organisms, often by about a 2 to 1 ratio.&lt;ref name=Whitehouse&gt;Whitehouse, HLK. Genetic Recombination.(see Table 38) New York: Wiley; 1982. ISBN-10: 0471102059  ISBN-13: 978-0471102052&lt;/ref&gt;  During mitosis, gene conversion is almost the exclusive mode of double strand break repair by homologous recombination.&lt;ref name=Andersen /&gt;  

Studies of gene conversion have contributed to our understanding of the adaptive function of meiotic recombination.  Since gene conversion in most species studied is more frequently of the non-crossover type,&lt;ref name=Whitehouse /&gt; explanations for the adaptive function of meiotic recombination that focus exclusively on the adaptive benefit of producing new genetic variation seem inadequate to explain the majority of recombination events during meiosis.  However, the majority of meiotic recombination events can be explained by the proposal that they are an adaptation for repair of damages in the DNA that is to be passed on to gametes.&lt;ref&gt;Hörandl E. (2013). Meiosis and the Paradox of Sex in Nature, Meiosis, Dr. Carol Bernstein (Ed.), ISBN: 978-953-51-1197-9, InTech, DOI: 10.5772/56542. Available from: http://www.intechopen.com/books/meiosis/meiosis-and-the-paradox-of-sex-in-nature&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein H, BernsteinC and Michod RE.  (2011). Meiosis as an Evolutionary Adaptation for DNA Repair. Chapter 19 in DNA Repair. Inna Kruman editor. InTech Open Publisher. DOI: 10.5772/25117 http://www.intechopen.com/books/dna-repair/meiosis-as-an-evolutionary-adaptation-for-dna-repair&lt;/ref&gt;

Genetic recombination is catalyzed by enzymes called recombinases. RecA, the chief recombinase found in Escherichia coli, is responsible for the repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). In yeast and other eukaryotic organisms there are two recombinases required for repairing DSBs. The RAD51 protein is employed in both mitotic and meiotic recombination, whereas the DMC1 protein is specific to meiotic recombination.

'''Nonhomologous recombination'''  Recombinational repair can infrequently occur between DNA sequences that contain no or little sequence homology. This is referred to as nonhomologous recombination.

== Software Engineer ==
Software engineering is done by the software engineer, an engineer who applies the principles of software engineering to the design, development, testing, and evaluation of software and systems that make computers or anything containing software work.  There has been some controversy over the term engineer&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Sayo|first=Mylene|title=[http://www.peo.on.ca/enforcement/June112002newsrelease.html What's in a Name? Tech Sector battles Engineers on &quot;software engineering&quot;]|url=http://www.peo.on.ca/enforcement/June112002newsrelease.html|accessdate=2008-07-24|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;, since it implies a certain level of academic training, professional discipline, adherence to formal processes, and especially legal liability that often are not applied in cases of software development.  In 2004, the U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics counted 760,840 software engineers holding jobs in the U.S.; in the same period there were some 1.4 million practitioners employed in the U.S. in all other engineering disciplines combined.&lt;ref&gt;Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor, [ftp://ftp.bls.gov/pub/news.release/ocwage.txt ''USDL 05-2145: Occupational Employment and Wages, November 2004'']&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Overview ===
Prior to the mid-1990s, software practitioners called themselves ''programmers'' or ''developers,'' regardless of their actual jobs. Many people prefer to call themselves ''software developer'' and ''programmer'', because most widely agree what these terms mean, while ''software engineer'' is still being debated. A prominent computing scientist, E. W. Dijkstra, wrote in a paper that the coining of the term ''software engineer'' was not a useful term since it was an inappropriate analogy, &quot;The existence of the mere term has been the base of a number of extremely shallow --and false-- analogies, which just confuse the issue...Computers are such exceptional gadgets that there is good reason to assume that most analogies with other disciplines are too shallow to be of any positive value, are even so shallow that they are only confusing.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD06xx/EWD690.html E.W.Dijkstra Archive: The pragmatic engineer versus the scientific designer&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''programmer'' has often been used to refer to those without the tools, skills, education, or ethics to write good quality software. In response, many practitioners called themselves ''software engineers'' to escape the stigma attached to the word programmer. 

The label software engineer is used very liberally in the corporate world. Very few of the practicing software engineers actually hold Engineering degrees from accredited universities. In fact, according to the Association for Computing Machinery, &quot;most people who now function in the U.S. as serious software engineers have degrees in computer science, not in software engineering&quot;. 
&lt;ref&gt;http://computingcareers.acm.org/?page_id=12 ACM, Computing - Degrees &amp; Careers, Software Engineering&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education ===
About half of all practitioners today have computer science degrees. A small, but growing, number of practitioners have software engineering degrees. In 1987 Imperial College London introduced the first three-year software engineering Bachelor's degree in the UK and the world.  Since then, software engineering undergraduate degrees have been established at many universities. A standard international curriculum for undergraduate software engineering degrees was recently defined by the ACM&lt;ref&gt;http://sites.computer.org/ccse/ Curriculum Guidelines for Undergraduate Degree Programs in Software Engineering&lt;/ref&gt;. As of 2004, in the U.S., about 50 universities offer software engineering degrees, which teach both computer science and engineering principles and practices.  ETS University and UQAM were mandated by IEEE to develop the SoftWare Engineering BOdy of Knowledge (SWEBOK) &lt;ref&gt;http://www.computer.org/portal/web/swebok Guide to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge&lt;/ref&gt;, which has become an ISO standard describing the body of knowledge covered by a software engineer.

In business, some software engineering practitioners have Management Information Systems (MIS) degrees. In embedded systems, some have electrical engineering or computer engineering degrees, because embedded software often requires a detailed understanding of hardware. In medical software, practitioners may have medical informatics, general medical, or biology degrees.  Some practitioners have mathematics, science, engineering, or technology degrees. Some have philosophy (logic in particular) or other non-technical degrees, and others have no degrees.

=== Profession ===
Most software engineers work as employees or contractors. They work with businesses, government agencies (civilian or military), and non-profit organizations. Some software engineers work for themselves as freelancers. Some organizations have specialists to perform each of the tasks in the software development process. Other organizations required software engineers to do many or all of them. In large projects, people may specialize in only one role. In small projects, people may fill several or all roles at the same time. 

There is considerable debate over the future employment prospects for Software Engineers and other Information Technology (IT) Professionals. For example, an online futures market called the Future of IT Jobs in America&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ideosphere.com/fx-bin/Claim?claim=ITJOBS Future of IT Jobs in America]&lt;/ref&gt; attempts to answer whether there will be more IT jobs, including software engineers, in 2012 than there were in 2002.

Some students in the developed world may have avoided degrees related to software engineering because of the fear of offshore outsourcing and of being displaced by foreign workers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computerworld.com/printthis/2006/0,4814,111202,00.html As outsourcing gathers steam, computer science interest wanes&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Although government statistics do not currently show a threat to software engineering itself; a related career, computer programming, does appear to have been affected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos110.htm#outlook Computer Programmers&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoworld.com/article/07/03/13/HNslowsoftdev_1.html Software developer growth slows in North America | InfoWorld | News | 2007-03-13 | By Robert Mullins, IDG News Service&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Some career counselors suggest a student to also focus on &quot;people skills&quot; and business skills rather than purely technical skills, because such &quot;soft skills&quot; are allegedly more difficult to offshore.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleTOC&amp;specialReportId=9000100&amp;articleId=112360 Hot Skills, Cold Skills&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It is the quasi-management aspects of software engineering that appear to be what has kept it from being impacted by globalization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://itmanagement.earthweb.com/career/article.php/3523066 Dual Roles: The Changing Face of IT&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''software development methodology''' or '''system development methodology''' in software engineering is a framework that is used to structure, plan, and control the process of developing an information system.

== History ==
The software development methodology framework didn't emerge until the 1960s. According to Elliott (2004) the systems development life cycle (SDLC) can be considered to be the oldest formalized methodology framework for building information systems. The main idea of the SDLC has been &quot;to pursue the development of information systems in a very deliberate, structured and methodical way, requiring each stage of the life cycle from inception of the idea to delivery of the final system, to be carried out in rigidly and sequentially&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ell04&quot;&gt;Geoffrey Elliott (2004) ''Global Business Information Technology: an integrated systems approach''. Pearson Education. p.87.&lt;/ref&gt; within the context of the framework being applied. The main target of this methodology framework in the 1960s was &quot;to develop large scale functional business systems in an age of large scale business conglomerates. Information systems activities revolved around heavy data processing and number crunching routines&quot;.&lt;ref name=Ell04/&gt;

=== As a noun ===
As a noun, a software development methodology is a framework that is used to structure, plan, and control the process of developing an information system - this includes the pre-definition of specific deliverables and artifacts that are created and completed by a project team to develop or maintain an application.&lt;ref name=&quot;CMS08&quot;&gt;Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) Office of Information Service (2008). ''[http://www.cms.hhs.gov/SystemLifecycleFramework/Downloads/SelectingDevelopmentApproach.pdf Selecting a development approach]''. Webarticle. United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Revalidated: March 27, 2008.  Retrieved 27 Oct 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Three software development patterns mashed together.svg|thumb|420px|The three basic approaches applied to software development methodology frameworks.]] A wide variety of such frameworks have evolved over the years, each with its own recognized strengths and weaknesses. One software development methodology framework is not necessarily suitable for use by all projects. Each of the available methodology frameworks are best suited to specific kinds of projects, based on various technical, organizational, project and team considerations.&lt;ref name=CMS08/&gt;

These software development frameworks are often bound to some kind of organization, which further develops, supports the use, and promotes the methodology framework. The methodology framework is often defined in some kind of formal documentation. Specific software development methodology frameworks (noun) include

* Rational Unified Process (RUP, IBM) since 1998.
* Agile Unified Process (AUP) since 2005 by Scott Ambler

=== As a verb ===
As a verb, the software development methodology is an approach used by organizations and project teams to apply the software development methodology framework (noun). Specific software development methodologies (verb) include:

;1970s
* Structured programming since 1969
* Cap Gemini SDM, originally from PANDATA, the first English translation was published in 1974. SDM stands for System Development Methodology
;1980s
* Structured Systems Analysis and Design Methodology (SSADM) from 1980 onwards
* Information Requirement Analysis/Soft systems methodology
;1990s
* Object-oriented programming (OOP) has been developed since the early 1960s, and developed as a dominant programming approach during the mid-1990s
* Rapid application development (RAD) since 1991
* Scrum, since the late 1990s
* Team software process developed by Watts Humphrey at the SEI
* Extreme Programming since 1999

== Verb approaches ==
Every software development methodology framework acts as a basis for applying specific approaches to develop and maintain software. Several software development approaches have been used since the origin of information technology. These are:&lt;ref name=CMS08/&gt;
* Waterfall: a linear framework
* Prototyping: an iterative framework
* Incremental: a combined linear-iterative framework
* Spiral: a combined linear-iterative framework
* Rapid application development (RAD): an iterative framework
* Extreme Programming

=== Waterfall development ===
The Waterfall model is a sequential development approach, in which development is seen as flowing steadily downwards (like a waterfall) through the phases of requirements analysis, design, implementation, testing (validation), integration, and maintenance. The first formal description of the method is often cited as an article published by Winston W. Royce&lt;ref&gt;[http://cartoon.iguw.tuwien.ac.at/fit/fit01/wasserfall/entstehung.html Wasserfallmodell &gt; Entstehungskontext], Markus Rerych, Institut für Gestaltungs- und Wirkungsforschung, TU-Wien. Accessed on line November 28, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1970 although Royce did not use the term &quot;waterfall&quot; in this article.

The basic principles are:&lt;ref name=CMS08/&gt;
* Project is divided into sequential phases, with some overlap and splashback acceptable between phases.
* Emphasis is on planning, time schedules, target dates, budgets and implementation of an entire system at one time.
* Tight control is maintained over the life of the project via extensive written documentation, formal reviews, and approval/signoff by the user and information technology management occurring at the end of most phases before beginning the next phase.

=== Prototyping ===
Software prototyping, is the development approach of activities during software development, the creation of prototypes, i.e., incomplete versions of the software program being developed.

The basic principles are:&lt;ref name=CMS08/&gt;
* Not a standalone, complete development methodology, but rather an approach to handling selected parts of a larger, more traditional development methodology (i.e. incremental, spiral, or rapid application development (RAD)).
* Attempts to reduce inherent project risk by breaking a project into smaller segments and providing more ease-of-change during the development process.
* User is involved throughout the development process, which increases the likelihood of user acceptance of the final implementation.
* Small-scale mock-ups of the system are developed following an iterative modification process until the prototype evolves to meet the users’ requirements.
* While most prototypes are developed with the expectation that they will be discarded, it is possible in some cases to evolve from prototype to working system.
* A basic understanding of the fundamental business problem is necessary to avoid solving the wrong problem.

=== Incremental development ===
Various methods are acceptable for combining linear and iterative systems development methodologies, with the primary objective of each being to reduce inherent project risk by breaking a project into smaller segments and providing more ease-of-change during the development process.

The basic principles are:&lt;ref name=CMS08/&gt;
* A series of mini-Waterfalls are performed, where all phases of the Waterfall are completed for a small part of a system, before proceeding to the next increment, or
* Overall requirements are defined before proceeding to evolutionary, mini-Waterfall development of individual increments of a system, or
* The initial software concept, requirements analysis, and design of architecture and system core are defined via Waterfall, followed by iterative Prototyping, which culminates in installing the final prototype, a working system.

=== Spiral development ===
[[Image:Software Development Spiral.svg|thumb|200px|The spiral model.]]
The spiral model is a software development process combining elements of both design and prototyping-in-stages, in an effort to combine advantages  of top-down and bottom-up concepts.

The basic principles are:&lt;ref name=CMS08/&gt;
* Focus is on risk assessment and on minimizing project risk by breaking a project into smaller segments and providing more ease-of-change during the development process, as well as providing the opportunity to evaluate risks and weigh consideration of project continuation throughout the life cycle.
* &quot;Each cycle involves a progression through the same sequence of steps, for each part of the product and for each of its levels of elaboration, from an overall concept-of-operation document down to the coding of each individual program.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;BB86&quot;&gt;Barry Boehm (1996., [http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/12944.12948 &quot;A Spiral Model of Software Development and Enhancement]&quot;. In: ''ACM SIGSOFT Software Engineering Notes'' (ACM) 11(4):14-24, August 1986&lt;/ref&gt;
* Each trip around the spiral traverses four basic quadrants: (1) determine objectives, alternatives, and constraints of the iteration; (2) evaluate alternatives; Identify and resolve risks; (3) develop and verify deliverables from the iteration; and (4) plan the next iteration.&lt;ref name=BB86/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard H. Thayer, Barry W. Boehm (1986). ''Tutorial: software engineering project management''. Computer Society Press of the IEEE. p.130&lt;/ref&gt;
* Begin each cycle with an identification of stakeholders and their win conditions, and end each cycle with review and commitment.&lt;ref&gt;Barry W. Boehm (2000). ''Software cost estimation with Cocomo II: Volume 1''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rapid application development ===
Rapid application development (RAD) is a software development methodology, which involves iterative development and the construction of prototypes. Rapid application development is a term originally used to describe a software development process introduced by James Martin in 1991.

The basic principles are:&lt;ref name=CMS08/&gt;
* Key objective is for fast development and delivery of a high quality system at a relatively low investment cost.
* Attempts to reduce inherent project risk by breaking a project into smaller segments and providing more ease-of-change during the development process.
* Aims to produce high quality systems quickly, primarily via iterative Prototyping (at any stage of development), active user involvement, and computerized development tools. These tools may include Graphical User Interface (GUI) builders, Computer Aided Software Engineering (CASE) tools, Database Management Systems (DBMS), fourth-generation programming languages, code generators, and object-oriented techniques.
* Key emphasis is on fulfilling the business need, while technological or engineering excellence is of lesser importance.
* Project control involves prioritizing development and defining delivery deadlines or “timeboxes”. If the project starts to slip, emphasis is on reducing requirements to fit the timebox, not in increasing the deadline.
* Generally includes joint application design (JAD), where users are intensely involved in system design, via consensus building in either structured workshops, or electronically facilitated interaction.
* Active user involvement is imperative.
* Iteratively produces production software, as opposed to a throwaway prototype.
* Produces documentation necessary to facilitate future development and maintenance.
* Standard systems analysis and design methods can be fitted into this framework.

=== Other practices ===
Other methodology practices include:
* Object-oriented development methodologies, such as Grady Booch's object-oriented design (OOD), also known as object-oriented analysis and design (OOAD). The Booch model includes six diagrams: class, object, state transition, interaction, module, and process.&lt;ref&gt;Georges Gauthier Merx &amp; Ronald J. Norman (2006). ''Unified Software Engineering with Java''. p.201.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Top-down programming: evolved in the 1970s by IBM researcher Harlan Mills (and Niklaus Wirth) in developed structured programming.
* Unified Process (UP) is an iterative software development methodology framework, based on Unified Modeling Language (UML). UP organizes the development of software into four phases, each consisting of one or more executable iterations of the software at that stage of development: inception, elaboration, construction, and guidelines. Many tools and products exist to facilitate UP implementation. One of the more popular versions of UP is the Rational Unified Process (RUP).
* Agile software development refers to a group of software development methodologies based on iterative development, where requirements and solutions evolve via collaboration between self-organizing cross-functional teams. The term was coined in the year 2001 when the Agile Manifesto was formulated.
* Integrated software development refers to a deliverable based software development framework using the three primary IT (project management, software development, software testing) life cycles that can be leveraged using multiple (iterative, waterfall, spiral, agile) software development approaches, where requirements and solutions evolve via collaboration between self-organizing cross-functional teams.

== Subtopics ==
=== View model ===
[[File:TEAF Matrix of Views and Perspectives.jpg|thumb|360px|The TEAF Matrix of Views and Perspectives.]]
A view model is framework which provides the viewpoints on the system and its environment, to be used in the software development process. It is a graphical representation of the underlying semantics of a view.

The purpose of viewpoints and views is to enable human engineers to comprehend very complex systems, and to organize the elements of the problem and the solution around domains of expertise. In the engineering of physically intensive systems, viewpoints often correspond to capabilities and responsibilities within the engineering organization.&lt;ref name=&quot;NIST2003&quot;&gt;Edward J. Barkmeyer ea (2003). [http://www.mel.nist.gov/msidlibrary/doc/AMIS-Concepts.pdf ''Concepts for Automating Systems Integration''] NIST 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most complex system specifications are so extensive that no one individual can fully comprehend all aspects of the specifications. Furthermore, we all have different interests in a given system and different reasons for examining the system's specifications. A business executive will ask different questions of a system make-up than would a system implementer. The concept of viewpoints framework, therefore, is to provide separate viewpoints into the specification of a given complex system. These viewpoints each satisfy an audience with interest in some set of aspects of the system. Associated with each viewpoint is a viewpoint language
that optimizes the vocabulary and presentation for the audience of that viewpoint.

=== Business process and data modelling ===
Graphical representation of the current state of information provides a very effective means for presenting information to both users and system developers.
[[Image:Process and data modeling.jpg|thumb|360px|example of the interaction between business process and data models.&lt;ref name=SS93/&gt;]]
* A business model illustrates the functions associated with the business process being modeled and the organizations that perform these functions. By depicting activities and information flows, a foundation is created to visualize, define, understand, and validate the nature of a process.
* A data model provides the details of information to be stored, and is of primary use when the final product is the generation of computer software code for an application or the preparation of a functional specification to aid a computer software make-or-buy decision. See the figure on the right for an example of the interaction between business process and data models.&lt;ref name=&quot;SS93&quot;&gt;Paul R. Smith &amp; Richard Sarfaty (1993). [http://www.osti.gov/energycitations/servlets/purl/10160331-YhIRrY/ Creating a strategic plan for configuration management using Computer Aided Software Engineering (CASE) tools.] Paper For 1993 National DOE/Contractors and Facilities CAD/CAE User's Group.&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually, a model is created after conducting an interview, referred to as business analysis. The interview consists of a facilitator asking a series of questions designed to extract required information that describes a process. The interviewer is called a facilitator to emphasize that it is the participants who provide the information. The facilitator should have some knowledge of the process of interest, but this is not as important as having a structured methodology by which the questions are asked of the process expert. The methodology is
important because usually a team of facilitators is collecting information across the facility and the results of the information from all the interviewers must fit together once completed.&lt;ref name=SS93/&gt;

The models are developed as defining either the current state of the process, in which case the final product is called the &quot;as-is&quot; snapshot model, or a collection of ideas of what the process should contain, resulting in a &quot;what-can-be&quot; model. Generation of process and data models can be used to determine if the existing processes and information systems are sound and only need minor modifications or enhancements, or if re-engineering is required as a corrective action. The creation of business models is more than a way to view or automate your information process. Analysis can be used to fundamentally reshape the way your business or organization conducts its operations.&lt;ref name=SS93/&gt;

=== Computer-aided software engineering ===
Computer-aided software engineering (CASE), in the field software engineering is the scientific application of a set of tools and methods to a software which results in high-quality, defect-free, and maintainable software products.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, D.L (1989). &quot;Selecting and effectively using a computer aided software engineering tool&quot;. Annual Westinghouse computer symposium; 6-7 Nov 1989; Pittsburgh, PA (USA); DOE Project.&lt;/ref&gt; It also refers to methods for the development of information systems together with automated tools that can be used in the software development process.&lt;ref&gt;P. Loucopoulos and V. Karakostas (1995). ''System Requirements Engineering''. McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; The term &quot;computer-aided software engineering&quot; (CASE) can refer to the software used for the automated development of systems software, i.e., computer code. The CASE functions include analysis, design, and programming. CASE tools automate methods for designing, documenting, and producing structured computer code in the desired programming language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.its.bldrdoc.gov/projects/devglossary/_case.html CASE] definition In: ''[http://www.its.bldrdoc.gov/projects/devglossary/ Telecom Glossary 2000]. Retrieved 26 Oct 2008.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Two key ideas of Computer-aided Software System Engineering (CASE) are:&lt;ref&gt;K. Robinson (1992). ''Putting the Software Engineering into CASE''. New York : John Wiley and Sons Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Foster computer assistance in software development and or software maintenance processes, and
* An engineering approach to software development and or maintenance.

Typical CASE tools exist for configuration management, data modeling, model transformation, refactoring, source code generation, and Unified Modeling Language.

=== Integrated development environment ===
[[Image:Anjuta-2.0.0-2.png|thumb|360px|Anjuta, a C and C++ IDE for the GNOME environment]]
An integrated development environment (IDE) also known as ''integrated design environment'' or ''integrated debugging environment'' is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. An IDE normally consists of a:
* source code editor,
* compiler and/or interpreter,
* build automation tools, and
* debugger (usually).
IDEs are designed to maximize programmer productivity by providing tight-knit components with similar user interfaces. Typically an IDE is dedicated to a specific programming language, so as to provide a feature set which most closely matches the programming paradigms of the language.

=== Modeling language ===
A modeling language is any artificial language that can be used to express information or knowledge or systems in a structure that is defined by a consistent set of rules. The rules are used for interpretation of the meaning of components in the structure. A modeling language can be graphical or textual.&lt;ref&gt;Xiao He (2007). &quot;A metamodel for the notation of graphical modeling languages&quot;. In: ''Computer Software and Applications Conference, 2007. COMPSAC 2007 - Vol. 1. 31st Annual International'', Volume 1, Issue , 24–27 July 2007, pp 219-224.&lt;/ref&gt; Graphical modeling languages use a diagram techniques with named symbols that represent concepts and lines that connect the symbols and that represent relationships and various other graphical annotation to represent constraints. Textual modeling languages typically use standardised keywords accompanied by parameters to make computer-interpretable expressions.

Example of graphical modelling languages in the field of software engineering are:
* Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN, and the XML form BPML) is an example of a process modeling language.
* EXPRESS and EXPRESS-G (ISO 10303-11) is an international standard general-purpose data modeling language.
* Extended Enterprise Modeling Language (EEML) is commonly used for business process modeling across layers.
* Flowchart is a schematic representation of an algorithm or a stepwise process,
* Fundamental Modeling Concepts (FMC) modeling language for software-intensive systems.
* IDEF is a family of modeling languages, the most notable of which include IDEF0 for functional modeling, IDEF1X for information modeling, and IDEF5 for modeling ontologies.
* LePUS3 is an object-oriented visual Design Description Language and a formal specification language that is suitable primarily for modelling large object-oriented (Java, [[C++]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]]) programs and design patterns.
* Specification and Description Language(SDL) is a specification language targeted at the unambiguous specification and description of the behaviour of reactive and distributed systems.
* Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a general-purpose modeling language that is an industry standard for specifying software-intensive systems. UML 2.0, the current version, supports thirteen different diagram techniques, and has widespread tool support.

Not all modeling languages are executable, and for those that are, using them doesn't necessarily mean that programmers are no longer needed. On the contrary, executable modeling languages are intended to amplify the productivity of skilled programmers, so that they can address more difficult problems, such as parallel computing and distributed systems.

=== Programming paradigm ===
A programming paradigm is a fundamental style of computer programming, in contrast to a software engineering methodology, which is a style of solving specific software engineering problems. Paradigms differ in the concepts and abstractions used to represent the elements of a program (such as objects, functions, variables, constraints...) and the steps that compose a computation (assignation, evaluation, continuations, data flows...).

A programming language can support multiple paradigms. For example programs written in C++ or Object Pascal can be purely procedural, or purely object-oriented, or contain elements of both paradigms. Software designers and programmers decide how to use those paradigm elements. In object-oriented programming, programmers can think of a program as a collection of interacting objects, while in functional programming a program can be thought of as a sequence of stateless function evaluations. When programming computers or systems with many processors, process-oriented programming allows programmers to think about applications as sets of concurrent processes acting upon logically shared data structures.

Just as different groups in software engineering advocate different ''methodologies'', different programming languages advocate different ''programming paradigms''. Some languages are designed to support one paradigm (Smalltalk supports object-oriented programming, Haskell supports functional programming), while other programming languages support multiple paradigms (such as Object Pascal, C++, C#, Visual Basic, Common Lisp, Scheme, Python, Ruby, and Oz).

Many programming paradigms are as well known for what methods they ''forbid'' as for what they enable. For instance, pure functional programming forbids using side-effects; structured programming forbids using goto statements. Partly for this reason, new paradigms are often regarded as doctrinaire or overly rigid by those accustomed to earlier styles.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Avoiding certain methods can make it easier to prove theorems about a program's correctness, or simply to understand its behavior.

=== Software framework ===
A software framework is a re-usable design for a software system or subsystem. A software framework may include support programs, code libraries, a scripting language, or other software to help develop and ''glue together'' the different components of a software project. Various parts of the framework may be exposed via an API.

=== Software development process ===
A software development process is a framework imposed on the development of a software product.  Synonyms include software life cycle and ''software process''.  There are several models for such processes, each describing approaches to a variety of tasks or activities that take place during the process.

A largely growing body of software development organizations implement process methodologies. Many of them are in the defense industry, which in the U.S. requires a rating based on 'process models' to obtain contracts. The international standard describing the method to select, implement and monitor the life cycle for software is ISO 12207.

A decades-long goal has been to find repeatable, predictable processes that improve productivity and quality. Some try to systematize or formalize the seemingly unruly task of writing software. Others apply project management methods to writing software. Without project management, software projects can easily be delivered late or over budget. With large numbers of software projects not meeting their expectations in terms of functionality, cost, or delivery schedule, effective project management appears to be lacking.

== UML Models and Diagrams ==
The Unified Modeling Language is a standardized general-purpose modeling language and nowadays is managed as a de facto industry standard by the Object Management Group (OMG).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.omg.org/ Object Management Group&lt;/ref&gt;  UML includes a set of graphic notation techniques to create visual models of software-intensive systems.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Unified_Modeling_Language&amp;oldid=413683022 Unified Modeling Language&lt;/ref&gt;

=== History ===
UML was invented by the ''Three Amigos'': James Rumbaugh, Grady Booch and Ivar Jacobson. 
After Rational Software Corporation hired James Rumbaugh from General Electric in 1994, the company became the source for the two most popular object-oriented modeling approaches of the day: Rumbaugh's Object-modeling technique (OMT), which was better for object-oriented analysis (OOA), and Grady Booch's Booch method, which was better for object-oriented design (OOD). They were soon assisted in their efforts by Ivar Jacobson, the creator of the object-oriented software engineering (OOSE) method. Jacobson joined Rational in 1995, after his company, Objectory AB,&lt;ref&gt;Objectory AB, known as Objectory System, was founded in 1987 by Ivar Jacobson. In 1991, It was acquired and became a subsidiary of Ericsson.&lt;/ref&gt; was acquired by Rational. 

=== Definition ===
The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is used to specify, visualize, modify, construct and document the artifacts of an object-oriented software-intensive system under development.&lt;ref name=&quot;Foldoc01&quot;&gt; [[Wikipedia:FOLDOC]] (2001). [http://foldoc.org/index.cgi?query=UML&amp;action=Search Unified Modeling Language] last updated 2002-01-03. Accessed 6 feb 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; UML offers a standard way to visualize a system's architectural blueprints, including elements such as activities, actors, business processes, database schemas, components, programming language statements, and reusable software components.&lt;ref name = &quot;OMG00&quot;&gt; Grady Booch, Ivar Jacobson &amp; Jim Rumbaugh (2000) [http://www.omg.org/docs/formal/00-03-01.pdf OMG Unified Modeling Language Specification], Version 1.3 First Edition: March 2000. Retrieved 12 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; 

UML combines techniques from data modeling (entity relationship diagrams), business modeling (work flows), object modeling, and component modeling. It can be used with all processes, throughout the software development life cycle, and across different implementation technologies.&lt;ref&gt;
Satish Mishra (1997). [http://www2.informatik.hu-berlin.de/~hs/Lehre/2004-WS_SWQS/20050107_Ex_UML.ppt &quot;Visual Modeling &amp; Unified Modeling Language (UML) : Introduction to UML&quot;]. Rational Software Corporation. Accessed 9 Nov 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Models and Diagrams ===
It is important to distinguish between the UML model and the set of diagrams of a system. A diagram is a partial graphic representation of a system's model. The model also contains documentation that drive the model elements and diagrams. 

UML diagrams represent two different views of a system model &lt;ref&gt;Jon Holt Institution of Electrical Engineers (2004). ''UML for Systems Engineering: Watching the Wheels'' IET, 2004, ISBN 0863413544. p.58&lt;/ref&gt;:
* Static (or structural) view: emphasizes the static structure of the system using objects, attributes, operations and relationships. The structural view includes class diagrams and composite structure diagrams.
* Dynamic (or behavioral) view: emphasizes the dynamic behavior of the system by showing collaborations among objects and changes to the internal states of objects. This view includes sequence diagrams, activity diagrams and state machine diagrams.

=== Diagrams Overview ===
In UML 2.2 there are 14 types of diagrams divided into two categories.&lt;ref&gt;''UML Superstructure Specification Version 2.2''. OMG, February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Seven diagram types represent structural information, and the other seven represent general types of behavior, including four that represent different aspects of interactions.  These diagrams can be categorized hierarchically as shown in the following diagram:
[[File:Uml diagram2.png|center|Hierarchy of UML 2.2 Diagrams, shown as a class diagram.]]


==== Structure Diagrams ====
Structure diagrams emphasize the things that must be present in the system being modeled. Since structure diagrams represent the structure, they are used extensively in documenting the software architecture of software systems.
* Class diagram: describes the structure of a system by showing the system's classes, their attributes, and the relationships among the classes.
* Component diagram: describes how a software system is split up into components and shows the dependencies among these components.
* Composite structure diagram: describes the internal structure of a class and the collaborations that this structure makes possible.
* Deployment diagram: describes the hardware used in system implementations and the execution environments and artifacts deployed on the hardware.
* Object diagram: shows a complete or partial view of the structure of a modeled system at a specific time.
* Package diagram: describes how a system is split up into logical groupings by showing the dependencies among these groupings.
* Profile diagram: operates at the metamodel level to show stereotypes as classes with the &lt;&lt;stereotype&gt;&gt; stereotype, and profiles as packages with the &lt;&lt;profile&gt;&gt; stereotype. The extension relation (solid line with closed, filled arrowhead) indicates what metamodel element a given stereotype is extending.

==== Behaviour Diagrams ====
Behavior diagrams emphasize what must happen in the system being modeled. Since behavior diagrams illustrate the behavior of a system, they are used extensively to describe the functionality of software systems.
* Use case diagram: describes the functionality provided by a system in terms of actors, their goals represented as use cases, and any dependencies among those use cases.
* Activity diagram: describes the business and operational step-by-step workflows of components in a system. An activity diagram shows the overall flow of control.
* state machine diagram: describes the states and state transitions of the system.

==== Interaction Diagrams ====
Interaction diagrams, a subset of behaviour diagrams, emphasize the flow of control and data among the things in the system being modeled:
* Sequence diagram: shows how objects communicate with each other in terms of a sequence of messages. Also indicates the lifespans of objects relative to those messages.
* Communication diagram: shows the interactions between objects or parts in terms of sequenced messages. They represent a combination of information taken from Class, Sequence, and Use Case Diagrams describing both the static structure and dynamic behavior of a system.
* Interaction overview diagram: provides an overview in which the nodes represent communication diagrams.
* Timing diagrams: a specific type of interaction diagram where the focus is on timing constraints.

=== UML Modelling Tools ===
To draw UML diagrams, all you need is a pencil and a piece of paper.  However, for a software engineer that seems a little outdated, hence most of us will use tools.  The simplest tools are simply drawing programs, like Visio or Dia.  The diagrams generated this way look nice, but are not really that useful, since they do not include the code generation feature.  

Hence, when deciding on a UML modelling tool (sometimes also called CASE tool)&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_software_engineering Computer-aided software engineering&lt;/ref&gt; you should make sure, that it allows for code generation and even better, it should also allow for reverse engineering.  Combined, these two are also referred to as round-trip engineering.  Any serious tool should be able to do that.  Finally, UML models can be exchanged among UML tools by using the XMI interchange format, hence you should check that your tool of choice supports this.

Since the Rational Software Corporation so to say 'invented' UML, the most well-known UML modelling tool is IBM Rational Rose. Other tools include Rational Rhapsody, MagicDraw UML, StarUML, ArgoUML, Umbrello, BOUML, PowerDesigner, Visio and Dia. Some of popular development environments also offer UML modelling tools, i. e. Eclipse, NetBeans, and Visual Studio. &lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unified_Modeling_Language_tools List of Unified Modeling Language Tools&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">First we need to  take a brief look at the big piture.  The software development process is a structure imposed on the development of a software product. It is made up of a set of activities and steps with the goal to find repeatable, predictable processes that improve productivity and quality.

== Software Development Activities ==
[[File:SDLC - Software Development Life Cycle.jpg|thumb|Model of the Systems Development Life Cycle]]
[[File:CPT-SystemLifeSycle.svg|thumb|240px|Model of the Systems Development Life Cycle]]
The software development process consists of a set of activities and steps, which are
* Requirements
* Specification
* Architecture
* Design
* Implementation
* Testing
* Deployment
* Maintenance

=== Planning ===
The important task in creating a software product is extracting the requirements or requirements analysis. Customers typically have an abstract idea of what they want as an end result, but not what software should do. Incomplete, ambiguous, or even contradictory requirements are recognized by skilled and experienced software engineers at this point. Frequently demonstrating live code may help reduce the risk that the requirements are incorrect.

Once the general requirements are gathered from the client, an analysis of the scope of the development should be determined and clearly stated.  This is often called a scope document.

Certain functionality may be out of scope of the project as a function of cost or as a result of unclear requirements at the start of development. If the development is done externally, this document can be considered a legal document so that if there are ever disputes, any ambiguity of what was promised to the client can be clarified.

=== Implementation, Testing and Documenting ===
Implementation is the part of the process where software engineers actually program the code for the project.

Software testing is an integral and important part of the software development process. This part of the process ensures that defects are recognized as early as possible.

Documenting the internal design of software for the purpose of future maintenance and enhancement is done throughout development. This may also include the writing of an API, be it external or internal. It is very important to document everything in the project.

=== Deployment and Maintenance ===
Deployment starts after the code is appropriately tested, is approved for release and sold or otherwise distributed into a production environment.

Software Training and Support is important and a lot of developers fail to realize that. It would not matter how much time and planning a development team puts into creating software if nobody in an organization ends up using it. People are often resistant to change and avoid venturing into an unfamiliar area, so as a part of the deployment phase, it is very important to have training classes for new clients of your software.

Maintaining and enhancing software to cope with newly discovered problems or new requirements can take far more time than the initial development of the software. It may be necessary to add code that does not fit the original design to correct an unforeseen problem or it may be that a customer is requesting more functionality and code can be added to accommodate their requests. If the labor cost of the maintenance phase exceeds 25% of the prior-phases' labor cost, then it is likely that the overall quality of at least one prior phase is poor.  In that case, management should consider the option of rebuilding the system (or portions) before maintenance cost is out of control.

The '''Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC)''', or ''Software Development Life Cycle'' in systems engineering, information systems and software engineering, is the process of creating or altering systems, and the models and methodologies that people use to develop these systems. The concept generally refers to computer or information systems.

In software engineering the SDLC concept underpins many kinds of software development methodologies. These methodologies form the framework for planning and controlling the creation of an information system&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cms.hhs.gov/SystemLifecycleFramework/Downloads/SelectingDevelopmentApproach.pdf SELECTING A DEVELOPMENT APPROACH]. Retrieved 27 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;: the software development process.

== Overview ==
Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a process used by a systems analyst to develop an information system, including requirements,  validation, training, and user (stakeholder) ownership. Any SDLC should result in a high quality system that meets or exceeds customer expectations, reaches completion within time and cost estimates, works effectively and efficiently in the current and planned Information Technology infrastructure, and is inexpensive to maintain and cost-effective to enhance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://foldoc.org/foldoc.cgi?Systems+Development+Life+Cycle &quot;Systems Development Life Cycle&quot;]. In: Foldoc(2000-12-24)&lt;/ref&gt;

Computer systems are complex and often (especially with the recent rise of Service-Oriented Architecture) link multiple traditional systems potentially supplied by different software vendors. To manage this level of complexity, a number of SDLC models have been created: &quot;waterfall&quot;; &quot;fountain&quot;; &quot;spiral&quot;; &quot;build and fix&quot;; &quot;rapid prototyping&quot;; &quot;incremental&quot;; and &quot;synchronize and stabilize&quot;. &lt;ref&gt; http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:bfhOl8jp1S8J:condor.depaul.edu/~jpetlick/extra/394/Session2.ppt+&amp;hl=en&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEEShCfW0_MLC4wRbczfUxrndHTkbwguF9fZuaUCe0RDyOCWyO2PTmaPhHnZ4jRhZZ75maVO_7gVAD2ex5-QIhrj1683hMefBNkak7FkQJCAwd-i0-_aQfEVEEKP177h4mmkvMMWJ7&amp;sig=AHIEtbRhMlZ-TUyioKEhLQQxXk1WoSJXWA &lt;/ref&gt;

SDLC models can be described along a spectrum of agile to iterative to sequential. Agile methodologies, such as XP and Scrum, focus on light-weight processes which allow for rapid changes along the development cycle.  Iterative methodologies, such as Rational Unified Process and Dynamic Systems Development Method, focus on limited project scopes and expanding or improving products by multiple iterations. Sequential or big-design-up-front (BDUF) models, such as Waterfall, focus on complete and correct planning to guide large projects and risks to successful and predictable results {{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}. Other models, such as Anamorphic Development, tend to focus on a form of development that is guided by project scope and adaptive iterations of feature development.

In project management a project can be defined both with a project life cycle (PLC) and an SDLC, during which slightly different activities occur. According to Taylor (2004) &quot;the project life cycle encompasses all the activities of the project, while the systems development life cycle focuses on realizing the product requirements&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;James Taylor (2004). ''Managing Information Technology Projects''. p.39..&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The '''Systems  Life Cycle (SLC)''' is a type of methodology used to describe the process for building information systems, intended to develop information systems in a very deliberate, structured and methodical way, reiterating each stage of the life cycle. The systems development life cycle, according to Elliott &amp; Strachan &amp; Radford (2004), &quot;originated in the 1960s,to develop large scale functional business systems in an age of large scale business conglomerates. Information systems activities revolved around heavy data processing and number crunching routines&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ell04&quot;&gt;Geoffrey Elliott &amp; Josh Strachan (2004) ''Global Business Information Technology''. p.87.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several systems development frameworks have been partly based on SDLC, such as the Structured Systems Analysis and Design Method (SSADM) produced for the UK government Office of Government Commerce in the 1980s. Ever since, according to Elliott (2004), &quot;the traditional life cycle approaches to systems development have been increasingly replaced with alternative approaches and frameworks, which attempted to overcome some of the inherent deficiencies of the traditional SDLC&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ell04&quot;/&gt;

== Systems development phases ==
The System Development Life Cycle framework provides a sequence of activities for system designers and developers to follow. It consists of a set of steps or phases in which each phase of the SDLC uses the results of the previous one.

A Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) adheres to important phases that are essential for developers, such as planning, analysis, design, and implementation, and are explained in the section below. A number of system development life cycle (SDLC) models have been created: waterfall, fountain, spiral, build and fix, rapid prototyping, incremental, and synchronize and stabilize. The oldest of these, and the best known, is the waterfall model: a sequence of stages in which the output of each stage becomes the input for the next. These stages can be characterized and divided up in different ways, including the following&lt;ref&gt;http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/71151/System_Development_Life_Cycle&lt;/ref&gt;:

* '''Project planning, feasibility study''': Establishes a high-level view of the intended project and determines its goals.
* '''Systems analysis, requirements definition''': Refines project goals into defined functions and operation of the intended application. Analyzes end-user information needs.
* '''Systems design''': Describes desired features and operations in detail, including screen layouts, business rules, process diagrams, pseudocode and other documentation.
* '''Implementation''': The real code is written here.
* '''Integration and testing''': Brings all the pieces together into a special testing environment, then checks for errors, bugs and interoperability.
* '''Acceptance, installation, deployment''': The final stage of initial development, where the software is put into production and runs actual business.
* '''Maintenance''': What happens during the rest of the software's life: changes, correction, additions, moves to a different computing platform and more. This, the least glamorous and perhaps most important step of all, goes on seemingly forever.

In the following example (see picture) these stage of the Systems Development Life Cycle are divided in ten steps from definition to creation and modification of IT work products:

[[Image:Systems Development Life Cycle.jpg|thumb|720px|center| The tenth phase occurs when the system is disposed of and the task performed is either eliminated or transferred to other systems. The tasks and work products for each phase are described in subsequent chapters. &lt;ref name = &quot;US DJ03&quot;&gt; US Department of Justice (2003). [http://www.usdoj.gov/jmd/irm/lifecycle/ch1.htm INFORMATION RESOURCES MANAGEMENT] Chapter 1. Introduction.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Not every project will require that the phases be sequentially executed. However, the phases are interdependent. Depending upon the size and complexity of the project, phases may be combined or may overlap.&lt;ref name = &quot;US DJ03&quot;/&gt;

=== System analysis ===
The goal of system analysis is to determine where the problem is in an attempt to fix the system. This step involves breaking down the system in different pieces to analyze the situation, analyzing project goals, breaking down what needs to be created and attempting to engage users so that definite requirements can be defined. 

Requirements analysis sometimes requires individuals/teams from client as well as service provider sides to get detailed and accurate requirements; often there has to be a lot of communication to and from to understand these requirements. Requirement gathering is the most crucial aspect as many times communication gaps arise in this phase and this leads to validation errors and bugs in the software program.

=== Design ===
In systems design the design functions and operations are described in detail, including screen layouts, business rules, process diagrams and other documentation. The output of this stage will describe the new system as a collection of modules or subsystems.

The design stage takes as its initial input the requirements identified in the approved requirements document. For each requirement, a set of one or more design elements will be produced as a result of interviews, workshops, and/or
prototype efforts. 

Design elements describe the desired software features in detail, and generally include functional hierarchy diagrams, screen layout diagrams, tables of business rules, business process diagrams, pseudocode, and a complete entity-relationship diagram with a full data dictionary. These design elements are intended to describe the software in sufficient detail that skilled programmers may develop the software with minimal additional input design.

=== Implementation ===
Modular and subsystem programming code will be accomplished during this stage. Unit testing and module testing are done in this stage by the developers. This stage is intermingled with the next in that individual modules will need testing before integration to the main project.

=== Testing ===
The code is tested at various levels in software testing. Unit, system and user acceptance testings are often performed.  This is a grey area as many different opinions exist as to what the stages of testing are and how much if any iteration occurs. Iteration is not generally part of the waterfall model, but usually some occur at this stage. In the testing the whole system is test one by one

Following are the types of testing:
* Defect testing
* Path testing
* Data set testing
* Unit testing
* System testing
* Integration testing
* Black box testing
* White box testing
* Regression testing
* Automation testing
* User acceptance testing
* Performance testing

=== Operations and maintenance ===
The deployment of the system includes changes and enhancements before the decommissioning or sunset of the system. Maintaining the system is an important aspect of SDLC.  As key personnel change positions in the organization, new changes will be implemented, which will require system updates.

== Systems Analysis and Design ==
The '''Systems Analysis and Design (SAD)''' is the process of developing Information Systems (IS) that effectively use of hardware, software, data, process, and people to support the company’s business objectives.

== Systems development life cycle topics ==
=== Management and control ===
[[Image:SDLC Phases Related to Management Controls.jpg|thumb|400px|SDLC Phases Related to Management Controls.&lt;ref name= &quot;USHR99&quot;&gt;U.S. House of Representatives (1999). [http://www.house.gov/cao-opp/PDFSolicitations/SDLCPOL.pdf ''Systems Development Life-Cycle Policy'']. p.13.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) phases serve as a programmatic guide to project activity and provide a flexible but consistent way to conduct projects to a depth matching the scope of the project. Each of the SDLC phase objectives are described in this section with key deliverables, a description of recommended tasks, and a summary of related control objectives for effective management. It is critical for the project manager to establish and monitor control objectives during each SDLC phase while executing projects. Control objectives help to provide a clear statement of the desired result or purpose and should be used throughout the entire SDLC process. Control objectives can be grouped into major categories (Domains), and relate to the SDLC phases as shown in the figure.&lt;ref name= &quot;USHR99&quot;/&gt;

To manage and control any SDLC initiative, each project will be required to establish some degree of a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) to capture and schedule the work necessary to complete the project. The WBS and all programmatic material should be kept in the “Project Description” section of the project notebook. The WBS format is mostly left to the project manager to establish in a way that best describes the project work. There are some key areas that must be defined in the WBS as part of the SDLC policy. The following diagram describes three key areas that will be addressed in the WBS in a manner established by the project manager.&lt;ref name= &quot;USHR99&quot;/&gt;

=== Work breakdown structured organization ===
[[Image:SDLC Work Breakdown Structure.jpg|thumb|400px|Work Breakdown Structure.&lt;ref name= &quot;USHR99&quot;/&gt;]]
The upper section of the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) should identify the major phases and milestones of the project in a summary fashion. In addition, the upper section should provide an overview of the full scope and timeline of the project and will be part of the initial project description effort leading to project approval. The middle section of the WBS is based on the seven Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) phases as a guide for WBS task development. The WBS elements should consist of milestones and “tasks” as opposed to “activities” and have a definitive period (usually two weeks or more). Each task must have a measurable output (e.x. document, decision, or analysis). A WBS task may rely on one or more activities (e.g. software engineering, systems engineering) and may require close coordination with other tasks, either internal or external to the project. Any part of the project needing support from contractors should have a Statement of work (SOW) written to include the appropriate tasks from the SDLC phases. The development of a SOW does not occur during a specific phase of SDLC but is developed to include the work from the SDLC process that may be conducted by external resources such as contractors and struct.&lt;ref name= &quot;USHR99&quot;/&gt;

=== Baselines in the SDLC ===
Baselines are an important part of the Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC). These baselines are established after four of the five phases of the SDLC and are critical to the iterative nature of the model .&lt;ref&gt;Blanchard, B. S., &amp; Fabrycky, W. J.(2006) ''Systems engineering and analysis'' (4th ed.) New Jersey: Prentice Hall. p.31&lt;/ref&gt; Each baseline is considered as a milestone in the SDLC.

* Functional Baseline: established after the conceptual design phase.
* Allocated Baseline: established after the preliminary design phase.
* Product Baseline: established after the detail design and development phase.
* Updated Product Baseline: established after the production construction phase.

=== Complementary to SDLC ===
Complementary Software development methods to Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) are:
* Software Prototyping
* Joint Applications Design (JAD)
* Rapid Application Development (RAD)
* Extreme Programming (XP); extension of earlier work in Prototyping and RAD.
* Open Source Development
* End-user development
* Object Oriented Programming

== Strengths and weaknesses ==
Few people in the modern computing world would use a strict waterfall model for their Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) as many modern methodologies have superseded this thinking. Some will argue that the SDLC no longer applies to models like Agile computing, but it is still a term widely in use in Technology circles. The SDLC practice has advantages in traditional models of software development, that lends itself more to a structured environment. The disadvantages to using the SDLC methodology is when there is need for iterative development or (i.e. web development or e-commerce) where stakeholders need to review on a regular basis the software being designed. Instead of viewing SDLC from a strength or weakness perspective, it is far more important to take the best practices from the SDLC model and apply it to whatever may be most appropriate for the software being designed.

A comparison of the strengths and weaknesses of SDLC:

An alternative to the SDLC is Rapid Application Development, which combines prototyping, Joint Application Development and implementation of CASE tools. The advantages of RAD are speed, reduced development cost, and active user involvement in the development process.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Systems Engineering Process II.svg|thumb|420px|The V-model of the Systems Engineering Process.&lt;ref name = &quot;FHWA 05&quot;&gt;[http://www.itsdocs.fhwa.dot.gov/jpodocs/repts_te/14158.htm ''Clarus Concept of Operations.''] Publication No. FHWA-JPO-05-072, Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), 2005&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The '''V-model''' represents a software development process (also applicable to hardware development) which may be considered an extension of the waterfall model. Instead of moving down in a linear way, the process steps are bent upwards after the coding phase, to form the typical V shape. The V-Model demonstrates the relationships between each phase of the development life cycle and its associated phase of testing. The horizontal and vertical axes represents time or project completeness (left-to-right) and level of abstraction (coarsest-grain abstraction uppermost), respectively.

== Verification Phases ==
=== Requirements analysis ===
In the Requirements analysis phase, the requirements of the proposed system are collected by analyzing the needs of the user(s). This phase is concerned about establishing what the ideal system has to perform. However it does not determine how the software will be designed or built. Usually, the users are interviewed and a document called the user requirements document is generated.

The user requirements document will typically describe the system’s functional, interface, performance, data, security, etc requirements as expected by the user. It is used by business analysts to communicate their understanding of the system to the users. The users carefully review this document as this document would serve as the guideline for the system designers in the system design phase. The user acceptance tests are designed in this phase. See also Functional requirements.
this is parallel processing

There are different methods for gathering requirements of both soft and hard methodologies including; interviews, questionnaires, document analysis, observation, throw-away prototypes, use cases and status and dynamic views with users.

=== System Design ===
Systems design is the phase where system engineers analyze and understand the business of the proposed system by studying the user requirements document. They figure out possibilities and techniques by which the user requirements can be implemented. If any of the requirements are not feasible, the user is informed of the issue. A resolution is found and the user requirement document is edited accordingly.

The software specification document which serves as a blueprint for the development phase is generated. This document contains the general system organization, menu structures, data structures etc. It may also hold example business scenarios, sample windows, reports for the better understanding. Other technical documentation like entity diagrams, data dictionary will also be produced in this phase. The documents for system testing are prepared in this phase.

===Architecture Design===
The phase of the design of computer architecture and software architecture can also be referred to as high-level design. The baseline in selecting the architecture is that it should realize all which typically consists of the list of modules, brief functionality of each module, their interface relationships, dependencies, database tables, architecture diagrams, technology details etc. The integration testing design is carried out  in the particular  phase.

===Module Design===
The module design phase can also be referred to as low-level design. The designed system is broken up into smaller units or modules and each of them is explained so that the programmer can start coding directly.
The low level design document or program specifications will contain a detailed functional logic of the module, in pseudocode:

* database tables, with all elements, including their type and size
* all interface details with complete API references
* all dependency issues
* error message listings
* complete input and outputs for a module.

The unit test design is developed in this stage.

== Validation Phases ==
===Unit Testing===
In computer programming, unit testing is a method by which individual units of source code are tested to determine if they are fit for use. A unit is the smallest testable part of an application. In procedural programming a unit may be an individual function or procedure. Unit tests are created by programmers or occasionally by white box testers. The purpose is to verify the internal logic code by testing every possible branch within the function, also known as test coverage. Static analysis tools are used to facilitate in this process, where variations of input data are passed to the function to test every possible case of execution.

===Integration Testing===
In integration testing the separate modules will be tested together to expose faults  in the interfaces and in the interaction between integrated components. Testing is usually  black box as the code is not directly checked for errors.

===System Testing===
System testing will compare the system specifications against the actual system.After the integration test is completed, the next test level is the system test. System testing checks if the integrated product meets the specified requirements. Why is this still necessary after the component and integration tests? The reasons for this are as follows:

====Reasons for system test====
#In the lower test levels, the testing was done against technical specifications, i.e., from the technical perspective of the software producer. The system test, though, looks at the system from the perspective of the customer and the future user. The testers validate whether the requirements are completely and appropriately met.
#*Example: The customer (who has ordered and paid for the system) and the user (who uses the system) can be different groups of people or organizations with their own specific interests and requirements of the system.
# Many functions and system characteristics result from the interaction of all system components, consequently, they are only visible on the level of the entire system and can only be observed and tested there.

===User Acceptance Testing===
Acceptance testing is the phase of testing used to determine whether a system satisfies the requirements specified in the requirements analysis phase. The acceptance test design is derived from the requirements document. The acceptance test phase is the phase used by the customer to determine whether to accept the system or not.

Acceptance testing helps
* to determine whether a system satisfies its acceptance criteria or not.
* to enable the customer to determine whether to accept the system or not.
* to test the software in the &quot;real world&quot; by the intended audience.
Purpose of acceptance testing:
* to verify the system or changes according to the original needs.

====Procedures ====
#Define the acceptance criteria:
#* Functionality requirements.
#* Performance requirements.
#* Interface quality requirements.
#* Overall software quality requirements.
#Develop an acceptance plan:
#* Project description.
#* User responsibilities.
#* Acceptance description.
#* Execute the acceptance test plan.

'''Agile software development''' is a group of software development methodologies based on iterative and incremental development, where requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between self-organizing, cross-functional teams. The ''Agile Manifesto''&lt;ref name=&quot;Agile Manifesto&quot;&gt;{{Cite web
|url=http://agilemanifesto.org/
|title=Manifesto for Agile Software Development |year=2001 |publisher=Agile Alliance
|author=Beck, Kent |author2=et al.|authorlink=Kent Beck
|accessdate=2010-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; introduced the term in 2001.

==History==
=== Predecessors ===
[[File:Jeff Sutherland.JPG|thumb|upright|Jeff Sutherland, one of the developers of the Scrum agile software development process]]
Incremental software development methods have been traced back to 1957.&lt;ref name=&quot;craig2003&quot;/&gt; In 1974, a paper by E. A. Edmonds introduced an adaptive software development process.&lt;ref name=&quot;edmonds1974&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| last=Edmonds| first=E. A.| title= A Process for the Development of Software for Nontechnical Users as an Adaptive System| journal=General Systems| volume=19| year=1974| pages=215–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

So-called &quot;lightweight&quot; software development methods evolved in the mid-1990s as a reaction against &quot;heavyweight&quot; methods, which were characterized by their critics as a heavily regulated, regimented, micromanaged, waterfall model of development. Proponents of lightweight methods (and now &quot;agile&quot; methods) contend that they are a return to development practices from early in the history of software development.&lt;ref name=&quot;craig2003&quot;&gt;Gerald M. Weinberg, as quoted in {{cite journal
|last=Larman | first=Craig |first2 =Victor R. |last2=Basili
|year=2003 | month=June
|title=Iterative and Incremental Development: A Brief History
|journal=Computer |volume=36 |issue=6 |pages=47–56 |doi=10.1109/MC.2003.1204375 |ISSN=0018-9162 |accessdate=2007-02-22
|quote=We were doing incremental development as early as 1957, in Los Angeles, under the direction of Bernie Dimsdale [at IBM's ServiceBureau Corporation]. He was a colleague of John von Neumann, so perhaps he learned it there, or assumed it as totally natural. I do remember Herb Jacobs (primarily, though we all participated) developing a large simulation for Motorola, where the technique used was, as far as I can tell .... All of us, as far as I can remember, thought waterfalling of a huge project was rather stupid, or at least ignorant of the realities. I think what the waterfall description did for us was make us realize that we were doing something else, something unnamed except for 'software development.'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early implementations of lightweight methods include Scrum (1995), Crystal Clear, Extreme Programming (1996), Adaptive Software Development, Feature Driven Development, and Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM) (1995). These are now typically referred to as agile methodologies, after the Agile Manifesto published in 2001.&lt;ref name=Larman2004&gt;{{Cite book | last=Larman | first=Craig | year=2004 | title=Agile and Iterative Development: A Manager's Guide | publisher=Addison-Wesley | isbn=9780131111554 | page=27 | postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Agile Manifesto ===
In February 2001, 17 software developers&lt;ref&gt;Kent Beck, Mike Beedle, Arie van Bennekum, Alistair Cockburn, Ward Cunningham, Martin Fowler, James Grenning, Jim Highsmith, Andrew Hunt, Ron Jeffries, Jon Kern, Brian Marick, Robert C. Martin, Stephen J. Mellor, Ken Schwaber, Jeff Sutherland, and Dave Thomas&lt;/ref&gt; met at a ski resort in Snowbird, Utah, to discuss lightweight development methods. They published the &quot;Manifesto for Agile Software Development&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Agile Manifesto&quot;/&gt; to define the approach now known as agile software development. Some of the manifesto's authors formed the Agile Alliance, a nonprofit organization that promotes software development according to the manifesto's principles.

Agile Manifesto reads, in its entirety, as follows:&lt;ref name=&quot;Agile Manifesto&quot;/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:

:'''Individuals and interactions''' over processes and tools
:'''Working software''' over comprehensive documentation
:'''Customer collaboration''' over contract negotiation
:'''Responding to change''' over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Twelve principles underlie the Agile Manifesto, including:&lt;ref name=&quot;manifestoprinciples&quot;&gt;{{Cite web
|url=http://www.agilemanifesto.org/principles.html
|title=Principles behind the Agile Manifesto|year=2001 |publisher=Agile Alliance
|author=Beck, Kent |author2=et al.
|accessdate=2010-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Customer satisfaction by rapid delivery of useful software
* Welcome changing requirements, even late in development
* Working software is delivered frequently (weeks rather than months)
* Working software is the principal measure of progress
* Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace
* Close, daily co-operation between business people and developers
* Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication (co-location)
* Projects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted
* Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design
* Simplicity
* Self-organizing teams
* Regular adaptation to changing circumstances

In 2005, a group headed by Alistair Cockburn and Jim Highsmith wrote an addendum of project management principles, the Declaration of Interdependence,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://pmdoi.org
|authorlink=David Anderson |first=David |last=Anderson
|title=Declaration of Interdependence
|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; to guide software project management according to agile development methods.

==Characteristics==
 [[Image:Pair programming 1.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Pair programming, an XP development technique used by agile]]
There are many specific agile development methods. Most promote development, teamwork, collaboration, and process adaptability throughout the life-cycle of the project.

Agile methods break tasks into small increments with minimal planning, and do not directly involve long-term planning. Iterations are short time frames (timeboxes) that typically last from one to four weeks. Each iteration involves a team working through a full software development cycle including planning, requirements analysis, design, coding, unit testing, and acceptance testing when a working product is demonstrated to stakeholders. This minimizes overall risk and allows the project to adapt to changes quickly. Stakeholders produce documentation as required. An iteration may not add enough functionality to warrant a market release, but the goal is to have an available release (with minimal bugs) at the end of each iteration.&lt;ref name=&quot;embracing change&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|
last=Beck|first=Kent|
year=1999|title=Embracing Change with Extreme Programming|
journal=Computer|volume=32|issue=10|
pages=70–77|
doi=10.1109/2.796139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple iterations may be required to release a product or new features.

Team composition in an agile project is usually cross-functional and self-organizing without consideration for any existing corporate hierarchy or the corporate roles of team members. Team members normally take responsibility for tasks that deliver the functionality an iteration requires. They decide individually how to meet an iteration's requirements.

Agile methods emphasize face-to-face communication over written documents when the team is all in the same location. Most agile teams work in a single open office (called a bullpen), which facilitates such communication. Team size is typically small (5-9 people) to simplify team communication and team collaboration. Larger development efforts may be delivered by multiple teams working toward a common goal or on different parts of an effort. This may require a co-ordination of priorities across teams. When a team works in different locations, they maintain daily contact through videoconferencing, voice, e-mail, etc.

No matter what development disciplines are required, each agile team will contain a customer representative. This person is appointed by stakeholders to act on their behalf and makes a personal commitment to being available for developers to answer mid-iteration problem-domain questions. At the end of each iteration, stakeholders and the customer representative review progress and re-evaluate priorities with a view to optimizing the return on investment (ROI) and ensuring alignment with customer needs and company goals.

Most agile implementations use a routine and formal daily face-to-face communication among team members. This specifically includes the customer representative and any interested stakeholders as observers. In a brief session, team members report to each other what they did the previous day, what they intend to do today, and what their roadblocks are. This face-to-face communication exposes problems as they arise.

Agile development emphasizes working software as the primary measure of progress. This, combined with the preference for face-to-face communication, produces less written documentation than other methods. The agile method encourages stakeholders to prioritize wants with other iteration outcomes based exclusively on business value perceived at the beginning of the iteration.

Specific tools and techniques such as continuous integration, automated or xUnit test, pair programming, test driven development, design patterns, domain-driven design, code refactoring and other techniques are often used to improve quality and enhance project agility.

==Comparison with other methods==
Agile methods are sometimes characterized as being at the opposite end of the spectrum from &quot;plan-driven&quot; or &quot;disciplined&quot; methods; agile teams may, however, employ highly disciplined formal methods.&lt;ref name=&quot;black2009&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| last1=Black| first1=S. E.| last2=Boca.| first2=P. P.| last3=Bowen| first3=J. P.| last4=Gorman| first4=J.| last5= Hinchey| first5=M. G.| authorlink1=Sue Black (computer scientist)| authorlink3=Jonathan Bowen| authorlink5=Michael Hinchey| title= Formal versus agile: Survival of the fittest| journal=IEEE Computer| volume=49| number=9| month=September| year=2009| pages=39–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more accurate distinction is that methods exist on a continuum from &quot;adaptive&quot; to &quot;predictive&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;boehm2004App&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Boehm|first=B.|authorlink=Barry Boehm|coauthors=R. Turner|title=Balancing Agility and Discipline: A Guide for the Perplexed|publisher=Addison-Wesley|location=Boston, MA|year=2004|isbn=0-321-18612-5}} Appendix A, pages 165-194&lt;/ref&gt; Agile methods lie on the &quot;adaptive&quot; side of this continuum.
Adaptive methods focus on adapting quickly to changing realities. When the needs of a project change, an adaptive team changes as well. An adaptive team will have difficulty describing exactly what will happen in the future. The further away a date is, the more vague an adaptive method will be about what will happen on that date.  An adaptive team cannot report exactly what tasks are being done next week, but only which features are planned for next month. When asked about a release six months from now, an adaptive team may only be able to report the mission statement for the release, or a statement of expected value vs. cost.

Predictive methods, in contrast, focus on planning the future in detail. A predictive team can report exactly what features and tasks are planned for the entire length of the development process. Predictive teams have difficulty changing direction. The plan is typically optimized for the original destination and changing direction can require completed work to be started over. Predictive teams will often institute a change control board to ensure that only the most valuable changes are considered.

Formal methods, in contrast to adaptive and predictive methods, focus on computer science theory with a wide array of types of provers. A formal method attempts to prove the absence of errors with some level of determinism. Some formal methods are based on model checking and provide counter examples for code that cannot be proven. Generally, mathematical models (often supported through special languages see SPIN model checker) map to assertions about requirements. Formal methods are dependent on a tool driven approach, and may be combined with other development approaches. Some provers do not easily scale. Like agile methods, manifestos relevant to high integrity software have been proposed in [http://elsmar.com/pdf_files/A%20Manifesto%20for%20High-Integrity%20Software.pdf Crosstalk].

Agile methods have much in common with the &quot;Rapid Application Development&quot; techniques from the 1980/90s as espoused by James Martin and others.

==Agile methods==

*Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM)
*Essential Unified Process (EssUP)
*Extreme Programming (XP)
*Feature Driven Development (FDD)
*Open Unified Process (OpenUP)
*Scrum
*Velocity tracking

===Method tailoring===
In the literature, different terms refer to the notion of method adaptation, including ‘method tailoring’, ‘method fragment adaptation’ and ‘situational method engineering’. Method tailoring is defined as:

&lt;blockquote&gt; A process or capability in which human agents through responsive changes in, and dynamic interplays between contexts, intentions, and method fragments determine a system development approach for a specific project situation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aydin2004&quot;&gt;Aydin, M.N., Harmsen, F., Slooten, K. v., &amp; Stagwee, R. A. (2004). An Agile Information Systems Development Method in use. ''Turk J Elec Engin, 12(2),'' 127-138&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Potentially, almost all agile methods are suitable for method tailoring. Even the DSDM method is being used for this purpose and has been successfully tailored in a CMM context.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abrahamsson2003&quot;&gt;Abrahamsson, P., Warsta, J., Siponen, M.T., &amp; Ronkainen, J. (2003). New Directions on Agile Methods: A Comparative Analysis. ''Proceedings of ICSE'03'', 244-254&lt;/ref&gt; Situation-appropriateness can be considered as a distinguishing characteristic between agile methods and traditional software development methods, with the latter being relatively much more rigid and prescriptive. The practical implication is that agile methods allow project teams to adapt working practices according to the needs of individual projects. Practices are concrete activities and products that are part of a method framework. At a more extreme level, the philosophy behind the method, consisting of a number of principles, could be adapted (Aydin, 2004).&lt;ref name=&quot;Aydin2004&quot; /&gt;

Extreme Programming (XP) makes the need for method adaptation explicit. One of the fundamental ideas of XP is that no one process fits every project, but rather that practices should be tailored to the needs of individual projects. Partial adoption of XP practices, as suggested by Beck, has been reported on several occasions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abrahamsson2002&quot;&gt;Abrahamsson, P., Salo, O., Ronkainen, J., &amp; Warsta, J. (2002). Agile Software Development Methods: Review and Analysis. ''VTT Publications 478''&lt;/ref&gt; A tailoring practice is proposed by [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1370143.1370149&amp;coll=ACM&amp;dl=ACM&amp;CFID=69442744&amp;CFTOKEN=96226775, Mehdi Mirakhorli] which provides sufficient roadmap and guideline for adapting all the practices. RDP Practice is designed for customizing XP. This practice, first proposed as a long research paper in the APSO workshop at the ICSE 2008 conference, is currently the only proposed and applicable method for customizing XP. Although it is specifically a solution for XP, this practice has the capability of extending to other methodologies. At first glance, this practice seems to be in the category of static method adaptation but experiences with RDP Practice says that it can be treated like dynamic method adaptation. The distinction between static method adaptation and dynamic method adaptation is subtle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aydin2005&quot;&gt;Aydin, M.N., Harmsen, F., Slooten van K., &amp; Stegwee, R.A. (2005). On the Adaptation of An Agile Information(Suren) Systems Development Method. ''Journal of Database Management Special issue on Agile Analysis, Design, and Implementation, 16(4),'' 20-24&lt;/ref&gt; The key assumption behind static method adaptation is that the project context is given at the start of a project and remains fixed during project execution. The result is a static definition of the project context. Given such a definition, route maps can be used in order to determine which structured method fragments should be used for that particular project, based on predefined sets of criteria. Dynamic method adaptation, in contrast, assumes that projects are situated in an emergent context. An emergent context implies that a project has to deal with emergent factors that affect relevant conditions but are not predictable. This also means that a project context is not fixed, but changing during project execution. In such a case prescriptive route maps are not appropriate. The practical implication of dynamic method adaptation is that project managers often have to modify structured fragments or even innovate new fragments, during the execution of a project (Aydin et al., 2005).&lt;ref name=&quot;Aydin2005&quot; /&gt;

==Measuring agility==
While agility can be seen as a means to an end, a number of approaches have been proposed to quantify agility. Agility Index Measurements (AIM)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jroller.com/page/bokmann?entry=improving_your_processes_aim_high |title=David Bock's Weblog : Weblog |publisher=Jroller.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; score projects against a number of agility factors to achieve a total. The similarly-named Agility Measurement Index,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1185448.1185509 |title=Agility measurement index |publisher=Doi.acm.org |date= |accessdate=2010-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  scores developments against five dimensions of a software project (duration, risk, novelty, effort, and interaction). Other techniques are  based on measurable goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smr.co.uk/presentations/measure.pdf |title=Assessing Agility |author=Peter Lappo |coauthors=Henry C.T. Andrew |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2010-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another  study using fuzzy mathematics&lt;ref name=&quot;Kurian 2006&quot;&gt;Kurian, Tisni (2006). &quot;Agility Metrics: A Quantitative Fuzzy Based Approach for Measuring Agility of a Software Process&quot;  ''ISAM-Proceedings of International Conference on Agile Manufacturing'06(ICAM-2006)'', Norfolk, U.S.&lt;/ref&gt; has suggested that project velocity can be used as a metric of agility. There are agile self assessments to determine whether a team is using agile practices (Nokia test,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://agileconsortium.blogspot.com/2007/12/nokia-test.html |title=Nokia test, A Scrum specific test |author=Joe Little |publisher=Agileconsortium.blogspot.com |date=2007-12-02 |accessdate=2010-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Karlskrona test,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mark Seuffert, Piratson Technologies, Sweden |url=http://www.piratson.se/archive/Agile_Karlskrona_Test.html |title=Karlskrona test, A generic agile adoption test |publisher=Piratson.se |date= |accessdate=2010-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; 42 points test&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agile-software-development.com/2008/01/how-agile-are-you-take-this-42-point.html |title=How agile are you, A Scrum specific test |publisher=Agile-software-development.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

While such approaches have been proposed to measure agility, the practical application of such metrics has yet to be seen.

==Experience and reception==
One of the early studies reporting gains in quality, productivity, and business satisfaction by using Agile methods was a survey conducted by Shine Technologies from November 2002 to January 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=  http://www.shinetech.com/attachments/104_ShineTechAgileSurvey2003-01-17.pdf |title= Agile Methodologies Survey Results |date=2003 |month=January |publisher= [http://www.shinetech.com Shine Technologies] |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-06-03 |quote=95% [stated] that there was either no effect or a cost reduction . . . 93% stated that productivity was better or significantly better . . . 88% stated that quality was better or significantly better . . . 83% stated that business satisfaction was better or significantly better}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar survey conducted in 2006 by Scott Ambler, the Practice Leader for Agile Development with IBM Rational's Methods Group reported similar benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=  http://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/191800169;jsessionid=2QJ23QRYM3H4PQE1GHPCKH4ATMY32JVN?queryText=agile+survey |title=Survey Says: Agile Works in Practice |first=Scott |last=Ambler |authorlink=Scott Ambler |date=August 3, 2006 |work=Dr. Dobb's |accessdate=2010-06-03 |quote=Only 6 percent indicated that their productivity was lowered . . .

Agile development has been widely documented (see Experience Reports, below, as well as Beck&lt;ref name=&quot;beck1999&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Beck|first=K.|authorlink=Kent Beck|title=Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change|publisher=Addison-Wesley|location=Boston, MA|year=1999|isbn=0-321-27865-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; pg. 157, and Boehm and Turner&lt;ref name=&quot;boehm2004&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Boehm|first=B.|authorlink=Barry Boehm|coauthors=R.

Some things that may negatively impact the success of an agile project are:

Barry Boehm and Richard Turner suggest that risk analysis be used to choose between adaptive (&quot;agile&quot;) and predictive (&quot;plan-driven&quot;) methods.&lt;ref name=&quot;boehm2004&quot;/&gt; The authors suggest that each side of the continuum has its own ''home ground'' as follows:

Agile home ground:&lt;ref name=&quot;boehm2004&quot;/&gt;
* Low criticality
* Senior developers
* Requirements change often
* Small number of developers
* Culture that thrives on chaos

Plan-driven home ground:&lt;ref name=&quot;boehm2004&quot;/&gt;
* High criticality
* Junior developers
* Requirements do not change often
* Large number of developers
* Culture that demands order

Formal methods:
* Extreme criticality
* Senior developers
* Limited requirements, limited features see Wirth's law
* Requirements that can be modeled
* Extreme quality

===Experience reports===
Agile development has been the subject of several conferences.  Some of these conferences have had academic backing and included peer-reviewed papers, including a peer-reviewed experience report track.  The experience reports share industry experiences with agile software development.

As of 2006, experience reports have been or will be presented at the following conferences&lt;!-- better links to reports needed; also need clarification of which conferences were peer-reviewed and which have academic credentials --&gt;:

'''Rapid application development''' ('''RAD''') refers to a type of software development methodology that uses minimal planning in favor of rapid prototyping. The &quot;planning&quot; of software developed using RAD is interleaved with writing the software itself. The lack of extensive pre-planning generally allows software to be written much faster, and makes it easier to change requirements.

== Overview ==
Rapid application development is a software development methodology that involves methods like iterative development and software prototyping. According to Whitten (2004), it is a merger of various structured techniques, especially data-driven Information Engineering, with prototyping techniques to accelerate software systems development.&lt;ref name=&quot;WBD04&quot;&gt;Whitten, Jeffrey L.; Lonnie D. Bentley, Kevin C. Dittman. (2004). ''Systems Analysis and Design Methods''. 6th edition. ISBN 025619906X.&lt;/ref&gt;  

In rapid application development, structured techniques and prototyping are especially used to define users' requirements and to design the final system. The development process starts with the development of preliminary data models and business process models using structured techniques. In the next stage, requirements are verified using prototyping, eventually to refine the data and process models. These stages are repeated iteratively; further development results in &quot;a combined business requirements and technical design statement to be used for constructing new systems&quot;.&lt;ref name=WBD04/&gt;     

RAD approaches may entail compromises in functionality and performance in exchange for enabling faster development and facilitating application maintenance.

== History ==
Rapid application development is a term originally used to describe a software development process introduced by James Martin in 1991. Martin's methodology involves iterative development and the construction of prototypes. More recently, the term and its acronym have come to be used in a broader, general sense that encompasses a variety of methods aimed at speeding application development, such as the use of software frameworks of varied types, such as web application frameworks.

Rapid application development was a response to non-agile processes developed in the 1970s and 1980s, such as the Structured Systems Analysis and Design Method and other Waterfall models. One problem with previous methodologies was that applications took so long to build that requirements had changed before the system was complete, resulting in inadequate or even unusable systems. Another problem was the assumption that a methodical requirements analysis phase alone would identify all the critical requirements. Ample evidence{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} attests to the fact that this is seldom the case, even for projects with highly experienced professionals at all levels.

Starting with the ideas of Brian Gallagher, Alex Balchin, Barry Boehm and Scott Shultz, James Martin developed the rapid application development approach during the 1980s at IBM and finally formalized it by publishing a book in 1991, ''Rapid Application Development''.

== Relative effectiveness ==
The shift from traditional session-based client/server development to open sessionless and collaborative development like Web 2.0 has increased the need for faster iterations through the phases of the SDLC.&lt;ref name=&quot;RAD1&quot;&gt;Maurer and S. Martel. (2002). &quot;Extreme Programming: Rapid Development for Web-Based Applications&quot;. IEEE Internet Computing, 6(1) pp 86-91 January/February 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;  This, coupled with the growing use of open source frameworks and products in core commercial development, has, for many developers, rekindled interest in finding a silver bullet RAD methodology.

Although most RAD methodologies foster software re-use, small team structure and distributed system development, most RAD practitioners recognize that, ultimately, no one “rapid” methodology can provide an order of magnitude improvement over any other development methodology. 

All types of RAD have the potential for providing a good framework for faster product development with improved software quality, but successful implementation and benefits often hinge on project type, schedule, software release cycle and corporate culture. It may also be of interest that some of the largest software vendors such as Microsoft&lt;ref name=&quot;SpecsOnLine&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Proceedings of International Conference of Software Engineering, Portland, OR, pp. 564-569, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; do not extensively use RAD in the development of their flagship products and for the most part, they still primarily rely on traditional waterfall methodologies with some degree of spiraling.&lt;ref name=&quot;RAD3&quot;&gt;M.

== Criticism ==
Since rapid application development is an iterative and incremental process, it can lead to a succession of prototypes that never culminate in a satisfactory production application. Such failures may be avoided if the application development tools are robust, flexible, and put to proper use. This is addressed in methods such as the 2080 Development method or other post-agile variants.

== Practical implications ==

When organizations adopt rapid development methodologies, care must be taken to avoid role and responsibility confusion and communication breakdown within a development team, and between team and client. In addition, especially in cases where the client is absent or not able to participate with authority in the development process, the system analyst should be endowed with this authority on behalf of the client to ensure
appropriate prioritisation of non-functional requirements. Furthermore, no increment of the system should be developed without a thorough and formally documented design phase.&lt;ref&gt;Gerber, Aurona; Van der Merwe, Alta; Alberts, Ronell; (2007), Implications of Rapid Development Methodologies, CSITEd 2007, Mauritius, November 2007 [http://ksg.meraka.org.za/~agerber/publications.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Extreme Programming''' (XP) is a software development methodology which is intended to improve software quality and responsiveness to changing customer requirements.  As a type of agile software development,&lt;ref name=&quot;Informatics85&quot;&gt;&lt;!--

it advocates frequent &quot;releases&quot; in short development cycles (timeboxing), which is intended to improve productivity and introduce checkpoints where new customer requirements can be adopted.

Other elements of extreme programming include: programming in pairs or doing extensive code review, unit testing of all code, avoiding programming of features until they are actually needed, a flat management structure, simplicity and clarity in code, expecting changes in the customer's requirements as time passes and the problem is better understood, and frequent communication with the customer and among programmers.&lt;ref name=&quot;UPenn49&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  The methodology takes its name from the idea that the beneficial elements of traditional software engineering practices are taken to &quot;extreme&quot; levels, on the theory that if some is good, more is better.  It is unrelated to &quot;cowboy coding&quot;, which is more free-form and unplanned.  It does not advocate &quot;death march&quot; work schedules, but instead working at a sustainable pace.&lt;ref name=&quot;tr&quot;/&gt;

Critics have noted several potential drawbacks,&lt;ref name=Cworld92/&gt; including problems with unstable requirements, no documented compromises of user conflicts, and a lack of an overall design specification or document.

== History ==
Extreme Programming was created by Kent Beck during his work on the Chrysler Comprehensive Compensation System (C3) payroll project.&lt;ref name=Cworld92/&gt; Beck became the C3 project leader in March 1996 and began to refine the development method used in the project and wrote a book on the method (in October 1999, ''Extreme Programming Explained'' was published).&lt;ref name=&quot;Cworld92&quot;&gt;
  &quot;Extreme Programming&quot;, ''Computerworld'' (online),
  December 2001, webpage: [http://www.computerworld.com/softwaretopics/software/appdev/story/0,10801,66192,00.html Computerworld-appdev-92].
&lt;/ref&gt;
Chrysler cancelled the C3 project in February 2000, after the company was acquired by Daimler-Benz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | coauthors=Matt Stephens, Doug Rosenberg | title=Extreme Programming Refactored: The Case Against XP | isbn=1590590961 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although extreme programming itself is relatively new, many of its practices have been around for some time; the methodology, after all, takes &quot;best practices&quot; to extreme levels. For example, the &quot;practice of test-first development, planning and writing tests before each micro-increment&quot; was used as early as NASA's Project Mercury, in the early 1960s {{Harvard citation | Larman | 2003}}. To shorten the total development time, some formal test documents (such as for acceptance testing) have been developed in parallel (or shortly before) the software is ready for testing. A NASA independent test group can write the test procedures, based on formal requirements and logical limits, before the software has been written and integrated with the hardware. In XP, this concept is taken to the extreme level by writing automated tests (perhaps inside of software modules) which validate the operation of even small sections of software coding, rather than only testing the larger features. Some other XP practices, such as refactoring, modularity, bottom-up design, and incremental design were described by Leo Brodie in his book published in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Brodie | first=Leo | coauthors= | editor= | others= | title=Thinking Forth | origdate= | origyear= | origmonth= | url=http://thinking-forth.sourceforge.net | format=paperback | accessdate=2006-06-19 | edition= | date= | year=1984 | month= | publisher=Prentice-Hall | location=  | isbn=0-13-917568-7 | pages= | chapter= | chapterurl= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Origins ===
Software development in the 1990s was shaped by two major influences: internally, object-oriented programming replaced procedural programming as the programming paradigm favored by some in the industry; externally, the rise of the Internet and the dot-com boom emphasized speed-to-market and company-growth as competitive business factors. Rapidly-changing requirements demanded shorter product life-cycles, and were often incompatible with traditional methods of software development.

The Chrysler Comprehensive Compensation System was started in order to determine the best way to use object technologies, using the payroll systems at Chrysler as the object of research, with Smalltalk as the language and GemStone as the data access layer. They brought in Kent Beck,&lt;ref name=Cworld92/&gt; a prominent Smalltalk practitioner, to do performance tuning on the system, but his role expanded as he noted several problems they were having with their development process. He took this opportunity to propose and implement some changes in their practices based on his work with his frequent collaborator, Ward Cunningham. Beck describes the early conception of the methods:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=20972 Interview with Kent Beck and Martin Fowler]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The first time I was asked to lead a team, I asked them to do a little bit of the things I thought were sensible, like testing and reviews. The second time there was a lot more on the line. I thought, &quot;Damn the torpedoes, at least this will make a good article,&quot; [and] asked the team to crank up all the knobs to 10 on the things I thought were essential and leave out everything else.}}

Beck invited Ron Jeffries to the project to help develop and refine these methods. Jeffries thereafter acted as a coach to instill the practices as habits in the C3 team.

Information about the principles and practices behind XP was disseminated to the wider world through discussions on the original Wiki, Cunningham's WikiWikiWeb. Various contributors discussed and expanded upon the ideas, and some spin-off methodologies resulted (see agile software development). Also, XP concepts have been explained, for several years, using a hypertext system map on the XP website at &quot;http://www.extremeprogramming.org&quot; circa 1999.

Beck edited a series of books on XP, beginning with his own ''Extreme Programming Explained'' (1999, ISBN 0-201-61641-6), spreading his ideas to a much larger, yet very receptive, audience. Authors in the series went through various aspects attending XP and its practices. Even a book was written, critical of the practices.

=== Current state ===
XP created quite a buzz in the late 1990s and early 2000s, seeing adoption in a number of environments radically different from its origins.

The high discipline required by the original practices often went by the wayside, causing some of these practices, such as those thought too rigid, to be deprecated or reduced, or even left unfinished, on individual sites. For example, the practice of end-of-day integration tests, for a particular project, could be changed to an end-of-week schedule, or simply reduced to mutually agreed dates. Such a more relaxed schedule could avoid people feeling rushed to generate artificial stubs just to pass the end-of-day testing. A less rigid schedule allows, instead, for some complex features to be more fully developed over a several-day period. However, some level of periodic integration testing can detect groups of people working in non-compatible, tangent efforts before too much work is invested in divergent, wrong directions.

Meanwhile, other agile development practices have not stood still, and XP is still evolving, assimilating more lessons from experiences in the field, to use other practices. In the second edition of ''Extreme Programming Explained'', Beck added more values and practices and differentiated between primary and corollary practices.

== Concept ==
=== Goals ===
''Extreme Programming Explained'' describes Extreme Programming as a software development discipline that organizes people to produce higher quality software more productively.

In traditional system development methods (such as SSADM or the waterfall model) the requirements for the system are determined at the beginning of the development project and often fixed from that point on. This means that the cost of changing the requirements at a later stage (a common feature of software engineering projects{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}&lt;!-- Should this be qualified, i.e. &quot;a common feature of BLAH software engineering projects&quot;? --&gt;) will be high. Like other agile software development methods, XP attempts to reduce the cost of change by having multiple short development cycles, rather than one long one.
In this doctrine changes are a natural, inescapable and desirable aspect of software development projects, and should be planned for instead of attempting to define a stable set of requirements.

Extreme programming also introduces a number of basic values, principles and practices on top of the agile programming framework.

=== Activities ===
XP describes four basic activities that are performed within the software development process: coding, testing, listening, and designing. Each of those activities is described below.

==== Coding ====
The advocates of XP argue that the only truly important product of the system development process is code - software instructions a computer can interpret. Without code, there is no working product.

Coding can also be used to figure out the most suitable solution.  Coding can also help to communicate thoughts about programming problems. A programmer dealing with a complex programming problem and finding it hard to explain the solution to fellow programmers might code it and use the code to demonstrate what he or she means. Code, say the proponents of this position, is always clear and concise and cannot be interpreted in more than one way. Other programmers can give feedback on this code by also coding their thoughts.

==== Testing ====
One can not be certain that a function works unless one tests it. Bugs and design errors are pervasive problems in software development.  Extreme programming's approach is that if a little testing can eliminate a few flaws, a lot of testing can eliminate many more flaws.
* Unit tests determine whether a given feature works as intended.  A programmer writes as many automated tests as they can think of that might &quot;break&quot; the code; if all tests run successfully, then the coding is complete.  Every piece of code that is written is tested before moving on to the next feature.
*Acceptance tests verify that the requirements as understood by the programmers satisfy the customer's actual requirements.  These occur in the exploration phase of release planning.

A &quot;testathon&quot; is an event when programmers meet to do collaborative test writing, a kind of brainstorming relative to software testing.

==== Listening ====
Programmers must listen to what the customers need the system to do, what &quot;business logic&quot; is needed.  They must understand these needs well enough to give the customer feedback about the technical aspects of how the problem might be solved, or cannot be solved. Communication between the customer and programmer is further addressed in the Planning Game.

==== Designing ====
From the point of view of simplicity, of course one could say that system development doesn't need more than coding, testing and listening. If those activities are performed well, the result should always be a system that works. In practice, this will not work. One can come a long way without designing but at a given time one will get stuck. The system becomes too complex and the dependencies within the system cease to be clear. One can avoid this by creating a design structure that organizes the logic in the system. Good design will avoid lots of dependencies within a system; this means that changing one part of the system will not affect other parts of the system.

=== Values ===
Extreme Programming initially recognized four values in 1999. A new value was added in the second edition of ''Extreme Programming Explained''. The five values are:

==== Communication ====
Building software systems requires communicating system requirements to the developers of the system. In formal software development methodologies, this task is accomplished through documentation. Extreme programming techniques can be viewed as methods for rapidly building and disseminating institutional knowledge among members of a development team. The goal is to give all developers a shared view of the system which matches the view held by the users of the system. To this end, extreme programming favors simple designs, common metaphors, collaboration of users and programmers, frequent verbal communication, and feedback.

==== Simplicity ====
Extreme Programming encourages starting with the simplest solution. Extra functionality can then be added later. The difference between this approach and more conventional system development methods is the focus on designing and coding for the needs of today instead of those of tomorrow, next week, or next month.  This is sometimes summed up as the &quot;you ain't gonna need it&quot; (YAGNI) approach.&lt;ref name=&quot;tr&quot;&gt;&quot;Everyone's a Programmer&quot; by Clair Tristram.  ''Technology Review'', Nov 2003.  p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of XP acknowledge the disadvantage that this can sometimes entail more effort tomorrow to change the system; their claim is that this is more than compensated for by the advantage of not investing in possible future requirements that might change before they become relevant. Coding and designing for uncertain future requirements implies the risk of spending resources on something that might not be needed. Related to the &quot;communication&quot; value, simplicity in design and coding should improve the quality of communication. A simple design with very simple code could be easily understood by most programmers in the team.

==== Feedback ====
Within extreme programming, feedback relates to different dimensions of the system development:
*Feedback from the system: by writing unit tests,&lt;small&gt;&lt;ref name=Cworld92/&gt;&lt;/small&gt; or running periodic integration tests, the programmers have direct feedback from the state of the system after implementing changes.
*Feedback from the customer: The functional tests (aka acceptance tests) are written by the customer and the testers. They will get concrete feedback about the current state of their system. This review is planned once in every two or three weeks so the customer can easily steer the development.
*Feedback from the team: When customers come up with new requirements in the planning game the team directly gives an estimation of the time that it will take to implement.

Feedback is closely related to communication and simplicity. Flaws in the system are easily communicated by writing a unit test that proves a certain piece of code will break. The direct feedback from the system tells programmers to recode this part. A customer is able to test the system periodically according to the functional requirements, known as ''user stories''.&lt;ref name=Cworld92/&gt; To quote Kent Beck, &quot;Optimism is an occupational hazard of programming, feedback is the treatment.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

==== Courage ====
Several practices embody courage. One is the commandment to always design and code for today and not for tomorrow. This is an effort to avoid getting bogged down in design and requiring a lot of effort to implement anything else. Courage enables developers to feel comfortable with refactoring their code when necessary.&lt;ref name=Cworld92/&gt; This means reviewing the existing system and modifying it so that future changes can be implemented more easily. Another example of courage is knowing when to throw code away: courage to remove source code that is obsolete, no matter how much effort was used to create that source code. Also, courage means persistence: A programmer might be stuck on a complex problem for an entire day, then solve the problem quickly the next day, if only they are persistent.

==== Respect ====
The respect value includes respect for others as well as self-respect. Programmers should never commit changes that break compilation, that make existing unit-tests fail, or that otherwise delay the work of their peers. Members respect their own work by always striving for high quality and seeking for the best design for the solution at hand through refactoring.

Adopting the four earlier values leads to respect gained from others in the team. Nobody on the team should feel unappreciated or ignored. This ensures a high level of motivation and encourages loyalty toward the team and toward the goal of the project. This value is very dependent upon the other values, and is very much oriented toward people in a team.

=== Rules ===
The first version of rules for XP was published in 1999 by Don Wells&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules.html Don Wells]&lt;/ref&gt; at the XP website. 29 rules are given in the categories of planning, managing, designing, coding, and testing. Planning, managing and designing are called out explicitly to counter claims that XP doesn't support those activities.

Another version of XP rules was proposed by Ken Auer&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rolemodelsoftware.com/moreAboutUs/publications/rulesOfXp.php Ken Auer]&lt;/ref&gt; in XP/Agile Universe 2003.  He felt XP was defined by its rules, not its practices (which are subject to more variation and ambiguity). He defined two categories: &quot;Rules of Engagement&quot; which dictate the environment in which software development can take place effectively, and &quot;Rules of Play&quot; which define the minute-by-minute activities and rules within the framework of the Rules of Engagement.

=== Principles ===
The principles that form the basis of XP are based on the values just described and are intended to foster decisions in a system development project. The principles are intended to be more concrete than the values and more easily translated to guidance in a practical situation.

==== Feedback ====
Extreme programming sees feedback as most useful if it is done rapidly and expresses that the time between an action and its feedback is critical to learning and making changes. Unlike traditional system development methods, contact with the customer occurs in more frequent iterations. The customer has clear insight into the system that is being developed. He or she can give feedback and steer the development as needed.

Unit tests also contribute to the rapid feedback principle. When writing code, the unit test provides direct feedback as to how the system reacts to the changes one has made. If, for instance, the changes affect a part of the system that is not in the scope of the programmer who made them, that programmer will not notice the flaw. There is a large chance that this bug will appear when the system is in production.

==== Assuming simplicity ====
This is about treating every problem as if its solution were &quot;extremely simple&quot;. Traditional system development methods say to plan for the future and to code for reusability. Extreme programming rejects these ideas.

The advocates of extreme programming say that making big changes all at once does not work. Extreme programming applies incremental changes: for example, a system might have small releases every three weeks. When many little steps are made, the customer has more control over the development process and the system that is being developed.

==== Embracing change ====
The principle of embracing change is about not working against changes but embracing them. For instance, if at one of the iterative meetings it appears that the customer's requirements have changed dramatically, programmers are to embrace this and plan the new requirements for the next iteration.

== Practices ==
Extreme programming has been described as having 12 practices, grouped into four areas:

=== Fine scale feedback ===
* Pair programming&lt;small&gt;&lt;ref name=Cworld92/&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
* Planning game
* Test-driven development
* Whole team

=== Continuous process ===
* Continuous integration
* Refactoring or design improvement&lt;small&gt;&lt;ref name=Cworld92/&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
* Small releases

=== Shared understanding ===
* Coding standards
* Collective code ownership&lt;small&gt;&lt;ref name=Cworld92/&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
* Simple design&lt;small&gt;&lt;ref name=Cworld92/&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
* System metaphor

=== Programmer welfare ===
* Sustainable pace

=== Coding ===
* The customer is always available
* Code the Unit test first
* Only one pair integrates code at a time
* Leave Optimization till last
* No Overtime

=== Testing ===
* All code must have Unit tests
* All code must pass all Unit tests before it can be released.
* When a Bug is found tests are created before the bug is addressed (a bug is not an error in logic, it is a test you forgot to write)
* Acceptance tests are run often and the results are published

== Controversial aspects ==
The practices in XP have been heavily debated.&lt;ref name=Cworld92/&gt; Proponents of extreme programming claim that by having the on-site customer&lt;small&gt;&lt;ref name=Cworld92/&gt;&lt;/small&gt; request changes informally, the process becomes flexible, and saves the cost of formal overhead. Critics of XP claim this can lead to costly rework and project scope creep beyond what was previously agreed or funded.

Change control boards are a sign that there are potential conflicts in project objectives and constraints between multiple users. XP's expedited methodology is somewhat dependent on programmers being able to assume a unified client viewpoint so the programmer can concentrate on coding rather than documentation of compromise objectives and constraints. This also applies when multiple programming organizations are involved, particularly organizations which compete for shares of projects.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

Other potentially controversial aspects of extreme programming include:
* Requirements are expressed as automated acceptance tests rather than specification documents.
* Requirements are defined incrementally, rather than trying to get them all in advance.
* Software developers are usually required to work in pairs.
* There is no Big Design Up Front. Most of the design activity takes place on the fly and incrementally, starting with &lt;span id=&quot;SimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&quot;the simplest thing that could possibly work&quot; and adding complexity only when it's required by failing tests. Critics compare this to &quot;debugging a system into appearance&quot; and fear this will result in more re-design effort than only re-designing when requirements change.
* A customer representative is attached to the project. This role can become a single-point-of-failure for the project, and some people have found it to be a source of stress. Also, there is the danger of micro-management by a non-technical representative trying to dictate the use of technical software features and architecture.
* Dependence upon all other aspects of XP: &quot;XP is like a ring of poisonous snakes, daisy-chained together. All it takes is for one of them to wriggle loose, and you've got a very angry, poisonous snake heading your way.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.softwarereality.com/lifecycle/xp/safety_net.jsp The Case Against Extreme Programming: A Self-Referential Safety Net]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scalability===
Historically, XP only works on teams of twelve or fewer people. One way to circumvent this limitation is to break up the project into smaller pieces and the team into smaller groups. It has been claimed that XP has been used successfully on teams of over a hundred developers{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. ThoughtWorks has claimed reasonable success on distributed XP projects with up to sixty people{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}.

In 2004 Industrial Extreme Programming (IXP)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cutter.com/content-and-analysis/resource-centers/agile-project-management/sample-our-research/apmr0502.html Cutter Consortium :: Industrial XP: Making XP Work in Large Organizations&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; was introduced as an evolution of XP. It is intended to bring the ability to work in large and distributed teams. It now has 23 practices and flexible values. As it is a new member of the Agile family, there is not enough data to prove its usability, however it claims to be an answer to what it sees as XP's imperfections.

===Severability and responses===
In 2003, Matt Stephens and Doug Rosenberg published ''Extreme Programming Refactored: The Case Against XP'' which questioned the value of the XP process and suggested ways in which it could be improved. This triggered a lengthy debate in articles, internet newsgroups, and web-site chat areas. The core argument of the book is that XP's practices are interdependent but that few practical organizations are willing/able to adopt all the practices; therefore the entire process fails. The book also makes other criticisms and it draws a likeness of XP's &quot;collective ownership&quot; model to socialism in a negative manner.

Certain aspects of XP have changed since the book ''Extreme Programming Refactored'' (2003) was published; in particular, XP now accommodates modifications to the practices as long as the required objectives are still met. XP also uses increasingly generic terms for processes. Some argue that these changes invalidate previous criticisms; others claim that this is simply watering the process down.

RDP Practice is a technique for tailoring extreme programming. This practice was initially proposed as a long research paper in a workshop organized by Philippe Kruchten and Steve Adolph( See [http://www.lero.ie/apso08/introduction.html APSO workshop] at [http://icse08.upb.de/ ICSE 2008]) and yet it is the only proposed and applicable method for customizing XP. The valuable concepts behind RDP practice, in a short time provided the rationale for applicability of it in industries. RDP Practice tries to customize XP by relying on technique XP Rules.

Other authors have tried to reconcile XP with the older methods in order to form a unified methodology. Some of these XP sought to replace, such as the waterfall method; example: [http://www.lux-seattle.com/resources/whitepapers/waterfall.htm Project Lifecycles: Waterfall, Rapid Application Development, and All That]. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. tried combining XP with the computer programming methodologies of Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI), and Six Sigma. They found that the three systems reinforced each other well, leading to better development, and did not mutually contradict.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sei.cmu.edu/library/assets/jarvis-gristock.pdf Extreme Programming (XP) Six Sigma CMMI].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Extreme programming's initial buzz and controversial tenets, such as pair programming and continuous design, have attracted particular criticisms, such as the ones coming from McBreen&lt;ref name=&quot;mcbreen&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=McBreen|first=P.|title=Questioning Extreme Programming|publisher=Addison-Wesley|location=Boston, MA|year=2003|isbn=0-201-84457-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Boehm and Turner.&lt;ref name=&quot;boehm2004&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Boehm|first=B.|authorlink=Barry Boehm|coauthors=R. Turner|title=Balancing Agility and Discipline: A Guide for the Perplexed|publisher=Addison-Wesley|location=Boston, MA|year=2004|isbn=0-321-18612-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the criticisms, however, are believed by Agile practitioners to be misunderstandings of agile development.&lt;ref name=&quot;sdmagazine1811&quot;&gt;[http://www.sdmagazine.com/documents/s=1811/sdm0112h/0112h.htm sdmagazine]&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular, extreme programming is reviewed and critiqued by Matt Stephens's and Doug Rosenberg's ''Extreme Programming Refactored''.&lt;ref name= &quot;ExtremeProgrammingRefactored&quot;&gt;[http://www.softwarereality.com/ExtremeProgrammingRefactored.jsp Extreme Programming Refactored], Matt Stephens and Doug Rosenberg, Publisher: Apress L.P.&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticisms include:
* A methodology is only as effective as the people involved, Agile does not solve this
* Often used as a means to bleed money from customers through lack of defining a deliverable
* Lack of structure and necessary documentation
* Only works with senior-level developers
* Incorporates insufficient software design
* Requires meetings at frequent intervals at enormous expense to customers
* Requires too much cultural change to adopt
* Can lead to more difficult contractual negotiations
* Can be very inefficient—if the requirements for one area of code change through various iterations, the same programming may need to be done several times over. Whereas if a plan were there to be followed, a single area of code is expected to be written once.
* Impossible to develop realistic estimates of work effort needed to provide a quote, because at the beginning of the project no one knows the entire scope/requirements
* Can increase the risk of scope creep due to the lack of detailed requirements documentation
* Agile is feature driven; non-functional quality attributes are hard to be placed as user stories

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Round-trip engineering (RTE)''' is a functionality of software development tools that synchronizes two or more related software artifacts, such as, source code, models, configuration files, and other documents. The need for round-trip engineering arises when the same information is present in multiple artifacts and therefore an inconsistency may occur if not all artifacts are consistently updated to reflect a given change. For example, some piece of information was added to/changed in only one artifact and, as a result, it became missing in/inconsistent with the other artifacts.

Round-trip engineering is closely related to traditional software engineering disciplines: forward engineering (creating software from specifications), reverse engineering (creating specifications from existing software), and reengieering (understanding existing software and modifying it). Round-trip engineering is often wrongly defined as simply supporting both forward and reverse engineering. In fact, the key characteristic of round-trip engineering that distinguishes it from forward and reverse engineering is the ability to synchronize '''existing''' artifacts that evolved '''concurrently''' by '''incrementally''' updating each artifact to reflect changes made to the other artifacts. Furthermore, forward engineering can be seen as a special instance of RTE in which only the specification is present and reverse engineering can be seen as a special instance of RTE in which only the software is present. Many reengineering activities can also be understood as RTE when the software is updated to reflect changes made to the previously reverse engineered specification.

Another characteristic of round-trip engineering is '''automatic''' update of the artifacts in response to '''automatically''' detected inconsistencies. In that sense, it is different from forward- and reverse engineering which can be both manual (traditionally) and automatic (via automatic generation or analysis of the artifacts). The automatic update can be either '''instantaneous''' or '''on-demand'''. In instantaneous RTE, all related artifacts are immediately updated after each change made to one of them. In on-demand RTE, authors of the artifacts may concurrently evolve the artifacts (even in a distributed setting) and at some point choose to execute matching to identify inconsistencies and choose to propagate some of them and reconcile potential conflicts.

==Examples of round-trip engineering==
Perhaps the most common form of round-trip engineering is synchronization between UML (Unified Modeling Language) models and the corresponding source code. Many commercial tools and research prototypes (e.g., FUJABA) support this form of RTE. Usually, UML class diagrams are supported to some degree; however, certain UML concepts, such as ''associations'' and ''containment'' do not have straightforward representations in many programming languages which limits the usability of the created code and accuracy of code analysis (e.g., containment is hard to recognize in the code). Behavioral parts of UML impose even more challenges for RTE.

A more tractable form of round-trip engineering is implemented in the context of framework application programming interfaces (APIs), whereby a model describing the usage of a framework API by an application is synchronized with that application's code. In this setting, the API '''prescribes''' all correct ways the framework can be used in applications, which allows precise and complete detection of API usages in the code as well as creation of useful code implementing correct API usages. Two prominent RTE implementations in this category are framework-specific modeling languages and Spring Roo.

Round-trip engineering is critical for maintaining consistency among multiple models and between the models and the code in Object Management Group's (OMG) Model-driven architecture. OMG proposed the QVT (query/view/transformation) standard to handle model transformations required for MDA. To date, a few implementations of the standard have been created. (Need to present practical experiences with MDA in relation to RTE).

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Reverse engineering''' is the process of discovering the technological principles of a human made device, object or system through analysis of its structure, function and operation. It often involves taking something (e.g., a mechanical device, electronic component, or software program) apart and analyzing its workings in detail to be used in maintenance, or to try to make a new device or program that does the same thing without using or simply duplicating (without understanding) any part of the original.

Reverse engineering has its origins in the analysis of hardware for commercial or military advantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1109/52.43044 |first=E. J. |last=Chikofsky |lastauthoramp=yes |first2=J. H., II |last2=Cross |title=Reverse Engineering and Design Recovery: A Taxonomy |journal=IEEE Software |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=13–17 |year=1990 |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to &quot;.&quot; for the cite to end in a &quot;.&quot;, as necessary. --&gt; }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose is to deduce design decisions from end products with little or no additional knowledge about the procedures involved in the original production. The same techniques are subsequently being researched for application to legacy software systems, not for industrial or defence ends, but rather to replace incorrect, incomplete, or otherwise unavailable documentation.&lt;ref&gt;A Survey of Reverse Engineering and Program Comprehension. Michael L. Nelson, April 19, 1996, ODU CS 551 - Software Engineering Survey .Furthermore,reverse enginerring concept is use to modify or change premade .dll files in an operating systems&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motivation==
Reasons for reverse engineering:
* Interoperability.
* Lost documentation: Reverse engineering often is done because the documentation of a particular device has been lost (or was never written), and the person who built it is no longer available.  Integrated circuits often seem to have been designed on obsolete, proprietary systems, which means that the only way to incorporate the functionality into new technology is to reverse-engineer the existing chip and then re-design it.
* Product analysis.  To examine how a product works, what components it consists of, estimate costs, and identify potential patent infringement.
* Digital update/correction. To update the digital version (e.g. CAD model) of an object to match an &quot;as-built&quot; condition.
* Security auditing.
* Acquiring sensitive data by disassembling and analysing the design of a system component.&lt;ref name=rfc2828&gt;Internet Engineering Task Force RFC 2828 Internet Security Glossary&lt;/ref&gt;
* Military or commercial espionage. Learning about an enemy's or competitor's latest research by stealing or capturing a prototype and dismantling it.
* Removal of copy protection, circumvention of access restrictions.
* Creation of unlicensed/unapproved duplicates.
* Materials harvesting, sorting, or scrapping.&lt;ref&gt;http://scrappingmetal.blogspot.com/2010/10/reverse-engineering.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* Academic/learning purposes.
* Curiosity.
* Competitive technical intelligence (understand what your competitor is actually doing versus what they say they are doing).
* Learning: learn from others' mistakes. Do not make the same mistakes that others have already made and subsequently corrected.

==Reverse engineering of machines==
As computer-aided design (CAD) has become more popular, reverse engineering has become a viable method to create a 3D virtual model of an existing physical part for use in 3D CAD, CAM, CAE or other software.&lt;ref&gt;T. Varady, R. R. Martin, J. Cox, Reverse Engineering of Geometric Models—An Introduction, Computer Aided Design 29 (4), 255-268, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; The reverse-engineering process involves measuring an object and then reconstructing it as a 3D model.  The physical object can be measured using 3D scanning technologies like CMMs, laser scanners, structured light digitizers or Industrial CT Scanning (computed tomography).  The measured data alone, usually represented as a point cloud, lacks topological information and is therefore often processed and modeled into a more usable format such as a triangular-faced mesh, a set of NURBS surfaces or a CAD model.

Reverse engineering is also used by businesses to bring existing physical geometry into digital product development environments, to make a digital 3D record of their own products or to assess competitors' products. It is used to analyse, for instance, how a product works, what it does, and what components it consists of, estimate costs, and identify potential patent infringement, etc.

Value engineering is a related activity also used by businesses. It involves de-constructing and analysing products, but the objective is to find opportunities for cost cutting.

==Reverse engineering of software==
The term ''reverse engineering'' as applied to software means different things to different people, prompting Chikofsky and Cross to write a paper researching the various uses and defining a taxonomy. From their paper, they state, &quot;Reverse engineering is the process of analyzing a subject system to create representations of the system at a higher level of abstraction.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Chikofsky | first=E.J. | coauthors=J.H. Cross II | year=1990 | month=January | title=Reverse Engineering and Design Recovery: A Taxonomy in IEEE Software | journal=IEEE Computer Society | pages=13–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be seen as &quot;going backwards through the development cycle&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Warden | first=R. | title=Software Reuse and Reverse Engineering in Practice | year=1992 | publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall | location=London, England | pages=283–305}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this model, the output of the implementation phase (in source code form) is reverse-engineered back to the analysis phase, in an inversion of the traditional waterfall model. Reverse engineering is a process of examination only: the software system under consideration is not modified (which would make it re-engineering). Software anti-tamper technology is used to deter both reverse engineering and re-engineering of proprietary software and software-powered systems. In practice, two main types of reverse engineering emerge. In the first case, source code is already available for the software, but higher-level aspects of the program, perhaps poorly documented or documented but no longer valid, are discovered. In the second case, there is no source code available for the software, and any efforts towards discovering one possible source code for the software are regarded as reverse engineering. This second usage of the term is the one most people are familiar with. Reverse engineering of software can make use of the clean room design technique to avoid copyright infringement.

On a related note, black box testing in software engineering has a lot in common with reverse engineering. The tester usually has the API, but their goals are to find bugs and undocumented features by bashing the product from outside.

Other purposes of reverse engineering include security auditing, removal of copy protection (&quot;cracking&quot;), circumvention of access restrictions often present in consumer electronics, customization of embedded systems (such as engine management systems), in-house repairs or retrofits, enabling of additional features on low-cost &quot;crippled&quot; hardware (such as some graphics card chip-sets), or even mere satisfaction of curiosity.

The Certified Reverse Engineering Analyst (CREA) is a certification provided by the IACRB that certifies candidates are proficient in reverse engineering software.

===Binary software===
This process is sometimes termed ''Reverse Code Engineering'', or RCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Chuvakin | first=Anton | coauthors=Cyrus Peikari | edition=1st | title=Security Warrior |accessdate=2006-05-25 | publisher=O'Reilly | year=2004 | month=January}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, decompilation of binaries for the Java platform can be accomplished using Jad. One famous case of reverse engineering was the first non-IBM implementation of the PC BIOS which launched the historic IBM PC compatible industry that has been the overwhelmingly dominant computer hardware platform for many years. An example of a group that reverse-engineers software for enjoyment (and to distribute registration cracks) is CORE which stands for &quot;Challenge Of Reverse Engineering&quot;. Reverse engineering of software is protected in the U.S. by the fair use exception in copyright law.&lt;ref&gt;See {{Cite journal |doi=10.2307/797533 |authorlink=Pamela Samuelson |first=Pamela |last=Samuelson |lastauthoramp=yes |first2=Suzanne |last2=Scotchmer |title=The Law and Economics of Reverse Engineering |volume=111 |journal=Yale Law Journal |issue= 7|pages=1575–1663 |year=2002 |url=http://www.yalelawjournal.org/the-yale-law-journal/content-pages/the-law-and-economics-of-reverse-engineering/ |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to &quot;.&quot; for the cite to end in a &quot;.&quot;, as necessary. --&gt; |jstor=797533 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Samba software, which allows systems that are not running Microsoft Windows systems to share files with systems that are, is a classic example of software reverse engineering,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Samba: An Introduction | url=http://www.samba.org/samba/docs/SambaIntro.html | date=2001-11-27 | accessdate=2009-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; since the Samba project had to reverse-engineer unpublished information about how Windows file sharing worked, so that non-Windows computers could emulate it. The Wine project does the same thing for the Windows API, and OpenOffice.org is one party doing this for the Microsoft Office file formats. The ReactOS project is even more ambitious in its goals, as it strives to provide binary (ABI and API) compatibility with the current Windows OSes of the NT branch, allowing software and drivers written for Windows to run on a clean-room reverse-engineered GPL free software or open-source counterpart.

====Binary software techniques====
Reverse engineering of software can be accomplished by various methods.
The three main groups of software reverse engineering are
#Analysis through observation of information exchange, most prevalent in protocol reverse engineering, which involves using bus analyzers and packet sniffers, for example, for accessing a computer bus or computer network connection and revealing the traffic data thereon. Bus or network behavior can then be analyzed to produce a stand-alone implementation that mimics that behavior. This is especially useful for reverse engineering device drivers. Sometimes, reverse engineering on embedded systems is greatly assisted by tools deliberately introduced by the manufacturer, such as JTAG ports or other debugging means. In Microsoft Windows, low-level debuggers such as SoftICE are popular.
#Disassembly using a disassembler, meaning the raw machine language of the program is read and understood in its own terms, only with the aid of machine-language mnemonics. This works on any computer program but can take quite some time, especially for someone not used to machine code. The Interactive Disassembler is a particularly popular tool.
#Decompilation using a decompiler, a process that tries, with varying results, to recreate the source code in some high-level language for a program only available in machine code or bytecode.

==Source code==
A number of UML tools refer to the process of importing and analysing source code to generate UML diagrams as &quot;reverse engineering&quot;. See List of UML tools.

==Reverse engineering of protocols==

Protocols are sets of rules that describe message formats and how messages are exchanged (i.e., the protocol state-machine). Accordingly, the problem of protocol reverse-engineering can be partitioned into two subproblems; message format and state-machine reverse-engineering.

The message formats have traditionally been reverse-engineered through a tedious manual process, which involved analysis of how protocol implementations process messages, but recent research proposed a number of automatic solutions &lt;ref&gt;W. Cui, J. Kannan, and H. J. Wang. Discoverer: Automatic protocol reverse engineering from network traces. In Proceedings of 16th USENIX Security Symposium on USENIX Security Symposium, pages 1-14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. Cui, M. Peinado, K. Chen, H. J. Wang, and L. Irún-Briz. Tupni: Automatic reverse engineering of input formats. In Proceedings of the 15th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security, pages 391-402. ACM, Oct 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;M. Comparetti, G. Wondracek pages 110-125&quot;&gt;P. M. Comparetti, G. Wondracek, C. Kruegel, and E. Kirda. Prospex: Protocol specification extraction. In Proceedings of the 2009 30th IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, pages 110-125, Washington, 2009. IEEE Computer Society.&lt;/ref&gt;. Typically, these automatic approaches either group observed messages into clusters using various clustering analyses, or emulate the protocol implementation tracing the message processing.

There has been less work on reverse-engineering of state-machines of protocols. In general, the protocol state-machines can be learned either through a process of offline learning, which passively observes communication and attempts to build the most general state-machine accepting all observed sequnces of messages, and online learning, which allows interactive generation of probing sequences of messages and listening to responses to those probing sequences. In general, offline learning of small state-machines is known to be NP-complete &lt;ref&gt;E. M. Gold. Complexity of automaton identification from given data. Information and Control, 37(3):302-320, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;, while online learning can be done in polynomial time &lt;ref&gt;D. Angluin. Learning regular sets from queries and counterexamples. Information and Computation, 75(2):87-106, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;. An automatic offline approach has been demonstrated by Comparetti at al.&lt;ref name=&quot;M. Comparetti, G. Wondracek pages 110-125&quot;/&gt;. and an online approach very recently by Cho et al.&lt;ref&gt;C.Y. Cho, D. Babic, R. Shin, and D. Song. [http://www.domagoj-babic.com/index.php/Pubs/CCS10botnets Inference and Analysis of Formal Models of Botnet Command and Control Protocols], 2010 ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Other components of typical protocols, like encryption and hash functions, can be reverse-engineered automatically as well. Typically, the automatic approaches trace the execution of protocol implementations and try to detect buffers in memory holding unencrpyted packets &lt;ref&gt;[http://bitblaze.cs.berkeley.edu/papers/polyglot_ccs07_av.pdf   Polyglot: automatic extraction of protocol message format using dynamic binary analysis]. J. Caballero, H. Yin, Z. Liang, and D. Song. Proceedings of the 14th ACM conference on Computer and communications security, p. 317-329.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Reverse engineering of integrated circuits/smart cards==
Reverse engineering is an invasive and destructive form of analyzing a smart card. The attacker grinds away layer by layer of the smart card and takes pictures with an electron microscope. With this technique, it is possible to reveal the complete hardware and software part of the smart card. The major problem for the attacker is to bring everything into the right order to find out how everything works. Engineers try to hide keys and operations by mixing up memory positions, for example, busscrambling.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Rankl, Wolfgang Effing, Smart Card Handbook (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T. Welz: Smart cards as methods for payment (2008), Seminar ITS-Security Ruhr-Universität Bochum, &quot;http://www.crypto.rub.de/its_seminar_ws0708.html&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;
In some cases, it is even possible to attach a probe to measure voltages while the smart card is still operational. Engineers employ sensors to detect and prevent this attack.&lt;ref&gt;David C. Musker: Protecting &amp; Exploiting Intellectual Property in Electronics, IBC Conferences, 10 June 1998&lt;/ref&gt; This attack is not very common because it requires a large investment in effort and special equipment that is generally only available to large chip manufacturers. Furthermore, the payoff from this attack is low since other security techniques are often employed such as shadow accounts.

==Reverse engineering for military applications==
Reverse engineering is often used by militaries in order to copy other nations' technologies, devices or information that have been obtained by regular troops in the fields or by intelligence operations. It was often used during the Second World War and the Cold War. Well-known examples from WWII and later include
* Jerry can: British and American forces noticed that the Germans had gasoline cans with an excellent design.  They reverse-engineered copies of those cans.  The cans were popularly known as &quot;Jerry cans&quot;.
* Tupolev Tu-4: Three American B-29 bombers on missions over Japan were forced to land in the USSR.  The Soviets, who did not have a similar strategic bomber, decided to copy the B-29.  Within a few years, they had developed the Tu-4, a near-perfect copy.
* V2 Rocket:  Technical documents for the V2 and related technologies were captured by the Western Allies at the end of the war.  Soviet and captured German engineers had to reproduce technical documents and plans, working from captured hardware, in order to make their clone of the rocket, the R-1, which began the postwar Soviet rocket program that led to the R-7 and the beginning of the space race.
* Vympel K-13/R-3S missile (NATO reporting name '''AA-2 Atoll'''), a Soviet reverse-engineered copy of the AIM-9 Sidewinder, made possible after a Taiwanese AIM-9B hit a Chinese MiG-17 without exploding; amazingly, the missile became lodged within the airframe, the pilot returning to base with what Russian scientists would describe as a university course in missile development.
* BGM-71 TOW Missile: In May 1975, negotiations between Iran and Hughes Missile Systems on co-production of the TOW and Maverick missiles stalled over disagreements in the pricing structure, the subsequent 1979 revolution ending all plans for such co-production. Iran was later successful in reverse-engineering the missile and are currently producing their own copy: the Toophan.
* China has reversed engineered many examples of Western and Russian hardware, from fighter aircraft to missiles and HMMWV cars.

==Legality==
In the United States even if an artifact or process is protected by trade secrets, reverse-engineering the artifact or process is often lawful as long as it is obtained legitimately.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.memagazine.org/contents/current/features/trade101/trade101.html&lt;/ref&gt; Patents, on the other hand, need a public disclosure of an invention, and therefore, patented items do not necessarily have to be reverse-engineered to be studied. (However, an item produced under one or more patents could also include other technology that is not patented and not disclosed.) One common motivation of reverse engineers is to determine whether a competitor's product contains patent infringements or copyright infringements.

The reverse engineering of software in the US is generally illegal because most EULA prohibit it, and courts have found such contractual prohibitions to override the copyright law; see Bowers v. Baystate Technologies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.utsystem.edu/ogc/intellectualproperty/baystatevbowersdiscussion.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.infoworld.com/d/developer-world/contract-case-could-hurt-reverse-engineering-337&lt;/ref&gt; Article 6 of the 1991 EU Computer Programs Directive allows reverse engineering for the purposes of interoperability, but prohibits it for the purposes of creating a competing product, and also prohibits the public release of information obtained through reverse engineering of software.&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31991L0250:EN:HTML&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=KJmNGglq0nwC&amp;pg=PA321&amp;lpg=PA321&amp;dq=e+European+Software+Directive+reverse+engineering&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=D-fjaWSI4Y&amp;sig=47VJ-tdmg8abUjEjEtvYueC4WKU&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=SIGITJDxI8GLswa4kpScCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=e%20European%20Software%20Directive%20reverse%20engineering&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jenkins.eu/articles-general/reverse-engineering.asp#a9&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Requirements analysis''' in systems engineering and software engineering, encompasses those tasks that go into determining the needs or conditions to meet for a new or altered product, taking account of the possibly conflicting requirements of the various stakeholders, such as beneficiaries or users. 

Requirements analysis is critical to the success of a development project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Requirements must be documented, actionable, measurable, testable, related to identified business needs or opportunities, and defined to a level of detail sufficient for system design. Requirements can be architectural, structural, behavioral, functional, and non-functional.  

== Overview ==
Conceptually, requirements analysis includes three types of activity:
*Eliciting requirements: the task of communicating with customers and users to determine what their requirements are. This is sometimes also called requirements gathering.
*Analyzing requirements: determining whether the stated requirements are unclear, incomplete, ambiguous, or contradictory, and then resolving these issues.
*Recording requirements: Requirements might be documented in various forms, such as natural-language documents, use cases, user stories, or process specifications.

Requirements analysis can be a long and arduous process during which many delicate psychological skills are involved. New systems change the environment and relationships between people, so it is important to identify all the stakeholders, take into account all their needs and ensure they understand the implications of the new systems. Analysts can employ several techniques to elicit the requirements from the customer. Historically, this has included such things as holding interviews, or holding focus groups (more aptly named in this context as requirements workshops) and creating requirements lists. More modern techniques include prototyping, and use cases. Where necessary, the analyst will employ a combination of these methods to establish the exact requirements of the stakeholders, so that a system that meets the business needs is produced.

== Requirements engineering ==
Systematic requirements analysis is also known as '' requirements engineering''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes referred to loosely by names such as ''requirements gathering'', ''requirements capture'', or requirements specification. The term ''requirements analysis'' can also be applied specifically to the analysis proper, as opposed to elicitation or documentation of the requirements, for instance. Requirements Engineering can be divided into discrete chronological steps:
* Requirements elicitation,
* Requirements analysis and negotiation,
* Requirements specification,
* System modeling,
* Requirements validation,
* Requirements management.
Requirement engineering according to Laplante (2007) is &quot;a subdiscipline of systems engineering and software engineering that is concerned with determining the goals, functions, and constraints of hardware and software systems.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;PAL07&quot;&gt;Phillip A. Laplante (2007) ''What Every Engineer Should Know about Software Engineering''. Page 44.&lt;/ref&gt; In some life cycle models, the requirement engineering process begins with a feasibility study activity, which leads to a feasibility report. If the feasibility study suggests that the product should be developed, then requirement analysis can begin. If requirement analysis precedes feasibility studies, which may foster outside the box thinking, then feasibility should be determined before requirements are finalized.

== Requirements analysis topics ==
=== Stakeholder identification ===
See Stakeholder analysis for a discussion of business uses.
Stakeholders (SH) are people or organizations (legal entities such as companies, standards bodies) which have a valid interest in the system. They may be affected by it either directly or indirectly.
A major new emphasis in the 1990s was a focus on the identification of ''stakeholders''. It is increasingly recognized that stakeholders are not limited to the organization employing the analyst. Other stakeholders will include:
* anyone who operates the system (normal and maintenance operators)
* anyone who benefits from the system (functional, political, financial and social beneficiaries)
* anyone involved in purchasing or procuring the system. In a mass-market product organization, product management, marketing and sometimes sales act as surrogate consumers (mass-market customers) to guide development of the product
* organizations which regulate aspects of the system (financial, safety, and other regulators)
* people or organizations opposed to the system (negative stakeholders; see also Misuse case)
* organizations responsible for systems which interface with the system under design
* those organizations who integrate horizontally with the organization for whom the analyst is designing the system

=== Stakeholder interviews ===
Stakeholder interviews are a common technique used in requirement analysis. Though they are generally idiosyncratic in nature and focused upon the perspectives and perceived needs of the stakeholder, very often without larger enterprise or system context, this perspective deficiency has the general advantage of obtaining a much richer understanding of the stakeholder's unique business processes, decision-relevant business rules, and perceived needs. Consequently this technique can serve as a means of obtaining the highly focused knowledge that is often not elicited in Joint Requirements Development sessions, where the stakeholder's attention is compelled to assume a more cross-functional context. Moreover, the in-person nature of the interviews provides a more relaxed environment where lines of thought may be explored at length.

=== Joint Requirements Development (JRD) Sessions ===
Requirements often have cross-functional implications that are unknown to individual stakeholders and often missed or incompletely defined during stakeholder interviews. These cross-functional implications can be elicited by conducting JRD sessions in a controlled environment, facilitated by a trained facilitator, wherein stakeholders participate in discussions to elicit requirements, analyze their details and uncover cross-functional implications. A dedicated scribe and Business Analyst should be present to document the discussion. Utilizing the skills of a trained facilitator to guide the discussion frees the Business Analyst to focus on the requirements definition process.

JRD Sessions are analogous to  Joint Application Design Sessions. In the former, the sessions elicit requirements that guide design, whereas the latter elicit the specific design features to be implemented in satisfaction of elicited requirements.

=== Contract-style requirement lists ===
One traditional way of documenting requirements has been contract style requirement lists. In a complex system such requirements lists can run to hundreds of pages.

An appropriate metaphor would be an extremely long shopping list. Such lists are very much out of favour in modern analysis; as they have proved spectacularly unsuccessful at achieving their aims; but they are still seen to this day.

=====Strengths=====
* Provides a checklist of requirements.
* Provide a contract between the project sponsor(s) and developers.
* For a large system can provide a high level description.

=====Weaknesses=====
* Such lists can run to hundreds of pages. It is virtually impossible to read such documents as a whole and have a coherent understanding of the system.
* Such requirements lists abstract all the requirements and so there is little context
:* This abstraction makes it impossible to see how the requirements fit or work together.
:* This abstraction makes it difficult to prioritize requirements properly; while a list does make it easy to prioritize each individual item, removing one item out of context can render an entire use case or business requirement useless.
:* This abstraction increases the likelihood of misinterpreting the requirements; as more people read them, the number of (different) interpretations of the envisioned system increase.
:* This abstraction means that it's extremely difficult to be sure that you have the majority of the requirements. Necessarily, these documents speak in generality; but the devil, as they say, is in the details.
* These lists create a false sense of mutual understanding between the stakeholders and developers.
* These contract style lists give the stakeholders a false sense of security that the developers must achieve certain things. However, due to the nature of these lists, they inevitably miss out crucial requirements which are identified later in the process. Developers can use these discovered requirements to renegotiate the terms and conditions in their favour.
* These requirements lists are no help in system design, since they do not lend themselves to application.

=====Alternative to requirement lists=====
As an alternative to the large, pre-defined requirement lists Agile Software Development uses User stories to define a requirement in every day language.

=== Measurable goals ===
Best practices take the composed list of requirements merely as clues and repeatedly ask &quot;why?&quot; until the actual business purposes are discovered. Stakeholders and developers can then devise tests to measure what level of each goal has been achieved thus far.  Such goals change more slowly than the long list of specific but unmeasured requirements. Once a small set of critical, measured goals has been established, rapid prototyping and short iterative development phases may proceed to deliver actual stakeholder value long before the project is half over.

===Prototypes===
In the mid-1980s, prototyping was seen as the best solution to the requirements analysis problem. Prototypes are Mockups of an application. Mockups allow users to visualize an application that hasn't yet been constructed. Prototypes help users get an idea of what the system will look like, and make it easier for users to make design decisions without waiting for the system to be built. Major improvements in communication between users and developers were often seen with the introduction of prototypes. Early views of applications led to fewer changes later and hence reduced overall costs considerably.

However, over the next decade, while proving a useful technique, prototyping did not solve the requirements problem:
* Managers, once they see a prototype, may have a hard time understanding that the finished design will not be produced for some time.
* Designers often feel compelled to use patched together prototype code in the real system, because they are afraid to 'waste time' starting again.
* Prototypes principally help with design decisions and user interface design. However, they can not tell you what the requirements originally were.
* Designers and end-users can focus too much on user interface design and too little on producing a system that serves the business process.
* Prototypes work well for user interfaces, screen layout and screen flow but are not so useful for batch or asynchronous processes which may involve complex database updates and/or calculations. 

Prototypes can be flat diagrams (often referred to as wireframes) or working applications using synthesized functionality. Wireframes are made in a variety of graphic design documents, and often remove all color from the design (i.e. use a greyscale color palette) in instances where the final software is expected to have graphic design applied to it. This helps to prevent confusion over the final visual look and feel of the application.

===Use cases===
A use case is a technique for documenting the potential requirements of a new system or software change.  Each use case provides one or more ''scenarios'' that convey how the system should interact with the end-user or another system to achieve a specific business goal.  Use cases typically avoid technical jargon, preferring instead the language of the end-user or ''domain expert''.  Use cases are often co-authored by requirements engineers and stakeholders.

Use cases are deceptively simple tools for describing the behavior of software or systems. A use case contains a textual description of all of the ways which the intended users could work with the software or system. Use cases do not describe any internal workings of the system, nor do they explain how that system will be implemented. They simply show the steps that a user follows to perform a task. All the ways that users interact with a system can be described in this manner.

===Software requirements specification===
A software requirements specification (SRS) is a complete description of the behavior of the system to be developed. It includes a set of use cases that describe all of the interactions that the users will have with the software.  Use cases are also known as functional requirements.  In addition to use cases, the SRS also contains nonfunctional (or supplementary) requirements. Non-functional requirements are requirements which impose constraints on the design or implementation (such as performance requirements, quality standards, or design constraints).

Recommended approaches for the specification of software requirements are described by IEEE 830-1998. This standard describes possible structures, desirable contents, and qualities of a software requirements specification.

== Types of Requirements ==
Requirements are categorized in several ways. The following are common categorizations of requirements that relate to technical management:&lt;ref name=&quot;SEF01&quot;/&gt; 

;Customer Requirements : Statements of fact and assumptions that define the expectations of the system in terms of mission objectives, environment, constraints, and measures of effectiveness and suitability (MOE/MOS). The customers are those that perform the eight primary functions of systems engineering, with special emphasis on the operator as the key customer. Operational requirements will define the basic need and, at a minimum, answer the questions posed in the following listing:&lt;ref name=&quot;SEF01&quot;/&gt;

*''Operational distribution or deployment'': Where will the system be used?
*''Mission profile or scenario'': How will the system accomplish its mission objective?
*''Performance and related parameters'': What are the critical system parameters to accomplish the mission?
*''Utilization environments'': How are the various system components to be used?
*''Effectiveness requirements'': How effective or efficient must the system be in performing its mission?
*''Operational life cycle'': How long will the system be in use by the user?
*''Environment'': What environments will the system be expected to operate in an effective manner?

; Architectural Requirements
: Architectural requirements explain what has to be done by identifying the necessary system architecture of a system.
; Structural Requirements
: Structural requirements explain what has to be done by identifying the necessary structure of a system.
; Behavioral Requirements
: Behavioral requirements explain what has to be done by identifying the necessary behavior of a system.
; Functional Requirements
: Functional requirements explain what has to be done by identifying the necessary task, action or activity that must be accomplished. Functional requirements analysis will be used as the toplevel functions for functional analysis.&lt;ref name=&quot;SEF01&quot;/&gt;
; Non-functional Requirements
: Non-functional requirements are requirements that specify criteria that can be used to judge the operation of a system, rather than specific behaviors.
; Performance Requirements
: The extent to which a mission or function must be executed; generally measured in terms of quantity, quality, coverage, timeliness or readiness. During requirements analysis, performance (how well does it have to be done) requirements will be interactively developed across all identified functions based on system life cycle factors; and characterized in terms of the degree of certainty in their estimate, the degree of criticality to system success, and their relationship to other requirements.&lt;ref name=&quot;SEF01&quot;/&gt;
; Design Requirements
: The “build to,” “code to,” and “buy to” requirements for products and “how to execute” requirements for processes expressed in technical data packages and technical manuals.&lt;ref name=&quot;SEF01&quot;/&gt;
; Derived Requirements
: Requirements that are implied or transformed from higher-level requirement. For example, a requirement for long range or high speed may result in a design requirement for low weight.&lt;ref name=&quot;SEF01&quot;/&gt;
; Allocated Requirements
: A requirement that is established by dividing or otherwise allocating a high-level requirement into multiple lower-level requirements. Example: A 100-pound item that consists of two subsystems might result in weight requirements of 70 pounds and 30 pounds for the two lower-level items.&lt;ref name=&quot;SEF01&quot;/&gt;

Well-known requirements categorization models include FURPS and FURPS+, developed at Hewlett-Packard.

== Requirements analysis issues==
===Stakeholder issues===
Steve McConnell, in his book ''Rapid Development'', details a number of ways users can inhibit requirements gathering:
* Users do not understand what they want or users don't have a clear idea of their requirements
* Users will not commit to a set of written requirements
* Users insist on new requirements after the cost and schedule have been fixed 
* Communication with users is slow
* Users often do not participate in reviews or are incapable of doing so
* Users are technically unsophisticated
* Users do not understand the development process
* Users do not know about present technology

This may lead to the situation where user requirements keep changing even when system or product development has been started.

===Engineer/developer issues===
Possible problems caused by engineers and developers during requirements analysis are:
* Technical personnel and end-users may have different vocabularies. Consequently, they may wrongly believe they are in perfect agreement until the finished product is supplied.
* Engineers and developers may try to make the requirements fit an existing system or model, rather than develop a system specific to the needs of the client.
* Analysis may often be carried out by engineers or programmers, rather than personnel with the people skills and the domain knowledge to understand a client's needs properly.

===Attempted solutions===
One attempted solution to communications problems has been to employ specialists in  business or system analysis. 

Techniques introduced in the 1990s like prototyping, Unified Modeling Language (UML), use cases, and Agile software development are also intended as solutions to problems encountered with previous methods.

Also, a new class of application simulation or application definition tools have entered the market. These tools are designed to bridge the communication gap between business users and the IT organization — and also to allow applications to be 'test marketed' before any code is produced. The best of these tools offer:
* electronic whiteboards to sketch application flows and test alternatives
* ability to capture business logic and data needs
* ability to generate high fidelity prototypes that closely imitate the final application
* interactivity
* capability to add contextual requirements and other comments
* ability for remote and distributed users to run and interact with the simulation

'''Requirements management''' is the process of documenting, analyzing, tracing, prioritizing and agreeing on requirements and then controlling change and communicating to relevant stakeholders. It is a continuous process throughout a project. A requirement is a capability to which a project outcome (product or service) should conform.

== Overview ==
The purpose of requirements management is to assure the organization documents, verifies and meets the needs and expectations of its customers and internal or external stakeholders&lt;ref name=&quot;Stellman05&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Stellman | first=Andrew | last2=Greene | first2=Jennifer | title=Applied Software Project Management | url=http://www.stellman-greene.com/aspm/ | publisher=O'Reilly Media | year=2005 | isbn=978-0-596-00948-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. Requirements management begins with the analysis and elicitation of the objectives and constraints of the organization. Requirements management further includes supporting planning for requirements, integrating requirements and the organization for working with them (attributes for requirements), as well as relationships with other information delivering against requirements, and changes for these. 

The traceability thus established is used in managing requirements to report back fulfillment of company and stakeholder interests, in terms of compliance, completeness, coverage and consistency. Traceabilities also support change management as part of requirements management in understanding the impacts of changes through requirements or other related elements (e.g., functional impacts through relations to functional architecture), and facilitating introducing these changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ogc.gov.uk/delivery_lifecycle_requirements_management.asp |title=Requirements management |publisher=UK Office of Government Commerce  |accessdate=2009-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Requirements management involves communication between the project team members and stakeholders, and adjustment to requirements changes throughout the course of the project&lt;ref name=&quot;PMBOK08&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge | edition=4th | url=http://www.pmi.org/ | publisher=Project Management Institute | year=2008 | isbn=978-1-933-89051-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. To prevent one class of requirements from overriding another, constant communication among members of the development team is critical. For example, in software development for internal applications, the business has such strong needs that it may ignore user requirements, or believe that in creating use cases, the user requirements are being taken care of.

==Traceability==
Requirements traceability is concerned with documenting the life of a requirement. It should be possible to trace back to the origin of each requirement and every change made to the requirement should therefore be documented in order to achieve traceability. Even the use of the requirement after the implemented features have been deployed and used should be traceable&lt;ref&gt;Gotel, O., Finkelstein, A. An Analysis of the Requirements Traceability Problem Proc. of First International Conference on Requirements Engineering, 1994, pages 94-101&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Requirements come from different sources, like the business person ordering the product, the marketing manager and the actual user. These people all have different requirements for the product. Using requirements traceability, an implemented feature can be traced back to the person or group that wanted it during the requirements elicitation. This can, for example, be used during the development process to prioritize the requirement, determining how valuable the requirement is to a specific user. It can also be used after the deployment when user studies show that a feature is not used, to see why it was required in the first place.

==Requirements activities==
At each stage in a development process, there are key requirements management activities and methods. To illustrate, consider a standard five-phase development process with Investigation, Feasibility, Design, Construction and Test, and Release stages.

===Investigation===
In Investigation, the first three classes of requirements are gathered from the users, from the business and from the development team. In each area, similar questions are asked; what are the goals, what are the constraints, what are the current tools or processes in place, and so on. Only when these requirements are well understood can functional requirements be developed.

A caveat is required here: no matter how hard a team tries, requirements cannot be fully defined at the beginning of the project. Some requirements will change, either because they simply weren’t extracted, or because internal or external forces at work affect the project in mid-cycle. Thus, the team members must agree at the outset that a prime condition for success is flexibility in thinking and operation.

The deliverable from the Investigation stage is a requirements document that has been approved by all members of the team. Later, in the thick of development, this document will be critical in preventing scope creep or unnecessary changes. As the system develops, each new feature opens a world of new possibilities, so the requirements specification anchors the team to the original vision and permits a controlled discussion of scope change.

While many organizations still use only documents to manage requirements, others manage their requirements baselines using software tools. These tools allow requirements to be managed in a database, and usually have functions to automate traceability (e.g., by allowing electronic links to be created between parent and child requirements, or between test cases and requirements), electronic baseline creation, version control, and change management. Usually such tools contain an export function that allows a specification document to be created by exporting the requirements data into a standard document application.

===Feasibility===
In the Feasibility stage, costs of the requirements are determined. For user requirements, the current cost of work is compared to the future projected costs once the new system is in place. Questions such as these are asked: “What are data entry errors costing us now?” Or “What is the cost of scrap due to operator error with the current interface?” Actually, the need for the new tool is often recognized as these questions come to the attention of financial people in the organization.

Business costs would include, “What department has the budget for this?” “What is the expected rate of return on the new product in the marketplace?” “What’s the internal rate of return in reducing costs of training and support if we make a new, easier-to-use system?”

Technical costs are related to software development costs and hardware costs. “Do we have the right people to create the tool?” “Do we need new equipment to support expanded software roles?” This last question is an important type. The team must inquire into whether the newest automated tools will add sufficient processing power to shift some of the burden from the user to the system in order to save people time.

The question also points out a fundamental point about requirements management. A human and a tool form a system, and this realization is especially important if the tool is a computer or a new application on a computer. The human mind excels in parallel processing and interpretation of trends with insufficient data. The CPU excels in serial processing and accurate mathematical computation. The overarching goal of the requirements management effort for a software project would thus be to make sure the work being automated gets assigned to the proper processor. For instance, “Don’t make the human remember where she is in the interface. Make the interface report the human’s location in the system at all times.” Or “Don’t make the human enter the same data in two screens. Make the system store the data and fill in the second screen as needed.”

The deliverable from the Feasibility stage is the budget and schedule for the project.

===Design===
Assuming that costs are accurately determined and benefits to be gained are sufficiently large, the project can proceed to the Design stage. In Design, the main requirements management activity is comparing the results of the design against the requirements document to make sure that work is staying in scope.

Again, flexibility is paramount to success. Here’s a classic story of scope change in mid-stream that actually worked well. Ford auto designers in the early ‘80s were expecting gasoline prices to hit $3.18 per gallon by the end of the decade. Midway through the design of the Ford Taurus, prices had centered to around $1.50 a gallon. The design team decided they could build a larger, more comfortable, and more powerful car if the gas prices stayed low, so they redesigned the car. The Taurus launch set nationwide sales records when the new car came out, primarily because it was so roomy and comfortable to drive.

In most cases, however, departing from the original requirements to that degree does not work. So the requirements document becomes a critical tool that helps the team make decisions about design changes.

===Construction and test===
In the construction and testing stage, the main activity of requirements management is to make sure that work and cost stay within schedule and budget, and that the emerging tool does in fact meet requirements. A main tool used in this stage is  prototype construction and iterative testing. For a software application, the user interface can be created on paper and tested with potential users while the framework of the software is being built. Results of these tests are recorded in a user interface design guide and handed off to the design team when they are ready to develop the interface. This saves their time and makes their jobs much easier.

===Release===
Requirements management does not end with product release. From that point on, the data coming in about the application’s acceptability is gathered and fed into the Investigation phase of the next generation or release. Thus the process begins again.

==Tools==
There exist both desktop and Web-based tools for requirements management. A Web-based requirements tool can be installed at the customer′s datacenter or can be offered as an on-demand requirements management platform which in some cases is completely free.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.incose.org/ProductsPubs/products/rmsurvey.aspx |title=Requirements Management Tools Survey |publisher=International Council on Systems Engineering  |accessdate=2009-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modeling Languages ===
The system engineering modeling language SysML incorporates a requirements diagram allowing the developer to graphically organize, manage, and trace requirements.

=== On-demand requirements management platforms ===
An on-demand requirements management platform is a fully hosted requirements management solution, where the only system requirements would normally be Internet access and a standard Web browser. 

The service would normally include all special hardware and software. Other services may include technology and processes designed to secure your data against physical loss and unauthorized use, 24×7 data availability, and assurance that the service will scale as you add users, applications, and additional activities.

Some on-demand requirements management platforms charge a fee while others are free to use.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''reengineering''' of software was described by Chikofsky and Cross in their 1990 paper&lt;ref&gt;Chikofsky, E. and Cross, J., 1990. Reverse Engineering and Design Recovery: A Taxonomy. IEEE Software, 7(1):13-18.&lt;/ref&gt;, as '''&quot;The examination and alteration of a system to reconstitute it in a new form&quot;'''. Less formally, reengineering is the modification of a software system that takes place after it has been reverse engineered, generally to add new functionality, or to correct errors. 

This entire process is often erroneously referred to as reverse engineering; however, it is more accurate to say that reverse engineering is the initial examination of the system, and reengineering is the subsequent modification.

Re-engineering is mostly used in the context where a legacy system is involved&lt;ref&gt;Asit Kumar Gahalaut et. al. / International Journal of Engineering Science and Technology  Vol. 2(06), 2010, 2296-2303 &lt;/ref&gt;. Software systems are evolving on high rate because there more research to make the better so therefore software system in most cases, legacy software needs to operate on a new computing platform.
''''Re-engineering'''' is a set of activities that are carried out to re-structure a legacy system to a new system with better functionalities and conform to the hardware and software quality constraint.

[[Image:Specification and Levels of Development.jpg|thumb|360px|Systems engineering model of Specification and Levels of Development. During system development a series of specifications are generated to describe the system at different levels of detail. These program unique specifications form the core of the configuration baselines. As shown here, in addition to referring to different levels within the system hierarchy, these baselines are defined at different phases of the design process.&lt;ref name=&quot;SEF01&quot;&gt; [http://www.dau.mil/pubscats/PubsCats/SEFGuide%2001-01.pdf ''Systems Engineering Fundamentals.''] Defense Acquisition University Press, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A '''functional specification''' (also, ''functional spec'', ''specs'', ''functional specifications document (FSD)'', or ''Program specification'') in systems engineering and software development is the documentation that describes the requested behavior of an engineering system. The documentation typically describes what is needed by the system user as well as requested properties of inputs and outputs (e.g. of the software system).

== Overview ==
In systems engineering a specification is a document that clearly and accurately describes the essential technical requirements for items, materials, or services including the procedures by which it can be determined that the requirements have been met. Specifications help avoid duplication and inconsistencies, allow for accurate estimates of necessary work and resources, act as a negotiation and reference document for engineering changes, provide documentation of configuration, and allow for consistent communication among those responsible for the eight primary functions of Systems Engineering. They provide a precise idea of the problem to be solved so that they can efficiently design the system and estimate the cost of design alternatives. They provide guidance to testers for verification (qualification) of each technical requirement.&lt;ref name=&quot;SEF01&quot;/&gt;

A functional specification does not define the inner workings of the proposed system; it does not include the specification how the system function will be implemented.  Instead, it focuses on what various outside agents (people using the program, computer peripherals, or other computers, for example) might &quot;observe&quot; when interacting with the system. A typical functional specification might state the following:

:''When the user clicks the OK button, the dialog is closed and the focus is returned to the main window in the state it was in before this dialog was displayed.''

Such a requirement describes an interaction between an external agent (the user) and the software system.  When the user provides input to the system by clicking the OK button, the program responds (or should respond) by closing the dialog window containing the OK button.

It can be ''informal'', in which case it can be considered as a blueprint or user manual from a developer point of view, or ''formal'', in which case it has a definite meaning defined in mathematical or programmatic terms. In practice, most successful specifications are written to understand and fine-tune applications that were already well-developed, although safety-critical software systems are often carefully specified prior to application development. Specifications are most important for external interfaces that must remain stable.

== Functional specification topics ==
=== Purpose ===
There are many purposes for functional specifications.  One of the primary purposes on team projects is to achieve some form of team consensus on what the program is to achieve before making the more time-consuming effort of writing source code and test cases, followed by a period of debugging.  Typically, such consensus is reached after one or more reviews by the stakeholders on the project at hand after having negotiated a cost-effective way to achieve the requirements the software needs to fulfill.

=== Process ===
In the ordered industrial software engineering life-cycle (waterfall model), functional specification describes what has to be implemented. The next system specification document describes how the functions will be realized using a chosen software environment. In not industrial, prototypical systems development, functional specifications are typically written after or as part of requirements analysis.

When the team agrees that functional specification consensus is reached, the functional spec is typically declared &quot;complete&quot; or &quot;signed off&quot;.  After this, typically the software development and testing team write source code and test cases using the functional specification as the reference.  While testing is performed the behavior of the program is compared against the expected behavior as defined in the functional specification.

== Types of software development specifications ==
* Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture
* Bit specification
* Design specification
* Diagnostic design specification
* Multiboot Specification
* Product design specification

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Obfuscated code''' is source or machine code that has been made difficult to understand for humans. Programmers may deliberately obfuscate code to conceal its purpose (security through obscurity) or its logic to prevent tampering, deter reverse engineering, or as a puzzle or recreational challenge for someone reading the source code. Programs known as ''obfuscators'' transform readable code into obfuscated code using various techniques. Code obfuscation is different in essence from hardware obfuscation, where description and/or structure of a circuit is modified to hide its functionality.

==Overview==
Some languages may be more prone to obfuscation than others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.devx.com/MicrosoftISV/Article/11351 Obfuscation: Cloaking your Code from Prying Eyes]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000291.html Jeff Atwood, May 15 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; C,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kenter.demon.nl/obfuscate.html Obfuscation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; C++,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dreamincode.net/forums/index.php?showtopic=38102 C++ Tutorials - Obfuscated Code - A Simple Introduction | DreamInCode.net&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and Perl&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=291267 Pe(a)rls in line noise]&lt;/ref&gt; are some examples. 

==Recreational obfuscation==

Writing and reading obfuscated source code can be a brain teaser for programmers. A number of programming contests reward the most creatively obfuscated code: the International Obfuscated C Code Contest, Obfuscated Perl Contest, and [http://iorcc.blogspot.com/ International Obfuscated Ruby Code Contest].

Types of obfuscations include simple keyword substitution, use or non-use of whitespace to create artistic effects, and self-generating or heavily compressed programs.

Short obfuscated Perl programs may be used in signatures of Perl programmers.  These are JAPHs (&quot;Just another Perl hacker&quot;).{{fact|date=December 2010}}

===Examples===

This is a winning entry from the International Obfuscated C Code Contest&lt;ref&gt;[The International Obfuscated C Code Contest]&lt;/ref&gt; written by Ian Phillipps in 1988&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ioccc.org/years.html#1988_phillipps &quot;International Obfuscated C Code Winners 1988 - Least likely to compile successfully&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently reverse engineered by Thomas Ball.&lt;ref&gt;[http://research.microsoft.com/~tball/papers/XmasGift/ &quot;Reverse Engineering the Twelve Days of Christmas&quot; by Thomas Ball]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref&gt;Don Libes, ''Obfuscated C and Other Mysteries'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1993, pp 425. ISBN 0-471-57805-3&lt;/ref&gt;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;

&lt;/source&gt;
Modern C compilers don't allow constant strings to be overwritten,
which can be avoided by changing &quot;*M&quot; to &quot;M[3]&quot; and omitting &quot;M=&quot;.

An example of a JAPH:

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
@P=split//,&quot;.URRUU\c8R&quot;;@d=split//,&quot;\nrekcah xinU / lreP rehtona tsuJ&quot;;sub p{
@p{&quot;r$p&quot;,&quot;u$p&quot;}=(P,P);pipe&quot;r$p&quot;,&quot;u$p&quot;;++$p;($q*=2)+=$f=!fork;map{$P=$P[$f^ord
($p{$_})&amp;6];$p{$_}=/ ^$P/ix?$P:close$_}keys%p}p;p;p;p;p;map{$p{$_}=~/^[P.]/&amp;&amp;
close$_}%p;wait until$?;map{/^r/&amp;&amp;&lt;$_&gt;}%p;$_=$d[$q];sleep rand(2)if/\S/;print
&lt;/source&gt;

This slowly displays the text &quot;Just another Perl / Unix hacker&quot;, multiple characters at a time, with delays. An explanation can be found [http://perl.plover.com/obfuscated/ here].

Some Python examples can be found in the [http://www.python.org/doc/faq/programming/#is-it-possible-to-write-obfuscated-one-liners-in-python official Python programming FAQ].

==Disadvantages of obfuscation==
At best, obfuscation merely makes it time-consuming, but not impossible, to reverse engineer a program. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.ias.edu/~boaz/Papers/obf_informal.html &quot;Can We Obfuscate Programs?&quot; by Boaz Barak]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Obfuscating software==
A variety of tools exists to perform or assist with code obfuscation.
These include experimental research tools created by academics, hobbyist tools,
commercial products written by professionals, and open-source software. 
There also exist deobfuscation tools that attempt to perform the reverse
transformation.

Although the majority of commercial obfuscation solutions work by transforming
either program source

== Introduction ==
When you build your house, you would never think about building it without an architect, correct?  However, many medium to large size software projects are build without a software architect.  That seems kind of scary, and you might wonder why?  Well, the role of the software architect has neither been widely understood, nor his necessity been acknowledged.  Even to date there is still no agreement on the precise definition of the term “software architecture”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=SEI|title= How do you define Software Architecture?|url= http://www.sei.cmu.edu/architecture/start/definitions.cfm |year=2006|accessdate=2006-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matthew R. McBride writes, &quot;a software architect is a technically competent system-level thinker, guiding planned and efficient design processes to bring a system into existence.  He is viewed by customers and developers alike as a technical expert.  The architect is the author of the solution, accountable for its success or failure.&quot;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McBride|first=Matthew R.|title=The software architect: essence, intuition, and guiding principles|publisher = ACM|year=2004|location=New York|pages=230-235|isbn=1-58113-833-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term software architecture also refers to documentation of a system's software architecture.  Documenting software architecture facilitates communication between stakeholders, documents early decisions about high-level design, and allows reuse of design components and patterns between projects.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|last=Bass|first=Len|coauthors=Paul Clements, Rick Kazman|title=Software Architecture In Practice, Second Edition|publisher = Addison-Wesley|year=2003|location=Boston|pages=21–24|isbn=0-321-15495-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==== Architecture and Design ====
Software architecture, also described as strategic design, is an activity concerned with global requirements governing ''how'' a solution is implemented such as programming paradigms, architectural styles, component-based software engineering standards, architectural patterns, security, scale, integration, and law-governed regularities.  Functional design, also described as tactical design, is an activity concerned with local requirements governing ''what'' a solution does such as algorithms, design patterns, programming idioms, refactorings, and low-level implementation. 

Architecture is design but not all design is architectural.&lt;ref name=&quot;DSA2&quot;&gt;
{{cite book|last=Clements|first=Paul|coauthors=Felix Bachmann, Len Bass, David Garlan, James Ivers, Reed Little, Paulo Merson, Robert Nord, Judith Stafford|title=Documenting Software Architectures: Views and Beyond, Second Edition|publisher = Addison-Wesley|date=2010|location=Boston|isbn=0321552687}}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, the architect is the one who draws the line between software architecture (architectural design) and detailed design (non-architectural design). There aren't rules or guidelines that fit all cases. Examples of rules or heuristics that architects (or organizations) can establish when they want to distinguish between architecture and detailed design include:
* Architecture is driven by non-functional requirements, while functional design is driven by functional requirements. 
* Pseudo-code belongs in the detailed design document.
* UML component, deployment, and package diagrams generally appear in software architecture documents; UML class, object, and behavior diagrams appear in detailed functional design documents.


== Software Architecture ==
The field of computer science has come across problems associated with complexity since its formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=University of Waterloo|title= A Very Brief History of Computer Science |url=http://www.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~shallit/Courses/134/history.html |year=2006|accessdate=2006-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier problems of complexity were solved by developers by choosing the right data structures, developing algorithms, and by applying the concept of separation of concerns. Although the term “software architecture” is relatively new to the industry, the fundamental principles of the field have been applied sporadically by software engineering pioneers since the mid 1980s. Early attempts to capture and explain software architecture of a system were imprecise and disorganized, often characterized by a set of box-and-line diagrams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering|title= Introduction to the Special Issue on Software Architecture |url=http://csdl2.computer.org/persagen/DLAbsToc.jsp?resourcePath=/dl/trans/ts/&amp;toc=comp/trans/ts/1995/04/e4toc.xml&amp;DOI=10.1109/TSE.1995.10003
|year=2006|accessdate=2006-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1990s there was a concentrated effort to define and codify fundamental aspects of the discipline. Initial sets of design patterns, styles, best practices, description languages, and formal logic were developed during that time.

As a maturing discipline with no clear rules on the right way to build a system, designing software architecture is still a mix of art and science. The “art” aspect of software architecture is because a commercial software system supports some aspect of a business or a mission. How a system supports key business drivers is described via scenarios as non-functional requirements of a system, also known as quality attributes, determine how a system will behave.&lt;ref name=&quot;softwareqa&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=SoftwareArchitectures.com|title= Intro to Software Quality Attributes |url=http://www.softwarearchitectures.com/one/Designing+Architecture/78.aspx |year=2006|accessdate=2006-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every system is unique due to the nature of the business drivers it supports, as such the degree of quality attributes exhibited by a system such as fault-tolerance, backward compatibility, extensibility, reliability, maintainability, availability, security, usability, and such other –ilities will vary with each implementation.&lt;ref name=&quot;softwareqa&quot;/&gt;

The origin of software architecture as a concept was first identified in the research work of Edsger Dijkstra in 1968 and David Parnas in the early 1970s. These scientists emphasized that the structure of a software system matters and getting the structure right is critical. The study of the field increased in popularity since the early 1990s with research work concentrating on architectural styles (patterns), architecture description languages, architecture documentation, and formal methods&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Garlan &amp; Shaw |title= An Introduction to Software Architecture |url= http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/able/ftp/intro_softarch/intro_softarch.pdf |year=1994|accessdate=2006-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Views and UML ===
Although there exist 'architecture description languages' (see below), no consensus exists on which symbol-set or language should be used.  However, as already indicated above, UML is a standard used regularly by architects.  For instance, UML component, deployment, and package diagrams generally appear in software architecture documents.  Thus, the UML is a visual language that is often being used to create software architecture views.

Software architecture views are analogous to the different types of blueprints made in building architecture. A view is a representation of a set of system components and relationships among them. &lt;ref name=&quot;DSA2&quot;/&gt;  Some possible views are:
*Functional/logic view
*Code/module view
*Development/structural view
*Concurrency/process/runtime/thread view
*Physical/deployment/install view
*User action/feedback view
*Data view/data model 

=== Architecture Frameworks ===
There are several architecture frameworks related to the domain of software architecture, most well known being the '4+1' model.  Also the Reference Model of Open Distributed Processing (RM-ODP) and the Service-Oriented Modeling Framework (SOMF) are being used.  Other architectures such as the Zachman Framework, DODAF, and TOGAF relate to the field of Enterprise architecture.

=== Architecture Description Languages ===
Several languages for describing software architectures ('architecture description language' (ADL) in ISO/IEC 42010 / IEEE-1471 terminology) have been devised.  ADLs  are used to describe a Software Architecture. Several different ADLs have been developed by different organizations, including AADL (SAE standard), Wright (developed by Carnegie Mellon), Acme (developed by Carnegie Mellon), xADL (developed by UCI), Darwin (developed by Imperial College London), DAOP-ADL (developed by University of Málaga), and ByADL (University of L'Aquila, Italy). Common elements of an ADL are component, connector and configuration.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''decompiler''' is the name given to a computer program that performs the reverse operation to that of a compiler.  That is, it translates a file containing information at a relatively low level of abstraction (usually designed to be computer readable rather than human readable) into a form having a higher level of abstraction (usually designed to be human readable).

==Introduction==
The term ''decompiler'' is most commonly applied to a program which translates executable programs (the output from a compiler) into source code in a (relatively) high level language which, when compiled, will produce an executable whose behavior is the same as the original executable program. By comparison, a disassembler translates an executable program into assembly language (and an assembler could be used to assemble it back into an executable program).

Decompilation is the act of using a decompiler, although the term, when used as a noun, can also refer to the output of a decompiler. It can be used for the recovery of lost source code, and is also useful in some cases for computer security, interoperability and error correction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.program-transformation.org/Transform/WhyDecompilation |title=Why Decompilation |publisher=Program-transformation.org |date=2005-04-11 |accessdate=2010-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of decompilation depends on the amount of information present in the code being decompiled and the sophistication of the analysis performed on it. The bytecode formats used by many virtual machines (such as the Java Virtual Machine or the .NET Framework Common Language Runtime) often include extensive metadata and high-level features that make decompilation quite feasible. The presence of debug data can make it possible to reproduce the original variable and structure names and even the line numbers. Machine language without such metadata or debug data is much harder to decompile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|contribution=Decompiling Java Bytecode: Problems, Traps and Pitfalls|first1=Jerome|last1=Miecznikowski|first2=Laurie|loast2=Hendren|
pages=111–127|editor=R Nigel Horspool|title=Compiler Construction: 11th International Conference, proceedings / CC 2002|
isbn=3-540-43369-4|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some compilers and post-compilation tools produce obfuscated code (that is, they attempt to produce output that is very difficult to decompile). This is done to make it more difficult to reverse engineer the executable.

==Design==
Decompilers can be thought of as composed of a series of phases each of which contributes specific aspects of the overall decompilation process.

===Loader===
The first decompilation phase loads and parses the input machine code or intermediate language program's binary file format. It should be able to discover basic facts about the input program, such as the architecture (Pentium, PowerPC, etc), and the entry point. In many cases, it should be able to find the equivalent of the &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; function of a C program, which is the start of the user written code. This excludes the runtime initialization code, which should not be decompiled if possible. If available the symbol tables and debug data are also loaded. The front end may be able to identify the libraries used even if they are linked with the code, this will provide library interfaces. If it can determine the compiler or compilers used it may provide useful information in identifying code idioms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Decompilation of Binary Programs|journal=Software Practice and Experience|first1=Cristina|last1=Cifuentes|first2=K. John|last2=Gough|volume=25|issue=7|pages=811–829|year=1995|month=July|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.14.8073&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disassembly===
The next logical phase is the disassembly of machine code instructions into a machine independent intermediate representation (IR). For example, the Pentium machine instruction
    mov    eax, [ebx+0x04]
might be translated to the IR
    eax := m[ebx+4];

===Idioms===
Idiomatic machine code sequences are sequences of code whose combined semantics is not immediately apparent from the instructions' individual semantics. Either as part of the disassembly phase, or as part of later analyses, these idiomatic sequences need to be translated into known equivalent IR. For example, the x86 assembly code:
    cdq    eax             ; edx is set to the sign-extension of eax
    xor    eax, edx
    sub    eax, edx
could be translated to
    eax := abs(eax);

Some idiomatic sequences are machine independent; some involve only one instruction. For example, &lt;code&gt;xor eax, eax&lt;/code&gt; clears the &lt;code&gt;eax&lt;/code&gt; register (sets it to zero). This can be implemented with a machine independent simplification rule, such as &lt;code&gt;a xor a = 0&lt;/code&gt;.

In general, it is best to delay detection of idiomatic sequences if possible, to later stages that are less affected by instruction ordering. For example, the instruction scheduling phase of a compiler may insert other instructions into an idiomatic sequence, or change the ordering of instructions in the sequence. A pattern matching process in the disassembly phase would probably not recognize the altered pattern. Later phases group instruction expressions into more complex expressions, and modify them into a canonical (standardized) form, making it more likely that even the altered idiom will match a higher level pattern later in the decompilation.

It is particularly important to recognize the compiler idioms for subroutine calls, exception handling, and switch statements. Some languages also have extensive support for strings or long integers.

===Program analysis===
Various program analyses can be applied to the IR. In particular, expression propagation combines the semantics of several instructions into more complex expressions. For example,
    mov   eax,[ebx+0x04]
    add   eax,[ebx+0x08]
    sub   [ebx+0x0C],eax
could result in the following IR after expression propagation:
    m[ebx+12] := m[ebx+12] - (m[ebx+4] + m[ebx+8]);
The resulting expression is more like high level language, and has also eliminated the use of the machine register &lt;code&gt;eax&lt;/code&gt; . Later analyses may eliminate the &lt;code&gt;ebx&lt;/code&gt; register.

===Data flow analysis===
The places where register contents are defined and used must be traced using data flow analysis. The same analysis can be applied to locations that are used for temporaries and local data. A different name  can then be formed for each such connected set of value definitions and uses. It is possible that the same local variable location was used for more than one variable in different parts of the original program. Even worse it is possible for the data flow analysis to identify a path whereby a value may flow between two such uses even though it would never actually happen or matter in reality. This may in bad cases lead to needing to define a location as a union of types. The decompiler may allow  the user to explicitly break such unnatural dependencies which will lead to clearer code. This of course means a variable is potentially used without being initialized and so indicates a problem in the original program.

===Type analysis===
A good machine code decompiler will perform type analysis. Here, the way registers or memory locations are used result in constraints on the possible type of the location. For example, an &lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt; instruction implies that the operand is an integer; programs do not use such an operation on floating point values (except in special library code) or on pointers. An &lt;code&gt;add&lt;/code&gt; instruction results in three constraints, since the operands may be both integer, or one integer and one pointer (with integer and pointer results respectively; the third constraint comes from the ordering of the two operands when the types are different).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|contribution=Type-Based Decompilation|title=Programming languages and systems: 8th European Symposium on Programming Languages and Systems
|first1=Alan|last1=Mycroft|editor=S. Doaitse Swierstra|pages=208–223|year=1999|publisher=Springer-Verlag|isbn=3-540-65699-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various high level expressions can be recognized which trigger recognition of structures or arrays. However, it is difficult to distinguish many of the possibilities, because of the freedom that machine code or even some high level languages such as C allow with casts and pointer arithmetic.

The example from the previous section could result in the following high level code:

 struct T1 *ebx;
    struct T1 {
        int v0004; 
        int v0008;
        int v000C;
    };
  ebx-&gt;v000C -= ebx-&gt;v0004 + ebx-&gt;v0008;

===Structuring===
The penultimate decompilation phase involves structuring of the IR into higher level constructs such as &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; loops and &lt;code&gt;if/then/else&lt;/code&gt; conditional statements. For example, the machine code
    xor eax, eax
 l0002:
    or  ebx, ebx
    jge l0003
    add eax,[ebx]
    mov ebx,[ebx+0x4]
    jmp l0002    
 l0003:
    mov [0x10040000],eax

could be translated into:

    eax = 0;
    while (ebx &lt; 0) {
        eax += ebx-&gt;v0000;
        ebx = ebx-&gt;v0004;
    }
    v10040000 = eax;

Unstructured code is more difficult to translate into structured code than already structured code. Solutions include replicating some code, or adding boolean variables.&lt;ref&gt;C. Cifuentes. ''Reverse Compilation Techniques''. PhD thesis, Queensland University of Technology, 1994. (available as [http://www.itee.uq.edu.au/~cristina/dcc/decompilation_thesis.ps.gz compressed postscript Chapter 6])&lt;/ref&gt;

===Code generation===
The final phase is the generation of the high level code in the back end of the decompiler. Just as a compiler may have several back ends for generating machine code for different architectures, a decompiler may have several back ends for generating high level code in different high level languages.

Just before code generation, it may be desirable to allow an interactive editing of the IR, perhaps using some form of graphical user interface. This would allow the user to enter comments, and non-generic variable and function names. However, these are almost as easily entered in a post decompilation edit. The user may want to change structural aspects, such as converting a &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; loop to a &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loop. These are less readily modified with a simple text editor, although source code refactoring tools may assist with this process. The user may need to enter information that failed to be identified during the type analysis phase, e.g. modifying a memory expression to an array or structure expression. Finally, incorrect IR may need to be corrected, or changes made to cause the output code to be more readable.

==Legality==
The majority of computer programs are covered by copyright laws. Although the precise scope of what is covered by copyright differs from region to region, copyright law generally provides the author (the programmer(s) or employer) with a collection of exclusive rights to the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Informtion technology law|first=Diane|last=Rowland|year=2005|edition=3rd|publisher=Cavendish|isbn=1-85941-756-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; These rights include the right to make copies, including copies made into the computer's RAM{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}.
Since the decompilation process involves making multiple such copies, it is generally prohibited without the authorization of the copyright holder. However, because decompilation is often a necessary step in achieving software  interoperability, copyright laws in both the United States and Europe permit decompilation to a limited extent.

In the United States, the copyright fair use defense has been successfully invoked in decompilation cases. For example, in ''[http://digital-law-online.info/cases/24PQ2D1561.htm Sega v. Accolade]'', the court held that Accolade could lawfully engage in decompilation in order to circumvent the software locking mechanism used by Sega's game consoles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.program-transformation.org/Transform/LegalityOfDecompilation |title=The Legality of Decompilation |publisher=Program-transformation.org |date=2004-12-03 |accessdate=2010-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, the [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31991L0250:EN:HTML 1991 Software Directive] explicitly provides for a right to decompile in order to achieve interoperability. The result of a heated debate between, on the one side, software protectionists, and, on the other, academics as well as independent software developers, Article 6 permits decompilation only if a number of conditions are met:

*First, a person or entity must have a license to use the program to be decompiled.
*Second, decompilation must be necessary to achieve interoperability with the target program or other programs. Interoperability information should therefore not be readily available, such as through manuals or API documentation. This is an important limitation. The necessity must be proven by the decompiler. The purpose of this important limitation is primarily to provide an incentive for developers to document and disclose their products' interoperability information.&lt;ref&gt;B. Czarnota and R.J. Hart, ''Legal protection of computer programs in Europe: a guide to the EC directive''. 1991, London: Butterworths.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Third, the decompilation process must, if possible, be confined to the parts of the target program relevant to interoperability. Since one of the purposes of decompilation is to gain an understanding of the program structure, this third limitation may be difficult to meet. Again, the burden of proof is on the decompiler.

In addition, Article 6 prescribes that the information obtained through decompilation may not be used for other purposes and that it may not be given to others.

Overall, the decompilation right provided by Article 6 codifies what is claimed to be common practice in the software industry. Few European lawsuits are known to have emerged from the decompilation right. This could be interpreted as meaning either one of two things: 1) the decompilation right is not used frequently and the decompilation right may therefore have been unnecessary, or 2) the decompilation right functions well and provides sufficient legal certainty not to give rise to legal disputes. In a [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52000DC0199:EN:HTML recent report] regarding implementation of the Software Directive by the European member states, the European Commission seems to support the second interpretation.

== Software Design ==
The result of the software requirements analysis (SRA) usually is a specification.  The design helps us turning this specification into a working system.  As we have seen there are different kinds of software designs, the IEEE Std 610.12-1990 Standard Glossary of Software Engineering Terminology&lt;ref&gt;http://standards.ieee.org/findstds/standard/610.12-1990.html the IEEE Std 610.12-1990, IEEE standard glossary of software engineering terminology&lt;/ref&gt; defines the following distinctions:
* Architectural Design: the process of defining a collection of hardware and software components and their interfaces to establish the framework for the development of a computer system.
* Detailed Design: the process of refining and expanding the preliminary design of a system or component to the extent that the design is sufficiently complete to begin implementation.
* Functional Design: the process of defining the working relationships among the components of a system.
* Preliminary Design: the process of analyzing design alternatives and defining the architecture, components, interfaces, and timing/sizing estimates for a system or components.

Hence software design includes architectural views, but also low-level component and algorithm implementation issues.  Depending on the type, a software design may be platform-independent or platform-specific.

=== Design Considerations ===
There are many aspects to consider in the design of a piece of software.  The importance of each should reflect the goals the software is trying to achieve.  Some of these aspects are:

* '''Compatibility''' - The software is able to operate with other products that are designed for interoperability with another product.  For example, a piece of software may be backward-compatible with an older version of itself.
* '''Extensibility''' - New capabilities can be added to the software without major changes to the underlying architecture.
* '''Fault-tolerance''' - The software is resistant to and able to recover from component failure.
* '''Maintainability''' - The software can be restored to a specified condition within a specified period of time.  For example, antivirus software may include the ability to periodically receive virus definition updates in order to maintain the software's effectiveness.
* '''Modularity''' - the resulting software comprises well defined, independent components. That leads to better maintainability. The components could be then implemented and tested in isolation before being integrated to form a desired software system. This allows division of work in a software development project.
* '''Packaging''' - Printed material such as the box and manuals should match the style designated for the target market and should enhance usability. All compatibility information should be visible on the outside of the package. All components required for use should be included in the package or specified as a requirement on the outside of the package.
* '''Reliability''' - The software is able to perform a required function under stated conditions for a specified period of time.
* '''Reusability''' - the software is able to add further features and modification with slight or no modification.
* '''Robustness''' - The software is able to operate under stress or tolerate unpredictable or invalid input.  For example, it can be designed with a resilience to low memory conditions.
* '''Security''' - The software is able to withstand hostile acts and influences.
* '''Usability''' - The software user interface must be usable for its target user/audience. Default values for the parameters must be chosen so that they are a good choice for the majority of the users.

=== Modeling Language ===
Designers are assisted be the existence of modeling languages. They can be used to express information, knowledge or systems in a structure that is defined by a consistent set of rules. A modeling language can be graphical or textual. Examples of graphical modelling languages for software design are:
* Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a general modeling language to describe software both structurally and behaviorally.  It has a graphical notation and allows for extension with a Profile (UML).
* Flowchart is a schematic representation of an algorithm or a stepwise process,
* Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) is an example of a Process Modeling language.
* Systems Modeling Language (SysML) is a new general-purpose modeling language for systems engineering.

There is quite a few more, but we will concentrate mostly on the UML as we will see in the next chapter.

== Design Patterns ==
If you remember, software engineers speak a common language called UML.  And if we use this analogy of language, then ''design patterns'' are the common stories our culture shares, like for instance fairy tales.  They are stories about commonly occurring problems in software design and their solutions.  And as young children learn about good and evil from fairy tales, beginning software engineers learn about good design (design patterns) and bad design (anti-patterns).  

=== History ===
Patterns originated as an architectural concept by Christopher Alexander (1977/79). In 1987, Kent Beck and Ward Cunningham began experimenting with the idea of applying patterns to programming and presented their results at the OOPSLA conference that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith1987&quot;&gt;{{cite conference

 |year=1987}}, ''&quot;Ward cautioned against requiring too much programming at, what he termed, 'the high level of wizards.' He pointed out that a written 'pattern language' can significantly improve the selection and application of abstractions. He proposed a 'radical shift in the burden of design and implementation' basing the new methodology on an adaptation of Christopher Alexander's work in pattern languages and that programming-oriented pattern languages developed at Tektronix has significantly aided their software development efforts.&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Beck1987&quot;&gt;{{cite conference

Design patterns gained popularity in computer science after the book ''Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software'' was published in 1994 &lt;!-- 1994, not 1995. See talk page. --&gt; by the so-called &quot;Gang of Four&quot; (Gamma et al.).&lt;ref name=&quot;GoF&quot;&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, the first Pattern Languages of Programming Conference was held and the following year, the Portland Pattern Repository was set up for documentation of design patterns. 

=== Definition of a Design Pattern ===
In software engineering, a design pattern is a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. A design pattern is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations. Object-oriented design patterns typically show relationships and interactions between classes or objects, without specifying the final application classes or objects that are involved. 

Design patterns reside in the domain of modules and interconnections. At a higher level there are architectural patterns that are larger in scope, usually describing an overall pattern followed by an entire system.&lt;ref name=&quot;R.C.Martin&quot;&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/Principles_and_Patterns.pdf
 |title=Design Principles and Design Patterns
 |last=Martin
 |first=Robert C.
 |authorlink=Robert C. Martin
 |accessdate=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many types of design patterns: Structural patterns address concerns related to the high level structure of an application being developed. Computational patterns address concerns related to the identification of key computations. Algorithm strategy patterns address concerns related to high level strategies that describe how to exploit application characteristic on a computation platform. Implementation strategy patterns address concerns related to the realization of the source code to support how the program itself is organized and the common data structures specific to parallel programming. Execution patterns address concerns related to the support of the execution of an application, including the strategies in executing streams of tasks and building blocks to support the synchronization between tasks.

=== Examples of Design Patterns ===
Design patterns are easiest understood when looking at concrete examples.  For beginners the following ten patterns may suffice.  However, you should make it a habit to learn about some of the other patterns mentioned below.  The more patterns you know, the better.

==== Factory Method ====
The Factory pattern creates an object from a set of similar classes, based on some parameter, usually a string.  An example, is the creation of a MessageDigest object in Java:

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(&quot;SHA-1&quot;); 	
&lt;/source&gt;

If one changes the parameter to &quot;MD5&quot; for instance, one gets an object that calculates the message digest based on the MD5 algorithm instead.  The advantage of using a parameter is that changing the algorithm does not require us to re-compile our code.  Other examples of this pattern are the loading of the database connection driver in Java using &lt;code&gt;Class.forName(&quot;jdbc.idbDriver&quot;)&lt;/code&gt;, which admittedly is some very odd syntax, but the idea is the same.

==== Abstract Factory ====
Where the Factory pattern only affects one class, the Abstract Factory pattern affects a whole bunch of classes.  A well known example from Java is the Swing Look-and-Feel: 

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
UIManager.setLookAndFeel(&quot;javax.swing.plaf.metal.MetalLookAndFeel&quot;);
&lt;/source&gt;

This looks quite similar to the Factory pattern, but the difference is that now every Swing class that is being loaded is affected, not just one.

==== Singleton ====
This is one of the most dangerous design patterns, when in doubt don't use it. Its main purpose is to guarantee that only one instance of a particular object exists.  Possible applications are a printer manager or a database connection manager.  It is useful when access to a limited resource needs to be controlled.

==== Iterator ====
Nowadays, the Iterator pattern is trivial: it allows you to go through a list of objects, starting at the beginning, iterating through the list one element after the other, until reaching the end.

==== Template Method ====
Also the Template Method pattern is rather simple: as soon as you define an abstract class, that forces its subclasses to implement some method, you are using a simple form of the Template pattern.

==== Command ====
To understand the idea behind the Command pattern consider the following restaurant example: A customer goes to a restaurant and orders some food. The waiter takes the order (command, in this case) and hands it to the cook in the kitchen. In the kitchen the command is executed, and depending on the command different food or drink is being prepared.  

==== Observer ====
The Observer pattern is one of the most popular patterns, and it has many variants.  Assume you have a table in a spreadsheet. That data can be displayed in table form, but also in form of some graph or histogram.  If the underlying data changes, not only the table view has to change, but you also expect the histogram to change. To communicate these changes you can use the Observer pattern: the underlying data is the ''observable'' and the table view as well as the histogram view are ''observers'' that observe the observable.  Another example of the Observer pattern is a button in Swing for instance: here the JButton is the observable, and if something happens to the button (usually this means it was pressed by the user) then the listener (the observer) gets notified.

==== Composite ====
The Composite pattern is very wide spread.  Basically, it is a list that may contain objects, but also lists. A typical example is a file system, which may consist of directories and files.  Here directories may contain files, but also may contain other directories.  Other examples of the Composite pattern are menus that may contain other menus, or in user management one often has users and groups, where groups may contain users, but also other groups.

==== State ====
In the State pattern, an internal state of the object influences its behavior.  Assume you have some drawing program in which you want to be able to draw straight lines and dotted lines.  Instead of creating different classes for lines, you have one Line class that has an internal state called 'dotted' or 'straight' and depending on this internal state either dotted lines or straight lines are drawn.  This pattern is also implicitly used by Java, when setting the font via ’setFont()’ or the color via 'setColor()', for instance.

==== Proxy ====
The idea behind the Proxy pattern is that we have some complex object and we need to make it simpler.  One typical application is an object that exists on another machine, but you want to give the impression as if the user is dealing with a local object.  Another application is when an object would take a long time to create (like loading a large image/video), but the actual object may never be needed.  In this case a proxy represents the object until it is needed.

=== Patterns in Practice ===
Design patterns can speed up the development process by providing tested, proven development paradigms. Effective software design requires considering issues that may not become visible until later in the implementation. Reusing design patterns helps to prevent subtle issues that can cause major problems, and it also improves code readability for coders and architects who are familiar with the patterns.  In addition to this, patterns allow developers to communicate using well-known, well understood names for software interactions. 

In order to achieve flexibility, design patterns usually introduce additional levels of indirection, which in some cases may complicate the resulting designs and hurt application performance.

By definition, a pattern must be programmed anew into each application that uses it. Since some authors see this as a step backward from software reuse as provided by components, researchers have worked to turn patterns into components. Meyer and Arnout were able to provide full or partial componentization of two-thirds of the patterns they attempted.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meyer2006&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Classification and List of Patterns ===
Design patterns were originally grouped into the categories: creational patterns, structural patterns, and behavioral patterns, and described using the concepts of delegation, aggregation, and consultation.  Another classification has also introduced the notion of architectural design pattern that may be applied at the architecture level of the software such as the Model-View-Controller pattern.  The following patterns are taken from ''Design Patterns'' &lt;ref name=&quot;GoF&quot; /&gt; and ''Code Complete'',&lt;ref name=&quot;McConnell2004&quot;&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; unless otherwise stated.


==== Creational patterns ====
* '''Abstract factory:''' Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

* '''Builder:''' Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation allowing the same construction process to create various representations.

* '''Factory method:''' Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

* '''Lazy initialization:''' Tactic of delaying the creation of an object, the calculation of a value, or some other expensive process until the first time it is needed.&lt;ref name=&quot;PoEAA&quot;&gt;

 | title = Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture
 | publisher = Addison-Wesley
 | isbn = 978-0321127426
 | url = http://martinfowler.com/
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Multiton:''' Ensure a class has only named instances, and provide global point of access to them.

* '''Object pool:''' Avoid expensive acquisition and release of resources by recycling objects that are no longer in use. Can be considered a generalisation of connection pool and thread pool patterns.

* '''Prototype:''' Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying this prototype.

* '''Resource acquisition is initialization:''' Ensure that resources are properly released by tying them to the lifespan of suitable objects.

* '''Singleton:''' Ensure a class has only one instance, and provide a global point of access to it.


==== Structural Patterns ====
* '''Adapter or Wrapper:''' Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that could not otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.

* '''Bridge:''' Decouple an abstraction from its implementation allowing the two to vary independently.

* '''Composite:''' Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

* '''Decorator:''' Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically keeping the same interface. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

* '''Facade:''' Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

* '''Front Controller:''' Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Front Controller defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

* '''Flyweight:''' Use sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently.

* '''Proxy:''' Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.


==== Behavioral Patterns ====
* '''Blackboard:''' Generalized observer, which allows multiple readers and writers. Communicates information system-wide.

* '''Chain of responsibility:''' Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than one object a chance to handle the request. Chain the receiving objects and pass the request along the chain until an object handles it.

* '''Command:''' Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.

* '''Interpreter:''' Given a language, define a representation for its grammar along with an interpreter that uses the representation to interpret sentences in the language.

* '''Iterator:''' Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.

* '''Mediator:''' Define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. Mediator promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly, and it lets you vary their interaction independently. 

* '''Memento:''' Without violating encapsulation, capture and externalize an object's internal state allowing the object to be restored to this state later.

* '''Null object:''' Avoid null references by providing a default object.

* '''Observer or Publish/subscribe:''' Define a one-to-many dependency between objects where a state change in one object results with all its dependents being notified and updated automatically.

* '''Servant:''' Define common functionality for a group of classes

* '''Specification:''' Recombinable business logic in a boolean fashion

* '''State:''' Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.

* '''Strategy:''' Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

* '''Template method:''' Define the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses. Template Method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.

* '''Visitor:''' Represent an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure. Visitor lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.


==== Concurrency Patterns ====
Most of the following concurrency patterns are taken from ''POSA2''&lt;ref name=&quot;POSA2&quot;&gt;, unless stated otherwise.

 | title = Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture, Volume 2: Patterns for Concurrent and Networked Objects
 | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons
 | isbn = 0-471-60695-2
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Active Object:''' Decouples method execution from method invocation that reside in their own thread of control. The goal is to introduce concurrency, by using asynchronous method invocation and a scheduler for handling requests.

* '''Balking:''' Only execute an action on an object when the object is in a particular state.

* '''Binding Properties:''' Combining multiple observers to force properties in different objects to be synchronized or coordinated in some way.&lt;ref&gt;http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?BindingProperties&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Messaging pattern:''' The messaging design pattern (MDP) allows the interchange of information (i.e. messages) between components and applications.

* '''Double-checked locking:''' Reduce the overhead of acquiring a lock by first testing the locking criterion (the 'lock hint') in an unsafe manner; only if that succeeds does the actual lock proceed.  Can be unsafe when implemented in some language/hardware combinations. It can therefore sometimes be considered an anti-pattern.

* '''Event-based asynchronous:''' Addresses problems with the Asynchronous pattern that occur in multithreaded programs.&lt;ref name=PC#2008&gt;{{cite book|title=Professional C# 2008|author=Christian Nagel, Bill Evjen, Jay Glynn, Karli Watson, and Morgan Skinner|pages=570&amp;ndash;571|publisher=Wiley|year=2008|isbn=0470191376|isbn13=9780470191378|chapter=Event-based Asynchronous Pattern}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Guarded suspension:''' Manages operations that require both a lock to be acquired and a precondition to be satisfied before the operation can be executed.

* '''Lock:''' One thread puts a &quot;lock&quot; on a resource, preventing other threads from accessing or modifying it.&lt;ref&gt;http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?LockPattern&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PoEAA&quot;/&gt;

* '''Monitor object:''' An object whose methods are subject to mutual exclusion, thus preventing multiple objects from erroneously trying to use it at the same time.

* '''Reactor:''' A reactor object provides an asynchronous interface to resources that must be handled synchronously.

* '''Read-write lock:''' Allows concurrent read access to an object but requires exclusive access for write operations.

* '''Scheduler:''' Explicitly control when threads may execute single-threaded code.

* '''Thread pool:''' A number of threads are created to perform a number of tasks, which are usually organized in a queue. Typically, there are many more tasks than threads. Can be considered a special case of the object pool pattern.

* '''Thread-specific storage:''' Static or &quot;global&quot; memory local to a thread.


==== Data Access Patterns ====
Another interesting area where patterns have a wide application is the area of ''data access patterns''.  Clifton Nock &lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; lists the following patterns:
* '''ORM Patterns:''' Domain Object Factory, Object/Relational Map, Update Factory
 
* '''Resource Management Patterns:''' Resource Pool, Resource Timer, Retryer, Paging Iterator

* '''Cache Patterns:''' Cache Accessor, Demand Cache, Primed Cache, Cache Collector, Cache Replicator

* '''Concurrency Patterns:''' Transaction, Optimistic Lock, Pessimistic Lock

 
==== Enterprise Patterns ====
If you deal with J2EE or with .Net Enterprise applications, the problems that occur and the solutions to them are similar.  These solutions are the Enterprise patterns.
The book ''Core J2EE Patterns'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; lists these patterns:
 
* '''Presentation Tier Patterns:''' Intercepting Filter, Front Controller, View Helper, Composite View, Service to Worker, Dispatcher View

* '''Business Tier Patterns:''' Business Delegate, Value Object, Session Facade, Composite Entity, Value Object Assembler, Value List Handler, Service Locator

* '''Integration Tier Patterns:''' Data Access Object, Service Activator
                                                                                                                

==== Real-Time Patterns ====
Finally, in the area of real-time and embedded software development a vast number of patterns have been identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Documenting and Describing Patterns ===
Assume you discovered a new design pattern.  Or your friend wants to explain to you this cool pattern she found in a pattern repository.  How do we describe patterns?  There is no single, standard format for documenting design patterns. Rather, a variety of different formats have been used by different pattern authors.&lt;ref name=&quot;GabrielHillside&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example of a commonly used documentation format is the one used by the book ''Design Patterns''.&lt;ref name=&quot;GoF&quot; /&gt; It contains the following sections:
*'''Pattern Name and Classification:''' A descriptive and unique name that helps in identifying and referring to the pattern.
*'''Intent:''' A description of the goal behind the pattern and the reason for using it.
*'''Also Known As:''' Other names for the pattern.
*'''Motivation (Forces):''' A scenario consisting of a problem and a context in which this pattern can be used.
*'''Applicability:''' Situations in which this pattern is usable; the context for the pattern.
*'''Structure:''' A graphical representation of the pattern. Class diagrams and Interaction diagrams may be used for this purpose.
*'''Participants:''' A listing of the classes and objects used in the pattern and their roles in the design.
*'''Collaboration:''' A description of how classes and objects used in the pattern interact with each other.
*'''Consequences:''' A description of the results, side effects, and trade offs caused by using the pattern.
*'''Implementation:''' A description of an implementation of the pattern; the solution part of the pattern.
*'''Sample Code:''' An illustration of how the pattern can be used in a programming language.
*'''Known Uses:''' Examples of real usages of the pattern.
*'''Related Patterns:''' Other patterns that have some relationship with the pattern; discussion of the differences between the pattern and similar patterns.

Of particular interest are the Structure, Participants, and Collaboration sections. These sections describe a ''design motif'': a prototypical ''micro-architecture'' that developers copy and adapt to their particular designs to solve the recurrent problem described by the design pattern. A micro-architecture is a set of program constituents (e.g., classes, methods...) and their relationships. Developers use the design pattern by introducing in their designs this prototypical micro-architecture, which means that micro-architectures in their designs will have structure and organization similar to the chosen design motif.

      <text xml:space="preserve">__NOTOC__
== Anti-Patterns and Code Smells ==
If design patterns are the good guys, then the anti-patterns are the bad guys.  And sometimes a good guy can turn into a bad guy.  This happens in Hollywood movies, but it also happens in software engineering.  

The &quot;golden hammer&quot; is a favorite notion of this problem: you learned to use a tool in one context (the golden hammer), and now because you are so proud having learned how to use this complicated tool, all of a sudden you see golden nails everywhere.

A good example is the Singleton pattern: it is so easy that it is the first pattern most beginning software engineers understand and henceforth, since presumably it is a good guy, they will use it at every possible occasion.  However, the problem with the Singleton is that it violates ''information hiding''.  Now information hiding is one of the holy cows of modern software engineering, and it should be violated only when there is a really good reason for it.  And just having learned about the Singleton pattern is not!

In software engineering, an ''anti-pattern'' is a pattern that may be commonly used but is ineffective and/or counterproductive in practice.&lt;ref&gt;

inspired by Gang of Four's book ''Design Patterns'', which developed the concept of design patterns in the software field. The term was widely popularized three years later by the book ''AntiPatterns'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; which extended the use of the term beyond the field of software design and into general social interaction. According to the authors of the latter, there must be at least two key elements present to formally distinguish an actual anti-pattern from a simple bad habit, bad practice, or bad idea:
* Some repeated pattern of action, process or structure that initially appears to be beneficial, but ultimately produces more bad consequences than beneficial results, and 
* A refactored solution exists that is clearly documented, proven in actual practice and repeatable. 
By formally describing repeated mistakes, one can recognize the forces that lead to their repetition and learn how others have refactored themselves out of these broken patterns.

=== Examples of Anti-Patterns ===
To understand anti-patterns a little better, let us take a look at a few examples.  By studying them you may recognize some violation against software engineering principles you may have committed yourself at one point in time.  Some of these anti-patterns have very funny names.

==== Singleton Overuse ==== 
We have talked about this one: the first pattern you understood immediately, and you used it heavily.  But beware it violates information hiding.  Therefore the simple rule: when in doubt don't use it.  My experience is that the larger the project, the more Singletons show up.  

How do you detect Singletons?  This is very easy:  look at the class diagram.  All classes that have references to themselves (or their base class) are potential Singletons.  If you want to get rid of them, Kerievsky shows you the medicine that cures this disease. &lt;ref name=&quot;Kerievsky&quot;&gt;{{cite book 
   | last=Kerievsky 
   | first=Joshua
   | title = Refactoring to Patterns
   | publisher = Addison-Wesley Professional
   | year = 2004
   | isbn = 0321213351
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==== Functional Decomposition ==== 
Although very popular once, in a modern object-oriented language there is no more space for functional decomposition.  It is a remanent of procedural languages such as C or Pascal.  Usually it indicates old software that was integrated into a new project or migrated.

This anti-pattern reveals itself in three ways: The names of classes sound like function names (e.g. CalculateInterest).  Or the classes only have one action, i.e., they only do one thing.  Or all class attributes are private (which is fine) but they are only used within the class.  To detect this anti-pattern you can use a tool such as SourceMonitor.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.campwoodsw.com/sourcemonitor.html SourceMonitor&lt;/ref&gt;  It lists all class names, and also lists the functions.

==== Poltergeist ==== 
People like this anti-pattern because of its name.  What it is, are classes that briefly appear to only disappear into oblivion.  Either nobody knows what they really do, or they have very limited functionality.  Usually they are not needed or can be absorbed in other classes.

Usually one recognizes this anti-pattern by class names that end in ’*controller’ oder ’*manager’.    Again a tool such as SourceMonitor can help to find this anti-pattern.

Often a consequence of &quot;agile&quot; approaches where cogitating is preferred to Design.

==== Spaghetti ==== 
Spaghetti code is like the noodles: it is very long.  Although the noodles are delicious, code the longer it gets is not.  

SourceMonitor can help you find this pattern, you simply look for methods with many lines of code.    Refactoring is usually is the cure here.
 
==== Blob ==== 
A blob is a class with a lot of attributes and methods.  Quite often these are not even related.  You can detect this smell with your favorite code analysis tool, by listing classes with lots of attributes and methods or many lines of code.  Usually splitting this class into several smaller classes will help here.
 
==== Copy and Paste ==== 
As the name implies, somebody copied some code from some place to another place.  It is the simplest way to duplicate functionality, but it should be avoided for many reasons.  The simplest solution is to turn the code into a method instead, or use inheritance.  

To detect almost identical code you can use a tool like PMD’s Tool Copy/Paste Detector.&lt;ref name=&quot;PMD&quot;&gt;http://pmd.sourceforge.net/cpd.html PMD&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2003/03/12/pmd_cpd.html Detecting Duplicate Code with PMD’s CPD&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==== Lava Flow ==== 
What is lava flow?  &quot;A lava flow is a moving outpouring of lava, which is created during a non-explosive effusive eruption. When it has stopped moving, lava solidifies to form igneous rock.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lava Lava&lt;/ref&gt; In software engineering it means that the code is ancient, nobody has touched it for eons, and nobody has the guts to touch it (never touch a working class...).  

You can find these classes by using your source control system.  Simply list those classes that have not been checked out and modified for a long time.

=== Code Smells ===
Code smells are similar to anti-patterns, but not quite as formal.  If code smells, then that smell can be o.k. (like some cheese) or it can be bad, possibly indicating a deeper problem.  Kent Beck introduced the idea in the late 1990s and Martin Fowler made it popular in his book  ''Refactoring. Improving the Design of Existing Code''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | first = Martin
 | last = Fowler
 | authorlink = Martin Fowler
 | year = 1999
 | title = Refactoring. Improving the Design of Existing Code
 | publisher = Addison-Wesley
 | isbn = 0-201-48567-2
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  You can use tools, such as FindBugs, Checkstyle or PMD to find bad smells.  Usually refactoring is used to remove the offending odor.  Martin Fowler and Joshua Kerievsky, among others, provide the appropriate refactorings.

==== Duplicate Code ==== 
This smell is very similar to the Copy and Paste anti-pattern.  You use can use the PMD Tool Copy/Paste Detector &lt;ref name=&quot;PMD&quot; /&gt; to find the problematic areas.
 
==== Long Method ==== 
Related to the Spaghetti anti-pattern, you can find it using SourceMonitor when sorting classes according to ’Avg Stmts/Meth’.  Methods that have more then 50 lines are definitely suspicious.
 
==== Indecent Exposure ==== 
In the current Victorian age of information hiding, naturally indecent exposure is a bad thing.  If a class has too many methods, or, god forbid, any public attributes then we talk about indecent exposure.  You find this smell by checking for public methods of classes.  If a class has more than 50% public methods, this may not conform to the information hiding policy.
 
==== Lazy Class ==== 
Reminds me of the Poltergeist anti-pattern:  this is a class that does so little that it has not reason for existence.  Try to absorb into another class.  To detect this smell use SourceMonitor: Sort 'Methods/Class' and look for classes that have fewer than two methods or look for classes with very few lines of code.  They are suspect of being lazy.

==== Large Class ==== 
A large class is the opposite of a lazy class.  You find it similarily, look for classes with too many methods, or too many statements.  Usually a class should not have more than 30 methods or more than 400 statements.  Also class with too many attributes could be large classes.
Kerievsky shows several possible ways of reducing this smell.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kerievsky&quot; /&gt;

Really means not coding to code conventions.  Look up Meyer, MISRA etc.

=== Known Anti-Patterns ===
There are many known anti-patterns.  A list and brief description of some is provided for your entertainment.

====Organizational anti-patterns====
*Analysis paralysis: Devoting disproportionate effort to the analysis phase of a project
*Cash cow: A profitable legacy product that often leads to complacency about new products
*Design by committee: The result of having many contributors to a design, but no unifying vision
*Escalation of commitment: Failing to revoke a decision when it proves wrong
*Management by perkele: Authoritarian style of management with no tolerance of dissent
*Matrix Management: Unfocused organizational structure that results in divided loyalties and lack of direction
*Moral hazard: Insulating a decision-maker from the consequences of his or her decision
*Mushroom management: Keeping employees uninformed and misinformed (kept in the dark and fed manure)
*Stovepipe or Silos: A structure that supports mostly up-down flow of data but inhibits cross organizational communication
*Vendor lock-in: Making a system excessively dependent on an externally supplied component&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antipatterns.com/vendorlockin.htm Vendor Lock-In] at antipatterns.com&lt;/ref&gt;

====Project management anti-patterns====
*Death march: Everyone knows that the project is going to be a disaster – except the CEO. However, the truth remains hidden and the project is artificially kept alive until the Day Zero finally comes (&quot;Big Bang&quot;). Alternative definition:  Employees are pressured to work late nights and weekends on a project with an unreasonable deadline.
*Groupthink: During groupthink, members of the group avoid promoting viewpoints outside the comfort zone of consensus thinking
*Smoke and mirrors: Demonstrating how unimplemented functions will appear
*Software bloat: Allowing successive versions of a system to demand ever more resources
*Waterfall model: An older method of software development that inadequately deals with unanticipated change

====Analysis anti-patterns====
*Bystander apathy: When a requirement or design decision is wrong, but the people who notice this do nothing because it affects a larger number of people

====Software design anti-patterns====
&lt;span id=&quot;General design anti-patterns&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
*Abstraction inversion: Not exposing implemented functionality required by users, so that they re-implement it using higher level functions
*Ambiguous viewpoint: Presenting a model (usually Object-oriented analysis and design (OOAD)) without specifying its viewpoint
*Big ball of mud: A system with no recognizable structure
*Database-as-IPC: Using a database as the message queue for routine interprocess communication where a much more lightweight mechanism would be suitable
*Gold plating: Continuing to work on a task or project well past the point at which extra effort is adding value
*Inner-platform effect: A system so customizable as to become a poor replica of the software development platform 
*Input kludge: Failing to specify and implement the handling of possibly invalid input
*Interface bloat: Making an interface so powerful that it is extremely difficult to implement
*Magic pushbutton: Coding implementation logic directly within interface code, without using abstraction
*Race hazard: Failing to see the consequence of different orders of events
*Stovepipe system: A barely maintainable assemblage of ill-related components

=====Object-oriented design anti-patterns=====
*Anemic Domain Model: The use of domain model without any business logic.  The domain model's objects cannot guarantee their correctness at any moment, because their validation and mutation logic is placed somewhere outside (most likely in multiple places).
*BaseBean: Inheriting functionality from a utility class rather than delegating to it
*Call super: Requiring subclasses to call a superclass's overridden method
*Circle-ellipse problem: Subtyping variable-types on the basis of value-subtypes
*Circular dependency: Introducing unnecessary direct or indirect mutual dependencies between objects or software modules 
*Constant interface: Using interfaces to define constants
*God object: Concentrating too many functions in a single part of the design (class)
*Object cesspool: Reusing objects whose state does not conform to the (possibly implicit) contract for re-use
*Object orgy: Failing to properly encapsulate objects permitting unrestricted access to their internals
*Poltergeists: Objects whose sole purpose is to pass information to another object
*Sequential coupling: A class that requires its methods to be called in a particular order
*Yo-yo problem: A structure (e.g., of inheritance) that is hard to understand due to excessive fragmentation

====Programming anti-patterns====
*Accidental complexity: Introducing unnecessary complexity into a solution
*Action at a distance: Unexpected interaction between widely separated parts of a system
*Blind faith: Lack of checking of (a) the correctness of a bug fix or (b) the result of a subroutine
*Boat anchor: Retaining a part of a system that no longer has any use
*Busy spin: Consuming CPU while waiting for something to happen, usually by repeated checking instead of messaging
*Caching failure: Forgetting to reset an error flag when an error has been corrected
*Cargo cult programming: Using patterns and methods without understanding why
*Coding by exception: Adding new code to handle each special case as it is recognized
*Error hiding: Catching an error message before it can be shown to the user and either showing nothing or showing a meaningless message
*Hard code: Embedding assumptions about the environment of a system in its implementation
*Lava flow: Retaining undesirable (redundant or low-quality) code because removing it is too expensive or has unpredictable consequences&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antipatterns.com/lavaflow.htm Lava Flow] at antipatterns.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icmgworld.com/corp/news/Articles/RS/jan_0202.asp |title=Undocumented 'lava flow' antipatterns complicate process |publisher=Icmgworld.com |date=2002-01-14 |accessdate=2010-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Loop-switch sequence: Encoding a set of sequential steps using a switch within a loop statement
*Magic numbers: Including unexplained numbers in algorithms
*Magic strings: Including literal strings in code, for comparisons, as event types etc.
*Soft code: Storing business logic in configuration files rather than source code&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Papadimoulis |first=Alex |url=http://worsethanfailure.com/Articles/Soft_Coding.aspx |title=Soft Coding |publisher=Worsethanfailure.com |date=2007-04-10 |accessdate=2010-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Spaghetti code: Programs whose structure is barely comprehensible, especially because of misuse of code structures

====Methodological anti-patterns====
*Copy and paste programming: Copying (and modifying) existing code rather than creating generic solutions
*Golden hammer: Assuming that a favorite solution is universally applicable (See: Silver Bullet)
*Improbability factor: Assuming that it is improbable that a known error will occur
*Not Invented Here (NIH) syndrome: The tendency towards ''reinventing the wheel'' (Failing to adopt an existing, adequate solution)
*Premature optimization: Coding early-on for perceived efficiency, sacrificing good design,  maintainability, and sometimes even real-world efficiency
*Programming by permutation (or &quot;programming by accident&quot;): Trying to approach a solution by successively modifying the code to see if it works
*Reinventing the wheel: Failing to adopt an existing, adequate solution
*Reinventing the square wheel: Failing to adopt an existing solution and instead adopting a custom solution which performs much worse than the existing one
*Silver bullet: Assuming that a favorite technical solution can solve a larger process or problem
*Tester Driven Development: Software projects in which new requirements are specified in bug reports

====Configuration management anti-patterns====
*Dependency hell: Problems with versions of required products
*DLL hell: Inadequate management of dynamic-link libraries (DLLs), specifically on Microsoft Windows
*Extension conflict: Problems with different extensions to pre-Mac OS X versions of the Mac OS attempting to patch the same parts of the operating system
*JAR hell: Overutilization of the multiple JAR files, usually causing versioning and location problems because of misunderstanding of the Java class loading model

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are a few industry standards related to process improvement models we should mention briefly.    For you as a beginner, it is enough to know they exist.  However, if you start working for large corporations, you will find that many will follow one or the other of these standards. 

=== Capability Maturity Model Integration === 
The [[Wikipedia:Capability Maturity Model Integration|Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI)]] is one of the leading models and based on best practice. Independent assessments grade organizations on how well they follow their defined processes, not on the quality of those processes or the software produced. CMMI has replaced CMM.

=== ISO 9000 === 
[[Wikipedia:ISO 9000|ISO 9000]] describes standards for a formally organized process to manufacture a product and the methods of managing and monitoring progress. Although the standard was originally created for the manufacturing sector, ISO 9000 standards have been applied to software development as well. Like CMMI, certification with ISO 9000 does not guarantee the quality of the end result, only that formalized business processes have been followed.

=== ISO 15504 === 
[[Wikipedia:ISO 15504|ISO 15504]], also known as Software Process Improvement Capability Determination (SPICE), is a &quot;framework for the assessment of software processes&quot;. This standard is aimed at setting out a clear model for process comparison. SPICE is used much like CMMI. It models processes to manage, control, guide and monitor software development. This model is then used to measure what a development organization or project team actually does during software development. This information is analyzed to identify weaknesses and drive improvement. It also identifies strengths that can be continued or integrated into common practice for that organization or team.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Coding conventions''' are a set of guidelines for a specific programming language that recommend programming style, practices and methods for each aspect of a piece program written in this language. These conventions usually cover file organization, indentation, comments, declarations, statements, white space, naming conventions, programming practices, programming principles, programming rules of thumb, etc. Software programmers are highly recommended to follow these guidelines to help improve the readability of their source code and make software maintenance easier. Coding conventions are only applicable to the human maintainers and peer reviewers of a software project. Conventions may be formalized in a documented set of rules that an entire team or company follows, or may be as informal as the habitual coding practices of an individual. Coding conventions are not enforced by compilers. As a result, not following some or all of the rules has no impact on the executable programs created from the source code.

==Software maintenance==
Reducing the cost of software maintenance is the most often cited reason for following coding conventions.  In their introduction to code conventions for the Java Programming Language, Sun Microsystems provides the following rationale:&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
  | title = Code Conventions for the Java Programming Language : Why Have Code Conventions
  | publisher = Sun Microsystems, Inc.
  | date = 1999-04-20
  | url = http://java.sun.com/docs/codeconv/html/CodeConventions.doc.html#16712 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Code conventions are important to programmers for a number of reasons:
*80% of the lifetime cost of a piece of software goes to maintenance. 
*Hardly any software is maintained for its whole life by the original author. 
*Code conventions improve the readability of the software, allowing engineers to understand new code more quickly and thoroughly. 
*If you ship your source code as a product, you need to make sure it is as well packaged and clean as any other product you create. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Quality===
Software peer review frequently involves reading source code.  This type of peer review is primarily a defect detection activity.  By definition, only the original author of a piece of code has read the source file before the code is submitted for review.  Code that is written using consistent guidelines is easier for other reviewers to understand and assimilate, improving the efficacy of the defect detection process.

Even for the original author, consistently coded software eases maintainability.  There is no guarantee that an individual will remember the precise rationale for ''why'' a particular piece of code was written in a certain way long after the code was originally written.  Coding conventions can help.  Consistent use of whitespace improves readability and reduces the time it takes to understand the software.

===Refactoring===
Refactoring refers to a software maintenance activity where source code is modified to improve readability or improve its structure.  Software is often refactored to bring it into conformance with a team's stated coding standards after its initial release.  Any change that does not alter the behavior of the software can be considered refactoring.  Common refactoring activities are changing variable names, renaming methods, moving methods or whole classes and breaking large methods (or functions) into smaller ones. 

Agile software development methodologies plan for regular (or even continuous) refactoring making it an integral part of the team software development process.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Task automation==
Coding conventions allow to have simple scripts or programs whose job is to process source code for some purpose other than compiling it into an executable. It is common practice to count the software size (Source lines of code) to track current project progress or establish a baseline for future project estimates.  

Consistent coding standards can, in turn, make the measurements more consistent.  Special tags within source code comments are often used to process documentation, two notable examples are javadoc and doxygen.  The tools specifies the use of a set of tags, but their use within a project is determined by convention.

Coding conventions simplify writing new software whose job is to process existing software.  Use of static code analysis has grown consistently since the 1950s.  Some of the growth of this class of development tools stems from increased maturity and sophistication of the practitioners themselves (and the modern focus on safety and security), but also from the nature of the languages themselves.

==Language factors==
All software practitioners must grapple with the problems of organizing and managing very many detailed instructions, each of which will eventually be processed in order to perform the task for which it was written.  For all but the smallest software projects, source code (instructions) are partitioned into separate files and frequently among many directories.  It was natural for programmers to collect closely related functions (behaviors) in the same file and to collect related files into directories.  As software development evolved from purely procedural programming (such as found in FORTRAN) towards more object-oriented constructs (such as found in C++), it became the practice to write the code for a single (public) class in a single file (the 'one class per file' convention).&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.fifengine.de/index.php?title=Coding_standards FIFE coding standards]&lt;/ref&gt;
Java has gone one step further - the Java compiler returns an error if it finds more than one public class per file.  

A convention in one language may be a requirement in another.  Language conventions also affect individual source files. Each compiler (or interpreter) used to process source code is unique. The rules a compiler applies to the source creates implicit standards. For example, Python code is much more consistently indented than, say Perl, because whitespace (indentation) is actually significant to the interpreter. Python does not use the brace syntax Perl uses to delimit functions.  Changes in indentation serve as the delimiters.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Tcl, which uses a brace syntax similar to Perl or C/C++ to delimit functions, does not allow the following, which seems fairly reasonable to a C programmer:
&lt;code&gt;
 set i 0
 while {$i &lt; 10} 
 {
    puts &quot;$i squared = [expr $i*$i]&quot;
    incr i
 }
&lt;/code&gt; 
The reason is that in Tcl, curly braces are not used only to delimit functions as in C or Java.  More 
generally, curly braces are used to group words together into a single argument.&lt;ref&gt;

  | publisher = 'the Tcler's Wiki'
  | date = 2006-07-16
  | url = http://wiki.tcl.tk/8344 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
In Tcl, the ''word'' '''while''' takes two arguments, a ''condition'' and an ''action''. In the example above, '''while''' is missing its second argument, its ''action'' (because the Tcl also uses the newline character to delimit the end of a command).

==Common conventions==

As mentioned above, common coding conventions may cover the following areas:

* Comment conventions
* Indent style conventions
* Naming conventions
* Programming practices
* Programming principles
* Programming rules of thumb
* Programming style conventions

==Examples==
===Only one statement should occur per line===

For example, in Java this would involve having statements written like this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
a++;
b = a;
&lt;/source&gt;

But not like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
a++; b = a;
&lt;/source&gt;

===Boolean values in decision structures===
Some programmers suggest that coding where the result of a decision is merely the computation of a Boolean value, are overly verbose and error prone. They prefer to have the decision in the computation itself, like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
return (hours &lt; 24) &amp;&amp; (minutes &lt; 60) &amp;&amp; (seconds &lt; 60);
&lt;/source&gt;

The difference is entirely stylistic, because optimizing compilers may produce identical object code for both forms. However, stylistically, programmers disagree which form is easier to read and maintain.

Arguments in favor of the longer form include: it is then possible to set a per-line breakpoint on one branch of the decision; further lines of code could be added to one branch without refactoring the return line, which would increase the chances of bugs being introduced; the longer form would always permit a debugger to step to a line where the variables involved are still in scope.

===Left-hand comparisons===
In languages which use one symbol (typically a single equals sign, (&lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt;)) for assignment and another (typically two equals signs, (&lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt;) for comparison (e.g. C/C++, Java, ActionScript 3, PHP, Perl numeric context, and most languages in the last 15 years), and where assignments may be made within control structures, there is an advantage to adopting the left-hand comparison style: to place constants or expressions to the left in any comparison.
&lt;ref name=&quot;phpcook&quot;&gt;
{{cite book 
  | title=PHP Cookbook

  | coauthors=Adam Trachtenberg 
  | publisher=O'Reilly 
  | year=2003}}, recipe 5.1 &quot;Avoiding == Versus = Confusion&quot;, p118
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
  | title = C Programming FAQs: Frequently Asked Questions
  | publisher = Addison-Wesley, 1995
  | date = Nov. 2010
  | url = http://c-faq.com/style/revtest.html }}
&lt;/ref&gt;


Here are both left and right-hand comparison styles, applied to a line of Perl code. In both cases, this compares the value in the variable &lt;code&gt;$a&lt;/code&gt; against 42, and if it matches, executes the code in the subsequent block.

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
if ( $a == 42 ) { ... }  # A right-hand comparison checking if $a equals 42.
if ( 42 == $a ) { ... }  # Recast, using the left-hand comparison style.
&lt;/source&gt;

The difference occurs when a developer accidentally types &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
if ( $a = 42 ) { ... }  # Inadvertent assignment which is often hard to debug
if ( 42 = $a ) { ... }  # Compile time error indicates source of problem
&lt;/source&gt;

The first (right-hand) line now contains a potentially subtle flaw: rather than the previous behaviour, it now sets the value of &lt;code&gt;$a&lt;/code&gt; to be 42, and then always runs the code in the following block.  As this is syntactically legitimate, the error may go unnoticed by the programmer, and the software may ship with a bug.

The second (left-hand) line contains a semantic error, as numeric values cannot be assigned to. This will result in a diagnostic message being generated when the code is compiled, so the error cannot go unnoticed by the programmer.

Some languages have built-in protections against inadvertent assignment.  Java and C#, for example, do not support automatic conversion to boolean for just this reason.  

The risk can also be mitigated by use of static code analysis tools that can detect this issue.

===Looping and control structures===
The use of logical control structures for looping adds to good programming style as well. It helps someone reading code to better understand the program's sequence of execution (in imperative programming languages). For example, in pseudocode:

&lt;code lang=&quot;pseudo&quot;&gt;
 i = 0
 '' ''
 '''while''' i &lt; 5
   '''print''' i * 2
   i = i + 1
 '''end while'''
 '' ''
 '''print''' &quot;Ended loop&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;

The above snippet obeys the naming and indentation style guidelines, but the following use of the &quot;for&quot; construct may be considered easier to read:

&lt;code lang=&quot;pseudo&quot;&gt;
 '''for''' i = 0, i &lt; 5, i=i+1
   '''print''' i * 2
 '' ''
 '''print''' &quot;Ended loop&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;

In many languages, the often used &quot;for each element in a range&quot; pattern can be shortened to:

&lt;code lang=&quot;pseudo&quot;&gt;
 '''for''' i = 0 '''to''' 5
   '''print''' i * 2
 '' ''
 '''print''' &quot;Ended loop&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;

In programming languages that allow curly brackets, it has become common for style documents to require that even where optional, curly brackets be used with all control flow constructs.

&lt;code lang=&quot;pseudo&quot;&gt;
 '''for''' (i = 0 '''to''' 5) {
   '''print''' i * 2;
 }
 '' ''
 '''print''' &quot;Ended loop&quot;;
&lt;/code&gt;

This prevents program-flow bugs which can be time-consuming to track down, such as where a terminating semicolon is introduced at the end of the construct (a common typo):

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 for (i = 0; i &lt; 5; ++i);
    printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;, i*2);    /* The incorrect indentation hides the fact 
                               that this line is not part of the loop body. */
 
 printf(&quot;Ended loop&quot;);
&lt;/source&gt;

...or where another line is added before the first:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 for (i = 0; i &lt; 5; ++i)
    fprintf(logfile, &quot;loop reached %d\n&quot;, i);
    printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;, i*2);    /* The incorrect indentation hides the fact 
                               that this line is not part of the loop body. */
 
 printf(&quot;Ended loop&quot;);
&lt;/source&gt;

===Lists===
Where items in a list are placed on separate lines, it is sometimes considered good practice to add the item-separator after the final item, as well as between each item, at least in those languages where doing so is supported by the syntax (e.g., C, Java)
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
const char *array[] = {
    &quot;item1&quot;,
    &quot;item2&quot;,
    &quot;item3&quot;,  /* still has the comma after it */
};
&lt;/source&gt;

This prevents syntax errors or subtle string-concatenation bugs when the list items are re-ordered or more items are added to the end, without the programmer's noticing the &quot;missing&quot; separator on the line which was previously last in the list. However, this technique can result in a syntax error (or misleading semantics) in some languages. Even for languages that do support trailing commas, not all list-like syntactical constructs in those languages may support it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Software documentation''' or '''source code documentation''' is written text that accompanies computer software.  It either explains how it operates or how to use it, and may mean different things to people in different roles.

== Involvement of people in software life==
Documentation is an important part of software engineering. Types of documentation include:

# Requirements - Statements that identify attributes, capabilities, characteristics, or qualities of a system.  This is the foundation for what shall be or has been implemented.
# Architecture/Design - Overview of softwares. Includes relations to an environment and construction principles to be used in design of software components. 
# Technical - Documentation of code, algorithms, interfaces, and APIs.
# End User - Manuals for the end-user, system administrators and support staff.
# Marketing - How to market the product and analysis of the market demand.

=== Requirements documentation ===
Requirements documentation is the description of what a particular software does or shall do. It is used throughout development to communicate what the software does or shall do. It is also used as an agreement or as the foundation for agreement on what the software shall do. Requirements are produced and consumed by everyone involved in the production of software: end users, customers, product managers, project managers, sales, marketing, software architects, usability engineers, interaction designers, developers, and testers, to name a few. Thus, requirements documentation has many different purposes.

Requirements come in a variety of styles, notations and formality. Requirements can be goal-like (e.g., ''distributed work environment''), close to design (e.g., ''builds can be started by right-clicking a configuration file and select the 'build' function''), and anything in between. They can be specified as statements in natural language, as drawn figures, as detailed mathematical formulas, and as a combination of them all.

The variation and complexity of requirements documentation makes it a proven challenge. Requirements may be implicit and hard to uncover. It is difficult to know exactly how much and what kind of documentation is needed and how much can be left to the architecture and design documentation, and it is difficult to know how to document requirements considering the variety of people that shall read and use the documentation. Thus, requirements documentation is often incomplete (or non-existent). Without proper requirements documentation, software changes become more difficult—and therefore more error prone (decreased software quality) and time-consuming (expensive).

The need for requirements documentation is typically related to the complexity of the product, the impact of the product, and the life expectancy of the software. If the software is very complex or developed by many people (e.g., mobile phone software), requirements can help to better communicate what to achieve. If the software is safety-critical and can have negative impact on human life (e.g., nuclear power systems, medical equipment), more formal requirements documentation is often required. If the software is expected to live for only a month or two (e.g., very small mobile phone applications developed specifically for a certain campaign) very little requirements documentation may be needed. If the software is a first release that is later built upon, requirements documentation is very helpful when managing the change of the software and verifying that nothing has been broken in the software when it is modified.

Traditionally, requirements are specified in requirements documents (e.g. using word processing applications and spreadsheet applications). To manage the increased complexity and changing nature of requirements documentation (and software documentation in general), database-centric systems and special-purpose requirements management tools are advocated.

=== Architecture/Design documentation ===
Architecture documentation is a special breed of design document. In a way, architecture documents are third derivative from the code (design document being second derivative, and code documents being first). Very little in the architecture documents is specific to the code itself. These documents do not describe how to program a particular routine, or even why that particular routine exists in the form that it does, but instead merely lays out the general requirements that would motivate the existence of such a routine. A good architecture document is short on details but thick on explanation. It may suggest approaches for lower level design, but leave the actual exploration trade studies to other documents.

Another breed of design docs is the comparison document, or trade study. This would often take the form of a ''whitepaper''. It focuses on one specific aspect of the system and suggests alternate approaches. It could be at the user interface, code, design, or even architectural level. It will outline what the situation is, describe one or more alternatives, and enumerate the pros and cons of each. A good trade study document is heavy on research, expresses its idea clearly (without relying heavily on obtuse jargon to dazzle the reader), and most importantly is impartial. It should honestly and clearly explain the costs of whatever solution it offers as best. The objective of a trade study is to devise the best solution, rather than to push a particular point of view. It is perfectly acceptable to state no conclusion, or to conclude that none of the alternatives are sufficiently better than the baseline to warrant a change. It should be approached as a scientific endeavor, not as a marketing technique.

A very important part of the design document in enterprise software development is the Database Design Document (DDD). It contains Conceptual, Logical, and Physical Design Elements. The DDD includes the formal information that the people who interact with the database need. The purpose of preparing it is to create a common source to be used by all players within the scene. The potential users are:
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Database Designer
&lt;li&gt;Database Developer
&lt;li&gt;Database Administrator
&lt;li&gt;Application Designer
&lt;li&gt;Application Developer
&lt;/ul&gt;

When talking about Relational Database Systems, the document should include following parts:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Entity - Relationship Schema, including following information and their clear definitions:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Entity Sets and their attributes
&lt;li&gt;Relationships and their attributes
&lt;li&gt;Candidate keys for each entity set
&lt;li&gt;Attribute and Tuple based constraints
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Relational Schema, including following information:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tables, Attributes, and their properties
&lt;li&gt;Views
&lt;li&gt;Constraints such as primary keys, foreign keys, 
&lt;li&gt;Cardinality of referential constraints
&lt;li&gt;Cascading Policy for referential constraints
&lt;li&gt;Primary keys
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

It is very important to include all information that is to be used by all actors in the scene. It is also very important to update the documents as any change occurs in the database as well.

=== Technical documentation ===
This is what most programmers mean when using the term ''software documentation''. When creating software, code alone is insufficient. There must be some text along with it to describe various aspects of its intended operation.  It is important for the code documents to be thorough, but not so verbose that it becomes difficult to maintain them. Several How-to and overview documentation are found specific to the software application or software product being documented by API Writers. This documentation may be used by developers, testers and also the end customers or clients using this software application. Today, we see lot of high end applications in the field of power, energy, transportation, networks, aerospace, safety, security, industry automation and a variety of other domains. Technical documentation has become important within such organizations as the basic and advanced level of information may change over a period of time with architecture changes. Hence, technical documentation has gained lot of importance in recent times, especially in the software field.

Often, tools such as Doxygen, NDoc, javadoc, EiffelStudio, Sandcastle, ROBODoc, POD, TwinText, or Universal Report can be used to auto-generate the code documents&amp;mdash;that is, they extract the comments and software contracts, where available, from the source code and create reference manuals in such forms as text or HTML files. Code documents are often organized into a ''reference guide'' style, allowing a programmer to quickly look up an arbitrary function or class.

The idea of auto-generating documentation is attractive to programmers for various reasons.  For example, because it is extracted from the source code itself (for example, through comments), the programmer can write it while referring to the code, and use the same tools used to create the source code to make the documentation.  This makes it much easier to keep the documentation up-to-date.

Of course, a downside is that only programmers can edit this kind of documentation, and it depends on them to refresh the output (for example, by running a cron job to update the documents nightly). Some would characterize this as a pro rather than a con.

Donald Knuth has insisted on the fact that documentation can be a very difficult afterthought process and has advocated literate programming, writing at the same time and location as the source code and extracted by automatic means.

Elucidative Programming is the result of practical applications of Literate Programming in real programming contexts.
The Elucidative paradigm proposes that source code and documentation be stored separately.
This paradigm was inspired by the same experimental findings that produced [http://kelp.sf.net/ Kelp].
Often, software developers need to be able to create and access information that is not going to be part of the source file itself. Such annotations are usually part of several software development activities, such as code walks and porting, where third party source code is analysed in a functional way. Annotations can therefore help the developer during any stage of software development where a formal documentation system would hinder progress.
[http://kelp.sf.net/ Kelp] stores annotations in separate files, linking the information to the source code dynamically.

=== User documentation ===
Unlike code documents, user documents are usually far more diverse with respect to the source code of the program, and instead simply describe how it is used.  

In the case of a software library, the code documents and user documents could be effectively equivalent and are worth conjoining, but for a general application this is not often true. 

Typically, the user documentation describes each feature of the program, and assists the user in realizing these features.  A good user document can also go so far as to provide thorough troubleshooting assistance.  It is very important for user documents to not be confusing, and for them to be up to date.  User documents need not be organized in any particular way, but it is very important for them to have a thorough index. Consistency and simplicity are also very valuable. User documentation is considered to constitute a contract specifying what the software will do. API Writers are very well accomplished towards writing good user documents as they would be well aware of the software architecture and programming techniques used. See also Technical Writing.

There are three broad ways in which user documentation can be organized. 
# '''Tutorial:''' A tutorial approach is considered the most useful for a new user, in which they are guided through each step of accomplishing particular tasks &lt;ref name=kdp&gt;{{cite web

# '''Thematic:''' A thematic approach, where chapters or sections concentrate on one particular area of interest, is of more general use to an intermediate user.  Some authors prefer to convey their ideas through a knowledge based article to facilitating the user needs.  This approach is usually practiced by a dynamic industry, such as Information technology, where the user population is largely correlated with the troubleshooting demands &lt;ref name=kbad&gt;{{cite web

  | doi =
  | accessdate = 15 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.
# '''List or Reference:''' The final type of organizing principle is one in which commands or tasks are simply listed alphabetically or logically grouped, often via cross-referenced indexes. This latter approach is of greater use to advanced users who know exactly what sort of information they are looking for.

A common complaint among users regarding software documentation is that only one of these three approaches was taken to the near-exclusion of the other two. It is common to limit provided software documentation for personal computers to online help that give only reference information on commands or menu items.  The job of tutoring new users or helping more experienced users get the most out of a program is left to private publishers, who are often given significant assistance by the software developer.

=== Marketing documentation ===
For many applications it is necessary to have some promotional materials to encourage casual observers to spend more time learning about the product.  This form of documentation has three purposes:-

#To excite the potential user about the product and instill in them a desire for becoming more involved with it.
#To inform them about what exactly the product does, so that their expectations are in line with what they will be receiving.
#To explain the position of this product with respect to other alternatives.  

One good marketing technique is to provide clear and memorable ''catch phrases'' that exemplify the point we wish to convey, and also emphasize the interoperability of the program with anything else provided by the manufacturer.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Software testing''' is an investigation conducted to provide stakeholders with information about the quality of the product or service under test.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kaner.com/pdfs/ETatQAI.pdf Exploratory Testing], Cem Kaner, Florida Institute of Technology, ''Quality Assurance Institute Worldwide Annual Software Testing Conference'', Orlando, FL, November 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Software testing also provides an objective, independent view of the software to allow the business to appreciate and understand the risks of software implementation. Test techniques include, but are not limited to, the process of executing a program or application with the intent of finding software bugs.

Software testing can also be stated as the process of validating and verifying that a software program/application/product:
# meets the business and technical requirements that guided its design and development;
# works as expected; and
# can be implemented with the same characteristics.

Software testing, depending on the testing method employed, can be implemented at any time in the development process. However, most of the test effort occurs after the requirements have been defined and the coding process has been completed. As such, the methodology of the test is governed by the software development methodology adopted.

Different software development models will focus the test effort at different points in the development process. Newer development models, such as Agile, often employ test driven development and place an increased portion of the testing in the hands of the developer, before it reaches a formal team of testers. In a more traditional model, most of the test execution occurs after the requirements have been defined and the coding process has been completed.

== Overview ==
Testing can never completely identify all the defects within software. Instead, it furnishes a ''criticism'' or ''comparison'' that compares the state and behavior of the product against oracles&amp;mdash;principles or mechanisms by which someone might recognize a problem. These oracles may include (but are not limited to) specifications, contracts,&lt;ref&gt;Leitner, A., Ciupa, I., Oriol, M., Meyer, B., Fiva, A., [http://se.inf.ethz.ch/people/leitner/publications/cdd_leitner_esec_fse_2007.pdf &quot;Contract Driven Development = Test Driven Development - Writing Test Cases&quot;], Proceedings of ESEC/FSE'07: European Software Engineering Conference and the ACM SIGSOFT Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering 2007, (Dubrovnik, Croatia), September 2007&lt;/ref&gt; comparable products, past versions of the same product, inferences about intended or expected purpose, user or customer expectations, relevant standards, applicable laws, or other criteria.

Every software product has a target audience. For example, the audience for video game software is completely different from banking software. Therefore, when an organization develops or otherwise invests in a software product, it can assess whether the software product will be acceptable to its end users, its target audience, its purchasers, and other stakeholders. '''Software testing''' is the process of attempting to make this assessment.

A study conducted by NIST in 2002 reports that software bugs cost the U.S. economy $59.5 billion annually. More than a third of this cost could be avoided if better software testing was performed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abeacha.com/NIST_press_release_bugs_cost.htm Software errors cost U.S. economy $59.5 billion annually], NIST report&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The separation of debugging from testing was initially introduced by Glenford J. Myers in 1979.&lt;ref name=&quot;Myers 1979&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=Glenford J.|last=Myers|title=The Art of Software Testing|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year=1979|isbn=0-471-04328-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although his attention was on breakage testing (&quot;a successful test is one that finds a bug&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Myers 1979&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Dr. Dobb's journal of software tools for the professional programmer|publisher=M&amp;amp;T Pub|year=1987|volume=12|issue=1-6|page=116|url=http://books.google.com/?id=7RoIAAAAIAAJ|title=Dr. Dobb's journal of software tools for the professional programmer|author1=Company, People's Computer}}&lt;/ref&gt;) it illustrated the desire of the software engineering community to separate fundamental development activities, such as debugging, from that of verification. Dave Gelperin and William C. Hetzel classified in 1988 the phases and goals in software testing in the following stages:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=D.|last=Gelperin|coauthors=B. Hetzel|title=The Growth of Software Testing|journal=CACM|volume=31|issue=6|year=1988|id=ISSN 0001-0782}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Until 1956 - Debugging oriented&lt;ref&gt;''until 1956 it was the debugging oriented period, when testing was often associated to debugging: there was no clear difference between testing and debugging.'' {{cite journal|first=D.|last=Gelperin|coauthors=B. Hetzel|title=The Growth of Software Testing|journal=CACM|volume=31|issue=6|year=1988|id=ISSN 0001-0782}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1957–1978 - Demonstration oriented&lt;ref&gt;''From 1957–1978 there was the demonstration oriented period where debugging and testing was distinguished now - in this period it was shown, that software satisfies the requirements.'' {{cite journal|first=D.|last=Gelperin|coauthors=B.

== Software testing topics ==
=== Scope ===
A primary purpose of testing is to detect software failures so that defects may be discovered and corrected. This is a non-trivial pursuit. Testing cannot establish that a product functions properly under all conditions but can only establish that it does not function properly under specific conditions.&lt;ref name=Kaner1&gt;{{cite book | last = Kaner | first = Cem | authorlink = Cem Kaner | coauthors =Falk, Jack and Nguyen, Hung Quoc | title = Testing Computer Software, 2nd Ed. | publisher = John Wiley and Sons, Inc. | year = 1999 | location = New York, et al | pages = 480 pages | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-471-35846-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scope of software testing often includes examination of code as well as execution of that code in various environments and conditions as well as examining the aspects of code: does it do what it is supposed to do and do what it needs to do. In the current culture of software development, a testing organization may be separate from the development team. There are various roles for testing team members. Information derived from software testing may be used to correct the process by which software is developed.&lt;ref name=&quot;kolawa&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Kolawa | first = Adam | coauthors = Huizinga, Dorota | title = Automated Defect Prevention: Best Practices in Software Management | url = http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470042125.html | year = 2007 | publisher = Wiley-IEEE Computer Society Press | location =| pages=41–43 | isbn = 0470042125 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Functional vs non-functional testing===
Functional testing refers to activities that verify a specific action or function of the code. These are usually found in the code requirements documentation, although some development methodologies work from use cases or user stories. Functional tests tend to answer the question of &quot;can the user do this&quot; or &quot;does this particular feature work&quot;.

Non-functional testing refers to aspects of the software that may not be related to a specific function or user action, such as scalability or security. Non-functional testing tends to answer such questions as &quot;how many people can log in at once&quot;.

===Defects and failures===
Not all software defects are caused by coding errors. One common source of expensive defects is caused by requirement gaps, e.g., unrecognized requirements, that result in errors of omission by the program designer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kolawa | first = Adam | coauthors = Huizinga, Dorota | title = Automated Defect Prevention: Best Practices in Software Management | url = http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470042125.html | year = 2007 | publisher = Wiley-IEEE Computer Society Press | location =| page=86| pages =426 | isbn = 0470042125 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A common source of requirements gaps is non-functional requirements such as testability, scalability, maintainability, usability, performance, and security.

Software faults occur through the following processes. A programmer makes an error (mistake), which results in a defect (fault, bug) in the software source code. If this defect is executed, in certain situations the system will produce wrong results, causing a failure.&lt;ref name=&quot;ctfl&quot;&gt;Section 1.1.2, [http://www.istqb.org/downloads/syllabi/SyllabusFoundation.pdf Certified Tester Foundation Level Syllabus], International Software Testing Qualifications Board&lt;/ref&gt; Not all defects will necessarily result in failures. For example, defects in dead code will never result in failures. A defect can turn into a failure when the environment is changed. Examples of these changes in environment include the software being run on a new hardware platform, alterations in source data or interacting with different software.&lt;ref name=&quot;ctfl&quot; /&gt; A single defect may result in a wide range of failure symptoms.

=== Finding faults early ===
It is commonly believed that the earlier a defect is found the cheaper it is to fix it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kaner | first = Cem | authorlink = Cem_Kaner | coauthors = James Bach, Bret Pettichord | title=Lessons Learned in Software Testing: A Context-Driven Approach | publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|Wiley |year=2001 | isbn = 0-471-08112-4 | page=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The following table shows the cost of fixing the defect depending on the stage it was found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |

 title = Code Complete |

 publisher = Microsoft Press |year=2004 |

 isbn = 0-7356-1967-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if a problem in the requirements is found only post-release, then it would cost 10–100 times more to fix than if it had already been found by the requirements review.

===Compatibility===
A common cause of software failure (real or perceived) is a lack of compatibility with other application software, operating systems (or operating system versions, old or new), or target environments that differ greatly from the original (such as a terminal or GUI application intended to be run on the desktop now being required to become a web application, which must render in a web browser). For example, in the case of a lack of backward compatibility, this can occur because the programmers develop and test software only on the latest version of the target environment, which not all users may be running. This results in the unintended consequence that the latest work may not function on earlier versions of the target environment, or on older hardware that earlier versions of the target environment was capable of using. Sometimes such issues can be fixed by proactively abstracting operating system functionality into a separate program module or library.

===Input combinations and preconditions===
A very fundamental problem with software testing is that testing under ''all'' combinations of inputs and preconditions (initial state) is not feasible, even with a simple product.&lt;ref name=Kaner1&gt;pp 17–18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Principle 2, Section 1.3, [http://www.bcs.org/upload/pdf/istqbsyll.pdf Certified Tester Foundation Level Syllabus], International Software Testing Qualifications Board&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the number of defects in a software product can be very large and defects that occur infrequently are difficult to find in testing. More significantly, non-functional dimensions of quality (how it is supposed to ''be'' versus what it is supposed to ''do'')—usability, scalability, performance, compatibility, reliability&amp;mdash;can be highly subjective; something that constitutes sufficient value to one person may be intolerable to another.

===Static vs. dynamic testing===
There are many approaches to software testing. Reviews, walkthroughs, or inspections are considered as static testing, whereas actually executing programmed code with a given set of test cases is referred to as dynamic testing. Static testing can be (and unfortunately in practice often is) omitted. Dynamic testing takes place when the program itself is used for the first time (which is generally considered the beginning of the testing stage). Dynamic testing may begin before the program is 100% complete in order to test particular sections of code (modules or discrete functions). Typical techniques for this are either using stubs/drivers or execution from a debugger environment. For example, spreadsheet programs are, by their very nature, tested to a large extent interactively (&quot;on the fly&quot;), with results displayed immediately after each calculation or text manipulation.

===Software verification and validation===
Software testing is used in association with verification and validation:&lt;ref name=&quot;tran&quot;&gt;{{cite book
|last=Tran | first=Eushiuan | editor=Koopman, P. | title=Topics in Dependable Embedded Systems | location=USA | publisher=Carnegie Mellon University | year=1999 | chapter=Verification/Validation/Certification |chapterurl=http://www.ece.cmu.edu/~koopman/des_s99/verification/index.html | accessdate=2008-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Verification: Have we built the software right? (i.e., does it match the specification).
* Validation: Have we built the right software? (i.e., is this what the customer wants).

The terms verification and validation are commonly used interchangeably in the industry; it is also common to see these two terms incorrectly defined. According to the IEEE Standard Glossary of Software Engineering Terminology:
:Verification is the process of evaluating a system or component to determine whether the products of a given development phase satisfy the conditions imposed at the start of that phase.
:Validation is the process of evaluating a system or component during or at the end of the development process to determine whether it satisfies specified requirements.

===The software testing team===
Software testing can be done by software testers. Until the 1980s the term &quot;software tester&quot; was used generally, but later it was also seen as a separate profession. Regarding the periods and the different goals in software testing,&lt;ref&gt;see D. Gelperin and W.C. Hetzel&lt;/ref&gt; different roles have been established: ''manager'', ''test lead'', ''test designer'', ''tester'', ''automation developer'', and ''test administrator''.

=== Software quality assurance (SQA) ===
Though controversial, software testing is a part of the software quality assurance (SQA) process.&lt;ref name=Kaner1&gt;p 347&lt;/ref&gt; In SQA, software process specialists and auditors are concerned for the software development process rather than just the artefacts such as documentation, code and systems. They examine and change the software engineering process itself to reduce the amount of faults that end up in the delivered software: the so-called ''defect rate.''

What constitutes an &quot;acceptable defect rate&quot; depends on the nature of the software; A flight simulator video game would have much higher defect tolerance than software for an actual airplane.

Although there are close links with SQA, testing departments often exist independently, and there may be no SQA function in some companies.

Software testing is a task intended to detect defects in software by contrasting a computer program's expected results with its actual results for a given set of inputs. By contrast, QA (quality assurance) is the implementation of policies and procedures intended to prevent defects from occurring in the first place.

== Testing methods ==
=== The box approach ===
Software testing methods are traditionally divided into white- and black-box testing. These two approaches are used to describe the point of view that a test engineer takes when designing test cases.

==== White box testing ====
'''White box testing''' is when the tester has access to the internal data structures and algorithms including the code that implement these.

;Types of white box testing
:The following types of white box testing exist:
:* API testing (application programming interface) - testing of the application using public and private APIs
:* Code coverage - creating tests to satisfy some criteria of code coverage (e.g., the test designer can create tests to cause all statements in the program to be executed at least once)
:* Fault injection methods - improving the coverage of a test by introducing faults to test code paths
:* Mutation testing methods
:* Static testing - White box testing includes all static testing

;Test coverage
:White box testing methods can also be used to evaluate the completeness of a test suite that was created with black box testing methods. This allows the software team to examine parts of a system that are rarely tested and ensures that the most important function points have been tested.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bullseye.com/coverage.html#intro Introduction], Code Coverage Analysis, Steve Cornett&lt;/ref&gt;

:Two common forms of code coverage are:
:* ''Function coverage'', which reports on functions executed
:* ''Statement coverage'', which reports on the number of lines executed to complete the test

They both return a code coverage metric, measured as a percentage.

==== Black box testing ====
Black box testing treats the software as a &quot;black box&quot;&amp;mdash;without any knowledge of internal implementation. Black box testing methods include: equivalence partitioning, boundary value analysis, all-pairs testing, fuzz testing, model-based testing, exploratory testing and specification-based testing.

:'''Specification-based testing''': Specification-based testing aims to test the functionality of software according to the applicable requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Laycock | first = G. T. | title = The Theory and Practice of Specification Based Software Testing | publisher = Dept of Computer Science, Sheffield University, UK | year = 1993 | url =http://www.mcs.le.ac.uk/people/gtl1/thesis.ps.gz | format = PostScript| accessdate = 2008-02-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the tester inputs data into, and only sees the output from, the test object. This level of testing usually requires thorough test cases to be provided to the tester, who then can simply verify that for a given input, the output value (or behavior), either &quot;is&quot; or &quot;is not&quot; the same as the expected value specified in the test case.

:Specification-based testing is necessary, but it is insufficient to guard against certain risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:'''Advantages and disadvantages''': The black box tester has no &quot;bonds&quot; with the code, and a tester's perception is very simple: a code ''must'' have bugs. Using the principle, &quot;Ask and you shall receive,&quot; black box testers find bugs where programmers do not. On the other hand, black box testing has been said to be &quot;like a walk in a dark labyrinth without a flashlight,&quot; because the tester doesn't know how the software being tested was actually constructed. As a result, there are situations when (1) a tester writes many test cases to check something that could have been tested by only one test case, and/or (2) some parts of the back-end are not tested at all.

Therefore, black box testing has the advantage of &quot;an unaffiliated opinion&quot;, on the one hand, and the disadvantage of &quot;blind exploring&quot;, on the other.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Savenkov | first = Roman | title=How to Become a Software Tester|publisher=Roman Savenkov Consulting|year=2008|isbn = 978-0-615-23372-7|page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Grey box testing ====
'''Grey box testing''' (American spelling: '''gray box testing''') involves having knowledge of internal data structures and algorithms for purposes of designing the test cases, but testing at the user, or black-box level. Manipulating input data and formatting output do not qualify as grey box, because the input and output are clearly outside of the &quot;black-box&quot; that we are calling the system under test. This distinction is particularly important when conducting integration testing between two modules of code written by two different developers, where only the interfaces are exposed for test. However, modifying a data repository does qualify as grey box, as the user would not normally be able to change the data outside of the system under test. Grey box testing may also include reverse engineering to determine, for instance, boundary values or error messages.

==Testing levels==
Tests are frequently grouped by where they are added in the software development process, or by the level of specificity of the test.

=== Unit testing ===
'''Unit testing''' refers to tests that verify the functionality of a specific section of code, usually at the function level. In an object-oriented environment, this is usually at the class level, and the minimal unit tests include the constructors and destructors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Binder | first = Robert V.|title=Testing Object-Oriented Systems: Objects, Patterns, and Tools|publisher=Addison-Wesley Professional|year=1999|isbn= 0-201-80938-9|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These type of tests are usually written by developers as they work on code (white-box style), to ensure that the specific function is working as expected. One function might have multiple tests, to catch corner cases or other branches in the code. Unit testing alone cannot verify the functionality of a piece of software, but rather is used to assure that the building blocks the software uses work independently of each other.

Unit testing is also called ''component testing''.

=== Integration testing ===
'''Integration testing''' is any type of software testing that seeks to verify the interfaces between components against a software design. Software components may be integrated in an iterative way or all together (&quot;big bang&quot;). Normally the former is considered a better practice since it allows interface issues to be localised more quickly and fixed.

Integration testing works to expose defects in the interfaces and interaction between integrated components (modules). Progressively larger groups of tested software components corresponding to elements of the architectural design are integrated and tested until the software works as a system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Boris|last=Beizer|title=Software Testing Techniques|year=1990|edition=Second|isbn=0-442-20672-0|pages=21,430|publisher=Van Nostrand Reinhold|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== System testing ===
System testing tests a completely integrated system to verify that it meets its requirements.&lt;ref name=&quot;ieee&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=IEEE|title=IEEE Standard Computer Dictionary: A Compilation of IEEE Standard Computer Glossaries|publisher=IEEE|location=New York|year=1990|isbn= 1559370793}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== System integration testing ===
System integration testing verifies that a system is integrated to any external or third-party systems defined in the system requirements.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

=== Regression testing ===
'''Regression testing''' focuses on finding defects after a major code change has occurred. Specifically, it seeks to uncover software regressions, or old bugs that have come back. Such regressions occur whenever software functionality that was previously working correctly stops working as intended. Typically, regressions occur as an unintended consequence of program changes, when the newly developed part of the software collides with the previously existing code. Common methods of regression testing include re-running previously run tests and checking whether previously fixed faults have re-emerged. The depth of testing depends on the phase in the release process and the risk of the added features. They can either be complete, for changes added late in the release or deemed to be risky, to very shallow, consisting of positive tests on each feature, if the changes are early in the release or deemed to be of low risk.

=== Acceptance testing ===
Acceptance testing can mean one of two things:
# A smoke test is used as an acceptance test prior to introducing a new build to the main testing process, i.e. before integration or regression.
# Acceptance testing performed by the customer, often in their lab environment on their own hardware, is known as user acceptance testing (UAT). Acceptance testing may be performed as part of the hand-off process between any two phases of development. {{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

=== Alpha testing ===
''Alpha testing'' is simulated or actual operational testing by potential users/customers or an independent test team at the developers' site. Alpha testing is often employed for off-the-shelf software as a form of internal acceptance testing, before the software goes to beta testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = van Veenendaal | first = Erik | title = Standard glossary of terms used in Software Testing | url=http://www.astqb.org/educational-resources/glossary.php#A | accessdate = 17 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Beta testing ===
''Beta testing'' comes after alpha testing and can be considered a form of external user acceptance testing. Versions of the software, known as beta versions, are released to a limited audience outside of the programming team. The software is released to groups of people so that further testing can ensure the product has few faults or bugs. Sometimes, beta versions are made available to the open public to increase the feedback field to a maximal number of future users.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

==Non-functional testing==
Special methods exist to test non-functional aspects of software. In contrast to functional testing, which establishes the correct operation of the software (correct in that it matches the expected behavior defined in the design requirements), non-functional testing verifies that the software functions properly even when it receives invalid or unexpected inputs. Software fault injection, in the form of fuzzing, is an example of non-functional testing. Non-functional testing, especially for software, is designed to establish whether the device under test can tolerate invalid or unexpected inputs, thereby establishing the robustness of input validation routines as well as error-handling routines. Various commercial non-functional testing tools are linked from the software fault injection page; there are also numerous open-source and free software tools available that perform non-functional testing.

===Software performance testing and load testing===
Performance testing is executed to determine how fast a system or sub-system performs under a particular workload. It can also serve to validate and verify other quality attributes of the system, such as scalability, reliability and resource usage. Load testing is primarily concerned with testing that can continue to operate under a specific load, whether that be large quantities of data or a large number of users. This is generally referred to as software scalability. The related load testing activity of when performed as a non-functional activity is often referred to as ''endurance testing''.

''Volume testing'' is a way to test functionality. ''Stress testing'' is a way to test reliability. ''Load testing'' is a way to test performance. There is little agreement on what the specific goals of load testing are. The terms load testing, performance testing, reliability testing, and volume testing, are often used interchangeably.

===Stability testing===
Stability testing checks to see if the software can continuously function well in or above an acceptable period. This activity of non-functional software testing is often referred to as load (or endurance) testing.

===Usability testing===
Usability testing is needed to check if the user interface is easy to use and understand.It approach towards the use of the application.

===Security testing===
Security testing is essential for software that processes confidential data to prevent system intrusion by hackers.

===Internationalization and localization===
The general ability of software to be internationalized and localized can be automatically tested without actual translation, by using pseudolocalization. It will verify that the application still works, even after it has been translated into a new language or adapted for a new culture (such as different currencies or time zones).&lt;ref&gt;[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/goglobal/bb688148 Globalization Step-by-Step: The World-Ready Approach to Testing. Microsoft Developer Network]&lt;/ref&gt;

Actual translation to human languages must be tested, too. Possible localization failures include:
* Software is often localized by translating a list of strings out of context, and the translator may choose the wrong translation for an ambiguous source string.
* If several people translate strings, technical terminology may become inconsistent.
* Literal word-for-word translations may sound inappropriate, artificial or too technical in the target language.
* Untranslated messages in the original language may be left hard coded in the source code.
* Some messages may be created automatically in run time and the resulting string may be ungrammatical, functionally incorrect, misleading or confusing.
* Software may use a keyboard shortcut which has no function on the source language's keyboard layout, but is used for typing characters in the layout of the target language.
* Software may lack support for the character encoding of the target language.
* Fonts and font sizes which are appropriate in the source language, may be inappropriate in the target language; for example, CJK characters may become unreadable if the font is too small.
* A string in the target language may be longer than the software can handle. This may make the string partly invisible to the user or cause the software to fail.
* Software may lack proper support for reading or writing bi-directional text.
* Software may display images with text that wasn't localized.
* Localized operating systems may have differently-named system configuration files and environment variables and different formats for date and currency.
To avoid these and other localization problems, a tester who knows the target language must run the program with all the possible use cases for translation to see if the messages are readable, translated correctly in context and don't cause failures.

=== Destructive testing ===
Destructive testing attempts to cause the software or a sub-system to fail, in order to test its robustness.

== The testing process ==
===Traditional CMMI or waterfall development model===
A common practice of software testing is that testing is performed by an independent group of testers after the functionality is developed, before it is shipped to the customer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etestinghub.com/testing_lifecycles.php#2 e)Testing Phase in Software Testing:-]&lt;/ref&gt; This practice often results in the testing phase being used as a project buffer to compensate for project delays, thereby compromising the time devoted to testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Glenford J.|last=Myers|title=The Art of Software Testing|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year=1979|isbn=0-471-04328-1|pages=145–146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another practice is to start software testing at the same moment the project starts and it is a continuous process until the project finishes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Dustin | first = Elfriede | title=Effective Software Testing|publisher=Addison Wesley|year=2002|isbn = 0-20179-429-2|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agile or Extreme development model===
In counterpoint, some emerging software disciplines such as extreme programming and the agile software development movement, adhere to a &quot;test-driven software development&quot; model. In this process, unit tests are written first, by the software engineers (often with pair programming in the extreme programming methodology). Of course these tests fail initially; as they are expected to. Then as code is written it passes incrementally larger portions of the test suites. The test suites are continuously updated as new failure conditions and corner cases are discovered, and they are integrated with any regression tests that are developed. Unit tests are maintained along with the rest of the software source code and generally integrated into the build process (with inherently interactive tests being relegated to a partially manual build acceptance process). The ultimate goal of this test process is to achieve continuous deployment where software updates can be published to the public frequently.

===A sample testing cycle===
Although variations exist between organizations, there is a typical cycle for testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book
|url=http://www.ece.cmu.edu/~koopman/des_s99/sw_testing/
|contribution=Software Testing (18-849b Dependable Embedded Systems)

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sample below is common among organizations employing the Waterfall development model.
* '''Requirements analysis''': Testing should begin in the requirements phase of the software development life cycle. During the design phase, testers work with developers in determining what aspects of a design are testable and with what parameters those tests work.
* '''Test planning''': Test strategy, test plan, testbed creation. Since many activities will be carried out during testing, a plan is needed.
*''' Test development''': Test procedures, test scenarios, test cases, test datasets, test scripts to use in testing software.
* '''Test execution''': Testers execute the software based on the plans and test documents then report any errors found to the development team.
* '''Test reporting''': Once testing is completed, testers generate metrics and make final reports on their test effort and whether or not the software tested is ready for release.
* '''Test result analysis''': Or Defect Analysis, is done by the development team usually along with the client, in order to decide what defects should be treated, fixed, rejected (i.e. found software working properly) or deferred to be dealt with later.
* '''Defect Retesting''': Once a defect has been dealt with by the development team, it is retested by the testing team. AKA Resolution testing.
* '''Regression testing''': It is common to have a small test program built of a subset of tests, for each integration of new, modified, or fixed software, in order to ensure that the latest delivery has not ruined anything, and that the software product as a whole is still working correctly.
* '''Test Closure''': Once the test meets the exit criteria, the activities such as capturing the key outputs, lessons learned, results, logs, documents related to the project are archived and used as a reference for future projects.

== Automated testing ==
Many programming groups are relying more and more on automated testing, especially groups that use
test-driven development. There are many frameworks to write tests in, and continuous integration software will run tests automatically every time code is checked into a version control system.

While automation cannot reproduce everything that a human can do (and all the ways they think of doing it), it can be very useful for regression testing. However, it does require a well-developed test suite of testing scripts in order to be truly useful.

===Testing tools===
Program testing and fault detection can be aided significantly by testing tools and debuggers.
Testing/debug tools include features such as:
* Program monitors, permitting full or partial monitoring of program code including:
** Instruction set simulator, permitting complete instruction level monitoring and trace facilities
** Program animation, permitting step-by-step execution and conditional breakpoint at source level or in machine code
** Code coverage reports
* Formatted dump or symbolic debugging, tools allowing inspection of program variables on error or at chosen points
* Automated functional GUI testing tools are used to repeat system-level tests through the GUI
* Benchmarks, allowing run-time performance comparisons to be made
* Performance analysis (or profiling tools) that can help to highlight hot spots and resource usage

Some of these features may be incorporated into an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

* A regression testing technique is to have a standard set of tests, which cover existing functionality that result in persistent tabular data, and to compare pre-change data to post-change data, where there should not be differences, using a tool like diffkit.  Differences detected indicate unexpected functionality changes or &quot;regression&quot;.

=== Measurement in software testing ===
Usually, quality is constrained to such topics as correctness, completeness, security,{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} but can also include more technical requirements as described under the ISO standard ISO/IEC 9126, such as capability, reliability, efficiency, portability, maintainability, compatibility, and usability.

There are a number of frequently-used software measures, often called ''metrics'', which are used to assist in determining the state of the software or the adequacy of the testing.

==Testing artifacts==
Software testing process can produce several artifacts.

; Test plan
: A test specification is called a test plan. The developers are well aware what test plans will be executed and this information is made available to management and the developers. The idea is to make them more cautious when developing their code or making additional changes. Some companies have a higher-level document called a test strategy.
; Traceability matrix
: A traceability matrix is a table that correlates requirements or design documents to test documents. It is used to change tests when the source documents are changed, or to verify that the test results are correct.
; Test case
: A test case normally consists of a unique identifier, requirement references from a design specification, preconditions, events, a series of steps (also known as actions) to follow, input, output, expected result, and actual result. Clinically defined a test case is an input and an expected result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=IEEE|title=IEEE standard for software test documentation|publisher=IEEE|location=New York|year=1998|isbn= 0-7381-1443-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be as pragmatic as 'for condition x your derived result is y', whereas other test cases described in more detail the input scenario and what results might be expected. It can occasionally be a series of steps (but often steps are contained in a separate test procedure that can be exercised against multiple test cases, as a matter of economy) but with one expected result or expected outcome. The optional fields are a test case ID, test step, or order of execution number, related requirement(s), depth, test category, author, and check boxes for whether the test is automatable and has been automated. Larger test cases may also contain prerequisite states or steps, and descriptions. A test case should also contain a place for the actual result. These steps can be stored in a word processor document, spreadsheet, database, or other common repository. In a database system, you may also be able to see past test results, who generated the results, and what system configuration was used to generate those results. These past results would usually be stored in a separate table.
; Test script
: The test script is the combination of a test case, test procedure, and test data. Initially the term was derived from the product of work created by automated regression test tools. Today, test scripts can be manual, automated, or a combination of both.
; Test suite
: The most common term for a collection of test cases is a test suite. The test suite often also contains more detailed instructions or goals for each collection of test cases. It definitely contains a section where the tester identifies the system configuration used during testing. A group of test cases may also contain prerequisite states or steps, and descriptions of the following tests.
; Test data
: In most cases, multiple sets of values or data are used to test the same functionality of a particular feature. All the test values and changeable environmental components are collected in separate files and stored as test data. It is also useful to provide this data to the client and with the product or a project.
; Test harness
: The software, tools, samples of data input and output, and configurations are all referred to collectively as a test harness.

== Certifications ==
Several certification programs exist to support the professional aspirations of software testers and quality assurance specialists. No certification currently offered actually requires the applicant to demonstrate the ability to test software. No certification is based on a widely accepted body of knowledge. This has led some to declare that the testing field is not ready for certification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Cem|last=Kaner|year=2001|url=http://www.testingeducation.org/general/nsf_grant.pdf|format=pdf|title=NSF grant proposal to &quot;lay a foundation for significant improvements in the quality of academic and commercial courses in software testing&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certification itself cannot measure an individual's productivity, their skill, or practical knowledge, and cannot guarantee their competence, or professionalism as a tester.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.testingeducation.org/a/mest.pdf|format=pdf|first=Cem|last=Kaner|title=Measuring the Effectiveness of Software Testers|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
Some of the major software testing controversies include:

;What constitutes responsible software testing? : Members of the &quot;context-driven&quot; school of testing&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.context-driven-testing.com context-driven-testing.com]&lt;/ref&gt; believe that there are no &quot;best practices&quot; of testing, but rather that testing is a set of skills that allow the tester to select or invent testing practices to suit each unique situation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.technicat.com/writing/process.html Article on taking agile traits without the agile method.]&lt;/ref&gt;

; Agile vs. traditional : Should testers learn to work under conditions of uncertainty and constant change or should they aim at process &quot;maturity&quot;? The agile testing movement has received growing popularity since 2006 mainly in commercial circles,&lt;ref&gt;[http://stpcollaborative.com/knowledge/272-were-all-part-of-the-story “We’re all part of the story”] by David Strom, July 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/login.jsp?url=/iel5/10705/33795/01609838.pdf?temp=x IEEE article about differences in adoption of agile trends between experienced managers vs. young students of the Project Management Institute].

Addison Wesley, 1999, ISBN 0-201-33140-3.&lt;/ref&gt; More in particular, test-driven development states that developers should write unit-tests of the XUnit type before coding the functionality. The tests then can be considered as a way to capture and implement the requirements.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In computer programming, '''unit testing''' is a method by which individual units of source code are tested to determine if they are fit for use. A unit is the smallest testable part of an application. In procedural programming a unit may be an individual function or procedure. Unit tests are created by programmers or occasionally by white box testers.

Ideally, each test case is independent from the others: substitutes like method stubs, mock objects,&lt;ref name=&quot;mocksarentstubs&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html|title=Mocks aren't Stubs|date=2007-01-02|last=Fowler|first=Martin|authorlink=Martin Fowler|accessdate=2008-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; fakes and test harnesses can be used to assist testing a module in isolation. Unit tests are typically written and run by software developers to ensure that code meets its design and behaves as intended. Its implementation can vary from being very manual (pencil and paper) to being formalized as part of build automation.

== Benefits ==
The goal of unit testing is to isolate each part of the program and show that the individual parts are correct.&lt;ref name=&quot;kolawa&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Kolawa | first = Adam | coauthors = Huizinga, Dorota | title = Automated Defect Prevention: Best Practices in Software Management | url = http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470042125.html | year = 2007 | publisher = Wiley-IEEE Computer Society Press | location =| page=75| pages =426 | isbn = 0470042125 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A unit test provides a strict, written contract that the piece of code must satisfy. As a result, it affords several benefits. Unit tests find problems early in the development cycle.

=== Facilitates change ===
Unit testing allows the programmer to refactor code at a later date, and make sure the module still works correctly (e.g., in regression testing). The procedure is to write test cases for all functions and methods so that whenever a change causes a fault, it can be quickly identified and fixed.

Readily-available unit tests make it easy for the programmer to check whether a piece of code is still working properly.

In continuous unit testing environments, through the inherent practice of sustained maintenance, unit tests will continue to accurately reflect the intended use of the executable and code in the face of any change. Depending upon established development practices and unit test coverage, up-to-the-second accuracy can be maintained.
In unit testing we test each the module separately.

=== Simplifies integration ===
Unit testing may reduce uncertainty in the units themselves and can be used in a bottom-up testing style approach. By testing the parts of a program first and then testing the sum of its parts, integration testing becomes much easier.

An elaborate hierarchy of unit tests does not equal integration testing. Integration with peripheral units should be included in integration tests, but not in unit tests.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} Integration testing typically still relies heavily on humans testing manually; high-level or global-scope testing can be difficult to automate, such that manual testing often appears faster and cheaper.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

=== Documentation ===
Unit testing provides a sort of living documentation of the system. Developers looking to learn what functionality is provided by a unit and how to use it can look at the unit tests to gain a basic understanding of the unit's API.

Unit test cases embody characteristics that are critical to the success of the unit. These characteristics can indicate appropriate/inappropriate use of a unit as well as negative behaviors that are to be trapped by the unit. A unit test case, in and of itself, documents these critical characteristics, although many software development environments do not rely solely upon code to document the product in development.

By contrast, ordinary narrative documentation is more susceptible to drifting from the implementation of the program and will thus become outdated (e.g., design changes, feature creep, relaxed practices in keeping documents up-to-date).

=== Design ===
When software is developed using a test-driven approach, the unit test may take the place of formal design. Each unit test can be seen as a design element specifying classes, methods, and observable behaviour. The following Java example will help illustrate this point.

Here is a test class that specifies a number of elements of the implementation. First, that there must be an interface called Adder, and an implementing class with a zero-argument constructor called AdderImpl. It goes on to assert that the Adder interface should have a method called add, with two integer parameters, which returns another integer. It also specifies the behaviour of this method for a small range of values.

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
public class TestAdder {
    public void testSum() {
        Adder adder = new AdderImpl();
        assert(adder.add(1, 1) == 2);
        assert(adder.add(1, 2) == 3);
        assert(adder.add(2, 2) == 4);
        assert(adder.add(0, 0) == 0);
        assert(adder.add(-1, -2) == -3);
        assert(adder.add(-1, 1) == 0);
        assert(adder.add(1234, 988) == 2222);
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

In this case the unit test, having been written first, acts as a design document specifying the form and behaviour of a desired solution, but not the implementation details, which are left for the programmer. Following the &quot;do the simplest thing that could possibly work&quot; practice, the easiest solution that will make the test pass is shown below.

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
interface Adder {
    int add(int a, int b);
}
class AdderImpl implements Adder {
    int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Unlike other diagram-based design methods, using a unit-test as a design has one significant advantage. The design document (the unit-test itself) can be used to verify that the implementation adheres to the design. With the unit-test design method, the tests will never pass if the developer does not implement the solution according to the design.

It is true that unit testing lacks some of the accessibility of a diagram, but UML diagrams are now easily generated for most modern languages by free tools (usually available as extensions to IDEs). Free tools, like those based on the xUnit framework, outsource to another system the graphical rendering of a view for human consumption.

== Separation of interface from implementation ==
Because some classes may have references to other classes, testing a class can frequently spill over into testing another class. A common example of this is classes that depend on a database: in order to test the class, the tester often writes code that interacts with the database. This is a mistake, because a unit test should usually not go outside of its own class boundary, and especially should not cross such process/network boundaries because this can introduce unacceptable performance problems to the unit test-suite. Crossing such unit boundaries turns unit tests into integration tests, and when test cases fail, makes it less clear which component is causing the failure. See also Fakes, mocks and integration tests

Instead, the software developer should create an abstract interface around the database queries, and then implement that interface with their own mock object. By abstracting this necessary attachment from the code (temporarily reducing the net effective coupling), the independent unit can be more thoroughly tested than may have been previously achieved. This results in a higher quality unit that is also more maintainable.

== Unit testing limitations ==
Testing cannot be expected to catch every error in the program: it is impossible to evaluate every execution path in all but the most trivial programs. The same is true for unit testing. Additionally, unit testing by definition only tests the functionality of the units themselves. Therefore, it will not catch integration errors or broader system-level errors (such as functions performed across multiple units, or non-functional test areas such as performance). Unit testing should be done in conjunction with other software testing activities. Like all forms of software testing, unit tests can only show the presence of errors; they cannot show the absence of errors.

Software testing is a combinatorial problem. For example, every boolean decision statement requires at least two tests: one with an outcome of &quot;true&quot; and one with an outcome of &quot;false&quot;. As a result, for every line of code written, programmers often need 3 to 5 lines of test code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cramblitt|first=Bob|author-link=Bob Cramblitt| title=Alberto Savoia sings the praises of software testing|date=2007-09-20| accessdate=2007-11-29|url=http://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/originalContent/0,289142,sid92_gci1273161,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; This obviously takes time and its investment may not be worth the effort. There are also many problems that cannot easily be tested at all &amp;ndash; for example those that are nondeterministic or involve multiple threads. In addition, writing code for a unit test is as likely to be at least as buggy as the code it is testing. Fred Brooks in The Mythical Man-Month quotes: ''never take two chronometers to sea. Always take one or three.'' Meaning, if two chronometers contradict, how do you know which one is correct?

To obtain the intended benefits from unit testing, rigorous discipline is needed throughout the software development process. It is essential to keep careful records not only of the tests that have been performed, but also of all changes that have been made to the source code of this or any other unit in the software. Use of a version control system is essential. If a later version of the unit fails a particular test that it had previously passed, the version-control software can provide a list of the source code changes (if any) that have been applied to the unit since that time.

It is also essential to implement a sustainable process for ensuring that test case failures are reviewed daily and addressed immediately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=daVeiga|first=Nada|author-link=Nada daVeiga| title=Change Code Without Fear: Utilize a regression safety net|date=2008-02-06| accessdate=2008-02-08|url=http://www.ddj.com/development-tools/206105233}}&lt;/ref&gt; If such a process is not implemented and ingrained into the team's workflow, the application will evolve out of sync with the unit test suite, increasing false positives and reducing the effectiveness of the test suite.

== Applications ==
=== Extreme Programming ===

Unit testing is the cornerstone of Extreme Programming, which relies on an automated unit testing framework. This automated unit testing framework can be either third party, e.g., xUnit, or created within the development group.

Extreme Programming uses the creation of unit tests for test-driven development. The developer writes a unit test that exposes either a software requirement or a defect. This test will fail because either the requirement isn't implemented yet, or because it intentionally exposes a defect in the existing code. Then, the developer writes the simplest code to make the test, along with other tests, pass.

Most code in a system is unit tested, but not necessarily all paths through the code. Extreme Programming mandates a &quot;test everything that can possibly break&quot; strategy, over the traditional &quot;test every execution path&quot; method. This leads developers to develop fewer tests than classical methods, but this isn't really a problem, more a restatement of fact, as classical methods have rarely ever been followed methodically enough for all execution paths to have been thoroughly tested.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} Extreme Programming simply recognizes that testing is rarely exhaustive (because it is often too expensive and time-consuming to be economically viable) and provides guidance on how to effectively focus limited resources.

Crucially, the test code is considered a first class project artifact in that it is maintained at the same quality as the implementation code, with all duplication removed. Developers release unit testing code to the code repository in conjunction with the code it tests. Extreme Programming's thorough unit testing allows the benefits mentioned above, such as simpler and more confident code development and refactoring, simplified code integration, accurate documentation, and more modular designs. These unit tests are also constantly run as a form of regression test.

=== Techniques ===

Unit testing is commonly automated, but may still be performed manually. The IEEE does not favor one over the other.&lt;ref&gt;IEEE Standards Board, [http://iteso.mx/~pgutierrez/calidad/Estandares/IEEE%201008.pdf &quot;IEEE Standard for Software Unit Testing: An American National Standard, ANSI/IEEE Std 1008-1987&quot;] in ''IEEE Standards: Software Engineering, Volume Two: Process Standards; 1999 Edition; published by The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.'' Software Engineering Technical Committee of the IEEE Computer Society.&lt;/ref&gt; A manual approach to unit testing may employ a step-by-step instructional document. Nevertheless, the objective in unit testing is to isolate a unit and validate its correctness. Automation is efficient for achieving this, and enables the many benefits listed in this article. Conversely, if not planned carefully, a careless manual unit test case may execute as an integration test case that involves many software components, and thus preclude the achievement of most if not all of the goals established for unit testing.

To fully realize the effect of isolation while using an automated approach, the unit or code body under test is executed within a framework outside of its natural environment. In other words, it is executed outside of the product or calling context for which it was originally created. Testing in such an isolated manner reveals unnecessary dependencies between the code being tested and other units or data spaces in the product. These dependencies can then be eliminated.

Using an automation framework, the developer codes criteria into the test to verify the unit's correctness. During test case execution, the framework logs tests that fail any criterion. Many frameworks will also automatically flag these failed test cases and report them in a summary. Depending upon the severity of a failure, the framework may halt subsequent testing.

As a consequence, unit testing is traditionally a motivator for programmers to create decoupled and cohesive code bodies. This practice promotes healthy habits in software development. Design patterns, unit testing, and refactoring often work together so that the best solution may emerge.

=== Unit testing frameworks ===
Unit testing frameworks are most often third-party products that are not distributed as part of the compiler suite. They help simplify the process of unit testing, having been developed for a wide variety of languages. Examples of testing frameworks include open source solutions such as the various code-driven testing frameworks known collectively as xUnit, and proprietary/commercial solutions such as TBrun, Testwell CTA++ and VectorCAST/C++.

It is generally possible to perform unit testing without the support of a specific framework by writing client code that exercises the units under test and uses assertions, exception handling, or other control flow mechanisms to signal failure. Unit testing without a framework is valuable in that there is a barrier to entry for the adoption of unit testing; having scant unit tests is hardly better than having none at all, whereas once a framework is in place, adding unit tests becomes relatively easy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bullseye.com/coverage.html#intermediate|accessdate=24 March 2009|title=Intermediate Coverage Goals|author=Bullseye Testing Technology|date=2006&amp;ndash;2008|publication-place}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some frameworks many advanced unit test features are missing or must be hand-coded.

=== Language-level unit testing support ===

Some programming languages support unit testing directly (Eg. Java). Their grammar allows the direct declaration of unit tests without importing a library (whether third party or standard). Additionally, the boolean conditions of the unit tests can be expressed in the same syntax as boolean expressions used in non-unit test code, such as what is used for &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;while&lt;/tt&gt; statements.

Languages that directly support unit testing include:

In software engineering, '''program profiling''', '''software profiling''' or simply '''profiling''', a form of dynamic program analysis (as opposed to static code analysis), is the investigation of a program's behavior using information gathered as the program executes. The usual purpose of this analysis is to determine which sections of a program to optimize - to increase its overall speed, decrease its memory requirement or sometimes both. 

* A '''(code) profiler''' is a '''performance analysis''' tool that, most commonly, measures only the frequency and duration of function calls, but there are other specific types of profilers (e.g. memory profilers&lt;!--plenty of hist on gbooks for this--&gt;) in addition to more comprehensive profilers, capable of gathering extensive performance data.
* An instruction set simulator which is also &amp;mdash; by necessity &amp;mdash; a profiler, can measure the totality of a program's behaviour from invocation to termination.

== Gathering program events ==
Profilers use a wide variety of techniques to collect data, including hardware interrupts, code instrumentation, instruction set simulation, operating system hooks, and performance counters. The usage of profilers is 'called out' in the performance engineering process.

== Use of profilers ==
''Program analysis tools are extremely important for understanding program behavior. Computer architects need such tools to evaluate how well programs will perform on new architectures. Software writers need tools to analyze their programs and identify critical sections of code. Compiler writers often use such tools to find out how well their instruction scheduling or branch prediction algorithm is performing...'' (ATOM, PLDI, '94)

The output of a profiler may be:- 

* A statistical ''summary'' of the events observed (a '''profile''')
:Summary profile information is often shown annotated against the source code statements where the events occur, so the size of measurement data is linear to the code size of the program.
:&lt;code&gt;
 /* ------------ source------------------------- count */             
 0001             IF X = &quot;A&quot;                     0055
 0002                THEN DO                       
 0003                  ADD 1 to XCOUNT           0032
 0004                ELSE
 0005             IF X = &quot;B&quot;                     0055
&lt;/code&gt;
* A stream of recorded events (a '''trace''')
:For sequential programs, a summary profile is usually sufficient, but performance problems in parallel programs (waiting for messages or synchronization issues) often depend on the time relationship of events, thus requiring a full trace to get an understanding of what is happening.
: The size of a (full) trace is linear to the program's instruction path length, making it somewhat impractical. A trace may therefore be initiated at one point in a program and terminated at another point to limit the output.
* An ongoing interaction with the hypervisor (continuous or periodic monitoring via on-screen display for instance)
: This provides the opportunity to switch a trace on or off at any desired point during execution in addition to viewing on-going metrics about the (still executing) program. It also provides the opportunity to suspend asynchronous processes at critical points to examine interactions with other parallel processes in more detail.

==History==
Performance analysis tools existed on IBM/360 and IBM/370 platforms from the early 1970s, usually based on timer interrupts which recorded the Program status word (PSW) at set timer intervals to detect &quot;hot spots&quot; in executing code. This was an early example of sampling (see below). In early 1974, Instruction Set Simulators permitted full trace and other performance monitoring features.

Profiler-driven program analysis on Unix dates back to at least 1979, when Unix systems included a basic tool &quot;prof&quot; that listed each function and how much of program execution time it used. In 1982, gprof extended the concept to a complete call graph analysis &lt;ref&gt;[http://docs.freebsd.org/44doc/psd/18.gprof/paper.pdf ''gprof: a Call Graph Execution Profiler'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Amitabh Srivastava and Alan Eustace of Digital Equipment Corporation published a paper describing ATOM.&lt;ref&gt;[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.119.8540 Atom: A system for building customized program analysis tools,  Amitabh Srivastava and Alan Eustace, 1994] ([http://www.ece.cmu.edu/~ece548/tools/atom/man/wrl_94_2.pdf download])&lt;/ref&gt; ATOM is a platform for converting a program into its own profiler. That is, at compile time, it inserts code into the program to be analyzed. That inserted code outputs analysis data. This technique - modifying a program to analyze itself - is known as &quot;instrumentation&quot;.

In 2004, both the gprof and ATOM papers appeared on the list of the 50 most influential PLDI papers of all time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/mckinley/20-years.html 20 Years of PLDI (1979 - 1999): A Selection, Kathryn S. McKinley, Editor]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Profiler types based on output ==
===Flat profiler ===
Flat profilers compute the average call times, from the calls, and do not break down the call times based on the callee or the context.

===Call-graph profiler===
Call graph profilers show the call times, and frequencies of the functions, and also the call-chains involved based on the callee. However context is not preserved.

==Methods of data gathering==
===Event-based profilers===
The programming languages listed here have event-based profilers:
* Java: the JVMTI (JVM Tools Interface) API, formerly JVMPI (JVM Profiling Interface), provides hooks to profilers, for trapping events like calls, class-load, unload, thread enter leave.
* .NET: Can attach a profiling agent as a COM server to the CLR. Like Java, the runtime then provides various callbacks into the agent, for trapping events like method JIT / enter / leave, object creation, etc. Particularly powerful in that the profiling agent can rewrite the target application's bytecode in arbitrary ways.
* Python: Python profiling includes the profile module, hotshot (which is call-graph based), and using the 'sys.setprofile' function to trap events like c_{call,return,exception}, python_{call,return,exception}.
* Ruby: Ruby also uses a similar interface like Python for profiling. Flat-profiler in profile.rb, module, and ruby-prof a C-extension are present.

===Statistical profilers===
Some profilers operate by sampling. A sampling profiler probes the target program's program counter at regular intervals using operating system interrupts. Sampling profiles are typically less numerically accurate and specific, but allow the target program to run at near full speed. 

The resulting data are not exact, but a statistical approximation. ''The actual amount of error is usually more than one sampling period. In fact, if a value is n times the sampling period, the expected error in it is the square-root of n sampling periods.'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://lgl.epfl.ch/teaching/case_tools/doc/gprof/gprof_12.html Statistical Inaccuracy of &lt;tt&gt;gprof&lt;/tt&gt; Output]&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, sampling profilers can often provide a more accurate picture of the target program's execution than other approaches, as they are not as intrusive to the target program, and thus don't have as many side effects (such as on memory caches or instruction decoding pipelines). Also since they don't affect the execution speed as much, they can detect issues that would otherwise be hidden. They are also relatively immune to over-evaluating the cost of small, frequently called routines or 'tight' loops. They can show the relative amount of time spent in user mode versus interruptible kernel mode such as system call processing.

Still, kernel code to handle the interrupts entails a minor loss of CPU cycles, diverted cache usage, and is unable to distinguish the various tasks occurring in uninterruptible kernel code (microsecond-range activity).

Dedicated hardware can go beyond this: some recent MIPS processors JTAG interface have a PCSAMPLE register, which samples the program counter in a truly undetectable manner. 

Some of the most commonly used statistical profilers are AMD CodeAnalyst, Apple Inc. Shark, gprof, Intel VTune and Parallel Amplifier (part of Intel Parallel Studio).

===Instrumenting profilers===
Some profilers '''instrument''' the target program with additional instructions to collect the required information. 

Instrumenting the program can cause changes in the performance of the program, potentially causing inaccurate results and heisenbugs. Instrumenting will always have some impact on the program execution, typically always slowing it. However, instrumentation can be very specific and be carefully controlled to have a minimal impact. The impact on a particular program depends on the placement of instrumentation points and the mechanism used to capture the trace. Hardware support for trace capture means that on some targets, instrumentation can be on just one machine instruction. The impact of instrumentation can often be deducted (i.e. eliminated by subtraction) from the results.

gprof is an example of a profiler that uses both instrumentation and sampling. Instrumentation is used to gather caller information and the actual timing values are obtained by statistical sampling.

===Instrumentation ===
* '''Manual''': Performed by the programmer, e.g. by adding instructions to explicitly calculate runtimes, simply count events or calls to measurement APIs such as the Application Response Measurement standard.
* '''Automatic source level''': instrumentation added to the source code by an automatic tool according to an instrumentation policy.
* '''Compiler assisted''': Example: &quot;gcc -pg ...&quot; for gprof, &quot;quantify g++ ...&quot; for Quantify
* '''Binary translation''': The tool adds instrumentation to a compiled binary. Example: ATOM
* '''Runtime instrumentation''': Directly before execution the code is instrumented. The program run is fully supervised and controlled by the tool. Examples: Pin, Valgrind
* '''Runtime injection''': More lightweight than runtime instrumentation. Code is modified at runtime to have jumps to helper functions. Example: DynInst

===Interpreter instrumentation===
* '''Interpreter debug''' options can enable the collection of performance metrics as the interpreter encounters each target statement. A bytecode, control table or JIT interpreters are three examples that usually have complete control over execution of the target code, thus enabling extremely comprehensive data collection opportunities.

===Hypervisor/Simulator===
* '''Hypervisor''': Data are collected by running the (usually) unmodified program under a hypervisor. Example: SIMMON
* '''Simulator''' and '''Hypervisor''': Data collected interactively and selectively by running the unmodified program under an Instruction Set Simulator. Examples: SIMON (Batch Interactive test/debug) and IBM OLIVER (CICS interactive test/debug).

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Test-driven development''' ('''TDD''') is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: first the developer writes a failing automated test case that defines a desired improvement or new function, then produces code to pass that test and finally refactors the new code to acceptable standards. Kent Beck, who is credited with having developed or 'rediscovered' the technique, stated in 2003 that TDD encourages simple designs and inspires confidence.&lt;ref name=Beck/&gt;

Test-driven development is related to the test-first programming concepts of extreme programming, begun in 1999,&lt;ref name=&quot;Cworld92&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.computerworld.com/softwaretopics/software/appdev/story/0,10801,66192,00.html |title=Extreme Programming |author=Lee Copeland |date=December 2001 |work= |publisher=Computerworld |accessdate=January 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but more recently has created more general interest in its own right.&lt;ref name=Newkirk&gt;Newkirk, JW and Vorontsov, AA. ''Test-Driven Development in Microsoft .NET'', Microsoft Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Programmers also apply the concept to improving and debugging legacy code developed with older techniques.&lt;ref name=Feathers&gt;Feathers, M. Working Effectively with Legacy Code, Prentice Hall, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

== Requirements ==
Test-driven development requires developers to create automated unit tests that define code requirements (immediately) before writing the code itself. The tests contain assertions that are either true or false. Passing the tests confirms correct behavior as developers evolve and refactor the code. Developers often use testing frameworks, such as xUnit, to create and automatically run sets of test cases.

== Test-driven development cycle ==
The following sequence is based on the book ''Test-Driven Development by Example''&lt;ref name=Beck&gt;Beck, K. Test-Driven Development by Example, Addison Wesley, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Add a test ===
In '''test-driven development''', each new feature begins with writing a test. This test must inevitably fail because it is written before the feature has been implemented. (If it does not fail, then either the proposed “new” feature already exists or the test is defective.) To write a test, the developer must clearly understand the feature's specification and requirements. The developer can accomplish this through use cases and user stories that cover the requirements and exception conditions. This could also imply a variant, or modification of an existing test. This is a differentiating feature of test-driven development versus writing unit tests ''after'' the code is written: it makes the developer focus on the requirements ''before'' writing the code, a subtle but important difference.

=== Run all tests and see if the new one fails ===
This validates that the test harness is working correctly and that the new test does not mistakenly pass without requiring any new code. This step also tests the test itself, in the negative: it rules out the possibility that the new test will always pass, and therefore be worthless.
The new test should also fail for the expected reason. This increases confidence (although it does not entirely guarantee) that it is testing the right thing, and will pass only in intended cases.

=== Write some code ===
The next step is to write some code that will cause the test to pass. The new code written at this stage will not be perfect and may, for example, pass the test in an inelegant way. That is acceptable because later steps will improve and hone it.

It is important that the code written is ''only'' designed to pass the test; no further (and therefore untested) functionality should be predicted and 'allowed for' at any stage.

=== Run the automated tests and see them succeed ===
If all test cases now pass, the programmer can be confident that the code meets all the tested requirements. This is a good point from which to begin the final step of the cycle.

=== Refactor code ===
Now the code can be cleaned up as necessary. By re-running the test cases, the developer can be confident that code refactoring is not damaging any existing functionality. The concept of removing duplication is an important aspect of any software design. In this case, however, it also applies to removing any duplication between the test code and the production code &amp;mdash; for example magic numbers or strings that were repeated in both, in order to make the test pass in step 3.

=== Repeat ===
Starting with another new test, the cycle is then repeated to push forward the functionality. The size of the steps should always be small, with as few as 1 to 10 edits between each test run. If new code does not rapidly satisfy a new test, or other tests fail unexpectedly, the programmer should undo or revert in preference to excessive debugging. Continuous Integration helps by providing revertible checkpoints. When using external libraries it is important not to make increments that are so small as to be effectively merely testing the library itself,&lt;ref name=Newkirk/&gt; unless there is some reason to believe that the library is buggy or is not sufficiently feature-complete to serve all the needs of the main program being written.

== Development style ==
There are various aspects to using test-driven development, for example the principles of &quot;keep it simple, stupid&quot; (KISS) and &quot;You ain't gonna need it&quot; (YAGNI). By focusing on writing only the code necessary to pass tests, designs can be cleaner and clearer than is often achieved by other methods.&lt;ref name=Beck/&gt; In ''Test-Driven Development by Example'' Kent Beck also suggests the principle &quot;Fake it till you make it&quot;.

To achieve some advanced design concept (such as a design pattern), tests are written that will generate that design. The code may remain simpler than the target pattern, but still pass all required tests. This can be unsettling at first but it allows the developer to focus only on what is important.

'''Write the tests first'''. The tests should be written before the functionality that is being tested. This has been claimed to have two benefits. It helps ensure that the application is written for testability, as the developers must consider how to test the application from the outset, rather than worrying about it later. It also ensures that tests for every feature will be written. When writing feature-first code, there is a tendency by developers and the development organisations to push the developer onto the next feature, neglecting testing entirely.

'''First fail the test cases'''. The idea is to ensure that the test really works and can catch an error. Once this is shown, the underlying functionality can be implemented. This has been coined the &quot;test-driven development mantra&quot;, known as red/green/refactor where red means ''fail'' and green is ''pass''. 

Test-driven development constantly repeats the steps of adding test cases that fail, passing them, and refactoring. Receiving the expected test results at each stage reinforces the programmer's mental model of the code, boosts confidence and increases productivity.

Advanced practices of test-driven development can lead to Acceptance Test-driven development (ATDD) where the criteria specified by the customer are automated into acceptance tests, which then drive the traditional unit test-driven development (UTDD) process.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koskela&quot;&gt;Koskela, L. &quot;Test Driven: TDD and Acceptance TDD for Java Developers&quot;, Manning Publications, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; This process ensures the customer has an automated mechanism to decide whether the software meets their requirements. With ATDD, the development team now has a specific target to satisfy, the acceptance tests, which keeps them continuously focused on what the customer really wants from that user story.

== Benefits ==
A 2005 study found that using TDD meant writing more tests and, in turn, programmers that wrote more tests tended to be more productive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

I hope there's a follow-up study because the productivity numbers simply don't add up very well to me. There is an undeniable correlation between productivity and the number of tests, but that correlation is actually stronger in the non-TDD group (which had a single outlier compared to roughly half of the TDD group being outside the 95% band).
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Programmers using pure TDD on new (&quot;greenfield&quot;) projects report they only rarely feel the need to invoke a debugger. Used in conjunction with a version control system, when tests fail unexpectedly, reverting the code to the last version that passed all tests may often be more productive than debugging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Test-driven development offers more than just simple validation of correctness, but can also drive the design of a program. By focusing on the test cases first, one must imagine how the functionality will be used by clients (in the first case, the test cases). So, the programmer is concerned with the interface before the implementation. This benefit is complementary to Design by Contract as it approaches code through test cases rather than through mathematical assertions or preconceptions.

Test-driven development offers the ability to take small steps when required. It allows a programmer to focus on the task at hand as the first goal is to make the test pass. Exceptional cases and error handling are not considered initially, and tests to create these extraneous circumstances are implemented separately. Test-driven development ensures in this way that all written code is covered by at least one test. This gives the programming team, and subsequent users, a greater level of confidence in the code.

While it is true that more code is required with TDD than without TDD because of the unit test code, total code implementation time is typically shorter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large numbers of tests help to limit the number of defects in the code. The early and frequent nature of the testing helps to catch defects early in the development cycle, preventing them from becoming endemic and expensive problems. Eliminating defects early in the process usually avoids lengthy and tedious debugging later in the project.

TDD can lead to more modularized, flexible, and extensible code. This effect often comes about because the methodology requires that the developers think of the software in terms of small units that can be written and tested independently and integrated together later. This leads to smaller, more focused classes, looser coupling, and cleaner interfaces. The use of the mock object design pattern also contributes to the overall modularization of the code because this pattern requires that the code be written so that modules can be switched easily between mock versions for unit testing and &quot;real&quot; versions for deployment.

Because no more code is written than necessary to pass a failing test case, automated tests tend to cover every code path. For example, in order for a TDD developer to add an &lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt; branch to an existing &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statement, the developer would first have to write a failing test case that motivates the branch. As a result, the automated tests resulting from TDD tend to be very thorough: they will detect any unexpected changes in the code's behaviour. This detects problems that can arise where a change later in the development cycle unexpectedly alters other functionality.

== Vulnerabilities ==
* Test-driven development is difficult to use in situations where full functional tests are required to determine success or failure. Examples of these are user interfaces, programs that work with databases, and some that depend on specific network configurations. TDD encourages developers to put the minimum amount of code into such modules and to maximise the logic that is in testable library code, using fakes and mocks to represent the outside world.
* Management support is essential. Without the entire organization believing that test-driven development is going to improve the product, management may feel that time spent writing tests is wasted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|format=PDF
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Unit tests created in a test-driven development environment are typically created by the developer who will also write the code that is being tested. The tests may therefore share the same blind spots with the code: If, for example, a developer does not realize that certain input parameters must be checked, most likely neither the test nor the code will verify these input parameters. If the developer misinterprets the requirements specification for the module being developed, both the tests and the code will be wrong. 
* The high number of passing unit tests may bring a false sense of security, resulting in fewer additional software testing activities, such as integration testing and compliance testing.
* The tests themselves become part of the maintenance overhead of a project. Badly written tests, for example ones that include hard-coded error strings or which are themselves prone to failure, are expensive to maintain. There is a risk that tests that regularly generate false failures will be ignored, so that when a real failure occurs it may not be detected. It is possible to write tests for low and easy maintenance, for example by the reuse of error strings, and this should be a goal during the code refactoring phase described above.
* The level of coverage and testing detail achieved during repeated TDD cycles cannot easily be re-created at a later date. Therefore these original tests become increasingly precious as time goes by. If a poor architecture, a poor design or a poor testing strategy leads to a late change that makes dozens of existing tests fail, it is important that they are individually fixed. Merely deleting, disabling or rashly altering them can lead to undetectable holes in the test coverage.

==Code Visibility==
Test suite code clearly has to be able to access the code it is testing. On the other hand normal design criteria such as information hiding, encapsulation and the separation of concerns should not be compromised. Therefore unit test code for TDD is usually written within the same project or module as the code being tested. 

In object oriented design this still does not provide access to &lt;code&gt;private&lt;/code&gt; data and methods. Therefore, extra work may be necessary for unit tests. In Java and other languages, a developer can use reflection to access fields that are marked &lt;code&gt;private&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, an inner class can be used to hold the unit tests so they will have visibility of the enclosing class's members and attributes. In the .NET Framework and some other programming languages, partial classes may be used to expose private methods and data for the tests to access.

It is important that such testing hacks do not remain in the production code. In C and other languages, compiler directives such as &lt;code&gt;#if DEBUG ... #endif&lt;/code&gt; can be placed around such additional classes and indeed all other test-related code to prevent them being compiled into the released code. This then means that the released code is not exactly the same as that which is unit tested. The regular running of fewer but more comprehensive, end-to-end, integration tests on the final release build can then ensure (among other things) that no production code exists that subtly relies on aspects of the test harness.

There is some debate among practitioners of TDD, documented in their blogs and other writings, as to whether it is wise to test private and protected methods and data anyway. Some argue that it should be sufficient to test any class through its public interface as the private members are a mere implementation detail that may change, and should be allowed to do so without breaking numbers of tests. Others say that crucial aspects of functionality may be implemented in private methods, and that developing this while testing it indirectly via the public interface only obscures the issue: unit testing is about testing the smallest unit of functionality possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Fakes, mocks and integration tests==
Unit tests are so named because they each test ''one unit'' of code. A complex module may have a thousand unit tests and a simple one only ten. The tests used for TDD should never cross process boundaries in a program, let alone network connections. Doing so introduces delays that make tests run slowly and discourage developers from running the whole suite. Introducing dependencies on external modules or data also turns ''unit tests'' into ''integration tests''. If one module misbehaves in a chain of interrelated modules, it is not so immediately clear where to look for the cause of the failure.

When code under development relies on a database, a web service, or any other external process or service, enforcing a unit-testable separation is also an opportunity and a driving force to design more modular, more testable and more reusable code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Refactoring - Improving the design of existing code |last=Fowler |first=Martin |year=1999 |publisher=Addison Wesley Longman, Inc. |location=Boston |isbn=0-201-48567-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two steps are necessary:

# Whenever external access is going to be needed in the final design, an interface should be defined that describes the access that will be available. See the dependency inversion principle for a discussion of the benefits of doing this regardless of TDD. 
# The interface should be implemented in two ways, one of which really accesses the external process, and the other of which is a fake or mock. Fake objects need do little more than add a message such as “Person object saved” to a trace log, against which a test assertion can be run to verify correct behaviour. Mock objects differ in that they themselves contain test assertions that can make the test fail, for example, if the person's name and other data are not as expected. Fake and mock object methods that return data, ostensibly from a data store or user, can help the test process by always returning the same, realistic data that tests can rely upon. They can also be set into predefined fault modes so that error-handling routines can be developed and reliably tested. Fake services other than data stores may also be useful in TDD: Fake encryption services may not, in fact, encrypt the data passed; fake random number services may always return 1. Fake or mock implementations are examples of dependency injection.

A corollary of such dependency injection is that the actual database or other external-access code is never tested by the TDD process itself. To avoid errors that may arise from this, other tests are needed that instantiate the test-driven code with the “real” implementations of the interfaces discussed above. These tests are quite separate from the TDD unit tests, and are really integration tests. There will be fewer of them, and they need to be run less often than the unit tests. They can nonetheless be implemented using the same testing framework, such as xUnit.

Integration tests that alter any persistent store or database should always be designed carefully with consideration of the initial and final state of the files or database, even if any test fails. This is often achieved using some combination of the following techniques:
* The &lt;code&gt;TearDown&lt;/code&gt; method, which is integral to many test frameworks. 
* &lt;code&gt;try...catch...finally&lt;/code&gt; exception handling structures where available.
* Database transactions where a transaction atomically includes perhaps a write, a read and a matching delete operation.
* Taking a “snapshot” of the database before running any tests and rolling back to the snapshot after each test run. This may be automated using a framework such as Ant or NAnt or a continuous integration system such as CruiseControl.
* Initialising the database to a clean state ''before'' tests, rather than cleaning up ''after'' them. This may be relevant where cleaning up may make it difficult to diagnose test failures by deleting the final state of the database before detailed diagnosis can be performed.

Frameworks such as Moq, jMock, NMock, EasyMock, Typemock, jMockit, Unitils, Mockito, Mockachino, PowerMock or Rhino Mocks exist to make the process of creating and using complex mock objects easier.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Code refactoring''' is &quot;a disciplined way to restructure code&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Scott Ambler&lt;/ref&gt; undertaken  in order to improve some of the ''nonfunctional'' attributes of the software.
Typically, this is done by applying series of &quot;refactorings&quot;, each of which is a (usually) tiny change in a computer program's source code that does not modify its ''functional requirements''. Advantages include improved code readability and reduced complexity to improve the maintainability of the source code, as well as a more expressive internal architecture or object model to improve extensibility.

{{cquote|''By continuously improving the design of code, we make it easier and easier to work with. This is in sharp contrast to what typically happens: little refactoring and a great deal of attention paid to expediently adding new features. If you get into the hygienic habit of refactoring continuously, you'll find that it is easier to extend and maintain code.''|20px|20px|- Joshua Kerievsky, ''Refactoring to Patterns'' &lt;ref name=kerievsky&gt;{{cite book | last = Kerievsky | first = Joshua | title = Refactoring to Patterns | publisher = Addison Wesley | year = 2004  }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Refactoring does not take place in a vacuum, but typically the refactoring process takes place in a context of adding features to software:
* &quot;... refactoring and adding new functionality are two different but complementary tasks&quot; -- Scott Ambler

==Overview==
Refactoring is usually motivated by noticing a code smell.&lt;ref name=fowler&gt;{{cite book | last = Fowler| first = Martin |title = Refactoring: Improving the design of existing code | publisher = Addison Wesley | year = 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example the method at hand may be very long, or it may be a near duplicate of another nearby method. Once recognized, such problems can be addressed by ''refactoring'' the source code, or transforming it into a new form that behaves the same as before but that no longer &quot;smells&quot;.  For a long routine, extract one or more smaller subroutines. Or for duplicate routines, remove the duplication and utilize one shared function in their place. Failure to perform refactoring can result in accumulating technical debt.

There are two general categories of benefits to the activity of refactoring.
# Maintainability. It is easier to fix bugs because the source code is easy to read and the intent of its author is easy to grasp.&lt;ref name=martin&gt;{{cite book | last = Martin | first = Robert |title = Clean Code | publisher = Prentice Hall | year = 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This might be achieved by reducing large monolithic routines into a set of individually concise, well-named, single-purpose methods. It might be achieved by moving a method to a more appropriate class, or by removing misleading comments.
# Extensibility. It is easier to extend the capabilities of the application if it uses recognizable design patterns, and it provides some flexibility where none before may have existed.&lt;ref name=kerievsky/&gt;

Before refactoring a section of code, a solid set of automatic unit tests is needed. The tests should demonstrate in a few seconds {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} that the behavior of the module is correct. The process is then an iterative cycle of making a small program transformation, testing it to ensure correctness, and making another small transformation. If at any point a test fails, you undo your last small change and try again in a different way. Through many small steps the program moves from where it was to where you want it to be. Proponents of extreme programming and other agile methodologies describe this activity as an integral part of the software development cycle.

==List of refactoring techniques==
Here are some examples of code refactorings; some of these may only apply to certain languages or language types. A longer list can be found in Fowler's Refactoring book&lt;ref name=fowler/&gt; and on Fowler's Refactoring Website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.refactoring.com/catalog/index.html Refactoring techniques in Fowler's refactoring Website]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Techniques that allow for more abstraction
** Encapsulate Field – force code to access the field with getter and setter methods
** Generalize Type – create more general types to allow for more code sharing
** Replace type-checking code with State/Strategy&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.refactoring.com/catalog/replaceTypeCodeWithStateStrategy.html Replace type-checking code with State/Strategy]&lt;/ref&gt;
** Replace conditional with polymorphism&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.refactoring.com/catalog/replaceConditionalWithPolymorphism.html Replace conditional with polymorphism]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Techniques for breaking code apart into more logical pieces
** Extract Method, to turn part of a larger method into a new method. By breaking down code in smaller pieces, it is more easily understandable. This is also applicable to functions.
** Extract Class moves part of the code from an existing class into a new class.
* Techniques for improving names and location of code
** Move Method or Move Field – move to a more appropriate Class or source file
** Rename Method or Rename Field – changing the name into a new one that better reveals its purpose
** Pull Up – in OOP, move to a superclass
** Push Down – in OOP, move to a subclass

==Hardware refactoring==
While the term ''refactoring'' originally referred exclusively to refactoring of software code, in recent years code written in hardware description languages (HDLs) has also been refactored. The term ''hardware refactoring'' is used as a shorthand term for refactoring of code in hardware description languages. Since HDLs are not considered to be programming languages by most hardware engineers,&lt;ref&gt;Hardware description languages and programming languages&lt;/ref&gt; hardware refactoring is to be considered a separate field from traditional code refactoring.

Automated refactoring of analog hardware descriptions (in VHDL-AMS) has been proposed by Zeng and Huss.&lt;ref&gt;Kaiping Zeng, Sorin A. Huss, &quot;Architecture refinements by code refactoring of behavioral VHDL-AMS models&quot;. ISCAS 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In their approach, refactoring preserves the simulated behavior of a hardware design. The non-functional measurement that improves is that refactored code can be processed by standard synthesis tools, while the original code cannot.
Refactoring of digital HDLs, albeit manual refactoring, has also been investigated by Synopsys fellow Mike Keating.&lt;ref&gt;M. Keating :&quot;Complexity, Abstraction, and the Challenges of Designing Complex Systems&quot;, in DAC'08 tutorial [http://www.dac.com/events/eventdetails.aspx?id=77-130]&quot;Bridging a Verification Gap: C++ to RTL for Practical Design&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Keating, P. Bricaud: ''Reuse Methodology Manual for System-on-a-Chip Designs'', Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; His target is to make complex systems easier to understand, which increases
the designers' productivity.

In the summer of 2008, there was an intense discussion about refactoring of VHDL code on the news://comp.lang.vhdl newsgroup.&lt;ref&gt;http://newsgroups.derkeiler.com/Archive/Comp/comp.lang.vhdl/2008-06/msg00173.html&lt;/ref&gt; The discussion revolved around a specific manual refactoring performed by one engineer, and the question to whether or not automated tools for such refactoring exist.

As of late 2009, Sigasi is offering automated tool support for VHDL refactoring.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eetimes.com/news/latest/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=222001855 www.eetimes.com/news/latest/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=222001855]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the past refactoring was avoided in development processes. One example of this is that CVS (created in 1984) does not version the moving or renaming of files and directories.

Although refactoring code has been done informally for years, William Opdyke's 1992 Ph.D. dissertation&lt;ref name=&quot;opdyke-thesis&quot; /&gt; is the first known paper to specifically examine refactoring,&lt;ref name=&quot;etymology&quot;&gt;[http://martinfowler.com/bliki/EtymologyOfRefactoring.html Martin Fowler, &quot;MF Bliki: EtymologyOfRefactoring&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; although all the theory and machinery have long been available as program transformation systems.  All of these resources provide a catalog of common methods for refactoring; a refactoring method has a description of how to apply the method and indicators for when you should (or should not) apply the method.

Martin Fowler's book ''Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code''&lt;ref name=&quot;fowler&quot;/&gt;  is the canonical reference.

The first known use of the term &quot;refactoring&quot; in the published literature was in a September, 1990 article by William F. Opdyke and Ralph E. Johnson.&lt;ref name=&quot;opdyke90&quot;&gt;{{cite conference

}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in 1992, also used this term.&lt;ref name=&quot;etymology&quot; /&gt;

The term &quot;factoring&quot; has been used in the Forth community since at least the early 1980s{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}.  Chapter Six of Leo Brodie's book ''Thinking Forth'' (1984) is dedicated to the subject.

In extreme programming, the Extract Method refactoring technique has essentially the same meaning as factoring in Forth; to break down a &quot;word&quot; (or function) into smaller, more easily maintained functions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In the context of software engineering, '''software quality''' measures how well software is designed (''quality of design''), and how well the software conforms to that design (''quality of conformance''),&lt;ref name=&quot;Press746&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Pressman|2005|p=746}}&lt;/ref&gt; although there are several different definitions. It is often described as the 'fitness for purpose' of a piece of software.

Whereas ''quality of conformance'' is concerned with implementation (see Software Quality Assurance), ''quality of design'' measures how valid the design and requirements are in creating a worthwhile product.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pressman|2005|p=388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==

One of the challenges of software quality is that &quot;everyone feels they understand it&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Crosby, P., ''Quality is Free'', McGraw-Hill, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

Software quality may be defined as conformance to explicitly stated functional and performance requirements, explicitly documented development standards and implicit characteristics that are expected of all professionally developed software.

The three key points in this definition:
# Software requirements are the foundations from which quality is measured. &lt;blockquote&gt;Lack of conformance to requirement is lack of quality.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
# Specified standards define a set of development criteria that guide the manager is software engineering. &lt;blockquote&gt;If criteria are not followed lack of quality will usually result.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
# A set of implicit requirements often goes unmentioned, for example ease of use, maintainability etc.&lt;blockquote&gt;If software confirms to its explicit requirement but fails to meet implicit requirements, software quality is suspected.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A definition in Steve McConnell's ''Code Complete'' divides software into two pieces: '''internal''' and '''external quality characteristics'''. External quality characteristics are those parts of a product that face its users, where internal quality characteristics are those that do not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McConnell|1993|p=558}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another definition by Dr. Tom DeMarco says &quot;a product's quality is a function of how much it changes the world for the better.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;DeMarco, T., ''Management Can Make Quality (Im)possible'', Cutter IT Summit, Boston, April 1999&lt;/ref&gt; This can be interpreted as meaning that user satisfaction is more important than anything in determining software quality.&lt;ref name=&quot;Press746&quot;/&gt;

Another definition, coined by Gerald Weinberg in ''Quality Software Management: Systems Thinking'', is &quot;Quality is value to some person.&quot; This definition stresses that quality is inherently subjective - different people will experience the quality of the same software very differently. One strength of this definition is the questions it invites software teams to consider, such as &quot;Who are the people we want to value our software?&quot; and &quot;What will be valuable to ''them''?&quot;

== History ==
=== Software product quality ===
* Correctness
* Product quality
** conformance to requirements or program specification; related to Reliability
* Scalability
* Completeness
* Absence of bugs
* Fault-tolerance
** Extensibility
** Maintainability
* Documentation

The Consortium for IT Software Quality (CISQ) was launched in 2009 to standardize the measurement of software product quality. The Consortium's goal is to bring together industry executives from Global 2000 IT organizations, system integrators, outsourcers, and package vendors to jointly address the challenge of standardizing the measurement of IT software quality and to promote a market-based ecosystem to support its deployment.

=== Source code quality ===
A computer has no concept of &quot;well-written&quot; source code. However, from a human point of view source code can be written in a way that has an effect on the effort needed to comprehend its behavior. Many source code programming style guides, which often stress readability and usually language-specific conventions are aimed at reducing the cost of source code maintenance. Some of the issues that affect code quality include:
* Readability
* Ease of maintenance, testing, debugging, fixing, modification and portability
* Low complexity
* Low resource consumption: memory, CPU
* Number of compilation or lint warnings
* Robust input validation and error handling, established by software fault injection

Methods to improve the quality:
* Refactoring
* Code Inspection or software review
* Documenting code

== Software reliability ==
Software '''reliability''' is an important facet of software quality. It is defined as &quot;the probability of failure-free operation of a computer program in a specified environment for a specified time&quot;.&lt;ref&gt; J.D. Musa, A. Iannino, and K. Okumoto, ''Engineering and Managing Software with Reliability Measures'', McGraw-Hill, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

One of reliability's distinguishing characteristics is that it is objective, measurable, and can be estimated, whereas much of software quality is subjective criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pressman|2005|p=762}}&lt;/ref&gt; This distinction is especially important in the discipline of Software Quality Assurance. These measured criteria are typically called software metrics.

=== History ===
With software embedded into many devices today, software failure has caused more than inconvenience. Software errors have even caused human fatalities. The causes have ranged from poorly designed user interfaces to direct programming errors. An example of a programming error that lead to multiple deaths is discussed in Dr. Leveson's paper [http://sunnyday.mit.edu/papers/therac.pdf] (PDF). This has resulted in requirements for development of some types software. In the United States, both the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) have requirements for software development.

=== Goal of reliability ===
The need for a means to objectively determine software reliability comes from the desire to apply the techniques of contemporary engineering fields to the development of software. That desire is a result of the common observation, by both lay-persons and specialists, that computer software does not work the way it ought to. In other words, software is seen to exhibit undesirable behaviour, up to and including outright failure, with consequences for the data which is processed, the machinery on which the software runs, and by extension the people and materials which those machines might negatively affect. The more critical the application of the software to economic and production processes, or to life-sustaining systems, the more important is the need to assess the software's reliability.

Regardless of the criticality of any single software application, it is also more and more frequently observed that software has penetrated deeply into most every aspect of modern life through the technology we use. It is only expected that this infiltration will continue, along with an accompanying dependency on the software by the systems which maintain our society. As software becomes more and more crucial to the operation of the systems on which we depend, the argument goes, it only follows that the software should offer a concomitant level of dependability. In other words, the software should behave in the way it is intended, or even better, in the way it should.

=== Challenge of reliability ===
The circular logic of the preceding sentence is not accidental—it is meant to illustrate a fundamental problem in the issue of measuring software reliability, which is the difficulty of determining, in advance, exactly how the software is intended to operate. The problem seems to stem from a common conceptual error in the consideration of software, which is that software in some sense takes on a role which would otherwise be filled by a human being. This is a problem on two levels. Firstly, most modern software performs work which a human could never perform, especially at the high level of reliability that is often expected from software in comparison to humans. Secondly, software is fundamentally incapable of most of the mental capabilities of humans which separate them from mere mechanisms: qualities such as adaptability, general-purpose knowledge, a sense of conceptual and functional context, and common sense.

Nevertheless, most software programs could safely be considered to have a particular, even singular purpose. If the possibility can be allowed that said purpose can be well or even completely defined, it should present a means for at least considering objectively whether the software is, in fact, reliable, by comparing the expected outcome to the actual outcome of running the software in a given environment, with given data. Unfortunately, it is still not known whether it is possible to exhaustively determine either the expected outcome or the actual outcome of the entire set of possible environment and input data to a given program, without which it is probably impossible to determine the program's reliability with any certainty.

However, various attempts are in the works to attempt to rein in the vastness of the space of software's environmental and input variables, both for actual programs and theoretical descriptions of programs. Such attempts to improve software reliability can be applied at different stages of a program's development, in the case of real software. These stages principally include: requirements, design, programming, testing, and runtime evaluation. The study of theoretical software reliability is predominantly concerned with the concept of correctness, a mathematical field of computer science which is an outgrowth of language and automata theory.

=== Reliability in program development ===
==== Requirements ====
A program cannot be expected to work as desired if the developers of the program do not, in fact, know the program's desired behaviour in advance, or if they cannot at least determine its desired behaviour in parallel with development, in sufficient detail. What level of detail is considered sufficient is hotly debated. The idea of perfect detail is attractive, but may be impractical, if not actually impossible. This is because the desired behaviour tends to change as the possible range of the behaviour is determined through actual attempts, or more accurately, failed attempts, to achieve it.

Whether a program's desired behaviour can be successfully specified in advance is a moot point if the behaviour cannot be specified at all, and this is the focus of attempts to formalize the process of creating requirements for new software projects. In situ with the formalization effort is an attempt to help inform non-specialists, particularly non-programmers, who commission software projects without sufficient knowledge of what computer software is in fact capable. Communicating this knowledge is made more difficult by the fact that, as hinted above, even programmers cannot always know in advance what is actually possible for software in advance of trying.

==== Design ====
While requirements are meant to specify what a program should do, design is meant, at least at a high level, to specify how the program should do it. The usefulness of design is also questioned by some, but those who look to formalize the process of ensuring reliability often offer good software design processes as the most significant means to accomplish it. Software design usually involves the use of more abstract and general means of specifying the parts of the software and what they do. As such, it can be seen as a way to break a large program down into many smaller programs, such that those smaller pieces together do the work of the whole program.

The purposes of high-level design are as follows. It separates what are considered to be problems of architecture, or overall program concept and structure, from problems of actual coding, which solve problems of actual data processing. It applies additional constraints to the development process by narrowing the scope of the smaller software components, and thereby—it is hoped—removing variables which could increase the likelihood of programming errors. It provides a program template, including the specification of interfaces, which can be shared by different teams of developers working on disparate parts, such that they can know in advance how each of their contributions will interface with those of the other teams. Finally, and perhaps most controversially, it specifies the program independently of the implementation language or languages, thereby removing language-specific biases and limitations which would otherwise creep into the design, perhaps unwittingly on the part of programmer-designers.

==== Programming ====
The history of computer programming language development can often be best understood in the light of attempts to master the complexity of computer programs, which otherwise becomes more difficult to understand in proportion (perhaps exponentially) to the size of the programs. (Another way of looking at the evolution of programming languages is simply as a way of getting the computer to do more and more of the work, but this may be a different way of saying the same thing). Lack of understanding of a program's overall structure and functionality is a sure way to fail to detect errors in the program, and thus the use of better languages should, conversely, reduce the number of errors by enabling a better understanding.

Improvements in languages tend to provide incrementally what software design has attempted to do in one fell swoop: consider the software at ever greater levels of abstraction. Such inventions as statement, sub-routine, file, class, template, library, component and more have allowed the arrangement of a program's parts to be specified using abstractions such as layers, hierarchies and modules, which provide structure at different granularities, so that from any point of view the program's code can be imagined to be orderly and comprehensible.

In addition, improvements in languages have enabled more exact control over the shape and use of data elements, culminating in the abstract data type. These data types can be specified to a very fine degree, including how and when they are accessed, and even the state of the data before and after it is accessed..

==== Software Build and Deployment ====
Many programming languages such as C and Java require the program &quot;source code&quot; to be translated in to a form that can be executed by a computer. This translation is done by a program called a compiler. Additional operations may be involved to associate, bind, link or package files together in order to create a usable runtime configuration of the software application. The totality of the compiling and assembly process is generically called &quot;building&quot; the software.

The software build is critical to software quality because if any of the generated files are incorrect the software build is likely to fail. And, if the incorrect version of a program is inadvertently used, then testing can lead to false results.

Software builds are typically done in work area unrelated to the runtime area, such as the application server. For this reason, a deployment step is needed to physically transfer the software build products to the runtime area. The deployment procedure may also involve technical parameters, which, if set incorrectly, can also prevent software testing from beginning. For example, a Java application server may have options for parent-first or parent-last class loading. Using the incorrect parameter can cause the application to fail to execute on the application server.

The technical activities supporting software quality including build, deployment, change control and reporting are collectively known as Software configuration management. A number of software tools have arisen to help meet the challenges of configuration management including file control tools and build control tools.

==== Testing ====
'''Software testing''', when done correctly, can increase overall software ''quality of conformance'' by testing that the product conforms to its requirements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://istqbexamcertification.com/what-is-a-software-testing/ ISTQB] - What is software testing?&lt;/ref&gt; Testing includes, but is not limited to:

# Unit Testing
# Functional Testing
# Regression Testing
# Performance Testing
# Failover Testing
# Usability Testing

A number of agile methodologies use testing early in the development cycle to ensure quality in their products. For example, the test-driven development practice, where tests are written before the code they will test, is used in Extreme Programming to ensure quality.

==== Runtime ====
runtime reliability determinations are similar to tests, but go beyond simple confirmation of behaviour to the evaluation of qualities such as performance and interoperability with other code or particular hardware configurations.

== Software quality factors ==
A software quality factor is a non-functional requirement for a software program which is not called up by the customer's contract, but nevertheless is a desirable requirement which enhances the quality of the software program. Note that none of these factors are binary; that is, they are not “either you have it or you don’t” traits. Rather, they are characteristics that one seeks to maximize in one’s software to optimize its quality. So rather than asking whether a software product “has” factor ''x'', ask instead the ''degree'' to which it does (or does not).

Some software quality factors are listed here:

;Understandability: Clarity of purpose. This goes further than just a statement of purpose; all of the design and user documentation must be clearly written so that it is easily understandable. This is obviously subjective in that the user context must be taken into account: for instance, if the software product is to be used by software engineers it is not required to be understandable to the layman.

;Completeness: Presence of all constituent parts, with each part fully developed. This means that if the code calls a subroutine from an external library, the software package must provide reference to that library and all required parameters must be passed. All required input data must also be available.

;Conciseness: Minimization of excessive or redundant information or processing. This is important where memory capacity is limited, and it is generally considered good practice to keep lines of code to a minimum. It can be improved by replacing repeated functionality by one subroutine or function which achieves that functionality. It also applies to documents.

;Portability: Ability to be run well and easily on multiple computer configurations. Portability can mean both between different hardware—such as running on a PC as well as a smartphone—and between different operating systems—such as running on both Mac OS X and GNU/Linux.

;Consistency: Uniformity in notation, symbology, appearance, and terminology within itself.

;Maintainability: Propensity to facilitate updates to satisfy new requirements. Thus the software product that is maintainable should be well-documented, should not be complex, and should have spare capacity for memory, storage and processor utilization and other resources.

;Testability: Disposition to support acceptance criteria and evaluation of performance. Such a characteristic must be built-in during the design phase if the product is to be easily testable; a complex design leads to poor testability.

;Usability: Convenience and practicality of use. This is affected by such things as the human-computer interface. The component of the software that has most impact on this is the user interface (UI), which for best usability is usually graphical (i.e. a GUI).

;Reliability: Ability to be expected to perform its intended functions satisfactorily. This implies a time factor in that a reliable product is expected to perform correctly over a period of time. It also encompasses environmental considerations in that the product is required to perform correctly in whatever conditions it finds itself (sometimes termed robustness).

;Efficiency: Fulfillment of purpose without waste of resources, such as memory, space and processor utilization, network bandwidth, time, etc.

;Security: Ability to protect data against unauthorized access and to withstand malicious or inadvertent interference with its operations. Besides the presence of appropriate security mechanisms such as authentication, access control and encryption, security also implies resilience in the face of malicious, intelligent and adaptive attackers.

=== Measurement of software quality factors ===
There are varied perspectives within the field on measurement. There are a great many measures that are valued by some professionals—or in some contexts, that are decried as harmful by others. Some believe that quantitative measures of software quality are essential. Others believe that contexts where quantitative measures are useful are quite rare, and so prefer qualitative measures. Several leaders in the field of software testing have written about the difficulty of measuring what we truly want to measure well.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaner&quot;&gt;Cem Kaner http://www.kaner.com/pdfs/metrics2004.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Douglass Hoffman
http://www.softwarequalitymethods.com/Papers/DarkMets%20Paper.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

One example of a popular metric is the number of faults encountered in the software. Software that contains few faults is considered by some to have higher quality than software that contains many faults. Questions that can help determine the usefulness of this metric in a particular context include:
# What constitutes “many faults?” Does this differ depending upon the purpose of the software (e.g., blogging software vs. navigational software)? Does this take into account the size and complexity of the software?
# Does this account for the importance of the bugs (and the importance to the stakeholders of the people those bugs bug)? Does one try to weight this metric by the severity of the fault, or the incidence of users it affects? If so, how? And if not, how does one know that 100 faults discovered is better than 1000?
# If the count of faults being discovered is shrinking, how do I know what that means? For example, does that mean that the product is now higher quality than it was before? Or that this is a smaller/less ambitious change than before? Or that fewer tester-hours have gone into the project than before? Or that this project was tested by less skilled testers than before? Or that the team has discovered that fewer faults reported is in their interest?

This last question points to an especially difficult one to manage. All software quality metrics are in some sense measures of human behavior, since humans create software.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaner&quot;/&gt; If a team discovers that they will benefit from a drop in the number of reported bugs, there is a strong tendency for the team to start reporting fewer defects. That may mean that email begins to circumvent the bug tracking system, or that four or five bugs get lumped into one bug report, or that testers learn not to report minor annoyances. The difficulty is measuring what we mean to measure, without creating incentives for software programmers and testers to consciously or unconsciously “game” the measurements.

Software quality factors cannot be measured because of their vague definitions. It is necessary to find measurements, or metrics, which can be used to quantify them as non-functional requirements. For example, reliability is a software quality factor, but cannot be evaluated in its own right. However, there are related attributes to reliability, which can indeed be measured. Some such attributes are mean time to failure, rate of failure occurrence, and availability of the system. Similarly, an attribute of portability is the number of target-dependent statements in a program.

A scheme that could be used for evaluating software quality factors is given below. For every characteristic, there are a set of questions which are relevant to that characteristic. Some type of scoring formula could be developed based on the answers to these questions, from which a measurement of the characteristic can be obtained.

==== Understandability ====
Are variable names descriptive of the physical or functional property represented? Do uniquely recognisable functions contain adequate comments so that their purpose is clear? Are deviations from forward logical flow adequately commented? Are all elements of an array functionally related?....

==== Completeness ====
Are all necessary components available? Does any process fail for lack of resources or programming? Are all potential pathways through the code accounted for, including proper error handling?

==== Conciseness ====
Is all code reachable? Is any code redundant? How many statements within loops could be placed outside the loop, thus reducing computation time? Are branch decisions too complex?

==== Portability ====
Does the program depend upon system or library routines unique to a particular installation? Have machine-dependent statements been flagged and commented? Has dependency on internal bit representation of alphanumeric or special characters been avoided? How much effort would be required to transfer the program from one hardware/software system or environment to another?

==== Consistency ====
Is one variable name used to represent different logical or physical entities in the program? Does the program contain only one representation for any given physical or mathematical constant? Are functionally similar arithmetic expressions similarly constructed? Is a consistent scheme used for indentation, nomenclature, the color palette, fonts and other visual elements?

==== Maintainability ====
Has some memory capacity been reserved for future expansion? Is the design cohesive—i.e., does each module have distinct, recognizable functionality? Does the software allow for a change in data structures (object-oriented designs are more likely to allow for this)? If the code is procedure-based (rather than object-oriented), is a change likely to require restructuring the main program, or just a module?

==== Testability ====
Are complex structures employed in the code? Does the detailed design contain clear pseudo-code? Is the pseudo-code at a higher level of abstraction than the code? If tasking is used in concurrent designs, are schemes available for providing adequate test cases?

==== Usability ====
Is a GUI used? Is there adequate on-line help? Is a user manual provided? Are meaningful error messages provided?

==== Reliability ====
Are loop indexes range-tested? Is input data checked for range errors? Is divide-by-zero avoided? Is exception handling provided?
It is the probability that the software performs its intended functions correctly in a specified period of time under stated operation conditions,
but there could also be a problem with the requirement document...

==== Efficiency ====
Have functions been optimized for speed? Have repeatedly used blocks of code been formed into subroutines? Has the program been checked for memory leaks or overflow errors?

==== Security ====
Does the software protect itself and its data against unauthorized access and use? Does it allow its operator to enforce security policies? Are security mechanisms appropriate, adequate and correctly implemented? Can the software withstand attacks that can be anticipated in its intended environment?

== User's perspective ==
In addition to the technical qualities of software, the end user's experience also determines the quality of software. This aspect of software quality is called usability. It is hard to quantify the usability of a given software product.
Some important questions to be asked are:
* Is the user interface intuitive (self-explanatory/self-documenting)?
* Is it easy to perform simple operations?
* Is it feasible to perform complex operations?
* Does the software give sensible error messages?
* Do widgets behave as expected?
* Is the software well documented?
* Is the user interface responsive or too slow?

Also, the availability of (free or paid) support may factor into the usability of the software.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Static program analysis''' is the analysis of computer software that is performed without actually executing programs built from that software (analysis performed on executing programs is known as dynamic analysis).  In most cases the analysis is performed on some version of the source code and in the other cases some form of the object code.  The term is usually applied to the analysis performed by an automated tool, with human analysis being called program understanding, program comprehension or code review.

The sophistication of the analysis performed by tools varies from those that only consider the behavior of individual statements and declarations, to those that include the complete source code of a program in their analysis.  Uses of the information obtained from the analysis vary from highlighting possible coding errors (e.g., the lint tool) to formal methods that mathematically prove properties about a given program (e.g., its behavior matches that of its specification).

It can be argued that software metrics and reverse engineering are forms of static analysis.

A growing commercial use of static analysis is in the verification of properties of software used in safety-critical computer systems and
locating potentially vulnerable code. For example, medical software is increasing in sophistication and complexity, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has identified the use of static code analysis as a means of improving the quality of software&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Infusion Pump Software Safety Research at FDA | last=FDA| first= | publisher = Food and Drug Administration| date=2010-09-08 | url=http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/GeneralHospitalDevicesandSupplies/InfusionPumps/ucm202511.htm | accessdate=2010-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Formal methods==
Formal methods is the term applied to the analysis of software (and hardware) whose results are obtained purely through the use of rigorous mathematical methods.  The mathematical techniques used include denotational semantics, axiomatic semantics, operational semantics, and abstract interpretation.

It has been proven that, barring some hypothesis that the state space of programs is finite, finding all possible run-time errors, or more generally any kind of violation of a specification on the final result of a program, is undecidable: there is no mechanical method that can always answer truthfully whether a given program may or may not exhibit runtime errors. This result dates from the works of Church, Kurt Gödel and Turing in the 1930s (see the halting problem and Rice's theorem). As with most{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} undecidable questions, one can still attempt to give useful approximate solutions.

Some of the implementation techniques of formal static analysis include:
*Model checking considers systems that have finite state or may be reduced to finite state by abstraction;
*Data-flow analysis is a lattice-based technique for gathering information about the possible set of values;
*Abstract interpretation models the effect that every statement has on the state of an abstract machine (i.e., it 'executes' the software based on the mathematical properties of each statement and declaration). This abstract machine over-approximates the behaviours of the system: the abstract system is thus made simpler to analyze, at the expense of ''incompleteness'' (not every property true of the original system is true of the abstract system). If properly done, though, abstract interpretation is ''sound'' (every property true of the abstract system can be mapped to a true property of the original system)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Formal Methods-based verification approach to medical device software analysis | last=Jones| first=Paul| publisher= Embedded Systems Design | date=2010-02-09 | url=http://embeddeddsp.embedded.com/design/opensource/222700533 | accessdate=2010-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The Frama-c framework and Polyspace heavily rely on abstract interpretation.
*Use of assertions in program code as first suggested by Hoare logic. There is tool support for some programming languages (e.g., the SPARK programming language (a subset of Ada) and the Java Modeling Language — JML — using ESC/Java and ESC/Java2, ANSI/ISO C Specification Language for the C language).

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''software metric''' is a measure of some property of a piece of software or its specifications. Since quantitative measurements are essential in all sciences, there is a continuous effort by computer science practitioners and theoreticians to bring similar approaches to software development. The goal is obtaining objective, reproducible and quantifiable measurements, which may have numerous valuable applications in schedule and budget planning, cost estimation, quality assurance testing, software debugging, software performance optimization, and optimal personnel task assignments.

== Common software measurements ==
Common software measurements include:
* Balanced scorecard
* Bugs per line of code
* COCOMO
* Code coverage
* Cohesion
* Comment density&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Descriptive Information (DI)  Metric Thresholds|url=http://www.lsec.dnd.ca/qsd_current_version/eng_support/di/metrics.htm|work=Land Software Engineering Centre|accessdate=19 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Connascent software components
* Coupling
* Cyclomatic complexity
* Function point analysis
* Halstead Complexity
* Instruction path length
* Number of classes and interfaces
* Number of lines of code
* Number of lines of customer requirements
* Program execution time
* Program load time
* Binary file|Program size (binary)
* Robert Cecil Martin’s software package metrics
* Weighted Micro Function Points

== Limitations ==
As software development is a complex process, with high variance on both methodologies and objectives, it is difficult to define or measure software qualities and quantities and to determine a valid and concurrent measurement metric, especially when making such a prediction prior to the detail design. Another source of difficulty and debate is in determining which metrics matter, and what they mean.&lt;ref name=&quot;integration_watch&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;when_why_how&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Kolawa|first=Adam|title=When, Why, and How: Code Analysis|url=http://www.codeproject.com/KB/interviews/Code_Review.aspx|work=The Code Project|accessdate=19 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The practical utility of ''software'' measurements has thus been limited to narrow domains where they include:
* Schedule
* Size/Complexity
* Cost
* Quality

Common goal of measurement may target one or more of the above aspects, or the balance between them as indicator of team’s motivation or project performance.

== Acceptance and Public Opinion ==
Some software development practitioners point out that simplistic measurements can cause more harm than good.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Kaner|first=Dr. Cem|title=Software Engineer Metrics: What do they measure and how do we know?|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1.2542&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have noted that metrics have become an integral part of the software development process.&lt;ref name=&quot;integration_watch&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Binstock|first=Andrew|title=Integration Watch: Using metrics effectively|url=http://www.sdtimes.com/link/34157|work=SD Times|publisher=BZ Media |accessdate=19 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Impact of measurement on programmers psychology have raised concerns for harmful effects to performance due to stress, performance anxiety, and attempts to cheat the metrics, while others find it to have positive impact on developers value towards their own work, and prevent them being undervalued.&lt;ref&gt;ProjectCodeMeter (2010) &quot;ProjectCodeMeter Users Manual&quot; page 65 [http://www.projectcodemeter.com/cost_estimation/images/files/PCMProManual.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;
Some argue that the definition of many measurement methodologies are imprecise, and consequently it is often unclear how tools for computing them arrive at a particular result,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=Rüdiger|last1=Lincke|first2=Jonas|last2=Lundberg|first3=Welf|last3=Löwe|title=Comparing software metrics tools|year=2008|work=International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis 2008|pages=131–142|url=http://www.arisa.se/files/LLL-08.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others argue that imperfect quantification is better than none (“You can’t control what you can't measure.”)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = DeMarco | first = Tom | authorlink = Tom DeMarco | year = | title = Controlling Software Projects: Management, Measurement and Estimation | edition = | pages = | publisher = | isbn = 0-13-171711-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
Evidence shows that software metrics are being widely used by government agencies, the US military, NASA&lt;ref&gt;NASA Metrics Planning and Reporting Working Group (MPARWG) [https://esdswg.eosdis.nasa.gov/wg/mpar/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt;, IT consultants, academic institutions&lt;ref&gt;USC Center for Systems and Software Engineering [http://sunset.usc.edu/csse/research/COCOMOII/cocomo_main.html]&lt;/ref&gt;,  and commercial and academic development estimation software.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This article describes various '''software package metrics'''. They have been mentioned by Robert Cecil Martin in his ''Agile Software Development: Principles, Patterns, and Practices'' book (2002).

The term ''software package'', as it is used here, refers to a group of related classes (in the field of object-oriented programming).

*  '''Number of Classes and Interfaces:''' The number of concrete and abstract classes (and interfaces) in the package is an indicator of the extensibility of the package.
* '''Afferent Couplings (Ca):''' The number of other packages that depend upon classes within the package is an indicator of the package's responsibility.
* '''Efferent Couplings (Ce):''' The number of other packages that the classes in the package depend upon is an indicator of the package's independence.
* '''Abstractness (A):''' The ratio of the number of abstract classes (and interfaces) in the analyzed package to the total number of classes in the analyzed package.  The range for this metric is 0 to 1, with A=0 indicating a completely concrete package and A=1 indicating a completely abstract package.
* '''Instability (I):''' The ratio of efferent coupling (Ce) to total coupling (Ce + Ca) such that I = Ce / (Ce + Ca). This metric is an indicator of the package's resilience to change.  The range for this metric is 0 to 1, with I=0 indicating a completely stable package and I=1 indicating a completely instable package.
* '''Distance from the Main Sequence (D):''' The perpendicular distance of a package from the idealized line A + I = 1. This metric is an indicator of the package's balance between abstractness and stability.  A package squarely on the main sequence is optimally balanced with respect to its abstractness and stability. Ideal packages are either completely abstract and stable (x=0, y=1) or completely concrete and instable (x=1, y=0).  The range for this metric is 0 to 1, with D=0 indicating a package that is coincident with the main sequence and D=1 indicating a package that is as far from the main sequence as possible.
* '''Package Dependency Cycles:''' Package dependency cycles are reported along with the hierarchical paths of packages participating in package dependency cycles.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Software visualization'''&lt;ref&gt;(Diehl, 2002; Diehl, 2007; Knight, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; is the static or animated 2-D or 3-D&lt;ref&gt;(Marcus et al., 2003; Wettel et al., 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; visual representation of information about software systems based on their structure,&lt;ref&gt;(Staples &amp; Bieman, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; size,&lt;ref&gt;(Lanza, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; history,&lt;ref&gt;(Girba et al., 2005, Lopez et al., 2004; Van Rysselberghe et al., 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; or behavior.&lt;ref&gt;(Kuhn et al., 2006, Stasko et al., 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, the information used for visualization is software metric data from measurement activities or from reverse engineering. Visualization is inherently not a method for software quality assurance but can be used to manually discover anomalies similar to the process of visual data mining.&lt;ref&gt;(Keim, 2002; Soukup, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

The objectives of software visualizations are to support the understanding of software systems (i.e., its structure) and algorithms (e.g., by animating the behavior of sorting algorithms) as well as the analysis of software systems and their anomalies (e.g., by showing classes with high coupling).

== Types ==


=== Single component ===
Tool for software visualization might be used to visualize source code and quality defects during software development and maintenance activities. Their target is the automatic discovery and visualization of quality defects in object-oriented software systems and services. Designed as a plugin for an IDE (e.g., Visual Studio, Eclipse) they visualized the direct relationship of a class and its methods with other classes in the software system and mark potential quality defects to warn the developer. A further benefit is the support for visual navigation through the software system.

=== Whole (sub-)systems ===
Other more powerful tools are used to visualize a whole system or subsystem to explore the architecture or to apply visual data mining or visual analytics techniques for defect discovery.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Code review''' is systematic examination (often as peer review) of computer source code. It is intended to find and fix mistakes overlooked in the initial development phase, improving both the overall quality of software and the developers' skills. Reviews are done in various forms such as pair programming, informal walkthroughs, and formal inspections.&lt;ref name=&quot;best_practices&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Kolawa | first = Adam | coauthors = Huizinga, Dorota | title = Automated Defect Prevention: Best Practices in Software Management | url = http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470042125.html | year = 2007 | publisher = Wiley-IEEE Computer Society Press | location =| page=260 | pages =426 | isbn = 0470042125 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Introduction ==
Code reviews can often find and remove common vulnerabilities such as format string exploits, race conditions, memory leaks and buffer overflows, thereby improving software security. Online software repositories based on Subversion (with Redmine or Trac), Mercurial, Git or others allow groups of individuals to collaboratively review code. Additionally, specific tools for collaborative code review can facilitate the code review process.

Automated code reviewing software lessens the task of reviewing large chunks of code on the developer by systematically checking source code for known vulnerabilities. 

Capers Jones' ongoing analysis of over 12,000 software development projects showed that the latent defect discovery rate of formal inspection is in the 60-65% range. For informal inspection, the figure is less than 50%. {{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} The latent defect discovery rate for most forms of testing is about 30%. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Embedded Software: Facts, Figures, and Future | first1=Capers | last1=Jones | first2=Ebert | last2= Christof | publisher= IEEE Computer Society | date=April 2009 | url=http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/MC.2009.118 | accessdate=2010-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical code review rates are about 150 lines of code per hour.  Inspecting and reviewing more than a few hundred lines of code per hour for critical software (such as safety critical embedded software) may be too fast to find errors. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Guide to Code Inspections | first=Jack | last=Ganssle | publisher= The Ganssle Group | date=February 2010 | url=http://www.ganssle.com/inspections.pdf | accessdate=2010-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Industry data indicate that code review can accomplish at most an 85% defect removal rate with an average rate of about 65%.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Measuring Defect Potentials and Defect Removal Efficiency | first=Capers | last=Jones | publisher= Crosstalk, The Journal of Defense Software Engineering | date=June 2008 | url=http://www.stsc.hill.af.mil/crosstalk/2008/06/0806jones.html | accessdate=2010-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
Code review practices fall into three main categories: pair programming, formal code review and lightweight code review.&lt;ref name=&quot;best_practices&quot;/&gt;

Formal code review, such as a Fagan inspection, involves a careful and detailed process with multiple participants and multiple phases. Formal code reviews are the traditional method of review, in which software developers attend a series of meetings and review code line by line, usually using printed copies of the material. Formal inspections are extremely thorough and have been proven effective at finding defects in the code under review.

Lightweight code review typically requires less overhead than formal code inspections, though it can be equally effective when done properly.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Lightweight reviews are often conducted as part of the normal development process:

* Over-the-shoulder – One developer looks over the author's shoulder as the latter walks through the code.
* Email pass-around – Source code management system emails code to reviewers automatically after checkin is made.
* Pair Programming – Two authors develop code together at the same workstation, such is common in Extreme Programming.
* Tool-assisted code review – Authors and reviewers use specialized tools designed for peer code review. 

Some of these may also be labeled a &quot;Walkthrough&quot; (informal) or &quot;Critique&quot; (fast and informal).

Many teams that eschew traditional, formal code review use one of the above forms of lightweight review as part of their normal development process. A code review case study published in the book ''Best Kept Secrets of Peer Code Review'' found that lightweight reviews uncovered as many bugs as formal reviews, but were faster and more cost-effective.

== Criticism ==
Historically, formal code reviews have required a considerable investment in preparation for the review event and execution time.

Some believe that skillful, disciplined use of a number of other development practices can result in similarly high latent defect discovery/avoidance rates. Further, XP proponents might argue, layering additional XP practices, such as refactoring and test-driven development will result in latent defect levels rivaling those achievable with more traditional approaches, without the investment.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Use of code analysis tools can support this activity.  Especially tools that work in the IDE as they provide direct feedback to developers of coding standard compliance.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Inspection''' in software engineering, refers to peer review of any work product by trained individuals who look for defects using a well defined process. An inspection might also be referred to as a Fagan inspection after Michael Fagan, the creator of a very popular software inspection process.

== Introduction ==

An inspection is one of the most common sorts of review practices found in software projects. The goal of the inspection is for all of the inspectors to reach consensus on a work product and approve it for use in the project. Commonly inspected work products include software requirements specifications and test plans. In an inspection, a work product is selected for review and a team is gathered for an inspection meeting to review the work product. A moderator is chosen to moderate the meeting. Each inspector prepares for the meeting by reading the work product and noting each defect. '''The goal of the inspection is to identify defects'''. In an inspection, a defect is any part of the work product that will keep an inspector from approving it. For example, if the team is inspecting a software requirements specification, each defect will be text in the document which an inspector disagrees with.

== The process ==

The inspection process was developed by Michael Fagan in the mid-1970s and it has later been extended and modified.

The process should have entry criteria that determine if the inspection process is ready to begin. This prevents unfinished work products from entering the inspection process. The entry criteria might be a checklist including items such as &quot;The document has been spell-checked&quot;.

The stages in the inspections process are: Planning, Overview meeting, Preparation, Inspection meeting, Rework and Follow-up. The Preparation, Inspection meeting and Rework stages might be iterated.

* '''Planning:''' The inspection is planned by the moderator.
* '''Overview meeting:''' The author describes the background of the work product.
* '''Preparation:''' Each inspector examines the work product to identify possible defects.
* '''Inspection meeting:''' During this meeting the reader reads through the work product, part by part and the inspectors point out the defects for every part.
* '''Rework:''' The author makes changes to the work product according to the action plans from the inspection meeting.
* '''Follow-up:''' The changes by the author are checked to make sure everything is correct.

The process is ended by the moderator when it satisfies some predefined exit criteria.

== Inspection roles ==

During an inspection the following roles are used.

* '''Author:''' The person who created the work product being inspected.
* '''Moderator:''' This is the leader of the inspection. The moderator plans the inspection and coordinates it.
* '''Reader:''' The person reading through the documents, one item at a time. The other inspectors then point out defects.
* '''Recorder/Scribe:''' The person that documents the defects that are found during the inspection.
* '''Inspector:''' The person that examines the work product to identify possible defects.

== Related inspection types ==
=== Code review ===

A code review can be done as a special kind of inspection in which the team examines a sample of code and fixes any defects in it. In a code review, a defect is a block of code which does not properly implement its requirements, which does not function as the programmer intended, or which is not incorrect but could be improved (for example, it could be made more readable or its performance could be improved). In addition to helping teams find and fix bugs, code reviews are useful for both cross-training programmers on the code being reviewed and for helping junior developers learn new programming techniques.

=== Peer Reviews ===

Peer Reviews are considered an industry best-practice for detecting software defects early and learning about software artifacts. Peer Reviews are composed of software walkthroughs and software inspections and are integral to software product engineering activities. A collection of coordinated knowledge, skills, and behaviors facilitates the best possible practice of Peer Reviews. The elements of Peer Reviews include the structured review process, standard of excellence product checklists, defined roles of participants, and the forms and reports. 

Software inspections are the most rigorous form of Peer Reviews and fully utilize these elements in detecting defects. Software walkthroughs draw selectively upon the elements in assisting the producer to obtain the deepest understanding of an artifact and reaching a consensus among participants. Measured results reveal that Peer Reviews produce an attractive return on investment obtained through accelerated learning and early defect detection. For best results, Peer Reviews are rolled out within an organization through a defined program of preparing a policy and procedure, training practitioners and managers, defining measurements and populating a database structure, and sustaining the roll out infrastructure.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Software deployment''' is all of the activities that make a software system available for use.

The general deployment process consists of several interrelated activities with possible transitions between them. These activities can occur at the producer site or at the consumer site or both. Because every software system is unique, the precise processes or procedures within each activity can hardly be defined. Therefore, &quot;deployment&quot; should be interpreted as a ''general process'' that has to be customized according to specific requirements or characteristics.  A brief description of each activity will be presented later.

== Deployment activities ==
; Release
: The release activity follows from the completed development process. It includes all the operations to prepare a system for assembly and transfer to the customer site. Therefore, it must determine the resources required to operate at the customer site and collect information for carrying out subsequent activities of deployment process.
; Install and activate
: Activation is the activity of starting up the executable component of software. For simple system, it involves establishing some form of command for execution. For complex systems, it should make all the supporting systems ready to use.
: In larger software deployments, the working copy of the software might be installed on a production server in a production environment.  Other versions of the deployed software may be installed in a test environment, development environment and disaster recovery environment.
; Deactivate
: Deactivation is the inverse of activation, and refers to shutting down any executing components of a system. Deactivation is often required to perform other deployment activities, e.g., a software system may need to be deactivated before an update can be performed.  The practice of removing infrequently used or obsolete systems from service is often referred to as application retirement or application decommissioning.
; Adapt
: The adaptation activity is also a process to modify a software system that has been previously installed. It differs from updating in that adaptations are initiated by local events such as changing the environment of customer site, while updating is mostly started from remote software producer.
; Update
: The update process replaces an earlier version of all or part of a software system with a newer release. 
; Built-In
: Mechanisms for installing updates are built into some software systems. Automation of these update processes ranges from fully automatic to user initiated and controlled. Norton Internet Security is an example of a system with a semi-automatic method for retrieving and installing updates to both the antivirus definitions and other components of the system. Other software products provide query mechanisms for determining when updates are available.
; Version tracking
: Version tracking systems help the user find and install updates to software systems installed on PCs and local networks. 
:* Web based version tracking systems notify the user when updates are available for software systems installed on a local system. For example: VersionTracker Pro checks software versions on a user's computer and then queries its database to see if any updates are available.
:* Local version tracking system notifies the user when updates are available for software systems installed on a local system. For example: Software Catalog stores version and other information for each software package installed on a local system. One click of a button launches a browser window to the upgrade web page for the application, including auto-filling of the user name and password for sites that require a login.
:* Browser based version tracking systems notify the user when updates are available for software packages installed on a local system. For example: wfx-Versions is a Firefox extension which helps the user find the current version number of any program listed on the web.
; Uninstall
: Uninstallation is the inverse of installation. It is the removal of a system that is no longer required. It also involves some reconfiguration of other software systems in order to remove the uninstalled system’s files and dependencies.
; Retire
: Ultimately, a software system is marked as obsolete and support by the producers is withdrawn. It is the end of the life cycle of a software product.

== Deployment roles ==
The complexity and variability of software products has necessitated the creation of specialized roles for coordinating and engineering the deployment process.  For desktop systems, an end user is frequently also the &quot;software deployer&quot; when they install the software package on their machine. For enterprise software, there are many more roles involved.  Additionally, the roles involved typically change as the application progresses from test (pre-production) to production environments.  The typical roles involved in software deployments for enterprise applications are:

* Pre-production environments
** Application developers: see Software development process
** Build and release engineers: see Release engineering
** Release managers: see Release management
** Deployment coordinators: see DevOps
* Production environments
** System administrator
** Database administrator
** Release coordinators: see DevOps
** Operations project managers: see Information Technology Infrastructure Library

* FAI OpenSource Software Linux
* M23 OpenSource Software Linux
* Open PC Server Integration (opsi) OpenSource Software Windows
* RPM with YUM OpenSource Software Linux
* MS SCCM Microsoft Windows

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Software maintenance''' in software engineering is the modification of a software product after delivery to correct faults, to improve performance or other attributes.&lt;ref name=&quot;iso14764&quot;&gt;[http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=39064 ISO/IEC 14764:2006 Software Engineering — Software Life Cycle Processes — Maintenance]&lt;/ref&gt;

A common perception of maintenance is that it is merely fixing bugs. However, studies and surveys over the years have indicated that the majority, over 80%, of the maintenance effort is used for non-corrective actions (Pigosky 1997). This perception is perpetuated by users submitting problem reports that in reality are functionality enhancements to the system.

Software maintenance and evolution of systems was first addressed by Meir M. Lehman in 1969. Over a period of twenty years, his research led to the formulation of eight Laws of Evolution (Lehman 1997). Key findings of his research include that maintenance is really evolutionary developments and that maintenance decisions are aided by understanding what happens to systems (and software) over time. Lehman demonstrated that systems continue to evolve over time. As they evolve, they grow more complex unless some action such as code refactoring is taken to reduce the complexity.

The key software maintenance issues are both managerial and technical. Key management issues are: alignment with customer priorities, staffing, which organization does maintenance, estimating costs. Key technical issues are: limited understanding, impact analysis, testing, maintainability measurement.

== Software maintenance processes ==
This section describes the six software maintenance processes as:
# The implementation processes contains software preparation and transition activities, such as the conception and creation of the maintenance plan, the preparation for handling problems identified during development, and the follow-up on product configuration management.
# The problem and modification analysis process, which is executed once the application has become the responsibility of the maintenance group. The maintenance programmer must analyze each request, confirm it (by reproducing the situation) and check its validity, investigate it and propose a solution, document the request and the solution proposal, and, finally, obtain all the required authorizations to apply the modifications.
# The process considering the implementation of the modification itself.
# The process acceptance of the modification, by confirming the modified work with the individual who submitted the request in order to make sure the modification provided a solution.
# The migration process (platform migration, for example) is exceptional, and is not part of daily maintenance tasks. If the software must be ported to another platform without any change in functionality, this process will be used and a maintenance project team is likely to be assigned to this task.
# Finally, the last maintenance process, also an event which does not occur on a daily basis, is the retirement of a piece of software.

There are a number of processes, activities and practices that are unique to maintainers, for example:
* Transition: a controlled and coordinated sequence of activities during which a system is transferred progressively from the developer to the maintainer;
* Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and specialized (domain-specific) maintenance contracts negotiated by maintainers;
* Modification Request and Problem Report Help Desk: a problem-handling process used by maintainers to prioritize, documents and route the requests they receive;
* Modification Request acceptance/rejection: modification request work over a certain size/effort/complexity may be rejected by maintainers and rerouted to a developer.

== Categories of maintenance in ISO/IEC 14764==
[http://www.anderson.ucla.edu/x1960.xml E.B. Swanson] initially identified three categories of maintenance: corrective, adaptive, and perfective
&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=359522 E. Burt Swanson, The dimensions of maintenance. Proceedings of the 2nd international conference on Software engineering, San Francisco, 1976, pp 492 — 497]&lt;/ref&gt;.
These have since been updated and ISO/IEC 14764 presents:

* Corrective maintenance: Reactive modification of a software product performed after delivery to correct discovered problems.
* Adaptive maintenance: Modification of a software product performed after delivery to keep a software product usable in a changed or changing environment.
* Perfective maintenance: Modification of a software product after delivery to improve performance or maintainability.
* Preventive maintenance: Modification of a software product after delivery to detect and correct latent faults in the software product before they become effective faults.

There is also a notion of pre-delivery/pre-release maintenance which is all the good things you do to lower the total cost of ownership of the software.  Things like compliance with coding standards that includes software maintainability goals. The management of coupling and cohesion of the software.  The attainment of software supportability goals (SAE JA1004, JA1005 and JA1006 for example).  Note also that some academic institutions are carrying out research to quantify the cost to ongoing software maintenance due to the lack of resources such as design documents and system/software comprehension training and resources (multiply costs by approx. 1.5-2.0 where there is no design data available.).

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Software evolution''' is the term used in software engineering (specifically software maintenance) to refer to the process of developing software initially, then repeatedly updating it for various reasons.

==General introduction==

Fred Brooks, in his key book ''The Mythical Man-Month'',&lt;ref&gt;Fred Brooks, ''The Mythical Man-Month''. Addison-Wesley, 1975 &amp; 1995. ISBN
0-201-00650-2 &amp; ISBN 0-201-83595-9.&lt;/ref&gt; states that over 90% of the costs of a typical system arise in the maintenance phase, and that any successful piece of software will inevitably be maintained.

In fact, Agile methods stem from maintenance like activities in and around web based technologies, where the bulk of the capability comes from frameworks and standards.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

Software maintenance address bug fixes and minor enhancements and software evolution focus on adaptation and migration.

==Types of software maintenance==

E.B. Swanson initially identified three categories of maintenance: corrective, adaptive, and perfective. Four categories of software were then catalogued by Lientz and Swanson (1980) &lt;ref&gt;Lientz, B.P. and Swanson, E.B., ''Software Maintenance Management, A Study Of The Maintenance Of Computer Application Software In 487 Data Processing Organizations''. Addison-Wesley, Reading MA, 1980. ISBN 0201042053&lt;/ref&gt;.
These have since been updated and normalized internationally in the ISO/IEC 14764:2006:&lt;ref&gt;ISO/IEC 14764:2006, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Corrective maintenance'': Reactive modification of a software product performed after delivery to correct discovered problems;
* ''Adaptive maintenance'': Modification of a software product performed after delivery to keep a software product usable in a changed or changing environment;
* ''Perfective maintenance'': Modification of a software product after delivery to improve performance or maintainability;
* ''Preventive maintenance'': Modification of a software product after delivery to detect and correct latent faults in the software product before they become effective faults.

All of the preceding take place when there is a known requirement for change.

Although these categories were supplemented by many authors like Warren et al. (1999){{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} and  Chapin (2001){{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}, the ISO/IEC 14764:2006 international standard has kept the basic four categories.

More recently the description of software maintenance and evolution has been done using ontologies (Kitchemham et al. (1999),{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Derider (2002),{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Vizcaíno 2003,{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Dias (2003),{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} and Ruiz (2004)),{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} which enrich the description of the many evolution activities.

==Lehman's Laws of Software Evolution==
Prof. Meir M. Lehman, who worked at Imperial College London from 1972 to 2002, and his colleagues have identified a set of behaviours in the evolution of proprietary software. These behaviours (or observations) are known as ''Lehman's Laws'', and there are eight of them:

# Continuing Change
# Increasing Complexity
# Large Program Evolution
# Invariant Work-Rate
# Conservation of Familiarity
# Continuing Growth
# Declining Quality
# Feedback System

It is worth mentioning that the laws are believed to apply mainly to monolithic, proprietary software. For example, some empirical observations coming from the study of open source software development appear to challenge some of the laws {{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}.

The laws predict that change is inevitable and not a consequence of bad programming and that there are limits to what a software evolution team can achieve in terms of safely implementing changes and new functionality.

Maturity Models specific to software evolution have been developed to help improve processes to ensure continuous rejuvenation of the software evolves iteratively.

The &quot;global process&quot; that is made by the many stakeholders (e.g. developers, users, their managers) has many feedback loops. The evolution speed is a function of the feedback loop structure and other characteristics of the global system. Process simulation techniques, such as system dynamics can be useful in understanding and managing such global process.

Software evolution is not likely to be Darwinian, Lamarckian or Baldwinian, but an important phenomenon on its own. Giving the increasing dependence on software at all levels of society and economy, the successful evolution of software is becoming increasingly critical. This is an important topic of research that hasn't received much attention.

The evolution of software, because of its rapid path in comparison to other man-made entities, was seen by Lehman as the &quot;fruit fly&quot; of the study of the evolution of artificial systems.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Software project management''' is the art and science of planning and leading software projects&lt;ref name=&quot;Stellman05&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Stellman | first=Andrew | last2=Greene | first2=Jennifer | title=Applied Software Project Management | url=http://www.stellman-greene.com/aspm/ | publisher=O'Reilly Media | year=2005 | isbn=978-0-596-00948-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. It is a sub-discipline of project management in which software projects are planned, monitored and controlled.

==History==
The history of software project management is closely related to the history of software. Software was developed for dedicated purposes for dedicated machines until the concept of object-oriented programming began to become popular in the 1960's, making ''repeatable solutions'' possible for the software industry. Dedicated systems could be adapted to other uses thanks to component-based software engineering. Companies quickly understood the relative ease of use that software programming had over hardware circuitry, and the software industry grew very quickly in the 1970's and 1980's. To manage new development efforts, companies applied proven project management methods, but project schedules slipped during test runs, especially when confusion occurred in the gray zone between the user specifications and the delivered software. To be able to avoid these problems, software project management methods focused on matching user requirements to delivered products, in a method known now as the waterfall model. Since then, analysis of software project management failures has shown that the following are the most common causes:&lt;ref&gt;[http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/why-software-fails/5 IEEE] magazine article &quot;Why Software Fails&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;
# Unrealistic or unarticulated project goals
# Inaccurate estimates of needed resources
# Badly defined system requirements
# Poor reporting of the project's status
# Unmanaged risks
# Poor communication among customers, developers, and users
# Use of immature technology
# Inability to handle the project's complexity
# Sloppy development practices
# Poor project management
# Stakeholder politics
# Commercial pressures 

The first three items in the list above show the difficulties articulating the needs of the client in such a way that proper resources can deliver the proper project goals. Specific software project management tools are useful and often necessary, but the true art in software project management is applying the correct method and then using tools to support the method. Without a method, tools are worthless. Since the 1960's, several proprietary software project management methods have been developed by software manufacturers for their own use, while computer consulting firms have also developed similar methods for their clients. Today software project management methods are still evolving, but the current trend leads away from the waterfall model to a more cyclic project delivery model that imitates a Software release life cycle.

==Software development process==
A software development process is concerned primarily with the production aspect of software development, as opposed to the technical aspect, such as software tools. These processes exist primarily for supporting the management of software development, and are generally skewed toward addressing business concerns. Many software development processes can be run in a similar way to general project management processes. Examples are:

* Risk management is the process of measuring or assessing risk and then developing strategies to manage the risk. In general, the strategies employed include transferring the risk to another party, avoiding the risk, reducing the negative effect of the risk, and accepting some or all of the consequences of a particular risk. Risk management in software project management begins with the business case for starting the project, which includes a cost-benefit analysis as well as a list of fallback options for project failure, called a contingency plan.
** A subset of risk management that is gaining more and more attention is &quot;Opportunity Management&quot;, which means the same thing, except that the potential risk outcome will have a positive, rather than a negative impact. Though theoretically handled in the same way, using the term &quot;opportunity&quot; rather than the somewhat negative term &quot;risk&quot; helps to keep a team focussed on possible positive outcomes of any given risk register in their projects, such as spin-off projects, windfalls, and free extra resources.
* Requirements management is the process of identifying, eliciting, documenting, analyzing, tracing, prioritizing and agreeing on requirements and then controlling change and communicating to relevant stakeholders. New or altered computer system&lt;ref name=&quot;Stellman05&quot;/&gt; Requirements management, which includes Requirements analysis, is an important part of the software engineering process; whereby business analysts or software developers identify the needs or requirements of a client; having identified these requirements they are then in a position to design a solution.
* Change management is the process of identifying, documenting, analyzing, prioritizing and agreeing on changes to scope (project management) and then controlling changes and communicating to relevant stakeholders. Change impact analysis of new or altered scope, which includes Requirements analysis at the change level, is an important part of the software engineering process; whereby business analysts or software developers identify the altered needs or requirements of a client; having identified these requirements they are then in a position to re-design or modify a solution. Theoretically, each change can impact the timeline and budget of a software project, and therefore by definition must include risk-benefit analysis before approval.
* Software configuration management is the process of identifying, and documenting the scope itself, which is the software product underway, including all sub-products and changes and enabling communication of these to relevant stakeholders.  In general, the processes employed include version control, naming convention (programming), and software archival agreements.
* Release management is the process of identifying, documenting, prioritizing and agreeing on releases of software and then controlling the release schedule and communicating to relevant stakeholders. Most software projects have access to three software environments to which software can be released; Development, Test, and Production. In very large projects, where distributed teams need to integrate their work before release to users, there will often be more environments for testing, called unit testing, system testing, or integration testing, before release to User acceptance testing (UAT). 
** A subset of release management that is gaining more and more attention is Data Management, as obviously the users can only test based on data that they know, and &quot;real&quot; data is only in the software environment called &quot;production&quot;. In order to test their work, programmers must therefore also often create &quot;dummy data&quot; or &quot;data stubs&quot;. Traditionally, older versions of a production system were once used for this purpose, but as companies rely more and more on outside contributors for software development, company data may not be released to development teams. In complex environments, datasets may be created that are then migrated across test environments according to a test release schedule, much like the overall software release schedule.

==Project planning, monitoring and control==
The purpose of project planning is to identify the scope of the project, estimate the work involved, and create a project schedule. Project planning begins with requirements that define the software to be developed. The project plan is then developed to describe the tasks that will lead to completion.

The purpose of project monitoring and control is to keep the team and management up to date on the project's progress. If the project deviates from the plan, then the project manager can take action to correct the problem. Project monitoring and control involves status meetings to gather status from the team. When changes need to be made, change control is used to keep the products up to date.

==Issue==
In computing, the term '''issue''' is a unit of work to accomplish an improvement in a system.  An issue could be a bug, a requested feature, task, missing documentation, and so forth.  The word &quot;issue&quot; is popularly misused in lieu of &quot;problem.&quot;  This usage is probably related. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

For example, OpenOffice.org used to call their modified version of BugZilla IssueZilla.  As of September 2010, they call their system Issue Tracker.

Problems occur from time to time and fixing them in a timely fashion is essential to achieve correctness of a system and avoid delayed deliveries of products.

===Severity levels===

Issues are often categorized in terms of '''severity levels'''. Different companies have different definitions of severities, but some of the most common ones are:

* Critical
* High - The bug or issue affects a crucial part of a system, and must be fixed in order for it to resume normal operation.
* Medium - The bug or issue affects a minor part of a system, but has some impact on its operation. This severity level is assigned when a non-central requirement of a system is affected.
* Low - The bug or issue affects a minor part of a system, and has very little impact on its operation. This severity level is assigned when a non-central requirement of a system (and with lower importance) is affected.
* Cosmetic - The system works correctly, but the appearance does not match the expected one. For example: wrong colors, too much or too little spacing between contents, incorrect font sizes, typos, etc. This is the lowest priority issue.

In many software companies, issues are often investigated by Quality Assurance Analysts when they verify a system for correctness, and then assigned to the developer(s) that are responsible for resolving them. They can also be assigned by system users during the User Acceptance Testing (UAT) phase.

Issues are commonly communicated using Issue or Defect Tracking Systems. In some other cases, emails or instant messengers are used.

==Philosophy==
As a subdiscipline of project management, some regard the management of software development akin to the management of manufacturing, which can be performed by someone with management skills, but no programming skills. John C. Reynolds rebuts this view, and argues that software development is entirely design work, and compares a manager who cannot program to the managing editor of a newspaper who cannot write.&lt;ref&gt;John C. Reynolds, ''Some thoughts on teaching programming and programming languages'', SIGPLAN Notices, Volume 43, Issue 11, November 2008, p.108: &quot;Some argue that one can manage software production without the ability to program. This belief seems to arise from the mistaken view that software production is a form of manufacturing. But manufacturing is the repeated construction of identical objects, while software production is the construction of unique objects, i.e., the entire process is a form of design. As such it is closer to the production of a newspaper — so that a software manager who cannot program is akin to a managing editor who cannot write.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Software development efforts estimation''' is the process of predicting the most realistic use of effort required to develop or maintain software based on incomplete, uncertain and/or noisy input. Effort estimates may be used as input to project plans, iteration plans, budgets, investment analyses, pricing processes and bidding rounds.

== State-of-practice ==

Published surveys on estimation practice suggest that expert estimation is the dominant strategy when estimating software development effort&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
  | author = Jørgensen, M.
  | title = A Review of Studies on Expert Estimation of Software Development Effort
  | url = http://simula.no/research/engineering/publications/SE.4.Joergensen.2004.c
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Typically, effort estimates are over-optimistic and there is a strong over-confidence in their accuracy. The mean effort overrun seems to be about 30% and not decreasing over time. For a review of effort estimation error surveys, see &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
  | author = Molokken, K.	Jorgensen, M.
  | title = A review of software surveys on software effort estimation
  | url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=1237981
   }}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, the measurement of estimation error is not unproblematic, see Assessing and interpreting the accuracy of effort estimates.
The strong over-confidence in the accuracy of the effort estimates is illustrated by the finding that, on average, if a software professional is 90% confident or “almost sure” to include the actual effort in a minimum-maximum interval, the observed frequency of including the actual effort is only 60-70% &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
  | author = Jørgensen, M.	Teigen, K.H.	Ribu, K.	
  | title =  Better sure than safe? Over-confidence in judgement based software development effort prediction intervals
  | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6V0N-49N06GS-5&amp;_user=674998&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000036598&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=674998&amp;md5=36c6383445cf481447d06cb30c1ccb63 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Currently the term “effort estimate” is used to denote as different concepts as most likely use of effort (modal value), the effort that corresponds to a probability of 50% of not exceeding (median), the planned effort, the budgeted effort or the effort used to propose a bid or price to the client. This is believed to be unfortunate, because communication problems may occur and because the concepts serve different goals

== History ==

Software researchers and practitioners have been addressing the problems of effort estimation for software development projects since at least the 1960s; see, e.g., work by Farr &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
  | author = Farr, L.	Nanus, B.
  | title = Factors that affect the cost of computer programming
  | url = http://stinet.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=AD0603707
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Nelson &lt;ref&gt;Nelson, E. A. (1966). Management Handbook for the Estimation of Computer Programming Costs. AD-A648750, Systems Development Corp.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Most of the research has focused on the construction of formal software effort estimation models. The early models were typically based on regression analysis or mathematically derived from theories from other domains. Since then a high number of model building approaches have been evaluated, such as approaches founded on case-based reasoning, classification and regression trees, simulation, neural networks, Bayesian statistics, lexical analysis of requirement specifications, genetic programming, linear programming, economic production models, soft computing, fuzzy logic modeling, statistical bootstrapping, and combinations of two or more of these models. The perhaps most common estimation products today, e.g., the formal estimation models COCOMO and SLIM have their basis in estimation research conducted in the 1970s and 1980s. The estimation approaches based on functionality-based size measures, e.g., function points, is also based on research conducted in the 1970s and 1980s, but are re-appearing with modified size measures under different labels, such as “use case points” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Estimation approaches ==

There are many ways of categorizing estimation approaches, see for example &lt;ref&gt;Briand, L. C. and I. Wieczorek (2002). Resource estimation in software engineering. Encyclopedia of software engineering. J. J. Marcinak. New York, John Wiley &amp; Sons: 1160-1196.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | title =  A Systematic Review of Software Development Cost Estimation Studies
  | url = http://simula.no/research/engineering/publications/Jorgensen.2007.1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. The top level categories are the following:

* Expert estimation: The quantification step, i.e., the step where the estimate is produced based on judgmental processes.
* Formal estimation model: The quantification step is based on mechanical processes, e.g., the use of a formula derived from historical data.
* Combination-based estimation: The quantification step is based on a judgmental or mechanical combination of estimates from different sources.

Below are examples of estimation approaches within each category.

== Selection of estimation approach ==

The evidence on differences in estimation accuracy of different estimation approaches and models suggest that there is no “best approach” and that the relative accuracy of one approach or model in comparison to another depends strongly on the context 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
  | author = Shepperd, M.	Kadoda, G.

  | url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/login.jsp?url=/iel5/32/20846/00965341.pdf?arnumber=965341 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;. This implies that different organizations benefit from different estimation approaches. Findings, summarized in &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
  | author = Jørgensen, M.			
  | title =   Estimation of Software Development Work Effort:Evidence on Expert Judgment and Formal Models
  | url = http://simula.no/research/engineering/publications/Jorgensen.2007.2 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;, that may support the selection of estimation approach based on the expected accuracy of an approach include:

* Expert estimation is on average at least as accurate as model-based effort estimation. In particular, situations with unstable relationships and information of high importance not included in the model may suggest use of expert estimation. This assumes, of course, that experts with relevant experience are available. 
* Formal estimation models not tailored to a particular organization’s own context, may be very inaccurate. Use of own historical data is consequently crucial if one cannot be sure that the estimation model’s core relationships (e.g., formula parameters) are based on similar project contexts.
* Formal estimation models may be particularly useful in situations where the model is tailored to the organization’s context (either through use of own historical data or that the model is derived from similar projects and contexts), and/or it is likely that the experts’ estimates will be subject to a strong degree of wishful thinking.

The most robust finding, in many forecasting domains, is that combination of estimates from independent sources, preferable applying different approaches, will on average improve the estimation accuracy &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;.

In addition, other factors such as ease of understanding and communicating the results of an approach, ease of use of an approach, cost of introduction of an approach should be considered in a selection process.

== Uncertainty assessment approaches ==

The uncertainty of an effort estimate can be described through a prediction interval (PI). An effort PI is based on a stated certainty level and contains a minimum and a maximum effort value. For example, a project leader may estimate that the most likely effort of a project is 1000 work-hours and that it is 90% certain that the actual effort will be between 500 and 2000 work-hours. Then, the interval [500, 2000] work-hours is the 90% PI of the effort estimate of 1000 work-hours. Frequently, other terms are used instead of PI, e.g., prediction bounds, prediction limits, interval prediction, prediction region and, unfortunately, confidence interval. An important difference between confidence interval and PI is that PI refers to the uncertainty of an estimate, while confidence interval usually refers to the uncertainty associated with the parameters of an estimation model or distribution, e.g., the uncertainty of the mean value of a distribution of effort values. The confidence level of a PI refers to the expected (or subjective) probability that the real value is within the predicted interval&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
  | author = Armstrong, J. S.			
  | title =  Principles of forecasting: A handbook for researchers and practitioners
  | url = http://www.forecastingprinciples.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

There are several possible approaches to calculate effort PIs, e.g., formal approaches based on regression or bootstrapping &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
  | author = Angelis, L.	Stamelos, I.			
  | title =  A simulation tool for efficient analogy based cost estimation
  | url = http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=594467&amp;dl=ACM&amp;coll=portal }}&lt;/ref&gt;, formal or judgmental approaches based on the distribution of previous estimation error

Expert judgments based on the distribution of previous estimation error has been found to systematically lead to more realistic uncertainty assessment than the traditional minimum-maximum effort intervals in several studies, see for example &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | title =  Realism in assessment of effort estimation uncertainty: It matters how you ask
  | url = http://simula.no/research/engineering/publications/SE.4.Joergensen.2004.e }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Assessing and interpreting the accuracy of effort estimates ==

The most common measures of the average estimation accuracy is the MMRE (Mean Magnitude of Relative Error), where MRE is defined as: 

''MRE'' = |actual effort − estimated effort| / |actual effort|

This measure has been criticized &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A high estimation error cannot automatically be interpreted as an indicator of low estimation ability. Alternative, competing or complementing, reasons include low cost control of project, high complexity of development work, and more delivered functionality than originally estimated. A framework for improved use and interpretation of estimation error measurement is included in &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Psychological issues related to effort estimation ==

There are many psychological factors potentially explaining the strong tendency towards over-optimistic effort estimates that need to be dealt with to increase accuracy of effort estimates. These factors are essential even when using formal estimation models, because much of the input to these models is judgment-based. Factors that have been demonstrated to be important are: Wishful thinking, anchoring, planning fallacy and cognitive dissonance. A discussion on these and other factors can be found in work by Jørgensen and Grimstad &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve">The ability to accurately estimate the time and/or cost taken for a project to come in to its successful conclusion is a serious problem for software engineers. The use of a repeatable, clearly defined and well understood software development process has, in recent years, shown itself to be the most effective method of gaining useful historical data that can be used for statistical estimation. In particular, the act of sampling more frequently, coupled with the loosening of constraints between parts of a project, has allowed more accurate estimation and more rapid development times.

'''Computer-aided software engineering''' ('''CASE''') is the scientific application of a set of tools and methods to a software system which is meant to result in high-quality, defect-free, and maintainable software products.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, D.L (1989). &quot;Selecting and effectively using a computer aided software engineering tool&quot;. Annual Westinghouse computer symposium; 6–7 Nov 1989; Pittsburgh, PA (U.S.); DOE Project.&lt;/ref&gt; It also refers to methods for the development of information systems together with automated tools that can be used in the software development process.&lt;ref&gt;P. Loucopoulos and V. Karakostas (1995). ''System Requirements Engineering''. McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
The term &quot;computer-aided software engineering&quot; (CASE) can refer to the software used for the automated development of systems software, i.e., computer code. The CASE functions include analysis, design, and programming. CASE tools automate methods for designing, documenting, and producing structured computer code in the desired programming language.

CASE software supports the software process activities such as requirement engineering, design, program development and testing. Therefore, CASE tools include design editors, data dictionaries, compilers, debuggers, system building tools, etc.

CASE also refers to the methods dedicated to an engineering discipline for the development of information system using automated tools.

CASE is mainly used for the development of quality software which will perform effectively.

== History ==
The ISDOS project at the University of Michigan initiated a great deal of interest in the whole concept of using computer systems to help analysts in the very difficult process of analysing requirements and developing systems. Several papers by Daniel Teichroew fired a whole generation of enthusiasts with the potential of automated systems development. His PSL/PSA tool was a CASE tool although it predated the term. His insights into the power of meta-meta-models was inspiring, particularly to a former student, Dr. Hasan Sayani, currently Professor, Program Director at University of Maryland University College.

Another major thread emerged as a logical extension to the DBMS directory. By extending the range of meta-data held, the attributes of an application could be held within a dictionary and used at runtime. This &quot;active dictionary&quot; became the precursor to the more modern &quot;model driven execution&quot; (MDE) capability. However, the active dictionary did not provide a graphical representation of any of the meta-data. It was the linking of the concept of a dictionary holding analysts' meta-data, as derived from the use of an integrated set of techniques, together with the graphical representation of such data that gave rise to the earlier versions of I-CASE.

The term CASE was originally coined by software company Nastec Corporation of Southfield, Michigan in 1982 with their original integrated graphics and text editor GraphiText, which also was the first microcomputer-based system to use hyperlinks to cross-reference text strings in documents&amp;mdash;an early forerunner of today's web page link.  GraphiText's successor product, DesignAid, was the first microprocessor-based tool to logically and semantically evaluate software and system design diagrams and build a data dictionary.

Under the direction of Albert F. Case, Jr. vice president for product management and consulting, and Vaughn Frick, director of product management, the DesignAid product suite was expanded to support analysis of a wide range of structured analysis and design methodologies, notably Ed Yourdon and Tom DeMarco, Chris Gane &amp; Trish Sarson, Ward-Mellor (real-time) SA/SD and Warnier-Orr (data driven).

The next entrant into the market was Excelerator from Index Technology in Cambridge, Mass.  While DesignAid ran on Convergent Technologies and later Burroughs Ngen networked microcomputers, Index launched Excelerator on the IBM PC/AT platform. While, at the time of launch, and for several years, the IBM platform did not support networking or a centralized database as did the Convergent Technologies or Burroughs machines, the allure of IBM was strong, and Excelerator came to prominence. Hot on the heels of Excelerator were a rash of offerings from companies such as Knowledgeware (James Martin, Fran Tarkenton and Don Addington), Texas Instrument's IEF and Accenture's FOUNDATION toolset (METHOD/1, DESIGN/1, INSTALL/1, FCP).

CASE tools were at their peak in the early 1990s.  At the time IBM had proposed AD/Cycle, which was an alliance of software vendors centered around IBM's Software repository using IBM DB2 in mainframe and OS/2:

:''The application development tools can be from several sources: from IBM, from vendors, and from the customers themselves. IBM has entered into relationships with Bachman Information Systems, Index Technology Corporation, and Knowledgeware, Inc. wherein selected products from these vendors will be marketed through an IBM complementary marketing program to provide offerings that will help to achieve complete life-cycle coverage''.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADC_SAaA&quot;&gt;&quot;AD/Cycle strategy and architecture&quot;, IBM Systems Journal, Vol 29, NO 2, 1990; p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the decline of the mainframe, AD/Cycle and the Big CASE tools died off, opening the market for the mainstream CASE tools of today. Nearly all of the leaders of the CASE market of the early 1990s ended up being purchased by Computer Associates, including IEW, IEF, ADW, Cayenne, and Learmonth &amp; Burchett Management Systems (LBMS).

# ''Tasks'' support only specific tasks in the software process.
# ''Workbenches'' support only one or a few activities.
# ''Environments'' support (a large part of) the software process.
Workbenches and environments are generally built as collections of tools. Tools can therefore be either stand alone products or components of workbenches and environments.

=== Tools ===
CASE tools are a class of software that automate many of the activities involved in various life cycle phases. For example, when establishing the functional requirements of a proposed application, prototyping tools can be used to develop graphic models of application screens to assist end users to visualize how an application will look after development. Subsequently, system designers can use automated design tools to transform the prototyped functional requirements into detailed design documents. Programmers can then use automated code generators to convert the design documents into code. Automated tools can be used collectively, as mentioned, or individually. For example, prototyping tools could be used to define application requirements that get passed to design technicians who convert the requirements into detailed designs in a traditional manner using flowcharts and narrative documents, without the assistance of automated design software.&lt;ref name=&quot;FFIEC08&quot;&gt; [http://www.ffiec.gov/ffiecinfobase/booklets/d_a/10.html Software Development Techniques]. In: ''FFIEC InfoBase''. Retrieved 26 Oct 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Existing CASE tools can be classified along 4 different dimensions:
# Life-cycle support
# Integration dimension
# Construction dimension
# Knowledge-based CASE dimension&lt;ref&gt;Software Engineering: Tools, Principles and Techniques by Sangeeta Sabharwal, Umesh Publications&lt;/ref&gt;

Let us take the meaning of these dimensions along with their examples one by one:

; Life-Cycle Based CASE Tools
This dimension classifies CASE Tools on the basis of the activities they support in the information systems life cycle. They can be classified as Upper or Lower CASE tools.

* Upper CASE Tools support strategic planning and construction of concept-level products and ignore the design aspect. They support traditional diagrammatic languages such as ER diagrams, Data flow diagram, Structure charts, Decision Trees, Decision tables, etc.
* Lower CASE Tools concentrate on the back end activities of the software life cycle, such as physical design, debugging, construction, testing, component integration, maintenance, reengineering and reverse engineering.

; Integration dimension
Three main CASE Integration dimensions have been proposed:&lt;ref&gt;Evans R. Rock. ''Case Analyst Workbenches: A Detailed Product Evaluation''. Volume 1, pp. 229–242 by&lt;/ref&gt;
# CASE Framework
# ICASE Tools
# Integrated Project Support Environment(IPSE)

=== Workbenches ===
Workbenches integrate several CASE tools into one application to support specific software-process activities. Hence they achieve:
*a homogeneous and consistent interface (presentation integration).
*easy invocation of tools and tool chains (control integration).
*access to a common data set managed in a centralized way (data integration).

CASE workbenches can be further classified into following 8 classes:&lt;ref name=&quot;AF_93&quot; /&gt;
#Business planning and modeling
#Analysis and design
#User-interface development
#Programming
#Verification and validation
#Maintenance and reverse engineering
#Configuration management
#Project management

=== Environments ===
An environment is a collection of CASE tools and workbenches that supports the software process. CASE environments are classified based on the focus/basis of integration&lt;ref name=&quot;AF_93&quot; /&gt;
#Toolkits
#Language-centered
#Integrated
#Fourth generation
#Process-centered

;Toolkits
Toolkits are loosely integrated collections of products easily extended by aggregating different tools and workbenches. Typically, the support provided by a toolkit is limited to programming, configuration management and project management. And the toolkit itself is environments extended from basic sets of operating system tools, for example, the Unix Programmer's Work Bench and the VMS VAX Set. In addition, toolkits' loose integration requires user to activate tools by explicit invocation or simple control mechanisms. The resulting files are unstructured and could be in different format, therefore the access of file from different tools may require explicit file format conversion. However, since the only constraint for adding a new component is the formats of the files, toolkits can be easily and incrementally extended.&lt;ref name=&quot;AF_93&quot; /&gt;

;Language-centered
The environment itself is written in the programming language for which it was developed, thus enabling users to reuse, customize and extend the environment. Integration of code in different languages is a major issue for language-centered environments. Lack of process and data integration is also a problem. The strengths of these environments include good level of presentation and control integration. Interlisp, Smalltalk, Rational, and KEE are examples of language-centered environments.&lt;ref name=&quot;AF_93&quot; /&gt;

;Integrated
These environments achieve presentation integration by providing uniform, consistent, and coherent tool  and workbench interfaces. Data integration is achieved through the ''repository'' concept: they have a specialized database managing all information produced and accessed in the environment. Examples of integrated environment are IBM AD/Cycle and DEC Cohesion.&lt;ref name=&quot;AF_93&quot; /&gt;

;Fourth-generation
Fourth-generation environments were the first integrated environments. They are sets of tools and workbenches supporting the development of a specific class of program: electronic data processing and business-oriented applications. In general, they include programming tools, simple configuration management tools, document handling facilities and, sometimes, a code generator to produce code in lower level languages. Informix 4GL, and Focus fall into this category.&lt;ref name=&quot;AF_93&quot; /&gt;

;Process-centered
Environments in this category focus on process integration with other integration dimensions as starting points. A process-centered environment operates by interpreting a process model created by specialized tools. They usually consist of tools handling two functions:

== Applications ==
All  aspects of the software development life cycle can be supported by software tools, and so the use of tools from across the spectrum can, arguably, be described as CASE; from project management software through tools for business and functional analysis, system design, code storage, compilers, translation tools, test software, and so on.

However, tools that are concerned with analysis and design, and with using design information to create parts (or all) of the software product, are most frequently thought of as CASE tools. CASE applied, for instance, to a database software product, might normally involve:
* Modeling business / real-world processes and data flow
* Development of data models in the form of entity-relationship diagrams
* Development of process and function descriptions

== Risks and associated controls ==
Common CASE risks and associated controls include:

* ''Inadequate standardization'': Linking CASE tools from different vendors (design tool from Company X, programming tool from Company Y) may be difficult if the products do not use standardized code structures and data classifications. File formats can be converted, but usually not economically. Controls include using tools from the same vendor, or using tools based on standard protocols and insisting on demonstrated compatibility. Additionally, if organizations obtain tools for only a portion of the development process, they should consider acquiring them from a vendor that has a full line of products to ensure future compatibility if they add more tools.&lt;ref name=&quot;FFIEC08&quot;/&gt;
* ''Unrealistic expectations'': Organizations often implement CASE technologies to reduce development costs. Implementing CASE strategies usually involves high start-up costs. Generally, management must be willing to accept a long-term payback period. Controls include requiring senior managers to define their purpose and strategies for implementing CASE technologies.&lt;ref name=&quot;FFIEC08&quot;/&gt;
* ''Slow implementation'': Implementing CASE technologies can involve a significant change from traditional development environments. Typically, organizations should not use CASE tools the first time on critical projects or projects with short deadlines because of the lengthy training process. Additionally, organizations should consider using the tools on smaller, less complex projects and gradually implementing the tools to allow more training time.&lt;ref name=&quot;FFIEC08&quot;/&gt;
* ''Weak repository controls'': Failure to adequately control access to CASE repositories may result in security breaches or damage to the work documents, system designs, or code modules stored in the repository. Controls include protecting the repositories with appropriate access, version, and backup controls.&lt;ref name=&quot;FFIEC08&quot;/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Compiler.svg|right|thumb|350px|A diagram of the operation of a typical multi-language, multi-target compiler.]]

A '''compiler''' is a  computer program (or set of programs) that transforms source code written in a programming language (the ''source language'') into another computer language (the ''target language'', often having a binary form known as ''object code'').  The most common reason for wanting to transform source code is to create an executable program.

The name &quot;compiler&quot; is primarily used for programs that translate source code from a high-level programming language to a lower level language (e.g., assembly language or machine code). If the compiled program can run on a computer whose CPU or operating system is different from the one on which the compiler runs, the compiler is known as a cross-compiler. A program that translates from a low level language to a higher level one is a ''decompiler''.  A program that translates between high-level languages is usually called a ''language translator'', ''source to source translator'', or ''language converter''. A ''language rewriter'' is usually a program that translates the form of expressions without a change of language.

A compiler is likely to perform many or all of the following operations: lexical analysis, preprocessing, parsing, semantic analysis (Syntax-directed translation), code generation, and code optimization.

Program faults caused by incorrect compiler behavior can be very difficult to track down and work around; therefore, compiler implementors invest a lot of time ensuring the correctness of their software.

The term compiler-compiler is sometimes used to refer to a parser generator, a tool often used to help create the lexer and parser.

==History==
Software for early computers was primarily written in assembly language for many years. Higher level programming languages were not invented until the benefits of being able to reuse software on different kinds of CPUs started to become significantly greater than the cost of writing a compiler.  The very limited memory capacity of early computers also created many technical problems when implementing a compiler.

Towards the end of the 1950s, machine-independent programming languages were first proposed. Subsequently, several experimental compilers were developed. The first compiler was written by Grace Hopper, in 1952, for the A-0 programming language. The FORTRAN&lt;!-- ###here (only), upper-case FORTRAN is correct, as it was the name used at the time, and on IBM's early compilers ###--&gt; team led by John Backus at IBM is generally credited as having introduced the first complete compiler in 1957. COBOL was an early language to be compiled on multiple architectures, in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.interesting-people.org/archives/interesting-people/199706/msg00011.html |title=IP: The World's First COBOL Compilers |date=12 June 1997 |publisher=interesting-people.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many application domains the idea of using a higher level language quickly caught on.  Because of the expanding functionality supported by newer programming languages and the increasing complexity of computer architectures, compilers have become more and more complex.

Early compilers were written in assembly language. The first ''self-hosting'' compiler &amp;mdash; capable of compiling its own source code in a high-level language &amp;mdash; was created for Lisp by Tim Hart and Mike Levin at MIT in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=ftp://publications.ai.mit.edu/ai-publications/pdf/AIM-039.pdf |author=T. Hart and M. Levin |title=The New Compiler, AIM-39 - CSAIL Digital Archive - Artificial Intelligence Laboratory Series |publisher=publications.ai.mit.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1970s it has become common practice to implement a compiler in the language it compiles, although both Pascal and C have been popular choices for implementation language. Building a self-hosting compiler is a bootstrapping problem—the first such compiler for a language must be compiled either by a compiler written in a different language, or (as in Hart and Levin's Lisp compiler) compiled by running the compiler in an interpreter.

=== Compilers in education ===
Compiler construction and compiler optimization are taught at universities and schools as part of the computer science curriculum. Such courses are usually supplemented with the implementation of a compiler for an educational programming language. A well-documented example is Niklaus Wirth's PL/0 compiler, which Wirth used to teach compiler construction in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.246.dk/pl0.html |title=The PL/0 compiler/interpreter}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of its simplicity, the PL/0 compiler introduced several influential concepts to the field:

# Program development by stepwise refinement (also the title of a 1971 paper by Wirth)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.acm.org/classics/dec95/ |title=The ACM Digital Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The use of a recursive descent parser
# The use of EBNF to specify the syntax of a language
# A code generator producing portable P-code
# The use of T-diagrams&lt;ref&gt;T diagrams were first introduced for describing bootstrapping and cross-compiling compilers in McKeeman et al. ''A Compiler Generator'' (1971). Conway described the broader concept before that with his UNCOL in 1958, to which Bratman added in 1961: H. Bratman, “An alternate form of the ´UNCOL diagram´“, Comm. ACM 4 (March 1961) 3, p. 142. Later on, others, including P.D. Terry, gave an explanation and usage of T-diagrams in their textbooks on the topic of compiler construction. Cf. Terry, 1997, [http://scifac.ru.ac.za/compilers/cha03g.htm Chapter 3]. T-diagrams are also now used to describe client-server interconnectivity on the World Wide Web: cf. Patrick Closhen, et al. 1997: [http://pu.rbg.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/docs/HJH-19990217-etal-T-diagrams.doc ''T-Diagrams as Visual Language to Illustrate WWW Technology''], Darmstadt University of Technology, Darmstadt, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; in the formal description of the bootstrapping problem

== Compilation ==

Compilers enabled the development of programs that are machine-independent. Before the development of FORTRAN (FORmula TRANslator), the first higher-level language, in the 1950s, machine-dependent assembly language was widely used. While assembly language produces more reusable and relocatable programs than machine code on the same architecture, it has to be modified or rewritten if the program is to be executed on different hardware architecture.

With the advance of high-level programming languages soon followed after FORTRAN, such as COBOL, C, BASIC, programmers can write machine-independent source programs. A compiler translates the high-level source programs into target programs in machine languages for the specific hardwares. Once the target program is generated, the user can execute the program.

=== The structure of a compiler ===
Compilers bridge source programs in high-level languages with the underlying hardware. A compiler requires 1) determining the correctness of the syntax of programs, 2) generating correct and efficient object code, 3) run-time organization, and 4) formatting output according to assembler and/or linker conventions. A compiler consists of three main parts: the frontend, the middle-end, and the backend.

The '''frontend''' checks whether the program is correctly written in terms of the programming language syntax and semantics. Here legal and illegal programs are recognized. Errors are reported, if any, in a useful way. Type checking is also performed by collecting type information. The frontend then generates an ''intermediate representation'' or ''IR'' of the source code for processing by the middle-end.

The '''middle-end''' is where optimization takes place. Typical transformations for optimization are removal of useless or unreachable code, discovery and propagation of constant values, relocation of computation to a less frequently executed place (e.g., out of a loop), or specialization of computation based on the context. The middle-end generates another IR for the following backend. Most optimization efforts are focused on this part.

The '''backend''' is responsible for translating the IR from the middle-end into assembly code. The target instruction(s) are chosen for each IR instruction. Variables are also selected for the registers. Backend utilizes the hardware by figuring out how to keep parallel FUs busy, filling delay slots, and so on. Although most algorithms for optimization are in NP, heuristic techniques are well-developed.

== Compiler output ==
One classification of compilers is by the platform on which their generated code executes. This is known as the ''target platform.''
  
A ''native'' or ''hosted'' compiler is one which output is intended to directly run on the same type of computer and operating system that the compiler itself runs on. The output of a cross compiler is designed to run on a different platform.  Cross compilers are often used when developing software for embedded systems that are not intended to support a software development environment.

The output of a compiler that produces code for a virtual machine (VM) may or may not be executed on the same platform as the compiler that produced it.  For this reason such compilers are not usually classified as native or cross compilers.

=== Compiled versus interpreted languages ===
Higher-level programming languages are generally divided for convenience into compiled languages and interpreted languages. However, in practice there is rarely anything about a language that ''requires'' it to be exclusively compiled or exclusively interpreted, although it is possible to design languages that rely on re-interpretation at run time. The categorization usually reflects the most popular or widespread implementations of a language &amp;mdash; for instance, BASIC is sometimes called an interpreted language, and C a compiled one, despite the existence of BASIC compilers and C interpreters.

Modern trends toward just-in-time compilation and bytecode interpretation at times blur the traditional categorizations of compilers and interpreters.

Some language specifications spell out that implementations ''must'' include a compilation facility; for example, Common Lisp. However, there is nothing inherent in the definition of Common Lisp that stops it from being interpreted. Other languages have features that are very easy to implement in an interpreter, but make writing a compiler much harder; for example, APL, SNOBOL4, and many scripting languages allow programs to construct arbitrary source code at runtime with regular string operations, and then execute that code by passing it to a special evaluation function. To implement these features in a compiled language, programs must usually be shipped with a runtime library that includes a version of the compiler itself.

=== Hardware compilation ===
The output of some compilers may target hardware at a very low level, for example a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) or structured Application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC).  Such compilers are said to be ''hardware compilers'' or synthesis tools because the source code they compile effectively control the final configuration of the hardware and how it operates; the output of the compilation are not instructions that are executed in sequence - only an interconnection of transistors or lookup tables.
For example, XST is the Xilinx Synthesis Tool used for configuring FPGAs. Similar tools are available from Altera, Synplicity, Synopsys and other vendors.

== Compiler construction ==
In the early days, the approach taken to compiler design used to be directly affected by the complexity of the processing, the experience of the person(s) designing it, and the resources available.

A compiler for a relatively simple language written by one person might be a single, monolithic piece of software.  When the source language is large and complex, and high quality output is required, the design may be split into a number of relatively independent phases.  Having separate phases means development can be parceled up into small parts and given to different people.  It also becomes much easier to replace a single phase by an improved one, or to insert new phases later (e.g., additional optimizations).

The division of the compilation processes into phases was championed by the Production Quality Compiler-Compiler Project (PQCC) at Carnegie Mellon University.  This project introduced the terms ''front end'', ''middle end'', and ''back end''.

All but the smallest of compilers have more than two phases.  However, these phases are usually regarded as being part of the front end or the back end.  The point at which these two ''ends'' meet is open to debate.  The front end is generally considered to be where syntactic and semantic processing takes place, along with translation to a lower level of representation (than source code).

The middle end is usually designed to perform optimizations on a form other than the source code or machine code.  This source code/machine code independence is intended to enable generic optimizations to be shared between versions of the compiler supporting different languages and target processors.

The back end takes the output from the middle.  It may perform more analysis, transformations and optimizations that are for a particular computer.  Then, it generates code for a particular processor and OS.

This front-end/middle/back-end approach makes it possible to combine front ends for different languages with back ends for different CPUs.  Practical examples of this approach are the GNU Compiler Collection, LLVM, and the Amsterdam Compiler Kit, which have multiple front-ends, shared analysis and multiple back-ends.

===One-pass versus multi-pass compilers===
Classifying compilers by number of passes has its background in the hardware resource limitations of computers.  Compiling involves performing lots of work and early computers did not have enough memory to contain one program that did all of this work.  So compilers were split up into smaller programs which each made a pass over the source (or some representation of it) performing some of the required analysis and translations.

The ability to compile in a single pass has classically been seen as a benefit because it simplifies the job of writing a compiler and one pass compilers generally compile faster than multi-pass compilers.  Thus, partly driven by the resource limitations of early systems, many early languages were specifically designed so that they could be compiled in a single pass (e.g., Pascal).

In some cases the design of a language feature may require a compiler to perform more than one pass over the source.  For instance, consider a declaration appearing on line 20 of the source which affects the translation of a statement appearing on line 10.  In this case, the first pass needs to gather information about declarations appearing after statements that they affect, with the actual translation happening during a subsequent pass.

The disadvantage of compiling in a single pass is that it is not possible to perform many of the sophisticated optimizations needed to generate high quality code.  It can be difficult to count exactly how many passes an optimizing compiler makes.  For instance, different phases of optimization may analyse one expression many times but only analyse another expression once.

Splitting a compiler up into small programs is a technique used by researchers interested in producing provably correct compilers.  Proving the correctness of a set of small programs often requires less effort than proving the correctness of a larger, single, equivalent program.

While the typical multi-pass compiler outputs machine code from its final pass, there are several other types:

*A &quot;source-to-source compiler&quot; is a type of compiler that takes a high level language as its input and outputs a high level language.  For example, an automatic parallelizing compiler will frequently take in a high level language program as an input and then  transform the code and annotate it with parallel code annotations (e.g. OpenMP) or language constructs (e.g. Fortran's &lt;code&gt;DOALL&lt;/code&gt; statements).
*Stage compiler that compiles to assembly language of a theoretical machine, like some Prolog implementations
**This Prolog machine is also known as the Warren Abstract Machine (or WAM).
**Bytecode compilers for Java, Python, and many more are also a subtype of this.
*Just-in-time compiler, used by Smalltalk and Java systems, and also by Microsoft .NET's Common Intermediate Language (CIL)
**Applications are delivered in bytecode, which is compiled to native machine code just prior to execution.

=== Front end ===
The front end analyzes the source code to build an internal representation of the program, called the intermediate representation or ''IR''.  It also manages the symbol table, a data structure mapping each symbol in the source code to associated information such as location, type and scope.  This is done over several phases, which includes some of the following:

# '''Line reconstruction'''.  Languages which strop their keywords or allow arbitrary spaces within identifiers require a phase before parsing, which converts the input character sequence to a canonical form ready for the parser.  The top-down, recursive-descent, table-driven parsers used in the 1960s typically read the source one character at a time and did not require a separate tokenizing phase.  Atlas Autocode, and Imp (and some implementations of ALGOL and Coral 66) are examples of stropped languages which compilers would have a ''Line Reconstruction'' phase.
# Lexical analysis breaks the source code text into small pieces called ''tokens''.  Each token is a single atomic unit of the language, for instance a keyword, identifier or symbol name.  The token syntax is typically a regular language, so a finite state automaton constructed from a regular expression can be used to recognize it.  This phase is also called lexing or scanning, and the software doing lexical analysis is called a lexical analyzer or scanner.
# Preprocessing.  Some languages, e.g., C, require a preprocessing phase which supports macro substitution and conditional compilation. Typically the preprocessing phase occurs before syntactic or semantic analysis; e.g. in the case of C, the preprocessor manipulates lexical tokens rather than syntactic forms. However, some languages such as Scheme support macro substitutions based on syntactic forms.
# Syntax analysis involves parsing the token sequence to identify the syntactic structure of the program. This phase typically builds a parse tree, which replaces the linear sequence of tokens with a tree structure built according to the rules of a formal grammar which define the language's syntax. The parse tree is often analyzed, augmented, and transformed by later phases in the compiler.
# Semantic analysis is the phase in which the compiler adds semantic information to the parse tree and builds the symbol table. This phase performs semantic checks such as type checking (checking for type errors), or object binding (associating variable and function references with their definitions), or definite assignment (requiring all local variables to be initialized before use), rejecting incorrect programs or issuing warnings. Semantic analysis usually requires a complete parse tree, meaning that this phase logically follows the parsing phase, and logically precedes the code generation phase, though it is often possible to fold multiple phases into one pass over the code in a compiler implementation.

===Back end===
The term ''back end'' is sometimes confused with ''code generator'' because of the overlapped functionality of generating assembly code. Some literature uses ''middle end'' to distinguish the generic analysis and optimization phases in the back end from the machine-dependent code generators. 

The main phases of the back end include the following:

# Analysis: This is the gathering of program information from the intermediate representation derived from the input. Typical analyses are data flow analysis to build use-define chains, dependence analysis, alias analysis, pointer analysis, escape analysis etc. Accurate analysis is the basis for any compiler optimization. The call graph and control flow graph are usually also built during the analysis phase.
# Optimization: the intermediate language representation is transformed into functionally equivalent but faster (or smaller) forms. Popular optimizations are inline expansion, dead code elimination, constant propagation, loop transformation, register allocation and even automatic parallelization.
# Code generation: the transformed intermediate language is translated into the output language, usually the native machine language of the system. This involves resource and storage decisions, such as deciding which variables to fit into registers and memory and the selection and scheduling of appropriate machine instructions along with their associated addressing modes (see also Sethi-Ullman algorithm).

Compiler analysis is the prerequisite for any compiler optimization, and they tightly work together. For example, dependence analysis is crucial for loop transformation. 

In addition, the scope of compiler analysis and optimizations vary greatly, from as small as a basic block to the procedure/function level, or even over the whole program (interprocedural optimization). Obviously, a compiler can potentially do a better job using a broader view. But that broad view is not free: large scope analysis and optimizations are very costly in terms of compilation time and memory space; this is especially true for interprocedural analysis and optimizations.

Interprocedural analysis and optimizations are common in modern commercial compilers from HP, IBM, SGI, Intel, Microsoft, and Sun Microsystems. The open source GCC was criticized for a long time for lacking powerful interprocedural optimizations, but it is changing in this respect. Another open source compiler with full analysis and optimization infrastructure is Open64, which is used by many organizations for research and commercial purposes.

Due to the extra time and space needed for compiler analysis and optimizations, some compilers skip them by default. Users have to use compilation options to explicitly tell the compiler which optimizations should be enabled.

==Compiler correctness==
Compiler correctness is the branch of software engineering that deals with trying to show that a compiler behaves according to its language specification.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}  Techniques include developing the compiler using formal methods and using rigorous testing (often called compiler validation) on an existing compiler.

== Related techniques ==
Assembly language is a type of low-level language and a program that compiles it is more commonly known as an ''assembler'', with the inverse program known as a ''disassembler''.

A program that translates from a low level language to a higher level one is a ''decompiler''.  

A program that translates between high-level languages is usually called a ''language translator'', ''source to source translator'', ''language converter'', or ''language rewriter''. The last term is usually applied to translations that do not involve a change of language.

== International conferences and organizations ==
Every year, the '''European Joint Conferences on Theory and Practice of Software''' (ETAPS) sponsors the '''International Conference on Compiler Construction''' (CC), with papers from both the academic and industrial sectors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etaps.org/ ETAPS] - European Joint Conferences on Theory and Practice of Software.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''debugger''' or '''debugging tool''' is a computer program that is used to test and debug other programs (the &quot;target&quot; program). The code to be examined might alternatively be running on an ''instruction set simulator'' (ISS), a technique that allows great power in its ability to halt when specific conditions are encountered but which will typically be somewhat slower than executing the code directly on the appropriate (or the same) processor. Some debuggers offer two modes of operation - full or partial simulation, to limit this impact.

A &quot;crash&quot; happens when the program cannot normally continue because of a programming bug. For example, the program might have tried to use an instruction not available on the current version of the CPU or attempted to access unavailable or protected memory. When the program &quot;crashes&quot; or reaches a preset condition, the debugger typically shows the position in the original code if it is a '''source-level debugger''' or '''symbolic debugger''', commonly now seen  in integrated development environments.  If it is a '''low-level debugger''' or a '''machine-language debugger''' it shows the line in the disassembly (unless it also has online access to the original source code and can display the appropriate section of code from the assembly or compilation).

Typically, debuggers also offer more sophisticated functions such as running a program step by step ('''single-stepping''' or program animation), stopping ('''breaking''') (pausing the program to examine the current state) at some event or specified instruction by means of a breakpoint, and tracking the values of some variables.  Some debuggers have the ability to modify the state of the program while it is running, rather than merely to observe it. It may also be possible to continue execution at a different location in the program to bypass a crash or logical error.

The importance of a good debugger cannot be overstated. Indeed, the existence and quality of such a tool for a given language and platform can often be the deciding factor in its use, even if another language/platform is better-suited to the task.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}. The absence of a debugger, having once been accustomed to using one, has been said to &quot;make you feel like a blind man in a dark room looking for a black cat that isn’t there&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.berniecode.com/blog/2007/03/08/how-to-debug-javascript-with-visual-web-developer-express/&lt;/ref&gt; However, software can (and often does) behave differently running under a debugger than normally, due to the inevitable changes the presence of a debugger will make to a software program's internal timing. As a result, even with a good debugging tool, it is often very difficult to track down runtime problems in complex multi-threaded or distributed systems. 

The same functionality which makes a debugger useful for eliminating bugs allows it to be used as a software cracking tool to evade copy protection, digital rights management, and other software protection features. It often also makes it useful as a general testing verification tool test coverage and performance analyzer, especially if instruction path lengths are shown.

Most current mainstream debugging engines, such as gdb and dbx provide console-based command line interfaces. Debugger front-ends are popular extensions to debugger engines that provide IDE integration, program animation, and visualization features. Some early mainframe debuggers such as IBM OLIVER (CICS interactive test/debug) and SIMON (Batch Interactive test/debug) provided this same functionality for the IBM System/360 and later operating systems, as long ago as the 1970s.

== Language dependency==
Some debuggers operate on a single specific language while others can handle multiple languages transparently. For example if the main target program is written in COBOL but CALLs Assembler subroutines and also  PL/1 subroutines, the debugger may dynamically switch modes to accommodate the changes in language as they occur.

== Memory protection ==
Some debuggers also incorporate memory protection to avoid storage violations such as buffer overflow. This may be extremely important in transaction processing environments where memory is dynamically allocated from memory 'pools' on a task by task basis.

== Hardware support for debugging ==

Most modern microprocessors have at least one of these features in their CPU design to make debugging easier:
* hardware support for single-stepping a program, such as the trap flag.
* An instruction set that meets the Popek and Goldberg virtualization requirements makes it easier to write debugger software that runs on the same CPU as the software being debugged; such a CPU can execute the inner loops of the program under test at full speed, and still remain under the control of the debugger.
* In-System Programming allows an external hardware debugger to re-program a system under test (for example, adding or removing instruction breakpoints).  Many systems with such ISP support also have other hardware debug support.
* Hardware support for code and data breakpoints, such as address comparators and data value comparators or, with considerably more work involved, page fault hardware.
* JTAG access to hardware debug interfaces such as those on ARM architecture processors or using the Nexus command set.  Processors used in embedded systems typically have extensive JTAG debug support.
* Microcontrollers with as few as six pins need to use low pin-count substitutes for JTAG, such as BDM, Spy-Bi-Wire, or DebugWire on the Atmel AVR.  DebugWire, for example, uses bidirectional signaling on the RESET pin.

==Debugger front-ends==

Some of the most capable and popular debuggers only implement a simple command line interface (CLI) — often to maximize portability and minimize resource consumption. Debugging via a graphical user interface (GUI) can be considered easier and more productive though. This is the reason for GUI debugger front-ends, that allow users to monitor and control subservient CLI-only debuggers via graphical user interface. Some GUI debugger front-ends are designed to be compatible with a variety of CLI-only debuggers, while others are targeted at one specific debugger.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Anjuta-2.0.0-2.png|thumb|300px|Anjuta, a C and C++ IDE for the GNOME environment]]

An '''integrated development environment (IDE)''' (also known as '''integrated design environment''' or '''integrated debugging environment''') is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. An IDE normally consists of: 

* a source code editor
* a compiler and/or an interpreter
* build automation tools
* a debugger

Sometimes a version control system and various tools are integrated to simplify the construction of a GUI. Many modern IDEs also have a class browser, an object inspector, and a class hierarchy diagram, for use with object-oriented software development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/tools/intro.html | title = Getting Started with an Integrated Development Environment| accessdate = 2008-09-09| author = Dana Nourie|date =2005-03-24| publisher = Sun Microsystems, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
IDEs are designed to maximize programmer productivity by providing tightly-knit components with similar user interfaces. This should mean that the programmer has to do less mode switching versus using discrete development programs.  However, because an IDE is  a complicated piece of software by its very nature, this higher productivity only occurs after a lengthy learning process.

Typically an IDE is dedicated to a specific programming language, allowing a feature set that most closely matches the programming paradigms of the language. However, there are some multiple-language IDEs, such as Eclipse, ActiveState Komodo, recent versions of NetBeans, Microsoft Visual Studio, WinDev, and Xcode.

IDEs typically present a single program in which all development is done. This program typically provides many features for authoring, modifying, compiling, deploying and debugging software.  The aim is to abstract the configuration necessary to piece together command line utilities in a cohesive unit, which theoretically reduces the time to learn a language, and increases developer productivity.  It is also thought that the tight integration of development tasks can further increase productivity. For example, code can be compiled while being written, providing instant feedback on syntax errors.  While most modern IDEs are graphical, IDEs in use before the advent of windowing systems (such as Microsoft Windows or X11) were text-based, using function keys or hotkeys to perform various tasks (Turbo Pascal is a common example). This contrasts with software development using unrelated tools, such as vi, GCC or make.

== History ==
[[Image:Emacs-screenshot.png|thumb|GNU Emacs, an extensible editor that is commonly used as an IDE on Unix-like systems]]

IDEs initially became possible when developing via a console or terminal.  Early systems could not support one, since programs were prepared using flowcharts, entering programs with punched cards (or paper tape, etc.) before submitting them to a compiler. Dartmouth BASIC was the first language to be created with an IDE (and was also the first to be designed for use while sitting in front of a console or terminal). Its IDE (part of the Dartmouth Time Sharing System) was command-based, and therefore did not look much like the menu-driven, graphical IDEs prevalent today. However it integrated editing, file management, compilation, debugging and execution in a manner consistent with a modern IDE.

[[Image:Maestro-Keyboard.jpg| thumb | left | Keyboard Maestro &lt;ref&gt;Image credit: [http://mit-a.com/fourphase.shtml Museum of Information Technology at Arlington]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Maestro I is a product from Softlab Munich and was the world's first integrated development environment&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computerwoche.de/heftarchiv/1975/47/1205421/ &quot;Interaktives Programmieren als Systems-Schlager&quot;] from ''Computerwoche'' (German)&lt;/ref&gt; 1975 for software. Maestro I was installed for 22,000 programmers worldwide. Until 1989, 6,000 installations existed in the Federal Republic of Germany. Maestro I was arguably the world leader in this field during the 1970s and 1980s. Today one of the last Maestro I can be found in the Museum of Information Technology at Arlington.

One of the first IDEs with a plug-in concept was Softbench. In 1995 Computerwoche commented that the use of an IDE was not well received by developers since it would fence in their creativity.

== Topics ==
=== Visual programming ===
Visual programming is a usage scenario in which an IDE is generally required. Visual IDEs allow users to create new applications by moving programming building blocks or code nodes to create flowcharts or structure diagrams that are then compiled or interpreted.  These flowcharts often are based on the Unified Modeling Language.

This interface has been popularized with the Lego Mindstorms system, and is being actively pursued by a number of companies wishing to capitalize on the power of custom browsers like those found at Mozilla. KTechlab supports flowcode and is a popular opensource IDE and Simulator for developing software for microcontrollers. Visual programming is also responsible for the power of distributed programming (cf. LabVIEW and EICASLAB software).  An early visual programming system, Max, was modelled after analog synthesizer design and has been used to develop real-time music performance software since the 1980s. Another early example was Prograph, a dataflow-based system originally developed for the Macintosh. The graphical programming environment &quot;Grape&quot; is used to program qfix robot kits.

This approach is also used in specialist software such as Openlab, where the end users want the flexibility of a full programming language, without the traditional learning curve associated with one.

An open source visual programming system is Mindscript, which has extended functionality for cryptology, database interfacing,

=== Language support ===
Some IDEs support multiple languages, such as Eclipse or NetBeans, both based on Java, or MonoDevelop, based on C#.

Support for alternative languages is often provided by plugins, allowing them to be installed on the same IDE at the same time. For example, Eclipse and Netbeans have plugins for C/C++, Ada, Perl, Python, Ruby, and  PHP, among other languages.

=== Attitudes across different computing platforms ===
Many Unix programmers argue that traditional command-line POSIX tools constitute an IDE,{{Who|date=February 2010}} though one with a different style of interface and under the Unix environment. Many programmers still use makefiles and their derivatives. Also, many Unix programmers use Emacs or Vim, which integrates support for many of the standard Unix build tools. Data Display Debugger is intended to be an advanced graphical front-end for many text-based debugger standard tools.

On the various Microsoft Windows platforms, command-line tools for development are seldom used. Accordingly, there are many commercial and non-commercial solutions, however each has a different design commonly creating incompatibilities. Most major compiler vendors for Windows still provide free copies of their command-line tools, including Microsoft (Visual C++, Platform SDK, Microsoft .NET Framework SDK, nmake utility), Embarcadero Technologies (bcc32 compiler, make utility).

Additionally, the free software GNU tools (gcc, gdb, GNU make) are available on many platforms, including Windows etc.

IDEs have always been popular on the Apple Macintosh's Mac OS, dating back to Macintosh Programmer's Workshop, Turbo Pascal, THINK Pascal and THINK C environments in the mid-1980s.  Currently Mac OS X programmers can choose between limited IDEs, including native IDEs like Xcode, older IDEs like CodeWarrior, and open-source tools, such as Eclipse and Netbeans. ActiveState Komodo is a proprietary IDE supported on the Mac OS.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''graphical user interface builder''' (or '''GUI builder'''), also known as '''GUI designer''', is a software development tool that simplifies the creation of GUIs by allowing the designer to arrange widgets using a drag-and-drop WYSIWYG editor. Without a GUI builder, a GUI must be built by manually specifying each widget's parameters in code, with no visual feedback until the program is run.

User interfaces are commonly programmed using an event-driven architecture, so GUI builders also simplify creating event-driven code. This supporting code connects widgets with the outgoing and incoming events that trigger the functions providing the application logic.

'''Revision control''', also known as '''version control''' or '''source control''' (and an aspect of '''software configuration management''' or SCM), is the management of changes to documents, programs, and other information stored as computer files. It is most commonly used in software development, where a team of people may change the same files. Changes are usually identified by a number or letter code, termed the &quot;revision number&quot;, &quot;revision level&quot;, or simply &quot;revision&quot;. For example, an initial set of files is &quot;revision 1&quot;. When the first change is made, the resulting set is &quot;revision 2&quot;, and so on. Each revision is associated with a timestamp and the person making the change. Revisions can be compared, restored, and with some types of files, merged.

Version control systems (VCSs – singular VCS) most commonly run as stand-alone applications, but revision control is also embedded in various types of software such as word processors (e.g., Microsoft Word, OpenOffice.org Writer, KWord, Pages, etc.), spreadsheets (e.g.,  Microsoft Excel, OpenOffice.org Calc, KSpread, Numbers, etc.), and in various content management systems (e.g., Drupal, Joomla, WordPress). Integrated revision control is a key feature of wiki software packages such as MediaWiki, DokuWiki, TWiki etc. In wikis, revision control allows for the ability to revert a page to a previous revision, which is critical for allowing editors to track each other's edits, correct mistakes, and defend public wikis against vandalism and spam.

Software tools for revision control are essential for the organization of multi-developer projects.&lt;ref&gt;

==Overview==
Revision control developed from formalized processes based on tracking revisions of early blueprints or bluelines. This system of control implicitly allowed returning to any earlier state of the design, for cases in which an engineering dead-end was reached in the development of the design. Likewise, in computer software engineering, revision control is any practice that tracks and provides control over changes to source code. Software developers sometimes use revision control software to maintain documentation and configuration files as well as source code. Also, version control is widespread in business and law.  Indeed, &quot;contract redline&quot; and &quot;legal blackline&quot; are some of the earliest forms of revision control,{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}&lt;!-- need source for &quot;earliest&quot; --&gt; and are still employed with varying degrees of sophistication.  An entire industry has emerged to service the document revision control needs of business and other users, and some of the revision control technology employed in these circles is subtle, powerful, and innovative.  The most sophisticated techniques are beginning to be used for the electronic tracking of changes to CAD files (see product data management), supplanting the &quot;manual&quot; electronic implementation of traditional revision control.

As teams design, develop and deploy software, it is common for multiple versions of the same software to be deployed in different sites and for the software's developers to be working simultaneously on updates. Bugs or features of the software are often only present in certain versions (because of the fixing of some problems and the introduction of others as the program develops). Therefore, for the purposes of locating and fixing bugs, it is vitally important to be able to retrieve and run different versions of the software to determine in which version(s) the problem occurs. It may also be necessary to develop two versions of the software concurrently (for instance, where one version has bugs fixed, but no new features (branch), while the other version is where new features are worked on (trunk).

At the simplest level, developers could simply retain multiple copies of the different versions of the program, and label them appropriately.  This simple approach has been used on many large software projects. While this method can work, it is inefficient as many near-identical copies of the program have to be maintained.  This requires a lot of self-discipline on the part of developers, and often leads to mistakes.  Consequently, systems to automate some or all of the revision control process have been developed.

Moreover, in software development, legal and business practice and other environments, it has become increasingly common for a single document or snippet of code to be edited by a team, the members of which may be geographically dispersed and may pursue different and even contrary interests.  Sophisticated revision control that tracks and accounts for ownership of changes to documents and code may be extremely helpful or even necessary in such situations.

Revision control may also track changes to configuration files, such as those typically stored in &lt;code&gt;/etc&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;/usr/local/etc&lt;/code&gt; on Unix systems. This gives system administrators another way to easily track changes made and a way to roll back to earlier versions should the need arise.

==Source-management models==
Traditional revision control systems use a centralized model where all the revision control functions take place on a shared server. If two developers try to change the same file at the same time, without some method of managing access the developers may end up overwriting each other's work. Centralized revision control systems solve this problem in one of two different &quot;source management models&quot;: file locking and version merging.

===Atomic operations===
Computer scientists speak of ''atomic'' operations if the system is left in a consistent state even if the operation is interrupted. The ''commit'' operation is usually the most critical in this sense.  Commits are operations which tell the revision control system you want to make a group of changes you have been making final and available to all users.  Not all revision control systems have atomic commits; notably, the widely-used CVS lacks this feature.

===File locking===
The simplest method of preventing &quot;concurrent access&quot; problems involves locking files so that only one developer at a time has write access to the central &quot;repository&quot; copies of those files. Once one developer &quot;checks out&quot; a file, others can read that file, but no one else may change that file until that developer &quot;checks in&quot; the updated version (or cancels the checkout).

File locking has both merits and drawbacks.  It can provide some protection against difficult merge conflicts when a user is making radical changes to many sections of a large file (or group of files).  However, if the files are left exclusively locked for too long, other developers may be tempted to bypass the revision control software and change the files locally, leading to more serious problems.

experiment

===Version merging===
Most version control systems allow multiple developers to edit the same file at the same time. The first developer to &quot;check in&quot; changes to the central repository always succeeds. The system may provide facilities to merge further changes into the central repository, and preserve the changes from the first developer when other developers check in.

Merging two files can be a very delicate operation, and usually possible only if the data structure is simple, as in text files. The result of a merge of two image files might not result in an image file at all. The second developer checking in code will need to take care with the merge, to make sure that the changes are compatible and that the merge operation does not introduce its own logic errors within the files. These problems limit the availability of automatic or semi-automatic merge operations mainly to simple text based documents, unless a specific merge plugin is available for the file types.

The concept of a ''reserved edit'' can provide an optional means to explicitly lock a file for exclusive write access, even when a merging capability exists.

===Baselines, labels and tags===
Most revision control tools will use only one of these similar terms (baseline, label, tag) to refer to the action of identifying a snapshot (&quot;label the project&quot;) or the record of the snapshot (&quot;try it with baseline ''X''&quot;).  Typically only one of the terms ''baseline'', ''label'', or ''tag'' is used in documentation or discussion{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}; they can be considered synonyms.

In most projects some snapshots are more significant than others, such as those used to indicate published releases, branches, or milestones.

When both the term ''baseline'' and either of ''label'' or ''tag'' are used together in the same context, ''label'' and ''tag'' usually refer to the mechanism within the tool of identifying or making the record of the snapshot, and ''baseline'' indicates the increased significance of any given label or tag.

Most formal discussion of configuration management uses the term ''baseline''.

==Distributed revision control==
Distributed revision control (DRCS) takes a peer-to-peer approach, as opposed to the client-server approach of centralized systems. Rather than a single, central repository on which clients synchronize, each peer's working copy of the codebase is a bona-fide repository.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | url = http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/scm.html
  | accessdate = May 8, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Distributed revision control conducts synchronization by exchanging patches (change-sets) from peer to peer. This results in some important differences from a centralized system:

* No canonical, reference copy of the codebase exists by default; only working copies.
* Common operations (such as commits, viewing history, and reverting changes) are fast, because there is no need to communicate with a central server.&lt;ref name='OSullivan'&gt;{{cite web

  | url = http://hgbook.red-bean.com/hgbook.html
  | accessdate = July 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Rather, communication is only necessary when pushing or pulling changes to or from other peers.
* Each working copy effectively functions as a remote backup of the codebase and of its change-history, providing natural protection against data loss.&lt;ref name='OSullivan'/&gt;

==Integration==
Some of the more advanced revision-control tools offer many other facilities, allowing deeper integration with other tools and software-engineering processes. Plugins are often available for IDEs such as Oracle JDeveloper, IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse and Visual Studio. NetBeans IDE and Xcode come with integrated version control support.

==Common vocabulary==
Terminology can vary from system to system, but some terms in common usage include:&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

; Baseline : An approved revision of a document or source file from which subsequent changes can be made.  See baselines, labels and tags.
; Branch : A set of files under version control may be '''branched''' or '''forked''' at a point in time so that, from that time forward, two copies of those files may develop at different speeds or in different ways independently of each other.
; Change : A '''change''' (or '''diff''', or '''delta''') represents a specific modification to a document under version control.  The granularity of the modification considered a change varies between version control systems.
; Change list : On many version control systems with atomic multi-change commits, a '''changelist''', '''change set''', or '''patch''' identifies the set of '''changes''' made in a single commit.  This can also represent a sequential view of the source code, allowing the examination of source &quot;as of&quot; any particular changelist ID.
; Checkout : A '''check-out''' (or '''co''') is the act of creating a local working copy from the repository. A user may specify a specific revision or obtain the latest. The term 'checkout' can also used as a noun to describe the working copy.
; Commit : A '''commit''' ('''checkin''', '''ci''' or, more rarely, '''install''', '''submit''' or '''record''') is the action of writing or merging the changes made in the working copy back to the repository. The terms 'commit' and 'checkin' can also used in noun form to describe the new revision that is created as a result of committing.
; Conflict : A conflict occurs when different parties make changes to the same document, and the system is unable to reconcile the changes.  A user must '''resolve''' the conflict by combining the changes, or by selecting one change in favour of the other.
; Delta compression : Most revision control software uses delta compression, which retains only the differences between successive versions of files.  This allows for more efficient storage of many different versions of files.
; Dynamic stream : A stream in which some or all file versions are mirrors of the parent stream's versions.
; Export : '''exporting''' is the act of obtaining the files from the repository. It is similar to '''checking-out''' except that it creates a clean directory tree without the version-control metadata used in a working copy. This is often used prior to publishing the contents, for example.
; Head: Also sometime called '''tip''', this refers to the most recent commit.
; Import : '''importing''' is the act of copying a local directory tree (that is not currently a working copy) into the repository for the first time.
; Label : See '''tag'''.
; Mainline : Similar to ''trunk'', but there can be a mainline for each branch.
; Merge : A '''merge''' or '''integration''' is an operation in which two sets of changes are applied to a file or set of files. Some sample scenarios are as follows:
:* A user, working on a set of files, '''updates''' or '''syncs''' their working copy with changes made, and checked into the repository, by other users.&lt;ref name=&quot;svnbook-merge&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Collins-Sussman|first=Ben|title=Version Control with Subversion|url=http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.5/svn.tour.cycle.html#svn.tour.cycle.resolve|accessdate=8 June 2010|coauthors=Brian W. Fitpatrick, and C. Michael Pilato|quote=The G  stands for merGed, which means that the file had local changes to begin with, but the changes coming from the repository didn't overlap with the local changes.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:* A user tries to '''check-in''' files that have been updated by others since the files were '''checked out''', and the '''revision control software''' automatically merges the files (typically, after prompting the user if it should proceed with the automatic merge, and in some cases only doing so if the merge can be clearly and reasonably resolved).
:* A set of files is '''branched''', a problem that existed before the branching is fixed in one branch, and the fix is then merged into the other branch.
:* A '''branch''' is created, the code in the files is independently edited, and the updated branch is later incorporated into a single, unified '''trunk'''.
; Promote : The act of copying file content from a less controlled location into a more controlled location. For example, from a user's workspace into a repository,  or from a stream to its parent.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
  | title = Accurev Concepts Manual, Version 4.7
  | publisher = Accurev, Inc.
  | date = July, 2008
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
; Repository : The '''repository''' is where files' current and historical data are stored, often on a server. Sometimes also called a '''depot''' (for example, by SVK, AccuRev and Perforce).
; Resolve : The act of user intervention to address a conflict between different changes to the same document.
; Reverse integration : The process of merging different team branches into the main trunk of the versioning system.
; Revision : Also '''version''': A version is any change in form.  In SVK, a Revision is the state at a point in time of the entire tree in the repository.
; Ring: {{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} See '''tag'''.
; Share: The act of making one file or folder available in multiple branches at the same time. When a shared file is changed in one branch, it is changed in other branches.
; Stream : A container for branched files that has a known relationship to other such containers. Streams form a hierarchy; each stream can inherit various properties (like versions, namespace, workflow rules, subscribers, etc.) from its parent stream.
; Tag : A '''tag''' or '''label''' refers to an important snapshot in time, consistent across many files.  These files at that point may all be tagged with a user-friendly, meaningful name or revision number.  See baselines, labels and tags.
; Trunk: The unique line of development that is not a branch (sometimes also called Baseline or Mainline)
; Update : An '''update''' (or '''sync''') merges changes made in the repository (by other people, for example) into the local '''working copy'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;svnbook-merge&quot;/&gt;
; Working copy: The '''working copy''' is the local copy of files from a repository, at a specific time or revision. All work done to the files in a repository is initially done on a working copy, hence the name. Conceptually, it is a ''sandbox''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Build automation''' is the act of scripting or automating a wide variety of tasks that software developers do in their day-to-day activities including things like:
* compiling computer source code into binary code
* packaging binary code
* running tests
* deployment to production systems
* creating documentation and/or release notes

==History==
Historically, developers used build automation to call compilers and linkers from inside a build script versus attempting to make the compiler calls from the command line.  It is simple to use the command line to pass a single source module to a compiler and then to a linker to create the final deployable object.  However, when attempting to compile and link many source code modules, in a particular order, using the command line process is not a reasonable solution.  The make scripting language offered a better alternative. It allowed a build script to be written to call in a series, the needed compile and link steps to build a software application.  GNU Make &lt;ref&gt;http://www.gnu.org/software/make/&lt;/ref&gt; also offered additional features such as &quot;makedepend&quot; which allowed some source code dependency management as well as incremental build processing. This was the beginning of Build Automation.  Its primary focus was on automating the calls to the compilers and linkers.  As the build process grew more complex, developers began adding pre and post actions around the calls to the compilers such as a check-out from version control to the copying of deployable objects to a test location.  The term &quot;build automation&quot; now includes managing the pre and post compile and link activities as well as the compile and link activities.

==New breed of solutions==

In recent years, build management solutions have provided even more relief when it comes to automating the build process.  Both commercial and open source solutions are available to perform more automated build and workflow processing.  Some solutions focus on automating the pre and post steps around the calling of the build scripts, while others go beyond the pre and post build script processing and drive down into streamlining the actual compile and linker calls without much manual scripting.  These tools are particularly useful for continuous integration builds where frequent calls to the compile process are required and incremental build processing is needed.

==Advanced build automation==

Advanced build automation offers remote agent processing for distributed builds and/or distributed processing.  The term &quot;distributed builds&quot; means that the actual calls to the compiler and linkers can be served out to multiple locations for improving the speed of the build.  This term is often confused with &quot;distributed processing&quot;.  Distributed processing means that each step in a process or workflow can be sent to a different machine for execution. For example, a post step to the build may require the execution of multiple test scripts on multiple machines.  Distributed processing can send the different test scripts to different machines.  Distributed processing is not distributed builds.  Distributed processing cannot take a make, ant or maven script, break it up and send it to different machines for compiling and linking.  The distributed build process must have the machine intelligence to understand the source code dependencies in order to send the different compile and link steps to different machines.  A build automation solution must be able to manage these dependencies in order to perform distributed builds.  Some build tools can discover these relationships programmatically (Rational ClearMake distributed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=http://www.ddj.com/architect/184405385|accessdate=2009-04-13|title=Dr. Dobb's Distributed Loadbuilds}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Electric Cloud ElectricAccelerator&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=http://www.ddj.com/architect/184415472|title=Dr. Dobb's Take My Build, Please}}&lt;/ref&gt;), while others depend on user-configured dependencies (Platform LSF lsmake&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=http://www.lle.rochester.edu/pub/support/lsf/10-lsmake.html|accessdate=2009-04-13|title=LSF User's Guide - Using lsmake}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Build automation that can sort out source code dependency relationships can also be configured to run the compile and link activities in a parallelized mode.  This means that the compiler and linkers can be called in multi-threaded mode using a machine that is configured with more than one core.

Not all build automation tools can perform distributed builds. Most only provide distributed processing support. In addition, most solutions that do support distributed builds can only handle C or C++. Build automation solutions that support distributed processing are often make based and many do not support Maven or Ant.

An example of a distributed build solution is Xoreax's IncrediBuild&lt;ref&gt;{{cite
|url=http://www.xoreax.com/solutions_vs.htm
|accessdate=2009-04-08
|title=Distributed Visual Studio Builds
}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--commercial but not blatant advertising --&gt;
for the Microsoft Visual Studio platform or the open-source  CMake&lt;ref&gt;{{cite
|url=http://www.cmake.org/
|accessdate=2010-03-27
|title=CMake - Cross platform make
}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These may require particular configurations of a product environment so that it can run successfully on a distributed platform—library locations, environment variables, and so forth.

==Advantages==
* Improve product quality
* Accelerate the compile and link processing
* Eliminate redundant tasks
* Minimize &quot;bad builds&quot;
* Eliminate dependencies on key personnel
* Have history of builds and releases in order to investigate issues
* Save time and money - because of the reasons listed above.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.denverjug.org/meetings/files/200410_automation.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
* '''On-Demand automation''' such as a user running a script at the command line
* '''Scheduled automation''' such as a continuous integration server running a nightly build
* '''Triggered automation''' such as a continuous integration server running a build on every commit to a version control system.

==Makefile==

One specific form of build automation is the automatic generation of Makefiles. This is accomplished by tools like
* GNU Automake
* CMake
* imake
* qmake
* nmake
* wmake
* Apache Ant
* Apache Maven
* OpenMake Meister

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Software documentation''' or '''source code documentation''' is written text that accompanies computer software.  It either explains how it operates or how to use it, and may mean different things to people in different roles.

== Involvement of people in software life==
Documentation is an important part of software engineering. Types of documentation include:

# Requirements - Statements that identify attributes, capabilities, characteristics, or qualities of a system.  This is the foundation for what shall be or has been implemented.
# Architecture/Design - Overview of softwares. Includes relations to an environment and construction principles to be used in design of software components. 
# Technical - Documentation of code, algorithms, interfaces, and APIs.
# End User - Manuals for the end-user, system administrators and support staff.
# Marketing - How to market the product and analysis of the market demand.

=== Requirements documentation ===
Requirements documentation is the description of what a particular software does or shall do. It is used throughout development to communicate what the software does or shall do. It is also used as an agreement or as the foundation for agreement on what the software shall do. Requirements are produced and consumed by everyone involved in the production of software: end users, customers, product managers, project managers, sales, marketing, software architects, usability engineers, interaction designers, developers, and testers, to name a few. Thus, requirements documentation has many different purposes.

Requirements come in a variety of styles, notations and formality. Requirements can be goal-like (e.g., ''distributed work environment''), close to design (e.g., ''builds can be started by right-clicking a configuration file and select the 'build' function''), and anything in between. They can be specified as statements in natural language, as drawn figures, as detailed mathematical formulas, and as a combination of them all.

The variation and complexity of requirements documentation makes it a proven challenge. Requirements may be implicit and hard to uncover. It is difficult to know exactly how much and what kind of documentation is needed and how much can be left to the architecture and design documentation, and it is difficult to know how to document requirements considering the variety of people that shall read and use the documentation. Thus, requirements documentation is often incomplete (or non-existent). Without proper requirements documentation, software changes become more difficult—and therefore more error prone (decreased software quality) and time-consuming (expensive).

The need for requirements documentation is typically related to the complexity of the product, the impact of the product, and the life expectancy of the software. If the software is very complex or developed by many people (e.g., mobile phone software), requirements can help to better communicate what to achieve. If the software is safety-critical and can have negative impact on human life (e.g., nuclear power systems, medical equipment), more formal requirements documentation is often required. If the software is expected to live for only a month or two (e.g., very small mobile phone applications developed specifically for a certain campaign) very little requirements documentation may be needed. If the software is a first release that is later built upon, requirements documentation is very helpful when managing the change of the software and verifying that nothing has been broken in the software when it is modified.

Traditionally, requirements are specified in requirements documents (e.g. using word processing applications and spreadsheet applications). To manage the increased complexity and changing nature of requirements documentation (and software documentation in general), database-centric systems and special-purpose requirements management tools are advocated.

=== Architecture/Design documentation ===
Architecture documentation is a special breed of design document. In a way, architecture documents are third derivative from the code (design document being second derivative, and code documents being first). Very little in the architecture documents is specific to the code itself. These documents do not describe how to program a particular routine, or even why that particular routine exists in the form that it does, but instead merely lays out the general requirements that would motivate the existence of such a routine. A good architecture document is short on details but thick on explanation. It may suggest approaches for lower level design, but leave the actual exploration trade studies to other documents.

Another breed of design docs is the comparison document, or trade study. This would often take the form of a ''whitepaper''. It focuses on one specific aspect of the system and suggests alternate approaches. It could be at the user interface, code, design, or even architectural level. It will outline what the situation is, describe one or more alternatives, and enumerate the pros and cons of each. A good trade study document is heavy on research, expresses its idea clearly (without relying heavily on obtuse jargon to dazzle the reader), and most importantly is impartial. It should honestly and clearly explain the costs of whatever solution it offers as best. The objective of a trade study is to devise the best solution, rather than to push a particular point of view. It is perfectly acceptable to state no conclusion, or to conclude that none of the alternatives are sufficiently better than the baseline to warrant a change. It should be approached as a scientific endeavor, not as a marketing technique.

A very important part of the design document in enterprise software development is the Database Design Document (DDD). It contains Conceptual, Logical, and Physical Design Elements. The DDD includes the formal information that the people who interact with the database need. The purpose of preparing it is to create a common source to be used by all players within the scene. The potential users are:
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Database Designer
&lt;li&gt;Database Developer
&lt;li&gt;Database Administrator
&lt;li&gt;Application Designer
&lt;li&gt;Application Developer
&lt;/ul&gt;

When talking about Relational Database Systems, the document should include following parts:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Entity - Relationship Schema, including following information and their clear definitions:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Entity Sets and their attributes
&lt;li&gt;Relationships and their attributes
&lt;li&gt;Candidate keys for each entity set
&lt;li&gt;Attribute and Tuple based constraints
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Relational Schema, including following information:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tables, Attributes, and their properties
&lt;li&gt;Views
&lt;li&gt;Constraints such as primary keys, foreign keys, 
&lt;li&gt;Cardinality of referential constraints
&lt;li&gt;Cascading Policy for referential constraints
&lt;li&gt;Primary keys
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

It is very important to include all information that is to be used by all actors in the scene. It is also very important to update the documents as any change occurs in the database as well.

=== Technical documentation ===
This is what most programmers mean when using the term ''software documentation''. When creating software, code alone is insufficient. There must be some text along with it to describe various aspects of its intended operation.  It is important for the code documents to be thorough, but not so verbose that it becomes difficult to maintain them. Several How-to and overview documentation are found specific to the software application or software product being documented by API Writers. This documentation may be used by developers, testers and also the end customers or clients using this software application. Today, we see lot of high end applications in the field of power, energy, transportation, networks, aerospace, safety, security, industry automation and a variety of other domains. Technical documentation has become important within such organizations as the basic and advanced level of information may change over a period of time with architecture changes. Hence, technical documentation has gained lot of importance in recent times, especially in the software field.

Often, tools such as Doxygen, NDoc, javadoc, EiffelStudio, Sandcastle, ROBODoc, POD, TwinText, or Universal Report can be used to auto-generate the code documents&amp;mdash;that is, they extract the comments and software contracts, where available, from the source code and create reference manuals in such forms as text or HTML files. Code documents are often organized into a ''reference guide'' style, allowing a programmer to quickly look up an arbitrary function or class.

The idea of auto-generating documentation is attractive to programmers for various reasons.  For example, because it is extracted from the source code itself (for example, through comments), the programmer can write it while referring to the code, and use the same tools used to create the source code to make the documentation.  This makes it much easier to keep the documentation up-to-date.

Of course, a downside is that only programmers can edit this kind of documentation, and it depends on them to refresh the output (for example, by running a cron job to update the documents nightly). Some would characterize this as a pro rather than a con.

Donald Knuth has insisted on the fact that documentation can be a very difficult afterthought process and has advocated literate programming, writing at the same time and location as the source code and extracted by automatic means.

Elucidative Programming is the result of practical applications of Literate Programming in real programming contexts.
The Elucidative paradigm proposes that source code and documentation be stored separately.
This paradigm was inspired by the same experimental findings that produced [http://kelp.sf.net/ Kelp].
Often, software developers need to be able to create and access information that is not going to be part of the source file itself. Such annotations are usually part of several software development activities, such as code walks and porting, where third party source code is analysed in a functional way. Annotations can therefore help the developer during any stage of software development where a formal documentation system would hinder progress.
[http://kelp.sf.net/ Kelp] stores annotations in separate files, linking the information to the source code dynamically.

=== User documentation ===
Unlike code documents, user documents are usually far more diverse with respect to the source code of the program, and instead simply describe how it is used.  

In the case of a software library, the code documents and user documents could be effectively equivalent and are worth conjoining, but for a general application this is not often true. 

Typically, the user documentation describes each feature of the program, and assists the user in realizing these features.  A good user document can also go so far as to provide thorough troubleshooting assistance.  It is very important for user documents to not be confusing, and for them to be up to date.  User documents need not be organized in any particular way, but it is very important for them to have a thorough index. Consistency and simplicity are also very valuable. User documentation is considered to constitute a contract specifying what the software will do. API Writers are very well accomplished towards writing good user documents as they would be well aware of the software architecture and programming techniques used. See also Technical Writing.

There are three broad ways in which user documentation can be organized. 
# '''Tutorial:''' A tutorial approach is considered the most useful for a new user, in which they are guided through each step of accomplishing particular tasks &lt;ref name=kdp&gt;{{cite web
  | last = Woelz 
  | first = Carlos

  | date = 
  | url = http://i18n.kde.org/docs/doc-primer/index.html
  | doi =
  | accessdate = 15 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. 
# '''Thematic:''' A thematic approach, where chapters or sections concentrate on one particular area of interest, is of more general use to an intermediate user.  Some authors prefer to convey their ideas through a knowledge based article to facilitating the user needs.  This approach is usually practiced by a dynamic industry, such as Information technology, where the user population is largely correlated with the troubleshooting demands &lt;ref name=kbad&gt;{{cite web

  | url = http://www.adobe.com/devnet/air/flex/articles/flex_air_codebase.html
  | doi =
  | accessdate = 15 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.
# '''List or Reference:''' The final type of organizing principle is one in which commands or tasks are simply listed alphabetically or logically grouped, often via cross-referenced indexes. This latter approach is of greater use to advanced users who know exactly what sort of information they are looking for.

A common complaint among users regarding software documentation is that only one of these three approaches was taken to the near-exclusion of the other two. It is common to limit provided software documentation for personal computers to online help that give only reference information on commands or menu items.  The job of tutoring new users or helping more experienced users get the most out of a program is left to private publishers, who are often given significant assistance by the software developer.

=== Marketing documentation ===
For many applications it is necessary to have some promotional materials to encourage casual observers to spend more time learning about the product.  This form of documentation has three purposes:-

#To excite the potential user about the product and instill in them a desire for becoming more involved with it.
#To inform them about what exactly the product does, so that their expectations are in line with what they will be receiving.
#To explain the position of this product with respect to other alternatives.  

One good marketing technique is to provide clear and memorable ''catch phrases'' that exemplify the point we wish to convey, and also emphasize the interoperability of the program with anything else provided by the manufacturer.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In software engineering, '''program profiling''', '''software profiling''' or simply '''profiling''', a form of dynamic program analysis (as opposed to static code analysis), is the investigation of a program's behavior using information gathered as the program executes. The usual purpose of this analysis is to determine which sections of a program to optimize - to increase its overall speed, decrease its memory requirement or sometimes both. 

* A '''(code) profiler''' is a '''performance analysis''' tool that, most commonly, measures only the frequency and duration of function calls, but there are other specific types of profilers (e.g. memory profilers&lt;!--plenty of hist on gbooks for this--&gt;) in addition to more comprehensive profilers, capable of gathering extensive performance data.
* An instruction set simulator which is also &amp;mdash; by necessity &amp;mdash; a profiler, can measure the totality of a program's behaviour from invocation to termination.

== Gathering program events ==
Profilers use a wide variety of techniques to collect data, including hardware interrupts, code instrumentation, instruction set simulation, operating system hooks, and performance counters. The usage of profilers is 'called out' in the performance engineering process.

== Use of profilers ==
''Program analysis tools are extremely important for understanding program behavior. Computer architects need such tools to evaluate how well programs will perform on new architectures. Software writers need tools to analyze their programs and identify critical sections of code. Compiler writers often use such tools to find out how well their instruction scheduling or branch prediction algorithm is performing...'' (ATOM, PLDI, '94)

The output of a profiler may be:- 

* A statistical ''summary'' of the events observed (a '''profile''')
:Summary profile information is often shown annotated against the source code statements where the events occur, so the size of measurement data is linear to the code size of the program.
:&lt;code&gt;
 /* ------------ source------------------------- count */             
 0001             IF X = &quot;A&quot;                     0055
 0002                THEN DO                       
 0003                  ADD 1 to XCOUNT           0032
 0004                ELSE
 0005             IF X = &quot;B&quot;                     0055
&lt;/code&gt;
* A stream of recorded events (a '''trace''')
:For sequential programs, a summary profile is usually sufficient, but performance problems in parallel programs (waiting for messages or synchronization issues) often depend on the time relationship of events, thus requiring a full trace to get an understanding of what is happening.
: The size of a (full) trace is linear to the program's instruction path length, making it somewhat impractical. A trace may therefore be initiated at one point in a program and terminated at another point to limit the output.
* An ongoing interaction with the hypervisor (continuous or periodic monitoring via on-screen display for instance)
: This provides the opportunity to switch a trace on or off at any desired point during execution in addition to viewing on-going metrics about the (still executing) program. It also provides the opportunity to suspend asynchronous processes at critical points to examine interactions with other parallel processes in more detail.

==History==
Performance analysis tools existed on IBM/360 and IBM/370 platforms from the early 1970s, usually based on timer interrupts which recorded the Program status word (PSW) at set timer intervals to detect &quot;hot spots&quot; in executing code. This was an early example of sampling (see below). In early 1974, Instruction Set Simulators permitted full trace and other performance monitoring features.

Profiler-driven program analysis on Unix dates back to at least 1979, when Unix systems included a basic tool &quot;prof&quot; that listed each function and how much of program execution time it used. In 1982, gprof extended the concept to a complete call graph analysis &lt;ref&gt;[http://docs.freebsd.org/44doc/psd/18.gprof/paper.pdf ''gprof: a Call Graph Execution Profiler'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Amitabh Srivastava and Alan Eustace of Digital Equipment Corporation published a paper describing ATOM.&lt;ref&gt;[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.119.8540 Atom: A system for building customized program analysis tools,  Amitabh Srivastava and Alan Eustace, 1994] ([http://www.ece.cmu.edu/~ece548/tools/atom/man/wrl_94_2.pdf download])&lt;/ref&gt; ATOM is a platform for converting a program into its own profiler. That is, at compile time, it inserts code into the program to be analyzed. That inserted code outputs analysis data. This technique - modifying a program to analyze itself - is known as &quot;instrumentation&quot;.

In 2004, both the gprof and ATOM papers appeared on the list of the 50 most influential PLDI papers of all time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/mckinley/20-years.html 20 Years of PLDI (1979 - 1999): A Selection, Kathryn S. McKinley, Editor]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Profiler types based on output ==
===Flat profiler ===
Flat profilers compute the average call times, from the calls, and do not break down the call times based on the callee or the context.

===Call-graph profiler===
Call graph profilers show the call times, and frequencies of the functions, and also the call-chains involved based on the callee. However context is not preserved.

==Methods of data gathering==
===Event-based profilers===
The programming languages listed here have event-based profilers:
* Java: the JVMTI (JVM Tools Interface) API, formerly JVMPI (JVM Profiling Interface), provides hooks to profilers, for trapping events like calls, class-load, unload, thread enter leave.
* .NET: Can attach a profiling agent as a COM server to the CLR. Like Java, the runtime then provides various callbacks into the agent, for trapping events like method JIT / enter / leave, object creation, etc. Particularly powerful in that the profiling agent can rewrite the target application's bytecode in arbitrary ways.
* Python: Python profiling includes the profile module, hotshot (which is call-graph based), and using the 'sys.setprofile' function to trap events like c_{call,return,exception}, python_{call,return,exception}.
* Ruby: Ruby also uses a similar interface like Python for profiling. Flat-profiler in profile.rb, module, and ruby-prof a C-extension are present.

===Statistical profilers===
Some profilers operate by sampling. A sampling profiler probes the target program's program counter at regular intervals using operating system interrupts. Sampling profiles are typically less numerically accurate and specific, but allow the target program to run at near full speed. 

The resulting data are not exact, but a statistical approximation. ''The actual amount of error is usually more than one sampling period. In fact, if a value is n times the sampling period, the expected error in it is the square-root of n sampling periods.'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://lgl.epfl.ch/teaching/case_tools/doc/gprof/gprof_12.html Statistical Inaccuracy of &lt;tt&gt;gprof&lt;/tt&gt; Output]&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, sampling profilers can often provide a more accurate picture of the target program's execution than other approaches, as they are not as intrusive to the target program, and thus don't have as many side effects (such as on memory caches or instruction decoding pipelines). Also since they don't affect the execution speed as much, they can detect issues that would otherwise be hidden. They are also relatively immune to over-evaluating the cost of small, frequently called routines or 'tight' loops. They can show the relative amount of time spent in user mode versus interruptible kernel mode such as system call processing.

Still, kernel code to handle the interrupts entails a minor loss of CPU cycles, diverted cache usage, and is unable to distinguish the various tasks occurring in uninterruptible kernel code (microsecond-range activity).

Dedicated hardware can go beyond this: some recent MIPS processors JTAG interface have a PCSAMPLE register, which samples the program counter in a truly undetectable manner. 

Some of the most commonly used statistical profilers are AMD CodeAnalyst, Apple Inc. Shark, gprof, Intel VTune and Parallel Amplifier (part of Intel Parallel Studio).

===Instrumenting profilers===
Some profilers '''instrument''' the target program with additional instructions to collect the required information. 

Instrumenting the program can cause changes in the performance of the program, potentially causing inaccurate results and heisenbugs. Instrumenting will always have some impact on the program execution, typically always slowing it. However, instrumentation can be very specific and be carefully controlled to have a minimal impact. The impact on a particular program depends on the placement of instrumentation points and the mechanism used to capture the trace. Hardware support for trace capture means that on some targets, instrumentation can be on just one machine instruction. The impact of instrumentation can often be deducted (i.e. eliminated by subtraction) from the results.

gprof is an example of a profiler that uses both instrumentation and sampling. Instrumentation is used to gather caller information and the actual timing values are obtained by statistical sampling.

===Instrumentation ===
* '''Manual''': Performed by the programmer, e.g. by adding instructions to explicitly calculate runtimes, simply count events or calls to measurement APIs such as the Application Response Measurement standard.
* '''Automatic source level''': instrumentation added to the source code by an automatic tool according to an instrumentation policy.
* '''Compiler assisted''': Example: &quot;gcc -pg ...&quot; for gprof, &quot;quantify g++ ...&quot; for Quantify
* '''Binary translation''': The tool adds instrumentation to a compiled binary. Example: ATOM
* '''Runtime instrumentation''': Directly before execution the code is instrumented. The program run is fully supervised and controlled by the tool. Examples: Pin, Valgrind
* '''Runtime injection''': More lightweight than runtime instrumentation. Code is modified at runtime to have jumps to helper functions. Example: DynInst

===Interpreter instrumentation===
* '''Interpreter debug''' options can enable the collection of performance metrics as the interpreter encounters each target statement. A bytecode, control table or JIT interpreters are three examples that usually have complete control over execution of the target code, thus enabling extremely comprehensive data collection opportunities.

===Hypervisor/Simulator===
* '''Hypervisor''': Data are collected by running the (usually) unmodified program under a hypervisor. Example: SIMMON
* '''Simulator''' and '''Hypervisor''': Data collected interactively and selectively by running the unmodified program under an Instruction Set Simulator. Examples: SIMON (Batch Interactive test/debug) and IBM OLIVER (CICS interactive test/debug).

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Code coverage''' is a measure used in software testing.  It describes the degree to which the source code of a program has been tested.  It is a form of testing that inspects the code directly and is therefore a form of white box testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kolawa | first = Adam | coauthors = Huizinga, Dorota | title = Automated Defect Prevention: Best Practices in Software Management |  url = http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470042125.html | year = 2007 | publisher = Wiley-IEEE Computer Society Press | location =| page=254| pages =426 | isbn = 0470042125 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In time, the use of code coverage has been extended to the field of digital hardware, the contemporary design methodology of which relies on hardware description languages (HDLs).

Code coverage was among the first methods invented for systematic software testing.  The first published reference was by Miller and Maloney in ''Communications of the ACM'' in 1963.

Code coverage is one consideration in the safety certification of avionics equipment.  The standard by which avionics gear is certified by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is documented in DO-178B.&lt;ref&gt;RTCA/DO-178(b), ''Software Considerations in Airborne Systems and Equipment Certification, Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics,'' December 1, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coverage criteria==
To measure how well the program is exercised by a test suite, one or more ''coverage criteria'' are used. 

=== Basic coverage criteria ===
There are a number of  coverage criteria, the main ones being:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Glenford J. Myers | title=The Art of Software Testing, 2nd edition |publisher=Wiley | year=2004| id=ISBN 0471469122}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Function coverage''' - Has each function (or subroutine) in the program been called?
* '''Statement coverage''' - Has each node in the program been executed?
* '''Decision coverage''' (not the same as '''branch coverage''' - see Position Paper CAST10.&lt;ref name =&quot;Position Paper CAST10&quot;&gt; [http://www.faa.gov/aircraft/air_cert/design_approvals/air_software/cast/cast_papers/media/cast-10.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;) - Has every edge in the program been executed?  For instance, have the requirements of each branch of each control structure (such as in IF and CASE statements) been met as well as not met?
* '''Condition coverage''' (or predicate coverage) - Has each boolean sub-expression evaluated both to true and false? This does not necessarily imply decision coverage.
* '''Condition/decision coverage''' - Both decision and condition coverage should be satisfied.

For example, consider the following C++ function:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
int foo(int x, int y)
{
    int z = 0;
    if ((x&gt;0) &amp;&amp; (y&gt;0)) {
        z = x;
    }
    return z;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Assume this function is a part of some bigger program and this program was run with some test suite. 
* If during this execution function 'foo' was called at least once, then ''function coverage'' for this function is satisfied. 
* ''Statement coverage'' for this function will be satisfied if it was called e.g. as &lt;code&gt;foo(1,1)&lt;/code&gt;, as in this case, every line in the function is executed including &lt;code&gt;z = x;&lt;/code&gt;.
* Tests calling &lt;code&gt;foo(1,1)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;foo(1,0)&lt;/code&gt; will satisfy ''decision coverage'', as in the first case the &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; condition is satisfied and &lt;code&gt;z = x;&lt;/code&gt; is executed, and in the second it is not. 
* ''Condition coverage'' can be satisfied with tests that call &lt;code&gt;foo(1,1)&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;foo(1,0)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;foo(0,0)&lt;/code&gt;. These are necessary as in the first two cases &lt;code&gt;(x&gt;0)&lt;/code&gt; evaluates to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; while in the third it evaluates &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;. At the same time, the first case makes &lt;code&gt;(y&gt;0)&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; while the second and third make it &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;.

In languages, like Pascal, where standard boolean operations are not short circuited, condition coverage does not necessarily imply decision coverage. For example, consider the following fragment of code:
&lt;source lang=&quot;pascal&quot;&gt;
if a and b then
&lt;/source&gt;
Condition coverage can be satisfied by two tests:
* &lt;code&gt;a=true&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;b=false&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;a=false&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;b=true&lt;/code&gt;
However, this set of tests does not satisfy decision coverage as in neither case will the &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; condition be met.

Fault injection may be necessary to ensure that all conditions and branches of exception handling code have adequate coverage during testing.

=== Modified condition/decision coverage ===
For safety-critical applications (e.g. for avionics software) it is often required that '''modified condition/decision coverage (MC/DC)''' is satisifed. This criteria extends condition/decision criteria with requirements that each condition should affect the decision outcome independently. For example, consider the following code:
&lt;source lang=&quot;pascal&quot;&gt;
if (a or b) and c then
&lt;/source&gt;
The condition/decision criteria will be satisfied by the following set of tests:
* a=true, b=true, c=true
* a=false, b=false, c=false
However, the above tests set will not satisfy modified condition/decision coverage, since in the first test, the value of 'b' and in the second test the value of 'c' would not influence the output. So, the following test set is needed to satisfy MC/DC:
* a='''false''', b='''false''', c=true
* a='''true''',  b=false, c='''true'''
* a=false, b='''true''',  c='''true'''
* a=true,  b=true,  c='''false'''
The bold values influence the output, each variable must be present as an influencing value at least once with false and once with true.

=== Multiple condition coverage ===
This criteria requires that all combinations of conditions inside each decision are tested. For example, the code fragment from the previous section will require eight tests:
* a=false, b=false, c=false
* a=false, b=false, c=true
* a=false, b=true, c=false
* a=false, b=true, c=true
* a=true, b=false, c=false
* a=true, b=false, c=true
* a=true, b=true, c=false
* a=true, b=true, c=true

=== Other coverage criteria ===
There are further coverage criteria, which are used less often:
* '''Linear Code Sequence and Jump (LCSAJ) coverage''' - has every LCSAJ been executed?
* '''JJ-Path coverage''' - have all jump to jump paths &lt;ref name=&quot;On the relationship between two control-flow coverage criteria: all JJ-paths and MCDC&quot;&gt;M. R. Woodward, M. A. Hennell, &quot;On the relationship between two control-flow coverage criteria: all JJ-paths and MCDC&quot;, Information and Software Technology 48 (2006) pp. 433-440&lt;/ref&gt; (aka LCSAJs) been executed?
* '''Path coverage''' - Has every possible route through a given part of the code been executed?
* '''Entry/exit coverage''' - Has every possible call and return of the function been executed?
* '''Loop coverage''' - Has every possible loop been executed zero times, once, and more than once?

Safety-critical applications are often required to demonstrate that testing achieves 100% of some form of code coverage.

Some of the coverage criteria above are connected. For instance, path coverage implies decision, statement and entry/exit coverage. Decision coverage implies statement coverage, because every statement is part of a branch.

Full path coverage, of the type described above, is usually impractical or impossible. Any module with a succession of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; decisions in it can have up to &lt;math&gt;2^n&lt;/math&gt; paths within it; loop constructs can result in an infinite number of paths.  Many paths may also be infeasible, in that there is no input to the program under test that can cause that particular path to be executed.  However, a general-purpose algorithm for identifying infeasible paths has been proven to be impossible (such an algorithm could be used to solve the halting problem).&lt;ref&gt;Dorf, Richard C.: ''Computers, Software Engineering, and Digital Devices'', Chapter 12, pg. 15. CRC Press, 2006. ISBN 0849373409, 9780849373404; via [http://books.google.com/books?id=jykvlTCoksMC&amp;pg=PT386&amp;lpg=PT386&amp;dq=%22infeasible+path%22+%22halting+problem%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=WUWz3qMPRv&amp;sig=dSAjrLHBSZJcKWZfGa_IxYlfSNA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result Google Book Search]&lt;/ref&gt;  Methods for practical path coverage testing instead attempt to identify classes of code paths that differ only in the number of loop executions, and to achieve &quot;basis path&quot; coverage the tester must cover all the path classes.

==In practice==
The target software is built with special options or libraries and/or run under a special environment such that every function that is exercised (executed) in the program(s) is mapped back to the function points in the source code. This process allows developers and quality assurance personnel to look for parts of a system that are rarely or never accessed under normal conditions (error handling and the like) and helps reassure test engineers that the most important conditions (function points) have been tested.  The resulting output is then analyzed to see what areas of code have not been exercised and the tests are updated to include these areas as necessary.  Combined with other code coverage methods, the aim is to develop a rigorous, yet manageable, set of regression tests.

In implementing code coverage policies within a software development environment one must consider the following:

*  What are coverage requirements for the end product certification and if so what level of code coverage is required?  The typical level of rigor progression is as follows: Statement, Branch/Decision, Modified Condition/Decision Coverage(MC/DC), LCSAJ (Linear Code Sequence and Jump)
*  Will code coverage be measured against tests that verify requirements levied on the system under test (DO-178B)?
*  Is the object code generated directly traceable to source code statements?  Certain certifications, (ie. DO-178B Level A) require coverage at the assembly level if this is not the case: &quot;Then, additional verification should be performed on the object code to establish the correctness of such generated code sequences&quot; (DO-178B) para-6.4.4.2.&lt;ref name=&quot;DO-178B&quot;&gt;Software Considerations in Airborne System and Equipment Certification-RTCA/DO-178B, RTCA Inc., Washington D.C., December 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

Test engineers can look at code coverage test results to help them devise test cases and input or configuration sets that will increase the code coverage over vital functions. Two common forms of code coverage used by testers are statement (or line) coverage and path (or edge) coverage. Line coverage reports on the execution footprint of testing in terms of which lines of code were executed to complete the test. Edge coverage reports which branches or code decision points were executed to complete the test. They both report a coverage metric, measured as a percentage.  The meaning of this depends on what form(s) of code coverage have been used, as 67% path coverage is more comprehensive than 67% statement coverage.

Generally, code coverage tools and libraries exact a performance and/or memory or other resource cost which is unacceptable to normal operations of the software. Thus, they are only used in the lab. As one might expect, there are classes of software that cannot be feasibly subjected to these coverage tests, though a degree of coverage mapping can be approximated through analysis rather than direct testing.

There are also some sorts of defects which are affected by such tools. In particular, some race conditions or similar real time sensitive operations can be masked when run under code coverage environments; and conversely, some of these defects may become easier to find as a result of the additional overhead of the testing code.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Project management software''' is a term covering many types of software, including estimation and planning, scheduling, cost control and budget management, resource allocation, collaboration software, communication, quality management and documentation or administration systems, which are used to deal with the complexity of large projects.

==Tasks or activities of project management software==
===Scheduling===
One of the most common purposes is to schedule a series of events or tasks and the complexity of the schedule can vary considerably depending on how the tool is used. Some common challenges include:
* Events which depend on one another in different ways or dependencies
* Scheduling people to work on, and resources required by, the various tasks, commonly termed resource scheduling
* Dealing with uncertainties in the estimates of the duration of each task

===Providing information===
Project planning software can be expected to provide information to various people or stakeholders, and can be used to measure and justify the level of effort required to complete the project(s).  Typical requirements might include:
* Tasks lists for people, and allocation schedules for resources
* Overview information on how long tasks will take to complete
* Early warning of any risks to the project
* Information on workload, for planning holidays
* Evidence
* Historical information on how projects have progressed, and in particular, how actual and planned performance are related
* Optimum utilization of available resource

==Approaches to project management software==
===Desktop===
Project management software can be implemented as a program that runs on the desktop of each user.  This typically gives the most responsive and graphically-intense style of interface.

Desktop applications typically store their data in a file, although some have the ability to collaborate with other users (see below), or to store their data in a central database. Even a file-based project plan can be shared between users if it's on a networked drive and only one user accesses it at a time.

Desktop applications ''can'' be written to run in a heterogeneous environment of multiple operating systems, although it's unusual.

===Web-based===
Project management software can be implemented as a Web application, accessed through an intranet, or an extranet using a web browser.  

This has all the usual advantages and disadvantages of web applications:
* Can be accessed from any type of computer without installing software on user's computer
* Ease of access-control
* Naturally multi-user
* Only one software version and installation to maintain
* Centralized data repository
* Typically slower to respond than desktop applications
* Project information not available when the user (or server) is offline
* Some solutions allow the user to go offline with a copy of the data

===Personal===

A personal project management application is one used at home, typically to manage lifestyle or home projects.  There is considerable overlap with ''single user'' systems, although personal project management software typically involves simpler interfaces.  See also ''non-specialised tools'' below.

===Single user===
A single-user system is programmed with the assumption that only one person will ever need to edit the project plan at once.  This may be used in small companies, or ones where only a few people are involved in top-down project planning.  Desktop applications generally fall into this category.

===Collaborative===
A collaborative system is designed to support multiple users modifying different sections of the plan at once; for example, updating the areas they personally are responsible for such that those estimates get integrated into the overall plan.  Web-based tools, including extranets, generally fall into this category, but have the limitation that they can only be used when the user has live Internet access.  To address this limitation, some software tools using client–server architecture provide a rich client that runs on users' desktop computer and replicate project and task information to other project team members through a central server when users connect periodically to the network. Some tools allow team members to check out their schedules (and others' as read only) to work on them while not on the network.  When reconnecting to the database, all changes are synchronized with the other schedules.

===Integrated===
An integrated system combines project management or project planning, with many other aspects of company life.  For example, projects can have bug tracking issues assigned to each project, the list of project customers becomes a customer relationship management module, and each person on the project plan has their own task lists, calendars, and messaging functionality associated with their projects.

Similarly, specialised tools like SourceForge integrate project management software with source control (CVS) software and bug-tracking software, so that each piece of information can be integrated into the same system.

===Non-specialised tools===
While specialised software may be common, and heavily promoted by each vendor, there are a vast range of other software (and non-software) tools used to plan and schedule projects.
* Calendaring software can often handle scheduling as easily as dedicated software
* Spreadsheets are very versatile, and can be used to calculate things not anticipated by the designers.

==Criticisms of project management software==
The following may apply in general, or to specific products, or to some specific functions within products.

* May not be derived from a sound project management method.  For example, displaying the Gantt chart view by default encourages users to focus on timed task scheduling too early, rather than identifying objectives, deliverables and the imposed logical progress of events (dig the trench first to put in the drain pipe).
* May be inconsistent with the type of project management method.  For example, traditional (e.g. Waterfall) vs. agile (e.g. Scrum).
* Focuses primarily on the planning phase and does not offer enough functionality for project tracking, control and in particular plan-adjustment. There may be excessive dependency on the first paper print-out of a project plan, which is simply a snapshot at one moment in time. The plan is dynamic; as the project progresses the plan must change to accommodate tasks that are completed early, late, re-sequenced, etc. Good management software should not only facilitate this, but assist with impact assessment and communication of plan changes.
* Does not make a clear distinction between the planning phase and post planning phase, leading to user confusion and frustration when the software does not behave as expected. For example, shortening the duration of a task when an additional human resource is assigned to it while the project is still being planned.
* Offer complicated features to meet the needs of project management or project scheduling professionals, which must be understood in order to effectively use the product. Additional features may be so complicated as to be of no use to anyone. Complex task prioritization and resource leveling algorithms for example can produce results that make no intuitive sense, and overallocation is often more simply resolved manually.
* Some people may achieve better results using simpler technique, (e.g. pen and paper), yet feel pressured into using project management software by company policy ([http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=00008c&amp;topic_id=1&amp;topic= discussion]).
* Similar to PowerPoint, project management software might shield the manager from important interpersonal contact.
* New types of software are challenging the traditional definition of Project Management. Frequently, users of project management software are not actually managing a discrete project. For instance, managing the ongoing marketing for an already-released product is not a &quot;project&quot; in the traditional sense of the term; it does not involve management of discrete resources working on something with a discrete beginning/end. Groupware applications now add &quot;project management&quot; features that directly support this type of workflow-oriented project management. Classically-trained Project Managers may argue whether this is &quot;sound project management.&quot;  However, the end-users of such tools will refer to it as such, and the de-facto definition of the term Project Management may change.
* When there are multiple larger projects, project management software can be very useful. Nevertheless, one should probably not use management software if only a single small project is involved, as management software incurs a larger time-overhead than is worthwhile.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{mergeto | Software Development with Continuous Integration | We can make a much more comprehensive book on the subject }}

In software engineering, '''continuous integration'''  ('''CI''') implements ''continuous'' processes of applying quality control — small pieces of effort, applied frequently.  Continuous integration aims to improve the quality of software, and to reduce the time taken to deliver it, by replacing the traditional practice of applying quality control ''after'' completing all development.

==Theory==
When embarking on a change, a developer takes a copy of the current code base on which to work. As other developers submit changed code to the code repository, this copy gradually ceases to reflect the repository code. When developers submit code to the repository they must first update their code to reflect the changes in the repository since they took their copy. The more changes the repository contains, the more work developers must do before submitting their own changes.

Eventually, the repository may become so different from the developers' baselines that they enter what is sometimes called &quot;integration hell&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Cunningham, Integration Hell&quot; &gt;{{Cite web

  | accessdate = 19 Sept 2009
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
where the time it takes to integrate exceeds the time it took to make their original changes. In a worst-case scenario, developers may have to discard their changes and completely redo the work.

Continuous integration involves integrating early and often, so as to avoid the pitfalls of &quot;integration hell&quot;. The practice aims to reduce rework and thus reduce cost and time.

The rest of this article discusses best practice in how to achieve continuous integration, and how to automate this practice. Automation is a best practice itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brauneis, [OSLC] Possible new Working Group - Automation&quot; &gt;{{Cite mailing list

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recommended practices==
Continuous integration - as the practice of frequently integrating one's new or changed code with the existing code repository - should occur frequently enough that no intervening window remains between commit and build, and such that no errors can arise without developers noticing them and correcting them immediately.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fowler, Continuous Integration practices&quot; &gt;{{Cite web
  |url=http://martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html#PracticesOfContinuousIntegration
  |title=Continuous Integration
  |accessdate=2009-11-11
  |last=Fowler |first=Martin  |authorlink=Martin Fowler
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Normal practice is to trigger these builds by every commit to a repository, rather than a periodically scheduled build. The practicalities of doing this in a multi-developer environment of rapid commits are such that it's usual to trigger a short timer after each commit, then to start a build when either this timer expires, or after a rather longer interval since the last build. Automated tools such as CruiseControl or Hudson offer this scheduling automatically.

Another factor is the need for a version control system that supports atomic commits, i.e. all of a developer's changes may be seen as a single commit operation. There is no point in trying to build from only half of the changed files.

===Maintain a code repository===
This practice advocates the use of a revision control system for the project's source code.  All artifacts required to build the project should be placed in the repository. In this practice and in the revision control community, the convention is that the system should be buildable from a fresh checkout and not require additional dependencies.  Extreme Programming advocate Martin Fowler also mentions that where branching is supported by tools, its use should be minimised {{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}. Instead, it is preferred that changes are integrated rather than creating multiple versions of the software that are maintained simultaneously.  The mainline (or trunk) should be the place for the working version of the software.

===Automate the build===
A single command should have the capability of building the system.  Many build-tools, such as make, have existed for many years. Other more recent tools like Ant, Maven, MSBuild or IBM Rational Build Forge are frequently used in continuous integration environments.  Automation of the build should include automating the integration, which often includes deployment into a production-like environment. In many cases, the build script not only compiles binaries, but also generates documentation, website pages, statistics and distribution media (such as Windows MSI files, RPM or DEB files).

===Make the build self-testing===
Once the code is built, all tests should run to confirm that it behaves as the developers expect it to behave.

===Everyone commits to the baseline every day===
By committing regularly, every committer can reduce the number of conflicting changes.  Checking in a week's worth of work runs the risk of conflicting with other features and can be very difficult to resolve.  Early, small conflicts in an area of the system cause team members to communicate about the change they are making.

Many programmers recommend committing all changes at least once a day (once per feature built), and in addition performing a nightly build.

===Every commit (to baseline) should be built===
The system should build commits to the current working version in order to verify that they integrate correctly.  A common practice is to use Automated Continuous Integration, although this may be done manually. For many, continuous integration is synonymous with using Automated Continuous Integration where a continuous integration server or daemon monitors the version control system for changes, then automatically runs the build process.

===Keep the build fast===
The build needs to complete rapidly, so that if there is a problem with integration, it is quickly identified.

===Test in a clone of the production environment===
Having a test environment can lead to failures in tested systems when they deploy in the production environment, because the production environment may differ from the test environment in a significant way.  However, building a replica of a production environment is cost prohibitive.  Instead, the pre-production environment should be built to be a scalable version of the actual production environment to both alleviate costs while maintaining technology stack composition and nuances.

===Make it easy to get the latest deliverables===
Making builds readily available to stakeholders and testers can reduce the amount of rework necessary when rebuilding a feature that doesn't meet requirements. Additionally, early testing reduces the chances that defects survive until deployment. Finding errors earlier also, in some cases, reduces the amount of work necessary to resolve them.

===Everyone can see the results of the latest build===
It should be easy to find out where/whether the build breaks and who made the relevant change.

===Automate deployment===
Most CI systems allow the running of scripts after a build finishes.  In most situations, it is possible to write a script to deploy the application to a live test server that everyone can look at. A further advance in this way of thinking is Continuous Deployment, which calls for the software to be deployed directly into production, often with additional automation to prevent defects or regressions&lt;ref&gt;See http://radar.oreilly.com/2009/03/continuous-deployment-5-eas.html and http://timothyfitz.wordpress.com/2009/02/10/continuous-deployment-at-imvu-doing-the-impossible-fifty-times-a-day/&lt;/ref&gt;.

==History==
Continuous Integration emerged in the Extreme Programming (XP) community, and XP advocates Martin Fowler and Kent Beck first wrote about continuous integration circa 1999. Fowler's paper&lt;ref name=&quot;Fowler, Continuous Integration&quot; &gt;{{Cite web
  |last=Fowler |first=Martin  |authorlink=Martin Fowler
  |url=http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html
  |title=Continuous Integration
  |ref=Fowler, Continuous Integration
}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a popular source of information on the subject. Beck's book ''Extreme Programming Explained''&lt;ref name=&quot;Beck, Extreme Programming Explained&quot; &gt;{{Cite book
  |title=Extreme Programming Explained
  |last=Beck  |first=Kent  |authorlink=Kent Beck
  |year=1999
  |isbn=0-201-61641-6
  |ref=Beck, Extreme Programming Explained
}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the original reference for Extreme Programming, also describes the term.

==Advantages and disadvantages==
=== Advantages ===
Continuous integration has many advantages:

* when unit tests fail or a bug emerges, developers might revert the codebase back to a bug-free state, without wasting time debugging
* developers detect and fix integration problems continuously - avoiding last-minute chaos at release dates, (when everyone tries to check in their slightly incompatible versions).
* early warning of broken/incompatible code
* early warning of conflicting changes
* immediate unit testing of all changes
* constant availability of a &quot;current&quot; build for testing, demo, or release purposes
* immediate feedback to developers on the quality, functionality, or system-wide impact of code they are writing
* frequent code check-in pushes developers to create modular, less complex code{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}
* metrics generated from automated testing and CI (such as metrics for code coverage, code complexity, and features complete) focus developers on developing functional, quality code, and help develop momentum in a team{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

===Disadvantages===
* initial setup time required
* well-developed test-suite required to achieve automated testing advantages
* large-scale refactoring can be troublesome due to continuously changing code base
* hardware costs for build machines can be significant

Many teams using CI report that the advantages of CI well outweigh the disadvantages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
The effect of finding and fixing integration bugs early in the development process saves both time and money over the lifespan of a project.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''bug tracking system''' is a software application that is designed to help quality assurance and programmers keep track of reported software bugs in their work. It may be regarded as a type of issue tracking system.

Many bug-tracking systems, such as those used by most open source software projects, allow users to enter bug reports directly. Other systems are used only internally in a company or organization doing software development. Typically bug tracking systems are integrated with other software project management applications. 

Having a bug tracking system is extremely valuable in software development, and they are used extensively by companies developing software products.  Consistent use of a bug or issue tracking system is considered one of the &quot;hallmarks of a good software team&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000029.html |title=Painless Bug Tracking|author=Joel Spolsky|accessdate=29 October 2010|date=November 08 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Components ==

A major component of a bug tracking system is a database that records facts about known bugs. Facts may include the time a bug was reported, its severity, the erroneous program behavior, and details on how to reproduce the bug; as well as the identity of the person who reported it and any programmers who may be working on fixing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://docforge.com/wiki/Bug_report | title=Bug report | author=Multiple (wiki) | work=Docforge | accessdate=2010-03-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical bug tracking systems support the concept of the life cycle for a bug which is tracked through status assigned to the bug. A bug tracking system should allow administrators to configure permissions based on status, move the bug to another status, or delete the bug. The system should also allow administrators to configure the bug statuses and to what status a bug in a particular status can be moved. Some systems will e-mail interested parties, such as the submitter and assigned programmers, when new records are added or the status changes.

== Usage ==

The main benefit of a bug-tracking system is to provide a clear centralized overview of development requests (including both bugs and improvements, the boundary is often fuzzy), and their state. The prioritized list of pending items (often called backlog) provides valuable input when defining the product roadmap, or maybe just &quot;the next release&quot;.

In a corporate environment, a bug-tracking system may be used to generate reports on the productivity of programmers at fixing bugs. However, this may sometimes yield inaccurate results because different bugs may have different levels of severity and complexity. The severity of a bug may not be directly related to the complexity of fixing the bug. There may be different opinions among the managers and architects.

A ''local bug tracker (LBT)'' is usually a computer program used by a team of application support professionals (often a help desk) to keep track of issues communicated to software developers. Using an LBT allows support professionals to track bugs in their &quot;own language&quot; and not the &quot;language of the developers.&quot; In addition, a LBT allows a team of support professionals to track specific information about users who have called to complain &amp;mdash; this information may not always be needed in the actual development queue. Thus, there are two tracking systems when an LBT is in place.

== Bug tracking systems as a part of integrated project management systems ==
Bug and issue tracking systems are often implemented as a part of integrated project management systems.
This approach allows including bug tracking and fixing in a general product development process, fixing bugs in several product versions, automatic generation of a product knowledge base and release notes.

== Distributed bug tracking ==

Some bug trackers are designed to be used with distributed revision control software. These distributed bug trackers allow bug reports to be conveniently read, added to the database or updated while a developer is offline.&lt;ref name='lwn-distributed'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lwn.net/Articles/281849/ |title=Distributed bug tracking|author=Jonathan Corbet|accessdate=7 January 2009|work=LWN.net|date=May 14 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Distributed bug trackers include Bugs Everywhere, and Fossil.

Recently, commercial bug tracking systems have also begun to integrate with distributed version control.  FogBugz, for example, enables this functionality via the source-control tool, Kiln.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fogcreek.com/FogBugz/learnmore.html | title=FogBugz Features | | work=Fogbugz.com | accessdate=2010-10-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although wikis and bug tracking systems are conventionally viewed as distinct types of software, ikiwiki can also be used as a distributed bug tracker. It can manage documents and code as well, in an integrated distributed manner. However, its query functionality is not as advanced or as user-friendly as some other, non-distributed bug trackers such as Bugzilla.&lt;ref name='ikiwiki'&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.linuxworld.com/news/2007/040607-integrated-issue-tracking-ikiwiki.html |title=Integrated issue tracking with Ikiwiki |accessdate=7 January 2009 |author=Joey Hess|work=LinuxWorld.com |publisher=IDG|date=6 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar statements can be made about org-mode, although it is not wiki software as such.

==Bug tracking and test management==
While traditional test management tools such as HP Quality Center and Rational Software come with their own bug tracking systems. Other tools integrate with popular bug tracking systems.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011|reason=Is it &quot;traditional&quot; or is it &quot;proprietary&quot; vs. Open Source?}}

:[[File:RL_Series_Open-Closed.svg|100px]]

==Formula==
The total Impedance of the circuit
:&lt;math&gt;Z = Z_R + Z_L&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Z = R + j\omega L&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Z = \frac{1}{R} (1 + j\omega T)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;T = \frac{L}{R}&lt;/math&gt;

The 1st order Differential equation of the circuit in equilirium
:&lt;math&gt;L \frac{di}{dt} + i R = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{di}{dt} + i \frac{R}{L} = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\int \frac{di}{i} = -\frac{R}{L} \int dt&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Ln i = -\frac{t}{T} + c&lt;/math&gt;

The root of the equation is a Exponential Decay function chracterised the Natural Response of the circuit
:&lt;math&gt;i = Ae^(-\frac{t}{T})&lt;/math&gt;



:&lt;math&gt;Z = Z_R + Z_L&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Z = R \angle 0 + \omega L \angle 90&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Z = |Z| \angle \theta&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Z = \sqrt{R^2 + (\omega L)^2} \angle \omega \frac{L}{R}&lt;/math&gt;

Phase Shift , Change in Frequency relate to change in RL value
:&lt;math&gt;Tan \theta = \omega \frac{L}{R} = 2 \pi f \frac{L}{R} = 2 \pi \frac{1}{t} \frac{L}{R}&lt;/math&gt;

==Summary==
Series RL is characterised by

1st ordered Differential equation of the circuit at equilibrium. 
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{di}{dt} + \frac{1}{T} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Natural Reponse of the circuit is the Exponential Decay 
:&lt;math&gt;i = Ae^(-\frac{t}{T})&lt;/math&gt;

===Circuit's Impedance===
The total Impedance of the circuit
:&lt;math&gt;Z = Z_R + Z_L&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Z = R + j\omega L&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Z = \frac{1}{R} (1 + j\omega T)&lt;/math&gt;

===Differential Equation===
The Differential equation of the circuit at equilibrium

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Destructors should not throw exceptions ==

While it's particularly important in RAII, it's a general rule that destructors should not throw exceptions (since apart from anything else, even non-RAII types get their destructors called when exiting a scope due to an active exception, and throwing an exception at this point will be fatal). At the moment the text implies that this is a special case, which I think should be changed. --[[User:Fishpi|Fishpi]] ([[User talk:Fishpi|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Fishpi|contribs]]) 18:44, 18 February 2011 (UTC)</text>

==Formula==
The total impedance of the circuit 
:&lt;math&gt;Z = Z_R + Z_L&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Z = R + j\omega L&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Z = \frac{1}{R} (1 + j\omega T)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;T = \frac{L}{R}&lt;/math&gt;

ist order Differential equation of the circuit
:&lt;math&gt;L \frac{di}{dt} + i R = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{di}{dt} + i \frac{R}{L} = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\int \frac{di}{i} = -\frac{R}{L} \int dt&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Ln i = -\frac{t}{T} + c&lt;/math&gt;

The root of the equation is an Exponential Decaqy function characterised the Natural Response of the circuit
:&lt;math&gt;i = Ae^(-\frac{t}{T})&lt;/math&gt;



:&lt;math&gt;Z = Z_R + Z_L&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Z = R \angle 0 + \omega L \angle 90&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Z = |Z| \angle \theta&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Z = \sqrt{R^2 + (\omega L)^2} \angle \omega \frac{L}{R}&lt;/math&gt;

Phase Change, Frequency change relate to the change in value of RC
:&lt;math&gt;Tan \theta = \omega \frac{L}{R} = 2 \pi f \frac{L}{R} = 2 \pi \frac{1}{t} \frac{L}{R}&lt;/math&gt;

==Summary==
Series RC is characterised by

1st ordered Differential equation of the circuit at equilibrium. 
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{di}{dt} + \frac{1}{T} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Natural Reponse of the circuit is the Exponential Decay 
:&lt;math&gt;v = Ae^(-\frac{t}{T})&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;T = RC&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;V_L + V_C = 0 &lt;/math&gt; . &lt;math&gt;V_C = -V_L&lt;/math&gt;

==Summary==
Series LC can be characterised by

2nd order Differential Equation
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2i}{dt^2} + \frac{1}{T} = 0&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;T = LC&lt;/math&gt;

=== Usage ===
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
{{preload
|1 = 
|2 = 
|3 = 
}}
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
Use this template to provide a link to an automatically '''preloaded''' specific page.  The first parameter is the only required one, and is the title of the page you want to create.  You must provide the full name of the target page, including [[WB:NS|namespace]].  The second input allows you to customize what text the link displays.  If a third parameter is provided, the target page will contain the contents of that third parameter (again, full title including namespace is required).  This only works if the page doesn't already exist.  Thus,

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{preload|1=Special:MyPage/preloadtest|2=This is a test|3=Template:Preload/example}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

Produces:

{{Preload|1=Special:MyPage/preloadtest|2=This is a test|3=Template:Preload/example}}

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

This is the {{tl|editnotice talkpagename}} meta-template.

It returns the full pagename for the discussion page of the editnotice for the current page. 

Note that this template doesn't produce the editnotice page name for discussion pages, instead it produces the discussion page name for the editnotice.

If you need the editnotice page name itself, then use {{tl|editnotice pagename}} instead.

Note that the main editnotices for a user page and a user discussion page do not have a discussion page, so it will not work there.

=== Usage ===
This template takes no parameters and automatically outputs a proper formatted editnotice discussion page address. Like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{editnotice talkpagename}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Which outputs the discussion page name of the editnotice for this page itself:

:{{editnotice talkpagename}}

This can for instance be used to produce a link to the discussion page of the editnotice for the current page. Like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
[[{{editnotice talkpagename}}]]
&lt;/pre&gt;

:[[{{editnotice talkpagename}}]]

=== See also ===
* [[Help:Editnotices]] – More about editnotices.
* {{tl|editnotice pagename}} – Returns the full pagename for the editnotice for the current page.
* {{tl|editnotice}} – A template for making editnotice message boxes.

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

=== Usage ===
This template provides an easy way to link to a page without following a redirect.

&lt;pre&gt;{{no redirect|page name|label}}&lt;/pre&gt;

It accepts two unnamed parameters:
* 1= (required) the name of the page to link.
* 2= (optional) the text to be displayed. If this is omitted then the input of the first parameter is used.

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

This is the {{tl|editnotice explanation}} template.

It can be placed at the top of talk pages of [[Help:Editnotices|editnotices]]. 

This template takes one optional parameter, which is the CSS class/id name of the editnotice, if one has been set (typically via the &quot;id&quot; and &quot;class&quot; parameters of {{tl|fmbox}}).

* Example: &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{editnotice explanation}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;
* Example: &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{editnotice explanation|idname}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;

* {{tl|permprot}} – For the talk pages of protected pages other than editnotices.
* {{tl|interface explanation}} – For the talk pages of MediaWiki messages.

=== Usage ===

This template should be placed on &lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[{{fullurl:Special:Allpages|namespace=9}} MediaWiki discussion pages]&lt;/span&gt; and a corresponding documentation page for the MediaWiki page itself should be created in the [[mw:Manual:Interface|MediaWiki interface manual]].

Despite the wording of the message when viewed here, this page is not part of the interface and is not protected.

=== Usage ===
* This template provides the [[Help:Editnotices|editnotice]] for all [[Wikibooks:Categories|category]] pages.

=== Hiding the message ===
This template is marked with the CSS id &lt;tt&gt;&quot;category-namespace-editnotice&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;, so that editors can apply their own CSS customization if they wish, in particular to hide it. To hide the message, add

:&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;#category-namespace-editnotice{display:none;}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;

into [[Special:MyPage/skin.css]], which redirects to your current skin's CSS file (open in new tab/window to see).

This template is transcluded onto a MediaWiki:Editnotice to let new editors know that their contributions to certain discussion pages might be better directed elsewhere, as very few ancillary discussion pages are actively watched.

The parameters for the template are: &lt;tt&gt;help&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;subject&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;mediawiki&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;transwiki&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;category&lt;/tt&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== British spelling ==

I undid the change that Americanised the spelling (organisation -&gt; organization). Obviously we need to be consistent within the book, and I haven't taken the time to find out what the current pattern is. But for a book about the EU, I vote to stick with the European and not the American spelling. --[[User:Fishpi|Fishpi]] ([[User talk:Fishpi|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Fishpi|contribs]]) 08:09, 19 February 2011 (UTC)

:Yes, that is how it is supposed to be, if we take the same conventions that Wikipedia does (and I do, using a notice template that reiterates the same thing).  European topics would get British spellings. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 13:38, 19 February 2011 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Strings ==
Let's make variable with string as value, we will use string literal. Strings can be enclosed in double and single quotes but I advise using double quotes because in most laguages strings enclosed in double quotes and chars in single quotes.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
str = &quot;Hello, &quot;;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Concatenation ===
We can concatenate strings using '+' operator. Let's add to string in variable 'a' string &quot;world&quot;.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
str = str + &quot;world!&quot;; // Hello, world!
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Length of string ===
Any string variable have 'length' property that containg number of chars in string.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
str.length; // 13
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Split ===
String.split([separator]) - returns array of substrings that was obtained by separate '''String''' by '''separator'''. If '''separator''' not defined then '''separator''' = &quot;,&quot;
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
names = &quot;Artem,Michail,Nicholas,Alexander&quot;;
listOfNames = names.split(','); //Split string to list of strings
twoNames = names.split(',',2); //Split with limit
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Getting substrings and char ===
We can get substring from string using functions substr(index,len) and substring(indexA,indexB). First return substring from 'index' with length equal to len. Second return substring from indexA to indexB.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
a = &quot;Hello world!&quot;;
first = a.substr(0,5); //Hello
second = a.substring(6,11); // world
&lt;/source&gt;
We can also get a char at some position using charAt function.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
a = &quot;Hello world!&quot;;
b = a.charAt(2); //e
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Position of substring ===
We can also get a position of some substring in string using indexOf and lastIndexOf functions. Both functions give two arguments but only first required it's a string that function search and second argument it's position from that function search string. indexOf return first position of substring and lastIndexOf return las position of substring. If substring not found both functions return -1
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
a = &quot;Hello world&quot;;
b = a.indexOf('o',5); // 7
c = a.lastIndexOf('l'); // 9
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Sourdough Starter, How should it smell?

Can anyone who has worked with beginning a &quot;Sourdough Bread Starter,&quot; tell us how it should smell?
Our current 2-day-old-starter has a strong Romano cheese odor? Should this be considered as normal or should it be discarded and restarted? 
Please any information on this topic would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you,
g

== Rather wet starter ==

In the &quot;Method&quot; paragraph it is written &quot;1/2 tablespoon to 3 tablespooons of water&quot; to start the starter.

You try mixing half a tablespoon of flour with 3 tablespoons of water and you'll get a fluid that looks much like non-fat milk.

Are you sure about this half a tablespoon of flour to 3 tablespoons of water ratio - to begin the starter?  The results (according to your instructions) seems rather &quot;wet&quot; for a starter.

:It's probably an advanced technique that uses a higher hydration during the motherdough stage, or possibly only during the first three days before the culture has stabilized. I haven't analyzed it, therefore the weasel word, &quot;probably&quot;. Are you perhaps suggesting that a more simplistic approach, or perhaps a second technique that uses a stiffer initial hydration, would be useful and an improvement to the cookbook:sourdough (article) page?

== Interesting but needs help ==
The unnecessary complexity of the text makes it hard to fallow for one that is for the first time looking into the subject. Some information of historical reference should be reduced as much of the unnecessary contextualization (for the purpose of the Cookbook).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 19:32, 12 April 2012 (UTC)
:You're free to delete at will. I'm burned out for now, and have many other tasks which I'm now prioritizing higher. Thank you. Besides some poor grammar that I wrote, There are also some subjects that are not yet covered well in the article, such as temperature, how it relates to organisms' generation times, and even pH.  Creating spontaneous sourdough starter is not a simplistic subject, and I didn't create that section (whatever it's title was before) ... let me make a metaphor! To treat creating spontaneous sour as simplistic is much like asking a kindergärtner to watch the panic button, but not to touch it. If I purchased a cookbook and it didn't cover those subjects, I'd want my money back right now!

:: Delete no, I was only remarking that the prose should be improved. I have not the knowledge to contribute to it meaningfully. My interest in this is simply as an observer that sees this type of basic knowledge that is important to our civilizational structure being lost. That as is it seems only accessible to one that already has knowledge on the subject. I full agree with you that this type of knowledge has structural importance and is often relegated to the use of &quot;black boxed&quot; solutions, mostly demonstrating the lack of knowledge or a commercial interest.   --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 23:44, 12 April 2012 (UTC)

:::Thank you for your feedback and constructive critique. I will try to return in a month, maybe two, and revisit the prose. Self editing is also difficult, and I find dismissing it from the mind for a longish time, followed by returning, helps. Maybe someone else will come by and do some editing in the meantime.

== Intro ==
In the intro when explaining why locality alters cultures, it may be interesting to add why. I'm guessing that temperature, humidity, weather and atmospheric pressure, even altitude and variations of sun light/darkness could be factors for the cultures to diverge.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 03:29, 17 April 2012 (UTC)

The rising and taste in the intro is in relation to the &quot;raw&quot; sourdough starter right? As it ferments it rises, but is the taste important at this time (I ask because it is given importance). When backed the taste will undoubtedly change, even if characteristic is the initial taste so important/noticeable in the final product? For instance in relation to the backing process or what is added to the mixture ?&lt;br&gt;
Can it be said that as it ferments (rises) the cultures enter a state of symbiosis or equilibrium/balance and that is why it is preferred to start with culture that has not only already reached that state but has proven viable in its function ?&lt;br&gt;
Thanks for the work...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 03:43, 17 April 2012 (UTC)</text>

=== Usage ===
* This template provides the [[Help:Editnotices|editnotice]] for all [[Subject:Books by subject|subject]] pages.

=== Hiding the message ===
This template is marked with the CSS id &lt;tt&gt;&quot;subject-namespace-editnotice&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;, so that editors can apply their own CSS customization if they wish, in particular to hide it. To hide the message, add

:&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;#subject-namespace-editnotice{display:none;}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;

into [[Special:MyPage/skin.css]], which redirects to your current skin's CSS file (open in new tab/window to see).
&lt;includeonly&gt;

I've never heard of this idiom, and I can't find any information about it on the web (the only relevant hits on Google lead back here). Does it have another name? Can someone explain enough about it that I could fill in the rest? --[[User:Fishpi|Fishpi]] ([[User talk:Fishpi|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Fishpi|contribs]]) 17:29, 19 February 2011 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Claude Hopkins==
'''Claude Hopkins''' (1866-1932) was a pioneer who wrote the groundbreaking book ''Scientific Advertising''. He developed the concept of &quot;reason why&quot; advertising. He first cut his teeth designing ads for the Bissell Carpet Sweeper Company.
==Helen Lansdowne==
'''Helen Lansdowne''' (1886-1964) was a famous copywriter known for her work for Woodbury's Facial Soaps and Pond's Cold Cream. She was the first woman to present ads to the board of Procter &amp; Gamble.
==Raymond Rubicam==
Raymond Rubicam was the co-founder of prodigious ad firm Young &amp; Rubicam. He managed to get pollster George Gallup to join Y&amp;R, where he formed the first advertising research department.
==Rosser Reeves== 
'''Rosser Reeves''' (10 September 1910–24 January 1984) 
Was a hugely successful American advertising executive and pioneer of television advertising. He believed the purpose of advertising is to sell. He insisted that an advertisement or commercial should show off the value of a product, not the cleverness of a copywriter. His most typical ad is probably that for Anacin, a headache medicine. The ad was considered grating and annoying by almost all viewers but it was remarkably successful, tripling the product's sales. In 7 years the 59-second commercial made more money than the movie Gone With The Wind had in a quarter-century.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Advertisers refer to the standard communications model of a ''source'' transmitting a ''message'' through a ''channel'' (which contains a degree of ''noise'') to a ''target''. ''Feedback'' is received by the source in response to the message. Good feedback typically comes in the form of money spent on the product advertised.

'''Customer Relations Management (CRM)''' is concerned with (among other things) the '''conversion rate''': percentage of customers who &quot;try and buy&quot; the product.

There are three types of appeals in advertising: logical, ethical, and emotional.

[[Image:Marcom matrix.png|right|thumb|300px|The MarCom Matrix.]]
Advertising is just one way to spend your marketing dollar. There are a variety of ways to promote a product, collectively called Marketing Communications (MarCom). They are illustrated by the MarCom Matrix.

'''Marketing Public Relations''' (MPR) is an attractive alternative to advertising. MPR uses public relations techniques as part of a marketing campaign. PR tools used by marketers include newsletters, events, endorsements, demonstrations, contests, and interviews.

There are two main types of promotion: '''trade promotion''' and '''consumer promotion'''. The differences in ad strategies are characterized as &quot;push&quot; and &quot;pull&quot;: trade promotions are designed to ''push'' the product (into the market), and consumer promotions are made to ''pull'' the product (into the shopping cart).

==Promotions==
The three types of promotions are '''Win''', '''Free''', and '''Save'''.
===Win===
Examples of &quot;win&quot;-type promotions are games and contests. Sweepstakes are probably the most popular &quot;win&quot; promotion. According to US law, purchase cannot be necessary to win a sweepstakes. If purchase were necessary, that would make it a lottery; and lotteries can only be conducted by the state.
===Free===
A &quot;free&quot;-type promotion offers the consumer something for no charge. These are '''premiums''' (buy one product, get another for a discount, or for free), '''bonus packs''' (&quot;more for less&quot;), and '''sampling''' (free samples). A '''continuity program''' is a free-type promotion that makes the consumer part of a &quot;club&quot;. An example of this are coffee shops that give their customers a card that is punched or stamped each time they buy coffee; after a certain number of purchases are made, they are given a free coffee.
===Save===
Examples of &quot;save&quot; promotions are coupons, rebates, and other money-saving ads. Another is the FSI (Free-Standing Insert), a sheet of coupons typically inserted into newspapers.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Oscillation up and down of a Spring==
:[[File:Simple_harmonic_oscillator.gif|100px]]]]
When apply a force on an object of mass attach to a spring . The spring will move a distance y above and below the equilibrium point and this movement keeps on repeating itself for a period of time . The movement up and down of spring for a period of time is called Oscillation

===1===
The force acts on the object to pull the object down
: F = m a

The Restoring Force of spring to push the object up can be calculated by Hook's Law
: F&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; = - k y

The oscillation stops when 
: F&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; = - F&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;
: m a = - k y
: y = &lt;math&gt;\frac{m a}{k}&lt;/math&gt;
: a = - &lt;math&gt;\frac{k}{m} y&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;t = \frac{k}{m} \frac{y}{v}&lt;/math&gt;

===2===
Any force acting on an object can be expressed in a differential equation
: &lt;math&gt;F = m \frac{d^2y}{dt^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Equilibrium is reached when 
: F&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; = - F&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;F = m \frac{d^2y}{dt^2} = - k y&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;F = \frac{d^2y}{dt^2} + \frac{k}{m} y = 0&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;s^2 + \frac{k}{m} s = 0&lt;/math&gt;
: s = ± j &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} t &lt;/math&gt;
: s = ± j &lt;math&gt;\omega t &lt;/math&gt;
: s =  &lt;math&gt;e^ j\omega t +  e^ -j\omega t&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;y = A Sin \omega t&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Simple Regular Expression''' syntax is widely used on Unix based systems for the purposes of backwards compatibility. Most regular-expression-aware Unix utilities, such as ''grep'' and ''sed'', use it by default while providing support for extended regular expressions with command line arguments (see below). This syntax is deprecated on POSIX compliant systems and should not be used by new utilities.

When simple regular expression syntax is being used, most characters, except metacharacters are treated as literal characters and match only themselves (for example, &quot;a&quot; matches &quot;a&quot;, &quot;(bc&quot; matches &quot;(bc&quot;, etc).

{| valign=&quot;top&quot; class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+ Operators
! Operator
! Effect
|-
|'''.'''
|The dot operator matches any single character.
|- valign=&quot;top&quot;
|[ ]
| boxes enable a single character to be matched against character lists or character ranges.
|- valign=&quot;top&quot;
|[^ ]
|A compliment box enables a single character not within in a character list or character range to be matched.
|- valign=&quot;top&quot;
|^
| A caret anchor matches the start of the line (or any line, when applied in multiline mode)
|- valign=&quot;top&quot;
|$
|A dollar anchor matches the end of the line (or any line, when applied in multiline mode)
|- valign=&quot;top&quot;
|( )
| parentheses are used to define a marked subexpression. The matched text section can be recalled at a later time.
|- valign=&quot;top&quot;
|\''n''
|Where ''n'' is a digit from 1 to 9; matches what the ''n''th marked subexpression matched.  This irregular construct has not been adopted in the extended regular expression syntax.
|- valign=&quot;top&quot;
|*
|A single character expression followed by &quot;*&quot; matches zero or more copies of the expression. For example, &quot;ab*c&quot; matches &quot;ac&quot;, &quot;abc&quot;, &quot;abbbc&quot; etc. &quot;[xyz]*&quot; matches &quot;&quot;, &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;zx&quot;, &quot;zyx&quot;, and so on.
*\''n''*, where ''n'' is a digit from 1 to 9, matches zero or more iterations of what the ''n''th marked subexpression matched.  For example, &quot;(a.)c\1*&quot; matches &quot;abcab&quot; and &quot;abcabab&quot; but not &quot;abcac&quot;.
*An expression enclosed in &quot;\(&quot; and &quot;\)&quot; followed by &quot;*&quot; is deemed to be invalid. In some cases (e.g. /usr/bin/xpg4/grep of SunOS 5.8), it matches zero or more iterations of the string that the enclosed expression matches.  In other cases (e.g. /usr/bin/grep of SunOS 5.8), it matches what the enclosed expression matches, followed by a literal &quot;*&quot;.
|}

== Examples ==
Examples:
* &quot;^[hc]at&quot;
** Matches ''hat'' and ''cat'' but only at the beginning of a line.
* &quot;[hc]at$&quot;
** Matches ''hat'' and ''cat'' but only at the end of a line.

==Use in Tools==

Tools and languages that utilize this regular expression syntax include:

* [[Grep]]
* [[sed]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''POSIX Basic Regular Expression''' syntax provided extensions to achieve consistency between utility programs such as grep, sed and awk. These extensions are not supported by some traditional implementations of Unix tools.

=== History ===

Traditional Unix regular expression syntax followed common conventions that often differed from tool to tool. The POSIX Basic Regular Expressions syntax was developed by the IEEE, together with an extended variant called [[ERE| Extended Regular Expression]] syntax. These standards were designed mostly to provide backward compatibility with the traditional [[../Simple Regular Expressions/]] syntax, providing a common standard which has since been adopted as the default syntax of many Unix regular expression tools.

=== Syntax ===

In POSIX Basic Regular Expression syntax, most characters are treated as literals — they match only themselves (e.g., &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; matches &quot;''a''&quot;). The exceptions, listed below, are called ''metacharacters'' or ''metasequences''.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Metacharacter
! Description
|- valign=&quot;top&quot;
|&lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt;
|Matches any single character (many applications exclude newlines, and exactly which characters are considered newlines is flavor, character encoding, and platform specific, but it is safe to assume that the line feed character is included). Within POSIX bracket expressions, the dot character matches a literal dot. For example, &lt;code&gt;a.c&lt;/code&gt; matches &quot;''abc''&quot;, etc., but &lt;code&gt;[a.c]&lt;/code&gt; matches only &quot;''a''&quot;, &quot;''.''&quot;, or &quot;''c''&quot;.
|- valign=&quot;top&quot;
|&lt;code&gt;[&amp;nbsp;]&lt;/code&gt;
|A bracket expression. Matches a single character that is contained within the brackets. For example, &lt;code&gt;[abc]&lt;/code&gt; matches &quot;''a''&quot;, &quot;''b''&quot;, or &quot;''c''&quot;. &lt;code&gt;[a-z]&lt;/code&gt; specifies a range which matches any lowercase letter from &quot;''a''&quot; to &quot;''z''&quot;. These forms can be mixed: &lt;code&gt;[abcx-z]&lt;/code&gt; matches &quot;''a''&quot;, &quot;''b''&quot;, &quot;''c''&quot;, &quot;''x''&quot;, &quot;''y''&quot;, or &quot;''z''&quot;, as does &lt;code&gt;[a-cx-z]&lt;/code&gt;.
The &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; character is treated as a literal character if it is the last or the first (after the &lt;code&gt;^&lt;/code&gt;) character within the brackets: &lt;code&gt;[abc-]&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;[-abc]&lt;/code&gt;.  Note that backslash escapes are not allowed.  The &lt;code&gt;]&lt;/code&gt; character can be included in a bracket expression if it is the first (after the &lt;code&gt;^&lt;/code&gt;) character: &lt;code&gt;[]abc]&lt;/code&gt;.
|- valign=&quot;top&quot;
|&lt;code&gt;[^&amp;nbsp;]&lt;/code&gt;
|Matches a single character that is not contained within the brackets. For example, &lt;code&gt;[^abc]&lt;/code&gt; matches any character other than &quot;''a''&quot;, &quot;''b''&quot;, or &quot;''c''&quot;. &lt;code&gt;[^a-z]&lt;/code&gt; matches any single character that is not a lowercase letter from &quot;''a''&quot; to &quot;''z''&quot;. As above, literal characters and ranges can be mixed.
|- valign=&quot;top&quot;
|&lt;code&gt;^&lt;/code&gt;
|Matches the starting position within the string. In line-based tools, it matches the starting position of any line.
|- valign=&quot;top&quot;
|&lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt;
|Matches the ending position of the string or the position just before a string-ending newline. In line-based tools, it matches the ending position of any line.
|- valign=&quot;top&quot;
|{{nowrap|BRE: &lt;code&gt;\(&amp;nbsp;\)&lt;/code&gt;}}&lt;br /&gt;{{nowrap|ERE: &lt;code&gt;(&amp;nbsp;)&lt;/code&gt;}}
|Defines a marked subexpression. The string matched within the parentheses can be recalled later (see the next entry, &lt;code&gt;\''n''&lt;/code&gt;).  A marked subexpression is also called a block or capturing group.
|- valign=&quot;top&quot;
|&lt;code&gt;\''n''&lt;/code&gt;
|Matches what the ''n''th marked subexpression matched, where ''n'' is a digit from 1 to 9. This construct is theoretically '''irregular''' and was not adopted in the POSIX ERE syntax. Some tools allow referencing more than nine capturing groups.
|- valign=&quot;top&quot;
|&lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;
|Matches the preceding element zero or more times. For example, &lt;code&gt;ab*c&lt;/code&gt; matches &quot;''ac''&quot;, &quot;''abc''&quot;, &quot;''abbbc''&quot;, etc. &lt;code&gt;[xyz]*&lt;/code&gt; matches &quot;&quot;, &quot;''x''&quot;, &quot;''y''&quot;, &quot;''z''&quot;, &quot;''zx''&quot;, &quot;''zyx''&quot;, &quot;''xyzzy''&quot;, and so on. &lt;code&gt;\(ab\)*&lt;/code&gt; matches &quot;&quot;, &quot;''ab''&quot;, &quot;''abab''&quot;, &quot;''ababab''&quot;, and so on.
|- valign=&quot;top&quot;
|{{nowrap|BRE: &lt;code&gt;\{''m'',''n''\}&lt;/code&gt;}}&lt;br /&gt;{{nowrap|ERE: &lt;code&gt;{''m'',''n''}&lt;/code&gt;}}
|Matches the preceding element at least ''m'' and not more than ''n'' times. For example, &lt;code&gt;a\{3,5\}&lt;/code&gt; matches only &quot;''aaa''&quot;, &quot;''aaaa''&quot;, and &quot;''aaaaa''&quot;. This is not found in a few older instances of regular expressions.
|-
|}

'''Examples:'''
*&lt;code&gt;.at&lt;/code&gt; matches any three-character string ending with &quot;at&quot;, including &quot;''hat''&quot;, &quot;''cat''&quot;, and &quot;''bat''&quot;.
*&lt;code&gt;[hc]at&lt;/code&gt; matches &quot;''hat''&quot; and &quot;''cat''&quot;.
*&lt;code&gt;[^b]at&lt;/code&gt; matches all strings matched by &lt;code&gt;.at&lt;/code&gt; except &quot;''bat''&quot;.
*&lt;code&gt;^[hc]at&lt;/code&gt; matches &quot;''hat''&quot; and &quot;''cat''&quot;, but only at the beginning of the string or line.
*&lt;code&gt;[hc]at$&lt;/code&gt; matches &quot;''hat''&quot; and &quot;''cat''&quot;, but only at the end of the string or line.
*&lt;code&gt;\[.\]&lt;/code&gt; matches any single character surrounded by &quot;[&quot; and &quot;]&quot; since the brackets are escaped, for example: &quot;''[a]''&quot; and &quot;''[b]''&quot;.

===Character classes===
The POSIX standard defines some classes or categories of characters as shown in the following table:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

'''Cashew Gravy'''

This [[Cookbook:Gravy|gravy]] is a thick cashew-based gravy that tastes great on vegetables--maybe it's more of a sauce than a gravy. I wouldn't put it on potatoes, although brown rice is good.

==Ingredients==

*&amp;frac12; thinly sliced [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
*&amp;frac12; thinly sliced [[Cookbook:Bell Pepper|bell pepper]]
*2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|T]] [[Cookbook:Peanut Oil|peanut oil]]
*[[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]] to taste
*[[Cookbook:Pepper|Pepper]] to taste
*2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|t]] [[Cookbook:White Wine|white wine]]
*1&amp;frac12; [[Cookbook:Cup|C]] [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]] or unsweetened [[Cookbook:Soy Milk|soy milk]]
*&amp;frac12; [[Cookbook:Cup|C]] cashew butter
*1 pinch [[Cookbook:Cayenne pepper|cayenne pepper]]

==Procedure==
Allow the cashew butter to come to room temperature, if refrigerated.

Saut&amp;eacute;e the onion and bell pepper in the peanut oil over low to medium heat with salt and pepper, until the onion begins to turn translucent and the bell pepper is soft. Add the wine and deglaze the pan. Add cayenne pepper.

Add the milk and heat through. Add the cashew butter by the spoonful and stir until incorporated and smooth. Gravy will appear lumpy at first, but will become smooth after a few minutes of stirring and simmering. Adjust the quantity of milk or cashew butter as necessary for desired consistency. Taste and add salt if necessary.

This gravy is excellent on [[Cookbook:Green Beans|green beans]] or other vegetables, or can be served over brown rice.

Cashew gravy is traditionally one way of making a creamy vegan sauce--use unsweetened soy milk instead of milk if a vegan recipe is desired.

Makes about 2 cups gravy.

      <comment>/* Else statements */ missing semicolon added and duplicate javascript tags removed.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== If statements ==
We can do so that some blocks of code should execute only if condition true. For it we should use &quot;if&quot; expression. Let's see example.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
n = 6;
if(n &gt; 0)print(&quot;n is positive&quot;);
&lt;/source&gt;

== Else statements ==
We also can make code block that should be executed only if condition false. For execute much commands just enclose it in '{' and '}'.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
n = -5;
if(n &gt; 0){
  print(&quot;n is positive&quot;);
}else{
  print(&quot;n is negative or zero&quot;);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

== Else if statements ==
Also we can set any number conditions and blocks of code for this conditions.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
n = 0;
if(n &gt; 0){
  print(&quot;n is positive&quot;);
}else if(n == 0){
  print(&quot;n is zero&quot;);
}else{
  print(&quot;n is negative&quot;);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

      <comment>/* Conjugated protein */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Proteins were first described by the Dutch chemist Gerhardus Johannes Mulder and named by the Swedish chemist Jöns Jakob Berzelius in 1838. Early nutritional scientists such as the German Carl von Voit believed that protein was the most important nutrient for maintaining the structure of the body, because it was generally believed that &quot;flesh makes flesh.&quot;

The amino acids in a polypeptide chain are linked by peptide bonds. Once linked in the protein chain, an individual amino acid is called a residue, and the linked series of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen atoms are known as the main chain or protein backbone. The peptide bond has two resonance forms that contribute some double-bond character and inhibit rotation around its axis, so that the alpha carbons are roughly coplanar. The other two dihedral angles in the peptide bond determine the local shape assumed by the protein backbone. The end of the protein with a free carboxyl group is known as the C-terminus or carboxy terminus, whereas the end with a free amino group is known as the N-terminus or amino terminus.

The words protein, polypeptide, and peptide are a little ambiguous and can overlap in meaning. Protein is generally used to refer to the complete biological molecule in a stable conformation, whereas peptide is generally reserved for a short amino acid oligomers often lacking a stable three-dimensional structure. However, the boundary between the two is not well defined and usually lies near 20–30 residues. Polypeptide can refer to any single linear chain of amino acids, usually regardless of length, but often implies an absence of a defined conformation&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Protein&amp;oldid=425576197&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Amino acids==

[[Image:amino-CORN.png|thumb|right|250px||CO-R-N rule]]

There are''' 22 standard''' amino acids, but only''' 21 are found in eukaryotes'''. Of the 22, 20 are directly encoded by the universal genetic code. Humans can synthesize 11 of these 20 from each other or from other molecules of intermediary metabolism. The other 9 must be consumed in the diet, and so are called essential amino acids; those are ''histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine.'' The remaining two, '''selenocysteine''' and '''pyrrolysine''', are incorporated into proteins by unique synthetic mechanisms.

Each α-amino acid consists of a backbone part that is present in all the amino acid types, and a side chain that is unique to each type of residue. An exception from this rule is proline, where the hydrogen atom is replaced by a bond to the side chain. Because the carbon atom is bound to four different groups it is chiral, however only one of the isomers occur in biological proteins. Glycine however, is not chiral since its side chain is a hydrogen atom. A simple mnemonic for correct L-form is &quot;CORN&quot;: when the Cα atom is viewed with the H in front, the residues read '''&quot;CO-R-N&quot;''' in a clockwise direction&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Proteinogenic_amino_acid&amp;oldid=420804587&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Isomerism'''

The standard '''α-amino acids''', all but glycine can exist in either of two optical isomers, called''' L or D amino acids''', which are mirror images of each other . While L-amino acids represent all of the amino acids found in proteins during translation in the ribosome, D-amino acids are found in some proteins produced by enzyme posttranslational modifications after translation and translocation to the endoplasmic reticulum, as in exotic sea-dwelling organisms such as cone snails. They are also abundant components of the peptidoglycan cell walls of bacteria, and '''D-serine may act as a neurotransmitter in the brain'''. The L and D convention for amino acid configuration refers not to the optical activity of the amino acid itself, but rather to the optical activity of the isomer of glyceraldehyde from which that amino acid can theoretically be synthesized (D-glyceraldehyde is dextrorotary; L-glyceraldehyde is levorotary). Alternatively, the (S) and (R) designators are used to indicate the absolute stereochemistry. Almost all of the amino acids in proteins are (S) at the α carbon, with cysteine being (R) and glycine non-chiral.Cysteine is unusual since it has a sulfur atom at the second position in its side-chain, which has a larger atomic mass than the groups attached to the first carbon which is attached to the α-carbon in the other standard amino acids, thus the (R) instead of (S)&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Amino_acid&amp;oldid=425389108&lt;/ref&gt;.



'''Zwitterions'''

The amine and carboxylic acid functional groups found in amino acids allow it to have amphiprotic properties. At a certain pH, known as the '''isoelectric point''', an amino acid has no overall charge since the number of protonated ammonia groups (positive charges) and deprotonated carboxylate groups (negative charges) are equal. The amino acids all have different '''isoelectric points'''. The ions produced at the isoelectric point have both positive and negative charges and are known as a zwitterion, which comes from the German word Zwitter meaning &quot;hermaphrodite&quot; or &quot;hybrid&quot;. Amino acids can exist as '''zwitterions in solids and in polar solutions such as water''', but '''not in the gas''' phase. Zwitterions have minimal solubility at their isolectric point and an amino acid can be isolated by precipitating it from water by adjusting the pH to its particular isoelectric point&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Amino_acid&amp;oldid=425389108&lt;/ref&gt;.


The 20 naturally occurring amino acids have different physical and chemical properties, including their electrostatic charge, pKa, hydrophobicity, size and specific functional groups. These properties play a major role in molding protein structure. The salient features of amino acids are described below in the table.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
! Amino Acid
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; | Abbrev.
! Remarks
|-
! [[Alanine]][[Image:L-alanine-3D-balls.png|thumb|170px]]
| A
| Ala
| Very abundant, very versatile. More stiff than glycine, but small enough to pose only small steric limits for the protein conformation. It behaves fairly neutrally, and can be located in both hydrophilic regions on the protein outside and the hydrophobic areas inside.
|-
! [[Asparagine]] or [[aspartic acid]]
| B
| Asx
| A placeholder when either amino acid may occupy a position.
|-
! [[Cysteine]][[Image:L-cysteine-3D-balls2.png|thumb|170px]]
| C
| Cys
| The sulfur atom bonds readily to [[heavy metals|heavy metal]] ions. Under oxidizing conditions, two cysteines can join together in a [[disulfide bond]] to form the amino acid [[cystine]]. When cystines are part of a protein, [[insulin]] for example, the [[tertiary structure]] is stabilized, which makes the protein more resistant to [[denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturation]]; therefore, disulfide bonds are common in proteins that have to function in harsh environments including digestive enzymes (e.g., [[pepsin]] and [[chymotrypsin]]) and structural proteins (e.g., [[keratin]]). Disulfides are also found in peptides too small to hold a stable shape on their own (eg. [[insulin]]).
|-
! [[Aspartic acid]][[Image:L-aspartic-acid-3D-balls.png|thumb|170px]]
| D
| Asp
| Behaves similarly to glutamic acid. Carries a hydrophilic acidic group with strong negative charge. Usually is located on the outer surface of the protein, making it water-soluble. Binds to positively-charged molecules and ions, often used in enzymes to fix the metal ion. When located inside of the protein, aspartate and glutamate are usually paired with arginine and lysine.
|-
! [[Glutamic acid]][[Image:L-glutamic-acid-3D-sticks2.png|thumb|170px]]
| E
| Glu
| Behaves similar to aspartic acid. Has longer, slightly more flexible side chain.
|-
! [[Phenylalanine]][[ Image: L-phenylalanine-3D-balls.png|thumb|170px]]
| F
| Phe
| [[essential amino acid|Essential]] for humans. Phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan contain large rigid [[aromaticity|aromatic]] group on the side-chain. These are the biggest amino acids. Like isoleucine, leucine and valine, these are hydrophobic and tend to orient towards the interior of the folded protein molecule. Phenylalanine can be converted into Tyrosine.
|-
! [[Glycine]][[Image:Glycine-3D-balls.png|thumb|170px]]
| G
| Gly
| Because of the two hydrogen atoms at the α carbon, glycine is not [[optical isomerism|optically active]]. It is the smallest amino acid, rotates easily, adds flexibility to the protein chain. It is able to fit into the tightest spaces, e.g., the triple helix of [[collagen]]. As too much flexibility is usually not desired, as a structural component it is less common than alanine.
|-
! [[Histidine]][[Image:L-histidine-zwitterion-from-xtal-1993-3D-balls-B.png|thumb|170px]]
| H
| His
| In even slightly acidic conditions [[protonation]] of the nitrogen occurs, changing the properties of histidine and the polypeptide as a whole.  It is used by many proteins as a regulatory mechanism, changing the conformation and behavior of the polypeptide in acidic regions such as the late [[endosome]] or [[lysosome]], enforcing conformation change in enzymes. However only a few histidines are needed for this, so it is comparatively scarce.
|-
! [[Isoleucine]][[Image:L-isoleucine-3D-balls.png|thumb|170px]]
| I
| Ile
| [[essential amino acid|Essential]] for humans. Isoleucine, leucine and valine have large aliphatic hydrophobic side chains. Their molecules are rigid, and their mutual hydrophobic interactions are important for the correct folding of proteins, as these chains tend to be located inside of the protein molecule.
|-
! [[Leucine]] or [[isoleucine]]
| J
| Xle
| A placeholder when either amino acid may occupy a position
|-
! [[Lysine]][[Image:L-lysine-monocation-from-hydrochloride-dihydrate-xtal-3D-balls.png|thumb|170px]]
| K
| Lys
| [[essential amino acid|Essential]] for humans. Behaves similarly to arginine. Contains a long flexible side-chain with a positively-charged end. The flexibility of the chain makes lysine and arginine suitable for binding to molecules with many negative charges on their surfaces. E.g., [[deoxyribonucleic acid|DNA]]-binding proteins have their active regions rich with arginine and lysine. The strong charge makes these two amino acids prone to be located on the outer hydrophilic surfaces of the proteins; when they are found inside, they are usually paired with a corresponding negatively-charged amino acid, e.g., aspartate or glutamate.
|-
! [[Leucine]][[Image:L-leucine-3D-balls.png|thumb|170px]]
| L
| Leu
| [[essential amino acid|Essential]] for humans. Behaves similar to isoleucine and valine. See isoleucine.
|-
! [[Methionine]][[Image: L-methionine-B-3D-balls.png|thumb|170px]]
| M
| Met
| [[essential amino acid|Essential]] for humans. Always the first amino acid to be incorporated into a protein; sometimes removed after translation. Like cysteine, contains sulfur, but with a [[methyl]] group instead of hydrogen. This methyl group can be activated, and is used in many reactions where a new carbon atom is being added to another molecule.
|-
! [[Asparagine]][[Image: L-asparagine-3D-balls.png|thumb|170px]]
| N
| Asn
| Similar to aspartic acid. Asn contains an [[amide]] group where Asp has a [[carboxyl]].
|-
! [[Pyrrolysine]]
| O
| Pyl
| Similar to [[lysine]], with a [[pyrroline]] ring attached.  
|-
! [[Proline]][[Image: L-proline-3D-balls.png|thumb|170px]]
| P
| Pro
| Contains an unusual ring to the N-end amine group, which forces the CO-NH amide sequence into a fixed conformation. Can disrupt protein folding structures like [[alpha helix|α helix]] or [[beta sheet|β sheet]], forcing the desired kink in the protein chain. Common in [[collagen]], where it often undergoes a [[posttranslational modification]] to [[hydroxyproline]].
|-
! [[Glutamine]][[Image:L-glutamine-3D-sticks.png|thumb|170px]]
| Q
| Gln
| Similar to glutamic acid. Gln contains an [[amide]] group where Glu has a [[carboxyl]]. Used in proteins and as a storage for [[ammonia]]. The most abundant Amino Acid in the body.
|-
! [[Arginine]][[ Image: L-arginine-3D-hztl.png|thumb|170px]]
| R
| Arg
| Functionally similar to lysine.
|-
! [[Serine]][[Image:L-serine-3D-balls.png|thumb|170px]]
| S
| Ser
| Serine and threonine have a short group ended with a [[hydroxyl]] group. Its hydrogen is easy to remove, so serine and threonine often act as hydrogen donors in enzymes. Both are very hydrophilic, therefore the outer regions of soluble proteins tend to be rich with them.
|-
! [[Threonine]][[Image: L-Threonine-3D-balls.png|thumb|170px]]
| T
| Thr
| [[essential amino acid|Essential]] for humans. Behaves similarly to serine.
|-
! [[Selenocysteine]]
| U
| Sec
| [[Selenium|Selenated]] form of cysteine, which replaces [[sulfur]]. 
|-
! [[Valine]][[Image:L-valine-3D-balls.png|thumb|170px]]
| V
| Val
| [[essential amino acid|Essential]] for humans. Behaves similarly to isoleucine and leucine. See isoleucine.
|-
! [[Tryptophan]][[Image: L-tryptophan-3D-balls.png|thumb|170px]]
| W
| Trp
| [[essential amino acid|Essential]] for humans. Behaves similarly to phenylalanine and tyrosine (see phenylalanine). Precursor of [[serotonin]]. Naturally [[fluorescent]].
|-
! Unknown
| X
| Xaa
| Placeholder when the amino acid is unknown or unimportant.
|-
! [[Tyrosine]][[Image: L-tyrosine-3D-sticks.png|thumb|170px]]
| Y
| Tyr
| Behaves similarly to phenylalanine (precursor to Tyrosine) and tryptophan (see phenylalanine). Precursor of [[melanin]], [[epinephrine]], and [[thyroid hormone]]s. Naturally [[fluorescent]], although fluorescence is usually quenched by energy transfer to tryptophans.
|-
! [[Glutamic acid]] or [[glutamine]]
| Z
| Glx
| A placeholder when either amino acid may occupy a position.

===Classification of aminoacids===
The 20 amino acids encoded directly by the genetic code can be divided into several groups based on their properties. Important factors are charge, hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity, size and functional groups.Amino acids are usually classified by the properties of their side chain into four groups. The side chain can make an amino acid a weak acid or a weak base, and a hydrophile if the side chain is polar or a hydrophobe if it is nonpolar.

[[Image:a-amino-acid.png|thumb|150px|An α-amino acid. The C&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;H atom is omitted in the diagram.]]
Protein amino acids are combined into a single [[polypeptide chain]] in a [[condensation reaction]]. This reaction is [[catalysis|catalysed]] by the [[ribosome]] in a process known as [[peptide biosynthesis|translation]].

Bortezomib is [[pyrazinoic acid|Pyz]]-Phe-boroLeu and MG132 is [[Carboxybenzyl|Z]]-Leu-Leu-Leu-al. Additionally, To aid in the analysis of protein structure, [[Photo-reactive amino acid analog|photocrosslinking amino acid analogues]] are available.

==Peptide bond==

[[Image:Peptidformationball.svg|thumbnail|right|400px|The condensation of two amino acids to form a [[peptide bond]]|alt=Two amino acids are shown next to each other. One loses a hydrogen and oxygen from its carboxyl group (COOH) and the other loses a hydrogen from its amino group (NH2). This reaction produces a molecule of water (H2O) and two amino acids joined by a peptide bond (-CO-NH-). The two joined amino acids are called a dipeptide.]]



A peptide bond (amide bond) is a covalent chemical bond formed between two molecules when the carboxyl group of one molecule reacts with the amino group of the other molecule, thereby releasing a molecule of water (H2O). This is a dehydration synthesis reaction (also known as a condensation reaction), and usually occurs between amino acids. The resulting C(O)NH bond is called a peptide bond, and the resulting molecule is an amide. The four-atom functional group -C(=O)NH- is called a peptide link. Polypeptides and proteins are chains of amino acids held together by peptide bonds, as is the backbone of PNA.



A peptide bond can be broken by amide hydrolysis (the adding of water). The peptide bonds in proteins are metastable, meaning that in the presence of water they will break spontaneously, releasing 2-4 kcal/mol of free energy, but this process is extremely slow. In living organisms, the process is facilitated by enzymes. Living organisms also employ enzymes to form peptide bonds; this process requires free energy. The wavelength of absorbance for a peptide bond is 190-230 nm.

The peptide bond tend to be planar due to the delocalization of the electrons from the double bond. The rigid peptide dihedral angle, ω (the bond between C1 and N) is always close to 180 degrees. The dihedral angles phi φ (the bond between N and Cα) and psi ψ (the bond between Cα and C1) can have a certain range of possible values. These angles are the internal degrees of freedom of a protein, they control the protein's conformation. They are restrained by geometry to allowed ranges typical for particular secondary structure elements, and represented in a Ramachandran plot. A few important bond lengths are given in the table below&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Peptide_bond&amp;oldid=417601014&lt;/ref&gt;.

===β-peptides ===



In α amino acids (molecule at left), both the [[carboxylic acid]] group (red) and the [[amino]] group (blue) are bonded to the same carbon center, termed the α carbon (&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{C}^{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;) because it is one atom away from the carboxylate group.  In β amino acids, the amino group is bonded to the β carbon (&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{C}^{\beta}&lt;/math&gt;), which is found in most of the 20 standard amino acids.  Only [[glycine]] lacks a β carbon, which means that β-glycine is not possible.

The chemical synthesis of β amino acids can be challenging, especially given the diversity of [[functional group]]s bonded to the β carbon and the necessity of maintaining [[Chirality (chemistry)|chirality]]. In the [[alanine]] molecule shown, the β carbon is achiral; however, most larger amino acids have a chiral &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{C}^{\beta}&lt;/math&gt; atom. A number of synthesis mechanisms have been introduced to efficiently form β amino acids and their derivatives&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Basler B, Schuster O, Bach T |title=Conformationally constrained β-amino acid derivatives by intramolecular [2 + 2]-photocycloaddition of a tetronic acid amide and subsequent lactone ring opening |journal=J.

Two main types of β-peptides exist: those with the organic residue (R) next to the amine are called β&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-peptides and those with position next to the carbonyl group are called β&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-peptides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Seebach D, Matthews JL |title=β-Peptides: a surprise at every turn |journal=[[Chem.

==Enzymes==

Enzymes are generally globular proteins and range from just 62 amino acid residues in size, for the monomer of 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase, to over 2,500 residues in the animal fatty acid synthase. A small number of RNA-based biological catalysts exist, with the most common being the ribosome; these are referred to as either RNA-enzymes or ribozymes. The activities of enzymes are determined by their three-dimensional structure. However, although structure does determine function, predicting a novel enzyme's activity just from its structure is a very difficult problem that has not yet been solved.

Most enzymes are much larger than the substrates they act on, and only a small portion of the enzyme (around 3–4 amino acids) is directly involved in catalysis. The region that contains these catalytic residues, binds the substrate, and then carries out the reaction is known as the active site. Enzymes can also contain sites that bind cofactors, which are needed for catalysis. Some enzymes also have binding sites for small molecules, which are often direct or indirect products or substrates of the reaction catalyzed. This binding can serve to increase or decrease the enzyme's activity, providing a means for feedback regulation.
Like all proteins, enzymes are long, linear chains of amino acids that fold to produce a three-dimensional product. Each unique amino acid sequence produces a specific structure, which has unique properties. Individual protein chains may sometimes group together to form a protein complex. Most enzymes can be denatured—that is, unfolded and inactivated—by heating or chemical denaturants, which disrupt the three-dimensional structure of the protein. Depending on the enzyme, denaturation may be reversible or irreversible.
Structures of enzymes in complex with substrates or substrate analogs during a reaction may be obtained using Time resolved crystallography methods&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Enzyme&amp;oldid=424282616&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Classification of enzymes===
An enzyme's name is often derived from its substrate or the chemical reaction it catalyzes, with the word ending in -ase. Examples are lactase, alcohol dehydrogenase and DNA polymerase. This may result in different enzymes, called isozymes, with the same function having the same basic name. Isoenzymes have a different amino acid sequence and might be distinguished by their optimal pH, kinetic properties or immunologically. Isoenzyme and isozyme are homologous proteins. Furthermore, the normal physiological reaction an enzyme catalyzes may not be the same as under artificial conditions. This can result in the same enzyme being identified with two different names. E.g. Glucose isomerase, used industrially to convert glucose into the sweetener fructose, is a xylose isomerase in vivo.
 
The '''International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology''' have developed a nomenclature for enzymes, the EC numbers.
The '''Enzyme Commission number (EC number)''' is a numerical classification scheme for enzymes, based on the chemical reactions they catalyze. As a system of enzyme nomenclature, every EC number is associated with a recommended name for the respective enzyme.
Each enzyme is described by a sequence of four numbers preceded by &quot;EC&quot;. The first number broadly classifies the enzyme based on its mechanism.
Strictly speaking, EC numbers do not specify enzymes, but enzyme-catalyzed reactions. If different enzymes (for instance from different organisms) catalyze the same reaction, then they receive the same EC number. By contrast, UniProt identifiers uniquely specify a protein by its amino acid sequence&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Enzyme&amp;oldid=424282616&lt;/ref&gt;.



EC 1 Oxidoreductases: catalyze oxidation/reduction reactions

EC 2 Transferases: transfer a functional group (e.g. a methyl or phosphate group)

EC 3 Hydrolases: catalyze the hydrolysis of various bonds

EC 4 Lyases: cleave various bonds by means other than hydrolysis and oxidation

EC 5 Isomerases: catalyze isomerization changes within a single molecule

EC 6 Ligases: join two molecules with covalent bonds.

===Oxidoreductase===
In molecular biology and biochemistry, an oxidoreductase is an enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of electrons from one molecule (the reductant, also called the hydrogen or electron donor) to another (the oxidant, also called the hydrogen or electron acceptor). This group of enzymes usually utilizes NADP or NAD as cofactors.
In general, polypeptides are unbranched polymers, so their primary structure can often be specified by the sequence of amino acids along their backbone. However, proteins can become cross-linked, most commonly by disulfide bonds, and the primary structure also requires specifying the cross-linking atoms, e.g., specifying the cysteines involved in the protein's disulfide bonds. Other crosslinks include desmosine...
The chiral centers of a polypeptide chain can undergo racemization. In particular, the L-amino acids normally found in proteins can spontaneously isomerize at the Cα atom to form D-amino acids, which cannot be cleaved by most proteases&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Enzyme&amp;oldid=424282616&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Primary structure of protein===

The proposal that proteins were linear chains of α-amino acids was made nearly simultaneously by two scientists at the same conference in 1902, the 74th meeting of the Society of German Scientists and Physicians, held in Karlsbad. '''Franz Hofmeister made''' the proposal in the morning, based on his observations of the biuret reaction in proteins. Hofmeister was followed a few hours later by '''Emil Fischer''', who had amassed a wealth of chemical details supporting the peptide-bond model. For completeness, the proposal that proteins contained amide linkages was made as early as 1882 by the French chemist '''E. Grimaux'''&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Protein_primary_structure&amp;oldid=415921787&lt;/ref&gt;.

Despite these data and later evidence that proteolytically digested proteins yielded only oligopeptides, the idea that proteins were linear, unbranched polymers of amino acids was not accepted immediately. Some well-respected scientists such as William Astbury doubted that covalent bonds were strong enough to hold such long molecules together; they feared that thermal agitations would shake such long molecules asunder. Hermann Staudinger faced similar prejudices in the 1920s when he argued that rubber was composed of macromolecules.
Thus, several alternative hypotheses arose. The '''colloidal protein hypothesis''' stated that proteins were colloidal assemblies of smaller molecules. This hypothesis was disproved in the 1920s by ultracentrifugation measurements by Theodor Svedberg that showed that proteins had a well-defined, reproducible molecular weight and by electrophoretic measurements by Arne Tiselius that indicated that proteins were single molecules. 

A second hypothesis, the '''cyclol hypothesis''' advanced by Dorothy Wrinch, proposed that the linear polypeptide underwent a chemical cyclol rearrangement C=O + HN  C(OH)-N that crosslinked its backbone amide groups, forming a two-dimensional fabric. Other primary structures of proteins were proposed by various researchers, such as the diketopiperazine model of Emil Abderhalden and the pyrrol/piperidine model of Troensegaard in 1942. Although never given much credence, these alternative models were finally disproved when Frederick Sanger successfully sequenced insulin and by the crystallographic determination of myoglobin and hemoglobin by Max Perutz and John Kendrew.

The primary structure of peptides and proteins refers to the linear sequence of its amino acid structural units. The term &quot;primary structure&quot; was first coined by Linderstrøm-Lang in 1951. By convention, the primary structure of a protein is reported starting from the amino-terminal (N) end to the carboxyl-terminal (C) end. The post-translational modifications of protein such as disulfide formation, phosphorylations and glycosylations are usually also considered a part of the primary structure, and cannot be read from the gene.

===Secondary structure of protein===
[[Image:1GZX Haemoglobin.png|thumb|right|200px|The [[Hemoglobin]] molecule has four heme-binding subunits, each largely made of alpha helices.]]
Secondary structure refers to highly regular local sub-structures. Two main types of secondary structure, the [[alpha helix]] and the [[beta strand]], were suggested in 1951 by '''Linus Pauling'''' and coworkers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pauling1951&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Pauling L, Corey RB, Branson HR |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |year=1951 |volume=37 |issue=4 |pages=205–211 |title=The structure of proteins; two hydrogen-bonded helical configurations of the polypeptide chain |pmid=14816373 |doi=10.1073/pnas.37.4.205 |pmc=1063337}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These secondary structures are defined by patterns of [[hydrogen bonds]] between the main-chain peptide groups. They have a regular geometry, being constrained to specific values of the dihedral angles ψ and φ on the [[Ramachandran plot]]. Both the alpha helix and the beta-sheet represent a way of saturating all the hydrogen bond donors and acceptors in the peptide backbone. Some parts of the protein are ordered but do not form any regular structures. They should not be confused with [[random coil]], an unfolded polypeptide chain lacking any fixed three-dimensional structure.  Several sequential secondary structures may form a &quot;[[supersecondary structure|supersecondary unit]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ChiangYS2007&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Chiang YS, Gelfand TI, Kister AE, Gelfand IM |title=New classification of supersecondary structures of sandwich-like proteins uncovers strict patterns of strand assemblage. |journal=Proteins. |volume=68 |issue=4 |pages=915–921 |year=2007 |pmid=17557333 |doi=10.1002/prot.21473}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amino acids vary in their ability to form the various secondary structure elements. Proline and glycine are sometimes known as &quot;helix breakers&quot; because they disrupt the regularity of the α helical backbone conformation; however, both have unusual conformational abilities and are commonly found in turns. Amino acids that prefer to adopt helical conformations in proteins include methionine, alanine, leucine, glutamate and lysine (&quot;MALEK&quot; in amino-acid 1-letter codes); by contrast, the large aromatic residues (tryptophan, tyrosine and phenylalanine) and Cβ-branched amino acids (isoleucine, valine, and threonine) prefer to adopt β-strand conformations. However, these preferences are not strong enough to produce a reliable method of predicting secondary structure from sequence alone.Secondary structure in proteins consists of local inter-residue interactions mediated by hydrogen bonds, or not. The most common secondary structures are alpha helices and beta sheets. Other helices, such as the 310 helix and π helix, are calculated to have energetically favorable hydrogen-bonding patterns but are rarely if ever observed in natural proteins except at the ends of α helices due to unfavorable backbone packing in the center of the helix.

{{quotation|A '''Ramachandran plot''' (also known as a ''Ramachandran map or a Ramachandran diagram'' or a [φ,ψ] plot), developed by Gopalasamudram Narayana Ramachandran and Viswanathan Sasisekharan is a way to visualize dihedral angles ψ against φ of amino acid residues in protein structure. &lt;ref&gt; RAMACHANDRAN GN, RAMAKRISHNAN C, SASISEKHARAN V (July 1963). &quot;Stereochemistry of polypeptide chain configurations&quot;. J. Mol. Biol. 7: 95–9&lt;/ref&gt;. It shows the possible conformations of ψ and φ angles for a polypeptide.



Mathematically, the Ramachandran plot is the visualization of a function &lt;math&gt;f: \left[-\pi,\pi\right) \times \left[-\pi,\pi\right) \rightarrow \mathbb{R_{{}+{}}}&lt;/math&gt;. The domain of this function is the torus. Hence, the conventional Ramachandran plot is a projection of the torus on the plane, resulting in a distorted view and the presence of discontinuities.
One would expect that larger side chains would result in more restrictions and consequently a smaller allowable region in the Ramachandran plot. In practice this does not appear to be the case; only the methylene group at the α position has an influence. Glycine has a hydrogen atom, with a smaller van der Waals radius, instead of a methyl group at the α position. Hence it is least restricted and this is apparent in the Ramachandran plot for glycine for which the allowable area is considerably larger.
In contrast, the Ramachandran plot for proline shows only a very limited number of possible combinations of ψ and φ.
The Ramachandran plot was calculated just before the first protein structures at atomic resolution were determined. Forty years later there were tens of thousands of high-resolution protein structures determined by X-ray crystallography and deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). From one thousand different protein chains, Ramachandran plots of over 200 000 amino acids were plotted, showing some significant differences, especially for glycine (Hovmöller et al. 2002). The upper left region was found to be split into two; one to the left containing amino acids in beta sheets and one to the right containing the amino acids in random coil of this conformation.
One can also plot the dihedral angles in polysaccharides and other polymers in this fashion. For the first two protein side-chain dihedral angles a similar plot is the Janin Plot.}}


'''α helix'''

The amino acids in an α helix are arranged in a right-handed helical structure where each amino acid residue corresponds to a 100° turn in the helix (i.e., the helix has 3.6 residues per turn), and a translation of 1.5 Å (0.15 nm) along the helical axis. (Short pieces of left-handed helix sometimes occur with a large content of achiral glycine amino acids, but are unfavorable for the other normal, biological L-amino acids.) The pitch of the alpha-helix (the vertical distance between one consecutive turn of the helix) is 5.4 Å (0.54 nm) which is the product of 1.5 and 3.6. What is most important is that the N-H group of an amino acid forms a hydrogen bond with the C=O group of the amino acid four residues earlier; this repeated  hydrogen bonding is the most prominent characteristic of an α-helix. Official international nomenclature specifies two ways of defining α-helices, rule 6.2 in terms of repeating φ,ψ torsion angles  and rule 6.3 in terms of the combined pattern of pitch and hydrogen bonding. Different amino-acid sequences have different propensities for forming α-helical structure. Methionine, alanine, leucine, uncharged glutamate, and lysine (&quot;MALEK&quot; in the amino-acid 1-letter codes) all have especially high helix-forming propensities, whereas proline and glycine have poor helix-forming propensities. Proline either breaks or kinks a helix, both because it cannot donate an amide hydrogen bond (having no amide hydrogen), and also because its sidechain interferes sterically with the backbone of the preceding turn - inside a helix, this forces a bend of about 30° in the helix axis.[9] However, proline is often seen as the first residue of a helix, presumably due to its structural rigidity. At the other extreme, glycine also tends to disrupt helices because its high conformational flexibility makes it entropically expensive to adopt the relatively constrained α-helical structure&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alpha_helix&amp;oldid=423162580&lt;/ref&gt;.
[[Image:Beta hairpin.png|thumb|right|130px|Representation of a [[beta hairpin]]]]
[[Image:Anthrax toxin protein key motif.svg|right|thumb|200px|Greek-key motif in protein structure.]]
'''β sheet'''
The first β sheet structure was proposed by William Astbury in the 1930s. He proposed the idea of hydrogen bonding between the peptide bonds of parallel or antiparallel extended β strands. However, Astbury did not have the necessary data on the bond geometry of the amino acids in order to build accurate models, especially since he did not then know that the peptide bond was planar. A refined version was proposed by Linus Pauling and Robert Corey in 1951.

The β sheet (also β-pleated sheet) is the second form of regular secondary structure in proteins, only somewhat less common than alpha helix. Beta sheets consist of beta strands connected laterally by at least two or three backbone hydrogen bonds, forming a generally twisted, pleated sheet. A beta strand (also β strand) is a stretch of polypeptide chain typically 3 to 10 amino acids long with backbone in an almost fully extended conformation. 

A very simple [[structural motif]] involving β sheets is the [[beta hairpin|β hairpin]], in which two antiparallel strands are linked by a short loop of two to five residues, of which one is frequently a [[glycine]] or a [[proline]], both of which can assume the unusual dihedral-angle conformations required for a tight [[turn (biochemistry)|turn]]. However, individual strands can also be linked in more elaborate ways with long loops that may contain [[alpha helix|alpha helices]] or even entire protein domains.

''Greek key motif''
The Greek key motif consists of four adjacent antiparallel strands and their linking loops. It consists of three antiparallel strands connected by hairpins, while the fourth is adjacent to the first and linked to the third by a longer loop. This type of structure forms easily during the protein folding process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://swissmodel.expasy.org/course/text/chapter4.htm Tertiary Protein Structure and Folds: section 4.3.2.1]. From [http://swissmodel.expasy.org/course/ Principles of Protein Structure, Comparative Protein Modelling, and Visualisation]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid8506258&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hutchinson EG, Thornton JM | title = The Greek key motif: extraction, classification and analysis | journal = Protein Eng. | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | pages = 233–45 | year = 1993 | month = April | pmid = 8506258 | doi = 10.1093/protein/6.3.233 | url = | issn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was named after a pattern common to Greek ornamental artwork (see [[meander (art)]]).


''The β-&amp;alpha;-β motif''
Due to the chirality of their component amino acids, all strands exhibit a &quot;right-handed&quot; twist evident in most higher-order β sheet structures. In particular, the linking loop between two parallel strands almost always has a right-handed crossover chirality, which is strongly favored by the inherent twist of the sheet. This linking loop frequently contains a helical region, in which case it is called a [[beta-alpha-beta|β-α-β]] motif. A closely related motif called a β-α-β-α motif forms the basic component of the most commonly observed protein [[tertiary structure]], the [[TIM barrel]].


''β-meander motif''
A simple [[structural motif|supersecondary]] protein topology composed of 2 or more consecutive antiparallel β-strands linked together by [[beta hairpin|hairpin]] loops.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/scop/data/scop.b.c.bbf.html SCOP: Fold: WW domain-like&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cryst.bbk.ac.uk/PPS2/course/section9/sss/super2.html PPS '96 - Super Secondary Structure&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  This motif is common in β-sheets and can be found in several structural architectures including [[beta barrel|β-barrels]] and [[beta propeller|β-propellers]].

''Psi-loop motif''
The psi-loop, Ψ-loop, motif consists of two antiparallel strands with one strand in between that is connected to both by hydrogen bonds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hutchinson |first=E. |authorlink= |coauthors=Thornton, J. |year=1996 |month= |title=PROMOTIF—A program to identify and analyze structural motifs in proteins |journal=Protein Science |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=212–220 |pmid=8745398 |url= |accessdate= |quote= |pmc=2143354 |doi=10.1002/pro.5560050204 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are four possible strand topologies for single Ψ-loops as cited by Hutchinson ''et al.'' (1990).  This motif is rare as the process resulting in its formation seems unlikely to occur during protein folding. The Ψ-loop was first identified in the [[aspartic acid protease|aspartic protease]] family.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid2281084&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hutchinson EG, Thornton JM | title = HERA--a program to draw schematic diagrams of protein secondary structures | journal = Proteins | volume = 8 | issue = 3 | pages = 203–12 | year = 1990 | pmid = 2281084 | doi = 10.1002/prot.340080303 | url = | issn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Coiled coils'''

The possibility of coiled coils for α-keratin was proposed by Francis Crick in 1952 as well as mathematical methods for determining their structure. Remarkably, this was soon after the structure of the alpha helix was suggested in 1951 by Linus Pauling and coworkers.

Coiled coils usually contain a repeated pattern, ''hxxhcxc'', of hydrophobic (h) and charged (c) amino-acid residues, referred to as a heptad repeat. The positions in the heptad repeat are usually labeled abcdefg, where a and d are the hydrophobic positions, often being occupied by isoleucine, leucine or valine. Folding a sequence with this repeating pattern into an alpha-helical secondary structure causes the hydrophobic residues to be presented as a 'stripe' that coils gently around the helix in left-handed fashion, forming an amphipathic structure. The most favorable way for two such helices to arrange themselves in the water-filled environment of the cytoplasm is to wrap the hydrophobic strands against each other sandwiched between the hydrophilic amino acids. It is thus the burial of hydrophobic surfaces, that provides the thermodynamic driving force for the oligomerization. The packing in a coiled-coil interface is exceptionally tight, with almost complete van der Waals contact between the side chains of the a and d residues. This tight packing was originally predicted by '''Francis Crick in 1952''' and is referred to as Knobs into holes packing.
The α-helices may be parallel or anti-parallel, and usually adopt a left-handed super-coil. Although disfavored, a few right-handed coiled coils have also been observed in nature and in designed proteins&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Coiled_coil&amp;oldid=427735447&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[Image:ProteinStructures.png|thumb|The four levels of protein structure, from top to bottom: primary structure, secondary structure (β-sheet left, right α-helix), tertiary and quaternary structure.]]

===Tertiary structure of protein===
Tertiary structure is considered to be largely determined by the protein's primary structure - the sequence of amino acids of which it is composed. Efforts to predict tertiary structure from the primary structure are known generally as protein structure prediction. However, the environment in which a protein is synthesized and allowed to fold are significant determinants of its final shape and are usually not directly taken into account by current prediction methods. 

In globular proteins, tertiary interactions are frequently stabilized by the sequestration of hydrophobic amino acid residues in the protein core, from which water is excluded, and by the consequent enrichment of charged or hydrophilic residues on the protein's water-exposed surface. In secreted proteins that do not spend time in the cytoplasm, disulfide bonds between cysteine residues help to maintain the protein's tertiary structure. A variety of common and stable tertiary structures appear in a large number of proteins that are unrelated in both function and evolution - for example, many proteins are shaped like a TIM barrel, named for the enzyme triosephosphateisomerase. Another common structure is a highly stable dimeric coiled coil structure composed of 2-7 alpha helices.

The majority of protein structures known to date have been solved with the experimental technique of X-ray crystallography, which typically provides data of high resolution but provides no time-dependent information on the protein's conformational flexibility. A second common way of solving protein structures uses NMR, which provides somewhat lower-resolution data in general and is limited to relatively small proteins, but can provide time-dependent information about the motion of a protein in solution. Dual polarisation interferometry is a time resolved analytical method for determining the overall conformation and conformational changes in surface captured proteins providing complementary information to these high resolution methods. More is known about the tertiary structural features of soluble globular proteins than about membrane proteins because the latter class is extremely difficult to study using these methods&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Protein_tertiary_structure&amp;oldid=422486540&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Quaternary structure of proteins===

Several proteins are actually assemblies of more than '''one polypeptide chain''', which in the context of the larger assemblage are known as protein subunits. In addition to the tertiary structure of the subunits, multiple-subunit proteins possess a quaternary structure, which is the arrangement into which the subunits assemble. Enzymes composed of subunits with diverse functions are sometimes called holoenzymes, in which some parts may be known as regulatory subunits and the functional core is known as the catalytic subunit. Examples of proteins with quaternary structure include hemoglobin, DNA polymerase, and ion channels. Other assemblies referred to instead as multiprotein complexes also possess quaternary structure. Examples include '''nucleosomes and microtubules'''. 

Changes in quaternary structure can occur through conformational changes within individual subunits or through reorientation of the subunits relative to each other. It is through such changes, which underlie cooperativity and allostery in &quot;multimeric&quot; enzymes, that many proteins undergo regulation and perform their physiological function.
The above definition follows a classical approach to biochemistry, established at times when the distinction between a protein and a functional, proteinaceous unit was difficult to elucidate. More recently, people refer to protein-protein interaction when discussing quaternary structure of proteins and consider all assemblies of proteins as protein complexes&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_quaternary_structure&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Protein structure determination==
[[File:Myoglobin.png|thumb|left|[[Ribbon diagram]] of the structure of [[myoglobin]], showing colored [[alpha helix|alpha helices]]. Such [[protein]]s are long, linear [[molecule]]s with thousands of atoms; yet the relative position of each atom has been determined with sub-atomic resolution by X-ray crystallography. Since it is difficult to visualize all the atoms at once, the ribbon shows the rough path of the protein [[polymer]] from its N-terminus (blue) to its C-terminus (red).]]
Around 90% of the protein structures available in the Protein Data Bank have been determined by X-ray crystallography. This method allows one to measure the 3D density distribution of electrons in the protein (in the crystallized state) and thereby infer the 3D coordinates of all the atoms to be determined to a certain resolution. Roughly 9% of the known protein structures have been obtained by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance techniques. The secondary structure composition can be determined via circular dichroism or dual polarisation interferometry. Cryo-electron microscopy has recently become a means of determining protein structures to high resolution (less than 5 angstroms or 0.5 nanometer) and is anticipated to increase in power as a tool for high resolution work in the next decade. This technique is still a valuable resource for researchers working with very large protein complexes such as virus coat proteins and amyloid fibers.

===X-ray crystallography===
X-ray crystallography of biological molecules took off with [[Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin]], who solved the structures of [[cholesterol]] (1937), [[vitamin B12]] (1945) and [[penicillin]] (1954), for which she was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1964. In 1969, she succeeded in solving the structure of [[insulin]], on which she worked for over thirty years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Crowfoot Hodgkin D|authorlink=Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin|year = 1935|title=X-ray Single Crystal Photographs of Insulin|journal=Nature|volume=135|page=591|doi=10.1038/135591a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;


X-ray crystallography is a method of determining the arrangement of atoms within a crystal, in which a beam of X-rays strikes a crystal and diffracts into many specific directions.
Crystal structures of proteins (which are irregular and hundreds of times larger than cholesterol) began to be solved in the late 1950s, beginning with the structure of [[sperm whale]] [[myoglobin]] by [[Max Perutz]] and [[John Kendrew|Sir John Cowdery Kendrew]], for which they were awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1038/181662a0|volume=181|issue=4610|page=662|author=Kendrew J.

X-ray crystallography is now used routinely by scientists to determine how a pharmaceutical drug interacts with its protein target and what changes might improve it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Scapin G|title=Structural biology and drug discovery|journal=Curr.

===Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy or NMR===
Protein nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (usually abbreviated protein NMR) is a field of structural biology in which NMR spectroscopy is used to obtain information about the structure and dynamics of proteins. The field was pioneered by Richard R. Ernst and Kurt Wüthrich[1], among others. Protein NMR techniques are continually being used and improved in both academia and the biotech industry. Structure determination by NMR spectroscopy usually consists of several following phases, each using a separate set of highly specialized techniques. The sample is prepared, resonances are assigned, restraints are generated and a structure is calculated and validated

==How to sequence a protein?==

Protein sequencing is a technique to determine the amino acid sequence of a protein, as well as which conformation the protein adopts and the extent to which it is complexed with any non-peptide molecules. Discovering the structures and functions of proteins in living organisms is an important tool for understanding cellular processes, and allows drugs that target specific metabolic pathways to be invented more easily.
The two major direct methods of protein sequencing are '''mass spectrometry''' and the '''Edman degradation reaction'''. It is also possible to generate an amino acid sequence from the DNA or mRNA sequence encoding the protein, if this is known. However, there are a number of other reactions which can be used to gain more limited information about protein sequences and can be used as preliminaries to the aforementioned methods of sequencing or to overcome specific inadequacies within them&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Protein_sequencing&amp;oldid=413170994&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Edman degradation===
[[Image:EdmanDegradation.png|600px|right|Edman Degradation with generic amino acid peptide chain.]]
The Edman degradation is a very important reaction for protein sequencing, because it allows the ordered amino acid composition of a protein to be discovered. Automated Edman sequencers are now in widespread use, and are able to sequence peptides up to approximately 50 amino acids long. A reaction scheme for sequencing a protein by the Edman degradation follows - some of the steps are elaborated on subsequently.
Break any disulfide bridges in the protein with an oxidising agent like '''performic acid''' or reducing agent like '''2-mercaptoethanol'''. A protecting group such as iodoacetic acid may be necessary to prevent the bonds from re-forming.
Separate and purify the individual chains of the protein complex, if there are more than one.

Determine the amino acid composition of each chain.

Determine the terminal amino acids of each chain.

Break each chain into fragments under 50 amino acids long.

Separate and purify the fragments.

Determine the sequence of each fragment.

Repeat with a different pattern of cleavage.

Construct the sequence of the overall protein.

Digestion into peptide fragments Peptides longer than about 50-70 amino acids long cannot be sequenced reliably by the Edman degradation. Because of this, long protein chains need to be broken up into small fragments which can then be sequenced individually. Digestion is done either by endopeptidases such as trypsin or pepsin or by chemical reagents such as cyanogen bromide. Different enzymes give different cleavage patterns, and the overlap between fragments can be used to construct an overall sequence.

[[isothiocyanate|Phenylisothiocyanate]] is reacted with an uncharged terminal amino group, under mildly alkaline conditions, to form a cyclical ''phenylthiocarbamoyl'' derivative. Then, under [[acidic]] conditions, this derivative of the terminal amino acid is cleaved as a thiazolinone derivative. The thiazolinone amino acid is then selectively extracted into an organic solvent and treated with acid to form the more stable phenylthiohydantoin (PTH)- amino acid derivative that can be identified by using [[chromatography]] or [[electrophoresis]]. This procedure can then be repeated again to identify the next amino acid. A major drawback to this technique is that the peptides being sequenced in this manner cannot have more than 50 to 60 residues (and in practice, under 30). The peptide length is limited due to the cyclical derivitization not always going to completion. The derivitization problem can be resolved by cleaving large peptides into smaller peptides before proceeding with the reaction. It is able to accurately [[sequence]] up to 30 [[amino acids]] with modern machines capable of over 99% efficiency per [[amino acid]]. An advantage of the Edman degradation is that it only uses 10 - 100 [[pico]]moles of [[peptide]] for the sequencing process. Edman degradation reaction is automated to speed up the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Niall HD |title=Automated Edman degradation: the protein sequenator |journal=Meth. Enzymol. |volume=27 |issue= |pages=942–1010 |year=1973 |pmid=4773306 |doi= 10.1016/S0076-6879(73)27039-8|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Protein_sequencing&amp;oldid=413170994&lt;/ref&gt;

===N-terminal amino acid analysis===

Determining which amino acid forms the N-terminus of a peptide chain is useful for two reasons: to aid the ordering of individual peptide fragments' sequences into a whole chain, and because the first round of Edman degradation is often contaminated by impurities and therefore does not give an accurate determination of the N-terminal amino acid. A generalised method for N-terminal amino acid analysis follows:
React the peptide with a reagent which will selectively label the terminal amino acid.
Hydrolyse the protein.
Determine the amino acid by chromatography and comparison with standards.
There are many different reagents which can be used to label terminal amino acids. They all react with amine groups and will therefore also bind to amine groups in the side chains of amino acids such as lysine - for this reason it is necessary to be careful in interpreting chromatograms to ensure that the right spot is chosen. Two of the more common reagents are Sanger's reagent (1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene) and dansyl derivatives such as dansyl chloride. Phenylisothiocyanate, the reagent for the Edman degradation, can also be used. The same questions apply here as in the determination of amino acid composition, with the exception that no stain is needed, as the reagents produce coloured derivatives and only qualitative analysis is required, so the amino acid does not have to be eluted from the chromatography column, just compared with a standard. Another consideration to take into account is that, since any amine groups will have reacted with the labelling reagent, ion exchange chromatography cannot be used, and thin layer chromatography or high pressure liquid chromatography should be used instead&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Protein_sequencing&amp;oldid=413170994&lt;/ref&gt;.

===C-terminal amino acid analysis===

The number of methods available for C-terminal amino acid analysis is much smaller than the number of available methods of N-terminal analysis. The most common method is to add carboxypeptidases to a solution of the protein, take samples at regular intervals, and determine the terminal amino acid by analysing a plot of amino acid concentrations against time

===Mass spectrometry=== 

Present day researchers are using Mass spectrometry an important tool for the characterization of proteins. '''Protein mass spectrometry refers to the application of mass spectrometry to the study of proteins'''. The two primary methods for ionization of whole proteins are electrospray ionization (ESI) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI). In keeping with the performance and mass range of available mass spectrometers, two approaches are used for characterizing proteins. In the first, intact proteins are ionized by either of the two techniques described above, and then introduced to a mass analyzer. This approach is referred to as &quot;top-down&quot; strategy of protein analysis. In the second, proteins are enzymatically digested into smaller peptides using a protease such as trypsin. Subsequently these peptides are introduced into the mass spectrometer and identified by peptide mass fingerprinting or tandem mass spectrometry. Hence, this latter approach (also called &quot;bottom-up&quot; proteomics) uses identification at the peptide level to infer the existence of proteins.

Whole protein mass analysis is primarily conducted using either time-of-flight (TOF) MS, or '''Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance''' (FT-ICR). These two types of instrument are preferable here because of their wide mass range, and in the case of FT-ICR, its high mass accuracy. Mass analysis of proteolytic peptides is a much more popular method of protein characterization, as cheaper instrument designs can be used for characterization. Additionally, sample preparation is easier once whole proteins have been digested into smaller peptide fragments. The most widely used instrument for peptide mass analysis are the MALDI time-of-flight instruments as they permit the acquisition of peptide mass fingerprints (PMFs) at high pace (1 PMF can be analyzed in approx. 10 sec). Multiple stage quadrupole-time-of-flight and the quadrupole ion trap also find use in this application.

==Types of protein==
===Conjugated protein===
A conjugated protein is a protein that functions in interaction with other chemical groups attached by covalent bonds or by weak interactions.
Many proteins contain only amino acids and no other chemical groups, and they are called simple proteins. However, other kind of proteins yield, on hydrolysis, some other chemical component in addition to amino acids and they are called conjugated proteins. The nonamino part of a conjugated protein is usually called its prosthetic group. Most prosthetic groups are formed from vitamins. Conjugated proteins are classified on the basis of the chemical nature of their prosthetic groups.
Some examples of conjugated proteins are 

====Lipoproteins====
A lipoprotein is a biochemical assembly that contains both '''proteins''' and '''lipids''' water-bound to the proteins. Many enzymes, transporters, structural proteins, antigens, adhesins and toxins are lipoproteins. Examples include the high density (HDL) and low density (LDL) lipoproteins which enable fats to be carried in the blood stream, the transmembrane proteins of the mitochondrion and the chloroplast, and bacterial lipoproteins. 

====Glycoproteins====
Glycoproteins are proteins that contain oligosaccharide chains (glycans) covalently attached to polypeptide side-chains. The carbohydrate is attached to the protein in a cotranslational or posttranslational modification. This process is known as glycosylation. In proteins that have segments extending extracellularly, the extracellular segments are often glycosylated. Glycoproteins are often important integral membrane proteins, where they play a role in cell-cell interactions. Glycoproteins also occur in the cytosol, but their functions and the pathways producing these modifications in this compartment are less well-understood.'''Glycoproteins are generally the largest and most abundant group of conjugated proteins'''. They range from glycoproteins in cell surface membranes that constitute the glycocalyx, to important antibodies produced by leukocytes.

====phosphoproteins==== 

Phosphoproteins are proteins which are chemically bonded to a substance containing phosphoric acid (see phosphorylation for more). The category of organic molecules that includes Fc receptors, Ulks, Calcineurins, K chips, and urocortins.

====Metalloprotein====

A protein that contains a metal ion ass cofactor known as Metalloprotein. Metalloproteins have many different functions in cells, such as enzymes, transport and storage proteins, and signal transduction proteins. Indeed, about one quarter to one third of all proteins require metals to carry out their functions. The metal ion is usually coordinated by nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur atoms belonging to amino acids in the polypeptide chain and/or a macrocyclic ligand incorporated into the protein. The presence of the metal ion allows metalloenzymes to perform functions such as redox reactions that cannot easily be performed by the limited set of functional groups found in amino acids.

====hemoproteins====



A hemeprotein (or hemoprotein or haemoprotein), or heme protein, is a metalloprotein containing a heme prosthetic group, either covalently or noncovalently bound to the protein itself. The iron in the heme is capable of undergoing oxidation and reduction (usually to +2 and +3, though stabilized Fe+4 and even Fe+5 species are well known in the peroxidases).
Hemoproteins probably evolved from a primordial strategy allowing to incorporate the iron (Fe) atom contained within the protoporphyrin IX ring of heme into proteins. This strategy has been maintained throughout evolution as it makes hemoproteins responsive to molecules that can bind divalent iron (Fe). These molecules included, but are probably not restricted to, gaseous molecules, such as oxygen (O2) nitric oxide (NO), carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S). Once bound to the prosthetic heme groups of hemoproteins these gaseous molecules can modulate the activity/function of those hemoproteins in a way that is said to afford signal transduction. Therefore, when produced in biologic systems (cells), these gaseous molecules are referred to as gasotransmitters.'''Haemoglobin contains the prosthetic group containing iron''', which is the haem. It is with in the haem group that carries the oxygen molecule through the binding of the oxygen molecule to the iron ion (Fe2+) found in the haem group&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hemeprotein&amp;oldid=410476687&lt;/ref&gt;.


'''Hemoglobin'''
Hemoglobin (also spelled haemoglobin and abbreviated Hb or Hgb) is the iron-containing oxygen-transport metalloprotein in the red blood cells of all vertebrates[1] (except the fish family Channichthyidae ) and the tissues of some invertebrates. Hemoglobin in the blood is what transports oxygen from the lungs or gills to the rest of the body (i.e. the tissues) where it releases the oxygen for cell use, and collects carbon dioxide to bring it back to the lungs.
In mammals the protein makes up about 97% of the red blood cells' dry content, and around 35% of the total content (including water)[citation needed]. Hemoglobin has an oxygen binding capacity of 1.34 ml O2 per gram of hemoglobin, which increases the total blood oxygen capacity seventyfold.
Hemoglobin is involved in the transport of other gases: it carries some of the body's respiratory carbon dioxide (about 10% of the total) as carbaminohemoglobin, in which CO2 is bound to the globin protein. The molecule also carries the important regulatory molecule nitric oxide bound to a globin protein thiol group, releasing it at the same time as oxygen.
Hemoglobin is also found outside red blood cells and their progenitor lines. Other cells that contain hemoglobin include the A9 dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, macrophages, alveolar cells, and mesangial cells in the kidney. In these tissues, hemoglobin has a non-oxygen-carrying function as an antioxidant and a regulator of iron metabolism.
Hemoglobin and hemoglobin-like molecules are also found in many invertebrates, fungi, and plants. In these organisms, hemoglobins may carry oxygen, or they may act to transport and regulate other things such as carbon dioxide, nitric oxide, hydrogen sulfide and sulfide. A variant of the molecule, called leghemoglobin, is used to scavenge oxygen, to keep it from poisoning anaerobic systems, such as nitrogen-fixing nodules of leguminous plants.

'''Cytochromes''' 
[[Image:Cytochrome c.png|thumb|250px|Cytochrome ''c'' with heme ''c''.]]
Cytochromes are, in general, membrane-bound hemoproteins that contain heme groups and carry out electron transport.
They are found either as monomeric proteins (e.g., cytochrome c) or as subunits of bigger enzymatic complexes that catalyze redox reactions. They are found in the mitochondrial inner membrane and endoplasmic reticulum of eukaryotes, in the chloroplasts of plants, in photosynthetic microorganisms, and in bacteria.

====Opsins====
Opsins are a group of light-sensitive 35-55 kDa membrane-bound G protein-coupled receptors of the retinylidene protein family found in photoreceptor cells of the retina. Five classical groups of opsins are involved in vision, mediating the conversion of a photon of light into an electrochemical signal, the first step in the visual transduction cascade. Another opsin found in the mammalian retina, melanopsin, is involved in circadian rhythms and pupillary reflex but not in image-forming.

====Flavoproteins====
Flavoproteins are proteins that contain a nucleic acid derivative of riboflavin: the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) or flavin mononucleotide (FMN).
Flavoproteins are involved in a wide array of biological processes, including, but by no means limited to, bioluminescence, removal of radicals contributing to oxidative stress, photosynthesis, DNA repair, and apoptosis. The spectroscopic properties of the flavin cofactor make it a natural reporter for changes occurring within the active site; this makes flavoproteins one of the most-studied enzyme families.

===Simple proteins===
The proteins which upon hydrolysis yield only amino acids are known as simple proteins.

====Albumin====
Albumin (Latin: albus, white) refers generally to any protein that is water soluble, which is moderately soluble in concentrated salt solutions, and experiences heat denaturation. They are commonly found in blood plasma, and are unique to other plasma proteins in that they are not glycosylated. Substances containing albumin, such as egg white, are called albuminoids.

====Globulin====
Globulin is one of the three types of serum proteins, the others being albumin and fibrinogen. Some globulins are produced in the liver, while others are made by the immune system. The term globulin encompasses a heterogeneous group of proteins with typical high molecular weight, and both solubility and electrophoretic migration rates lower than for albumin.

====Histones====
In biology, histones are highly alkaline proteins found in eukaryotic cell nuclei, which package and order the DNA into structural units called nucleosomes. They are the chief protein components of chromatin, acting as spools around which DNA winds, and play a role in gene regulation.

===Derived protein===
====Peptones====
Peptones are derived from animal milk or meat digested by proteolytic digestion. In addition to containing small peptides, the resulting spray-dried material includes fats, metals, salts, vitamins and many other biological compounds. Peptone is used in nutrient media for growing bacteria and fungi

====Proteases====
Proteases occur naturally in all organisms. These enzymes are involved in a multitude of physiological reactions from simple digestion of food proteins to highly-regulated cascades (e.g., the blood-clotting cascade, the complement system, apoptosis pathways, and the invertebrate prophenoloxidase-activating cascade). Proteases can either break specific peptide bonds (limited proteolysis), depending on the amino acid sequence of a protein, or break down a complete peptide to amino acids (unlimited proteolysis). The activity can be a destructive change, abolishing a protein's function or digesting it to its principal components; it can be an activation of a function, or it can be a signal in a signaling pathway.

==Protein data bank or PDB==
Like fuel and flame, two forces converged to initiate the Protein data bank (PDB): 1) a small but growing data base of sets of protein structures determined by X-ray diffraction and 2) the newly available (1968) molecular graphics display, the BRookhaven Raster Display (BRAD), to inspect these structures in 3-D. In 1969, with the sponsorship of Dr. Walter Hamilton at the Brookhaven National Laboratory, Dr. Edgar Meyer (Texas A&amp;M University) began to write software to store atomic coordinate files in a common format to make them available for geometric and graphical evaluation. By 1971 program SEARCH was executed remotely to extract and examine structural data and thereby was instrumental in initiating networking, thus marking the functional beginning of the PDB.

Upon Hamilton's death in 1973, Dr. Tom Koeztle took over direction of the PDB for the subsequent 20 years. In January 1994, [[Dr. Joel Sussman]] of Israel's [[Weizmann Institute of Science]] was appointed head of the PDB. In October 1998,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
the PDB was transferred to the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics (RCSB); the transfer was completed in June 1999. The new director was [[Dr. Helen M. Berman]] of [[Rutgers University]] (one of the member institutions of the RCSB).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=RCSB PDB Newsletter Archive |publisher=RCSB Protein Data Bank |url=http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/static.do?p=general_information/news_publications/newsletters/newsletter.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, with the formation of the wwPDB, the PDB became an international organization. The founding members are [http://www.pdbe.org/ PDBe (Europe)], RCSB(USA), and [http://www.pdbj.org/ PDBj (Japan)]. The [http://www.bmrb.wisc.edu BMRB] joined in 2006. Each of the four members of [[Worldwide Protein Data Bank|wwPDB]] can act as deposition, data processing and distribution centers for PDB data. The data processing refers to the fact that wwPDB staff review and annotates each submitted entry. The data are then automatically checked for plausibility (the  source code for this validation software has been made available to the public at no charge).

The Protein Data Bank (PDB) is a repository for the 3-D structural data of large biological molecules, such as proteins and nucleic acids. (See also crystallographic database). The data, typically obtained by X-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy and submitted by biologists and biochemists from around the world, are freely accessible on the Internet via the websites of its member organisations (PDBe, PDBj, and RCSB). The PDB is overseen by an organization called the Worldwide Protein Data Bank, wwPDB.

==Insulin==
[[Image:InsulinMonomer.jpg|250px|thumb|'''The structure of insulin.''' The left side is a space-filling model of the insulin monomer, believed to be biologically active. [[Carbon]] is green, [[hydrogen]] white, [[oxygen]] red, and [[nitrogen]] blue. On the right side is a [[ribbon diagram]] of the insulin hexamer, believed to be the stored form. A monomer unit is highlighted with the A chain in blue and the B chain in cyan. Yellow denotes disulfide bonds, and magenta spheres are zinc ions.]]
[[Image:InsulinHexamer.jpg‎|right|thumb|250px|Insulin hexamers highlighting the threefold symmetry, the zinc ions (center) binding with histidine.]]

Within vertebrates, the amino acid sequence of insulin is extremely well preserved. Bovine insulin differs from human in only three amino acid residues, and porcine insulin in one. Even insulin from some species of fish is similar enough to human to be clinically effective in humans. Insulin in some invertebrates is quite similar in sequence to human insulin, and has similar physiological effects. The strong homology seen in the insulin sequence of diverse species suggests that it has been conserved across much of animal evolutionary history. The C-peptide of proinsulin , however, differs much more amongst species; it is also a hormone, but a secondary one.

Insulin is produced and stored in the body as a hexamer (a unit of six insulin molecules), while the active form is the monomer. The hexamer is an inactive form with long-term stability, which serves as a way to keep the highly reactive insulin protected, yet readily available. The hexamer-monomer conversion is one of the central aspects of insulin formulations for injection. The hexamer is far more stable than the monomer, which is desirable for practical reasons, however the monomer is a much faster reacting drug because diffusion rate is inversely related to particle size. A fast reacting drug means that insulin injections do not have to precede mealtimes by hours, which in turn gives diabetics more flexibility in their daily schedule. Insulin can aggregate and form fibrillar interdigitated beta-sheets. This can cause injection amyloidosis, and prevents the storage of insulin for long periods&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Insulin&amp;oldid=425481933&lt;/ref&gt;.


In 1869 Paul Langerhans, a medical student in Berlin, was studying the structure of the pancreas under a microscope when he identified some previously un-noticed tissue clumps scattered throughout the bulk of the pancreas. The function of the &quot;little heaps of cells,&quot; later known as the Islets of Langerhans, was unknown, but Edouard Laguesse later suggested that they might produce secretions that play a regulatory role in digestion. Paul Langerhans' son, Archibald, also helped to understand this regulatory role. The term insulin origins from insula, the Latin word for islet/island.
In 1889, the Polish-German physician Oscar Minkowski in collaboration with Joseph von Mering removed the pancreas from a healthy dog to test its assumed role in digestion. Several days after the dog's pancreas was removed, Minkowski's animal keeper noticed a swarm of flies feeding on the dog's urine. On testing the urine they found that there was sugar in the dog's urine, establishing for the first time a relationship between the pancreas and diabetes. In 1901, another major step was taken by Eugene Opie, when he clearly established the link between the Islets of Langerhans and diabetes: Diabetes mellitus … is caused by destruction of the islets of Langerhans and occurs only when these bodies are in part or wholly destroyed. Before his work, the link between the pancreas and diabetes was clear, but not the specific role of the islets.

The Nobel Prize committee in 1923 credited the practical extraction of insulin to a team at the University of Toronto and awarded the Nobel Prize to two men; Fredericus Bantam and J.J.R. Macleon. They were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1923 for the discovery of insulin. Bantam, insulted that Best was not mentioned, shared his prize with Best, and Macleon immediately shared his with James Collip. The patent for insulin was sold to the University of Toronto for one half-dollar.

The primary structure of insulin was determined by British molecular biologist Frederick Sanger. It was the first protein to have its sequence be determined. He was awarded the 1958 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for this work.
In 1969, after decades of work, Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin determined the spatial conformation of the molecule, the so-called tertiary structure, by means of X-ray diffraction studies. She had been awarded a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1964 for the development of crystallography.
Rosalyn Sussman Yalow received the 1977 Nobel Prize in Medicine for the development of the radioimmunoassay for insulin&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Insulin&amp;oldid=425481933&lt;/ref&gt;.

If you '''decline''' the unblock request, replace this template with the following, substituting &lt;tt&gt;decline reason here&lt;/tt&gt; with any specific rationale. If the &lt;tt&gt;decline=&lt;/tt&gt; parameter is omitted, a reason for unblocking will be requested.

Due to the nature of the block applied we need additional information before we can decide whether to unblock you. It is very likely that you are not personally blocked. If you are prevented from editing, it may be because you are autoblocked or blocked because of your [[w:IP address|IP address]]. Without further details there is nothing further we can do to review or lift your block.  Please follow these instructions:

# If you have a Wikibooks account, please ensure that you are logged in. &lt;br /&gt; Your account name will be visible in the top right of this page if you are. &lt;br /&gt; If it isn't, try [[MediaWiki:Clearyourcache|bypassing your web browser's cache]].
# Try to &lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[{{fullurl:Wikibooks:Sandbox|action=edit}} edit the Sandbox]&lt;/span&gt;.
# If you are still blocked, copy the &lt;tt&gt;{&amp;#123;[[:Template:unblock-auto|unblock-auto]]&amp;#124;...&amp;#125;}&lt;/tt&gt; code generated for you under the &quot;'''&lt;u&gt;Rectifying an autoblock&lt;/u&gt;'''&quot; section. This is usually within the &quot;'''&lt;u&gt;Unblock request&lt;u&gt;'''&quot; section.
# Paste the code at the &lt;u&gt;bottom&lt;/u&gt; of [[Special:MyTalk|your user discussion page]] and click save.

If you are not blocked from editing the sandbox then the autoblock on your IP address has already expired and you can resume editing. &lt;!-- from [[Template:Autoblock]] --&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;

This should generally be used for CheckUser blocks when a reviewing administrator is uncertain about how to proceed. It should not be called manually, but copied from the text provided in the unblock-auto template.

=== Usage ===

== Introduction ==
Psychosis, a syndrome with many causes, traditionally refers to an impaired ability to distinguish between false and real perceptions and beliefs. Schizophrenia is the prototypical psychotic disorder. The most common psychotic symptoms are ''positive symptoms'' such as abnormal perceptions (including illusions and hallucinations), false beliefs, including a wide variety of delusional thoughts (e.g., paranoid delusions, delusions of reference, grandiose, somatic, etc.), and disorganized thinking. In addition, patients with schizophrenia might have prominent ''negative symptoms'' such as affective flattening, alogia (decreased thought/speech production), and avolition, together with amotivation, anhedonia and social isolation. Disorganized or bizarre behavior is a separate symptom dimension of the disorder. Affective symptoms can also be present and cognitive and social deficits are common.

This chapter focuses on primary psychotic disorders, as illustrated by schizophrenia, meaning that the clinical picture of psychosis is not deemed to be secondary to other processes. It is important to note that in addition to the primary psychoses a number of psychiatric and somatic conditions affecting the brain homeostasis can produce psychotic symptoms. 

Patients with personality disorders (PDs) can present with overt psychotic symptoms in response to stress (e.g., paranoid PD, schizotypal PD, borderline PD). Schizoid PD is considered a risk factor and might precede Schizophrenia and Delusional Disorder. With regards to mood disorders, severe psychotic depression can present with mood congruent (e.g., nihilistic delusions, delusional guilt) and/or auditory hallucinations making critical and negative comments. At the opposite end of the spectrum, severe mania can present with grandiose and religious delusions, delusions of special powers, and auditory hallucinations (God’s or angelic voices). Late life psychosis can be present in the later stages of dementia disorders. Conditions that affect the brain structure, either acutely [e.g., rapidly growing brain tumors, traumatic brain injury, strokes, infectious/inflammatory processes such as tertiary syphilis, multiple sclerosis or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)], or chronically [e.g., nutrient and vitamin deficiencies such as B12, niacin deficiency (pellagra), etc.] can present with a variety of psychotic symptoms. Last but not least, a number of drugs (prescribed and illicit) can be associated with psychotic symptoms either during treatment/intoxication or withdrawal. 

This chapter will first review the definitions of the different types of psychotic symptoms, as the basis for the discussion about the approach (including initial assessment as well as short and long-term treatment plans) to a patient with a generic psychotic syndrome. For the remainder of the chapter schizophrenia is used as the foundation for the discussion of clinical diagnosis, differential diagnosis, epidemiology, pathophysiology, genetics and treatment.  Pertinent details of schizophrenia-related disorders will be discussed (compared and contrasted whenever the case) within the confines of the broader schizophrenia mainframe.

== Clinical Manifestations and Definition of Terms ==
* '''Positive Symptoms''' are thought of as an excess of normal function. Overvalued misperceptions that become illusions and hallucinations and overvalued ideas that become delusions (fixed ideas) are classical examples of positive symptoms. 

* '''Negative Symptoms''' refer to a lack of what is considered to be normal function. Normally, a degree of volitional ability is expected; therefore decreased or absent volition (avolition) is a negative symptom. Similarly, a lack of motivation (amotivation), a lack of ability to enjoy things (anhedonia), or decreased ability to engage in social activities (social isolation) are other classical negative symptoms.

* '''Catatonia''' refers to two extreme (and fundamentally opposite) states. Agitated catatonia refers to a state of excessive, extreme behavioral agitation (not in response to internal stimuli), while catatonic immobility refers to extreme negativism (the patient actively resists any attempts to have his extremities or whole body moved) or catalepsy (waxy flexibility). Other catatonic symptoms include posturing (assuming strange body postures), grimacing, mannerisms, stereotyped movements, echolalia (where the patient repeats in parrot-like fashion the words of another person), and echopraxia (where the patient imitates in mirror-like fashion the movements of another person).

* '''Disorganized thinking''' ('''formal thought disorder''') refers to an alteration in the thought process. Normally the flow of thinking is coherent, linear and goal directed. In psychotic patients the associations may be loose to the point of being non-existent. The psychotic patient’s thought form may present with tangentiality (ideas are only marginally connected) or circumstantiality (the patient responds to questions moving in gradually more focused, concentric circles until eventually reaching the answer). In extreme cases, even the structure of the sentence might be lost which results in word salad.

* '''Disorganized behavior''' refers to the patient difficulty to complete most goal oriented activities. A range of behaviors have been described: actively responding to inner stimuli (e.g., talking to oneself or shouting for no apparent reason), aimless, repetitive movements and activities, poor ability to maintain one’s basic hygiene and perform routine actives of daily living (which often results in a disheveled appearance, and poor grooming and hygiene), or uncensored public sexual activity (being naked, or masturbating in public).

* '''Active phase''' refers to a period of time when a combination of the above symptoms are prominently manifested.

* '''Prodromal''' and '''residual''' phases refer to periods of time of attenuated symptoms that either precede (prodromal) or follow (residual) the active phase period.

* '''Cognitive Symptoms''': Memory (more specifically working memory), attention, concentration, processing speed, problem solving (executive functioning), and social cognition are a few of the many cognitive domains shown to be impaired in schizophrenia.

* '''Insight''' is a multidimensional concept referring to awareness of illness, specific symptoms and their consequences, as well as need for treatment. Insight refers to the patient’s ability to understand that some of his or her non-reality based experiences (usually hallucinatory experiences and delusional  representations) are secondary to having schizophrenia rather than reality. Awareness and attribution of both current and past symptoms represent specific aspects of insight.   Additional dimensions of insight include a more global understanding of the diagnosis and need for treatment. 

=== Approach to the Patient with Acute Psychosis ===

The following major issues should be kept in the forefront:

#What is the most accurate diagnosis?
#Is there a treatable or reversible component to the psychosis?
#Is the patient safe?
#Can the physician help to alleviate the positive symptoms?
#Can the physician help to alleviate the negative, cognitive symptoms and insight deficits to improve social/functional outcomes?

=== History ===
The history should clarify the onset (acute versus gradual), tempo (slow/protracted versus rapid), chronology, course (persistent versus episodic), and type of symptoms.

'''Onset and tempo'''

An acute or subacute onset of psychosis may represent delirium, psychosis due to a general medical condition, or a substance induced psychosis and should trigger the search for intoxication, infection, or metabolic derangement. 

'''Duration'''

According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) a diagnosis of schizophrenia requires the presence of a combination of prominent positive, negative, disorganized thinking (formal thought disorder), catatonia, or behavior type of symptoms for at least a month (active phase), with a total duration of the episode (including active phase, and some type of prodromal or residual symptoms) for at least 6 months and resulting in social and occupational dysfunction. 

A schizophrenia-like presentation that lasts more than a month but less than 6 months would be more appropriately diagnosed as '''schizophreniform disorder'''. '''Brief psychotic disorder''' should be diagnosed when the total duration of symptoms is shorter than a month. 
'''Schizoaffective disorder''' trumps schizophrenia if in addition to stand alone episodes of psychotic symptoms there is also a long history of affective symptoms, and the affective symptoms occurred for a longer time than the psychotic symptoms.

'''Chronology''' 

Refers to the temporal rapport between the different symptoms. Clarifying what started and what followed are essential in ruling out phenomenologically overlapping disorders. If it is determined that the psychotic symptoms ''followed'' a medical condition or drug (prescribed or illicit) '''psychotic disorder due to a general medical condition''', '''substance induced psychotic disorder''', or '''delirium''' need to be considered first. '''Mood disorder with psychotic symptoms''' is diagnosed if the history shows that psychotic symptoms ''always occurred'' in the context of already present, and most often severe affective (depressive and manic) symptoms.

'''Course'''

A clearly episodic course is most times indicative of a primary affective disorder. Unfortunately, schizophrenia tends to be chronic, with some level of residual symptoms following the active phase for most patients. However, for schizophrenia, after one year since the onset of the acute phase symptoms, DSM allows for a number of course based specifiers including: single episode with partial/total remission, episodic with/without inter-episode residual symptoms, and continuous.

=== Physical and Neurological Examination ===
A thorough general and neurological examination is recommended.  

'''General physical examination'''

Is recommended to first rule out a systemic disease that may be responsible for the psychotic syndrome. A number of non-specific physical abnormalities including an arched palate, narrow or wide–set eyes or subtle ear malformations are more frequently reported in patients with schizophrenia than in the general population. For patients treated with antipsychotics a physical exam will document the general state of health and is important to exclude side effects of medication. Side effects include orthostatic hypotension, hypersalivaton (secondary to clozapine), anticholinergic syndrome (dry mouth, and tachycardia secondary to anticholinergics), hyperprolactinemia (lactation secondary to D2 antagonism), and metabolic syndrome (most common with clozapine and olanzapine). 

'''Neurological examination''' 

Is recommended to rule out neurological conditions that may present with psychotic manifestations; of note, abnormal focal neurological signs are not typically found in primary psychotic disorders. Such findings should prompt the clinician to do a more extensive neurological work-up. In addition, a neurological exam is necessary to exclude the presence of ''soft neurological signs'' and ''abnormal involuntary movements''. ''Soft (neurological) signs'', while not pathognomonic, are frequently seen in schizophrenia, where &quot;soft&quot; denotes the absence of a clearly localized (&quot;hard&quot;) central nervous pathology that can explain the observed deficits. They include: 
*Sensory function integration abnormalities include poor audio—visual integration, astereognosis (the inability to identify an object by touch without visual input), and agraphaesthesia (the inability to recognize writing on the skin purely by the sensation of touch). 
*Motor function integration abnormalities might include balance and gait abnormalities, poor coordination, intention tremor, finger—thumb opposition difficulties. 

In addition, a number of abnormal involuntary movements have been classically described in chronic schizophrenia (before the neuroleptic age) but have been much more prevalent since the introduction of antipsychotic dopamine antagonist drugs.  These include: 
*''Akathisia'', which refers to low amplitude, high frequency movement typically involving the lower extremities. The patient reports a feeling of intolerable restlessness, specifically manifested as a need to continuously move one’s feet. The patient cannot stop pacing (paces in place when asked to sit or stand without walking), 
*''Dystonia'', which refers to a high amplitude, low frequency, spastic type of movement, typically involving an isolated muscle group, e.g., oculopharogyric crisis (eyes turned upwards), torticollis (neck turned sideways), laryngeal spasm (rare but serious as it might result in asphyxia), opisthotonus (arched back, rare, painful)
*''Dyskinesia'', which refers to low amplitude, repetitive, moderate frequency, pseudo-parkinsonian movements that may involve any muscle group but most typically involve the fingers, hands, toes, feet, lips and lower face muscles (including perioral and mandibular muscles)
*''Tremor'', which refers to a low amplitude, high frequency, repetitive movement. Tremor of the hands and fingers can be spontaneous or can be elicited by asking the patient to put his arms in a horizontal position and stretch his fingers. In addition, a parkinsonian pill rolling tremor may also be observed. In patients taking lithium a fine tremor(very low amplitude, very high frequency) may be seen.

=== Mental Status Examination (MSE) ===
*'''Appearance:''' disheveled or bizarre appearance may be a clue to underlying psychosis. Impaired reality testing commonly results in poor grooming and hygiene.
*'''Attitude:''' paranoid patients may be unwilling to co-operate during an interview, while very psychotic patients my be unable to engage with the interviewer.
*'''Motor behavior:''' posturing, repetitive gestures, extreme psychomotor agitation (without any apparent precipitants or retardation) can indicate a catatonic presentation. Alternatively, the patient may present with psychomotor agitation in response to overwhelming internal stimuli (e.g., loud, demeaning voices or threatening visions) or because of severe paranoid ideation.
*'''Mood:''' patient’s reported mood can vary from good to depressed or afraid.
*'''Affect:''' paranoid patients present with guarded affect, eyes scanning the room, and a closed up body language.
*'''Speech/thought process:''' can be vague, circumstantial or overtly disorganized. At times nonsensical neologisms, word salad, clang (rhyming, nonsensical associations) are present.
*'''Thought content:''' may be positive for delusional ideation (most common ideas of references and paranoid delusions). In addition, the patient may harbor suicidal and violent thoughts due to his persistent psychotic symptoms or, at times, related to concomitant depressive symptoms.
*'''Perceptual disturbances:''' auditory hallucinations can be commanding and order the patient to kill himself or other people. When visual hallucinations are present they tend to be unpleasant as a rule and are often overtly terrifying.
*'''Insight and Judgement:''' judgement is mostly impaired and the patient has very limited, if any, insight. 
*'''Cognition:''' with the possible exception of decreased attention, other cognitive deficits may not be obvious during a cursory MSE.

=== Cognitive Examination ===
In schizophrenia neuropsychological testing routinely reveals deficits in working memory, executive functioning, social functioning, processing speed, verbal fluency, and/or reaction time abnormalities. Unfortunately, the ability to test for these deficits routinely in clinical practice is limited by the lack of good, time efficient screening cognitive instruments for schizophrenia and related disorders.

=== Laboratory Tests ===
There are no tests that can rule in a diagnosis of schizophrenia or related disorders. The role of laboratory investigations are to rule out substance induced disorders and general medical conditions that can present with a psychotic syndrome; to establish a baseline and monitor physiological functions that can be affected by, or can affect the metabolism of psychotropic medications; and monitor drug levels when necessary.

'''Investigations to exclude a substance induced disorder or general medical condition:'''
* [http://www.labtestsonline.org/understanding/analytes/drug_abuse/test.html urine] or blood toxicology screen: should be performed routinely in all patients presenting with new onset or exacerbated psychotic symptoms, as a number of illicit drugs can cause/worsen psychosis (e.g., hallucinogens, cocaine, stimulants, marijuana).
* [http://www.labtestsonline.org/understanding/analytes/cbc/test.html Complete blood cell count] (CBC): blood dyscrasias can point to an underlying vitamin deficit that may manifest with psychosis (e.g., pernicious or megaloblastic anaemia as a sign of vitamin B12/folate deficits)
* [http://www.labtestsonline.org/understanding/analytes/syphilis/test.html Rapid plasma reagin] (RPR): done to rule out (tertiary) syphilis
* [http://www.labtestsonline.org/understanding/analytes/thyroid_panel/glance.html Thyroid panel]: indicated when there is a clinical suspicion for hypo or hyperthyroidism
* Brain Imaging:
:* Structural brain imaging (CT or MRI) is indicated to rule out other brain pathologies (e.g., multiple strokes, demyelination, masses). Neuroimaging studies do not show a pattern of findings specific for schizophrenia or related disorders and may be normal early in the course of the disease.  As schizophrenia progresses, enlarged ventricles and diffuse cortical atrophy becomes apparent. MRI scans may also show atrophy of the parahippocampal gyrus, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, mesolimbic system, the anterior cingulate cortex, and planum temporalis asymmetry reversal or generalized reductions in grey and white matter.
:* Functional brain imaging studies (PET and functional MRI) demonstrate abnormalities in the same regions. However, none of these changes are pathognomonic for schizophrenia or related disorders.

A liver function panel and chemistry panel (to document renal function) are recommended to establish a baseline for physiological functions that can affect the metabolism of psychotropic medications. Other tests that may be indicated to monitor side effects of psychotropic medication include a blood glucose level, a lipid panel, and an ECG (as some antipsychotics have the potential of prolonging the QTc interval). A prolactin level should only be measured when prolactinemia is suspected on clinical grounds.

The following drug levels need monitoring: lithium (0.7 to 1.2 mEq/L), carbamazepine (5 to 12 mcg/mL), and valproic acid (50 to 100 mcg/mL). A clozapine level above 350 ng/mL
is recommended to establish compliance and has been shown to correlate with improved efficacy for refractory schizophrenia. There is no clear evidence of a therapeutic range  for other antipsychotics.

== Specific Types of Primary Psychotic Disorders ==

=== General Considerations and Differential Diagnosis ===
When a patient presents with a psychotic syndrome the first order of business is to establish if the presenting symptoms are due to another psychiatric or somatic condition. In other words, a psychotic syndrome is classified as &quot;primary psychosis&quot; only after other possible underlying pathologies have been ruled out.

In terms of somatic contributors, the main suspects should include processes that may affect the brain either acutely or chronically, in which case a diagnosis of psychotic disorder due to a general medical condition is appropriate. A substance induced psychotic disorder should be diagnosed if there is a likely cause and effect relationship between a substance (including medication, OTC products or illicit drugs) and the psychotic presentation. Psychiatric underlying pathologies include severe depressive and bipolar disorder, which may present with mood congruent psychotic features. As discussed, under stress, some personality disorders may present with transient psychotic symptoms. 

The differential diagnosis between different primary psychotic disorders should take into account the type and duration of symptoms. Virtually identical symptoms are seen in schizophrenia, brief psychotic disorder, and schizophreniform disorder. The symptom duration differentiates brief psychotic disorder (1 day to &lt;1 month) from schizophreniform disorder (1 month &lt;6 months) and schizophrenia (&gt;6 months). Delusional disorder is differentiated from schizophrenia based on prominent, non-bizarre delusions without any other associated symptoms. When distinct psychotic episodes are present but affective symptoms account for the majority of the clinical presentation a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder should be considered.

=== Conceptual History and Diagnostic Classification ===

* 1853: Morel’s curious cases of ''Démence Précoce'': [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9n%C3%A9dict_Morel Bénédict Morel] introduces the concept of ''Démence Précoce'',  literally &quot;early dementia&quot;, described  a distinct syndrome affecting teenagers and young adults. The syndrome is characterized by bizarre behavior and mental function, withdrawal and self neglect starting in adolescence. 

* 1868: Kahlbaum’s ''Katatonie'': [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Ludwig_Kahlbaum Karl Ludwig Kahlbaum] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ewald_Hecker Ewald Hecker] publish ''Die Gruppierung der psychischen Krankheiten '' (The Classification of Psychiatric Diseases). By considering the longitudinal course of psychiatric symptoms in addition to the clinical presentation Kahlbaum and Hecker were the first to describe and name a number of psychiatric syndromes including ''cyclothymia'', ''dysthymia'', ''paranoia'', ''catatonia'', and ''hebephrenia''. Kahlbaum’s ''Katatonie'' was characterized by stereotyped movements, outbursts of excitement and stupor.

* 1870: Ewald Hecker’s ''hebephrenia'' and ''cyclothymia'': Hecker differentiates between ''hebephrenia'', a disorder that begins in adolescence with erratic behavior followed by a rapid decline of all mental functions, and ''cyclothymia'', a cyclical mood disorder.

* 1891: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Pick Arnold Pick] reports on a case of a psychotic disorder which he calls ''Dementia Praecox'' 
* 1893: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emil_Kraepelin Emil Kraepelin’s] ''Dementia'' ''Praecox'': Kraepelin new classification of mental disorders distinguishes between ''dementia praecox'' and mood disorder (termed manic depression and including both unipolar and bipolar depression). 
:*''Dementia Praecox'': A &quot;sub-acute development of a peculiar simple condition of mental weakness occurring at a youthful age.&quot; 
:* Distinct from ''catatonia'' and ''dementia paranoides''. 
:* Kraepelin’s concept relied heavily on course (chronic versus episodic) and prognosis
* 1899: ''hebefrenia'', ''catatonia'' and ''dementia paranoides'' as subtypes of ''dementia praecox''. 
* 1919: Kraepelin writes that &quot;it is becoming increasingly clear that we cannot distinguish satisfactorily between these two illnesses and this brings home the suspicion that our formulation of the problem may be incorrect.&quot; 
* 1908: [http://www.answers.com/topic/eugene-bleuler Eugen Bleuler]’s ''Schizophrenia'' gk. skhizein &quot;to split&quot;+ phren (gen. phrenos) &quot;diaphragm, heart, mind&quot;, where &quot;split mind&quot; referred to being split off from reality and unable to distinguish what is real from what is not real. Of note, Bleuler never implied that people with schizophrenia have split personalities; he proposed the term of schizophrenia to describe the separation of function between personality, thinking, memory, and perception. 
:* Bleuler 4 A's: flattened Affect, Autism, impaired Association of ideas and Ambivalence. 
:* Bleuler proposal for a new name also stemmed from his dissatisfaction with the implications of dementia praecox label. Bleuler noted that schizophrenia was NOT a dementia, as some of his patients improved.

* 1887 – 1967: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Schneider Kurt Schneider]  described the first rank symptoms (FRS), thought to be specific for schizophrenia psychosis. He included thought insertion/broadcast/withdrawal, made feelings/impulses/actions/somatic sensations (a type of delusion), third person auditory hallucinations (running commentary or arguments), delusional perception, and thought echo (''echo de la pensee'' or ''gendankenlautwerden'') – a type of hallucination. Only 58% of patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia experience at least one FRS, while 20% never experience FRS. Furthermore, 10% of patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia experience FRS.


*Modern positive and negative symptoms based classification systems: 
::* '''Positive''' symptoms include distortions or excesses of normal functioning such as, hallucinations, delusions, disorganized thinking and speech, and inappropriate affect. Frequently hallucinations are auditory in nature; rarely  they may be visual, tactile or olfactory. Delusions are fixed false beliefs held despite negative evidence, and are not consistent with cultural norms. Types include persecutory, referential, somatic, grandiose, etc. Positive symptoms are generally more responsive to treatment than negative symptoms.
::* '''Negative''' symptoms involve a decrease or absence of normal behavior. They include affective flattening, impoverishment of speech and language, avolition, amotivation, lack of interest, anhedonia, and social isolation.
* Modern classifications: 
::*Andreasen's Positive and Negative Symptoms Type 
::*Crow Type I and II:
:::* Type I – positive symptoms, good response to treatment, relatively better outcome
:::* Type II – negative symptoms, poorer response to treatment, relatively poor outcome, MRI changes.

=== Current classification – ICD 10/ DSM-IV-TR ===
Common ICD/DSM types:&lt;ref name=&quot;DSM&quot;/&gt;
* ''Paranoid'' schizophrenia:
:* Prominent delusions, auditory hallucinations
:* Usually minimal thought disorder or negative symptoms
* ''Catatonic'' schizophrenia is characterized by prominent psychomotor symptoms e.g.,  violent excitement, posturing, waxy flexibility, automatic obedience, perseveration, stupor.
* ''Residual'' schizophrenia or &quot;defect state&quot;, when positive symptoms give way to negative symptoms.
* ''Simple'' schizophrenia refers to insidious development of negative symptoms without positive symptoms
DSM IV only:&lt;ref name=&quot;DSM&quot;/&gt; 
* ''Disorganized'' schizophrenia: mainly thought disorder, and negative symptoms, without prominent positive or affective symptoms.
ICD 10 only:
* ''Hebephrenic'' schizophrenia: affective abnormality, thought disorder, mannerisms. May have chronic course.

=== Epidemiology and Risk Factors ===
The life time prevalence of schizophrenia is between 0.5-1.5% in the general population and is one of the ten leading causes of disability worldwide. Of note, this 1 in 100 rate has been shown to be remarkably constant across different historical periods and across different cultures. The annual incidence is reported to be in the range of 0.5 to 5 per 10,000. The onset of schizophrenia is usually between the ages of 20-45. Most times, the course of the disorder is chronic and characterized by a gradual, progressive deterioration. However partial or complete recovery is reported to occur for 30-60% of patients following a first episode of schizophrenia.* About 20-40% of patients with schizophrenia attempt suicide at least once during their lifetime, and about 10-15% die of suicide. The prevalence in males and females is equal.&lt;ref name=&quot;DSM&quot;&gt;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR. PsychiatryOnline.com Online ISBN 0-89042-334-2. Accessed 03/01/2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The following risk factors have been reported for schizophrenia:
* Men tend to be diagnosed earlier than women (males age 15-25 years, females age 25 – 35 years)
* Seasonality: winter birth excess
* Schizoid and schizotypal personality disorders
* A family history of schizophrenia or major affective disorders
* A family with a high level of expressed emotions (EE)
* Schizophrenia tends to be more frequent in urban areas and in developed countries
* Lower socioeconomic status 
* Schizophrenia is more frequent in recent immigrants (deprivation, stress of immigration may increase risk)

=== Genetic Considerations ===
The rate of schizophrenia is increased in families with affected members. Mode of Transmission is unknown and likely to be multi-factorial, possibly polygenic. 70% of the heritability of schizophrenia is genetic. Adoption studies have shown an 
increased incidence of schizophrenia spectrum disorders among adopted offspring of schizophrenic parents. When one parent has schizophrenia there is a twelve fold increase in the risk of developing the disorder; with one affected sibling there is a 9 fold increase in risk; for monozygotic, identical twins the rate of concordance is around 50%. Working memory appears to be heritable and showed significant associations with DISC1, reelin, and AKT1 in schizophrenia.

=== Pathology ===
While there are no structural or functional brain changes specific to schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders a number of abnormalities are reported. Enlarged ventricles, deep cortical sulci, diffuse gray and white matter loss, increased neuronal density, decreased synapse density, and an overall decrease in brain size have been reported in schizophrenia studies using structural brain imaging (CT, structural and diffusion sensor MRI studies) or postmortem observations. Smaller frontal and temporal lobes, lower volume hippocampus, thalamus, corpus callosum, and anterior cingulate, as well as larger caudate
and putamen have been reported in schizophrenia.

Decreased activation in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (during working memory task), and increased activation of the superior temporal gyrus (during auditory hallucinations) have been also reported in functional brain imaging (fMRI and PET) studies.

=== Etiopathological Theories ===

==== Neurodevelopmental Theories ====
Impaired fetal or neonatal brain development may sow the seeds for the onset of psychotic symptoms in later life. Patients with schizophrenia have a lower than average IQ, and often subtle/soft neurological signs.
A number of parental risk factors have been reported including multiparity, maternal bleeding during pregnancy, small baby size for gestational age, increased paternal age, and severe stress to mother during first trimester. 
In addition, the following environmental risk factors have been associated with increased risk of developing psychotic illness later in life: late winter birth, prenatal exposure to famine, in-utero exposure to analgesics, and cannabis use.

==== Biological factors ====

=====Electrophysiology=====

* P50 sensory gating deficits: following an auditory stimulus schizophrenia patients fail to gate a subsequent stimulus that follows closely (within the normal 50 msec suppression).
* Reduced P300 evoked response potential (ERP) [oddball deficit paradigm]: schizophrenia patients fail to respond to an odd ball stimulus administered during a series of otherwise identical stimuli.
* Prepulse Inhibition (PPI) Paradigm.

=====Neurotransmitters=====

Dopamine (DA)
:* Hypothesis: excessive DA activity in mesolimbic and cortical brain regions. Schizophrenia is the result of a dopaminergic hyper-salient state &lt;ref&gt;Kapur S.Psychosis as a state of aberrant salience: a framework linking biology, phenomenology, and pharmacology in schizophrenia.Am J Psychiatry. 2003 Jan;160(1):13-23&lt;/ref&gt;
:* Supporting evidence:
::* Postmortem studies: increase DA receptors in schizophrenia
::* HVA (dopamine metabolite) in plasma, CSF and severity of psychosis/response to neuroleptics 
::* DA Agonists
:::* Amphetamines release DA at synapses and cause positive symptoms (in people who do not have schizophrenia)
:::* L-dopa increases central DA concentrations and causes positive symptoms
:::* DA Antagonists: All effective antipsychotics are D2 receptor antagonists; efficacy correlates with D2 occupancy
:* Limitations:
::* Amphetamines and L-dopa do not produce negative symptoms
::* Antipsychotics are ineffective in 30% of patients
::* Antipsychotics block D2 receptors instantly but antipsychotic effect not evident for days

Serotonin
:* Hypothesis: serotonin excess
:* LSD and psilocybin are potent 5HT receptor agonists and cause positive symptoms of schizophrenia (in people who do not have schizophrenia)
:* Atypical antipsychotics are potent 5HT2 receptor antagonists
:* Limitations: LSD produces visual hallucinations which are uncommon in schizophrenia

Excitatory amino acids (EAAs): glutamate and aspartate
:* Hypothesis: EAAs deficit
:* Phenylcyclidine (PCP), which antagonizes EAA receptors, can produce positive and negative symptoms in people without schizophrenia
:* Glutamate agonists (e.g., glycine), may be modestly therapeutic in schizophrenia

==== Psychological Factors ====
*Freud: delusions as a way of making sense of a disturbed internal world (&quot;I need to respond with aggression to protect myself as everyone is attacking me&quot;).
*Klein: failure to resolve the paranoid/schizoid position
*Cameron: loss of conceptual boundaries
*Goldstein: concrete thinking
*Difficulties in filtering sensory input (see also electrophysiological findings)

==== Familial/Social Factors ====
*Probably more important in precipitating schizophrenia than causing it
*Lidz’s  marital schism/marital skew
*Bateson’s double bind theory
*High expressed emotion

==== Social Factors ====
*Social adversity in childhood and fetal life associated with risk of developing schizophrenia and other psychoses later in life 
*Risk factors for psychoses later in life (in developed countries):
:*households receiving social welfare benefits 
:*unemployment 
:*single-parent households 
:*low socioeconomic status 
:*rented apartments&lt;ref&gt;Wicks S, Hjern A, Gunnell D, et. Social adversity in childhood and the risk of developing psychosis: a national cohort study. Am J Psychiatry. 2005 Sep;162(9):1652-7&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Clinical Diagnosis ===
According to DSM-IV Schizophrenia is diagnosed when the patient presents with a combination of positive (delusions and hallucinations) and negative symptoms, which have been present for at least 6 months and have resulted in significant dysfunction. It is also accepted that disorganized speech/behavior and/or catatonic symptoms, when combined with other positive or negative symptoms, can count toward a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is a diagnosis of exclusion; in other words, it is required that there are no other medical, psychiatric, or substance-induced conditions that would explain the patient’s diagnosis better than schizophrenia.&lt;ref name=&quot;DSM&quot;/&gt;

=== Differential Diagnosis ===
Early in the disease course, other etiologies of psychosis should be excluded. These include treatable conditions such as tertiary syphilis, vitamin deficiencies, brain tumor, drug and medication intoxication, chronic infection, and mood disorders. While neuroimaging studies (CT and MRI) do not show a single specific pattern with schizophrenia or related disorders and may be normal early in the course of the disease a screening CT is recommended for patients with a first episode of primary psychosis, especially for late or acute onsets. An affective psychosis (mania or depression with psychotic features) should be ruled out if affective symptoms preceded psychotic symptoms or are dominating the clinical picture at the time of presentation. A diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder is appropriate if historically the course has been dominated by affective symptoms and there are at least some episodes of &quot;pure&quot; psychosis i.e., independent of the affective background. Symptom duration will separate brief psychotic disorder (&lt;1 month), schizophereniform disorder (&lt;6 months), and schizophrenia (&gt;6 months).

=== Treatment ===
Hospitalization is recommended if the acute psychotic symptoms result in danger to self or others or significant impairment. 

==== Biological ====
Traditionally, dopamine 2 (D2) antagonists (blockers), most often labelled as first generation (typical) neuroleptics, have been the pillar of schizophrenia treatment. 
* D2 blockers, by decreasing the presumably excessive mesolimbic dopamine, have established efficacy for positive psychotic symptoms; however, due to concomitant blockade of the frontostriatal dopamine pathway, where dopamine is presumably decreased all along in schizophrenia, they do not improve (and in some cases can worsen) negative, cognitive symptoms, and/or functional/social outcomes. 
* Due to an alteration of the physiological dopamine/acetylcholine ratio in the basal ganglia these drugs also have a number of extra-pyramidal adverse effects (EPSEs) both short term (acute dystonia, dyskinesia, akathisia) and long term (parkinsonism and tardive diskinesia).  
* Finally, following a dopamine blockade in the tuberoinfundibular system, there is a prolactin increase with common sexual side effects, including decreased sexual interest, sexual difficulties, lactation and (in men) gynaecomastia.
* The side effects of typical neuroleptics can be stigmatizing and are a major reason for non-adherence to treatment.
Some of the above issues have been resolved with the advent of the second generation antipsychotics (SGA) or atypical neuroleptics, a drug class that tends to share the mechanism of D2 and 5HT2 (serotonin) antagonism. We say &quot;tends to share&quot; rather than &quot;share the characteristic&quot; as the second generation drugs show a number of differences in terms of both receptor profile and affinities. To illustrate, the prototypical atypical neuroleptic is clozapine, a drug that has strong D4 and 5HT2A antagonism but only partial D2 antagonism. 
* SGAs have fewer EPSEs and tend to be better for negative symptoms than typicals (not increasing negative symptoms).
* Some of the atypicals (e.g., olanzapine, clozapine) increase the risk for metabolic adverse effects including significant weight gain, diabetes and dyslipidemia.
* Clozapine is recommended for treatment resistant schizophrenia.
* Generally SGAs, with the exception of olanzapine and clozapine, are first line treatments. This preference is based more on better tolerability (less EPSEs and cognitive adverse effects) than greater efficacy. On a case by case basis first generation antipsychotics (FGAs) may represent a reasonable alternative.&lt;ref&gt;APA Practice Guidelines Guideline Watch (September 2009): Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia.PsychiatryOnline.com Online ISBN 0-89042-336-9. Accessed 03/01/2011&lt;/ref&gt; Perphenazine and molindone efficacy and overall tolerability has been shown to be similar to SGAs.
General prescribing principles:
* Initial management may include use of sedative medication such as lorazepam.
* IM medication may be required in a very disturbed, involuntary patient. 
* Depot (long-acting) neuroleptics are indicated when treatment adherence is problematic.
* Polypharmacy is common yet not supported by evidence.
* The goal of treatment is stability on monotherapy at the lowest effective dose.

==== Psychological (Individual and Family Interventions) ====
*Good evidence: 
:*Education of patient and carers
:*Reduction of high expressed emotion:  shown to affect relapse rates
:*Supportive, solution oriented psychotherapy
*Unclear benefit:
:*Cognitive behavioral therapy
:*Cognitive and functional rehabilitation
:*Self–help unclear

==== Social ====
* Good evidence: 
:*Regular intensive case management
* Unclear benefit:
:* As needed case management
:* Consumer based organizations

=== Prognosis ===
15-25% of patients diagnosed with schizophrenia have one episode and no residual impairment. 25-40% have recurrent episodes and no residual impairment. 5-10% have recurrent episodes and develop significant non-progressive impairment. 30-40% have recurrent episodes and develop significant progressive impairment. Therefore, the majority of patients do not recover fully BUT DO NOT have a chronic unremitting course. There is little evidence that antipsychotics have altered the course of illness for most patients. However, evidence suggests that prolonged psychosis which is untreated has a bad prognosis. Suicide rate is up to 15%.&lt;ref name=&quot;DSM&quot;/&gt;

Good prognostic factors:
* Female gender
* Older age of onset
* Married
* Higher socioeconomic status
* Living in a developing (as opposed to developed) country
* Good premorbid personality
* No previous psych history
* Good education and employment record
* Acute onset, affective symptoms, good adherence to medication.

Predicting risk of suicide:
* Acute exacerbation of psychosis
* Depressive symptoms
* History of attempted suicide
* Male gender
* Command auditory hallucinations

== Schizophreniform Disorder ==
==== Clinical Manifestations and Diagnosic Considerations ==== 
The clinical presentation is identical to schizophrenia, however impairment in function is not a requirement. The required duration of symptoms is of at least a month but less than 6 months. If symptoms persist for longer than 6 months it is appropriate to change the diagnosis to schizophrenia.&lt;ref name=&quot;DSM&quot;/&gt; The diagnosis requires for other pathologies that may be responsible for the clinical manifestations (e.g., medical and drug use) to be ruled out before a diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder is made. It is not clear if schizophreniform disorder is a different disorder or just a more acute, better prognosis type of schizophrenia.

==== Subtypes/Specifiers ====
'''With good prognostic features''':
* Good premorbid level of function
* Abrupt onset
* Confusion
* Absence of flat affect
'''Without good prognostic features''': when less than 2 of the above features are present&lt;ref name=&quot;DSM&quot;/&gt;

==== Epidemiology ==== 
The prevalence is low overall. There may be differences between developed countries (estimated around 0.2%) and developing countries (estimated around 1%).&lt;ref name=&quot;DSM&quot;/&gt;

==== Treatment Considerations ====
* Hospitalization is recommended if the acute psychotic symptoms result in danger to self or others or significant impairment.
* Acute psychosis should be treated with antipsychotics. Second generation antipsychotics, with the exception of olanzapine, are preferred first line. 
* Treatment should be continued for one year and reassessed after.
* Supportive and solution oriented psychotherapy is beneficial.

==== Prognosis ==== 
About one third of the patients recover. The rest of the patients initially diagnosed with schizophreniform disorder progress to schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.&lt;ref name=&quot;DSM&quot;/&gt;

== Brief Psychotic Disorder ==
==== Clinical Manifestations and Diagnosic Considerations ====
Phenomenologically there is no difference between brief psychotic disorder (BPD), schizophreniform disorder, and schizophrenia. The difference between these three diagnoses is based on symptom duration. As indicated by its name, the duration of symptoms in BPD are brief: more than 1 day but less than 1 month. When the symptoms last longer than a month but less than 6 months the diagnosis changes to schizophreniform disorder. The psychotic symptoms should not be part of a pre-existing medical, drug induced, or primary psychiatric condition (including other psychotic or mood disorders).&lt;ref name=&quot;DSM&quot;/&gt;

==== Subtypes/Specifiers ====
DSM-IV-TR specifiers include:
* With marked stressor(s) (brief reactive psychosis)
* Without marked stressor(s)
* With postpartum onset: when onset of symptoms is within 4 weeks postpartum&lt;ref name=&quot;DSM&quot;/&gt;

==== Epidemiology ==== 
Rare overall but more frequent in developing countries compared to developed countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;DSM&quot;/&gt;

==== Treatment Considerations ==== 
Hospitalization is recommended if the acute psychotic symptoms result in danger to self or others or significant impairment. Neuroleptics for short term treatment should be considered on a case by case basis.

==== Prognosis ==== 
By definition full remission of symptoms and return to prior level of functioning is expected within a month.

== Schizoaffective Disorder ==
==== Clinical Manifestations and Diagnostic Considerations ====
The patient presents with symptoms of schizophrenia, mania, depression or a combination of mood and psychotic symptoms. The history is significant for at least one distinct episode of psychosis not overlapping with mood symptoms and a relative temporal predominance of mood symptoms.

Differential diagnoses should include drug induced and medical conditions with secondary psychotic symptoms. While patients with schizophrenia can experience mood symptoms their duration is relatively short relative to the total duration of illness. When the psychotic symptoms represent a culmination of a severe mood episode a diagnosis of mood disorders (i.e., bipolar and major depression) with psychotic features should also be included in the differential. &lt;ref name=&quot;DSM&quot;/&gt;

==== Epidemiology ==== 
Unclear but possibly less common than schizophrenia.&lt;ref name=&quot;DSM&quot;/&gt;

==== Treatment Considerations ==== 
Hospitalization is recommended if the acute psychotic symptoms result in danger to self or others or significant impairment.

Antipsychotics are recommended for acute psychotic symptoms. Second generation antipsychotics (SGA), excluding olanzepine, should be considered as first line. Mood stabilizers including lithium, valproic acid, and carbamazepine, or SGA are recommended for acute manic symptoms. A neuroleptic-mood stabilizer combination may work better than either agent alone, and augmenting a neuroleptic with lithium or valproic acid should be considered as an augmentation strategy in cases of poor response to neuroleptic monotherapy. Antidepressants should be used conservatively for depressive symptoms. Close monitoring is required as an antidepressant can precipitate a manic switch in a patient with schizoaffective disorder.

==== Prognosis ====
Better than schizophrenia but not as good as mood disorders.&lt;ref name=&quot;DSM&quot;/&gt;

== Delusional Disorder ==
==== Clinical Manifestations and Diagnostic Considerations====
The patient presents with non-bizarre delusional beliefs but most often the mental status examination is otherwise fairly normal. The delusional ideas are restricted to a specific subject and do not contaminate other mental processes. Other psychotic symptoms may include olfactory/gustatory hallucinations, which may be prominent and are closely related to the main delusional themes.  If prominent auditory/visual hallucinations are present a diagnosis of schizophrenia rather than delusional disorder may be more appropriate. Associated symptoms are rare but may include mood or anxiety symptoms. When present, such symptoms are often secondary to the delusional beliefs (e.g., &quot;of course I feel anxious with the NSA following me around the clock&quot;). Other conditions (medical, drug induced, other primary psychiatric disorders, including other psychotic or mood disorders) cannot better explain the clinical picture.&lt;ref name=&quot;DSM&quot;/&gt;

==== Subtypes/Specifiers ====
* Erotomanic type: the patient erroneously believes that another person is in love with him/her
* Grandiose type: the patient erroneously believes that he/she possesses enormous wealth, power, authority, knowledge, or has a special relationship to a deity or famous person 
* Jealous type: the patient erroneously believes that his/her partner is unfaithful 
* Persecutory type: the patient erroneously that he/she is targeted for punishment or retaliation
* Somatic type: the patient erroneously believes that he/she has a medical condition or body deformity that is overlooked or misdiagnosed
* Mixed type: delusions characteristic of more than one of the above types but without any one dominating theme
* Unspecified type&lt;ref name=&quot;DSM&quot;/&gt;

==== Epidemiology ==== 
Rare. According to DSM-IV-TR estimated around 0.03% in the general population; 1-2% of all inpatient psychiatric admissions. The most common subtype is the persecutory type.&lt;ref name=&quot;DSM&quot;/&gt;

==== Treatment Considerations ==== 
Hospitalization is recommended if the acute psychotic symptoms result in danger to self or others or significant impairment. 

==== Prognosis ====
Variable: the jealous type may wane and wax or remit; the persecutory type is often chronic.&lt;ref name=&quot;DSM&quot;/&gt;

== Shared Psychotic Disorder (Folie à Deux) ==
==== Clinical Manifestations and Diagnostic Considerations ====
Mental status examination is significant for non-bizarre delusions but otherwise is within normal limits. There are minimal associated mood or anxiety symptoms; if present such symptoms appear secondary to the tenaciously held delusional beliefs. History is significant for a close relationship with another person who presents with similar delusional beliefs and meets criteria for a psychotic disorder. The patient who first presents with delusional symptoms is designated as the &quot;primary,&quot; the &quot;secondary&quot; follows. Also, usually, the primary is dominant in his/her relationship with the secondary, who acts as a more passive recipient. For example, a parent with schizophrenia and chronic paranoid delusions about FBI surveillance may be the primary while his/her child, who only recently started to believe that indeed there are FBI cameras hidden on their property, is the secondary. Other diagnoses, including medical or drug induced disorders as well as other psychotic or mood disorders, should be excluded if folie à deux is to be diagnosed.&lt;ref name=&quot;DSM&quot;/&gt;

==== Epidemiology ====
Rare overall but statistics may be misleading due to under-reporting. Preliminary data suggest an increased prevalence in women.&lt;ref name=&quot;DSM&quot;/&gt;

==== Treatment Considerations ====
Hospitalization is recommended if the acute psychotic symptoms result in danger to self or others or significant impairment. Usually removing the secondary from the primary's environment is sufficient to promote complete remission of symptoms. In addition, the primary's condition should be treated as indicated. Interestingly, a remission of the primary's symptoms is followed by the remission of the secondary's delusional beliefs.

==== Prognosis ====
When the secondary is separated from the primary the prognosis is good.&lt;ref name=&quot;DSM&quot;/&gt;
