== Overview ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Viktor Krum|Viktor Krum]] arrives with the delegation from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Durmstrang Institute|Durmstrang Institute]] to take part in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Triwizard Tournament|Triwizard Tournament]]. He becomes attracted to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], making [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] jealous, though Ron does not realize this at the time. Though Viktor is quite clearly trying to take things to the next stage with Hermione, she gently rebuffs him, and they stay pen-pals until Ron and Hermione become a couple. Viktor then suggests, in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]]'s hearing, that he would like to meet [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]]. Harry tells him that Ginny is going out with someone very big who gets angry easily.

== Event Details ==

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Viktor Krum|Viktor Krum]] arrives for the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Triwizard Tournament|Triwizard Tournament]] as part of the delegation from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Durmstrang Institute|Durmstrang Institute]]. He seems to be spending significant time in the library, something that irritates [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] because of the gaggle of giggling girls that seems to follow him around.

At the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Yule Ball|Yule Ball]], we discover that Hermione has been asked to the ball by Viktor Krum. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] is quite upset by this, saying that Hermione is &quot;consorting with the enemy&quot;.

In the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Second Task|Second Task]] of the Triwizard Tournament, the four Champions must each retrieve something valuable to them from the bottom of the lake. The thing that is valuable to Viktor is Hermione. Having rescued Hermione, Viktor is apparently having a fairly intense conversation with her on the shore. An article that appears in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Witch Weekly|''Witch Weekly'']] shortly afterwards, written by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rita Skeeter|Rita Skeeter]], says that Krum has invited Hermione to spend the summer with him. Hermione admits that this is true, but wonders how Rita had found out.

Viktor takes [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] aside in late May and asks him if Hermione is his girlfriend. Harry is rather surprised by this, and says no. Viktor says that Hermione is always talking about Harry, and Harry insists that it is because they are friends.

We don't see much other interaction between Viktor and Hermione, but by this time it is pretty clear that Viktor is romantically interested in Hermione.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

While Viktor Krum does not play any particular role in this book, we see that Hermione is writing a very long letter to him as Christmas holidays approach. Hermione says that he's just a pen-pal, but Ron comments that he would like to be a lot more than that.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

Harry and Ron catch [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dean Thomas|Dean]] snogging in a corridor. In the ensuing quarrel, Ginny says that Harry has snogged [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cho Chang|Cho]], Hermione has snogged Viktor, and Ron is simply jealous because he doesn't have anyone to snog.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

Viktor has been invited to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bill Weasley|Bill]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fleur Delacour|Fleur's]] wedding. Hermione is taken aback to see him there. Harry, in disguise, stops to talk with him. Viktor is looking sourly at Ron and Hermione out on the dance floor. Seeing Ginny, he asks if Harry knows her. Harry replies that she is going out with somebody large and bad-tempered. Viktor angrily asks what is the point of being famous if all the best girls are already taken?

== Notable Consequences ==

Krum's ongoing attempts to become more than a pen-pal to Hermione eventually result in Ron's committing himself. It is entirely possible that Ron would leave his relationship with Hermione languishing if Krum had not been trying to take Hermione for himself.

It is unknown whether Krum would have attended Bill and Fleur's wedding if Hermione was not likely to be present. It is certain that she seems more surprised that he will be attending than he is at finding her there. If Krum's appearance at the wedding is a consequence of this relationship, then so also are Harry's discoveries about the identity of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gregorovitch|Gregorovitch]], and the use of the symbol of the Deathly Hallows as the mark of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gellert Grindelwald|Grindelwald]].

== Analysis ==

There is no way of knowing exactly how much has been going on between Viktor and Hermione. True, Ginny does tell Ron that Hermione and Viktor have been snogging, but this is not conclusive, as Ginny at the time is mid-quarrel with Ron, and is trying to hurt him with words. It is entirely possible that Ginny is going from what is public knowledge and expanding on it for effect. It is certainly true, as we see later, that Viktor would like to spend time snogging with Hermione; what is not so certain is whether he actually has done so. Hermione, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Hermione Granger|as we see here]], has clearly set her sights on Ron early in the series, and it is uncertain whether she would choose to jeopardize her relationship with Ron by being known to be snogging with Viktor.

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

Key to the enjoyment of any piece of fiction is belief in its characters; without believable characters, one simply does not care about the story. The author had plotted out this story to cover a span of nearly seven years, in the lives of characters starting the series at age 11. Knowing that her characters were going to go through adolescence, she also chose to write their relationships as an integral part of the story, rather than simply ignoring them in favour of the main quest, as is common in heroic fiction. As Viktor is an incidental figure and off stage for much of the series, of course, we cannot get much of a feel for his character's growth; in fact, his behaviour at Bill and Fleur's wedding would indicate that he has matured very little since we first met him, three years earlier. Krum still seems to evince the belief that he is irresistible to women on account of his fame as the Bulgarian national Quidditch team Seeker. While we cannot say this shows perceptiveness on the part of the author, as many sports professionals exhibit a similar behaviour, it is certainly true that the author has managed to write this character most convincingly.

== Overview ==

'''''Ancient Runes''''' is the study of runic writing. Runes are characters designed to be scratched onto hard surfaces such as rock, and are almost entirely made up of straight lines. This subject is offered as an elective, taught in years three, four, and five; those with sufficiently high [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/OWL exams|O.W.L. marks]] in the course can then go on to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/NEWT exams|N.E.W.T.-level study]] in years 6 and 7.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

We first hear mention of Ancient Runes as a course in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']], around Easter. The first two years of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]]'s education have been taken up with the basics: [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Potions|Potions]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Charms|Charms]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Transfiguration|Transfiguration]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Herbology|Herbology]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/History of Magic|History of Magic]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Astronomy|Astronomy]], with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Flying|Flying]] taking the place of Muggle physical education. As the beginning of the third year approaches, students must choose a set of electives to add to these core subjects. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] chooses all the available subjects, including Ancient Runes, and stays with Ancient Runes until the end of her time at Hogwarts.

Hermione makes use of her understanding of Ancient Runes in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], where she is bequeathed an ancient copy of ''The Tales of Beedle the Bard''. It is her ability to decipher these runes that allows us to hear the Tale of the Three Brothers, and so become enlightened in the nature of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]].

As only Hermione takes this class, we do not see any of it. It is possible that it is taught by Bathsheba Babbling, but we never meet the professor of the course.

== Analysis ==

The sole purpose of the introduction of this course seems to be to allow Hermione to be able to read the copy of ''the Tales of Beedle the Bard'' bequeathed to her by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]]. One would think that the purpose of this legacy could have been equally carried out by a version of the book written in English. However, creating of the book in runes serves two purposes. First, it indicates in no uncertain terms that the book is extremely old, being written in an alphabet no longer used. This serves, among other things, to reinforce that the tales in this edition are as close to the original as is possible. Second, it requires Hermione to spend time trying to figure out the meaning of the sigil of the Deathly Hallows as it appears over the one tale in that book, requiring that she bring Harry into her thoughts about the symbol, and thus connecting it to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gellert Grindelwald|Grindelwald]]'s mark, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Xenophilius Lovegood|Xeno Lovegood]], and the signature on one of Dumbledore's letters as reproduced in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rita Skeeter|Rita Skeeter]]'s book.

The only other place we see ancient runes is on Dumbledore's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Pensieve|Pensieve]]. Though Harry notes them, we don't think Hermione ever does, and they play no part in the story except as decoration, and possibly an indication of the Pensieve's age.

== Overview ==

'''''Banishing Charms''''' are the opposite of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Accio|Summoning Charms]], and are used to send an object away from the caster.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

Banishing charms are more difficult than summoning charms as you are not only impelling an object to move, but ideally you are also telling it where to move to. In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Filius Flitwick|Professor Flitwick]]'s class, we see that while nearly everyone has managed to send objects away from themselves (though in the case of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]]'s efforts, sometimes it is the wrong object), only the best of the students is able to send their pillows unerringly into the box where they are intended to go.

We never hear the actual invocation of the banishing charm.

'''How to make command form (명령형 [命令形])of verbs'''&lt;br&gt;
First, we must specify if we are speaking to someone who is older or higher in position than us, or to someone who is younger or lower in position. With children, we may use the less polite (verb stem + 라) form. This form is also used when someone is angry or when giving military commands.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt; 음식을 먹으세요! &lt;/font&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Eat your meal!&lt;br&gt;

When you are asking someone politely to do something for you, use (verb stem + 어/아 주다) form:
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;보여 주세요!&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Please show me.&lt;br&gt;

주다 literally means &quot;to give,&quot; but does not translate directly.&lt;br&gt;

When we want to talk modestly about ourselves we use the (verb stem + 드리다) form instead. &quot;드리다&quot; also means &quot;to give,&quot; but is an honorific verb.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;책을 보여 드렸어요
&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I have shown the book.
&lt;br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Industry Flowchart=
The TRS2004 and TRS2006 manuals include a very useful flowchart which shows the possible routings of products between the built-in industries, for example indicating that logs can be loaded at forestries and unloaded at lumber mills and seaports.

This flowchart can be found in section 9.3 of the TRS2004 Engineers Handbook and section 12.11.3 of the TRS2006 manual.

The flowchart excludes the &quot;Multiple Industry&quot; industries since they can be configured to behave as desired. It also naturally excludes any non-built-in industries and products.

Unfortunately both copies of the flowchart have the following misprints:
* An arrow should be added from General Goods to Airport.
* The arrow from 20/40ft Containers to Airport should be deleted.
* The arrow from Crude Oil to Airport should be deleted.

=Industry Compatible Rolling Stock=
When placing rolling stock in Surveyor, each item of rolling stock has a thumbnail image in the rolling stock righthand panel. If the item is compatible with the built-in industry system, it will have an &quot;IND&quot; icon in its thumbnail. Only rolling stock with the IND icon will operate with the built-in industries.

To explore which products a rolling stock item can carry, place it on a track in Surveyor, click the question mark button in the rolling stock righthand panel, then click the vehicle. A dialogue box will appear and its various options can be explored.

=Loading And Unloading=
Each industry has a separate length of track for each of its inputs and outputs.  Multiple Industries New is the raw track, BI2 (bi2) grain, gravel etc are prepackaged instances of LARS enabled track and are much easier to use.

Some industries only have inputs, some only have outputs, some have both. Sometimes there are two separate loading/unloading sections and the track in between is already in place as part of the industry.

In some cases trains must be stopped in order for products to be loaded or unloaded. If there are more wagons than will fit in the relevant section of track, the train must be moved along in stages.

In other cases trains must continue to move but at a slow speed in order for products to be loaded or unloaded.

Unloading depends on the wagons having suitable products to unload, and the industry having space to accept them.

Loading depends on the wagons having space, and the industry having the goods available.

Industry production depends on the industry having sufficient goods in its goods inwards area and space in its goods outwards area. There is also an option to make some industries also dependant on an electricity supply.

=Additional Comments=


Basically products are associated with industries (special track) and wagons or coaches. They are generated or consumed by industries at a given rate that normally can be set in surveyor.

The config.txt file has product queues which control which products (kuids) can be loaded on each wagon or coach. Passengers are just a special case of product by the way.

Wagons and coaches have special points on the mesh that mean something to Trainz, a.bog0 and a.bog1 for example are the bogey attachment points.

If a load attachment point (a.load0 a.load1 etc) is present on the mesh then it can be referenced in the config.txt file by one of the product queues to say that if the product is present then attach this kuid to that attachment point. This gives you a visible load. In general if the attachment point is not present on the mesh then you can't get a visible load. However it is possible to create a second mesh, referenced in the config.txt file, which has the attachment point on so you can get a visible load to appear on a wagon that does not have load attachment points.

Bulk loads work by using a second mesh.

The various types of &quot;Multiple Industry&quot; industries can be configured to input and output various products.

LARS is a particular set of products that are designed to work smoothly together. For example by using LARS standard products for coal mines can ship coal that power stations etc recognise as coal. More details are available from Trainz Pro Routes, a third-party Trainz fansite.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Overview==
Trainz is longest produced evolving series (or family) of railroad simulators, with no end in sight having released products for hand held devices and power computers in recent years. Every competitor to arise, but one faded in less than five years. The one survivor actually performs to a different niche and is but for one product unavailable outside of Japan. Another initially stole some market share by jumping in the high definition video, 64 bit processor technologies quicker, but have faded in sales because the simulator strictly constrains the creative side of the die hard railroad enthusiasts who still gather and build physical model railroads, but have bent more of their energies to club grade activity and creations on the Trainz series.

The following is an attempt at a realistic minimum set of hardware specifications for the various programs in the long series of Trainz simulators. It must be understood, that the system is extensible, and while newer versions have had improvements and better graphics, the series by and large can import assets from a previous earlier version into the newer software, albeit sometimes with minor patching. The Trainz database system using a coding system called 'kuid' tagging (a unique identifier for an object), not only allows one to select compatible extensions, but also to select and get a more recent version as the code contains version controls as well. With any of the fully capable products (A few driver only versions have been produced) a large subset of the 100,000 plus items (assets) on the manufacturers Download Station servers are available for free to extend the purchasers railroading experience. The server automatically blocks downloads of assets that are too evolved for compatibility with the users Trainz version.

TRS2012 with [[w:Speedtree|Speedtree]] technology and picture like realism is the first of the series to fully break backwards compatibility by additional graphics demands and requiring added graphical or data elements to be defined and the million strong Trainz user community has been busily upgrading old assets to the new more demanding graphical needs since the programs release in late 2011, rapidly uploading fixed '12 compatible assets. TRS2010 supported both the older technologies in compatibility mode, and was able to exploit a computer with 64 bit architecture, which is required to run both the next generations, TRS2012 and TRS2013 Trainz simulators.

In running simulator software, the aim is to display a high enough number of frames per second so the trains movement looks realistic. Normally 24 fps is used as a benchmark target for films so that can be used as a reference standard. Flicker is noticeable to the human visual senses at about 15-16 fps. The Trainz experience looks best with a monitor, video card and microprocessor architecture which can support frame rates towards the higher film end of the continuum. Context switching, or the execution speed to update to an entirely different part of the railway is a second concern, but a fast video system and processor capable of switching to a scene 20-60 miles away without noticeable pause is desirable. 

The forum has some hardware benchmarking threads so different machines can be compared.`The results of these measures, performed by a critical audience we report below.

==Trainz on Windows==

Trainz utilizes millions of calculations and code which must produce a rotatable, angle changeable moving view presented as a three dimensional surrounding along a line of sight (not just a single picture) at a particular altitude and angle that looks as natural as possible and is unsurprisingly, also very dependent on the video card and the amount of memory on the machine. A 1.83 Ghz&amp;mdash;2.4 GHz [[w:Pentium 4|Pentium 4]] cpu (produced in 2000) with 2 gigs of memory and an NVIDIA GeForce Go 7300 GT or GeForce Go  7600, or ATI 850 XT PE video card will give acceptable performance at the low end for versions prior to TRS2009. Long routes or medium sized layouts with a lot of activity will tax that into some hesitations and occasional jitter or slight delays when asked to change the frame of reference, but are overall still quite playable. Setting the default Resource cache size in the Options settings to 256 or 512 pages will ease many visual flickers in older systems. Auran has claimed running Trainz on a laptop is neither recommended nor supported, but it's (both TRS2004/2006) been run successfully for four years on''  '[http://www.notebookreview.com/default.asp?newsID=3060 this mid-range laptop]' (7 years old) ''with a 1.83 gHz early dual core processor and its built in GeForce Go 7600 video), though this system is sometimes taxed into minor stuttering an flickering on very large routes (layouts) when passing trains or a large yard or many AI Drivers load up the session's graphical demands.

* [[w:Central processing unit|Processor]]: With Windows XP 2.6GHz. With Windows Vista, Windows 7 or Windows 8, probably something roughly twice as powerful. There is considerable debate as to whether or not Trainz makes effective use of multiple cores in dual or quad core processors.   One SLI benchmark saw a small increase in performance when a dual core processor had one core disabled, others claim multiple cores are used.  Given the basic program was written some time ago and the general feeling amongst programmers that writing code that can make effective use of multiple cores for gaming is difficult it is unlikely that Trainz can make use of more than one core.
* [[w:RAM|RAM]]: With Windows XP at least 1GB. With Windows Vista at least 2GB. Adding RAM beyond these figures may or may not improve performance, depending on the layout.  More complex layouts can make use of more memory.  A major cause of stuttering is memory shortage, Trainz can make use of 2 gigs of memory,  XP likes 512mb so 2.5 gigs of memory is the most that Trainz can make use of on a 32 bit version of XP.  Running 64 bit Vista with 8 gigs of memory has given satisfactory performance for some users.
* [[w:Video card|Video board]]: The program was written using OpenGL on nVidia video cards but runs well on ATI usually running directX. At least an nVidia 7300GT 256MB or equivalent. The nVidia GeForce Go 7600 GT preferably, though by 2013 standards, these are now both very old video technology. The power of the video board's processor is of critical importance to the performance of Trainz.
* [[w:Hard disk drive|Hard disk]]: At least 10GB of free space. TRS2004 takes about 4GB to install. Other Hard Drive assets will be consumed by disk caching.

The program may run with a lower spec computer but only with likely stuttering. Even a much more powerful computer can struggle with a complex layout. Such effects are most evident in a complex yard where the graphics engine has to resolve complex track and scenery interactions.

Choice of content, both layout objects and variety of rolling stock, also affects performance; particularly when several variegated consists are within viewing distance. Some objects are significantly more visually complex than others. In addition a variety of different types of objects has far more effect on performance than multiple copies of the same type of object. For example, a train with fifteen identical coal wagons will have less impact on performance than a train with fifteen different types of wagons.

==Trainz on MAC==

==Trainz Driver on iOS==
Apples' [[w:iOS|iOS]], formerly iPhone OS allows users to run applets that use a cut down version of Trainz without Surveyor, download manager and the like. It has been extended to support other Apple devices such as the iPad and Apple TV.

==Trainz Driver on Android==

Trainz driver on Android requires an Android Tablet with [[w:Tegra|Tegra 2]]. It is not compatible with Android based smartphones, but has been reported to run fine on the original Kindle.&lt;!-- see amazon reviews ---&gt;

== Introduction &amp; Historical overview ==

Trainz 2009, 2010, and 2012 (TS12) are post Windows Vista/Windows 7 operating system editions, for the purposes of most computers, the unsuccessful Windows Vista has such narrow coverage and is so similar to Windows 7, herein they are normally considered and discussed identically. Trainz 2004 and Trainz 2006 were Window XP releases written before Windows Vista was released, and initially seemed to experience some compatibility issues which remained unresolved by Auran (now N3V, though still utilizing Auran as a registered [[w:Trademark|Trademark]]) for some time. In point of fact these were not problems with Trainz, but manifestations of a more general issue with the Windows Data Structure Model and the way the operating system, as the family evolved was written to allow multiple users use the same computer with their own private 'User' run time environment with expected 'privacy fences' in the corporate world. These issues became even more severe under the release of Windows 7 and Windows 8, each of which catered further to the corporate desire to have strict controls on the users access to data and program installation over the interests of mere home users of personal computers. In a nutshell, in the corporate world, the Windows Data Model assumes a shared data area, private user data areas (...\Documents and Settings\Users\User name\Desktop\Documents etcetera under \Desktop with some run time data, usually customizations for users for such as word processors or spreadsheet default setups under \User name\Application Data\'' Software suite names''.

Once the interplay of Windows versus Trainz software was recognized, Auran/N3V adapted: Trainz classics and Trainz 2009 were formulated to drop the animated loader launched lead-in 'splash screen' video as Trainz loaded itself in memory and so became more compatible with Windows Vista and successors. The older Trainz releases loading issues were solved by properly setting a configuration. Note in the next section how installing an options switch in the software suites (.ini style) initialization file Trainzoptions.txt to disable the video was the most critical fix in the older best sellers of the family. 

;&lt;big&gt;The Secret of Avoiding Permissions problems&lt;/big&gt;
The true secret to avoiding problems with the corporate biases of Windows is to run everything as The Administrator, including setting even the check-box click settings Properties in the new style Desktop shortcuts and in ...users\username\start menu\Program Files\... shortcuts to run as Administrator. Failing this measure, you may find yourself uninstalling Trainz then reinstalling it. Be aware that such steps are The surest and best way is to 
:1) Set a System Restore point; 
:2) reboot the computer before any installing software on Windows after XP-SP3;
::2a) As an option, before rebooting run msconfig.exe and disable everything in the startup keys but keyboard, mouse, video, and network support. (This is the best way to do [4] below; satisfies the need the best way as also turns off things like skype, dropbox, updates monitoring, etc.&amp;mdash; all the little parasite utilities that such up machine cycles and memory, ''freeing both for the installation of what is likely the most complicated software package any common individual is likely to own.'')
:3) ''LOG IN AS ADMINISTRATOR'', using the Administrator default environment, desktop, etc.
:4) Windows installations will establish a secure HTTPS connection, so defensive/protection software will just slow things down that will take a lot of time regardless. Disable (temporarily) any defensive software such as anti-malware and anti-virus checkers, especially. Both try to vett new data written to your hard drive, and you're installing complex binary packed files from the manufacturer. Not a security issue. Feel free to leave web browser security plugins enabled&amp;mdash;but find a good book, watch television and otherwise plan to leave the computer alone for a while.
:5) find the downloaded installer file, ''right-click-drag'' on the drop down menu to '''run as Administrator'''; (sound familiar?)
::5a) If you have two or more hard disc drives (HDD) it is best to install Trainz to a different drive than Windows. This will aid context swapping as Windows TEMP files, caches and swap files will be on the other drive and ''writing data 'drive to drive' is far faster'' than writing place to place within the same HDD.
::5b) It is best to install Trainz directly off the ROOT of the target HDD &amp;mdash;you will find manipulating assets in Trainz sometimes requires editing files and you will save tons of time having them several directory folders higher in the folder hierarchy. 
:6) Be advised Trainz base install can take a while (1/2 to 2 hours), but software updates, including some that want to auto-launch when you next run Trainz can take 4-5 times that duration as the data base must sometimes be converted. 
::6a) Launch any updates when ready for bed, or you won't miss the computer for a while as with the install. Since these trigger in succession, Trainz may ask you to install available 'updates' a number of times in succession, after each launch. The messages issued is minimal an quite inadequate for lengthy updates (particularly for new customers) and the consequent confusion is large, even to those of us familiar with some of the less professional Auran/N3V behaviors. {{TrainzTip|They are a small company after all, servicing a niche market. Manpower and too few people looking at planning give them a narrow outlook at times... the web community fixes the latter soon enough usually, but that's why the updates you're about to suffer occur. }}
 
===Consider an update an new install===
As a further good practice to avoid troubles, while installing any Trainz from DVD or the cloud, or running Content Manager for a large download of free assets, temporarily disable antivirus, and Anti-malware scanner software and any such monitoring software that scans files and generally slows down the data streaming process. This suggestion does not include disabling the parts of Anti-malware and Anti-virus browser extensions of your browser if you're installing or reinstalling a Trainz version using the browser to access a purchase at the Auran.com store or a third party reseller such as Amazon.com, where in fact the first thing you download is a download manager which will establish a fast download path using FTP protocols ahead of actually downloading and launching the Trainz self-installer. Browser plug-in and extensions management will generally be accessible via Tools&gt;Options&gt;Advanced, but vary browser to browser. Disabling such may speed the download of the download manager, but when launched it is not using the browser facilities at all, so little benefit accrues from such a step. 

Quality Anti-Malware and Anti-Virus software will generally have the feature under properties of suspending their monitoring for various time periods, up to and including the next time you reboot; select a period of an hour or two, but stay off your browser.

== Installation ==
This step is to free up resources and minimize cycle stealing by background processes for the Trainz data base initialization is both memory and processor intensive.
* Set a System Restore Point as follows: 
:'''In XP''' &amp;mdash; Click 
::a. {{kp|Start}} &gt; Programs &gt; Accessories &gt; System Tools, and then click System Restore. {{indent
}}If this method does not show a shortcut for Restore, try instead
::b. {{kp|Start}} &gt; Run [type Restore][Enter] which should open the Restore folder, click ''''rstrui.exe'''' to launch system Restore. The System Restore Wizard opens. Instruct it to set a Restore Point, name it something like:'' 'Before Installing Trainz 20xx'. ''
:'''In 7 and Windows 8''' &amp;mdash; Click 
::a. {{kp|Start}} &gt; Control Panel &gt; '''Recovery'''  &amp;mdash; ''then {{kp|LMB-Click}} 'restore your files' ''in the left pane (looks like a hyperlink)
* Now close unnecessary resource stealing memory resident launchers and monitoring [[w:Architecture of Windows NT|kernels]]. About the only thing needed that will not get in the way to some extent is the Applications kernels controlling your internet access, and your video control such as [[w:NVIDIA|graphics card]] settings control panel launcher. These are passive settings facilities and do not consume significant resources.
* An alternative to the below one by one method would be to run the MSCONFIG utility (Start&gt;Run&gt;[msconfig][Enter]) and disable these memory resident kernels by specifying they not be initialized upon rebooting, then rebooting. This method has the objection that you might forget to re-enable such, whereas the below, will resume normal operation, the next time you reboot.
* Do close Scheduling software&amp;mdash;including the many auto-check for updates kernels, power management software, system health management software such as [[w:Advanced System Care|Advanced System Care]] and any disk or games optimizers, cloud synchronization software such as [[w:Dropbox|Dropbox]] and most other quick launch printer or graphic program resident software's memory resident kernels such as [[w:GIMP|GIMP]], [[w:Photoshop|Photoshop]], [[w:Solid Works|Solid Works]], as are listed in the lower right quick launch bar of Windows near the clock display. These are accessible through their properties: Right-Click-Hold until they open a drop down menu and then by dragging to options, or exit or suspend as the applet provides as options. A left click will usually launch the application or open a control window, so would be counterproductive.
* It is especially important during the install, and for a while after while the Trainz database cranks in self-checks and checks for updates to disable Anti-virus and Anti-malware scanning software, and file indexing software. Once the download manager expands the Trainz loader, the installation will for a time use up to 100% of CPU cycles, and you may see an alert to that effect from Windows. This is normal.
:* These are all 'start up' loaded facilities which will be restored by rebooting. When you are ready to install, only one to three kernal's should still be showing in the quick launch bar, in particular your internet kernal. 

* Before installing Trainz, right-click the setup.exe file, open the properties applet, and select the option to &quot;Run As Administrator&quot;. (Skip under Windows XP)
* Before installing Trainz, have ready to hand either from the boxed DVD sticker or by copying from the web download service your twenty digit 'serial number' installation key. If you have previously registered a version of Trainz, you'll also want your Trainz user ID as occurs in kuid codes for content you have created. A scrap of note paper is suggested, for the key code cannot be easily cut and pasted in place, as each field must be entered in four digit groups.
* After installation, disable the Trainz intro video. To do this in TRS2006, open ...\Auran\TRS2006\trainzoptions.txt in Notepad. Be sure to use Notepad or a similar text file editor such as Notepad++ which is available online as a [[w:Freeware|Freeware]] program under GNU licensing. Don't use Microsoft Works or Microsoft Word, or any software classed as a word processor; these place control codes and formatting embedding formatting data within the text content. This is a general rule for all [[w:.ini file|.ini type files]], and once you begin to create content, you will find Trainz has one for each asset called'' 'config.txt'.''
* Anywhere in the Trainzoptions.txt initialization file, add the following command on a line of its own and exactly as it is here:
&lt;pre&gt;-intro=disable&lt;/pre&gt;
Save the modified file. The procedure is identical for TRS2004 except for the folder name. This step may be omitted in Vista and later Windows releases if you set administrator permissions as follows.

==Installation path choices==
You can specify where you want the Trainz application to install early during the setup wizard operations. 
* Older releases of Trainz will usually ''default-install'' to ...\Program Files\Auran\TRS20xx; newer releases to ...\Program Files\N3V\TRS20xx (or \TS20xx); because many asset files sometimes need tweaked by hand editing many experienced Trainzers install to X:\N3V\... to have a much shortened pathname under the X:\N3V\TRS20xx\editing\assetFolderName pathname when editing in an asset folder, which then may better fit inside a multitab/multiwidow editor like Notepad++, or by accessing files on a browser.
{{TrainzTip|X:\... signifies some Disk Drive name in the foregoing; if you are running multiple hard drives and/or [[w:Solid State Drive|Solid State Drive]]s (SSDs), you will best benefit by installing Trainz in the fastest drive available, hence 'X' for that drive's prefix. On the downside, while access via a SSD is generally far faster, data storage in SSD's is far more expensive. A fast modern SATA drive is the best price vs performance compromise.}}

==Run everything as The Administrator==
This section is inapplicable to Windows XP, but necessary under all later Windows operating systems.
* Set Trainz so as to run as administrator, as follows. Open Windows Explorer, navigate to the ...\TRS20xx\'''bin folder'''.
* For each of the .EXE files in that folder, right-click the file and in Properties select the &quot;Run As Administrator&quot; option.
:: Failure to do so, may result in odd unexpected behavior, not least of which is the phenomenon of opening an asset for edit, then not being able to see the contents of the folder under the ...\editing folder.

== Resolving Problems ==

If you are experiencing problems running Trainz, start by downloading and installing the latest drivers, especially those for the video board. These can usually be obtained from the manufacturer's web site.

* Also download and install the latest version of DirectX from Microsoft's web site.
* Maximize your Windows swap file and give precedence to programs running in the foreground as follows:
:Start&gt;Settings&gt;Control Panel&gt;System&gt;Advanced (tab); Click ''''Performance'''', select the second Advanced Tab
:#Check off Programs under Processor Scheduling
:#Check off Programs under Memory usage (If you use a lot of [ALT]-[TAB] switching under other applications, leave this one alone.)
:#Click on [CHANGE] button under Virtual Memory, check off Custom size and set'' 'Initial Size' ''to at least 2048 Mbytes; set'' 'Maximum size' ''to 3076 Mbytes. 
:# Click on Okay at each level until you return to the normal windows. 
:# Use My Computer or Start&gt;Run&gt;[C:\][Enter] to open up the Windows drive, and right-click hold or [ALT][Enter] to open the HDD properties. Check and make sure you have at least 20% of the hard disk for Windows and browsers to use for caching, and if not, consider adding additional hard disk drives or an SSD.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Main|Trainz/Version And Build Numbers}}
Trainz service packs update the program so as to fix known bugs and usually also add additional features. Each major release version of Trainz has its own set of service packs. Service packs are free of charge when downloaded via the Internet via Auran.com.

* The last service pack for Trainz 1.1 was SP3, creating Trainz 1.3, under which most later sales took place.

* The last service pack released for TRS2004 is SP4.

* The only service pack released for TRS2006 is SP1. This is not available for the French and German/East European editions. For those editions, separate full-priced versions of TRS2006 which include SP1 are available. These are called TRS2007 or TRS2008.

* The three Trainz Classics releases are TRS2006 with different bundled content but SP1 preinstalled, so will not be upgraded by means of service packs. 

* TRS2009 had three Service Packs

* TRS2010 had two

* TRS2012 has one, but will be issuing at least one more after May 2013.

Unlike most modern software, there was no option within Trainz until TRS2009 to check for updates, then auto-download and install them. Instead, because of the advanced nature of the data base software, the entire process has to be performed manually. TRS2009&amp;mdash;TRS2012 will inform you that an update is available. Monitoring the Web Board at Auran.com, particularly the &quot;What's New&quot; forum will advise you of pending releases or newly available updates, including any [[w:Patch (computing)|Hot Fix]]es.

Before applying a service pack, backup all the assets you have created yourself or downloaded; these will generally reside in \local and \libraries folders. There is a definite risk of losing these assets during the service pack installation, particularly in TRS2006.

Before downloading a service pack, run Trainz and make a note of the build number displayed on the program's main menu, lower right hand corner. This uniquely defines the version, regional edition and service pack level.
* When downloading a service pack, the first number in the filename of the service pack file must match your build number. The slightest discrepancy in these numbers will cause the service pack installation to fail.
* The second number in the filename is the build number that will result after successfully installing the service pack.

* Some service packs can be downloaded from Auran's web site. Service packs for some regional editions of Trainz can be downloaded from the distribution company for the relevant country, for example'' 'Just Trains' for the Unite Kingdom. Some Trainz fansites also make some service packs available to their members.

Be sure to also obtain the full instructions for installing the service pack. ''It is absolutely vital to follow those instructions in every precise detail without omitting any of the steps.'' SP1 for TRS2006 is particularly unforgiving and will fail if there is the slightest deviation from the instructions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The view of a model can be manipulated using only the middle mouse button of a scrolling mouse. 

Pressing the middle mouse button (MMB) and dragging the cursor will spin the model. The action is analogous to placing your hand on the model and rolling it across the background - the near part of the model moves with the cursor.

Using the scroll wheel zooms in and out. Scrolling down pulls the MODEL towards you - imagine pulling the scroll wheel towards you - and scrolling up does the opposite. (This action is the opposite of many applications like online maps programs, and even other CAD programs).

You can also use the scroll wheel to pan, but this takes some practice. Move the cursor to the side of the screen you want to pan away from &amp; zoom out (scroll up), then move the cursor to the other side of the screen and zoom in (scroll down).

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
Rome was one of the first great international powers in the world.  While it was founded by the wealthy citizens of one small Italian city-state, its political system eventually embraced Spaniards and Syrians, Gauls and Greeks, Celts and Copts. In the later period of Rome's history, emperors were drawn from all over the empire: Philip the African came from modern-day Morocco; Hadrian came from Spain; Elagabulus came from Syria; Constantine the Great was born in Britain.

The city of Rome itself was founded sometime between 850 and 700 BC (traditional date is 753 BC), and it remained a minor town for a hundred years after that.  The Etruscans, whose confederation of towns to the north lends its name to the modern Italian province of Tuscany, took over the city relatively peacefully around 640 BC, and a series of kings governed the town for more than a century thereafter.  The kings made a number of investments in the city's infrastructure, including the construction of a wall, a drain to clear water from the Roman Forum, a wooden bridge over the River Tiber, and a temple to Jupiter on the Capitoline Hill.

In 509 BC, the Romans grew tired of Etruscan rule, and expelled their king, Tarquin Superbus, from the city.  They established a Republic, which ruled Rome for the next four centuries.  The Republic was in essence a broad oligarchy, with the city's aristocrats dominating politics, economics and social life.  However, the Romans developed effective military and foreign policies, which enabled them to conquer first Italy, and enter into conflict with Carthage for control of the western Mediterranean Sea.  

By 100 BC, the Republic was fracturing.  Powerful men secured military commands and governorships abroad that brought them great wealth, but oppressed both foreigners and Roman citizens.  Conflicts arose regularly between the aristocrats and the common people, with the middle class holding a precarious balance of power between them.  Eventually, the system splintered, and two different gatherings of three powerful men, the Triumvirates, ruled Rome to their own advantage.  Both Triumvirates ended in civil wars.  In the end one man, Octavian Caesar, ruled Rome alone.  His accession to power marked the downfall of the Republic and the rise of the Empire.

Octavian took the title Augustus, and ruled from 27 BC to 14 AD.  In his forty-one years in power, he reorganized the military, regularized the bureaucracy and the coinage, and brought the Mediterranean world under a single law.  It was a spectacular achievement, but it was not achieved without grave costs.  Augustus established the ''Pax Romana'', or Roman Peace, throughout the western world, but never established a formal system for emperors to choose and acknowledge their successors.  The result was a continuing struggle for power at the center, and the Roman army regularly intervened in political matters.

As with any civilization, the Roman Empire experienced periods of decline and renewal over the next four hundred years.  A number of ancient historians have passed down stories from the lives of the Emperors that make for both dignified and salacious reading, and archeology has revealed much of the life of the Roman world.  In 79 AD, the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in southern Italy buried two whole Roman towns, Pompeii and Herculaneum.  Historians and archaeologists gained a valuable snapshot of life in the Roman Empire.  Excavations at other sites have revealed additional information.

In the end, Rome's internal decline coincided with the rising ambitions of its neighbors.  Beginning in the early 5th century AD, a series of invasions broke the Empire's long-standing border defenses, and huge populations of Germanic peoples swept through the western half of the Empire.  While the eastern Empire continued as the Byzantine Empire until 1453 AD, the western Empire was overrun. In 476 AD, the last Emperor in Rome, Romulus Augustulus, abdicated under pressure from a German general named Odoacer, who named himself King of Italy.  

=== Geography ===
The boot-shaped Italian peninsula should be familiar to most readers.  Italy has few natural harbors, and a spine of steep mountains, the Apennine range, runs north to south through the peninsula.   In the north, the Apennines jag to the west, creating a natural basin for the Po River valley to travel from west to east.  North of the Po valley, the Alps scrape the sky, their high and snow-covered peaks creating a relative isolation within Italy itself.

== The Tiber River ==

Rome sat on the eastern shore of the Tiber River, at the only easy crossing place between the river mouth and the mountains.   Seven hills rose there out of low and marshy ground.  By the beginning of the ninth century BCE, these seven hills were occupied by village communities who kept farms in the low-lying areas and retreated to their hilltops for defense.

The fording place on the river lay below a large island that was later dedicated to the Greek god of healing, Asclepius.  Sometime in the sixth century BCE, the romans under the direction of their Etruscan kings built a wooden bridge over the Tiber at this point, facilitating communications between northern and southern Italy, and joining the Etrurian confederation to the Greek colonial cities in the district of Magna Graecia.

== The Seven Hills ==

Archaeology suggests that Rome began as a confederation of villages on the seven hills of Rome: the Capitoline, Palatine, Aventine, Viminal, Quirinal, Esquiline, and the Caelian.   The low-lying ground between them was swampy and malarial.  Yet the presence of a natural fording place gave Rome some unusual advantages.  Once the seven villages united, and invested the time in constructing an early wall around their territory, they could charge a toll for the use of the ford (and later the bridge).  This was to prove an early source of Rome's wealth.  Graves dating from the ninth and eighth centuries BCE suggest two common forms of burial in the area:  cremation graves are clustered in Rome's Forum or marketplace, with a smattering of inhumations around them; a much larger cemetery lay in the valley between the Esquiline and Viminal hills.

Tradition and myth provides a much more interesting, if less likely, story of Rome's founding.  One of the [[Wikipedia:Vestal Virgins|Vestal Virgins]] of the nearby town of [[Wikipedia:Alba Longa|Alba Longa]] had a sexual encounter with the god Mars, and bore Romulus and Remus, twin sons who catalyzed the fortification of a small urban area in what is now Rome.  

=== Capitoline ===
Capitoline hill has deep roots in Roman history as its existence is acknowledged in the stories concerning the founding of Rome.

=== Palatine ===

=== Aventine ===

=='''Sphingolipids'''==

&lt;u&gt;'''Implications of Shotgun Lipidomics'''&lt;/u&gt;

[[Image:Sphingosine1phosphate.gif‎|right|thumb|300x200px|Spingosine 1-Phosphate]]
[[Image:Dihydrosphingosine-1-phosphate.gif‎|right|thumb|300x200px|dihydrosphingosine-1-phosphate]]

Shotgun lipidomic research was implemented for characterizing and quantizing sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and dihydrosphingosine-1-phosphate (DHS1P), with the use of precursor ion scanning of ''m/z'' 79.0 (corresponding to [PO3]-) in the negative-ion mode. S1P and DHS1P analysis was conducted on crude lipid extracts, in the presence of ammonium hydroxide. This particular approach produced a broad linear dynamic range and a detection limit at low amol/µl concentration for both S1P and DHS1P, and proved to be a simpler and more efficient method for the quantitative analysis of sphingoid base-1-phosphates than any other previously published method. The extensively examined factors that influence sphingoid base-1-phosphate quantization included ion suppression, extraction efficiency, and the potential overlapping with other molecular species. S1P and DHS1P mass levels were determined in samples of human plasma, mouse plasma, and mouse brain tissues. This new methodology is predicted to be an exceedingly useful tool for understanding sphingolipid metabolic pathways, as well as the contributions of sphingoid base-1-phosphates to future physiological and pathological research.

The specific biological analytes for the experiment were human plasma, mouse plasma, and mouse spinal cord and brain tissue extract, which included samples from the cortex, cerebellum and brain stem. Human plasma was sampled from healthy individuals ranging from sixty to seventy years of age. The resultant average yields of mass contents from the plasma of seven humans were 703  and 327 pmol/ml. In addition, researchers claim that their experimental results are the first to indicate the presence of S1P and DHS1P in the mouse tissue analytes. There were also substantial amounts of S1P and DHS1P found in mouse plasma that was believed to reflect sphingoid base-1-phosphate release from platelets, during blood coagulation. S1P and DHS1P levels of distribution were as follows, in the order of decreasing sphingolipid content: spinal cord, brain stem, cerebellum, and the cortex. S1P receptors were reported as being predominantly expressed in brain white matter, rat cerebellum and cerebellar granule cells, and astrocytes. Consequently, the parallel distribution of S1P and DHS1P to S1P receptor levels of expression indicates an interdependence between sphingoid base-1-phosphate ligands and their receptors.

Quantitatively analytical advantages of the experimental method implemented in this experiment include the ability for researchers to avoid using radioisotopes, chromatographic separation, and chemical derivatization, to obtain structural information of sphingoid base-1-phosphates, and to simultaneously detect S1P and DHS1P. Although, there may be some interference of this method if a phosphate-containing lipid molecular species possesses an identical ''m/z'' to S1P and/or DHS1P, such interference is already considered negligible, when attributed to overlapping phosphate-containing lipid molecular species that are present in mammalian samples. This unique methodology applied to shotgun lipidomics is expected to provide a myriad of uses for future physiological and pathophysiological research.

This website details the structure of lipid membranes of living cells. It describes the chemical 

makeup and the mobility of the lipid bilayer and the factors that affect membrane fluidity. The 

site goes on to describe the various types of proteins that can be associated with lipid 

membranes and the sugar chains that may extend from them.


'''Terms:'''

&lt;u&gt;ceramide&lt;/u&gt; - group of amides formed by linkage of a fatty acid to sphingosine, a lipid which has 

a long hydrocarbon tail and a polar domain containing an amino group.
http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/summary/summary.cgi?cid=5497136

&lt;u&gt;phosphoethanolamine&lt;/u&gt; - an ethanolamine derivative used to construct sphingomyelins.
http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/summary/summary.cgi?cid=1015

&lt;u&gt;isoprenoid&lt;/u&gt; - a polymer whose carbon skeleton consists wholly or partly of isoprene units 

joined end to end.

&lt;u&gt;depalmitoylation&lt;/u&gt; - hydrolysis of an ester linkage.

&lt;u&gt;pleckstrin homology domain&lt;/u&gt; - a protein domain of approximately 120 amino acids that occurs 

in a wide range of proteins involved in intracellular signaling or as constituents of the 

cytoskeleton.

&lt;u&gt;oligomer&lt;/u&gt; - a polymer that consists of two, three, or four monomers.


'''Connection:'''

Like this website discusses, we have studied the lipid bilayer and its chemical makeup in this 

course sequence. We focused in on the roles of proteins and lipids in the cell membrane, 

something this site also goes into detail about. The website also informs on of membrane 

mobility and fluidity and how fluidity is affected by various factors, another topic we discussed.

This source goes into great detail about membrane and membrane structure of both cells and 

cellular organelles. It discusses the various types of membrane lipids and how lipids are made 

up of fatty acids and even dives into fatty acid nomenclature. The site also describes both 

membrane permeability and mobility of its components.


'''Terms:'''

&lt;u&gt;amphipathic&lt;/u&gt; - molecule containing both polar and nonpolar domains.

&lt;u&gt;sonication&lt;/u&gt; - agitation of particles through the use of sound energy.

of membrane proteins.

&lt;u&gt;periplasm&lt;/u&gt; - the region between the two membranes containing the cell wall.


'''Connection:'''

In our course sequence we have talked about membrane components at the molecular level 

and described the membrane's fluidity and permeability, which is what this source discusses in 

depth. This online textbook also teaches how fluidity is affected by cholesterol and fatty acid 

content, which we discussed in class.


'''Online Source #3:'''


'''Membrane Structure and Function'''

'''Source:''' http://cellbio.utmb.edu/cellbio/membrane_intro.htm


'''Main Focus:'''

This site starts by introducing the history of how the structure of cell membranes was deduced 

and the various models that were proposed. It then discusses the present-day model and the 

structure of the fatty acids that make up the membrane bilayer. It describes how fatty acid 

structure, cholesterol and temperature all effect the fluidity of membranes. Finally, it goes on to 

describe the proteins and glycolipids that can be associated with the membrane.


'''Terms:'''

&lt;u&gt;microaggregate&lt;/u&gt; - a microscopic particle collection.

&lt;u&gt;microdomain&lt;/u&gt; - a lipid raft fortified with cholesterol that occurs in cell membranes.

&lt;u&gt;glycosphingolipids&lt;/u&gt; - a sphingolipid containing glucose or galactose.
http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/summary/summary.cgi?cid=9547206


'''Connection:'''

This website describes the makeup of the lipid bilayer, explaining the molecular structure of 

the fatty acids it consists of. We talked about the cellular membrane structure in our course 

sequence. In class we also talked about the factors that affect the fluidity of the membrane, 

something this site goes into immense detail about.


'''Peer-Reviewed Article #1:'''

'''Alteration of viral lipid composition by expression of the phospholipid floppase ABCB4 reduces HIV vector infectivity'''

'''Source:''' http://www.retrovirology.com/content/pdf/1742-4690-5-14.pdf


'''Main Focus:'''

This research involved studying the effect that a viral membrane lipid, phosphatidyl choline 

(PC), had on HIV infection efficiency. The study was done by using aphosphatidyl choline (PC) 

floppase protein that is responsible for transporting PC from the inner to the outer membrane 

layer, ABCB4 protein. By utilizing this ability of the ABCB4 protein, the authors were able to 

manipulate the lipid composition of the HIV vector and compare its infection efficiency to that 

of an unmodulated vector. The results showed that virus made in the presence of ABCB4 

showed a large increase in PC membrane composition and a reduced infectivity compared to 

the control.


'''Terms:'''

&lt;u&gt;lentiviral&lt;/u&gt; - genus of slow viruses of the Retroviridae family that have a long incubation period.

&lt;u&gt;transfection&lt;/u&gt; - introduction of foreign material into a cell through the use of a virus vector.

&lt;u&gt;Western blot&lt;/u&gt; - technique used to detect a specific protein in a tissue sample homogenate or 

extract.

&lt;u&gt;sonication&lt;/u&gt; - agitation of particles through the use of sound energy.

&lt;u&gt;chemokine&lt;/u&gt; - cytokines produced during inflammation that activate white blood cells.


'''Connection:'''

This study relates to what we have talked about in class in that it revolves completely around 

a specific membrane lipid. Since we have talked about the various lipids that make up a cell 

membrane, this study is relevant to what we have learned. We also studied the movement of 

lipids within a membrane, which is what was used to set up this experiment.


'''Peer-Reviewed Article #2:'''

'''Seminal Plasma Proteins Regulate the Association of Lipids and Proteins Within Detergent-Resistant Membrane Domains of Bovine Spermatozoa'''

'''Source:''' http://www.biolreprod.org/cgi/rapidpdf/biolreprod.107.066514v1


'''Main Focus:'''

This study focused on proteins within sperm membranes and how they direct the 

reorganization of lipid rafts during sperm capacitation (the remodeling of sperm plasma 

membrane while within female reproductive tract). Several proteins are associated with 

cholesterol-enriched detergent-resistant membranes (DRM) domains in spermatozoa. In 

capacitated sperm cells these proteins detach from these domains leading to the theory that 

these domains may be involved in the reorganization of sperm membranes when cholesterol is 

removed. The researchers isolated spermatozoa from bovine epididymis and isolated the DRM 

domains and lipids so as to find the lipid:protein ratio. They examined the effects of seminal 

plasma on the spermatozoa and found that it lowers the cholesterol concentration in DRM 

domains and dissociates proteins from DRM domains. They concluded that seminal plasma 

proteins induce lipid efflux and DRM protein dissociation.


'''Terms:'''

&lt;u&gt;efflux&lt;/u&gt; - a flowing outward.

&lt;u&gt;zona pellucida&lt;/u&gt; - thick, solid, transparent outer membrane surrounding a developing ovum.

&lt;u&gt;densitometric&lt;/u&gt; - method of measuring the optical density of a material.

&lt;u&gt;dialysis&lt;/u&gt; -  Method used to separate smaller molecules from larger molecules or of dissolved 

substances from colloidal particles in a solution by selective diffusion through a semipermeable 

membrane.

&lt;u&gt;acrosome&lt;/u&gt; - structure on a spermatozoon that produces enzymes used to penetrate an ovum.


'''Connection:'''

This study is relevant to our course in that it discusses factors that can affect plasma 

membrane fluidity, specifically cholesterol, and how proteins are integrate into the bilayer. The 

study also touches on the topic of lipid rafts, another area we went over in class.



'''Peer-Reviewed Article #3:'''


'''Erythrocyte Glutathione Depletion Impairs Resistance to Haemolysis in Women Consuming Alcohol'''

'''Source:''' 

http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&amp;pubmedid=18231625


'''Main Focus:'''

This study focused on the effect alcohol has on women erythrocyte membranes. The study 

involved taking blood samples from women who drink 200-300mL of alcoholic beverages 

every day after work and comparing it to that of women who do not consume alcohol. The 

results showed that women who consume alcohol have a decreased phospholipid 

concentration and an increased cholesterol concentration resulting in overall decreased 

membrane fluidity and a decrease in the ability of the erythrocytes to resist haemolysis. 

Peroxidative damage to membranes was also observed.


'''Terms:'''

&lt;u&gt;hemolysate&lt;/u&gt; - product from the lysis of red blood cells.

&lt;u&gt;haemolysis&lt;/u&gt; - breakdown of red blood cells.

&lt;u&gt;heparin&lt;/u&gt; - drug used to prevent blood clotting.

&lt;u&gt;Catalase&lt;/u&gt; - blood enzyme that decomposes hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen.

&lt;u&gt;Methemoglobin&lt;/u&gt; - brownish-red, crystalline form of hemoglobin occurring when hemoglobin is 

oxidized by blood decomposition or toxic agents.


'''Connection:'''

This study relates to our course work in that we discussed the effects of cholesterol 

concentration on membrane fluidity. We also talked about free radical generation and how it 

can lead to damage, something that was shown in the study to increase in women who drink.

{{C++ Programming/Syntax|
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;cstdio&gt;
int putchar( int ch );
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

The putchar() function writes ch to '''stdout'''. The code

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
putchar( ch );  
&lt;/source&gt;

is the same as

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
putc( ch, stdout );         
&lt;/source&gt;

The return value of putchar() is the written character, or '''EOF''' if there is an error.

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

== Page blanking ==

Please don't remove content from pages. If you want them deleted, just add {{tlx|delete|reason}} to the page &amp; an admin will take care of it. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:39, 9 March 2009 (UTC)</text>

== The First Cities ==
By roughly 4000 BC, the lower plain of Mesopotamia was filled with city-states much like the ones we find later in Greece and Italy.  Each city had a patron god and was ruled by a king.  The political side of their history may be summarized by saying that for a period of almost three millennia, the written records of the cities of Euphrates and Tigris valley are annals of wars waged for supremacy by one city and its gods against other cities and their gods.

== The First Empires ==
Of all the Mesopotamian city-states' kings whose names have been recorded, one stands out above the others: Sargon I, a Semitic king of ''Agade'', whose reign was a great landmark in early Babylonian history.  Reigning from 2334 BC to 2279 BC, he built up a powerful state in the area and extended his rule as far as the Mediterranean.

Yet, Sargon is as much remembered as a patron of letters as well as a warrior.  He caused to be collected and edited the literature of the period, and deposited books in great libraries which he established or enlarged - the oldest and most valuable libraries of the ancient world.

== Law and Conflict ==


== Trade and Technology ==
New tools and techniques are always used to solve problems. As far as farming, animal tamming and more. Special workers need and use tools the most so cities would improve the city and worlds technology.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Geography ==

''Mesopotamia'' is a Greek word meaning, &quot;Land between the Rivers.&quot; However, the people of this land usually divided the land between the rivers into two major regions, north and south.  The northern region, a relatively high and arid land though not desert, they called ''Akkad''.  The lower southern region, almost at sea level, was called ''Sumer''.  From time to time, records speak of an intermediate region called &quot;Babylonia&quot;, around the city of Babylon, but whether this was a geographical or a political distinction is uncertain.

The rivers in question were and are the Euphrates on the west, and on the east the Tigris.  The Euphrates has in many ways marked a significant boundary between west and east:  the nations on the western bank have commonly looked to the Mediterranean, while those on the eastern shore look to the region itself.  Peoples dwelling on the eastern shores of the Tigris tended to turn toward India and Persia.  Its headwaters are in the high country of Armenia, and the river cuts its way through the Taurus mountains of modern-day Turkey and Syria, before flowing across the plateau of Akkad, and down through the garden country of Sumer.  South and west of the river are the deserts of Arabia and Transjordan: unsuitable country in those days for farming, but good for herding flocks of sheep, goats and camels.

The Tigris has its headwaters in the same mountain range, but its course flows against the foothills of the Zagros Mountains.  Where the Euphrates marked the line between desert and fertile farmland, the Tigris marked the boundary in ancient times between civilization and wilderness.  It was a land of spirits and devils, and barbarians who washed with sand or not at all.  Not until the rise of the great Persian empire would the lands beyond the river be thought worth visiting, though traders on their way to and from the civilizations of India often passed through.

Between the rivers was a land rich with fertile soil and mud, but which had few trees and fewer resources of stone or metal.  Though the highlands received much rain, the central basin between the rivers received most of its water from the outflowing rivers.  This made irrigation projects a necessity throughout the region.  Differences in geological structure divide this region into an upper and lower district; and this twofold physical division is reflected, as we shall see, throughout its political history.

The northern part of the valley, the portion that comprised ancient Assyria, consists of undulating plains, broken in places by mountain ridges.  This region nourished a hardy and warlike people, and became the seat of a great military empire.

The southern part of the valley, the part known as ''Babylonia'' or ''Chaldea'', is, like the Delta region of Egypt, an alluvial deposit.  The making of new land by rivers has gone on steadily during historic times.  The ruins of one of the ancient seaports of the country - ''Eridu'' - lie over a hundred miles inland from the present head of the Persian Gulf.  In ancient times, the land was protected against the river floods, and watered in seasons of drought, by a stupendous system of dykes and canals, which at present, although ruined and sand-choked, cover the area.

The economic activity of the river valleys was much like that of the Nile valley in Egypt.  The luxuriant growth of grain on these river flats evoked the wonderment of Greek travelers who visited the East.  Herodotus was afraid to tell the whole truth for fear that his veracity would be doubted.  It is not strange that tradition located paradise in Mesopotamia, that primeval garden where ''&quot;out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food.&quot;'' (Genesis 2:9)  This favored plain in a remote period of antiquity became the seat of an agricultural, industrial, and commercial nation in which the arts of civilization enjoyed one their earliest periods of development.

name=Deprimo|
type=Spell (Jinx)|
features=blasts holes in things|
appearance=[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']]}}

== Overview ==

'''''Deprimo''''' is a spell which blasts holes in things.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

We see this spell in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']] when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] uses it to blast a hole in the floor of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Xenophilius Lovegood|Xenophilius Lovegood]]'s house, as she, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] make their escape from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Selwyn|Selwyn]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Travers|Travers]].

== Analysis ==

From the circumstances in which this is used, we can gather something about the spell. Hermione does not want to hurt the Death Eaters; she is trying to save Xeno from further torture at their hands, so she wants them to see that she and Harry were actually there, as Xeno had reported. She would have avoided a spell that would cause the floor to explode, which would have hurt her, Harry, and Ron, who were standing on it, as well as the Death Eaters. Similarly, a spell that would cause the floor to fall in might fall on the Death Eaters, and could also mask the presence of Harry. So the Deprimo spell almost certainly makes the floor vanish, and any explosion-like effects are caused by the remainder of the house as its already weakened structure is further damaged by the removal of a chunk of floor.

The effect is likely similar to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Reducto|Reductor spell]], which seems to be intended to turn objects to dust, rather than the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Confringo|Confringo]] or [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expulso|Expulso]] spells.

name=Foe Glass|
type=Magical device|
features=Shows enemies approaching|
appearance=[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']]}}

== Overview ==

A '''''Foe-Glass''''' is an object somewhat like a mirror which reveals approaching enemies. The closer said enemies are, the more focused their images are.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

The first time we see a Foe Glass, it is mounted on the wall of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Professor Moody]]'s office. While there is constant motion within the glass when Harry first sees it, everything he sees is indistinct, indicating that there are no enemies nearby.

Once Moody has revealed himself, Harry notices that there are three images in the glass that are steadily becoming more distinct; shortly before the door is broken down, he recognizes the images as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]]. The image of the three stays in the mirror while Moody is questioned.

We see a Foe Glass, quite possibly the same one, mounted on the wall of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Room of Requirement|Room of Requirement]] when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Dumbledore's Army|Dumbledore's Army]] meets there in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']].

appearance=[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of  Secrets|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']]}}

== Overview ==

The '''''Hand of Glory''''', a desiccated, severed human hand, is a candle holder; the person holding it is able to see in complete darkness by its candlelight, but to anyone else, the light is invisible.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

First seen at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Borgin and Burkes|Borgin &amp; Burkes]], a shop in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Knockturn Alley|Knockturn Alley]] dealing in Dark objects. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]], using [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Floo Powder|Floo Powder]] for the first time, accidentally lands in Borgin &amp; Burke's. As he prepares to exit, he sees [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]] and his father, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]], entering the shop. Harry hides and overhears Borgin explaining the Hand of Glory and its function. It is, he says, a thief or plunderer's best friend; Lucius replies that he hopes Draco will be better than a thief or a plunderer...though unless his grades improve, that may be the best he can hope for.

Draco evidently does purchase a Hand of Glory, because [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]] sees him carrying it as he guides the Hogwarts invaders from the Room of Requirement; the hand apparently allows him to see where he is leading the Death Eaters despite the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder|Darkness Powder]] he tosses after spotting the D.A. members.

      <comment>/* General Capitalization Rules */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==General Capitalization Rules==

These rules are adapted from ''The Chicago Manual of Style'' for clarity in the modern age of computers and the Internet.

1. The first and last words are always capitalized, even if fewer than five letters.

2. Words over five letters are always capitalized.

3. Verbs are always capitalized, even if fewer than five letters.

4. Nouns are always capitalized, even if fewer than five letters.

5. Unless the first or last words of a title, these are never capitalized:
	articles: ''a, an, the'';
	conjunctions: ''and, but, or, nor'';
	prepositions that are fewer than five letters long: ''at, by, for, from, in, into, of, off, on, onto, out, over (unless used as a verb), up, with'';
	infinitives: ''to'';
	&quot;''as''&quot; is never capitalized;
	o'Clock (since it means &quot;of the clock&quot;)

6. These words are capitalized, even though they are fewer than five letters.
	''also, be, if, than, that, thus, when''

7. Parenthesis and alternate titles: Some songs, and less commonly books and movies, will have parenthesis in their names. If the content of the parenthesis is an alternative song title then the above rules for capitalization apply. Consider the Simon &amp; Garfunkel song &quot;A Simple Desultory Philippic (or How I Was Robert McNamara'd into Submission)&quot;. The word &quot;or&quot; is not capitalized, even though it is the first word inside the parenthesis, because it is not part of the alternate  title. The word &quot;or&quot; is not needed when the content of the parenthesis is clearly an alternate title. When the content of the parenthesis is also part of the title, the above six rules apply. An example is Buzzcocks' song &quot;Ever Fallen in Love (with Someone You Shouldn’t Have)?&quot;

The word &quot;or&quot; is not needed when the content of the parenthesis is clearly an alternate title.

In the movie ''Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb'', which is sometimes referred to simply as ''Dr. Strangelove'', there is a colon (:) after the &quot;or&quot;. The colon is completely optional and may be included or excluded from the title by the author.


Exceptions: When prepositions are use as &quot;phrasal verbs&quot; they are capitalized to show that they are part of the verb, and not showing physical relations between nouns. Examples are ''Turn On'' or ''Turn Off'' or ''Give Up''. Note that the word &quot;up&quot; is more often used as part of a verb than as a physical preposition. Likewise, a song called &quot;Blow Up&quot; would have a similar meaning to exploding, and not blowing in an upwards direction.

==Related rules==

The names of books, movies, and music albums are ''italicized''.

The names of songs are in &quot;quotation marks&quot;.

Links and hyperlinks for the Internet are &lt;u&gt;underlined&lt;/u&gt;.

==Interpretations==
There is some debate between authors of style manuals of some of these rules, mostly on italicizing versus underlining. When writing with a pen and paper, it is extremely difficult to clearly italicize text so the reader knows the author is referring to titles. Thus, writers will  normally underline words instead of italicize them. With the invention of computers and text editors, italicizing and underlining has become simple. However, with the popularity of the Internet, underlining has become reserved for links. 

The purpose of italicizing or underlining is to clearly show the reader of text that certain words belong to titles. If a writer is writing with pen and paper they may choose to underline instead of italicize. The most important issue is to not switch between styles; all titles of books, movies, and albums should be either italicized or underlined.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Khepera III Toolbox offers mainly three types of tools:
* '''[[/Scripts|Scripts]]''': Scripts make your daily work with the robot(s) more efficient by offering easy ways to copy files (e.g. programs) onto multiple robots, logging in to robots, and so on.
* '''[[/Programs|Programs]]''': The ''Programs'' folder contains a series of useful standard programs for the Khepera III robot. Among them are programs to sample the sensors, set the motor speed, and track the robot's position with odometry measurements. In addition, these programs may serve as starting points for your own programs.
* '''[[/Modules|Modules]]''': This folder contains modules to conveniently access the sensors and actuators on the robots (''Modules/khepera3'') and a series of other functions. These modules are used by the available programs and can be used in your own programs as well.

In addition, there is a fourth folder which is less frequently used:
* '''[[/Install Scripts|Install Scripts]]''': This folder contains a few scripts to set up WLAN and a few other things on the robot.

== Bézier Curves in 3d ==
In the previous page, we learned how to create and basically manipulate Bézier curves in two dimensions, as well as extruding them into the third.
Here we will be exploring the '3D' button you may have been wondering about in the 'Curve and Surface' menu and some of its implications.
[[Image:Curve_and_Surface_Box.png|right]]

#'''Create a basic curve''': Press 'SPACE - Add - Curve - Bezier' in case you have forgotten.

If you have been playing around with the control points on any curves so far, you will have noticed that they cannot be moved outside the flat plane made up by the X and Y axes. This is because it hasn't been enabled yet, so go ahead and enable it...

#'''Enabling 3D editing''': Locate and press the button labelled '3D' in the 'Curve and Surface' menu.


Your curve should now look like this in Edit Mode:

[[Image:New_Bezier_Curve_3D.png]]


Our previously simple curve has now been covered with arrows! These indicate the direction of the curve, and also the normal size and tilt. But more of that later...

== Getting started in 3D ==

Editing the curve should now be child's play, assuming you have already completed the tutorials on 3d meshes.

#'''Rotate the camera view''': Use the '''MMB''' or some Numpad keys to rotate the view so you can see the 3d axes.
#'''Move a point''': Select one of the control points (NB: A point, not a handle) and move it with '''GKEY'''. You may want to constrain its motion to the new Z axis using '''ZKEY''' twice.


If you rotate around the curve, you can see how the interpolation works in three dimensions, and that the arrows still follow its direction correctly. It is worth noting that they are all mostly vertically (for the moment at least), this will be discussed in the next section.

== Extruding revisited ==

I'm sure you will be delighted to learn that we can still use the Extrude option on 3d curves! Try cranking up the value, and you will see a surface created through your curve, at right angles to the 'normal' arrows.

The Bevel settings will also work as before, but you probably don't need to use them unless you are editing a 'filled' curve ('''CKEY''').

Also, The Subdivided option(W, 1) still applies while working with curves. Just select two(or more) handles of the curve that are right next to each other, and subdivide. You should have a newly created handle(s) in between the handles you selected to subdivide.   

=== Bevel Objects ===

(Information on bevel objects to come...)

== Curve Tilting and Normal-scaling ==

Use '''TKEY''' to tilt the curve, clockwise or counterclockwise (looking along the line of the curve). For Blender version: 2.6x use '''Ctrl+T''' to tilt. Use '''Alt-SKEY''' to scale the curve, making it wider or narrower.

== Convert Curve to Mesh ==

Use '''Alt+C''' ''[ObjectMode&gt;Menu&gt;Object&gt;Convert to&gt;Mesh from...]''.&lt;br /&gt;
Shape '''typ 2D''' = mesh with auto add faces and edges 
Shape '''typ 3D''' = mesh only edges and vertex

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Khepera III robot comes with a library called ''libkorebot'' to access the sensors and actuators of the Khepera III robot. In addition, a program called ''khepera3_test'' can be used to read sensor values on the command line. The ''Khepera III Toolbox'' is more or less a clean rewrite of these two pieces of software. Note, however, that the ''libkorebot'' library is compatible with several robots produced by K-Team, whereas the ''Khepera III Toolbox'' - as its name suggests - is made for the Khepera III robot only.

In this chapter, we motivate why the Khepera III Toolbox should be used instead of the ''libkorebot'' library.

== A Nicer, Simpler and Safer API ==

The Khepera III Toolbox provides an easy-to-use API to access the sensors and actuators of the robot. Values read from sensors are parsed and put inside a data structure for easy access.  To read the floor sensor, for example, the following code can be used:
 int floor_sum;
 khepera3_infrared_proximity();
 floor_sum = khepera3.infrared_proximity.sensor[cKhepera3SensorsInfrared_FloorLeft] + khepera3.infrared_proximity.sensor[cKhepera3SensorsInfrared_FloorRight];
Note that re-entrant versions for programs with multiple threads exist as well, and are just slightly more complicated to use.

The ''libkorebot'' library only reads messages and provides the programmer with a buffer, which he has to parse by himself. This is very error-prone and makes the resulting code hard to read. The following piece of code is equivalent to the code above:
 char buffer[MAXBUFFERSIZE];
 int floor_left, floor_right, floor_sum;
 kh3_proximity_ir(buffer, dsPic);
 floor_left = buffer[15] | buffer[16] &lt;&lt; 8;
 floor_right = buffer[17] | buffer[18] &lt;&lt; 8;
 floor_sum = floor_left + floor_right;

== Synchronization Issues when Running Multiple Programs at the Same Time ==

The ''libkorebot'' was written with the idea in mind that only a single program would run on the robot at the same time. The code used to access the sensor values is therefore '''not safe''' when two or more programs are running at the same time. E.g., if a program is reading infrared proximity values, and another program ambient infrared values, the programs may occasionally get the wrong type of measurements for their request.

There is not technical reason why running multiple programs at the same time should cause problems, especially when they are working with a different subset of sensors and actuators.

The Khepera III Toolbox communicates with the sensors and actuators in an atomic fashion, and therefore enables running programs side by side.

== Additional Modules ==

Besides the ''khepera3'' module, the Khepera III Toolbox offers a series of other useful modules to write programs for the robot. Among them are a module to parse command line arguments, a module to send messages over the I2C bus, and a module to track the robot position using wheel odometry.

== Programs ==

While the ''khepera3_test'' program provided by K-Team is one monolithic program intended for testing, the Khepera III Toolbox provides a series of small programs that can be used for testing and serious experiments.

== Speed ==

Both the ''libkorebot'' and the Khepera III Toolbox have comparable speed. The time required to read sensor values or send motor commands mostly depends on the speed of the I2C bus and the length of the messages. The processing overhead is negligibly small.

== Scripts ==

There is no equivalent to the Khepera III Toolbox scripts in the code provided by K-Team.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You wish to associate a form with a set of items.  Once an item is referenced it should not be referenced again.

For example if you have a form that edits tasks you may want to associate a specific task with one or more projects.  Once a project is associated with a task you want to remove it from the candidate list of projects it can be associated with.

The way to visualize this is to imagine a set divided into two distinct subsets: selected and un-selected items.  As an item moves from the un-selected item set to the selected item set it must first be added to the new set and then deleted from the old set.

== Method ==
This example uses a combination of the repeat and the switch/case.  The currently referenced items are listed in a repeat loop.  A button called &quot;Add Reference&quot; uses the toggle function to reveal a list of unselected items.  As you select an item it is added to the selected list.

== Sample Program ==

         &lt;/xf:group&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Discussion ==
The unreferenced items are not displayed unless the user selects the &quot;Add Reference&quot; trigger.  When the user selects the Add Reference trigger the list of currently unreferenced items is displayed.

When the user selects the trigger of an unreferenced item a new item is added to the end of the referenced items list and removed from the unreferenced items list.

This pattern can be used in many examples.  For example when you create a custom report you are presented with a list of columns to display.  These columns are either referenced in the display list or not referenced.

The user interface sometimes shows these lists side-by-side.  This can be accomplished by adding a class to each of the groups and using CSS to display the lists side-by-side.

The one problem with this example is the inability to place the items in the correct order after they are moved to a new list.  Hopefully a future version of XForms will support this.

== Overview ==

A '''''Blood Blisterpod''''' is a purple pod which either causes uncontrollable bleeding, or if bleeding already is occurring, prevents it from stopping.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] passes the Quaffle so enthusiastically to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Katie Bell|Katie Bell]] at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch|Quidditch]] practice, that it hits her in the nose and starts a nose bleed. To stop the bleeding, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred Weasley|Fred]] gives her what he believes is the healing end of a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Skiving Snackbox|Nosebleed Nougat]], but it turns out to be a Blood Blisterpod. Katie loses so much blood that she has to be taken to the Hospital Wing.

== Analysis ==

The fact that Fred is carrying a pocket full of Blood Blisterpods would indicate that they are a vital component of some part of the Skiving Snackbox line, most likely the Nosebleed Nougat. Knowing the twins, they are also quite possibly untradeable magical substances under the law, which would explain why we only see them that once.

features=Detects presence of humans|

== Overview ==

'''''Homenum Revelio''''' is a spell which will reveal to the caster whether any other (presumably living) humans are within its area of influence.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

When they first arrive at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Number 12, Grimmauld Place]] after leaving [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bill Weasley|Bill]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fleur Delacour|Fleur]]'s wedding, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] are concerned that there may be Death Eaters lurking. Hermione casts Homenum Revelio to determine that the house is, in fact, empty.

When Harry, Ron, and Hermione are betrayed by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Xenophilius Lovegood|Xeno Lovegood]], the two Death Eaters, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Selwyn|Selwyn]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Travers|Travers]] at first do not believe Xeno's protestations that he actually has Harry Potter. Selwyn determines that there is, in fact, someone else there by using this charm.

In both cases, the person casting the spell reports to the others there present what has been discovered, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione are only aware of the spell because they hear it being cast.

== Analysis ==

The fact that Hermione reported nobody present at Grimmauld Place, and that Selwyn had to tell Travers that there was someone &quot;up there,&quot; leads us to believe that the response to the spell is local to only the caster; other than the person casting the spell, nobody is aware of the results of the spell.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Internet Information Services 6.0 (herein IIS6) is Microsoft's web-server application, it runs only on Microsoft Windows 2003. FastCGI permits properly designed scripts to execute without the the overhead of starting up the interpreter on each HTTP request. This wikibook functions to teach the user how to configure IIS6 with FastCGI.

IIS does some non-http serving stuff as well, it bundles in FTP, and SMTP server applications (which can be uninstalled or disabled) and it largely relies on Windows or WINS servers for authentication. As an alternative to IIS-as-a-webserver on Windows, one can migrate away from IIS, and [http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/platform/windows.html install Apache 2.x]; or, the newer Lighttpd 1.4x or greater.

== Overview ==

'''''Incarcerous''''' causes ropes to appear out of the end of the caster's wand, which then bind and (usually) gag the subject of the spell.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

When we first see this spell, it is being used by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]] to bind [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Remus Lupin]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Shrieking Shack|The Shrieking Shack]]. It is used a number of times after that, notably by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Professor Umbridge]], to bind the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Centaur|Centaur]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Magorian|Magorian]], an action that triggers a mass attack on her by the remainder of the herd.

== Analysis ==

'''Branch of Magic''': ''Incarcerous'' is difficult to categorize into one branch of magic due to its dual function. Most prominently, it is a transfiguration spell—conjuring to be specific. It also could be considered a charm as it is giving the ropes the ability to attack a specified target and bind to it without further magic being performed.

'''The Rope's Physical Properties''': It would appear that the attributes of the conjured rope varies and most likely is the choice of the caster. In ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'', when Severus Snape nonverbally casts the spell, &quot;thin, cordlike&quot; ropes bind Sirius Black and Remus Lupin. In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 33|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], when Dolores Umbridge uses the spell, this time verbally, once more cords are produced—with no detail as to their thickness. The final time we see the spell cast in the series is in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 9|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']]. A [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eater]] casts this spell on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], leaving him bound tightly in thick ropes.

One possible explanation of the discrepancies in rope size is that the size could have a great deal to do with the level of power that the caster has. It is inferred throughout the final books that Umbridge was relatively weak, magically, and therefore her ''Incarcerous'', while effective, did not produce ropes as thick as the Death Eater's. On the other hand, it is reasonably obvious that Snape is among the most powerful wizards in the story. Yet, his version of the spell, non-verbal though it may be, produces only thin cords, though these cords are quite adequate to bind both Sirius and Lupin. Quite possibly, for the relatively unsophisticated Death Eaters, bigger ropes are obviously better, while perhaps the cords that Umbridge produces are the best she can manage. Meanwhile, Snape produces just enough strength to do the job, perhaps knowing that binding with smaller cords will also hurt more if one struggles against them. 

We have noted in other spells that there is a definite mental component: [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Portus|when creating a Portkey]], for instance, one must visualize the type and destination(s) of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Portkey|Portkey]] one is creating, while the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Riddikulus|Riddikulus]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expecto Patronum|Patronus]] charms have the mental component explained in detail when they are first introduced. It is safe to assume that the type of binding produced, and how those bonds are to be tied, must be visualized when casting the spell.

'''Etymology''': ''Incarcerous'' comes from the Latin word &quot;carcerate&quot; meaning prison or cage. Since the incantation causes ropes to be expelled from the casters wand and bound tightly around the intended target, this makes sense since it is detaining the victim, much like a prison or cage.

== Configuring FCGI.ini ==

To register an extension globally:
&lt;source lang=&quot;dos&quot;&gt;
## php
cscript fcgiconfig.js -add -section:&quot;PHP&quot; -extension:php -path:&quot;C:\PHP\php-cgi.exe&quot;

## perl
cscript fcgiconfig.js -add -section:&quot;Perl&quot; -extension:pl -path:&quot;C:\strawberry\perl\bin\perl.exe&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

To register a site-specific extension simply add the &lt;code&gt;-site=&lt;sitenum&gt;&lt;/code&gt; flag. (No angle brackets)
&lt;source lang=&quot;dos&quot;&gt;
cscript fcgiconfig.js -add -section:&quot;PHP&quot; -extension:php -path:&quot;C:\PHP\php-cgi.exe&quot; –site:1
&lt;/source&gt;

On success you should see:
&lt;source lang=&quot;dos&quot;&gt;
Microsoft (R) Windows Script Host Version 5.6
Copyright (C) Microsoft Corporation 1996-2001. All rights reserved.

INI successfully written.
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Finishing fcgiext.ini ===

Documented is located by default in: &lt;tt&gt;C:\WINDOWS\system32\inetsrv\fcgiext.ini&lt;/tt&gt;

The FastCGI document is formatted with a &lt;tt&gt;Types&lt;/tt&gt; section that maps the FastCGI application onto the IIS site (vhost) using the specific IIS ids. And, a section that describes the application:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ini&quot;&gt;
[Types]
;619896678 is my example IIS site id
*:619896678=Catalyst

[Catalyst]
ExePath=C:\strawberry\perl\bin\perl.exe
Arguments=&quot;D:\Inetpub\www\DMApp\script\dmapp_fastcgi.pl&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Registering FCGI with IIS ==
To add the FastCGI to a site follow these steps:
Start &amp;rarr; Administrative Tools &amp;rarr; Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager &amp;rarr; Right Mouse click on ''Web Sites'' folder Properties &amp;rarr; Home Directory &amp;rarr; Configuration &amp;rarr; Select extension you installed &amp;rarr; Edit &amp;rarr; you should see &lt;tt&gt;C:\WINDOWS\system32\inetsrv\fcgiext.dll&lt;/tt&gt; or the like in the executable field. Uncheck verify file exists.

== Troubleshooting ==

'''ScriptMap already exists'''
*Example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;dos&quot;&gt;
C:\WINDOWS\system32\inetsrv\fcgiconfig.js(1223, 5) (null): ScriptMap already exi
sts, path=IIS://localhost/W3SVC, scriptmap=.pl,C:\Perl\bin\perl.exe &quot;%s&quot; %s,5,GE
T,HEAD,POST

&lt;/source&gt;
*Cause: Often old [http://www.activestate.com/ Active State] CGI garbage
*Solution: Start &amp;rarr; Administrative Tools &amp;rarr; Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager &amp;rarr; Right Mouse click on ''Web Sites'' folder Properties &amp;rarr; Home Directory &amp;rarr; Configuration &amp;rarr; Delete all conflicting extensions i.e. .pl, .plex, .plx, .php, .rb etc. &amp;rarr; OK / Confirm

== Overview ==

The '''''Langlock''''' spell is one that prevents someone from speaking about something specific by binding their tongue to the roof of their mouth.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] finds this spell in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Potions|Potions]] text that belonged to the Half-Blood Prince. He uses it at one point in the story to silence [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peeves|Peeves]], who is loudly commentating a fight between [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dobby|Dobby]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Kreacher|Kreacher]]. We also guess that this is the spell left in the entrance to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Number 12, Grimmauld Place]] by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Mad-Eye Moody]] as part of the attempt to prevent [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Snape]]'s entrance.

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] uses this spell to move a Christmas tree in The Three Broomsticks, to better hide [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] from a number of teachers who have just walked in.

      <comment>/* Using Mnesia */  Fixed spelling, querly -&gt; query</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Using Mnesia==

Mnesia is the distributed database written in Erlang, meant to mainly be used by Erlang programs. Simple queries can be written with query list comprehensions (qlc). Realtime queries can decide to not use transactions. 

=== Explain program: art.erl ===

The program defines some functions that work similar to SQL.  We wish to build a table of artwork named &quot;painting&quot;, with fields: index, artist, and title.

 Table: painting
  
 +---------------------------------------------+ 
 | index | artist  | title                     |
 +---------------------------------------------+  
 | 1     | Dali    | The Ghost of Vermeer      |
 | 2     | Dali    | The Persistance of Memory |
 | 3     | Vermeer | Girl With Pearl Earring   |
 +---------------------------------------------+

art:init().  Starts the database and creates the table: painting. &lt;br&gt;
insert()     Puts data into the table &lt;br&gt;
select()     Gets data out of the table &lt;br&gt;

Note that the second time we call init() the database is restarted but we get an error when it tries to recreate the table (as it already exists).

=== Example program: art.erl ===

 -module(art).
 -compile(export_all).
 -include_lib(&quot;stdlib/include/qlc.hrl&quot;). 
  
 -record(painting, {index, artist, title}).
   
 init() -&gt;
     mnesia:create_schema([node()]),
     mnesia:start(),
     mnesia:create_table(painting,
         [ {disc_copies, [node()] },
              {attributes,      
                 record_info(fields,painting)} ]).
  
 insert( Index, Artist, Title) -&gt;
     Fun = fun() -&gt;
          mnesia:write(
          #painting{ index=Index,
                    artist=Artist, 
                         title=Title    } )
                end,
          mnesia:transaction(Fun).
   
 select( Index) -&gt;
     Fun = 
         fun() -&gt;
             mnesia:read({painting, Index})
         end,
     {atomic, [Row]}=mnesia:transaction(Fun),
     io:format(&quot; ~p ~p ~n &quot;, [Row#painting.artist, Row#painting.title] ).
 
 select_some( Artist) -&gt;
     Fun = 
         fun() -&gt;
             mnesia:match_object({painting, '_', Artist, '_' } )
         end,
     {atomic, Results} = mnesia:transaction( Fun),
     Results.
  
 select_all() -&gt; 
     mnesia:transaction( 
     fun() -&gt;
         qlc:eval( qlc:q(
             [ X || X &lt;- mnesia:table(painting) ] 
         )) 
     end ).
   
 select_search( Word ) -&gt; 
     mnesia:transaction( 
     fun() -&gt;
          qlc:eval( qlc:q(
               [ {F0,F1,F2,F3} || 
                    {F0,F1,F2,F3} &lt;- 
                         mnesia:table(painting),
                         (string:str(F2, Word)&gt;0) or  
                         (string:str(F3, Word)&gt;0)
                ] )) 
     end ).

===Sample output: art.erl===

== Overview ==

'''''Oppugno''''' apparently causes creatures to hate the target of the spell. The result is that the creatures influenced by the spell will attack its subject.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

We only see this spell used once. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], having seen [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lavender Brown|Lavender]] locked in one of their embraces, has retreated to a disused classroom, where she has moodily [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Avis|created a flock of canaries]] which are circling her. Ron and Lavender, apparently seeking some privacy, also enter the classroom; Lavender quickly backs out, but Ron stays to exchange some words with Hermione. Hermione, angered, uses the spell to set the canaries on Ron as she is leaving.

There is mention later that Ron still bears the scars of the canary beaks and talons.

== Analysis ==

It is uncertain whether this spell would work on any creature, or only on creatures that the caster has created. As we see this spell only the one time, we can only guess at its effects and applicability.

== Overview ==

'''''Pepper-Up Potion''''' is a restorative potion. It seems to have the side effect of making steam come out the drinker's ears.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

We first see this potion used after the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Second Task|Second Task]] of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Triwizard Tournament|Triwizard Tournament]]. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Poppy Pomfrey|Madam Pomfrey]] is administering this potion to all of the Champions and their &quot;treasures&quot; (hostages to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Merpeople|Merpeople]]) as they emerge from the lake. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] does indicate that he feels much warmer once the potion has been administered.

There is a Wizard candy, Pepper Imps, that apparently also makes steam come out the ears; likely it is based on this potion.

While riding sometimes bolts and screws get rattled loose. Therefor it is always important that they are checked regularly to prevent accidents. 

*Check the stem to see if the bolts are tightened accordingly to the correct torque (if you don't know this amount, then check with your local bike supplier, or stem manufacturer). Make sure that the bolts also are evenly tightend.
*Check that the grips are secured and will not slip off. If you have got lock-on grips, the tighten the bolts on these if they are loose. 
*Check your brake levers and gear-shifters. These should be tight enough so they don't move around, but not to tight so they don't get snapped off if the bike is involved in a crash.

== Overview ==

'''''Probity Probes''''' are long, silvery probes that allow the bearer to detect concealment and deception: for instance, a Probity Probe would detect use of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Polyjuice Potion|Polyjuice Potion]] to disguise oneself, and presumably would detect someone under an [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloak]].

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

We first hear of Probity Probes when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] is preparing for his sixth year at Hogwarts. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bill Weasley|Bill]], who works at Gringotts, hands Harry a money bag, saying that he's gotten some cash for Harry; everyone going into Gringotts now has to pass people with Probity Probes, and entrance to the bank can take several hours.

When Harry, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Griphook|Griphook]] enter Gringotts in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 26|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']] to open [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix]]' vault, there are two wizards with Probity Probes by the door. Harry, from under his Invisibility Cloak, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Confundo|Confunds]] them so they will not scan Hermione, who is in disguise.

== Analysis ==

The principles behind a Probity Probe, a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Secrecy Sensor|Secrecy Sensor]], and the part of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Marauder's Map|Marauder's Map]] that determines the name of an individual, must be related, however their operation is clearly somewhat different. Secrecy Sensors, as described in the related article, are designed to detect curses, jinxes, and concealment charms, while Probity Probes are apparently designed to detect concealment and deception, but do not, presumably, trigger on jinxes and curses. The Marauders' Map, on the other hand, created by a group of very powerful, young wizards, likely identifies people correctly more or less by accident; the Marauders, wanting the map to be able to display the location of wandering prefects and professors, likely simply embedded an identification charm in the map, not realizing until after they had done so that the charm they had used, possibly stolen from the Restricted section of the library, was powerful enough to pierce [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloaks]] and the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Animagus|Animagus transform]].

The name of this artifact is apparently the author playing with words. &quot;Probity probes&quot; sounds somewhat infantile as a name, unless you realize that &quot;probity&quot; is a somewhat archaic word meaning &quot;the quality of having strong moral principles; honesty and decency.&quot; As such, a Probity Probe would presumably measure your honesty, moral principles and decency being somewhat harder to quantify.

Like Secrecy Sensors, it is important to the realism of the Wizarding world that probity probes have limitations; rather than checking for any sort of threat, they are limited in what they can detect. Unfortunately, what they can detect is exactly what the Trio must use to get into Gringotts. It is almost to be expected that something like this would be used at Gringotts, as the Wizarding world becomes less secure. It is necessary, though, that the Trio pass them without raising suspicion. Harry chooses to attack the human behind the probe, as being the most obvious weak point of the security system. It is perhaps of interest that many current computer virus infections actually depend on &quot;social engineering,&quot; convincing the human operator of the computer system to bypass its protective mechanisms; this is similar to what Harry is doing, though in the Muggle world, the Confundus charm is surprisingly often not needed.

==Literals==
It is normally best to define data values in a query using parameters, using the syntax &lt;code&gt;:parameter&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt;.
JPQL also allows for data values to be in-lined in the JPQL query using literals.

JPQL defines the following syntax for literals:
* &lt;code&gt;String - 'string' - &quot;Select e from  Employee e where e.name = 'Bob'&quot;&lt;/code&gt;
** To define a &lt;b&gt;'&lt;/b&gt; (quote) character in a string, the quote is double quoted, i.e. &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;'Baie-D''Urfé'&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.
* &lt;code&gt;Integer - digits - &quot;Select e from  Employee e where e.id = 1234&quot;&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;Long - +|-digitsL - &quot;Select e from  Employee e where e.id = 1234L&quot;&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;Float - +|-digits.decimaleexponentF - &quot;Select s from  Stat s where s.ratio &gt; 3.14F&quot;&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;Double - +|-digits.decimaleexponentD - &quot;Select s from  Stat s where s.ratio &gt; 3.14e32D&quot;&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;Boolean - TRUE | FALSE - &quot;Select e from  Employee e where e.active = TRUE&quot;&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;Date - {d'yyyy-mm-dd'} - &quot;Select e from  Employee e where e.startDate = {d'2012-01-03'}&quot;&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;Time - {t'hh:mm:ss'} - &quot;Select e from  Employee e where e.startTime = {t'09:00:00'}&quot;&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;Timestamp - {ts'yyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss.nnnnnnnnn'} - &quot;Select e from  Employee e where e.version = {ts'2012-01-03 09:00:00.000000001'}&quot;&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;Enum - package.class.enum - &quot;Select e from  Employee e where e.gender = org.acme.Gender.MALE&quot;&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;null - NULL - &quot;Update Employee e set e.manager = NULL where e.manager = :manager&quot;&lt;/code&gt;

The kernel provides simple process-management services, module access, and garbage collection.

The Stdlib includes a large number of commonly used utility functions. Packages included in STDLIB include utilities for math, regexp, printing, various data structures (array, dictionary, tree) and process management (slave, supervisor).  A list of functions available in each module can be listed with

      <text xml:space="preserve">&quot;Unless the first or last words of a title. these are never capitalized: articles: a, an, the conjuctions: and, but, or, not prepositions that are fewer than five letters long: at, by, for, from, in, into, of, off, on, onto, out, over (unless used as a verb), up, with infinitives: to &quot;as&quot; is never capitalized o'Clock (since it means &quot;of the clock&quot;)&quot;

clarify?  --[[User:Remi|Remi]] ([[User talk:Remi|talk]]) 20:01, 25 February 2008 (UTC)

== Prepositions as &quot;phrasal verbs&quot; ==

''Turn On'' or ''Turn Off'' or ''Give Up'' - I believe the words ''on, off'' and ''up'' aren't prepositions here at all, but rather adverbs.  Like in ''&quot;The light is on&quot;'' or ''&quot;The light is off&quot;''.  See also http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrasal_verbs

Adverbs are always capitalized, so these aren't examples of exceptions.  (It doesn't actually state explicitly how to deal with adverbs here, but they are normally always capitalized, and the meaning here seems to be that they should be.)

Likewise, &quot;Blow Up&quot; might not have the meaning of blowing in an upwards direction, but if it did - like in &quot;Flying Up to the Sky&quot; for instance - it wouldn't be a preposition anyway, but an adverb, so it would be capitalized anyway.  (&quot;He's up the Creek&quot; on the other hand would be an example of using ''up'' as a preposition.)

&quot;Talk to her&quot; would be an example of an actual preposition ''(to)'' used in a phrasal verb.  So according to the rule stated here, this should be capitalized as &quot;Talk To Her&quot;.  I wonder if that's the meaning; it seems very non-standard to capitalize ''to'' in this case.

== Current Rules Don't Cover Certain Words with 5 Letters ==

The current rules cover certain words with more or less letters than 5, but is silent on rules that apply to such words if they have 5 letters. If you want consistency with several other major capitalization guides, change references to &quot;more than 5 letters&quot; to &quot;5 or more letters&quot;.</text>

name=Prophecy|
type=Magical artifact or occurrence|
features=Prediction of the future|

== Overview ==

A '''''Prophecy''''' is a valid prediction of the future, as opposed to the &quot;fortune-telling&quot; of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Divination|Divination]].

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

The term Prophecy refers to two different objects in the series. The first and what Muggles most likely expect is the actual utterance, describing things yet to pass. The second is the glass sphere which contains a record, a memory of that prophecy, so that it may be acted upon or its validity checked at a later time.

While [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Divination|Divination]], as a means of predicting the future, tries to achieve the same validity as Prophecy, its methods remain laughable to those analyzing them. However, the one person in the series who is capable of Prophecy is the Divination teacher, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sybill Trelawney|Professor Trelawney]]. The mysticism inherent in Divination may make the mind more open to Prophecy, but it is equally possible that a family history of Prophecy impels one towards a career in the organized fakery called Divination.

During the story, we see only two Prophecies in full, both uttered by Professor Trelawney. The first concerns [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peter Pettigrew|Peter Pettigrew's]] escape, and his return to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|&quot;the Dark Lord&quot;]], and it is couched in terms that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] is unable to understand until after the named events have occurred. From our perspective, the prophecy's ambiguous term, &quot;his greatest servant&quot;, refers to Pettigrew. To the story's characters, however, Voldemort's greatest servant had, early on, seemed to be [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]].

The second prophecy was actually made prior to Harry's birth, and concerns Harry and his interaction with Voldemort. We hear this prophecy in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore's]] memories, in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 37|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']]. However, we learn about its existence much earlier, and it is what drives much of the book's action, as Voldemort seems to be blindly reacting to it.

The [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle at the Department of Mysteries|Battle in the Ministry]] that forms the climax to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']] occurs in the Hall of Prophecies, where copies of all known prophecies are stored in literally hundreds of thousands of small glass spheres, each containing, presumably, a labeled and cataloged prophecy. The battle does result in probably hundreds of these spheres being broken, and fragments of at least two other prophecies can be heard, but amidst the battle, we are unable verify what we are hearing.

== Analysis ==

A clear distinction must be drawn between Divination, which is taught as an academic subject but which is clearly little better than Muggle fortune-telling, involving the same artifacts and equipment, and Prophecy, which has a basis in reality but is apparently innate and unteachable.

Prophecies, stored in crystal spheres, are kept in the Department of Mysteries, in a store-room associated with the areas used for the study of the mystery of Time. As the areas involved with the study of the Mysteries are interconnected in the same way that the Mysteries are, it is unsurprising that there is also apparently some interconnection between the Prophecy warehouse and the areas devoted to the mysteries of Consciousness and Death.

Prophecy itself seems to be surprisingly common; in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle at the Department of Mysteries|Battle at the Department of Mysteries]] at the end of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], it appears that there are many shelves full of recorded prophecies. The prophecy regarding Harry and Voldemort is in row 97 of the prophecy warehouse, and the rows are evidently quite long, and the prophecies small. We can conservatively estimate that there are 200 prophecies on a set of shelves 6 feet (2 metres) high by 3 feet (1 metre) wide. If a row is 60 feet (20 metres) long, each row holds 4,000 prophecies, and with 97 rows there must be approximately 400,000 prophecies in storage. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ollivander|Ollivander's]] wand shop has been in business since 382 BC, which argues a Wizarding presence in England since at least that time; let us assume that prophecies have been accumulating since then, a total of roughly 2,500 years, or about 160 prophecies a year. If we guess that 1% of the Wizarding population is gifted with the true ability, that would mean somewhere between 30 and 100 prophets are in business at any given time, based on our calculations as to the number of wizards in England &amp;ndash; see the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry#School population|article on Hogwarts]] for the determination of Wizarding population. This would mean that the average prophet or prophetess would be turning out between two and six prophecies every year. The one prophetess we see, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sybill Trelawney|Professor Trelawney]], with two valid prophecies in seventeen years, does significantly worse than average.

[http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/faq_view.cfm?id=23 The author has stated, in an entry on her web site], that she and Sybill had been extremely careful in the wording of the prophecy. The prophecy that drives the entire series is precisely this: ''The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches... born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies... and the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal, but he will have power the Dark Lord knows not... and either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives... the one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord will be born as the seventh month dies...'' [http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/faq_view.cfm?id=84 The author notes] that it is ambiguous, in that it can refer to either Harry or Neville Longbottom, and in particular that, like the prophecy in Macbeth, if the prophecy had not been made, much of the story would not have happened.

      <comment>/* Basic assumptions of the learning perspective */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Background to the learning perspective ==

'''Definition of learning:''' Learning in psychology is defined as change in behavior due to environmental influences. 

The learning perspective has its background in the USA in the 1910's. It was born out of an optimistic approach to psychology, believing that if most behavior is learnt, then most behavior can also be changed, as opposed to for example biologists. The anti-German feelings of the time also contributed. The American psychologists gave little credence to the German idea of studying subjects by letting them make accounts of introspection. The learning perspective thus emerged as a reaction to the Germans' subjective study of the mind. It put an emphasis on the scientific study of observable behavior – i.e., what goes on in the mind is not important, only the resultant behavior. It has contributed to the scientific study of behavior (i.e. psychology as we study it) by advocating the experimental testing of hypotheses. Learning psychology is extreme in its favoring of experiments ahead of observational studies and case studies.

== Basic assumptions of the learning perspective ==

# Only behaviour that can be seen may be studied.&lt;br&gt;
# Behavior can be changed through new learning and unlearning.&lt;br&gt;
# Human behavior is determined by the conditioning history of the individual (determinism)&lt;br&gt;
# All species learn the same way.&lt;br&gt;
# Complex behavior is caused by simple mechanisms (reductionism)

== Classical conditioning ==

(One of the key theories of the learning perspective.)
&lt;br&gt;

;Definitions 
:Something that is conditioned is learnt or acquired.
:A stimulus is something that affects the sense organs.

&lt;br&gt;
The idea of classical conditioning was born with the scientist '''Ivan Pavlov''', who discovered that when dogs were presented with food, they began to salivate. When the presenting of food was repeatedly coupled with another, neutral stimulus, such as a bell chiming, the dogs would begin to salivate just upon hearing the bell. '''Watson''' took this idea further, generalizing it to saying that everything humans learn, they learn through classical conditioning. He made studies of Little Albert, who he got to develop a phobia for rats, by making a loud noise behind his back each time he was presented with a rat. He also supervised '''Jones''' as he experimented with Peter, whom Jones got to stop being afraid of rabbits by letting him have milk and cookies while there was a rabbit in the room, and gradually moving the rabbit closer over a number of sessions, while finally Peter could hold the rabbit without being afraid.

===The process of classical conditioning===
;The ''process'' of classical conditioning goes as follows:
:#'''Reflex.''' An unconditioned stimulus gives an unconditioned response, a reaction that goes directly through the nervous system and is faster than perception. Gagging and sneezing, for example. In Pavlov's case, the unconditioned stimulus was the sight of food, and the response was salivation.
:#'''Neutral stimulus''' without any specific reaction tied to it. In Pavlov's case, the ringing of a bell.
:#'''Pairing of an unconditioned stimulus and a neutral stimulus. ''' Pavlov presented the food at the same time as ringing the bell.
:#'''Conditioned (neutral) stimulus giving a conditioned response''' (somewhat weaker than the unconditioned response). Finally, the pairing will result in the neutral stimulus giving the associated response, that is, the dogs began salivating just upon hearing the bell.

===Studies and theories===
&lt;u&gt;Seligman&lt;/u&gt; developed the theory of preparedness, that humans are more likely to be conditioned to some things than others. 
&lt;u&gt;Öhman&lt;/u&gt; studied this, and found that he more easily could induce what he called “mini-phobias” of snakes than for example flowers when connecting slide pictures to electrical chocks.
&lt;u&gt;Garcia&lt;/u&gt; found that it is easier to create conditioned responses in rats using taste and smell, not sight. The opposite was found for pigeons. He believed that the reason was the animals' dependency on some senses above others.

Seligman, as stated above, developed the theory of preparedness, non-preparedness and contra preparedness in humans to be conditioned. The theory states that humans can fast and easily learn some behaviors through classical conditioning, and that this behavior is also more resistant to extinction, because humans are biologically prepared to learn it. Other behaviors we are not prepared to learn, and some we are prepared not to learn.

&lt;u&gt;Ader&lt;/u&gt; discovered, in an experiment on classical conditioning on rats, that the rats' bodily functions could also be conditioned. He fed the rats with saccharine water containing a poison that would give them a stomach ache, making the rats develop an aversion towards saccharine water. What he discovered was, since the poison also suppressed the rats' immune system, that when the rats were given unpoisoned saccharine water after developing the aversion, they also shut down their immune systems, eventually causing their deaths.

Studies have been made of the phenomena of ''anticipatory nausea and vomiting''. Patients undergoing chemo therapy often become nauseous following the treatment. This conditions them into associating the treatment with nausea, making them feel ill even prior to a treatment session.

&lt;u&gt;Garcia&lt;/u&gt; studied coyotes, making them hesitate to attack sheep by giving them poisoned meat, making them ill, wrapped in sheepskin. They were thus conditioned to associate the smell of sheep to illness.
&lt;br&gt;

===Summary of classical conditioning===

An association is formed between two stimuli (an unconditioned stimulus and a neutral stimulus), resulting in the subject having the same response to the neutral stimulus and the unconditioned stimulus. This could explain learnt and automatic emotional reactions in humans (e.g. aversions and phobias).

&lt;u&gt;Theorists:&lt;/u&gt; Pavlov and Watson &lt;br&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Research:&lt;/u&gt; The salivation of Pavlov's dogs, Watson's study of Little Albert, Jones' study of Little Peter, Ader's studies of rats and Garcia's studies of coyotes.&lt;br&gt;
''Newer:''&lt;br&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Theorist:&lt;/u&gt; Seligman, theory of preparedness&lt;br&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Studies:&lt;/u&gt; Öhman et al, skin conductance. &lt;br&gt;
''Important point: the theory of preparedness puts an emphasis on biological factors.''

== Operant conditioning ==
(Another key theory of the learning perspective.Note that this theory, as well as the theory on classical conditioning, is quite determinist.)
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

''Theorists''

;Thorndike (1913)
:Developed the idea of the law of effect: “Behavior is governed by its consequences.”
:Preformed experiments with cats, learning to open a “puzzle box” by trial and error.
:All organisms are spontaneously active. He developed the theory that humans learn from this spontaneous behavior. 
:“Spontaneous behavior which grants positive consequences is more likely to reoccur than behavior which grants no or negative consequences.”

;Skinner
:The Skinner box experiment. Put a pigeon into a specially designed box which delivered food when the pigeon did what Skinner wanted it to do.
:Developed theories of operant conditioning.
:Shaping behavior. Successive approximations to required behavior are rewarded and learnt.
:Chaining behavior. One kind of behavior is rewarded and learnt, then another kind which is added to be successive to the first, etc.
:Reinforcement. There is positive reinforcement and negative reinforcement. Positive R means presenting something that is wanted, a reward. Negative R means taking away something that is unwanted.
:Punishment. Positive, negative. Positive P, presenting something unwanted, e.g. slapping. Negative P, taking away something wanted, e.g. fines (taking away money).
:Reinforcement and punishment do not need to be dealt by a particular person. Reinforcement aims to lead to repetition of a behavior, punishment aims to lead to avoidance of it.

== Language acquisition (in children) ==
(Note that this psychological question is particularly well suited for evaluation.)

Some psychologist have attempted to explain language acquisition through operant conditioning. Skinner, for example, saw language as a verbal behavior that is reinforced and shaped. As can be seen in handout 8, this has proven to be unsatisfactory to explain language acquisition.

&lt;u&gt;Noam Chomsky&lt;/u&gt; has criticized Skinner's simplistic view and come up with a view of his own. He hypothesizes that humans have a unique biological and cognitive '''Language Acquisition Device, LAD''' which automatically detects the rules of a language. His arguments are
*If language was acquired through reinforcement and shaping, children learning a language would make all kinds of errors in their language, which they don't.
*Language is learnt by a predetermined order – children start by forming “one-word sentences”, then go on to two words, etc.
*Language would take a lot of time to acquire if Skinner was correct, when it in reality is very rapid.
*It has been shown that parents don't interfere very much, i.e. supply very little reinforcement, in their children's learning process.
*Language seems to evolve by a nature of its own. The mesh that is created when two languages meet, Pidgin, is in the second generation developed into a more advanced language, Creole.

== Social learning theory ==
Main theorist: Bandura.
Please add more information to this section.

Bandura used bo-bo dolls to investigate wheather children copy adults behavior (modeling).== Alternative learning theories ==
===Imprinting=== 
The theory that humans and non-human animals have certain critical or sensitive periods for learning. &lt;u&gt;Lorenz&lt;/u&gt; studied ducklings and found that in their first 24 hours, the first thing they see move, they will have an instinct to follow. This normally means their mother. &lt;u&gt;Bowlby&lt;/u&gt; developed this into the attachment theory, saying that children need to have frequent contact with their parents in order to attach to them and adhere to their values.

===Insight learning===
&lt;u&gt;Köhler&lt;/u&gt; gave rise to this theory, saying that we learn not only by conditioning, but also by the cognitive process, thinking. His theory is supported by his study of a chimpanzee in a cage who figured out how to reach a banana with a stick.

===Learned helplessness===
A theory on depression.&lt;u&gt;Seligman&lt;/u&gt; gave rise to the theory and made studies of for example dogs on electrocuting floors. He found that those who were given the possibility to prevent the electrical shocks to happen were more inclined to take the opportunity to free themselves of the floor than the ones who could not change their situation. In effect, the dogs had learned that they were helpless.

== Questions to be prepared for in the exam ==

*Identifying an assumption of the learning perspective and relating it to a theory or study.
*Describing the historical or cultural background of the the perspective.
*Outlining an explanation of a psychological or social questions based on learning, and evaluating this explanation.
*Describing how the perspective has contributed to the study of psychology.
*Describing an empirical study related to the perspective and its applications.
*Describing a theory related to the perspective and evaluating it.

The '''''Protean Charm''''' makes multiple objects act as if they are the same object – changes made to one object appear on all of them.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

In order to make it easier to contact all the members of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Dumbledore's Army|Dumbledore's Army]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] creates a large number of false [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Money|Galleons]]. These Galleons are charmed such that, once the date of the next meeting is determined, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] can change one Galleon to show that date, and all the others will similarly change, and heat up to let their holders know that they have changed. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Terry Boot|Terry Boot]] recognizes the charm as a Protean Charm, and is impressed: this is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/NEWT exams|NEWT-level magic]].

A parallel is drawn to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dark Mark|Dark Mark]] tattoo that Death Eaters wear on their left forearm, and Hermione indicates that she had not thought that Harry would want to inflict pain on his prospective students.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

Heard in air, Mermish is thin and screechy, because Merpeople's vocal equipment is geared to the more viscous aquatic environment. In the thin stuff that is our air, the vibrating bits move far too fast, making the tone of their voices hurtful to human ears.

After the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Second Task|Second Task]] of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Triwizard Tournament|Triwizard Tournament]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] speaks with the mer-Chieftainess to determine what had happened under the lake.

While at first glance, this seems to be a special version of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Enervate|Enervate]], the charm that counters the effect of a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Stupefy|Stun]] spell, in fact it seems to be used for more general resuscitation.

We see this spell used once: [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] uses it to attempt to revive [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] after Dumbledore has succumbed to the potion guarding the locket in the lake. Harry has limited success.

== Overview ==

One of a number of cleaning charms, '''''Tergeo''''' seems to siphon fluids or dust off a surface.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

In ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'', Hermione uses this spell to remove blood from Harry's robes; later, she uses it to clean spilled ink off Ron's Dementor essay.

In ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'', Ron uses this to clean grease off a rag which he then gives to Hermione to wipe her eyes with, and later [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] uses this spell to clean dust off pictures that he finds in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bathilda Bagshot|Bathilda Bagshot]]'s house.

This charm seems to be related in effect to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Evanesco|Evanesco]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Scourgify|Scourgify]].

name=Transfiguration Today|
type=Publication|
features=Professional journal|
appearance=[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'']]}}

== Overview ==

'''''Transfiguration Today''''' seems to be a professional journal, read by the more advanced wizards interested in learning about new magical techniques.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

It is mentioned that, when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] is staying at The Leaky Cauldron after blowing up his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Marge Dursley|Aunt Marge]], there are elderly wizards sitting in the parlor, reading ''Transfiguration Today''.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Snape]]'s memories, in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 33|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], there is a scene where Snape is railing at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] about what an awful student Harry is. Dumbledore is only giving Snape about half his attention; as he listens, he is reading ''Transfiguration Today''.

== Analysis ==

Just as there are mass-market periodicals like ''[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Witch Weekly|Witch Weekly]]'', ''[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/The Daily Prophet|The Daily Prophet]]'', and ''[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/The Quibbler|The Quibbler]]'', there must be more professional publications that are similar to our scientific journals. After all, magic is not static; we hear that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Wolfsbane Potion|Wolfsbane Potion]] was invented recently by an uncle of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Marcus Belby|Marcus Belby]], and there are other advances alluded to in various places. While the mass media will trumpet the existence of such advances, when they happen, the professional journal will go into detail as to how the effects are achieved. ''Transfiguration Today'' is clearly such a professional journal.

name=Vampire|
type=Magical creature|
features=Apparent appetite for blood|
appearance=[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'']]}}

== Overview ==

'''''Vampires''''' are apparently the same for the Wizarding world as for Muggles: nocturnal human-like creatures, with self-awareness, and with an appetite for blood, especially from young female humans.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

We first see mention of vampires when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] is talking about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Professor Quirrell|Professor Quirrell]]; Hagrid suggests that he may now be so frightened because he ran into one. Later, a strange odour is noticed, apparently coming from Quirrell's turban; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred and George]] suggest that it may be that Quirrell has stuffed his turban full of garlic in order to ward off vampires.

We next see mention of vampires in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gilderoy Lockhart|Lockhart]]'s book, of which we only see the title: ''Voyages with Vampires''. Given Lockhart's apparent ability to create achievements out of whole cloth, we are left wondering whether vampires exist in the Wizarding world any more than they do in the Muggle world.

It turns out that they do exist; in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn]] says that he has invited an actual vampire, plus the writer who wrote the book about him, to his Christmas Slug Club party. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]], who cannot arrange to escape the party, invites [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Luna Lovegood|Luna Lovegood]]. On hearing that there will be a vampire present, Luna immediately guesses that Slughorn has invited [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rufus Scrimgeour|Rufus Scrimgeour]]. Apparently, ''[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/The Quibbler|The Quibbler]]'' was planning to publish an article stating that Scrimgeour was a vampire, but that it had had to be spiked under pressure from the Ministry of Magic.

While the vampire, who turns out to be named Sanguini, and his friend are present, the vampire, who has to be restrained from stalking some of the female students there present, does not say much at all.

== Analysis ==

Very little is said to us about characteristics of vampires. We learn that they exist, but whether they are injured by sunlight, whether they are able to cross running water, and whether they are able to withstand silver, garlic, and Christian religious symbols is never addressed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Using the reskin of &lt;code&gt;kuid:86627:1654&lt;/code&gt; covered above as an example.  The first step to uploading is to update the &lt;code&gt;config.txt&lt;/code&gt; file.  Edit the &lt;code&gt;config.txt&lt;/code&gt; file in a text editor like Notepad, rather than a word processor such as Microsoft Word, and change the following lines.  Be careful to stay within the quotes and do note add any quotation marks or { } brackets.  Make a back up before editing as CMP has been known to delete everything after an entry it doesn't understand.

The following are the essentials, use the TC Content Creator's Guide for more details on the values for other fields.
&lt;pre&gt;
name               &quot;Basic plank wagon&quot;
username           &quot;Basic plank wagon&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

These should be changed for your new name.  One is used by TRS2006 / TC and one by TRS2004.

&lt;pre&gt;
description        &quot;A basic five plank wagon.  designed to be simple to reskin.  It uses a modified Paul Hobbs texture file.  It has working Eldavo's Couplestar couplers
                   and Chameleon is used to allow 15 different wagon numbers to be selected in surveyor.  wagonzip.txt  contains the GMAX source Lod 560 / 560 / 560 /

organisation
contact-website    &quot;http://trainz-carriage-wagon-works.com/&quot;

license            &quot;You may reskin this item for upload to the DLS or other web site as long as it does not become payware.  You must include this licence with the reskin.
                   Please email John Whelan jwhelan0112@gmail.com as a courtesy if you do reskin it.
                   The package may be redistributed freely provided the content of the package is unchanged, i.e. no files have been added, removed or modified. The
                   package may not be sold, neither solely nor as a part of a compilation, without written permission of the author.&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

The above lines should be changed to reflect your information and it is customary to add its reskin of xyz's work in the description as well as leaving their name in the licence area.

This particular item uses a reference to a 240 by 180 .jpg for the download station in the config.txt file.  

&lt;pre&gt;
thumbnails{
         0{
              image
              width
              height
         }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

The simplest way to change this to yours is to replace the file reskin240.jpg with a .jpg that measures 240 by 180 pixels.  Note this works but if you change the name you must spell it exactly the same and it is case sensitive.

Now having got you reskin or other item ready to upload drag it to the uploads in CMP.  You need to do the following three steps.

[[File:Trainz Upload.jpg|thumb|center|900px|Click [[Media:Trainz Upload.jpg|here]] to enlarge.]]

Once uploaded it goes through an automated checking process and twenty four hours later you may release it from the preview area which is reached through your profile.  If you don't release it it goes no further and this is sometimes a source of frustration.

[[File:Planet Auran.jpg]] 

There after it has to be manually released by Auran.

'''CM''' or '''Content Manager.exe''' was a stand alone utility from Trainz 1.0 with which users could install new modeling assets, or export a route to share. While still a separate module, TRS2004's ContentManager was further evolved, but still primarily a database access tool and there were separate programs for managing the FTP transactions of uploading and downloading {{TG|C|cdp file}} assets to the new {{TL|Download Station}}.

CMP ('''Content Manager Plus''') was a feature of TRS2006 and Trainz Classics only and is accessible via the Trainz start-up launch screen. Its purpose is to manage the assets on your hard drive (located in your Trainz/local folder) and also manage downloading from the DLS. CMP has a sophisticated search facility and automatically downloads dependencies associated with each asset. CMP is closely integrated to CCP and is also used to open assets for editing and committing them for use in Trainz. In TRS2006 and above, new assets are created via CMP.
&lt;noinclude&gt;
{{TrainzTip|The parent 'Content Manager' page to this page was overhauled in March 2014, but the 'Blog' section below was so charmingly written ''and mostly still applicable'', (from an experiential point of view, it gives the flavor of using the CMs your first few time really well--provided sounds are enabled!) I thought it worth retaining in some way. Hence this page was moved to be this subpage. While becoming less common, TRS installs, even TRS2004, are still out there and in use, so I'm keeping the Troubleshooting section as was written, with some improvements based on my over seven years experiences with TRS2006s foibles.
* The troubleshooting sections tips are now somewhat dated; so does not in any way ''generally apply'' to the newer CMs which are far less prone to freezing up. {{TL|TADdaemon}} is in charge now, and that gates transactions.

Consequently, having a backup of that file is highly recommended. See {{TL|Recommended practices}} for others and how to manage that easily.

== Troubleshooting ==

Unfortunately CMP is well known for it's bugs and problems. Crashes, freezes, corruption of assets, malfunction, unpredictability and loss of data are not uncommon for many users. The reliability of CMP varies from user to user and is dependent on the setup of the system and the operating system. 
{{TrainzTip|The above comment in all fairness applies mainly to pre-CM 2.0 ({{TL|TS2009|TS2009-SP0}}) CMPs. CMs bugs were tamed along the way, becoming foibles of {{TR|R|TADdaemon}}, and that story seems to have settled down as of May 2014.}}

The following is a list of some suggested remedies for common problems with CMP. It is based on a posting on the Auran forum by Rob Shaw.

* If CMP fails to start, press CTRL-ALT-DEL (or SHFT-CTRL-ESC) to invoke Windows Task Manager. In &quot;Processes&quot;, check if there is a second copy of ContentManager running and if so then end it.

* If CMP fails to recognize the user's login or ''incorrectly reports having no FCT'' (First Class Ticket) or some similar problem, check that the C:\Program Files\Auran\TRS2006\Settings folder hasn't any content set to read-only. Then ensure that the login details are entered properly via Launcher&gt;Options, and refresh them (change one letter of your username, then change it back).

* If CMP cannot connect to the server, check for any problems reported by the firewall program. If the problem persists, in CMP Settings &gt; Internet, choose &quot;Use Internet Explorer Settings&quot;, which is reported to sometimes help.

* CMP is reported to be more likely to crash frequently if there is a large amount of DLS content installed. In this case it may help to delete the ..\TRS2006\assets.tdx file and the ..\TRS2006\Cache folder contents. 
{{TrainzTip|'''Dated!''', Do not delete these in post-TC3 releases, but use TrainzUtil to instead do an commandline {{TN|E|EDR}} or {{TG|Q|QDR}}. In the TRS20006 family, deleting the assets.tdx index files forced it to be rebuilt, which is the same as a full EDR. ''However'', new post-CM 2.0 Trainz now keep user data in this file, so you break things (for 6-8 hours!) by deleting it.}} (The later is routinely deleted as CMP boots itself regardless.) This is because occasionally the database becomes corrupted for unknown reasons. You need to run TRS2006 after deleting those items before launching CMP again, and TRS2006 may take a long time to start the first time after deleting the database.
{{void|
* If CMP is taking a long time to rebuild the asset database, pressing ESC cancels the action.

NOTE: Last action will not work!

{{TrainzTip|EDITOR'S NOTE:

}}
After my first very hard 2-3 daze of trainz 2006, I have come to terms with CMP, in fact I'm in love, though it was a steep climb. Sure CMP hangs and breaks and sometimes &quot;forgets to leave physical memory, when it crashes, so it must be evicted through the Applications (or Processes) tag within Windows Task Manager; but when it stumbles, it can be picked up from where it left.

The first break through was turning sound on in CMP and listening to the sounds it makes. Then the download part begins to make a little sense:

DO NOT hit the start button immediately after move assets to the Download Helper window! Wait for it! A bell signals when the &quot;train of assets&quot; is ready for download.

WARNING: Failure to adhere to CMPs 'railroad rules and regulations' will increase the risk of wreckage and frustrations.

When departure signal have been given: press 'Start'. A doorman's whistle is blown and CMP begins downloading. (With a {{TN|F|FCT}} download usually maxes out the capacity of the connection, in my case up to 500KB/s.)

Another (undescribed) sound signals, when download helper has done as much as it could. The the real fun (as defined by Rimmer of Red Dwarf) begins. Press the 'Missing dependencies' for an initial assessment of the &quot;damage&quot;. Hopefully you have 'laptop' icons in the Status column all the way down to the floor.

Do not line up too many assets, unless you are positively asking for trouble. Control your greed and split larger transports into several 'trainz of assets'.

Sometimes CMP cannot find assets, even though they are on DLS. The search them out in DLS and press download there to marshall the next download train. Some are not found on DLS, then you'll be back in this Forum looking for hints.

Some assets come down in tears. Either with 'Missing dependencies' or as faulty. doNT paNIC, most of the problems are rather simple to fix. Begin by opening the Right Mouse Click menu on the misfortunate asset.

If missing dependencies, select View Dependencies, then press 'View in main list' on the popup window. Here the process is a recursive hunt for assets that are faulty or missing dependencies.

Faulty assets can be edited in 3 or 4 ways, but I chose not to install .NET to save precious disk and bug space, so I have only used 'Edit in Explorer' as I'm an old hacker, so I prefer to keep an eye on things without to many buggy tools between me and the real problem.

So, now we're down to a faulty asset. If you cannot fix it, be sure to disable it in the asset RC popup menu. Starting Trainz with faulty assets is a rather bad idea, since the result is unpredictable with inconvenient application crashes as the likely outcome.

Dive into the faulty asset with 'Edit in Explorer' (in the sub-popup menu under Edit in the asset popup menu), this will move the asset files to an editing folder in the trainz root (folder). Then pick 'View errors' on the assets popup menu in CMP, so you know what to fix in the asset folder. Most of the errors are rather silly syntax mistakes in the {{TA|config.txt file}} and the {{TG|Texture|*.texture.txt files}} describing the visual assets components. If you stumble into something you cannot fix, maybe someone has or can, so you'll be back at The Trainz Forum sharing the community fruits or seeding new ones.

With config and texture problems - if you do not know how to fix the assets - it usually suffices to but the word rem on the beginning of the text line CMP complains about. Fx if CMP complains about the word 'surely' in config.txt and a line like: ''&quot;surely cmp will sour over this line&quot;'' appears in the file.
: Simply add rem as a line prefix to turn it into a &quot;comment&quot;, like this:

:'''rem cmp will surely sour over this line''' (ed. says: Now invalid &amp;mdash; Error created in V2.9 and higher!)

To validate you fixes and reinstate the asset: select 'Commit' on aforementioned submenu. If all's well the red exclaimation ({{Col|&lt;big&gt;!&lt;/big&gt;|red}}) in the asset's status field will fade and you can proceed to the next trouble item. Otherwise recheck the 'View errors' and repeat the editing part just described.

Now, what we really need is a way to bring the fixed assets back to the DLS without the somewhat disrespect and rather clumsy solution of cloning the fixed asset (with your user ID) and uploading it to DLS under a new KUID. It would be cleaner and more respectful of the producers efforts to put it back with a version increment, so the next one that downloads it (as a dependency) gets the fixed asset instead of being forced to repeat the exercise I have described here.

So much for Trainz'06 and CMP. Vista is another matter, which I would have advised strongly against, if BG&amp;Co (Microsoft) had shown the courtesy of consulting me in advance;-). Unfortunately, the guys in SW (software) engineering still believe users and indeed other developers read manuals. This is at best naive, since it is pretty obvious, that quite few of them do so themselves, leading to various problems very similar in nature to those of the main topic in this reply.

Again: remember to commit all assets and disable what is or can not be fixed - before you start Trainz. Goodbye blue Monday.

NB: It would appear, that you must clone and archive the corrected assets in order to be able to restore your fixes after a cleanup.

== Overview ==

The '''''Ford Anglia''''' is a unique magical artifact. Created by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Arthur Weasley]], it is a one-time ordinary automobile that is now able to fly and has the capability of becoming invisible.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred, George]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron Weasley]] take this car out of its storage shed in order to bring [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] away from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Privet Drive|the Dursleys']], and bring him to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/The Burrow|the Burrow]]. They get into rather a lot of trouble for this when they are caught by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|their mother]].

The entire family is carried to King's Cross Station in this car, when it is time to go to Hogwarts. Arthur has placed a spell on the car so that it is larger inside than outside; Mrs. Weasley remarks on how Muggles are able to build a car that looks so small and has so much space inside. None of the others enlighten her.

When Harry and Ron are unable to get through the barrier at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Platform 9 and Three Quarters|Platform Nine and Three Quarters]], Harry suggests that they should go back to the car and wait. It occurs to Ron that their parents might not be able to get out of the platform any more than they can get in, and that they should take the car and fly to Hogwarts. They do so, in the process crashing into the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Whomping Willow|Whomping Willow]] on the school grounds. The car then throws them out and wanders off on its own into the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]].

Harry and Ron, venturing into the Forbidden Forest on the trail of the spiders, as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] had advised them, encounter the car, gone feral but still able to recognize Ron as its owner. They are then captured by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Acromantula|giant spiders]]. The spiders take them to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Aragog|Aragog, their leader]], who discusses some past events with Harry and Ron, and then consigns them to their fate: to be eaten by his children. The car rescues them, and leaves them at the edge of the Forest.

== Analysis ==

As any writer does, the author uses her own experience to provide background and events for the story she is writing. Many fan sites have mentioned that the turquoise Ford Anglia in this story is an immortalization of a similar vehicle owned by a friend of the author's. The author felt it was worthy of inclusion because the friend in question had taken her on excursions at times when she was most deeply distressed by events in her life. The twins and Ron helping Harry escape from imprisonment in this car, and the later rescue from the spiders, seem an obvious parallel to the friend's actions in a similar vehicle... though we expect that the actual vehicle did not ever actually leave the ground.

The main impetus for this vehicle would seem to be the requirement that Harry and Ron have some other way to get to school when the barrier at Platform 9 and Three quarters proves to be impassable. We will learn that the barrier was blocked by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dobby|Dobby]], who, fearful for Harry's life should he return to Hogwarts, was trying to prevent his reaching the Hogwarts Express. Given the author's history with the car, use of a Ford Anglia would have seemed appropriate.

Of course, getting the car back from Hogwarts would be a problem. One wonders somewhat why Mr. Weasley did not attempt to visit Hogwarts to recover the car, which as far as he knew was simply sitting on the castle grounds somewhere. Of course, if Mr. Weasley did attempt to recover the car, Mrs. Weasley would have come along with him, and would not have needed to send a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Howler|Howler]]. The existence of this particularly virulent form of Wizarding correspondence is mentioned a few times in later books, and its introduction at this point does give us an understanding of its nature in later episodes. As Mrs. Weasley elected to forward her feelings by Owl Post rather than expressing them personally, as she seems to prefer, we must assume that Mr. Weasley had somehow heard of his car's departure into the wild, and chosen not to try to recover it. The exposure of the events of Ron's escape in the Muggle news may have been a factor in his decision as well.

It is possible that the above could be a rationalization on the part of the author. We have seen elsewhere that the author's plan for the seven book story arc was very well developed at an early stage in the writing. From this, we can surmise that the need for a loyal and armored associate of Harry's to assist in the escape from the Acromantulae would already be in the author's consideration when the Anglia first enters the story. Given the existence of the Ford Anglia, it is not unlikely that giving it sufficient initiative the hide itself in the Forest, and later to come to Ron's and Harry's rescue, would be a relatively small stretch of the imagination. Many automobiles already seem, at least to their owners, to have personalities anyway; assigning the Ford Anglia a certain instinct for self-preservation would be almost expected, and has in fact been suggested in automobiles appearing in earlier fiction. As the exigencies of the story require that the Anglia remain resident in the Forest, it is not impossible that the failure to recover the car on Mr. Weasley's part is simply a way of readying a plot device.

==What writing system(s) does this language use?==
The Mongolian Language uses primarily the Cyrillic alphabet, which is also used by Russian, Ukrainian, and Belarusian.  It used a variety of other scripts over the years until it finally settled with Cyrillic in 1937, influenced by the U.S.S.R.  The Mongolian-Cyrillic alphabet uses the following: 
Аа - а  
 
Бб - b 

Вв - v 

Гг - g 

Дд - d 

Ее - e  

Ёё - ё 

Жж - dz 

Зз - z 

Ии - i 
 
Йй - i 
 
Кк - k 
 
Лл - l 

Мм - m 
 
Нн - n

Оо - o 

Өө - u ö
 
Пп - p 
 
Рр - r 

Сс - s 
 
Тт - t 
 
Уу - u 

Үү - u ü
 
Фф - f

Цц - ts 
 
Хх - h 
    
Чч - ch 
 
Шш - sh

Щщ - schsh
 
Ъъ - &quot; 

Ыы - i y 

Ьь - '
 
Ээ - e
  
Юю - ju
  
Яя - ja  j



The Cyrillic alphabet is still currently used.

==How many people speak this language?==
Around 5.7 million people speak this language in total.

==Where is this language spoken?==
Mongolian is spoken in Mongolia and in China (Inner Mongolia).

==What is the history of this language?==
==Who are some famous authors or poets in this language?==
==What are some basic words in this language that I can learn?==

Сайн байн уу - Hello ( formal )


Сайн уу - Hello ( informal )

Намайг ____ гэдэг - My name is ____

Би ____ ooc/aac/ээс/өөс ирсэн - I came from ____

==Introduction==

Researchers strive to identify and map enzymatic pathways that are critical to the functionality of endocrine cells, with the intention of applying this knowledge to therapeutic development for a myriad of disorders. &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C NMR spectroscopy and isotopomer analysis have proven to be very useful in quantitative analysis of cell metabolic processes via intermediate labeling, and estimate carbon entry into the TCA cycle. Furthermore, researchers have discussed and reported the details of NMR application to analyzing cell tissue extracts. The experiments conducted on neuroendocrine tissue samples have revealed specific cautionary measures that must be taken, ways in which to apply &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C NMR, and how to infer &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C NMR results.

Utilization of NMR spectroscopy entails manipulating the nulei of atoms that contain a nuclear spin, with a magnetic field, ultimately generating a signal. This signal may then be interpreted to provide biochemical, structural, and anatomical information of an analyte. &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C NMR involves observing the non-radioactive &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C carbon isotope. Unlike the &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C carbon isotope, the &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C isotope has a nuclear spin, making it readily observable by NMR. Tracking of &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C through cell metabolism involved feeding cells a metabolizable &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C label (on glucose, for example), and using &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C NMR to monitor its progress through metabolic processes including the TCA cycle, citric acid cycle and glycolysis. Carbon flux through metabolic pathways was observed via &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C labeling of glutamate, an amino acid, and a 5-carbon TCA cycle byproduct, before employing NMR spectroscopy. This analytical method, however, was prone to a number of pitfalls. Reducing the probability of these errors mandates appropriate preventative measures, which include identifying any impact of media on cellular or carbon label behavior, as well as proper application and selection of metabolic models when interpreting &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C NMR data.

Experimental results indicated NMR application significance when researching pituitary adenomas. Specific results included the determination of the capacities of host metabolic modulators. Applications also might allow for observing the influences of a cell function modulator allowing for the observation of any existing interrelationships between metabolism and cell function. NMR application is expected to enable researchers to identify the fate of labeled carbons through metabolic pathways that are pertinent to hormone release. However, researchers must take care and employ the most physiologically relevant media and modern metabolic models lest their experimental results be invalid or inapplicable to previous results. In essence, eliciting proper application of &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C NMR spectroscopy is anticipated to provide information that will lead to a better understanding of cell energetics.

&lt;big&gt;'''13C Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy'''&lt;/big&gt;

	'''Overview:''' 13C-NMR is an analytical technique that is used to identify the number and type of carbons in an organic molecule and the number of non-equivalent carbon atoms. It is also used to determine structure of compounds. Since 13-carbon has a spinning nucleus that has magnetic properties, NMR can be performed. The compound containing the 13-carbon atoms is placed in a very strong magnetic field and irradiated with electromagnetic energy. The nuclei absorb energy called magnetic resonance. This energy absorption is quantized and produces a spectrum for the particular compound. Spectrometers are instruments used to measure the absorption of energy by the 13C nuclei. They are very powerful magnets and irradiate the nuclei with electromagnetic radiation in the radio frequency region. The spectrum is produced as a graph with various peaks. Each unique carbon atom in a molecule produces only one peak. Where the peak is located on the graph depends on chemical shift. Chemical shift is determined by the surrounding electron density of each carbon in a molecule. Based on where the peak is and its chemical shift, the structure of organic molecules can be determined, as well as what functional groups or other atoms are attached to each carbon atom.

Wikipedia Carbon- 13 NMR

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon-13_NMR 

'''Focus:''' This website gives a basic overview of what carbon-13 NMR is used for and how it works. It focuses mainly on the complications that this type of nuclear magnetic resonance has in comparison to proton NMR. 

'''Terms:'''
a) spin quantum number- the intrinsic angular momentum of an electron (or the spin of a electron) 
b) chemical shift- frequency of the resonance expressed with reference to a standard compound defined at 0 ppm; position on the NMR scale where the peak occurs (measured in ppm)
c) ppm- parts per million; used to measure the chemical shift 
d) J-coupling- the coupling between two nuclear spins due to the influence of bonding electrons in the magnetic field running between the two nuclei (between carbon and hydrogen in 13C-NMR causes reduced sensitivity and makes the spectra harder to read) 
e) 1H-NMR (proton magnetic resonance imaging)- used to identify hydrogen atoms in an organic molecule

'''Connection:''' When talking about the glycolysis pathway, we traced the carbon atoms through the pathway to see where they ended up in pyruvate. 13C-NMR is what the carbons are marked with so that they can be followed throughout the pathway.

Carbon-13 NMR Tutorial

http://www.wfu.edu/~ylwong/nmr/c13/

'''Focus:''' This website gives a really good overview of 13C-NMR. It describes what 13C-NMR is used for and how it works. It also describes chemical shift and splitting of carbon from hydrogen. There are exercises that are interactive to help you to further understand how it works and how to interpret the 13C-NMR spectrum for different compounds. 

'''Terms:'''
a) resonance- when the energy required to flip the proton from its lower energy state to its higher energy state in the magnetic field is proportional to the strength of the magnetic field
b) aliphatic-  class of saturated or unsaturated carbon compounds, in which the carbon atoms are joined in open chains
c) TMS (tetramethylsilane)- reference compound; signals a zero point on the spectrum
d) aromatic compound- cyclic conjugated unsaturated molecule that is stabilized by electron delocalization

'''Connection:''' Most of the molecules formed in the metabolic pathways that we studied in class were probably identified using 13C-NMR. We can also find out where certain carbons end up in metabolic pathway products and how much of the product is produced by tracing them using 13C-NMR.

NMR Spectroscopy

http://www.cem.msu.edu/~reusch/VirtualText/Spectrpy/nmr/nmr1.htm

'''Focus:''' This website provides a good overview of proton and 13C-NMR spectroscopy. There is a section on 13C-NMR spectroscopy which includes problems associated with it, improvements, what it is used for and it really goes into the physical principles behind it. They also explain the two spectrometers that are used, continuous wave and Fourier Transform. On another page they provide a link to, they include additional information on 13C-NMR such as off-resonance decoupling and insensitive nuclear enhancement by polarization transfer which are techniques for classifying carbon signals.

'''Terms:'''
a) heteronuclear decoupling – an electronic technique that allows decoupling of spin-spin interactions between 13C nuclei and 1H nuclei
b) pulse technology- irradiating the molecule with short pulses of electromagnetic radiation instead of slowly sweeping the magnetic field with electromagnetic radiation; another type of NMR spectroscopy that uses Fourier transform spectrometers 
c) isomer- one of two or more compounds that have the same chemical formula but different arrangements of the atoms within the molecules
d) homotopic- giving superposable products upon substitution, and therefore spectroscopically and chemically identical
e) continuous wave method- irradiation of a molecule with electromagnetic energy of a constant frequency while the magnetic field is varied or swept; type of NMR spectrometer

'''Connection:''' 13C-NMR would be a great tool to learn and use if we were to really go in depth about structures of metabolites or any other type of molecule in class. Like mentioned before, we did introduce 13C-NMR when we went over glycolysis by tracing the carbons through the pathway.

Localized in vivo 13C NMR spectroscopy of the brain

http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&amp;pubmedid=14679498 

'''Focus:''' This is a really good article that discusses the uses of 13C-NMR to learn about carbohydrate metabolism in the brain. The article first discusses the difficulties that are faced when using 13C-NMR and successful implementation of localized 13C-NMR spectroscopy. Then the author discusses the achievements of in vivo localized 13C-NMR spectroscopy of the brain which include the measurement of glutamine synthesis and brain glycogen metabolism in hypoglycemic  rats and humans, to name a few. 

'''Terms:'''
a) in vivo- within a living organism
b) autoradiography-  technique that uses X-ray film to visualize radioactively labeled molecules or fragments of molecules
c) tomography- series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body; the pictures are created by a computer linked to an x-ray machine
d) RF (radio frequency)- the region of the electromagnetic spectrum that the radiation is in
e) hypoglycemia- state of low blood sugar
f) shimming- correction of inhomogeneity of the magnetic field produced by the main magnet of an NMR system due to imperfections in the magnet

'''Connection:''' In relation to what we did in class, we talked about glutamine synthesis and how glutamine carries Ammonia which is toxic to our body. 13C-NMR helps us study glutamine synthesis. If we were to alter gene expression or introduce certain chemicals into the rat, we could see if that affects the rate of glutamine synthesis. Ammonia accumulation is especially toxic to the brain and can cause death. By finding out what causes the low level of glutamine synthesis and over-accumulation of ammonia, we may be able to find a medical treatment. Also we discussed hypoglycemia in class.

Metabolic Imaging by Hyperpolarized 13C Magnetic Resonance Imaging for In vivo Tumor Diagnosis

http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/content/full/66/22/10855  

'''Focus:''' This article discusses the use of 13C-NMR in cancer research, particularly in the diagnosis of tumors. Most tumors exhibit a high rate of aerobic glycolysis called the Warburg effect. They are using a method that involves magnetic resonance spectroscopy and a hyperpolarization technique that improves the signal strength for detectable compounds on a very short time scale.  The glycolytic pathway compound that they are choosing to trace is pyruvate with 13C-NMR. They are watching how it is transformed to lactate and alanine and then they are able to trace all three substrates throughout cells. The results are interesting. They demonstrate that a high concentration of lactate was present in the tumor cells which indicate that tumor cells prefer the anaerobic pathways even in the presence of oxygen. Also the amount of pyruvate taken up by the tumor cell indicates that they require a lot of energy.

'''Terms:'''
a) noninvasive- a procedure that does not cut or penetrate the skin
b) hyperpolarized- an increase in nuclear spin polarization beyond thermal equilibrium conditions
c) phenotype- the observable traits or characteristics of an organism (in this case, biochemical traits)
d) 18FDG- radiopharmaceutical used in positron emission tomography
e) necrosis- death of cells or tissue
f) PET (Positron Emission Tomography)- special type of X-ray using a radioactive dye which shows areas of the brain that have a higher or lower metabolism than normal

'''Connection:''' In relation to biochemistry, this article is all about the glycolytic pathway in tumor cells. They were able to trace carbons in pyruvate through glycolysis and then through lactic acid fermentation. 13C-NMR is being used to detect tumors metabolically. This has many medical applications particularly in cancer research.

'''Connection:''' In class, we discussed how plants synthesize carbohydrates. MeG is a carbohydrate that is synthesized from glucose and methanol. MeG is beneficial to certain plants because it aides in ridding the plant of a toxic molecule.  We did talk about how humans get rid of waste products but this could lead us into discussion of how plants get rid of their waste products.

LC-MS-BASED METABOLOMICS IN DRUG METABOLISM
http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&amp;artid=2140249 

Summary:
This paper describes techniques to identify xenobiotic metabolites and metabolic pathways.  Currently, the primary techniques used to gather data are in vitro incubation assays in human and animal trials and in vivo radiotracing experiments. In vitro assays are performed using hepatocyte, mirosome, recombinanat human P450s incubations and liver perfusion.   These investigators, however, have shown that LC-MS based metabolomic techniques are helpful for xenobiotic metabolism.  All living organisms perform some sort of metabolism to facilitate removal of foreign substances. Xenobiotic metabolites and metabolism has become a main componenet of drug metabolism and chemical toxicology.

Most widely used analytical instruments in metabolomic research are nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), spectrometers, and mass spectroscopy (ms).  Also used, but less frequently is electrochemistry or infrared spectroscopy.  Prepared biological samples into a mass spectrometer can be used through direct injection, gas chromatography, liquid chromatography, and capillary electrophoresis.  Liquid chromatography (LC-MS) is used the most because LC based samples result in lesser ion suppression and higher resolution.

This article explores applicable approaches using LC-MS based metabolomic techniques to facilitate problems in drug metabolism.  Investigators compared the in vitro and in vivo methods in drug metabolism to LC-MS techniques and showed that LC-MS has an advantage because of its capacity to hold large datasets and is able to graphically represent metabolism samples as a way of classification.  It is though that as LC-MS technology and MDA software increase in availability the use of LC-MS metabolomics will be widely used in xenobiotic metabolism.

Terms: 
-Xenobiotic metabolism- refers to the set of metabolic pathways that chemically modify xenobiotics, which are compounds foreign to an organism's normal biochemistry, such as drugs and poisons.

-in silico- is an expression used to mean &quot;performed on computer or via computer simulation.&quot; The phrase is coined from the Latin phrases in vivo and in vitro
LC-MS- is liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy.  It is a technique that combines the physical separation capabilities of liquid chromatography with the mass analysis capabilities of mass spectrometry. LC-MS is a powerful technique used for many applications which has very high sensitivity and specificity. LC-MS is frequently used in drug development at many different stages including Peptide Mapping, Glycoprotein Mapping, Natural Products Dereplication, Bioaffinity Screening, In Vivo Drug Screening, Metabolic Stability Screening, Metabolite Identification, Impurity Identification, Degradant Identification, Quantitative Bioanalysis, and Quality Control

-Microsome- is a small vesicle that is derived from fragmented smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) produced when tissues such as liver are mechanically broken (homogenized). Microsomes contain the cell's cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, involved in oxidative metabolism.

-software- Multivariate Data Analysis refers to any statistical technique used to analyze data that arises from more than one variable. This essentially models reality where each situation, product, or decision involves more than a single variable.

-XME polymorphisms- XMEs are xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes.  Not much is know but they can be used in gene knock out models to help elucidate their role in xenobiotic metabolism and function.

-PCA analysis- Principal components analysis (PCA) is a technique used to reduce multidimensional data sets to lower dimensions for analysis. PCA is mostly used as a tool in exploratory data analysis and for making predictive models. PCA involves the calculation of the eigenvalue decomposition or Singular value decomposition of a data set, usually after mean centering the data for each attribute. The results of a PCA are usually discussed in terms of component scores and loadings.

-Cytochrome P450- abbreviated CYP, P450, and sometimes CYP450 is a very large and diverse superfamily of hemoproteins found in bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. Cytochromes P450 use a plethora of both exogenous and endogenous compounds as substrates in enzymatic reactions. Usually they form part of multicomponent electron transfer chains, called P450-containing systems.

-CYP1A2- a member of the cytochrome P450 mixed-function oxidase system, is involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics in the body. Expression of CYP1A2 appears to be induced by various dietary constituents.

Relevance:
This article is related to some course material we have covered.  Organisms are also exposed to compounds that they cannot use as foods/fuel and would be harmful if they accumulated in cells, as they have no metabolic function (xenobiotics).  Xenobiotics are common in sewage treatment areas and can be attained through fish, drugs, and antibiotics.

The first phase of xenobiotic metabolism involves metabolic activation of xenobiotics (ie compounds that may be derived from drugs or environmental toxins).  Several enzymes can take a part in this phase.  We learned about redox reactions in chapter 13 and how electrons can be transferred as electrons, as hydride,  as a hydrogen atom, or in combination with O2.  Xenobiotics can be detoxified by a set of xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes such as cytochrome P450 oxidase where an atom of oxygen is added to non-active hydrocarbons. In this case electrons are transferred in combination with O2.  Another enzyme that could be used in metabolic activation is flavin monoxygenases, which catalyze reactions in where one of the two oxygen atoms of O2 is incorporated into the substrate.  These flavin monoxygenases use reduced flavin nucleotides (FMNH2 or FADH¬2).   We learned that flavin molecules are involved in carbon-carbon bonds and they can participate in 1 electron transfers. Furthermore, another enzyme that can contribute to metabolic activation is alcohol dehydrogenase.  In chapter 14 we looked at the use of alcohol dehydrogenase in the production of ethanol in yeast by fermentation.  Alcohol dehydrogenase converted acetaldehyde using NADH to ethanol and NAD+.

===Diabetes research===

====Article 1====

Insufficient beta-cell mass and insulin production are characteristic of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Islet mass can be expanded ex vivo or in vivo and used as a substantial treatments for either form of diabetes. Cholecystokinin (CCK) stimulates beta-cell proliferation in human islets, while retaining beta-cell function.

Therapy that causes the expansion of beta-cells in the absence of alpha-cell proliferation places diabetic patients at risk for hypoglycemia. However, this can potentially be avoided with concomitant alpha-cell expansion. As a result, the co-expansion of alpha-cells and beta-cells via CCK-dependent pathways may restore hypoglycemic responsiveness and insulin independence, for patients that receive islet transplants.

CCK overexpression triggers beta-cell proliferation through a unique pathway. This impact on beta-cell proliferation implies that CCK has a potentially therapeutic value for islet cell transplants or enhancing beta-cell mass. Researchers hope to better understand the signaling pathways that activate the factors of cell cycle machinery that respond to CCK, in order to identify other therapeutic agents.

====Article 2====

Elevated circulating ferritin concentrations are associated with a higher risk of type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome in middle-aged and elderly Chinese people that were independent of obesity, inflammation, adipokines and other risk factors. This highlights the significant role of iron overload for metabolic diseases especially in a country with a relatively high prevalence of iron deficiency.

There is a strong positive association between elevated iron stores, and the risks of type 2 diabetes, impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and metabolic syndrome in middle-aged and elderly Chinese men and women. There is also a substantial positive correlation between ferritin and HbA1c in diabetic participants for both Chinese men and women. These facts highlight the crucial role of iron overload as a significant independent risk factor for metabolic diseases in subgroups of developing countries.

There are substantially different bodily ferritin concentrations among different geographic locations of China. These differences in iron levels may be attributed to multivariate dietary patterns.

There is also a strong positive association between elevated plasma ferritin concentrations and the risk of type 2 diabetes, IFG and metabolic syndrome in both Chinese men and women.

Elevated ferritin concentrations frequently cluster with well-established risk factors of type 2 diabetes that include obesity, metabolic syndrome and inflammation.

Inflammation is a suggested regulator of ferritin mRNA and protein levels, as well as ferritin secretion. It is believed that ferritin may increase the risk of type 2 diabetes, IFG or metabolic syndrome via a pathway that does not significantly overlap with C-reactive protein (CRP) and other inflammatory diseases.

Metabolic syndrome is a strong risk factor for type 2 diabetes, but this syndrome has scarcely been researched in the ferritin-diabetes associated studies. Elevated ferritin concentrations may increase the risk of type 2 diabetes via mechanisms that do not include the metabolic syndrome.

===Research on Cisplatin Uptake===

Cellular resistance to cisplatin potentially comprises of mechanisms that limit cisplatin uptake, accumulation, altered cellular repair mechanisms, and changes that promote cell survival. Altered cisplating uptake has been proven to occur from a reduction in membrane-binding/transport proteins, and endocytosis. It has also been proven that up-regulation of SIRT1 is a contributor of cisplatin resistance that is in association with altered mitochondrial metabolism.

A cell will obtain the majority of its energy via oxidative phosphorylation, which is executed in the mitochondria. Any alteration in the glycolytic metabolic pathway of a cell could substantially affect biosynthetic reactions and cellular susceptibility, when under stress.

The mitochondria serve as ideal targets for cisplatin toxicity, because previous research has exhibited that cells with a reduced number of mitochondria are substantially more resistant to cisplatin than normal cells. 

The disruption of glucose uptake is associated with abnormal mitochondrial function. 

Over expression of SIRT1 results in reduced oxygen consumption as well as altered mitochondrial bioenergenesis. Oxygen consumption is linked to the generation of reactive oxygen species, and reactive oxygen species levels are correlated with cisplatin toxicity.

When glucose is limited, there is an over expression of SIRT1, which increases the cisplatin resistance of parent cells. However, reducing glucose metabolism has also proven to result in SIRT1 over expression with elevated cisplatin resistance. 

Researchers have surmised a mechanism by which the over expression of SIRT1 contributes to cisplatin resistance. When incorporated into DNA or RNA, cisplatin perturbs nucleic acid structure and function, which results in the destruction of tumor cells. SIRT1 deacetylates the p53 protein that recognizes and binds to DNA that has been modified by cisplatin. The SIRT1-induced deacetylation results in reduced p53-dependent apoptosis, when DNA is damaged. The interaction of p53 and SIRT1 after platination may molecularly link DNA damage and p52-mediated DNA repair.

SIRT1 is involved in cellular metabolism, and requires NAD+ to function. Researchers have discovered that NAD+ concentration is higher in cells that overexpress SIRT1. Low NAD+ concentrations would allegedly diminish SIRT1 deacetylase activity, and increase the likelihood of cell senescence or apoptosis via p53 acetylation. The NAD+ dependence of the deacetylase activity of SIRT1 seems to imply that SIRT1 may regulate NAD+ metabolism. Specifically, SIRT1 might serve as a bridge that coordinates the metabolic status with regulation of key target genes that are involved in cancer resistance to cisplatin.

SIRT1 may be a central modulator of cellular processes that require energy such as fatty acid synthesis, protein synthesis and cell growth. If this is true, then over expression of SIRT1 could potentially result in a higher apoptotic threshold. 

SIRT1 might also act as a metabolic sensor, as a result of its NAD+ dependence. If it does, then this might present a linkage between energy consumption to a transcriptional program that modulates cellular responses to stress. SIRT1 deacetylation of transcriptional complexes typically results in diminished transcriptional activation after deacetylating specific transcription factors.

SIRT1 could serve as a scaffold that tethers various transcriptional complexes. SIRT1 also confers resistance to etoposide via DNA repair augmentation. As a result, the over expression of SIRT1 may shift the transcription-dependent response of cisplatin resistance away from cell and towards cell survival.

When regulated by glucose homeostasis, SIRT1 may contribute to tumor cell resistance to cisplatin. This provides insight that could facilitate the development of methods to subjugate drug resistance of cancer patients.

===Research on Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms===

Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs490683 and rs9819506) are associated with changes in body weight and body mass index (BMI), within the promoter region of the human growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR) gene. However, no evidence has been uncovered for the involvement of GHSR SNPs in body weight regulation. The SNPs rs490683 and rs9819506 are not unequivocally associated with measures of obesity or type 2 diabetes.
Rs490683 and rs509035 are in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) with each other. Researchers speculate that this explains why none of the GHSR polymorphisms are statistically significantly associated with risk of type 2 diabetes.
It is speculated that individuals with the rs490683-GG genotype, where the NF-1 protein half site is intact, are endowed with enhanced GHSR expression, which potentially leads to increased receptor signaling that ultimately causes an increase in appetite. Researchers have discovered that individuals with the rs490683-GG genotype lose less weight during lifestyle interventions than do individuals with the rs490683-CC genotype.
GHSR signals at approximately fifty percent activity, even when in the absence of an agonist, which implies that the control of the expression level of the receptor is directly correlated to signaling activity. GHSR expression in the hypothalamus increases, during prolonged fasting. This increased expression is suspected to contribute to the amplification of ghrelin action, which is expected to result in a ghrelin-independent increase in receptor signaling to produce an increase in appetite. The GHSR polymorphism rs490683 is proven to be associated with changes in body weight. For individuals that belong to the rs4906863-GG genotype, where the NF-1 site is intact, there is a supposed increase in ghrelin receptor expression.
The alleles of rs519384 did not show any differential protein binding. Therefore, this SNP is not a crucial region for GHSR gene expression.
	Polymorphisms in the GHSR gene are proven to be longitudinally associated with obesity and glucose metabolism. Genetic variation of the promoter potentially has an effect on appetite regulation via modulation of GHSR gene expression and ghrelin receptor signaling.

===Research on Oxysterols===

Examining the relationship between the concentrations of serum enzymatically and non-enzymatically generated oxysterols and measures of obesity, metabolic components that include insulin resistance, levels of blood pressure and serum lipids:
	Researchers have observed that oxysterol levels increase with increased measures of obesity that include body mass index (BMI) and WC, which is in further support of the already established associations between obesity and oxidative stress. Obesity and the metabolic syndrome result in an increase in CRP and atherosclerosis. These results are implicit of enhanced inflammatory stress and are associated with greater oxidative stress, and increased formation of oxysterols. Researchers hope that the relationship between adolescent obesity with greater oxidative stress in the form of oxysterols will be a relevant marker of adult cardiovascular risk, while monitoring obesity from childhood to adult life.
	Oxysterols act as modulators of insulin. Enzymatically produced oxysterols are established agonists of liver X receptors (LXRs), which are involved in enhanced insulin secretion, and the regulation of cholesterol metabolism. 7αOH is an enzymatically generated oxysterol. 7αOH has been observed to have a positive relationship with insulin, and is believed to have an impact on insulin secretion.
Oxysterols are present as early markers of oxidative stress-mediated deregulations that involve cholesterol metabolism. Oxysterol formation might serve as an important link between hypercholesterolemia and metabolic derangements that are present in the progression to vascular dysfunctions. As a result, oxysterols are capable of being a metabolic linkage to vascular risk factors that agglomerate during adolescence.

===Research on Hepatocytes===

Fatty livers are associated with insulin resistance, atherosclerosis and the metabolic syndrome. Fatty livers also predict future cardiovascular events. There is support that insulin resistance is a strong underlying mechanism for dyslipidemia that increases LDL particle density and lowers HDL-cholesterol. Researchers have also suggested that fat accumulation in the liver has an independent effect on this form of dyslipidemia.
	The liver is also involved in immune responses. Hepatocytes comprise of approximately two thirds of total liver cells, with biliary epithelial cells, sinusoidal cells, Kupffer cells, stellate cells, dendritic cells, and lymphocytes represent the other cell types. Kupffer cells and lymphocytes are the main cell types that are involved in hepatic immune responses. Kupffer cells represent the largest group of fixes macrophages in the body. They account for approximately twenty percent of nonparenchymal cells in the liver. Kupffer cells that are in the liver clear endotoxins (lipopolysaccharides) from the passing blood, phagocyte debris in microorganisms. Kupffer cells also produce cytokines, which have a significant role in cell differentiation and cell proliferation.
The gastrointestinal tract is thought to be crucial for hepatic inflammation and the pathophysiology of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).

===Research on Cardiac metabolism===

Histone deacetylase (HDAC)-3 is a prominent regulator of cardiac energy metabolism. Despite the high degree of homology among HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3, HDAC3 clearly has a significant role in the maintenance of cardiac function.
	Under basal conditions, HDAC3, together with the nuclear receptor corepressor/silencing mediator for retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptors (NCoR/SMRT) or the retinoblastoma (Rb) complex, is recruited by PPARs and other nuclear receptors to the promoters of target genes to facilitate the transcriptional repression by nuclear receptors. Mitochondrial derangements from the loss of HDAC3 in cardiomyocytes resemble those seen in diabetic cardiomyopathies. The increased oxidation of fatty acids that occurs in diabetic hearts causes enhanced reducing equivalents to the electron transport chain, which results in free radical production, mitochondrial uncoupling, and decreased cardiac efficiency.

===Research on Ketone bodies===

A low carbohydrate diet has been proven to be an effective treatment for severe pharmacoresistant therapy. In order to reveal any therapeutic applications of a ketogenic diet, researchers have tested for effects of physiological ketone bodies on neuronal firing rates and excitability. Spontaneous neuronal firing rates of neurons in slices of rat or mouse substantia nigra pars reticulata were reduced by physiological content of ketone bodies (ß-hydroxybutyrate or acetoacetate). This region is believed to control seizure generalization, by acting as a “seizure gate.” This ketone effect was amplified in larger cells that fired more rapidly. Ketone body effects were able to be eliminated via pharmacological extirpation or gene knock-out of KATP channels. Researchers suggest that epilepsy may be treatable by enhancing the natural activity-limiting function of KATP neuron channels by ketone bodies or glycolytic restriction.

Ketone bodies were discovered to reduce SNr neuron firing rates while requiring the presence of functional KATP channels and GABAB signaling. Researchers proposed that this requirement is a result from opening KATP channels, which inhibits GABAB of SNr neuron firing. KATP channels have also been reported to be activated by G-proteins and G-protein-coupled receptors. Specifically, KATP channels were discovered to be activated by GABAB¬ receptors in central neurons. This indicates that some degree of GABAB modulation is essential for determining the point at which these channels may be activated. It is speculated that this activation point may be triggered by direct G-protein modulation or phosphoinositide lipid level modulation.

During ketosis, ketone bodies are capable of partially or mostly replacing glucose functionality as a fuel source for the brain. Ketogenic diet studies in rodents revealed that the glycolytic pathway substrate levels were altered, when analyzing whole-brain extracts. Therefore, glycolysis modification was the identifiable difference between glucose and ketone body metabolism. Effective compartmentation of ATP molecules produced from glycolysis may potentially play a significant role in controlling and fuelling plasma membrane processes. Glycolytic enzymes are also believed to be closely associated with KATP channels that may support this ATP compartmentation.

Direct connections between levels of electrical activity and ATP consumption at the plasma membrane were observed. These connections allow for KATP channels to play an anticonvulsant role, and predict a correlation between the strength of ketone body effects and initial neuronal firing rates. It is proposed that a ketogenic diet may function as an epilepsy treatment by reducing glycolytic ATP production. This reduction is accomplished by lowering electrical activity levels needed to trigger this protective mechanism.
Pertinence of the glycolytic inhibition mechanism through a specific diet is supported by dietary therapy conducted on humans, known as the Low Glycemic Index Treatment. When adhering to a ketogenic diet, this treatment may potentially moderate or lower the rate of glycolysis.

===Research on Cardiolipin===

Cardiolipin (CL) has been discovered to be substantially depleted in diabetic myocardium six weeks after streptozotocin (STZ) injections. Accompanying this depletion was an increase in triacylglycerol content and changes in polar lipid molecular species. Left in a diabetic state for more than six weeks, the myocardium experienced complementary lipid indicators of diabetic cardiomyopathy. This made researchers incapable of identifying time-dependent diabetic myocardium lipid alterations. Recent advancements in shotgun lipidomics have allowed for the identification of abundant losses of CL molecules in STZ-treated hearts, during the early stages of diabetes. These early stages also indicated the remodeling of any remaining CL molecules. Specifically, there was a nigh 16-fold increase in 18:2-22:6-22:6-22:6 CL content. These metabolic CL modifications precede diabetic myocardial triacylglycerol accumulation, and occur within a few days of inducing a diabetic state. Identifiably, ''ob/ob'' mice exhibited a significant redistribution from 18:2 fatty acids (FA)-containing CL molecules to 22:6 FA-containing CL molecules. Altogether, these results illustrate the early diabetic CL remodeling and hydrolysis alterations congruous with CL content fluctuation within precipitating mitochondrial dysfunction, during diabetic cardiomyopathy.

Any alteration in the content or structure of CL molecules has been proven to affect the biophysical environment of mitochondrial membranes in a way that modified the potentials and activities of mitochondrial transmembrane enzymes. These modifications evidently altered the overall dynamics and bioenergetics of mitochondria. Inferentially, quantitative and qualitative CL changes are expected to contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction in diabetic hearts. These occurrences, however, did not necessitate any physical functional mitochondrial alterations, during early stages of diabetes.

A significant biomarker for diabetic cardiomyopathy was triacylglycerol (TG) accumulation. The identified quantitative and qualitative changes in CL content have been proven to inhibit mitochondrial function and, more specifically, to attenuate the mitochondria’s ability to remove any TG excess in diabetic hearts. This defect is believed to be onset by electron transport chain inefficiency as a result of nonphysiological CL content. This inefficiency is also thought to increase negative redox potential and reduce mitochondrial fatty acid  -oxidation flux.

===Research on analytical techniques===

Advancements in the field of metabolomics have furthered the research and understanding of disease states pertinent to metabolic pathways. Specifically, metabolomics information improves the capability of identifying drug off-target effects. The progression of metabolomics is largely a result of advancements in high-precision high-throughput mass spectrometry. As the field of metabolomics continues to develop, there is an apparent need to apply bioinformatics tools and methods. Researchers have systematically analyzed and quantified more than 800 metabolites in blood plasma samples of diabetic mice under rosiglitazone treatment. Metabolic phenotypes of diabetes and medication were proven to be capable of statistically objective recovery. Methylglutarylcarnitine content in healthy and diabetic mice were both oppositely impacted when treated with rosiglitazone. Metabolite concentration ratio analysis revealed new potential biomarkers of diabetes, which include N-hydroxyacyloylsphingosyl-phosphocholines SM(OH)28:0 and SM(OH)26:0. A hierarchical clustering technique on partial eta-squared values was employed to identify functionally related groups of metabolites that indicated shifts from lysophosphatidylcholines to phosphatidylcholines. These shifts implied diabetes disease states.

Researchers conducted bioinformatics analyses comprising of a standard experimental setting that included independent “state” and “medication” factors. Targeted quantitative metabolomics was employed, and covered a wide range of analytes. Researchers first focused on reproducing already identified metabolic effects of rosiglitazone on diabetes. This “medication” factor expectedly impacted non-esterified fatty acid metabolism and decresed long-chain acylcarnitine concentrations. The next experimental objective involved identifying new diabetes related compounds and/or pathways. The observed effects on this “state” factor indicated the presence of previously unidentified metabolites involved in experimental rosiglitazone treatment of diabetes. These groups of metabolites prominently consisted of glycero-phosphocholines and sphingomyelins, and were not observed during any single metabolite analysis. Researchers also made an effort to identify metabolites that might enhance the effects of rosiglitazone or provide a better understanding of diabetes and its effects on metabolic pathways and mechanisms. The detection of new metabolites, including glycero-phosphocholines, raises the possibility of interpreting the functionality of entire metabolite classes in disease states, and medicated disease states.

===Research on Metabolic Profiling of Ovarian Carcinoma===

Metabolic Profiling of Ovarian Carcinoma

Denkert C, Budczies J, Kind T, Weichert W, Tablack P, Sehouli J, Niesporek S, Koensgen D, Dietel M, Fiehn O (2006) GC-TOF based metabolic profiling reveals different metabolite patterns in invasive ovarian carcinomas and ovarian borderline tumors. Cancer Res. 66, 10795-10804


Summary:
In this study, the researchers determined that there are indeed several differences in metabolism between malignant ovarian carcinomas and borderline ovarian tumors.  They conducted gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry to identify metabolites in homogenized tumor samples, and then conducted several statistical analyses to prove that approximately 50 metabolites can be used as biomarkers to differentiate between malignant carcinomas and borderline tumors.  The researchers also discovered that the increased presence of nitrogen-donating amino acids and molecules important in protein synthesis in the malignant samples indicate a higher metabolic turnover rate, or increased cell replication.


Terms:
• metabolite profiling: determining the presence and amount of each metabolite in a sample

• principal component analysis (PCA): &quot;a technique used to reduce multidimensional data sets to lower dimensions for analysis&quot; (Wikipedia)

• differential regulation: comparison of metabolic regulation in two different systems or one system under two different circumstances

• flux: &quot;the rate of flow of energy or particles across a given surface&quot; (WordNet)

• permutation (in statistical analysis): &quot;rearrangement of the elements of a set&quot; (American Heritage Dictionary)


Relevance:
This study demonstrates that the presence of certain metabolites can determine the malignancy of aberrant tumor cells in ovarian tissue.  One noted change was an increase in metabolites involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), which indicates an increased need for energy by malignant tumor cells.  This is similar to what we discussed in class about the fed and starved states regulating the glycolysis and gluconeogenesis cycles, with respect to the concentration of chemical energy (ATP). 


===Research on Dynamics of the Cellular Metabolome during Human Cytomegalovirus Infection===


Dynamics of the Cellular Metabolome during Human Cytomegalovirus Infection

http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&amp;artid=1698944&amp;blobtype=pdf


Summary:
When a human cell is infected with cytomegalovirus (HCMV), what happens to the metabolic components in the glycolysis pathway, tricarboxylic acid cycle and pyrimidine biosynthesis? This was answered by the use of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, hydrophilic interaction and selected reaction monitoring. 63 different metabolites were tested for their levels in a cultured (vitro) fibroblast that was infected with Human Cytomegalovirus. The results of the experiment were that the levels of the metabolites were higher in the infected cells than the noninfected cells, thus the infection changes metabolic homeostasis.


Terms:
Metabolic flux- The rate that metabolites flow thru a metabolic pathway.

Biopolymers- Produced by living organism examples starch, proteins, peptides, DNA and RNA

Glycolysis- The breaking of a glucose molecule, thru a series of enzymes and products to produce two pyruvate molecules and four ATP.

Tricarboxylic acid cycle- A metabolic pathway in aerobic organisms that uses carbohydrates, fats and proteins and converts them to carbon dioxide, water and energy.

Pyrimidine pathway- The making of pyrimidine nucleotides examples thymine, uracil and cytosine in DNA and RNA.

Hydrophilic interaction chromatography- A tool used to separate compounds by hydrophobicity.

Selected Reaction Monitoring scan event- (SRM) A tool in which a specific product ion is detected, by its specific mass fragment.


Relevance:
This paper tested the metabolites in the glycolysis pathway. They found a increase in hexose phosphate, FBP, DHAP, 3-P glycerate and PEP when a cell is infected with the Human Cytomegalovirus compared to a mock-infected cell. The paper also talked about the different ways a metabolite level can change or a change in flux.


===Research on Effect of Phenylalanine Metabolites on the Activities of Enzymes of Ketone-Bodies===

Effect of Phenylalanine Metabolites on the Activities of Enzymes of Ketone-Body Utilization in Brain of Suckling Rats
http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=1164225&amp;blobtype=pdf

Summary:
The main focus of this resource is to identify why people with defects in their phenylketonuria develop brain abnormalities. Phenylketonuria is caused by a deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase enzyme. Phenylalanine and its derivatives build up to toxic levels in the body and interfere with other pathways since they cannot be converted to tyrosine fast enough or at all. If the harmful metabolites are detected it may be possible to treat phenylketonuria in another way other than the current treatment of a low phenylalanine diet.


Terms: 
extrahepatic- outside of, or unrelated to the liver (http://cancerweb.ncl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/omd?extrahepatic)

thiolysis- is a reaction with a thiol (R-SH) that cleaves one compound into two. This reaction is similar to hydrolysis, which involves water instead of a thiol. This reaction is seen in β-oxidation of fatty acids. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiolysis)

acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase- (also called thiolase II) is specific for the thiolysis of acetoacetyl-CoA and involved in biosynthetic pathways such as poly -hydroxybutyrate synthesis or steroid biogenesis. (https://bioinformatics.ccr.buffalo.edu/cgi-bin/software/pfam/getdesc?name=Thiolase_N)

3-oxo acid CoA-transferase- An enzyme catalyzing the reversible conversion of acetoacetyl-CoA and succinate into succinyl-CoA and acetoacetate; malonyl-CoA can substitute for succinyl-CoA and a few other 3-oxo acids for the acetoacetate; an important step in order for the ketone bodies to serve as a fuel for extrahepatic tissues.  (http://cancerweb.ncl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/omd?3-oxoacid-CoA+transferase)

3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase- Catalysis of the reaction: (R)-3-hydroxybutanoate + NAD+ = acetoacetate + NADH + H+ (http://www.reactome.org/cgi-bin/eventbrowser?DB=gk_current&amp;FOCUS_SPECIES=Gallus%20gallus&amp;ID=11646&amp;)
Citrate synthase- The enzyme citrate synthase exists in nearly all living cells and stands as a pace-making enzyme in the first step of the Citric Acid Cyle (or Krebs Cycle). Citrate synthase catalyzes the condensation reaction of the two-carbon acetate residue from acetyl coenzyme A and a molecule of four-carbon oxaloacetate to form the six-carbon citrate.  (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citrate_synthase) 


Relevance:
The research done by this group used the Lineweaver-Burke Plot to determine the effects of phenylpyruvate, phenylacetate, and o-hydroxyphenylacetate (all phenylalanine metabolites) on 3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase. The plots show that they work as inhibitors. Lineweaver-Burke plots were also used to detect how phenylalanine and its metabolites affect Acetoacteyl-CoA thiolase activity. They found from these plots that phenylpyruvate is the only strong inhibitor out of the phenylalanine metabolites. Phenylpyruvate has been shown to competitively inhibit citrate synthase activity which we learned means that it must somehow bind to the active site of the enzyme and block the intended substrate from getting to it. The Lineweaver-Burke plots demonstrate this by the increased slope (Km/Vmax) when phenylalanine is added. Apparently, hexokinase is also inhibited by phenylpyruvate which would mean that glucose would not be able to be converted to glucose-6-phosphate and there could be problems with completing the glycolysis pathway. Pyruvate carboxylase is also inhibited by phenylpyruvate which means that gluconeogenesis would have difficulty occurring since Pyruvate would not be able to be converted to oxaloacetate. Phosphogluconate dehydrogenase is another enzyme inhibited by phenylpyruvate which would mean that the pentose phosphate pathway would be inhibited also since 6-phosogluconate wouldn’t be as readily converted to d-ribulose 5-phosphate. Even though we have not talked about acetyl-CoA carboxylase yet in class, one of the components of it is biotin, which we learned is a cofactor in gluconeogenesis and is also a cofactor for this enzyme. The general idea is similar to Box10-2 which talks about diseases resulting from lipid accumulations except Phenylketonuria is a disease from accumulations of amino acids.

===Research on Environmental Metabolomics===


Environmental Metabolomics

http://www.actionbioscience.org/genomic/viant.html


Summary:
This particular resource is an article dealing with Environmental Metabolomics as applied to the events of disease and toxicity in wildlife. It gives a general description of Metabolomics as a whole but goes more deeply into several investigations regarding specific organisms and their diseases. The overview covers the applications of Metabolomics to human concerns intially, discussing the detection of coronary heart disease using NMR metabolomics, the prediction of subarachnoid hemorrages by analysis of cerebral spinal fluid, and sample classification methods for progressive neurological disease.


The article discussed the basics of Metabolomics in terms of disease diagnosis and monitoring. It discussed how Metabolomics uses Bioinformatics to manage the sheer volumes of metabolic information gleaned in this system of study and how the tools of the trade tend more towards chemistry concerns. It especially went over the advantages of metabolomics for disease diagnosis because it works on phenotype and the effects of disease and toxicity on phenotype are readily apparent.
The main focus for Environmental Metabolomics is disease and toxicity occurrence and formation in various forms of wildlife. The article used several examples to show the uses that Metabolomics has in this area. It discussed the identification of cancer in Marine Catfish, chemical risk assessment methods in sentinel species of fish, mammels and especially earthworms and to monitor withering disease in the Californian Red Abalone. It also made it clear that further developments and applications are inevitable as this field expands itself.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis - A progressive neurological disease in which loss of motor nerve cells in the spine and brain produces muscle paralysis and eventually death. Often referred to as &quot;Lou Gehrig's disease&quot;.

Aquaculture - The growing and harvesting of marine life for food or other purposes.

Withering syndrome - A disease that infects several species of abalone (a common shellfish) through infection in the epithelium of the intestinal tract by an intracellular prokaryote, with morphological characteristics of the class Proteobacteria, order Rickettsiales and family Rickettsiaceae. A new genus and species has been suggested for this organism (Candidatus Xenohaliotis californiensis). The disease causes lethargy, atrophy of the foot muscle, retraction of visceral muscles and eventual death.


Relevance:
We discussed the effects of certain metabolites being denied the cell and also how different conditions effect the workings of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis in terms of regulation. This article ties into this since diseases and toxic compounds can impact the regulation of many metabolic pathways and sometimes involve the denial of certain metabolites for a pathway.


===Research on regulation of central metabolic pathways in a fungal pathogen===


Niche-specific regulation of central metabolic pathways in a fungal pathogen 

(http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?&amp;pubmedid=16681837)


Summary:
The focus of this article is on how Candida albicans adjusts its metabolic pathways in relation to carbon at different stages of a systemic infection to maintain paradox.  The inspiration for this study was the paradox of how the glyoxylate cycle, known to be required for Candida albicans virulence, could be used during bloodstream infections when glyoxylate cycle genes are repressed by the glucose levels in blood.  The answer was found to be the adaptability of metabolic pathways in Candida albicans; glyoxylate and gluconeogenesis are actually upregulated as the organism is phagocytosed by neutrophils and macrophages and downregulated in favor of glycolysis at other stages.



Terms:
-The glyoxylate pathway occurs in only a few vertabrates and is much more common in plants and microorganisms, such as candida albicans.  It allows the sysnthesis of carbohydrates from fats.

-Candida albicans is a common diploid fungus that is rarely harmful to humans except in cases of immunocompromised patients, where it can cause dangerous and even fatal systemic infections.

-Candidiasis is a clinical term for a fungal infection of Candida species.  Candida albicans are a part of normal flora for humans that can sometimes result in superficial skin, oral, and vaginal infections.

-Candidemia is a more severe, systemic infection of Candida that is often found in HIV and transplant patients.  It can spread through the bloodstream and infect the kidneys with fatal consequences if left untreated.

-PCK1 is a key control gene that regulates gluconeogenesis.  In the study, its expression was monitored to determine at what points of infection candida albicans was relying on gluconeogenesis.



Relevance:
The information in this article related to what we've studied in the course to date because it was a practical examination of how pathways are used in vivo.  It also gives an indication of the depth of detail involved in metabolomics.  Even a relatively simple organism like Candida albicans has to undergo a complex shift in metabolic pathways to survive and thrive within an animal host. 


===Research on Human Serum Metabolite in Health and Disease===


Human Serum Metabolite in Health and Disease

http://www.husermet.org/


Summary:
The main aim of this study is to establish 'baseline' ranges of metabolites in human serum that are caused by such 'disease-independent' factors such as age, gender, lifestyle diet etc.  These baselines from numerous healthy individuals would then be compared to metabolite values from patients in an attempt to determine whether metabolite values can be used as a prediction tool for disease as well as possibly monitor patient response to treatment.  The two main diseases being focused on are Alzheimer's Disease and Ovarian cancer.


Terms:

Metabolite - A substance necessary for or taking part in a particular metabolic process.

Biomarker – A specific physical trait used to measure or indicate the effects or progress of a disease or condition

Metabolome – The complete set of small-molecule metabolites to be found within a biological sample

Pathophysiology - the functional changes associated with a disease.

Transcriptome – The complete set of al mRNA molecules produced by a cell.

FTICR – Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry. This is a type of mass spectrometer for determining the mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of ions based on the cyclotron frequency of the ions in a fixed magnetic field.


Relevance:
This research relates to our brief class discussion on using a patient's metabolic profile as a tool in the diagnosis of disease, as well as prediction/monitoring of the effectiveness of drugs given to the patient.  Analysis of a patient's metabolic profile can be utilised as an additional diagnostic tool, especially when other clinical symptoms are conflicting or not apparent.  For example, the clinical distinction between Alzheimer's disease and normal age-related memory-loss is tenuous and subjective – identification of a metabolite unique to Alzheimer's disease would prove to be valuable in early diagnosis and treatment.

===Research on Mitochondrial Disorders Using Intracellular ATP Reporters===


New Insights into the Bioenergetics of Mitochondrial Disorders Using Intracellular ATP Reporters
http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&amp;artid=196555

Summary:
In this paper, the scientists are trying to see if ATP is compartmentalized within cells and different pools of ATP sustain different cell functions. They also wanted to see, more specifically which cell compartments are more depleted of ATP and if certain ATP dependent functions are affected differently in mitochondrial diseases. To show this, the experiment used wild-type firefly luciferase and made chimeric constructs with the required mutations which were then inserted into human cell lines using a mammalian expression vector pCDNA3.0.  The results showed that the ATP levels decreased markedly in the mutant forms under oxidative conditions suggesting that ATP is transported from the mitochondria to other energy extensive compartments even under mitochondrial OXPHOS. 

Terms:

Luciferase – It is the generic name for enzymes used in nature for bioluminescence. 

Phosphocreatine – A phosphorylated creatine molecule that is an important energy store in the skeletal muscle. 

Lactic acidosis – It is a condition caused by the buildup of lactic acid in the body and leads to acidification of the blood.

Osteosarcoma – It is the most common type if malignant bone cancer. 

Retinitis pigmentosa – Consists of a group of inherited disorders in which abnormalities of the photoreceptors or the retinal pigment epithelium of the retina lead to progressive visual loss. 

Relevance:
The article relates to what we have been doing in class because it deals with the production of energy, ATP. Here we see how mutations in the mitochondria affect the production of ATP in the different cellular compartments. Also it shows that there is indeed a different concentration of ATP in the different cellular organelles.

====Summary====
Crohn's Disease is an inflammatory bowel disease caused by a dysbiosis of intestinal microbes.  Its etiology is largely unknown, but its main symptom is chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract.  Examining fecal extracts of test subjects has revealed that several metabolites, when present in the feces, are indicative of Crohn's Disease.  A cohort study using 15 twins was done in this experiment.  The sample cohort contained 7 healthy twin pairs, 4 pairs that were discordant for predominantly colinic Crohnís Disease (CCD), 2 pairs discordant for predominantly ileal Crohn's Disease (ICD), and 2 pairs that were concordant for ICD.  Fecal samples from the subjects were collected, diluted and examined for metabolites using FT-ICR-MS analysis.  The partial least squares (PLS) analysis used to examine the data from this experiment showed a clear difference among the metabolites in the feces of people with ICD, people with CCD, and healthy people.  The data from this PLS analysis was the first to show a distinction between metabolites of healthy people and those who have Crohn's Disease, proving that metabolomics can be used as a method of accurately diagnosing Crohn's Disease.  Metabolites from a wide range of pathways differentiated healthy from diseased individuals.  A complete list of these metabolites is shown in Table 1 of the article. The presence of metabolites relating to tyrosine metabolism was of particular interest to the scientists because this confirms previous reports of increased transcripts of genes involved in tyrosine metabolism in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in patients with Crohn's Disease.  The amino acids tryptophan and phenylalanine in the feces indicated that the individual had ICD.  Because one subject with ICD interestingly had low tryptophan and phenylalanine levels in his/her feces and also had low E. coli levels in the gut, an interesting follow up study would be to look for links between E. coli abundance and amino acid levels in the gut.  Also, it was found that several masses corresponding to metabolites within the bile acid biosynthesis pathway could be used to distinguish between the disease phenotypes.  For example, masses corresponding to both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids were more prevalent in patients with ICD compared to the other two groups.  The fact that arachidonic acid levels are high in colinic mucosa of patients is interesting because arachidonic acid is an inflammatory mediator and can attract leukcytes.  This provides an explanation for the colinic inflammation that CD patients experience, and also offers a possible means of alleviating the negative symptoms of CD in patients.  In general, bacteria that were more abundant in people with ICD were those that were associated with bile acids, and bacteria that were more abundant in individuals with healthy or CCD phenotypes corresponded more with phospholipids and flavin mononucleotides.  This study introduces some exciting results that could likely lead to effective, non-invasive methods of detecting and monitoring Crohn's Disease, thus improving the quality of care received by those who suffer from the disease.

=='''Introduction'''==

===Milk===


Nutritional intake is essential for optimizing sport and exercise performance. Proper nutrition is also crucial for optimizing adaptations to training. The timing of nutritional intake is an important factor for optimizing the adaptations to any form of exercise, as well as having an important role in the recovery period after both resistance and endurance exercise. 

Bovine milk products represent substantial sources of proteins, lipids, amino acids, vitamins and minerals. Low-fat milk has a number of characteristics to indicate that it is a significant recovery beverage. It contains carbohydrates in the form of lactose, casein and whey protein in a ratio that allows for slow protein absorption and sustained blood amino acid concentrations and a high concentration of electrolytes that aid in fluid recovery.

There is still developing evidence that supports the advantageous nature of consuming low-fat milk after exercise, especially for athletes who adhere to strength or endurance training regimens. The fat from free milk has proven to be as effective as, and in some cases more effective than, commercially available sports drinks when implemented to promote the recovery process after strength and endurance exercise. Milk also provides additional nutrients and vitamins that aid this recovery process and are not found in commercial sports drinks. It is in support of these details that milk has been proven to be an effective post-exercise beverage and an alternative to commercial sports drinks for lactose tolerant individuals.

===Vitamin C===

Polymorphisms are involved with the xenobiotic metabolizing enzyme, GSTP1-1, in vitamin C (C) and urinary C excretion. This highlights the requirement to consider gene polymorphisms when determining the C requirements of individuals.

C intake into the blood and C excretion into the urine both occur rapidly after the oral loading of DAsA. While there may be large individual differences in the levels of C excretion, blood C levels are maintained within a relatively narrow range due to homeostasis.

Enhanced C intake is necessary for individuals that smoke. This allows smokers to maintain an in vivo C storage that is equivalent to non-smokers. This suggests that polymorphisms in enzymes that relate to xenobiotic metabolism might be related to the individual differences in urinary C excretion.

Researchers believe that it is unlikely that individual differences in C metabolism are explained solely by polymorphisms of GSTP1-1. The polymorphisms of other genes and lifestyle factors are necessary to include when considering individual C requirements and deficits. In order to further understand the variations in individual C metabolisms, investigations of the association with other polymorphisms and long-term loading experiments that involve the ingestion of DAsA are currently being performed.

===Cheonggukjang===

The cheonggukjang supplement leads to increased mRNA expressions of enzymes and protein that are involved in the fatty acid oxidation that occurs in the liver. As a result, this supplement reduces the accumulation of body fat and improves the serum lipids in high fat diets that have been fed to mice.

High fat diets are known to lead to overall increased body weight, energy intake and efficiency of energy storage. Cheonggukjang supplementation is expected to control the frequency of coronary heart diseases that develop as a result of poor eating habits. In turn, this should encourage the avoidance of diets that are high in fat and low in cholesterol.

Changes in the expression levels of hepatic acyl-CoA synthase (ACS) may modulate metabolic fluctuations of acyl-CoA in tissues that use fatty acids in order to generate and store energy. Cheonggukjang supplementation results in higher levels of hepatic ACS mRNA levels than those who eat normal or high fat diets.

Increased fatty acid availability with cheonggukjang supplementation induces an increased expression of hepatic carnitine palmitoyltransferase-I (CPT-I) mRNA.

Cheonggukjang supplementation up-regulates uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) mRNA. This action may consist of cellular ATP levels and decreased metabolic efficiency. This would be in support of the resultant decrease in fat accumulation.

Cheonggukjang supplementation has evident beneficial effects on weight gain, epididymal and back fat mass, lipid profiles of serum and liver in high fat diets that are fed to mice. Cheonggukjang supplementation enhances fatty acid beta-oxidation, in the liver. These effects are believed to be attributed to cheonggukjang modulating transcriptional levels of proteins and enzymes that are associated with lipid metabolism.

===Personalized Medicine===

Metabolomics: Working Toward Personalized Medicine

http://www.fda.gov/fdac/features/2005/605_metabolomics.html


Summary:

This article is sort of introducing the concept of metabolomics and its possible potentials in modern medicine to the general public.  The article goes into a simplified explanation of how metabolomics came about (from the human genome project) and how exactly it relates to proteomics and genomics and details about techniques used by scientists to conduct research in this area.  Currently, scientists are monitoring concentrations of metabolites in human fluid samples and are trying to figure out what the changes in metabolic profiles mean so that they can develop pharmaceuticals that are best suited for each individual person.  This will save cost (if it prevents the development of an unsuccessful drug) and possibly many people’s health – as studies have shown that people who have negative reactions to certain medicines most often develop liver problems.


Definitions: 

Metabolomics – the systematic study of the unique chemical fingerprints that specific cellular processes leave behind

Metabonomics - the quantitative measurement of the dynamic multiparametric metabolic response of living systems to pathophysiological stimuli or genetic modification

Toxicology – the study of adverse effects of chemicals on living organisms: symptoms, mechanisms, treatments and poisonings – especially among people

Metabolite – a product of a metabolic process (including intermediates)

NHGRI – National Human Genome Research Institute – a division of the National Institutes of Health, located in Bethesday, Maryland

Metabolome – the complete set of small molecule metabolites to be found within a living organism


Relevance:

This article relates to what we’ve learned up till now by providing a supplemental resource and real world applications.  In class we’ve learned a few of the metabolic pathways and are presently learning some ways in which these pathways are regulated, but this article explains how the study of these pathways and specifically their concentrations of products and intermediates is useful in sort of genetically personalizing medicine – reducing the risk of side effects or injury and possibly enhancing the medicine’s effectiveness.


===FDA===


Resource:  http://www.fda.gov/fdac/features/2005/605_metabolomics.html


Summary:

The main purpose of this website it to educate people about metabolomics, its potential benefits, and challenges that may be faced.  It also explains the FDA’s role in metabolomics.  As new drugs are being produced and tested using metabolomics, the FDA will need a new way of evaluating the data that comes in with the promise of a new drug.  There must be a great understanding of this process if a drug, tested using metabolomics, is to be introduced into the general public.


Terms:

Metabolomics - study of all the molecules derived from metabolism in a living organism.

Biomarkers - substances used as indicators of a biologic state

NMR - nuclear magnetic resonance

MS - mass spectrometry

NCTR - National Center for Toxicological Research


Relevance:

In class, we have been learning about several metabolic pathways and the products they produce.  Some of these metabolites are excreted from the body in urine, sweat, or pus.  The focus of metabolomics is to look at the different metabolites secreted, such as glucose, and use the knowledge of how the pathway works to determine if the body is functioning properly.  For example, if there is excess glucose in the urine it could mean that the person is a risk for diabetes.


===Selegiline===

Selegiline (L-deprenyl) is a mechanism-based inactivator of CYP2A6 inhibiting nicotine metabolism in humans and mice

http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/cgi/reprint/jpet.107.133900v1


Summary:

The other article I used was a study of the effects that Selegiline and its metabolites has on nicotine metabolism. In this article, the researchers took a look at Selegiline (L-deprenyl), which is (as of December 7, 2007) in clinical studies as a potential smoking cessation drug. In mice, Selegiline is found to be a potent nicotine inhibitor in hepatic microsomes, and its several metabolites were also found to inhibit nicotine metabolism.  Hepatic microsomes were used because the liver is where nicotine is metabolized in the body, thus the effects in vitro would be similar. The study was also done in vitro with human hepatic microsomes. It appears that Selegiline is even more effective in humans than in rats because it acts both a competitive and mechanism-based inhibitor. When nicotine enters the body it binds to CNS type nicotinic receptors, which then increase dopamine levels. Selegiline in turn works as a dopamine inhibitor.

Terms:

Microsome: a small vesicle that is derived from fragmented smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) produced when tissues such as liver are mechanically broken

Metabolite: are the intermediates and products of metabolism, or the everyday chemical reactions that keep an organism alive, in this case the desmethylselegiline and L-methamphetamine that Selegiline is metabolized into.

Dopamine: a hormone and neurotransmitter that raises blood pressure and heart rate, and is also associated with the “pleasure system” of the brain. 

Selegiline: a drug known more commonly by its several brand names (l-deprenyl, Eldepryl or Anipryl), that is used to treat early-stage Parkinsons and senile dementia. In normal clinical doses it is a selective irreversible MAO-B inhibitor, however in larger doses (&gt;20 mg in a typical adult) it loses its specificity and also inhibits MAO-A.

Competitive Inhibitor: is a form of enzyme inhibition where binding of the inhibitor to the enzyme prevents binding of the substrate and vice versa.

Mechanism-based inhibitor: A competitive inhibitor that is converted to an irreversible inhibitor at the active site of the enzyme. (suicide inhibitor)


Relevance:

This article touches upon the various types of inhibitors that can block enzyme action that we learned about in Biochem: Conformation and Dynamics, as well as looking at how various molecules are metabolized into more useful molecules that the body can use. 


===Drug Development===


Agilent Pharmaceuticals

http://www.chem.agilent.com/cag/Pharmanews/Pharma19/newsletter.asp?page=PN_19_F5_metabolomics.html


Summary:

The main focus of this resource is the use of metabolomics in drug development. Metabolomics can be used to eliminate the drugs that will be toxic to humans. The source also gives analytical tools to use in the identification of metabolites. 

Terms:

Metabolomics- To characterize small molecules of any product of metabolism.

Metabolome- In one organism the complete set of small molecules that metabolism will produce.

Nuclear Magnetic resonance- A tool used to distinquish molecules based on their nucleus spin. 

Mass Spectrometry- A tool used to measure mass to charge ratio of ions (m/z). It can be used to measure molecular weight, monitor enzyme reactions, amino acid sequencing and protein structure. 

Gas Chromatography- Separates chemicals based on their volatility or how easy they evaporate into gas.

Liquid Chromatography- Separates chemical or the interactions between what is being analyzed and the chromatography column.


Relevance:

Knowing the biological and chemical process of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. This leads to a better and rapid drug development by the characterization of the metabolites that these two pathways create.


===Capsacin===


In Vitro Hepatic and Skin Metabolism of Capsaicin

http://dmd.aspetjournals.org/cgi/reprint/dmd.107.019240v1


Summary:

The focus of this resource was to determine how and where the body metabolizes pure capsaicin as well as the main metabolites created during the process. The study was conducted in in vitro in human skin cells and liver cells. To compare their results, rat and dog cells were also used. The study contributed to our understanding of why capsaicin is effective as a pain treatment both topically and internally.


Terms:

Microsomes-A microsome is a small vesicle that is derived from fragmented endoplasmic reticulum (ER) produced when tissues such as liver are mechanically broken (homogenized). Microsomes contain the cell's cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, involved in oxidative metabolism.

Metabolite-A substance, by-product, waste product, or endotoxin produced as the result of metabolism.

Biotransformation-The chemical conversion of substances by living organisms or enzyme preparations.

Agonist-Any molecule that improves the activity of a different molecule

Nociceptors-Nerve endings which detect and respond to painful or unpleasant stimuli.

Moiety-When referring to a molecule, a 'moiety' is a part or section of the whole.


Relevance:

This was relevant to class material because it demonstrated how different areas of the body metabolize products differently. It showed the difference between how the skin breaks down capsaicin versus how the liver utilizes the substance. It also determined/confirmed that the liver was more effective at breaking down capsaicin than was the skin.

Relevance:

Every pathway that we have talked about has enzymes, cofactors, substrates, intermediates, and products. We have studied glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and the pentose phosphate pathway and we have looked at the factors that activate and inactivate certain enzymes. As a result, since we have an idea and understanding of how the pathways work, we are able to create better foods, drugs, and agricultural chemicals that target improving health. Metabolomics has to do with metabolism so if we understand metabolism we are able to provide and figure out how to improve health sanctions and find cures for diseases. If understand the metabolite data and the metabolites function in the metabolism pathway it is easier to develop remedies to health problems.

'''Peer-Reviewed Article #1:'''  Vinnie Snow

[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2614284/?tool=pubmed Systems biology and functional genomics approaches for the identification of cellular responses to drug toxicity]

'''Expert Opin Drug Metab Toxicol. 2008 November; 4(11): 1379–1389. '&quot;

====Main Focus====
;:The main focus is to develop sensitive biomarkers in order to predict drug toxicity using genomic information as well as other types of omics datasets. These datasets can then be used to better understand the toxicity mechanisms of a particular biological system such as toxicity in humans.

====New Terms====
;Toxicogenomics:  a field of science that deals with the collection, interpretation, and storage of information about gene and protein activity within a particular cell or tissue in an organism in response to toxic substances. (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicogenomics)
;Toxicogenetics:  The study of genetic influences on the responses of organisms to toxins. (source: http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/toxicogenetics)
;Xenobiotics:  a chemical which is found in an organism but which is not normally produced or expected to be present in it. Typically drugs such as antibiotics. (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenobiotic)
;Transcriptomics:  The study of the transcriptome, the complete set of RNA transripts produced by the genome at any one time. (source: http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=23518)
;Pharmacogenomics: is the branch of pharmacology which deals with the influence of genetic variation on drug response in patients by correlating gene expression or single-nucleotide polymorphisms with a drug's efficacy or toxicity. (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacogenomics)

====Summary====
;:This paper takes into account that testing toxicity of particular drugs on a human can be complicated. The in vivo systems are typically a rodent vector and the results don't completely correlate with that of the human body. Another method uses is human tissue culture, in vitro, in which you can learn more about specific cells but not the human body as a whole and tissues react differently in an in vitro system than they do in an in vivo system. The purpose of using toxicogenomics is to identify gene expression patterns that indicate an adverse health effect at low doses. The modern technique used to measure functional genomics is to use transcriptomic assays by microarray technology. The microarrays used enable high-throughput screening of chemicals for potential toxicity. The results are analyzed from both in vivo and in vitro systems and are coupled with data-rich output in order to build more life-like results of what would actually happen in a human system. This type of research has successfully led to important regulatory action by the FDA that allows many drugs to remain on the market due to genetic testing. This is important to both the pharmaceutical companies and the potential patients that the drugs can help.  The information on genetic polymorphisms which are available through the Human Genome project has led to an major increase in research being done on genetic variation that relates to toxicity and pharmacologic phenotypes. The majority of the current research focuses on the relationship between phenotype(disease) and single nucleotide polymorphisms. So far there have been a number of publications that have shown a significant association between SNPs and disease phenotype(s). There have been few publications that have been validated that refute the original conclusion which suggests that this is a reliable method of testing toxicity.

====Relevance to a Traditional Metabolism Course====
;:This article relates to a traditional metabolism course in that the techniques being used evaluate the multiple pathways of metabolism as it relates to a human and in some cases rodent systems. The research uses toxicogenomics as well other omics coupled with microarrays in order to determine if a particular drug has any toxicity on a human system. The gene expression from the microarrays was used in concert with proteomic and metabolomic data which allows us to see the comprehensive picture of cellular responses when a particular drug is administered. The newer technology that is being used is the use of microarrays and the human genome project in order to see the effect on particular genes and pathways.</text>

='''Lipidomics'''=

Lipid functionality in cells extends to, but is not limited to, maintaining electrochemical gradients, subcellular partitioning, first- and second-messenger cell signaling, energy storage, protein trafficking and membrane anchoring. Physiological importance of lipids is evident when considering or observing lipid abnormalities, such as atherosclerosis, diabetes, obesity and Alzheimer's disease. Lipidomics &quot;is a systems-based study of all lipids, the molecules with which they interact, and their function within a cell.&quot; The detection of various lipid species has been made more efficient with advances in soft-ionization mass spectrometry, combined with modern separation techniques. Lipid profiles are characterized as a mass spectrum of the composition and abundance of lipids contained from a crude lipid extract, and could be monitored over time and when responding to specific stimuli. Integrated with genomics, proteomics and metabolomics, lipidomics is expected to allow researchers to develop a better understanding of lipid functionality, in biological systems. In addition, researchers are expecting a better understanding on lipid-based disease mechanisms, for biomarker screening, and for monitoring pharmacologic therapy, as a result of lipidomic advances.

Systems biology signifies a vast impact on the future of disease treatment and prevention. The growing interest in the influence of lipids on systems biology owes largely to advances in mass spectrometry, which allow for detailed lipid profiles from minimal sample preparation. One of the developing groups involved in lipidome analysis, Lipid Metabolites and Pathways Strategy, is a consortium that has undertaken determining the complete lipidome of the mouse macrophage and its responses to a variety of stimuli, including oxidized lipids and lipopolysaccharides. Therapeutics are anticipated to advance with lipidomics as the effects of lipids on pathologic states, and influences that interfere with these effects become better understood. Integrating lipidomic data with genetic, proteomic, and metabolomic data proves to be a difficult endeavor, but will supposedly generate new modeling paradigms.

Researching differential meal fat uptake into adipose tissue depots was conducted to determine the impact of this uptake on body fat distribution. The meal fat tracer/adipose tissue biopsy approach was employed, in order to compare the effects of meal fat content on the fat uptake into visceral, upper body, and lower body subcutaneous fat depots. Fat content was monitored in premenopausal women subjects. In addition, Fatty acids intake, from normal-fat and high-fat meals, was traced with [3H]triolein.

Experimental results indicate that the proportion of dietary fat uptake into the three monitored depots was not different, between meals. Visceral fat accumulation accounted for approximately five percent of meal fat disposal, without respect to visceral fat mass. Subjects consuming normal-fat meals had an increase in meal fatty acid uptake into femoral fat, as a function of leg fat mass. This increase is identified as an increased efficiency of uptake. There was, however, an opposite pattern observed in the effects of normal-fat meals on omental fat, and high-fat meals on all monitored fat depots. Approximately forty percent of meal fat was oxidized, for both types of meals, after twenty-four hours.

Researchers concluded that greater thigh adipose tissue in women is directly associated with greater efficiency of meal fat storage, under specific energy balance conditions. However, an opposite trend was observed in visceral fat. These inferences indicate the possibility of different mechanisms that regulate fatty acid uptake, for different depots. Therefore, these differing mechanisms may also impact the distribution of body fat.

== '''Lipids In Energy Storage''' ==

'''Lipids''' are small water-insoluble biomolecules generally containing fatty acids, sterols, or isoprenoid compounds . There are a variety of lipids and each participates in different metabolism processes uniquely. Lipids are used as energy storage via fatty acids. Fatty acids are composed of carboxylic acids attached to long chains of hydrocarbons. These are carbons that can range from 4 to 36 carbons. Fatty acids can be saturated, monounsaturated or polyunsaturated depending on the number of double bonds attached at the hydrocarbon skeleton. For example, saturated Lauric (n-Dodecnoic) acid exists in the laurel plant has a 12 carbon skeleton (CH3(CH2)10COOH) with a 12:0 ratio of carbon to double bond on its hydrocarbon chain. 

[[Image:Triglyceride_ballandstick.GIF‎|right|thumb|250px|Ball &amp; stick model of Triglyceride]]

Unsaturated fatty acids such as Palmitoleic acid (cis-9-Hexadecenoic acid) and Oleic acid (cis-9-Octadecenic acid) has a single double bond between the 8 and 9 carbon on its hydrocarbon skeleton. Polyunsaturated fatty acids such as Arachidonic acid (cis-, cis-, cis-, cis-5,6,11,14- Icosatetraenoic acid) contained 4 double bonds on its hydrocarbon skeleton. 

The most common type of fatty acid that is use for energy storage is in form of neutral fats. Neutral fats are the simplest type of lipids and are formed by three ester linkages of hydrocarbons to a glycerol otherwise known as triacylglycerols. These fats made up common foods such as butter and olive oil.

These neutral fats are efficient source energy storage because it is fully reduced and can be stored anhydrously. When it is fully reduced, these fatty acids are full of electrons which participate in a process called beta-Oxidation to produce acetyl CoA which can then integrated into the glycolysis and Citric Acid Cycle to from energy in form of ATP.

'''COORDINATED REGULATION OF HORMONE-SENSITIVE LIPASE AND LIPOPROTEIN LIPASE IN HUMAN ADIPOSE TISSUE IN VIVO: IMPLICATIONS FOR THE CONTROL OF FAT STORAGE AND FAT MOBILIZATION.'''[[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6T3T-3YMWM01-D&amp;_user=47004&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000005018&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=47004&amp;md5=18f6433cf3cf963fb70f3fef8aae5e55]]

'''What is the main purpose of this article?''' 
This article implicates on the important of regulation in two different lipase enzymes for forming fatty acids.

'''Terms:'''

'''White adipocytes(White fat cells) -'''
Also known as Unilocular Cells contain a large lipid droplet surrounded by a ring of cytoplasm. These fats are stored is in a semi-liquid state, and is composed primarily of triglycerides and cholesterol ester.

Function: secrete resistin, adiponectin, and leptin.

'''Endothelium -'''
A layer of flat cells lining the closed internal spaces of the body such as the inside of blood vessels and lymphatic vessels (that convey the lymph, a milky fluid) and the heart.

'''Lipogenesis -'''
The process by which glucose is converted to fatty acids, which are subsequently esterified to glycerol to form the triacylglycerols that are packaged in VLDL and secreted from the liver.

'''Lipoproteins -'''
Any member of a group of substances containing both lipid (fat) and protein. The lipoproteins in blood plasma have been intensively studied because they are the mode of transport for cholesterol. (Online Encyclopedia Britannica) 

'''Non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) -'''
The fraction of plasma fatty acids not in the form of glycerol esters. In other words, it is free fatty acids floating in the blood.

'''How is this article related to what we’ve learned so far in Metabolism?'''
In our study of metabolism of fatty acids as an energy storage source, regulation and control of enzyme is crucial in the amount of energy making and energy storing. This article studied the regulation of Lipoprotein Lipase (LPL) and Hormone-Sensitive Lipase (HSL) regarding to fat deposition and mobilization of triacylglycerol in white fat cells . Control of LPL allows the activation and inactivation of fat storing and releasing in adipose tissues. Similarly the controls of HSL allow mobilization of fatty acids to other pathways for synthesis. From what we know about energy storage from fats, a fatty acid must first be activated in the cytosol in which it enters the mitochondria via carnitine shuttle. In the mitochondria, beta-oxidation of the fatty acid occurs to make acetyl coenzyme A for ATP synthesis. Insulin is also mentioned in the article as a regulator hormone. Insulin inhibits beta-oxidation in the mitochondria but allow the process of fatty acid synthesis to occur. When the body is in need of energy, or lack of glucose, the body induces Glucagon hormone to allow sugar synthesis by gluconeogenesis. The activation of Glucagon allow fatty acid to be activated in which can enter the mitochondria for acetyl CoA to be synthesize. The acetyl CoA in thus participates in ATP synthesis and storage.

'''What is the purpose of this article?''' 
Integration of Information: The important of beta-oxidation in avoiding biological disfunction. 

'''Terms:'''

'''Hepatotoxicity -'''
The damage of liver by chemical produced in the body.

'''Hepatocytes -'''
Majority of these cells are seen in the liver and mitochondria. These cells are involved in protein synthesis, protein storage and transformation of carbohydrates, synthesis of cholesterol, bile salts and phospholipids, and detoxification, modification and excretion of exogenous and endogenous substances.

'''Steatosis -''' 
The process describing the abnormal retention of lipids within a cell. It reflects an impairment of the normal processes of synthesis and breakdown of triglyceride fat.

'''Translocation -'''
The process of moving protein by a cell to other part of cell.

'''Ketogenesis -'''
The break down of fatty acid to form ketone bodies.

'''How is this article relate to what we’ve learned so far it Metabolism?'''
This article discusses the severity of internal biological damages that can occur if the fatty acid beta-oxidation is inhibited. As notes, beta-oxidation is crucial in the human because ATP metabolism by fatty acid yield most of the ATP in the body. In the body, triacylglycerol is broken down via beta-oxidation in the mitochondria to yield acetyl CoA, which can go into the Citric Acid Cycle to yield energy. Acetyl CoA is an important molecule in body, not only to yield ATP but allow for other processes such as the synthesis of ketone bodies for the heart. Inhibition of beta-oxidation can be acquired by genetics precursor or through drugs. These NEFA Diethylaminoethoxyhexestrol, perhexiline maleate and amiodarone are the common harmful drugs that postpone beta-oxidation in the body . These drugs are often used for coronary heart disease treatments. With beta-oxidation inhibited problematic consequences such as Microvesicular Steatosis, Mitochondrial Cytopathies, and various inborn errors arises. Pancreatic syndrome also occurs with such inhibition.


'''MEDIUM CHAIN FATTY ACID METABOLISM AND ENERGY EXPENDITURE: OBESITY TREATMENT IMPLICATIONS'''
[[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6T99-3SR34PK-1&amp;_user=47004&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000005018&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=47004&amp;md5=6dbb1f9813c4fd550f1743c6a288bd48]]

'''What is the purpose of this article?''' 
Compare and contrast energy storage and energy expenditure of medium chain fatty acids and long chain fatty acids metabolism.

'''Terms:'''

'''Long chain fatty acids -'''
Fatty acids that have 14 or more carbon attach.

'''Medium chain fatty acids -'''
Fatty acids that has 8-10 carbon.

'''Chylomicrons -'''
Large lipoprotein particles that are created in the small intestine. Chylomicrons transport fatty acid through the blood and to the mitochrondria. 

'''Thermogenesis -'''
The process of production of heat in an organism. 

'''Omega oxidation -'''
A process similar to beta-oxidation but the oxidation involves the  carbon from the carboxyl group of the fatty acid (wikipedia). 

'''Peroxisomal-oxidation -'''
The process of converting hydrogen peroxide to oxygen and water before it can decompose to form the highly reactive hydroxyl radical.

'''How is this article relate to what we’ve learned so far it Metabolism?'''
In this article, medium chain fatty acids of 8-10 carbon long increases activity of lipase and thus absorb to the intestine at a much faster rate than long chain fatty acids. Study indicated that medium chain fatty acids do not need a lipoprotein for transport but can transport straight to the mitochondria via portal circulation  for beta-oxidation. In this paper, other oxidative process such as omega-oxidation and peroxisomal-oxidation occurs in the liver. As seen before, long chain fatty acid need some sort of transport to other organ through the blood. Most often with long chain fatty acids, a carnitine shuttle is required to get the fatty acid into the mitochondria to do beta-oxdation. With medium chain fatty acids, a shuttle is not needed. Energy intake and stored from medium chain fatty acids metabolism is much more sufficient than long chain fatty acids. Appoximately 13% more energy intake compare to long chain fatty acids (Papamandjaris, Macdougall, Jones, p. 1209). We see than medium chain fatty acids metabolism is more efficient in which the intake and storing of energy is greater than that of long chain fatty acids. The

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{AM&amp;C-top|both=2|FUN=1}}
== Introduction ==

This section is concerned with copying assets, i.e. Trainz data files.

'''All copying of assets is potentially subject to copyright considerations''' but this chapter does not address that issue. Nor does it address the uploading of content so as to make it available to the general public on Auran's DLS system or a third-party Trainz fansite. Uploading is covered in a separate chapter of this book.

You may wish to copy assets in situations such as the following:
* You are upgrading to a new computer.
* You have two or more different versions of Trainz installed on the same computer.
* You have copies of Trainz installed on two or more computers.
* You wish to exchange assets with a small number of friends.

== Physical Copying Between Computers ==

Subject to the amount of data involved, all the normal ways of transferring files between computers can be used, such as:
{|
|-
|
* Floppy disks.
* USB memory sticks.
* Iomega Zip Disks.
|
* Portable USB hard disks.
* Writable CD's.
* Writable DVD's.
|
* Via local wired or wireless networks.
* As email attachments.
* Uploading to a private web space area, from where the recipient can download.
|}
== Some Fundamental Concepts ==

Most Trainz assets have dependencies excepting scenery items and with the advent of mesh and texture libraries, between 2010 &amp;mdash; 2014 the trend is that even former simple scenery items such as a basic house will likely have at least texture library references outside their own file folders, if not a mesh library since new assets built to v3.8 (iOS/Trainz MAC) are generating warnings when LODs are not used by content creators. A separate section of this book lists the {{TL|Hierarchy Of Assets|hierarchy of assets}} which applies to dependencies.

* Assets such as Driver sessions, scenarios often have a large number of dependencies and the ''list of dependencies in layouts ({{TL|Routes}})  often dwarves the large number of dependencies in sessions'' by a factor of ten or more, even in this post-2010 day with Sessions layers keeping much of what used to be in a Map in the session as a dependency.
 
* Rolling stock assets and basic industries often have a relatively low number of dependencies&amp;mdash;unless either involve a animation (Cabin doors and windows in a Loco, passenger car doors that open, Moving assembly line, conveyors, and forklift trucks etc.). 
===Getting dependencies together===
Assets will not work unless all their dependencies are present.
* So in TRS2004 and before, use Tafweb's TrainzObjectz to collect which assets are to be bundled.
* Post TRS2006-SP0 the easiest thing is to search dependencies for each session and route you mean to export. 


It is possible to copy assets in two fundamentally different ways:
* Copy the pre-installation distribution file(s). A distribution file is a file you download. On Auran's DLS system the distribution files are CDP files. On third-party Trainz fansites the distribution files can be in a variety of formats such as CDP, self-installing EXE, RAR compressed archives, or ZIP compressed archives. In general, a distribution file can contain any number of assets.
* Copy the post-installation files.

== Copying Pre-Installation Distribution Files ==

Distribution files can be copied between computers and installed on each. To install a CDP or EXE file, view it in Windows Explorer and double-click it. To install any other type of distribution file, refer to the instructions from the source of the file.

With Auran's DLS, by default the distribution CDP files are downloaded, run and deleted behind the scenes. This is the same concept as used by the Microsoft Update system. The distribution CDP files can be retained if they are downloaded using the FTP option, but then each asset must be downloaded separately; there is no automatic system to download dependencies with FTP.

With third-party Trainz fansites the situation varies but in most cases the default is to download the distribution files, hence retaining them naturally.

== Copying Post-Installation Files ==

;TRS2004 to TRS2004 - downloaded assets: Copy the relevant KUID folders in the C:\Program Files\Auran\TRS2004\World\Dispatcher\Downloads folder to the corresponding place on the destination computer. Then manually delete the C:\Program Files\Auran\TRS2004\Cache\world_cache_Dispatcher.chump file. It will usually be appropriate to only copy the top-level assets and then use the free third-party Trainz Objectz asset management program to list any missing dependencies.

;TRS2004 to TRS2004 - self-created assets: Either copy the relevant folders in the C:\Program Files\Auran\TRS2004\World\Custom folder to the corresponding place on the destination computer and then manually delete the C:\Program Files\Auran\TRS2004\Cache\world_cache_Dispatcher.chump file, or (and much more preferably) use the Content Dispatcher sub-program supplied with Trainz to convert them to CDP files, which can then be installed on the recipient's computer as if they had been downloaded.

;TRS2004 to TRS2006, to TC, to all other versions: best done via importing into other versions in a daisy chain, dealing with errors, then importing to the next higher version.

;TRS2006 to TRS2006: (not yet written)

;TRS2006 to TC: (not yet written; needs to include instructions for transferring those built-in assets which TC lacks)

;Any transfers from later versions to earlier versions (eg TRS2006 to TRS2004): (not yet written; is this needed?)

      <comment>/* Invalid XML Fragement */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You have a list of items that you want to display inside of a repeat loop.  You want some items to have different styling based on the content of items.

== Method ==
We will use the XForms '''group''' element to conditionally display an item inside of the repeat statement.

=== Sample XML Fragement ===
Assume your form has the following data in an instance:
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;my-nodes&gt;
   &lt;my-node&gt;
      &lt;element1&gt;true&lt;/element1&gt;
      &lt;element2&gt;Element2 Value&lt;/element2&gt;
   &lt;/my-node&gt;
   &lt;my-node&gt;
      &lt;element1&gt;false&lt;/element1&gt;
      &lt;element2&gt;Element2 Value&lt;/element2&gt;
   &lt;/my-node&gt;
   &lt;my-node&gt;
      &lt;element1&gt;true&lt;/element1&gt;
      &lt;element2&gt;Element2 Value&lt;/element2&gt;
   &lt;/my-node&gt;
&lt;/my-nodes&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Conditional Display of Items ===
The following text will only output '''element2''' when '''element1''' has a value of '''true'''.
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;xf:repeat nodeset=&quot;//my-node&quot;&gt;
   &lt;xf:group ref=&quot;.[element1='true']&quot;&gt;
      &lt;xf:output ref=&quot;element2&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;/xf:group&gt;
&lt;/xf:repeat&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

The syntax '''.[a='b']''' says that from the current node if the element '''a''' equals the value '''b''' then output the elements within the group.

=== Conditional Formatting of Items ===
This same strategy can be used to enclose output in different div or span elements.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;xf:repeat nodeset=&quot;my-node&quot;&gt;
   &lt;xf:group ref=&quot;.[element1='true']&quot;&gt;
      &lt;xf:output ref=&quot;element2&quot; class=&quot;strong&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;/xf:group&gt;
   &lt;xf:group ref=&quot;.[element1='false']&quot;&gt;
      &lt;xf:output ref=&quot;element2&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;/xf:group&gt;
&lt;/xf:repeat&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

In the above example all nodes with element1='true' will have a '''class=&quot;strong&quot;''' in the output and any element with '''element1='false'''' will not have the attribute in the output.

== Sample XForms Appliction ==

[http://xforms-examples.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/03-output/conditional-styling.xhtml Load XForms Application]

== Source Code ==
In this example we need to display a list of synonyms for a specific term. The Synonyms are all listed and a preferred term is displayed with a bold font.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;html
   xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;
   xmlns:ev=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events&quot;

   xmlns:xf=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2002/xforms&quot;&gt;
   &lt;head&gt;
       &lt;title&gt;Conditional Display&lt;/title&gt;
       &lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;
          @namespace xf url(&quot;http://www.w3.org/2002/xforms&quot;);
          body {font-family:Helvetica, sans-serif}
          .strong {font-weight:bold;}
          /* this puts everything under the repeat element into a single line */
          xf|repeat * {display:inline;}
       &lt;/style&gt;
       &lt;xf:model&gt;
          &lt;xf:instance xmlns=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;current-synset&quot;&gt;
            &lt;data&gt;
               &lt;synset-id&gt;3&lt;/synset-id&gt;
               &lt;synonym&gt;
                   &lt;preferred&gt;false&lt;/preferred&gt;
                   &lt;syn-name&gt;Boolean-Value&lt;/syn-name&gt;
               &lt;/synonym&gt;
                &lt;synonym&gt;
                   &lt;preferred&gt;false&lt;/preferred&gt;
                   &lt;syn-name&gt;Conditional-Value&lt;/syn-name&gt;
               &lt;/synonym&gt;
               &lt;synonym&gt;
                   &lt;preferred&gt;false&lt;/preferred&gt;
                   &lt;syn-name&gt;Flag&lt;/syn-name&gt;
               &lt;/synonym&gt;
                &lt;synonym&gt;
                   &lt;preferred&gt;true&lt;/preferred&gt;
                   &lt;syn-name&gt;Indicator&lt;/syn-name&gt;
               &lt;/synonym&gt;
                &lt;synonym&gt;
                   &lt;preferred&gt;false&lt;/preferred&gt;
                   &lt;syn-name&gt;Yes/No-Value&lt;/syn-name&gt;
               &lt;/synonym&gt;
            &lt;/data&gt;
          &lt;/xf:instance&gt;
       &lt;/xf:model&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
       &lt;h3&gt;Synonym Set&lt;/h3&gt;
       &lt;span&gt;(preferred term is bold)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
       &lt;xf:label&gt;Synonyms: &lt;/xf:label&gt;
          &lt;xf:repeat nodeset=&quot;instance('current-synset')/synonym&quot; id=&quot;repeat&quot;&gt;
             &lt;xf:group ref=&quot;.[preferred='true']&quot;&gt;
                &lt;xf:output ref=&quot;syn-name&quot; class=&quot;strong&quot;/&gt;
             &lt;/xf:group&gt;
              &lt;xf:group ref=&quot;.[preferred='false']&quot;&gt;
                &lt;xf:output ref=&quot;syn-name&quot;/&gt;
             &lt;/xf:group&gt;  
          &lt;/xf:repeat&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Discussion ==
XForms 1.1 also includes the '''if''' attribute.  Some XForms can conditionally use this for display of elements.

==Oiling the Valves==

Equipment:
#Trumpet with sticky valves
#Valve Oil
#Oil Rag

Procedure for each valve to be oiled:
#Unscrew the top valve cap.
#Gently remove the valve from the casing.  This is a very sensitive part of the instrument, any scraping or denting will impair the valve's function!
#Using the oil rag, wipe down the valve to remove any accumulated dirt/gunk and the old oil.
#Apply plenty of valve oil to the clean valve, careful not to drip extra oil on your nice clothes or good carpet.
#Gently replace the valve into the valve casing.
#Rotate the valve in the casing to make sure oil is spread evenly across the piston's surface.
#Align the valve guides with the casing (usually this means with the stamped number facing the mouthpiece).  Typically they &quot;click&quot; when they're in the right spot.
#Thread and tighten the top valve cap.
#Repeat on the other two valves.

==Greasing the Slides==

==Cleaning the Mouthpiece==
Cleaning a trumpet mouthpiece is one of the easiest steps in cleaning the instrument.  

Equipment:
#Mouthpiece to be cleaned.
#Mouthpiece brush.
#Sink.
#Soap.

Procedure:
#Run the mouthpiece under warm water or let sit in warm soapy water.
#Scrub the inside of the mouthpiece with the mouthpiece brush.
#Rinse.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are several factual inaccuraties on this page, thus it requires extensive editing to be acceptable.

I'm confused. By 1980 the philosophical ethics line of neo-Aristotelianism (e.g. MacIntyre) had demonstrated that ethics was not part of empirical knowledge, emotion, reason. It was assigned by MacIntyre to narrative language: but it is not a convincing answer, either, just a leftover one.

How can ethics be subsumed under epistemology, when it's clear that it's not part of it, but a separate discipline of philosophy?

FInally, the last statement is logically contradictory. If all knowing is wrong, then knowing all knowing is wrong, is wrong, and thus some knowing is correct. Are you saying the TOK class is itself logically contradictory?

== Textbooks ==

Maybe we could add the commonly used textbooks.

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMEA_0183 NMEA 0183] is a communication standard specifying electrical characteristics as well as data format characteristics. Here, we are only using the message format of NMEA.

An NMEA message (or sentence) looks as follows:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
$SPEED,10000,15000
&lt;/source&gt;
Messages always start with a $ sign, followed by a command and a list of arguments. The command as well as the arguments are separted by commas. Optionally, the message contain a trailing checksum (e.g., &lt;tt&gt;*4D&lt;/tt&gt;), but none of the Khepera III programs writes this checksum.

The original NMEA specification does not allow the command to be longer than 5 characters. The Khepera III toolbox, however, does not use this restriction in favor of longer and more explicit command names.

A stream of NMEA messages can contain different types of messages, e.g.
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
$STATE,random_motion
$SPEED,10000,15000
$SPEED,11000,14000
$SPEED,12000,13000
$STATE,follow_wall
$SPEED,5000,5000
&lt;/source&gt;
which is very handy for reporting results.

== Advantages of NMEA 0183 ==

The NMEA 0183 message format has several advantages:
* It is human readable.
* It is easy to parse by computers and the checksum (if any) is easy to calculate.
* As it uses a start of message character ($) and an end of message character (CRLF), you can break a data stream apart at any point, and the parser will be able to resynchronize (i.e., read all complete messages).
* It starts with a message type and therefore allows messages of different types to be interleaved in the same stream.
* It optionally allows for a checksum, which is useful when the data is transmitted over lossy channels.
* It can be converted to a CSV file with search-and-replace (see below).

== Converting NMEA messages to CSV with a Text Editor ==

If you have a file with messages of one single type, e.g.
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
$SPEED,10000,15000
$SPEED,11000,14000
$SPEED,12000,13000
$SPEED,5000,5000
&lt;/source&gt;
you can use any text editor to transform it into CSV. Simply replace &lt;tt&gt;$SPEED,&lt;/tt&gt; by nothing, and save the file. The resulting file can be loaded in almost any program (Matlab, Microsoft Excel, ...).

== Converting NMEA messages to CSV with k3-nmea-to-csv ==

Instead of using a text editor, you can also use the '''k3-nmea-to-csv''' filter script to convert NMEA messages to CSV. Just pipe your file through that script, by providing the NMEA command of the messages to extract, e.g.:
 k3-nmea-to-csv SPEED &lt; my_nmea_file &gt; my_csv_file
All messages that are not of type SPEED will be ignored.

Note that you can use this filter script with any program to convert its output to CSV. For example,
 ./infrared_proximity -r | k3-nmea-to-csv IRPROXIMITY
would output the IR proximity sensor values as CSV.

== Parsing NMEA with Scripts ==

NMEA can easily be processed with [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl Perl], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python Python], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby Ruby] or similar skripting languages. Example scripts can be found in the [[Khepera III Toolbox/Examples|Examples]] section.

== Parsing NMEA on the Robot ==

The [[Khepera III Toolbox/The Toolbox/Modules|modules]] section contains an NMEA parser (module ''nmea'') written in C with can be used to parse NMEA messages on the robot. This can be useful to read a configuration file, for instance.

== Introduction ==


Cholesterol is a fat-like substance that is found in the bloodstream and cells (particularly phospholipids bilayer) of humans.  It is used to produce cell membranes, to create hormones and serves several other functions. It is attained through the diet and through metabolic processes in the body.  
In excess, it creates a problematic condition of hypercholesterolemia (high cholesterol) – a serious risk for coronary heart disease, obesity, artherosclerosis, stroke and other medical ailments.

== Good vs. Bad Cholesterol ==


=== HDL Cholesterol ===
High Density Lipoprotein: these are lipoproteins (combinations of fats and proteins) in the form in which they can be transported in the blood. The high-density lipoproteins transport cholesterol from the tissues of the body to the liver so it can be gotten rid of (in the bile). HDL cholesterol is therefore called the &quot;good&quot; cholesterol. The higher the HDL cholesterol level, the lower the risk of coronary artery disease. For each 1 mg/dl increase in HDL cholesterol there has shown to be a 2 to 4% reduction in the risk of coronary heart disease. 
Generally, the beginning steps to raise HDL cholesterol levels are involved in life style modification. Regular aerobic exercise, loss of excess weight (fat), and cessation of cigarette smoking cigarettes will increase HDL cholesterol levels. Moderate alcohol consumption (such as one drink a day) also raises HDL cholesterol.  Some medications that are commonly used to raise HDL cholesterol include niacin, lopid, estrogen, and sometimes the statin drugs.

&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:HDL_Structure.jpg]] --&gt;

=== LDL Cholesterol ===
Low Density Lipoprotein - is called &quot;bad&quot; cholesterol, because elevated levels of LDL cholesterol are considered to be associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease. But research shows that only oxidized LDL inflamed the epithelial cell, which makes the epithelial cell to secrete adhesive like molecule. This promotes the formation of plague, the plague not only contains LDL, but also calcium deposits and other dead cells. Therefore, only oxidized LDL lipoprotein contributes to the deposition of cholesterol on the artery walls, causing the formation of a hard, thick substance called cholesterol plaque. Over time, cholesterol plaque causes thickening of the artery walls and narrowing of the arteries, a process called atherosclerosis.

Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors are typically regulated by feedback systems that depend upon intracellular cholesterol levels. Researchers have demonstrated that cytokines induce unmodified LDL accumulation in peripheral cells via disrupting cholesterol-mediated LDL receptor feedback regulation. These researchers have also investigated the regulation of cholesterol exogenous uptake via LDL receptor and its underlying mechanisms. Experiments were conducted on human hepatic cell line (HepG2) cells under physiological and inflammatory conditions.

Enzymic assay was employed to measure intracellular total cholesterol (TC), free cholesterol (FC) and cholesterol ester (CE) concentrations. Utilizing real-time quantitative PCR, LDL receptor, sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP)-2 and SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP) mRNA levels were detected in total cellular RNA that was isolated from cells. Western blotting was used to analyze LDL receptor and SREBP-2 expression. Confocal microscopy involved with dual staining with anti-human SCAP and anti-Golgin antibodies was employed to examine the translocation of SCAP-SREBP complexes from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus.

Experimental results indicated that, under physiological conditions, an increase in LDL concentration lead to an increase in intracellular cholesterol level, which in turn reduced LDL receptor mRNA presence and protein expression in HepG2 cells. By comparison, an increase of interleukin 1β (IL-1β) levels also increased intracellular levels of cholesterol, with LDL present. This was a result of increased expression of proteins and LDL receptor mRNA in HepG2. In addition, LDL was determined to reduce SREBP and SCAP mRNA levels, under these physiological conditions. Undeterred by high LDL concentration, translocation augmentation of SCAP-SREBP from the ER to the Golgi occurred via IL-1β exposure. This exposure was a result of over-expression of SREBP-2 and the disruption of the normal distribution of the SCAP-SREBP complex in HepG2.

IL-1β evidently disrupted cholesterol-mediated LDL receptor feedback regulation via augmenting SCAP-SREBP complex translocation from the ER to the Golgi. This resulted increased expression of SREBP-2 mediated LDL receptors, regardless of high LDL concentration. As a result, LDL receptor pathway produced an LDL cholesterol accumulation, in hepatic cells, under inflammatory stress.

== Dietary vs. Endogenous Cholesterol ==

While it is easy to assume that cholesterol comes only from what you eat, surprisingly, dietary cholesterol makes up only 15% of the cholesterol in your body – the rest comes as a product of liver and cellular function (endogenous cholesterol).  Although the level of cholesterol in your blood comes primarily from your body – it can be increased by high consumption of cholesterol and saturated fats in your diet


=== Dietary Cholesterol ===

Cholesterol from food is absorbed by the intestines and sent into the blood circulation. There, cholesterol is packaged in a protein coat. This cholesterol-protein coat complex is called a chylomicron. After a meal, the liver removes chylomicrons from the blood circulation. In between meals, the liver manufactures and secretes cholesterol back into the blood circulation.

•Sources include: Saturated fats, meat, poultry, fish, seafood and dairy products

=== Endogenous Cholesterol ===

==== Cholesterol Transport ====

Cholesterol is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Accordingly, newly formed cholesterol goes first into the nonraft membrane but seems to become incorporated into rafts in the Golgi. From the Golgi, rafts that are formed are sent to distributed into the cell surface. Because of the high mole fraction of raft lipids in the apical membrane of epithelial cells, it has been predicted that these membranes rafts constitute the connected phase and allow for free diffusion of raft proteins over the entire membrane. Another mechanism for cholesterol transport exists in adrenal and gonadal cells utilizing cholesterol as a precursor for steroid hormone synthesis. Cholesterol is transported to the mitochondria through the cytosol (unlikely that there is a vesicular pathway connected to the mitochondria). An alternative mechanism that has been suggested involves membrane-membrane contact between the ER and mitochondria.  This type of  interorganelle transport has been seen in phospholipids transport and may also apply for cholesterol transfer. The key protein involved in shuttling cholesterol across the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes is the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR). Its structure has recently been determined and it has a binding pocket for cholesterol.

&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:cholesterol_transport.gif]] --&gt;

This figure is a schematic of cellular cholesterol distribution, processing, and trafficking. Cholesterol is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Part of it is transported via the Golgi complex (1) and the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to the plasma membrane, where it is distributed either to raft (2, red) or nonraft (3, blue) microdomains. Most of the cholesterol, however, bypasses the Golgi and goes directly (4) to the cell surface. Cholesterol can be taken into the cell from the plasma membrane by endocytosis using clathrin-coated vesicles (5) or other pathways, including caveolae (small vesicles, or recesses, that have the ability to communicate with the outside of a cell and extend inward, indenting the cytoplasm and the cell membrane) (6). Rafts that have been brought into the cytosol via endocytosis can be located in endosomes specialized for sorting and recycling. From these endocytic circuits, cholesterol may be recycled to the surface (7) or transported back to the ER (8). In addition, certain routes from the Golgi complex (9) recycle cholesterol to the ER. Cholesterol is endocytosed in LDL via clathrin-coated pits (10) and transported to sorting endosomes (SE; 11). From there, it can be recycled to the surface either via a rapid route (12) or through slower routes utilizing recycling endosomes (RE; 13, 14). Cholesterol is also transported to late endocytic structures [15, late endosomes (LE) and lysosomes (LY)] that can fuse with each other (16). Sorting, recycling, and late endosomes communicate with the exocytic pathway (17 through 19), thus exchanging cholesterol between the endocytic and exocytic routes. Cholesterol esters in LDL are hydrolyzed before being released from the endocytic organelles, but cholesterol returning to the ER may become re-esterified. Cholesterol esters (CE) are deposited in cytosolic lipid droplets (20).  Cholesterol can be mobilized upon ester hydrolysis from these cytosolic lipid droplets (21). Cholesterol and cholesterol esters can also be exchanged directly between circulating lipoproteins and the plasma membrane. Cholesterol can be released from cells - both from nonraft (24) and raft domains (25), the release of the raft domains may be involving caveolae (26).

==== Influx of Exogenous Cholesterol ====

Cholesterol can be taken up from lipoproteins in the circulation by mechanisms involving desorption (transfer of cholesterol from the lipoprotein to the exoplasmic leaflet of the 
plasma membrane bilayer) or by receptor-mediated uptake. The best understood and quantitatively the most important process is the one involving low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and its LDL-receptor. LDL is released from its receptor in the sorting endosomes and the LDL-receptor gets recycled to the cell surface. Cholesterol esters are hydrolyzed from LDL, and free cholesterol is continuously cycled to the plasma membrane. The main mechanism responsible for exit of LDL-cholesterol from late endosomes or lysosomes (membrane-bound organelles in the cytoplasm of most cells; they contain various hydrolytic enzymes that function in intracellular digestion) involves a certain protein - the NPC1 protein.  This protein is defective in Niemann-Pick type C disease, a disease in which cholesterol and other lipids accumulate in vesicles derived from lysosomes. The NPC1 protein has been found in only late endocytic structures; its primary function and routes, however, have not yet been distinguished. The NPC1 protein is a multispanning membrane protein that contains a sterol-sensing domain.  Mutations in this domain can result in the inactivation of the protein. Similar domains can be found in membrane proteins that regulate cholesterol synthesis. Cholesterol binding is a possible activity of this sterol-sensing domain.  The NPC1 protein may also act in the removal of cholesterol from degradative endosomes by facilitating sterol transport to the Golgi or other destinations.

==== Cholesterol Efflux from Cells ====

Cellular cholesterol is continuously being lost by release of cholesterol to circulating lipoproteins. This loss can be quite rapid, up to 0.1% of total cholesterol per minute. The release from the plasma membrane can take place by desorption of cell surface cholesterol into lipoproteins.  The liver and the intestine release cholesterol to the circulation mostly as esters by synthesizing and secreting lipoproteins. Another mechanism of cholesterol removal is by membrane shedding, a process that releases vesicles of membrane that may be enriched in raft lipids. 
Studies have shown that raft cholesterol is more slowly extracted by cyclodextrin and by HDL. Non-raft cholesterol, therefore, is the most likely source for efflux. A possible protein involved in cholesterol efflux has been identified through studies of Tangier's disease. Tangier’s disease is a genetic disease caused by the loss of function of an ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCA1 (formerly ABC1). This defect results in increased catabolism of HDL caused by a lowered efflux of cellular cholesterol. The increase in cellular cholesterol levels results in increased deposits of cholesterol esters in lipid droplets of the cytoplasm. One speculated function of ABCA1 could be to promote translocation of cholesterol from the cytoplasmic to the exoplasmic bilayer – facilitating efflux.  It may also be involved in the transport of cholesterol from the Golgi to the cell surface (possibly involving rafts). This transporter may aid the formation of transport carriers by regulating lipid asymmetry.  The ABCA1 protein has been determined to exist both in the plasma membrane and in the Golgi complex.

== Cholesterol Homeostasis ==

Recent, scientific advances have shown that cholesterol completes many of its functions primarily by maintaining sphingolipid rafts in a functional state. However, how rafts contribute to cholesterol metabolism and transport is still debatable. Cellular cholesterol levels are precisely controlled by biosynthesis, efflux from cells and influx of lipoprotein cholesterol. The regulation of cholesterol homeostasis has changed perspectives and may open up more understandings of diseases caused by excess cholesterol, atherosclerosis for instance.
Cells also continuously lose cholesterol to the outside circulation. Regulation of synthesis, influx and efflux keeps overall cholesterol levels controlled.  The necessity of cholesterol homeostasis (and its maintenance), however, is not completely clear. Cholesterol has been thought to simply add rigidity to the plasma membrane – reducing permeability and increasing the durability of the lipid bilayer. Cholesterol was also thought to regulate the thickness of the bilayer – facilitating post-Golgi protein sorting. Cholesterol’s activities have now been expanded with the introduction of its role in lipid rafts.

== Lipid Rafts of Cellular Membranes ==

Lipid rafts are physical bodies made up of cholesterol and sphingolipids (sphingomyelin and glycosphingolipids) in the exoplasm of the lipid bilayer. Cholesterol occupies the spaces between the saturated hydrocarbon chains of sphingolipids, thus, condensing the packing of sphingolipid molecules. This association is presumably strengthened by hydrogen bonding between the 3'-OH group of the sterol and the amide function of the sphingolipid ceramide backbone.

Removal of cholesterol from rafts  (by cyclodextrin treatment, for example) dissociates the raft proteins from the lipids. Average raft size has been difficult to determine, but recent studies using photonic force microscopy have demonstrated that plasma membrane rafts usually maintain a diameter of about 50 nm, meaning about 3500 sphingomyelin molecules. Because of the small size of the raft, it can be assumed that probably not more than 10 to 30 proteins are contained in each raft. Raft size depends on the concentration of sphingolipids and cholesterol in the membrane. 
If the concentration of the raft lipids is increased and exceeds a critical value, the rafts would disrupt the connected phase and the liquid-disordered phase of the membrane. Such changes may play a role in regulating membrane properties both under physiological conditions and in the pathogenesis of diseases such as lipid storage disorders and atherosclerosis.
Lipid rafts are dynamic assemblies that have functions in sorting and distributing lipids and proteins to the cell surface.  At the cell surface, they play an important role in signal transduction and the creation of cell surface polarity. For these functions, it is crucial that not only the total cellular level of cholesterol but also its distribution are regulated.

This picture shows a lipid raft model. Lipids within the liquid-ordered phase are shown as red and in the liquid-disordered phase as blue. Cholesterol molecules, indicated by orange, arrange themselves preferentially into the liquid-ordered phase.

== Cholesterol and Health ==


=== Factors that Influence Cholesterol Levels ===


•'''Diet''':  There are two factors associated with increased blood cholesterol
 
1.''Saturated fats'' (in foods containing and not containing cholesterol) – they include foods with high levels of hydrogenated vegetable oils (trans fats) (palm and coconut oils), avocados and similar high fat foods of vegetable origin

2.''High Cholesterol foods'' – only foods of animal origin actually contain cholesterol – most     common culprits include eggs, red meat, lard and shrimp

•'''Age''': Typically as we age, blood levels of cholesterol increase due to lifestyles that have long accumulated cholesterol.

•'''Weight''': People who are overweight are more likely to have high blood cholesterol.  Also, when extra weight is centered around the abdominal region (opposed to legs and buttocks) seems to be attributable to high cholesterol

•'''Gender''': Trends indicate that before the age of 50, men tend to have higher LDL levels and lower HDL levels than women.  After the age of 50, women’s levels of LDL cholesterol usually increase (thought to be due to the post-menopausal decrease in estrogen.

•'''Genetics''': Many people can have a predisoposal to be high in cholesterol.  Also, several, minor genetic defects can result in the increased production of LDL and the decreased ability to remove them.

•'''Diseases''': Certain diseases like diabetes can lower HDL levels , increase triglycerides and speed up the development of artherosclerosis.  Hypertension (high blood pressure) can also increase blood cholesterol levels and hasten artherosclerosis

•'''Lifestyle''': Certain lifestyle choices and environments can raise cholesterol levels including cigarette smoking, lack of exercise and stress.

•'''Central Obesity''': Studies shows that obesity at the center is one major risk factor for the development of high blood cholesterol. People with central obesity is due to two much of fat deposites, only due to too much of calory intake than actual requirment.

=== Diseases and Conditions Related with high levels of Cholesterol ===

	com/cholesterol2.htm&gt;.

Summary: This site gives a general overview of cholesterol.  It categorizes the specific types of cholesterol: blood vs. dietary, good vs. bad and provides explanations of how each type may be affected.  Links from the page also give general information and even animations on the mechanisms by which cholesterol affects the body. Testing and related conditions of excess cholesterol are covered and it also discusses topics such as treatments, diagnoses and contributing factors in simple terms so that it is understandable to non-scientific people.

Terms: 
•	Statins -  HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors
•	Fibrates – a category of pharmaceuticals that lower triglycerides and can increase HDL levels.
•	Artherosclerosis – a disease in which fatty material are deposited on the wall of an artery


Connection:  This site is still relatable because it looks at the larger scale picture of cholesterol.  Rather than focusing on the specific molecule and how it behaves and how it is regulated – the site addresses its overall affect on humans and gives the need-to-know information.

	WebMD: Better information. Better health. 25 Jan 2007. 21 Feb 2008. 	&lt;http://www.webmd.com/cholesterol-management
	/features/high-cholesterol-treatment-what-works?page=4&gt;.

Summary: This is more of a general information site that discusses in lamens terms treatments available and life style change possibilities for people diagnosed with high cholesterol.  While the explanations are fairly simplified compared to what we have learned in class, it does provide a few good treatments and gives a brief description of their physiological activities.

Terms: 
•	Bile acid resins – medications that adhere to ingested cholesterol molecules in the intestines and prevent absorption
•	Policosanol – is the generic term for a natural extract of plant waxes. It is used as a nutritional supplement to lower LDL cholesterol and increase HDL cholesterol and to help prevent atherosclerosis.


Connection: It relates to the class, again, in the way that it provides descriptions of mechanistic functions – however simplified.  It takes more of the wholistic, health sort of approach, rather than the molecular level of biochemistry, yet successfully expresses the importance of cholesterol to well-being.

	HBC_WhatIs.html&gt;.

Summary: This site gives a general overview of Cholesterol.  Links from the page also discuss LDL and HDL testing and normal amounts – it discusses topics such as treatments, diagnoses and contributing factors in simple terms so that it is understandable to non-scientific people.

Terms: 
•	Coronary Artery Disease – a disease resultant of the accumulation of fatty plaques within the walls of the arteries that supply the heart with oxygen and nutrients.
•	Agina - refers to a painful constriction or tightness somewhere in the body
•	Hyperlipidemia - the presence of raised or abnormal levels of lipids and/or lipoproteins in the blood

Connection:  Cholesterol is a lipid; a subject of biochemistry.  While the site does not go in depth about biochemical processes or functions involving cholesterol (other than the negative health affects related to excessive cholesterol), it is still relatable because it looks at the larger scale picture of cholesterol.  Rather than focusing on the specific molecule and how it behaves and how it is regulated – the site addresses its overall affect on humans.

	article.htm&gt;.

Summary: This site/article is a very good database and provides in depth overview of several of the primary topics relating to cholesterol (mainly relating to health).  It addresses disorders, treatments, types of cholesterol, and uses a lot of the specific terminology – although avoiding detailed explanations of mechanisms.  This would be a very good source for anyone trying to get any information – it is simple, yet detailed.

Terms: 
•	Bile acid sequestrants - bind bile acids in the intestine and cause more of the bile acids to be excreted in the stool; they lower LDL cholesterol levels
•	Atorvastatin – A medication that lowers the level of cholesterol in the blood
•	Chylomicron – a small globule composed of protein and lipid, they are found in the blood and lymphatic fluid where they serve to transport fat from its port of entry in the intestine to the liver and to adipose tissue.
•	Niacin - Nicotinic acid.  It is one of the B-complex B vitamins. Deficiency of niacin in the diet results in the disease pellagra, it has uses as medication for hypercholesteremia 

Connections:   It relates to the class in the way that it provides in depth information on this specific metabolite and goes into specific details about forms in which it is transported (chylomicrons).  It also discusses the physiological functions of certain life changes and pharmaceuticals in lowering LDL cholesterol and raising HDL cholesterol.

	290/5497/1721&gt;.

Summary: This article explains very in-depth the mechanisms by which cholesterol is utilized, stored, endocytosed, transported, etc.  This is a good review article because it has a very high level of specificity and details every important protein, pathway and cofactor of relevant functions.  It gives insight specifically on topics such as how it is effluxed and influxed into the cell, how it is used in lipid rafts to maintain cellular rigidity and how it is a precursor for steroid hormones.

Terms: 
•	Ubiquitous – Being or seeming to be everywhere at the same time
•	Coalescence – to unite so as to form one mass
•	Caveolins – a family of proteins that form oligomers and associates with cholesterol and sphingolipids in certain areas of the cell membrane, forming caveolae.
•	Sphingolipid - a class of lipids derived from the amino alcohol sphingosine, they are often found in neural tissue, and play an important role in both signal transmission and cell recognition.
•	Nascent – beginning to exist or develop

Connection: It is relatable to the class in the way that it places cholesterol into the perspective of several different functions and systems.  It discusses how systems involving cholesterol are regulated and how changes in the function or homeostasis of cholesterol levels can result in toxicity and certain diseases.

6. “What is Cholesterol?” American Heart Association. 27 Aug 2007. 20 Feb 2008. 	&lt;http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=3046103&gt;.

Summary: This site discusses cholesterol, its misconceptions relating to health, its physiological functions and the sources through which cholesterol is attained.

Connections:  While cholesterol is an important biochemical molecule used as a precursor of steroid hormones and a compositional additive to cell membranes (lipid rafts) it has a much larger, application and that is typically associated with human health.  The article addresses this larger issue, putting into functions of cholesterol at the cellular and molecular level into perspective of a whole being.

7. &quot;What is high cholesterol?&quot; Healthy Ojas. 22 June 2010   &lt;http://healthy-ojas.com/cholesterol/cholesterol-details.html&gt;.

Summary: This site provides high cholesterol information that helps people with high cholesterol to lower their cholesterol level and for others to avoid high cholesterol.

Connections: Cholesterol is the Greek word &quot;chole&quot; - means bile, &quot;stereos&quot; - means solid, and the chemical suffix &quot;ol&quot; - means alcohol. Research shows that only oxidized LDL inflamed the epithelial cell, which makes the epithelial cell to secrete adhesive like molecule. This promotes the formation of plague, the plague not only contains LDL, but also calcium deposits and other dead cells.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The ''commandline'' module parses command line values and provides a simple interface for accessing the values. The module expects the command line arguments to consist of
* options with exactly one value (key-value pairs), e.g. &lt;tt&gt;-s 10000&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;--speed 10000&lt;/tt&gt;
* options without value (just keys), e.g. &lt;tt&gt;-h&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;--help&lt;/tt&gt;
* an argument list, holding all values that were provided without a key

As an example, the command line
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
./my_program --white-floor --speed 15000 10 12 10
&lt;/source&gt;
would result in one key (&lt;tt&gt;--white-floor&lt;/tt&gt;), one key-value pair (&lt;tt&gt;--speed 15000&lt;/tt&gt;) and three arguments (&lt;tt&gt;10&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;12&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;10&lt;/tt&gt;).

== Synopsis ==

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
// Initialize the module
commandline_init();

// Register an option without value (by default, options are considered key-value pairs)
struct sCommandLineOption *option_white_floor = commandline_option_register(&quot;-wf&quot;, &quot;--white-floor&quot;, cCommandLine_Option);

// Parse the command line
commandline_parse(int argc, char *argv[]);

// Check if the -h --help option was provided
if (commandline_option_provided(&quot;-h&quot;, &quot;--help&quot;)) {
    ...
}

// Read the -s --speed option
int value = commandline_option_value_int(&quot;-s&quot;, &quot;--speed&quot;, int defaultvalue);
float value = commandline_option_value_float(&quot;-s&quot;, &quot;--speed&quot;, float defaultvalue);
const char *value = commandline_option_value(&quot;-s&quot;, &quot;--speed&quot;, const char *defaultvalue);

// Obtain the number of arguments provided
int count = commandline_argument_count();

// Read argument (the index counter starts with 0)
int value = commandline_argument_int(int index, int defaultvalue);
float value = commandline_argument_float(int index, float defaultvalue);
const char *value = commandline_argument(int index, const char *defaultvalue);

// The following two lines are equivalent, as the option &quot;--white-floor&quot; was registered above
white_floor = option_white_floor-&gt;provided;
white_floor = commandline_option_provided(&quot;-wf&quot;, &quot;--white-floor&quot;);
&lt;/source&gt;

== Description ==

'''commandline_register_option''' registers an option with a specific type. By default (for all options that are not explicitly registered), an option is of type &lt;tt&gt; cCommandLine_Option_Value&lt;/tt&gt; and &quot;eats&quot; the next command line argument. E.g. the command line:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
./my_program --white-floor 15
&lt;/source&gt;
would be parsed as one key-value pair (&lt;tt&gt;--white-floor 15&lt;/tt&gt;) by default. If &lt;tt&gt;--white-floor&lt;/tt&gt; is registered as &lt;tt&gt;cCommandLine_Option&lt;/tt&gt;, however, the same line will be parsed as one option (&lt;tt&gt;--white-floor&lt;/tt&gt;) and one argument (&lt;tt&gt;15&lt;/tt&gt;).

Once all necessary options have been registered, '''commandline_parse''' can be called to parse the command line. Subsequently, the function '''commandline_option_value''' and its '''_int''' and '''_float''' versions can be used to access option value, while '''commandline_option_provided''' returns whether the option has occurred on the command line or not. To access the arguments, '''commandline_argument''' and its '''_int''' and '''_float''' versions are available. The ''index'' must be smaller than the number returned by '''commandline_argument_count'''.

== Option Hooks ==

Alternatively, a program can register a hook with an option:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
// The function to process the --white-floor argument.
void white_floor_hook(struct sCommandLineOption *option) {
    char *value = option-&gt;value;
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    ...
    commandline_init();
    ...

    // Register a hook for --white-floor
    commandline_option_register_hook(&quot;-wf&quot;, &quot;--white-floor&quot;, cCommandLine_Option_Value, white_floor_hook);

    ...
    commandline_parse(argc, argv);
    ...
}
&lt;/source&gt;
The hook function will be called each time the corresponding option appears on the command line. Note that the function will be invoked more than once if the user provides the same option multiple times.

='''Introduction'''=


&lt;big&gt;'''Relationship of Metabolomics to Traditional Metabolism'''&lt;/big&gt;

The traditional methodology of analytical biochemistry as it relates to metabolism is slowly and carefully being replaced by the newer and far more effective methods of the new field Metabolomics.  This is being done simply because the old methods of classic metabolism can't yield the type of data needed for the aims of systems biology and metabolic engineering by concentrating on single pathways and only minor interactions between them.  In comparison Metabolomics is far more effective for a wide variety of systems biology concerns, like nutrigenomics and toxicology. Previously all attempts had been concentrated on proteomics and genomics because keeping track of the entire metabolome was an extraordinarily difficult task. But as more cheap and effective methods of doing this were developed Metabolomics steadily became more effective than even proteomics and genomics. The differences are strong enough to necessitate a rethinking of the experimental processes and procedures and the integrations of data sharing and acquistion. Even the nomenclature and terminology is undergoing an overhaul showing just how much of a radical change in focus and method Metabolomics is. This doesn't mean that the reductionism method is useless by any means. Parts of the biochemical processes and the metabolic systems of organisms can be better understood through reductionism  Classical analytical biochemistry for metabolism is not being replaced. It just has a brand new systems orientated partner in the new and exciting biological and biochemistry fields of study and application that are opening up even now.

==Phenylalanine Metabolism==
[[Image:Phenylalanine biosynthesis.png|right|300px|thumb|Phenylalanine Biosynthesis]]

Metabolomics relationship to traditional metabolism is not strictly for the biochemistry or proteomics to analyze. Certainly many other biological specialists can look at a metabolic pathway and relate to their specialized field. Whether there is an increase or decrease of intermediates concentration or a blockade or degrade of a metabolites, it will certainly have an effect over all of the biology of that system.  Consider the metabolism of phenylalanine. 
Our body cannot synthesize phenylalanine and must obtain it through our diet. Phenylalanine called L-phenylalanine that is found in all proteins (beef, chicken, fish, pork, yogurt, eggs…). The other forms of phenylalanine are D-phenylalanine and D/L-phenylalanine, a blend of 50/50 portion of L and D-phenylalanine. D-phenylalanine is not found in food but can be synthesized in the lab. 

Phenylalanine is an important amino acid because the body converts phenylalanine into tyrosine which is metabolize into acetoacetic acid, a ketone body, and fumeric acid, an organic acid that is an intermediate in the Citric Acid Cycle. Phenylalanine is an essential amino acid because it helps synthesize the right intermediates as part of the body energy synthesis mechanism.If we consider the metabolism of phenylalanine, every single intermediate is important in this pathway. If we consider the metabolism of phenylalanine, every single intermediate is important in this pathway. 

'''What would a Geneticist say?'''

If there is a mutation in a gene that cause an enzyme to become dysfunctional in the pathway will result in the accumulation of an intermediate in the blood, which inevitably causes a genetic disease. When this occurs, the accumulation of an intermediate can either burst the cell or cause the body to find a way to break down the excess which both can invoke serious diseases and organ damage. For example, phenylalanine hydroxylase is the enzyme that converts of phenylalanine into tyrosine. If a mutation occurred that made phenylalanine hydroxylase to be dysfunctional, meaning it does not allow phenylalanine to be convert into tyrosine, there will be an accumulation of phenylalanine in the blood. The body has to find away to get rid of the excess phenylalanine so phenylalanine is converted into phenylketone, a toxic intermediate that causes the disease Phenylketonuria (PKU, 12q22-q24 mutation). The symptoms of a person with PKU are a mousy odor in the urine, irreversible psychomotor retardation and autism. Consider the enzyme homogenistic acid oxidase that converts homogenistic acid into maleylacetoacetic acid in the phenylalanine metabolism. If there is a mutation that limited the function of this enzyme, the result is the accumulation of homogenistic acid in the blood. This give rise a genetic disease known as Alkaptonuria (AKU, 3q21-q23 mutation). Sir Archibald Edward Garrod discovered this inborn genetic disease and proposed that if there is a mutation in a gene it will alter an enzyme in the pathway. This disease cause a urine to turn black because of the oxidation of homogenistic acid in the urine when expose to air. In addition, ochronosis (black pigments) in the joints, bones and schlera will appear due to deposition of homogenistic acid. In every case of genetic disease resulted from the phenylalanine metabolism, if accumulation of an intermediate that caused by a mutation in the pathway.

==Web Site #1: Classic Metabolomics==
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism#Investigation_and_manipulation 


&lt;big&gt; '''General Overview'''&lt;/big&gt;

;:The focus of this resource is specifically the description of Metabolism as a concept and partially the description of the classical methodology of investigating its function and predicting its actions normally and when perturbed. It describes the classic methods of investigating and quantifying metabolism as following a reductionist approach by focusing on single metabolic pathways or on minor interactions between several pathways. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Insulin_glucose_metabolism_ZP.svg see picture]) The methods used here often were the tracking of radioactive tracers through a pathway or the tracking of metabolic levels of certain key metabolites and biomarkers.  Slightly newer pre Metabolomics methods included using genomic and proteomic data to apply holistic mathematical and statistic analysis to the metabolic systems overall. ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:A_thaliana_metabolic_network.png see picture]) These methods were still less effective than Metabolomics would presumably be.

&lt;big&gt;'''New Terms'''&lt;/big&gt;

;Reductionism: An approach to understanding the function and nature of a complex entity or process by reducing it to the interactions of its parts and subprocesses. Considered the main way to understand chemistry up until recently, new approaches within metabolomics and other systems biology fields have shown that reductionism is not effective for the needs of the biological sciences and applications of said sciences. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductionism wiki/Reductionism]
;Metabolic Network: The complete set of metabolic and physical processes that determine the physiological and biochemical properties of a cell. The entire metabolic network is closely related to the Metabolome. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_network wiki/Metabolic_network]
;Radioactive Tracer: A radioactive molecule used to track the flow of molecules and atoms within a set of reactions. Can also be used to track biofluids. [http://www.jhsmiami.org/body.cfm?xyzpdqabc=0&amp;id=9190&amp;action=detail&amp;AEProductID=hw_knowledgebase&amp;AEArticleID=tu6219abc&amp;AEArticleType=Frame jhsmiami.org]
;Metabolic Pathway: A naming convention in biochemistry, the word pathway describes a collection of related chemical reactions that all happen in sequence moving from an arbitrary beginning point and afterwards to an arbitrary ending point. The pathway model is used to reduce the complexity of biochemical systems for easier analysis and teaching. Metabolic pathways are specifically biochemical pathways of the metabolome. (gleaned from context of the resource)
;Molecular Dynamics: a form of computer simulation that attempts to model the motions and interactions of atoms and molecules under the known laws of physics. In the context of this resource it was one of the methods of classical biochemistry, using the reduced aspects of chemistry to try to model the whole. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_dynamics wiki/Molecular_dynamics]


&lt;big&gt;'''Course Relevance'''&lt;/big&gt;
;:This particular resource relates directly to the class since we continue to learn about biochemistry using the reductionist approach today. Biochemical pathways are a standard part of the learning of metabolic biochemistry and nearly everything we’ve done up to this date has been involved in learning and being tested on our knowledge of various important pathways in the metabolic networks of animal and plant cells.


==Web Site #2: The Metabolomics Standards Initiative (MSI)==
http://msi-workgroups.sourceforge.net/ The Metabolomics Standards Initiative


&lt;big&gt;'''General Overview'''&lt;/big&gt;

;:The focus of this resource is to provide important information and establish standards for the Metabolomics field during its infancy and beyond. It has coordinated several workgroups together to detail the aims and standards of Metabolomics as a field and benefit other researchers working on similar projects.
;:Biological metadata workgroups are responsible for detailing the metadata of the experiments for Metabolomics and setting up the standards for running a Metabolomics experiment as detailed by the Metabolomics Society [http://www.metabolomicssociety.org/register/index.php Metabolomics Society Webpage]. The chemical analysis workgroup’s job is to “identify, develop and disseminate best chemical analysis practices in all aspects of Metabolomics” [http://msi-workgroups.sourceforge.net/chemical-analysis/ CAWG]. It’s not their job to determine how experiments should be run but to establish a set of minimal standards to follow. The Data Processing workgroup concentrates on establishing standards for algorithms and data reporting [http://msi-workgroups.sourceforge.net/data-processing/ DPWG] and the Ontology workgroup will concentrate on making the language of Metabolomics coherent and understandable as well as relevant to the sciences [http://msi-ontology.sourceforge.net/ OWG]. The exchange format Workgroup concentrates on the exchange of information and the format of analysis. [http://msi-workgroups.sourceforge.net/exchange-format/ EFGW]. 
;:All of these workgroups represent the ongoing efforts to establish Metabolomics as a field in its own right. It shows that the old terminology and methodology of classic analytical biochemistry is simply not viable for the new Metabolomics field. The fact that a new set of terms, descriptions and ontology is needed shows just how far this field has gone from the traditional field.

&lt;big&gt;'''New Terms'''&lt;/big&gt; 

;Ontology (information science): The representation of a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_%28information_science%29 wiki/Ontology_(information_science)]. In the context of this resource the domain is metabolic networks and the metabolome as well as the science of Metabolomics and the concepts contained within.
;Data Processing : The conversion of raw data (usually through algorithms or analysis) into knowledge about a topic or concept. In the context of this resource, Data processing refers to the processing of data regarding metabolites and metabolic networks to yield knowledge about the function of biological systems and the effects of perturbations of them. 
;Metabolomics Society : A group of scientists and researchers dedicated to aiding the growth and development of the field of metabolomics as well as facilitating the cooperation between Metabolomics and other related fields. 
;Controlled Vocabularies (CV’s) : Collection of terms and descriptions of concepts that are forced to follow specific rules or conventions to allow for maximum usefulness in the discourse about a field of study.
;Disparate resources : Diverse or markedly different resources. This state in resources can often be a cause of problems for data communication since the differences in the resources make translation difficult. [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/disparate www.merriam-webster.com]


&lt;big&gt;'''Course Relevance'''&lt;/big&gt;
;:The description of the Biological Contexts and the Chemical analysis relates heavily to our class work as it describes the new base standards for metabolic investigation and deals with many of the biochemical pathways and aspects we have learned about.


==Web Resource 3: The New Field of Metabolomics==
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolite Wikipedia Article on Metabolomics


&lt;big&gt;'''General Overview'''&lt;/big&gt;

;:The focus of this particular resource is a general overview of Metabolomics and the Metabolome. It describes the Metabolome and Metabolites as well as the study of them (Metabolomics itself) and then proceeds into giving a history of the new field. The webpage describes the analytical technologies used acquire data from the Metabolome and used to apply that data. It also went over many of the main applications that this field of study could be applied to.

&lt;big&gt;''' New Terms'''&lt;/big&gt;

;Systems Biology : The new realm of biological study that concentrates on the systematic analysis of complex interactions in biological systems. This represents a move away from reductionism in biology towards the perspective of integration. Some scientists state that systems biology is not new but instead a return to the original workings of biology which put full stock on learning the overall system during its earlier times. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_biology wiki/Systems_biology]
;Metabolite : The products and intermediate materials of metabolic processes. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolite#Metabolites wiki/Metabolite#Metabolites]
;Secondary Metabolite : Any organic compound that is not directly involved in the normal development, growth and/or reproduction of an organism. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_metabolite wiki/Secondary_metabolite]
;Hypercycles (chemical) : A self reproducing macromolecular system in which the RNAs and enzymes cooperate ([http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Images/HYPERC1.gif see picture]) The macromolecules also cooperate to provide primitive translation abilities which allows information to be translated into enzymes. [http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/HYPERC.html pespmc1.vub.ac.be] 
;Metabonomics : “The quantitative measurement of the dynamic multiparametric metabolic response of loving systems to pathophysiological stimul or genetic modification” [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolite#Metabonomics wiki/Metabolite#Metabonomics] 
;Nutrigenomics : The study of the relation between nutrition and genomics with the application of boosting and monitoring human health. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrigenomics wiki/Nutrigenomics]

&lt;big&gt;'''Course Relevance'''&lt;/big&gt;

;:Describes in some detail the workings of the metabolic systems of organisms and what is needed to understand them fully. Our class has dealt in the differences between Metabolomics and traditional metabolism as well as introductions to Metabolomics itself. This resource gives a very general but informative view of the material that we learned on our own for the first project on Metabolomics and expands off of it slightly. It also describes the Metabolome, which we have learned about piece by piece through pathways using the reductionist approach of classical biochemistry.

==Article 1: New Methods of “-Omics”==
http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&amp;artid=1197421#id2593737 Metabolic Engineering in the -omics Era: Elucidating and Modulating Regulatory Networks


&lt;big&gt;'''General Overview'''&lt;/big&gt;
;:The focus of this article is to describe the impact of the expansion of traditional sciences into “–omics” a shorthand reference for a systems biology approach that expands from a single function or pathway (something like genetics or metabolism) into an integrated system model (like genomics and metabolomics). It goes over specifically the advances made in each field and how those advances serve to benefit metabolic engineering overall. The article first describes the nature of the situation giving background on what we know about regulation and the hierarchy of the regulation of metabolic processes ([http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1197421&amp;rendertype=figure&amp;id=f1 see picture]) and then goes deeper into the contributions of proteomics, systems biology, genomics and finally metabolomics ([http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1197421&amp;rendertype=figure&amp;id=f5 see picture]). They wrap up the article discussing how this will benefit metabolic engineering more than previous techniques.

&lt;big&gt;'''New Terms'''&lt;/big&gt;

;Metabolic engineering: The optimization of the regulatory and genetic processes in a cell in order to produce certain substances more efficiently and faster. The entire context of this article orientates around making this sort of thing easier and more effective. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_engineering wiki/Metabolic_engineering]
;Proteolysis: The digestion of proteins by cellular enzymes or by other cellular means for a wide variety of purposes. This article cites it as one of the methods of phenotype regulation on the translation level of the hierarchy. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteolysis wiki/Proteolysis]    
;Holistic Approach: An approach that avoids the idea that the parts could yield an idea of what the whole would do and instead attempts to understand the function of the whole system. (gleaned from context in the article)
;Hierarchical Metabolic Regulation: A set of theories that state that metabolic regulation operates in a hierarchy, that the genetic level is the first level, the protein translation level is the next level and the enzymatic regulation level is after that. It also states that complex interactions between level 2 and 3 often occur and blend the two together. (gleaned from context in the article)
;Diauxic: Double growth. A description of the growth phases of a bacterial colony that is metabolizing a mixture of metabolites, usually sugars. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diauxie wiki/Diauxie]


&lt;big&gt;'''Connection To Class'''&lt;/big&gt;
;:This article connects to Biochemistry: Metabolism mostly through its description of the Metabolomics portion and its focus on metabolic engineering. All of those things depend heavily on Metabolism and Metabolic knowledge. The article itself however is suggesting a move to the more systems orientated approach in Metabolomics (among other -omics) because the older methods of concentrating on single pathways and small scale integration simply does not give the knowledge necessary to achieve the aims that metabolic engineers wish to achieve. This relates to our Metabolomics projects and their contrast to the techniques and information we’ve learned that follows the more traditional approach of reduction of the systems to stand alone pathways with small levels of integration.

==Article 2: Metabolomics and its new place in systems biology==
http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&amp;artid=1626538 The Cinderella story of metabolic profiling: does metabolomics get to go to the functional genomics ball?


&lt;big&gt;'''General Overview'''&lt;/big&gt;
;:This article focuses entirely on Metabolomics and whether it will be a scientific contender in the near future. It initially describes the history of Metabolomics and how it fits into the entire scheme of biological investigation and prediction for systems biology ([http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1626538&amp;rendertype=figure&amp;id=fig1 see picture]) as well as the past difficulties in working in this relatively new field. Because the numbers of metabolites that need to be kept track of at once are so high, the sciences have put more energy into proteomics and genomics previously. However the new techniques being used are high thorough put and cheap to use. Due to this Metabolomics has easily surpassed past Metabolism investigation methods and is beginning to surpass proteomics and genomics as well.
;:The article describes several major success stories for Metabolomics including comparisons of silent phenotypes in yeast, a high throughput diagnosis of coronary artery disease, and monitoring gene therapy in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy among several others. These things in particular are in contrast to previous investigations of simple metabolism mostly due to their higher level of application. Metabolomics is simply capable of a far greater effect on the application of biochemistry than the original reductionist approaches of metabolism
;:The article also discusses the sheer volume of data that needs to be cataloged and measured before full effectiveness was reached and how cross correlations between Metabolomics and other “-omics” technologies can have major mutual benefits. For instance, Metabolomics is an effective rapid phenotyping tool for mutant tracking in genomics and can speed up the data acquisition in many genomics investigations as well as giving a more accurate view ([http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1626538&amp;rendertype=figure&amp;id=fig4 see picture]).
;:The article also discusses in slightly less detail the need for powerful databases and accounts for the fact that the technology and methods already exist to create and populate these data storage and manipulation tools. The article proceeded to point out the need for new and more powerful analysis technology due to the sheer amount of data that one needs to acquire. New Software is especially needed to manipulate and analyze the data as it comes in. The article concludes by stating the great potential Metabolomics has both in working with other “-omics” and in revolutionizing metabolic profiling but states that the Metabolomics needs to carefully consider a lot of different factors to get its foot in the door, especially in terms of metadata.

&lt;big&gt;'''New Terms'''&lt;/big&gt;

;Metadata: literally “data about data”. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata wiki/Metadata] In the context of this article, Metabolomics metadata is the important side information about the metabolites, the profiles they interact within and their effects on the overall system. For Metabolomics the metadata could reach very high levels since the amount of variation and interconnected effects of changes within a metabolic profile can be astronomical.
;Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy : Also referred to as DMD it is a form of muscular dystrophy caused by a mutation in the X chromosome related to the protein dystrophin. It causes decreasing muscle mass and progressive loss of muscle function in male children. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchenne_muscular_dystrophy wiki/Duchenne_muscular_dystrophy]	
;Rapid Phenotyping : Phenotyping is generally a multiple tier process, requiring multiple tests, imaging and pathology to determine a phenotype of a specimen. [http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/mcp/PHENOCORE/What_is_phenotyping hopkinsmedicine.org]. Rapid phenotyping, using Metabolomics to generate a metabolic profile, is a high-speed method of generating the same resultant information that would normally take a battery of tiered tests and modeling. (gleaned from context in the article)
;Co-resonant metabolites : In NMR spectroscopy nuclear magnetic resonance is used to detect certain chemicals. A co-resonant metabolite is specifically a metabolite whom has a resonance similar enough to other metabolites that detection and cataloging is difficult or even impossible using NMR. (gleaned from context of the article)
;Toxicological insult : A metabolic event in which chemicals or metabolites themselves reach too high or too low of a level or interact with the metabolic system in some way that causes a toxicological effect on the system or part of the system. (context gleaned from article)


&lt;big&gt;'''Course Relevance'''&lt;/big&gt;
:This article deals very heavily in the chemical pathways that we’ve seen in class. During the discussion of how many metabolites needed to be measured the article discussed the structure and formation of various fatty acids and what effect that could have on the data needs of Metabolomics. It also discussed several side paths connected to pathways we’ve discussed in the success stories like tracking oxidative phosphorylation and sugar metabolism in yeast to find silent phenotypes.
:It also discusses a lot of the new advances in Metabolomics, which directly relates to the previous project and how the new field of Metabolomics is growing.

==Article 3: New drawing methods to represent changes in metabolic profiling==
[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1934383 Metabolic network visualization eliminating node redundance and preserving metabolic pathways]


&lt;big&gt;'''General Overview'''&lt;/big&gt;
;:The focus of this article is describing the issues surrounding the previous metabolic profiling approaches that centered themselves on reductionism pathway analysis. It points out the shortcomings of attempts to draw genome scale metabolic networks using the typical pathway methods.
;:The article is a useful view into the methodology of traditional metabolism. For instance, it describes in the background how many biochemists would study one particular pathway, like glycolysis without taking into account other seemingly unrelated pathways that could interact with it. This article cited the usefulness of having large-scale representations of the metabolic profile and how it allowed a scientist to track perturbations of the metabolic system in multiple locations therefore boosting the efficiency and accuracy of metabolic investigation.
;:The article also discusses the issues with overlapping nodes and proposes a system in which concentration and focus of the metabolic profile and drawing may be chosen by the individual using it, to eliminate overlapping nodes but avoiding the loss of necessary data and context. They propose a software system using several algorithms to draw the metabolic maps in a more effective way. Several of these test maps are shown ([http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1934383&amp;rendertype=figure&amp;id=F1 see picture]).
;:The article suggests using mixed bipartite graphs to model the data ([http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1934383&amp;rendertype=figure&amp;id=F2 see picture]) and multi scale clustering in the drawing algorithm in order to help group together the drawing in a way that can be tracked visually and easily but not result in data loss. ([http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1934383&amp;rendertype=figure&amp;id=F3 see picture]). The drawing method also draws metanodes to further enhance visualization with a recursive algorithm that draws the subgraphs from the most nested to the least nested. ([http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1934383&amp;rendertype=figure&amp;id=F4 see picture])
;:The article tested the software and methods and compared the drawing to other methodology tracking whether the drawing method was more or less accurate and whether it was easier or more difficult to read.

&lt;big&gt;'''New Terms'''&lt;/big&gt;
;Clustering: Data Clustering is the partitioning of a data set into subsets of clusters, so that the data in each cluster share a common trait. Proximity to each cluster is often used as a measure of relatedness.  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_clustering wiki/Data_clustering] In the context of the article, clustering was used to determine which overlapping node would go where to prevent node repetition in each of the pathways represented.
;Mixed Graph: A graph is a basic object of graph theory. It is a set of objects referred to as points, nodes or vertices (nodes for this article), which are linked by lines or edges (edges for this article) [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_graph wiki/Mixed_graph]. A mixed graph specifically is a graph in which some edges may be directed and some may be undirected, meaning that a node can be related to another node in a one-way relation or both can be related to one another. This was based on the context of metabolic reactions sometimes being reversible and other times not being reversible.
;Bipartite graph: A graph in which the vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets such that every edge connects a vertex between the two sets (no edge between two vertices of the same set.) They tend to be useful for matching problems. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartite_graph wiki/Bipartite_graph]. Within the scope of this paper, bipartite graphs were chosen because the nodes were not linked (this is because of no link between reactions themselves and no link between substrates themselves, which were the nodes in that example.) 
;Node (graph): Also referred to as a vertex, it is a fundamental unit for the formation of a graph. They are the objects in a graph, the edges imply relation between the nodes themselves. If two nodes are unrelated then there is no edge between them [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_%28graph_theory%29 wiki/Vertex_graph_theory] 
;Metabolic perturbation: Any event that causes a metabolic system to change from its normal functionality (gleaned from context in the article)
;Recursion (recursive algorithm): A method of defining functions in which the function being defined is applied within its own definition. More generally it is a concept used to describe a process of repeating objects in a self-similar way. A good analogy is two parallel mirrors and the infinite nested images they show of each other. Recursive algorithms are simple but effective because of the concept of recursion and always require some form of base case (an end condition) that stops the recursion from going infinite. In the context of this article a recursive algorithm was used to boost the efficiency of the drawing technique. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion wiki/Recursion]


&lt;big&gt;'''Course Relevance'''&lt;/big&gt;
;:This article is so far the most divergent from our class studies because of its strong emphasis of statistical analysis, algorithms and drawing methodology. However it does have some strong connections to our class work primarily because its description of past methods resembles our own methodology for learning biochemistry in relation to metabolism. 
;:The old methods of concentrating on single pathways or mild interaction between several pathways is the methodology with which we learn about the metabolic biochemistry. The reductionist approach has benefits for learning as it makes things smaller and easier to absorb for students who are still working their way up into an understanding of the concepts.
;:It also relates because most of our learning results from drawn diagrams that follow biochemical conventions for showing reactions and path integration. So it directly impacts the methods with which we learn biochemistry not just the material we have learned so far.

[[Image:RIT_NMR.jpg|right|thumb|300px|NMR machine use in for analyzing the proton properties of a molecule]]
Opium poppy is recognized as an ideal model for alkaloid plant metabolism study, because of its diverse array of bioactive benzylisoquinoline alkaloids. Cultivation of the plant has produced such commercial narcotic analgesics as morphine and codeine. Environmental stimuli are capable of impacting secondary plant metabolism, which is in turn capable of regulating other plant metabolic pathways. Researchers have employed proton nuclear magnetic resonance (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR) metabolomics in order to investigate the interrelationship between primary and secondary metabolisms in opium poppy cells that had been treated with a fungal elicitor. Insight from this research is expected to reveal direct benefits of available opium alkaloids on the human metabolome.

Metabolite fingerprinting and compound-specific profiling revealed the extensive reprogramming of primary metabolic pathways that had been associated with alkaloid biosynthesis induction, in response to the elicitor treatment. The content of 42 diverse metabolites, in control and elicitor-treated opium poppy cell cultures, were monitored over timed 100 hour trials, with the use of a Chenomx NMR Suite v. 4.6 NMR spectrometer. Within five hours of the elicitor treatment, dynamic changes in elicitor-treated cell metabolomes were most significantly observed in the cellular pools of carbohydrates, organic acids and non-protein amino acids. Control cultures exhibited abundant fluctuations approximately 80 hours into the trials, and were most evident in amino acid and phospholipid pathway intermediate content. Overall, modulations were specifically detected in primary metabolic processes that produce secondary metabolic precursors. These modulations necessitated metabolite fluctuation in glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, nitrogen assimilation, phospholipid/fatty acid synthesis and the shikimate pathway.

The comprehensive reprogramming of primary and secondary metabolism, along with associated cofactor biosynthetic pathways was mandatory for the analysis of cell culture responses to elicitor treatment. Ultimately, collected data produced a high-resolution map of this metabolic reprogramming, under specified conditions.

The Chenomx NMR Suite v. 4.6 spectrometer used for the experiment was “capable of identifying and quantifying individual compounds based on their respective signature spectra.” For the conducted experiments, samples were analyzed in D2O by &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR. Employing NMR spectroscopy instead of mass spectroscopy (MS) for metabolomic analysis allowed for easier sample preparation, an analytical method that did not destroy sample analytes, and a more efficient and comprehensive compound identification method that provided structural descriptions of unknown compounds. The application of &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR had also exposed a myriad of cellular metabolites that had not yet been observed, in previous research involving MS analysis.

Overview: Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) is a powerful spectroscopic technique that gives information about both the structural and chemical properties of certain molecules. NMR is unique as it is one of the few non-destructive methods for analyzing structure and molecular dynamics. Proton NMR works by exploiting the behavior of H1 atoms when they are placed in a very strong magnetic field. 

Basically, when a sample is placed in the magnet the nuclei of the proton atoms align with the magnetic field in a way analogous to when the needle of a compass aligns itself in the earth's magnetic field. The magnets used in NMR spectroscopy are ten thousand times stronger than the earth’s magnetic field. The NMR experiment consists of the application of radio frequency pulses of energy to the sample. These pulses stimulate the nuclei to rotate away from their equilibrium position and they start to rotate around the axis of the magnetic field. The exact frequency at which the nuclei rotate is related to both the chemical and physical environment of the atom in the molecule.  So therefore, by using different combinations of pulses and delays it is possible to determine how each atom in the molecule interacts with other atoms in the molecule. Finally, using a large set of these interactions it is possible to calculate the three-dimensional structures of molecules.  Nuclear Magnetic Resonance can also be used to look at dynamic processes. Some of which are internal motions within regions of larger molecules such as loops in a protein or the base pairs in DNA or RNA. NMR can also be used to monitor chemical reactions.

This website relates to our biochemistry class because almost all the molecules that we were are studying are in this database.  The molecules in our book and from the discussions in class were discovered or analyzed through proton NMR techniques.  The spectra of these molecules are organized into one large database on this website.

Description of how proton NMR works

This web page gives an in depth analysis of how Nuclear Magnetic Resonance works and the theory behind it.  The site goes on to explain how nuclear spin and the splitting of energy levels in a magnetic field affect the picture that is produced by NMR.  It clarifies that the magnetic field, produced by the NMR apparatus, changes the spin and chemical shift of the nuclei of proton atoms resulting in different signals picked up by the machine.  These signals, each of which are unique to a certain bond to hydrogen and the molecule in question, are presented to the user in the form of graph.  The user can then interpret this graph to determine specific bonds and structure of molecule. 

Terms-

Nuclear spin- an intrinsic property of certain nuclei that gives them an associated characteristic angular momentum and magnetic moment

Quantum mechanics- The laws of physics that apply on very small scales, eg to elementary particles and atoms. 

Nucleus- the positively charged dense center of an atom

Spin relaxation- describes the interaction between neighboring nuclei with identical precessional frequencies but differing magnetic quantum states

Spin-spin coupling- Interactions between the nuclear spins of nearby nuclei, that give rise to characteristic splittings of resonance lines in NMR 
spectra.

Connections-

This website relates to the topics in class by demonstrating the science behind a tool that is used greatly in understanding biochemistry.  Biochemists are constantly trying to identify new proteins and define biological processes such as the ones in our book.  To understand them they need to be able to visualize the atoms of the molecules and reactions.  To visualize them they will use either electron microscopes, NMR, or other techniques.  Proton NMR is, by far, one of the easiest and most efficient ways to gain a quick understanding of the molecules in question.

Database for proton chemical shifts

This website is a great database to view the chemical shifts of different aromatic compounds.  The site allows you to manipulate different the frequency, the compound, and them functional group shown on the graph.  This allows one to gain a general understanding of what to look for in chemical shifts of certain molecules and provide a standard for certain molecules and functional groups.  This database can act as a reference for people who are trying to identify the metabolite or molecule in question.

Terms:

Functional group- a specific structure of one or more atoms that is responsible for the chemical behavior of a substance

Chemical shift- The difference between the resonance frequencies of a given nucleus and a standard reference nucleus

Peaks- The parts of the graph that give rise to the identification of splitting and are indicators of chemical structure.

Aromaticity- is a chemical property in which a conjugated ring of unsaturated bonds, lone pairs, or empty orbitals exhibit a stabilization stronger than would be expected by the stabilization of conjugation alone.

NMR resonant frequency- A variable on the apparatus that for a particular substance is directly proportional to the strength of the applied magnetic field.

Connections-

This website is related to the biochemistry class as it is a good visual of how biochemists determine the structure of compound they are trying to identify.  As this web page focuses on aromatic compounds, it becomes pertinent to biochemists as both Phenylalanine, Tyrosine and Tryptophan, all have benzene rings.  So if a biochemist were trying to identify metabolite in a metabolic pathway for the metabolomic database, he could refer to this site.  If the proton NMR of his metabolite matches that of an aromatic amino acid, he would be able to narrow down his choices.

Applications of proton NMR

This article is a study of how proton NMR is now being used to measure subtle metabolic changes that precede and accompany chronic vascular complications.  These complications are the primary cause of premature death due to diabetes.  Scientists are using proton NMR, in their study, to obtain a multimetabolite characterization of high-risk diabetes patients.  To do this they measured the serum of numerous patients with type I diabetes.  With the use of the NMR they were able to develop new metabonomic frameworks to visualize and interpret the data and to link the metabolic profiles to the underlying diagnostic and biochemical variables. 

Terms-

Macrovascular- Pertaining to the macrovasculature, the portion of the vasculature of the body comprising the larger vessels, those with an internal diameter of more than 100 microns

Serum- The noncellular liquid phase resulting from the clotting of a sample whole Blood or plasma

Metabonomics – The study of metabolic responses to drugs, environmental changes and diseases

Biomarkers - Substances in the blood whose levels can indicate the presence or extent of disease

Metabolic profile- An examination of a sample of blood to determine its chemical, physical, or serologic characteristics

Connections-

This article relates to the discussions in class by showing the applications of metabolomics and how it can be applied to diagnose and possibly treat disease.  This study focused on diabetes in particular and used the close cousin of metabolomics, metabonomics, to determine how each different metabolite affects a metabolic pathway.  Proton NMR helps by allowing scientists to view metabolites in diabetic patients’ blood both in vivo and in vitro easier.  This ability to view the metabolites allows researchers to understand the effects of metabolites on pathways and helps to complete the metabolomic study of patients with diabetes.

Article #2:http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/112149537/ABSTRACT?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0

Use of Proton NMR to determine metabolic pathways

This article focuses on a new technique that harnesses water-suppressed localized proton NMR spectroscopy and stimulated echoes to detect metabolites in the human brain in vivo.  This technique is able to apply proton NMR to an area of 64 square milliliters in order to view the molecules in the occipital area.  The metabolites that they were able to view were acetate, N-acetyl aspartate, -amino butyrate, glutamine, glutamate, aspartate, creatine and phosphocreatine, choline-containing compounds, taurine, and inositols.  Using this technology they were able to compare different metabolomic pathways to each other in vivo. 

Terms-

Spectroscopy- Is the analysis of the lines of light emitted from excited atoms as the electrons drop back through their orbitals.

In vivo- In a living organism, as opposed to in vitro (in the laboratory). 

Occipital area of the brain- the visual processing center of the mammalian brain, containing most of the anatomical region of the visual cortex.

MRI- a noninvasive, non-x-ray diagnostic technique based on the magnetic fields of hydrogen atoms in the body.

Spectra- The plural of spectrum. A range of wavelengths.

Connections-

This article ties in very well with past class discussions about metabolomics.  It is at the root of the new science and reveals a how an already pre-existing tool can be used to aid in the human metabolomic project.  By being able to view the intermediates and end products of the system pathways in vivo it becomes much easier to determine the effects of different metabolites on pathways.  It does this by if one were to add a certain metabolite to a location in the body, proton NMR would allow us to see the how it effects the end product of the pathway without removing tissue.

Applications of proton NMR

This article is a study a comprehensive compilation of a study done on mice, which utilized proton NMR as its primary visualization tool.   The main objective of this study was to characterize the adipose tissue deposits and other visceral organs and to establish a model of in vivo phenotyping.  The experiment used proton NMR to do a morphological analysis and create a 1H-NMR spectra focalized on specific lipid deposits.  The results of the experiment showed that proton NMR could be used to great accuracy to measure the amount of the different types of lipid deposits in the body.  Along with determining the different types of adipose (subcutaneous and visceral) they determined proton NMR allowed them to determine the amount of saturation and unsaturation of the triglycerides stored.

Terms-

Paradigm- an example serving as a model

Phenotype- The observable physical or biochemical traits of an organism, as determined by genetics and the environment.

Subcutaneous- beneath the skin

Visceral- Pertaining to the membranous covering of the internal organs

ob/ob Mice- a well-known animal model for obesity and diabetes.

Connections-

This article relates to what we have studied in class in many ways.  The most obvious is lipid synthesis and metabolism, in which the study showed ways to view the gross break down and formation triglyceride deposits.  If one used proton NMR before and after applying different stimulants and environments to the subject, one would be able to determine the amount of lipid metabolism occurring.  Also by fixing the diet of the subject, we would be able to find the percent of lipid metabolism occurring in contrast to glycolysis.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A student of mine once remarked, after taking a programming languages
class from me, that she had grown from a &quot;syntax coder&quot; to a Computer
Scientist. She once knew only enough syntax 
to get a program to compile and to run, after a fashion, but now she
can identify a computable problem, sort through a set of strategies for
solving the problem, weigh their advantages and disadvantages, and
implement the chosen strategy in a robust program.

I can take a little credit for this transformation, but I believe
the honor should fall to the textbook I chose, SICP: &quot;The Structure and
Interpretation of Computer Programs&quot; by Harold Abelson, Gerald Jay
Sussman, and Julie Sussman. The Wizard Book, as it is affectionately known,
is a wonderful text that challenges students to learn the nature of
computation and data. An earlier edition of that very book lead me on that 
same journey from syntax coder to Computer Scientist. The book is so versatile it has been used as
an introductory computer science text at some universities and as a
programming languages text at others. In fact, I tell my students that
if they were to be marooned on a desert island and they could take one
computer science text&lt;ref&gt;No student has ever inquired as to how such
a situation might arise.&lt;/ref&gt;, SICP should be their hands-down choice.

The existence of such a text as SICP is quite a deterrent to creating this textbook, 
but we have embarked upon such a task. If
there are any drawbacks to SICP, they would be in the choice of Scheme
as programming language to illustrates the concepts therein. While
the authors justify their choice well, the use of Scheme has probably
prevented a wider adoption of SICP as an text for introductory computer
science courses.

This is not a fault of Scheme, which is an elegant, fun, and easy to learn
language, but rather in the parochial view that students need to learn
&quot;practical&quot; languages. These days, practical means the programming language
C and the languages derived therefrom, C++ and Java, both of which add
object-orientation while maintaining a C-like syntax. This trend towards
object-orientation is the second, and perhaps more valid, criticism of
Scheme and thereby the choice of SICP as an introductory text; Scheme
lacks formal object-orientation.&lt;ref&gt;
The effect of encapsulation can
be achieved through the use of function closures, but Scheme lacks a
method allowing these object-like closures to inherit functionality
from other closures.
&lt;/ref&gt;
While there have been many attempts to
add object-orientation to Scheme and LISP-like languages, the results
have looked much like a Victorian home with a ranch-style addition -
serviceable, but with jarring aesthetics.

==The Sway Programming Language==

The idea of the Sway programming language arose in this environment. I
had been using a simplified C-like pseudocode in teaching an Algorithms
class&lt;ref&gt;
I taught this class using the text &quot;Introduction to Algorithms&quot;
by Cormen, Lieserson, and Rivest. This another of the great Computer
Science textbooks and is affectionately known as CLR or the White Book,
although subsequent additions were no longer white. Unfortunately,
students felt the pseudocode used in the book was more confusing than
not.
&lt;/ref&gt;
and my experiences teaching programming languages led me to
believe I could implement a good portion of the pseudocode language.
I chose the name Sway as I would often misspell pseudocode as psuedocode,
which I reckon should be pronounced Sway-dough-code.

I designed Sway to have nearly the elegance of Scheme and all the fun,
but with a C-like syntax to ease the transition of students from Sway
to an industrial-strength language like C, C++, or Java. Moreover, Sway
incorporates a fiendishly simple object and inheritance system based on
a combination of previously published research in object orientation by
others and my own research in this area. The idea that Sway should be
fun makes the language a little more dangerous for novices. The point
is: I wish to teach about computation and computational strategies
rather than how to write a for loop in some toy language. To do so, the
language of instruction needs to be expressive, the more expressive,
the better. Also, I hope to avoid the pitfall of the Niklaus Wirth's
Pascal programming language, a language, like Sway, designed for
teaching. Wirth chose a rather rigid language model so that the language
would be easier to learn. Under such a model, error messages generated
by the language processor usually point out the error that led to the
problem quite directly.&lt;ref&gt;
A common complaint from novice students is
that &quot;this error message makes no sense&quot;. Most practical languages
suffer from error messages that do not seem to correspond with the
actual error. In a testament to Pascal's error system, I remember as a
student having the Pascal compiler tell me that I forgot a semicolon in
such and such a place and would I like for it to insert the semicolon
for me!&lt;/ref&gt;
Unfortunately, the language was inflexible and could not
grow. This rigidness was responsible for Pascal falling, for the most
part, by the wayside.

Sway is designed to grow in ways unanticipated by me and I have given
Sway some properties that I believe give the language a solid base from
which to grow. On the downside, this built-in flexibility can, at times,
cause some rather obscure error messages. For example, a missing semicolon
might generate a &quot;missing expression&quot; error message rather than the hoped
for &quot;missing semicolon&quot; message. To make up for this trade-off, special
care has been taken to make Sway monolingual.&lt;ref&gt;
As an example of a
''non''-monolingual language, it is said that one needs to learn three
languages to become proficient at C programming: C, language itself,
cpp, the C preprocessor, and gdb, a debugger for C.
&lt;/ref&gt;
That is,
the very same constructs for writing a program can be used to debug
(fix errors). In fact, unlike most textbooks, this one provides a link
to an
entire chapter on the debugging of Sway programs, from the mundane
(print expressions) to the sublime (running an interactive interpreter
within a program).

==Organization of the Book==

This textbook is designed for students who would like a little practice
in programming before moving on to a traditional CS1 class.
''The Science of Programming'' takes a non-traditional transit through the
material, however.
Rather than focusing on language features,
the emphasis is on using a programming language to help the student
understand material in an entirely different domain. In this
case, the domain is Introductory Calculus.
The student learns to program by writing short algorithms for solving
Calculus problems.
At the same time, students learn about Calculus
and thus get a little practice in this subject before moving on
to their first Calculus course.

In my mind, current CS1 textbooks suffer from a number of flaws.
The first is that they tend to be encyclopedic. Thus many of
the great concepts of computer science are obscured by a deluge
of details. I don't, and I suspect many students do not, want
to wade through an 800 page (or worse) textbook.
Another flaw is that when examples are used to motivate language features,
a detour
is taken away from the example to introduce some new language
construct,
breaking up the narrative. 
Yet another flaw is that examples are usually contrived and
not very convincing motivators for learning CS.

TSOP attempts to solve the first two flaws by taking advantage
of the benefits offered by hosting the textbook online.
When a particular language construct is needed to accomplish
some task in TSOP, the reader is instructed to follow a link
to learn about the construct, if desired. These links lead
to sections in the Sway Reference Manual, a companion text
to TSOP. These little pointers do not disturb the flow
of the overall narrative.
The final flaw is ameliorated by the use of examples (calculus) that
are most
certainly of benefit to a Computer Science major.

The chapters of TSOP follow exactly the text of 
''Calculus Made Easy'', by Sylvanus P. Thompson and
updated by Martin Gardner. For a student who already
knows Calculus, TSOP (with the Sway Reference Manual)
stands by itself. For a student who wishes to learn
calculus as well as programming, ''Calculus Made Easy''
is a necessary, and comforting, companion.

== Reskinning Example ==

The example used here will take you through both reskinning and modifying the GMAX source of an existing model.


The basic wagon kuid2: 86627:1654:1 is more than just a basic wagon, it also contains a renamed zip file with alternative texture files and the GMAX meshes to enable to move the wagon numbers and to change it to a 2 plank, 3 plank, 6 plank etc. very easily.  It is also designed to be easy to change the length or change the bogey to one that uses a different height.  It has couplings, changeable wagon numbers, it can take air pipes or vacuum pipes, it can carry visible loads or bulk loads.  It is slightly more complicated to reskin but not that much.  You need to do six things, first clone the item and the texture group, second point the item to the new texture group, third do the reskin, fourth reskin the texture group, fifth adjust the wagon number position, finally do the lods.  It takes me about ten minutes once the reskin is done.

It one relies heavily on textures rather than the shape of the mesh for its effect.  All the textures are in one file which is good for performance and it has lod.   It is also scripted for couplings, Chameleon for the wagon numbers and is capable of using vacuum pipes.  The texture file is modified from one created by Paul Hobbs.  The GMAX source and some alternative tga files are included in wagonzip.txt, just change the file extension to zip and unzip it, this allows you to make modifications to the wagon or adjust the position and size of the wagon numbers.


First step is to download kuid 86627:1654 with its texture group kuid 86627:1657 from the DLS. Please note these kuids may still be in the process of being uploaded.  




Then if using TC we clone the item in CMP.

[[Image:clone.jpg]]






This basically assigns one of your kuids to the cloned item.  Now we open the file in edit in explorer.

[[Image:edit in explorer.jpg]]







In this example we can see a number of folders and by convention we are interested in the body folder.

&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:folder1.jpg]] --&gt;

 

[[Image:bodyfolder.jpg]]





We can see a number of .tga files and generally speaking we are interested in the largest one, cs_skin.tga.  Note that this particular model as a couple of alternative cs_skin.tga files that have had their colours changed in a recent version of PaintShop Pro are available in the wagonzip.txt file in the parent folder.  To use them overwrite the cs_skin.tga with the appropriate one.
  
'''N.B. Do not unzip this file without copying it out of Trainz first or CMP will get upset.''' 

There are two other associated files with similar names in this example cs_skin_med.tga, and cs_skin_low.tga which are used by the two lower level lod.im files.






When we edit the file notice the two different sides and ends.  Also note the two squares in the top right that are used to colour parts of the buffers, if you are changing the colour then these must be changed also.

[[Image:Paint shop pro shot 1.jpg]]





If you open the cs_skin_reskin.tga in the zip file you can see the sizes of these sides and ends.  For a photo reskin simply resize the side photo and end photos to these sizes and position them appropriately.  You will still need to change the colour of the two squares in the top right corner.

[[Image:cs_skin_reskin.jpg]]




To change the colour of the wagon in Paintshop Pro Xi or later use the colour changer tool.

[[Image:colour changer.jpg]]




To add lettering use the letter tool seen here adding white lettering to the grey version of the cs_skin.tga file.

There are two other associated files with similar names in this example cs_skin_med.tga, and cs_skin_low.tga which are used by the two lower level lod.im files.  When you have finished your reskin resize the image by 50% and 50% to make the med then once again to make the low versions for the lod meshes.

[[Image:resize1.jpg]]

[[Image:resize 50%.jpg]]




This gives you the basic reskin.  This particular reskin uses changeable wagon numbers.  If they stay in the same place we just need to  reskin the numbers, if they need to be moved we will need to invoke GMAX.  To reskin the wagon numbers we edit the files in the texture group or kuid 86627:1657. The wagon numbers themselves are on a plane roughly one tenth of an inch above the model and this plane uses a separate texture file called in this case ssa.tga. 

The following example uses the texture files from a US Army boxcar to illustrate this found in &quot;25647 ssa.tga&quot; in the zip file.  Note the files ssa1.tga through ssa15.tga are used by Chameleon wherever ssa.tga is referenced.  So since we textured the wagon number with ssa.txt Chameleon replaces the wagon number texture with the appropriate ssa?.tga.

[[Image:edit in box textures.jpg]]



One difficulty with wagon numbers is matching the typeface used so one technique is to crop them number off a photograph and then edit that to give a set of wagon numbers.  When we crop use the largest initial photograph available and if possible crop on a power of two so resizing is not required.  64 pixels by 16 pixels etc.  The planes can always be resized so that the cropped image matches the wagon.

[[Image:ssa1.jpg]]





The first step is to copy the crop to a new image.

[[Image:ssa2.jpg]]





Then paste a new copy twice to give us two images to play with.

[[Image:ssa3.jpg]]





Next we cut a single digit out using the crop tool.

[[Image:ssa4.jpg]]



[[Image:ssa5.jpg]]





Copy this, then activate the ssa1.tga image by clicking on the blue stripe above and paste as a new layer. 

[[Image:ssa6.jpg]]



[[Image:ssa8.jpg]]





Now use the move tool (1) to position the digit where we want it to be (2).

[[Image:ssa7.jpg]]





Finally we save the edited file using save as.

[[Image:ssa9.jpg]]




Repeat the process to create ssa2.tga, ssa3.tga etc. each with a different number.








Moving the wagon numbers will be covered in the GMAX part.

      <comment>/* Installing Sway */ show url</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">A word of warning: if you require fancy graphically oriented development
environments, you will be sorely disappointed in the Sway Programming
System. Sway is programming at its simplest: a prompt at which you type
in expressions which the Sway interpreter evaluates. Of course, you can
create Sway programs
using your favorite text editor (mine is ''vim'').
Sway can be used as a scripting language, as well.

==Installing Sway==

Procedures for downloading and installing Sway can be found at http://sway.cs.ua.edu.

==Running Sway==

In a terminal window (DOS box on MS Windows), simply type the command:

    sway

and press the &lt;Enter&gt; key. You should be rewarded with the Sway prompt.

== Understanding the Fluid Simulator ==
When I first encountered the Fluid Simulator I had a hard time understanding its behavior, especially the ''Start time'' and ''End time'' didn't seem to make any sense at all. Going on a Google spree revealed that many people have problems figuring out the secrets behind fluid simulation, and I didn't find any truly helpful guides.
In this little guide I'll try to explain it in a newbie friendly way. It may not be entirely correct, although it might help newbies understanding how it works.

== First of all ==
''Start time'' and ''End time'' '''are''' in seconds. Don't forget this. Even if your simulation seems to go insanely fast when you set ''Start time'' to 0 and ''End time'' to 10 and having 250 frames in your animation with 25 frames per second, there is a good reason for this. For now, just remember this, don't let your mind wander and believe that the values are in milliseconds or that you have to do some wicked math dividing/multiplying with frames and so on.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Also notice that the domain is the bounding box for the whole fluid calculation. EVERYTHING is done inside this box. It acts as the floor, ceiling and walls for all of the fluid. This is very important, as the number 1 reason why I couldn't get a good fluid simulation going. If I have time, I will do a section on Fluid &gt; Control, but for now, I will say that it adds a LOT of calculation time. Running on an I7, ATI Radeon 8970 Video, Asus P6X58D Premium, 64-bit Windows 7 and 64-bit Blender, I crashed my computer with the lowest quality settings. So just remember that the domain MUST surround the area in which you do calculations. Also note that after you set up your simulation, the domain becomes the actual liquid, so give it proper material and try not to bake until you're pretty sure of your simulation.

== Setting up the scene ==
We'll learn how the fluid works the practical way. plane

* Start with the default box, this simulation will be very simple.
* Let's work in wireframe mode, press the '''ZKEY''' to turn off solid mode.
* Go in to camera view by pressing '''Numpad0'''.
* With the box selected, scale it up to two times by pressing '''SKEY''', then '''2''', then '''ENTER'''. This fits the camera fairly well.
* Press '''Numpad7''' for a top view.
* With the box selected, press '''Shift-D''' (don't move the mouse or else the duplicated box will move) then press '''ENTER''' to confirm the duplicated box's location. If you do move the box, just press '''Escape''' then the new box will be kept but the move cancelled.
* While the new box is selected (and in exactly the same spot as the other box), press '''SKEY''', then '''.5''', then '''ENTER''' to scale it to half size.
* Stay away from the mouse, accuracy is important here and I'll explain why later.
* Now we want to move the new box into one of the upper corners. Press the '''GKEY''', then press the '''XKEY''', type in '''-1''', press '''ENTER''' and the box should move to the left wall of our larger box.
* We want the box in a corner, so press '''GKEY Y 1 Enter''', the box should now be in the top left corner from our current view.
* However, we're in 3 dimensions, not 2 so click '''Numpad1''' for a side view. This time we'll move the box up along the Z-axis: '''G Z 1 Enter'''.
* Excellent, our setup is done.

== Setting up the simulation ==
* Make sure you're in Object Mode, and that you followed the above steps precisely.
* Select the smaller box and click '''F7''' twice. You should get a panel where the rightmost pane says &quot;Fluid Simulation&quot;. Click '''Enable'''.
* Our small box will be the fluid, so just click the '''Fluid''' button. That's all there is to do with the small box.
* Now select the large box. The Physics panel should still be visible, click '''Enable''' in the Fluid Simulation pane and then select '''Domain'''.
* By default your animation should have 250 frames. Rendering should also be set to 25 frames per second by default, this tutorial assumes this setup.
* Since we got 250 frames and 25 frames per second that means our animation is 10 seconds long. So here comes the tricky part, which actually isn't that tricky at all:
** Start time is by default set to 0 seconds. This means that on the very first frame the simulation has just begun. You could increase this value to say, 1 second and that would mean that on the first frame the fluid simulation has already run for 1 second. We don't want to do this, so keep it at 0 seconds.
** End time is by default set to 0.3 seconds. What does this mean? This means that on the 250th frame the simulation has run for 0.3 seconds. However, by default our animation is 250 frames long with 25 frames per second, making those 0.3 seconds stretched over 10 seconds. Basically this means that we're watching the show in slow motion, or slightly less than 1/33 the realtime speed. So now you may think &quot;it looks quite realtime to me!&quot;, and yes, it does, but why does it do that? Well, that's hard to explain. Consider this: In a world without friction, how far would a drop of water fall after 1 second? The answer is about 4.9 meters. So, if a drop of water falls from 4.9 meters it will take 1 second before it reach the ground. How long would it take the waterdrop to reach the ground if it falls from 3 centimeters? About 0.078 seconds. So why do i mention 3 centimeters? Because by default the size of our domain is 3x3x3 centimeters, or '''really''' small. If you're like me, you were probably thinking that the fluid was flowing around in a bathtub or a barrel, not in the wrapping of a cupcake. '''Set ''End time'' to 10 seconds'''.
* Since our imagination likes big things, let's crank up that cupcake to say, a swimming pool. Make sure the big box is selected in Object Mode In and look at the Fluid Simulation pane. Just to the left of the &quot;BAKE&quot; button there should be 3 other buttons, possibly named &quot;St&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;. Click '''A''' for advanced options.
* Some new boxes should appear, Gravity (should be -9.81 for the Z-axis, nothing else), Water and the option we're looking for, &quot;Realworld-size&quot;. Also Gridlevels and Compressibility, but let's not care about those now.
* The &quot;Realworld-size&quot; value says how large our domain is in meters, and as you can see it's 0.03 meters by default, or 3 centimeters. We want it huge, so crank it up to 10, which is the limit for Blender 2.45. Now our swimming pool is 10x10x10 meters (don't drown!), remember this because scale matters with fluid. Do not think we're playing with cupcakes again :)
* Now click '''BAKE''', and read on while your computer is chewing zeroes and ones.
* Remember how I told you to be very accurate about placing that second box? And how I began talking about gravity, falling waterdrops and stuff? Well, now you're going to see why.
* As stated, our &quot;swimming pool&quot; is 10x10x10 meters. The smaller box we added is exactly half the size (well, in terms of length/width/height, not volume), or 5x5x5 meters. Remember that a drop of water would fall 4.9 meters in 1 second? And that our animation got 25 frames per second? This means that the bottommost part of our blob of water will be exactly 5 meters above the &quot;ground&quot;, and that after 25 frames our water should be very close to the ground.
* If you got a fast computer, Blender should be done baking by now. Go to frame 25, for example by using the arrow keys (up/down goes 10 frames forwards/backwards, right/left goes 1 frame forward/backward). Take a close look at the blob, then go forward 1 frame. Notice how the blob hits the ground? Rings a bell, doesn't it? :)
* Although, we're not done! We gotta render our swimming pool. It's easy, but takes time, hit '''Ctrl-F12''' and go make dinner.
* When the rendering is done, press '''Ctrl-F11''', and think of a 10x10 meter large pool. You might want to keep an eye on your kids if your local swimming pool acts this way, though.

== Final notes ==
Scale matters. It's really difficult to understand fluid dynamics on a very small scale, especially when you don't even know what scale is used. The &quot;Realworld-size&quot; value seems to be left out in many guides, I would recommend you set it to something you can relate to, or you'll end up with simulations that look really slow/fast or having an '''End time''' value that seemingly makes no sense.
Further I'm not a mathematical genius, for all I know I could be way off with my explanation, although this way the values makes sense to me, and I'm able to make fluid simulations without &quot;guessing&quot; on values for '''End time'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Sway works by figuring out the meaning or value of some code.
This is true for the tiniest pieces of code to the largest
programs. The process of finding out the meaning of code
is known as ''evaluation''.

The things whose values are the things themselves are known as
primitives. The primitives of Sway can be categorized by the following
types: integers, real numbers, strings, and symbols.

Sway (or more correctly, the Sway interpreter) responds to primitives
by giving the type of the value plus the value itself.

Here are examples of each of the types:

    sway&gt; 3
    INTEGER: 3
     
    sway&gt; -4.9
    REAL_NUMBER: -4.9
     
    sway&gt; &quot;hello&quot;
    STRING: &quot;hello&quot;
     
    sway&gt; :age
    SYMBOL: :age

Let's examine the
four types in more detail.

==Integers==

Integers are numbers without any fractional parts.
Examples of integers are:

    sway&gt; 3;
    INTEGER: 3
    
    sway&gt; -5;
    INTEGER: -5
    
    sway&gt; 0;
    INTEGER: 0

Integers must begin with a digit or a minus sign. The initial minus sign
must immediately be followed by a digit.

==Real Numbers==

Reals are numbers that do have a fractional part (even if that fractional
part is zero!). Examples of real numbers are:

    sway&gt; 3.2;
    REAL: 3.20000000000
    
    sway&gt; 4.0;
    REAL: 4.00000000000
       
    sway&gt; 5.;
    REAL: 5.00000000000
       
    sway&gt; 0.3;
    REAL: 0.30000000000
       
    sway&gt; .3;
    REAL: 0.30000000000
    
    sway&gt; 3.0e-4;
    REAL: 0.00030000000
    
    sway&gt; 3.0e4;
    REAL: 30000.0000000
    
    sway&gt; .000000987654321
    REAL: 9.8765432e-07

Real numbers must start with a digit or a minus sign or a decimal
point. An initial minus sign must immediately be followed by a digit or a
decimal point. An initial decimal point must immediately be followed by
a digit. Sway accepts real numbers in scientific notation. For example,
&lt;math&gt;3.0 * 10^{-11}&lt;/math&gt; would be entered as 3.0e-11. The 'e' stands for exponent and
the 10 is understood, so e-11 means multiply whatever precedes the e by &lt;math&gt;10^{-11}&lt;/math&gt;.

The Sway interpreter only displays between six and eleven significant
digits, depending on the size of the number,
so 1.234567898765432 would display as:

    sway&gt; 1.234567898765432;
    REAL: 1.2345678988

Don't be fooled. Although the result looks like 1.2345678988,
it is not. The following code tests if the two numbers are equal:

    sway&gt; 1.234567898765432 == 1.2345678988;
    SYMBOL: :false

Numbers greater than &lt;math&gt;10^6&lt;/math&gt; and
less than &lt;math&gt;10^{-6}&lt;/math&gt; are displayed in
scientific notation.

To display more (or less) significant digits, the
''fmt'' function can be found. Here's how to display 15
digits after the decimal point:

    sway&gt; fmt(&quot;%.15f&quot;,1.234567898765432);
    STRING: 1.234567898765432

The ''fmt'' function uses the same format codes as the C printf
function.

Don't try and display more than 16 significant digits; the
least significant digits will not be accurate.

==Strings==

Strings are sequences of characters delineated by double quotation marks:

    sway&gt; &quot;hello, world!&quot;;
    STRING: &quot;hello, world!&quot;
    
    sway&gt; &quot;x\nx&quot;;
    STRING: &quot;x\nx&quot;
    
    sway&gt; &quot;\&quot;z\&quot;&quot;;
    STRING: &quot;\&quot;z\&quot;&quot; 
    
    sway&gt; &quot;&quot;;
    STRING: &quot;&quot;

Characters in a string can be ''escaped'' with the backslash character,
which changes the meaning of some characters. For example, the character
'n', in a string refers to the letter 'n' while the character sequence
'\n' refers
to the ''newline'' character. A backslash also changes the meaning of the
letter 't',
converting it into a tab character '\t'.
When other characters are escaped,
their meanings are not changed. Thus '\z' is equivalent to 'z'.
To include a backslash
character in a string, escaped it with a backslash, '\\'.
Note that Sway, when asked
the value of strings that contain newline and tab characters, displays
them as escaped characters. When newline and tab characters in a string
are printed in a program, however, they are displayed as actual newline
and tab characters, respectively.
Double quotes can be embedded in a
string by escaping them with backslashes. A string with no characters
between the double quotes is known as an empty string.

Unlike some languages, there is no character type in Sway. A single
character 'a', for example, is entered as the string &quot;a&quot;.

==Symbols==

Sway symbols are collections of certain characters beginning with a colon:

    sway&gt; :abc;
    SYMBOL: :abc
    
    sway&gt; :a+b;
    SYMBOL: :a+b

When symbols are printed in a program,
the colon is omitted from the
output. Symbols may contain any of the printable characters except
parentheses, braces, semicolons, and commas. The colon marks the
beginning of the symbol while whitespace (newlines, tabs, and spaces)
and the prohibited characters signal the end of the symbol. As we shall
see later, symbols are useful for setting up symbolic constants and for
passing messages.

There are a few special symbols in Sway, two of which
are &lt;tt&gt;:true&lt;tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;:false&lt;tt&gt;.
These symbols are known as the ''Boolean'' values
and are used to guide the flow of a program.
The term Boolean is derived from the last name of George Boole, who,
in his 1854 paper &quot;An Investigation of the Laws of Thought, on which are
founded the Mathematical Theories of Logic and Probabilities&quot;, laid one
of the cornerstones of the modern digital computer. The so-called Boolean
logic or Boolean algebra is concerned with the rules of combining truth
values (i.e., true or false). As we will see, knowledge of such rules will
be important for making Sway programs behave properly. In particular,
Boolean expressions will be used to control conditionals and loops.

Another special symbol is &lt;tt&gt;:null&lt;/tt&gt;. This symbol is used to
indicate the end of lists and arrays; it also indicates an
'not yet created' object.,

==Introduction==
[[File:Herb spiral.svg|thumb|400px|right|Plan drawings for a herb spiral. Herb spirals are commonly used to teach introductory levels of permaculture design]]
Permaculture has its origins in the designs of produce gardens, farms, houses and communities, and so the examples and references in texts are dominated by such. It is hoped that over time, this text will collect references and examples of premaculture design processes being applied in a wider range of contexts. 

This book aims to provide a theoretical overview of permaculture to serve as a starting point for the research and application thereof. It does not aim to serve as an encyclopedia as there are other resources for that (see [[#Other Resources|Other Resources]]).

''Permaculture contains ethics that lead to principles. Some of the ethics overlap the principles. The principles lead to methods. The principles and the methods overlap each-other. The methods lead to outcomes. The outcomes overlap everything because it works like the our cells work in our body. It is a self regulating perpetual cycle, and we are part of it. There is no &quot;one solution.&quot; To me, permaculture is the synergy of all elements.'' [http://hourevolution.blogspot.com/2008/02/permac.html Capt Benny Pants], an online participant in the [http://wikieducator.org/Permaculture_design Permaculture Design Course 2008].

=Ethics=
* '''Earthcare''' – recognising that the Earth is the source of all life (and is possibly itself a living entity- see Gaia theory) and that we recognise and respect that the Earth is our valuable home and we are a part of the Earth, not apart from it.
:'''For example:'''
:*Conservation of Biodiversity
:*Clean air and water
:*Restoration and conservation of forests, habitats and soils
:*Recycling and pollution reduction
:*Conservation of energy and natural resources
:*Appropriate technology

* '''Peoplecare''' – supporting and helping each other to change to ways of living that are not harming ourselves or the planet, and to develop healthy societies.
:'''For example'''
:*Health and well-being
:*Nourishment with good food
:*Lifelong learning
:*Right livelihood and meaningful work
:*Community belonging
:*Open Communication
:*Trust and Respect

* '''Fairshare''' (or placing limits on consumption) - ensuring that the Earth's limited resources are utilised in ways that are equitable and wise. Also ''if a wall retains heat, pass on the heat to a plant that needs it; if a plant provides shelter, place it on a wall that needs cooling.'' 
:'''For example'''
:*Co-operation
:*Networking and sharing
:*Distribution of resources and wealth
:*Reduction of consumerism
:*Rethinking current notions of growth, progress and development
:*Making a contribution

=Principles=
These restatements of the principles of permaculture appear in David Holmgren's ''Permaculture: [Principles and Pathways Beyond Sustainability'' http://www.holmgren.com.au]; Also see [http://permacultureprinciples.com permacultureprinciples.com];

#'''Observe and interact''' - By taking the time to engage with nature we can design solutions that suit our particular situation.
#'''Catch and store energy''' - By developing systems that collect resources when they are abundant, we can use them in times of need.
#'''Obtain a yield''' - Ensure that you are getting truly useful rewards as part of the work that you are doing.
#'''Apply self-regulation and accept feedback''' - We need to discourage inappropriate activity to ensure that systems can continue to function well.
#'''Use and value renewable resources and services''' - Make the best use of natures abundance to reduce our consumptive behaviour and dependence on non-renewable resources.
#'''Produce no waste''' - By valuing and making use of all the resources that are available to us, nothing goes to waste.
#'''Design from patterns to details''' - By stepping back, we can observe patterns in nature and society. These can form the backbone of our designs, with the details filled in as we go. 
#'''Integrate rather than segregate''' - By putting the right things in the right place, relationships develop between those things and they work together to support each other.
#'''Use small and slow solutions''' - Small and slow systems are easier to maintain than big ones, making better use of local resources and produce more sustainable outcomes.
#'''Use and value diversity''' - Diversity reduces vulnerability to a variety of threats and takes advantage of the unique nature of the environment in which it resides.
#'''Use edges and value the marginal''' - The interface between things is where the most interesting events take place. These are often the most valuable, diverse and productive elements in the system. 
#'''Creatively use and respond to change''' - We can have a positive impact on inevitable change by carefully observing, and then intervening at the right time.

==Methods==
There can be any number of methods for designing permaculture. The methods you develop should be informed by the ethics and principles above.

==Outcomes==
Outcomes are the things that result from the methods. Outcomes should be accountable to the ethics and principles, and if they deviate, either the method must be reveiwed, or the ethics and principles adjusted.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The ''measurement'' module provides a common framework for all programs which solely read a sensor (or several sensors) and report the result. Programs using this module therefore accept the same command line options to specify
* the interval between two measurements (&lt;tt&gt;-w US&lt;/tt&gt;)
* the number of measurements to be taken (&lt;tt&gt;-r N&lt;/tt&gt; or just &lt;tt&gt;-r&lt;/tt&gt; for continuous measurements)
* whether to print the results 
** right after measuring (default)
** at the end (&lt;tt&gt;-f&lt;/tt&gt;)
** not at all (&lt;tt&gt;-F&lt;/tt&gt;)

== Synopsis ==

Check out the source code of the '''battery''' program for an example.

== Description ==

This module controls the main program flow and requires only two hook functions:
* A hook function take one measurement (&lt;tt&gt;hook_measure&lt;/tt&gt;)
* A hook function to print one measurement (&lt;tt&gt;hook_print&lt;/tt&gt;)
Furthermore, an array for storing intermediate measurement must be provided.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Precedence==

Precedence (partially) describes the order in which operators, in
an expression involving different operators, are evaluated. In Sway,
the expression

    3 + 4 &lt; 10 - 2

evaluates to true. In particular, &lt;tt&gt;3 + 4&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;10 - 2&lt;/tt&gt;
are evaluated before the &lt;tt&gt;&lt;&lt;/tt&gt;, yielding &lt;tt&gt;7 &lt; 8&lt;/tt&gt;, which is
indeed true. This implies that &lt;tt&gt;+&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;-&lt;/tt&gt; have higher
precedence than &lt;tt&gt;&lt;&lt;/tt&gt;. If &lt;tt&gt;&lt;&lt;/tt&gt; had higher precedence, then
&lt;tt&gt;4 &lt; 10&lt;/tt&gt; would be evaluated first, yielding &lt;tt&gt;3 + true - 2&lt;/tt&gt;,
which is nonsensical.

Note that precedence is only a partial ordering. We cannot tell,
for example whether &lt;tt&gt;3 + 4&lt;/tt&gt; is evaluated before the &lt;tt&gt;10 - 2&lt;/tt&gt;,
or vice
versa. Upon close examination, we see that it does not matter which
is performed first as long as both are performed before the expression
involving &lt;tt&gt;&lt;&lt;/tt&gt; is evaluated. It is common to assume that the left operand
is evaluated before the right operand. For the logical connectives, this
is indeed true. But for other operators, such an assumption can lead you
into trouble. You will learn why later. For now, remember never, never,
never depend on the order in which operands are evaluated!

The lowest precedence operator in Sway is the assignment operator which
is described later. Next come the Boolean connectives &amp;&amp;
and ||. At the next higher level are the Boolean comparatives, &lt;, &lt;=,
&gt;, &gt;=, ==, and !=. After that come the arithmetic operators +, -, *, /,
and %. Finally, at the highest level of precedence is the selection,
or dot operator (the dot operator is a period or full-stop). Higher
precedence operations are performed before lower precedence operations.
Functions which are called with operator syntax have
the same precedence level as the mathematical operators.

Unlike the algebraic precedence you learned in grammar school,
multiplication and division are at the same precedence level as addition
and subtraction in Sway. Thus, in combinations of these operators,
operations to the left are performed before operations to the right. To
force multiplication and division to be performed prior to addition and
subtraction, parentheses must be used. For example:

    sway&gt; 5 + 2 * 3    //5 plus 2 is 7, 7 times 3 is 21
    INTEGER: 21

but:

    sway&gt; 5 + (2 * 3)  //2 * 3 is 6, 5 + 6 is 11
    INTEGER: 11
    
==Associativity==

Associativity describes how multiple expressions connected by operators at the same
precedence level are evaluated. All the operators, with the exception of
the assignment operator, are left associative. For example the expression
5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 is equivalent to ((((5 - 4) - 3) - 2) - 1). For
a left-associative structure, the equivalent, fully parenthesized,
structure has open parentheses piling up on the left. If the minus
operator was right associative, the equivalent expression would be
(5 - (4 - (3 - (2 - 1)))), with the close parentheses piling up on
the right. For a commutative operator, it does not matter whether it
is left associative or right associative. Subtraction, however, is not
commutative, so associativity does matter. For the given expression, the
left associative evaluation is -5. If minus were right associative, the
evaluation would be 3. The only operator that is right associate is the
assignment operator. You will see why in the assignment chapter.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The ''nmea'' module parses a stream of NMEA 0183 messages.

== Synopsis ==

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
// A hook to process NMEA messages
void process_message(struct sNMEAMessage *m, int withchecksum) {
    int i;
    printf(&quot;New '%s' message received\n&quot;, m-&gt;command);
    for (i = 0; i &lt; m-&gt;argument_count; i++) {
        printf(&quot;  Argument %d: %s\n&quot;, i, m-&gt;argument[i]);
    }
}


// NMEA parser
struct sNMEAParser parser;

// Initialize a new parser
nmea_parser_init(&amp;parser);

// Set the hook for received messages
parser.hook_process_message = process_message;

// Read and parse until there is nothing available any more
while (1) {
    len = read(filehandle, buffer, 128);  // Filehandle can be any open file or socket
    if (len &lt; 1) {
        return;
    }
    nmea_parser_process_data(&amp;parser, buffer, len);  // This calls the hook for each complete message received
}
&lt;/source&gt;

== Description ==

'''nmea_parser_init''' initializes a new NMEA parser. After initialization, the following hook functions can be set in the parser structure:
* hook_process_message: Called whenever a complete and correct message is received.
* hook_process_message_checksum_error: Called whenever a complete message with a wrong checksum is received. Such messages should be discarded.
* hook_process_unrecognized_char: Called whenever a char which does not belong to a message is received.

Data must then be passed to '''nmea_parser_process_data''', which parses the stream and calls the appropriate hook function.

== Sending NMEA Messages ==

Sending NMEA messages is usually done by printing the corresponding values directly with ''printf''. However, there may be situations in which you want to send an NMEA message structure as correctly formatted NMEA message. This is done as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
// The hook to send a message.
void hook_nmea_send(const unsigned char *buffer, int len) {
	write(filehandle, buffer, len);  // filehandle is the handle of an open file or socket
}

// An NMEA message
struct sNMEAMessage message;

// When initializing the parser, set the send hook:
...
parser.hook_send = hook_nmea_send;
...

// Initialize the message and fill it with the values
nmea_message_init(&amp;message);
message-&gt;command = &quot;TEST&quot;
message-&gt;argument[0] = &quot;1017&quot;;
message-&gt;argument[1] = &quot;944&quot;;
message-&gt;argument_count = 2;

// Send the message
nmea_parser_send(&amp;parser, &amp;message);
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Suppose you found an envelope lying on the street and on the front of
the envelope was printed the name ''numberOfDog'sTeeth''.
Suppose further
that you opened the envelope and inside was a piece of paper with
the number 42 written upon it.
What might you conclude from such an
encounter? Now suppose you kept walking and found another envelope
labeled ''meaningOfLifeUniverseEverything'' and,
again, upon opening it
you found a slip of paper with the number 42 on it.
Further down the
road,
you find two more envelopes,
entitled ''numberOfDotsOnPairOfDice'' and
''StatuteOfLibertyArmLength'',
both of which contain the number 42.

Finally,
you find one last envelope labeled ''sixTimesNine'' and inside you,
yet again,
find the number 42.
At this point,
you're probably thinking 'somebody
has an odd affection for the number 42' but then the times table that
is stuck somewhere in the dim recesses of your brain begins yelling at
you saying '54! It's 54!'.
After this goes on for an embarrassingly long
time,
you realize that 6 * 9 is not 42, but 54.
So you cross out the 42
in the last envelope and write 54 instead and put the envelope back
where you found it.

This strange little story,
believe it or not,
has profound implications
for writing programs that both humans and computers can understand.
For
programming languages,
the envelope is a metaphor for something called
a ''variable'',
which can be thought of as a label for a place in memory
where a primitive value can reside.
In many programming languages,
one can change the value at that memory location,
much like replacing
the contents of an envelope&lt;ref&gt;
Languages that do not allow changes to a variable are called
''functional languages''.
Sway is an 'impure' functional language
since it mostly functional but allows variable modification.
&lt;/ref&gt;.
A variable is our first encounter with a
concept known as ''abstraction'',
a concept that is fundamental to the whole
of computer science&lt;ref&gt;
Another fundamental concept is analogy and if you understand the
purpose of the envelope story after reading this section,
you're well
on your way to being a computer scientist!
&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Variables==

Most likely,
you've encountered the term variable before.
Consider the
slope-intercept form of an algebraic equation of a particular line:

&lt;math&gt;
    y = 2x - 3
&lt;/math&gt;

You probably can tell from this equation that the slope of this line
is 2 and that it intercepts the ''y''-axis at -3.
But what role do
the letters ''y'' and ''x'' actually play?  The names ''x'' and ''y''
are placeholders and stand for the ''x''- and ''y''-coordinates of any
conceivable point on that line.
Without placeholders,
the line would
have to be described by listing every point on the line.
Since there
are an infinite number of points,
clearly an exhaustive list is not
feasible.
As you learned in your algebra class,
the common name for a
place holder for a specific value is the term ''variable''.

One can generalize the above line resulting in an equation that describes
every line&lt;ref&gt;
The third great fundamental concept in computer science
is ''generalization''.
In particular,
computer scientists are always trying to make things
more abstract and more general (but not overly so).
The reason is that
software/systems/models exhibiting the proper levels of abstraction and
generalization are much much easier to understand and modify.
This is
especially useful when you are required to make a last second
change to the software/system/model.
&lt;/ref&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;
    y = mx + b
&lt;/math&gt;

Here,
the variable ''m'' stands for the slope and ''b'' stands for the
''y''-intercept.
Clearly,
this equation was not dreamed up by a computer
scientist since a cardinal rule is to choose good names for variables,
such as ''s'' for slope and ''i'' for intercept.
But alas,
for historical reasons,
we are stuck with ''m'' and ''b''.

The term variable is also used in most programming languages,
including
Sway,
and the term has roughly the equivalent meaning.
The difference is
programming languages use the envelope metaphor while algebra does not
(the difference is purely philosophical and not worth going into at this
time).
Suppose you found three envelopes,
marked ''m'', ''x'', and ''b'',
and inside
those three envelopes you found the numbers 6, 9, and -12 respectively.
If
you were asked to make a ''y'' envelope,
what number should you put inside?
If
the number 42 in the ''sixTimesNine'' envelope in the previous story did not
bother you (e.g., your internal times table was nowhere to be found),
perhaps you might need a little help in completing your task.
We can
have Sway calculate this number with the following dialog:

    sway&gt; var m = 6;
    INTEGER: 6
    
    sway&gt; var x = 9;  
    INTEGER: 9
    
    sway&gt; var b = -12;
    INTEGER: -12
    
    sway&gt; var y = m * x + b;
    INTEGER: 42
    
    sway&gt; y;
    INTEGER: 42

One creates variables in Sway with the ''var'' keyword&lt;ref&gt;
A keyword is a token that cannot be used as the name of a
variable.
Compared to most languages,
Sway has surprisingly few
keywords.
In fact,
there are just three: ''var'', ''function'', and ''else''.
The remaining keywords
will be discussed the others in subsequent sections.
&lt;/ref&gt;.

The creation of a variable is known as 
a ''declaration'' or ''definition''.
In Sway,
the token after the keyword ''var'' is the variable being defined and
the value after the equals sign is the initial value of the variable.
The
last definition shows that the initial value can be an expression which
refers to other variables.
The Sway interpreter,
when asked to compute the value of an expression containing variables,
goes to those envelopes (so to speak) and
retrieves the values stored there.
Note also that Sway
requires the use of the multiplication sign
to multiply the slope ''m'' by the ''x'' value.
In the algebraic equation,
the multiplication sign is elided,
but is required here.

Here are some more examples of variable creation
using the ''var'' keyword:

    sway&gt; var dots = 42;
    INTEGER: 42

This interaction defines a variable named ''dots''
whose value is bound to the number 42.
The response of the interpreter to a variable declaration
is to display the value bound to the variable.

    sway&gt; var bones = 206;
    INTEGER: 206

    sway&gt; dots;
    INTEGER: 42

    sway&gt; bones;
    INTEGER: 206

    sway&gt; var CLXIV = bones - dots;
    INTEGER: 164

After the declaration of variable,
the variable and its value can be used interchangeably.
Thus,
one use of variables is to set up constants that
will be used over and over again.
For example,
it is an easy matter to
set up an equivalence between the variable PI and the real number 3.14159.

    var PI = 3.14159;
    var radius = 10;
    var area = PI * radius * radius;
    var circumference = 2 * PI * radius;

Notice how the expressions used to compute the values of the variables
area and circumference are more readable than if 3.14159 was used
instead of PI.
In fact,
that is one of the main uses of variables,
to
make code more readable.
The second is if the value of PI should change
(e.g. a more accurate value of PI is desired&lt;ref&gt;
The believed value of PI has changed throughout the centuries and not
always to be more accurate (see [[w:History of Pi|]])
&lt;/ref&gt;,
we would only need
to change the definition of PI (this assumes,
of course,
we can store
those definitions for later retrieval and do not need to type them into
the interpreter again).

==Environments==
The variables and their values are stored in a structure called
an ''environment''.
You can think of an environment as shoebox full of
envelopes.
When we define a variable,
we put a new envelope,
with the
name of the variable on the outside,
at the front of the box.
Inside
each envelope is the initialization value of the variable.
When we need the value of a variable,
we start looking in the shoebox, from front to back,
looking for the right envelope. When we find the 
properly labeled envelope, we retrieve the value
inside the envelope.

The environment is said to hold variables and their ''bindings'' (i.e., the
values in the envelopes).
A variable is said to be ''bound'' with respect
to an environment if it has a binding in that environment.
When asked to
evaluate a variable,
Sway simply looks up the variable in the environment
and retrieves its value.
Sometimes,
the value bound to a variable is
another environment.
In fact,
there
is a variable named ''this'' that is that holds the location of the current
environment (the ''this'' variable is predefined so you do not need to
define it yourself).
If you wish to see what bindings are in effect,
you can ask the interpreter by issuing the command

    pp(this);
    
If
we do so after defining all the variables above,
we get the following
response from the interpreter:

    sway&gt; pp(this);
    &lt;OBJECT 1651&gt;:
        context: &lt;OBJECT 323&gt;
        dynamicContext: null
        this: &lt;OBJECT 1651&gt;
        constructor: null
        dots: 42
        bones: 206
        CLXIV: 164
        PI: 3.141590
        radius: 10
        area: 314.159000
        circumference: 62.831800
    OBJECT: &lt;OBJECT 1651&gt;

Issuing the ''pp'' command is,
in programming language parlance,
an example of 'calling a function' and 'passing an argument'.
We will
learn more about functions later,
but the main idea is that a function
performs some useful task or set of tasks.
In this case,
the task is to
show the current set of variable - value pairs.

In addition to the bindings of the variables we previously defined,
we see
some additional bindings for
''constructor'',
''dynamicContext'',
''context'',
and ''this''.
These variables are predefined by Sway for every environment.
In
this particular case,
the variable ''context'' is bound to the environment that has the
Sway built-in functions defined.
As you will later see, sometimes we will try
to look up a variable in the current environment.
If we don't find it, we will look up the value
of the ''context'' variable instead and continue
our search using that environment instead.
We will discuss the other predefined variables further at a
later time.

If you were to ask the interpreter to
display the bindings of ''context'',
you would get a long list:

    sway&gt; pp(context);
    &lt;OBJECT 137&gt;:
        array?: &lt;function array?(a)&gt;
        string?: &lt;function string?(a)&gt;
        real?: &lt;function real?(a)&gt;
        integer?: &lt;function integer?(a)&gt;
             ...
        +: &lt;function +(a,b)&gt;
        -: &lt;function -(a,b)&gt;
        *: &lt;function *(a,b)&gt;
        /: &lt;function /(a,b)&gt;
             ...
        if: &lt;function if(a,$b,$c)&gt;
        while: &lt;function while($a,$b)&gt;
             ...
        ||: &lt;function ||&gt;
        &amp;&amp;: &lt;function &amp;&amp;&gt;
             ...
        catch: &lt;function catch($a)&gt;
        =: &lt;function =($a,b)&gt;
        .: &lt;function .(a,$b)&gt;
             ...
    OBJECT: &lt;OBJECT 137&gt;

Note
that even though the variables ''context''
and ''this'' are bound to environments,
the ''pp'' function says
they are bound to objects.
In Sway,
unlike other languages,
objects and
environments are the same thing.
In fact,
the terms object and environment
should all be considered equivalent.
You will learn more about
objects in a later chapter.

After displaying the bindings,
the interpreter displays the result
of evaluating the
''pp'' command,
which is always the thing passed to the
''pp'' function.
The fact
that something was displayed other than the
returned value is known as a ''side-effect''.
The side-effect is not part of
the value of the expression.
It is these very side-effects that make
it dangerous to depend on the order of operand evaluation.

The ability to look at the current set of bindings is a useful tool for
figuring out why a program is not behaving as you think it should.
The
process of fixing such problems is known as ''[[../Debugging|debugging]]''.

==Variable naming==

Unlike many languages,
Sway is quite liberal in regards to legal variable names and to what entities variables can be bound.
Consider the following variable declarations:

    sway&gt; var times = *;
    BUILT-IN: &lt;function *&gt;
     
    sway&gt; 6 times 7;
    INTEGER: 42
     
    sway&gt; var dots+bones = 5;
    INTEGER: 5
     
    sway&gt; dots+bones;
    INTEGER: 5
     
    sway&gt; dots + bones;
    INTEGER: 248
     
The first declaration defines a variable named '''times''' and
gives it the same value as the operator *.
Note that the response of
the interpreter tells us that times has been bound to the function
originally bound to *&lt;ref&gt;
In Sway,
all operators are ''functions''.
Conversely,
all functions
that take two arguments are operators.
More on this later.
&lt;/ref&gt;.
At this point,
both the variables ''times'' and *
are bound to the same function and can be used interchangeably,
as the
next interaction shows.
From this example,
we can see that operators
are regular variables which happen to be bound to appropriate built-in
functions.
As stated earlier,
this allows the Sway programmer great
latitude in creating new operators.
From the next interactions,
we can
see that whitespace is very important in delineating variable names:
''dots+bones'' is a single variable name while ''dots'' + ''bones''
is a combination
of two distinct variables named ''dots'' and ''bones'';
in particular they are
combined with the built-in function bound to the variable +.

Variables are the next layer in a programming languages,
resting on
the primitive expressions and combinations of expressions (which are
expressions themselves).
In fact,
variables can be thought of as an
abstraction of the primitives.
As an analogy,
consider your name.
Your
name is not you,
but it is a convenient (and abstract) way of referring
to you.
In the same way,
variables can be thought of the names of
things.
They aren't the thing itself,
but a convenient way to referring
to the thing.

While Sway lets you name variables in wild ways,
you should temper your
creativity if it gets out of hand.
For example,
rather than use the
variable ''m'' for the slope,
we could use the name slope instead:

    var slope = 6;

We could have also used a different name:

    var !@#$% = 6;

The name ''!@#$%'' is a perfectly good variable name from Sway's point of
view.
It is a particularly poor name from the point of making your Sway
programs readable by you and others.
It is important that your variable
names reflect their purpose.
In the example above,
which is the better name: ''m, ''slope'', or ''!@#$%''?

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{TOC right}}
Once a variable has been declared, it is possible to change its binding
using the assignment operator. Consider the following interaction with
the interpreter:

    sway&gt; var BLACK = 1;        //initialization!
    INTEGER: 1
    
    sway&gt; var BROWN = 2;
    INTEGER: 2
    
    sway&gt; var GREEN = 3;
    INTEGER: 3
    
    sway&gt; var eyeColor = BLACK;
    INTEGER: 1
    
    sway&gt; eyeColor;
    INTEGER: 1
    
    sway&gt; eyeColor = GREEN;     //assignment!
    INTEGER: 3
    
    sway&gt; eyeColor == BROWN;    //equality?
    SYMBOL: :false
    
    sway&gt; eyeColor == GREEN;
    SYMBOL: :true

The operator/variable = (equals sign) is bound to the ''assignment'' function.
The assignment function, however, is not a true function, like those bound
to + and *. Recall that + and the like evaluate the things on either
side (recall that those things on either side are generically known as
operands) before combining them. For =, the left operand is not evaluated
(if it were, the assignment

    eyeColor = GREEN
    
would attempt to change the
meaning of 1 to be 3). In general, an operator which does not evaluate
all its arguments is known as a special form&lt;ref&gt;
Unlike most languages, Sway allows user defined special forms.
&lt;/ref&gt;.

Now we can see a variable definition has two steps. In the first step,
the variable is created and in the second step, a value is assigned to
that variable.

The last two expressions given to the interpreter in the previous
interaction refer to the == (equality) operator.
The operator == returns
true if its operands refer to the same thing and false otherwise. In the
interaction above, the variables BLACK, GREEN, and BROWN are not meant
to change from their initial values.
We denote variables whose values aren't supposed to change
by naming the
variable using (mostly) capital letters (this convention is borrowed
from earlier programming languages).
The use of caps emphasizes the constant nature of the (not too) variable.

In the above interaction with the interpreter, we use the integers 1, 2,
and 3 to represent the colors black, brown, and green. By abstracting 1,
2, and 3 and giving them meaningful names (i.e., BLACK, BROWN,
and GREEN) we find it easy to read code that
assigns and tests eye color.
We do this because it is difficult to remember which integer
is assigned to which color. Without the variables BLACK, BROWN, and
GREEN, we have to keep little notes somewhere to remind ourselves what's
what. Here is an equivalent interaction with the interpreter without
the use of the variables BLACK, GREEN, and BROWN.

    sway&gt; var eyeColor = 1;
    INTEGER: 1
    
    sway&gt; eyeColor;
    INTEGER: 1
    
    sway&gt; eyeColor = 3;
    INTEGER: 3
    
    sway&gt; eyeColor == 2;
    SYMBOL: :false
    
    sway&gt; eyeColor == 3;
    SYMBOL: :true
    
In this interaction, the meaning of the test eyeColor == 3 is not so obvious.

Another approach to constants is to use symbols.
Since Sway has symbols as primitives, we can dispense with the constant-like variables and the integers altogether:

    sway&gt; var eyeColor = :black;
    SYMBOL: :black
    
    sway&gt; eyeColor;
    SYMBOL: :black
    
    sway&gt; eyeColor = :green;
    SYMBOL: :green
    
    sway&gt; eyeColor == :brown;
    SYMBOL: :false
    
    sway&gt; eyeColor == :green;
    SYMBOL: :true

    sway&gt; println(&quot;eye color is &quot;,eyeColor);
    eye color is green
    SYMBOL: :green 
    
Note how much more readable this version of the interaction is.
Also note that symbols, when printed, are printed without
the colon.

==Precedence and Associativity of Assignment==

Assignment has the lowest precedence among the binary operators. It is
also right associative. The right associativity allows for statements like

    a = b = c = d = 0;

which conveniently assigns a zero to four variables at once and is
equivalent to:

    (a = (b = (c = (d = 0))));

because of the right associative nature of the operator. Since the
resulting value of the assignment operation is the value assigned,
this statement works as desired.

==How it works==

Sway takes a novel approach to assignment.
Every time a value is retrieved,
its address is (usually) saved in an internal register.
The assignment operator
takes advantage of this fact by:

# looking up the value of the left-hand-side
# checking for a valid address in the internal register
# writing the value of the right hand side to the valid address

For example, the assignment

     x = 3;

proceeds by looking up the value of ''x''. The current value of
''x'' is ignored, but the internal register now contains the location
of ''x''. 
The value of 3 is then copied to the address and
''x'' has a new value.

By this method, one can write to array and list elements as well
as objects:

    a[y] = z;
    head(tail(items)) = :green;
    a . f() . b = &quot;hello&quot;;

There are some limitations to assignment. For example, you
cannot use the assignment operator to change the tail of
a list. For example, this attempt will fail:

    tail(items) = list(a,b,c);

because the tail of a list does not have not a normal address in Sway.
To change the tail of the list, one uses the ''tail='' operator, instead:

    items tail= list(a,b,c);

or

    tail=(items,list(a,b,c));

if you prefer function call syntax.

There is a ''head='' operator for changing the
head of the list, but it is bound to the 
regular assignment operator, so you can use
either.

==Assigning to Thunks==

If the code in a thunk has a regular Sway address, you can
use the assignment operator to update the value at that
address. This is how a ''forEach'' function would work:

    function forEach($target,items,$body)
        {
        while (items != null)
            {
            $target = head(items);
            force($body);
            items = tail(items);
            }
        }

Here, the thunk ''$target'' is repeatedly updated with the (new)
head of the list. Once the update is made with the assignment
operator, the body of the ''forEach'' is forced and the process repeated.
The ''forEach'' function can be called with a simple variable, as in

    var i;
    forEach(i,range(0,4))
        {
        println(&quot;i is &quot;,i);
        }

or with an array or list location, as in

    var i = array(1,2,3);
    forEach(i[2],range(0,4))
        {
        println(&quot;i[2] is &quot;,i[2]);
        }

or with an object member, as in

    function bundle(a,b) { this; }
    var i = bundle(1,2);
    forEach(i . a,range(0,4))
        {
        println(&quot;i . a is &quot;,i . a);
        }

== Lack a working FCGI wrapper ==
Seen a screen like the following?
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
FastCGI Error
The FastCGI Handler was unable to process the request.

Error Details:

    * The FastCGI process exited unexpectedly
    * Error Number: -2147467259 (0x80004005).
    * Error Description: Unspecified error

HTTP Error 500 - Server Error.
Internet Information Services (IIS)
&lt;/source&gt;
If you're using Perl, or the ilk, you probably forgot to set up an FCGI wrapper. This can occur if you try to replace CGI, with FastCGI and don't use something like IIS::FCGI, or an MVC fastcgi wrapper. Reference this book's perl-specific documentation at [[../Scripting languages/Perl/]].

Another common cause is a misconfiguration script, or a script that crashes on startup. Make sure your fcgi script runs outside of the webserver environment (run it explicitly in the &lt;tt&gt;cmd&lt;/tt&gt; shell).

&lt;!--
No problem! Just add r/w permissions for the INET

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Encapsulating Sequences of Operations=

==Defining Functions==
Recall, the series of expressions we evaluated to find
the ''y''-value of a point on the line

&lt;math&gt;
    y = 6x - 12
&lt;/math&gt;
    
given an ''x''-value:

&lt;code&gt;
    sway&gt; var m = 6;
    INTEGER: 6

    sway&gt; var x = 9;  
    INTEGER: 9

    sway&gt; var b = -12;
    INTEGER: -12

    sway&gt; var y = m * x + b;
    INTEGER: 42

    sway&gt; y;
    INTEGER: 42
&lt;/code&gt;

Now, suppose we wished to find the ''y''-value corresponding to
a different ''x''-value or, worse yet, for a different ''x''-value
on a different line. All the work we did would have to be
repeated. A function is a way to encapsulate all these operations
so we can repeat them with a minimum of effort.

First, we will define a not too useful function that
calculates ''y'' give a slope of 6,
a ''y''-intercept of -12, and an
''x''-value of 9 (exactly
as above).

&lt;code&gt;
    sway&gt; function findY()
    more&gt;    {
    more&gt;    var slope = 6;
    more&gt;    var x = 9;
    more&gt;    var intercept = -12;
    more&gt;    return slope * x + intercept;
    more&gt;    }
    FUNCTION: &lt;function findY()&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;

Notice that the interpreter prompt changes to &lt;tt&gt;more&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; when
it the input is incomplete. In the case of the function definition
above, that occurs when the curly close brace is entered (1).

Once the function is defined, we can find the value of ''y'' repeatedly:

&lt;code&gt;
    sway&gt; findY()
    INTEGER: 42

    sway&gt; findY()
    INTEGER: 42
&lt;/code&gt;

This function is not too useful in that we cannot use it to compute
similar things, such as the ''y''-value for a different value of
''x''. A hallmark of a good function is that is lets you compute
more than one thing. We can modify our function to ''take in'' the
value of ''x'' we are interested in. We do this by ''passing'' in 
an ''argument'', in this case, the value of ''x''.

&lt;code&gt;
    sway&gt; function findY(x)
    more&gt;    {
    more&gt;    var slope = 6;
    more&gt;    var intercept = -12;
    more&gt;    return slope * x + intercept;
    more&gt;    }
    FUNCTION: &lt;function findY()&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;

We give names to the values being passed in by placing variable
names between the function definition parentheses.
In this case, we chose ''x'' as the name.
Notice that since we are passing in ''x'', we no longer need (or want)
the definition of ''x'', so we delete it.
Now we can compute ''y'' for an infinite number of ''x'''s.

&lt;code&gt;
    sway&gt; findY(9);
    INTEGER: 42

    sway&gt; findY(0);
    INTEGER: -12

    sway&gt; findY(-2);
    INTEGER: -24
&lt;/code&gt;

What if we wish to compute a ''y''-value for a given ''x'' for a different
line? One approach would be to pass in the ''slope'' and ''intercept''
as well as ''x'':

&lt;code&gt;
    sway&gt; function findY(x,slope,intercept)
    more&gt;    {
    more&gt;    return slope * x + intercept;
    more&gt;    }
    FUNCTION: &lt;function findY()&gt;

    sway&gt; findY(9,6,-12);
    INTEGER: 42
    sway&gt; findY(0,6,-12);
    INTEGER: -12
&lt;/code&gt;

If we wish to calculate using a different line, we just pass in the
new ''slope'' and ''intercept'' along with our value of ''x''.
This certainly works as intended, but is not the best way. One problem
is that we keep on having to type in the slope and intercept even if
we are computing ''y''-values on the same line. Anytime you
find yourself doing the same thing over and over, be assured that
someone has thought of a way to avoid that particular tedium.
So assuming that is true, how do we
customize our function so that we only have to enter the slope
and intercept once per particular line? We will explore
three different ways for doing this. In reading further,
it is not important if you understand all that is going on.
What is important is that you know other approaches exist
and understand the pros and cons of each approach:

==Creating functions on the fly==

At this point, you should see that you can create functions and should
be able to create other functions through pattern matching. For
example, you ought to be able to define a function that squares
a given number:

&lt;code&gt;
    function square(x)
        {
        return x * x;
        }
&lt;/code&gt;

Since creating functions is hard work (lots of typing) and
Computer Scientists avoid hard work like the plague, somebody
early on got the idea of writing a function that itself 
creates functions! Brilliant! We can do this for our line problem.
We will tell our creative function to create a ''findY'' function
for a particular slope and intercept!

&lt;code&gt;
    function makeFinder(slope,intercept)
         {
         function findY(x)
             {
             return slope * x + intercept;
             }
        return findY;
        }
&lt;/code&gt;

See how our creative function defines a ''findY'' function and then
returns it. Now we can create a bunch of different ''findY'''s.

&lt;code&gt;
    sway&gt; var findYa = makeFinder(6,-12);
    FUNCTION: &lt;function findY(x)&gt;

    sway&gt; var findYb = makeFinder(5,2);
    FUNCTION: &lt;function findY(x)&gt;

    sway&gt; findYa(9);
    INTEGER: 42

    sway&gt; findYb(9);
    INTEGER: 47
&lt;/code&gt;

Notice how ''findYa'' and ''findYb'' remember
the slope and intercept supplied
when they were create.
While this is decidedly cool, the problem is many languages (C and Java
included) do not allow you to define functions that create other functions.

==Using objects==

Another approach to our line problem is to use something called an object.
In Sway, an object is simply an environment and we have seen those 
before. So there is nothing new here except in how to use objects
to achieve our goal. Here, we define a creating function (known as
a constructor) that creates and returns a line object.

&lt;code&gt;
    function line(slope,intercept)
        {
        return this;
        }
&lt;/code&gt;

The this variable always points to the current environment, which, in
this case, includes ''slope'' and ''intercept''. By returning
this, we return this environment, and we can look up the values of
''slope'' and ''intercept'' at our leisure. To prove that slope and intercept
exist, we can use the built-in ''bindings'' function:

&lt;code&gt;
    sway&gt; lineA = line(6,-12);
    sway&gt; bindings(lineA);
    OBJECT 231:
        context : &lt;object 145&gt;
        dynamicContext: &lt;object 145&gt;
        constructor: &lt;function line(slope,intercept)&gt;
        this: &lt;object 231&gt;
        intercept: -12
        slope : 6
    SYMBOL: :true
&lt;/code&gt;

We access the variables in an object with the '.' (dot) operator:

&lt;code&gt;
    sway&gt; lineA . slope;
    INTEGER: 6

    sway&gt; lineA . constructor;
    FUNCTION: &lt;function line(slope,intercept)&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;

Now we modify our ''findY'' function to take in a line object as
well as ''x'' and use the dot operator to extract the line's slope
and intercept:

&lt;code&gt;
    function findY(line,x)
        {
        return line . slope * x + line . intercept;
        }
&lt;/code&gt;

In this scenario, we create different lines, then pass each
line to our new ''findY'' function:

&lt;code&gt;
    sway&gt; var lineA = line(6,-12);
    OBJECT: &lt;object 231&gt;

    sway&gt; var lineB = line(5,2);
    OBJECT: &lt;object 256&gt;

    sway&gt; findY(lineA,9);
    INTEGER: 42

    sway&gt; findY(lineB,9);
    INTEGER: 47
&lt;/code&gt;

The problem with this approach is we have separated line objects from
finding ''y'' values, yet these two concepts are closely related. As
an example, suppose we have parabola objects as well as line objects.
Our ''findY'' function would fail miserably for parabola objects
even though the concept of (x,y) points on a parabola is just as
valid as points on a line (2).
In the
object oriented world, we solve this problem by
bundling the object and functions that work specifically on
that object together. In our case,
we 
make the ''findY'' function part of the line object:

&lt;code&gt;
    function line(slope,intercept)
        {
        function findY(x)
            {
            return slope * x + intercept;
            }
        this;
        }
&lt;/code&gt;

This is very similar to the functions-on-the-fly approach, but we
return ''this'' instead of ''findY''. Now we call the ''findY'' function
via the line object.

&lt;code&gt;
    sway&gt; var lineA = line(6,-12);
    OBJECT: &lt;object 231&gt;

    sway&gt; var lineB = line(5,2);
    OBJECT: &lt;object 256&gt;

    sway&gt; lineA . findY(9);
    INTEGER: 42

    sway&gt; lineB . findY(9);
    INTEGER: 47
&lt;/code&gt;

Should we have a parabola object, it would have its own ''findY'' function
with a different implementation. We would call it just the same, however:

&lt;code&gt;
    sway&gt; var parabolaA = parabola(2,0,0);
    OBJECT: &lt;object 453&gt;

    sway&gt; parabolaA . findY(7);
    INTEGER: 49
&lt;/code&gt;

This approach is supported in object oriented languages such as Java.
The earlier approach (where the function was separated from the object)
is supported in procedural languages such as C.

==Questions==

==Exercises==

----

(1) Typing a long construct into the interpreter is tedious.
Later we will learn how to store our code in a file and have
the interpreter execute the code in that file. If we need to
make changes to our code, we simply ''edit'' the file. That
way, we do not need to type in the modified code into the
interpreter from scratch.

(2) Here is a concrete example of trying to ''generalize'', so that
our function works for all objects for which the concept of
the function is valid.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Celx Scripting: Position =

== position==

A &quot;position&quot; object contains the exact coordinates of a point in space. A &quot;position&quot; object is relative to a coordinate system (i.e. a frame of reference, see [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx frame|Celx Scripting: Frame]]) and may need to be converted to or from universal coordinates before further use.

Within a CELX script, the position methods need to be prefixed with the obtained &quot;position&quot; object, separated with a semicolon.

The following methods can be used to obtain a &quot;position&quot; object:
* Using the [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx celestia#newposition|celestia:newposition()]] method.
* Using the [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx celestia#newposition (base64)|celestia:newposition(base64)]] method.
* Using the [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx observer#getposition|observer:getposition()]] method.
* Using the [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx object#getposition|object:getposition()]] method.
* Using the [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx position#addvector|position:addvector()]] method.
* Using the [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx frame#to|frame:to()]] method.
* Using the [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx frame#from|frame:from()]] method.
* Using the {{Celx:v160}} [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx phase#getposition|phase:getposition()]] method.


'''Notes:'''
# Position components (X,Y,Z) in Celestia are stored in millionths of a light year. So when you have your own positions defined in km or miles, you have to convert these positions. Therefore, you can use a constant, which must be initialized first within your script:
#* From km to millionths of a light year, use a constant uly_to_km = 9460730.4725808.
#* From miles to millionths of a light year, use a constant uly_to_mls = 5912956.5453630.
# Next you can convert km or miles to millionths of a light year as follows: 
#* millionths_of_a_light_year = ''number:km'' / uly_to_km 
#* millionths_of_a_light_year = ''number:miles'' / uly_to_mls
# Internally &quot;position&quot; objects use 128 bit per component and therefore have higher precision than available directly in Lua (which typically uses 64-bit IEEE754 double precision floating point numbers). The calculations that you can perform however on a &quot;position&quot; object are limited, so you'll often want to convert &quot;position&quot; objects to normal Lua numbers.&lt;br&gt;In order &lt;u&gt;to avoid precision problems&lt;/u&gt;, the usual practice is to convert a &quot;position&quot; object to a &quot;vector&quot; object, relative to the origin (such as the Sun or Solar System Barycenter). You can do this by subtracting the origin's position from the object- or observer position to get a &quot;vector&quot; object like this:

 -- Get a vector giving the heliocentric position of the Earth
 function earthpos(jd)
    local sun = celestia:find(&quot;Sol&quot;)
    local earth = celestia:find(&quot;Sol/Earth&quot;)
    return earth:getposition(jd) - sun:getposition(jd)
 end

== Operators ==

&quot;Position&quot; objects can be added and subtracted from each other.&lt;br&gt;It is also possible to add a &quot;postion&quot; object with a &quot;vector&quot; object, or subtract a &quot;vector&quot; object from a &quot;postion&quot; object.

* position + vector → position
* position + position → position
* position - position → vector
* position - vector → position

'''Note:'''Subtracting two &quot;position&quot; objects produces a &quot;vector&quot; object and '''NOT''' a &quot;position&quot; object.

== Members ==

You can access and assign the x, y, and z components of a &quot;position&quot; object directly, e.g.

 earth = celestia:find(&quot;Sol/Earth&quot;)
 earthpos = earth:getposition() 
 ep_x = earthpos.x
 ep_y = earthpos.y
 ep_z = earthpos.z

 obs = celestia:getobserver()
 obspos = obs:getposition()
 obspos.x = 1
 obspos.y = 0
 obspos.x = 0
 obs = celestia:setpostion(obspos)

'''Note:''' Accessing components this way returns normal Lua numbers, which have less precision than the 128-bit values stored in a &quot;position&quot; object.

== Methods ==

This chapter contains a list of all available position methods, which can be used on &quot;position&quot; objects.

=== addvector ===

position {{Celx:func|position:addvector}}({{Celx:arg|vector:vec}})

Add a vector to the position and return the result as a &quot;position&quot; object.

{{Celx:argdesc|
;vec: The vector to be added to the position. Must be a &quot;vector&quot; object.
}}

'''Notes:'''
# You can also use '''position = position + vector''' instead of this '''position:addvector()''' method. Both have the same result.
# Like position components, the vector components (X,Y,Z) in Celestia are also stored in millionths of a light year.
# A CELX &quot;position&quot; object contains the exact coordinates of a point in space. A position is relative to a coordinate system and may need to be converted to or from universal coordinates before further use.
# The [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx position|position]] methods can be used on a CELX &quot;position&quot; object. &quot;Position&quot; objects can also be used in other methods, requiring a &quot;position&quot; object as an argument.

'''Example:'''&lt;br&gt;Goto a position in space just beside the path where Earth will be over 1 day. Look from that position at Earth and see how Earth comes towards you and just misses you (time is sped up 3600x).

 -- Find and select Earth
 earth = celestia:find(&quot;Sol/Earth&quot;)
 celestia:select(earth)
 obs = celestia:getobserver()
 -- Set frame of reference to &quot;universal&quot;.
 obs:setframe(celestia:newframe(&quot;universal&quot;))
 -- Determine the actual position of Earth  
 now = celestia:gettime()
 posearth = earth:getposition(now)
 -- Determine and goto new observer position, to just miss Earth within 1 day
 newpos = earth:getposition(now+1)
 vec = celestia:newvector(0, 0, 0.002)
 newpos = newpos:addvector(vec)
 obs:goto(newpos,1.0)
 wait(0.0)
 -- Look at Earth and see how it comes towards you
 upvec = celestia:newvector(0,1,0)
 obs:lookat(newpos, posearth, upvec)
 celestia:settimescale(3600)
 obs:track(earth)

&lt;br&gt;[[Celestia/Celx_Scripting/CELX_Lua_Methods#position|&lt;u&gt;Return to the '''position''' method index.&lt;/u&gt;]]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

=== vectorto ===

vector {{Celx:func|position:vectorto}}({{Celx:arg|position:target}})

Return the &quot;vector&quot; object, pointing from this position to the target position.

{{Celx:argdesc|
;target: The target position the vector should be pointing to. Must be a &quot;position&quot; object.
}}

'''Notes:'''
# You can also use '''vector = position target - position source''' instead of this '''position:vectorto()''' method. Both have the same result. 
# The precision of a vector (IEEE754 double precision floating point) may be insufficient to express this distance exactly.
# A CELX &quot;vector&quot; object is a geometric object that has both a length and direction [X, Y, Z] in a 3 dimensional coordinate system.
# The [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx vector|vector]] methods can be used on a CELX &quot;vector&quot; object. &quot;Vector&quot; objects can also be used in other methods, requiring a &quot;vector&quot; object as an argument.

'''Example:'''&lt;br&gt;Get a vector, giving the heliocentric position of the Earth

 now = celestia:gettime()
 sunpos = celestia:find(&quot;Sol&quot;):getposition(now)
 earthpos = celestia:find(&quot;Sol/Earth&quot;):getposition(now)
 heliovector = sunpos:vectorto(earthpos)

&lt;br&gt;[[Celestia/Celx_Scripting/CELX_Lua_Methods#position|&lt;u&gt;Return to the '''position''' method index.&lt;/u&gt;]]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

=== distanceto ===

number {{Celx:func|position:distanceto}}({{Celx:arg|position:target}})

Return the distance in kilometers from this position to the target position, as a number.

{{Celx:argdesc|
;target: The target position the distance must be calculated to. Must be a &quot;position&quot; object.
}}

'''Example:'''&lt;br&gt;Determine and display the actual distance from the obserber to Neptune.

 now = celestia:gettime()
 neptunepos = celestia:find(&quot;Sol/Neptune&quot;):getposition(now)
 obs = celestia:getobserver()
 obspos = obs:getposition()
 distance = obspos:distanceto(neptunepos)
 celestia:print(&quot;The center of Neptune is &quot; .. distance .. &quot; km away&quot;, 10.0, -1, -1, 2, 4)
 wait(10.0)

&lt;br&gt;[[Celestia/Celx_Scripting/CELX_Lua_Methods#position|&lt;u&gt;Return to the '''position''' method index.&lt;/u&gt;]]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

=== orientationto ===

rotation {{Celx:func|position:orientationto}}({{Celx:arg|position:target, vector:up}})

Return a &quot;rotation&quot; object which can be used to orient a viewer to point from this position toward the target position.

{{Celx:argdesc|
;target: The target position at which the viewer should focus on. Must be a &quot;position&quot; object.
;up: The up vector, defining which axis should be pointing up. Must be a &quot;vector&quot; object.&lt;br&gt;Must not be parallel to the target direction, otherwise the rotation is undefined.
}}

'''Notes:'''
# A CELX &quot;rotation&quot; object is internally a Quaternion, which is one possibility to mathematically describe a rotation in 3 dimensions (i.e. it can be converted to a rotation matrix). A rotation can also be used to describe the orientation of objects or the observer (i.e. where the observer is looking to, and where &quot;up&quot; is).
# The [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx rotation|rotation]] methods can be used on a CELX &quot;rotation&quot; object. &quot;Rotation&quot; objects can also be used in other methods, requiring a &quot;rotation&quot; object as an argument.

'''Example:'''&lt;br&gt;Goto a position just beside Mars and orient the observer towards the planet.

 obs = celestia:getobserver()
 -- Set frame of reference to &quot;universal&quot;.
 obs:setframe(celestia:newframe( &quot;universal&quot;))
 -- Find the actual position of Mars.
 mars = celestia:find(&quot;Sol/Mars&quot;)
 marspos = mars:getposition()
 -- Calculate new position just far away from Mars.
 newpos = marspos + celestia:newvector(0, 0, 0.002)
 obs:goto(newpos, 0.0)
 wait(0.0)
 -- view towards Mars and follow the planet
 rotation = newpos:orientationto(marspos, celestia:newvector(0, 1, 0))
 obs:setorientation(rotation)
 obs:follow(mars)

&lt;br&gt;[[Celestia/Celx_Scripting/CELX_Lua_Methods#position|&lt;u&gt;Return to the '''position''' method index.&lt;/u&gt;]]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

=== getx ===

number {{Celx:func|position:getx()}}

Return the X coordinate of the position as a number.

'''Notes:'''
# The precision is returned as a double-precision floating point value and may not have sufficient precision to express the exact position.

'''Example:'''&lt;br&gt; Get the actual position of Earth and display the X-, Y- and Z-components of that position in the lower left corner of the screen.

=='''Sucrose'''==

[[File:Sugar 2xmacro.jpg|thumbnail|table sugar]]

==='''Introduction'''===

Sucrose also known as table sugar is one of the few natural chemicals consumed in pure form (other examples are H2O and NaCl). Its average annual consumption is 175 pounds per person in the United States. Table sugar is isolated from sugar cane and sugar beets where it is roughly 14-20% of the weight making it easily extracted. The world production of sugar is around 150 million tons per year.

===''' Disaccharide Structure'''===

[[File:Saccharose2.svg|thumbnail|α-D-glucopyranose on the left and β-D-fructofuranose on the right]]

Sucrose is not a simple monosaccharide, but a disaccharide composed of two units, glucose and fructose. The structure of sucrose can be deduced from its chemical behavior. Acid hydrolysis will split the molecule into glucose and fructose. Sucrose is a nonreducing sugar meaning it does not have an aldehyde group or is capable of forming one through isomerism. Sucrose also does not form osazones or undergo mutarotation. These findings suggest that the component monosaccharide units are linked by an acetal bridge connecting the two anomeric carbons. X-ray structural analysis confirms this hypothesis: Sucrose is a disaccharide in which the α-D-glucopyranose from of glucose is attached to β-D-fructofuranose in this way. Sucrose has a specific rotation of +66.5 and when treated with aqueous acid the rotaion will decrease to a value of -20. This same effect can be achieved using the enzyme invertase on sucrose. The phenomenon is known as the inversion of sucrose and is related to the mutarotation of monosaccharides. The inversion of sucrose includes three separate reactions: hydrolysis of itself to α-D-glucopyranose and β-D-fructofuranose, mutarotation of α-D-glucopyranose to the equilibrium mixture with the β
form, and mutarotation of β-D-fructofuranose to the more stable β-D-fructopyranose. Because the value for the rotation of fructose is -92 and the rotation value for glucose is +52.7, the net rotation is negative. This gives an &quot;invert sugar&quot; because it becomes inverted relative to the original solution.  

==='''Role of Sucrose when Exposed to Atrazine and Oxidative Stress'''===

Soluble sugars act as metabolite signaling molecules that activate specific or hormone-crosstalk transduction pathways, in addition to playing a central role in plant structure and metabolism. Research was conducted on the different roles of exogenous sucrose in Arabidopsis thaliana plantlets when exposed to the herbicide atrazine and oxidative  stress. A transcriptomic approach was utilized along with the employment of CATMAs (complete arabidopsis transcriptome microarrays).

Conditions of xenobiotic stress (stresses from natural substances that are foreign to the human body) and sucrose-induced tolerance in the presence of atrazine, of sucrose, and of sucrose plus atrazine were compared. This comparison displayed atrazine's effect on gene expression and, therefore, the physiology of seedlings. There was as well, due to the larger-than-anticipated impact of atrazine on seedling physiology, potential impairment of protein translation and of reactive-oxygen-species (ROS) defense mechanisms. In addition, there were significant modifications of gene expression pertaining to ROS defense, and repair mechanisms, when there was sucrose-induced protection against atrazine injury. These alterations resulted from the combined influences of sucrose and atrazine. This highlights the significance of the interactions between sucrose and xenobiotic signaling, or of sucrose and ROS signaling.

The resulting sucrose interactions produced characteristic differential expression of gene families including ascorbate peroxidases, glutathione-S-transferases and cytochrome P450s. Using these genes as molecular markers is expected to substantially progress future research of xenobiotic tolerance and phytoremediation (the use of certain plants to clean up soil, sediment, and water contaminated with metals and/or organic contaminants).

Comparative observations between the atrazine-induced stress situation and the sucrose-atrazine protection situation via the transcriptomic approach has provided new insight into xenobiotic-signaling pathways, xenobiotic tolerance pathways, and identifying novel xenobiotic tolerance pathways. Research conducted on these reactions, in environments containing high concentrations of atrazine, prior to the transcriptomic approach produced trivial data. 

Early TF and gene target studies involving sucrose-induced tolerance are expected to be more useful when investigating sugar-induced tolerances towards other xenobiotics. Sucrose has, as well, been proven to induce a tolerance towards other xenobiotics.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This tutorial will teach you how to get IIS working with FastCGI, and Perl. We will be using [http://search.cpan.org/~cosmicnet/FCGI-IIS/ FCGI::IIS]. These steps should be followed in order. Further documentation on FCGI::IIS, can be found directly on [http://search.cpan.org/~cosmicnet/FCGI-IIS/lib/FCGI/IIS.pm CPAN].

== Install FCGI::IIS ==
;Strawberry Perl
: &lt;tt&gt;perl -MCPAN -e'install FCGI::IIS'&lt;/tt&gt;

;ActiveState

: &lt;tt&gt;ppm install FCGI&lt;/tt&gt; 
: &lt;tt&gt;ppm install http://www.cosmicscripts.com/modules/perl/FCGI-IIS.ppd&lt;/tt&gt; {{ref|cosmicscript}}

== Additions to fcgiext.ini ==
Add the following to the &lt;tt&gt;[Perl]&lt;/tt&gt; stanza:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ini&quot;&gt;
Arguments=&quot;-MFCGI::IIS=test&quot;
QueueLength=999
MaxInstances=20
InstanceMaxRequests=500
&lt;/source&gt;

Which should make the .ini file read something like:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ini&quot;&gt;
[Types]
pl=Perl

[Perl]
ExePath=C:\strawberry\perl\bin\perl.exe
Arguments=&quot;-MFCGI::IIS=test&quot;
QueueLength=999
MaxInstances=20
InstanceMaxRequests=500
&lt;/source&gt;

'''Notice FCGI::IIS=test''': this gets a test up and running. To develop or run production with FCGI::IIS, or after your test succeeds remove the FCGI::IIS. Further information can be found in [http://search.cpan.org/~cosmicnet/FCGI-IIS/lib/FCGI/IIS.pm FCGI::IIS] docs.
&lt;source lang=&quot;ini&quot;&gt;
Arguments=&quot;-MFCGI::IIS&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Restart website ==
To restart a website: Start &amp;rarr; Administrative Tools &amp;rarr; IIS &amp;rarr; Expand left panel to Websites &amp;rarr; Right click website ''Stop'' &amp;rarr; Right click website ''Start''.


From this point it should be easily to [[IIS_and_FastCGI/Scripting_languages/Perl/Catalyst|install Catalyst]] or whatever other perl framework you'd like.

== Footnotes ==

== phase ==

{{Celx:v160}} The phase class is NOT available until '''Celestia version 1.6.0'''.

The timeline of an object is subdivided into one or more phases.&lt;br&gt;Each phase has its own:
* trajectory;
* rotation model;
* orbit frame;
* body frame.

An object's phase(s) can be obtained in one of two ways:
* Using the {{Celx:v160}} [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx object#getphase|object:getphase()]] method, which returns the active phase at a specified time, or
* Using the {{Celx:v160}} [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx object#phases|object:phases()]] method, which returns an iterator over all of the phases in an object's timeline.

'''Example:'''&lt;br&gt;The timeline for the Huygens probe might have three phases:
# Attached to Cassini:
#* body fixed frame of Cassini;
#* trajectory is just a fixed position.
# Free flight after separation:
#* Saturn-centered frame;
#* trajectory from an xyz file or SPICE
# On the surface of Titan (default not implemented yet in Celestia {{Celx:v160}}):
#* Titan-fixed frame;
#* trajectory is a fixed position.

== Methods ==

This chapter contains a list of all available phase methods, which can be used on &quot;phase&quot; objects.

=== timespan ===

{{Celx:v160}} number, number {{Celx:func|phase:timespan()}}

Return the start and end times for this timeline phase as two TDB (Barycentric Dynamical Time) Julian date numbers.

'''Notes:'''
# The start time of a phase will always be equal to the end time of the previous phase.
# For a phase valid at any time, the start time and end time will be equal to the special floating point values -infinity and +infinity.
# The TDB time scale is a bit different from the more familiar UTC. By using TDB, Celestia places objects much more accurately. As of January 1, 2008, the difference between the two is about 65 seconds. For more information, see [[Celestia/Time_Scales]].
# To convert between UTC and TDB times, you can use the {{Celx:v150}} [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx celestia#utctotdb|celestia:utctotdb()]] and {{Celx:v150}} [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx celestia#tdbtoutc|celestia:tdbtoutc()]] methods.
# To convert between normal calender dates and julian days, you can use the [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx celestia#tojulianday|celestia:tojulianday()]] and [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx celestia#fromjulianday|celestia:fromjulianday()]] methods. 

'''Example:'''&lt;br&gt;Retrieve the start and end times of the phases of Cassini's timeline.

 object = celestia:find(&quot;Sol/Cassini&quot;)
 count = 0
 for phase in object:phases() do
    count = count + 1
    begintime, endtime = phase:timespan()
    celestia:print(&quot;Phase [&quot; .. count .. &quot;] of &quot; .. object:name() .. 
                   &quot;\nStart: &quot; .. begintime .. &quot; End: &quot; .. endtime, 5.0, -1, -1, 2, 4)
    wait(5.0)
 end

&lt;br&gt;[[Celestia/Celx_Scripting/CELX_Lua_Methods#phase|&lt;u&gt;Return to the '''phase''' method index.&lt;/u&gt;]]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

=== orbitframe ===

{{Celx:v160}} frame {{Celx:func|phase:orbitframe()}}

Return the orbit frame for this timeline phase, as a &quot;frame&quot; object.

'''Example:'''&lt;br&gt;Display orbit frame reference object of Huygens during Free flight after separation from Cassini.

 tdbtime = celestia:utctotdb(2005, 01, 01)
 celestia:settime(tdbtime)
 object = celestia:find(&quot;huygens&quot;)

                object:name() .. &quot; is: &quot; .. object2:name(), 10.0, -1, -1, 2, 4)
 wait(10.0)

&lt;br&gt;[[Celestia/Celx_Scripting/CELX_Lua_Methods#phase|&lt;u&gt;Return to the '''phase''' method index.&lt;/u&gt;]]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

=== bodyframe ===

{{Celx:v160}} frame {{Celx:func|phase:bodyframe()}}

Return the body frame for this timeline phase, as a &quot;frame&quot; object.

'''Example:'''&lt;br&gt;Display body frame reference object of Huygens during it flight on Cassini to Saturn.

 tdbtime = celestia:utctotdb(2004, 06, 01)
 celestia:settime(tdbtime)
 object = celestia:find(&quot;huygens&quot;)
 celestia:select(object)

 celestia:print(&quot;Body frame reference object during this phase of &quot; ..
                object:name() .. &quot; is: &quot; .. object2:name(), 10.0, -1, -1, 2, 4)
 wait(10.0)

&lt;br&gt;[[Celestia/Celx_Scripting/CELX_Lua_Methods#phase|&lt;u&gt;Return to the '''phase''' method index.&lt;/u&gt;]]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

=== getposition ===

{{Celx:v160}} position {{Celx:func|phase:getposition}}({{Celx:arg|number:time}})

Return the position &lt;u&gt;in frame coordinates&lt;/u&gt; at the specified time, as a &quot;position&quot; object.

{{Celx:argdesc|
;time: The time used to determine the position, as a TDB (Barycentric Dynamical Time) Julian date number.&lt;br&gt;A time outside the span covered by the phase are automatically clamped to either the beginning or ending of the span.
}}

'''Notes:'''
# Position components (X,Y,Z) in Celestia are stored in millionths of a light year. So when you want your positions defined in km or miles, you have to convert these positions. Therefore, you can use a constant, which must be initialized first within your script:
#* From millionths of a light year to km, use a constant uly_to_km = 9460730.4725808.
#* From millionths of a light year to miles, use a constant uly_to_mls = 5912956.5453630.
# Next you can convert millionths of a light year to km or miles as follows: 
#* km =  ''number:millionths_of_a_light_year'' * uly_to_km 
#* miles =  ''number:millionths_of_a_light_year'' * uly_to_mls 
# The [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx position|position]] methods can be used on a CELX &quot;position&quot; object. &quot;Position&quot; objects can also be used in other methods, requiring a &quot;position&quot; object as an argument.
# The TDB time scale is a bit different from the more familiar UTC. By using TDB, Celestia places objects much more accurately. As of January 1, 2008, the difference between the two is about 65 seconds. For more information, see [[Celestia/Time_Scales]].

'''Notes:'''
# The [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx rotation|rotation]] methods can be used on a CELX &quot;rotation&quot; object. &quot;Rotation&quot; objects can also be used in other methods, requiring a &quot;rotation&quot; object as an argument.
# The TDB time scale is a bit different from the more familiar UTC. By using TDB, Celestia places objects much more accurately. As of January 1, 2008, the difference between the two is about 65 seconds. For more information, see [[Celestia/Time_Scales]].
# To convert between UTC and TDB times, you can use the {{Celx:v150}} [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx celestia#utctotdb|celestia:utctotdb()]] and {{Celx:v150}} [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx celestia#tdbtoutc|celestia:tdbtoutc()]] methods.

Hi, I'm from Jakarta. The term Nasi Gurih does not ring a bell with any dish here. There's Nasi Uduk, which is kind of similar with Nasi Lemak or Hainam Rice without ginger.
Which area of Indonesia does Nasi Gurih comes from?

#[[Metabolomics/Metabolites/Lipids/Steroids/Cholesterol| Cholesterol]]

='''Steroids'''=

Steroid is a chemical name for any substance that has a characteristic chemical structure consisting of multiple rings of connected atoms. Vitamin D, cholesterol, estrogen,
and cortisone are some examples of steroids. Various steroids have important roles in the body’s reproductive system and the structure and function of membranes. It has been discovered
that steroids can be active in the brain, where they affect the nervous system. Some steroids are used as anesthetics. Douglas Covey of Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, has uncovered new roles for several of these neurosteroids, which alter electrical activity in the brain. Covey’s research shows that neurosteroids can either activate or tone down receptors that communicate the message of a neurotransmitter called gammaaminobutyrate, or GABA. The main job of this neurotransmitter is to dampen electrical activity throughout the brain. Covey and other scientists have found that steroids that activate the receptors for GABA decrease brain activity even more, making these steroids good candidates for anesthetic medicines. Covey is also investigating the potential of neuroprotective steroids in preventing the nerve-wasting effects of certain neurodegenerative disorders.

=== Progesterone and Estrogen ===
[[Image:Progesterone-2D-skeletal.png|right|thumb|200px|Progesterone]]
[[Image:Estriol v2.png|right|thumb|250px|Estriol form of Estrogen]]
The neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects of progesterone and estrogen have been confirmed to support reproductive and cognitive health. These steroids have recently been proven to also regulate metabolic processes, in order to meet specific energetic requirements for cognitive maintenance. Fully comprehending this metabolic control necessitated interpreting signals from a variety of environmental sources that were integrated by receptor-mediated responses that converged upon mitochondrial function. Research involved treating ovariectomized rats with progesterone (P4), 17 -estradiol (E2) or E2+P4, and functionally assessing isolated whole brain mitochondria, in order to determine the effects of P4 and E2 on metabolic control. The brain mitochondria of the hormone treated rats exhibited enhanced functional efficiency and increased metabolic rates. In addition, the same mitochondria displayed an increase in respiratory function that was coupled to an increase in expression, and electron transport chain complex IV activity (cytochrome c oxidase). The enhanced mitochondrial efficiency was a result of this increased respiratory activity that was accompanied by a decreased rate of reactive oxygen leak, and reduced lipid peroxidation.

Exclusive administration of E2 to the mitochondria resulted in a significant increase in complex IV (COX) activity. Specifically, brain mitochondria treated with E2 were prevented from ethanol withdrawal-induced declination of COX activity. In vitro studies exhibited a direct concentration dependent interaction between estrogens and ATPase activity; an increase in estrogen concentration raised ATPase activity, and a decrease in estrogen concentration lowered ATPase activity. By consequence, ATP levels and oxidative stresses were determined to be directly dependent upon the interaction of steroids with oligomycin-sensitivity conferring proteins (OSCP), which act as the binding sites for E2, in the mitochondria. Treatment of the mitochondria with E2 also resulted in lower levels of lipid peroxidation at a constant rate of H2O2 production. This indicated an increase in cellular antioxidant defenses. Furthermore, tightly coordinated regulation of mtDNA and nDNA encoded in mitochondrial genes made it impossible to identify whether or not hormones act at a nuclear site to regulate COXIV in order to increase COXI, II, and III expression, or vice versa, as a result of E2 and P4 acting at both sites. Despite this, all attempts to analyze combined effects of P4 and E2 resulted in a substantial decrease in mitochondrial response. In summation, mitochondrial alterations in the central nervous system that were induced by ovarian hormonal replacements induced efficient and balanced bioenergetics that reduced oxidative stress, and the occurrence of endogenous oxidative damage.

Main focus of the resource: A well-defined explanation of steroids and their uses in metabolic 
systems; includes information on steroid hormones structures, nomenclature and classification, as 
well as the biosynthesis pathways. In addition, this source demonstrates key ways the steroids are 
used as metabolites.

New terms: 
1. Androgenic- any substance, such as testosterone or androsterone that promotes male 
characteristics.

Connection to Course:
Steroids are essential in metabolic processes to elicit biological responses. Steroid metabolism is 
important in the production of hormones, and for the regulation of their cellular and physiological 
actions. An important function of the steroid hormones is to coordinate responses for specific 
biological purposes, such as reproduction and sex differences, which is the main focus of this 
article. Although we did not focus greatly on steroids and how they impact reproduction and sex 
differences it is still an important part of their impact on our body. In chapter 10, pg. 359 our 
course textbook briefly touches on this subject and how steroids are vital in communicating 
message to other bodily tissues.

Connection to Course:
In order to understand how chemical reactions occur in living organisms to maintain life we must 
begin to understand the chemicals themselves, therefore knowing the structures of steroids is 
essential to understanding their metabolic processes. In our studies it is vital to understand their 
structures so we can understand how they interact with other molecules in metabolic pathways, 
modulate cell function, or regulate metabolism.

Steroids regulate many aspect of metabolism by interacting with our immune function, our 
response to receptors to increase synthesis; they adjust fluidity of the cell membrane, and are 
altogether vital to how our body functions. This website gives an insight to the breakdown of how 
these processes work and how steroids play this critical role. In studying steroids we have taken a 
close look at cholesterol and how it interact with the cell membrane of tissues, this is because it 
plays such an important role in biochemical possesses.

Main focus of the resource: 
In this study researchers look at ovarian hormones and their neurotrophic effects on reproductive 
function and cognitive health. They did this by studying these steroids ability to regulate 
metabolic functions in rats. From this study they observed brain mitochondria from hormone-
treated rats displayed enhanced functional efficiency and increased metabolic rates. 

New terms: 
1. Myocardium- the muscular substance of the heart..
2. Ovariectomized- to surgically remove an ovary from

Connection to Course:
This article demonstrates how vital the mitochondria, which regulates the energy balance of the 
cell, is to our body and how steroids can impact it. Steroids that impact the mitochondria can in 
turn impact many specialized physiological functions of the cell. In the study of steroids we have 
seen in this course how steroid hormones have the ability do so and an example of this would be 
how progesterone, and ovarian hormone, can provide nerve function and healing by regulating 
myelin.

Article General Description:
B. Progesterone and Estrogen Regulation Oxidative Metabolism in the Brain Mitochondria
http://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/hypres/30/11/30_1029/_article

Main focus of the resource: 
In this study researchers are examining the fact that human populations show a strong correlation 
between dietary cholesterol intake and coronary heart disease due to its effects on plasma low 
density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Due to the response to a given intake of cholesterol 
varying among different species and even in individuals of the same species, this study looks at 
the mechanisms responsible for differing sensitivity. This was performed by comparing rats, 
which is able to adapt to fluctuations, with hamsters, who where more sensitive to changes in 
LDL levels. From this study they observed that the response to dietary cholesterol in these two 
species spans the range of individual responses observed in humans.

New terms:

      <text xml:space="preserve">Writing programs for the Khepera III robot is pretty straightforward. Nevertheless, a good program structure and doing things right the first time will save you time - a lot of time! In this chapter, we therefore discuss a couple of design choices when implementing such programs.

== General Structure of a Program ==

=== A Simple Program with One State ===

A simple program will have the following structure:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
// Program initialization
commandline_init();
...
commandline_parse(argc, argv);
...
khepera3_init();

// Algorithm initialization
algorithm.configuration.wall_threshold = 1000;
...
khepera3_drive_start();

// Main loop
while (true) {
    // Read sensors
    khepera3_infrared_proximity();
    ...

    // Calculate actuator response
    speed_left = ...
    speed_right = ...

    // Termination condition
    if (...) {
        break;
    }

    // Set actuators
    khepera3_drive_set_speed(speed_left, speed_right);
    ...

    // Sleep for a while
    usleep(algorithm.configuration.wait_us);
}

// Algorithm termination/cleanup if necessary
khepera3_drive_set_speed(0, 0)
&lt;/source&gt;

Most programs consist of a main loop which is executed after an initialization phase. The main loop implements the so-called perception-to-action loop - the loop which reads the sensor values, derives the action to take, and sets the actuators (motors) accordingly. The main loop sometimes also contains a termination condition which quits the program as soon as the goal has been reached.

If you are looking at the code of existing programs (e.g. motion_followline), you will notice that the above structure implemented in different functions. Typically, the structure is broken up into the following functions
* ''help'': Prints a help text.
* ''algorithm_init'': Initializes the algorithm.
* ''algorithm_run'': Executes the main loop.
* ''main'': Initializes the program and calls the above functions.

In addition, a structure holding the configuration and the state (if necessary) of the algorithm is defined:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
// Algorithm configuration and state variables
struct sAlgorithm {
    struct {
        int wall_threshold;
        ...
        int verbosity;
    } configuration;
    struct {
        int remaining_targets;
        ...
    } state;
};

// Declare an instance of that structure
struct sAlgorithm algorithm;

// Access to the variables
algorithm.configuration.wall_threshold = ...
algorithm.state.remaining_targets = ...
&lt;/source&gt;
Even if this looks complicated at first sight, using this nested structure has two advantages. First of all, all algorithm variables are declared in one place. If you want to reuse that algorithm somewhere else, you see at a glance which variables are needed. Second, the classification into configuration variables and state variables will help you implementing the algorithm in a clean way. Configuration variables will only be written during the initialization phase and should only be read in the main loop. State variables, however, are read and written in the main loop.

=== Programs with Multiple States ===

Often, programs have more than one state. A robot engaged in a search task, for instance, will maybe have an exploration state in which it walks randomly around, and a gradient following state in which it tries to move towards the target.

The simplest way to implement that is with different main loops, i.e. one main loop per state. A code skeleton for that looks as follows (note that the template program created by the [[Khepera III Toolbox/The Toolbox/Scripts|''k3-create-program'' script]] uses exactly this skeleton):

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
// Algorithm variables
struct sAlgorithm {
    ...
    struct {
        void (*hook)(); // Pointer to the current state function
        ...
    } state;
};

// Forward declaration of states
void state_exploration();
void state_gradient_follow();
void state_success();

// Algorithm initialization
void algorithm_init() {
    ...

    // Set the initial state
    algorithm.state.hook = state_exploration;
}

// The algorithm just switches from state to state by calling the current state function
void algorithm_run() {
    while (1) {
        algorithm.state.hook();
    }
}

void state_exploration() {
    // State initialization
    ...

    // Main loop
    while (1) {
        // Read sensors
        ...
    
        // State change condition
        if (...) {
            algorithm.state.hook = state_gradient_follow;  // Switch to the gradient follow state
            return;
        }

        // Set actuators
        ...

        // Sleep for a while
        usleep(algorithm.configuration.wait_us);
    }
}

void state_gradient_follow() {
    // State initialization
    ...

    // Main loop
    while (1) {
        // Read sensors
        ...
    
        // State change condition
        if (...) {
            algorithm.state.hook = state_exploration;  // Switch to the exploration state
            return;
        }

        // Termination condition
        if (...) {
            algorithm.state.hook = state_success;  // Switch to the success state, which terminates the program
            return;
        }

        // Set actuators
        ...

        // Sleep for a while
        usleep(algorithm.configuration.wait_us);
    }
}

void state_success() {
    // We are done
    exit(0);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Do not fear the function pointer (&lt;tt&gt;algorithm.state.hook&lt;/tt&gt;)! Its declaration may look complicated, but it is very easy to use, as you can see in the state functions above. Adding, moving or removing states becomes extremely easy, as you can treat a state as one contiguous block of code. In case the robot does not behave as desired in one particular state, you can modify its code without hurting other states (which is typically the case if you put everything in one main loop with a series of ''if'''s).

Moreover, if you draw your algorithm as a state machine on a paper first, you can implement the code right away following exactly the schema on your paper. Each state will correspond to one function, and each arrow to one state change condition.

== Stability and Execution Speed ==

From your [[w:Control theory|control theory]] course, you probably know that the perception-to-action loop has to run at a certain minimum frequency such that the stability criterion is fulfilled. On the other hand, running that loop at higher speed also consumes more energy.

The speed of the perception-to-action loop shown in the code examples above is determined by three factors:
* The communication overhead, i.e. the time required to read the sensors and set the actuators.
* The processing overhead, i.e. the time required to derive the ''action'' from the current ''perception''.
* The waiting time (&lt;tt&gt;usleep(algorithm.configuration.wait_us)&lt;/tt&gt;), which can be adjusted at will.

The communication overhead can only be optimized up to some point. There is a hard limit on the number of bytes you need to transfer between the robot and the Korebot board (processor board) to get a certain piece of information, and the communication channel (I2C bus) has a fixed speed of roughly 10 KB/s. Hence, a call to the ''khepera3_infrared_proximity'' function to obtain infrared proximity sensor values will return after about 3.1 ms (if the I2C bus is free), as it has to transfer 31 bytes from and to the microcontroller. The number of bytes transferred by each function can be found in the '''.h''' files of the [[Khepera III Toolbox/The Toolbox/Modules/khepera3|khepera3 module]].

Similarly, a certain amount of operations will be necessary for deriving the action given the sensor readings and the current state. Basic mathematical operations are fast as compared to the communication overhead, but making extensive use of ''log'', ''exp'' or trigonometric functions will slow down the main loop. In addition, everything that has to be written to, or read from disk will involve substantial overhead as well. Last but not least, the &lt;tt&gt;printf&lt;/tt&gt; can severly slow down your program depending on where the output is redirected.

While the communication overhead can be accurately calculated, the processing overhead needs to be measured in the environment the program is running (e.g. with stdout redirected to where it will be redirected for the real experiments). The waiting time can then be adjusted to achieve the desired perception-to-action loop frequency.

== To Thread or Not To Thread ==

Whether to use threads or not is a huge debate in computer science. The Khepera III Toolbox does not force you to use or not use threads, but it has been written with the idea in mind that most programs won't be multithreaded.

If you are using the code skeleton provided above, you will naturally not use threads (or a single thread, if you want). This makes sense, considering that there is not much to parallelize: the robot can only be in one state at a time, and the inside of a perception-to-action loop has to be executed in a precise order.

=== Asynchronous IO and the ''select'' Syscall ===

When writing programs that are waiting for some data to arrive on open filehandles, the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_I/O ''select'' syscall] will be useful. This syscall takes a list of filehandles, and returns if either data is available on one of them, or a timeout has occurred. The ''select'' syscall is the solution to most problems where programmers think they need threads.

As an example for this, have a look at the [[Khepera III Toolbox/The Toolbox/Programs|''motion_arrowkeys'' program]], which waits (in an non-blocking fashion) for user input on the standard input and executes the main loop at the same time.

=== Using Threads anyway ===

If - for one reason or another - you need go for multiple threads, some care has to be taken when accessing the robot sensors and actuators. Basically, you are not allowed to access the ''khepera3'' module or the ''i2cal'' module in a concurrent way, as these modules use statically allocated variables and are therefore not thread-safe. There are two solutions to that:
# Design your program in such a way that only the main thread (or another dedicated thread) is accessing these modules. This is straightforward in some cases, but can get extremely complicated in other situations.
# Synchronize all calls to the ''khepera3'' module and all ''i2cal'' transactions. They need to be synchronized with the same mutex, as the ''khepera3'' module uses the ''i2cal'' module to communicate with the sensors, i.e. a most ''khepera3'' functions are transactions on the I2C bus.

In case you wonder: the current implementation is intentionally not thread-safe, since that would make the function calls more complicated and more error-prone for single-threaded applications. In the future, however, a thread-safe implementation may be added (e.g. as a separate module).

== Splitting Up Algorithms into Independent Parts ==

Just as we break down the implementation of algorithms into functions that implement one state each, we could also split them up into different programs that implement a subset of the states each, and execute them the right order. This works, and is actually a very good technique in many situations!

=== The Maze Traversal Example ===

Assume you want to test different algorithms to traverse a maze. The maze entrance is on the left, and the exit on the right side of your arena. Since you want to run the experiment several times, you want your robot to automatically go back to the entrance once it has reached the exit, e.g. by following a line on the ground. You could of course add a new state (''state_go_back_to_entrance'') to all your algorithms, and switch to that state when the exit has been reached. However, you could also implement this as a separate program (''maze_go_back_to_entrance'') which you call immediately after any of your maze traversing programs.

=== Overhead and Speed Considerations ===

There is some processing overhead in starting and quitting programs, but from an operating system point of view, this overhead is small. You should be careful about your initialization phase, though. For instance, if you have to load big files (e.g. maps, ...) at program start, this may introduce some significant delay. In addition, if you launch your programs remotely over a WLAN connection, there is a small transmission delay (~ 10 ms) to take into account.

=== Splitting Rules ===

There is no definite answer on when to split and how much to implement in the same program. However, here are a couple of thoughts:
* Do split if this helps you testing and debugging individual parts of your algorithm.
* Do split if this avoids having exactly the same pieces of code in several programs (as in the maze traversal example above).
* Do split if you think you can reuse at least one part somewhere else.
* Do split if the two parts have nothing in common.
* Do not split if the transition is complex (e.g. multiple target states possible)
* Do not split if the precise timings or low delays are an issue. 
* Do not split if the two parts share state variables or a lot of data.

In addition, it is usually preferred to implement an algorithm to run exactly once, and then quit. If want to test your algorithm in multiple runs, simply launch that program multiple times (with a script, for example) and redirect the output to a different file each time. This approach is much more flexible and robust.

=== Code Examples ===

The [[Khepera III Toolbox/Examples/measure_real_speed|measure_real_speed]] example uses a script to run the same program multiple times with different parameters.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want to display a repeated set of URLs in a section of your form. Each URL is created by concatenating a base URL and a URL parameter.

== Method ==
The equivalent of the HTML anchor tag (&lt;a&gt;) in an XForms application is the &lt;xf:load&gt; element.

If in a web page, you want your output to appear like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;links&quot;&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.example.com/myservice.xq?id=1&quot;&gt;One&lt;/a&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.example.com/myservice.xq?id=2&quot;&gt;Two&lt;/a&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.example.com/myservice.xq?id=3&quot;&gt;Three&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

in an XForms application each anchor will be xf:load.

Your input instance is like the following:
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;xf:instance id=&quot;link-items&quot; xmlns=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;data&gt;
   &lt;item&gt;
      &lt;id&gt;1&lt;id&gt;
      &lt;label&gt;One&lt;/label&gt;
   &lt;/item&gt;
   &lt;item&gt;
      &lt;id&gt;2&lt;id&gt;
      &lt;label&gt;Two&lt;/label&gt;
   &lt;/item&gt;
   &lt;item&gt;
      &lt;id&gt;3&lt;id&gt;
      &lt;label&gt;Three&lt;/label&gt;
   &lt;/item&gt;
&lt;/data&gt;
&lt;/xf:instance&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Discussion ==

With XForms it is not possible to create dynamic links inside a repeat using a combination of '''output''', '''value''' and '''concat'''.  This would also impact the ability to notify the user that is navigating away from a form.

There are two ways to display a list of links.  Both use a trigger with the button appearance turned off.  The first uses a load after setting a temporary instance.  The second uses a submit/submission combination.

== Using load ==
You can also use the load element as the element.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;xf:instance id=&quot;URL-container&quot; xmlns=&quot;&quot;&gt;
   &lt;URL/&gt;
&lt;/xf:instance&gt;
  &lt;!-- ... --&gt;
  &lt;xf:trigger appearance=&quot;minimal&quot;&gt;
    &lt;xf:label&gt;One&lt;/xf:label&gt;
    &lt;xf:action ev:event=&quot;DOMActivate&quot;&gt;
      &lt;xf:setvalue ref=&quot;instance('URL-container')&quot;
                   value=&quot;concat('http://www.example.com/my-view.xq?id=', id)&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;xf:load ref=&quot;instance('URL-container')&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/xf:action&gt;
  &lt;/xf:trigger&gt; 
&lt;xf:instance&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Link to XForms Application ===

[http://xforms-examples.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/03-output/links-in-output.xhtml Load XForms Application]

=== Sample Program ===
The following program displays a list of links in a horizontal row.  Each link has a label and a URL suffix that is extracted from an instance document.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;html xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot; 
   xmlns:ev=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events&quot; 
   xmlns:xsd=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema&quot; 
   xmlns:xf=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2002/xforms&quot;&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Displaying Links in an XForms Application&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;
          @namespace xf url(&quot;http://www.w3.org/2002/xforms&quot;);
          body {font-family:Helvetica, sans-serif}
          .links xf|repeat * {display: inline;}
          .url {color: blue; text-decoration:underline; margin: 0 2px;}
       &lt;/style&gt;
        &lt;xf:model&gt;
            &lt;xf:instance xmlns=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;links&quot;&gt;
                &lt;data&gt;
                    &lt;link&gt;
                        &lt;label&gt;XForms&lt;/label&gt;
                        &lt;wikipedia-id&gt;XForms&lt;/wikipedia-id&gt;

                    &lt;link&gt;
                        &lt;label&gt;XML Database&lt;/label&gt;
                        &lt;wikipedia-id&gt;XML_database&lt;/wikipedia-id&gt;

                    &lt;/link&gt;
                &lt;/data&gt;
            &lt;/xf:instance&gt;
            &lt;xf:instance id=&quot;URL-container&quot; xmlns=&quot;&quot;&gt;
                &lt;URL /&gt;
            &lt;/xf:instance&gt;
        &lt;/xf:model&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;Displaying Links in an XForms Application&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;links&quot;&gt;
            &lt;xf:repeat nodeset=&quot;instance('links')/link&quot; id=&quot;link-repeat&quot;&gt;
                &lt;xf:trigger submission=&quot;replace-form-with&quot; appearance=&quot;minimal&quot; class=&quot;url&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;xf:label&gt;
                        &lt;xf:output ref=&quot;label&quot; /&gt;
                    &lt;/xf:label&gt;
                    &lt;xf:hint&gt;
                        &lt;xf:output ref=&quot;wikipedia-id&quot; /&gt;
                    &lt;/xf:hint&gt;
                    &lt;xf:action ev:event=&quot;DOMActivate&quot;&gt;
                        &lt;xf:setvalue ref=&quot;instance('URL-container')&quot; value=&quot;concat('http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/', instance('links')/link[index('link-repeat')]/wikipedia-id)&quot; /&gt;
                        &lt;xf:load ref=&quot;instance('URL-container')&quot; /&gt;
                    &lt;/xf:action&gt;
                &lt;/xf:trigger&gt;
            &lt;/xf:repeat&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Acknowledgment ==
This solution was posted to the Mozilla XForms development newsgroup by John Clark on February 27th, 2008.

== Using Submit and Submission for Links ==
As an alternative strategy you can replace a form by using the submission statement with a replace=&quot;all&quot; attribute.  You can then style the submission button using appearance=&quot;minimal&quot; and make the button look like a link:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
   &lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;
   @namespace xf url(&quot;http://www.w3.org/2002/xforms&quot;);
   .url {color: blue; text-decoration:underline; margin: 0 2px;}
   &lt;/style&gt;
   ...
   &lt;xf:submission id=&quot;replace-form-with&quot; method=&quot;get&quot;
      ref=&quot;instance('link-items')/item[index('link-repeat')]/id&quot;
          action=&quot;http://www.example.com/my-view.xq&quot; 
          replace=&quot;all&quot; /&gt;
   ...
   &lt;xf:repeat nodeset=&quot;instance('link-items')/item&quot; id=&quot;link-repeat&quot;&gt;
   &lt;xf:submit submission=&quot;replace-form-with&quot; appearance=&quot;minimal&quot; class=&quot;url&quot;&gt;
        &lt;xf:label&gt;&lt;xf:output ref=&quot;label&quot;/&gt;&lt;/xf:label&gt;
   &lt;/xf:submit&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

The only disadvantage of this solution over using standard links is that the URL does not display in the status bar.  This problem can be mitigated by using the xf:hint element within the label.  This text will display when the user hovers over the link.

This method also allows you to interrupt the submission, check for changes in instance data and display warning messages before a form is unloaded.

Before you begin to study declension patterns, it is useful to look over this chart:

Hard consonants may change according to this table into their soft counterparts. Examples:

:'sky' — '''Nominative''': ''niebo'', '''Locative''': ''w niebie''
:'brother' — '''Nominative''': ''brat'', '''Locative''': ''o bracie''
:'river' — '''Nominative''': ''rzeka'', '''Locative''': ''o rzece''
:'leg' — '''Nominative''': ''noga'', '''Locative''': ''na nodze''
:'bicycle' — '''Nominative''': ''rower'', '''Locative''': ''na rowerze''
:'hell' — '''Nominative''': ''piekło'', '''Locative''': ''w piekle''
:'Warsaw' — '''Nominative''': ''Warszawa'', '''Locative''': ''w Warszawie''

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Screenshots in Trainz==
{{TOCright}}
This page discusses taking screenshots in Trainz which will have a different result between newer and older versions. Like many improvements, the change in {{TL|TS2009}} which switched over the default image production of screens generated by the software was one asked for by the user community. Trainz versions through {{TL|TC3}} (2008) generated {{Wp|.tga}} (Targa) files, which are sometimes called 'True Color Graphics files' since they sacrifice compression and compromises for clear high definition imagery and is the Trainz technology preferred underlying image format. Screenshots however are not generally used for asset generation and simulation of a 3D model inside game space, so the newer programs are different in that they automatically generate date and timestamped {{wp|.jpeg}} files familiar to digital camera owners the world over. 

Screenshots can be taken in Surveyor mode, Driver mode, Driver mode, Railyard mode by pressing the PrintScreen key, {{key press|Prt Sc}}. Trainz does not react to pressing {{key press|Prt Sc}} in the same way as most Windows programs: instead of storing a single screen image in the clipboard (the cut and paste buffer), for every press of {{key press|Prt Sc}} Trainz creates a [[wikipedia:Truevision TGA|TARGA]] image file (file extension .&lt;code&gt;tga&lt;/code&gt;) and stores it in Trainz's 'Screenshots' folder (for example &lt;code&gt;C:\Program Files\Auran\TRS2004\Screenshots\&lt;/code&gt; for TRS2004). These files are numbered sequentially like &lt;code&gt;Screen_001.tga&lt;/code&gt;. The normal Windows cut buffer will also receive an image which can be pasted into Microsoft Paint.exe and used to create a .bmp, .jpg, or .png as desired. 



===Tips for creating screenshots===
With either technology to take a screenshot you want to set up the picture. 
;Screenshots in Driver:
*If you are running in Driver and want a view of the 'action' you might care to hide the controls and just take a snapshot of the scenery. If so, you hide all screen displays in {{TL|Driver}} by pressing {{key press|F5}} to remove Trainz's on-screen overlays. To restore the overlays, press {{key press|F5}} again.
* Press '''{{key press|Alt|U}}''' in Surveyor mode to switch to 'look around' mode. This can be useful to get exact positioning of screenshots. All menus and the compass point are removed. Press {{key press|Esc}} to exit 'look around' mode.
* Press '''{{key press|Alt|Y}}''' in Surveyor mode to switch to 'walk around' mode. This is a great feature for making a close inspection of detail when model building in V-scale, but is quite useful for taking a screenshot. The mouse must be moved very gingerly as it becomes a bit hyperactive. This gives a view from the ground from which the height is not adjustable, but the viewpoint is by using the mouse to rotate the angle of view and the cursor arrow keys to move forward or back, as well as slide/side-step either right or left. 
* Experiment with increasing your screen resolution and then taking the shot. In an image editing program reduce to a suitable size.

===Manipulating screenshot images===

After closing Trainz, the TARGA files can be opened in an image processing program such as [[w:Irfanview |Irfanview]] or {{wp|GIMP}} where operations including the following can be performed:
* Cropping (removing unwanted parts of the image).
* Adjustment of the brightness/gamma, contrast, or RGB colour balance.
* Conversion to an image file format such as {{Wp|.jpg}} which will greatly reduce the file size, plus allow viewing the number of software.

For advanced image processing a more sophisticated program such as [[w:GIMP |GIMP]] or [[w:Adobe_Photoshop |PhotoShop]] can be used.

features=Causes explosion|

== Overview ==

'''''Expulso''''' appears to be one of the many spells, like [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Confringo|Confringo]], that causes things to explode.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

We see the Expulso curse being used only once. Shortly after [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] leave [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bill Weasley|Bill]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fleur Delacour|Fleur]]'s wedding, they stop in an overnight café on the Tottenham Court Road. There, they are attacked by a pair of Death Eaters. One of the Death Eaters uses this spell to blow up the table behind Harry, who is hidden under his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloak]], possibly in an attempt to jinx Harry that misses.

== Analysis ==

While we believe this spell to be a simple explosive, it is uncertain; we have seen in previous battles that curses that miss their target seem to explode when they reach solid objects.

== Overview ==

An '''''Imperturbable Charm''''', cast on a door or window, prevents approach to the door by anything.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

We first hear of this charm when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred and George]] are talking about trying to use their [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Extendable Ear|Extendable Ear]]s to listen in on meetings of the adult members of the Order. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]] tells them not to bother, there is an Imperturbable Charm on the door, and that she found this out by tossing Dungbombs at it: none of them had reached the door.

When the family goes to visit [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Arthur]] in the hospital for the first time after his injury, the adults there present, Arthur, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Molly Weasley]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Mad-Eye Moody]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nymphadora Tonks|Tonks]], send the youngsters out of the ward so they can have a quick discussion. Fred and George again produce Extendable Ears, saying that they hope nobody has thought to put an Imperturbable Charm on the door. It turns out nobody has.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 6|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']], when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] have followed [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]] to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Borgin and Burkes|Borgin and Burkes]], Ron produces Extendable Ears to allow them to listen in on what Draco is saying, and says that he hopes the store is not protected by an Imperturbable Charm.

name=Quick-Quotes Quill|

features=Transcription of what is thought by writer|
appearance=[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']]}}

== Overview ==

A '''''Quick-Quotes Quill''''' is a quill that automatically transcribes what is spoken in its presence.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

We first see this when it is produced by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rita Skeeter|Rita Skeeter]], when she is interviewing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]], immediately before the Weighing of the Wands ceremony. Rita's Quill is an acid-green, and she seems to like the flavour of it, as she sucks on the end of it briefly before setting it on the parchment.

We also find that it does not actually record accurately what is being said. This particular Quill seems to generate text that only vaguely resembles what is spoken, slanting it to make it sensational.

== Analysis ==

It is certain that this particular quill and Rita are very attuned, as the Quill seems to produce the sort of story, on its own, that Rita is famous for. One must wonder if the Quill can be tuned, however, as the story that Rita produces with, apparently, the exact same Quill in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 25|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']] seems to be written straight, when we see it published in ''[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/The Quibbler|The Quibbler]]''

== Overview ==

'''''Boomslang skin''''' is one of the components of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Polyjuice Potion|Polyjuice Potion]].

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

Boomslang skin is used rarely enough that it is not in the student supply cabinet with most other potion ingredients. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] determines that in order to make their Polyjuice Potion, she will have to sneak into [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]]'s office, and arranges a diversion, with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]]'s help.

When Boomslang skin turns up missing in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']], Snape accuses Harry privately of having stolen it.

A Boomslang is an actual creature, despite the exotic name; it is a venomous snake that is native to parts of Africa.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Like the primitives themselves, combinations of primitives are also
expressions. For example, suppose you have forgotten your times table
and aren't quite sure whether 8 times 7 is 54 or 56. We can ask Sway,
presenting the interpreter with the expression:

    sway&gt; 8 * 7;
    INTEGER: 56

As before, the semicolon signals the end of the expression. The
multiplication sign * is known as an ''operator'', as it ''operates'' on the 8
and the 7, producing an equivalent primitive value. The 8 and the 7 are
known as ''operands''. It seems that the actual names of various operands are
not being taught anymore, so for nostalgia's sake, here they are. The
operand to the left of the multiplication sign (in this case the 8) is
known as the ''multiplicand''. The operand to the right (in this case the 7)
is known as the ''multiplier''. The result is known as the ''product''.

The operands of the other basic operators
have special names too. For addition, the left operand is known as the
''augend'' and the right operand is known as the ''addend''.
The result is known as the ''sum''.
For subtraction,
the left operand is the ''minuend'', the right the ''subtrahend'', and
the result as the ''difference''.
Finally
for division (and I think this is still taught), the left operand is
the ''dividend'', the right operand is the ''divisor'', and the 
result is the ''quotient''.

In general, operators are separated from their operands by spaces, tabs,
or newlines, collectively known as ''whitespace''&lt;ref&gt;
Computer Scientists, when they have to write their annual reports,
often refer to the things they have done and are reporting on as
''darkspace''. It's always good to have a lot of darkspace!
&lt;/ref&gt;.

It would be an error
to enter the expression 8*7; as the times operator does not have the
requisite whitespace.

In fact, Sway always takes in an expression and displays an equivalent
primitive expression (''e.g.'', integer or real). All Sway operators are
binary, meaning they operate on exactly two operands. We first look at
the numeric operators.

==Numeric operators==

If it makes sense to add two things together, you can probably do it in
Sway using the + operator. For example:

    sway&gt; 2 + 3;
    INTEGER: 5
    
    sway&gt; 1.9 + 3.1; 
    REAL: 5.00000000000
    
    sway&gt; &quot;hello&quot; + &quot;world&quot;
    STRING: helloworld
    
One can see that if one adds two integers, the result is an integer. If
one does the same with two reals, the result is a real. The same is
true for adding strings to strings. Things get more interesting when
you add things having different types. Adding an integer and a real (in
any order) always yields a real.

    sway&gt; 2 + 3.3;
    REAL: 5.30000000000
    
    sway&gt; 3.3 + 2;
    REAL: 5.30000000000
    
Adding an integer and a string
(with an augend integer) yields an integer. The addend string is
interpreted as an integer, if possible:

    sway&gt; 2 + &quot;3&quot;;
    INTEGER: 5
    
    sway&gt; 2 + &quot;3.3&quot;;
    INTEGER: 5
    
    sway&gt; 2 + &quot;hello&quot;;
    INTEGER: 2

Adding an integer and a string
(with an augend string) yields an integer. The addend integer is
interpreted as string:

    sway&gt; &quot;hello&quot; + 2;
    INTEGER: &quot;hello2&quot;
    
    sway&gt; &quot;3&quot; + 2;
    STRING: &quot;32&quot;
    
Subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers follow the
same rules as addition. However, these operators, as defined,
do not work for strings&lt;ref&gt;
This does not mean you can never subtract strings. Later you will learn how to override Sway's minus operator so that you can subtract strange things to your heart's content.
&lt;/ref&gt;.

Of special note is the division operator with respect to integer
operands. Consider evaluating the following expression:

    14 / 2

If one asked the Sway interpreter to perform this task, the result
would be 7, as expected. However, if asked the interpreter to evaluate
the expression...

    14 / 5

the result would be 2, not 2.8. Consistent with the rule above, integer
division always returns an integer and if there is a fractional part,
it is discarded. Note that all six of the following expressions evaluate
to 2.8:

    14 / 5.0
    14.0 / 5
    14.0 / 5.0
    14 / real(5)
    real(14) / 5
    real(14) / real(5)

The last three illustrate the use of a conversion function. In the above
cases, the integers are converted to reals before the division occurs.

The complement to integer division is the modulus operator %. While the
result of integer division is the quotient, the result of the modulus
operator is the remainder. Thus

    14 % 5

evaluates to 4 since 4 is left over when 5 is divided into 14. To check
if this is true, one can ask the interpreter to evaluate:

    14 / 5 * 5 + (14 % 5) == 14

This complicated expression asks the question 'is it true that the
quotient times the divisor plus the remainder is equal to the original
dividend?'. The Sway interpreter will respond that, indeed, it is
true. The reason for the parentheses is due to a lack of precedence among
the Sway arithmetic operators and is explained in more detail in the
next chapter.

==About whitespace==

Whitespace (tab, newline, and space) in a computer program has two
purposes. The first is to make expressions in the language pleasing to the
eye. The second is whitespace often signals the end of a primitive. Unlike
many programming languages, Sway uses whitespace to signal the end of
operators. Thus, 8 * 7 is interpreted as two numbers separated by the *
operator while 8*7 (no spaces) will be considered a 'bad number'.
We will learn
about variables in a bit.

==Comparing things==

Remember the Boolean primitives, :true and :false? We can use the boolean
comparison operators to generate such values. For example, we can ask
if 3 is less than 4:

    sway&gt; 3 &lt; 4;
    SYMBOL: :true

The interpreters response says that, indeed, 3 is less than 4. If it were
not, the interpreter would respond with :false.
Besides &lt; (less than),
there are other Boolean comparison operators: &lt;= (less than or equal to),
&gt; (greater than), &gt;= (greater than or equal to), == (equal to), and !=
(not equal to).

Besides integers, we can compare reals with reals and strings with strings
using the less-than-or-greater-than-like operators. In general, it is illegal
to compare integers or reals with strings.

Any Sway type can be compared with any other type with the == and !=
comparison operators.
If an integer is compared with a real with these
operators, the integer is converted into a real before the comparison
is made. In other cases, comparing different types with == will yield
a value of :false. Conversely, comparing different types with != will
yield :true
(the exception, as above, being integers compared with reals).
If the types match, == will yield true only if the values
match as well. The operator != behaves accordingly.

==Combining comparisons==

We can combine comparisons with the Boolean logical connectives &amp;&amp; (and) and || (or).

    sway&gt; 3 &lt; 4 &amp;&amp; 4 &lt; 5;
    SYMBOL: :true
    
    sway&gt; 3 &lt; 4 || 4 &lt; 5;
    SYMBOL: :true
    
    sway&gt; 3 &lt; 4 &amp;&amp; 5 &lt; 4;
    SYMBOL: :false
    
    sway&gt; 3 &lt; 4 || 5 &lt; 4;
    SYMBOL: :true

The first interaction asks if both the expression
&lt;tt&gt;3 &lt; 4&lt;/tt&gt; and the expression
&lt;tt&gt;4 &lt; 5&lt;/tt&gt; are true. Since both are, the
interpreter responds with :true. The second interaction
asks if at least one of the expressions is true. Again, the
interpreter responds with :true. The difference between &amp;&amp;
and || is illustrated in the last two interactions. Since
only one expression is true (the latter expression being
false) only the || operator yields a true value.

There is one more Boolean logic operation, called
''not''. It simply reverses the value of the expression
to which it is attached. The not operator can only be called
as a function (since it is not a binary operator). Since
you do not yet know about functions, I'll show you what
it looks like but won't yet explain its actions.

    sway&gt; not(3 &lt; 4 &amp;&amp; 4 &lt; 5);
    SYMBOL: :false
    
    sway&gt; not(3 &lt; 4 || 4 &lt; 5);
    SYMBOL: :false
    
    sway&gt; not(3 &lt; 4 &amp;&amp; 5 &lt; 4);
    SYMBOL: :true
    
    sway&gt; not(3 &lt; 4 || 5 &lt; 4);
    SYMBOL: :false

Note that we attached ''not'' to each of the previous expressions involving
the logical connectives. Note also that the response of the interpreter
reversed from before in each case.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want to insert new values into an instance of the model and specify where to find the initial values of the insert.

== Method ==
You can add an origin attribute to the insert statement to tell XForms where to get the initial data for the insert. This is the preferred method over doing many setvalues. The syntax of the insert is the following:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;xf:insert ev:event=&quot;DOMActivate&quot; 
   nodeset=&quot;instance('persons')/Person&quot;
   at=&quot;last()&quot; position=&quot;after&quot;
   origin=&quot;instance('init')/Person&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Screen Image ==
A sample screen image. Many people do not have the ability to run the examples so this is critical.

Use this format:

[[File:my-screen-image.jpg|center|frame|This is my caption]]

Make SURE you label all images with a license. 
Please use creative commons &quot;share alike 3.0 with attribution&quot; if you can.

== XForms Application ==

[http://xforms-examples.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/04-repeating-data/036b-insert-origin/insert-origin.xhtml Load XForms Application]

Make sure that the mime-type is set in the svn system to be text/xml.

== Sample XForms Template ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Toppy does not seem to cope very well with playing audio if the TV type is set different to the video being played.  In the UK, all broadcasts are PAL so the TV Type should be set to PAL, and this can be changed using the [http://www.toppy.org.uk/newusers/menuref.php System Setting] menu, A/V Output Setting item.

There is also a known issue with (specifically) Film4 recordings being played back when tuned to Sky3 (or any channel on [http://www.unsatisfactorysoftware.co.uk/dtt/dtt.cgi?reg=UK&amp;by=lcn&amp;mux=C MuxC]).  The solution is to tune to a different channel (e.g. BBC1) before starting playback.

Other causes are the obvious signal problems: weak signal and poor quality signal (check the aerial type, alignment and cabling, water ingress in connections, and consider a booster), atmospherics, and interference from other electrical activity, such as lawnmowers, car electrics and dodgy domestic appliances (better [CT100] cabling may help).

Experience has shown that audio dropouts can occur when the machine has got hot, often after a few hours playback. This gets progressively worse. The solution is either switch off and allow it to cool down, or direct a cool air fan at the machine. The fan noise can be ignored by the satisfaction of completing a watched programme.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This example shows how to experimentally measure the real speed of the robot using the floor sensors. A sheet of paper is put on the floor, which the robot traverses at the speed to be measured. Using the floor sensors, the robot detect when it enters and leaves the sheet, and records both times. Since the length of the sheet is known, the real speed can be calculated.

== Setup ==

Boot a Khepera III robot and make sure it is [[Khepera III Toolbox/Network Setup|connected]] to your computer via WLAN. In the following explanation, we assume that you are working with robot 203. Stick a white sheet of paper on a dark floor, and place the robot in front of the paper.

Copy the ''motor_initialize'', ''motor_stop'' and ''infrared_proximity'' programs onto the robot
 cd Programs
 k3put +203 motor_initialize motor_stop infrared_proximity
Then, copy the ''measure_real_speed'' program from the examples folder onto the robot
 cd ../Examples/measure_real_speed
 k3put +203 measure_real_speed
Log on to the robot
 k3go +203
and type
 cd your_username
 ./motor_initialize
to initialize the motors.

Before taking speed measurements, we need to configure the floor thresholds when entering and leaving the sheet of paper, as well as the size of the paper.

To find out the floor thresholds, type
 ./infrared_proximity
once with the robot on the white sheet of paper and once with the robot on the dark floor. You will get results like this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
# On the dark floor
$IRPROXIMITY,0,12496,44,9,8,15,6,43,3,69,48,3195,3021

# On the white sheet of paper
$IRPROXIMITY,0,21438,97,29,28,52,56,127,20,120,99,3977,3973
&lt;/source&gt;
where the ''two last numbers'' in each measurement belong to the floor sensors. The threshold used when entering the paper (--floor-threshold-on) should be just slightly below the value measured on the white sheet of paper, i.e. 3900 in our case. The threshold used when leaving the paper (--floor-threshold-off) should be a bit higher than the measurement on the dark floor, i.e. 3200 here.

To test if the thresholds work, place the robot about 5 cm in front of the sheet and launch
 ./measure_real_speed --speed 10000 --floor-threshold-on 3900 --floor-threshold-off 3200
The robot should report when it enters and leaves the paper, and stop about 5 cm after the sheet. If the result is not satisfying, adjust the thresholds and test again. The ''motor_stop'' program may be helpful to stop the robot in case the ''measure_real_speed'' program does not detect the edges of the paper.

== Running the Experiment ==

Open ''run.pl'' with a text editor and adjust the floor thresholds. Also adjust the paper size in case you are not using an A4 sheet (long-wise).

Position the robot in front of your sheet of paper, and launch
 ./run.pl
The robot will now cross the sheet of paper in forward and backward direction many times with different speeds, and the results are stored in a file called ''run_results'' in the same folder.

== Parsing the Result File ==

Type the following line to process the result file
 ./parse_results.pl &lt; run_results &gt; matlab_run_results

== Plotting the Result in Matlab ==

Launch Matlab and type
 plot_results
In addition to plotting the real speed for various speed setpoints, this will also calculate and plot a speed factor, i.e. the ratio between real speed and speed setpoint.

The resulting speed factor will be about 7.1e-6 m/(s * unit), which means that a speed setpoint of 10000 corresponds to 7.1 cm/s.

==Bongcloud Attack==
===2. Ke2===
Ke2 is a dubious move. An early 'joke' idea of this move is to prepare for an early endgame by developing the king. However, the problems with 2. Ke2?! are that the King move prevents castling to protect the King, endangers the King, ignores development and the center, and blocks the Queen and Bishop, which are the two pieces that are free after 1. e4. All that being said, it can be used as a surprise to unseat Black, as many novices may be unable to cope with the unfamiliar board positions of the Bongcloud Attack. However, if it has been encountered before, it usually results in a defeat for White.&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.chess.com/Graw81/my-boungcloud-attack-games&lt;/ref&gt;
Due to the dubiousness of the move, it can be used as a form of a handicap system.

Sometimes, games are played that begin with the Bongcloud Attack in which the players try to move the king to the opposite side of the board rather than achieve a checkmate.

===Nomenclature===

Note that the term &quot;Bongcloud Attack&quot; is not widely accepted in formal chess theory, though other dubious openings such as the Creepy Crawly Attack are. The opening was created by a chess.com user.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This chapter should cover the basics of ECG systems from a ''design'' point of view; '''not''' from a ''diagnosis'' point of view.

== Physiological Background ==
[[Image:SinusRhythmLabels.svg|thumb|325px|Typical ECG signal]]
[[Image:ECG principle slow.gif|thumb|325px|An animation showing how the electrical activity of the heart is reflected on the ECG signal]]
The function of the heart is to contract rhythmically and pump blood to the lungs for oxygenation and then pump this oxygenated blood into the general circulation. This perfect rhythm is continuously maintained and signaled by the spread of electrical signals generated by the heart pacemaker, the sinoatrial (SA) node. &lt;ref&gt;Clinical Electrocardiography, a Simplified Approach. Seventh Edition; Ary L. Goldberger, Mosby-Elsevier, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Detecting such electrical activity of the heart can help identify many heart disorders. This is the main concept behind using an ECG (Electrocardiogram), tracing the electrical activity of the heart.

By measuring and tracing the potential difference between two points on the outer surface of the body we obtain the simplest ECG chart. Two typical measuring points between the left arm and the right arm. By defining the two points and setting up the conventional positive direction for measuring the voltage, we create what is called a &quot;Lead&quot;.

The first phase of the cardiac muscle activation is the stimulation of the right and left atria by an electrical signal generated from the SA node. This phase appears as the P-wave on the ECG chart. The electrical signal, originally generated by the SA node, then spreads through the Atrioventricual (AV) Junction, the bundle of His, and the Purkinje fibers to finally reach and stimulate the ventricles. The spread of the electrical signal through the ventricles causes ventricular contraction. The phase of ventricular contraction appears as the characteristic QRS complex on the ECG chart. Finally, with the relaxation of the two ventricles, a depolarization signal is generated and appears as the T-wave on the ECG chart.

== Design of a Basic ECG Signal Acquisition Module ==
The acquisition of the ECG signal is a rather challenging task, as the case with many biological signals. ECG voltage signal is very low in magnitude (few millivolts) and has relatively low frequency content. The expected bandwidth of the signal typically begins from 0.01 Hz and extends to no more than 150 Hz.

Another challenge in acquiring the ECG signal is the power-line interference that is often order of magnitudes greater than the original ECG signal. All this suggests challenging requirements for the design of the signal acquisition module: It should have minimum loading effect, it should contain an amplification stage to make the signal level appropriate for further use, and it should contain a filtration stage customized to remove the expected noise and power-line interference that often corrupts the ECG.

In this section, we are ''NOT'' going to consider the full design of the ECG signal; rather, we shall focus on a ''minimal'' ECG acquisition module design that would ''just work''.

[[Image:Ecg.svg|thumb|352px|A VERY simplified block diagram of an ECG amplifier. The voltage of the right arm (w.r.t right leg) is subtracted from the voltage of the left arm (w.r.t right leg) to get the ECG Lead I signal).]]
As discussed in the physiological background section, an ECG signal is obtained as the voltage difference between two points on the skin. This suggests the need for some ''subtraction'' mechanism. The subtraction could be done using an electronic ''Difference Amplifier''. This amplifier basically subtracts and amplifies the difference between two electrical points. For the subtraction to work correctly, the voltage of both electrical points should be measured with respect to a common electrical reference. This common reference is typically chosen to be the right leg of the patient.

So, a simplified diagram of a simple ECG acquisition module would be as shown in the figure.

== Signal Artifacts ==
Artifacts that corrupt the raw ECG signal have either physiological or non-physiological origin. The most dominant artifact is the '''power-line interference''' which appears as an sinusoidal wave of frequency 50 Hz (or 60 Hz in USA). Other artifacts include:&lt;ref&gt;Takla G, Petre JH, Doyle DJ, Horibe M, Gopakumaran B. ''The problem of artifacts in patient monitor data during surgery: a clinical and methodological review''. Anesth Analg. 2006;103(5):1196-204&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Movement Artifacts''' due to patient movement, etc...
* '''Baseline Wander''' where the ECG waveform baseline starts to drift up and down in a sinusoidal pattern following the patient breathing
* '''EMG Interference''' where muscle contraction signals interfere with the ECG.
* '''Electrode Contact Noise''' where the electrodes are not tightly coupled to the patient causing some distortion
* '''Electrosurgical Unit (ESU) interference''' where high-frequency signals from the ESU used by surgeons during operation interfere with the ECG

== Basic Signal Conditioning for the ECG ==
This section should discuss theoretical signal processing solutions to the above artifacts

      <text xml:space="preserve">The sound of the word GMAX often strikes terror into the hearts of those who have struggled through tutorials then given up.  This tutorial takes you through the necessary steps and only the necessary steps to do modify the position of the numbers on the reskin of the basic plank wagon.


If you have any intention of doing serious work in GMAX please set up GMAX as per Paul Hobbs first GMAX tutorial.

To work in GMAX we need three files.  These are the GMAX source file and two texture files, one for the wagon and one for the numbers.  GMAX will want to know where they are so normally I keep all the files for a project together in one folder under the GMAX\mesh folder.  This part will use a Highland Railway loco coal wagon to demonstrate how to move the numbers.



The first step is to create a folder with the correct name under the GMAX\mesh folder.

[[Image:v create folder.jpg]]





Now we need the GMAX source file so we need to extract it from cmp, note it is unusual to find the GMAX source files supplied in the model files on the DLS.  First we edit in explorer.

[[Image:v edit in explorer.jpg]]




This gives us access to the files.

[[Image:v basic wagon folder.jpg]]





The first file we want is the zip file containing the source.  Note Auran does not permit files of type .zip to be stored so it has been renamed to .txt file extension.  First we copy the file.

[[Image:v copy.jpg]]




Then paste it into the new folder.

[[Image:v paste.jpg]]




Repeat to get the texture.tga files form the body folder.

[[Image:v body folder.jpg]]




Note we can collect two files at once by highlighting them both.

[[Image:v textures.jpg]]




Then paste them into the new folder.

[[Image:v paste.jpg]]




At this point you may wish to copy in your new cs_skin.tga file. 

[[Image:v hr coal folder.jpg]]




To unzip the GMAX source first rename the file to a .zip extension.

[[Image:v coal rename.jpg]]



Then unzip the file.

[[Image:v unzipped.jpg]]




Now we open the GMAX source file in GMAX.  GMAX has two ways to show an object, one is wire mode, the other is Smooth Plus Highlights.  We need the Smooth Plus Highlights.  To change from one to the other right click the word in the top left hand corner then select the appropriate one.

[[Image:gmax1a.jpg]]






It is probable that the texture file has not been found.

[[Image:gmax1.jpg]]




So we tell GMAX where the file is with the GMAX Material Navigator.  1 Click on the GMAX Material Navigator button, 2 then check the applied button, 3 finally click on the file we want to change. 

[[Image:gmax2.jpg]]



Use the &quot;select bitmap image file&quot; window to select the image file we wish to use.

[[Image:gmax3.jpg]]





Repeat for the other instances of the file name.

[[Image:GMAX4.jpg]]




Now we have our correctly textured wagon showing in GMAX.

[[Image:gmax5.jpg]]





To show more detail select the quadrant we are interested in then press the &quot;W&quot; key.

[[Image:gmax6.jpg]]




For clarity a brown ssa.tga has been used.  We'll change it to the proper ssa.tga texture later on.  Now we want to select the number panel before moving it.  To do this press &quot;H&quot; then highlight the item (1) in this case number1 and press the select button (2).  You can click on the item directly but GMAX can interpret a mouse click as a command to both select and to move the object with unwanted results so use the H selection method to avoid this.

[[Image:gmax7.jpg]]




Click on the blue arc tab to show which item we have selected.  This will also allow us to resize the panel with the wagon number on if required.

[[Image:gmax8.jpg]]



The next step after selecting the panel is to move it.  We click on the move icon with four arrows on it.  If you look carefully to the right of the icon you can see the letters X Y Z and xy these constrain movement in the those planes.  Z is up and down, Y is side to side, X is in and out.  With the xy constraint set as it is here we can move the panel about without fear that it will move further into or away from the wagon.  The panel can be moved either with the mouse or by changing the values in the Y and Y boxes at the bottom of the screen.  Do not touch the value in the X box, a value of 0 in the Y box means the number will be centred on the Y axis.

[[Image:gmax9.jpg]]



Here we can see the panel has been moved into position note the value of Y.

[[Image:gmax10.jpg]]




In this case the wagon number panel wants to be slightly longer so we click on Plane, then adjust the value in width to 18&quot;.  This is often easier to see with the correct texture file.

[[Image:gmax10a.jpg]]




The wagon with the correct texture file copied in place.

[[Image:gmax11.jpg]]




Repeat using the Left view to adjust number2.

Finally we come to the export.  Trainz has it's own preferred file format so to get Trainz to recognise our wagon we need to export it.  '''Make sure nothing is selected''' Then locate the export entry on the file menu.

[[Image:gmax12.jpg]]




We need to tell GMAX to create a file called body.im, one way is to simply type &quot;body.im&quot; in the save box.  This file is the close up or high detailed one for the lod.

[[Image:gmax13.jpg]]





After that we copy the .im files and tetxure.txt files into the appropriate folder in CMP.  Normally if you sort the folder by time you will want to copy the most recent files but not the .GMAX source.

[[Image:w importing files into Trainz.jpg]]





[[Image:w importing files into Trainz 2.jpg]]






We need to double check that the wagon points to our new texture group by editing the config.txt file if you haven't already done so.


[[Image:bodytextures.jpg]]









Commit the changes and open up Trainz and we should find our new model.  View it from close up to view the detailed mesh and texture file.  Note the three different wagon numbers on display.

[[Image:HR loco coal.jpg]]





This model uses lod or level of detail to assist performance.  Trainz selects the appropriate version depending how far away you are form the model.  You can control this but for the moment we'll simply create the lower detailed meshes and point them at smaller versions of the texture files.  So first double check we have the smaller versions of the texture file available.  

[[Image:resize1a.jpg]]





[[Image:resize2.jpg]]





[[Image:resize3.jpg]]





And save as cs_skin_med.tga.

[[Image:resize4.jpg]]





== Level of Detail steps ==


Then back into GMAX and open up our wagon.  The first step is to save the source under a different name.


[[Image:lod 1.jpg]]





We add the letters &quot;med&quot; onto the end of the name.

[[Image:lod 2.jpg]]




We are going to both reduce the polys and point to a smaller texture file but the first step is to ungroup group B which contains one of the details that we are going to detail. So use H to bring up the Select Objects and highlight B.

[[Image:lod 3.jpg]]




Here we can see that there is buffer detail that can be seen close up but not from further away.  Note the vertical and horizontal arrows that show the centre of the object and the white lines around the object.

[[Image:lod 4.jpg]]




After the ungrouping we can see the buffer collar and buffer collar01 in the Select Objects which we will delete for the medium level of detail.  For the low level of  detail we will also delete the carriage bit and carriage bit 01.

[[Image:lod 5.jpg]]




Select and press the delete key.

[[Image:lod 6.jpg]]




Here you can see a minor detail has been deleted which won't be noticeable in the med lod.

[[Image:lod 7.jpg]]




Now we need to point the mesh to the smaller texture file.  Click on the three balls for the GMAX Material Navigator.  reduce the selection by clicking Applied in browse form scene, (on the left), click on the first cs_skin to bring up the Material Editor and finally click on the bitmap to change the name of the file.  The same steps as we used when opening up GMAX for the first time to get the texture.

[[Image:lod 8.jpg]]





Open the cs_skin_med.tga.  Repeat this step for the other two references to the CS_Skin.tga file file in the GMAX material editor.

[[Image:lod 10.jpg]]



Finally we export the body_med.im file.

[[Image:lod 11.jpg]]




Repeat these steps for the low version of the lod.


Copy the 
body_med.im
cs_skin_med.texture.txt
body_low.im
cs_skin_low.texture.txt
ssa.texture.txt
files from the mesh folder into the zrb_body folder as you did for the body.im file earlier.

Commit and your reskin is now complete.

== Goal ==

In this lesson, you will learn to introduce yourself, tell people your profession, name and nationality.  The definite article is introduced as well. You need to have a basic knowledge of greetings in Greek and know είμαι, είσαι and είστε forms of the verb 'to be'.

== Dialog ==
: '''''Αντώνης''': Γεια σου!
: '''''Ανθή''': Γεια σου!
: '''''Αντώνης''': Πώς είσαι;
: '''''Ανθή''': Είμαι καλά, εσύ πώς είσαι;
: '''''Αντώνης''': Είμαι καλά.
: '''''Ανθή''': Πώς σε λένε (or &quot;Ποιο είναι το όνομά σου&quot; (not used));
: '''''Αντώνης''': Με λένε Αντώνη (answers the first question) (or &quot;Το όνομα μου είναι Αντώνης&quot; (answers the second question)).
: '''''Ανθή''': (Εμένα) με λένε Ανθή (or &quot;Το όνομα μου είναι Ανθή&quot;). Χαίρω πολύ!
: '''''Αντώνης''': Χαίρω πολύ επίσης.
: '''''Ανθή''': Γεια σου!
: '''''Αντώνης''': Γεια σου!

'''Notes'''

* Note that every one of these words has ο or η in front of it this tells us that these are nouns. The ο or η also tells us the gender, ο is for masculine and η is for feminine.
* Some of the words introduced in the above table have two forms, one for males and another for females. This roughly corresponds to the actor and actress that is present in English. If the masculine ends in ος the feminine is often formed by adding ίδα after dropping the ος. But this is not always the case if we look at the words for Chinese.  It is wrong to use the masculine form to describe yourself if you are female.

'''Examples'''
* Είμαι Άγγλος.
* Είσαι Ελληνίδα;
* Είμαι Γερμανίδα.

'''Examples'''

* Η Μάρια είναι όμορφη.
* Ο Στέλιος είναι μεγάλος.
* Το όνομα σου είναι όμορφο.
* O γιατρός είναι καλός.
* O Αντώνης είναι έξυπνος.

==Explanations==

* Notice how there is agreement with the definite articles and the noun that is present before.  In summary, 'Η', 'Ο' and 'Το' are the definite articles for feminine, masculine and neuter nouns. They all correspond to 'the' in English.  In Greek, definite articles are always placed before Peoples names.  This means that Η Μάρια means Maria in English.  You'll find definite articles listed after nouns in Dictionaries.  This tells us the gender of the word.
* You have probably noticed that there are three forms of each of the adjectives listed in the table above. If the adjective ends with ος it is masculine. Feminine if it ends with η. Finally if it ends with ο it is neuter. This is important because adjectives have to agree with the nouns that they describe.  So if the noun is masculine then the adjective must also be masculine. This is called agreement. We can see this illustrated in the examples above, numbers 2, 4 and 5.  'O γιατρός' is masculine so 'καλός' must also be masculine.  The same applies for feminine nouns look at the first example. Η Μάρια is feminine so the form must be όμορφη to agree with it.  The same is true of neuter nouns look at the third example.
* If we look at the I'm Greek section, the second example is a question simply because of its semicolon. Recall that in speech what makes it a question is the rising intonation towards the end of the sentence. In the same way, we can form questions asking whether someone is a doctor (Είσαι γιατρός;)

== Summary ==

* We are able to ask someone's name and give our own name. (Τι είναι το όνομα σου? Με λένε Μάριο.)
* We have learnt the ways to what nationality you are. (Είμαι Άγγλος.)
* We can inquire if someone is a certain nationality. (Είσαι Ελληνίδα;)
* We now know how to ask what profession someone has. (Ποιο είναι το επάγγελμα σου;)
* We can tell people what we do. (Είμαι δάσκαλος)

== The next step ==

You should now do the exercise related to each section ([[Modern_Greek/A1/Exercises/Lesson 2|found here]]),  or if you're feeling very confident go to the next lesson, [[Modern_Greek/A1/Lesson 3|lesson 3]]. Alternatively, return to the [[Greek_language|contents]].

==Extension==

If you'd like to learn more words that you can use without having to study another lesson, use this section in order to find them. Feel free to learn selectively, picking out words you consider useful for your situation or interesting. If you don't have the time, you can just skip this section. You will not be required to know any of these words in the next lessons. There words in below section have a variety of different endings. We don't have to worry about this yet, to form similar sentences to above just take the appropriate word from the table use είμαι, είσαι και είναι.

This section contains additional professions and nationalities.

Welcome to Wikibooks.  Thanks for your contributions to the [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Vocational/House Painting, Interior]] honor.  However, we have to be very careful about where our content comes from.  Did you copy the text from Behr verbatim, or did you rephrase the information in your own words?  If it was a simple copy, we'll have to replace it with some original text unless you can get Behr to agree to license their content under the GFDL.

Again, thanks for your work.  --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 23:23, 28 February 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{lowercase|title=mIRC Scripting}}
'''mIRC Scripting''' is a built-in, [[w:Interpreter_%28computing%29|interpreted]] scripting language for the [[w:mIRC|mIRC]] IRC client for Windows. It is an easy-to-use and flexible script for uses ranging from automating and simplifying IRC tasks to making mini-programs such as file servers and away systems. Some people even utilize scripts to completely skin and program the IRC interface. These are usually called &quot;full scripts,&quot; while individual, smaller scripting projects are known as &quot;remotes&quot; or &quot;addons,&quot; or &quot;snippets&quot; for really small scripts. This wikibook will attempt to explain all the aspects of mIRC Scripting, starting from the very basic parts of the language for beginners, and delving into the more advanced topic for experts.

Come introduce yourself at the [[WB:SLN|new users]] page.  If you have any questions, you can ask there or contact me personally.

I saw your [[MIRC Scripting]] book, and I'm thrilled about it. I've been an mIRC user for a long time now, and I'm terrible at scripting. I would love to learn more, and look forward to reading your book. 

By the way, since you're an IRC user, if you're ever on Freenode stop in at #wikibooks to chat with me and some other volunteers here. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 01:38, 29 February 2008 (UTC)

Looks good to me now. As for being decorative vs illustrative, I'm fine with it. [[WB:MEDIA]] isn't actually policy, so there's leeway. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:08, 4 March 2008 (UTC)

Looking much better, but remember that {{tlx|fair use}}, {{tlx|screenshot}} etc ''are'' the license; please don't have {{tlx|PD-self}} etc. on there as well, as that's nonsensical. You can choose the fair use templates in the dropdown box on [[Special:Upload]] (they're way at the bottom). Thanks for your efforts here, it makes things a lot smoother when people take care when uploading files. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:47, 6 March 2008 (UTC)

:Sorry, I was wrong:
:#[[:Image:Gmax13.jpg]] isn't used, so the fair use claim is invalid. If you're going to use it that's fine, but otherwise, we shouldn't have it hanging around. Same for [[:Image:Lod 9.jpg]] and [[:Image:Box textures.jpg]] and [[:Image:Folder image.jpg]]
:#[[:Image:Lod 9.jpg]] is still incorrectly marked as {{tlx|PD-self}}
:#[[:Image:Thumb.jpg]] needs a description
:I also changed a ton of the {{tlx|fairuse rationale}} templates to say accurately where they're used.

== February 2008 screenshots ==

Similarly to Mike's comments above, please use correct templates for screenshots. See an overview of these at [[Wikibooks:Templates/Files]]. These will need to be cleared up if the images are to stay.

You can find a full list of your uploads on your [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=upload&amp;user=Johnwhelan&amp;page=&amp;year=&amp;month=-1 upload log]. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 08:22, 28 February 2009 (UTC)

: Can you be more precise about what exactly is missing then I can correct the uploaded images, I copied the previous screen shot details thinking these would be acceptable as to be honest I find it quite difficult and time consuming to follow your complicated exacting requirements.

: Thanks John&lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:72.138.27.147|72.138.27.147]] ([[User talk:72.138.27.147|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/72.138.27.147|contribs]]) 21:30, 28 February 2009&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

:: These images are screen-shots of software that has a particular license. You need to upload the images under a license that is compatible with the software license. If the software license is non-free, you can upload under a fair-use license. If it is free, you need to comply with the requirements placed on derivative works.
:: Make a list of your images, note which software each screen-shot is of, and look up and add to the list which license each of these uses. Then check the [[Wikibooks:Templates/Files]] (there is a section on screenshots). Find the most fitting one for each, and add it to that list. Then report back to me and I'll see where we'll go from there.
:: I'm not sure if this is clear enough for you. Please keep in mind that those of us who do the bulk of the maintenance work here on Wikibooks have limited time to donate to the project and dealing with copyrights issues is not always easy but certainly time consuming as well. We're happy to help you along, but I'm afraid we're not able to do your work for you. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 17:00, 28 February 2009 (UTC)

I'll take a look.  Thanks for the explanation.  Cheerio John

Try it all the images except one are from GIMP which is Open source, the other is a screenshot of propitiatory software, hopefully I have the correct licences now.  Thanks John

I've no idea what I'm supposed to do about this.  I have added extra descriptive text to the page.  We wished to document that it could be done and a starting point on how to do it.  We are currently doing research and conformation tests to determine exactly what to do.

: Thanks for responding. The best place to respond would be on the module talk page. You could perhaps move the bits you added to the module page over to the talk page and explain what's going to end up there. It's just that placeholder pages are often added with the best of intention but end up never attracting any content. This means that a reader may find himself browsing around a bunch of placeholders where he at first glance saw a fairly complete book. In that case the red-links are better.
: Furthermore, discussing this off-wiki gives others the impression of inactivity. Thanks for explaining this. I'll remove the tag, but it would be helpful if in the future you would leave slightly more information about your plans for the page, or hold off creating it before the content is decided. No big deal, though, and thanks again for your response.
: One last note: You can sign comments by adding four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;) to it. This will expand to your user-name and a time-stamp. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 13:40, 18 January 2010 (UTC)

Just trying to figure out how to paginate this beast and stumbled onto [https://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Trainz%2FDownloading_From_Third_Party_Trainz_Fansites&amp;diff=1332589&amp;oldid=1332587 this edit] by you. Can you flesh that out a bit and update the precautions you clearly mean to convey? A little step by step would be good. 

* Are there any others you've notice editing this wikibook lately? Recently been skype-co-ordinating in Yesrerdayz-Trainz and would be nice to have a brainstorming session of how to fix this thing up!

__TOC__

Before beginning mIRC scripting, you should get to know mIRC a bit better and make sure you have some basic knowledge under your belt.

* Do you know how to use basic commands, join [[w:IRC Server|servers]], and chat?
* Can you tell what a command is and how to identify one?
* Do you know what most of the options in the options dialog are for?
* Do you know what the command line is?
* Have you ever used the script editor before? Can you find it on the toolbar?

If you can't do any of those first four, then you should do so now. If you aren't doing step one, well...you should not be here. You should be learning how to chat, first. If you need help with the last item, read the section below.

== Getting to Know Your Script Editor ==
First things first: locate the button on your toolbar that looks like a paper scroll with a green dot on it. This is the script editor toolbar button. If you can not find the button or don't have the toolbar open, push Alt+R on your keyboard. Look at the window that opens. It is a fairly simple window. You should see a menu bar, a tab bar, a lone button with a checkmark, the OK/Cancel/Apply buttons, and some information about the script. Let's digest this step by step.

[[Image:Msedit2.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Your script editor, with no script loaded.]]

=== The Main Body of the dialog ===
Every tab on the tab bar has the same three items, no matter what. A menu bar, a text area, and three buttons. The OK button saves changes you've made and closes the editor. The Cancel button saves nothing and exits. If you have made changes, it will ask you to save them. Apply saves changes but doesn't close the editor.

=== The Tabs ===
Each tab has three things. A large text field where you enter your scripts, tab specific menu commands (if any; see section [[MIRC_Scriping/Basics/Become_Familiar_with_mIRC#The_Menu_Bar|The Menu Bar]]), and text containing file information. The text on the left tells you which file you are viewing. The other side shows your text position and the file size. The text position is in the format character:line/total lines. So if it reads &lt;tt&gt;12:15/40&lt;/tt&gt;, you are 12 characters into the 15th line out of 40 lines in the entire script. This is really helpful only in very large scripts several hundred lines long when trying to find errors on a certain line. Nonetheless, it is always there to look at.

* '''Aliases''' - This tab is for aliases, commands that stand for one or more other commands. An example of an alias would be: &lt;tt&gt;hello msg $active Hello, I'm $me $+ .&lt;/tt&gt;
* '''Popups''' - The popups section contains custom popup menus.
* '''Remotes''' - The bulk of the time you spend in the script editor will be here, in the remote section, where remote events are placed.
* '''Users''' - The users tab contains user levels for restricting remote event access.
* '''Variables''' - The variables tab stores the values of global variables made using the /set command.

=== The &quot;Bracket Check&quot; Button ===
One notable mention on the tab bar, besides the tabs, is the lone button with a checkmark on it. This button is incredibly useful. In mIRC scripting, chances are when a script has an error, there is a missing opening or closing brace (the { and } are what we call &quot;braces&quot; or &quot;brackets&quot;). This button will check them and let you know if you have a bracket error.

=== The Menu Bar ===
The menu bar is the bar at the top of the screen just under the title bar. There are six menus: File, Edit, View, Listen, Options, and Help. Most of the important script editor functions can be found here. There should be a lot of commands familiar to computer users, such as Save, Open, Undo, Cut, and Paste, but we'll go over everything anyways. You don't have to memorize these, but it's worth a quick read. You can also come back here any time and reference this if you are unsure what a menu item does.

* '''File'''
:* '''New''' - Creates a new script file. This command is &lt;font color=&quot;gray&quot;&gt;disabled&lt;/font&gt; in the Popups, Users, and Variables tabs.
:* '''Load''' - Load a new script file into the current tab.
:* '''Unload''' - Unload a script file from the current tab. This command is &lt;font color=&quot;gray&quot;&gt;disabled&lt;/font&gt; in the Popups, Users, and Variables tabs.
:* '''Save''' - Save changes to the current script file.
:* '''Save As''' - Save changes to the script as a different file.
:* '''Save All''' - Save changes to all script files under a tab.
:* '''Order''' - Change the processing order of the loaded scripts. This command is &lt;font color=&quot;gray&quot;&gt;disabled&lt;/font&gt; in the Popups, Users, and Variables tabs.
:* '''Font''' - Change the style and the size of the font used in the editor here.
:* '''Save and Exit''' - Save your changes and exit the editor.

* '''Edit'''
:* '''Undo''' - Undo the last changes you made to a script.
:* '''Redo''' - The opposite of undo.
:* '''Cut/Copy/Paste''' - Cut removes selected text in a script, and copy makes a copy of it. Paste puts that text back in the document.
:* '''Delete''' - Deletes selected text, if any.
:* '''Select All''' - Selects all text on the page.
:* '''Check Brackets''' - Serves the same function as the check brackets button. This command is &lt;font color=&quot;gray&quot;&gt;disabled&lt;/font&gt; in the Users tab and &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;'''not available'''&lt;/font&gt; in the Variables tab.
:* '''Sort Variables''' - Alphabetically sorts all your global variables. This command is &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;'''not available'''&lt;/font&gt; in the Aliases, Popups, Remote, and users tabs.
:* '''Goto line''' - Go to any line in the script.
:* '''More Files''' - If you have a lot of script files loaded, this command will show you a whole list of them to view. This command is &lt;font color=&quot;gray&quot;&gt;disabled&lt;/font&gt; in the Popups, Users, and Variables tabs.
:* '''Find''' - Finds whatever text you enter wherever it shows up in the script. It always goes down from where your cursor is, so for best results, move to the top of the script before searching. If nothing is found, you'll hear a ding.
:* '''Find Next''' - Find next is identical to Find, except it finds the next occurrence of text. Again, if nothing is found, it will make a ding.

* '''View'''
: The View menu is a special menu. It doesn't have a set list of commands for every tab, (except for the Popups tab). Four of the tabs simply have a list of script files loaded. The Aliases tab shows a list of alias files, and the Remote, Users, and Variables tabs show a list of remote scripts. However, the Popups tab is a special case. It has five options: Status, Channel, Query, Menu Bar, Nicklist. The Status, Channel, and Query popups all open in their respective windows when you right-click. The Nick List and Menu Bar popups each alter the menus that show up when you right-click on the nicklist or Menu Bar.

* '''Alias''' - Only appears on Aliases tab.
: The Alias menu shows you a list of aliases you have entered alphabetically.

* '''Popup''' - Only appears on Popups tab.
: The Popup menu is loaded with whatever popup you are viewing.

* '''Listen'''
: This menu lets you change the settings for what events to listen for. You can listen for [[w:Client-To-Client_Protocol|CTCPs]], remote events, and raw events.

* '''Options'''
:* '''Initialization Warning''' - A fairly annoying option that pops up a warning box when you load a script that has an On START or an On LOAD event that wants to execute code. As a general rule, you shouldn't be running code you don't understand anyways, so turning this off would be helpful.
:* '''Ask to Save Files''' - If you try to close the script editor after you've changed a script, this will ask you to save if turned on.
:* '''Backup File on Save''' - Quite self-explanatory, this will make a backup file when you save the script.
:* '''Show on Desktop''' - This will make the script editor appear on the taskbar and as its own window, instead of being a child window of mIRC.
:* '''Always on Top''' - Another self-explanatory option, this will keep the mIRC Script Editor on top of all other open windows.
:* '''Default Level:''' ''x'' - The default level to use in an event when * is the event level, such as &lt;tt&gt;On *:Start:&lt;/tt&gt;. You probably should NOT change this, as the default level of 1 works fine and it will most likely screw up a script using a * level.
&lt;!-- I don't know what Monitor File Changes, Find Selection, or Identifier Warning are for as I've never used them. Anyone who edits them in and puts it in the edit summary or tells me the answer gets credit on the authors page. --&gt;

* '''Help'''
:* '''Contents''' - Opens the help file contents page.
:* '''Search''' - Search the help file for certain keywords.
:* '''Topic-specific help''' - Clicking on the items below Search will open the help file to a certain page depending on what you clicked on. Available topics are Aliases, Commands, Identifiers, If-Then-Else, Popups, Remote, and Variables.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Celx Scripting: Vector =

== vector ==

A &quot;vector&quot; object in Celestia is a 3-tuple of double precision floating point values, which represent a geometric object that has both a length and direction [X, Y, Z] in a 3 dimensional coordinate system.

Within a CELX script, the vector methods need to be prefixed with the obtained &quot;vector&quot; object, separated with a semicolon.

The following methods can be used to obtain a &quot;vector&quot; object:
* Using the [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx celestia#newvector|celestia:newvector()]] method.
* Using the [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx position#vectorto|position:vectorto()]] method.
* Using the [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx vector#normalize|vector:normalize()]] method.
* Using the [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx rotation#imag|rotation:imag()]] method.
* Using the [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx rotation#transform|rotation:transform()]] method.
* By subtracting two &quot;position&quot; objects.


'''Notes:'''
# Vector components (X,Y,Z) in Celestia are stored in millionths of a light year. So when you have your own vectors defined in km or miles, you have to convert these vectors. Therefore, you can use a constant, which must be initialized first within your script:
#* From km to millionths of a light year, use a constant uly_to_km = 9460730.4725808.
#* From miles to millionths of a light year, use a constant uly_to_mls = 5912956.5453630.
# Next you can convert km or miles to millionths of a light year as follows: 
#* millionths_of_a_light_year = ''number:km'' / uly_to_km 
#* millionths_of_a_light_year = ''number:miles'' / uly_to_mls

== Operators ==

&quot;Vector&quot; objects can be added and subtracted from each other.&lt;br&gt;It is also possible to add a &quot;postion&quot; object with a &quot;vector&quot; object, or subtract a &quot;vector&quot; object from a &quot;postion&quot; object.

* position + vector → position 
* position - vector → position 
* vector + vector → vector
* vector - vector → vector


Scalar multiplication with &quot;Vector&quot; objects:
* number * vector → vector
* vector * number → vector


The * operator gives the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product dot product] of two vectors v and w:
* v * w = v.x*w.x + v.y*w.y + v.z*w.z → number


The ^ operator gives the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_product cross product] of two vectors v and w:
* v ^ w = [(v.y*w.z - v.z*w.y), (v.z*w.x - v.x*w.z), (v.x*w.y - v.y*w.x)] → vector 
The new vector is perpendicular (according the right-hand rule) to the plane containing the two input vectors
* v ^ w = - w ^ v
Be careful when using this: ^ is normally the exponentiation operator in Lua, and thus has higher precedence than almost any other operator, including unary minus.

== Members ==

You can access and assign the x, y, and z components of a &quot;vector&quot; object directly, e.g.

 vec = celestia:newvector(0, 0, 0)
 vec.x = vec.x + 1

== Methods ==

This chapter contains a list of all available vector methods, which can be used on &quot;vector&quot; objects.

=== getx ===

number {{Celx:func|vector:getx()}}

Return the X coordinate of the vector as a number.

'''Example:'''&lt;br&gt;Get a vector giving the heliocentric position of the Earth and display the X-, Y- and Z-components of that vector in the lower left corner of your screen.

 now = celestia:gettime()
 sunpos = celestia:find(&quot;Sol&quot;):getposition(now)
 earthpos = celestia:find(&quot;Sol/Earth&quot;):getposition(now)
 heliovector = sunpos:vectorto(earthpos)
 heliovector_x = heliovector:getx()
 heliovector_y = heliovector:gety()

=== normalize ===

vector {{Celx:func|vector:normalize()}}

Return a normalized &quot;vector&quot; object.&lt;br&gt;A normalized vector is a vector that points in the same direction as the original vector, but with '''length = 1'''.

'''Notes:'''
# This method does not modify the original vector.
# Normalizing a zero-length vector causes division by zero. The result will be a vector of NaNs.
# A CELX &quot;vector&quot; object is a geometric object that has both a length and direction [X, Y, Z] in a 3 dimensional coordinate system.
# The [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx vector|vector]] methods can be used on a CELX &quot;vector&quot; object. &quot;Vector&quot; objects can also be used in other methods, requiring a &quot;vector&quot; object as an argument.

'''Example:'''&lt;br&gt;create a vector that points from the actual position of Earth to the actual position of the Moon, with length = 1.

 earth = celestia:find(&quot;Sol/Earth&quot;)
 moon = celestia:find(&quot;Sol/Earth/moon&quot;)
 now = celestia:gettime()
 earthpos = earth:getposition(now)
 moonpos = moon:getposition(now)

* Small scale land use. By using the least possible area, marginal land is preserved in, or returned to, natural ecosystems.
* Diversity of species &amp; cultivars (types of plants) yields, microclimates, habitats, functions social roles &amp; work.
* Interweaving of agriculture, animal care, forestry, aquaculture, (water food systems), wilderness management, foraging, economics, culture, &amp; land form engineering (such as dams).
* Use of wild &amp; domestic plants &amp; animals. Rare, endangered &amp; indigenous are included.
* Uses the natural ways of plants, animals &amp; their relationships to the characteristics of landscape to create environmentally safe sustainable agriculture. This means energy &amp; biological resources including water &amp; soil, are conserved rebuilt, self-regulating &amp; self- repairing.

Your needs &amp; resources are unique &amp; important considerations, such as time available, physical ability, money, broad goals &amp; dreams. If this step is missed out the design will most likely not work!

==Base Plan==
Draw up a scale plan of everything that is on the land you are working with. This includes all structures, paths, vegetation (record whether it is evergreen or deciduous), power lines &amp; boundary. Leave a good - sized margin for the recording of the sector analysis.

==Observe &amp; record==
Start keeping a journal &amp; keep it going to record the changes &amp; your responses.  Ideally best done over a period of time to experience the changes each season brings. The skill of observation is a primary tool of Permaculture design. It enables us to gather info to start to see relationships &amp; correlations between elements &amp; so to develop strategies &amp; evolve site plans. We get in touch with the land &amp; all it offers.

*Watch for the comings &amp; goings of birds &amp; insects. When are they around? What are they doing? Identify them &amp; find out about their life cycles. This info will aid you greatly to design in good biological balance. 
*Look at the weeds/plants/trees. Wind shearing indicates strong prevailing wind. They can also tell you of soil types &amp; moisture levels. Light levels &amp; microclimates. Plants won’t grow where it doesn’t suit them!
*Look more closely at the structures you have mapped. What resources do they provide? Water catchment, shelter from wind, thermal mass, light reflection, greywater, kitchen scraps? What microclimates to they provide?
*Check out the resources you can find within &amp; without the boundaries of your land. List them all.  For example lupin bush, gorse &amp; broom provide nutrients &amp; can be cut before flowering &amp; laid as mulch around trees &amp; shrubs or composted in a slow composting system. Rocks, bricks, tin, wood, lawn clippings, branches to prune are all resources. 
*Off site ~ materials from the verges (includes propagation material), organic material from cafés, restaurants, sawmills, gardening business’, organisations for shredded paper, vacant lots, the “tip shop”. People for help in various ways, markets for income

==Resources==
Check out the resources you can find within &amp; without the boundaries of your land. List them all!Off site ~ materials from the verges (includes propagation material), organic material from cafés, restaurants, sawmills, gardening business’, organizations for shredded paper, vacant lots, the “tip shop”. 

==Sector Analysis==
Record all the incoming &amp; out going energies affecting the land ~ winds (are they strong &amp; cold bringing rain/ hail or hot &amp; drying?) &amp; what direction they come from &amp; when. How does the sun move from season to season? How water moves on &amp;/or off the land. Which direction would fires/floods come from? How does the surrounding landscape affect your plot? Do you have rain shadows, steep slopes which speed the winds up? Where are the views &amp;/or noise pollution coming from? Are there any existing wildlife corridors? This knowledge enables us to harness, modify or enhance the energies. It also helps us to plan zone placement &amp; the placement of many elements.Elevational planning looks at your site in profile which is useful when assessing slope.

==Data Overlay==
Lay transparent sheets of paper over the base map/sector analysis on which are mapped the info on soils &amp; micro climates you collect. It is a way of building up a picture of your plot. Aerial/topographic/cadastral maps can be useful too especially if you have a large area as they can, at a glance, give options not easily seen from the ground. They do lack detail &amp; conditions may have changed since they were made e.g. pollution.
*Elevational planning looks at your site in profile which is useful when assessing slope &amp; aspect which affect airflows &amp; can aid the flow of energies including yours.

==Micro climates==
Here’s an exercise you can do to gather info about the various micro climates, go to different areas of the land &amp; close your eyes. Use all your senses. Your skin will pick up subtle temperature changes &amp; air movements. Feel the soil beneath you for moisture, texture, mulch &amp; temperature. Squat as well as stand &amp; move around. Plants can be smaller than you! This info will enable you to use these areas &amp; enhance/modify them if necessary.

==Soils==
Take a spade &amp; go over your plot digging down to the spades depth. This will give you a basic idea of some of the different soil types you will be working with.  You need at least 30cm of good topsoil to enable healthy plants to grow. Some deeper rooted plants/trees/shrubs will require more.

==Analysis==
This tool enables you to create the beneficial relationships that are central to good Permaculture design. It leads to a great deal of creation! These relationships echo those you find in Nature. The principles of “co-operation not competition” &amp; “observe &amp; interact” apply here. Take an element that you want in your design. Look at all its needs &amp; what it gives ~ eg. a pond needs: shelter from wind, some sun, a water source/catchment, plants, fish, and aeration. It provides extra humidity &amp; light to the area surrounding it, moisture to the edges, thermal mass (holds heat &amp; radiates it out in the evening), food &amp; beauty. Its needs will be met, if placed in good relationship to other elements &amp; in return their needs will be met by it. Look at other elements that you have or need, in the same way &amp; see how you can place them so that their needs &amp; yields are met by each other. Cycles of energy are enhanced &amp; created this way.

==Deductions From Nature==
Here we look at nature to gain various ideas for strategies. How can we imitate nature? For example native plants on a windy site will have various ways to survive those conditions such as small leaves to reduce moisture loss. We can choose plants with similar characteristics for our windbreaks.  Look for differences &amp; ask yourself “why”?

==Zone Planning==
Even on a small section all zones from 0~5 can be included. See “Earth Users Guide to Permaculture Design” editions 1 or 2 by Rosemary Morrow.Zones are about creating &amp; placing areas of activity in good relationship to their needs &amp; yields. Eg zone 1 is traditionally placed as close to the house (zone 0) as possible, as it needs lots of visits to care for &amp; harvest from it. See yourself as a yield of zone 0. 
 
==Flow diagrams== 
If the land you are working with is already lived on look at how you move across it. How could this change when your design is implemented? Make the pathways multi – functional. You are a flow of energy in a Permaculture system for example you leave the house with the compost bucket &amp; a basket &amp; on the way back from the compost you can collect the eggs, &amp; pick some herbs/vegetables &amp; maybe grab a few pieces of wood or kindling from the woodpile.

==Random Assembly== 
This is a fun way to find some really creative ideas. It breaks up the logical way of thinking!Make two lists of elements &amp; put another list of connecting words(in,on,beside) in between them. Then have fun joining them up randomly!It can take some time to break through the “wanting things to make sense” way of being but some very good relationships, that never would have occurred otherwise, happen.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Installing QEMU==
Most GNU/Linux distributions have simple installation processes based on package
repositories. It is often best to use the repository approach for installing
QEMU, as you can be confident that it will just install and run. Here are some
examples:

{| class='wikitable'
! Distribution !! Install command
|-
| Fedora &lt;ref name='yum'&gt;Also valid for other RPM-based distributions (e.g. RedHat, CentOS).&lt;/ref&gt;|| &lt;code&gt;yum install qemu&lt;/code&gt;
|-
| Debian &lt;ref name='apt'&gt;Also valid for other dpkg-based distributions (e.g. Ubuntu, Mepis, Mint).&lt;/ref&gt;|| &lt;code&gt;apt-get install qemu&lt;/code&gt;
|-
| SUSE || &lt;code&gt;yast -i qemu&lt;/code&gt;
|-
| Gentoo || &lt;code&gt;emerge -av app-emulation/qemu&lt;/code&gt;
|-
| Mac (Homebrew) || &lt;code&gt;brew install qemu&lt;/code&gt;
|-
|}

If you can't install QEMU from a package repository, go to the QEMU website and [http://wiki.qemu.org/Download download] the latest source code and follow the instructions given.

For [[w:Microsoft Windows|Microsoft Windows]], you can install a GUI front-end to QEMU called [http://download.cnet.com/Qemu-Manager/3000-2094_4-75451507.html QEMU Manager], or get a [http://lassauge.free.fr/qemu/ vanilla QEMU installer].

===QEMU from source===

You might need or prefer to install QEMU by compiling the source code, which is available [http://wiki.qemu.org/Download on the QEMU website]. The QEMU Emulator User Documentation has [http://qemu.weilnetz.de/qemu-doc.html#compilation basic instructions] on how to compile the source code on Linux and Microsoft Windows.

==Installing QEMU-KVM==

QEMU by itself isn't very fast, as it does a lot of emulation even when running on the hardware compatible with the guest operating system. To make it perform better, QEMU has a kernel module called [http://www.linux-kvm.org/ KVM] that allows much of the guest OS's code to run directly on the host processor when running on x86 or x86-64 processors with [[w:x86 virtualization|virtualisation extensions]] under Linux. For example, if the host is x86 Linux and the guest is Windows XP, then KVM can run most of the Windows XP code directly on the processor without emulation.

QEMU-KVM requires a Linux or BSD Unix host, and a CPU with virtualisation extensions -- either Intel VT or AMD-V. To determine whether your CPU has this support on Linux, run the following command from a shell:

 egrep '(vmx|svm)' /proc/cpuinfo

If you get nothing back, your CPU does not support the required virtualisation extensions.

Many modern Linux distros have simple installation processes based on package repositories. It is often best to use the repository approach for installing QEMU-KVM, as you can be confident that QEMU-KVM will just install and run. Here are some common Linux distros and their QEMU-KVM install commands:

{| class='wikitable'
! Distribution !! Install command
|-
| Fedora &lt;ref name='yum'/&gt; || [http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Virtualization_Quick_Start yum install @virtualization] or &lt;code&gt;yum install qemu-kvm&lt;/code&gt;
|-
| Debian &lt;ref name='apt'/&gt; || &lt;code&gt;apt-get install kvm&lt;/code&gt;
|-
| SUSE || &lt;code&gt;yast -i kvm&lt;/code&gt;
|}

More details are available on the [http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/HOWTO KVM website]. If you can't install QEMU-KVM from a package repository, go to the QEMU-KVM website and [http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Downloads download] the latest source code and follow the instructions given.

      <comment>disc -&gt; disk (hard drive)</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Once QEMU has been installed, it should be ready to run a guest OS from a disk image. This image is a file that represents the data on a hard disk. From the perspective of the guest OS, it actually is a hard disk, and it can create its own filesystem on the virtual disc. 

You can download a few guest OS images from the [http://wiki.qemu.org/Testing QEMU website], including a simple 8MB image of a Linux distro (which is meant primarily for testing; note that [http://www.nuke24.net/docs/2012/QEMUNetworking.txt it lacks the e1000 driver] and therefore cannot do networking out-of-the-box). To run it, download and unzip the image in a folder and run the QEMU command.

 qemu linux-0.2.img

Replace ''linux-0.2.img'' with the name of your guest OS image file. If it has a GUI and you want to use your mouse with it, double-click on the window and QEMU will grab your mouse. To make QEMU release your mouse again, hold down the Control and Alt keys simultaneously, then let go - your mouse will be released back to X.

Aurélien Jarno of Debian has prepared a number of pre-packaged Debian qemu images for several architectures, including ARM, Sparc, PowerPC, x86_64, and i386. They can be found at http://people.debian.org/~aurel32/qemu/

For some of the test kernels that you get, for example, the sparc test image, you might get the error &quot;No NFS Server available giving up&quot; or some other message about needing to insert a &quot;Root Floppy&quot; or even a message specifying to fix the root option. If so then specify &quot;root=dev/ram&quot; as an addition kernel command line option. This will then cause the test system to work. This is specifically true for the sparc test files available from http://wiki.qemu.org/Testing but probably for some of the others as well. If you are using the manager program for windows then just add the &quot;root=/dev/ram/&quot; in the advanced tab. Also turn off video and sound and if using qemu-system-sparcw.exe then change the filename to qemu-system-sparc.exe becaue some renamed it. 

==Image types==

QEMU supports several image types. The &quot;native&quot; and most flexible type is ''qcow2'', which supports [[#Copy on write|copy on write]], encryption, compression, and VM snapshots.

QEMU currently supports these image types or formats:

;raw : (default) the raw format is a plain binary image of the disc image, and is very portable. On filesystems that support [[w:sparse file|sparse files]], images in this format only use the space actually used by the data recorded in them. 
;cloop : [[w:cloop|Compressed Loop]] format, mainly used for reading Knoppix and similar live CD image formats
;cow : [[w:Copy-on-write|copy-on-write]] format, supported for historical reasons only and not available to QEMU on Windows
;qcow : the old QEMU copy-on-write format, supported for historical reasons and superseded by qcow2
;qcow2 : QEMU copy-on-write format with a range of special features, including the ability to take multiple snapshots, smaller images on filesystems that don't support sparse files, optional AES encryption, and optional zlib compression
;vmdk : [[w:VMware|VMware]] 3 &amp; 4, or 6 image format, for exchanging images with that product
;vdi :  [[w:VirtualBox|VirtualBox]] 1.1 compatible image format, for exchanging images with VirtualBox.

==Creating an image==

To set up your own guest OS image, you first need to create a blank disc image. QEMU has the &lt;code&gt;qemu-img&lt;/code&gt; command for creating and manipulating disc images, and supports a variety of formats. If you don't tell it what format to use, it will use raw files. The &quot;native&quot; format for QEMU is qcow2, and this format offers some flexibility. Here we'll create a 3GB qcow2 image to install Windows XP on:

 qemu-img create -f qcow2 winxp.img 3G

The easiest way to install a guest OS is to create an ISO image of a boot CD/DVD and tell QEMU to boot off it. Many free operating systems can be downloaded from the Internet as bootable ISO images, and you can use them directly without having to burn them to disc.

Here we'll boot off an ISO image of a properly licensed Windows XP boot disc. We'll also give it 256MB of RAM, but we won't use the kqemu kernel module just yet because it causes problems during Windows XP installation.

 qemu -m 256 -hda winxp.img -cdrom winxpsp2.iso -boot d

To boot from a real CD or DVD, tell QEMU where to find it. On Linux systems, you can usually use a logical device name like &lt;code&gt;/dev/cdrom&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;/dev/dvd&lt;/code&gt;, or the physical name of the device, e.g. &lt;code&gt;/dev/sr0&lt;/code&gt;

 qemu -m 256 -hda winxp.img -cdrom /dev/cdrom -boot d

QEMU will boot from the ISO image or CD/DVD and run the install program. If you have two screens, move the QEMU screen off to the spare one where you can keep an eye on the installer, but get on with something else - it will take a while!

Once the guest OS has installed successfully, you can shutdown the guest OS (e.g. in Windows XP, click on Start and then Shutdown). Once it has shutdown, start QEMU up with the kqemu kernel module to give it a little more speed.

 qemu -m 256 -hda winxp.img -cdrom winxpsp2.iso -kernel-kqemu

If you are running an x86-64 Linux (i.e. 64-bit), you will need to run the x86-64 version of QEMU to be able to utilise kqemu:

 qemu-system-x86_64 -m 256 -hda winxp.img -cdrom winxpsp2.iso -kernel-kqemu

==Using multiple images==

QEMU can utilise up to four image files to present multiple virtual drives to the guest system. This can be quite useful, as in the following examples:

* a [[w:Paging|pagefile]] or swapfile virtual disc that can be shared between QEMU guests
* a common data drive where all data is stored, accessible from each QEMU guest but isolated from the host
* giving additional space to a QEMU guest without reconfiguring the primary image
* separating competing I/O operations onto different physical drive spindles by placing the separate QEMU images on different physical drives
* emulating a multi-drive physical environment for testing / learning

Bear in mind that only one instance of QEMU may access an image at a time - shared doesn't mean shared simultaneously!

To use additional images in QEMU, specify them on the command line with options -hda, -hdb, -hdc, -hdd. 

 qemu -m 256 -hda winxp.img -hdb pagefile.img -hdc testdata.img -hdd tempfiles.img -kernel-kqemu

NB: QEMU doesn't support both -hdc and -cdrom at the same time, as they both represent the first device on the second IDE channel.

==Copy on write==

The &quot;cow&quot; part of qcow2 is an acronym for [[w:Copy-on-write|copy on write]], a neat little trick that allows you to set up an image once and use it many times without changing it. This is ideal for developing and testing software, which generally requires a known stable environment to start off with. You can create your known stable environment in one image, and then create several disposable copy-on-write images to work in.

To start a new disposable environment based on a known good image, invoke the &lt;code&gt;qemu-img&lt;/code&gt; command with the option -b and tell it what image to base its copy on. When you run QEMU using the disposable environment, all writes to the virtual disc will go to this disposable image, not the base copy.

 qemu-img create -f qcow2 -b winxp.img test01.img 
 qemu -m 256 -hda test01.img -kernel-kqemu &amp;

The option -b is not supported on qemu-img, at least not in version 0.12.5. There you use the option backing_file, as shown here:

 qemu-img create -f qcow2 -o backing_file=winxp.img test01.img 

NB: don't forget to copy any important data out of the disposable environment before deleting it. When developing and testing software in copy-on-write virtual environments, it is a good idea to use [[w:Revision control|version control software]] like [[w:Subversion (software)|Subversion]] or [[w:Concurrent Versions System|CVS]] on a server external to your virtual environment. Not only is it easy to keep copies of your work outside your virtual environment, it is also very easy to set up a new virtual environment from version control.

==Mounting an image on the host==

Sometimes it is helpful to be able to mount a drive image under the host system. For example, if the guest doesn't have network support, the only way to transfer files into and out of the guest will be by the storage devices it can address.

Linux and other Unix-like hosts can mount images created with the ''raw'' format type using a loopback device. From a root login (or using sudo), mount a loopback with an offset of 32,256.

 mount -o loop,offset=32256 /path/to/image.img /mnt/mountpoint

For example, to copy some files across to a FreeDOS hard drive image:

 mkdir -p /mnt/freedos
 mount -o loop,offset=32256 freedos-c.img /mnt/freedos
 cp oldgames /mnt/freedos
 umount /mnt/freedos

NB: never mount a QEMU image while QEMU is using it (unless -snapshot is used), or you are likely to corrupt the filesystem on the image.

Note: if you have an image without partitions you should omit the ,offset=32256 part. This is for instance the case if you want to mount linux-0.2.img (which can be found at the qemu web site at the time of writing)

For other types of qemu images, you can use qemu-nbd

 modprobe nbd max_part=16
 qemu-nbd -c /dev/nbd0 image.qcow2
 partprobe /dev/nbd0
 mount /dev/nbd0p1 /mnt/image

Using '''fdisk''' you can get information regarding the different partitions in nbd0.

 $ fdisk /dev/nbd0
  Command (m for help): p
  Disk /dev/nbd0: 4294 MB, 4294967296 bytes
  255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 522 cylinders, total 8388608 sectors
  Units = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
  Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
  I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
  Disk identifier: 0x000183ca
       Device  Boot     Start        End      Blocks   Id  System
  /dev/nbd0p1   *        2048      499711      248832   83  Linux
  /dev/nbd0p2          501758     8386559     3942401    5  Extended
  /dev/nbd0p5          501760     8386559     3942400   8e  Linux LVM

LVM type partitions cannot be mounted using 'mount'. In such a case the image could be mounted with:

 $ vgscan
   Reading all physical volumes.  This may take a while...
   Found volume group &quot;ub1110server-qemu&quot; using metadata type lvm2
 $ vgchange -ay
    2 logical volume(s) in volume group &quot;ub1110server-qemu&quot; now active
 $ mount /dev/ub1110server-qemu/''&lt;LogicalVolumeName&gt;'' /mnt/image

Replace ''&lt;LogicalVolumeName&gt;'' with the name of the logical volume present in the volume group. Finally, after the usage its important to unmount the image and reverse other steps (depending on how the image was mounted):

 $ umount /mnt/image
 $ qemu-nbd -d /dev/nbd0
 $ vgchange -an VolGroupName
 $ killall qemu-nbd

&quot;nbd&quot; stands for &quot;Network Block Device&quot;. Here we're using them locally, but one can also export the image for other hosts to use/mount. See qemu-nbd(8), nbd-client(8) for details.

The same can be done for raw images, but it's a lot less efficient than the loop method described above.

Another alternative for vmdk and raw images is to use vdfuse (http://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=26&amp;t=33355) which allows to access any image supported by VirtualBox.

== Copying an image to a physical device ==
It may be desired to copy a diskimage to a physical device. An example may be if building a cluster, it might be easier to get everything ready in qemu, then write the final diskimage to all of the hard drives. Of course your image will need to contain all of required configuration and drivers for the new system to boot properly.

The diskimage will need to be in raw format.

 $ qemu-img convert -O raw diskimage.qcow2 diskimage.raw

Then you just dd it onto the hard drive.

 # dd if=diskimage.raw of=/dev/sda

Or, let qemu-img directly write onto the drive in one command:

 # qemu-img convert -O raw diskimage.qcow2 /dev/mydevice

Of course you need to be careful that you write it to the correct drive!

==Getting information==
The &lt;code&gt;qemu-img&lt;/code&gt; program can tell you about the format, virtual size, physical size, and snapshots inside an image.

 $ qemu-img info test.vmdk 
 (VMDK) image open: flags=0x2 filename=test.vmdk
 image: test.vmdk
 file format: vmdk
 virtual size: 20M (20971520 bytes)
 disk size: 17M

==Converting image formats==

The &lt;code&gt;qemu-img&lt;/code&gt; program can be used to convert images from one format to another, or add compression or encryption to an image. Specify the source and target files for the image, and select from the following options:

* &lt;code&gt;-f ''fmt''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; optional, specify the format of the input file (QEMU can usually detect it)
* &lt;code&gt;-O ''fmt''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; specify the format of the output file
* &lt;code&gt;-e&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; use encryption in the output file (you will be prompted for a password)
* &lt;code&gt;-c&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; use compression in the output file (can't be used with encryption)
* &lt;code&gt;-6&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; when converting to vmdk (VMware) format, make it compatible with VMware 6

 qemu-img convert -O qcow2 test.vmdk test.qcow2

===Exchanging images with VirtualBox===

qemu also supports the ''vdi'' format, so you can convert in both ways:
 qemu-img convert -O vdi test.qcow2 test.vdi

qemu can use the vdi format for booting as well as a base image;
because VirtualBox also supports this type of image, called there differencing image,
a single (read-only) base copy could be shared simultaneously.

In any case, you may use the ''raw'' format (or a ''nbd'' device):
 
To convert a QEMU image for use with [[w:VirtualBox|VirtualBox]], first convert it to ''raw'' format, then use VirtualBox's conversion utility to convert and compact it in its native format. Note that the compact command requires the full path to the VirtualBox image, not just the filename.
 qemu-img convert -O raw test.qcow2 test.raw
 (1) VBoxManage convertdd test.raw test.vdi
 VBoxManage modifyvdi /full/path/to/test.vdi compact

(1) or try :
 VBoxManage convertfromraw -format VDI test.raw test.vdi
 or
 VBoxManage clonehd -format VDI test.raw test.vdi

Alternatively, you may use qemu-nbd to make the image available as raw as a nbd device, which VBoxManage can then convert.

 qemu-nbd -c /dev/nbd0 test.qcow2
 VBoxManage convertfromraw -format VDI /dev/nbd0 test.vdi

To convert a VDI back to raw, one may use VBoxManage again:

 VBoxManage clonehd -format RAW test.vdi test.raw
or
 VBoxManage internalcommands  converttoraw file.vdi file.raw

To use a VDI image from kvm without converting it, vdfuse may be used again.

 vdfuse -f test.vdi ~/some-dir
 kvm -hda ~/some-dir/EntireDisk ...

      <text xml:space="preserve">QEMU supports networking by emulating some popular network cards (NICs), and establishing [[w:Virtual LAN|virtual LANs]] (VLAN). There are four ways how QEMU guests can be connected then: user mode, socket redirection, Tap and VDE networking.

==User mode networking==

If no network options are specified, QEMU will default to emulating a single Intel e1000 PCI card with a user-mode network stack that bridges to the host's network. The following two command lines are equivalent:

 qemu -m 256 -hda disk.img &amp;
 qemu -m 256 -hda disk.img -net nic -net user &amp;

The guest OS will see an E1000 NIC with a virtual DHCP server on 10.0.2.2 and will be allocated an address starting from 10.0.2.15. A virtual DNS server will be accessible on 10.0.2.3, and a virtual SAMBA file server (if present) will be accessible on 10.0.2.4 allowing you to access files on the host via SAMBA file shares.

User mode networking is great for allowing access to network resources, including the Internet. By default, however, it acts as a firewall and does not permit any incoming traffic. It also doesn't support protocols other than TCP and UDP - so, for example, ping and other ICMP utilities won't work.

===Redirecting ports===

To allow network connections to the guest OS under user mode networking, you can redirect a port on the host OS to a port on the guest OS. This is useful for supporting file sharing, web servers and SSH servers from the guest OS. 

Here is how to set up QEMU with a Windows XP guest sharing files and web pages under user mode networking. TCP port 5555 on the host is redirected to the guest's port 80 (the web server) and TCP port 5556 on the host is redirected to the guest's port 445 (Windows networking):

 qemu -m 256 -hda disk.img -redir tcp:5555::80 -redir tcp:5556::445 &amp;
 ...
 mkdir -p /mnt/qemu
 mount -t cifs //localhost/someshare /mnt/qemu -o user=test,pass=test,dom=workgroup,port=5556
 firefox &lt;nowiki&gt;http://localhost:5555/&lt;/nowiki&gt;

NB: When sharing folders from guest to host via Windows networking, you must specify a password for the user that mount will use to login; if you try to use no password, mount will fail with an I/O error.

==TAP interfaces==

QEMU can use TAP interfaces to provide full networking capability for the guest OS. This can be useful when the guest OS is running several network services and must be connected to via standard ports; where protocols other than TCP and UDP are required; and where multiple instances of QEMU need to connect to each other (although this can also be achieved in user mode networking via port redirects, or via sockets).

In QEmu 1.1 and newer the [http://wiki.qemu.org/Features/HelperNetworking network bridge helper] can set tun/tap up for you without the need for additional scripting.

For older versions, setting up a TAP interface is a bit more complicated than user mode networking. It requires installing virtual private networking (VPN) on the host OS, and then establishing a bridge between the host's networking and the virtual network. 

Here's how to do it on Fedora 8 with static IP address assignment. The procedure should be very similar on other Linux distros, and probably not too different on other *nix systems.

===TAP/TUN device===
According to [http://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/networking/tuntap.txt tuntap.txt], we create the TAP/TUN device first:
    $ sudo mkdir /dev/net
    $ sudo mknod /dev/net/tun c 10 200
    $ sudo /sbin/modprobe tun

===qemu-ifup===

First, set up a script to create the bridge and bring up the TAP interface. We'll call this script &lt;code&gt;/etc/qemu-ifup&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;pre&gt;
#!/bin/sh 
# 
# script to bring up the tun device in QEMU in bridged mode 
# first parameter is name of tap device (e.g. tap0)
#
# some constants specific to the local host - change to suit your host
#
ETH0IPADDR=192.168.0.3
GATEWAY=192.168.0.1
BROADCAST=192.168.0.255
#
# First take eth0 down, then bring it up with IP address 0.0.0.0 
#
/sbin/ifdown eth0
/sbin/ifconfig eth0 0.0.0.0 promisc up
#
# Bring up the tap device (name specified as first argument, by QEMU)
#
/usr/sbin/openvpn --mktun --dev $1 --user `id -un`
/sbin/ifconfig $1 0.0.0.0 promisc up
#
# create the bridge between eth0 and the tap device
#
/usr/sbin/brctl addbr br0
/usr/sbin/brctl addif br0 eth0
/usr/sbin/brctl addif br0 $1
# 
# only a single bridge so loops are not possible, turn off spanning tree protocol
#
/usr/sbin/brctl stp br0 off 
# 
# Bring up the bridge with ETH0IPADDR and add the default route 
#
/sbin/ifconfig br0 $ETH0IPADDR netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast $BROADCAST
/sbin/route add default gw $GATEWAY
#
# stop firewall - comment this out if you don't use Firestarter
#
/sbin/service firestarter stop 
&lt;/pre&gt;

===qemu-ifdown===

You will also need a script to reset your networking after QEMU exits. To be consistent, we'll call it &lt;code&gt;/etc/qemu-ifdown&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;pre&gt;
#!/bin/sh 
# 
# Script to bring down and delete bridge br0 when QEMU exits 
# 
# Bring down eth0 and br0 
#
/sbin/ifdown eth0
/sbin/ifdown br0
/sbin/ifconfig br0 down 
# 
# Delete the bridge
#
/usr/sbin/brctl delbr br0 
# 
# bring up eth0 in &quot;normal&quot; mode 
#
/sbin/ifconfig eth0 -promisc
/sbin/ifup eth0 
#
# delete the tap device
#
/usr/sbin/openvpn --rmtun --dev $1
#
# start firewall again
# 
/sbin/service firestarter start 
&lt;/pre&gt;

===Allowing users to call the scripts===

In qemu 1.1 and above just use the [http://wiki.qemu.org/Features/HelperNetworking|network helper program], which doesn't require any scripts and can be setuid root.

For older versions, the two scripts above need to be run as the superuser, so that they can modify the network settings of the system. The most convenient way to achieve that is to permit users of QEMU to call the scripts using the &lt;code&gt;sudo&lt;/code&gt; command. To set this up, add the following to the file &lt;code&gt;/etc/sudoers&lt;/code&gt;:

 User_Alias QEMUERS = fred, john, milly, ...
 
 Cmnd_Alias QEMU = /etc/qemu-ifup, /etc/qemu-ifdown
 
 QEMUERS ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: QEMU

===Starting QEMU with a TAP interface===

Now create a script to start QEMU with a VLAN, and clean up after itself when it exits. This one uses tap0. Specifying &lt;code&gt;script=no&lt;/code&gt; tells QEMU to just use the tap device without calling the scripts - we do this so that QEMU can be run as a regular user, not root.

&lt;pre&gt;
#!/bin/sh 
sudo /etc/qemu-ifup tap0
qemu -m 256 -hda disk.img -net nic -net tap,ifname=tap0,script=no,downscript=no
sudo /etc/qemu-ifdown tap0
&lt;/pre&gt;

Run that script, and it will create a TAP interface, bridge it to eth0, run QEMU, and drop the bridge and TAP interface again on exit.

==Sockets==

QEMU can connect multiple QEMU guest systems on a VLAN using TCP or UDP sockets.

[http://www.gnome.org/~markmc/qemu-networking.html described here]

==SMB server==

If the host system has a [[w:Server Message Block|SMB]] server installed (SAMBA/CIFS on *nix), QEMU can emulate a virtual SMB server for the guest system using the -smb option. Specify the folder to be shared, and it will be available to the guest as \\10.0.2.4\qemu (or you can put 10.0.2.4 into the hosts or lmhosts file as smbserver and map to \\smbserver\qemu).

 qemu -m 256 disk.img -smb /usr/workspace/testing01

This isn't strictly necessary, because guests in QEMU can typically access SMB servers in the host environment. It can be quite useful, however, for setting up independent workspaces for each QEMU guest without needing to configure SMB shares for each one.

==External links==

Uses tap devices similar to here but doesn't touch your real network interfaces. Similar to vmnet1-vmnet7 in Vmware. Then, use iptables to configure your subnets like you would do with real physical private subnets on your LAN]

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Preface =
This book tells about a leading Open Source ERP system. It is of French origin, but multilingual and deployed in many countries. It is versatile, powerful, complex, abstract and free. We (authors) think it is great, and we want it to be used by more people so that there is a community of users supporting each other in a true Open Source spirit. This is why we are writing this handbook. 

= Audience =
This book is written for people, who are interested in developing, implementing ERP5 - ERP Open Source system. You will learn basics of ERP5 - usage, development - and ways of searching for more help. If you are a technician, consultant or hacker - this book is for you. If you are  a businessman without time for hacking through big systems with many connections this book is not for you. Take a look at [http://erp5.org erp5.org] and hand this page over to your IT guy.

Keep in mind that ERP systems are quite complex - you will need time to deploy its test installation.

= What you should know before proceeding =

An ERP5 system uses the following technologies (programming language, server side technology, relational database...). Your set-up should be similar, and familiarity with them will help.

* Python programming language
* Zope, version 2, application server
* XML
* MySQL relational database
* Subversion - version control system

Of course experience in business and modelling business processes is quite helpful.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A default fcgiext.ini file:
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
; -----------
; fcgiext.ini
; -----------
;
; This is the configuration file for the FastCGI handler for IIS 6.0.
; The FastCGI handler will look for this file in the same directory as
; fcgiext.dll.  By default, the FastCGI installer will place this file into
; the %windir%\system32\inetsrv directory.
;
; The configuration for FastCGI is a collection of one or more applications.
; A FastCGI application consists of a pool of processes that each handle HTTP
; requests.  Each process in the pool will handle one request at a time.
; After each request, the process will be returned to the pool to await
; another request.  Each application is required to have its own section in
; the configuration file to specify its behavior.
;
; The main section of the fcgiext.ini file is the [types] section.  This
; section associates file extensions from the URL with FastCGI applications.
;
; The general syntax is a follows:
;
; [types]
; abc=Application 1
; def=Application 2
; def:1701187997=Application 3
; *=Application 4
; *:1701187997=Application 5
;
; The above example consists of 5 mappings mapped as follows:
;
; - The file extension &quot;abc&quot; is associated with the FastCGI application
;   named &quot;Application 1&quot;.
;
; - The file extension &quot;def&quot; is associated with the FastCGI application
;   named &quot;Application 2&quot;.
;
; - The file extension &quot;def&quot; is associated with the FastCGI application
;   named &quot;Application 3&quot;, but only for requests made to the web site
;   with the numeric identifier &quot;1701187997&quot;.  Note that site-specific
;   mappings override non-site-specific mappings.
;
; - Requests with a file extension that does not have a specific mapping
;   are associated with the FastCGI application named &quot;Application 4&quot;.
;
; - Requests to the web site with the identifier &quot;1701187997&quot; with a file
;   extension that does not have a specific mapping are associated with
;   the FastCGI application named &quot;Application 5&quot;.
;
; Note that application names are ASCII and should generally contain only
; alphanumeric characters, and spaces are allowed.  Application names are
; case-insensitive.
;
; Note also that it is allowed for multiple mappings to be associated with
; the same FastCGI application.
;
; The following is a sample application section.  Note that the name of
; the section must correspond to at least one mapping in the [types] section
; in order to be used:
;
; [Application 1]
;
; ExePath=string
; - The ExePath property specifies the executable for the FastCGI process,
;   where 'string' is the full path to the executable.  A non-empty string
;   is required.
;
; Arguments=string
; - The Arguments property specifies any arguments to be passed to the
;   FastCGI executable, where 'string' represents the arguments.  Multiple
;   arguments may be space delimited. If there is a space within the argument
;   then this argument must be placed in quotes. This property is optional.
;
; EnvironmentVars=string
; - The EnvironmentVars property specifies optional environment variables
;   that will be set in the FastCGI executable.  If any of the supplied
;   variable names collide with existing server variables, the ones specified
;   in this property will be used.  The format of the string is a comma
;   delimited list in the form of 'name1:value1,name2:value2'.  If a
;   delimiting character, such as a comma, semicolon or slash is necessary in
;   a value, it can be preceded by a '/' character (For example:
;   'name1:with/,commas,name2:with/;semicolon,name3:with//slash'.  This
;   property is optional.
;
; Protocol=string
; - Specifies the protocol used to communicate with the FastCGI process.
;   The allowed values are 'NamedPipe' and 'Tcp'.  If not specified, the
;   default value is 'NamedPipe'.
;
; MaxInstances=n
; - Specifies the maximum number of processes that are allowed in the
;   application's process pool.  This number directly corresponds to the
;   maximum number of concurrent requests that can be handled by the
;   application.  If not specified, the default value is 10.
;
; QueueLength=n
; - Specifies the maximum number of requests to this application that will
;   be queued before the FastCGI handler starts returning errors to clients
;   indicating that the application is too busy.  If not specified, the default
;   value is 1000.
;
; IdleTimeout=n
; - Specifies the time, in seconds, that a FastCGI process for this application
;   is allowed to remain idle.  If a process remains idle for longer than this
;   period, it will be shut down.  If not specified, the default value is
;   300 seconds.
;
; ActivityTimeout=n
; - Specifies the maximum time, in seconds, that a FastCGI process for this
;   application is allowed to run without communicating with IIS.  In practice,
;   this timeout is used to detect and shut down 'hung' processes.  If not
;   specified, the default value is 30 seconds.
;
; RequestTimeout=n
; - Specifies the maximum allowed time, in seconds, for a request to this
;   application.  If a FastCGI process takes longer than this amount of time
;   on a single request, it will be terminated.  If not specified, the default
;   value is 90 seconds.
;
; InstanceMaxRequests=n
; - Specifies the number of requests a FastCGI process for this application is
;   allowed to handle.  After handling this number of requests, it is shut
;   down so that it can be replaced with a new process.  If not specified, the
;   default value is 1000.
;
; ResponseBufferLimit=n
; - Data from FastCGI processes is buffered before being returned to the client
;   as responses.  This property specifies the amount of response data, in
;   bytes, that will be buffered for requests to this application.  This buffer
;   will be flushed to the client once it is full, or when the response is
;   complete, whichever occurs first.  If not specified, the default value is
;   4194304 (4MB).
;
; FlushNamedPipe=n
; - Specifies whether or not the named pipe between FastCGI processes for this
;   application is flushed before shutting down the application.  Possible
;   values are 0 or 1.  For most applications, 0 is the correct value.  If you
;   see processes hanging after InstanceMaxRequests has been reached, try
;   setting this value to 1.  If not specified, the default value is 0.
;
; UnhealthyOnQueueFull=n
; - If 1, the worker process hosting is flagged to IIS as unhealthy any time
;   that the application's request queue is filled.  IIS checks health whenever
;   it does a ping to the worker process.  If that worker process has been
;   flagged as unhealthy, it (along with everything it is hosting) will be
;   recycled.  If not specified, the default value is 0.
;
; IgnoreExistingFiles=n
; - If 1, this application will ignore any requests where the target file
;   exists on the file system, so that IIS can serve them normally.  This
;   feature is useful in the case where the FastCGI handler is installed as
;   a wildcard script map.  If not specified, the default value is 0.  Note
;   that this feature only applies only to IIS 6.0.
;
; IgnoreExistingDirectories=n
; - If 1, this application will ignore any requests where the target is a
;   directory on the file system, so that IIS can serve them normally.  This
;   feature is useful in the case where the FastCGI handler is installed as
;   a wildcard script map.  If not specified, the default value is 0.  Note
;   that this feature only applies only to IIS 6.0.

'''Working in rounds''' in crochet does not require any special equipment.  Unlike knitting, where special needles may be necessary, an ordinary crochet hook can work in rounds.

== Getting started ==
Make a chain of four stitches.  Then stitch into the start of the chain to make a loop.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Bit Strings==

Erlang lets us use Bit Strings. They have the form 
 &lt;&lt;Value:Bitlength&gt;&gt; or &lt;&lt;v1:length1,v2:length2,...&gt;&gt;

The default bit length is 8.
 65&gt; &lt;&lt;1:8&gt;&gt; == &lt;&lt;1&gt;&gt;. 
 true

Bit strings are padded on the left.
 66&gt; &lt;&lt;1:8&gt;&gt; == &lt;&lt;00000001&gt;&gt;. 
 true

Some bit strings have string-like representations.
 38&gt; &lt;&lt;00011111&gt;&gt;.
 &lt;&lt;&quot;g&quot;&gt;&gt;

We can select parts of a bit string with pattern matching.
 45&gt; &lt;&lt;H:2,T:6&gt;&gt; = &lt;&lt;&quot;A&quot;&gt;&gt;. 
 &lt;&lt;&quot;A&quot;&gt;&gt;
 46&gt; H. 
 1
 47&gt; T.
 1 
 86&gt; &lt;&lt;01000001&gt;&gt; == &lt;&lt;&quot;A&quot;&gt;&gt;.
 true
 87&gt; &lt;&lt;1:2,1:6&gt;&gt; == &lt;&lt;&quot;A&quot;&gt;&gt;.
 true
 88&gt; &lt;&lt;65&gt;&gt; == &lt;&lt;&quot;A&quot;&gt;&gt;.
 true

We can match X to a value.
 95&gt; &lt;&lt;1:2,X:6&gt;&gt; = &lt;&lt;&quot;A&quot;&gt;&gt;. 
 &lt;&lt;&quot;A&quot;&gt;&gt;
 96&gt; X.
 1

But we can not match Y to a bit length. 
 97&gt; &lt;&lt;1:2,1:Y&gt;&gt; = &lt;&lt;&quot;A&quot;&gt;&gt;.
 ** 1: variable 'Y' is unbound **

      <text xml:space="preserve">The [http://www.w3.org/RDF/Validator/ RDF Validation service] can be used to graph RDF, but since this expands prefixed names to full URIs the graphs can look rather un-readable as examples. 

This service is for drawing simple triple graphs where each triple is defined in a local XML format in which each triple has attributes subject, property and object.  [XQuery function to convert RDF to N3 needed] 

Subjects and objects are drawn as nodes, triples as arcs with the property as the label. If the subject or object contains ':' or starts with 'http://', then the node is shown as an ellipse. If it starts with '_' it is a blank node and an unnamed circle is shown; otherwise the node is assumed to be a literal and is drawn in a box.

==Endpoint ==

=== Heading text ===
== Parameters ==
* url : url of triples in the xml format illustrated above
* dir :  LR - left to right (default), TB - top to bottom [ rankdir in Graphviz]
* title : title for graph - default none

== Usage ==
Either save the generated gif, or use [http://www.screen-capture.net/ 5clicks] or similar to capture the image on the screen. One way to print large GIF images is to save the image, then insert it into an Excel spreadsheet.  Excel will print the image over multiple pages.  Reduced in size and with page borders removed, even large graphs can be printed and then taped together.

== Source ==

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare option exist:serialize &quot;method=text media-type=text/text&quot;;
declare variable $nl := &quot;&amp;#10;&quot;;
declare variable $url := request:get-parameter(&quot;url&quot;,());
declare variable $dir := request:get-parameter(&quot;dir&quot;,&quot;LR&quot;);
declare variable $title := request:get-parameter(&quot;title&quot;,&quot;&quot;);

let $graph := doc($url)
return   ( 
  &quot;digraph &quot;,$title, &quot; { rankdir='&quot; , $dir,&quot;' &quot;, $nl,
   for $node in distinct-values(($graph//triple/@subject,$graph//triple/@object))
   let $nodetype := 
     if (contains($node,&quot;:&quot;) or starts-with ($node,&quot;http://&quot;)) 
     then concat ('label=&quot;',$node,'&quot; shape=ellipse') 
     else if (starts-with($node,&quot;_&quot;))
     then 'shape=circle'
     else concat ('label=&quot;',$node,'&quot; shape=box') 
   return 
     concat ('&quot;',$node,'&quot; [',$nodetype,'];',$nl)
    ,
     for $triple in $graph//triple
     return 
      ( concat ('&quot;', $triple/@subject, '&quot; -&gt; &quot;' , $triple/@object ,'&quot; [label=&quot;',$triple/@property, '&quot;];'), $nl)
    ,
   &quot;} &quot;,$nl
)

&lt;/source&gt;

This script would be improved by the use of an intermediate XML structure and a XSLT script to convert to dot.

This tutorial is intended as an improvement on its prequel, [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Platformer: Creation and Controls|Platformer: Creation and Controls]], and will require files created through that tutorial. It is also recommended that you read [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/An aMAZEing game engine tutorial|An aMAZEing game engine tutorial]] as well before beginning this tutorial. It will require a familiarity with the Blender UI, simple commands (such as AKEY to select) and basic modeling skills. This tutorial will introduce the following features and improvements:

# only letting the character jump while touching the ground
# stop the character from bouncing greatly upon hitting an object
# where to adjust material friction

This tutorial was written for version 2.45.

==Creating Your Hit Test Object==

Copy the cube with '''SHIFT-D'''. Go into edit mode, select the bottom four vertices of the cube and delete them. Go back to object mode. Go to the editing panel in the buttons window. In the Link and Materials section, change the ME: value to &quot;Square&quot; and the OB: value to &quot;FloorHit&quot;. In the Mesh section, there will be three buttons with the word &quot;center&quot; in them; Center, Center New, and Center Cursor. Press Center New. This will change the origin of the &quot;Square&quot; mesh to the center of all of its vertices, instead of the center of the cube you made it from. Scale it to 0.99% of the original and move it up 0.01 along Z. Now go to the shading panel and make sure you're in the Material buttons subpanel. Find Links and Pipeline, and make sure &quot;ME is selected. Click the X next to the material selection (under the words &quot;Link to Object&quot;). Then select &quot;OB&quot; and press &quot;Add New&quot; and name this material &quot;FloorHit&quot; (again, no quotes). Make it green colored, so you can easily find it while editing, but turn on &quot;Shadeless&quot; and &quot;No Mist&quot; in the Material section and &quot;OnlyCast&quot; in the Links and Pipeline - Render Pipeline section and turn off &quot;Radio&quot;, &quot;Traceable&quot;, and &quot;Shad(ow)buffer&quot; in the Render Pipeline and &quot;Shadow&quot; in the Shaders section. This will make it completely invisible at runtime and take up little resources.

(question: it wont make it invisible it just flashes rapidly)

===Making the sensor require floor contact===

Now select Suzanne and go to the logic panel. Add a touch sensor called &quot;jumpcol&quot; (for 'jump collision') and connect it to the same AND controller as the jump keyboard sensor. Set the f to 10 and the MA: to FloorHit. This will make it so your character can only jump while it's touching something with the FloorHit material. By that same token you can link this to ''all'' of your movement-related AND controllers so that the player can't adjust it's movements in mid-air. This is a nice physics touch but for most platformer games, where mid-air dexterity is almost essential, it doesn't work. You also have to use Force and not dLoc, otherwise your character won't be able to move at all while jumping, useless your character only needs to hit things with his/her head, and not jump over gaps. Note that this still does not keep the character from jumping while touching the hit test object at the sides, so they could still jump if they were touching the side of the collision surface, but at least they can't jump in mid-air or while touching the bottom of the ground. I have yet to find a solution to this problem not involving Python.

==Excessive Bouncing==

Another problem with the original model, as you might have noticed, is that when you run into one of the ground cubes you bounce back a great deal. To fix this, turn to the materials panel with one of your green hit test squares selected. Under the color selectors there should be three buttons that say &quot;RGB&quot;, &quot;HSV&quot;, and &quot;DYN&quot;. Select DYN, and turn the restitution most or all the way up. As you can see, you can also find the friction property from here, if you want your ground to be more or less frictional (like mud or ice).

==Final Notes==

Always copy your floors, their respective hit test objects, and other generic objects with '''ALT-D''' and not '''SHIFT-D'''. This keeps you from duplicating things that remain the same for every one, like the material and mesh, which quickly drain resources if not recycled. Since there's not much further you can take the Platformer without learning Python, I suggest you start looking up information on the Blender API. Some essential information is to be found in the [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Advanced Tutorials/Python Scripting/Procedural object creation|procedural object creation]] tutorial. A Blend file of the tutorial's finished product is coming soon.

'''Note''': A (possibly) simpler method for jump limitation can be found on the discussion page for this tutorial.

&lt;big&gt;'''Soft Tissue Sarcoma Randomized Evidence'''&lt;/big&gt;


==Amputation vs Limb-sparing surgery + EBRT==
*'''National Cancer Institute'''(1975-1981) -- amputation vs limb-sparing surgery + RT
**Randomized. 43 patients with high grade soft tissue sarcomas of the extremities, without distant mets or LN. Randomized to Arm 1) amputation at the joint promixal to the tumor or Arm 2) limb-sparing resection (wide local excision with several cm of normal tissue, SM+ allowed at critical structures) + postop RT.  Randomization 2:1 (limb-sparing vs amp). RT 45-50 Gy followed by a boost to 60-70 Gy. All pts received post-op adriamycin + cytoxan (which was concurrent for those in the RT arm) then high-dose methotrexate.  Chemo doses were: ADR (max 70 mg/m^2), CYC (max 700 mg/m^2), MTX (250 mg/kg). SM+ in limb salvage 15% vs amputation 0%
**'''1982''' PMID 7114936 &amp;mdash; &quot;The treatment of soft-tissue sarcomas of the extremities: prospective randomized evaluations of (1) limb-sparing surgery plus radiation therapy compared with amputation and (2) the role of adjuvant chemotherapy.&quot;  (Rosenberg SA et al. Ann Surg. 1982 Sep;196(3):305-15.) Median F/U 4.8 years
***Outcome: Local failure limb-sparing 15% vs amputation 0% (p=0.06); of the 4 LRs, 1 was isolated and 3 combined with DM. 5-year DFS 71% vs 78% (NS); 5-year OS 83% vs 88% (NS)
***Conclusion: Limb-sparing surgery + postop RT is an effective treatment for most patients

==Surgery Alone vs Surgery + Postop EBRT==
*'''National Cancer Institute''' (1983-1991) -- RT (or chemo-RT) vs observation (or chemo)
**Randomized. 141 patients with extremity sarcoma (allowed desmoid and DFSP). Limb-sparing surgery, allowed SM+. High-grade (n=91) randomized to Arm 1) Postop RT 63 Gy with concurrent chemo (doxorubicin + cyclophosphamide) x5 cycles vs Arm 2) Chemo alone. Low-grade (n=50) randomized to Arm 1) Same RT without chemo vs Arm 2) observation
**'''1998''' PMID 9440743 &amp;mdash; &quot;Randomized prospective study of the benefit of adjuvant radiation therapy in the treatment of soft tissue sarcomas of the extremity.&quot; (Yang JC et al. J Clin Oncol. 1998 Jan;16(1):197-203.) Median F/U 9.6 years
***High grade: local recurrence chemo-RT 0% vs chemo 19% (SS); 10-year DSS (NS), 10-year OS 75% vs 74% (NS)
***Low grade tumors: local recurrence RT 4% vs observation 33% (SS); 10-year OS (NS)
***Toxicity: Decreased muscle strength, joint motion, and worse edema. Little effect on overall satisfaction and daily activities.
***Conclusions: Postop RT highly effective at preventing local recurrence, though select patients with low risk of LR may not require adjuvant RT

==Surgery Alone vs Surgery + Postop Brachytherapy==
*'''Memorial Sloan Kettering''' (1982-1992) -- Adjuvant brachytherapy vs observation
**Randomized. 164 patients, soft tissue sarcoma of extremity of superficial trunk. Gross total resection (en-bloc) with limb sparing surgery. Arm 1) Adjuvant brachytherapy I-192 implant 42-45 Gy over 4-6 days vs. Arm 2) observation. Brachytherapy CTV 2cm around surgical bed, catheters 1 cm apart; no effort to treat surgical scar, drain, or wide margins. Catheters loaded immediately until 1985, then due to complications on postop day 5
**'''Long-term; 1996''' PMID 8622034 -- &quot;Long-term results of a prospective randomized trial of adjuvant brachytherapy in soft tissue sarcoma.&quot; (Pisters PW, J Clin Oncol. 1996 Mar;14(3):859-68.) Median F/U 6.3 years
***Outcome: 5-year local control BT 82% vs observation 69% (SS); high-grade 89% vs 66% (SS); no difference low-grade. On MVA, local recurrence predicted only by age &gt;60. If SM-, local recurrence BT 13% vs observation 28% (SS); if SM+ 33% vs 36% (NS). DM 17% vs 24% (NS); 5-year DSS 84% vs 81% (NS)
***Complications: Catheters initially loaded day 0-5, higher wound complication BT 48% vs observation 16%. In 1985 started loading on day 5, and then no difference in rate of complications (14% vs 10%)
***Conclusion: Adjuvant brachytherapy improves local control, in high-grade histology, but not distant mets or disease-specific survival

==Pre-op EBRT vs. Post-op EBRT==
*'''NCI Canada''' (1994-97)
**Randomized. ''Closed early after interim significant difference for wound healing.'' Accrued 190 patients out of 266 planned. STS originating in limb without mets, expected to need both surgery and RT. Recurrences allowed. Primary endpoint was major wound complications. Arm 1) Preop RT 50/25, if SM+ additional 16-20 Gy post-op boost vs. Arm 2) Postop RT 50/25 + 16-20 Gy boost. RT initial field 5 cm proximal/distal margin, boost 2 cm proximal/distal margin. Longitudinal strip of skin/SC tissue untreated for at least half the course, unless margin &lt;2 cm not confined by intact fascial boundary. Timing 3-6 weeks apart
**'''5-years; 2004''' [http://www.asco.org/ASCO/Abstracts+%26+Virtual+Meeting/Abstracts?&amp;vmview=abst_detail_view&amp;confID=26&amp;abstractID=1087 ASCO Abstract] -- &quot;Five-year results of a randomized phase III trial of pre-operative vs post-operative radiotherapy in extremity soft tissue sarcoma.&quot; (O'Sullivan B, Journal of Clinical Oncology, 2004 ASCO Annual Meeting Proceedings (Post-Meeting Edition). Vol 22, No 14S (July 15 Supplement), 2004: 9007). Median F/U 6.9 years
***Outcome: 5-year LC preop RT 93% vs. postop RT 92% (NS), RFS 58% vs. 59% (NS), OS 73% vs. 67% (NS). Predictors for outcome SM+ for LC, size and grade for RFS and OS
***Conclusion: Pre-op and post-op RT equally effective for disease control and survival; different complication profiles should guide treatment by site
**'''Late effects; 2005''' PMID 15948265, 2005 &amp;mdash; &quot;Late radiation morbidity following randomization to preoperative versus postoperative radiotherapy in extremity soft tissue sarcoma.&quot; (Davis AM, Radiother Oncol. 2005 Apr;75(1):48-53. 
***Post-op RT associated with worse fibrosis as well as joint stiffness (although not statistically significant). 
***Outcome: Grade 2+ fibrosis pre-op RT 31% vs. post-op RT 48% (p=0.07); edema, and joint stiffness also more severe in pre-op arm
***Conclusion: Post-op RT tended to result in more fibrosis, adversely affecting patient function

==IORT + Postop EBRT vs Postop EBRT==
*'''NCI''' -- Intraop RT + postop RT vs. Postop RT alone
**Randomized. 35 patients, surgically resected retroperitoneal sarcoma. Arm 1) IORT 20 Gy + Post-op EBRT 35-40 Gy vs. Arm 2) Post-op EBRT 50-55 Gy. Chemotherapy doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, MTX. 
**'''1993''' PMID 8457152 -- &quot;Intraoperative radiotherapy in retroperitoneal sarcomas. Final results of a prospective, randomized, clinical trial.&quot; (Sindelar WF, Arch Surg. 1993 Apr;128(4):402-10.) Minimum F/U 5 years
***Outcome: Median OS IORT 3.7 years vs PORT 4.3 years (NS). Local failure IORT 40% vs. PORT 80%
***Complications: radiation enteritis IORT 13% vs. PORT 50%, peripheral neuropathy 60% vs. 5%
***Conclusion: No survival benefit, improved local control with IORT

==Surgery Alone vs Surgery + Adjuvant Chemotherapy==
*'''NCI''' (1978-1981) -- surgery +/- adjuvant chemotherapy
**Randomized. 65 patients with STS of the extremities. Arm 1) surgery (limb-sparing or amputation) vs Arm 2) surgery + adjuvant chemo (doxorubicin 70 mg/m2 + cytoxan 700 mg/m2, then high dose MTX 250 mg/kg
**'''1988''' PMID 3047339 -- &quot;Adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with high-grade soft-tissue sarcomas of the extremity.&quot; (Chang AE, J Clin Oncol. 1988 Sep;6(9):1491-500.) Median F/U 7.1 years 
***Outcome: 5-year DFS observation 54% vs chemotherapy 75% (SS); 5-year OS 60% vs 83% (NS) 
***Toxicity: Significant doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy 
***Conclusion: Adjuvant chemotherapy improves DFS, but overall survival advantage has diminished. Reduced chemo regimen was found to be comparable</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== First Example is Confusing Me ==


Can someone explain the first example in more detail. A few of the lines really confuse me:

1) following _start, in the second mov instruction... I understand that value == 6 because eax was set to 6 previously, but I don't see how in the fifth mov instruction that ebx can equal 2, since value was set to 6 in the second line.
2) And could someone explain what is going on here in the last instruction of _start:
   movw   value(, %ebx, 1), %bx
Am I missing something from the previous sections in this book?

:Regarding your first question, I'm guessing that the author forgot he'd reset **value** to 6, after initially setting it to 2 in the data section. That's my best guess, anyway.

:For number 2, I haven't a bloody clue. [[Special:Contributions/74.131.20.28|74.131.20.28]] ([[User talk:74.131.20.28|talk]]) 02:48, 17 June 2008 (UTC)

== Last example ==

In the last example, it says &quot;due to endianess, the resulting mystr2 would be aAbBcC\0a&quot;. This seems wrong because the endianess should be the same during read AND write. Just to confirm, I tried to compile this with nasm :
  section .code
  global _start
  _start:
  ; copy mystr into mystr2
  mov esi, mystr
  mov edi, mystr2
  cld
  mov ecx, 4
  rep movsw
  
  mov edx,8
  mov ecx,mystr2
  mov ebx,1
  mov eax,4
  int 0x80
  
  mov ebx, 0
  mov eax, 1
  int 0x80
  
  section .bss
  mystr2: resb 8
  
  section .data
  mystr db &quot;AaBbCca&quot;, 0x0
And in fact, it prints AaBbCca. Am I right or is it because of my architecture (amd64) or something like that ?

== Description of movs/movsx ==

Is the description of instructions movs/movsx correct?

In any case the sentence should be fixed (but I don't know what it should be).

== Can movz extend in-place? ==

Is it possible to zero extend, say, `AX` to `EAX` by doing `movz %ax, %eax` (in AT&amp;T syntax)? [[User:Qwertyus|Qwertyus]] ([[User talk:Qwertyus|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Qwertyus|contribs]]) 15:12, 23 October 2013 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==

Stimulated by  [http://blogs.sun.com/bblfish/entry/sparqling_calling_codes  Henry Story's blog entry], the following script works on the same problem.  This script uses the functions defined in previous module to execute a SPARQL query on the dbpedia server, and to convert SPARQL Query results to tuples.

== First attempt ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
import module namespace fr=&quot;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/wiki/fr&quot;   at  &quot;fr.xqm&quot;;

declare variable $query := &quot;
PREFIX : &lt;http://dbpedia.org/resource/&gt;
PREFIX p: &lt;http://dbpedia.org/property/&gt; 
PREFIX rdfs: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#&gt; 
SELECT * WHERE { 
     ?resource  p:callingCode ?callingCode.
     }
 &quot;;

 declare option exist:serialize &quot;method=xhtml media-type=text/html&quot;;

 &lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Country Calling codes&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;Country Calling codes&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
   {  for $country in  fr:sparql-to-tuples(fr:execute-sparql($query))
      let $name := fr:clean($country/resource)
      order by $name
      return      
        &lt;tr&gt;
           &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;{$country/resource}&quot;&gt;{$name}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
           &lt;td&gt;{$country/callingCode}&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
   }
   &lt;/table&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;
 &lt;/html&gt;

&lt;/source&gt;

[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/RDF/countryCodes.xq Run]


In this script the resource uri is parsed to get the local name part of the resource URI in the fr:clean() function. 


The more sound alternative is to filter the multilingual rdfs:label property:

  SELECT * WHERE { 
     ?resource  p:callingCode ?callingCode.
      ?resource rdfs:label ?name.
      FILTER (lang(?name) = 'en')
     }

[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/RDF/countryCodes2.xq Run]

but this query is naturally much slower.

== Discussion ==

This query returns a set of dbpedia resources which have a callingCode property.  However, it includes resources which are not  countries and it proves quite difficult to identify which resources ''are'' countries. It might be expected that either the skos:subject or rdfs:type predicates would identify countries, but this is not the case.

Of course, what entities are classified as countries is a debatable issue, as is currently illustrated by Kosova and by the documentation on ISO 3166.  Perhaps countries are better identified by properties. There is a property countryCode which looks promising:

The SPARQL query becomes:

 PREFIX : &lt;http://dbpedia.org/resource/&gt;
 PREFIX p: &lt;http://dbpedia.org/property/&gt; 
 PREFIX rdfs: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#&gt; 
 SELECT * WHERE { 
     ?resource p:callingCode ?callingCode.
     ?resource p:countryCode ?countryCode.
     }

[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/RDF/countryCodes1.xq Run]


However this shows that many countries have incomplete data in dbpedia, or that the coding of this property is inconsistent.  This is not surprising  because there are a number of types of country codes, which result in different definitions of '''country''':

* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-3 ISO 3166-1 alpha-3]
* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2 ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]
* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_numeric ISO 3166-1 numeric]
* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_IOC_country_codes IOC country codes]
* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_international_license_plate_codes License plate numbers]
* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_code_top-level_domain Top-level domain codes]

== Wikipedia scraping ==

In fact, International Calling codes are listed in a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_calling_code wikipedia entry ]
Thus a more direct approach would be to generate the table by scraping wikipedia directly. However, now we err in the opposite direction, in that there are calling codes for telecom services as well as countries, and the format of numbers and names is inconsistent - some multiple numbers, some numbers with leading + , some countries with appended synonyms etc.


In this script, the path expression finds the anchor &quot;Alphabetical_Listing&quot; and then finds the following table.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare namespace h= &quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot; ;

let $url := &quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_calling_codes&quot;
let $wikipage := doc($url)
let $section := $wikipage//h:table[@class=&quot;wikitable sortable&quot;][2]
return 
    $section

&lt;/source&gt;

Jan 2010 - the page layout had changed so that the previous path to this table : 

 let $section := $wikipage//h:a[@name=&quot;Alphabetical_Listing&quot;]/../following-sibling::h:table[1]

to the current :
 let $section := $wikipage//h:table[@class=&quot;wikitable sortable&quot;][2]
[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/Scrape/wikicallingcodes.xq Wikipedia]

== Export as RDF ==

An alternative is to export this table as RDF.  Here the resource is the dbpedia resource and the property is defined in the dbpedia property namespace. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare namespace h= &quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot; ;
declare namespace rdf = &quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&quot;;
declare namespace p = &quot;http://dbpedia.org/property/&quot;;

let $url := &quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_calling_codes&quot;
let $wikipage := doc($url)
let $section := $wikipage//h:table[@class=&quot;wikitable sortable&quot;][2]
return 
  &lt;rdf:RDF xmlns:p = &quot;http://dbpedia.org/property/&quot;&gt;
    {for $row in $section/h:tr[h:td]
     let $country := string($row/h:td[1])
     let $code := string($row/h:td[2]/h:a[1])
     let $code := replace($code,&quot;\*&quot;,&quot;&quot;)
     let $resource := concat(&quot;http://dbpedia.org/resource/&quot;, replace($country,&quot; &quot;,&quot;_&quot;))
     return 
      &lt;rdf:Description rdf:about=&quot;{$resource}&quot;&gt;
         &lt;p:internationalcallingCode&gt;{$code}&lt;/p:internationalcallingCode&gt;
     &lt;/rdf:Description&gt;
    }
  &lt;/rdf:RDF&gt;

Similarly the structure of this table changed so this code needed to be updated.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A base map is a drawing that captures everything that is in place already on a property or space. It includes buildings, fences, trees, hedges, pathways and driveways, power lines and pipes... things that are in place. 

A sector analysis map is a drawing that depicts what is happening in that base. What is the sun's path, what are the wind and rain directions, where are the main areas of people activity, where are the shade areas.

Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]], a collection of open-content textbooks!

You should consider [[Special:Userlogin|creating an account or logging in]]. Here are some advantages:

* The use of a username of your choice.
* Greater security and privacy, as your IP address will be hidden from most users.
* You get your own personal user page and talk page, instead of having to share it.
* [[Special:Contributions/{{PAGENAME}}|Your contributions]] will be recognized as your own, and not confused with anyone else's.
* The use of your own watchlist which shows when pages you are interested in have been edited.
* Your opinions carry greater weight in the [[Wikibooks:Decision making|decision making process]].
* You become a recognized member of the Wikibooks community.
* Creating an account is easy and only takes a few minutes of your time, especially given the benefits.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikibookian and [[Special:Userlogin|create an account]].&lt;br/&gt;
Feel free to ask any questions on my talk page or in the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading room]].&lt;br/&gt;
Be sure to sign your posts and comments on talk pages with four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;),
this will let other editors know you said it.&lt;br/&gt;

| &lt;!-- this is so if anyone tries to use it where it doesn't go they will know. --&gt;

== Book trailers ==

What an interesting way to get people interested in reading! Book trailers are like movie trailers, but for books! You can find them all over the internet now, but here is a site that's featuring them on YouTube. http://www.youtube.com/booktrailers</text>

 | This VfD is closed as {{keep}}, as there is no consensus to delete. I voted to Delete, but there are more weighty comments to Keep and Restructure. I suggest that on this one. Thanks, [[User:Laleena|Laleena]] ([[User talk:Laleena|talk]]) 13:37, 16 February 2008 (UTC)

A lone paged book written very poorly, hardly in standard WB format, and giving only small detail as to what Tennis actually is. A pity, but this is just not a book. - &lt;strong&gt;[[User:Anonymous Dissident|&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Script MT Bold;color:Silver&quot;&gt;Anonymous Dissident&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/strong&gt;[[User_talk:Anonymous Dissident|&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Verdana;color:Gray&quot;&gt;Talk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;]] 13:04, 4 February 2008 (UTC)

*{{del}} - It just isn't the quality we want. For example, I don't see anything about strategy. Thoughts? [[User:Laleena|Laleena]] ([[User talk:Laleena|talk]]) 13:13, 4 February 2008 (UTC)
*{{comment}} - I'm not going to vote for now as I'm not feeling so sure on my footing on what we want to keep or delete at the moment, but I think this is a stub and policy says we don't delete stubs.  I'm sure somebody else will correct me if I am mistaken. --[[User:AdRiley|AdRiley]] ([[User talk:AdRiley|talk]]) 13:37, 4 February 2008 (UTC)
**Policy does say that, but it also says that its different when a stub is in very poor quality/doesnot even have a proper definition. I think we should be considering a) that wikibooks is wiki''books'' and b) that this is not at all booklike. Being booklike is also cited in relevent policies, of that I'm sure. - &lt;strong&gt;[[User:Anonymous Dissident|&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Script MT Bold;color:Silver&quot;&gt;Anonymous Dissident&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/strong&gt;[[User_talk:Anonymous Dissident|&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Verdana;color:Gray&quot;&gt;Talk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;]] 13:53, 4 February 2008 (UTC)
** Yeah, the book is in a bad shape. But then had been said before, the book is a stub and could be expanded, restructured and kept. I don't find anything inappropriate with the subject of the book.-[[User:Ravichandar84|Ravichandar84]] ([[User talk:Ravichandar84|talk]]) 03:52, 13 February 2008 (UTC)
*[[Image:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''Keep and restructure''' - this is currently an [[WB:NOTWP|encyclopedic article]] (and a bad one) but is potentially a start on the topic. Creating a TOC and moving content to the appropriate subpage would turn this into a book stub, which should then be kept. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:52, 4 February 2008 (UTC)
**Hmmm. Well, I wasn't expecting that this be kept deleted, its just that this page has nothing slvageable. I honestly think it would be easier to start from scratch than much around doing that. - &lt;strong&gt;[[User:Anonymous Dissident|&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Script MT Bold;color:Silver&quot;&gt;Anonymous Dissident&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/strong&gt;[[User_talk:Anonymous Dissident|&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Verdana;color:Gray&quot;&gt;Talk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;]] 20:28, 4 February 2008 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' - This is one that I am in favor of keeping more for the fact that this is a book stub.  I certainly don't see what the topical problem of this book may be, and it certainly is a general interest book that could get some outside support at fixing up in the future.  There is [[w:Wikipedia:WikiProject Tennis]] that may have some &quot;fans&quot; of this sport that may want to come in and help flesh this book out more or try to &quot;rescue&quot; the content.  I did leave a note on the Wikiproject talk page to request an interested fan of the sport to try and help out here on Wikibooks.  My question here is if this is kept, can the existing outline at least be of some use to a new contributor trying to add to the development of this book?  I think that may be useful, and the information on the subpages isn't necessarily wrong on a factual basis.  It is just so light in real information that nearly any contribution could make a substantial improvement.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] ([[User talk:Robert Horning|talk]]) 16:17, 7 February 2008 (UTC)
*{{keep}} - I'm with Rob on this one. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 17:03, 7 February 2008 (UTC)
*{{keep}} --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 17:27, 7 February 2008 (UTC)
*{{keep}} - just to prove I do vote this way sometimes :).  Yes it needs work but I think this is a valid one and should remain --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 12:02, 8 February 2008 (UTC)
*{{keep}} - The book might be wanting in quality but this does not warrant deletion. The book does not violate any rule of Wikibooks. -[[User:Ravichandar84|Ravichandar84]] ([[User talk:Ravichandar84|talk]]) 03:39, 13 February 2008 (UTC)

The author has nominated this book for speedy deletion, with this message:
:''I am the original author with no other contributors (except for 1 vandal ;-)). I don't intend to finish this book as the material is not really useful. This book has not been put on any bookshelves either.''
I think this might be worth keeping, because it is a good start that somebody else might want to continue from. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 07:03, 13 February 2008 (UTC)

:[[Image:Symbol comment vote.svg|15px]] '''{{{2|Comment}}}''' - I would love to keep this, as I noted on the author's talk page. But it ''does'' technically meet the speedy deletion criteria. On the other hand, there's nothing which forces any of us to actually delete it ;) and we would really be better off keeping it, so consider this a [[Image:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''{{{2|Keep}}}''' unless the author is highly unhappy about that.

:'''Comment''' - This is an historically significant page, as it does go into at least some of the early attempts to try and figure out what Wikibooks was all about.  I don't know why this was moved to the Help: namespace, as it really wasn't something meant as an explaination but something more akin to the [[Wikibooks:Reading Room|Staff Lounge]] where some discussion about [[w:grok|groking]] Wikibooks came from.  And I'll admit, even after participating on Wikibooks for some time, I still have a harder time trying to see what Wikibooks really is.  It is perhaps harder to imagine now, but when this project was first created, there really wasn't a clear idea as to what it was that we were even going to do with this wiki, and there was a huge amount of experimentation to try all sorts of crazy things.  This is one of those pages from that era, and should be preserved in some sort of historical record even if the links to it are culled and only referenced in a section of historical pages.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] ([[User talk:Robert Horning|talk]]) 19:57, 28 January 2008 (UTC)
*{{vd}} - per the concerns cited by Mike. Also, the page is very likely very incomplete, and the format is appalling to the degree that it can hardly be read. Also, who is drawing to the conclusion as to what &quot;common&quot; objections are? --- &lt;strong&gt;[[User:Anonymous Dissident|&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Script MT Bold;color:Silver&quot;&gt;Anonymous Dissident&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/strong&gt;[[User_talk:Anonymous Dissident|&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Verdana;color:Gray&quot;&gt;Talk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;]] 02:11, 29 January 2008 (UTC)
**I'd be happy for the '''merge-move''' too, that sounds like a fine idea. --- &lt;strong&gt;[[User:Anonymous Dissident|&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Script MT Bold;color:Silver&quot;&gt;Anonymous Dissident&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/strong&gt;[[User_talk:Anonymous Dissident|&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Verdana;color:Gray&quot;&gt;Talk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;]] 22:12, 1 February 2008 (UTC)
*{{Vd}} I'm convinced, for my small part, that the majority of the Help: namespace needs to be summarily deleted. Our strength as Wikibookians lies in our books, and book-formatted help resources such as [[Using Wikibooks]], [[Editing Wikitext]], and [[Wikibooks Community]] These books, though young and in need of help, are really the route that we should be pursuing for documentation. In a similar vein of thought, if this page is of historical importance it should be distilled and merged into [[History of Wikibooks]], not left in a condition where it is not used, not properly linked, not updated, and not ever appreciated for the possible benefits to posterity that this insight to the early workings of our project holds. The page ''as it is'' needs to be removed, but i would like to see it play a part in improving the [[History of Wikibooks]] book. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 03:33, 29 January 2008 (UTC)
*:There are several of this historically significant pages but aren't really effective at introducing Wikibooks to new users any more.  Some of which you've named here, and a couple that have been deleted in the past couple of months.  As a temporary location (or perhaps &quot;permanent&quot;... as much as that is with Wikibooks), should these be moved to [[Wikibooks:Historical]] and sub-pages... with a note that these pages no longer reflect current Wikibooks practices and policies, but these are being preserved for documenting the early history of Wikibooks?  I would have to agree that in its current condition they don't belong as a main-stream help page, and new users not knowing the historical context would get lost at trying to understand what is written on this and similar pages.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] ([[User talk:Robert Horning|talk]]) 16:52, 29 January 2008 (UTC)
*::I'm fine with a page such as [[Wikibooks:Historical]], although I still posit that the best use for this kind of material is in [[History of Wikibooks]], and not just in some archive somewhere, where it will never be read and won't serve any benefit. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 19:33, 29 January 2008 (UTC)
*[[Image:Symbol merge vote.svg|15px]] '''{{{2|Merge}}}'''/[[Image:Symbol move vote.svg|15px]] '''{{{2|Move}}}''' - Something like [[Wikibooks:Historical]] would be fine, but I think merging with [[History of Wikibooks]] would be better. I'd love to see a comprehensive history of Wikibooks written. What's there is certainly interesting, but is really just a list of links. At the absolute minimum, the page needs to be rewritten in a readable way. It's really a mess. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:57, 29 January 2008 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;big&gt;&lt;u&gt;'''The Influences that Impact the “High Expectations for All Students” in the American Education System '''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/big&gt; 

&lt;big&gt;'''Fiona Crawshaw'''&lt;/big&gt; 

== Introduction ==

What is the five year old child thinking when they first enter the classroom, are they excited, nervous, fearful, resentful, do they want to be there or do they just not care? Prior to school they were largely influenced by parents and their cultural background. This may range from privileged, where the family has a strong sense of the importance of the child and whose values reflect values of society, to the disadvantaged, where children are negatively impacted by the family culture. Whatever the family life, the philosophy of the school system is to educate everyone to the same high standard with the same high expectations for all. The dilemma is how can these expectations exist for all students and how can they be met when the student body consists of children with such varying backgrounds and where the education in America is impacted by laws, teachers and society?
 

== No Child Left Behind and Title I ==
 
The federal government recognized failures in the public school system and introduced rules, regulations and expectations for all schools to improve in performance. The Title I act was introduced to give financial assistance to schools in order to counteract the negative affects of poverty and boost learning in schools. In addition the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) was implemented in 2002, “To close the achievement gap with accountability, flexibility, and choice so that no child is left behind” (National Assessment of Title I Final Report Summary of Key Findings, 2007). Key provisions of NCLB include requiring schools to have a general plan for the education of the student body and specific individual plans for any student identified as having special needs. Schools have to assess all students including major racial/ethnic groups, low income students, students with disabilities, and students with limited English proficiency. If the schools do not make adequate yearly progress NCLB provides directives that should promote achievement in a struggling school. One key aspect is that the school district has to provide schooling elsewhere if parents request it on the basis of an underachieving school. NCLB targets inadequacies in teachers by requiring them to be highly qualified with subject matter competence, a bachelor’s degree and full state certification. (National Assessment of Title I Final Report Summary of Key Findings, 2007)

== What difference can the Teacher make? ==

More than the school facilities, or money spent on each child, the teacher’s ability to teach and their attitude has a bigger impact on high expectations for all students. “Anyone without an unshakeable belief in children’s capacity to learn has no business in the classroom” Margaret Gayle, gifted education expert at Duke University said in an interview with Time Magazine (Wallis, 2008). Within the classroom the teacher is restricted to content (determined by syllabus) and tools used, (determined by school administration) but their attitude and teaching strategies are their own. One such strategy evaluated in a recent study is cooperative learning, “grouping students from different cultural backgrounds into heterogeneous groups and instructing them to collaborate and cooperate with each other on activities and problem solving tasks” (Allison, Rehm, 2007). In this study the teachers rated cooperative learning as being highly effective and that in addition to the students gaining the testable knowledge necessary to succeed, the approach was also shown to, “foster, cross cultural understanding” (Allison, Rehm, 2007). Family culture is a major influence in both a child’s and a teacher’s attitude in the classroom. Teachers often do not have an understanding of the background of students causing a clash of cultures known as “theory of social discontinuity” (Sanacore, 2000). To avoid this clash there is much focus on teachers attending workshops to gain a better understanding and the practice of reflection to see if a plan is working. This awareness has led to more in service teacher education with regard to multicultural classrooms, and a greater appreciation for the diversity of society and its impact on learning.

== Society shaping the school. ==
 
Society is dynamic; with many cultures, gender issues, socio economic gaps, and the changing expectations of its people. These changes drive the educational establishment to constantly assess their performance in order to provide a better education for all. For one example, the women in society who want to have the same opportunity in the workplace as men have changed the “old establishment” expectations of the female gender. The gender gap is closing with more women entering colleges when previously they were not expected to have academic credentials. In 1974 the ratio in the general population of people entering college was 38 percent of men vs 33 percent of women; in 2003 this had changed to 41 percent of men vs 51 percent of women. (Postsecondary Participation Rates by Sex and Race/Ethnicity: 1974-2003. 2005). This change is obviously beneficial for women but indicates that the emphasis in school on equality has gone too far in the other direction, leaving the male gender behind. Another significant characteristic of this report found that in 2003 there is a 15 point gap in White vs Black and a 26 point gap in White vs Hispanic. These results indicate that the schools have improved their expectations for females to achieve but have not performed as well in the racial/ethnic areas, especially with the Hispanic population. The percentage of Hispanic men attending post secondary education actually dropped over the time of the study.

== Summary ==

The Educational Establishments in America are constantly addressing how each child can have an education that ensures they grow to their fullest potential. The thirteen years in school should be filled with learning and adventure rather than disappointment and frustration. Our world at the moment is constantly changing; technology is being invented at a rate that only the wealthy can keep up with, wars, famine and poverty are widespread causing legal and illegal immigration. America is a dynamic nation and the Education of it’s children is influenced and improved by it’s laws and highly qualified teachers that continue to adapt, monitor, and improve the services they provide to all children.

&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:100%; color:#FF0000&quot;&gt;'''Circuit idea:''' ''Connect a reversed and a direct voltage-to-current converter one after another.''&lt;/span&gt;


[[Image:Reverse_function_450.jpg|right|thumb|400px|&lt;center&gt;A current mirror consists of two consecutively connected inverse converters&lt;/center&gt;]]__TOC__


&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

== Background ==

There are many professional publications about the famous current mirror circuit and its versions&lt;ref&gt;[[w:Current mirror|Current mirror]] is a comprehensive exposition of the topic.&lt;/ref&gt;. Only, as a rule, they look formal, specialized and &quot;sterile&quot;. These sources give a lot of details about current mirror versions but they do not show the basic ideas behind them.

'''Our mission.''' We, circuit ideators, have a different &quot;mission&quot; in Wikibooks - ''to reveal the philosophy behind circuits''. We know that before showing in detail how to calculate an electronic circuit ''we have first to show what the very basic idea is behind this circuit''. In [[Circuit Idea]], we try to do that relying only on our human intuition, imagination and common sense.

[[Image:Simple bipolar mirror.svg|thumbnail|200px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 1 What does the transistor Q1 do in this odd circuit?&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''The simple but complex current mirror.''' At first sight, the current mirror looks a simple bare circuit (Fig. 1); but actually, it is an odd, strange and exotic circuit that is never explained (there are only some guessworks). It is a great paradox that everyone knows what a current mirror is but nobody knows how it operates.

As a rule, the classical current mirror explanations begin with the assertion that the ''current-setting transistor'' Q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; acts as a diode. But it is very primitive and confusing to say &quot;the input transistor Q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;is a diode&quot;. Actually, it is not a diode; it is exactly a transistor operating in the active mode. It would be a diode, if its collector was disconnected. Then all the current I&lt;sub&gt;REF&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;CC&lt;/sub&gt;/R (R is omitted on the picture) would flow through the base-emitter junction acting really as a diode. But here the output ''collector-emitter'' part of the transistor is connected in parallel to the base-emitter &quot;diode&quot;. In this way, it serves as a shunting regulating element that diverts the great amount (β/(1 + β)) of the current. But how and why the transistor does this magic?

There is something strange and confusing in this arrangement... As everybody knows, the base-emitter voltage V&lt;sub&gt;BE&lt;/sub&gt; is the input quantity of the bipolar transistor and the collector current I&lt;sub&gt;REF&lt;/sub&gt; is the output quantity. But here all is on the contrary - the collector current is the input and the base-emitter voltage is an output!?!? What an idiocy?

'''Questions to be answered.''' In order to understand this odd circuit, we need to answer dozens of questions that are never answered. Here are some of them.

''What does the transistor Q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; do in this circuit? What is its function there? What is the difference between it and a diode? Can we replace it by a bare diode or a base-emitter junction (leaving the collector disconnected) as it is shown in another current mirror story &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allaboutcircuits.com/vol_3/chpt_4/12.html Current mirrors] is a popular exposition of the current mirror topic written by the well-known web author Tony Kuphaldt.&lt;/ref&gt;? Why and how the collector current I&lt;sub&gt;REF&lt;/sub&gt; serves as an input quantity and the base-emitter voltage as an output one (we thought the base-emitter voltage V&lt;sub&gt;BE&lt;/sub&gt; was the input quantity of the bipolar transistor and the collector current I&lt;sub&gt;REF&lt;/sub&gt; was the output quantity)? What does the transistor Q&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; do in this circuit? What is its function there? How do collector voltages vary when we change the input current I&lt;sub&gt;REF&lt;/sub&gt; (the input voltage V&lt;sub&gt;REF&lt;/sub&gt; , the &quot;programming&quot; resistor R&lt;sub&gt;REF&lt;/sub&gt; and the load resistance R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; )?''

Since there are no satisfactory answers to these questions, let's forget temporarily all kinds &quot;cut-and-dried&quot; citations and to try disclosing the mystery of the famous circuit by ourselves. Just forget them and begin thinking by yourself!

== The general idea behind the whole circuit ==

It seems our story will be not based on  &quot;verifiable sources&quot; just because there are not such sources; so, one can say it is an original research. Only, we will endeavor to explain the famous circuit so simply, clearly and evidently that there is not any need to verify these assertions. By the way, the very [[Wikipedia:No original research|NOR]] stipulates such a possibility - to use sources, &quot;the accuracy of which is easily verifiable by any reasonable adult without specialist knowledge&quot;. 

=== The problem: ''current direction inverter'' ===

[[Image:General_idea_1000.jpg|right|thumb|320px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 2. A current mirror is a 3-terminal device&lt;/center&gt;]]

In circuitry, especially in the area of microelectronics (e.g., inside op-amps), sometimes we need to invert the direction of a current (to make the ''flowing in'' current a ''flowing out'' one and v.v. - the ''flowing out'' current a ''flowing in'' one) without changing its magnitude. In this way, the output current just follows, &quot;copies&quot; the input one but this copy is inverted, &quot;mirror&quot; one. In other words, the input current &quot;programs&quot; the output one and the whole circuit serves as a programmed current source (''current-controlled'' or ''dependent'' current source).

Obviously, in order to do that, such a ''current direction inverter'' (having a more popular name - ''current mirror'') has to be at least a 3-terminal device (Fig. 2). The reason of that is  because the two entering currents have to &quot;go out&quot; from somewhere (Fig. 2a) and v.v., the two exiting currents have to &quot;go in&quot; somewhere (Fig. 2b). In this arrangement, the one lead serves as an input, the other - as an output and the third - as a common terminal (usually connected to the positive or negative rail and more rarely - to the ground).

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== How to create a current mirror ===

'''Basic structure.''' In electronics, we have two kinds of circuits producing or, more frequently, just controlling current - ''current sources'' and ''current sinks''. The difference between them is that, regarding to some circuit point, sources &quot;inject&quot; current while sinks &quot;absorb&quot; current. Obviously, in order to implement the general arrangement above (Fig. 2) into a concrete current mirror, we need both the circuits.  As a rule, these circuits are voltage-controlled; so, in order to control them by current, we need to connect ''current-to-voltage converters'' before them. Let's now draw the block diagram of the two possible current mirror arrangements.

[[Image:Current_mirror_sink_1000.jpg|left|thumb|320px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 3a. A current mirror sinking the output current&lt;/center&gt;]][[Image:Current_mirror_source_1000.jpg|right|thumb|320px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 3b. A current mirror sourcing the output current&lt;/center&gt;]]

If we have a current source, we convert the input current (&quot;entering&quot; the current mirror) into a voltage and then use this voltage to control a current sink; as a result, we obtain a current sink (Fig. 3a). Conversely, if we have a current sink, we convert the input current (&quot;exiting&quot; the current mirror) into a voltage and then use this voltage to control a current source (Fig. 3b); as a result, now we obtain a current source. We can already generalize this basic current mirror structure in a conclusion:

&lt;center&gt;''A current mirror consists of two consecutively connected '''current-to-voltage''' and '''voltage-to-current''' converters''.&lt;/center&gt;


[[Image:Reverse_function_450.jpg|right|thumb|320px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 4. The current mirror consists of two consecutively connected inverse converters&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''Characteristics.''' It is interesting that the two converters may be linear (then I&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; = V/R = I&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;.R/R = I&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;) but it is not obligatory. They might be non-linear devices having whatever transfer or IV characteristics that may even depend on other quantity (e.g., temperature); ''the only requirement is their characteristics to be reverse''. In this way, if the one converter implements a function y = f(x) and the other represents the reverse function x = f&lt;sup&gt; -1&lt;/sup&gt;(y) the whole function is y = f(x) = f(f&lt;sup&gt; -1&lt;/sup&gt;(y)) . Note that the two converters might be connected in any order, including the direct after the inversed one (Fig. 4). At first sight, this result looks strange and nonsensical but in this way the main problem - reversing the current direction, is solved. So, we can formulate the next conclusion:

&lt;center&gt;''A current mirror consists of two consecutively connected converters having reverse characteristics.&lt;/center&gt;

'''Simple reversing.''' Usually, there is not a couple of direct and reverse converter and we have only one kind of converter. If this is a reversible converter, we can use it as a direct converter and then connect another such converter in an opposite direction to get a reverse converter.

'''Reversing by negative feedback.''' The problem is when the converter is not reversible and it is a bare ''one-way device''. In this case, we cannot swap the circuit input and output ports; we cannot apply an input quantity to the circuit output and to get an output quantity from the circuit input (unfortunately, this is our case). Then, the only way to &quot;reverse&quot; the circuit is applying the ubiquitous ''negative feedback''. Only ''systems with negative feedback have the unique property to reverse the cause and effect relations between the input and output quantities of the objects''. They adjust their internal input quantity so that their internal output quantity to become equal to the &quot;true&quot; external input quantity. As a result, the internal input quantity follows, depends on the external input quantity; actually, the internal input quantity serves as an external output quantity. In this way, they can &quot;reverse&quot; the objects.

== Implementing the general idea into a BJT electronic circuit ==

Once revealed the general idea we can create as many as we want current mirror circuits (this is the power of this heuristic approach). In all these versions, only the electronic components (BJT, FET, op-amps, etc.) will be different; the general idea behind them will be the same. Well, let's begin with the most popular of them - the basic BJT current mirror.

=== An output part ===

We can drive a bipolar transistor by voltage or by current. If we change the base-emitter  voltage as an input and use the collector current as an output (Fig. 5), we can think of a BJ transistor as a ''non-linear voltage-to-current converter having an exponential characteristic''. So, we can use it directly as an output part of our simple BJT current mirror: 

&lt;center&gt;''The output part of the simple BJT current mirror is just a bipolar transistor acting as an exponential voltage-to-current converter.''&lt;/center&gt;


[[Image:Bjt_current_mirror_out_1000.jpg|left|thumb|200px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 5. Implementing the output part of a BJT current mirror&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Image:Bjt_current_mirror_out_iv_450.jpg|right|thumb|320px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 6. Superimposed IV curves of the output part&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''Operation.''' How does the transistor T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; behave in this arrangement? In order to know, let's carry out an experiment - set a constant input voltage V&lt;sub&gt;REF&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.5 ÷ 0.7V and then vary the load resistance R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; (with the same success, you can vary the supply voltage V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or even both the resistance R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; and the voltage V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). The result is surprising - the transistor changes its present resistance R&lt;sub&gt;T2&lt;/sub&gt; between the collector and the emitter so that to keep up a constant total resistance R&lt;sub&gt;tot&lt;/sub&gt; = R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; + R&lt;sub&gt;T2&lt;/sub&gt; = const (Fig. 6). As a result, the output current remains constant I&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/R&lt;sub&gt;tot&lt;/sub&gt;. In this way, the output ''collector-emitter'' part of the transistor T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; acts as a ''current-stable non-linear resistor''. They usually say the transistor T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; acts as a simple [http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/circuit_stories/understanding_circuits/current_source/simple_bjt_current_source/simple_bjt_current_source.htm current sink].

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== An input part ===

Now, we need to make the BJ transistor serve as the needed opposite current-to-voltage converter. Only, we cannot &quot;reverse&quot; it directly since the transistor is a ''one-way device'', whose base-emitter junction can control the collector current; the opposite is just impossible. What do we do then?

We have already known the remedy - its name is ''negative feedback''. In our case that means to make the transistor adjust its base-emitter voltage &quot;V&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt;&quot; so that the collector current to be I&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/R. For this purpose, we have just to connect its collector to its base, in order to apply a &quot;100% parallel negative feedback&quot; (Fig. 7). As a result, although it seems strange, in this &quot;reversed&quot; transistor the collector current serves as an input quantity while the base-emitter voltage serves as an output quantity!

&lt;center&gt;''The input part of the simple BJT current mirror is just a bipolar transistor with 100% parallel negative feedback.''&lt;/center&gt;

==== Operation ====

But how does the transistor T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; behave in this arrangement? In order to know, let's carry out another experiment - set a constant input (supply) voltage V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and then vary the input current-setting resistance R (again, with the same success, you can vary the input voltage V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; or even both the resistance R and the voltage V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;). 

[[Image:Bjt_current_mirror_in_1000.jpg|left|thumb|200px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 7. Implementing the input part of a BJT current mirror&lt;/center&gt;]][[Image:Bjt_current_mirror_in_iv_450.jpg|right|thumb|320px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 8. Superimposed IV curves of the input part&lt;/center&gt;]]
 
The result is still more surprising than [[#An output part|before]] - now, the transistor changes its present resistance R&lt;sub&gt;T1&lt;/sub&gt; between its collector and emitter so that to keep up an almost constant resistance ratio K = R&lt;sub&gt;T1&lt;/sub&gt;/(R&lt;sub&gt;T1&lt;/sub&gt; + R) = const. As a result, the output voltage remains almost constant V&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;CE1&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;BE&lt;/sub&gt; = const (Fig. 8). In this way, the output ''collector-emitter'' part of the transistor T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; acts as a ''voltage-stable non-linear resistor''. But this is the recipe of making various ''active diodes'' (&quot;ordinary&quot;, [[w:Voltage source#VBE multiplier voltage source|&quot;zener&quot;]] or &quot;rubber&quot;, adjustable...)! It is just a wonder! The parallel negative feedback has made a current-stable resistor (the output part of T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) behave as a voltage-stable one! This is the same transistor but in the first case it serves as a current-stable element while in the second case it serves as a voltage-stable element.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

==== A &quot;reversed&quot; transistor ====

At the same time, the input voltage source V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and the current-setting resistor R form a composed current-source that &quot;want&quot; to produce a current I&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/R through a voltage-stable element (the transistor T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;). By the way, some mystic cascode circuits are based on the same arrangement (a current source supplies a voltage-stable element and v.v.). It is interesting that, in this situation, the voltage-stable element changes its present resistance, in order to &quot;help&quot; the current source to establish the desired current. For example, if we decrease the resistance R to increase the current, the transistor T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; will also decrease its present resistance thus helping us to increase the current and v.v. Doing that, the transistor T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; adjusts its base-emitter voltage so that the collector current to be always I&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/R. As a result, although it seems strange, the collector current serves as an input quantity while the base-emitter voltage serves as an output quantity! The negative feedback has reversed the one-way transistor!

==== An equilibrium point ====

[[Image:Equilibrium_1000.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 9. Discovering the equilibrium point of the current-setting transistor&lt;/center&gt;]]

It is interesting to discover how the transistor T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; manages to reach the equilibrium point (a system with negative feedback always reaches the equilibrium). For this purpose, let's change firstly the magnitude of the input voltage V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; or the resistance R. The transistor responses to this &quot;intervention&quot; by changing its present resistance R&lt;sub&gt;T1&lt;/sub&gt;... but till when? In order to understand, let's carry out an interesting experiment - break the feedback loop and drive the &quot;true&quot; base-emitter transistor input by a separate voltage source &quot;V&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt;&quot; (Fig. 9). Then, let's begin increasing/decreasing  the &quot;true&quot; transistor's input voltage &quot;V&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt;&quot;; in return, the transistor will begin dropping/raising its collector voltage V&lt;sub&gt;C1&lt;/sub&gt; by decreasing/increasing its present resistance R&lt;sub&gt;T1&lt;/sub&gt;. Figuratively speaking, the two voltages &quot;move&quot; against each other. In order to imitate the negative feedback behavior, we have to stop changing &quot;V&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt;&quot; when the two voltages become equal (a zero indicator connected between the collector and the base can show this moment); this is the equilibrium point. Now, if we short the zero indicator (connect the collector to the base or, as they say, ''close the feedback loop''), the system will remain at rest as it is at the point of the equilibrium.

==== Another example: ''a transdiode'' ====

By the way, there is another paradoxical circuit that does the same but it is an almost perfect - the logarithmic converter based on the so called ''transdiode'' (a BJT transistor connected in the op-amp feedback loop&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maxim-ic.com/appnotes.cfm/an_pk/3611 Integrated DC Logarithmic Amplifiers]&lt;/ref&gt;). As here, in this odd and also never explained circuit configuration, the collector current serves as an input quantity while the base-emitter voltage - as an output quantity?!? The only difference is that there an additional op-amp adjusts the transistor's base-emitter voltage so that its collector current to be exactly equal to the input one. The op-amp does this magic by observing the [[w:Virtual ground|virtual ground]] point and keeping it (almost) equal to zero.

=== Assembling the whole circuit ===

Finally, we have only to connect the output of the input part (the base-emitter junction of T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) to the input of the output part (the base-emitter junction of T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) to build the famous BJT current mirror circuit!


[[Image:Bjt_current_mirror_in_1000.jpg|185px|]] &lt;span style=&quot;font-size:300%&quot;&gt;''' + '''&lt;/span&gt; 
[[Image:Bjt_current_mirror_out_1000.jpg|185px|]] &lt;span style=&quot;font-size:300%&quot;&gt;''' = '''&lt;/span&gt; 
[[Image:Bjt_current_mirror_full_1000.jpg|370px|]]

&lt;center&gt;Fig. 10. Assembling the whole BJT current mirror.&lt;/center&gt;


The only problem is that the transistor T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &quot;sucks&quot; another base current I&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; from the input current. As a result, the output current is smaller than the input one:

&lt;center&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; = I&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; - 2I&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; = β.I&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; - 2I&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; = (β - 2).I&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;

== Conclusion ==

What is the use of applying this stiff heuristic approach - step-by-step building instead giving the &quot;cut-and-dry&quot; classical circuit? The benefit is that we can build now various current mirror circuits knowing only one powerful general idea! We know what the transistors T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; do in this circuit; we know the truth about the basic current mirror circuit!

==Nice Job==
Nice job on American History. I have been working on it a little bit too. I would suggest that you disscus before removing entire sections of pages, as you did with the USA-Iran conflict. Consider making an account. ([[User:Red4tribe|Red4tribe]] ([[User talk:Red4tribe|talk]]) 20:11, 20 May 2008 (UTC))

:Hi. It is best to discuss before moving such large amounts of information as you recently did on Hillary's pastor. [[User:Red4tribe|Red4tribe]] ([[User talk:Red4tribe|talk]]) 20:17, 10 June 2008 (UTC)

; New [[Wikibooks:Reading room]]
: The staff lounge has been renamed to the &quot;Reading room&quot; as part of a reorganizational effort. Several pages were renamed to be the &quot;Reading room&quot; instead of the &quot;Staff lounge&quot;. The bulletin board (this page) and the administrators noticeboard have also been moved to be sub pages of the reading room.

==September 2007==
; New {{tlx|New}} Template
: The old {{tlx|New}} template was updated to use DPL instead of a manually updated list. This is used in conjunction with the new {{tlx|New book}} template, which is to be used on all new books.

: The majority of old message templates, such as {{tlx|vfd}} and {{tlx|merge}} have been updated to use a new visual style. The new {{tlx|Mbox}} template contains details about this new formatting.

; Subject namespace
: English Wikibooks has added a new Subject: namespace. Discussion about how to use this new namespace is being held at [[WB:SLT|Staff lounge]], but is likely to move to a dedicated location eventually. A list of all subject pages is currently located at [[Subject:All Subjects]].

; August 15, 2007
: [[:simple:Main Page|Simple English Wikibooks]] reached 100 book pages.

: {{Template:Wikijunior:New Book Description}}

==June 2007==
; Wikibooks logo
: Wikibookians may well wish to see [[m:Wikibooks/logo#A_vote_to_close_color_nominations_and_choose_the_final_logo|this on Meta]] and express their opinions or vote.

==May 2007==
; [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks]]
: A number of small changes to the [[WB:WIW]] policy have been proposed, to reduce redundant information, and rewrite confusing or contradictory passages. These changes are proposed on the associated talk page at:
:
::[[Wikibooks_talk:What_is_Wikibooks#&quot;Wikibooks_includes_books_based_on_Wikipedia_articles&quot;]]
::[[Wikibooks_talk:What_is_Wikibooks#&quot;What_Wikibooks_Includes&quot;]]
::[[Wikibooks_talk:What_is_Wikibooks#&quot;Wikibooks_includes_annotated_texts&quot;]]

; Milestones reached
: The English Wikibooks project [[Special:Statistics|passed]] a number of milestones this month. The project exceeded 75,000 total pages and 25,000 non-[[Help:Stub|stub]] book modules. The number of page views also exceeded 25,000 and the number of registered users will soon exceed 60,000 (currently 59,000). The project [[Wikibooks:Featured books|features]] 48 books meeting high [[Wikibooks:Good books|criteria on book quality]], with several more [[Wikibooks:Featured books/Nominations|expected]] to be added this month.

; May 7th
: The Wikijunior namespace has been created. If you are having trouble finding a Wikijunior book, try looking through the new [[Special:Prefixindex/Wikijunior:|Wikijunior namespace]]. All books should be fully moved in a few days.

; [[Wikibooks:Wikijunior:What_is_Wikijunior|What is Wikijunior]] Referendum
: A proposal for [[Wikibooks:Wikijunior:What_is_Wikijunior|What is Wikijunior]] is up for referendum.
: The discussion is at: [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines/Vote/What is Wikijunior]]
: All wikijunior contributors and wikibookians are encouraged to read the proposal and make their voices heard.

==April 2007==
; [[Wikibooks:Featured books]]
: The [[Wikibooks:Featured books|Featured books]] pages have been created, and are being used to nominate and feature some of our best books. Wikibookians who know about a good book should nominate it at the [[Wikibooks:Featured books/Nominations|nominations page]]. All Wikibookians are encouraged to vote for the nominated books.

; [[Wikibooks:Blocking policy]] Vote
: The new proposal for [[Wikibooks:Blocking policy]] is up for a vote at [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines/Vote/Blocking policy]]. All Wikibookians are encouraged to read the new proposal and vote on it.

;[[Wikibooks:Wikijunior:What_is_Wikijunior|What is Wikijunior]] Discussion and Vote
:A proposal for [[Wikibooks:Wikijunior:What_is_Wikijunior|What is Wikijunior]] is up for discussion and vote at [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines/Vote/What is Wikijunior]] All Wikijunior contributors and Wikibookians are encouraged to read the proposal and contribute to the discussion.

; Bureaucrat Vote
: [[User:SB Johnny]] has been nominated for promotion to bureaucrat. If elected, SB Johnny will be only the fourth active bureaucrat on this project. Bureaucrats, in addition to being administrators, have the ability to promote new administrators and to rename users. All Wikibookians are encouraged to read the nomination and vote. 

; [[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]] Vote
: A new proposal for [[WB:WIW]] is up for a vote. The text of the proposal is at [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks/Unstable]].
: The vote is occurring at [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines/Vote/What is Wikibooks]].
: All Wikibookians are encouraged to read the new proposal and vote on it.

==March 2007==
; New administrators
: We now have three new administrators on the project: [[User:Iamunknown]], [[User:Xixtas]], and [[User:Jomegat]].

; [[Wikibooks:Resolving disputes]]
: An important dispute resolution policy has been discussed in the past and progress has recently stagnated. Please voice your opinions regarding any changes to the policy on its [[Wikibooks talk:Resolving disputes|talk page]] or be bold and make changes to the text directly. This policy is the first step in developing several other policies and needs to be approved before other progress can occur.

; Wikijunior Namespace
: A bugzilla request has been submitted to create a [[Wikijunior]] namespace. All Wikibookians are encouraged to show their support [[Wikibooks:Staff_lounge/Technical_Chat#Wikijunior_Namespace|in a straw poll on staff lounge]]. 

; Cleaned-up Books
: The following books have been cleaned up. 
:* [[Biblical Studies]] - This book has been made into one coherent book. It had a lot of pages needing connection to the book.
:* [[Corset]] - This book was in dire need of a cleanup. It has been cleaned up now.
:* [[Dichotomous Key]] - This book had the obselete colon design. It is now fixed and looks a lot better.
:* [[English/Grammar]] - Same as above. I also fixed up the whole book of [[English]] as well.

; [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge Reorganized]]
: Earlier this month, the [[WB:SL|Staff lounge]] was reorganized. Instead of being one large discussion room, it has been broken into a number of sub-discussion rooms for specific topics. All Wikibookians should update their watchlists to include the additional discussion rooms.

==February 2007==
; Administrator Policies

: All Wikibookians are encouraged to read these proposals and lend their opinions.

; Main page of Wikibooks

Views from Wikibookians will be very welcome.

==January 2007==
; [[Introduction]]
: I have protected this page from editing with hope that this will encourage new editors to pay more attention to our naming policy. Please check periodically whether there are any pages linking to [[Introduction]] and remove such links. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 16:26, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

; [[:Category:Books with PDF version]]
: New category will automatically list all books having PDF version. At the moment the list is outdated.

; Policy Discussions

:*[[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks/Unstable]]

:*[[Wikibooks:Deletion policy/Unstable]]
:*[[Wikibooks:Editorial board]]
:*[[Wikibooks:Arbitration Committee]]

; Oversight Permissions
: Three users have requested or been nominated for oversight permissions at [[Wikibooks:Requests for adminship]]. Please vote and express your opinion as to whether each individual user should or should not be granted oversight permission.
: The oversight votes have been called off, as general community consensus is against granting of this privilege to users without more information about the topic. All oversight requests on this wiki can be sent to the stewards on meta if needed.

; [[Wikibooks:Wikiprojects]]
: A new infrastructure of cooperative wikiprojects is in the works, and all users are encouraged to come participate. Wikiprojects provide a way to coordinate efforts between users who are working towards similar goals. There are only a few wikiprojects started so far, but more can be added. 

; Next Gazette
: The next &quot;issue&quot; of the Wikibooks &quot;Gazette&quot; will be out shortly.  If you want to make sure you receive it please check that your name is on the list of [[Wikibooks:Active wikibookians|active wikibookians]] and if not add it or ask someone to do so.

; New Checkusers
: [[User:Herbythyme]] and [[User:SBJohnny]] have been granted checkuser access by the stewards, after receiving 25 votes. Thanks to all for voting.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Not a diode ==

Article says ''But it is very primitive and confusing to say &quot;the input transistor Q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is a diode&quot;. Actually, it is not a diode; it is exactly a transistor operating in the active mode. It would be a diode, if its collector was disconnected.''
I'd be inclined to notice that the CB junction of the transistor is short-circuited in Q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. The collector node is attached directly to the base node. Therefore the circuit &quot;sees&quot; only the BE junction, which is, of course, a diode. Sounds like a simple explanation to me. [[w:User:Brews ohare|Brews ohare]] ([[w:User talk:Brews ohare|talk]]) 00:37, 2 March 2008 (UTC)

:[[w:User:Brews ohare|Brews ohare]], thank you for the response. It is wonderful that there are still (wiki)people showing willingness for discussing circuit phenomena! As you can see, I not only try to &quot;humanize&quot; Wikipedia articles by means of these discussions; I draw also inspiration from these conversations that I need to continue disclosing the mystery of electronic circuits on the pages of [[Circuit Idea]]. It will be so marvelous, if more key-wikipedians (e.g., [[w:User:Omegatron|Omegatron]], [[w:User:Alfred Centauri|Alfred Centauri]], [[w:User:Light current|Light current]], [[w:User:Heron|Heron]], [[w:User:Rogerbrent|Rogerbrent]], etc.) join this discussion! Of course, we have to be bold and fair enough for the purpose of such a frank discussion; we have not to hide behind &quot;reputable&quot; sources.

:As far as I remember, I have also to reply to [[w:Talk:Current mirror#Past discussion about the philosophy behind the current mirror|your comment]] in Wikipedia's [[w:Current mirror|Current mirror]]. Below, I will try to expose my viewpoint about this interesting topic.

== What can be the current mirror building component? ==

I'm not familiar enough with microelectronics; I try to look at electronic devices from a macro- instead from a micro-level. From this viewpoint, the specific current mirror implementation is not so interesting for me; I try to &quot;catch&quot; the general idea behind it. Following this approach, let's see what an electronic device we can use as a building component to realize the two parts of the current mirror.

If you share my [[Circuit Idea/How to Reverse Current Direction#How to create a current mirror|penetration]], the so called ''transconductance'' (voltage-to-current conversion) is the main, general and inherent property of the device. It is not so important, if the relation between the output current and the input voltage is linear; but it is important for the device to keep up a steady output current when the load varies. Simply speaking, we need a ''voltage-controlled current-stable resistor'' that changes its ''present'' resistance contrary to the input voltage: if we raise the input voltage, the resistance decreases and v.v. This property allows us to build the input ''current-setting'' (''programming'', ''reference'') part of the current mirror by applying a negative feedback. For this purpose, we just connect the device's output to its input, in order to reverse it (to transmute it from a ''voltage-to-current converter'' into the opposite ''current-to-voltage converter'').

Almost all the electronic devices (tubes, bipolar-, MOS and junction field-effect transistors, the so-called [[w:Operational transconductance amplifier|transconductance amplifier]]s, etc.) are [[w:Transconductance#Devices|transconductors]] that control the current flowing through the load (if we want they to produce a voltage, we connect in series a resistor acting as the simplest [[Circuit Idea/Passive Current-to-Voltage Converter|current-to-voltage converter]]). But only two of the &quot;conventional&quot; active electronic components (the bipolar transistor and the E-MOS field-effect transistor) possesses the needed input-output relation.

=== MOSFET as a current mirror building component ===

[[Image:Simple MOSFET mirror.PNG|thumbnail|200px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 1. A MOSFET behaves as a perfect V-to-I converter&lt;/center&gt;]]

It is exactly what we need since a MOSFET has a true voltage input behaving just as an open circuit. As a result, there are no any problems, if we connect the M1's drain to its gate (Fig. 1). There is no additional current to be extracted from the input source (there is no error because of the input currents); there are no any &quot;diodes&quot; connected in parallel to the device's output... There is only a regulating element (a voltage-controlled resistor) that changes its present resistance (between the drain and the source) so that to keep up an almost constant voltage. We have made it behave in this way - as a voltage-stable resistor, as a forward-biased diode! There are no any other elements in this arrangement...

An E-MOSFET has a threshold in its [http://wps.prenhall.com/chet_paynter_introduct_6/6/1664/426188.cw/index.html|transconductance curve] but it affects only the output, not the input (although the threshold voltage is exceeded, the input resistance remains infinite). So, we can think of an E-MOSFET as a kind of &quot;transdiode&quot;.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== BJT as a current mirror building component ===

[[Image:Bjt_current_mirror_in_1000.jpg|right|thumb|200px|&lt;center&gt;Fig.2. Is the transistor T1 a diode?&lt;/center&gt;]]

But BJT is a &quot;nastier&quot; and more confusing device... First, it is a double-faced component; we can think of a bipolar transistor simply as a current-to-current converter (a current amplifier) or, more precisely, as a voltage-to-current converter (according to Ebers-Moll model). Well, we might accept here the second viewpoint... But what do we do with the base-emitter diode? What is its role here? Is it important? Is the transistor T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; with a shorted CB junction a diode? What is it?

Yes, there is a diode in this arrangement... You are right, the base-emitter junction is really a true diode... But this is only the first diode. Because there is another &quot;diode&quot; - a regulating element (a voltage-controlled resistor) that changes its present resistance (now, between the T1's collector and the emitter) so that to keep up an almost constant voltage. Again, we have made it behave in this way - as a voltage-stable resistor, as another forward-biased diode!

So, in this arrangement, we have two diodes - the first (base-emitter junction) is genuine, the second (collector-emitter part) is artificial. And these two diodes are connected in parallel to each other. Only, the BE diode is low-power (driving) while the CE &quot;diode&quot; is powerful, &quot;executive&quot;. The BE diode consumes only 1/(1 + β) portion of the whole current. The CE part serves as a shunting regulating element that diverts the great amount (β/(1 + β)) of the current. So, what the circuit &quot;sees&quot; is not only a diode, it &quot;sees&quot; a shunted, powerful diode... We can even say that since the CE shunting &quot;diode&quot; predominates over the BE true diode (it is β times more powerful than the BE diode) the circuit &quot;observes&quot; only the CE &quot;diode&quot;!


Well, [[w:User:Brews ohare|Brews ohare]], that's enough; I suggest correcting the original article text from

''...But it is very primitive and confusing to say &quot;the input transistor Q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is a diode&quot;. Actually, it is not a diode; it is exactly a transistor operating in the active mode. It would be a diode, if its collector was disconnected...''

to

''...But it is not sufficient to say &quot;the input transistor Q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is a diode&quot; since it is not only a diode; it is a &quot;buffered diode&quot;. It would be a bare diode, if its collector was disconnected and only the base-emitter junction was connected...''

or to something similar.

=== True diode as a current mirror input part ===

[[User:Brews ohare|Brews ohare]], I would like to ask you to take up a position on another &quot;scenario&quot; for building BJT current mirror. In this story, we may first use a true diode as a current-setting input part and, as usual, a BJT as an output part. Then, we will note some disadvantages of this arrangement that will make us use another BJT as an input part.

This idea dawned on me when I, looking for current mirror materials on the web, found the Tony Kuphald's [http://www.ibiblio.org/kuphaldt/electricCircuits/Semi/SEMI_4.html#xtocid2146111 Current mirrors] page. He has used such a succession; only he has not given reasons for such a circuit evolution. I regard with respect his web materials; IMO they are the best written popular circuit stories. I know him and I have the intention of inviting him to join [[Circuit Idea|Circuit idea]] stories.

Only, I think there is something confusing and wrong in his material. Can you read thoroughly this material and then give your opinion on it? Do you see something wrong in this arrangement - to connect a bare diode in parallel to the T2's input? Can such an arrangement exist at all? Can it serve as a current mirror?

If we answer these questions, we can show in another credible way the reason of using an ''active diode''. Then, we might invite Tony Kuphaldt to join this discussion, to edit this page or to write new one. 

I have an opinion but I prefer first to see what you think about it.

== Vout of Input Part is const ==

I'm confusing about this point:
If this Vout of input part is a const and won't be changed with the input currrent, then the output current won't be changed also as this voltage is Vbe of output part and therefore will decide the output current. So the result is if we change the input current configuration resistor, the output current won't follow this change;

Would you please give me a more detail explanation? Thanks!

:Hi, your question is interesting and important. Vout (or V&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; of an ordinary diode) is relatively constant. In some cases, e.g. in a case of a voltage stabilizer or if the second device has a large operating range, we assume it is constant because its variations are insignificant in comparison with the voltage range. In the case of a current mirror, we assume it depends logarithmically on the input current (see [[Circuit Idea/How to Reverse Current Direction#Operation|Fig. 8]]) in comparison with the transistor's input voltage range.

== The FB-based reverse is incomplete ==

It is amazing how one can decompose an initially miraculous circuit into principal blocks. Yet, thinking in terms of feedback causes trouble when trying to understand the metamorphosis turning the transistor into its inverse. This book helped me to understand that the feedback not only a way to keep the output at specific level but also a lookup of the input that produces given output. Normally, &quot;internal input&quot; ''i'' is adjusted by ''i'' = ''i''+''Δi'', where ''Δi'' = ''ref'' - ''o'' is the difference between primary input ''ref'' and &quot;internal output&quot; ''o''. In your example, the current (and collector voltage) is the reference input and base voltage is the internal input. But I see no comparator. Instead, I see that the internal output controls our golden reference, the input current! You see, instead of matching with the golden signal, feedback controls it. Next, the two drivers, the primary input and our transistor converter, must fight -- who is stronger (explained in [[wikipedia:Commutation cell|Commutation cell]]). Analysis reveals that the mirror reference input always wins because, when the transistor is too closed, the current can go through the base (and open it). It will also close the transistor if the collector voltage is too low for the given current. The solution comes from understanding the transistor operation while the feedback view seems only to cause trouble. The book is otherwise great, yet, I feel like it lacks a last remark to explain the trick of actual FB implementation. Or, is it supposed that the audience is of competence to guess itself? --[[w:User:Javalenok|Javalenok]] ([[w:User talk:Javalenok|talk]]) 14:39, 17 October 2009 (UTC)

:[[w:User:Javalenok|Javalenok]], your thoughts are very interesting for me. I noted your insertion this evening; so, please let mi scrutinize them. If you want, you may join as well another interesting talk - Wikipedia discussion about [[w:Talk:Emitter-coupled logic|Emitter-coupled logic]] where I appear as [[w:User:Circuit-dreamer|Circuit-dreamer]] and sometimes with my old WP user name ''Circuit-fantasist''.

Hi Retropunk,

I just added a comment on [[Talk:Japanese#Wow._This_is_a_mess]] which I wanted to draw your attention to as you're involved in this book. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 05:12, 10 June 2008 (UTC)

== Typo in page name ==

Hi Retropunk,

I found [[Japanese/Lessons/Leeson_7]] while browsing orphaned pages. [[Japanese/Lessons/Lesson_7]] seems to be a more recent version of the former. Is it OK to delete that orphan? --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 13:02, 10 June 2008 (UTC)

== Wikistress? ==

Hi Retropunk,

Thanks for all your hard work on the Japanese wikibook lately. I'm happy that this effort to make sense of the existing material has been sustained so far.

I wasn't, however, quite sure what to make of the tone in your last few comments. I quickly wanted to check if you were unhappy with the direction or pace of progress; and, if so, whether that was something we could try to sort out before continuing.

I think we both want the best for this book and believe that discussing the ideas we have for it will benefit it greatly. A fresh viewpoint can often serve well, not only to spot the flaws in poor ideas, but also to improve already good ones.

I was a little confused by your comments on [[Talk:Japanese/Reading Hiragana]]. &quot;''Do what you want to do.''&quot; Since it seems you've spent a good deal of your time on these pages I wanted to first approach you on this. Both to avoid stepping on your toes, and to get your oppinion on this; constructive critisism would be preferable.

I hope we can continue to work together to make this book the best it can be. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 02:43, 27 June 2008 (UTC)

: I wrote a comment on that talk page several times before I gave up.  

: The use of roomaji on a pronunciation table would only benefit the people who wish to impress people with their minimal Japanese speaking capability.  Some people may be able to become fluent off of just learning words in roomaji.  The use of roomaji as a guide for people to learn hiragana and katakana isn't better any better.  In my opinion, the book should reference sounds as a pronunciation supplement for the kana scripts and not the hepburn transliteration.  However, I don't know of any PD sound files for the entire syllabary.  Another problem is when writing the kana scripts on a keyboard with IME or some other language software.  IME translates the hepburn roomaji into kana and into kanji.  

: To summarize, I would not mind if all three scripts (hiragana, katakana, and roomaji) are provided for all concepts.  I find it counterproductive to have it in strictly roomaji.  --[[User:Retropunk|Retropunk]] ([[User talk:Retropunk|talk]]) 03:22, 27 June 2008 (UTC)

:: I'm still confused. Could you please tell me if you're frustrated by the progress on the Japanese wikibook? My comments above weren't specific to the talk page I linked to.
:: Regarding that talk page. My last comment there only briefly mentioned romaji. The bulk of it was on how to best place content on the various pages. I'm, furthermore, in no way inflexible on any point.
:: It's this sort of stuff that leads me to think that you're frustrated. You seem to catch only the biggest sticking point in comments and lash out at them. I think we can conduct this in a much more constructive way. What do you think? --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 03:34, 27 June 2008 (UTC)

::: I'm not frustrated on the progress on the Japanese wikibook, put please stop with the &quot;[...] much more constructive [...]&quot; talk.  I'm not a child.  

:::I've already stated my thoughts on using roomaji (which the current pronunciation page uses) as a resource.  I suggested moving the Kana page portions to the page, which you disagreed with this.  I've suggested moving the current pronunciation to roomaji page, since it's all in roomaji.  You disagreed with this.  I've suggested to putting everything into the page (pronunciation wise) - although I really wouldn't want to do this, but you believe that character pronunciation is some how vastly different from reading aloud.  I'm tired of giving suggestions for this page.  It's not &quot;constructive&quot; for either one of us for you to disagree with every one of them, or for me to disagree with you.  If you have your vision on how it should look like, why don't you be [[WB:BOLD]] and do it.  I'm done with my input for it.  --[[User:Retropunk|Retropunk]] ([[User talk:Retropunk|talk]]) 04:20, 27 June 2008 (UTC)

:::: Your comments on my disagreement with your suggestions indicates that you don't find this part of the collaboration less than constructive. I'm not treating you as a child when I stating that I believe we can and hope that we would conduct it better. I'm treating you like a rational human being interested in discussion.
:::: You list three points of disagreement and portray them like some long feud where I've been blowing off every one of your attempts to compromise. Rather, you've made two comments on [[Talk:Japanese/Reading Hiragana]]. After the former I give you a rationale for my opinion of how I see the content should be divided among these pages. I also give you my opinion that I believe romaji to be most useful for the pronunciation page and that I don't see much value in the Kana page (the content of which already exists on these other pages).
:::: Nowhere do I state any of my opinions to be superior to yours. Never do I call your opinions or reasoning ridiculous. I've asked you for the argument for your views and am willing to be change my mind. I'm interested in discussing our differences as I believe it will improve the book. I understand that such a discussion may not be possible.
:::: I'm going to back off from this and will refrain from contacting you again. I'm still interested in your comments and hope that you will review my contributions on this book and contact me if you're not happy with my work.

== Japanese book update ==

Hi Retropunk,

I hope you are doing well despite a heavy workload. I just thought I'd drop a line to let you know my thoughts for the next few weeks and to see how you were doing.

My pace slowed down considerably after my old computer broke down. I've got a new one in the meantime, but am struggling with a few technical problems and won't be as productive as I'd like to be for a while. So far, I'm quite happy with where we've been able to take this book. We've trimmed away 33 pages, 15 navbars and printable versions, and 6 templates. [[:Category:Japanese]] is now down to a much more manageable 176 pages (with an extra 39 in [[:Category:Japanese vocabulary]]).

I spend a bit of time today reordering a few things on the [[Japanese/Contents]] page. I think it's beginnig to show quite nicely the reduncancies. The next step for me is to try to tackle some of these and merge where possible. I believe that only then can we start to massage the avaialable content into the structure give by a syllabus. There a lot of work to do, but while it may take long to get this done I think the end of this stage is at least in sight.

There are a few things I'd like your thoughts on. One is on the redundancy between [[Japanese/Reading Hiragana]] and [[Japanese/Kana]]. I took large chunks of the former and spliced into the latter with the intent to create a page that would merge the two kana pages since the two syllabaries share a lot of concepts, while leaving the pronunciation of these to [[Japanese/Pronunciation]] (where I've added some soundbytes that I found on Commons). You didn't see eye to eye with me on this, but I'm fine with leaving two versions of this content if there is support for either.

Given that you've  been absent for a while, I figured I'd check in to see whether you knew how much you could contribute to the project in the near and far future. If you'll be away for a while yet, but have any concerns that you'd like me to keep in mind (such as whether you'd like to keep the [[Japanese/Reading Hiragana]] page and give it equal prominence on the [[Japanese]] page) please let me know.

Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;
--[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 06:01, 10 September 2008 (UTC)

:I may be around occasionally to check on things, but putting a heavy effort into material is probably out of the question... at least in the near future.  I'm normally free on Sundays and generally tired by then.  I've looked your current rendition of [[Japanese/Kana]], and while I have problems with it (e.g., references another page purely in romaji, kana page is partially romaji), I can live with it and the removal of [[Japanese/Reading Hiragana]].  I don't think there's a feasible way to make what I would be perfectly content until we get PD wav files for the all of the pronunciation.  However, I would think we should require the person to review the pronunciation page instead of &quot;See also:&quot;, which is more like a suggestion.  I can ask a native to provide sound files - or at least try to find someone savvy enough to record them.  My Japanese isn't even near perfect, so I would be a horrible choice.

:The syllabus would be tough.  It may be just wiser to have a constantly updated syllabus, but a consistently updated.  A contributor can add to the syllabus their lesson (after making sure it's not a duplicated material) and add what they want.  If we implement Junesun's plan, I don't think it's necessarily bad if the storyline is disjointed.  It should be easy for everyone if we just make a starting point and a guideline to making an addition to the syllabus.  --[[User:Retropunk|Retropunk]] ([[User talk:Retropunk|talk]]) 07:27, 10 September 2008 (UTC)

:: Thanks for the reply and the comments.
:: My reasoning for using romaji on the pronunciation page was that it's pretty much the first step into the language -- learning to enunciate what you are reading -- and thus students won't know any Japanese characters yet. The kana page does use latin characters for a number of words (e.g. dakuten and sokuon -- these is what you're talking about, right?) since the text is, after all, in English. Similarly we talk about a hamza, not a الهَمْزة when writing about Farsi in English.
:: I recognise the importance of using Japanese to practice and have purged several dialogues and vocabulary lists of romaji. I just find them akward these attempts to squeeze Japanese characters in wherever possible. There are perfectly good English words for these concepts. English text with English characters, Japanese text with Japanese characters.
:: I completely agree with you that the pronuciation page desperately needs more audio files. I don't mind leaving the page without these for a while. The rest of the book isn't that great anyway. Before this ever becomes a recommendable resource, we'll have to secure some decent ones. We're just not there yet.
:: I left the link to the pronunciation page as a &quot;See also&quot; figuring that the order of links on the [[Japanese]] page would imply that it was a &quot;required&quot; read. I'm reluctant to introduce &quot;required&quot; material at this point. We're nowhere close to binding this book properly together and people learn differently anyway. I don't think we need to hold students' hands all the way. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 08:13, 10 September 2008 (UTC)

:: By the way, I contacted [[commons:User talk:Marsian]] last month and in passing asked if he'd be able to contribute sound files for the pronunciation page. He never got back to me, but I find his work to be of very good quality and would love to have a full set of audio files by him. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 14:24, 10 September 2008 (UTC)

::: The use of romaji has always been my problem.  Reading romaji is going to be a small portion of everyday Japanese. However, I'm willing to let this go as I have no idea how to represent the pronunciation without a full media library for the entire syllabary.  I don't mind waiting on the &quot;required&quot; material.    --[[User:Retropunk|Retropunk]] ([[User talk:Retropunk|talk]]) 03:30, 11 September 2008 (UTC)

== Lessons development ==

Hi Retropunk,

We've been managing a steady pace in getting through the [[Japanese/Contents]] which is positive. I've personally started on the easy stuff; merging pure grammer overviews and not adding much content. Every now and then, however, I glance over the meatier pages as well as your grammar list and wonder about how best to tackle that.

Not that I'm anywhere near that stage. I plan to concentrate on those grammar pages for now, but I was been wondering if you had formed some idea as for how and when you would like to move along with the work you started. If you think it would be useful to start hacking up and rewriting specific parts of the available content (such as the the introductions and other basic stuff of which we have way too many copies) to use in the first lessons in order to test some of your ideas, please let me know and I can give these higher priority when I'm choosing tasks. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 19:38, 4 February 2009 (UTC)
: I really haven't thought about moving forward on the lesson plans.  I suppose I've been hoping we would get a somewhat expert, but no one has really shown up.  Junesun gave an series of 'events' and vocab/grammar to be used for the first few lessons, which really isn't that bad from what I recall.  I've just been too lazy to either hack up the existing and/or make new material.  If you want, you can go ahead and take a hack at it.  I believe my current setup for lessons is solid, but I'm opened to new ideas on presenting the material. -- [[User:Retropunk|Retropunk]] ([[User talk:Retropunk|talk]]) 05:13, 6 February 2009 (UTC)

:: I see. Do you reckon you won't contribute much to this Wikibook once we finish refactoring and copyediting the existing content? I'll have a look through your grammar points list and see if I can come up with an interesting path through them. It would be a very long term goal for me, though. You mentioned that JLPT is now five levels. Do you know how that has affected the material for the lowest level?
:: If you're looking for another Japanese-related project in dire need of help, there is always the [[JLPT Guide]]. Patching it up to reflect the new level might help catch prospective contributors who otherwise might just pass on. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 15:31, 6 February 2009 (UTC)
::: The new level is between 2 and 3.  There should be no difference for 2,3,4; and JLPT1 is believed to become more difficult.  I'm not really sure what my future will be on this book.  It's not that I don't think I'll be contributing, but more of, &quot;Can I even contribute once we're at a certain point?&quot;  Lately, it's been more of, &quot;I'm too tired to even think.&quot;  I'll try making a few more pleas to a few more ENG&lt;-&gt;JAP  discussions groups: sci.lang.japan, lang-8 (again), and other high-traffic sites.. if i can find more. -- [[User:Retropunk|Retropunk]] ([[User talk:Retropunk|talk]]) 16:51, 6 February 2009 (UTC)

:::: Well, everyone has a point where they won't be able to contribute further. Let's see what your enquiries bring.
:::: Hope you get some rest to regain your strength ... for wherever your path lies! --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 17:07, 6 February 2009 (UTC)

I've been thinking some more about the lesson plan. What is your source for the list at [[User:Retropunk/Japanese Curriculum/Outline/Beginner Lessons/Grammar]]? I'm interested partly because I'm a stickler for process and would like to document things for future contributors, but also because I'd like to see the corresponding lists for the other levels so as to have an idea how the form might scale and the various levels fit together.

Let me know if you hear anything from these discussion groups. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 17:38, 16 February 2009 (UTC)
: [http://www.jlptstudy.com/ JLPT Study] has the grammar for JLPT4/3.  It doesn't have JLPT2/1.  
: [http://www.e-japanese.jp/grammar.htm  E-Japanese] Some more.  It has some JLPT2/1 points.
: [http://www.tanos.co.uk/jlpt/] Shows examples for JLPT1/2.  Links to EJapanese for 3/4.

: It may also be useful to buy Kanzen Master.  It's highly regarded. In general, you could just type &quot;JLPT2 Grammar&quot; and you'll get tons of hits.  --[[User:Retropunk|Retropunk]] ([[User talk:Retropunk|talk]]) 17:12, 17 February 2009 (UTC)

:: The only JLPT4 grammar I found at these sites was on [http://www.e-japanese.jp/grammar4.htm this E-Japanese page]. I also tried to search a bit myself, but couldn't find much of any worth, and certainly nothing as detailed as what you compiled! I was really surprised about the lack of content on the JLPT official site.
:: I've been looking over the list and think I might try to order them up into roughly twenty lessons with a grammar point or two per each. I'm only worried about two things: that the list is incomplete or that I'll do poor enough a job at it that someone else will see it best to toss my work. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 14:18, 20 February 2009 (UTC)
::: My list of grammar points came from JLPTStudy.com.  I took their list and compiled it a bit.  The best scenario would to get a book like Kanzen Master (or Complete Master)... but they don't have one for JLPT4.   --[[User:Retropunk|Retropunk]] ([[User talk:Retropunk|talk]]) 22:19, 21 February 2009 (UTC)

:::: I couldn't find any such list on JLPTStudy, I browsed everything linked from http://www.jlptstudy.com/4/: [http://www.jlptstudy.com/4/jlpt4_vocab-list.html], [http://www.jlptstudy.com/4/jlpt4_expression-list.html] and [http://www.jlptstudy.com/4/jlpt4_kanji-list_main.html]. The closest thing to a grammar list was on a site linked to from JLPTStudy: http://www.mlcjapanese.co.jp/. They have a bunch of material including a [http://www.mlcjapanese.co.jp/DownloadF/4-5-GrammarInPastTest.pdf grammar list] from past tests.
:::: One of the reasons I'm so interested in finding a good source is to be able to update our list and the book. The JLPT is a useful measure but if we don't document how this book relates to the topics being tested, reader won't have much of a guarantee that it actually prepares them for the test, and future contribuotrs won't know how to update the book to reflect changes in the test. We'll need to create some sort of a lesson plan that can be maintained and for that we need to reference primary sources where we get the grammar.
:::: A (very quick and narrow) interenet search revealed [http://benippon.com/shop/product_info.php?products_id=20455 JLPT Taisaku Koumoku Seiri - 4 Kyuu Mondai-shuu] which might also be a useful resource. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 05:49, 2 March 2009 (UTC)
::::: [http://www.jlptstudy.com/4/jlpt4_grammar-list.html this] is the exact page  I took my list from - well, I may have update the list some.  MLC has a lot of tests, practice work, and other fun stuff.  I don't know about the book you mentioned. --[[User:Retropunk|Retropunk]] ([[User talk:Retropunk|talk]]) 06:56, 2 March 2009 (UTC)

== Japanese particles ==

Hey Retropunk! すごい久しぶりだね。I just noticed you recently touched on a couple of lesson pages you'd started. I've not been very active on the wikibook for a while, but recently revisited the particle pages trying to clean them up. I've moved all the essential particles to [[Japanese/Grammar/Basic Particles]] but have yet to merge most of the text. The sentence ending particles are in [[Japanese/Lessons/Sentence ending particles]] and then there's a misc-bin at [[Japanese/Lessons/Other uses of particles]]. That last one needs a lot of work and could even be split into two or three subjects but I think the other two are on their way to being presentable.

If you're looking for quick and easy tasks to dabble with, feel free to look over these pages and even clean up a section or two. I reckon they're just a few hours' work from being linked to from the [[Japanese]] page. Then I think I'll try to move to finishing sorting out the [[Sugu ni Hajimemashō|Japanese/Grammar]]&lt;!-- Link fixed 2010.05.19. -- Swift --&gt; page with links from each section to the relevant grammar and lesson page (if there are any).

Either way, glad to see you're still around and I look forward to seeing how your lesson pages develop. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 01:15, 7 May 2010 (UTC)

: Really, I'm not even sure how much I'll be contributing.  Someone recently added a conversation to [[User:Retropunk/Japanese_Curriculum/Lesson_2 | Lesson 2]] and some vocab, but that was about it.  I saw some minor errors and fixed those. Each time I'm ready to sit down and start again, I have some life-changing event.  I've been hoping to push a conversation for this wikibook on other resources (that allow the 'hey, come check this resource out and help contribute!') without breaking some community rule.  I'll look at the links and work you've done.  [[User:Retropunk|Retropunk]] ([[User talk:Retropunk|talk]]) 03:15, 7 May 2010 (UTC)

:: Speaking of other resources, I've recently come across [http://rhinospike.com/ Rhinospike] which I think could be a great resource for native speaker audio which has been sorely missing and is absolutely crucial. Uploaded content is free under a CC license.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In 747, the Abbasids, a Hashemite tribe rose in rebellion against the Umayyads and deposed them, killing the Umayyad Caliph. The Abbasids captured the throne and established the Abbasid Caliphate. They shifted the capital from Damascus to Baghdad from where they ruled till the 10th century AD.  

== Establishment of the Abbasid Caliphate ==

In 747, the Abbasids rose in rebellion against the Umayyads in order to capture the throne and realize their age-old claim to the leadership of the Arab world by virtue of their being descendants of Muhammad's yongest uncle Abbas. They received the ardent support of the Persians, Jews, Christians and Egyptians. The Persians participation in the rebellion , in particular, was enormous and had it not been for the overwhelming support of the Persians which the Abbasids received they would not have been able to capture the throne.  

In 750, matters became so serious that the Umayyad Caliph Marwan II was forced to take note. He led a large Umayyad force into Iraq to strike the rebelling Abbasids. But despite the disparity of numbers, the Umayyad forces were overwhelmed at the Battle of the Zab on January 25, 750. Marwan fled to Egypt where he was captured and killed.   Abu al-`Abbās `Abdu'llāh as-Saffāh ibn Muhammad, an Abbasid, became the Caliph of the Islamic world establishing the Abbasid dynasty.

== As Saffah ==

'''Abu al-`Abbās `Abdu'llāh''' also known as '''As Saffah''' or &quot;The Slaughterer&quot; was the first Abbasid Caliph. He put an end to the practice of discrimination against non-Arabs initiated by the Umayyads and recruited freely from amongst the Jews, Nestorian Christians and Persians. Moreover, he shifted the capital from Damascus to Baghdad (which was nearer to the Persian heartland) making it the centre of arts and learning. Education was also encouraged, and the first paper mills, staffed by skilled Chinese prisoners captured at the Battle of Talas, were set up in Samarkand.

Abu al Abbas earned the epitheth &quot;The Slaughterer&quot; due to cruel punishment he handed over to the Umayyads. Due to his anti-Umayyad pogroms, they were almost extinguished, with the exception of Abd Ar Rahman I who fled to Spain and established Umayyad rule over Al Andalus.

As Saffah died of smallpox on Jun 10, 754, after a reign of four years. He was succeeded by his brother Al Mansur.

== Al Mansur ==

'''Al mansur''' a brother of As Saffah ascended the throne in 754 and ruled till 775. In 762, he established the royal residential complex of Madinat As Salam in Baghdad. 

In 755, Al Mansur ordered the assassination of Abu Muslim whom he perceived as a serious threat to his power.  According to Shiite sources, the scholar Abu Hanifa an-Nu'man was imprisoned by al-Mansur and tortured. He also had Imam Malik, the founder of another school of law, flogged. 

During the reign of Al Mansur, there was general tolerance for non-Arab subjects of the Empire.Censorship for Persian works of literature was removed.  The era of persecution of non-Arab populations which had characterized Umayyad rule had long since come to an end and Persian arts and sciences were held in high esteem. This led to the growth of a literary movement known as the ''Shu'ubiya''.  Al Mansur is also credited with having established the ''House of Wisdom'' in Baghdad. The Abbasid Caliphate supported conversions as a result of which whole communities of non-Muslims embraced Islam. The proportion of Muslims in the Empire doubled from 7% in 750 to 15% in 775.

Al-Mansur died in 775 on his way to Mecca to make hajj. He was buried somewhere along the way in one of the hundreds of graves that had been dug in order to hide his body from the Umayyads. He was succeeded by his son, al-Mahdi.

== Al Mahdi ==

Al Mahdi ascended the throne on the death of his father Al Mansur in 775. The reign of Al Mahdi is marked with general prosperity. Baghdad grew into a big and prosperous city.The city attracted immigrants from all of Arabia, Iraq, Syria, Persia, and lands as far away as India and Spain. Baghdad was home to Christians, Jews, Hindus, and Zoroastrians, in addition to the growing Muslim population. It became the world's largest city outside China. It was also the centre of the Empire's paper-manufacturing industry. 

Al Mahdi's reign is also remembered for the persecution of the ''zanadiqa'', or dualists and the protection of the orthodoxy. Al-Mahdi declared that the caliph had the ability – and indeed, the responsibility – to define the orthodox theology of Muslims, in order to protect the Muslim ''ummah'' against heresy.

Al Mahdi died in 785 and was succeeded by his son Al Hadi.

== Al Hadi ==

Al Hadi succeeded Al Mahdi in 785 and ruled for about an year. He was renowned for his openness and simplicity. There was a rebellion in Medina in which Husayn ibn Ali ibn Hasan declaredf himself Caliph but this rebellion was crushed by Al Hadi but one Idris escaped from the battlefield and established the Idrissi state in Morocco. Al Hadi also had to face a Kharijite rebellion and a Byzantine invasion but he dealt with them efficiently.

== Harun Al Rashid ==

Harun Al Rashid ascended the throne in 786 and ruled till 809. He was the '''greatest monarch of the Islamic Empire'''. 

Harun Al Rashid was born in Tehran to Al Mahdi, the third Abbasid Caliph and an Yemeni slave girl called Al Khayzarun. Hārūn became caliph when he was in his early twenties. On the day of accession, his son al-Ma'mun was born, and al-Amin some little time later. 

It was under Hārūn ar-Rashīd that Baghdad flourished into the most splendid city of its period. Tribute was paid by many rulers to the caliph, and these funds were used on architecture, the arts and a luxurious life at court.

In 796, Harun Al Rashid moved his capital from Baghdad to the town of Ar Raqqah located in the middle Euphrates due to security  reasons. In 798, he threw the minister Yahya ibn Khalid in jail and killed his son Jafar in order to counter the rising influence of the Barmakids. 

During the later part of his reign, he invaded the Byzantine Empire with an army of 95,000 Arabs and Persians. Harun defeated the Byzantine general Nicetas and marched upon Chrysopolis in Turkey. Chrysopolis is located in the vicinity of the Byzantine capital Constantinople. Empress Irene, the ruler of the Byzantine Empire submitted and agreed to pay yearly tribute to the Abbasids.  The Abbasid Caliphate was at the zenith of its power.

=== Islam's Golden Age ===

Harun Al Rashid's reign is universally regarded as the golden age of the Islamic Caliphate. His reign saw the flowering of Islamic culture and civilization. Many foreign books were translated into Arabic during this period. The most popular amongst them was the ''Arabian Nights'' which was actually an anthology of Persian and Indian tales translated into Arabic. The Persian translations of the ''Panchatantra'' too were translated into Arabic  during this time.

Harun gave great encouragement to learning, poetry and music. He was a scholar and poet himself and whenever he heard of learned men in his own kingdom, or in neighboring countries, he invited them to his court and treated them with respect. The name of Hārūn, therefore, became known throughout the world. At Tabari (v. 30 p. 313) refers to the physician Mankah coming from India to treat Harun. Harun had diplomatic relations with China and with Charlemagne.

=== The Barmakids ===

The '''Barmakids''' were descended from one '''Barmak''' who was a high-priest of a Hindu/Buddhist temple of the same province. However, the latter seems to be most probable as Nowbahar could easily be a corruption of the Buddhist monastery of ''Nava-vihara'' (which gave name to the modern-day Afghan province of ''Nagarhar''). Barmak is regarded as a corruption of ''Pramukh'', the Sanskrit word for &quot;head priest&quot;. Historian Andre Clot too agrees with the fact. He says that they &quot;came from Khorasan, but their roots were Buddhist, not Zoroastrian&quot;

In the early part of the eighth century, Barmak settled in Damascus and converted to Islam. However, the fortunes of the Barmaks rose only after the replacement of the Umayyads with the Abbasids. The Barmakids greatly benefitted by the policy of tolerance followed by the Abbasids. Khalid, the son of Barmak became the Prime Minister or ''Wazir'' of Al Saffah, the first Caliph of the Umayyad dynasty. His son Yahya aided Harun Al Rashid in capturing the throne and rose to power as the most powerful man in the Empire. The Barmakids were remarkable for their majesty, splendor and hospitality. They are even mentioned in the some stories of the ''Arabian Nights''.

''Cephalotus'' is a genus of pitcher plants which contains one species, ''Cephalotus follicularis''. 
The common names for this small, carnivorous plant are: Albany Pitcher Plant, the fly-catcher plant, the mocassin plant, or the Western Australian Pitcher Plant. The plant is cultivated for the unusual insect traps of its modified leaves. It is not closely related to any other species.

==Description==
''Cephalotus follicularis'' is a small, ornamental plant which traps and eats insects. Some of the leaves are modified, creating pitcher-like traps filled with digestive enzymes. These are small, green, and described as looking like moccasins, little sacks (Latin: ''follicules''), or a pitcher. The other leaves on the plant are simple, more conventional in appearance, with an unbroken outline. The foliage is arranged at ground level and are crowded together, the pitchers are outward facing and usually sit beneath the simple leaves. These leaves give the main form of the species, the height is around 200 mm.

The 'pitcher' trap of the species are similar to other pitcher plants. The rim at the entrance of the trap has a spiked, inward facing, structure that allows the prey to enter, but hinder its escape. The lid over the entrance prevents rainwater entering the pitcher, preventing dilution of the digestive solution. The enzymes in the bottom of the pitcher digests the insects, those unable to escape are consumed by the plant. The lid is partly transparent, this confuses its prey by appearing like patches of sky. The mechanism does not close like other carnivorous plants, but escape is difficult once the prey enters the pitfall trap.

The flowers appear in small clusters on long stalks, and are creamy, or whitish. ''Cephalotus'' can be propagated from leaf or root cuttings; in the wild, plants establish small colonies from their roots.
Also when a great white shark comes the Cephalotus can be very agressive. For instance, the great white can eat the plant but the Cephalotus can attack by using the acid from its fangs to instanly kill the gret white shark

==Growing conditions==
The plant was originally found in southern coastal areas of Southwest Australia, a mediterranean climate, regions that are cool and moist. It prefers well drained peaty sands found around swamps, creeks, and streams, where it might experience seasonally dry periods. In the wild, they prefer warm day-time temperatures of up to 25 degrees Celsius during the growing season(spring, summer, and the early months of autumn), coupled with cool night-time temperatures.
In the cooler months of winter (down to about 5 degrees Celsius), they have a natural dormancy period of about 3-4 months, triggered by the temperature drop and reduced light levels, where they often drastically slow or stop growth altogether.

In cultivation, this winter rest is unnecessary and the plants may be grown as any subtropical plant, although dormancy can result in somewhat larger pitchers. Should a grower allow dormancy to occur, it is extremely important that the Albany pitcher plant receive a drastically reduced amount of water, enough to keep the soil just barely damp. This will help to prevent diseases and fungi which may set in and rot the rhizome and roots. Also, it is best to not let the plant freeze over, as this will kill the above ground portion of the plant and possibly the roots, although plants have been known to recover from such harsh conditions.

==Varieties==
&lt;!--general discussion or bulleted list--&gt;

==Uses==
''Cephalotus'' are grown successfully around the world in cultivation. The peculiar appearance and insectivorous habits of the ''Cephalotus'' make an appealing ornamental garden plant, or an exotic specimen in the greenhouse. 
&lt;!--Ornamental uses, food crop, material use (lumber, cut flower), etc.--&gt;

==Maintenance==
[[Image:CephalotusFollicularis2.JPG|thumb|260px|left|''[[Cephalotus follicularis]]'': a young plant of about 2-3 years, grown in cultivation.]]
As spring approaches, the plants will produce many non-carnivorous [[Leaf|leaves]], which are thought to aid in photosynthetic processes. In mid-spring, ''Cephalotus follicularis'' will start producing small, fuzzy knob-like structures, which, after a matter of weeks, will inflate and become the season's first set of pitchers. During this period, the growing season, the substrate must be kept damp to moist and never allowed to dry out completely. However, it need be extremely well-drained, to help prevent [[Root rot|root and rhizome rot]]. This is often achieved by the use of the tray method of watering, in which the plant's pot is kept in a 1/4 inch of water or less. The tray may be allowed to dry completely between waterings as a prophylactic measure against root rot. Additionally, watering from the top, at least occasionally, may prevent rot by oxygenating the soil with dissolved O2 and also encourage root proliferation. One grower even recommends the use of an aquarist's airstone to increase the natural level of dissolved O2 in his water, although this is not necessary.

''Cephalotus follicularis'' tolerates many soil types, the most commonly used is a mixture of sphagnum peat moss, perlite, and sand used for propagation/horticultural purposes. A reasonable humidity (60-80%) is also preferred. Too high a humidity will encourage many pests to set in, such as scale, and diseases which cause the plant's crowns to rot. Too low a humidity is not tolerated as often the plant will wilt and close its lid (operculum) (however, it is possible to slowly adjust your Cephalotus to lower humidity). The plants become colourful and grow vigorously when kept in direct sunlight, while plants cultivated in bright shade remain green.
&lt;!--discuss any special maintenance concerns, such as pruning, transplanting, monitoring, etc.--&gt;

==Propagation==
[[Image:CephalotusFollicularis1.JPG|thumb|240px|right|''Cephalotus follicularis'': a young pitcher.]]
Propagate ''Cephalotus follicularis'' through leaf and root cuttings, and, as a much slower method, through seed. Pinch off the leaves (both carnivorous pitchers and non-carnivorous leaves may be used) from the base of the plant, while trying to keep as much of the whitish base intact as possible. These leaves are then placed upon milled sphagnum moss or a mixture of sphagnum peat/perlite/sand; small amounts of substrate are placed over the whitish base of the leaf. The leaves must receive bright light and remain covered to ensure high humidity. In many weeks plantlets will appear at the base of the leaves. Propagation from root cuttings is similar. Roots and parts of the rhizome can be cut into pieces an inch long and then treated similarly to the leaf cuttings. Propagation through seed is a much slower way, but is possible. Seed must first be stratified, where they are placed in cold, slightly damp conditions for 2-3 months before sowing upon milled sphagnum or a peat/perlite/sand mix in warm conditions, bright light, and high humidity. The seed may take from weeks to months to germinate, and will be extremely slow growing.
&lt;!--discuss propagation--&gt;

[[Image:Sidereus Nuncius 1610.Galileo.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Title page of the first edition of ''Siderus Nuncius'', 1610]]
Galileo made some very important discoveries in Astronomy which directly opposes the Aristotlean Astronomy and Ptolemic Theory (''which is also based on Aristotlean principles'').He made the extensive use of his newly discovered telescope observing the night sky.This important discoveries were first published in his book ''Siderus Nuncius (1610)'' or ''The Starry Messanger'' in English.

According to Aristotle the Moon and other heavenly bodies are made of ''quintessence'' which never changes and they are perfectly spherical in shape.But Galileo with his telescope observed that Moon has craters and mountains on its surface.

He also observed that four satellites are revolving around Jupiter.It also opposes Aristotle as according to him everything in the universe should rotate around the Earth.

Galileo had made his most important contributions to mechanics.He introduced the three laws of falling bodies which utterly refutes the Aristotlean view of motion and provides the very basis of Newton`s laws of motion.He proved that the distance &lt;math&gt;d\,&lt;/math&gt; traveled by any object falling from zero &lt;math&gt;(0)\,&lt;/math&gt; initial velocity is &lt;br&gt; &lt;math&gt;d=\frac {gt^2}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Aristotle and Natural Philosophy'''

Aristotle(384 BC – 322 BC) was the greatest philosopher of ancient Greece.He had discussed almost all the branches of knowledge.Studying ''Nature'' was essentially one of his principal interest.''Knowledge of nature'' or ''natural philosophy'' is ''physis'' in Greek from which the word ''Physics'' derived.Aristotle covered this in his several works such as ''Physics, On The Heavens, Meteorology'' etc.He set the principles of ''natural philosophy'' in ''Metaphysics.''

Aristotle proposed four ''elements'' of which all natural objects on ''earth'' consist of.They are ''Air, Water, Earth and Fire.''He also proposed that the ''heavenly bodies'' or objects in the sky(stars, planets, moon etc.) are completely independent of earth and they are made of another completely different thing called ''quintessence''.''Quintessence'' itself and objects made of it do not change with time or any other cause.

Aristotle assumed ''earth'' as the center of the universe, according to him all objects in the universe rotates around ''earth''.

According to Aristotle every ''event'' is lead by a ''cause'' and principal objective of ''natural philosophy'' is to find ''causes'' behind events.

According to Aristotle's dynamics the natural state of all body is ''static,'' everything tends to be static.Some ''force'' applied on an object makes it ''moving'' or an object gains ''velocity'' if force is applied.When the force is withdrawn objects eventually return to their natural state or become ''static.''Mathematically Aristotle says force('''F''') is proportional to velocity('''v''') or &lt;math&gt;F \propto v&lt;/math&gt; which is completely contradictory to the modern view that force('''F''') is proportional to acceleration('''a''') or &lt;math&gt;F \propto a&lt;/math&gt;

But ''Natural Philosophy'' was gradually proving unable to describe nature. Some doctrines (like Copernicus` ''Heliocentric Model'' of the solar system) against it was growing outside universities.

The question is not, &quot;Why think about my religion?&quot; Obviously, if you dedicate yourself to a belief, you will think about it. The question is, &quot;Why think about religion in general?&quot; or &quot;Why think about the nature of all religions?&quot;

Paul Tillich defined religion as &quot;our ultimate concern for the Ultimate,&quot; and although it's too broad a definition for purposes of this work, it underscores a commonality in all religions. What sort of questions do religions answer?

Where do I come from?
What is my essential nature?
What is my ultimate relationship to the universe?
What is the origin of the universe?
Is there any real reason for my existence or am I simply an  accidental product of nature?
Is there a reason to do what I do and is there a reason for abstaining from doing things that I feel that I should not do?
Do I cease my existence at some point in the future and, if not, what happens to me when I die?

Are these questions relevant to people and should they consider them? Obvious extensions of the above questions present themselves and indicate that a religion should be of interest to anyone:

If there is a purpose to my life, what is it and what should I do about it?
If I continue after I die, how should I approach the situation as to improve the condition that I will be in at that time?

Martin Jaffee reminds us that our world view is not the only one and that a consideration of other people's world view reminds us of how precarious our idea of &quot;what ultimately is&quot; is. Therefore a study of religion results in a healthy humility that somewhat protects us from fanaticism.

Robert Odem, in his lecture series on comparative religion emphasizes two reasons to consider religion in its generality. The first is that, like Mount Everest, &quot;it is&quot;, meaning that it is an important part of the lives of people around you and to understand them, you really must understand their religious beliefs.

His second point is that religion is an inextricable part of world affairs. You cannot understand the condition of the Middle East without understanding the religions of the Middle East. You cannot understand world art and architecture without understanding the religious sentiments of the artists. You certainly cannot, for example, understand Bach's achievements without understanding his religious views and his position in the church. Protestantism had a lot to do with the growth of capitalism and the work ethic in America.

To really understand world affairs you cannot dismiss the role and importance of religion.

Hi Mike! 

Just a short ont this time. See the diff here: http://en.wikiversity.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ASB_Johnny%2Fsandbox_8&amp;diff=214768&amp;oldid=214767

You should be able to &quot;grab/replace&quot; the &lt;code&gt;BCP/ &lt;/code&gt; and replace with &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{bcp+|&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, and then just add &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to the end of the line. 

In case you're wondering, we're trying to get a master list of all the BCP profile pages going, to make it easier for folks to find them. 

Thanks! --[[User talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[meta:Wikimedia Pennsylvania|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;PA!&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:02, 14 February 2008 (UTC)

Hi Mike. If you have time for a larger run on Wikibooks (please do the Wikiversity one first... there's more of a deadline for that!), here's the scoop:
*For all pages in [[:Category:Garden plants]], [[:Category:Garden perennials]], and [[:Category:Garden plant genera]]
*#Place the template {{tl|WMOG-header}} on the first line of each page (should share the same line as the beginning brackets of {{tl|hortibox}} and similar). It needs to use the subpagename as the variable, but '''not''' using the magic word (&lt;nowiki&gt;{{SUBPAGENAME}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;), because this template is in part used to add headings to print versions (and so the magic word wouldn't work!). 
*#Replace the category tag (e.g., &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:Garden plants|{{SUBPAGENAME}}]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;) with the following text:
&lt;!--

== Image Deletion ==

I dont even understand the rationale behind the tagging of the image. I have been a Wikipedian for a fairly long amount of time and I have a fairly good knowledge of Wiki's fair use rationale. -[[User:Ravichandar84|Ravichandar84]] ([[User talk:Ravichandar84|talk]]) 17:47, 15 February 2008 (UTC)

:[[foundation:Resolution:Licensing policy|Foundation policy]] states that fair use images must have a rationale. That template simply states &quot;Yes, it meets fair use criteria&quot; - the rationale states ''why'' that is true.

&lt;pre&gt;{{Fairuse rationale

:You need to change | (the pipe character) to &lt;nowiki&gt;&amp;#124;&lt;/nowiki&gt; whenever it's supposed to appear as clear text, otherwise the parser thinks that there are additional parameters to the template, and it doesn't render properly. Also, you should put the wiki markup that is generated by that template for your sig into the signature box in [[Special:Preferences|''my preferences'']]; this avoids some server load, since the template must be called every time you use your signature.

Well, I've read that AWB could be used in Wikibooks. But no other specification is available. I am a Wikipedian and a registered user of AWB. I just wanted to know if I could use AWB in Wikibooks and if In can then how could I use it. If not, then what is the procedure for resgiatering.

:Yes, AWB works here without a check page. I'd actually recommend having a separate account for semi-automated edits, which can then be easily flagged if it becomes a problem. Since we have no check page, you'll probably have access to the bot tab. You can ask for a bot flag at [[WB:RFP]], but it probably won't be given unless you're going to be flooding RC. We technically don't have a policy, but if you pretend that [[WB:BOT]] is policy that should do just fine.

Please make sure that when marking redirects for deletion that they are orphaned (ie there are no pages which link to them). &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:33, 1 March 2008 (UTC)

This book shows how to use [[w:Maxima (software)| Maxima]].
=Installation=
Ways to do it :
* Download and install ready made Maxima deb packages 
** from Ubuntu repositories ( old versions ) 
** from other sites&lt;ref&gt;[https://launchpad.net/~blahota/+archive/wxmaxima/+packages compiled deb packages for Maxima 5.20.1-1 by Istvan Blahota]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Compile your own maxima package&lt;ref&gt;[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Maxima help from ubuntu  community about Maxima]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://zeus.nyf.hu/~blahota/sa/en/ How to build your own Maxima package by Andras Somogyi]&lt;/ref&gt;
* compile maxima from sources ( without creating deb packages ) 

Now the best is a git method and I Blahota repository. 

==from Ubuntu repositories==

You can make use of Synaptic ( Graphical package manager) or apt-get. In second case write in command line:&lt;ref&gt;[http://riotorto.users.sourceforge.net/ubuntu/index-en.html Install from Ubuntu repositories by Mario Rodriguez Riotorto]&lt;/ref&gt; 

 sudo apt-get install maxima

==From sources==
Before compilation, you should have :
* gnuplot, 
* texinfo, 
* texi2html, 
* automake 1.9 
* tk 8.4. 
===CSV===


&lt;pre&gt;
cd maxima
./bootstrap    # only if you downloaded the source code from cvs
./configure --enable-clisp   # or:   --enable-sbcl
make
make check
sudo make install
make clean
&lt;/pre&gt;

This procedure does not create a deb package.

===using git===
If you have git and SBCL then : &lt;ref&gt;[http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.mathematics.maxima.general/42492  How to build Maxima by Rupert Swarbrick]
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
  git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/maxima/code maxima
  cd maxima
  ./bootstrap
  ./configure --with-sbcl
  make
&lt;/pre&gt;


Now one can run it from inside the source directory.


 cd maxima
 ./maxima-local

The result :

&lt;pre&gt;
Maxima branch_5_30_base_104_ged70fb2_dirty http://maxima.sourceforge.net
using Lisp SBCL 1.0.45.0.debian
Distributed under the GNU Public License. See the file COPYING.
Dedicated to the memory of William Schelter.
The function bug_report() provides bug reporting information.
(%i1) 
&lt;/pre&gt;

Xmaxima can also be run :

 cd ~/maxima
 ./xmaxima-local

wxMaxima is not present now.
===from repositories===

After git instyallation one can add wxMaxima. First add repositiories&lt;ref&gt;[https://launchpad.net/~blahota/+archive/wxmaxima/ launchpad : blahota wxmaxima]&lt;/ref&gt; by [http://zeus.nyf.hu/~blahota/linux/ Istvan Balhota] 
 
 sudo apt-add-repository ppa:blahota/wxmaxima

update : 

 sudo apt-get update


Run synaptic

 sudo synaptic

and install wxMaxima.

=Directories=

Start Maxima and type the command:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.utexas.edu/pipermail/maxima/2012/028210.html [Maxima&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; Phantastic Program! One bug - discussion ]&lt;/ref&gt;

    maxima_userdir;

this will tell you the directory that is being used as your user directory. 

=Numbers=
==Number Theory==
There are functions and operators useful with integer numbers

===Elementary number theory===

In Maxima there are some elementary functions like the factorial &lt;nowiki&gt;n!&lt;/nowiki&gt; and the double factorial &lt;nowiki&gt;n!!&lt;/nowiki&gt; defined as &lt;math&gt;\frac{n!}{k!}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the greatest integer less than or equal to &lt;math&gt;n/2&lt;/math&gt;

====Divisibility====
Some of the most important functions for integer numbers have to do with divisibility:

 gcd, ifactor, mod, divisors... 

all of them well documented in help. you can view it with the '?' command.

Function ifactors takes positive integer and returns a list of pairs : prime factor and its exponent. For example :

 a:ifactors(8);
 &lt;nowiki&gt;[[2,3]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

It means that :  &lt;math&gt;8 = 2^3\,&lt;/math&gt;

====Other Functions====
Continuus fractions : 

 (%i6) cfdisrep([1,1,1,1]);
 (%o6) 1+1/(1+1/(1+1/1))
 (%i7) float(%), numer;
 (%o7) 1.666666666666667

==Complex numbers==

===Argument===
Principial value of argument of complex number in turns
carg produces results in the range (-pi, pi] .
It can be mapped to [0, 2*pi) by adding 2*pi to the negative values

 carg_t(z):=
  block(
  [t],
  t:carg(z)/(2*%pi),  /* now in turns */
  if t&lt;0 then t:t+1, /* map from (-1/2,1/2] to [0, 1) */
  return(t)
 )$
On can order list of complex points according to it's argument :
 l2_ordered: sort(l2, lambda([z1,z2], is(carg(z1) &lt; carg(z2))))$

=Functions=

For mathematical functions use always 
 define() 
instead of 
 := 

There is only one small difference between them:

&quot;The function definition operator. f(x_1, ..., x_n) := expr defines a
function named f with arguments x_1, …, x_n and function body expr. :=
'''never''' evaluates the function body (unless explicitly evaluated by
quote-quote '').&quot;

&quot;Defines a function named f with arguments x_1, …, x_n and function
body expr. define '''always''' evaluates its second argument (unless
explicitly quoted). &quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.utexas.edu/pipermail/maxima/2012/028060.html Discussion at Maxima interest list]&lt;/ref&gt;

=Data structures =
&quot;Maxima's current array/matrix semantics are a mess, I must say, with at least four different kinds of object (hasharrays, explicit lists,
explicit matrices, Lisp arrays) supporting subscripting with varying semantics. &quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.mathematics.maxima.general/21829 Maxima: Syntax improvements by Stavros Macrakis ]&lt;/ref&gt;
==Array ==
Maxima has two array types :&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.utexas.edu/pipermail/maxima/2006/004121.html  the Maxima mailing list : [Maxima&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; array and matrix? - answer by Robert Dodier]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Undeclared arrays ( implemented as Lisp hash tables )
* Declared arrays ( implemented as Lisp arrays )
** created by the array function 
** created by the make_array function.


Category: Arrays :
* array 
* arrayapply 
* arrayinfo 
* arraymake 
* arrays - global variable 
* fillarray 
* listarray 
* make_array 
* rearray 
* remarray 
* subvar 
* use_fast_arrays

See also :
* array functions defined by := and define.


=== Undeclared array ===

Assignment creates an undeclared array.

 (%i1) c[99] : 789;
 (%o1)                          789
 (%i2) c[99];
 (%o2)                          789
 (%i3) c;
 (%o3)                           c
 (%i4) arrayinfo (c);
 (%o4)                   [hashed, 1, [99]]
 (%i5) listarray (c);
 (%o5)                         [789]



&quot;If the user assigns to a subscripted variable before declaring the corresponding array, an undeclared array is created. Undeclared arrays, otherwise known as hashed arrays (because hash coding is done on the subscripts), are more general than declared arrays. The user does not declare their maximum size, and they grow dynamically by hashing as more elements are assigned values. The subscripts of undeclared arrays need not even be numbers. However, unless an array is rather sparse, it is probably more efficient to declare it when possible than to leave it undeclared. &quot; ( from Maxima CAS doc)

&quot;created if one does :

 b[x+1]:y^2 

(and b is not already an array, a list, or a matrix - if it were one of these an error would be caused since x+1 would not be a valid subscript for an art-q array, a list or a matrix).

Its indices (also known as keys) may be any object. It only takes one key at a time (b[x+1,u]:y would ignore the u). Referencing is done by b[x+1] ==&gt; y^2. Of course the key may be a list, e.g. 
&lt;pre&gt;
 b[[x+1,u]]:y 
&lt;/pre&gt;
would be valid. &quot;( from Maxima CAS doc)

===Declared array===
* declare array ( give a name and allocate memmory)
* fill array
* process array


====array function ====
 Function: array (name, type, dim_1, …, dim_n)

Creates an n-dimensional array. 
Here : 
* '''type''' can be fixnum for integers of limited size or flonum for floating-point numbers
* '''n''' may be less than or equal to 5. The subscripts for the i'th dimension are the integers running from 0 to dim_i. 

 (%i5) array(A,2,2);
 (%o5)                                  A
 (%i8) arrayinfo(A);
 (%o8)                      [declared, 2, [2,2]]

Because subscripts of array A elements are goes from 0 to dim so array A has : 
 
 ( dim_1 + 1) * (dim_2 + 1) = 3*3 = 9 

elements.



The array function can be used to transform an undeclared array into a declared array.

====arraymake function====

 Function: arraymake (A, [i_1, …, i_n])

The result is an unevaluated array reference. 

 (%i12) arraymake(A,[3,3,3]);
 (%o12)                    array_make(3, 3, 3)
                                            3, 3, 3
 (%i13) arrayinfo(A);
        arrayinfo: A is not an array.

==== Function: make_array ====

 Function: make_array (type, dim_1, …, dim_n)

Creates and returns a Lisp array. 

Type may be :
* any
* flonum
* fixnum
* hashed
* functional. 

There are n indices, and the i'th index runs from 0 to dim_i - 1.

The advantage of make_array over array is that the return value doesn't have a name, and once a pointer to it goes away, it will also go away. 
For example, if y: make_array (...) then y points to an object which takes up space, but after y: false, y no longer points to that object, so the object can be garbage collected.

Examples: 

 (%i9) A : array_make(3,3,3);
 (%o9)                         array_make(3, 3, 3)
 (%i10) arrayinfo(A);
 (%o10)                     [declared, 3, [3, 3, 3]]

==List==

Assignment to an element of a list.

 (%i1) b : [1, 2, 3];
 (%o1)                       [1, 2, 3]
 (%i2) b[3] : 456;
 (%o2)                          456
 (%i3) b;
 (%o3)                      [1, 2, 456]


 (%i1) mylist : [[a,b],[c,d]];
 (%o1) [[a, b], [c, d]]

==Matrix==
&quot;In Maxima, a matrix is implemented as a nested list (namely a list of rows of the matrix)&quot;. E.g. :&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.utexas.edu/pipermail/maxima/2006/004121.html  the Maxima mailing list : [Maxima&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; array and matrix? - answer by Robert Dodier]&lt;/ref&gt;
 (($MATRIX) ((MLIST) 1 2 3) ((MLIST) 4 5 6))

Construction of matrices from nested lists :

 (%i3) M:matrix([1,2,3],[4,5,6],[0,-1,-2]);
                                 [ 1   2    3  ]
                                 [             ]
 (%o3)                           [ 4   5    6  ]
                                 [             ]
                                 [ 0  - 1  - 2 ]


Intresting examples by Burkhard Bunk : &lt;ref&gt;[http://www-com.physik.hu-berlin.de/~bunk/kurs/maxima/maxima.html Maxima Overview by Burkhard Bunk ]&lt;/ref&gt;

 A: matrix([a, b, c], [d, e, f], [g, h, i]);     /* (3x3) matrix */
 u: matrix([x, y, z]);                           /* row vector */
 v: transpose(matrix([r, s, t]));                /* column vector */

Reference to elements etc:

 u[1,2];                 /* second element of u */
 v[2,1];                 /* second element of v */
 A[2,3];   or  A[2][3];  /* (2,3) element */
 A[2];                         /* second row of A */

 A - B;
 A * B;

Matrix operations :

=== Function: matrix ===
 Function: matrix (row_1, …, row_n)

Returns a rectangular matrix which has the rows row_1, …, row_n. Each row is a list of expressions. All rows must be the same length. 

=== . operator ===

&quot;The dot operator, for matrix (non-commutative) multiplication. When &quot;.&quot; is used in this way, spaces should be left on both sides of it, e.g. 

 A . B

This distinguishes it plainly from a decimal point in a floating point number.

The operator . represents noncommutative multiplication and scalar product. When the operands are 1-column or 1-row matrices a and b, the expression a.b is equivalent to sum (a[i]*b[i], i, 1, length(a)). If a and b are not complex, this is the scalar product, also called the inner product or dot product, of a and b. The scalar product is defined as conjugate(a).b when a and b are complex; innerproduct in the eigen package provides the complex scalar product.

When the operands are more general matrices, the product is the matrix product a and b. The number of rows of b must equal the number of columns of a, and the result has number of rows equal to the number of rows of a and number of columns equal to the number of columns of b.

To distinguish . as an arithmetic operator from the decimal point in a floating point number, it may be necessary to leave spaces on either side. For example, 5.e3 is 5000.0 but 5 . e3 is 5 times e3.

There are several flags which govern the simplification of expressions involving ., namely dot0nscsimp, dot0simp, dot1simp, dotassoc, dotconstrules, dotdistrib, dotexptsimp, dotident, and dotscrules.&quot; ( from Maxima CAS doc)

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Packing is used to place the widgets in the application.&lt;br&gt;'''

There are three types of packing.

Horizontal Box (HBox) - Horizontal row structure&lt;br&gt;
Vertical Box (VBox) - Vertical row structure&lt;br&gt;
Table/Grid (Table) - Table like structure&lt;br&gt;

'''To place the widget inside the packing :'''

1. Create the packing object

hbox = gtk.HBox()

2. Add the widget to the box call the pack_start or pack_end method of the packing object

box.pack_start(widget, expand, fill, padding)

''pack_start will start placing the widget from the start (left to right, top to bottom)&lt;br&gt;
pack_end will start placing the widget from the end (right to left, bottom to top)&lt;br&gt;''

3. Show the box and widget&lt;br&gt;

widget.show()&lt;br&gt;
box.show()&lt;br&gt;

'''The format of the packing widgets is :'''

hbox = gtk.HBox(homogeneous, spacing)&lt;br&gt;
vbox = gtk.VBox(homogeneous, spacing)&lt;br&gt;
table = gtk.Table(rows, columns, homogeneous)&lt;br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Generally remember to install Topfield software before connecting USB cable.

This is written for XP
If things go wrong then disconnect the Toppy &amp; completely uninstall Topfield Applications &amp; 
Boot up in safe mode and then use Device Manager to properly remove any/all Topfield devices.

Check you have no files named 'topfield*.*' or 'tfbulk*.*' anywhere on your system - if so delete or rename them.

Download and install just Altair from Topfield Utilities.

Put these files in a known place - TfBulk.inf &amp; TfBulk.sys. 

Reboot the PC in Safe Mode and log in as Administrator. 

Start Device Manager and page to the bottom so you can see USB devices. 

Turn on your Toppy. Plug into the USB and Windows should detect it. Folow the wizard and install the drivers from wherever you put TfBulk.inf &amp; TfBulk.sys. Hopefully these will now install successfully (though it will tell you they won't work until you reboot). 

You should now see the Toppy as a USB device in Device Manager. 

Leave the Toppy plugged in and reboot. 

Look in Device Manager - the Toppy should be there?

(It is not generaly expected to be needed to reboot the PC but as this worked for a couple of people who were having problems I have written it in here)

Also a guy in the forum reported success after problems post SP3 [http://forum.toppy.org.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?p=157476#157476 here]

''Note: Cantonese is a tonal language. Pronunciations provided below include numbers indicating tone. Tone 1 is high and level/falling; 2 is medium and rising; 3 is medium and level; 4 is low and falling; 5 is low and rising, 6 is low and level. The characters shown are Traditional Chinese characters. Pronunciation is given using Jyutping and IPA. However, non-use of the tones will not hinder comprehension for such simple phrases.''

Note: Cantonese, like most of the other Chinese languages, does not actually have words for “yes” and “no”. Translations for “yes” and “no” given above actually mean “it is” and “it is not” and can be used for questions asking for confirmation. However, for certain yes/no questions, one would normally respond with the verb or the negation of the verb. For instance, to respond to a question such as “do you want to go?” one would respond with “want” or “not want”.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Recall, the series of expressions we evaluated to find
the ''y''-value of a point on the line

    y = 5x - 3
    
given an ''x''-value:

    sway&gt; var m = 5;
    INTEGER: 5
    
    sway&gt; var x = 9;  
    INTEGER: 9
    
    sway&gt; var b = -3;
    INTEGER: -3
    
    sway&gt; var y = m * x + b;
    INTEGER: 42
    
    sway&gt; y;
    INTEGER: 42

Now, suppose we wished to find the ''y''-value corresponding to
a different ''x''-value or, worse yet, for a different ''x''-value
on a different line. All the work we did would have to be
repeated. A function is a way to encapsulate all these operations
so we can repeat them with a minimum of effort.

==Encapsulating a series of operations==

First, we will define a not too useful function that
calculates ''y'' give a slope of 5,
a ''y''-intercept of -3, and an
''x''-value of 9 (exactly
as above). We do this by wrapping a function around
the sequence of operations above.
The return value of a function is the value of the
last thing evaluated.

    function y()
        {
        var m = 5;
        var x = 9;
        var b = -3;
        m * x + b;   //this quantity is returned
        }

There are a few things to note. The keyword function indicates
that a function definition is occurring. The name of this
particular function is ''y''. The stuff between the curly braces
is the code that will be evaluated (or executed) when the
function is called. This code is not evaluated until then.

You can copy and paste this function into the Sway interpreter.
If you do, you'll see something like:

    sway&gt; function y()
    more&gt;    {
    more&gt;    var m = 5;
    more&gt;    var x = 9;
    more&gt;    var b = -3;
    more&gt;    m * x + b;   //this quantity is returned
    more&gt;    }
    FUNCTION: &lt;function y()&gt;

Notice that the interpreter prompt changes to &lt;tt&gt;more&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; when
the input is incomplete. In the case of the function definition
above, that occurs when the curly close brace is entered&lt;ref&gt;
Typing a long construct into the interpreter is tedious.
In a later chapter,
we will learn how to store our code in a file and have
the interpreter execute the code in that file. If we need to
make changes to our code, we simply ''edit'' the file. That
way, we do not need to type in the modified code into the
interpreter from scratch.
&lt;/ref&gt;.

Once the function is defined, we can find the value of ''y'' repeatedly:

    sway&gt; y();
    INTEGER: 42
    
    sway&gt; y();
    INTEGER: 42

The parentheses after the ''y'' indicate that we wish to call
the ''y'' function and get its value.

The ''y'' function, as written,
is not too useful in that we cannot use it to compute
similar things, such as the ''y''-value for a different value of
''x''. But before we improve our function,
let's modify it so that it displays the current environment&lt;ref&gt;
Sway lets you redefine variables and functions.
&lt;/ref&gt;.
This may help you to understand what happens in a function call.
while the body of the function is executing:

    function y()
        {
        var m = 5;
        var x = 9;
        var b = -3;

        pp(this);

        m * x + b; //this quantity is returned
        }

When we call the new version of ''y'', we see its current environment,
which has bindings for ''b'', ''x'', and ''m''.

    sway&gt; y();
    &lt;OBJECT 2566&gt;:
        context: &lt;OBJECT 749&gt;
        dynamicContext: &lt;OBJECT 749&gt;
        callDepth: 1
        constructor: &lt;function y()&gt;
        this: &lt;OBJECT 2566&gt;
        b: -3
        x: 9
        m: 5
    INTEGER: 42

The variables ''b'', ''x'', and ''m'' are known as ''local variables'' since
they are not directly visible outside the neighborhood of the function
body.

==Passing arguments==

A hallmark of a good function is that it lets you compute
more than one thing. We can modify our function to ''take in'' the
value of ''x'' in which we are interested.
In this way,
we can compute more than one value of ''y''.
We do this by ''passing'' in 
an ''argument'', in this case, the value of ''x''.

    function y(x)
        {
        var slope = 5;
        var intercept = -3;
        return slope * x + intercept;
        }

We give names to the values being passed in by placing variable
names between the function definition parentheses.
In this case, we chose ''x'' as the name.
Notice that since we are passing in ''x'', we no longer need (or want)
the definition of ''x'', so we delete it.
Now we can compute ''y'' for an infinite number of ''x'''s:

    sway&gt; y(9);
    INTEGER: 42
    
    sway&gt; y(0);
    INTEGER: -3
    
    sway&gt; y(-2);
    INTEGER: -13

What if we wish to
compute a ''y''-value for a given ''x'' for a different
line? One approach would be to pass in the ''slope'' and ''intercept''
as well as ''x'':

    function y(x,slope,intercept)
       {
       return slope * x + intercept;
       }
    
    sway&gt; y(9,5,-3);
    INTEGER: 42
     
    sway&gt; y(0,5,-3);
    INTEGER: -3

If we wish to calculate using a different line, we just pass in the
new ''slope'' and ''intercept'' along with our value of ''x''.
This certainly works as intended, but is not the best way. One problem
is that we keep on having to type in the slope and intercept even if
we are computing ''y''-values on the same line. Anytime you
find yourself doing the same tedious thing over and over,
be assured that
someone has thought of a way to avoid that particular tedium.
So assuming that is true, how do we
customize our function so that we only have to enter the slope
and intercept once per particular line? We will explore
three different ways for doing this. In reading further,
it is not important if you understand all that is going on.
What is important is that you know other approaches exist
and understand the pros and cons of each approach:

==Creating functions on the fly==

Since creating functions is hard work (lots of typing) and
Computer Scientists avoid hard work like the plague, somebody
early on got the idea of writing a function that itself 
creates functions! Brilliant! We can do this for our line problem.
We will tell our creative function to create a ''y'' function
for a particular slope and intercept! While we are at it,
let's change the variable names ''m'' and ''b'' to ''slope''
and ''intercept'', respectively:

    function makeLine(slope,intercept)
        {
        function y(x)
            {
            slope * x + intercept;
            }
        y;
        }

The ''makeLine'' function creates a local ''y'' function
and then returns it. This next version is equivalent:

    function makeLine(slope,intercept)
        {
        function y(x)
            {
            slope * x + intercept;
            }
        }

Since the last thing ''makeLine'' does is to define the ''y''
function, the ''y'' function is returned by a call to
''makeLine''.

So our creative function simply defines a ''y'' function and then
returns it. Now we can create a bunch of different lines:

    sway&gt; var a = makeLine(5,-3);
    FUNCTION: &lt;function y(x)&gt;
    
    sway&gt; var b = makeLine(6,2);
    FUNCTION: &lt;function y(x)&gt;
    
    sway&gt; a(9);
    INTEGER: 42
    
    sway&gt; b(9);
    INTEGER: 56

Notice how lines ''a'' and ''b'' remember
the slope and intercept supplied
when they were created&lt;ref&gt;
The local function ''y'' has, as its context, the local environment
of the ''makeLine'' function. This environment
holds the bindings for ''slope'' and ''intercept''.
&lt;/ref&gt;.
While this is decidedly cool, the problem is many languages (C and Java
included) do not allow you to define functions that create other functions.
Fortunately, Sway does allow this.

==Using objects==

Another approach to our line problem is
to use something called an object.
In Sway,
an object is simply an environment and we have seen those 
before.
So there is nothing new here except in how to use objects
to achieve our goal.
Here, we define a function
that creates and returns a line object.
A function that creates and returns an object is
known as a ''constructor''.

    function line(slope,intercept)
        {
        this;
        }

The ''this'' variable always points to the current environment,
which in this case includes the bindings
of the formal parameters ''slope'' and ''intercept''.
By returning ''this'',
we return the environment of ''line'',
and we can look up the values of
''slope'' and ''intercept'' at our leisure.
To prove that slope and intercept
exist, we can use the built-in pretty printing function,
''pp'':

    sway&gt; m = line(5,-3);
    OBJECT: &lt;OBJECT 231&gt;
    
    sway&gt; pp(m);
    &lt;OBJECT 231&gt;:
        context : &lt;object 145&gt;
        dynamicContext: &lt;object 145&gt;
        constructor: &lt;function line(slope,intercept)&gt;
        this: &lt;object 231&gt;
        intercept: -3
        slope : 5
    OBJECT: &lt;OBJECT 231&gt;

We access the variables in an object with the '.' (dot) operator:

    sway&gt; m . slope;
    INTEGER: -3
    
    sway&gt; m . constructor;
    FUNCTION: &lt;function line(slope,intercept)&gt;

Now we modify our ''y'' function to take in a line object as
well as ''x'' and use the dot operator to extract the line's slope
and intercept:

    function y(line,x)
        {
        line . slope * x + line . intercept;
        }

In this scenario, we create different lines, then pass each
line to our new ''y'' function:

    sway&gt; var m = line(5,-3);
    OBJECT: &lt;object 231&gt;
    
    sway&gt; var n = line(6,2);
    OBJECT: &lt;object 256&gt;
    
    sway&gt; y(m,9);
    INTEGER: 42
    
    sway&gt; y(n,9);
    INTEGER: 56

The problem with this approach is we have separated line objects from
finding ''y'' values, yet these two concepts are closely related. As
an example, suppose we have parabola objects as well as line objects.
Our ''y'' function would fail miserably for parabola objects
even though the concept of (x,y) points on a parabola is just as
valid as points on a line&lt;ref&gt;
Here is a concrete example of trying to ''generalize'', so that
our function works for all objects for which the concept of
the function is valid.
&lt;/ref&gt;.

In the
object-oriented world, we solve this problem by
bundling the object and functions that work specifically on
that object together. In our case,
we 
make the ''y'' function part of the line object:

    function line(slope,intercept)
        {
        function y(x)
            {
            slope * x + intercept;
            }
        this;
        }

This is very similar to the functions-on-the-fly approach, but we
return ''this'' instead of the function bound to ''y''.
Now we call the ''y'' function
via the line object.

    sway&gt; var m = line(5,-3);
    OBJECT: &lt;object 231&gt;
    
    sway&gt; var n = line(6,2);
    OBJECT: &lt;object 256&gt;
    
    sway&gt; m . y(9);
    INTEGER: 42
    
    sway&gt; n . y(9);
    INTEGER: 56

Should we have a parabola object,
it would have its own ''y'' function
with a different implementation.
We would call it just the same, however:

    sway&gt; var p = parabola(2,0,0);
    OBJECT: &lt;object 453&gt;

    sway&gt; p . y(7);
    INTEGER: 49

This approach is supported in object oriented languages such as Java.
The earlier approach (where the function was separated from the object)
is supported in procedural languages such as C.

== Functions versus operator ==

All operators are functions and can be called using operator
syntax. For example, the following expressions both sum the
values of ''a'' and ''b'':

    var sum = a + b;
    var sum = +(a,b);

Conversely, any function of two arguments can be called using operator
syntax.
Sometimes using operator syntax makes your code more clear.
Let's make a function that increments a variable by a given amount,
similar to the C, C++, and Java operator of the same name:

    function +=($v,amount)
        {
        $v = force($v) + amount;
        }

Don't worry about how the code works; just note that
the &lt;tt&gt;+=&lt;/tt&gt; function has two formal parameters (''$v''
and ''amount'') and thus takes two arguments.  We can
call &lt;tt&gt;+=&lt;/tt&gt;  to increment a variable using function
call syntax:

     var x = 2;
     +=(x,1);
     inspect(x);

or we can use operator
syntax:

    var x = 2;
    x += 1;
    inspect(x);

In both cases, the output of the code fragments is the same:

    x is 3

Functions that are called using operator syntax have the
same precedence level as the mathematical operators and
are left associative.

      <text xml:space="preserve">We have already seen some examples of functions,
some user-defined and some built-in.
For example, we have used the built-in functions,
such as 
&lt;tt&gt;*&lt;/tt&gt;.
In reality, &lt;tt&gt;*&lt;/tt&gt; is not a function but a variable
that is bound to the function that multiplies two numbers
together, but it is tedious to say 'the function bound to
&lt;tt&gt;*&lt;/tt&gt;' so we say the more concise (but technically incorrect)
phrase 'the &lt;tt&gt;*&lt;/tt&gt; function'.

==Predefined Functions==

Sway has many predefined functions. You can
see the list of built-in functions by executing the command

    sway -p

at the system prompt
(don't confuse the system prompt with the Sway interpreter prompt).
More detail on the built-in functions is given in the
last chapter.
No one, however,
can anticipate all possible tasks that someone might want to perform,
so most programming languages allow the user to define new functions.
Sway is no exception and provides
for the creation of new and novel functions.
Of course,
to be useful,
these functions should be able to call
built-in functions as well as other programmer created
functions.

For example, a function that determines whether a given
number is odd or even is not built into Sway but can be
quite useful in certain situations.
Here is a definition
of a function named ''even''? which returns true if the
given number is even, false otherwise:

    sway&gt; function even?(x) { return x % 2 == 0; }
    FUNCTION: &lt;function even?(x)&gt;
     
    sway&gt; even?;
    FUNCTION: &lt;function even?(x)&gt;
     
    sway&gt; even?(4);
    SYMBOL: :true
     
    sway&gt; even?(5);
    SYMBOL: :false
     
    sway&gt; even?(4 + 5);
    SYMBOL: :false

We could talk for days about what's going on in these
interactions with the interpreter. First, let's talk
about the syntax of a function definition. Later, we'll
talk about the purpose of a function definition. Finally,
will talk about the mechanics of a function definition
and a function call.

==Function syntax==

Recall that the words of a programming language include its
primitives, keywords and variables. A function definition
corresponds to a sentence in the language in that it is
built up from the words of the language. And like human
languages, the sentences must follow a certain form. This
specification of the form of a sentence is known as its
''syntax''. Computer Scientists often use a special way
of describing syntax of a programming language called the
Backus-Naur form (or BNF). Here is a high-level description
of the syntax of a Sway function definition using BNF:

    functionDefinition :
        'function' variable '(' optionalParameterList ')' block
    
    optionalParameterList : &lt;math&gt;\Epsilon&lt;/math&gt;
                          | parameterList
    
    parameterList : variable
                  | variable ',' parameterList
    
    block: '{' definitionSequence statementSequence '}'

The first BNF ''rule'' says that a function definition begins
with the keyword ''function'' (parts of the rule that appear
verbatim appear within single quotes), followed by a variable,
followed by an open parenthesis, followed by something
called an ''optionalParameterList'', followed by a close
parenthesis, followed by something called a ''block''.
By reading the remaining rules, 
we see that
one defines a function by
entering the keyword ''function'' followed by
the name of the function, followed by a parenthesized
list of formal parameters
(possibly empty, as indicated by &lt;math&gt;\Epsilon&lt;/math&gt;),
followed
by the body of the function. The body is a brace-enclosed
list of definitions, then statements
(the block that follows the parameter list is often
called the ''function body'').

The parameter list
is composed of zero or more variable names, separated by
commas. Parameters are local variables that will be bound
to the values given in the call to the function.
In the particular case of ''even''?,
the variable ''x'' will be bound to the number whose
eveness is to be determined. It is customary to call ''x''
a ''formal parameter'' of the function ''even''?.
In function calls, the values to be bound to the
formal parameters are called ''arguments''.

==Function Objects==

Let's look at the body of ''even''?.
The % operator is bound to the remainder or modulus
function. The == operator is bound to the equality function
and determines whether the value of the left operand
expression is equal to the value of the right operand
expression, yielding true or false as appropriate. The
value produced by == is then immediately returned as the
value of the function.

When given a function definition like that above, Sway
performs a couple of tasks. The first is to create the
internal form of the function, known as a function object,
which holds the function's name, parameter list, and body,
plus the current environment. The second task is to add
the function name and the function object to the current
environment as a variable-value binding. Thus the name
of the function is simply a variable that happens to be
bound to a function object. As noted before, we often say
'the function ''even''?' even though we really mean 'the
function bound to the variable ''even''?'.

The value of a function definition is the
function object, which has type FUNCTION (indicating a
user of Sway has defined the function) and a printable
value of &lt;function definitionName formalParameters&gt;,
where ''definitionName'' is the name of the function when
created and ''formalParameters'' is the parenthesized list
of parameters. Although the print value of the function
object only lists the original name and the parameters,
the actual object contains the body and context in which
it was created (known as the defining environment) as well.

We can see the actual components of a function object
by passing the function object to the built-in ''ppObject''
function. The ''pp'' in ''ppObject'' stands for
''pretty printing'' which means to display in a pleasing
format.

    sway&gt; ppObject(even?);
    &lt;FUNCTION 2421&gt;:
        context: &lt;OBJECT 749&gt;
        prior: :null
        filter: :null
        parameters: (x)
        code: { return x % 2 == 0; }
        name: even?
    FUNCTION: &lt;function even?(x)&gt;

In addition to some other fields we will learn about later,
we see that the ''parameters'', ''code'', and ''name'' fields look
as expected. The only unexpected item is that the code contains
a ''return'' where it did not before. You will learn more
about returns in a later chapter. For now, we'll just
say that returns allow you to return
a value from somewhere other than the last expression in the
function body.

While we are on the subject of prettying printing, we can also
look at ''even''? with the ''pp'' function:

    sway&gt; pp(even?)
    function even?(x)
        {
        return x % 2 == 0;
        }
    FUNCTION: &lt;function even?(x)&gt;

==Calling Functions==

Once a function is created,
it is used by ''calling'' the
function with ''arguments''.
A function is called by supplying
the name of the function followed by a parenthesized,
comma separated, list of expressions.
The arguments are
the values of those expressions and are to be bound to the
formal parameters.
In general, if there are ''n'' formal parameters,
there should be ''n'' arguments&lt;ref&gt;
For ''variadic'' functions, the number of arguments
may be more than the number of formal parameters.
&lt;/ref&gt;.
Furthermore, the value of the
first argument is bound to the first formal parameter, the
second argument is bound to the second formal parameter,
and so on. Moreover, the arguments are usually evaluated
before being bound to the parameters&lt;ref&gt;
It is possible to delay evaluation of arguments. See
the chapter of Lazy Evaluation for more details.
&lt;/ref&gt;.

Once the evaluated arguments are bound to the parameters,
then the body of the function is evaluated. Most times,
the expressions in the body of the function will reference
the parameters. If so, how does the interpreter find the
values of those parameters? That question is answered in
the next section.

==Scope==

The formal parameters of a function can be thought of
as variable definitions that are only in effect when
the body of the function is being evaluated. That is,
those variables are only visible in the body and no where
else. For that reason, parameters are considered to be
local variable definitions, since they only have local
effect (the function body). Any direct reference to those
particular variables outside the body of the function
is not allowed.&lt;ref&gt;
One can sometimes get to these variables indirectly, in
the case of [[../Objects|objects]].
&lt;/ref&gt;
Consider the following interaction with
the interpreter:

    sway&gt; function square(a) { return a * a; }
    FUNCTION: &lt;function square(a)&gt;
     
    sway&gt; square(4);
    INTEGER: 16
     
    sway&gt; a;
    EVALUATION ERROR: :undefinedVariable
    variable a is undefined
        stdin,line 3: a;

Scope refers to where a variable is visible.

In the above example, the scope of variable ''a'' is restricted
to the body of the function ''square''.
Any reference to
''a'' other than in the context of ''square'' is invalid. Now
consider a slightly different interaction with the
interpreter:

    sway&gt; var a = 10;
    INTEGER: 10
     
    sway&gt; var b = 1;
    INTEGER: 1
     
    sway&gt; function almostSquare(a) { return a * a + b; }
    FUNCTION: &lt;function almostSquare(a)&gt;
     
    sway&gt; almostSquare(4);
    INTEGER: 17

In this dialog, two variable definitions, ''a'' and
''b'', precede the definition of ''almostSquare''.
In addition, the variable serving as the formal parameter
of ''almostSquare'' has the same name as the first variable
defined in the dialog. Moreover, the body of ''almostSquare''
refers to both variables a and b. Variable ''a'' is defined
twice (once as a regular variable and once as a formal
parameter) while variable ''b'' is referenced but is not a
formal parameter. Although it seems confusing at first,
the Sway interpreter has no difficulty in figuring out
what's what. From the responses of the interpreter,
the ''b'' in the body must refer to the variable that was
defined with an initial value of 1 (since there it is
the only ''b''). The ''a'' in the function body must refer to the
formal parameter whose value was set to 4 by the call to
the function (given the output of the interpreter).

When a formal parameter (or any definition
local to a function) has the same name as another variable
that is also in scope, the formal parameter is said to
''shadow'' the the other. The term shadowed refers to the fact
that the other variable is in the shadow of the formal
parameter and cannot be seen. A variable is said to be in
scope if it is bound in the current environment or in the
environment bound to the context variable in the current
environment. We can see this clearly in Sway by looking
at bindings. Consider this dialog:

    sway&gt; var a = 10;
    INTEGER: 10
     
    sway&gt; var b = 1;
    INTEGER: 1
     
    sway&gt; function almostSquare(a) { pp(this); a * a + b; }
    FUNCTION: &lt;function almostSquare(a)&gt;

Note that in the body of this version of ''almostSquare'',
we pretty print the current environment.
     
    sway&gt; almostSquare(4);
    &lt;OBJECT 2569&gt;:
        context: &lt;OBJECT 749&gt;
        dynamicContext: &lt;OBJECT 749&gt;
        callDepth: 1
        constructor: &lt;function almostSquare(a)&gt;
        this: &lt;OBJECT 2569&gt;
        a: 4
    INTEGER: 17

It is in this current environment that the value of ''a'' is retrieved
in calculating the return value. We see that, indeed, ''a'' has
a value of 4. But where is the value of ''b'' found?

When the value of a variable is needed, Sway looks in the current
environment (''this''). If the variable is not found there,
Sway looks in ''context''. If the variable is not in ''context'',
it looks in the ''context'' of ''context'', and so on.
Let's modify ''almostSquare'' to illustrate:

    sway&gt; function almostSquare(a) { pp(this); pp(context); a * a + b; }
    FUNCTION: &lt;function almostSquare(a)&gt;

This latest version pretty prints both its current environment
and its context:

    sway&gt; almostSquare(4);
    &lt;OBJECT 2603&gt;:
        context: &lt;OBJECT 749&gt;
        dynamicContext: &lt;OBJECT 749&gt;
        callDepth: 1
        constructor: &lt;function almostSquare(a)&gt;
        this: &lt;OBJECT 2603&gt;
        a: 4
    &lt;OBJECT 749&gt;:
        context: &lt;OBJECT 18&gt;
        dynamicContext: :null
        callDepth: 0
        constructor: :null
        this: &lt;OBJECT 749&gt;
        almostSquare: &lt;function almostSquare(a)&gt;
        b: 1
        a: 10
        SwayEnv: [&quot;SSH_AGENT_PID=5076&quot;,&quot;SHELL=/bin/bash&quot;,&quot;TERM=x...
        SwayArgs: :null
    INTEGER: 17

Here we see the bindings of ''a'', ''b'', and ''almostSquare'', as
expected. 

This shows two things:

# that within the function body, formal parameters are found in the current environment
# that the context of the environment active in a function call is bound to the defining environment of the function.

When a reference to ''a'' is made, a search is made of the
current environment. Within the function body, the value
of 4 is immediately found. When the value of ''b'' is required,
it is not found in the current environment. The interpreter
then searches the current environment's context (in this
case &lt;OBJECT 1616&gt;). This object does has a binding for ''b''.

Since ''a'' has a value of 4 and ''b'' has a value of 1, the
value of 17 is returned by the function. Finally, the
last interaction with the interpreter illustrates the
fact that the initial binding of a was unaffected by the
function call.

In general, a variable found in the current environment
is considered local. A variable that is in scope
but is not in the current environment is considered
non-local. Alternatively, local variables are considered
to reside in the local scope while non-local variables are
said to reside in the non-local scope. Local and non-local
scope are sometimes referred to as inner and outer scope,
respectively. If a non-local variable resides in the
outermost scope, it is considered a global variable and
the environment holding the bindings of global variables
is called the global environment. In Sway, the initial
environment is the global environment. Contrary to the
definition above, Sway's global environment does have has
an outer scope; this outer scope holds the bindings of
the built-in functions. The built-in environment cannot
be modified so perhaps a better definition of the global
environment is the outermost environment which can be
modified by the programmer.

How did the environment &lt;OBJECT 1845&gt;, the environment
under which the function body was executed, come into
being? The evaluation of the expression almostSquare(4)
triggers a number of actions. The first is the creation
of a new environment that will hold the formal parameters
of the function to be called (in this case, the single
parameter a) bound to the values of the corresponding
arguments in the call (in this case, the single
argument has a value of 4). This new environment has
its context variable bound to context variable found in
the function object associated with the function being
called (this new environment is also populated with other
pre-defined variables such as constructor). The body of
the function being called is then executed under this new
environment. The process of creating a new environment and
linking its context to another environment via its context
variable is called extending an environment. To summarize,
when a function call is performed, the following actions
are performed:

*the arguments to the function call are evaluated under the current environment
*the function object associated with the function to be called is retrieved from the current environment 
*the formal parameters are retrieved from the function object
*the defining environment is retrieved from the function object
*a new environment is extended from the defining environment
*the new environment is populated by binding the formal parameters to the evaluated arguments 
*the function body is retrieved from the function object 
*the function body is evaluated under the newly extended environment 
*the result of this evaluation is returned as the result of the function call 

There are two important concepts about function calls:
the static chain and the dynamic chain. The static chain
we have already seen, the current environment, the context
of the current environment, the context of the context,
and so on. It is this chain that is searched for the value
of a referenced variable. The dynamic chain, on the other
hand, is the current environment, the environment of the
calling function, the environment of the caller of the
calling function, and so on. Unlike most languages, the
dynamic chain is available for programmers to search and
manipulate. For the moment, that kind of manipulation is
beyond us, so we will postpone that topic to a later date.

== Returning from functions ==

The return value of a function is the value of the last expression
evaluated when executing the function body.
The ''return'' function is used to make an expression anywhere
in the function be the last expression evaluated.

    function test(x,y)
        {
        if (y == 0)
            {
            return(0);
            }
        println(&quot;good value for y!&quot;);
        return (x / y);
        }

In the example, if y is zero, then there is
an immediate return from the function and
no other expressions in the function body are evaluated.
If not,
a message is printed and the 
a quotient is returned.
The final return is not really needed; just having
&lt;tt&gt;x / y&lt;/tt&gt; as the final expression would work
as well.

To make Sway, which is a functional language, look like C and Java,
a call to the ''return'' function has
an alternate syntax, the parentheses enclosing the single
argument can be omitted:

    function test(x,y)
        {
        if (y == 0) { return 0; }
        println(&quot;good value for y!&quot;);
        x / y;
        }

      <text xml:space="preserve">Many functional languages feature ''delayed'' (or ''lazy'') evaluation of 
function arguments, Unlike applicative order evaluation (used by C and Java),
where function arguments are evaluated before they are bound to formal
parameters, lazy evaluation delays evaluation until the actual values are
needed. This is accomplished by passing the argument as a ''thunk'', which
is a data structure containing the actual expression forming the argument
and the environment in which the argument would have been evaluated under
applicative order.

Sway allows the programmer to decide whether or not lazy evaluation 
should be used. To signify lazy evaluation, the formal parameter is
named starting with a dollar sign ($). When the actual value of the
argument is needed, the force function is used to evaluate the 
argument expression in the thunk. Here is an example:

&lt;code&gt;
    function f($x)
        {
        println(&quot;about to force...&quot;);
        force($x);
        }
    f(println(&quot;hello&quot;));
&lt;/code&gt;

When this code is executed, we get the output:

&lt;code&gt;
    about to force...
    hello
&lt;/code&gt;

Contrast this with the output of the following code, where the
formal parameter is named normally:

&lt;code&gt;
    function f(x)
        {
        println(&quot;about to force...&quot;);
        force(x);
        }
    f(println(&quot;hello&quot;));
&lt;/code&gt;

When this new code is executed, we get the output:

&lt;code&gt;
    hello
    about to force...
&lt;/code&gt;

This is because the println must be evaluated before its
result is bound to the formal parameter ''x''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:TransportationInputsOutputs.png|thumb|500px|Transportation inputs and outputs]]
Transportation moves people and goods from one place to another using a variety of vehicles across different infrastructure systems. It does this using not only technology (namely vehicles, energy, and infrastructure), but also people’s time and eﬀort; producing not only the desired outputs of passenger trips and freight shipments, but also adverse outcomes such as air pollution, noise, congestion, crashes, injuries, and fatalities. 

Figure 1 illustrates the inputs, outputs, and outcomes of transportation. In the upper left are traditional inputs (infrastructure (including pavements, bridges, etc.), labor required to produce transportation, land consumed by infrastructure, energy inputs, and vehicles). Infrastructure is the traditional preserve of civil engineering, while vehicles are anchored in mechanical engineering. Energy, to the extent it is powering existing vehicles is a mechanical engineering question, but the design of systems to reduce or minimize energy consumption require thinking beyond traditional disciplinary boundaries. 

On the top of the ﬁgure are Information, Operations, and Management, and Travelers’ Time and Eﬀort. Transportation systems serve people, and are created by people, both the system owners and operators, who run, manage, and maintain the system and travelers who use it. Travelers’ time depends both on freeﬂow time, which is a product of the infrastructure design and on delay due to congestion, which is an interaction of system capacity and its use. On the upper right side of the ﬁgure are the adverse outcomes of transportation, in particular its negative externalities: 
* by polluting, systems consume health and increase morbidity and mortality; 
* by being dangerous, they consume safety and produce injuries and fatalities; 
* by being loud they consume quiet and produce noise (decreasing quality of life and property values); and 
* by emitting carbon and other pollutants, they harm the environment. 

All of these factors are increasingly being recognized as costs of transportation, but the most notable are the environmental eﬀects, particularly with concerns about global climate change. The bottom of the ﬁgure shows the outputs of transportation. Transportation is central to economic activity and to people’s lives, it enables them to engage in work, attend school, shop for food and other goods, and participate in all of the activities that comprise human existence. More transportation, by increasing accessibility to more destinations, enables people to better meet their personal objectives, but entails higher costs both individually and socially. While the “transportation problem” is often posed in terms of congestion, that delay is but one cost of a system that has many costs and even more benefits. Further, by changing accessibility, transportation gives shape to the development of land.

== Modalism and Intermodalism ==

Transportation is often divided into infrastructure modes: e.g. highway, rail, water, pipeline and air. 
These can be further divided. Highways include different vehicle types: cars, buses, trucks, motorcycles, bicycles, and pedestrians. 
Transportation can be further separated into freight and passenger, and urban and inter-city. 
Passenger transportation is divided in public (or mass) transit (bus, rail, commercial air) and private transportation (car, taxi, general aviation). 

These modes of course intersect and interconnect. 
At-grade crossings of railroads and highways, inter-modal transfer facilities (ports, airports, terminals, stations). 

Different combinations of modes are often used on the same trip. I may walk to my car, drive to a parking lot, walk to a shuttle bus, ride the shuttle bus to a stop near my building, and walk into the building where I take an elevator. 

Transportation is usually considered to be between buildings (or from one address to another), although many of the same concepts apply within buildings. The operations of an elevator and bus have a lot in common, as do a forklift in a warehouse and a crane at a port.

== Motivation ==

Transportation engineering is usually taken by undergraduate Civil Engineering students. Not all aim to become transportation professionals, though some do. Loosely, students in this course may consider themselves in one of two categories: Students who intend to specialize in transportation (or are considering it), and students who don't. The remainder of civil engineering often divides into two groups: &quot;Wet&quot; and &quot;Dry&quot;. Wets include those studying water resources, hydrology, and environmental engineering, Drys are those involved in structures and geotechnical engineering.

=== Transportation students ===

Transportation students have an obvious motivation in the course above and beyond the fact that it is required for graduation. Transportation Engineering is a pre-requisite to further study of Highway Design, Traffic Engineering, Transportation Policy and Planning, and Transportation Materials. It is our hope, that by the end of the semester, many of you will consider yourselves Transportation Students. However not all will.

=== &quot;Wet Students&quot; ===

''I am studying Environmental Engineering or Water Resources, why should I care about Transportation Engineering?''

Transportation systems have major environmental impacts (air, land, water), both in their construction and utilization.
By understanding how transportation systems are designed and operate, those impacts can be measured, managed, and mitigated.

=== &quot;Dry Students&quot; ===

''I am studying Structures or Geomechanics, why should I care about Transportation Engineering?''

Transportation systems are huge structures of themselves, with very specialized needs and constraints. 
Only by understanding the systems can the structures (bridges, footings, pavements) be properly designed. Vehicle traffic is the dynamic structural load on these structures.

=== Citizens and Taxpayers ===

Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems.  Almost everyone complains about transportation systems. In developed countries you seldom hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or bridges falling down. Why do transportation systems engender such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers just incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?

By understanding the systems as citizens, you can work toward their improvement. Or at least you can entertain your friends at parties.

== Goal ==

It is often said that the goal of Transportation Engineering is &quot;The Safe and Efficient Movement of People and Goods.&quot;

But that goal (safe and efficient movement of people and goods) doesn’t answer: 

Who, What, When, Where, How, Why?

      <text xml:space="preserve">''All forecasts are wrong; some forecasts are more wrong than others.'' - anonymous

'''Modeling''' is a means for representing reality in an abstracted way. Your mental models are your '''world view''': your outlook on life, and the world. The world view is your ''internal model of how the world works''; it is employed every time you make a prediction: what do you expect, what is a surprise. The expression “Where you stand depends on where you sit” epitomizes this idea. Your world view is shaped by your experience and your position.

When modeling, the issue of  '''Point of View''' should be considered. It must be clear who (and what) the results are  for. If you are modeling for personal pleasure, it will naturally reflect your own worldview, but if you are working for an employer or client, their point of view must also be considered, if the inputs or results deviate significantly from their worldview, they may adapt their worldview, but more likely will dismiss the model.

Modeling can be conducted both for subjective '''advocacy''' and for objective '''analysis'''.  The same methods may be employed in either, and the ethical modeler will produce the same results in either case, but they may be used differently.


== Why Model? ==

There are a variety of reasons to model. Modeling helps 
* gain insight into complex situations by understanding simpler situations resembling them
* optimize the use of resources in building or maintaining systems
* operate system, particularly by testing alternative operational scenarios
* educate and provide experience for model-builders 
* provide a platform for testing contending ideas and use in negotiations.

Particular applications in transportation include: 
* Forecasting traffic
* Testing scenarios (alternative land uses, networks, policies)
* Planning projects/corridor studies
* Regulating land use: Growth management/public facility adequacy
* Managing complexity, when eyeballs are insufficient, (different people have different intuitions)
* Understanding travel behavior
* Influencing decisions
* Estimating traffic in the absence of data

== Developing Models ==

As an engineer, economist, or planner you may be given a model to use. But that model was not spontaneously generated, it came from other engineers, economists, or planners who undertook a series of steps to translate raw data into a tool that could be used to generate useful information.

The first step, specification, tells us what depends on what (the number of trips leaving a zone may depend on the number of households). The estimation step tells us how strong these relationships mathematically are, (each household generates two trips in the peak hour). Implementation takes those relationships and puts them into a computer program. Calibration looks at the output of the computer program and compares it to other data, if they don't match exactly, adjustments to the models may be made. Validation compares the results to data at another point in time. Finally the model is applied to look at a project (e.g. how much traffic will use Granary Road after Washington Avenue is closed to traffic).

* Specification: 
** &lt;math&gt;y=f(X)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
* Estimation:
** &lt;math&gt;y=mX+b\,\!&lt;/math&gt;; m=1, b=2
* Implementation
** If Z &gt; W, Then &lt;math&gt;y=mX+b\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
* Calibration	
** &lt;math&gt;y_{predicted}+k=y_{observed}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
* Validation
** &lt;math&gt;y_{predicted1990}+k=y_{observed1990}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
* Application

== Specification ==

When building a model system, numerous decisions must be made. These are discussed below:

=== Types of Models ===
There are numerous types of models, a short list is below. Each has different applicability, multiple methods may be used in pursuit of the same question, sometimes they are complementary, and sometimes competitive techniques.

* Network analysis
* Linear Programming
* Nonlinear Programming
* Simulation
* Deterministic queuing
* Probabilistic queuing
* Regression
* Neural Nets
* Genetic Algorithm
* Cost/ Benefit Analysis
* Life-cycle costing
* System Dynamics 
* Control Theory
* Difference Equations
* Differential Equations
* Probabilistic Risk Assessment
* Supply/Demand Equilibrium
* Game Theory
* Statistical Decision Theory
* Markov Models
* Cellular Automata
* Etc.

=== Model Trade-offs ===
Building a model requires trading-off time and resource constraints. One could always be more detailed, more accurate, or more comprehensive if resources were not constrained. However, the following must also be considered.
* Money, 
* Data, 
* Computation, 
* Labor, 
* Ease of Use, 
* Convincing (e.g. Graphic Displays), 
* Extendable, 
* Evidence of Model Benefits, 
* Measuring Model Success



=== Organization of Model System ===
* Hierarchy of Models
* Centralized vs. Decentralized (Optimization (Global) vs. Agent, Local Optimization)

=== Time ===
* Time Frame
* Static vs. Dynamic
* Real Time vs. Offline
* Short Term vs. Long Term (Partial vs. General Equilibrium)
* Proactive vs. Reactive (Predictive vs. Responsive)

=== Space ===
* Scale/Detail
* Spatial Extent
* Boundaries (Boundary Effects)
* Macroscopic vs. Microscopic (Zones, Flows vs. Individuals, Vehicles)

=== Process ===
* Stochastic vs. Deterministic
* Linear vs. Nonlinear
* Continuous vs. Discrete 
* Numerical Simulation vs. Closed Form Solution
* Equilibrium vs. Disequilibrium

=== Type ===
* Behavioral vs. Aggregate Model
* Physical vs. Mathematical Models

== Solution Techniques==

When solving the model, the system as a whole must be understood. Several questions arise:

* Does the solution exist? 
* Is the solution unique?  
* Is the solution feasible?

Solution techniques often trade-off accuracy vs. speed. Some solution techniques may only guarantee a local optima, while others (such as brute force techniques) can guarantee a global optimum, but may be much slower.

== “Four-Step” Urban Transportation Planning Models == 

We want to answer a number of related questions (who, what, where, when, why, and how):
* Who is traveling or what is being shipped?
* Where are the origin and destination of those trips, shipments?
* When do those trips begin and end (how long do they take, how far away are the trip ends)?
* Why are the trips being made, what is their purpose?
* How are the trips getting there, what routes or modes are they taking?

If we know the answers to those questions, we want to know what are the answers to those questions a function of? 
* Cost: Money, Time spent on the trip, 
* Cost: Money and Time of alternatives.
* Benefit (utility) of trip (e.g. the activity at the destination)
* Benefit of alternatives

The reason for this is to understand what will happen under various circumstances:
* How much “induced demand” will be generated if a roadway is expanded?
* How many passengers will be lost if bus services are cut back?
* How many people will be “priced off” if tolls are implemented?
* How much traffic will a new development generate?
* How much demand will I lose if I raise shipping costs to my customers?

In short, for urban passenger travel, we are trying to predict the number of trips by: 
* Origin Activity, 
* Destination Activity, 
* Origin Zone, 
* Destination Zone, 
* Mode, 
* Time of Day, and
* Route.  

This is clearly a multidimensional problem.

In practice, the mechanism to do this is to employ a &quot;four-step&quot; urban transportation planning model, each step will be detailed in subsequent modules. These steps are executed in turn, though there may be feedback between steps:

* Trip Generation - How many trips &lt;math&gt;T_{i}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;T_{j}&lt;/math&gt; are entering or leaving zone &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;
* Trip Distribution or Destination Choice - How many trips &lt;math&gt;T_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;are going from zone &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; to zone &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;
* Mode Choice - How many trips &lt;math&gt;T_{ijm}&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; are using mode &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;
* Route Choice - Which links are trips &lt;math&gt;T_{ijmr}&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; by mode &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;  using route &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;



== Thought Questions ==

* Is past behavior reflective of future behavior?
* Can the future be predicted?
* Is the future independent of decisions, or are prophecies self-fulfilling?
* How do we know if forecasts were successful?
* Against what standard are they to be judged?
* What values are embedded in the planning process? 
* What happens when values change?

      <text xml:space="preserve">In order to have a fully functional transportation system, the links that connect the various origins and destinations need to be designed to a level of quality that allows the safe and efficient movement of all vehicles that use them.  This level of quality is reflective to the accurate installment of a '''geometric design'''.  Such a design needs to take various elements into consideration, including number of lanes, lane width, median type, length of acceleration and deceleration lanes, curve radii, and many more.  The detailed work of design has made lifelong careers for many engineers in the past.  Today, despite advances in computer software, the basic fundamental understanding of building a highway still needs to be understood to guarantee that intuitive roads continue to be built in the future.

Highway design itself is made up of a spectrum of considerations.  Some of the main points are discussed below.  Details can be found in their respective sections.

==Sight Distance==

[[Fundamentals of Transportation/Sight Distance | Sight Distance]] is the distance a driver can see from his or her vehicle.  This becomes important when determining design speed, as it would be unsafe to allow a driver to drive faster and not be able to stop in time for a potential, unforeseen hazard.  Sight distance is applied to two main categories:

*  Stopping Sight Distance (SSD)

*  Passing Sight Distance (PSD)

==Grade==

[[Fundamentals of Transportation/Grade | Grade]] is the slope, either upward or downward, of a road.  This is especially critical because the terrain on which a road is built is seldom flat, thus requiring inherent &quot;hills&quot; to be present on the road to keep costs down from digging canyons or tunnels.  However, too steep of a grade would make it difficult for vehicles to travel along that route.  Since a road is built to provide a service to travelers, it is undesirable to have an impassable road.

An appropriate grade is dependent on the engine power in the vehicles that are expected to use the road.  This breaks down into a force balance equation, where engine power is countered by various resistances.  These include:

*  Aerodynamic Resistance

*  Rolling Resistance

*  Grade Resistance

==Horizontal Curves==

[[Fundamentals of Transportation/Horizontal Curves | Horizontal Curves]] are semicircular curves designed on the horizontal plane to allow roads to weave around obstacles, such as towns, mountains, or lakes.  They allow a smooth transition to occur between two nonparallel roads instead of a sharp, pointed turn.  When designing horizontal curves, designers must consider the intended design speed, as centripetal force is required to ensure that vehicles can successfully negotiate the curve.  Such elements to consider for design include:

*  Curve Radius

*  Superelevation

==Vertical Curves==

[[Fundamentals of Transportation/Vertical Curves | Vertical Curves]] are placed to allow the road to follow the terrain, whether it be hills or valleys.  Vertical curves are primarily designed as parabolas, using the general form of the parabolic equation with coefficients corresponding to known elements for the road in question.  Designers can design a road by adjusting these elements and minimizing costs.  These elements include:

*  Inbound and Outbound Grades

*  Curve Length

*  Rate of curvature

==Cross Sections==

Roadway cross sections are important in design primarily for drainage.  If roads were flat and level, water would congregate on the surface, reduce the coefficient of friction, and become a safety concern.  Therefore, designers implement a &quot;crown&quot; cross section, which has a high elevation along the road's centerline and then tapers off as it leads to the shoulders.  This slope is generally very small and unnoticeable by drivers, but succeeds in allowing the water to run into the ditches or storm sewers.

==Earthwork==

[[Fundamentals of Transportation/Earthwork | Earthwork]] plays into highway design as primarily a budgetary concern.  The movement of earth, regardless if it is to a site, away from a site, or around a site, is an expensive venture.  Designers often make roadway designs with a minimal amount of necessary earthwork to keep project costs down.  However, knowing how to minimize dirt movement requires an understanding of the process.

==Pavement Design==

Pavement design generally is not considered part of geometric design, but is still an important part of the design process.  In order to facilitate efficient traffic flow, the road beneath the vehicles' tires needs to sturdy, stable, and smooth.  Pavement engineers are responsible for determining appropriate pavement depths necessary to allow traffic to pass on a certain road.  Inadequate engineering would result in cracking, formation of potholes, and total degradation of the roadway surface.

==External Excercises==

The calculation and design process of roadway geometry design are often cumbersome and time consuming.  The University of Minnesota has an online roadway geometry design tool that was created to assist transportation students in this process.  This tool, titled Roadway Online Application for Design (ROAD), allows students to design a roadway on a computer screen using a contour map in the background as reference.  This tool makes the design process more efficient and effective over the traditional paper and pencil method.  It can be found on the link listed below, is free to use, and covers the topics discussed in the Design section.  It can be found at the [http://street.umn.edu/ROAD_about.html  STREET website].

      <text xml:space="preserve">Almost anybody can build a road.  Its safety and durability would likely come into question if done by an amateur, but roads are not a difficult thing to deploy.  Management of these roads, however, is something that is far from simple.  Safety, efficiency, and sensibility are all elements that come into play when managing a road.  It is seldom possible to find a managing strategy that satisfies all three of these categories, but often a &quot;good&quot; strategy can be found by balancing tradeoffs.  This section introduces the fundamentals of traffic management and operation, discussing everything from queueing theory to traffic signals.  The discussions here cover the fundamentals for traffic operations.  To this day, research is still being conducted to perfect these elements.

== Queueing ==

[[Fundamentals of Transportation/Queueing | Queueing]] is the study of traffic behavior near a certain section where demand exceeds available capacity.  Queues can be seen in a variety of situations and transportation systems.  Its presence is one of the causes of driver delay.

== Traffic Flow ==

[[Fundamentals of Transportation/Traffic Flow | Traffic Flow]] is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they make with one another.  While traffic flow cannot be predicted with one-hundred percent certainty due to unpredictable driver behavior, drivers tend to behave within a reasonable range that can be represented mathematically.  Relationships have been established between the three main traffic flow characteristics:
* Flow
* Density
* Velocity

== Queueing and Traffic Flow ==

[[Fundamentals of Transportation/Queueing and Traffic Flow | Queueing and Traffic Flow ]] is the study of traffic flow behaviors surrounding queueing events.  They merge concepts learned in the prior two sections and apply them to bottlenecks.

== Shockwaves ==

[[Fundamentals of Transportation/Shockwaves | Shockwaves ]] are the byproducts of traffic congestion and queueing.  They are defined as transition zones between two traffic states that are dynamic, meaning they generally have the ability to move.  Most drivers can identify shockwaves as the propagation of brake lights stemming from a given incident.

== Traffic Signals ==

[[Fundamentals of Transportation/Traffic Signals | Traffic Signals ]] are one of the more familiar types of traffic control.  Using either a fixed or adaptive schedule, traffic signals allow certain parts of the intersection to move while forcing other parts to wait, delivering instructions to drivers through a set of colorful lights.  While many benefits come with traffic signals, they also come with a series of costs, such as increasing delay during the off-peak.  But, traffic signals are generally a well-accepted form of traffic control for busy intersections and continue to be deployed.

== Additional Areas of Study ==

=== Level of Service ===

One of the basic assessments of roadway performance is by determining its Level of Service (LOS).  These Levels of Service, typically ranging between A and F (A being good performance, F being poor performance), are assessed by certain predetermined thresholds for any of the three characteristics of traffic flow (flow, density, and/or velocity).  Finding the correct LOS often requires reference to a table.

When computing a value of flow to determine LOS, the following formula is used:

&lt;math&gt;v_p^{}  = \frac{V}{{PHF\,*N\,*f_{HV} \,*f_p }}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
* &lt;math&gt;v_p&lt;/math&gt; = Actual Volume per Lane
* &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; = Hourly Volume
* &lt;math&gt;PHF&lt;/math&gt; = Peak Hour Factor
* &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; = Number of Lanes
* &lt;math&gt;f_{HV}&lt;/math&gt; = Heavy Vehicle Factor
* &lt;math&gt;f_p&lt;/math&gt; = Driver Familiarity Factor (generally, a value of 1 for commuters, less for out-of-town drivers)

Peak Hour Factor is found to be:

&lt;math&gt;PHF = V/(4V_{15}) \,\!&lt;/math&gt; 

Where: 
* &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; = Hourly Volume 
* &lt;math&gt;V_{15}&lt;/math&gt; = Peak 15-Minute Flow 

The Heavy Vehicle Factor is found to be:

&lt;math&gt;f_{HV}  = \frac{1}{{1 + P_T \left( {E_T  - 1} \right) + P_R \left( {E_R  - 1} \right)}}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
* &lt;math&gt;P_T&lt;/math&gt; = Percentage of Trucks, in decimal
* &lt;math&gt;E_T&lt;/math&gt; = Passenger Car Equivalent of Trucks (found through table)
* &lt;math&gt;P_R&lt;/math&gt; = Percentage of Recreational Vehicles, in decimal
* &lt;math&gt;E_R&lt;/math&gt; = Passenger car Equivalent of Recreational Vehicles (found through table)

Similarly, LOS can be analyzed the anticipated speed of the corridor.  The equation below produces the estimated free-flow speed for a strip of rural road, given certain characteristics about it:

&lt;math&gt;FFS = BFFS - f_{LW} - f_{LC} - f_N - f_{ID}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
* &lt;math&gt;FFS&lt;/math&gt; = Estimated Free Flow Speed
* &lt;math&gt;BFFS&lt;/math&gt; = Base Free Flow Speed
* &lt;math&gt;f_{LW}&lt;/math&gt; = Adjustment for Lane Width (found in tables)
* &lt;math&gt;f_{LC}&lt;/math&gt; = Adjustment for Lateral Clearance (found in tables)
* &lt;math&gt;f_N&lt;/math&gt; = Adjustment for Number of Lanes (found in tables)
* &lt;math&gt;f_{ID}&lt;/math&gt; = Adjustment for Interchange Density (found in tables)

For multilane urban highways, free-flow speed is computed with a similar equation:

&lt;math&gt;FFS = BFFS - f_{LW} - f_{LC} - f_M - f_A\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
* &lt;math&gt;FFS&lt;/math&gt; = Estimated Free Flow Speed
* &lt;math&gt;BFFS&lt;/math&gt; = Base Free Flow Speed
* &lt;math&gt;f_{LW}&lt;/math&gt; = Adjustment for Lane Width (found in tables)
* &lt;math&gt;f_{LC}&lt;/math&gt; = Adjustment for Lateral Clearance (found in tables)
* &lt;math&gt;f_M&lt;/math&gt; = Adjustment for Median Type (found in tables)
* &lt;math&gt;f_{A}&lt;/math&gt; = Adjustment for Access Points (found in tables)

Lateral Clearance is computed:

&lt;math&gt;TLC = LC_R + LC_L\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
* &lt;math&gt;TLC&lt;/math&gt; = Total Lateral Clearance
* &lt;math&gt;LC_R&lt;/math&gt; = Lateral Clearance on the Right Side of the Travel Lanes to Obstructions
* &lt;math&gt;LC_L&lt;/math&gt; = Lateral Clearance on the Left Side of the Travel Lanes to Obstructions

Once TLC is computed, a table can provide the value for the Lateral Clearance Adjustment.

=== Estimating Gaps ===

One area of transportation operations that is still being considered is the estimation of gaps between vehicles.  This is applicable in a variety of situations, primarily dealing with arrivals of vehicles at a given intersection.  Gaps can only be predicted through a probability, based on several known characteristics occurring at a given time or location.

One of the more popular models used for predicting arrivals is the Poisson Model.  This model is shown here:

&lt;math&gt;P(x) = \frac{{\lambda t^x e^{ - \lambda t} }}{{x!}}for\quad x = 0,1,2,\infty  \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
* &lt;math&gt;P(x)&lt;/math&gt; = Probability of having x vehicles arrive in time t
* &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; = Average vehicle flow or arrival rate
* &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; = Duration of the time interval over which vehicles are counted
* &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; = Number of vehicles to arrive in time t

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''This manual of style will be undergoing major work as the wikibook is belongs to is being constucted.'''

== Basic Wikibook Style ==
* The main format of the page hierarchy this book looks like this:
:* Title Page
::* Section 
:::* Chapter
::::* Subpage (If any)
* Every chapter/subpage should contain sections. The main idea of a section should be a first-level header. A sub-topic should be a second-level header. An offshoot of the sub-topic should be a third-level. There should be no need to go beyond a third-level.
* Every content page MUST use the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{MIRC_Scripting/header}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; template with the proper parameters and it must be the first item on the page. A content page is a page listed in, you guessed it, THE TABLE OF CONTENTS! This means do not use the header template on Images, Templates, pages in the section /Info/, or any other page that ISN'T a chapter of the book.
* To make sure you don't break Firefox browsers, use : in place of * when there's multiple bullets. e.g. Instead of **** use :::*, instead of ** use :*, and so on.
* For code examples, use a table, like so:

&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;langname&quot;&gt;
code goes here
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

* For code in the middle of a sentence or commands for a user to type, use &amp;lt;tt&amp;gt;
* For continuity's sake, most images should go on the right, because most of them are already over there, and it looks better.
* Consult the main author BEFORE making massive changes, or any changes to a template/image

== Development Stages Style ==
* Please don't forget |devstage= in the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{MIRC_Scripting/header}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; template. Also, make sure that the dev stage on the bookshelf, total progress for the book header, and each ToC entry is up to date.

== Page Style ==
* All pages not images or templates should have &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:MIRC Scripting]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; on them.

== Image Style ==
* All images need &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:MIRC Scripting Images]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; on their page.

== Template Style ==
* All templates need a usage section. It should be inside &amp;lt;pre&amp;gt; tags and should explain the syntax and usage of the template.
* All templates also need &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:MIRC_Scripting_Templates]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; on them.

== Author Page Style ==
* Nothing on the list of authors should be changed other than adding &lt;nowiki&gt;{{MIRC_Scripting/Author}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; templates. The only other data besides an Author template should be the special thanks.
* If a field does not apply to you, leave it alone.

== To-Do Page Style ==
* Please sign things to do with the four tildes &lt;nowiki&gt;(~~~~)&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

== Use Common Sense ==
Even if something might go against the Manual of Style, this is not written in stone, and not everything is covered in here. As long as it looks alright and is helpful the book it will most likely be fine.

__TOC__

You've got the foundation to use mIRC and the Scripts Editor. Now we can start with learning how to script. Read this chapter section by section and follow along with the examples. You will need to understand the skills in this chapter to move on and make any sort of script whatsoever. This is a very long chapter, especially for beginners, so take your time reading this.

== Types of Scripts ==
There are three types of scripts in mIRC.; aliases, popups, and remotes. Each one is comprised of different parts and has its own tab in the scripts editor.

=== Aliases ===
Aliases are user-defined commands that stand for a set of one or more commands. Aliases are usually used to simplify everyday IRC tasks, such as identifying your nickname. The syntax of an alias is:


{|
|-
|
&lt;source lang=&quot;mirc&quot;&gt;
aliasname command
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

An example of an alias placed in the aliases tab of your script editor would look something like this:


{|
|-
|
&lt;source lang=&quot;mirc&quot;&gt;
hello say Hi, I'm $me and I am an mIRC user.
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

The first part of the alias is &lt;tt&gt;hello&lt;/tt&gt;. This is the alias' name. You would type the command &lt;tt&gt;/hello&lt;/tt&gt; in the command line. The &lt;tt&gt;say Hi, I'm $me and I am an mIRC user.&lt;/tt&gt; part is the command that is executed when you type &lt;tt&gt;/hello&lt;/tt&gt;. Typing &lt;tt&gt;/hello&lt;/tt&gt; and pressing Enter would result in the line showing up in the current window saying &lt;tt&gt;&quot;Hi, I'm mynickname and I am an mIRC user.&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;

One important thing to take note of is that I didn't use a / before the alias name or the command. This is unnecessary in the scripts editor. mIRC prefixes every command in a script with a //, which runs every command and evaluates any variables or identifiers in the command automatically. So, mIRC would treat both of these the exact same way:


{|
|-
|
&lt;source lang=&quot;mirc&quot;&gt;
/hello /say Hi, I'm $me and I am an mIRC user.
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

{|
|-
|
&lt;source lang=&quot;mirc&quot;&gt;
hello say Hi, I'm $me and I am an mIRC user.
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

==== Multi-line Aliases ====
mIRC requires anything spanning multiple lines to be enclosed in brackets ({ and }). For example, the alias hello that we had above could use /say twice. This could be accomplished using this code:


{|
|-
|
&lt;source lang=&quot;mirc&quot;&gt;
hello {
say Hi, I'm $me and I am an mIRC user.
say Do you use mIRC too?
}
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;'''WARNING:'''&lt;/font&gt; Another method of doing multi-command blocks of code in mIRC Scripting is called piping, where a pipe character (|) is stuck in between the two commands, such as &lt;tt&gt;/echo hi! | /echo goodbye!&lt;/tt&gt; This makes hard to read code, takes mIRC longer to process, and in general is bad coding practice. Use it sparingly.

==== Function Key Aliases ====
Function keys can also be given functions using aliases. Enter the following script in your script editor under Aliases.


{|
|-
|
&lt;source lang=&quot;mirc&quot;&gt;
F1 {
var %n = $?=&quot;What's your nickname and password?&quot;
tokenize 32 %n
nick $1
msg nickserv identify $2
}
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

Now push F1 on your keyboard. You should see a little dialog box pop up asking for your nickname and password. Enter a nickname, and a password for NickServ if you have one, and hit enter. The script should try and change your nick and identify you to NickServ. Note that depending on your network, you may not have a Nickname Service.

If 12 Fkeys aren't enough for you, well, you can assign up to 36 commands to Fkeys. Use c or s behind an fkey to make the alias work for the key combinations &quot;shift + FX&quot; or &quot;Ctrl + FX.&quot;


{|
|-
|
&lt;source lang=&quot;mirc&quot;&gt;
sF1 {
var %n = $?=&quot;What's your nickname and password?&quot;
tokenize 32 %n
nick $1
msg nickserv identify $2
}
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

See the s before the F1? It's the only thing that changed since the last example. However, instead of pressing F1 to activate it, hold shift and press F1. The same thing should happen as last time.

One more notable thing about function key aliases: you can can use them on the command line by typing the name of the alias, like any old alias name. For the alias we made, you would simply type &lt;tt&gt;/sF1&lt;/tt&gt;.

==== Aliases in Remote Scripts ====
Aliases also serve a much more important purpose than simply doing a set of commands. Aliases in remote scripts can be used to shorten code and reuse a certain set of commands over and over, which makes writing code a lot easier. Aliases change their syntax a bit when in remote scripts.


{|
|-
|
&lt;source lang=&quot;mirc&quot;&gt;alias aliasname command(s)&lt;/source&gt;
|}

To do an alias in a remote section, it must have the &lt;tt&gt;alias&lt;/tt&gt; prefix. For example, the command I just made above would now look like


{|
|-
|
&lt;source lang=&quot;mirc&quot;&gt;
alias hello {
say Hi, I'm $me and I am an mIRC user.
say Do you use mIRC too?
}
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

The alias prefix is the only thing that changes. Running the alias still works the same; type &lt;tt&gt;/hello&lt;/tt&gt; to see the lines of text on the screen.

The real advantage of putting an alias inside a remote script is being able to use it repeatedly. For example, maybe you have an alias that increases a number three times. Technically, you can use the &lt;tt&gt;/inc&lt;/tt&gt; command to do this, but for the sake of the example, we'll make our own alias.


{|
|-
|
&lt;source lang=&quot;mirc&quot;&gt;
alias incnum3 {
// $1 is the first paramter passed to /incnum3.
// So if you use /incnum3 7, $1 =7
var %x = $1
incnum %x
incnum %x
incnum %x
echo %x
}

alias incnum {
inc %x
}
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

See how I used the &lt;tt&gt;incnum&lt;/tt&gt; alias three times? If this was a longer script, I could have saved myself a lot of time and typing by using aliases multiple times. People familiar to other programming/scripting languages will notice that aliases, in this respect, are similar to functions or subroutines that can be recycled.

==== Local Aliases ====
If you only want a command to be able to run in one script, or it would overwrite a command built-in to mIRC or another script, you can do &lt;tt&gt;alias -l&lt;/tt&gt; in front of the alias name. The &lt;tt&gt;-l&lt;/tt&gt; is a switch that tells the alias ONLY to work when called from a script inside that remote file. Let's take our previous example and add a local alias.


{|
|-
|
&lt;source lang=&quot;mirc&quot;&gt;
alias incnum3 {
// $1 is the first parameter passed to /incnum3.
// So if you use /incnum3 7, $1 =7
var %x = $1
incnum %x
incnum %x
incnum %x
echo %x
}

alias -l incnum {
inc %x
}
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

Now you cannot use &lt;tt&gt;/incnum&lt;/tt&gt; from the command line or from other scripts, but the alias &lt;tt&gt;/incnum3&lt;/tt&gt; CAN call it.

==== Recursive Aliases ====
mIRC cannot call an alias from inside itself. For example, this code would not work:


{|
|-
|
&lt;source lang=&quot;mirc&quot;&gt;
alias echomyname {
echo -a Hi I'm $me $+ !
echomyname
}
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

You cannot use &lt;tt&gt;/echomyname&lt;/tt&gt; recursively inside itself. You CAN call it from another alias, however.


{|
|-
|
&lt;source lang=&quot;mirc&quot;&gt;
alias echomyname {
echo -a Hi I'm $me $+ !
echomyname2
}

alias echomyname2 {
echo -a Hi I'm $me $+ ! This is a recursive alias.
echomyname
}
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

That would work, although it would loop forever, and most likely crash mIRC. Crashing programs is generally a bad idea. And it's quite embarrassing for you when your own program locks up in an infinite loop. So don't do it.

Now, there is one caveat to this recursive alias business. Say you wanted to write over an alias with a custom one of your own. When you call an alias from inside itself, and it has a built-in mIRC version, the alias will call mIRC's version. Take a look at this example:


{|
|-
|
&lt;source lang=&quot;mirc&quot;&gt;
alias k {
inc %k
kick $1- Total kicks %k
}
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

Let's say you wanted to overwrite the kick alias to say how many kicks you've done. You could do &lt;tt&gt;/k&lt;/tt&gt; from now on. Or, using the knowledge that mIRC can't recurse aliases, you could do this:


{|
|-
|
&lt;source lang=&quot;mirc&quot;&gt;
alias kick {
inc %k
kick $1- Total kicks %k
}
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

This will increase your kick count and kick the user you want from the channel, WITH the Total Kicks message. This comes in very useful in more advanced scripting, especially when making themes for full scripts.

=== Popups ===
Popups are user-defined context menus that show up at certain places in mIRC when you right-click. There are five popups you can customize; one on the Menu Bar, one in the status window, one on the nicklist, one in channels, and one in private messages.

==== Making Menus ====
Open your scripts editor to the Popup tab. I'll be using the Channel tab for the purposes of this book. To define a simple menu item, the syntax is:


{|
|-
|
&lt;source lang=&quot;mirc&quot;&gt;
Menuitem: command(s)
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

So, to make a simple menu item that would change your nickname to &quot;mIRCUser&quot; you could do this:


{|
|-
|
&lt;source lang=&quot;mirc&quot;&gt;
Change Nick: nick mIRCUser
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

==== Submenus ====
Now right click in any channel. You should see an option saying &quot;Change Nick →&quot; appear. Click it. Your nick, provided it isn't in use, should change to mIRCUser. But what if you have more than one nickname you like to use. Maybe you have the nicknames mIRCUser, Cakeman, and Blackknight. You can add a submenu to this existing menu.


{|
|-
|
&lt;source lang=&quot;mirc&quot;&gt;
Change Nick To
.mIRCUser: nick mIRCUser
.Cakeman: nick Cakeman
.Blackknight: nick Blackknight
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

Now, right-click in the channel again. You should see a menu looking something like &quot;Change Nick To →&quot;. If you hover over the menu, you get three choices; mIRCUser, Cakeman, and Blacknight, all three of your nicks. You can even make submenus inside your menus.


{|
|-
|
&lt;source lang=&quot;mirc&quot;&gt;
Change Nick To
.Nickname
..mIRCUser: nick mIRCUser
..Cakeman: nick Cakeman
..Blackknight: nick Blackknight
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

==== Multi-Line Menus ====
But what if your server has a Nickname Service and you identify with your nicks, like in the fkey alias example? Well, popup menu definitions can have multi-line sections just like other parts of scripts using { and }.


{|
|-
|
&lt;source lang=&quot;mirc&quot;&gt;
Change Nick To
.Nickname
..mIRCUser:{
nick mIRCUser
ns identify password
}
..Cakeman:{
nick Cakeman
ns identify password
}
..Blackknight:{
nick Blackknight
ns identify password
}
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

==== Nicklist Menus ====
Making menus in a nicklist is relatively similar to making regular menus, except you need to specify which nicklist nick is being affected. This is specified by the identifier &lt;tt&gt;$1&lt;/tt&gt;. Take note that these menus go under the Nicklist view in the Popups tab.


{|
|-
|
&lt;source lang=&quot;mirc&quot;&gt;
Kick $$1: kick $$chan $$1 You got kicked by $me $+ !
Ban $$1: mode $$chan +b $address($$1,2)
Kickban $$1: ban -k $$chan $$1 2 You got kickbanned by $me $+ !
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

The identifier &lt;tt&gt;$$1&lt;/tt&gt; in this case means the same thing as &lt;tt&gt;$1&lt;/tt&gt;. It is the nickname selected on the nicklist (if there is one and you are in a channel). When you click on an option (kick, ban, or kickban), it will do that option to whatever nickname is in &lt;tt&gt;$$1&lt;/tt&gt;. For example, the kick option kicks &lt;tt&gt;$$1&lt;/tt&gt; from &lt;tt&gt;$$chan&lt;/tt&gt; with the message, &lt;tt&gt;&quot;You got kicked by mynick!&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;

Now, allow me to use this example to explain the double $$ prefix. When used with an identifier, this will stop a command from executing if the identifier returns &lt;tt&gt;$null&lt;/tt&gt;. For instance, if you did not select a nick on the nicklist, &lt;tt&gt;$$1&lt;/tt&gt; returns nothing and halts the command. As an added aesthetic bonus, if a double-prefixed identifier returns nothing in a menu item, the menu item will not show up. In this example, the entire menu would be hidden from view if you did not select a nick on the nicklist.

Nicklist menus also support everything regular menus support. You can use multi-line commands, submenus, etc. They work exactly the same. The only real caveat to using pop up menus that target a user in the nicklist is to remember to use &lt;tt&gt;$1&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;$$1&lt;/tt&gt;.

==== Menu Bar Menus ====
Menu Bar menus work like the rest of the popup menus, except they appear in the menu bar at the top of the mIRC Windows under the &quot;Commands&quot; menu. You can also change the name of the Commands menu, if you'd like. On the first line of a popup file under the menu bar section, put the word &lt;tt&gt;Pie&lt;/tt&gt;. Save the file and look at your menu bar. The menu should now be labeled &lt;tt&gt;&quot;Pie.&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;

==== Identifiers and Variables In Menu Items ====
Variables and identifiers in menu items are evaluated each time a menu is opened. As seen in the previous example, a nicklist menu like this:


{|
|-
|
&lt;source lang=&quot;mirc&quot;&gt;
Kick $$1: kick $$chan $$1 You got kicked by $me $+ !
Ban $$1: mode $$chan +b $address($$1,2)
Kickban $$1: ban -k $$chan $$1 2 You got kickbanned by $me $+ !
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

Would have &lt;tt&gt;$$1&lt;/tt&gt; evaluated each time you open then menu.


{|
|-
|
&lt;source lang=&quot;mirc&quot;&gt;
%mytext:%mycmd
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

If you have variables set called &lt;tt&gt;%mytext&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;%mycmd&lt;/tt&gt; then the menu item will appear clickable. If you only have &lt;tt&gt;%mytext&lt;/tt&gt; set, the item will appear, but grayed out and disabled. If you only have &lt;tt&gt;%mycmd%&lt;/tt&gt; set, The menu item will evaluate to &lt;tt&gt;$null&lt;/tt&gt; and not appear at all in the menu.

The advantage of using identifiers and variables in popup menus is to make them more dynamic, as seen in the kick/ban menu example above.

==== Popups in Remote Files ====
Much like aliases, popups can be defined in remote files, in almost the same way. You simply use the &lt;tt&gt;menu ''[menuname]''&lt;/tt&gt; prefix, and then enclose the menu commands in brackets. ''&lt;tt&gt;Menuname&lt;/tt&gt;'' is the location of the popup; either channel, status, query, menubar, or nicklist. Unlike the Popups tab, a menu under the Remote tab does not know where to open it the menu, so you must say it after the menu prefix.


{|
|-
|
&lt;source lang=&quot;mirc&quot;&gt;
menu channel {
Get Channel Info: channel
}
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

This is roughly the same as the default menu in mIRC under the Popups/Channel tab, however, it is in a remote file now, with the menu prefix attached.


{|
|-
|
&lt;source lang=&quot;mirc&quot;&gt;
menu channel,query {
Slap Someone!: me slaps a random user with a large trout.
}
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

Menus in remote files can also have multiple menu names of where the menu should pop up. This one will pop up in a channel window OR a query window.

==== Popup Menu Styles ====
Menu Styles are used to change the look of your menu items. You can make a menu item appear checked off or disabled using menu styles. There are three menu styles you can use, using the &lt;tt&gt;$style&lt;/tt&gt; identifier.

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;1&quot; class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!colspan=&quot;2&quot; |Menu Styles
|-
!Style
!Result
|-
|&lt;tt&gt;$style(1) Checked Item&lt;/tt&gt;
|√ Checked Item
|-
|&lt;tt&gt;$style(2) Disabled Item&lt;/tt&gt;
|&lt;font color=&quot;grey&quot;&gt;Disabled Item&lt;/font&gt;
|-
|&lt;tt&gt;$style(3) Checked and Disabled Item&lt;/tt&gt;
|&lt;font color=&quot;grey&quot;&gt;√ Checked and Disabled Item&lt;/font&gt;
|-
|}

This is an example of a menu that uses styles to disable items if you are not connected to a server.


{|
|-
|
&lt;source lang=&quot;mirc&quot;&gt;
menu status {
$iif(!$server,$style(2),$style(1)) Join #mIRC: join #mIRC
$iif(!$server,$style(2),$style(1)) Get a list of channels: list
}
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

If mIRC is not connected to a server, both commands will be disabled. If you ARE connected, both of them will be enabled and have check marks (√) next to them.

==== $submenu ====
&lt;tt&gt;$submenu&lt;/tt&gt; is a fairly advanced identifier that makes a dynamic submenu for a popup menu. It calls a custom identifier with the parameter &lt;tt&gt;$1&lt;/tt&gt;, where 1 is a number that increases each time it runs through the identifier, until it stops. Sound confusing? Perhaps this code example will help.


{|
|-
|
&lt;source lang=&quot;mirc&quot;&gt;
; The Identifier $submenu calls; generates a list of channels.
alias _infochan {
if ($1 == begin) return -
if ($chan($1) ischan) return $ifmatch : .msg chanserv info $ifmatch
if ($1 == end) return -
}

; Check to see if ChanServ exists on the network you are on.
alias _cschk {
.notify ChanServ $network
if ($notify(ChanServ) &gt; 0) { var %csison = 1 }
elseif ($notify(ChanServ) &lt; 1) { var %csison = 0 }
.timer 1 1 .notify -r ChanServ
return %csison
}

menu status {

; If there is no Chanserv, hide the menu.
$iif($_cschk &lt; 1,$style(2)) Get Channel Info

; Else, list the channels.
.$submenu($_infochan($1))
}
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

The main thing to pay attention to here is how &lt;tt&gt;$submenu&lt;/tt&gt; is used. &lt;tt&gt;$submenu&lt;/tt&gt; Inserts the value 1 into &lt;tt&gt;$1&lt;/tt&gt;, then increases that each time it goes through until it ends. So for &lt;tt&gt;$chan($1)&lt;/tt&gt; in the custom identifier &lt;tt&gt;$_infochan&lt;/tt&gt; will return the first channel you are on, then the second one, and so on, until you run out of channels.

Let's assume you are on #mIRC, #Windows, and #Scripting, and ChanServ is on your network. If you right-click in your status window, you will see a menu saying &quot;Get Channel Info →&quot; and three menu items in that menu's submen; #mIRC, #Windows, and #Scripting. Clicking on one of those will do a &lt;tt&gt;/msg chanserv info&lt;/tt&gt; on the channel. This command returns information about a registered channel, if it is registered. The output would look something like this:


{|
|-
|
&lt;code&gt;

-ChanServ- Information for channel #scripting:&lt;br /&gt;
-&lt;br /&gt;
-ChanServ-         Founder: Master_Scripter&lt;br /&gt;

-&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
|}

==== Menu Separators ====
To separate menu items, you can use a single '-' (hyphen) in between items.

=== Remote Scripts ===
Remote scripts make up the majority of what you will script in mIRC. They are a combination of aliases, popup menus, and event-driven blocks of commands. Unlike aliases and popups, you can have multiple remotes loaded at the same time. Each remote file usually contains one script. An individual script is a remote file (a file ending in .mrc or .ini) with related events, aliases, and popup definitions. An example of a script could be a script that makes you join a channel when you connect to a server, or manage a list of quotes people have said on IRC. The basic syntax of a remote event looks like this:

==== Remote Events ====

{|
|-
|
&lt;source lang=&quot;mirc&quot;&gt;
On *:Event:parameters:{
commands
}
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

The &lt;tt&gt;*&lt;/tt&gt; is what user level the event will trigger on. User levels are defined later in this section. Typically, events will usually have a user level of &lt;tt&gt;*&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt;. &lt;tt&gt;*&lt;/tt&gt; means the event will trigger on any level, and the &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt; means it will trigger by anyone with a user level of 1 or higher (1 is the default level in mIRC, unless you change it, so this will also usually mean anyone). The &lt;tt&gt;event&lt;/tt&gt; is the name of the event you are defining. Examples of events are Text, Action, Ban, Join, and Part. You should only have one type of each event in a script for them to work right. The &lt;tt&gt;parameters&lt;/tt&gt; part of the event can be anything. It's usually match text, where the event takes place, both, or neither of them. Inside this event block are all the commands you want the script to do.


{|
|-
|
&lt;source lang=&quot;mirc&quot;&gt;
On *:Text:*:#:{
if (hello isin $1-) {
msg $chan Why hello there $nick $+ !
}
}
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

This is an example of one of the more popular remote events, and one of the easiest to understand. It triggers whenever someone says text that matches the matchtext. The matchtext in this case is &lt;tt&gt;*&lt;/tt&gt;, the wild card symbol. This means it will match anything. The if-then-else statement in the event's body determines what text it matches. This is a better idea in practice when using events. Instead of using multiple events that match different things, using one event that uses if-then-else statements will ensure that everything is processed in the right order. In this case, the script checks to see if the word &lt;tt&gt;&quot;hello&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; is in the text said, but only in channels. The &lt;tt&gt;#&lt;/tt&gt; after the &lt;tt&gt;*&lt;/tt&gt; is what determines where the event triggers. You can also specify a &lt;tt&gt;?&lt;/tt&gt; for private messages only, and &lt;tt&gt;*&lt;/tt&gt; to make it trigger in both channels and PMs.


{|
|-
|
&lt;source lang=&quot;mirc&quot;&gt;
On *:Load:{
echo -a Thank you for loading my script!
}
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

This is another example of a remote event. This one has no parameters. The event simply triggers when you load the script it is in. When you load this script, it will display the line on your screen, &lt;tt&gt;&quot;Thank you for loading my script!&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;.

One important thing to know about remote event scripts is that most of them do not work when you trigger them yourself. Some events do, like On Kick or On Ban, while others like On Text will not work when you say something in a channel with the script loaded. mIRC will generally say in the help file when you can or can't trigger it yourself. Otherwise, it's trial and error.

==== CTCP Events ====
CTCP Events are events that trigger when you get a [[w:Client-to-client protocol|CTCP]] (client-to-client protocol) from another client. A CTCP event can be used to override a default mIRC action for a CTCP event (with the exception of VERSION), but can also be used to make your own CTCP replies.


{|
|-
|
&lt;source lang=&quot;mirc&quot;&gt;
CTCP *:secretword:*:{
if ($2 == moo) { msg $nick You got the secret word! }
else { msg $nick Sorry, you're wrong. }
}
&lt;/source&gt;
|}


{|
|-
|
&lt;source lang=&quot;mirc&quot;&gt;
CTCP *:ctcpname:*|#|?:{
commands
}
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

A CTCP event looks very similar to a regular remote event. However, instead of the &lt;tt&gt;On&lt;/tt&gt; prefix, CTCP events start with &lt;tt&gt;CTCP&lt;/tt&gt;. The &lt;tt&gt;*&lt;/tt&gt; is still the same; the access level required to trigger the event. &lt;tt&gt;Ctcpname&lt;/tt&gt; is the name of the ctcp the event should trigger on. This could be anything from a built-in CTCP event such as &lt;tt&gt;TIME&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;VERSION&lt;/tt&gt; or a made-up event such as &lt;tt&gt;BLAH&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;HELLO&lt;/tt&gt;. The location parameter, again, is the same as a regular event. &lt;tt&gt;#&lt;/tt&gt; is a channel, &lt;tt&gt;?&lt;/tt&gt; is a PM, and &lt;tt&gt;*&lt;/tt&gt; is both.


{|
|-
|
&lt;source lang=&quot;mirc&quot;&gt;
CTCP *:secretword:*:{
if ($2 == moo) { msg $nick You got the secret word! }
else { msg $nick Sorry, you're wrong. }
}
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

This event will respond any time someone CTCPs you with the text &lt;tt&gt;&quot;secretword.&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; It will check and see if the word they gave matches the secret word. If it matches, the script will PM them saying so.


{|
|-
|
&lt;source lang=&quot;mirc&quot;&gt;
CTCP *:%secretword:*:{
msg $nick You got the secret word!
}
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

Using a variable (&lt;tt&gt;%secretword&lt;/tt&gt;) as the matchtext for the CTCP event, you can change the secret word any time and shorten the code. Now, the script will only respond when they CTCP you with the correct word.


{|
|-
|
&lt;source lang=&quot;mirc&quot;&gt;
CTCP *:Version:*:{
ctcpreply $nick VERSION MyScript version 1.0
}
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

While you can't hide the original mIRC version reply itself, you can add your own reply to the standard one. This one will send a CTCP reply back using &lt;tt&gt;/ctcpreply&lt;/tt&gt; to the person who CTCP'd you with your custom version reply, after the mIRC one.


{|
|-
|
&lt;source lang=&quot;mirc&quot;&gt;
CTCP *:*help*:*:{
msg $nick What can I help you with, $nick $+ ?
}
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

By enclosing the matchtext in wildcards, this script will trigger any time anyone says the word &lt;tt&gt;help&lt;/tt&gt; anywhere in the CTCP query, and msg them back.

==== Raw Events ====
Raw events are advanced events that trigger when you receive a raw numeric from a server. This happens when you send a query to a server using a command such as &lt;tt&gt;/whois&lt;/tt&gt; and you get a reply back.


{|
|-
|
&lt;source lang=&quot;mirc&quot;&gt;
Raw numeric:matchtext:{
commands
}
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

Unlike remotes and CTCPs, Raw events ONLY trigger in your client, when you receive raw numerics from the IRC server. This happens when you get a reply after sending a query to a server; for example, using &lt;tt&gt;/whois&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;/away&lt;/tt&gt;.


{|
|-
|
&lt;source lang=&quot;mirc&quot;&gt;
Raw 431:*:{
.haltdef
echo -s ERROR: Raw 431 - No nickname given.
}
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

This event replaces mIRC's default reply for Raw 431, the message you get when you fail to specify a target for a command like &lt;tt&gt;/whois&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;/nick&lt;/tt&gt;. It silences the default reply using /haltdef.

You may know how to use remote events now, but they are only a small fraction of making remote scripts. Making the events themselves is simple, but there is a huge amount commands to put inside the events. This is the real challenge of mIRC scripting, and what the remaining bulk of this book will cover.

== Variables ==
Variables are dynamic values that evaluate each time the script is run to a certain value. Variables are assigned a certain value and always return their current value when called upon. In mIRC Scripting, variables are untyped. This means that a variable can store any type of data; text, numbers, or any combination of the two. A variable starts with a &lt;tt&gt;%&lt;/tt&gt; prefix. There are two kinds of variables; local and global.

=== Local Variables ===
Local variables are created during scripts, and do not overwrite other local variables or global variables of the same name. Local variables are destroyed after the calling script executes.


{|
|-
|
&lt;source lang=&quot;mirc&quot;&gt;
alias saysomething {
var %text = $$?=&quot;What should I say?&quot;
echo -a %text
}
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

If you type &lt;tt&gt;/saysomething&lt;/tt&gt; and hit enter, a box will come up asking, &lt;tt&gt;&quot;What should I say?&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;. Enter some text and hit okay. That text will get put into &lt;tt&gt;%text&lt;/tt&gt;, and then whatever is in &lt;tt&gt;%text&lt;/tt&gt; will be echoed to the screen. &lt;tt&gt;%text&lt;/tt&gt; will not exist after the script ends. Try typing &lt;tt&gt;//echo -a %text&lt;/tt&gt; into the command line. You should get a &lt;tt&gt;* /echo: insufficient parameters&lt;/tt&gt; error. This is because variables evaluate to &lt;tt&gt;$null&lt;/tt&gt; if they do not exist.

=== Global Variables ===
Global variables stay around once they are set, until they are unset, unlike local variables.


{|
|-
|
&lt;source lang=&quot;mirc&quot;&gt;
On *:Connect:{
if (!%connnick) {
set %connnick $?=&quot;What do you want your nickname to be?&quot;
}
nick %connnick
}
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

When you connect to a server, the server will ask you what you want your nickname to be if the variable &lt;tt&gt;%connnick&lt;/tt&gt; doesn't exist. Either way, it will change your nickname to whatever is in &lt;tt&gt;%connnick&lt;/tt&gt;. Now, open your script editor and open the Variables tab. You should see a variable called &lt;tt&gt;%connnick&lt;/tt&gt; with a value of whatever nickname you chose. You may also see other variables, if you have run other scripts. These variables are all global, and will stick around under the Variables tab and return a value, until you use the &lt;tt&gt;/unset&lt;/tt&gt; command.


{|
|-
|
&lt;source lang=&quot;mirc&quot;&gt;
On *:Connect:{
if (!%connnick) {
set -u0 %connnick $?=&quot;What do you want your nickname to be?&quot;
}
nick %connnick
}
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

Notice the difference in this script? The variable &lt;tt&gt;%connnick&lt;/tt&gt;, in a sense, will act like a global variable in this script because of the &lt;tt&gt;-u0&lt;/tt&gt; flag in the &lt;tt&gt;/set&lt;/tt&gt; command. &lt;tt&gt;-u''N''&lt;/tt&gt; make the global variable unset after ''N'' seconds. However, if you specify 0 for ''N'', the variable will unset when the script finishes executing. It is not completely like a local variable; other global variables can overwrite it, and vice-versa. However, it is still a way to make sure the script cleans up all its global variables when it finishes.

=== Mathematical Equations With Variables ===
There are two ways to perform mathematical operations on variables; the commands &lt;tt&gt;/inc&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;/dec&lt;/tt&gt;, and the &lt;tt&gt;=&lt;/tt&gt; (assignment operator).


{|
|-
|
&lt;source lang=&quot;mirc&quot;&gt;
alias incnum2 {
var %num = $$1
inc %num
inc %num
echo -a Your number was increased by two! You got %num $+ !
}
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

This alias will take any number you give it, assign it to a variable, and increases it twice using &lt;tt&gt;/inc&lt;/tt&gt;. For example, if you did &lt;tt&gt;/incnum2 7&lt;/tt&gt; you would get the message &lt;tt&gt;&quot;Your number was increased by two! You got 9!&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;


{|
|-
|
&lt;source lang=&quot;mirc&quot;&gt;
alias decnum2 {
var %num = $$1
dec %num
dec %num
echo -a Your number was decreased by two! You got %num $+ !
}
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

Now the &lt;tt&gt;/inc&lt;/tt&gt; commands have changed to &lt;tt&gt;/dec&lt;/tt&gt; commands. This will '''decrease''' your number by two. The same &lt;tt&gt;/incnum2 7&lt;/tt&gt; changed to &lt;tt&gt;/decnum2 7&lt;/tt&gt; would give you the number &lt;tt&gt;5&lt;/tt&gt;.


{|
|-
|
&lt;source lang=&quot;mirc&quot;&gt;
alias math {
if (($1 isnum) &amp;&amp; ($2 isin +-*/) &amp;&amp; ($3 isnum)) {
var %num1 = $1, %num2 = $3
var %num3 = %num1 $2 %num2
echo -a %num3
}
}
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

This code snippet uses the assignment operator to perform math on the variable. The first thing this code does is check to see if you gave it three parameters. It makes sure &lt;tt&gt;$1&lt;/tt&gt; is a number, &lt;tt&gt;$2&lt;/tt&gt; is a mathematical operator (+, -, *, or /), and &lt;tt&gt;$3&lt;/tt&gt; is a number. If they are all correct, the script then puts the two numbers into variables &lt;tt&gt;%num1&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;%num2&lt;/tt&gt;. &lt;tt&gt;%num1&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;%num2&lt;/tt&gt; have an operation done to them (whatever you put into &lt;tt&gt;$2&lt;/tt&gt;) and reports the result. Doing the command &lt;tt&gt;/math 3 * 2&lt;/tt&gt; would output &lt;tt&gt;6&lt;/tt&gt;.


{|
|-
|
&lt;source lang=&quot;mirc&quot;&gt;

alias square {
var %1 = $$1
var %2 = %1 * %1
echo -a %2
}
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

A simpler alias than the last one, this command simply takes the first number you give it and multiplies it by itself. &lt;tt&gt;/square 3&lt;/tt&gt; will give you &lt;tt&gt;9&lt;/tt&gt;.

== Identifiers ==
Identifiers are similar to variables. They are dynamic values in scripts that evaluate when they are parsed in the script. However, unlike variables, they do not always return a static value that is the same every time. Like variables, they can evaluate to &lt;tt&gt;$null&lt;/tt&gt;.

For example, one identifier we have used a lot so far is &lt;tt&gt;$1&lt;/tt&gt;. &lt;tt&gt;$1&lt;/tt&gt; evaluates to the first parameter, if any, passed to a command when it is run. However, this is not always in the same. In the example above, we could use the command &lt;tt&gt;/square 3&lt;/tt&gt;. &lt;tt&gt;$1&lt;/tt&gt; in this case is &lt;tt&gt;3&lt;/tt&gt;. Let's change that &lt;tt&gt;3&lt;/tt&gt; to a &lt;tt&gt;4&lt;/tt&gt;. Now &lt;tt&gt;$1&lt;/tt&gt; is &lt;tt&gt;4&lt;/tt&gt;. Pass nothing to it, and &lt;tt&gt;$1&lt;/tt&gt; will evaluate to &lt;tt&gt;$null&lt;/tt&gt;.

Another popular identifier used is &lt;tt&gt;$chan&lt;/tt&gt;. &lt;tt&gt;$chan&lt;/tt&gt; returns whatever channel a script or command triggers in. Make sure you have two channels open. Go to one of them, and type &lt;tt&gt;//echo $chan $chan&lt;/tt&gt;.The effect of this action is to print in the current channel(the first occurence of &quot;$chan&quot;)right the name of current channel(evalutate by the second &quot;$chan&quot;). Now go to a different channel and do the same command. Notice you still get the channel name. This is because &lt;tt&gt;$chan&lt;/tt&gt; re-evaluates every time is occurs in a script.

=== Built-In Identifiers ===
Built-In identifiers are identifiers coded into mIRC. There are dozens of built-in identifiers, but some of the most used are &lt;tt&gt;$nick&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;$chan&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;$me&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;$1&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;$+&lt;/tt&gt;. Identifiers built-in to mIRC have priority over custom ones and cannot be changed or re-coded, unlike built-in commands.

=== Custom Identifiers ===
A custom identifier is an alias that can return a value. Custom identifiers take the form of a regular alias, but are used differently. They are called with the same &lt;tt&gt;$&lt;/tt&gt; prefix as regular identifiers instead of the &lt;tt&gt;/&lt;/tt&gt; prefix used when calling an alias as a command.


{|
|-
|
&lt;source lang=&quot;mirc&quot;&gt;
alias addnum {
if ($$1 isnum) &amp;&amp; ($$2 isnum) {
return $calc($1 + $2)
}
}
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

The script first starts off by again, checking to make sure the two parameters are valid numbers. Then, it returns the value of the two numbers added together. The proper way to use this is &lt;tt&gt;//echo -a $addnum(''n1'',''n2'')&lt;/tt&gt;. If you type this as a command, nothing will happen. &lt;tt&gt;/addnum 1 2&lt;/tt&gt; will return a value of &lt;tt&gt;3&lt;/tt&gt;, but nothing will show up because it '''returns''' a value, instead of echoing it. You can change this, however, using the identifier &lt;tt&gt;$isid&lt;/tt&gt;.


{|
|-
|
&lt;source lang=&quot;mirc&quot;&gt;
alias addnum {
if ($$1 isnum) &amp;&amp; ($$2 isnum) {
$iif($isid,return,echo) $calc($1 + $2)
}
}
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

&lt;tt&gt;$isid&lt;/tt&gt; returns &lt;tt&gt;$true&lt;/tt&gt; if the alias was called as &lt;tt&gt;$addnum&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;$false&lt;/tt&gt; if it was called as the alias &lt;tt&gt;/addnum&lt;/tt&gt;. Combined with another identifier, &lt;tt&gt;$iif&lt;/tt&gt;, we can determine if &lt;tt&gt;$isid&lt;/tt&gt; returns &lt;tt&gt;$true&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;$false&lt;/tt&gt; and take an action based on what the result is. If &lt;tt&gt;$isid&lt;/tt&gt; is true, that means &lt;tt&gt;addnum&lt;/tt&gt; was called as an identifier, and will return a value. If &lt;tt&gt;$isid&lt;/tt&gt; is false, then &lt;tt&gt;addnum&lt;/tt&gt; was called as an alias, and will echo a value to the screen. Try the command both ways now with &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;2&lt;/tt&gt;. Both times, you should get &lt;tt&gt;3&lt;/tt&gt;

==== Custom Properties ====
You may notice that some identifiers have properties. For example, if you type &lt;tt&gt;//echo -a $chan(1).topic&lt;/tt&gt;, the topic of the first channel you are on will display on your screen. &lt;tt&gt;.topic&lt;/tt&gt; is the property of the identifier. You can add properties to your identifiers, too.


{|
|-
|
&lt;source lang=&quot;mirc&quot;&gt;
alias addnum {
if ($$1 isnum) &amp;&amp; ($$2 isnum) {
$iif($isid,return,echo) $iif($prop == neg,$calc(-1 * ($1 + $2)),$calc($1 + $2))
}
}
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

Again, using &lt;tt&gt;$iif&lt;/tt&gt;, we can check the property of the identifier. If you use the command &lt;tt&gt;//echo -a $addnum(1,2).neg&lt;/tt&gt;, instead of returning &lt;tt&gt;3&lt;/tt&gt; you will get &lt;tt&gt;-3&lt;/tt&gt;. This because the property &lt;tt&gt;.neg&lt;/tt&gt; was used with &lt;tt&gt;$addnum&lt;/tt&gt;.

'''''Note:''' Built in identifiers to mIRC will take precedence over custom ones with the same name. You cannot re-script &lt;tt&gt;$chan&lt;/tt&gt; to return &lt;tt&gt;42&lt;/tt&gt;. mIRC will still return the name of the channel you are on.

== Comments ==
Comments are a very important part of coding when your scripts start to get very large and complex. You will hopefully remember tomorrow what your code did last night, but can you say you will remember what a line of code should do six months from now? Comments are lines of code that are ignored by mIRC's interpreter and can be used to remind you what a certain part of a script does. This is what the last example could look like if we commented it.

=== Single Line Comments ===


{|
|-
|
&lt;source lang=&quot;mirc&quot;&gt;
alias addnum {

; Are $1 and $2 numbers?
if ($$1 isnum) &amp;&amp; ($$2 isnum) {

; Was addnum called as a command or an identifier?
; Should the number be negative?
$iif($isid,return,echo) $iif($prop == neg,$calc(-1 * ($1 + $2)),$calc($1 + $2))
}

; End of code
}
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

All the comments in this code were one line comments. One line comments start with either &lt;tt&gt;;&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;//&lt;/tt&gt; and a blank space, then the comment. We could just as easily have used &lt;tt&gt;//&lt;/tt&gt; for comments in that script instead of &lt;tt&gt;;&lt;/tt&gt;. All one line comments end at the end of the line they start on.

=== Multi Line Comments ===
Multi line comments span multiple lines. They start wherever a &lt;tt&gt;/*&lt;/tt&gt; is placed in the code and ends wherever there is a &lt;tt&gt;*/&lt;/tt&gt; in the code.


{|
|-
|
&lt;source lang=&quot;mirc&quot;&gt;
alias addnum {

/*
Are $1 and $2 numbers?
Was addnum called as a command or an identifier?
Should the number be negative?
*/

if ($$1 isnum) &amp;&amp; ($$2 isnum) {
$iif($isid,return,echo) $iif($prop == neg,$calc(-1 * ($1 + $2)),$calc($1 + $2))
}
}
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

Using multi-line comments, we achieved the same effect as the one line comments, but in one multi line comment.

== Command Prefixes ==
There are three types of prefixes that are placed in front of commands, and one prefix placed before identifiers, variables, and operators.

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;1&quot; class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!colspan=&quot;3&quot; |Command Prefixes
|-
!Prefix
!What it does
!Example
|-
|//
|Forces mIRC to evaluate identifiers and variables on the command line.
|&lt;tt&gt;//echo -a $chan&lt;/tt&gt;
|-
|.
|Silences the output from commands like &lt;tt&gt;/timer&lt;/tt&gt;.
|&lt;tt&gt;/.timer 1 1 echo -a hi&lt;/tt&gt;
|-
|!
|Forces mIRC to use the original command, instead of any alias.
|&lt;tt&gt;/!msg $chan hi&lt;/tt&gt;
|-
|}

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;1&quot; class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!colspan=&quot;3&quot; |Control Codes
|-
!Prefix
!What it does
!Example
|-
|!
|Is the same thing as saying &lt;tt&gt;if (%var/$id == $null)&lt;/tt&gt;. Can also be used to mean NOT; e.g &lt;tt&gt;if (b !isnum)&lt;/tt&gt;.
|if (!%var)
|-
|}

== Control Codes ==
Control codes are special characters that are placed in text to modify the look of text.

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;1&quot; class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!colspan=&quot;3&quot; |Identifier/Variable/Operator Prefixes
|-
!Code
!Effect on Text
!Example
|-
|Ctrl+K
|Changes the color of text.
|&lt;code&gt;�9This is green text.� This is not.&lt;/code&gt; produces: &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;This is green text.&lt;/font&gt; This is not.
|-
|Ctrl+B
|Makes font bold.
|&lt;code&gt;�This is bold text.� This is not.&lt;/code&gt; produces: '''This is bold text.''' This is not.
|-
|Ctrl+U
|Makes font underlined.
|&lt;code&gt;�This is underlined text.� This is not.&lt;/code&gt; produces: &lt;u&gt;This is underlined text.&lt;/u&gt; This is not.
|-
|Ctrl+O
|Makes text after the code but before the next control code plain text.
|&lt;code&gt;�This is plain text.� This is not.&lt;/code&gt; produces: This is plain text. '''This is not.'''
|-
|}

If you've made it this far, congratulations for making it through this long chapter! You can now make some basic mIRC scripts, and you should understand a few of the concepts required to script. If you're ready, you can go on to the next chapter.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Lokiclock, I don't understand why you created a new plane for the touch sensor.  Why not just add a property to the existing floor and use that?

Also, what sort of problems are you having with jumping?  The tutorial isn't very clear beyond the part about jumping in mid-air.  There are non-pythonic solutions to some problems posed by the game engine (although not many!)... this might be one of them.

-&gt; (Non-Python) Possible solution to jumping:

1) Give all ground objects an identical property (say &quot;ground&quot;)

2) Create a cube under the player (about the size/location of the jumping limits) and parent it to said player--the cube '''must''' not be touching the player.  Bad things happen with constant ghost collision, namely slowing the game down a lot.

3) Make cube ghost

4) Give cube a collision sensor for property ground

5) Connect cube collision sensor to jump controller (make it an &quot;AND&quot; controller)

-Note: You should probably make the jump-cube an inverted pyramid (longer on the z axis) depending on how you want jumping to be restricted.  This would make it so you couldn't jump off walls unless they were directly below you, or very close to you (thus the up-side down pyramid).

Malaz


:The problem arises later on that you can jump infinitely in mid-air. So you have to link it to a collision with some ground object. If you just link it to the cubes, you end up being able to jump while touching any side of the cube, not just the top. You can still kind of jump while being almost on the collision platforms and not having to necessarily be on top of them, which is the problem I could not solve within the engine. I am not sure your jump-cube pyramid would to the trick. I suppose it's worth a shot. You'd have to make the cube send a message that the player requires as a jump condition, because I don't think you could have the jump cube's collision connect directly to the player's jump business. [[User:LokiClock|Loki Clock]] ([[User talk:LokiClock|talk]]) 09:02, 11 March 2008 (UTC)


::Actually, you can just directly link the collision sensor (of the jump-pyramid) to the jumping controller.  You just have to select both the pyramid and the player, then you can link between objects. --[[User:Malaz|Malaz]] ([[User talk:Malaz|talk]]) 00:40, 12 March 2008 (UTC)

:::A much simpler way is to simply use a '''-Z''' ray sensor, rather than the whole pyramid-collision thing.  It works just as well with a bit of tweaking, and is probably faster.--[[Special:Contributions/207.81.49.53|207.81.49.53]] ([[User talk:207.81.49.53|talk]]) 19:04, 25 March 2008 (UTC)</text>

A sector of a circle can be thought of as a pie piece. In the picture below, a sector of the circle is shaded yellow.

[[Image:Sector_of_Circle.jpg]]


To find the area of a sector, find the area of the whole circle and then multiply by the angle of the sector over 360 degrees.

&lt;math&gt;A = \pi r^2 \cdot \frac{\theta}{360}&lt;/math&gt;




A more intuitive approach can be used when the sector is half the circle. In this case the area of the sector would just be the area of the circle divided by 2.

== [[Fundamentals of Transportation]] and Computer Networks ==
I have been skimming your work and even if I don't know the particular application to traffic, something do have some parallel in computer network traffic and optimization. Costs, route optimization, queueing and many other aspects, this is something that even if a bit far from the book topic would probably merit some reference, perhaps on the introduction.
I will take a look on the math on the work to see how portable it is, great work, thx for your contributions...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 01:27, 12 March 2008 (UTC)

== WCI 2011 : Accelerating Wikibooks : Would like to discuss! ==


Hello!

I will be delivering a Talk at the Wikimedia Conference India 2011 on the topic of &quot;Accelerating Wikibooks&quot;.

Over the next few days, I aim to make the proposal more and more wholesome and relevant. I'd like to discuss with you about the proposal and hope you can recommend me a few names on Wikibooks with whom I can discuss this.

I'd be very happy if you could discuss the proposal at [[User:Thewinster/Accelerating_Wikibooks]]

--[[User:Thewinster|Thewinster]] ([[User talk:Thewinster|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Thewinster|contribs]]) 08:20, 26 September 2011 (UTC)
=== Summary of the proposal ===

This is not a summary of the final talk, only a tentative guideline.

* Create Roadmaps for a book
* Define Learning Outcomes
* Annotate and Discuss new content available from around the web.
* Minor tweaks and fixes which concentrate on crowdsourcing.
* Identifying Small Contribution that advance a book and designing good UIs and triggers according to B.J. Fogg's Behavior Change Model, 8 Step Design Process. The paper can be found here at [http://www.bjfogg.com/design_files/page8_1.pdf Persuasive Design : Eight Step Process by B. J. Fogg]

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Negative effects of real estate flipping===
Many experts blame the [[US real estate bubble]] in [[2004]] and [[2005]] on investor speculation and &quot;irrational&quot; flipping.  Very low interest rates were a root cause, but speculation and flipping compounded the bubble.  Although the practice of flipping existed long before the real estate bubble, it became more rampant and widespread in those years. Flipping was so popular nationally that some [[DIY]] television programs detailed the process. Flipping trends have historically ended in disaster, such as during the [[Florida land boom of the 1920s|Florida Real Estate Crash of the 1920s]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investopedia.com/features/crashes/crashes4.asp Crashes: The Florida Real Estate Craze&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[2006]] we see, reported by USNEWS on Wed June 14 2006, that the &quot;Housing bubble correction could be severe.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Source: usnews.com, Wed June 14 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Flipping can play a role in the [[gentrification]] of older communities. As flipping occurs more and more in a community, the total cost of living there can rise substantially, essentially forcing the local people, specifically the younger generations, to relocate.  During the real estate bubble, flipping and gentrification both have been linked to the mass migration of Californians to the (once much) less expensive areas of the surrounding states such as Arizona, Nevada, Texas, Oregon and Washington.  This migration of Californians caused further gentrification in the areas that they had moved to en masse. Areas such as [[Phoenix, AZ]] and [[Las Vegas, NV]] which were once very inexpensive to live in prior to the real estate bubble are now quite expensive.  The chain reaction continued (continues?), as the gentrified people of these cities had to find somewhere cheaper to live to maintain their standard of living, where they undoubtedly caused gentrification of their own.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

The other significant adverse financial aspect of the mentality of &quot;flipping&quot; is when interest rates increase. The resulting lack of sales, and major price depreciations (often far below) their previous increases, results in a flood of properties on the market at one time, not selling due to lack of buyers, causing a meltdown of a local market and potentially the economy as a whole.

===Positive effects of real estate flipping===
Although most arguments surrounding flipping tend to be negative, it is also possible to identify some benefits from the practice as well.

For example, &quot;rational&quot; flipping can encourage a rejuvenation and restoration of a previously decrepit neighborhood.  (Under the [[broken windows]] theory, an unkept house/area attracts a criminal element, which drives out those making a responsible living, which allows for more criminal element, and so on in a vicious downward cycle.)  The restoration creates jobs, particularly in construction, for locals and generates more sales (and sales taxes) to local vendors (initially those involved in selling construction materials).  The newly remodelled homes will then attract new populations and businesses to a region, encouraging more economic development, plus the remodelled homes' higher assessed values brings more [[property tax]] revenues to local governments, allowing for more improvements to the area and driving out the criminal element.

Even on a single home basis, flipping can have positive impacts (the house itself will be in better condition and last longer, and can be sold at a higher price, thus increasing its property tax assessed value, plus increased sales for goods and services related to property improvement and the related increase in sales taxes).

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Spaghettification.jpg|right|thumb|200px|An illustration of the effect that extreme gravitational forces would have on an astronaut as he approaches the black hole event horizon.]]
'''Spaghettification''' refers to the effect of extreme gravitational pressure on any particle or body of matter, in particular when exposed to the extreme forces of the black hole. Essentially, when a particle draws too close to the source of the powerful gravitational field, it is stretched into long thin shapes, like pasta.

The term was coined by Stephen Hawking in his book, ''A Brief History of Time'', where he likened this process to spaghetti. Much like other aspects of the black hole theory and model, this effect of drawing too close to a black hole remains untested, unobserved and unproven, and relates to areas of physics that remain largely unexplored, namely the concept of a force so powerful that no matter what components make up a piece of matter, it will be stretched further than is deemed by many to be within the realms of physical plausibility.

Many have speculated upon why it is, scientifically speaking, that spaghettification occurs when an object draws close to a black hole, but a generally accepted theory has been proposed. To understand this, one must consider the sheer strength of an object with such a high gravitational pull. One must also consider Newtonian gravitational theory, which states that:
#If you increase the mass of an object within a gravitational field, the gravitational pull in question will increase in power by the same amount.
#These factors become exponentially higher as the object draws closer to the source of the gravitational strength.

Bearing that in mind, one now must consider that:
#Black holes have extremely high masses, often many times that of the sun and other stars
#This mass is concentrated in a very small radius.
#Because of these factors, the gravitational force near a black hole is enormous...
#And all the above factors thereby contribute to the largeness of the gradient of the gravitational field across the object within the field as it draws closer and closer to the source.

Effects of this on the article in question are extreme. Spaghettification tears at the matter's very atomic structures, elongating them and stretching them until they are atomically and cellularly unrecognisable.

Spaghettification is also largely based on the positioning of the object, and the trajectory at which it approaches the source of the gravitational power. These factors cause variations on the way the gravity acts on the incoming matter, and spaghettification is caused based by the differences in the forces fronting the object in question.

== Ingredients ==
* one large raw [[Cookbook:bacon|bacon]] hock
* two [[Cookbook:egg|eggs]]
* green [[Cookbook:food color|food color]]
* blue food color

== Procedure ==
# Place the bacon hock in a pot of water. Add green food color (as much or as little as you like).*
# Bring to the boil and simmer for 60-90 mins.
# Remove the hock and let it cool a little.
# Carefully remove the skin leaving the fat layer intact.
# If the hock is the right degree of green, place on an oval platter. If not, return to pot and add color until the right degree is reached.
# Remove and place on an oval platter.
# Separate eggs.
# Poach the egg yokes in water with blue food color.*
# Poach the egg whites in uncolored water.
# Place the egg whites on platter with hock.
# Place the yokes on the whites.
# Serve using a tri-pronged fork.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;Use food color carefully and follow the manufactures guidelines.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Additional Types==

We have already seen the following types: tuple, list, integer, float, function and pid. We can check the type of an object by testing it. 
 
 1&gt; is_pid( self() ).
 true

If you wish to convert between types, lists are the lingua franca of types in Erlang so make it a list first on your way to something else.  Remember, type conversion is not a parallel-safe operation. 

Some additional types are: port and reference.

A port is a connection to the external world. Typically ports generate and/or consume bit streams. Binary data is considered untyped data in Erlang. (See BitSyntax).

A reference is a globally unique symbol and is generated with:

 19&gt; make_ref(). 
 #Ref&lt;0.0.0.88&gt;

A reference is only useful when a unique tag is needed across all connected processes. Do not confuse the term reference with a references in C, which points to data. An Erlang reference is only a unique tag.
 

===Erlang Has No Boolean Type===

Erlang has no Boolean type. It has the atoms (true and false) which are generated by certain functions and expected by certain functions like guards and list comprehensions. The function: is_constant() generates either true or false.

We can test whether an object is a constant. 
 
 1&gt; is_constant(a) 
 true
 2&gt; is_atom(a).
 true

Because atoms are represented as constant numbers, atoms are constants.

 is_constant(A). 
 ** 1: variable 'A' is unbound **
 5&gt; A=1.
 1
 6&gt; is_constant(A).
 true

Theoretically, because the Boolean type is not built in, it should make it easier to let Erlang compute with alternate types of logic, {true, false, null} for instance.

The page not the book - I removed various snippets of this today but it seems like someone thinks it should be here.  There is too much in it for me to speedy it with a clear conscience (!) but I do not think that it is really part of the book itself nor Wikibooks in general - wikinews maybe.  Thanks --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 18:39, 19 February 2008 (UTC)
:{{del}} - This one should be deleted, because the entries aren't chronological, it is entirely stupid, and is not worth keeping. I suggest that a similar page be created, though, to address 2008, although this would probably became more of a current-event blog than anything. Thoughts? [[User:Laleena|Laleena]] ([[User talk:Laleena|talk]]) 21:56, 19 February 2008 (UTC)
:{{comment}} - Three out of four entries are not US history, and the remaining one isn't sufficiently notable for this book IMHO. However, shouldn't this issue be addressed by the book's authors (e.g. by raising it on the talk page)? [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:27, 20 February 2008 (UTC)
:{{del}} - I think far too much emphasis is placed on current events in the US History book. The Clinton and Bush presidencies both have more content than the chapter on World War II, for example. It is a history textbook, and material that is in there should have significant consequences for what will become the history of the United States. As awesome as astronauts are, in 50 years STS-122 probably isn't going to be in the history books (and especially one that [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=neil+armstrong doesn't mention Neil Armstrong]). And as much as I admire Benazir Bhutto, she probably doesn't have much of a place in American history. Like Herby said, this is more a current events page than anything - not history.

:{{comment}} I agree with [[User:Webaware]], and with some of the negative comments on the content but it doesn't violate the Wikibooks requirements it seems only to be badly placed, and overstatement of the facts/events beyond the book scope.  It should be up for the people working on the book to decide what to do with the content. If anyone actively working on the book, even the editor that added the content, votes Keep it will have my support.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 20:21, 20 February 2008 (UTC)

***Without going into inter-project politics, this is a situation that simply shouldn't have happened in terms of content incompatibility with Wikinews.  But Wikinews doesn't need to deal with these items as it is already covered in existing news stories on Wikinews, and while &quot;current&quot; for a history book, these are hardly &quot;new&quot; events developed enough to make a good Wikinews article.  Licensing is an issue, but not the only one.--[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] ([[User talk:Robert Horning|talk]]) 14:04, 27 February 2008 (UTC)
*{{del}} - Trying to tie in a history book of any kind with the present day always brings in a strong political bias that is incredibly difficult to fight.  While not as random as this page, [[US History/Contents/Iran]] is also fraught with NPOV problems and far too narrow of a focus compared to the other parts of this book.  I also fail to see how the contents of this page can be fashioned together into something that is comparable to the rest of this Wikibook.&lt;p&gt;On the whole I hate it when individual parts of a Wikibook get brought up for deletion on this page without clearly demonstrating that some sort of discussion about the topic (deletion of this page) wasn't at least attempted within the confines of those developing this Wikibook... for example, [[Talk:US History/Contents]] would have been a good place to make an attempt to discuss deleting this page.  Yes, I know this talk page isn't exactly active, but perhaps that is a problem when pages like this are bypassed and discussion never is even attempted.  For this reason, I tend to vote to keep sub-pages, hoping that those developing the book (this seems like one that several people are vested in for development) can come to a concensus.&lt;p&gt;All of this said, and barring a &quot;jurisdictional issue&quot; policy fight over nominating sub-pages for deletion on the VfD page, I fail to see what this page offers to enhance this book.  Those who are trying to write these pages should be instead encouraged to write a page on 21st Century U.S. History... something that isn't done very well at the moment.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] ([[User talk:Robert Horning|talk]]) 14:04, 27 February 2008 (UTC)
*:{{comment}} I agree with you in general, Rob, but this book doesnt really have a community to speak of. I'm hard pressed to find any productive edits to this book by registered contributors. Nearly all of the recent edits have been anonymous, and most of them have focused on these later chapters. You can't ask a book community to make a decision about page deletion if there isn't a book community in the first place. Plus, the people who have been editing have been working this page and pages like it, so it's unlikely that they would vote to delete it no matter how inappropriate for the book the rest of the WB community finds it. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 20:11, 27 February 2008 (UTC)
*::My concern here is that such an action wasn't even attempted.  If a discussion attempt was started and then sat unanswered for a period of time.  This should be up to the person trying to get feedback, but certainly waiting more than a day or two minimum... perhaps much longer as this isn't exactly a brand new wikibook.  The assumption that there isn't a community willing to discuss the issue tends to be self-fulfilling if you never even try in the first place, and you might actually be surprised and get some real feedback.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] ([[User talk:Robert Horning|talk]]) 01:41, 1 March 2008 (UTC)
:[[Image:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px]] '''Delete''' - I mostly agree with Rob here, but this module has little redeeming value. Also, the very concept of &quot;and beyond&quot; in a ''history'' textbook is probably dubious at best. While it might be part of a textbook, I'm not sure how this might be reconciled with [[WB:OR]], which might prohibit [[w:WP:CRYSTAL|WP:CRYSTAL]]-type content. While this is an interesting policy question that should be discussed, this page should be deleted regardless. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:58, 1 March 2008 (UTC)

== Overview ==

Mr. '''''Borgin''''', a stooping man with greasy hair and an oily manner, is one of the owners of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Borgin and Burkes|Borgin and Burkes]], the Dark magic supplies store in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Knockturn Alley|Knockturn Alley]]. The other owner is, or was, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Caractacus Burke|Caractacus Burke]].

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] ===

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] enters Borgin and Burkes accidentally, on his first attempt to use [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Floo Powder|Floo powder]]. Seeing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]] approaching, he hides, and eavesdrops while Draco and his father [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lucius Malfoy|Lucius]] are waited on by Mr. Borgin. In a particularly oily manner, Borgin suggests that it is a pity that blood purity counts for so little these days, expresses surprise that Mr. Malfoy is selling rather than buying today, commends Draco on his interest in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Hand of Glory|Hand of Glory]], and finally bows the two of them obsequiously out of his shop. He then returns into the back rooms of the store, giving Harry the chance to make his way out unimpeded.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

Harry, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] follow Draco Malfoy, who has slipped away from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Narcissa Malfoy|his mother]], to Borgin and Burkes. There, we overhear Draco demanding assistance in fixing something, a demand to which Borgin expresses some reluctance. Draco shows him something to inspire his cooperation. Draco also says that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fenrir Greyback|Fenrir]] will be stopping by periodically to ensure that he is doing his job. After he leaves the store, Hermione goes in to try and find out what Draco had been interested in; Borgin is uncommunicative, though he does mention that one necklace she looks at is priced at one and a half thousand Galleons. Finally he ushers her out of the shop, and puts up the Closed sign.

While we hear that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Marvolo Riddle|Tom Riddle]] had been employed some years earlier at Borgin and Burkes, we do not see Mr. Borgin in relation to that employment.

== Understanding the Curve Modifier ==
{{B3D:N2P/ForVersion|2.67}}
The ''curve modifier'' lets you use a line curve shape to deform a mesh. The mesh will follow every twist and turn of the curve as far as it can bend, depending on how many vertices it has—clearly, the more vertices there are, the more faithfully it can follow the curve.

The curve modifier is also very easy to confuse yourself with if you’re not careful in how you set it up. A common situation is you try to move the deformed object in one direction, but it ends up moving in a completely different direction! This happens when you choose a deformation axis that doesn’t correspond to the predominant orientation of the points in the curve.

There are in fact some predictable rules that govern the behaviour of the curve modifier. Once you understand these rules, you shouldn’t need to keep trying different things at random to try to achieve the effect you want, you should be able to go straight for it.

=== A Simple Example ===
[[File:Blender267GridPlusPath.png|thumb|Grid plus path objects, ready for action]]
Let’s do an illustrative example to clarify things. Start a new Blender document; delete the default cube, and add a grid object instead, with the default 10×10 subdivision to give it plenty of vertices that can be deformed. Also add a path curve on top of it—this will give you a NURBS curve with 5 points, initially in a straight line. The result should look like at right.

{{Clear}}
[[File:Blender267GridPlusPathDeform.png|thumb|Grid deformed by path, default settings]]
Now {{B3D:N2P/Do|RMB}} on the grid, go to the Modifiers Context [[File:Blender255ObjectModifiersContextButton.png]] in the Properties window, and add a new Curve modifier. (In version 2.63, you need to select object in modifier settings, or the grid will not move, so select object as your new path that we just created.)

The grid object should immediately jump a little way in the direction of the negative X-axis. Why?

{{Clear}}
{{B3D:N2P/Note|'''Rule One:''' The offset of the ''first'' point on the curve ''in its local coordinate system'' is also used to offset the origin of the deformed shape.}}

If you select the curve and {{B3D:N2P/Do|TAB}} into Edit mode, you should see that, while the origin of the curve’s local coordinate system (the fat orange dot) is in the middle of the curve, the first point (the one at the end of curve in the same direction that the “centipede legs” are pointing) has a negative X-coordinate. Select just that point, and from the Snap menu {{B3D:N2P/Do|SHIFT|SKEY}}, do “Cursor to Selected”. Now {{B3D:N2P/Do|TAB}} back into Object mode, and from Object→Transform do “Origin to 3D Cursor”. This will adjust the origin of the curve’s local coordinate system to that first point (keeping the curve itself in the same place), whereupon the grid object should jump back to its original location.

{{B3D:N2P/Note|'''Corollary to Rule One:''' You will make things a lot simpler for yourself if you change the origin of the deforming curve to coincide with its start point.}}

You can of course freely move around, add and delete the other points. Just be sure to keep that first point always at the origin of the curve.

[[File:Blender267DeformModifierSettings.png|thumb]]
Now look at the settings for the Curve modifier. Notice those six buttons under “Deformation Axis:”?

{{B3D:N2P/Note|'''Rule Two:''' The Deformation Axis is interpreted according to the '''local coordinate system of the deforming curve'''.}}

{{Clear}}
When a path curve is created, all its points initially lie along its local X-axis. Since the default for the Deformation Axis is “X”, all works pretty much as you expect. If the two do not coincide, then weird things happen when you try moving things around.

If you ''really'' want to mess around, you could go into Edit mode on the curve, select all its points, rotate them to, say, orient them along the local Y-axis, then get out of Edit mode, select the deformed mesh, and change the Deformation Axis on its modifier to Y, and things should still work consistently. But why bother?

{{B3D:N2P/Note|'''Corollary to Rule Two:''' For simplicity, ensure that the Deformation Axis corresponds to the primary orientation of the points of the deforming curve ''in its local coordinate system''. Otherwise, the deformed mesh will be ''rotated from its undeformed orientation'', and will ''go off at a completely different angle'' when you try to move it.}}

So long as you obey the above rules, you can move, rotate and scale the deforming curve ''in object mode only'' as much as you like, and the deformation will still behave in a reasonable fashion. Of course, you can do what you like to the deformed mesh in object or edit modes, and this will still be true.

{{B3D:N2P/Note|'''Rule Three:''' The effect of the deformation corresponds to the relative positions of deforming curve and deformed mesh in world coordinates.}}

[[File:Blender267GridPlusPathDeform2.png|thumb|Fiddling with the deforming path]]
Select the curve, {{B3D:N2P/Do|TAB}} into Edit mode, select the middle point, and move it a little to one side, as at right. You should see the grid mesh immediately bend in a corresponding way.

Now {{B3D:N2P/Do|TAB}} into Object mode, select the mesh, and move {{B3D:N2P/Do|GKEY}} it around: notice how it tries to follow the shape of whatever part of the curve lies nearest to it. What shape does it take when you move it off an end of the curve? How about to one side?

Alternatively, you can similarly drag the curve instead of the mesh, and the same thing will happen: it is only their relative positions that governs the actual deformation.

Also try changing the scaling radius {{B3D:N2P/Do|ALT|SKEY}} and tilt angle {{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL|TKEY}} on particular curve points: note how the former causes the deformed mesh to get wider and narrow at those points, while the latter makes it tilt from side to side.

== Another Example ==
{{B3D:N2P/ForVersion|2.4''x''}}
=== Setting up your Mesh ===
While this example will be done with a cone primitive, you can use the default cube or another shape of your choosing so long as it can be loop subdivided along the axis you wish to curve.  Delete the default cube if you're not going to use it as your base mesh, and add your chosen primitive.  In this example, we'll be using a Cone.

[[Image:ConeCurve1.jpg|thumb|220px|left| A basic cone in Edit Mode]]

*Set your view to the X-Y Axis (Top View) by pressing '''NUM7''', the 7 on the keypad.
*Press '''SPACE''' &gt; ''Add'' &gt; ''Mesh'' &gt; ''Cone''
*A smaller number of vertices are needed, since this cone will become just the tip of the finished shape.
*Left Click and drag to reduce the number of vertices to 12, then click the Ok button. (Note: On newer versions of Blender you will have to hit '''F6''' to get to this option.)
*Press '''TAB''' to enter Edit Mode, or choose Edit Mode from the bottom of the 3D viewport. 
*Switch views to the Z-X Axis by pressing '''NUM1''' (1 on the keypad).  Your screen should now look something like the picture at left.
*If your cone is selected (one or more faces are pink, one or more vertices are yellow) press '''AKEY''' (Select/Deselect All) until they are deselected.
*Select the point of your Cone with the '''RMB''' and drag it upwards with the blue arrow.  You can hold down the '''CONTROL''' key if you want to contstrain the scaling to set units.  For this example, 5 squares of height were added to the cone.

=== Extruding the Cone ===
[[Image:ConeCurve2.jpg|thumb|100px|right|Extruded cone]]
*Still in Edit Mode, press the '''NUM8''' repeatedly to rotate your view to the underside of your cone.  Select the center vertex of the circle, and hold down '''CONTROL''', then press the '''+KEY''' on the keypad.  This will select all of the adjacent vertices of the base.  (You could also select the whole cone '''AKEY''' and deselect the top point by holding down '''SHIFT''' and selecting it with the '''RMB''' to achieve the same effect.)
*Go to front view by pressing '''NUM1'''
*Extrude the base of the cone by pressing the '''EKEY''' and choosing ''Region''. 
*Pull the new vertices away from the cone a distance and click the '''LMB''' to set them in place.
*Press the '''SKEY''' and widen the new base of the cone a bit.
*Continue extruding the cone, widening the base after each extrusion until you have at least 5 segments.  The more segments you have, the smoother your curved cone will be. 
*Another way of adding segments is with the Loop Subdivide tool.  '''CONTROL''' + '''RKEY''' to bring up the purple placement ring, then '''LMB''' twice to add a subdivision. 
*On Blender 2.6, the best way to do it is by selecting the side edges and subdivide them by pressing '''WKEY''' then clicking on ''Subdivide'', after that you can select the number of cuts you want.
*You may find that your cone is quite large indeed now, so switch back to Object Mode ('''TAB''') and resize it with the scale tool.  While you're in Object Mode, try stretching the cone out a bit to make a nice long needle.

=== Making a Curve ===
[[Image:ConeCurve3.jpg|thumb|100px|left|]]
*In Object Mode, Z-X orientation ('''NUM1'''), make sure you have nothing selected and press '''SPACE''' &gt; ''Add'' &gt; ''Curve'' &gt; ''Bezier Curve''
*Rotate your curve 90° (holding down the '''CONTROL''' key to make it rotate in 5° intervals) Note- or just R-KEY and then type 90, so that it lines up with your cone.  Move it off to one side so that its not hidden by your cone.
*Grab the center vertex of each end and adjust its rotation ('''RKEY''') until you have a nice shallow dome shape.  
*Scale the curve in size ('''SKEY''') until it is larger than your cone.
*Look at the panel below the 3D space, you should see the Editing panel is selected  [[Image:Blenderediting.png]] ('''F9KEY''')  Just below the panel buttons will be a window called Link and Materials.  If your curve is selected, you will see a box with OB:Curve in it. This means the name of the curve is &quot;Curve&quot;.  This is important because that exact name is needed to deform the cone.


'''Noob Note:'''{{B3D:N2P/ForVersion|2.69}}I could not find what this section talks about.  However, the name of the curve is in at least two other places:  Press '''NKEY''' and in the Item panel is the name of the curve.  OR in the Outline panel (usually top right) you can see which item is highlighted and read the name.  Mine was named BezierCurve.


{{Clear}}

===Applying the Curve to the Mesh===
[[Image:ConeCurve4.jpg|thumb|120px|right|Modified cone]]
*Select the cone in Object Mode.  In the Editing panel window ('''F9KEY'''), the rightmost panel has two tabs, Modifiers and Shapes.  Choose the Modifiers tab if it is not already selected.
*Click the ''Add Modifier'' button and choose ''Curve'' from the popup list.
*In the OB: box, type the exact name of your Bézier Curve (it will be &quot;Curve&quot; without the quotations if you left it as the default.)
*Notice the six buttons underneath the OB: and VGroup: boxes (in the Modifier Panel).  They are '''X, Y, Z, -X, -Y, -Z'''.  They affect which plane the curve deforms.  For this example, you'll need to select the '''Y''' button.
*Move your Cone so that it overlays the curve in the 3D space screen, and notice how it follows the Bézier Curve.
*You can modify the Bézier Curve as well as the cone repeatedly until you are happy with the design.
*If you switch to Edit Mode, notice that the cone returns to its straight orientation.
*To apply the deformation to the mesh permanently, in the Modifiers panel, click the ''Apply'' button next to your Curve modifier.

'''Noob Note:''' In more recent versions (I am using 2.69) the Modifier panel is found in the Properties Window (usually the one on the right) with a little wrench icon in the row of icons  [[File:Blender255ObjectModifiersContextButton.png]].  Click this and choose ''curve'' and then enter the name of your curve in the ''Object:'' box.  I then had to select the '''X''' button, not the '''Y''' button as it says above.  I don't know why.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Seascarf.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The sea scarf]]

This scarf was designed with the California coastline in mind.  Think of an outdoor restaurant table by the beach at sunset, or a stroll through the sand during a cool offshore breeze, or maybe just imagine getting strangled by a fashionable piece of seaweed.  Suitable for sweater weather in spring and fall.

== Materials ==
*1 6mm hook (U.S. size J)
*2 skeins Bernat Bamboo Natural Blends, Dill color 161092
*1 skein Caron Pizazz ribbon yarn, Meadow color 0005, article PZ1000

== Construction ==
[[Image:Seascarfconstruction.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Crochet can be much simpler than it looks.  This is a basic pattern using only double crochet and chain stitch.  The ribbon is woven in afterward.]]

Only two stitches are needed to make this scarf: chain stitch and double crochet.  Actually the pattern is quite simple; it's a basic offset filet.  The fancy effect is created by weaving ribbon yarn through the gaps after the crochet work is done.

The yarn is 88% bamboo, which looks like raw silk and behaves something like rayon.

== Instructions ==
*First row: chain stitch 154, plus 2 for the turning chain.
*Second row: double stitch 2, chain stitch 2.  Repeat 38 times.  At end of row, double stitch 2.
*Third row: chain stitch 4.  Make two double stitches wrapping around the previous chain, then chain stitch 2.  Repeat.  At end of row, chain stitch twice followed by 1 double crochet into the previous row turning chain.
*Repeat rows 2 and 3 for as long as there's enough yarn to complete a row.

Should make 10 rows total, with 9 sets of gaps between them.  If the yarn runs short then it can be a 9 row scarf (not much different).  Gauge is not important as long as it remains even.

[[Image:Seascarfdetail.jpg|right|thumb|225px|Weaving the ribbons in a staggered pattern creates a diagonal effect.]]
Measure ribbon yarn into strips two feet longer than the crochet.  Cut enough pieces to fill each row.  Weave ribbons through gaps, taking care to minimize twist.  Secure at endswith a simple knot.  Stagger the ribbon weave to create a diagonal effect.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Why this should be set to the Wiktionary instead to the Japanese book? This is a conjugation table like in other languages and have to support the learner by learning Japanese. What does this have to do with the Wiktionary??? Maybe you can do it also to the Wiktionary, but it have to stay here too! I personally hate it not finding short grammar summaries and conjugation tables! That's why I created this one.

Hi. My name is Ciarán &amp; I've just joined.  I have a strong interest in Irish &amp; general history, &amp; am currently editing the Wikijunior book on Ireland.  I'm very new to this, so please bear with me for any breaches of the rules or etiquette.  However, please feel free to send any constructive criticism my way.

:Hi there! Always glad to see newcomers to Wikibooks. My first bit of constructive criticism is to sign using four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;). If you add that at the end of your posts to talk pages, the software will turn it into a signature (can be customized via [[Special:Preferences]]) and a timestamp. This makes it easier to see who said what, and when.

:They may only be on Wikibooks, however if you can tell us which images you require, someone can copy them to Commons if the image license permits it.

You could even perform the copy yourself, using the [http://tools.wikimedia.de/~magnus/commonshelper.php Move-to-commons assistant], but take care to read the license tags on the images to ensure that they will be compliant with Commons' requirements.

== How to point out incorrect and simply bad information? ==

I am new to the &quot;backstage&quot; of Wiki. I recently followed a cite that was provided to a beginner that went to a page in Music Theory that had a chart of Chord Types. I know that Wiki is an evolving process of contribution and I see that things can be edited in an article. The problem here is that this rather important aspect of music theory is so bad that simple editing is not a practical alternative. 

There are errors in the chart itself. The explanations are past the level of amateurish and delve very deeply into beyond amusing. The explanations are opinion that is not based on fact or research. 

This page may technically pass the copyright aspect of Wiki, but the charts are obviously taken from some book that is designed for a specific and limited genre of music theory (most likely one on Jazz Modal Music Theory) and it is presented verbatim as if it was for general music theory and for universal use. There is information in the chart that has little if any relevance to general music theory. I could go on and on, but you can take any part of this page and find constant questionable and outright wrong information. 

My question is: How does one go about correcting this? I am new to Wiki in general and specifically I am only now aware of the Wiki Books part of the overall project. I am not new to music theory and can state that this article would not be published by any publisher that had editors to look at the material. It is simply not helpful to the study of music. It is an amateur's opinion about some cut and paste information that he discovered.

SO, How does one go about starting to get this corrected? Simple edits will replace practically all the text in the article. I tried to find a place to comment on this page but was unsuccessful, that may be to my lack of experience with Wiki, and if so, please direct me there. I will help, but I am hesitant to edit this to such a magnitude as needed with this article without having some input from Wiki as to the best and most accurate way to do this. Please help me to find a way to correct this page. 

Thank you --[[User:Observer|Observer]] ([[User talk:Observer|talk]]) 14:54, 3 February 2008 

:The best approach is to correct the information yourself and if someone objects to your changes to reach an consensus with that other person or persons providing as much evidence of how valid your argumentation is, if you fail in getting your view validated and you are certain that your claims are valid you will need to request support from the community at large, this is a very hard process but in the event you are correct time is on your side even if you decide not to invest any real effort into it, all you need to do is make you side known, for that you can use the &quot;discuss this page&quot; link.
:Attempt to avoid at any cost to take an antagonistic stance on disagreements. One can disagree but still respect the opposing view point (and seems you have made some effort there). Hope this helps...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 21:29, 3 February 2008 (UTC)
== Book on Writing and Publishing Technical books ==

For my sins, I'm running a workshop at a conference (SPA2008) in March this year on the above topic.  Having been busy with the XQuery book I'm working on, it occurred to me to create a Wikibook on this topic to support the workshop.  By 'book' , I mean the creation of that complex of resources - websites , collaboration spaces, online as well as published material.  One topic of course is the role of Wikibooks. My intention is to set up a framework, then to invite the many attendees who already have books to their name to contribute their top hints before the workshop. We would use the wikibook during the conference to capture workshop outputs and I would hope the book would continue to be developed beyond. This is all a bit recursive of course but how do the experts think this would work, and are there any existing books along these lines -  I haven't seen anything in my search so far but may well have missed something. 

[[User:ChrisWallace|ChrisWallace]] ([[User talk:ChrisWallace|talk]]) 19:22, 23 January 2008 (UTC)

We have several wikibooks that discuss collaboration:
* [[Wiki Science]]
* [[WikiSci]]
* [[Change Issues in Curriculum and Instruction/Wikis in the Classroom]]
* [[Future Teachers Meet Wiki]]
* [[Emerging Instructional Technology]]

We also have several wikibooks that discuss paper books.
* [[Basic Book Design]]
* [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Vocational/Bookbinding]]
* [[The Written Word]]
* [[Technical Book Development]] -- which I see was started by ChrisWallace. Great job -- way to [[Wikibooks:Be bold | be bold]]!

== Missing pictures ==

I've been browsing [[False Friends of the Slavist]], and notice that some of the images on the maps and some of the templates mentioned on the doc page are missing: see [[False Friends of the Slavist/Map mir]] and [[False Friends of the Slavist/Editing help]] for some examples. I don't remember these being missing last time I visited the pages. Is it possible that they got deleted in error? [[User:Zocky|Zocky]] ([[User talk:Zocky|talk]]) 08:17, 4 February 2008 (UTC)

:As far as I can tell, I don't see any explicit image/page deletions here.  Some of the templates being used here are rather complex and nested on multiple levels, so it may be the case of even a well-meaning user who made a mistake here and messed up the template heirarchy.  If there are some specific images/pages that you think should be undeleted, either make a note here or contact the project administrators more directly on [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Administrative Assistance]] if there may have been an inadvertent page deletion.

:Some of the apparently deleted templates on the editing help page simply are examples for what would be recommended to expand the array of pages being used in this guide.  In looking at those red-link pages, there hasn't been anything deleted or anything in the logs about those pages.  Those are templates that have never been created in the first place.  Again, if there is anything missing here, it certainly was a mistake and please help us to restore those pages by noting what you think may have been deleted.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] ([[User talk:Robert Horning|talk]]) 03:30, 9 February 2008 (UTC)

::Some of the images you are talking about may have been on Commons, and could have been deleted there.

:It would enable the spammers. By requiring you to have a valid and confirmed email set in order to email me through the wiki, we weed out the spammers (though it's not perfect, of course). If this ever changes, I suspect that many Wikimedians would disable the email feature. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:29, 12 February 2008 (UTC)

== Should every plant have its own Subject page? ==

On the Browse page under All Subjects there are separate entries for Echinacea, Garlic, Maple, Strawberry &amp; Cichorium intybus. If every plant gets promoted like this, won't the Browse page become overgrown? Surely subject pages just on Edible Plants and Ornamental Plants or something like that would be better. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 13:46, 12 February 2008 (UTC)

:As our number of subject pages increase, attempting to list all subjects like that will obviously become unfeasible. So, as the number gets larger, we will simply stop listing all subjects in a single page, and instead ensure that all subjects are properly organized hierarchically. That way, people can navigate from [[Subject:Major Subjects]] down through the tree to any page they want. 
:I'm not sure whether all plants should get their own subject pages, but it might be a worthwhile enterprise for the plants that appear in more then one place such as the gardening book and the cookbook. It really can be left up to user discretion, and if nobody creates anymore plant pages, then we don't need to worry about it. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 14:31, 12 February 2008 (UTC)

:G'day Adilbarlas, this page has a bunch of recipes on it, and they appear to be copied from other websites. Wikibooks is quite strict about [[Wikibooks:Copyright|copyright violations]], so the recipes that are from other websites with restricted rights must be removed from this page (or the page will be deleted). Also, the Cookbook prefers to keep recipes each on their own page, with cuisine pages discussing the cuisine but not getting bogged down in recipe details. See the [[Cookbook:Policy]] page, and perhaps discuss this further on the [[Cookbook talk:Table of Contents|Cookbook talk]] page.
:I'd recommend as a start that you remove the copyright recipes from this page ASAP, so that it doesn't get deleted. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 07:32, 10 February 2008 (UTC)

== Fair use again (again) ==

I was hoping to comment on the previous section before it got [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Reading_room/General&amp;curid=112405&amp;diff=1084360&amp;oldid=1083052 archived], but I was too late by just a bit. You can read it in the [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Archives/2007/December#Fair Use again|archives]], but there seemed to be consensus that we should not ''ban'' fair use, but that we should a) clean up what we have so far and b) think about enacting a policy restricting what fair use is allowed.

I had started to go through our fair use images, and they're truly a mess (even worse than I thought, and I was expecting a mess)! I have already started a suite of templates to complement {{tlxs|nld}}, but for images with no fair use rationale. I'm aiming for all the same templates for that process, but with slightly different language (you can also see I changed the colour scheme so the parallel processes will look similar but distinct. I'm not done yet, but I'll list them here once I have things completed.

Once that's done, I'd like us to please ''please'' enact a policy on fair use. [[Wikibooks:Fair use policy]] [[Wikibooks:Fair use policy/Alternate]] and [[Wikibooks:Media]] are the relevant proposals (I think). Given past discussion on this matter, we seem to agree on most points, so this ''should be easy to do''. Let's start talking about it now, so we can begin the cleanup as soon as possible. As of right now, I'm pretending that the process will mirror that for images with no license information (which is probably right on the money, but we can discuss that and change templates as needed). One of the main points that needs to be covered in the policy is what we need in the way of rationale for fair use. {{tlx|Fairuse rationale}} has very little, and will have to get changed based on what we decide.

Once we have a policy, I'll change templates to match as needed and we can get started on cleaning out our fair use images, which will be no small undertaking. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:30, 16 January 2008 (UTC)

Here are the templates so far. {{tlx|Fairuse rationale}} for the rationale. If you don't provide that, then it gets {{tlxs|nfur}} (which uses {{tlx|no rationale}} and puts images into [[:Category:Images with no fair use rationale]]) and you get {{tlxs|Image fairuse}} on your talk page. Language is currently you get 7 days to provide the rationale (preferably using the template) or it gets deleted. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:23, 16 January 2008 (UTC)

Another set for images with licenses we don't accept such as &quot;educational use&quot; or &quot;for wikibooks only&quot; and for which no fair use claim can be made. I included the possibility that the image might actually be under a free license, but that might be complicating matters, since I doubt it'll come up often. For this set, you tag images with {{tlxs|bfu}} (which uses {{tlx|Bad Fairuse}} and puts the images into [[:Category:Images with a bad fair use claim]]) and notify the user with {{tlx|Image badfairuse}}. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:22, 17 January 2008 (UTC)
:OK, well this apparently fell on deaf ears. I would like to begin tagging images and notifying users to comply with [[foundation:Resolution:Licensing policy]]. This policy requires:
:#Fair use is to be limited
:#Fair use (and indeed all other images) must be marked in a machine-readable format (this means using templates)
:#Fair use images are subject to deletion if they lack an appropriate rationale or if they are outside the limitations on fair use (#1)
:#Since we don't currently have a fair use policy enacted, all our fair use images which are unacceptable (#1 and #2) are to be deleted by March 23, 2008.
:Since this is a Foundation policy, I'm going to get started; no local policy is required. I'm going to begin tagging and notifying users on their talk pages. I will add templates whenever possible, and will be generous on point #1.
:Additionally, if there are users with many many fair use images that we should keep (ie. some wikibook would lose-out big-time if they all got deleted) then I will email them, but I can't take the time to email everyone. This will inevitably mean that many images will need to be deleted, per policy as referenced above. This is unfortunate, but is required for the good of the project, the good of the Foundation, and is simply a matter of following policy. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:42, 12 February 2008 (UTC)

== Help me name a book please ==

Hi, I'm a little new to this site, and I understand the markup language fine. I am going to start a wikibook about animating weapons for the game Counter-Strike Source. I'm confused on how to name the book title. Should it be &quot;Animating Weapons in Counter-Strike Source&quot;, or should it be part of a series on Counter-Strike Source with the book title &quot;Animating Weapons?&quot; Any help would be appreciated. [[User:Xz64|Xz64]] ([[User talk:Xz64|talk]]) 02:22, 9 February 2008 (UTC)

:Please do read [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks]] and the [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks/Unstable|unstable branch]] (feel free to participate on the discussion of the proposed revision), as a partial solution why not add a section to [[Video Game Design]] about game modding, where you can give a practical example on Counter-Strike Source and in special &quot;Animating Weapons&quot;.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 03:43, 9 February 2008 (UTC)

:I think that titles like &quot;Animating Weapons in Counter Strike&quot;, or even &quot;Counter Strike Weapons Animation&quot; would be fine titles. I personally don't think this should go into the [[Video Game Design]] book. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 22:05, 9 February 2008 (UTC)

::Okay, my idea is to put the book under the following structure:
*Department: Electronic Games
*Bookshelf: Source Engine
*Book: Counter-Strike Source
*Chapter: Weapon Animation
*Module: All modules of how to animate weapons

Is it acceptable? The source engine is the engine on which Counter-Strike Source is played. With Source Engine people could add books for Half-Life 2: Deathmatch and other games.

:::That sounds decent enough.

I'm not sure how many other contributors would be able to write other chapters in that book (of course, if you know other people who know this subject, you should invite them here to help!). Also, we're phasing out the bookshelves/departments, so you don't need to worry about that. Just use the {{tlx|Subject}} template, to put your book into one of the appropriate [[Subject:All Subjects|subject pages]]. I can help with that when you get started. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 16:26, 10 February 2008 (UTC)

== [[mw:Extension:SubPageList2]] ==

Remembering back to some time ago when we were asked if we had any technical wishes for Wikibooks that were not being fulfilled, I stumbled across this on Wikiversity. I haven't had time to read too far into the description of this extension, but this part looks interesting: &quot;Sub Page List 2 is an extension that automaticaly creates a list of the subpages of a page. The dynamic created list will be created automatically on every edit of the page where the SubPageList element is given.&quot; That sounds to me like something we can use to generate dynamic TOCs, and make it easier to watch every page of a book. It has some rather confusing flaws, but we could potentially get someone to adopt it and get it up to snuff. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:59, 3 February 2008 (UTC)

== Logo Updates ==

I'm not sure how many people here are still paying attention to the ongoing logo selection process at meta, but we're getting to a point now where involvement needs to be increased. Specifically, there are two discussion topics right now that will determine how this process is going to continue:
#[[m:Talk:Wikibooks/Logo#Time_to_Move_On?]]
#[[m:Talk:Wikibooks/Logo#Final_Timeline]]
The first is a discussion about when to end the initial submissions phase, which has been open now for some time. Of the few people who discussed the issue, most people agree that we should end the submissions phase soon, and many people are looking at the date March 15th. I apologize for not advertising that discussion better, I was under the mistaken impression that more people were reading the talk pages at meta. The second discussion is an attempt to finalize a complete timeline for the remainder of the logo selection process. If we move at a relatively quick pace, we could have a conclusion by early summer. That may be too fast, however, and so we may wish to slow some portions of the process down. That is all up for discussion at this point. Anyway, I encourage all wikibookians to get involved with this discussion, especially since the first voting rounds are going to begin soon. Finally, any people who are multilingual, we are going to need to get messages out to the other wikibooks language projects to alert them that the submissions phase is ending, and that the voting phase is about to begin. Anybody who could help with that effort would be much appreciated. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 17:04, 18 February 2008 (UTC)

== Structuring my Book Project ==

I am fairly new to the Wiki world, but I understand the basic building of pages and such. My question is of a conceptual nature. What I want to do is create a community where ESL teachers can leave lesson ideas/materials for other teachers to adapt and use. I want the main page to be a list of the different learning areas (e.g. listening, speaking, grammar, etc.), with links listed under each area that will take the user to different materials that have been added. For example, I want to find materials pertaining to listening. I find the &quot;listening&quot; category and choose among the materials that are linked under that category. Again, my problem is conceptualizing how I would make that possible. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.  -- [[TESOL Materials]] &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Stevesilsbee|Stevesilsbee]] ([[User talk:Stevesilsbee|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Stevesilsbee|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

:This sounds like a very interesting project. As a preface, if you are interesting in creating a general &quot;community&quot;, or if you are interested in using all sorts of learning materials, not just textbooks, then you will probably have more luck at [[v:|Wikiversity]] then you will here at wikibooks. Wikibooks is focused primarily on textbooks, not all the other materials that you would need to run a course. However, good courses require textbooks for the students, and even training manuals for the teachers, and those can certainly find a good home here.
:Now, on to some specific answers. If you want to separate out your materials into groups, there are several ways that you could do it. The first and most basic way would be to use a &quot;chapters&quot; format when you name pages. For instance:
*&quot;My Course/Reading/Material 1&quot;
*&quot;My Course/Listening/Material 25&quot;
*&quot;My Course/Grammar/Material 6&quot;
:Here, the page name explicitly says whether the material in question is for reading/listening/grammar, etc. However, this means that your material would likely be arranged by type, and not chronologically like would be expected on a course syllabus or in a textbook. Another method would be to arrange the material chronologically, and then use categories to specify whether a page was for grammary/spelling/listening or whatever. Your book/course could have categories &quot;Category:My Book/Listening&quot;, &quot;Category:My Book/Grammar&quot;, and so on, and when you put those category markers on your pages, the software will automatically produce lists of related pages for you. The category markers themselves could be located inside templates that say &quot;This book is for Reading&quot;, to not only keep pages organized, but also to keep readers informed of the purpose of each particular page (like a learning objective). I hope this helps you a little bit. I would love to hear more about your project if you have the time to talk about it. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 16:04, 20 February 2008 (UTC)

Thanks so much. Last night, I too decided that the page/project would work better at Wikiversity, so I moved it over there.

== Editing the name of a book ==

I am adding to a book entitled, &quot;Project Managment.&quot; The original creator of the Wikibook has misspelled the title. How can I edit the title to correct its spelling?
: Just move it to the new name. You might also want to click the &quot;what links here&quot; link in the left panel and fix any links to the old name.  --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 18:12, 22 February 2008 (UTC)
::But of course it's never just ''that'' easy, is it?  There's already a book called [[Project Management]], so you'd have to move it first, merge it in, or find a different name for yours. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 18:15, 22 February 2008 (UTC)
== Creating chapters/moving content ==

Hi...I had a [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Campus_fire_safety book] moved over from Wikipedia and I want to divide it into chapters (right now it is one long, running file...) but I'm not sure how to move the individual chapters onto new pages and then link them back to the table of contents.  Any help for this newbie would be appreciated! [[User:Ecomeau|Ecomeau]] ([[User talk:Ecomeau|talk]]) 11:31, 23 February 2008 (UTC)
:You should create a sub-page for each chapter.  Take a look at [[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Local_manuals_of_style|Local Manuals of Style]], it should be helpful.  After creating each sub-page, copy and paste the contents into the chapter.  It's a pain, but it will make your book look nicer. --[[User:Wes|Wes]] ([[User talk:Wes|talk]]) 13:57, 24 February 2008 (UTC)

== Dynamic page lists ==

G'day, it seems that WB is still running the oldest available version of DPL. Is there any reason for this, and if not, how can we get the latest version of DPL installed in its place? The major issue with keeping the old version is that it doesn't support ordering by title, only by date/time last categorised or edited. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:08, 23 February 2008 (UTC)
:Don't quote me on this, but i think there is either a performance or a caching problem with the newer versions. Down at wikinews, DPL2 has been on the wishlist for as long as I can remember. [[User:Bawolff|Bawolff]] ([[User talk:Bawolff|talk]]) 06:12, 25 February 2008 (UTC)
::Ah, that rings a bell. Surely that's in the past by now though, since DPL2 is already superseded. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 07:57, 25 February 2008 (UTC)
:::The developers also have an issue with its maintainability. Its a WONTFIX bug. The developers have said that a specific narrow set of wanted features should be added to a new extension. My impression is that the developers consider the extension to be too bloated, too slow, and to use too many/much resources. The DPL that is allowed, is only allowed so long as a wiki is smallish, for instance it will never be used on WP because WP is too big for it. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 02:01, 26 February 2008 (UTC)

== Spam issue ==

We are writing a wikibooks on metabolomics which includes many links to a site called KEGG. Everytime we try to post a link to KEGG we get a SPAM warning message. How can I let the system know that these are legit links. Here is a typical one:

== Muggles' Guide Bot Request ==

I know I've been relatively quiet lately, but over the past few weeks I've been looking at PDF creation tools for my book [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter]]. Generally things have been going well with [[User:Hagindaz/Wiki2LaTeX|Wiki2LaTeX]] but what my editing team and I have realized now is that all our relative linking in our pages is making links in the PDF get screwed up. What we need is a bot that can go through all 500+ of our pages and &quot;absolutize&quot; the links. Is anyone up to the task? I can certainly provide more detail if necessary. Thanks. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 02:22, 27 February 2008 (UTC)

:I think that my bot may be able to handle this. I will need to fiddle around with it and see if I can make the algorithm for link expansion general enough. I should have some time this evening that I can play with it. 
:I would like to hear from some of the people who use other tools such as AWB and pywikibot, since I'm not sure what the capabilities of those tools are, and whether they would be a better fit for this project then my homebrew software is. If we don't hear from anybody else, I'll try to have something written up tonight.
:By the way, my bot is not currently able to read category or prefixindex lists, so we would need a list of all pages that need to be modified. I'll work on that too, if one doesnt exist already. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 19:34, 27 February 2008 (UTC)</text>

The function setvbuf() sets the buffer for ''stream'' to be ''buffer'', with a size of size. mode can be one of:

* _IOFBF, which indicates full buffering
* _IOLBF, which means line buffering
* _IONBF, which means no buffering

      <text xml:space="preserve">==== sprintf ====

{{C++ Programming/Syntax|
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;cstdio&gt;
int sprintf( char *buffer, const char *format, ... );
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

The sprintf() function is just like [[C++ Programming/Code/Standard C Library/Functions/printf|printf]](), except that the output is sent to ''buffer''. The return value is the number of characters written. For example:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
char string[50];
int file_number = 0;         

sprintf( string, &quot;file.%d&quot;, file_number );
file_number++;
output_file = fopen( string, &quot;w&quot; ); 
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that sprintf() does the opposite of a function like [[C++ Programming/Code/Standard C Library/Functions/atoi|atoi]]() -- where [[C++ Programming/Code/Standard C Library/Functions/atoi|atoi]]() converts a string into a number, sprintf() can be used to convert a number into a string.

For example, the following code uses sprintf() to convert an integer into a string of characters:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
char result[100];
int num = 24;
sprintf( result, &quot;%d&quot;, num );  
&lt;/source&gt;

This code is similar, except that it converts a floating-point number into an array of characters:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
char result[100];
float fnum = 3.14159;
sprintf( result, &quot;%f&quot;, fnum );
&lt;/source&gt;

=Catalan Opening=
This is the '''Catalan Opening''', named after the Spanish region of [[Wikipedia:Catalonia|Catalonia]], when Grandmaster Savielly Tartakower was asked, at the Barcelona tournament of 1929, to invent an opening system in honor of the region's chess history. Invariably, the Catalan is followed by the moves '''3...d5 4.Bg2'''. The Catalan then has two main branches, the Open Variation and the Closed Variation. In the Open Variation, Black takes the pawn on c4. This gives White strong pressure on Black's queenside, thanks to the fianchettoed bishop on g2. In the Closed Variation, which is more popular, Black retains his strong-point on d5, attempting to block out the bishop on g2.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{warning|Because of a recent bug with the install location of the dev files on debian and the hard-coded locations in the Makefile of DBD::Sybase I have suspended this tutorial. More information on the bug can be found at the rt tracker. [[User:EvanCarroll|EvanCarroll]] ([[User talk:EvanCarroll|talk]])}} 

This tutorial assumes you are using a Debian based distribution of Linux; if not, you might have to modify the instructions appropriately for you distro.

== Downloading ==
To install both &lt;tt&gt;freetds&lt;/tt&gt; and the drivers for &lt;tt&gt;iODBC&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;unixodbc&lt;/tt&gt; use &lt;tt&gt;apt-get&lt;/tt&gt;, i.e.,
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;apt-get install tdsodbc&lt;/source&gt;

If you plan to use iODBC, you'll want to run
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;apt-get install libiodbc2 libiodbc2-dev&lt;/source&gt;

If you're using Perl, after you install FreeTDS you'll want to install the DBD for Sybase:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
export SYBASE=/etc
cpan DBD::Sybase
&lt;/source&gt;

== Glossary ==
;TDS : Designed by Sybase, the '''T'''abular '''D'''ata '''S'''tream Protocol (TDS) describes how to communicate with MS-SQL and Sybase databases.


== Troubleshooting ==
Many of the errors here are to assist those with Google searches and the users.

=== Failing to set SYBASE ===

The following error is a result of not setting the sybase configuration variable 

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
[ERROR] [Thu Mar 13 11:07:42 2008] Could not run '/usr/local/bin/perl Makefile.PL': Please set SYBASE in CONFIG, or
set the $SYBASE environment variable at /root/.cpanplus/5.10.0/build/DBD-Sybase-1.08/Makefile.PL line 103, &lt;IN&gt;
line 44.
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Not actually any discussion here at all so this article is suprisingly useful for probabally being the work of one person. It is a little biased though: &quot;Some music does not really follow a mode at all, but non-modal key signatures are frowned upon&quot;. I also don't know if I'd agree that Atonal music is the abstract art of the music world, that's probabally another opinion. That's my two cents. Still I found this article enlightening, I dare not update somthing I'm really no expert on. -DarkShroom


== Needs revision ==
This text would benefit from a bit of cleaning, as there is info that appears to be a bit non-correct. Yet, the article is pretty useful and should make any wikipediophile proud. [[User:Mecanismo|Mecanismo]] ([[User talk:Mecanismo|talk]]) 23:46, 21 January 2010 (UTC)

Your 1 2 4 5 b7  is more likely Dorian, as that's the Dorian pentatonic scale, and is found in Western folk music, not just japanese.</text>

* The use of your own watchlist which shows when pages you are interested in have been edited.
* Your opinions carry greater weight in the [[Wikibooks:Decision making|decision making process]].
* You become a recognized member of the Wikibooks community.
* Creating an account is easy and only takes a few minutes of your time, especially given the benefits.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikibookian and [[Special:Userlogin|create an account]].&lt;br/&gt;

this really confuses me @_@   can someone explain better (no offense) I just can;t follow it. -- 24.28.7.96 4 March 2008 
:I'd second that. I'm trying to figure out dictionaries and this page was no help at all. --198.85.230.103 10 November 2008
::There is some more info over [http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Basic_Python_data_types here] (en.wikiversity), when I have some time I might try and add it in. --[[User:Tehdrago|Tehdrago]] ([[User talk:Tehdrago|talk]]) 18:07, 16 November 2008 (UTC)

:To my opinion, the python page [http://docs.python.org/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries here] has a breakdown example on how to use the dictionary function thus explaining how the dictionary actually works. This wiki page on the other hand shows how you can use the dictionary like an application. Perhaps you can include some basic examples before the phonebook example? -- 27 November 2009

I would like to see an expanded definition of keys and values at the beginning of the section; the opening matter shifts abruptly. Could you explain a little more about what a key is? What is a value? Are they like variables? Are they like array/list item indexes? -- 30 December 2010

In the process of being cross-linked ...

==HPV screening vs Pap smear==
*'''Finland''' (2003-2005) -- HPV DNA screen vs conventional cytology
**'''2010''' PMID 20423964  [http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/340/apr27_1/c1804 Full Text] -- &quot;Rate of cervical cancer, severe intraepithelial neoplasia, and adenocarcinoma in situ in primary HPV DNA screening with cytology triage: randomised study within organised screening programme&quot; (Anttila A, BMJ 2010;340:c1804) 
**Randomized. 58,076 women, age 30-60, routine population-based screening program. Arm 1) HPV DNA test vs Arm 2) conventional cytological screening. Primary outcome cervical cancer, CIN-III and carcinoma in situ (both reported as CIN-III+)
***Outcome: CIN-III+ HPV 76 cases (6 cervical CA) vs cytology 53 cases (8 cervical CA)
***Conclusion: Primary HPV screening more sensitive than conventional cytology in detecting CIN-III+ lesions; number of cervical cancer small

==PET Staging==
*'''Chang Gung University, Taiwan''' (2002-2006) -- pretreatment PET vs no PET
**Randomized. 129 patients, Stage I-IVA cervical cancer, positive pelvic but negative PALN by MRI. Arm 1) pretreatment PET vs Arm 2) no PET. Treated with chemo-RT, standard pelvic fields. If PET+, extended to include PALN
**'''2010''' PMID 19464824 -- &quot;A prospective randomized trial to study the impact of pretreatment FDG-PET for cervical cancer patients with MRI-detected positive pelvic but negative para-aortic lymphadenopathy.&quot; (Tsai CS, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2010 Feb 1;76(2):477-84. Epub 2009 May 21.)
***Outcome: PET identified 11% extra-pelvic mets; of these 57% remained disease free after modified fields. 4-year DFS PET+ 75% vs. PET- 77% (NS); 4-year OS 79% vs 85% (NS)
***Conclusion: Pretreatment PET can improve detection of pelvic mets, but may not translate into survival benefit


==RT Technique==
===Brachytherapy===
*'''Osaka''' (Japan)(1983-1989) -- HDR fractional dose 7.5 Gy/fx vs. 6.0 Gy/fx
**Randomized. 165 patients with cervix adenoCA, Stage IA-IV. Treated with 2 separated dose schedules depending on stage. Arm 1) EBRT + BT using 7.5 Gy/fx (either 37.5/5 or 30/4 or 22.5/3) vs. Arm 2) EBRT + BT using 6.0 Gy/fx (either 36/6 or 30/5 or 18/3).
**'''5-years; 1994''' PMID 7974179 -- &quot;A prospective randomized study concerning the point A dose in high-dose rate intracavitary therapy for carcinoma of the uterine cervix. The final results.&quot; (Chatani M, Strahlenther Onkol. 1994 Nov;170(11):636-42.)
***Outcome: 5-year CSS: Stage I 100% vs. 100%, Stage II 82% vs. 85%, Stage III 62% vs. 52%, Stage IV 22% vs. 31% (all NS). No difference in LRF or DM
***Toxicity: No difference
***Conclusion: No difference between the two treatment schedules; small number of fractions at 7.5 Gy/fx may be advantageous due to short duration

===Circadian Variation===
*'''Lucknow, India''' -- morning RT vs evening RT
**Randomized. 229 patients, cervical CA. Arm 1) morning (8-10 AM) vs Arm 2) evening (6-8 PM) RT. Primary outcome mucositis
**'''2010''' PMID 20162717 -- &quot;Circadian variation in radiation-induced intestinal mucositis in patients with cervical carcinoma.&quot; (Shukla P, Cancer. 2010 Feb 16. [Epub ahead of print])
***Outcome: Overall diarrhea AM 87% vs PM 68% (SS), Grade 3-4 diarrhea 14% vs 5% (SS)
***Conclusion: Significant difference between morning and evening arms suggest influence of circadian rhythms
==Hypoxia==
===Anemia===
*'''GOG 191''' (2001-2003) -- Chemo-RT +/- EPO
**Randomized. ''Closed prematurely due to concerns about thromboembolic events.'' 109 patients accrued (&lt;25% planned). Cervical cancer, Stage IIB-IVA, Hgb &lt;14.0 Arm 1) Chemo-RT vs. Arm 2) Chemo-RT + recombinant Epo 40,000 units QW
**'''3-years; 2008''' PMID 18037478 -- &quot;Phase III trial to evaluate the efficacy of maintaining hemoglobin levels above 12.0 g/dL with erythropoietin vs above 10.0 g/dL without erythropoietin in anemic patients receiving concurrent radiation and cisplatin for cervical cancer.&quot; (Thomas G, Gynecol Oncol. 2008 Feb;108(2):317-25. Epub 2007 Nov 26.) Median F/U 3 years
***Outcome: 3-year PFS control 65% vs. EPO 58%; OS 75% vs. 61% (insufficient numbers)
***Rate of thromboembolism: control 8% vs. EPO 19% (NS), no deaths
***Conclusion: Thromboembolism common; impact of Hgb &gt;12.0 remains undetermined


===Hyperbaric Oxygen===
*'''RTOG 70-01''' (1972-1975) -- RT in air vs. RT in HBO
**Randomized. ''Stopped early due to slow accrual.'' 58 patients with Stage IIB-IVA cervix. Arm 1) RT 50/25 in air vs. Arm 2) RT 40/10 in HBO. Brachytherapy in both arms. Only 19/29 HBO patients received most of their EBRT in the chamber
**'''1981''' PMID 7028700 -- &quot;Hyperbaric oxygen therapy for carcinoma of the cervix--stages IIB, IIIA, IIIB and IVA: results of a randomized study by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group.&quot; (Brady LW, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1981 Aug;7(8):991-8.)
***Outcome: Local failure air 24% vs. HBO 26% (NS); DFS air 52% vs. HBO 73% (NS)
***Complications: both arms 24% (NS)
***Conclusion: Study too small; no difference; HBO technically difficult to administer
**Comment: Test of hypofractionation + HBO vs. standard fractionation; study too small</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Shipworms''' are not worms at all, but rather a group of unusual saltwater clams with very reduced shells, notorious for boring into (and eventually destroying) wooden structures which are immersed in sea water, including piers, docks and wooden ships. Sometimes called &quot;termites of the sea&quot;, they are marine bivalve molluscs (Eulamellibranchiata) in the family '''Teredinidae'''. 

They bore into submerged wood, and bacteria in a special organ called the gland of Deshayes enable them to digest cellulose. The excavated burrow is usually lined with a calcareous tube.  

The shipworms belong to several genera, of which ''Teredo'' is the most commonly mentioned. The best known species is ''Teredo navalis''.  Historically, ''Teredo'' concentrations in the Caribbean Sea have been substantially higher than in most other salt water bodies.

Shipworms have slender worm-like forms, but nonetheless possess the characteristic structures of bivalves. The valves of the shell of shipworms are small separate parts located at the anterior end of the worm, used for excavating the burrow. Shipworms greatly damage wooden hulls and marine piling, and have been the subject of much study to find methods to avoid their attacks.

In the early 1800s, the behavior and anatomy of the shipworm inspired the great British engineer Marc Brunel. Based on his observations of how the shipworm's valves simultaneously enable it to tunnel through wood and protect it from being crushed by the swelling timber, Brunel designed an ingenious modular iron tunnelling framework - a tunnelling shield - which enabled workers to successfully tunnel through the highly unstable river bed beneath the Thames. The Thames Tunnel was the first successful large tunnel ever built under a navigable river.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Scrunchy4.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Scrunchies are a good way to use small amounts of leftover yarn.]]

Scrunchies hold long hair into pony tails and braids.  These are among the simplest and quickest projects for a beginning crocheter.  They're cost effective too.  A department store quality scrunchy often costs two to three times the price of a skein of yarn, and there will be enough yarn left over to make more scrunchies for envious family and friends.

== Materials ==
*6.5mm crochet hook (U.S. size K)
*Heavy chenille yarn
*10&quot; dressmaker's elastic

== Construction ==
A scrunchy is basically a long rectangle of fabric with a piece of elastic running through it and the ends joined into a loop.

When selecting a yarn to make a scrunchy, the three most important factors are pliancy and pile.  The fiber should be flexible enough to gather with elastic and full enough to conceal the elastic.  Chenille is a particularly good choice for people who have straight silky hair, because this yarn has extra grab.  Wool blends often make very good scrunchies.  Nylon, silk, and rayon are not good choices for scrunchies.

== Instructions ==
*Row 1: chain stitch 45.  Add a turning chain of 2 stitches.
*Row 2: half double crochet into previous row.  Turn.
*Row 3: same as row 2.

Leave the crochet ends loose while working the elastic.  Secure elastic to one end of row 2 and leave 2&quot; of elastic unusued.  Run free end of elastic through the stitches of the fabric, gathering material into folds as needed to keep the elastic free.  Tie off the two ends together with an overhand knot, pull tight, and trim.  Then use the loose ends of yarn from the crochet to stitch the end seams together and conceal the elastic knot.  Trim excess.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Crochetbraceletworn.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Beaded bracelet.]]

Here's a beginner project to impress fellow crocheters.  Crochet lace and bead crochet have a reputation for being difficult, but really this project is as simple as they get.  And a dainty little bracelet can be finished in no time at all.  If you know how to put beads on string and can wrap yarn around a hook, you can make this.

== Materials ==
*Crochet hook, 2.5mm (U.S. size B)
*Mercerized cotton crochet thread, size 10, ecru.
*Glass beads, size E
*Bracelet finding, sterling silver (or base metal)
*Clear nail polish

== Construction ==
This bracelet is designed to fit snugly; some variation will be necessary depending on the size of the wearer's wrist and the gauge of the crocheter.  The pattern works in multiples of three, so measure the recipient's wrist and add or subtract stitches in multiples of three to achieve a proper fit.  

To add beads during crochet, insert the hook into a stitch and slide one bead down into the stitch before wrapping the thread over the hook.  Continue to make a single crochet normally.

When customizing a variable sized item, bear a couple of things in mind,  The first row of chain stitches on any pattern will contract when the second row gets worked in.  So the working length is unknown until the second row is complete.  Also, it is always possible to work extra chain stitches into the first row and cut away excess.  That way, if the initial estimate is an undercount, a few extra second row stitches can be worked into the starting chain to achieve the desired length.  When the second row is complete and unused chain stitches remain, leave half a dozen chain stitches and trim off the rest, then unravel those unused chain stitches and work in as a loose end when the piece is complete.

== Instructions ==
Before crocheting, string beads onto thread.  Bead crocheters often make the stringing process easier by applying clear nail polish to the tip of the thread and waiting for it to dry.  32 beads were used in the sample bracelet.  When in doubt, err on the generous side and string extra beads.  Approximately 2 beads will be needed for each centimeter of length.

Size notes: the sample bracelet is 6&quot; (16cm) long, not including the length of the clasp.  It uses a base of 45 stitches and 32 beads.  That equals approximately 2 beads and 3 stitches per centimeter of length.  Allow approximately 1cm for the clasp. 

*Row 1: chain stitch 60.  Turn.  While turning, make a loop and run one clasp end through it.  Work the loop down snug with the end of the chain.
*Row 2: For the first stitch, work the hook through the loop that holds the clasp.  Make a single crochet, securing the clasp into the stitch.  Continue single crochet for 44 more stitches.  Test size on recipient's wrist and add or subtract chain stitches as needed to achieve the desired fit.  Turn.
*Row 3: Chain stitch 4, skip two, single crochet into the third stitch while adding a bead.  Repeat to the end of the row.
*Special: flat stitch across the end of the row to the other side of the piece.  At the midpoint, secure the other end of the clasp with a single crochet stitch.
*Row 4: As row 3.

      <comment>/* Slicing strings (and lists) */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Slicing strings (and lists) ===

Strings can be cut into pieces &amp;mdash; in the same way as it was shown for lists in the previous chapter &amp;mdash; by using the ''slicing'' &quot;operators&quot; &lt;tt&gt;[]&lt;/tt&gt;. The slicing operator works in the same way as before: text[first_index:last_index] (in very rare cases there can be another colon and a third argument, as in the example shown below).

In order not to get confused by the index numbers, it is easiest to see them as &quot;clipping places&quot;, possibilities to cut a sting into parts. Here is an example, which shows the clipping places (in yellow) and their index numbers (red and blue) for a simple text string:

&lt;tt&gt;
{| style=&quot;text-align:center&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0px&quot;
|
| style=&quot;width:2ex&quot; |
| style=&quot;width:2ex;color:red&quot; |0
| style=&quot;width:2ex&quot; |
| style=&quot;width:2ex;color:red&quot; |1
| style=&quot;width:2ex&quot; |
| style=&quot;width:2ex;color:red&quot; |2
| style=&quot;width:2ex&quot; |
| style=&quot;width:2ex&quot; | ...
| style=&quot;width:2ex&quot; |
| style=&quot;width:2ex;color:blue&quot; | -2
| style=&quot;width:2ex&quot; |
| style=&quot;width:2ex;color:blue&quot; | -1
| style=&quot;width:2ex&quot; |
| style=&quot;width:2ex&quot; |
| style=&quot;width:2ex&quot; |
|-
|
|
| style=&quot;background:#FFFF88&quot; |&amp;darr;
|
| style=&quot;background:#FFFF88&quot; |&amp;darr;
|
| style=&quot;background:#FFFF88&quot; |&amp;darr;
|
| style=&quot;background:#FFFF88&quot; |&amp;darr;
|
| style=&quot;background:#FFFF88&quot; |&amp;darr;
|
| style=&quot;background:#FFFF88&quot; |&amp;darr;
|
| style=&quot;background:#FFFF88&quot; |&amp;darr;
|
|-
| text = 
|&quot;
| style=&quot;background:#FFFF88&quot; |
!S 
| style=&quot;background:#FFFF88&quot; |
!T
| style=&quot;background:#FFFF88&quot; |
!R
| style=&quot;background:#FFFF88&quot; |
!I
| style=&quot;background:#FFFF88&quot; |
!N
| style=&quot;background:#FFFF88&quot; |
!G
| style=&quot;background:#FFFF88&quot; |
|&quot;
|-
|
|
| style=&quot;background:#FFFF88&quot; |&amp;uarr;
|
| style=&quot;background:#FFFF88&quot; |
|
| style=&quot;background:#FFFF88&quot; |
|
| style=&quot;background:#FFFF88&quot; |
|
| style=&quot;background:#FFFF88&quot; |
|
| style=&quot;background:#FFFF88&quot; |
|
| style=&quot;background:#FFFF88&quot; |&amp;uarr;
|
|-
|
|
|[:
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|:]
|
|}
&lt;/tt&gt;

Note that the red indexes are counted from the beginning of the string and the blue ones from the end of the string backwards. (Note that there is no blue -0, which could seem to be logical at the end of the string. Because &lt;tt&gt;-0 == 0&lt;/tt&gt;, -0 means &quot;beginning of the string&quot; as well.)  Now we are ready to use the indexes for slicing operations:

&lt;tt&gt;
{|
|-
|text[1:4] || style=&quot;width:3em;text-align:center&quot; | &amp;rarr; || &quot;TRI&quot;
|-
|text[:5] || style=&quot;width:3em;text-align:center&quot; | &amp;rarr; || &quot;STRIN&quot;
|-
|text[:-1] || style=&quot;width:3em;text-align:center&quot; | &amp;rarr; || &quot;STRIN&quot;
|-
|text[-4:] || style=&quot;width:3em;text-align:center&quot; | &amp;rarr; || &quot;RING&quot;
|-
|text[2] || style=&quot;width:3em;text-align:center&quot; | &amp;rarr; || &quot;R&quot;
|-
|text[:] || style=&quot;width:3em;text-align:center&quot; | &amp;rarr; || &quot;STRING&quot;
|-
|text[::-1] || style=&quot;width:3em;text-align:center&quot; | &amp;rarr; || &quot;GNIRTS&quot;
|}
&lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;text[1:4]&lt;/tt&gt; gives us all of the &lt;tt&gt;text&lt;/tt&gt; string between clipping places 1 and 4, &quot;&lt;tt&gt;TRI&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;. If you omit one of the [first_index:last_index] arguments, you get the beginning or end of the string as default: &lt;tt&gt;text[:5]&lt;/tt&gt; gives &quot;&lt;tt&gt;STRIN&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;. For both &lt;tt&gt;first_index&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;last_index&lt;/tt&gt; we can use both the red and the blue numbering schema: &lt;tt&gt;text[:-1]&lt;/tt&gt; gives the same as &lt;tt&gt;text[:5]&lt;/tt&gt;, because the index -1 is at the same place as 5 in this case. If we do not use an argument containing a colon, the number is treated in a different way: &lt;tt&gt;text[2]&lt;/tt&gt; gives us one character following the second clipping point, &quot;&lt;tt&gt;R&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;. The special slicing operation &lt;tt&gt;text[:]&lt;/tt&gt; means &quot;from the beginning to the end&quot; and produces a copy of the entire string (or list, as shown in the previous chapter).

Last but not least, the slicing operation can have a second colon and a third argument, which is interpreted as the &quot;step size&quot;: &lt;tt&gt;text[::-1]&lt;/tt&gt; is &lt;tt&gt;text&lt;/tt&gt; from beginning to the end, with a step size of -1. -1 means &quot;every character, but in the other direction&quot;. &quot;&lt;tt&gt;STRING&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; backwards is &quot;&lt;tt&gt;GNIRTS&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; (test a step length of 2, if you have not got the point yet).

All these slicing operations work with lists as well. In that sense strings are just a special case of lists, where the list elements are single characters.</text>

= Ponziani Opening =
=== 3. c3 ===
The Ponziani is one of the oldest openings. Its plan is to support a later d4, but it doesn't pose much of a problem for the defence. An opening that has never been popular. Black can counter with the immediate d5. This is what many say who do not know the latest theory of this opening. Actually it is a good opening and it is difficult for Black to equalize.  I have won from many experts and masters with this opening because they underestimate what a skilled Ponziani player can do.
There is a fairly new book that brings the theory of this opening up to date. It is Play the Ponziani by Keith Hayward and David Taylor. The moves and evaluations given here in the theory table are quite incorrect. [I am David Taylor]

Here are some better evaluations:

The defense 3. ...Nf6 often leads to a game where White has a small space advantage plus a small time advantage. Not really a bad deal at all.

The defense 3. ... d5 leads to a good fight for both sides but really the person who knows current theory best will probably get a very good game.

The defense 3. ... f5 fairly often leads to a White advantage but again theory must be known.  

The defense 3. ... d6 will usually lead to a positions often reached via the [[Chess Opening Theory/1. e4/1...e5/2. Nf3/2...Nc6/3. Bb5/3...d6|Ruy Lopez, Steinitz Variation]] [usually just fine for White]

There are &quot;refutations&quot; to the Ponziani in two books  The Kaufman Repertoire for Black and White and The open Games for Black.  While these are two excellent books I have found follow ups for White where the refutations fail and White keeps the normal opening advantage.

== Partial Imports ==

I imported [[w:Denmark]] to [[Transwiki:Denmark]] today, although there was a failure and I wasn't able to import the complete edit history. However, when I look at the edit history of the page, it shows the last edit made on Wikipedia, and it also includes the import, saying &quot;1 revision from [[w:Denmark]]&quot;. Now, this certainly isn't an ideal situation, but it still does give proper attribution to wikipedia, and does point the reader (in a round-about way) to the history of that page. I'm inclined to say that, in terms of GFDL compliance, that this should be sufficient in cases where a full edit history cannot be successfully imported. GFDL  texts are not free unless it's technically infeasable to make a complete copy of the history section, and I think people would forgive us for doing our best under these technical limiations.

I would love to hear what other admins have to say on this point, I could easily be wrong. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 02:14, 4 February 2008 (UTC)
:I think that's exactly right, but we can easily go a step further. {{tlx|Import failed}} (put it on the talk page) provides a direct link to the WP history page. (PS someone who knows how might clean up the way the link is formed.) This provides an additional notice of attribution, and can also serve (through whatlinkshere) as an easy way to see what pages need a full history if/when these imports become possible (and we determine that the rest of the history is needed). &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:50, 4 February 2008 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{WMOG-header}}
Maintaining a healthy population of trees in a suburban setting shares much in common with maintaining a &quot;woodlot&quot; or resource forest, but there are of course a number of differences as well. The best &quot;wooded gardens&quot; actually have relatively few large trees, since these areas are also expected to support small trees, shrubs, garden plants, and lawns. Managing these small woodlots takes planning and a realistic sense of what woodlands look like.

Natural woodlands are bound by the laws of [[../Ecological Succession|ecological succession]], where a disturbed area (in nature disturbed by fire or storm) will first be colonized by herbaceous plants and other &quot;[[../Pioneer Species|pioneer species]]&quot; such as fast-growing trees and shrubs adapted to sunny environments. In many regions, the ''mature'' forest will be primarily one or a few species of [[../Climax Species|climax trees]], and a very sparse understory of ferns, mosses, ephemeral plants, and slow-growing shrubs: an ecosystem which is too sparse and delicate for regular use as an entertainment space for humans and their pets. 

Ecologically speaking, the goal in having a woodland garden is to &quot;freeze&quot; the ecological succession at the stage where there is a fairly extensive canopy (between 50% and 30% enclosed), which limits the amount of shade and water competition form the trees to allow us to have ornamental plants and lawns beneath. Maintaining that balance is a never-ending task, because the trees will continue to grow unless constantly suppressed. The main question is whether to prune or to cull the trees. 

==Culling (or &quot;thinning&quot;)==
In situations where the woodland garden was not planned in advance, there will often be decisions to be made about what trees to keep and what trees to remove. As a rule, it's best to remove trees as soon as they begin to pose a problem, because the trees will only get larger, more problematic, and more difficult to remove as they continue to grow or perhaps die (live trees are much easier to remove than dead trees).

'''1. Hazardous trees:''' Trees that pose an obvious hazard should be the first to go. Rotten trees and hollow trees are the most obvious, but a number of other factors can be just as important, such as trees from weak-wooded species, trees growing through utility lines, or even trees with dangerous fruits (such as [[../Juglans|walnuts]], [[../Maclura pomifera|osage orange]], or [[../Aesculus|horse chestnuts and buckeyes]] if they are growing in an area where people, cars, or outdoor furniture is below). 

'''2. Diseased trees:''' Trees with serious diseases (such as ''[[../Phytophthora/]]'', ''[[../Verticillium/]]'', or other fatal diseases should in most cases be removed, unless there are no other trees around that could catch the disease and the garden owner would like to maintain a [[../Snags|snag]] for woodpeckers and cavity-nesting birds. 

'''3. Invasive trees:''' Trees that are invasive in a particular region should in most cases be culled to protect the health of other trees and prevent seed production, although in some areas close to urban centers invasive species may represent almost all the trees present, and it may be better to keep some of them. 

'''4. Trees with bad growth habits:''' When trees are not carefully managed &quot;from the start&quot;, they can often have growth habits that are aesthetically undesirable or in many cases will eventually become hazardous. Trees that have grown up underneath larger neighbors will often lean perilously, for example, and other trees may have dangerously narrow crotches. Removing these trees reduces the competition for the trees that will be kept, and helps prevent hazards later on. 

'''5. Overcrowded trees:''' The last step is to see if the healthy trees are competing with one another, and make a decision as to whether to allow them to compete, or pick the best specimens and cull the second best.

==Pruning (&quot;lightening the canopy&quot;)==
After any culling has been done, or if there are no trees needing culling, the next step is to prune the remaining trees to allow light to reach the ground and reduce the water consumption of the larger trees. Limbing up is often the best option, but other methods of structural or reductive pruning can be used if low branches are desirable.

==Trunk protection==
If the trees are growing in a lawn, it is generally a good idea to create [[../Tree Rings|tree rings]] around the base of the trunks to prevent damage from mowing equipment. Small rings can simply be maintained as mulched soil, or larger rings can be created and plenatd with ground covers, shrubs, or herbaceous plants adapted to competition with tree roots.

==Underplanting==

&lt;big&gt;'''Bladder Cancer Level I Evidence'''&lt;/big&gt;

In the process of being cross-linked ...


==Superficial Bladder Cancer==
*'''MRC T1 Bladder''' (1991-2003)
**Randomized, 2 strata. 210 patients with pT1G3 TCC after TURBT
***Unifocal disease &amp; no Tis: Arm 1) observation vs. Arm 2) RT 60/30
***Multifocal disease and/or Tis: Arm 1) intravesical therapy (MMC or BCG) vs. Arm 2) RT 60/30
**'''2007''' PMID 17631326 -- &quot;A randomized trial of radical radiotherapy for the management of pT1G3 NXM0 transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder.&quot; (Harland SJ, J Urol. 2007 Sep;178(3 Pt 1):807-13; discussion 813. Epub 2007 Jul 16.)
***Outcome: No difference in PFS, OS, or cystectomy rate
***Conclusion: No evidence that adjuvant RT after TURBT is better than more conservative treatment; prognosis poor regardless

==Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer==
===Definitive RT vs Preop RT + Cystectomy===
*'''Danish National Bladder Cancer Group, DAVECA 8201''' (1983-1986) -- Definitive RT vs Preop RT + cystectomy
**Randomized. 183 patients. cT2-T4a. Arm 1) Pre-op RT 40 Gy + cystectomy vs Arm 2) Radical RT 60 Gy with cystectomy for salvage.
**'''1991''' PMID 1785004 &amp;mdash; &quot;Treatment of advanced bladder cancer category T2 T3 and T4a. A randomized multicenter study of preoperative irradiation and cystectomy versus radical irradiation and early salvage cystectomy for residual tumor. DAVECA protocol 8201. Danish Vesical Cancer Group.&quot; (Sell A, Scand J Urol Nephrol Suppl. 1991;138:193-201.) Median F/U 4.2 years 
***Outcome: Salvage cystectomy 28%. Local/pelvic failure Cystectomy 7% vs RT 35%, no difference in DM. No difference in OS (29% vs 23%)
***No difference in OS (29% vs 23%). Local/pelvic recurrence lower (6.8% surgery vs 35% RT). No difference in DM.
***Conclusion: Improved pelvic control with surgery, but no difference in survival

*'''MD Anderson''' (1964-1970) -- Definitive RT vs Preop RT + cystectomy
**Randomized. 67 patients, Stage B2-C. Arm 1) definitive RT 60 Gy vs Arm 2) Preoperative RT 50 Gy followed by cystectomy
**'''1977''' PMID 402205 -- &quot;Bladder cancer: superiority of preoperative irradiation and cystectomy in clinical stages B2 and C.&quot; (Miller LS, Cancer. 1977 Feb;39(2 Suppl):973-80.)
***Outcome: 5-year OS RT 16% vs preop RT + cystectomy 46% (SS)
***Conclusion: Institutional policy has changed to preoperative RT with planned cystectomy, except for patients declining or medically unfit for surgery

===RT Alone vs Chemo-RT===
*'''NCI Canada''' (1985-1989) -- RT vs RT + concurrent cisplatin
**Randomized. 99 patients. cT2-T4b, either definitive therapy or pre-cystectomy (selected a priori). Arm 1) RT 40/20 or 60/30 vs Arm 2) Same RT with concurrent cisplatin 100 mg/m2 Q2W x3 cycles
**'''1996''' PMID 8918486 &amp;mdash; &quot;Improved local control of invasive bladder cancer by concurrent cisplatin and preoperative or definitive radiation. The National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group.&quot; (Coppin CM, J Clin Oncol. 1996 Nov;14(11):2901-7.) Median F/U 6.5 years
***Outcome: 5-year pelvic failure RT 59% vs chemo-RT 40% (SS), first site pelvic failure 52% vs chemo-RT 29% (SS), held in both definitive and preop groups. No difference in DM. 3-year OS 47% vs 33% (NS). If definitive treatment, bladder preservation RT 36% vs chemo-RT 70% (NS)
***Conclusion: Concurrent cisplatin may improve pelvic control and bladder preservation, but not overall survival.

===Induction MCV chemotherapy===
*'''RTOG 89-03''' (1990-93) -- Selective chemo-RT bladder sparing +/- induction MCV x2 cycles
**Phase III. ''Stopped prematurely due to severe neutropenia and sepsis.'' 123 of 174 patients. cT2-T4a. Randomized to Arm 1) 2 cycles of MCV before, or Arm 2) no MCV before RT 39.6/22 with concurrent cisplatin 100 mg/m2 q3w x2 courses (per RTOG 88-02), cystoscopy 4 weeks later. If CR, consolidative RT 25.2/14 with concurrent cisplatin 100 mg/m2, else radical cystectomy. Total RT dose 64.8/36
**'''1998''' PMID 9817278 &amp;mdash; &quot;Phase III trial of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with invasive bladder cancer treated with selective bladder preservation by combined radiation therapy and chemotherapy: initial results of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 89-03.&quot; (Shipley WU, J Clin Oncol. 1998 Nov;16(11):3576-83.) Median F/U 5 years
***Outcome: pCR MCV+ 61% vs MCV- 55%. r-year bladder preservation 36% vs 40% (NS). DM 33% vs 39% (NS). 5-year OS 48% vs 49% (NS) Predictors for worse outcome hydronephrosis and incomplete TURBT
***Conclusion: 2 cycles of MCV did not increase CR rate, change DM rate, or impact OS. High toxicity.

==RT Technique==
===Partial bladder irradiation===
*'''Christie Hospital, UK''' (1993-99) -- whole bladder 52.5/20 vs partial bladder 57.5/20 or 55/16
**Randomized. 149 patients. T2-T3N0M0, unifocal TCC &lt;= 7cm. Randomized to whole bladder conformal RT (52.5/20, 2.63 Gy/fx) or partial bladder RT (CTV + 1.5 cm) in 4 wks (57.5/20, 2.88 Gy/fx) or 3 wks (55 Gy/16, 3.44 Gy/fx). No chemo
**'''2004''' PMID 15093917 &amp;mdash; &quot;Radiotherapy for muscle-invasive carcinoma of the bladder: results of a randomized trial comparing conventional whole bladder with dose-escalated partial bladder radiotherapy.&quot; (Cowan RA, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2004 May 1;59(1):197-207.) Median F/U 5.8 years for living patients
***Outcome: 5-year local control WBRT 58% vs PBRT4 59% vs PBRT3 34% (NS), overall 50%. 87% of recurrences within irradiated tumor volume. DM 17% vs 25% vs 22% (NS). 5-year OS 58% (NS)
***Toxicity: Well tolerated. 85% of patients alive at 5 years preserved their bladder
***Conclusion: Comparable outcome between whole bladder RT and partial bladder RT

===Accelerated irradiation===
*'''Cooperative Urological Oncology Group, UK''' (1988-1998) -- AHFX 60.8/32 BID vs CF 64/32 QD
**Randomized. 229 patients with T2-T3 N0-N1 bladder cancer. Arm 1) AF split-course 60.8/32 BID (22.8/12 + 19/10 + 19/10) vs. Arm 2) Conventional CF 64/32. Primary endpoint local control
**'''2005''' PMID 15878099 -- &quot;A randomised trial of accelerated radiotherapy for localised invasive bladder cancer.&quot; (Horwich A, Radiother Oncol. 2005 Apr;75(1):34-43. Epub 2004 Nov 25.)
***Outcome: LR AF 32% vs. CF 29% (NS); 3-year OS 47% vs. 54% (NS); 5-year OS 40% vs. 37% (NS)
***Toxicity: Acute AF 44% vs. CF 26% (SS); Late toxicity (if FFR 2 years): Grade 2+ AHFX 44% vs. conventional 38% (NS). 2 treatment-related deaths on AHFX arm
***Conclusion: No benefit for AHFX over conventional fractionation, worse acute GI toxicity</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==== tmpfile ====

{{C++ Programming/Syntax|
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;cstdio&gt;
FILE *tmpfile( void );
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

The function tmpfile() opens a temporary file with a unique filename and returns a pointer to that file. If there is an error, null is returned.

{{C++ Programming/Syntax|
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;cstdio&gt;
char *tmpnam( char *name );
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

The tmpnam() function creates a unique filename and stores it in name. tmpnam() can be called up to '''TMP_MAX''' times.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==== vprintf, vfprintf, and vsprintf ====

{{C++ Programming/Syntax|
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;cstdarg&gt;
#include &lt;cstdio&gt;
int vprintf( char *format, va_list arg_ptr );
int vfprintf( FILE *stream, const char *format, va_list arg_ptr );
int vsprintf( char *buffer, char *format, va_list arg_ptr );
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

These functions are very much like [[C++ Programming/Code/Standard C Library/Functions/printf|printf]](), [[C++ Programming/Code/Standard C Library/Functions/fprintf|fprintf]](), and [[C++ Programming/Code/Standard C Library/Functions/sprintf|sprintf]](). The difference is that the argument list is a pointer to a list of arguments. '''va_list''' is defined in cstdarg, and is also used by (Other Standard C Functions) [[C++ Programming/Code/Standard C Library/Functions/va_arg|va_arg]]().

For example:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
void error( char *fmt, ... ) {
  va_list args;
  va_start( args, fmt );
  fprintf( stderr, &quot;Error: &quot; );
  vfprintf( stderr, fmt, args );
  fprintf( stderr, &quot;\n&quot; );
  va_end( args );
  exit( 1 );
}   
&lt;/source&gt;

== Thanks for all your work! ==

Andybee,

I noticed that you have made many contributions to the human physiology textbook. Thanks for working to improve upon this book! I'm sorry I have not been active in this project for quite some time, but I would enjoy interacting with you and working together to improve upon the text. It appears that you are very knowledgeable when it comes to physiology, and it is an honor that you would contribute your time and efforts to this book.

== Foreword ==
This book is designed to teach people what video game design is, how video games work, and enable them to create them, from chumming up ideas and figuring out how to structure them to teaching them how a game engine can be designed to satisfy their requirements. You do not need any prior knowledge of video games to understand this book's subject, up to the implementation part that will expand upon game development techniques for many different types of media. ''Programming may not be required''. Depending on what your goal is, you will need to understand how to program if you intend on going from design to production. You will also need to comprehend Object Oriented Programming to understand modular designs, and be able to understand C/C++ APIs, and have some basic 2D/3D graphics concepts like what a bitmap or a texture is and how they can be used. We will not deal with a specific API or programming language but C/C++ and ASM will be used for examples. The intention is to provide you a with a broad vision of the possibilities available to create Video Games.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Mental health: 
Is it mind over matter? In a sense, yes. But not in every case. 
Pysical and mind can't be separated. They both have influence on each other. 
Because of my long term physical health problem, my mental health/depression has triggered. 
I tried to control my mind not to have that kind of feeling. But can only control for a certain amount. 
For my case, I found out one thing. It is true for me. It is nothing to use or buy and no side affect. That is to exercise your nerve. How to exercise? It is simple. You sit down on your leg (not in the chair) and squeeze your chest while keeping your head down. Squeeze means the same thing you do when you go to restroom. Try a few times everyday. Don't squeeze too much and a long time. It can cause low blood pressure. 
It is sound strange. It does work.

== Can you find a common thread? ==

What might be a common thread for this book that we could use to tie it all together and then be used expand upon it? --[[User:Remi|Remi]] ([[User talk:Remi|talk]]) 09:18, 3 June 2008 (UTC)

Most of this material falls into a category which usually appears in books or chapters as 'themes in psychology' or 'approaches to psychology' or the like.  These are more schools of thoughts than 'topics' as the term is commonly used.  I think that as an 'Approaches' text it could be useful and relevant.

==Material for possible integration==
Laing argued that the strange behavior and seemingly confused speech of people undergoing a psychotic episode were ultimately understandable as an attempt to communicate worries and concerns, often in situations where this was not possible or not permitted. Laing stressed the role of society, and particularly the family, in the development of &quot;madness&quot; (his term). He argued that individuals can often be put in impossible situations, where they are unable to conform to the conflicting expectations of their peers, leading to a 'lose-lose situation' and immense mental distress for the individuals concerned. (In 1956, in Palo Alto, Gregory Bateson and his colleagues Paul Watzlawick, Donald Jackson, and Jay Haley articulated a related theory of schizophrenia as stemming from double bind situations where a person receives different or contradictory messages.) The perceived symptoms of schizophrenia were therefore an expression of this distress, and should be valued as a cathartic and trans-formative experience.

Laing saw psychopathology as being seated not in biological or psychic organs -- whereby environment is relegated to playing at most only an accidental role as immediate trigger of disease (the 'stress diathasis model' of the nature and causes of psychopathology) -- but rather in the social cradle, the urban home, which cultivates it, the very crucible in which selves are forged. This re-evaluation of the locus of the disease process-- and consequent shift in forms of treatment-- was, indeed still is, perhaps now more than ever, in stark contrast to psychiatric orthodoxy (in the broadest sense we have of ourselves as psychological subjects and pathological selves). Psychiatrist and philosopher Karl Jaspers had previously pronounced, in his seminal work General Psychopathology, that many of the symptoms of mental illness (and particularly of delusions) were 'un-understandable', and therefore were worthy of little consideration except as a sign of some other underlying primary disorder. Laing was revolutionary in valuing the content of psychotic behavior and speech as a valid expression of distress, albeit wrapped in an enigmatic language of personal symbolism which is meaningful only from within their situation. According to Laing, if a therapist can better understand his or her patient, the therapist can begin to make sense of the symbolism of the patient's psychosis, and therefore start addressing the concerns which are the root cause of the distress.

Laing never denied the existence of mental illness, but simply viewed it in a radically different light from his contemporaries. For Laing, mental illness could be a trans-formative episode whereby the process of undergoing mental distress was compared to a shamanic journey. The traveler could return from the journey with important insights, and may even have become a wiser and more grounded person as a result. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ronald_David_Laing&amp;oldid=222855228]


There is already an entry for Laing in Wikipedia.  (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._D._Laing ).  There it is noted that his ideas are not part of mainstream Psychology.  A series on Topics in Psychology should mostly (not entirely) represent the prevailing view.  Ideally this would be accompanied by references to the scientific literature rather than a description of ones personal views and experience.

== Nature of the content here ==

Much of what I see in this section seems to be &quot;fringe Psychology&quot; rather than the mainstream point of view.  One would not find this sort of description in a standard textbook of Psychology.  [[User:DJM77bci|DJM77bci]] ([[User talk:DJM77bci|talk]]) 00:19, 20 December 2009 (UTC)

== Lead section: what is the point? ==

The lead section seems to ramble on aimlessly with a potted history of the universe before even mentioning the topic in a general way. What is the point of this? It mentions psychology as one of the things 'not immediately related to survival' - so does this mean that every book about any of the myriad arts or sciences should start out like this? Surely the lead section should summarise what the book is about and define the topic but it does not do this as 'Fringe' psychology is not even mentioned.

&lt;big&gt;'''Pancreatic Cancer Staging'''&lt;/big&gt;

'''AJCC 7th Edition (2010)''' &lt;br&gt;
''Primary Tumor:''
*T1 - confined to pancreas, 2 cm or less
*T2 - confined to pancreas, &gt; 2 cm
*T3 - extends beyond pancreas
*T4 - invades SMA or celiac axis (unresectable primary tumor)

''Regional Lymph Nodes:''
*N0 - no
*N1 - yes
*NX - regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed
;Note 1: Histopathological assessment of minimum 12 ''regional'' lymph nodes is recommended. However, in cases where surgery results in examination of less than the ideal minimum number, N staging is performed if at least one node has been examined. 
;Note 2: Direct extension of primary tumor into regional node is classified as node positive. 

''Distant Metastases:''
*M0 - none
*M1 - yes

''Stage Grouping:''
*IA - T1 N0
*IB - T2 N0
*IIA - T3 N0
*IIB - T1-3 N1
*III - T4 Any N
*IV - M1

''Changes from the 6th Edition:''
*Now staging includes neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas (including carcinoid)
*No changes in TNM or Overall Stage


&lt;p&gt;Instead of using the AJCC staging system, many simply divide pancreatic cancer into ''resectable'', ''unresectable'', and ''metastatic''.

==Older staging systems==
'''AJCC 6th Edition (2002)''' &lt;br&gt;
*Same as AJCC 7th Edition for TNM
*Excluded neuroendocrine tumors</text>

&lt;big&gt;'''Resectable Pancreatic Cancer'''&lt;/big&gt;


==Treatment Overview==
*Historically, surgery alone was used to treat resectable pancreatic cancer. Unfortunately, 5-year OS at the time of the first GITSG trial was only 6%
*GITSG 9173 randomized patients to adjuvant chemo-RT with concurrent/adjuvant 5-FU vs. no adjuvant treatment. The study closed prematurely due to slow accural, but showed a dramatic benefit for DFS and OS. RT was given as split course (20 Gy + 20 Gy). Adjuvant chemo-RT became the standard of care in the US
*In a follow-up trial (RTOG 97-04), the role of induction and adjuvant gemcitabine compared with 5-FU as a sandwich to concurrent chemo-RT was evaluated. There was a trend for improved survival with gemcitabine (particularly for head of pancreas tumors) but also significantly more toxicity. This trend dissipated at 5 year follow up (p=0.12)
*In the US, NCCN.org considers both chemo-RT and chemotherapy to be valid choices (evidence 2A)
*In Europe, EORTC 40891 attempted to confirm the GITSG results. It randomized patients to adjuvant chemo-RT vs. no adjuvant treatment. RT schedule was the same; chemo schedule was concurrent C.I. 5-FU only, without 2 years of further adjuvant treatment. It also included patients with peri-ampullary cancers (45%), who have significantly better prognosis. There was no benefit for LRR or OS. On exploratory subset analysis, there was also no benefit for the pancreatic cancer subset. In this trial, ~80% of patients died of their disease, but 8% survived &gt;10 years
*ESPAC-1 included 3 separate randomization (2x2, +/- chemo, +/- chemo-RT) trying to further determine the role of the various adjuvant options. On combined analysis, there was no survival benefit for adjuvant chemo-RT, but significant benefit for adjuvant chemotherapy. A further analysis of only the 2x2 patients again showed a survival benefit for adjuvant chemotherapy, and a deleterious effect of chemo-RT. However, this trial was widely criticized for its methodology
*A further meta-analysis of individual patient data from available randomized trials (Europe, Japan) confirmed a survival benefit for adjuvant chemotherapy and suggested trend to worse survival with chemo-RT. The one exception was patients with R1 resection, where chemo-RT appeared beneficial over chemotherapy alone
*Based on the combined results of EORTC 40891 and ESPAC-1, adjuvant chemo-RT is not indicated in Europe. Adjuvant chemotherapy is considered standard of care
*A German trial (CONKO-001) demonstrated a significant survival advantage for adjuvant gemcitabine over observation alone; there was no benefit in a Japanese trial of adjuvant cisplatin/5-FU
*Ongoing ESPAC-3 trial attempts to compare observation only to adjuvant 5-FU (ESPAC-1) to adjuvant gemcitabine (CONKO-001)
*to be continued...

==Surgery==
*Only ~10-20% of patients surgical candidates
*Based on Johns Hopkins experience (2007), ~20% will have N0 disease and ~80% will have N1 disease. Lymph node ratio (positive/examined) most powerful predictor of survival
*Perioperative mortality with modern techniques is low (&lt;4%)
*Upon laparoscopy small liver mets and peritoneal implants are found in ~10% of head tumors and up to 40% of body/tail tumors, leading to aborted surgery


*'''Whipple procedure''' - invented in 1935 by Dr. Allen Whipple, an American surgeon. 
**''Remove:'' head of pancreas, duodenum, proximal jejunum, gall bladder, distal common bile duct, regional lymph nodes
**''Reconstruction:'' pancreaticojejunostomy, choledochojejunostomy, gastrojejunostomy



*'''NCCN criteria for resectability:'''
:''Resectable'' - no distant mets, clear fat plane around celiac/SMA, patent SMV
:''Borderline Resectable'' - severe unilateral SMV/portal impingement, abut SMA, gastroduodenal artery encasement up to hepatic artery, limited involvement of IVC, colonic invasion, SMV occlusion
:''Unresectable'' - distant mets (including celiac/para-aortic), SMA/celiac encasement, SMV/portal occlusion, aortic/IVC invasion, SMV invasion below transverse mesocolon


===Preoperative Biliary Drainage===
*'''The Netherlands''' (2003-2008) -- preop biliary drainage vs. surgery only
**'''2010''' PMID 20071702 -- &quot;Preoperative biliary drainage for cancer of the head of the pancreas.&quot; (van der Gaag NA, N Engl J Med. 2010 Jan 14;362(2):129-37.)
**Randomized. 202 patients, obstructive jaundice and bilirubin 2.3 - 14.6 mg/dl. Arm 1) Preoperative biliary drainage for 4-6 weeks vs. Arm 2) No drainage. Both arms followed by surgical resection. Drainage primarily by ERCP placed endoprosthesis. Primary outcome rate of serious complications
***Outcome: Complications drain 74% vs. no drain 39% (RR 0.54, SS). Mortality and LOS no difference
***Conclusion: Routine pre-op biliary drainage increases rate of complications

**Radical surgery failures: LR most common site of failure (50%), mets without LR 13%


===Extent of surgical resection===
*Extent of surgery
**Initial Whipple procedure included distal gastrectomy
**Randomized trial from Johns Hopkins of peri-ampullary tumors concluded that pylorus-sparing pancreaticoduodenectomy has comparable outcomes to pancreaticoduodenectomy with gastrectomy and extended lymph node dissection
*Extent of lymph node dissection
**Extended lymph node dissection initially described in 1973, since standard LND doesn't remove LNs frequently involved with microscopic disease and many patients die with local recurrence
**It became widely adopted in Japan, but because of complexity and no apparent improvement in survival, was not adopted by Western surgeons
**Japanese retrospective series showed superior survival rates to Western series, and prospective randomized trials were undertaken
**Three randomized trials were published, and none showed a survival benefit for extended LND. Meta-analysis published in 2007 also didn't find a survival benefit, and found a trend to worse morbidity
**Lymph node ratio (positive/examined) appears to be the most potent prognostic factor for survival after surgery

***Individual data from 4 randomized trials (GITSG, Norway, EORTC, Japan, ESPAC-1), 875 patients (R0 68%, R1 32%). Pooled hazards ratios calculated. Median F/U 3.7 years
***Outcome: Surgical margin involvement not predictive for survival (HR 1.10, NS), median OS R0 16 months vs. R1 14 months (NS), 5-year OS 16% vs. 15%
***&lt;u&gt;Chemo-RT&lt;/u&gt;: If R0 pooled HR 19% increased risk of death with chemo-RT (NS), median OS chemo-RT 16 months vs. no chemo-RT 16 months (NS); if R1 pooled HR 28% reduction in risk of death (NS), median OS chemo-RT 15 months vs. no chemo-RT 11
***&lt;u&gt;Chemotherapy&lt;/u&gt;: If R0 pooled HR 35% reduction in risk of death with chemo (SS), median OS chemo 21 months vs. no chemo 14 months (SS); if R1 pooled HR 4% increased risk of death with chemo, median OS chemo 15 months vs. 13 months
***Predictors of outcome: tumor size, grade, N-stage, not surgical margin
***Conclusion: Adjuvant chemotherapy alone should be standard of care for either R0 or R1 resections. There may be a role for chemo-RT in R1 resection, but meta-analysis underpowered
***Comment (same issue): widely disparate patients (IA-IIB), some subgroups don't make biological sense (eg R0 no chemo worse outcome than R1 no chemo)

&lt;big&gt;'''Unresectable Pancreatic Cancer'''&lt;/big&gt;
==Epidemiology==
*30-40% are locally advanced, unresectable (30-40% are metastatic, 15-20% resectable)



==Treatment Overview==
*Median survival for untreated patients is ~4 months, and ~7 months with palliative bypass
*EBRT alone had survival ~6 months in 1960's. 
*A randomized trial from Mayo Clinic in unresectable GI tumors (Moertel, 1969) showed that combined chemo-RT is superior to RT alone
*GITSG 9273 confirmed that chemo-RT is superior over RT alone. The outcome of chemo-RT 40/20 split-course was comparable to chemo-RT 60/30 split-course
*GITSG 9283 then compared RT + 5-FU to SMF chemotherapy alone and determined chemoRT was superior to chemo alone.
*Conversely, ECOG trial published around the same time compared 5-FU alone to 5-FU + RT and found no benefit for addition of RT, with more toxicity
*In the US, concurrent 5-FU and RT became standard of care
*Gemcitabine became treatment of choice in metastatic pancreatic cancer, and efforts are made to evaluate its role in unresectable locally advanced disease
*A Taiwan trial showed that gemcitabine + RT is superior to 5-FU + RT, with comparable toxicity
*A French trial was closed prematurely, after 5-FU + RT arm had significantly worse survival compared with gemcitabine alone. Median OS of the chemo-RT arm was comparable to the original GITSG data, despite modern RT and infusional 5-FU
*An ECOG trial (published thus far as abstract), showed that gemcitabine + RT may be superior to gemcitabine alone; however, the trial closed early due to nonaccrual
*At the moment (12/2008), it is not entirely clear what the best strategy is for unresectable patients
*A reasonable strategy may be that proposed by MDACC (see below) of using induction chemotherapy to exclude patients with rapid distant progression, and select patients who benefit from local consolidative chemo-RT

==Palliative bypass==
Median survival is 4 months for untreated patient, 7 months with palliative bypass (gastric or biliary), and 16 months with a Whipple procedure.

==RT +/- Chemotherapy==
*'''ECOG E8282'''   -- RT alone vs. RT + 5-FU + Mitomycin-C
**Randomized. 114 patients with locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. Arm 1) EBRT 59.4 Gy vs. Arm 2) Same EBRT + concurrent 5-FU (1,000 mg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/day by continuous infusion on Days 2-5 and 28-31) and MMC (10 mg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; on Day 2)
**'''2005''' PMID 16029791 -- &quot;A randomized phase III study of radiotherapy alone or with 5-fluorouracil and mitomycin-C in patients with locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the pancreas: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group study E8282.&quot; (Cohen SJ, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2005 Aug 1;62(5):1345-50.)
***Outcome: Response rate RT alone 6% vs. chemo-RT 9%; DFS 5 months vs. 5.1 months (p=0.19); OS 7.1 months vs 8.4 months (p=0.16)
***Conclusion: Addition of 5-FU and MMC increased toxicity without improving DFS or OS. Alternative drugs for radiosensitization may improve outcome.

*'''GITSG 9273'''  (1970's) -- RT 60 Gy vs. RT 40 Gy + 5-FU vs. RT 60 Gy + 5-FU
**Randomized, 3 arms. 194 patients with locally unresectable pancreatic CA. Arm 1) RT alone 60/30 Gy split course (''On interim analysis found inferior and was discontinued)'' vs. Arm 2) RT 40/20 Gy split course + concurrent 5-FU vs. Arm 3) RT 60/30 Gy split course + concurrent 5-FU. Concurrent 5-FU 500 mg/m2, followed by maintenance 5-FU 500 mg/m2 x2 years
**'''1981''' PMID 7284971 &quot;Therapy of locally unresectable pancreatic carcinoma: a randomized comparison of high dose (6000 rads) radiation alone, moderate dose radiation (4000 rads + 5-fluorouracil), and high dose radiation + 5-fluorouracil: The Gastrointestinal Tumor Study Group,&quot; Moertel CG et al.

***Toxicity: No severe GI toxicity &gt;10%
***Conclusion: Concurrent chemo-RT superior to RT alone; C-RT 40 Gy comparable to C-RT 60 Gy

*'''Mayo Clinic''' (1960's) -- RT alone vs. RT + 5-FU
**Randomized. 64 patients with unresectable cancers of the stomach, pancreas, and large bowel. Arm 1) EBRT 35-37.5 Gy vs. Arm 2) Same EBRT + concurrent 5-FU bolus 45 mg/kg
**'''1969''' PMID 4186452 -- &quot;Combined 5-fluorouracil and supervoltage radiation therapy of locally unresectable gastrointestinal cancer.&quot; (Moertel CG, Lancet. 1969 Oct 25;2(7626):865-7.)
***Outcome: median OS RT alone 6.3 months vs. chemo-RT 10.4 months (SS); 1-year OS 6% vs. 22%
***Conclusion: Concurrent chemo-RT significantly augments RT alone

***Outcome: PFS GEM 6.7 months vs. GEM/RT 6.0 months (NS). Median OS 9.2 months vs. 11.1 months (SS)
***Toxicity: Grade 4 or 5 GEM 9% vs. GEM/RT 41% (SS) (1 grade 5 toxicity in each arm)
***Conclusion: Gem+RT had increased but generally manageable toxicity, with improved OS
**'''Editorial''' PMID 21969514 (Philip PA, JCO 29:4066-4068, 2011) Moderate OS benefit with small patient number (wide CI) and no PFS benefit.  In future, need consensus on clinical trial priorities and better systemic therapy.

*'''FFCD-SFRO''' (2000-2005) -- RT + 5-FU vs. gemcitabine alone
**Randomized. ''Stopped prematurely due to worse survival in Chemo-RT arm.'' 119 patients with unresectable pancreatic CA. Arm 1) 3D-RT 60/30 + concurrent 5-FU C.I. 300 mg/m2 + cisplatin 20 mg/m2 vs Arm 2) Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 alone x7 weeks. Both arms then maintenance Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 until disease progression/toxicity. RT technique: GTV = tumor + probably involved LNs. CTV = tumor + peripancreatic, celiac, and hepatic hilar LNs. PTV = CTV + 2cm. Only 42% of Chemo-RT group received at least 75% of planned RT and CT (though 83% received at least 75% of RT); 73% of GEM group received at least 75% of CT
**'''2008''' PMID 18467316 -- &quot;Phase III trial comparing intensive induction chemoradiotherapy (60 Gy, infusional 5-FU and intermittent cisplatin) followed by maintenance gemcitabine with gemcitabine alone for locally advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer.

***Outcome: median OS 5-FU 6.5 months vs. chemo-RT 5.1 months (NS); pancreas subgroup 8.2 months vs. 8.3 months (NS)
***Toxicity: 5-FU alone 27% vs. chemo-RT 51% (SS)
***Conclusion: Adding RT to 5-FU didn't improve survival, and was more toxic

==Induction Chemotherapy + Chemo-RT==
*'''MD Anderson; 2007''' (1993-2005) PMID 17538975 -- &quot;Induction chemotherapy selects patients with locally advanced, unresectable pancreatic cancer for optimal benefit from consolidative chemoradiation therapy.&quot; (Krishnan S, Cancer. 2007 Jul 1;110(1):47-55.)
**Retrospective. 323 patients locally advanced. 247 patients with initial chemo-RT (concurrent 5-FU or GEM), 76 patients induction GEM followed by RT 30/10 concurrent with chemo (5-FU, GEM, or capecitabine). RT 4 field; originally ENI (69%) but since 2001 primary tumor only (31%) to reduce toxicity. Median F/U 5 months
**Outcome: Median OS CRT group 8 months vs. induction-CRT group 12 months (SS). Median time to local progression 6 months vs. 9 months (SS). No difference in patterns of failure
**Conclusion: Induction chemo (2-3 months) may select patients who may optimally benefit from consolidative chemo-RT, by identifying patients who already have micrometastatic disease

**MS: 8 months (30 Gy) vs 9 months (standard dose), NS. 6-mo local disease progression rate: 45% vs 50%, NS; distant metastasis: 54% vs 50%
**Conclusion: &quot;Compared with higher doses given over 5 to 6 weeks, chemoradiation (30 Gy in 10 fractions in 2 weeks with concurrent infusional 5-FU) results in a similar median survival, and local disease progression rates in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer apparently do not substantially improve local disease control or median survival time. Because higher doses of radiotherapy can lead to increased acute treatment-related morbidity, we recommend using 30 Gy in 10 fractions unless the patient is part of a prospective study evaluating novel biologic or cytotoxic radiosensitizers.&quot;

*'''Germany; 2005''' PMID 15783041 -- &quot;Dose escalation of concurrent hypofractionated radiotherapy and continuous infusion 5-FU-chemotherapy in advanced adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.&quot; (Zimmermann FB, Hepatogastroenterology. 2005 Jan-Feb;52(61):246-50.)
**26 pts. Locally advanced (20 pts) or metastatic (6). 
**Concurrent C.I. 5-FU. RT Dose-escalation (all at 4 fractions per week): 1) 24 Gy in 8 fractions (3 Gy/fx); 2) 30 Gy in 10; 3) 36 Gy in 12.
**Toxicity: gr 3 mucositis - 1 pt. gr 2 nausea - 12 pts (46%). gr 2 weakness - 1. No treatment interruption or dose reduction.
**Pain improved in 70% of pts. MS: 8 months (all pts); 9 months (loc adv); 5 mos (metastatic).
**Conclusion: &quot;Dose escalation to 36 Gy in a hypofractionated manner proved to be feasible with low toxicity in patients with locally advanced and metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas and warrants further investigation aiming at optimal tailoring in these two subgroups of patients.&quot;

===IMRT/IGRT===
*'''San Antonio; 2007''' PMID 19262697  &quot;Image-Guided Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy for Pancreatic Carcinoma&quot; (Fuss M, Gastrointestinal Cancer Research,1 (1), p. 2) 
**Retrospective. 41 patients treated with ultrasound IGRT, doses of 55 Gy (range, 45-64 Gy).
**Acute upper GI toxicity was grade 0–1 in 22 patients (53.7%), grade 2 in 16 patients (39%), and grade 3 in 3 patients (7.3%). Lower GI grade 0–1 in 32 patients (78%), grade 2 in 7 patients (17.1%), and grade 4 in 2 patients (4.9%). Treatment was stopped early in 4 patients.
**Conclusion: Daily image-guidance during delivery of IMRT for pancreatic carcinoma is clinically feasible. Safety margin reduction and moderate dose escalation yields preliminary outcomes at least comparable with published survival data.

*'''Washington University; 2005''' [http://astro2005.abstractsnet.com/pdfs/abstract_2550.pdf ASTRO Abstract] &quot;4D CT for Hepatobiliary Malignancies: Organs at Risk and Implications for Gating&quot; (Ma D, ASTRO 2005, Abstract 2550)
**11 patients (1 CCA, 1 ampullary, 9 pancreas) reviewed for end-expiration, mid-inspiration, end inspiration, and mid-expiration respiratory phases. Estimated V18 for RT and LT kidney and V20/V30 for liver
**Liver received more dose during inspiration, max (V20 10%, V30 9%), mean (6% V20, 5% V30); Kidney dose varied
**Conclusion: Individualized patient protocols using gating treatment during inspiration or expiration could potentially reduce dose to liver and kidneys, allowing dose escalation or increased chemotherapy during radiation.

**Retrospective. 15 pts (7 post-surgical, 8 unresectable). IMRT in 25 fx - 45 Gy to lymph nodes, and 45-54 Gy (post-op) or 54 Gy (unresectable) to tumor bed or tumor.
**Well tolerated.

===SBRT boost===
*'''Stanford, 2005''' - PMID 16168826 &quot;Phase II study to assess the efficacy of conventionally fractionated radiotherapy followed by a stereotactic radiosurgery boost in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer,&quot; Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2005 Oct 1;63(2):320-3.
**16 pts tx'd w/ 45 Gy IMRT + concurrent 5FU + 25 Gy SRS boost.
**2 pts had grade 3 toxicity, none had grade 4 toxicity.
**15/16 pts free of local progression until death.

===Primary SBRT===
*'''Stanford'''
**'''Retrospective; 2009''' (2002-2007) PMID 19117351 -- &quot;Stereotactic radiotherapy for unresectable adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.&quot; (Chang DT, Cancer. 2009 Feb 1;115(3):665-72.)
***Retrospective. 77 patients, no surgery (58% locally advanced, 14% medically inoperable, 19% metastatic, 8% locally recurrent), &lt;7.5 cm diameter. GEM-based regimens in 96%. SBRT 25/1. Prior EBRT 45-54 Gy in 16%. Median F/U 6 months (12 months among surviving patients).
***Outcome: LC 6-months 91%, 12-months 84%. Isolated local failure 5%, 5%. Regional failure 12%, but 8/9 concurrent distant failure. PFS 26%, 9%. OS 56%, 21%. 
***Toxicity: Acute Grade 2+ in 5%; Late Grade 3+ 9% (3/10 in patients with prior EBRT). 12-month actuarial late toxicity 25%
***Conclusion: SBRT effective for local control; efforts to reduce complications warranted. Distant mets vast majority of disease-related mortality
**'''Phase II; 2008''' (2004-2006) PMID 18395362 -- &quot;Gemcitabine chemotherapy and single-fraction stereotactic body radiotherapy for locally advanced pancreatic cancer.&quot; (Schellenberg D, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2008 Nov 1;72(3):678-86. Epub 2008 Apr 18.)
***Phase II. 16 patients, locally advanced. GEM 1000 mg/m2 x1 cycle, SBRT 25/1, GEM 1000 mg/m2 until disease progression (median 4 cycles). SBRT to ITV (respiratory expanded GTV) + 2-3 mm margin using fiducial markers. Median F/U 9 months (22 months for living patients)
***Outcome: LC 81%. Median OS 11 months
***Toxicity: Acute GI toxicity mild; Late GI toxicity Grade 2 (ulcers) 5/16, Grade 3 (duodenal stenosis) 1/16, Grade 4 (duodenal perforation) 1/16
***Conclusion: SBRT with GEM resulted in comparable survival to conventional CRT. However, late toxicity was significant
**'''Phase I; 2004''' PMID 15001240 -- &quot;Phase I study of stereotactic radiosurgery in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer.&quot; (Koong AC, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2004 Mar 15;58(4):1017-21.)
***Dose-escalation study. Locally advanced pancreas. Single fractions 15 Gy (3 patients) -&gt; 20 Gy (5 patients) -&gt; 25 Gy (7 patients). ''Trial stopped early prior to reaching MTD due to 100% local control at 25 Gy''
***Toxicity: No Grade 3+
***Conclusion: SRS is feasible; recommend 25 Gy in single fraction
*'''Aarhus, Denmark; 2005''' (2000-2001) PMID 15990186 -- &quot;Phase-II study on stereotactic radiotherapy of locally advanced pancreatic carcinoma.&quot; (Hoyer M, Radiother Oncol. 2005 Jul;76(1):48-53.) 
**Phase II. 22 patients, unresectable. SBRT Dmax 45/3
**Outcome: LF 27%, but only 5% isolated LF. Median OS 6 months; 1-year OS 5%
**Toxicity: Acute toxicity: severe mucositis, ulceration, or perforation 22%
**Conclusion: SBRT poor outcome, unacceptable toxicity, and questionable palliative effect

===Brachytherapy===
*'''Rome 1988-91''' PMID 7538501 -- ''Intraluminal brachytherapy in the treatment of pancreas and bile duct carcinoma.'' ('''1995 Montemaggi''' P, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1995 May 15;32(2):437-43.)
** Retrospective. 12 patients with billiary or pancreatic CA with obstructive jaundice treated with ILRT (20-50 Gy @ 1cm) +/- 5-FU
** Median OS 14 months. 3 patients developed GI toxicity
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Further experience is necessary to determine whether ILBT in the common bile duct and/or in the duct of Wirsung may be, in pancreatic head patients, an alternative boost technique to Interstitial Brachy-therapy (IBT) or Intraoperative Electron Beam Radiation Therapy (IOEBRT).&quot;

===P-32===
*'''South Florida; 2008''' PMID 18266048 -- &quot;(32)P as an Adjunct to Standard Therapy for Locally Advanced Unresectable Pancreatic Cancer: A Randomized Trial.&quot; (Rosemurgy A, J Gastrointest Surg. 2008 Feb 12 [Epub ahead of print])
**Randomized. ''Stopped early.'' 30 patients out of expected 80, biopsy proven unresectable adenoCA. Treated with 5-FU + RT (45 Gy nodal basin, pancreatic boost to 59.4 Gy), followed by Arm 1) intratumoral injection of colloidal chromic P-32 0.5 mCi/g tumor vs. Arm 2) observation. Both arms were followed by gemcitabine.
**Outcome: median OS P-32 7 months vs. control 11 months (NS)
**Severe toxicity: P-32 4% vs. control 2% (SS)
**Conclusion: Intratumoral P-32 did not improve survival, and was associated with more serious adverse events

==Advanced Stage==
*5-FU alone was historically the main treatment; no combination of 5-FU based regimens has shown a benefit
*Gemcitabine became standard treatment in 1997, after showing better symptom control and a modest survival benefit over 5-FU
*Multiple trials evaluating combinations of agents with gemcitabine have not resulted in improved survival
*NCI Canada trial with gemcitabine + erlotinib (Tarceva) suggests a modest survival benefit over gemcitabine alone


*'''Swiss, 2007''' (2001-2004) -- Gemcitabine +/- capecitabine
**Randomized. 319 patients with advanced/metastatic Ca. Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 + Capecitabine 650 mg/m2 vs. Gemcitabine alone
**'''2007''' PMID 17538165 -- &quot;Gemcitabine plus capecitabine compared with gemcitabine alone in advanced pancreatic cancer: a randomized, multicenter, phase III trial of the Swiss Group for Clinical Cancer Research and the Central European Cooperative Oncology Group.&quot; (Herrmann R, J Clin Oncol. 2007 Jun 1;25(16):2212-7.)
**Median OS: 8.4 months vs. 7.2 months (NS). Subgroup KPS 90-100 10.1 months vs. 7.4 months (SS). Toxicity comparable
**Conclusion: No overall benefit to GemCap; subgroup survival benefit with good KPS

*'''NCI Canada CTG PA.3''' -- Gemcitabine +/- erlotinib
**Randomized. 569 patients with unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic pancreatic CA. Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2, erlotinib 100 or 150 mg/d
**'''2007''' PMID 17452677 -- &quot;Erlotinib plus gemcitabine compared with gemcitabine alone in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer: a phase III trial of the National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group.&quot; (Moore MJ, J Clin Oncol. 2007 May 20;25(15):1960-6.)
**Outcome: Median OS: Gem alone 5.9 months vs. Gem + Tarceva 6.2 months (SS); 1-year OS: 17% vs. 23% (SS); PFS also longer
**Toxicity: higher incidence, but most Grade 1-2
**Conclusion: Significantly improved survival

*'''Multi-institutional''' -- 5-FU vs. Gemcitabine
**Randomized. 126 patients, advanced symptomatic pancreatic CA. Treated with Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 vs. 5-FU 600 mg/m2
**'''1997''' PMID 9196156 -- &quot;Improvements in survival and clinical benefit with gemcitabine as first-line therapy for patients with advanced pancreas cancer: a randomized trial.&quot; (Burris HA, J Clin Oncol. 1997 Jun;15(6):2403-13.)
**Outcome: Clinical benefit: Gem 24% vs. 5-FU 5% (SS); Median OS: Gem 5.6 months vs. 5-FU 4.4 months (SS); 1-year OS: Gem 18% vs. 5-FU 2%
**Toxicity: well tolerated

==Epidemiology==
:4th leading cause of cancer-related death in men and women (http://apps.nccd.cdc.gov/uscs/toptencancers.aspx)
:Estimated 31,000 deaths in 2004. (12.3 per 100,000 population)
:Incidence 10th for males, and females. Males: 13.1 per 100,000, Females: 10.2 per 100,000. http://apps.nccd.cdc.gov/uscs/toptencancers.aspx
:Incidence stable over past 20 years but has increased 3-fold since 1920
:Higher incidence in African Americans and males.
:Incidence peaks in 7th and 8th decades. Very uncommon before age 40.
:Risk factors are smoking, high fat diet, obesity.
:60-80% of patients had diabetes diagnosed within the preceding 2 years.

==Anatomy==
*Divisions of the pancreas include the head, uncinate process, neck, body, tail
*Duct of Wirsung is pancreatic duct located in substance of pancreas and draining to common bile duct

*'''Anatomic Landmarks'''
**Celiac axis originates at T11-12
**SMA originates at L1 vertebral body (usually 1cm below celiac axis)

*'''Nodal drainage'''
**Pancreatic head - ant/post pancreaticoduodenal nodes, hepatoduodenal ligament nodes (including porta hepatis), SMA nodes
**Pancreatic body/tail - splenic artery nodes, celiac nodes, SMA nodes, paraaortics, inf pancreatic nodes

==Pathology==
*Adenocarcinoma
*Neuroendocrine 1-2%
*Cystic neoplasms (serous cystadenomas, mucinous cystic neoplasms) &lt;10%
*Intraductal papillary mucinous tumors
*Solid pseudopapillary tumors
*Acinar cell 
*[[Radiation_Oncology/Pancreas/Squamous_Cell|Squamous cell]]
*Primary lymphoma of the pancreas 1%

==Patient characteristics==
*80% have unresectable disease
*52% are Stage IV
*5-year overall survival is lowest of any cancer
*Survival with resection: 48% (1-year), 24% (2-year), 17% (3-year)
*Survival without resection: 23% (1-year), 9% (2-year), 6% (3-year)

==Tumor markers==
*'''CA 19-9''' - has 70% sensitivity, 87% specificity when using a cutoff of 70 U/mL.  Elevated in benign conditions as well, such as cholangitis.  But the higher the CA 19-9, the more likely to have cancer.  The pretreatment level is prognostic.  A decreasing value after treatment with surgery, XRT, or chemo associated with better survival.  


==Prophylactic Hepatic Irradiation==
*'''Tochigi, 2005''' (Japan) (1994-2003) PMID 15995813 -- &quot;Prophylactic hepatic irradiation following curative resection of pancreatic cancer.&quot; (Hishinuma S, J Hepatobiliary Pancreat Surg. 2005;12(3):235-42.)
**Retrospective. 65 patients, 34 with prophylactic hepatic irradiation (PHI), 31 without. RT dose 19.8-22.0 Gy + CI 5-FU
**Complications: 32/34 completed RT; 1 liver abscess, 1 death from hepatic failure without mets
**Liver failure: better in PHI group (p=0.05); Survival: better in PHI group (p=0.0002)

*'''Hopkins, 1997''' (1991-1995) PMID 9193189 -- &quot;Pancreaticoduodenectomy for pancreatic adenocarcinoma: postoperative adjuvant chemoradiation improves survival. A prospective, single-institution experience.&quot; (Yeo CJ, Ann Surg. 1997 May;225(5):621-33; discussion 633-6.). See above. No benefit.

*'''RTOG 8801''' (1988-89) PMID 1571912 -- &quot;High-dose local irradiation plus prophylactic hepatic irradiation and chemotherapy for inoperable adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. A preliminary report of a multi-institutional trial (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group Protocol 8801).&quot; (Komaki R, Cancer. 1992 Jun 1;69(11):2807-12.).
**79 pts w/ unresectable, inoperable, or recurrent T1-3 adenoCA of pancreas.  Tx'd w/ 6120 cGy to pancreas + simultaneous 2340 cGy prophylactic hepatic irradiation.  Pts received concurrent 5FU.
**Hepatic metastases documented in 32%, local progression in 73%, abdominal spread in 27%
**2 grade 5 complications (1 hepatic failure), 9 grade 4 complications (mostly hematologic)
**Conclusion:  PHI may reduce frequency of hepatic metastases, but local progression and abdominal spread ultimately uncontrollable.

Pronunciations are first given in the Ecclesiastical Pronunciation (Based on [[Italian]], and used in some ceremonies by the Catholic church, and usually heard in recordings of classical music). These pronunciations are followed by the classical pronunciation (a reconstruction of how scholars believe the Romans pronounced these expressions)

For example — “of light” lucis {{IPA|/'luʧis/}} (LOO-cheess) {{IPA|/'luːkis/}} (LOO-kiss), with (LOO-cheess) being the ecclesiastical pronunciation, and (LOO-kiss) how the Romans said lucis.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Latvian almost always is pronounced as it is written. Small letters in this section are used to identify English letters, capital letters to identify Latvian letters.

:A as u in m'''u'''g
:Ā as a in c'''a'''r
:B similar to English
:C as ts in '''ts'''unami
:Č as ch in '''ch'''ur'''ch'''
:D similar to English, except that it's pronounced with the tongue pressed to the teeth rather than to the gum.
:E as a in '''a'''pple (wide E) or as e in m'''e'''mory (narrow E)
:Ē long variation of E, as e in wh'''e'''re (narrow Ē)
:G as g in '''g'''un, never as in ''g''em
:Ģ like D and J together
:H as h in '''h'''ouse
:I as i in g'''i'''n
:Ī as ea in m'''ea'''n
:J as y in '''y'''ou
:K as k in s'''k'''ate
:Ķ as T and J together
:L as l in '''l'''ine
:Ļ as L and J together
:M as m '''m'''an
:N similar to english
:Ņ as N and J together
:O as o in m'''o'''rning or short variation of this sound or diphthong UO (UA)
:P as p in s'''p'''ine
:R pronounced similarly to the Spanish '''r'''
:S as s in '''s'''un
:Š as sh in '''sh'''ine
:T as t in s'''t'''ate
:U as oo in f'''oo'''t
:Ū as oo in m'''oo'''n
:V as v in '''v'''acation
:Z as z in '''z'''ebra
:Ž as z in sei'''z'''ure
Finally there are three sounds that are not included in alphabet and are not considered diphthongs either: 
:DZ as D and Z together
:DŽ as j in '''j'''oin 
:N before G or K as ng in si'''ng''' folowed by G or K respectively.

If two vowels appear next to each other they are almost always a diphthong.

==Allophony==

Latvian orthography is phonemic, this means that some sounds might be written different as their pronounced because of relation between the two.

Voiced sounds ''b, d, g, z, ž, dz, dž'' are pronounced voiceless ''p, t, k, s, š, c, č'' (respectively) before other voiceless sounds.
Similarly, voiceless sounds are pronounced voiced before voiced ones.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Numerals==
:1 - viens
:2 - divi
:3 - trīs
:4 - četri
:5 - pieci
:6 - seši
:7 - septiņi
:8 - astoņi
:9 - deviņi
:10 - desmit
:100 - simts
:1000 - tūkstotis
:1000000 - miljons
Names for other numerals up to one million are coined using words above:
* -teen numerals - second numeral + pa + desmit (10) i.e. 14 = četri (4) + pa + desmit (10) = četrpadsmit = four over ten (pa is a preposition which means ''over'' in this case). As you can see the e from the word &quot;desmit&quot; is omitted, as well as the ending of the second numeral. The ending (the very last letter), in case of numerals, is not omitted if a numeral used in coining of word is 3 (trīs) or the numeral is used as last part of the coined word. 
* decimal numerals - first numeral + desmit (10) + second numeral i.e. 41 = četri (4) + desmit (10) + viens (1) = četrdesmit viens. As you see ending of četri (4) is cast off again, desmit (10) doesn`t have ending, therefore it simply can`t be cast off. If second number is zero (&quot;nulle&quot;) then it is not added, thus 30 = trīsdesmit = first nummeral (trīs) + desmit (10)
*Hundreds - first number + simts (100) + decimal number or last number if middle number is zero (&quot;nulle&quot;) i.e. 945 = deviņi (9) + simts (100) + četrdesmit pieci (45) = deviņsimt četrdesmit pieci or 802 = astoņi (8) + simts (100) + divi (2) + astoņsimt divi. If first number is 1 first numeral &quot;viens&quot; is cast off, thus 111 = simtvienpadsmit = simts (100) + viens (1) + pa + desmit (10) not vien + simt vienpadsmit. Again if last numbers are zeros they are not named.
*Thousands - first numeral + tūkstoš (1000) + numeral naming hundred. Again - when naming numbers from 1000 to 1999 first numeral (&quot;viens&quot;) is omitted. If numerals name tens or hundreds of toustands first decimal numeral naming hundred is used i.e. 20 000 = decimal numeral (20) + tūkstoš (1000) = divdesmit tūkstoš or 500 000 = hundred (500) + tūkstoš = piecsimt tūkstoši.

&lt;small&gt;
'''Note 1:''' The Spanish words can be mainly categorized in three groups according to what is the stressed syllable: '''agudas''', when the stressed syllable is the last one; '''llanas''', when the stressed syllable is the penultimate (i.e. the last syllable but one); and '''esdrújulas''', when the stressed syllable is the antepenultimate (i.e. the last syllable but two).
*All the '''agudas''' words which end in vowel or in the consonants ''n'' or ''s'', have a written accent on the stressed syllable (the last one).
*All the '''llanas''' words which do NOT end in vowel nor in consonants ''n'' or ''s'', have a written accent on the stressed syllable (the penultimate one).
*And all the '''esdrújulas''' words have an written accent on the stressed syllable (the antepenultimate one).

'''Note 2:''' The ''s'' and ''th'' {{IPA|[θ]}} are not observed by all the Spanish speakers. In Latin America and some regions of Spain, people pronounce ''z'' and ''c'' before ''e'' and ''i'' (''th'' pronunciation) as an ''s'', this phenomenon is called ''seseo''. On the other hand, when the ''s'' pronunciation is replaced for the ''th'' one, it is called ''ceceo''.

=Extended greetings=
Greetings in Swahili are a crucial aspect of Swahili culture; it is not uncommon for a conversation to go on for several minutes before it actually moves beyond saying what would be considered “hello” in western cultures. There is no generic word for “hello” in the language, rather there are numerous options depending on the relative ages and race of the people involved, as well as singular and plural forms, time of day, and other factors.

* Greetings are somewhat regular and formulaic, with specific responses required (not completely, but somewhat).
* Often, Swahili greetings are structured in a call-and-response format, where a certain initial greeting will require a particular response (for example, ''shikamoo'' is always followed by ''marahaba'').
*Shikamoo means &quot;NIKO CHINI YA MIGUU YAKO&quot;, it is from colonial period where by Black people was ordered to great white people in that way ! (eg. african to Arabs).
* Positive responses are the norm, even more so than in the west. Thus you will not generally respond that you are unwell, regardless of your actual state.
* You will note that some greetings fall into &quot;families,&quot; where many greetings are derived from variations on a theme, such as the ''habari'' family, including habari, habari yako, habari za..., habari gani.

Note that if you mess up with the greetings, or anything else in the language, Swahili people are not likely to become angry or offended, but instead to be somewhat amused, yet understanding and helpful of your language difficulties, especially if you are white-skinned. (African-descended western individuals may face varied difficulties in being mistaken for Africans, including being expected to know the language, at least until the situation becomes clear.)

A non-comprehensive  list would include “hujambo” (reply “sijambo”) for two people of similar age and race, “jambo” (reply “jambo”) for between white and black people, “shikamoo” (reply “marahaba”) for a young person to an elderly person, “hodi” (reply “karibu”) when in the doorway of a house. There are additionally numerous informal greetings such as “mambo”, “safi”, and many more. Farewells are abrupt or even non-existent. ''Habari'' is perhaps the most common and general-use single greeting, as it can range from very informal to semi-formal.

Greetings are shown in rough order of formality, with very formal greetings at the top and very informal ones at the bottom of the table.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]/[[Filipino language|Filipino]] common phrases==
'''Note:''' The more polite or formal forms of some phrases — those which make use of the word ''pô'' — should generally be used when speaking to persons of authority and seniority, or to show reverence to the person to whom spoken. With friends and in casual situations, ''pô'' need not be used. Also, in modern written Filipino/Tagalog, diacritical marks are not essential, and are omitted.

Please note that spoken Tamil is very different from formal written Tamil.

The below phrases are in written Tamil and thus sound very awkward and stilted when used in everyday speech.

                                  Section 1: Education is Key

   Education is key. Education is vital. Education is the future. How many times have we heard 

those same lines over and over again? Well, they’re true. Education is very important and for

 the most of us, will help us out in the long run. Magnet and Charter schools are fairly new 

forms of education our youth. They give parents and care-givers other options besides the 

traditional route.
                                  Section 2: Charter School Myths

	There are several myths about charter schools that need to be dispelled. Charters are 

not private schools; they’re closely connected with public schools. Charter schools are “held 

responsible” with just as much paperwork as any public school. They also face market 

accountability which means funding depends on the number of parents who choose to send their 

children to these schools; if too few parents choose a charter school, it closes. (Maranto, 

B02) 
	Another myth is that charters drain money from traditional public schools. Like all 

public schools, charter schools cost public dollars, leading opponents to claim we cannot 

afford to charter more schools. Yet the real financial picture shows we can’t afford not to. 

(Maranto, B02) One final myth is that charter schools are bad schools. This is not true, when 

traditional public schools fail, they stay open. In contrast, failing charters close – about 

eleven percent nationally. Fear of closure keeps charter principals and teachers on their 

toes. Charter schools have somewhat lower test scores than traditional public schools because 

they tend to serve students who struggled in other schools. Most of these students learn more 

as well. Studies show that students learn more as well. Studies show that students learn more 

in one year in a charter than in a traditional school (Maranto, B02)

                              Section 3: Where Charter Schools Originate From?

	Charter schools are even favored by the Bush administration. They receive taxpayer but 

operate independently of school district rules and teachers’ union contracts. They were 

proposed by Albert Shanker (federation president) in 1988 which led to their appearance in 

1992. Today there are more than 3, 600 charter schools serving more than one million students; 

about 2 percent of all students, according to the center of education reform, a charter 

advocacy group. (Toppo, 4D) 

                                 Section 4: Magnet Schools

	Magnet schools are the latest device to inspire students by giving them choices. They 

usually attract students by concentrating on particular fields, such as the arts, science, 

mathematics, writing, or international studies. (Hechinger, C8:30) The comprehensive magnet 

school does find it difficult to serve all of its diverse clientele. As a result, more 

students drop out and parents look to the private schools. (Hechinger, C8:30)  Studies have 

shown that even though magnet schools do not select the brightest students, the quality of 

education and the students achievements improve.

                              Section 5: Criticism of Magnet Schools

	Magnet schools have drawn plenty of criticism however according to Dr. Maryanne R

Raywid, Hofstra University professor who’s studied magnet schools for twelve years said “they 

give people who attend the school a stake in the school that they don’t have in a school of 

assignment.” (Berger, 2) She says “they tailor schooling to individual children, give teachers 

a greater voice in what gets taught, create competition among schools for students and usually 

make for smaller, more intimate schools. (Berger, 2) One student even said “Everyone knows 

each other…it’s a nice family feeling” (Berger, 2)
	Some magnet schools like Manhattan East select their students on the basis of academic 

records and interviews. So even if a kid did really want to go to a certain magnet school, 

they might not be able to. Even so, there are others who will take underachieving students, 

such as J.H.S 117 which has a school for 93 poorly achieving youngsters from troubled homes.
	

                      Section 5: Who Magnet Schools and Charter Schools Affect?

         There is an estimate that there is more than ten thousand elementary, junior high,

and senior high schools nationwide that can be called magnet or alternative schools. Magnet 

schools’ success could serve as an incentive to the remaining comprehensive schools to seek 

their own paths to better education and to become more attractive to students. Advocates of 

some selective public schools point out that able students reinforce each others’ strengths 

(Hechinger, C8:3) Advocates warn that to eliminate elite institutions is to deprive 

individuals of opportunity and the nation of vital, fine-tuned talent. (Hechinger, C8:3)
	
                                 Section 7: Summary

        Charter schools basically offer the same things as magnet schools. They both give 

underprivileged and academically challenged youth a chance to succeed. Both of them also are 

sponsored by taxpayers’ dollars. Lastly, they offer an alternative option for people who don’t 

want the other route. To summarize it all up, charter and magnet schools represent the future 

of what’s to come in America and how sticking to traditional ways of the past will not 

sufficiently hold up with the immediate competition from the east.

'''Response Paper'''''Italic text''
      
       According to the research I've done, I would say that charter schools and some magnet schools (not all) have good characteristics and a lot to offer our future students. It gives them a chance to do better than what they did in their previous schools. Plus, it gives our educators a chance to teach in different ways in which they wouldn't be able to in a regular public school setting. Also, Charter Schools and Magnet Schools give parents a financial break. They don't have to pay the money they would if they wanted alternate education for their children. All they have to pay is their taxes and that covers that kid's tuition just as if they were at a public school.

       However, I do firmly believe that charter school are better than magnet schools. Magnet schools are not equipped with handling kids with behavioral problems or bullying. I know this firsthand because i attended a magnet middle school (6th through 8th grade) and it was atrocious. I had several bullies who would tease me constantly everyday and i went through several administrators including the principal who only set up a meeting with the bullies in which all they did was deny that they ever did anything wrong. The bullies were never punished or anything.

       The magnet school which I went to was called Jones Magnet Middle School by the way and it did not select students based on academia. It accepted kids through a basic lottery. I was one of the unlucky few that was chosen. (My mother actually pushed me to go there, I did not want to go.) I did learn there but I felt that I could did just the same at any other middle school in the area. The only difference between our school and the others was the fact that we did cornell notes and others didn't.

       In conclusion, charter schools are better than magnet schools. They are because they often specialize in things that make children feel included rather than secluded. Magnet school often make it seem like the smart kids are penalized for their smarts rather than let them feel a part of the crowd or family. In short, kids who are bullied suffer long term self-esteem problems in which others suffers too. When everyone is treated equally only then will you see society as a whole prosper.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The rise of the Abbasids in the 8th century AD and the policy of ethnic and cultural tolerance they pursued led to a Persian literary revival. The period lasting from the beginning of the 9th century AD when Harun Al Rashid was on the throne to to the end of the end of the 13th century AD when the Ilkhanids grabbed power in Iran could well be termed as the '''Iranian Renaissance'''. Culture and arts flourished and the Iranian civilization was highly recognized and regarded by the Arabs, Europeans and Moors who borrowed heavily from it.

== Zoroastrian Writings of the 9th century AD ==

The oldest extant books of the Zoroastrian religion (including the oldest version of the Avesta in existence) date only from the 9th century AD. Whatever we know of early Zoroastrianism and the life of Zoroaster are through the books written during the period between the last days of Abbasid rule and the decline of the Ghaznavid dynasty in the 11th century AD. This period is generally recognized as a period of Persian as well as Zoroastrian literary revival.

The Zoroastrian literary revival began during the reign of the Abbasid caliph Al Mamun who encouraged Zoroastrian as well as Islamic literary scholars.  The oldest extant version of the Avesta was written during this period and attested in the ''Dinkard'', a work belonging to the 9th century AD. Masud (who probably lived during the same time) makes references to Zoroaster and the heretic Mani. 

One Zoroastrian writer of note who lived during this period was a high-priest of Pars and Kirman called Minushchir who produced a revised version of the Bundashisn, the Zoroastrian myth of Creation. Minushchir also wrote the ''Dadestan-i-Denik'' in the year 881.  His brother Zadsparam is regarded as the author of ''Vichitakiha-i-Zadsparam'' or ''The Selections of Zadsparam''. The ''Epistles of Minushchir'' is a compilation based on a letter sent by Minushchir to his younger brother Zadsparam on March 15, 881 in condemnation of a decree issued by the latter who had recently been appointed as the High-priest of Sirkan near Kirman.

The ''Dinkard'' is one of the most important works written in the early part of the 9th century AD. Its writer is mentioned as one Atur-frobag, a Zoroastrian high-priest who had an argument with a Zoroastrian heretic called Abalis in the presence of the caliph Al Mamun. The book was eventually completed during the time of his grandson ''Aturpad''. Contemporary with Aturpad was Mardan Farrukh who wrote ''Sikand Gumanik Vigar'' or ''doubt-dispelling explanation'' in which he seeks to establish the superiority of the Zoroastrian religion over others. Mardan Farrukh makes references to a manuscript by Roshan, a son of Atur-frobag mentioned in the Pahlavi commentaries on the Avesta and Atur-frobag's grandson Aturpad who is also considered to be a contemporary of Zadsparam. A colophon appended to an existing manuscript of the Dinkard says that the book was thoroughly revised by one Mahvindad in the year 1020. However, the colophon refers to only the third and fourth books of the Dinkard and alludes it to Aturpad implying that the first two books had already been lost. These might probably have been the oldest books of the Dinkard written by Atur-frobag in the early part of the 9th century AD. The ''Din Vigirgard'' contains a list of all the extant ''Nasks'' of the ''Avesta''.

Zoroastrian works of note continued to produced in Iran until the 1100s and the 1200s. One of the last notable Zoroastrian compilations was the ''Zartosht-Namah'' written in 1278. This was heavily derived from the fifth and the eighth books of the Dinkard which speaks of the life of Zoroaster. By the start of the 14th century AD, the renaissance period had come to an end. The end of the Zoroastrian literary renaissance corresponded to the end of the transition of the character of the Iranian nation from Zoroastrian to Muslim. However, strangely, this transition was not brought due to the intolerance of the Muslim rulers of the country but by the destructive effects of the Mongol invasions which nearly wiped out Zoroastrianism from the country. However, Zoroastrian precepts did survive and were incorporated into Sufist Islam.

Almost all holy books of the Zoroastrian religion written after the fall of the Sassanian Empire were in Pahlavi. The Avesta was no longer understood without a Pahlavi commentary known as the Zand thereby lending it the name the ''Zend Avesta''.

== Early Muslim Writers ==

The first Muslim Persian scholar was '''Abdullah Ibn al-Muqaffa'''. A native of Fars who spent most of his life in Baghdad, he translated the ''Kalileh-o-Demneh''(the Indian ''Panchatantra'') from Middle Persian into Arabic. He was however murdered around 756 by the Caliph Al Mansur on charges of heresy. '''Sahih al-Bukhari''', a native of Bukhara is credited with the compilation of the ''Hadith''. However, these writers wrote almost exclusively in Arabic as also other Persian writers of the Umayyad era like Sibawayh, Dinawari, Baladuri and Naubakht.

Post-Sassanian Persian literature has its origin from the time of '''Rudaki''' whose full name was '''Abdullah Jafar Ibn Mohammad Rudaki''' who is the first notable Persian writer to make use of the new Perso-Arabic script. He was born in 858 in Rudak (Panjrud), a village in Khorasan, Persia which now forms a part of Tajikistan. For a time, he served as the court-poet of the Samanid ruler Nasr II in Bukhara. He is regarded as the father of Persian literature and the Sultan of Persian poets. Over 1,300,000 verses have been attributed to him out of which  around 52 qasidas, ghazals and rubais have survived. He is also credited with having prepared a retranslation of the Arabic Kalileh-o-Demneh to Persian,  a work has been lost to time. Rudaki has been the subject of a number of modern European biographies. Translations of his works are extensively available.

'''Mansur Al Hajjaj''' was another prominent Persian writer and one of the earliest exponents of the Sufism. He was born in 858 in Shushatar in the Khuzestan province of Western Iran. His grandfather is believed to have been a Zoroastrian who converted to Islam. However, despite his Persian ancestry, Mansur wrote almost entirely in Arabic. His Sufi writings, however, provoked the ire of the Abbasid Caliphs and he was executed for heresy in 922. '''Ibn Khafif''' or '''Mohammad Ibn Khafif'''was another prominent Persian Sufi writer and poet  from the period.

== Firdausi ==

'''Firdausi''' or '''Ferdowsi''' as Western scholars called him, was arguably the greatest poet Iran has ever produced. He was born '''Hakim Abul Kasim Firdausi Tusi''' at a minor place called Tus in Khorasan in the year 935. His father was a wealthy landowner and Firdausi himself was a pious Muslim. 

When he was just 23 years old, he came across a copy of the ''Shahnameh'' written in prose form by Abu-Mansour Almoammari. With the help of Almoammari's prose version and other earlier versions of the story, Firdausi started the composition of the epic in 977. The epic took 35 years to complete and Firdausi's inital intention was to present the epic before the Samanid ruler of Northern Iran. However, by the time Firdausi had completed the work (in 1012), the Samanid Empire had fallen and Mahmud Ghaznavi the first of the Ghaznavid kings sat on the throne. 

Firdausi approached Mahmud nGhaznavi with the manuscript of the ''Shahnameh'' but Mahmud Ghaznavi failed to reward him suitably. Firdausi stormed out of the palace in rage and returned to his hometown of Tus where he continued to pen poems. In one of his poems, he condemns Mahmud Ghaznavi in unequivocal terms, its last line containing the following curse:

{{quote|Heaven's vengeance will not forget. Shrink tyrant from my words of fire, and tremble at a poet's ire}}

Ferdowsi is said to have died around 1020 in poverty at the age of 85. One tradition claims Mahmud repented of his actions and sent the amount promised to Firdausi in the year 1020 but when the messengers reached his house, they found that he had died a few hours earlier. The promised reward was then offered to his daughter, who according to one version, refused to accept the sum.

=== The ''Shahnameh'' ===

The '''Shah Namah''' or '''Shahnameh''', the ''Epic of the Kings'', is regarded as one of the gems of classical Persian literature along with Umar Khayyam's ''Rubaiyyat'' and Rumi's ''Masnavi''.  It is a semi-mythical epic poem of a non-Islamic character, the different personages derived from the earlier legends and folklore of pre-Islamic Iran.

It is composed of over 990 chapters and 60,000 couplets and describes the history of Iran from times of the first man ''Gayomard'' to the Islamic conquest of Iran. It is more than seven times the size of Homer's ''Iliad''. The work is replete with Iranian nationalistic feeling. 

Despite being a Muslim, Ferdowsi was grieved by the fall of the Iranian empire and its subsequent rule by Arabs and Turks. The Shahnameh is largely his effort to preserve the memory of Iran's golden days and transmit it to a new generation so that they could learn and try to build a better world.

The epic starts with the birth of ''Gayomard'', the ''Adam'' of the Iranians and the establishment of the Iranian monarchy. The epic then describes the reigns of the legendary Persian monarchs ''Gayomard'', ''Husheng'' and ''Jamshed'' ans their descendants. The epic also describes in vivid detail the fall of Jamshed and the brief interval when Iran was ruled by ''Zohak'', the Yemeni whom Firdausi regards as the agent of ''Ahriman''.  The revolution and the origins of the ''Durufsh-i-Kaviyani'', the leather-apron of the blacksmith and Kayanian loyalist ''Kawah'' which later became the national standard of Iran and the restoration of the line of Kayanid princes under ''Feridun'' is also described in detail.

A parallel story concerning the lineages of the Persian feudatories of Sistan (referred to as the ''Pahlavas'' of ''Zabulistan'') runs alongside the main one. Right from the incident of the partitioning of the Empire between Feridun's sons, Salm (who became the king of Rome), Tur (who became king of Turan) and Irikh (who became the king of Iran), the tale of the kings of Iran is replete with the disputes and animosities between Iran and Turan. ''Rustam'', the ''Pahlava'' of ''Zabulistan'' is the focal point of the narrative and most of the second half of the story starting with Feridun's restoration revolves around him. Historians and archaeologists tend to identify Rustam with Surena, the Parthian commander at the Battle of Carrhae and Rustam Farrokhzad who died fighting in the Battle of Al Qadesiyyah. However, the semi-divine attributes assigned to Rustam by Firdausi make it highly impossible. Rather, Rustam could have been a pure mythical character inspired by historical peronages as Surena and Rustam Farrokhzad.

== Al Beruni ==

'''Abu Rayhan Al Biruni''' also known as Al Beruni was a Persian writer, scientist, anthropologist and alchemist who lived during the time of Mahmud Ghaznavi. He was born at Kath in Khwarezn on September 15, 973. He belonged to the court of Mahmud Ghaznavi and was a part of Ghaznavi's entourage which made way to India. He is especially known for his books on Indians and their daily life.

Biruni's works number 146 in total. These include 35 books on astronomy, 4 on astrolabes, 23 on astrology, 5 on chronology, 2 on time measurement, 9 on geography, 10 on geodesy and mapping theory, 15 on mathematics (8 on arithmetic, 5 on geometry, 2 on trigonometry), 2 on mechanics, 2 on medicine and pharmacology, 1 on meteorology, 2 on mineralogy and gems, 4 on history, 2 on India, 3 on religion and philosophy, 16 literary works, 2 books on magic, and 9 unclassified books.

=== Indology ===

Al Beruni is regarded as one of the early Muslim Indologists. He had written a few books on the Indian people and their customs and practices which provide a vivid picture of the state of affairs at that time. He is considered as a pioneer of '''anthropology''' and '''comparitive theology''' and his works on India constitute one of the first Muslim studies of the Hindu religion.Besides, he was also the first Muslim scholar to understand the Hindu concept of ''Advaita''. In one of his works, he writes:

{{quote|The Hindus believe with regard to God that he is one, eternal, without beginning and end, acting by free-will, almighty, all-wise, living, giving life, ruling, preserving; one who in his sovereignty is unique, beyond all likeness and unlikeness, and that he does not resemble anything nor does anything resemble him}}

=== Science ===

Al Beruni correctly measured the size of the earth, its radius and circumference. He also wrote books on the ''Geology of India''. He has catalogued precious minerals and stones in his ''Kitab Al-Jawahir'' or &quot;Book of Precious Stones&quot; which is considered to be an authority of gemology.

The Al-Biruni crater, on the Moon, is named after Biruni. Tashkent Technical University (formerly Tashkent Polytechnic Institute) is also named after Abu Rayhan al-Biruni.

== Avicenna ==

'''Abu Ali Al Hussain ibn Abd Allah ibn Sina''' also known as '''Ibn Sina''' or '''Avicenna''' was a Persian Muslim astronomer, chemist, Hafiz, logician, mathematician, poet, psychologist, physicist, scientist, Sheikh, soldier, statesman and theologian.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Rat race: Perception of reality==
In today's world no one does large commercial level games just for fun any more, especially in the PC architecture (or at least we rarely learn more about those crazy people after the beta stage or the first independent release). If you are investing time into producing a game you should define first the reasons that lead you to commit to such a difficult, time and resource intensive task before you lose any more time and money. Then select the target architectures (or framework if portability is achievable).

When creating &quot;real games&quot; (prototypes or flash demos not included) one is mostly proposing to do a big production, since it must compete in the market against multimillionaire projects that will cost more to produce than some of the blockbuster movies coming out of Hollywood today. This of course has some exceptions, in small markets (very specific genders) and new platforms, there may be a initial time-frame where establishing a foothold is possible before competition gets impossible for a small enterprise.

One will either be in this field either for fun or profit, the latter of which being very hard to attain. Just consider your chances in the gaming market: most projects without a great concept or good planning will never be finished or will be sold to a corporate machine at prototype stage. They are the only ones that can successfully promote it, and support extra licenses, artwork and give it a known brand. If you are lucky you will be included on the developing team but the design and marketing gremlins will erase from your mind the idea to ever call it your baby. Today we can count on a single hand game author's games like [[w:Sid Meier|Sid Meier]], [[w:David Braben|David Braben]] or [[w:Shigeru Miyamoto|Shigeru Miyamoto]]. Those that are able to make it into the limelight must take special care not only in protecting a great concept, but must be able to see it implemented as they envisioned it by retaining creative control of their work.

=== Software Houses ===
The game industry is formed by game labels, most of which are software and distribution houses. Several may also provide the Operating Systems or the hardware where games will run on. This is done in arcades, personal computers, consoles, mobile phones or other small consumer devices.

      <comment>/* Issues in mapping to RDF */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">For the Emp-DEPT case study, RDF must be generated from underlying XML files. An XQuery script generates the RDF.  It uses a configuration file to define how columns of a table should be mapped into RDF and the namespaces to be used. This mapping needs a little more work to allow composite keys and allow user defined transformations.  An interactive tool to create this map would be useful.

== Issues in mapping to RDF ==

The main guide to publishing linked data on the web is [http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/bizer/pub/LinkedDataTutorial/ How to Publish Linked Data on the Web].  This work connected with the Wikibook entry consists in progressively applying the principles enunciated there.

This conversion illustrates a few of the differences between local datasets, whether SQL or XML, and a dataset designed to fit into a global database.  Some decisions remain unclear.
* tables are implicitly within an organisational context. This context has to be added in RDF by creating a namespace for the local properties and identifiers
* the scope of queries is implicitly within organisational boundaries, but in RDF this scope needs to be explicit. In  the SQL query '''select * from emp;''' emp is ambiguously either the class of employees or the set of employees in the company.  In RDF this needs to be explicit, so that two kind of tuples need to be added:
** tuples to type employees to a company definition of employee 
** tuples to relate the employee to the company (to be added)
*  linkage to the global database requires two kinds of links:
** local properties need to be mapped to global predicates. Here the employee name is mapped to foaf:surname (but the case probably needs changing).  Alternatively a local predicate f:name could be defined, which is equated to the foaf predicate with owl:samePropertyAs.
** local identifiers of resources to be replaced by global URIs.  Here location is mapped to a dbpedia  resource URI. Alternatively, the local URI f:location/Dallas  could be equated to the dbPedia resource with owl:sameAs. (where? and why delay this?)
* foreign keys are replaced by full URIs, pointing directly to the linked resource. The name of this property is no longer the name of the foreign key (e.g. MgrNo but rather the name of the related resource (Manager). However, the foreign key itself might also need to be replaced.
* primary keys are also replaced by URIs, but the local primary key value, for example the employee number, will need to be retained as a literal if it is not purely a surrogate key. This perhaps should be mapped to rdf:label.
* datatypes are preferably explicit in the data to avoid conversion in queries although this increases the size of the RDF graph.
* namespaces have been expanded in full where they occur in RDF attribute values.  An alternative would be to define entities in an DTD prolog as shorthand for these namespaces, but not all processors of the RDF would do the expansion. xml:base can be used to default one namespace.

[The choices made here are those of a novice and review would be welcome. ]

Some issues not yet addressed:
* meta-data about the dataset as a whole - its origin, when and how converted, - these can be DC properties of a document, with each entity tied to that document as a part?
* an alternative approach to mapping would be to start with an ontology and add mapping information to it rather than generating it from the ad-hoc configuration file.

== Configuration file ==
To facilitate the conversion from XML to RDF, a separate configuration file is defined. Here is the configuration file for the emp-dept data. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;XML-to-RDF&gt;
  &lt;namespaces&gt;
        &lt;namespace prefix=&quot;f&quot; uri=&quot;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/empdept/concept/&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;namespace prefix=&quot;ft&quot; uri=&quot;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/empdept/&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;namespace prefix=&quot;rdf&quot; uri=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;namespace prefix=&quot;rdfs&quot; uri=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;namespace prefix=&quot;foaf&quot; uri=&quot;http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;namespace prefix=&quot;xs&quot; uri=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/namespaces&gt;
    &lt;map type=&quot;emp&quot; prefix=&quot;f&quot;&gt;
        &lt;source file=&quot;/db/Wiki/empdept/emp.xml&quot; path=&quot;//Emp&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;col name=&quot;EmpNo&quot; pk=&quot;true&quot; uribase=&quot;ft:emp&quot; type=&quot;xs:string&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;col name=&quot;Ename&quot; prefix=&quot;rdfs&quot; tag=&quot;label&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;col name=&quot;Sal&quot; type=&quot;xs:integer&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;col name=&quot;Comm&quot; type=&quot;xs:integer&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;col name=&quot;HireDate&quot; type=&quot;xs:date&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;col name=&quot;MgrNo&quot; tag=&quot;Mgr&quot; uribase=&quot;ft:emp&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;col name=&quot;MgrNo&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;col name=&quot;DeptNo&quot; tag=&quot;Dept&quot; uribase=&quot;ft:dept&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;col name=&quot;Ename&quot; prefix=&quot;foaf&quot; tag=&quot;surname&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;col name=&quot;Job&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/map&gt;
    &lt;map type=&quot;dept&quot; prefix=&quot;f&quot;&gt;
        &lt;source file=&quot;/db/Wiki/empdept/dept.xml&quot; path=&quot;//Dept&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;col name=&quot;Dname&quot; prefix=&quot;rdfs&quot; tag=&quot;label&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;col name=&quot;Dname&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;col name=&quot;Location&quot; uribase=&quot;http://dbpedia.org/resource&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;col name=&quot;DeptNo&quot; pk=&quot;true&quot; uribase=&quot;ft:dept&quot; type=&quot;xs:string&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/map&gt;
    &lt;map type=&quot;salgrade&quot; prefix=&quot;f&quot;&gt;
        &lt;source file=&quot;/db/Wiki/empdept/salgrade.xml&quot; path=&quot;//SalGrade&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;col name=&quot;HiSal&quot; type=&quot;xs:integer&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;col name=&quot;LoSal&quot; type=&quot;xs:integer&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;col name=&quot;Grade&quot; pk=&quot;true&quot; uribase=&quot;ft:grade&quot; type=&quot;xs:integer&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;col name=&quot;Grade&quot; prefix=&quot;rdfs&quot; tag=&quot;label&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/map&gt;

&lt;/XML-to-RDF&gt;

&lt;/source&gt;

== Data base conversion functions ==

One function '''row-to-rdf''' generates the RDF for a row of a table, another function '''map-to-schema''' generates RDFS descriptions of the predicates used in a table.

&lt;/source&gt;

== Full database conversion ==
The script to generate the RDF for the full database:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
import module namespace fr=&quot;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/wiki/fr&quot;   at  &quot;fr.xqm&quot;;
declare namespace rdf = &quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&quot;;
declare namespace rdfs = &quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#&quot;;

declare variable $config :=  doc(request:get-parameter(&quot;config&quot;,()));
declare variable $x := fr:declare-namespaces($config);

&lt;rdf:RDF&gt;
{
  for $map in $config//map
  let $xml := doc($map/source/@file)
  let $source := util:eval(concat(&quot;$xml&quot;,$map/source/@path))
  return 
        (for $row in $source  return fr:row-to-rdf($row,$map),
         fr:map-to-schema($map)
        )
}
&lt;/rdf:RDF&gt;

&lt;/source&gt;

== Resource RDF ==

In addition each resource is retrieved as RDF.  In this simple example, the request for a resource URI like:

 http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/empdept/emp/7839

is re-written by Apache to 
 
 http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/RDF/empdeptrdf.xq?emp=7839

and the script retrieves the RDF:Description of the selected resource from the RDF file directly.

This mechanism does not conform to the recommended practice of distinguishing between information resources (such as the information about employee 7839) and the real world entity  being represented.  At present, the resource URI de-references directly to the RDF, rather than to indirect using the 303 mechanism recommended.


&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;

declare namespace rdf = &quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&quot;;
declare variable $rdf := doc(&quot;/db/Wiki/RDF/empdept.rdf&quot;);
declare option exist:serialize &quot;media-type=application/rdf+xml&quot;;

(: better to just parse the uri itself :)

let $param := request:get-parameter-names()
let $type := $param[1]
return 
   if ($type=&quot;all&quot;) 
   then 
      $rdf
   else
      let $key := request:get-parameter($type,())
      let $resourceuri := concat(&quot;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/empdept/&quot;,$type,&quot;/&quot;,$key)
      return
      &lt;rdf:RDF&gt;
          {$rdf//rdf:Description[@rdf:about=$resourceuri]}
     &lt;/rdf:RDF&gt;
 
&lt;/source&gt;

== To Do ==
* compound primary keys
* conversion functions, for example to convert the case of strings, reformat dates
* added resources and relationships - here the a company entity and links from departments to company

      <text xml:space="preserve">The following script provides, via a Joseki server at UWE, a query interface to RDF.  Literal language and datatype are ignored in this representation.  URIs link to the browse query and also directly to the resource.

A function converts the SPARQL XML Query result to a table, with links.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;

declare function fr:sparql-to-table($rdfxml,$script-name ) {
(: literal language and datatype ignored in this representation.  URI links to the browse query and directly to the resource are generated :)
    let $vars := $rdfxml//sr:head/sr:variable/@name
    return
  &lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      {for $var in  $vars
         return
          &lt;th&gt;{string($var)}&lt;/th&gt;
      }
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    { for  $row in $rdfxml//sr:results/sr:result
     return
     &lt;tr&gt;
            { for $var in $vars
              let $binding  := $row/sr:binding[@name=$var]/*          
              return                
                 &lt;td&gt;
                  {  typeswitch ($binding)
                        case element(sr:uri)  return
                           (&lt;a href=&quot;{$script-name}?uri={string($binding)}&quot;&gt;{ string($binding) }&lt;/a&gt;,  
                            &lt;a href=&quot;{string($binding)}&quot;&gt; ^ &lt;/a&gt; 
                            )                            
                       case element(sr:literal) return
                          string($binding)    
                       case element (sr:bnode) return
                           concat(&quot;_:&quot;,$binding)
                        default  return
                            ()
                    }
                 &lt;/td&gt;
             }
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      }
   &lt;/table&gt;
 };
 &lt;/source&gt;

The SPARQL interface uses the configuration file to declare the namespaces.

&lt;source lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;

import module namespace fr=&quot;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/wiki/fr&quot;   at  &quot;fr.xqm&quot;;
declare namespace rdf = &quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&quot;;

declare variable $config-file := request:get-parameter(&quot;config&quot;, &quot;/db/Wiki/RDF/empdeptconfig.xml&quot;);
declare variable $config := doc($config-file);
declare variable $graph :=  concat(&quot;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/RDF/xml2rdf.xq?config=&quot;,$config-file);
declare variable $default-engine := &quot;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/joseki/sparql&quot;;
declare variable $script-name :=   tokenize(request:get-uri(),'/')[last()];

where {
      {&lt;uri&gt; ?p ?o }
      UNION
      {?s ?p &lt;uri&gt;}
      UNION
      {?s &lt;uri&gt; ?o}
   }&quot;;
   
let $config-prolog := fr:sparql-prefixes($config)
let $query := request:get-parameter (&quot;query&quot;,())
let $uri := request:get-parameter(&quot;uri&quot;,())   
let $engine := request:get-parameter(&quot;engine&quot;,$default-engine)
let $query := 
   if ($uri)
   then  replace($browse,&quot;uri&quot;,$uri)
   else $query

                      &quot;&amp;amp;query=&quot;,encode-for-uri($queryx) 
                     )
let $result  :=
       if ($query !=&quot;&quot;)
       then
          fr:sparql-to-table(doc($sparql), $script-name) 
       else ()
return
&lt;html xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;&gt;
   &lt;head&gt; 
      &lt;title&gt;Emp-dept Query&lt;/title&gt;
   &lt;/head&gt;
   &lt;body&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;Emp-dept Query&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;form action=&quot;{$script-name}&quot;&gt;
          &lt;textarea name=&quot;query&quot; rows =&quot;8&quot; cols=&quot;90&quot;&gt;
             {$query}
        &lt;/textarea&gt;
        &lt;br/&gt;
        &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot;/&gt;
     &lt;/form&gt;
     &lt;h2&gt;Result&lt;/h2&gt;
         {$result}
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

&lt;/source&gt;

== Application ==

[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/RDF/sparqlquery.xq  Query]


The interface expands a query  like 
   select ?name ?job where {
    ?emp rdf:type  f:emp.
    ?emp foaf:surname ?name.
    ?emp f:Job ?job.
   }

into:

  prefix foaf: &lt;http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/&gt;
  prefix rdf: &lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&gt;
  prefix rdfs: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#&gt;
  prefix f: &lt;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/concept/&gt;
  prefix xs: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#&gt;
  select ?name ?job 
  from &lt;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/RDF/xml2rdf.xq?config=/db/Wiki/RDF/empdeptconfig.xml&quot;&gt;
  where {
    ?emp rdf:type  f:emp.
    ?emp foaf:surname ?name.
    ?emp f:Job ?job.
  }

and sends this to the Joseki service. The graph to query is actually passed as the default graph rather than in the from clause.

== To do ==
* handle language and datatype
* local URIs as local names rather than full URIs#
* better handling of default graph - should be able to reference the cached rdf defined in the config file

== Overview ==

An '''''Ashwinder''''' is a thin, ash-coloured serpent that is born from the embers of a magical fire.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

The lifespan of an Ashwinder is short; they live for only an hour.  Their primary purpose is to find a secluded area within the home to lay their eggs.  Following the egg-laying, the parent ashwinder will collapse into dust.  Ashwinder eggs are bright red and can give off intense heat.  If not frozen with an appropriate charm, the eggs can ignite the the dwelling within minutes.  An ashy trail left by Ashwinders may assist in locating the eggs before any damage happens.

Frozen Ashwinder eggs are valuable. They are used in love potions, and can be eaten whole as a cure for ague.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Trip Generation''' is the first step in the conventional four-step transportation forecasting process (followed by [[Fundamentals of Transportation/Destination Choice|Destination Choice]], [[Fundamentals of Transportation/Mode Choice|Mode Choice]], and [[Fundamentals of Transportation/Route Choice|Route Choice]]), widely used for forecasting travel demands. It predicts the number of trips originating in or destined for a particular traffic analysis zone.

Every trip has two ends, and we need to know where both of them are. The first part is determining how many trips originate in a zone and the second part is how many trips are destined for a zone. Because land use can be divided into two broad category (residential and non-residential) we have models that are household based and non-household based (e.g. a function of number of jobs or retail activity).

For the residential side of things, trip generation is thought of as a function of the social and economic attributes of households (households and housing units are very similar measures, but sometimes housing units have no households, and sometimes they contain multiple households, clearly housing units are easier to measure, and those are often used instead for models, it is important to be clear which assumption you are using). 

At the level of the traffic analysis zone, the language is that of land uses &quot;producing&quot; or ''attracting'' trips, where by assumption trips are &quot;produced&quot; by households and &quot;attracted&quot; to non-households. Production and attractions differ from origins and destinations. Trips are produced by households even when they are returning home (that is, when the household is a destination). Again it is important to be clear what assumptions you are using.


== Activities ==

People engage in activities, these activities are the &quot;purpose&quot; of the trip.
Major activities are home, work, shop, school, eating out, socializing, recreating, and serving passengers (picking up and dropping off). There are numerous other activities that people engage on a less than daily or even weekly basis, such as going to the doctor, banking, etc. Often less frequent categories are dropped and lumped into the catchall &quot;Other&quot;.

Every trip has two ends, an origin and a destination.   Trips are categorized by ''purposes'', the activity undertaken at a destination location.

Some observations:
* Men and women behave differently on average, splitting responsibilities within households, and engaging in different activities,
* Most trips are not work trips, though work trips are important because of their peaked nature (and because they tend to be longer in both distance and travel time),
* The vast majority of trips are not people going to (or from) work.

People engage in activities in sequence, and may chain their trips. In the Figure below, the trip-maker is traveling from home to work to shop to eating out and then returning home.

== Specifying Models ==

How do we predict how many trips will be generated by a zone?  The number of trips originating from or destined to a purpose in a zone are described by trip rates (a cross-classification by age or demographics is often used) or equations. First, we need to identify what we think the relevant variables are.

=== Home-end ===

The total number of trips leaving  or returning to homes in a zone may be described as a function of:

&lt;math&gt;
T_h = f(housing\ units,\ household\ size,\ age,\ income,\ accessibility,\ vehicle\ ownership).
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Home-End Trips are sometimes functions of:
* Housing Units
* Household Size
* Age
* Income
* Accessibility
* Vehicle Ownership
* Other Home-Based Elements

=== Work-end ===
At the work-end of work trips, the number of trips generated might be a function as below:

&lt;math&gt;
T_w = f ( jobs(area\ of\ space\ by\ type,\ occupancy\ rate))
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Work-End Trips are sometimes functions of:
* Jobs
* Area of Workspace
* Occupancy Rate
* Other Job-Related Elements

=== Shop-end ===

Similarly shopping trips depend on a number of factors:

&lt;math&gt;
\,\!T_s = f (number\ of\ retail\ workers,\ type\ of\ retail,\ area,\ location,\ competition)
&lt;/math&gt;

Shop-End Trips are sometimes functions of:
* Number of Retail Workers
* Type of Retail Available
* Area of Retail Available
* Location
* Competition
* Other Retail-Related Elements

== Input Data ==

A forecasting activity conducted by planners or economists, such as one based on the concept of economic base analysis, provides aggregate measures of population and activity growth. Land use forecasting distributes forecast changes in activities across traffic zones. 

== Estimating Models ==

Which is more accurate: the data or the average?  The problem with averages (or aggregates) is that every individual’s trip-making pattern is different.

=== Home-end  ===

To estimate trip generation at the home end, a cross-classification model can be used, this is basically constructing a table where the rows and columns have different attributes, and each cell in the table shows a predicted number of trips, this is generally derived directly from data.

In the example cross-classification model:
The dependent variable is trips per person. 
The independent variables are dwelling type (single or multiple family), household size (1, 2, 3, 4, or 5+ persons per household), and person age. 

The figure below shows a typical example of how trips vary by age in both single-family and multi-family residence types.

[[Image:TripGeneration01.png|width=300px|height=150px]]

The figure below shows a moving average.

[[Image:TripGeneration02.png|width=300px|height=150px]]

=== Non-home-end  ===

The trip generation rates for both “work” and “other” trip ends can be developed using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression (a statistical technique for fitting curves to minimize the sum of squared errors (the difference between predicted and actual value) relating trips to employment by type and population characteristics. 

The variables used in estimating trip rates for the work-end are Employment in Offices (&lt;math&gt;E_{off}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;), Retail (&lt;math&gt;E_{ret}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;), and Other (&lt;math&gt;E_{oth}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;)

A typical form of the equation can be expressed as:

&lt;math&gt;T_i =  a_1 E_{off,i} + a_2 E_{oth,i} + a_3 E_{ret,i}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Where: 
* &lt;math&gt; T_i  \,\!&lt;/math&gt; - Person trips attracted per worker in the  ith zone 
* &lt;math&gt;E_{off,i} \,\!&lt;/math&gt; - office employment in the  ith zone
* &lt;math&gt;E_{oth,i} \,\!&lt;/math&gt; - other employment in the ith zone  
* &lt;math&gt;E_{ret,i} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;- retail employment in the  ith zone
* &lt;math&gt;a_1,a_2,a_3 \,\!&lt;/math&gt; - model coefficients

== Normalization ==

For each trip purpose (e.g. home to work trips), the number of trips originating at home must equal the number of trips destined for work. Two distinct models may give two results. There are several techniques for dealing with this problem. One can either assume one model is correct and adjust the other, or split the difference. 

It is necessary to ensure that the total number of trip origins equals the total number of trip destinations, since each trip interchange by definition must have two trip ends. 

The rates developed for the home end are assumed to be most accurate, 

The basic equation for normalization:

&lt;math&gt; 
T'_j = T_j\frac{{\sum\limits_{i = 1}^I {T_i} }}{{\sum\limits_{j = 1}^J {T_j} }}
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

* &lt;math&gt;T_j ' &lt;/math&gt; - Normalized Person Trips destined for Zone j

      <comment>fixed link from my previous edit.  Should have previewed first.  Sorry about that.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">To protect your users from [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting Cross-site scripting (XSS)] and similar attacks, you should escape both URLs and user-submitted text. In ASP this is done with two functions &lt;tt&gt;Server.HTMLEncode&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;Server.URLEncode&lt;/tt&gt;.

== Server.HTMLEncode ==

Don't ever output non-escaped user data:
&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;
Response.write user_data 'not safe
&lt;/source&gt;

Instead do the following:
&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;
Response.write Server.HTMLEncode( user_data )
&lt;/source&gt;

This method should also be used for all data that comes from SQL. Better safe than sorry.

== Server.URLEncode ==

To encode URLs that you insert into the ''href'' attribute of A tags, use the &lt;tt&gt;Server.URLEncode&lt;/tt&gt; function, like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://foobar.com?&lt;%= Server.URLEncode( &quot;foo=bar&quot; + &quot;&amp;baz=quz&quot; ) %&gt;&quot;&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">This book is aimed at undergraduate civil engineering students, though the material may provide a useful review for practitioners and graduate students in transportation. Typically, this would be for an '''Introduction to Transportation''' course, which might be taken by most students in their sophomore or junior year. Often this is the first engineering course students take, which requires a switch in thinking from simply solving given problems to formulating the problem mathematically before solving it, i.e. from straight-forward calculation often found in undergraduate Calculus to vaguer word problems more reflective of the real world.

== How an idea becomes a road ==

The plot of this textbook can be thought of as &quot;How an idea becomes a road&quot;. The book begins with the generation of ideas. This is followed by the analysis of ideas, first determining the origin and destination of a transportation facility (usually a road), then the required width of the facility to accommodate demand, and finally the design of the road in terms of curvature. As such the book is divided into three main parts: planning, operations, and design, which correspond to the three main sets of practitioners within the transportation engineering community: transportation planners, traffic engineers, and highway engineers. Other topics, such as pavement design, and bridge design, are beyond the scope of this work. Similarly transit operations and railway engineering are also large topics beyond the scope of this book.

Each page is roughly the notes from one fifty-minute lecture.

== Authors ==

Authors of this book include [http://nexus.umn.edu David Levinson], [http://www.ce.umn.edu/~liu/ Henry Liu], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Garrison_(geographer) William Garrison], [http://www.u.arizona.edu/~mhickman/ Mark Hickman], Adam Danczyk, Michael Corbett. Karen Dixon  at Oregon State University contributed Flash animations developed by herself and her students linked to in this book.

      <text xml:space="preserve">ASP (or Active Server Pages) is a scripting tool for dynamic webpages. It is a technology that can be compared to Cold Fusion, JSP, and PHP. While primarily made for the Microsoft Windows platform, there are implementations of ASP technology on other environments.

ASP is the technology that powers the dynamic websites, not the language that the pages are scripted in. There are a number of languages that can be used to script or program a dynamic website. However, most people assume that ASP and vbscript (one of the languages used) are the same.

With the release of the .Net platform, Microsoft also updated ASP to ASP.Net. There are a number of improvements to ASP that ASP.Net provides, but that would be a book unto itself. This textbook focuses on what is now called &quot;classic&quot; ASP. One important difference is that ASP.Net pages are named *.aspx and ASP 3.0 pages are named *.asp, and ASP 3.0 pages are interpreted and ASP.Net pages are compiled thus ASP.net pages work faster. ASP.Net uses the Microsoft .Net framework and can use any language that .Net supports. ASP 3.0 is limited to VBScript and JScript (Microsoft's version of Javascript).

== Do I need to know HTML? ==

Yes and No... The output of ASP is usually HTML, so it is strongly recommended that you are familiar with at least [http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/ HTML 4.01]. While many programmers prefer visual editors like Macromedia's Dreamweaver and Ultradev, Microsoft's Frontpage and Visual InterDev, beginners will benefit more from using a plain text editor until comfortable with the basic concepts.

== Do I need to know a programming language? ==

You should be familiar with at least one object-oriented programming
language. This book will teach you how to program in ASP, but it will
not teach you how to ''program''. You should understand the following
concepts:

* variables
** global variables, and how they differ from local variables
* functions, and
** how to pass parameters to functions
* decision-making statements such as &lt;tt&gt;if-then&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;if-then-else&lt;/tt&gt;
* looping statements such as the &lt;tt&gt;for loop&lt;/tt&gt; and the &lt;tt&gt;while loop&lt;/tt&gt;

== Do I need to install web server software on my computer? ==
There are sites such as [http://www.1asphost.com 1asphost.com] that provide free web sites with ASP capabilities. You can upload your ASP files, and 
the server will do all the ASP processing for you.

Find similar services by doing a [http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=free+asp+hosting&amp;btnG=Search Google search for &quot;free asp hosting&quot;.]

You may also install software on your computer to process ASP files locally. [http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/evaluation/features/iis.mspx Internet Information Services] will come in handy for users of Microsoft Windows operating system. And there are [http://www.apache.org Apache webservers] available for most of today's operating systems.

In order to execute ASP 3.0 locally,  you will need Windows 2000 Professional or higher. All versions of Windows from 2000 include Internet Information Services with the exception of Windows XP Home. Installation is simple, just go to Add/Remove programs and then the Add/Remove Windows components section. Just keep in mind that just because you have IIS installed that does not mean that ASP files will execute.

      <comment>/* Gravity Model */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">''Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things.'' - Waldo Tobler's 'First Law of Geography’

'''Destination Choice''' (or '''trip distribution''' or '''zonal interchange analysis'''), is the second component (after [[Fundamentals of Transportation/Trip Generation|Trip Generation]], but before [[Fundamentals of Transportation/Mode Choice|Mode Choice]] and [[Fundamentals of Transportation/Route Choice|Route Choice]]) in the traditional four-step transportation forecasting model.  This step matches tripmakers’ origins and destinations to develop a “trip table”, a matrix that displays the number of trips going from each origin to each destination.  Historically, trip distribution has been the least developed component of the transportation planning model.

Where: &lt;math&gt;T_{ij}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; = Trips from origin ''i'' to destination ''j''.
	  
Work trip distribution is the way that travel demand models understand how people take jobs.  There are trip distribution models for other (non-work) activities, which follow the same structure.
== Fratar Models ==

The simplest trip distribution models (Fratar or Growth models) simply extrapolate a base year trip table to the future based on growth, &lt;math&gt;T_{ijy+1} = g*T_{ijy}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where:
* &lt;math&gt;T_{ijy}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; - Trips from &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; in year &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;g\,\!&lt;/math&gt; - growth factor

Fratar Model takes no account of changing spatial accessibility due to increased supply or changes in travel patterns and congestion.

== Gravity Model ==

The gravity model illustrates the macroscopic relationships between places (say homes and workplaces).  It has long been posited that the interaction between two locations declines with increasing (distance, time, and cost) between them, but is positively associated with the amount of activity at each location (Isard, 1956).  In analogy with physics, Reilly (1929) formulated Reilly's law of retail gravitation, and J. Q. Stewart (1948) formulated definitions of demographic gravitation, force, energy, and potential, now called accessibility (Hansen, 1959).  The distance decay factor of &lt;math&gt;distance^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; has been updated to a more comprehensive function of generalized cost, which is not necessarily linear - a negative exponential tends to be the preferred form. In analogy with Newton’s law of gravity, a gravity model is often used in transportation planning. 

The gravity model has been corroborated many times as a basic underlying aggregate relationship (Scott 1988, Cervero 1989, Levinson and Kumar 1995). The rate of decline of the interaction (called alternatively, the impedance or friction factor, or the utility or propensity function) has to be empirically measured, and varies by context. 

Limiting the usefulness of the gravity model is its aggregate nature.  Though policy also operates at an aggregate level, more accurate analyses will retain the most detailed level of information as long as possible. While the gravity model is very successful in explaining the choice of a large number of individuals, the choice of any given individual varies greatly from the predicted value. As applied in an urban travel demand context, the disutilities are primarily time, distance, and cost, although discrete choice models with the application of more expansive utility expressions are sometimes used, as is stratification by income or auto ownership. 

Mathematically, the gravity model often takes the form:

&lt;math&gt;
T_{ij}  = K_i K_j T_i T_j f(C_{ij} )
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\sum_j {T_{ij}  = T_i } ,\sum_i {T_{ij}  = T_j } 
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
K_i  = ({\sum_j {K_j T_j f(C_{ij} )} }) ^{-1}
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
K_j  = ({\sum_i {K_i T_i f(C_{ij} )} }) ^{-1}
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where 
* &lt;math&gt;T_{ij}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; = Trips between origin &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and destination &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;T_i\,\!&lt;/math&gt; = Trips originating at &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;T_j\,\!&lt;/math&gt; = Trips destined for &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;C_{ij}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; = travel cost between &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;K_i, K_j\,\!&lt;/math&gt; = balancing factors solved iteratively.
* &lt;math&gt;f\,\!&lt;/math&gt; = impedance or distance decay factor

It is doubly constrained so that Trips from &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; equal number of origins and destinations.

== Balancing a matrix ==

1. Assess Data, you have &lt;math&gt;T_i\,\!&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt; T_j\,\! &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; C_{ij} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

2. Compute &lt;math&gt;f(Cij)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, e.g.

*  &lt;math&gt;f(C_{ij}) = C_{ij}^{-2}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
*  &lt;math&gt;f(C_{ij}) = e^{-\beta C_{ij}}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

3. Iterate to Balance Matrix

(a) Multiply Trips from Zone &lt;math&gt;i\,\!&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;T_i\,\!&lt;/math&gt;) by Trips to Zone &lt;math&gt;j\,\!&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;T_j\,\!&lt;/math&gt;) by Impedance in Cell &lt;math&gt;ij\,\!&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;f(C_{ij})\,\! &lt;/math&gt;) for all &lt;math&gt;ij\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

(b) Sum Row Totals &lt;math&gt;T'_i\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, Sum Column Totals &lt;math&gt;T'_j\,\!&lt;/math&gt; 

(c) Multiply Rows by &lt;math&gt;N_i=T_i/T'_i\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

(d) Sum Row Totals &lt;math&gt;T'_i\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, Sum Column Totals &lt;math&gt;T'_j\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

(e) Compare &lt;math&gt;T_i\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T'_i\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;T_j\,\!&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt;T'_j\,\!&lt;/math&gt; if within tolerance stop, Otherwise goto (f)

(f) Multiply Columns by &lt;math&gt;N_j=T_j/T'_j\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

(g) Sum Row Totals &lt;math&gt;T'_i\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, Sum Column Totals &lt;math&gt;T'_j\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

(h)  Compare &lt;math&gt;T_i\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T'_i\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;T_j\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T'_j\,\!&lt;/math&gt;  if within tolerance stop, Otherwise goto (b)

== Issues ==

=== Feedback ===
One of the key drawbacks to the application of many early models was the inability to take account of congested travel time on the road network in determining the probability of making a trip between two locations. Although Wohl noted as early as 1963 research into the feedback mechanism or the “interdependencies among assigned or distributed volume, travel time (or travel ‘resistance’) and route or system capacity”, this work has yet to be widely adopted with rigorous tests of convergence or with a so-called “equilibrium” or “combined” solution (Boyce et al. 1994). Haney (1972) suggests internal assumptions about travel time used to develop demand should be consistent with the output travel times of the route assignment of that demand. While small methodological inconsistencies are necessarily a problem for estimating base year conditions, forecasting becomes even more tenuous without an understanding of the feedback between supply and demand. Initially heuristic methods were developed by Irwin and Von Cube (as quoted in Florian et al. (1975) ) and others, and later formal mathematical programming techniques were established by Evans (1976).

=== Feedback and time budgets ===

A key point in analyzing feedback is the finding in earlier research by Levinson and Kumar (1994) that commuting times have remained stable over the past thirty years in the Washington Metropolitan Region, despite significant changes in household income, land use pattern, family structure, and labor force participation. Similar results have been found in the Twin Cities by Barnes and Davis (2000). 

The stability of travel times and distribution curves over the past three decades gives a good basis for the application of aggregate trip distribution models for relatively long term forecasting.   This is not to suggest that there exists a constant travel time budget.

In terms of time budgets:
* 1440 Minutes in a Day
* Time Spent Traveling: ~ 100 minutes + or -
* Time Spent Traveling Home to Work: 20 - 30 minutes + or -

Research has found that auto commuting times have remained largely stable over the past forty years, despite significant changes in transportation networks, congestion, household income, land use pattern, family structure, and labor force participation. The stability of travel times and distribution curves gives a good basis for the application of trip distribution models for relatively long term forecasting.

So while the matrix is not strictly balanced, it is very close, well within a 1% threshold, after 16 iterations. The threshold refers to the proximity of the normalizing factor to 1.0.

      <comment>/* Normal forces impact on friction */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This paragraph has a couple of problems:

&quot;Now consider an 8.53 m (28 foot) track that consists of a 30“ ramp followed by a flat portion to the finish. The ramp section is 2.43 m (8 feet) long and the flat section is 6.1 m (20 feet) long. The travels the 2.43 m ramp at an average velocity of v / 2 = ...&quot;

1) A 30&quot; ramp? Ealier the article claims the ramp is four feet high. Which is it?

2) &quot;The travels ...&quot;. What travels? The car, perhaps?

I would leave my id but some moronic entity deleted it, so you will have to make do with my IP.

:Thank you 71.117.209.73 - 1) thirty '''degree''' ramp - [[w: hypotenuse|hypotenuse]] is double the base, which makes life easier (8 feet of track for a four foot rise) and 2) ''car'' of course. --[[User:Kkmurray|Kkmurray]] ([[User talk:Kkmurray|talk]]) 03:03, 6 March 2008 (UTC)

== Angular velocity? ==

Isn't it v = r omega, not omega = r v?

== Tread pattern affects rolling resistance, but raising a wheel doesn't? ==

A &quot;V&quot; or &quot;H&quot; tread pattern reduces CRF because it &quot;limits the contact area,&quot; but raising a wheel doesn't because the same weight is redistributed elsewhere?  I don't know enough about rolling resistance to know which is correct, but if rolling resistance is independent of the contact area, then the &quot;V&quot; or &quot;H&quot; tread shouldn't affect it; conversely, if Crr does depend on the contact area, then raising a wheel will certainly reduce it.

== Normal forces impact on friction ==

The normal force on the axle is not affected by the slope because the wheel always rides on the same contact area of the axle so there is no cos(theta) term in the equation.

Further, putting the weight off center (in the back) cause the normal force on the rear axles to be greater than that on the front axles, increasing the frictional force.  So there is a trade-off between increased potential energy and frictional forces during the inclined ramp and the linear track.  So the equation for the normal force N per axle is not just N/4.  It must reflect the location of the center of mass.</text>

== Overview ==

An '''''Augurey''''', or Irish Phoenix, is a small greenish-black bird that resembles a vulture and can emit a distinctive low cry. Being shy creatures, they stay primarily within their tear-shaped nests and fly only in periods of heavy rain.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

Though native to Britain and Ireland, the Augurey has also been spotted throughout northern Europe. They makes their nests in bramble and thorn and their diet consists mostly of large insects and fairies.

In the past, wizards associated the cry of the Augurey with death, and a few early wizards are believed to have succumbed to a heart attack upon being surprised by the wail of an unseen augurey.  Later it was determined that, instead of foretelling death, the augurey's cry signalled an impending rain shower.

The Augurey has been used as a home weather forecaster, though its persistent moaning during the winter months can be unbearable for some.  As Augurey feathers repel ink, they are ineffective for quills.

By: Jessi Buffkin



=='''INTRODUCTION'''==
Equity in schools is a necessity and this should be a main focus. Classrooms need to have a secure environment. This is the role of the teachers and schools to make sure the students have environment that is easily able to learn in. Teachers need to be well prepared when entering the classroom when it comes to different race, ethnicity, sexual preference and disability. There are different actions that the school and teacher can take to accomplish creating equity. This is a matter of social justice. 

=='''What is racisms effect on creating equity in the classroom?'''==

Racism spreads through schools all the time. Today in school there are many teachers who teach foreign languages and other classes where students can learn culture. The teachers teach the students about culture by cooking the foods of that ethnicity and having festivals. Racism is still occurring, and these foreign language classes are not helping this factor. Many respectable results can come from a student learning in a multicultural school. One is being able to adjust to different environments when not in school. While the students are in school they get to meet all different kinds of people so that when they go out in the real world the students will have open mind to the world. This results in not being stereotypical. It also prepares the child to deal with situations that might occur due to racism. The student also gets to learn about many different cultures. These are all many rewards that come out of having a child in a multicultural environment. All these things can lead to equity in schools, because maybe then there would not be such a large extent of racism in schools (Shehata).
There are different minorities in schools; of them African Americans are the majorities. According to Wright, “The dilemmatic issue regarding the lack of achievement by African-American children may conceivably be changed if equal and quality educational opportunities are provided through instruction in the classroom.” Some teachers refuse to change the way they teach, regardless if there teaching technique is effective or not for all a students. Anderson says, “Those who dare to teach must never cease to learn.” To create equity in the classroom the teacher has to learn the techniques of all the students. (Young)
	

=='''Should teachers have an open minds about sexual preference?'''==

Students with different sexual preferences are very common in schools today. It is the teacher’s responsibility to make the child feel secure in the school environment. Teachers can do this by not allowing name calling whether the teacher agrees or disagrees. The teacher can also allow no assault or violence to these students (Stereotypes, Silence, and Speaking Out).This all has to do with “preventing youth crime.” Hate crime is defined as an attack on an individual or his or her property. Since this is a learned behavior teachers can try there best to prevent this. There are some steps that a school can take to try to prevent this kind of behavior. One is to give the teachers and the people who work at the school some type of preparation for how to handle certain situations. The teachers need to learn how to report a problem if one occurs like this. The school needs to make sure the students receive the same type of advising. This teaches students why being hateful towards certain types of people is wrong (Preventing Youth Hate Crime).


=='''Is stereotyping a good idea for teachers in schools?'''==

Stereotyping is not a good thing when you are a teacher. You need to come into a classroom with an open mind and someone might surprise you. For example Asian Americans, are typically stereotyped as submissive and hardworking.  When stereotyping, usually you separate those children into another category which is not creating equity among the students (Preventing Youth Hate Crime).
There was a study on, “effects of gender of teacher, gender of student, and classroom subject on teacher-student interactions.” There were 597 students being used for this experiment, almost equally distributed between girls and boys. There were 28 teachers involved in this experiment. The result in this experiment were most of the teachers interacted with the males more. Today in society males and females are treated differently. When it comes to the classroom it has been shown that male teachers have higher expectations for boys in math, and girls in English. According to this journal, (classroom interactions: gender of teacher, gender of student) “One way to study classroom interactions is through the use of the interactions for sex equity in classroom teaching (INTERSECT) observational instrument developed by Sadker et al (1984).” The final outcome demonstrated that male students were applauded, corrected, managed, and disapproved interactions. The boys got more teacher responses than the girl students. This was in junior high and in high school. This research shows that teachers seem to pay more attention to the males than the females which does not create equity in the classroom. These are some things that you try to avoid when in the classroom. (Duffy)
There was a club that was brought together in Ontario schools. This club was brought together to discuss history of racism, and racism now in society. It states that in the curriculum for Ontario there are no courses that teach about equity. Only teachers who want to learn about this will. George Dei, chair of-sociology and equity studies in education at the Ontario Institute For Studies in Education, says there are a number of teachers who should be recognized for their anti-racism work. &quot;But there are also many who have closed their minds,&quot; he adds. &quot;We cannot wish racism away. We must acknowledge and respond to it.&quot; Which they did, stating that some of the practice in there schools are racist. Now there has to be fact about discrimination in text books today. Ontario is institute for studies in education (Black) .

=='''How should teachers create equity in classrooms?'''==
	
There are many things that you can do to create equity in the classroom. Women can feel discouraged at times because they can feel as though they are being undermined. When a teacher will focus on a certain type of group of people this is not creating equity. Maybe the teacher would focus on the men because he or she thinks the men can succeed more. Focusing on any type of minority or race excludes the other classmates to respond. 
There are many things that someone can do to create equity. The first thing to do is  state your expectations and stating that it is possible for anyone to do well in your class, even if they need some additional help. Make sure you give a proper wait-time when you are asking a question. Students need a proper amount of time to answer the question and this gives all students an equal opportunity to answer the question (Sandler). Also learn you’re Students' Names, and try to create a Safe Environment and lastly Be Aware of your Audience. Equity is defined as, “the state, quality, or ideal of being just, impartial, and fair.” (Houghton)

=='''Conclusion'''==
        All this can lead to creating equity in the classroom. The teacher mostly has to make sure this occurs. The teacher has to have an open mind when entering the classroom, trying to avoid all types of stereotyping toward racism sexual preference and any minority group.

What does a school do when allowing discrimination, racism, and stereotyping into the school?
The school is not doing its job. The schools job is to create a safe environment for all the students. It is not the schools job to allow this kind behavior to continue. The school needs to take proper actions when these situations occur. When this is not allowed the school is then creating equity in the classroom.

      <comment>/* The Logit Model */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Mode choice analysis''' is the third step in the conventional four-step transportation forecasting model, following [[Fundamentals of Transportation/Trip Generation|Trip Generation]] and [[Fundamentals of Transportation/Destination Choice|Destination Choice]] but before [[Fundamentals of Transportation/Route Choice|Route Choice]]. While trip distribution's zonal interchange analysis yields a set of origin destination tables which tells where the trips will be made, mode choice analysis allows the modeler to determine what mode of transport will be used.

The early transportation planning model developed by the Chicago Area Transportation Study (CATS) focused on transit, it wanted to know how much travel would continue by transit.  The CATS divided transit trips into two classes:  trips to the CBD (mainly by subway/elevated transit, express buses, and commuter trains) and other (mainly on the local bus system).  For the latter, increases in auto ownership and use were trade off against bus use; trend data were used.  CBD travel was analyzed using historic mode choice data together with projections of CBD land uses.  Somewhat similar techniques were used in many studies.  Two decades after CATS, for example, the London study followed essentially the same procedure, but first dividing trips into those made in inner part of the city and those in the outer part. This procedure was followed because it was thought that income (resulting in the purchase and use of automobiles) drove mode choice.

== Diversion Curve techniques ==

The CATS had diversion curve techniques available and used them for some tasks.  At first, the CATS studied the diversion of auto traffic from streets and arterial to proposed expressways.  Diversion curves were also used as bypasses were built around cities to establish what percentage of the traffic would use the bypass.  The mode choice version of diversion curve analysis proceeds this way:  one forms a ratio, say:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{{c_{transit} }}
{{c_{auto} }} = R
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
  
where: 
:''c&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' = travel time by mode ''m'' and 
:''R'' is empirical data in the form:
[[Image:DiversionCurveMC.png|right|500px|Figure: Mode choice diversion curve]]

Given the ''R'' that we have calculated, the graph tells us the percent of users in the market that will choose transit. A variation on the technique is to use costs rather than time in the diversion ratio.  The decision to use a time or cost ratio turns on the problem at hand.  Transit agencies developed diversion curves for different kinds of situations, so variables like income and population density entered implicitly.

Diversion curves are based on empirical observations, and their improvement has resulted from better (more and more pointed) data.  Curves are available for many markets.  It is not difficult to obtain data and array results.  Expansion of transit has motivated data development by operators and planners. Yacov Zahavi's UMOT studies contain many examples of diversion curves.

In a sense, diversion curve analysis is expert system analysis.  Planners could &quot;eyeball&quot; neighborhoods and estimate transit ridership by routes and time of day.  Instead, diversion is observed empirically and charts can be drawn.

== Disaggregate Travel Demand models  ==

Travel demand theory was introduced in the appendix on traffic generation.  The core of the field is the set of models developed following work by Stan Warner in 1962 (Strategic Choice of Mode in Urban Travel:  A Study of Binary Choice).  Using data from the CATS, Warner investigated classification techniques using models from biology and psychology.   Building from Warner and other early investigators, disaggregate demand models emerged.  Analysis is disaggregate in that individuals are the basic units of observation, yet aggregate because models yield a single set of parameters describing the choice behavior of the population.  Behavior enters because the theory made use of consumer behavior concepts from economics and parts of choice behavior concepts from psychology.  Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley (especially Daniel McFadden, who won a Nobel Prize in Economics for his efforts) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (Moshe Ben-Akiva) (and in MIT associated consulting firms, especially Cambridge Systematics) developed what has become known as choice models, direct demand models (DDM), Random Utility Models (RUM) or, in its most used form, the multinomial logit model (MNL).

Choice models have attracted a lot of attention and work;  the Proceedings of the International Association for Travel Behavior Research chronicles the evolution of the models.  The models are treated in modern transportation planning and transportation engineering textbooks.

One reason for rapid model development was a felt need.  Systems were being proposed (especially transit systems) where no empirical experience of the type used in diversion curves was available. Choice models permit comparison of more than two alternatives and the importance of attributes of alternatives.  There was the general desire for an analysis technique that depended less on aggregate analysis and with a greater behavioral content. And, there was attraction too, because choice models have logical and behavioral roots extended back to the 1920s as well as roots in Kelvin Lancaster’s consumer behavior theory, in utility theory, and in modern statistical methods.

==The Logit Model==

The current Logit Model used for traffic modeling todays was first theorized by Daniel McFadden. The Logit model says, the probability that a certain mode choice will be taken is proportional to e raised to the utility over the sum of e raised to the utility.

&lt;math&gt; P_m {\rm{  }} = {\rm{ }}\frac{{e^{u_{ijm}}}}{{\sum{e^{u_{ijm}}}}}{\rm{ }} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;


For any Logit Model the sum of all the probability of the modes will equal 1. 

&lt;math&gt; 1{\rm{  }} = {\rm{ }}\sum{P_{m}}{\rm{ }} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;


The Logit Model also says that if a new mode of transportation is added to a system (or taken away) then the original modes will lose an amount of travels proportional to their share originally. 

Steps for the Logit Model:
*Compute the Utility for each OD pair and mode
*Compute Exponentiated utilities for each OD pair and mode
*Sum Exponentiated utilities for each OD pair
*Compute Probability for each mode by OD pair
*Multiply Probability for OD pair by number of trips for each OD pair

== Psychological roots ==
[[Image:ThurstonMC.png|right|500px|Distribution of perceived weights]]

Early psychology work involved the typical experiment:  Here are two objects with weights, &lt;math&gt;w_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w_2&lt;/math&gt;, which is heavier?  The finding from such an experiment would be that the greater the difference in weight, the greater the probability of choosing correctly.  Graphs similar to the one on the right result.
 
Louis Leon Thurstone proposed (in the 1920s) that perceived weight, 

&lt;math&gt;
w = v + e 
&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the true weight and &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is random with  
&lt;math&gt;E(e) = 0.  
&lt;/math&gt;

The assumption that &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is normally and identically distributed (NID) yields the binary probit model.

== Econometric formulation ==
Economists deal with utility rather than physical weights, and say that 

:observed utility = mean utility + random term.  

Utility in this context refers to the total satisfaction (or happiness) received from making a particular choice or consuming a good or service. 

The characteristics of the object, x, must be considered, so we have 

:''u''(''x'') = ''v''(''x'') + ''e''(''x'').  

If we follow Thurston's assumption, we again have a probit model.  

An alternative is to assume that the error terms are independently and identically distributed with a Weibull, Gumbel Type I, or double exponential distribution (They are much the same, and differ slightly in their tails (thicker) from the normal distribution).  This yields the multinomial logit model (MNL).  Daniel McFadden argued that the Weibull had desirable properties compared to other distributions that might be used.  Among other things, the error terms are normally and identically distributed. The logit model is simply a log ratio of the probability of choosing a mode to the probability of not choosing a mode. 

:&lt;math&gt;
\log \left( {\frac{{P_i }}
{{1 - P_i }}} \right) = v(x_i )
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Observe the mathematical similarity between the logit model and the S-curves we estimated earlier, although here share increases with utility rather than time. With a choice model we are explaining the share of travelers using a mode (or the probability that an individual traveler uses a mode multiplied by the number of travelers).

The comparison with S-curves is suggestive that modes (or technologies) get adopted as their utility increases, which happens over time for several reasons.  First, because the utility itself is a function of network effects, the more users, the more valuable the service, higher the utility associated with joining the network. Second, because utility increases as user costs drop, which happens when fixed costs can be spread over more users (another network effect).  Third, technological advances, which occur over time and as the number of users increases, drive down relative cost.

An illustration of a utility expression is given:

:&lt;math&gt;
\log \left( {\frac{{P_A }}
{{1 - P_A }}} \right) = \beta _0  + \beta _1 \left( {c_A  - c_T } \right) + \beta _2 \left( {t_A  - t_T } \right) + \beta _3 I + \beta _4 N = v_A 
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where
:''P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' = Probability of choosing mode i.
:''P&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;'' = Probability of taking auto
:''c&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;,c&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;'' = cost of auto, transit
:''t&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;,t&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;'' = travel time of auto, transit
:''I'' = income
:''N'' = Number of travelers

With algebra, the model can be translated to its most widely used form:
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{{P_A }} {{1 - P_A }} = e^{v_A }
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
P_A  = e^{v_A }  - P_A e^{v_A }  
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
P_A \left( {1 + e^{v_A } } \right) = e^{v_A }  
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
P_A  = \frac{{e^{v_A } }} {{1 + e^{v_A } }} 
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

It is fair to make two conflicting statements about the estimation and use of this model:  

#It's a &quot;house of cards&quot;, and 
#Used by a technically competent and thoughtful analyst, it's useful.

The &quot;house of cards&quot; problem largely arises from the utility theory basis of the model specification.  Broadly, utility theory assumes that (1) users and suppliers have perfect information about the market; (2) they have deterministic functions (faced with the same options, they will always make the same choices); and (3) switching between alternatives is costless.  These assumptions don’t fit very well with what is known about behavior.  Furthermore, the aggregation of utility across the population is impossible since there is no universal utility scale.

Suppose an option has a net utility ''u&lt;sub&gt;jk&lt;/sub&gt;'' (option ''k'', person ''j'').  We can imagine that having a systematic part ''v&lt;sub&gt;jk&lt;/sub&gt;'' that is a function of the characteristics of an object and person ''j'', plus a random part ''e&lt;sub&gt;jk&lt;/sub&gt;'', which represents tastes, observational errors, and a bunch of other things (it gets murky here).  (An object such as a vehicle does not have utility, it is characteristics of a vehicle that have utility.)  The introduction of ''e'' lets us do some aggregation.  As noted above, we think of observable utility as being a function:

:&lt;math&gt;
v_A  = \beta _0  + \beta _1 \left( {c_A  - c_T } \right) + \beta _2 \left( {t_A  - t_T } \right) + \beta _3 I + \beta _4 N
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where each variable represents a characteristic of the auto trip.  The value ''β&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' is termed an alternative specific constant.  Most modelers say it represents characteristics left out of the equation (e.g., the political correctness of a mode, if I take transit I feel morally righteous, so ''β&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' may be negative for the automobile), but it includes whatever is needed to make error terms NID.

== Econometric estimation ==
[[Image:LikelihoodMC.png|right|500px|Figure: Likelihood Function for the Sample {1,1,1,0,1}.]]

Turning now to some technical matters, how do we estimate ''v(x)''? Utility (''v(x)'') isn’t observable.  All we can observe are choices (say, measured as 0 or 1), and we want to talk about probabilities of choices that range from 0 to 1.  (If we do a regression on 0s and 1s we might measure for ''j'' a probability of 1.4 or -0.2 of taking an auto.)  Further, the distribution of the error terms wouldn’t have appropriate statistical characteristics. 

The MNL approach is to make a maximum likelihood estimate of this functional form. The likelihood function is:

:&lt;math&gt;
L^*  = \prod_{n = 1}^N {f\left( {y_n \left| {x_n ,\theta } \right.} \right)} 
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

we solve for the estimated parameters 
:&lt;math&gt;
\hat \theta 
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

that max L*. This happens when:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{{\partial L}}
{{\partial \hat \theta _N }} = 0
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The log-likelihood is easier to work with, as the products turn to sums:

:&lt;math&gt;
\ln L^*  = \sum_{n = 1}^N {\ln f\left( {y_n \left| {x_n ,\theta } \right.} \right)} 
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Consider an example adopted from John Bitzan’s Transportation Economics Notes. Let ''X'' be a binary variable that is ''gamma'' and 0 with probability (1- ''gamma''). Then f(0) = (1- ''gamma'') and f(1) = ''gamma''.  Suppose that we have 5 observations of X, giving the sample {1,1,1,0,1}. To find the maximum likelihood estimator of ''gamma'' examine various values of ''gamma'', and for these values determine the probability of drawing the sample {1,1,1,0,1}
If ''gamma'' takes the value 0, the probability of drawing our sample is 0. If ''gamma'' is 0.1, then the probability of getting our sample is: f(1,1,1,0,1) = f(1)f(1)f(1)f(0)f(1) = 0.1*0.1*0.1*0.9*0.1=0.00009.  We can compute the probability of obtaining our sample over a range of ''gamma'' – this is our likelihood function. The likelihood function for n independent observations in a logit model is

:&lt;math&gt;
L^*  = \prod_{n = 1}^N {P_i ^{Y_i } } \left( {1 - P_i } \right)^{1 - Y_i } 
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where: ''Y&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 1 or 0 (choosing e.g. auto or not-auto) and Pi = the probability of observing Yi=1

The log likelihood is thus:

:&lt;math&gt;
\ell  = \ln L^*  = \sum_{i = 1}^n {\left[ {Y_i \ln P_i  + \left( {1 - Y_i } \right)\ln \left( {1 - P_i } \right)} \right]} 
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

In the binomial (two alternative) logit model, 

:&lt;math&gt;
P_{auto}  = \frac{{e^{v(x_{auto} )} }}
{{1 + e^{v(x_{auto} )} }}
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, so
:&lt;math&gt;
\ell  = \ln L^*  = \sum_{i = 1}^n {\left[ {Y_i v(x_{auto} ) - \ln \left( {1 + e^{v(x_{auto} )} } \right)} \right]} 
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The log-likelihood function is maximized setting the partial derivatives to zero:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{{\partial \ell }}
{{\partial \beta }} = \sum_{i = 1}^n {\left( {Y_i  - \hat P_i } \right) = } 0
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The above gives the essence of modern MNL choice modeling.

== Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA) ==

Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives is a property of Logit, but not all Discrete Choice models. In brief, the implication of IIA is that if you add a mode, it will draw from present modes in proportion to their existing shares. (And similarly, if you remove a mode, its users will switch to other modes in proportion to their previous share). To see why this property may cause problems, consider the following example: Imagine we have seven modes in our logit mode choice model (drive alone, carpool 2 passenger, carpool 3+ passenger, walk to transit, auto driver to transit (park and ride), auto passenger to transit (kiss and ride), and walk or bike). If we eliminated Kiss and Ride, a disproportionate number may use Park and Ride or carpool. 

Consider another example. Imagine there is a mode choice between driving and taking a red bus, and currently each has 50% share. If we introduce another mode, let's call it a blue bus with identical attributes to the red bus, the logit mode choice model would give each mode 33.3% of the market, or in other words, buses will collectively have 66.7% market share. Logically, if the mode is truly identical, it would not attract any additional passengers (though one can imagine scenarios where adding capacity would increase bus mode share, particularly if the bus was capacity constrained.

There are several strategies that help with the IIA problem. Nesting of choices allows us to reduce this problem. However, there is an issue of the proper Nesting structure. Other alternatives include more complex models (e.g. Mixed Logit) which are more difficult to estimate.

== Consumers' Surplus ==

Topics not touched on include the “red bus, blue bus” problem; the use of nested models (e.g., estimate choice between auto and transit, and then estimate choice between rail and bus transit); how consumers’ surplus measurements may be obtained; and model estimation, goodness of fit, etc.  For these topics see a textbook such as Ortuzar and Willumsen (2001).

== Returning to roots ==

The discussion above is based on the economist’s utility formulation.  At the time MNL modeling was developed there was some attention to psychologist's choice work (e.g., Luce’s choice axioms discussed in his Individual Choice Behavior, 1959).  It has an analytic side in computational process modeling.  Emphasis is on how people think when they make choices or solve problems (see Newell and Simon 1972).  Put another way, in contrast to utility theory, it stresses not the choice but the way the choice was made.  It provides a conceptual framework for travel choices and agendas of activities involving considerations of long and short term memory, effectors, and other aspects of thought and decision processes.  It takes the form of rules dealing with the way information is searched and acted on.  Although there is a lot of attention to behavioral analysis in transportation work, the best of modern psychological ideas are only beginning to enter the field. (e.g. Golledge, Kwan and Garling 1984; Garling, Kwan, and Golledge 1994).

Interpretation

Value of Time:

&lt;math&gt;.0411/2.24 = \$0.0183/min = $1.10/hour &lt;/math&gt;

(in 1967 $, when the wage rate was about $2.85/hour)

implication, if you can improve the travel time (by more buses, less bottlenecks, e.g.) for less than $1.10/hour/person, then it is socially worthwhile.


&lt;/div&gt;

===Example 2: Mode Choice Model Interpretation===

What mode would a perfectly rational, perfectly informed traveler choose in a deterministic world given these facts:

Car always wins (independent of parameters as long as all are &lt; 0)
&lt;/div&gt;

Under observed parameters, bus always wins, but not necessarily under all parameters.

It is important to note that individuals differ in parameters.  We could introduce socio-economic and other observable characteristics as well as a stochastic error term to make the problem more realistic.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction to Lighting Control==

Lighting control refers of any changes made in the light produced by one or more lighting instruments. This includes (but is by no means limited to) changes in intensity, color, direction, diffusion, polarization, and pattern. Though various methods of controlling these variables have evolved over time, it is common to manipulate them all from a central ''control board''. The control board typically communicates with a system of ''dimmers'', which control how much electricity flows to each light, as well as with any individual lights that can mechanically move/change color/rotate/etc. Such lights are usually referred to as ''intelligent lights''.

I.	Introduction'''

	Much debate has gone into what exactly makes up an effective school.  Some believe that instruction is the most important element in an effective school and others feel that the administrators that keep the schools in order are what make up an effective school.  This section will uncover the question: What makes up an effective school?”
'''II.	Philosophy'''
	The first task that a school must face is its philosophy.  This tells the students what the school expects from them.  Many schools tell their students to be respectful and kind.  This helps to build a harmonious en vironment in the school.
'''III.	The Role of the Teacher'''
	Posed with this question, the first answer that many people will probably give is the teacher.  The teacher is a vital part of the school; after all, the teacher controls the classroom and decides the pace and the direction of the class.  The teacher has the power to spark inspiration and make the students ask question about this complicated world that they live in.  
	Research done by Maryann Manning and Janice Patterson performed research on eight teachers taking notes on what types of instruction would be helpful for the school.  Their research indicated a few areas: 1.) Remove barriers to help communication with parents, 2.) Provide the right books for the child that are up to date, and 3.) Give the students more access to topics that are relevant to the curriculum that the students are more interested in. 
'''IV.	The Role of the Administration'''
	The administration has another big role in determining the effectiveness of the schools.  The administration’s job is to make sure that the school is in order.  The principal has to discipline the troublemakers in the school.  Administration deals with the student’s parents when a conflict is present.  They deal with the political side of the school.  
	Both administration and teachers help to create a safe learning environment that allows the students to concentrate on the work and make good grades.  That is why schools in a nicer part of town seem to do better on standardized tests than students who live in a not so desirable part of town.  This evidence can be seen in the motion picture “Lean on Me” with Morgan Freeman.  Freeman plays the role of a high school principal who takes a job at a school with some of the worst test scores in the state of New Jersey.  Freeman along with the other faculty members helps to change the culture in the school and helps the students to achieve higher test scores and increase their self- esteem.  They turned an ineffective school into an effective school. 
'''V.	The Role of Parents'''
	Parents are also a factor in helping schools become effective.  The PTA (Parent Teacher Association) has encouraged the involvement of parents in the schools.  The parents are given information on the school’s programs and are encouraged to help with fund raisers.  The money brought in from the fundraisers help pay for school functions such as the prom.  Besides the PTA, parents can also encourage the kids to do well.  Students may have a question about their homework and the parent can help teach the student.  Based on the research entitled: Parent Involvement and Educational Outcomes for Latino Students (Marschall, 2006), the student’s parents that were most involved performed better in school compared to the students whose parents were not able to participate as much.
'''VI.	Cultural-Immersion'''
	Effective schools also need to show the world to their students.  Being able to share ideas from a wide variety of cultures from around the world may help to “break down” cultural differences in this country.  “Evidence suggests that community cultural-immersion activities incorporated in teacher- preparation programs can not only help preservice teachers correct misperceptions about, but build relationships with their learners that can potentially impact student achievement.’ (Cooper, 2007).  
'''VII.	Six Dimensions of Transformational Leadership'''
Research done by John Ross for the Journal of Education Research (Effects of Running Records Assessment on Early Literacy Achievement) provides these six dimensions of transformational leadership relevant to schools:

1.	Symbolize good professional practice.
2.	Provide individualized support.
3.	Provide intellectual stimulation.
4.	Hold high performance expectations
5.	Foster a vision.
6.	Collaborate on decision making.
'''VIII.	Literacy'''
Literacy is the most important part of an individual’s education, because it allows the student to research and get a great deal of information.  A research study was done at the Center for the Improvement of Early Reading Achievement took a look at how the teacher, school, community, and home effect the child’s reading abilities.  The research showed that the collaboration with all of these factors were very helpful to the student.  This allows the student to get more practice outside of school.
'''IX.	Conclusion'''
This section shows what goes into effective schools and hopefully one day these materials and needs will be available to all of America’s students.   If all of the parts of the school can work together, then the school can be an effective one.

Essay Question:

'''XI.	Reflection on Effective Schools'''
In my reflection on the topic of effective schools, I have realized that a lot of aspects go into making an effective school.  I did not realize that so much research goes into this area of education.  I found the research on the six dimensions of transformational leadership relevant to schools to be very straight forward and very achievable for schools to adopt and put into motion. 
This paper has also taught me that students have the potential to be very successful contributors to society, no matter where they come from.  Schools have a power to spark inspiration into the lives of kids and help them see that the world has a lot to offer them and get the kids excited about the role that they will have once they finish school.  
Teachers are always looking for better ways of instructing their students.  This is great because teachers are always looking for a new way of engaging their students’ interest.
 Administration, teachers, and staff all need to work together to keep the environment of the school a safe one.  This allows the students the chance to focus on the instruction and not worry about troublesome students interfering with the learning process. 
The role of the parent in the school is very important to the success of the student.  The research showed that the more the parent was willing to be involved with the school, the better the student did in school.  This was a very rewarding experience for me.

      <comment>/* Transit assignment */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Route assignment''', '''route choice''', or '''traffic assignment''' concerns the selection of routes (alternative called paths) between origins and destinations in transportation networks.  It is the fourth step in the conventional transportation forecasting model, following [[Fundamentals of Transportation/Trip Generation|Trip Generation]], [[Fundamentals of Transportation/Destination Choice|Destination Choice]], and [[Fundamentals of Transportation/Mode Choice|Mode Choice]]. The zonal interchange analysis of trip distribution provides origin-destination trip tables.  Mode choice analysis tells which travelers will use which mode.  To determine facility needs and costs and benefits, we need to know the number of travelers on each route and link of the network (a route is simply a chain of links between an origin and destination). We need to undertake traffic (or trip) assignment.  Suppose there is a network of highways and transit systems and a proposed addition.  We first want to know the present pattern of travel times and flows and then what would happen if the addition were made. 

== Link Performance Function == 

The cost that a driver imposes on others is called the marginal cost. However, when making decisions, a driver only faces his own cost (the average cost) and ignores any costs imposed on others (the marginal cost).
* &lt;math&gt;Average Cost = S_T/ Q&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;Marginal Cost = \delta S_T/ \delta Q&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;S_T&lt;/math&gt; is the total cost, and &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is the flow.

=== BPR Link Performance Function ===

Suppose we are considering a highway network.  For each link there is a function stating the relationship between resistance and volume of traffic.  The Bureau of Public Roads (BPR) developed a link (arc) congestion (or volume-delay, or link performance)  function, which we will term  ''S&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;(v&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;)''

&lt;math&gt;
S_a \left( {Q_a } \right) = t_a \left( {1 + 0.15\left( {\frac{{Q_a }}
{{c_a }}} \right)^4 } \right)
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

''t&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; = free-flow travel time on link a per unit of time

''Q&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; = flow (or volume) of traffic on link a per unit of time (somewhat more accurately: flow attempting to use link ''a'')

''c&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; = capacity of link a per unit of time

''S&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;(Q&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;)'' is the average travel time for a vehicle on link ''a''
	
There are other congestion functions.  The CATS has long used a function different from that used by the BPR, but there seems to be little difference between results when the CATS and BPR functions are compared.

== Can Flow Exceed Capacity? ==

On a link, the capacity is thought of as “outflow.”
Demand is inflow. 

If inflow &gt; outflow for a period of time, there is queueing (and delay). 

For Example, for a 1 hour period, if 2100 cars arrive and 2000 depart, 100 are still there.
The link performance function tries to represent that phenomenon in a simple way.

== Wardrop's Principles of Equilibrium ==

=== User Equilibrium ===

Each user acts to minimize his/her own cost, subject to every other user doing the same. Travel times are equal on all used routes and lower than on any unused route.

=== System optimal ===

Each user acts to minimize the total travel time on the system.

== Price of Anarchy ==

The reason we have congestion is that people are selfish. The cost of that selfishness (when people behave according to their own interest rather than society's) is the ''price of anarchy''.

The ratio of system-wide travel time under User Equilibrium and System Optimal conditions.

Price of Anarchy = &lt;math&gt; UE/SO &gt; 1 &lt;/math&gt;

For a two-link network with linear link performance functions (latency functions), Price of Anarchy is &lt; 4/3.

Is this too much? Should something be done, or is 33% waste acceptable?
[The loss may be larger/smaller in other cases, under different assumptions, etc.]

== Conservation of Flow ==

An important factor in road assignment is the conservation of flow. This means that the number of vehicles entering the intersection (link segment) equals the number of vehicles exiting the intersection for a given period of time (except for sources and sinks).

Similarly, the number of vehicles entering the back of the link equals the number exiting the front (over a long period of time).

==Auto assignment==

===Long-standing techniques===

The above examples are adequate for a problem of two links, however real networks are much more complicated. The problem of estimating how many users are on each route is long standing.  Planners started looking hard at it as freeways and expressways (motorways) began to be developed.  The freeway offered a superior level of service over the local street system and diverted traffic from the local system.  At first, diversion was the technique.   Ratios of travel time were used, tempered by considerations of costs, comfort, and level of service.

The Chicago Area Transportation Study (CATS) researchers developed diversion curves for freeways versus local streets.  There was much work in California also, for California had early experiences with freeway planning.  In addition to work of a diversion sort, the CATS attacked some technical problems that arise when one works with complex networks.  One result was the Moore algorithm for finding shortest paths on networks.  

The issue the diversion approach didn’t handle was the feedback from the quantity of traffic on links and routes.  If a lot of vehicles try to use a facility, the facility becomes congested and travel time increases.  Absent some way to consider feedback, early planning studies (actually, most in the period 1960-1975) ignored feedback.  They used the Moore algorithm to determine shortest paths and assigned all traffic to shortest paths.  That’s called all or nothing assignment because either all of the traffic from ''i'' to ''j'' moves along a route or it does not.

The all-or-nothing or shortest path assignment is not trivial from a technical-computational view.  Each traffic zone is connected to ''n - 1'' zones, so there are numerous paths to be considered.  In addition, we are ultimately interested in traffic on links.  A link may be a part of several paths, and traffic along paths has to be summed link by link.

An argument can be made favoring the all-or-nothing approach. It goes this way: The planning study is to support investments so that a good level of service is available on all links. Using the travel times associated with the planned level of service, calculations indicate how traffic will flow once improvements are in place. Knowing the quantities of traffic on links, the capacity to be supplied to meet the desired level of service can be calculated.

===Heuristic procedures===

To take account of the affect of traffic loading on travel times and traffic equilibria, several heuristic calculation procedures were developed.  One heuristic proceeds incrementally.  The traffic to be assigned is divided into parts (usually 4).  Assign the first part of the traffic.  Compute new travel times and assign the next part of the traffic.  The last step is repeated until all the traffic is assigned.  The CATS used a variation on this; it assigned row by row in the O-D table.

The heuristic included in the FHWA collection of computer programs proceeds another way.  
*Step 0: Start by loading all traffic using an all or nothing procedure.  
*Step 1: Compute the resulting travel times and reassign traffic.  
*Step 2: Now, begin to reassign using weights.  Compute the weighted travel times in the previous two loadings and use those for the next assignment.  The latest iteration gets a weight of 0.25 and the previous gets a weight of 0.75.  
*Step 3. Continue. 

These procedures seem to work “pretty well,” but they are not exact.

===Frank-Wolfe algorithm===

Dafermos (1968) applied the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank-Wolfe_algorithm Frank-Wolfe algorithm] (1956, Florian 1976), which can be used to deal with the traffic equilibrium problem.  


===Equilibrium Assignment===

To assign traffic to paths and links we have to have rules, and there are the well-known [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wardrop  Wardrop equilibrium] (1952) conditions.  The essence of these is that travelers will strive to find the shortest (least resistance) path from origin to destination, and network equilibrium occurs when no traveler can decrease travel effort by shifting to a new path. These are termed user optimal conditions, for no user will gain from changing travel paths once the system is in equilibrium.  

The user optimum equilibrium can be found by solving the following nonlinear programming problem

&lt;math&gt;
\min \sum_a {\int_0^{v_a} {S_a \left( Q_a \right)} } dx
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;		

subject to:

&lt;math&gt; Q_a  = \sum_i {\sum_j {\sum_r {\alpha _{ij}^{ar} Q_{ij}^r } } } \,\! &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\sum_r {Q_{ij}^r  = Q_{ij} } 
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
Q_a \geq 0,\;Q_{ij}^r  \geq 0
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where
&lt;math&gt;
Q_{ij}^r 
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
is the number of vehicles on path ''r'' from origin ''i'' to destination ''j''.  So constraint (2) says that all travel must take place: ''i = 1 ... n; j = 1 ...  n''

&lt;math&gt;\alpha _{ij}^{ar} \,\!&lt;/math&gt; = 1  if link  ''a'' is on path  ''r''  from  ''i''  to ''j'' ; zero otherwise.

So constraint (1) sums traffic on each link.  There is a constraint for each link on the network.  Constraint (3) assures no negative traffic.

==Transit assignment==

There are also methods that have been developed to assign passengers to transit vehicles. &lt;ref&gt;[http://emme2.spiess.ch/congtras/congtras.html Spiess (1993) Transit Equilibrium Assignment based on Optimal Strategies]&lt;/ref&gt;
In an effort to increase the accuracy of transit assignment estimates, a number of assumptions are generally made. Examples of these include the following:

* All transit trips are run on a set and predefined schedule that is known or readily available to the users.
* There is a fixed capacity associated with the transit service (car/trolley/bus capacity).&lt;ref&gt;[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.52.9705 Paolo Carraresi , Federico Malucelli , Stefano Pallottino (1995) On the Regional Mass Transit Assignment ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

=== Example 1 ===
[[Image:TwoRouteNetwork.png| Bordercolor=#00FFFF|thumb|center|500px|Figure 1 - Two Route Network]]
{{TProblem|Solve for the flows on Links ''a'' and ''b'' in the Simple Network of two parallel links just shown if the link performance function on link ''a'': 

&lt;math&gt;S_a = 5 + 2* Q_a\,\!&lt;/math&gt; 

and the function on link ''b'': 

&lt;math&gt;S_b = 10+Q_b\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where total flow between the origin and destination is 1000 trips.
}}

{{answer| 
Time (Cost)  is equal on all used routes so 
&lt;math&gt;S_a=S_b&lt;/math&gt;

And we have Conservation of flow so,
&lt;math&gt; Q_a+Q_b=Qo=Qd=1000&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;5+2*(1000- Q_b )=10+ Q_2&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;1995=3 Q_b&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;Q_b =665; Q_a =335&lt;/math&gt;
}}

===Example 2===

{{TProblem | 
An example from Eash, Janson, and Boyce (1979) will illustrate the solution to the nonlinear program problem. There are two links from node 1 to node 2, and there is a resistance function for each link (see Figure 1).  Areas under the curves in Figure 2 correspond to the integration from 0 to ''a'' in equation 1, they sum to 220,674.  Note that the function for link ''b'' is plotted in the reverse direction.  
 
&lt;math&gt;
S_a  = 15\left( {1 + 0.15\left( {\frac{{Q_a }}{{1000}}} \right)^4 } \right) 
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; 
S_b  = 20\left( {1 + 0.15\left( {\frac{{Q_b }}{{3000}}} \right)^4 } \right)
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
Q_a  + Q_b  = 8000
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Show graphically the equilibrium result.
}}

{{Answer |



[[Image:EquilibriumAssignment2.png|thumb|center|500px|Figure 2 - Graphical Solution to the Equilibrium Assignment Problem]]

[[Image:EquilibriumAssignment3.png|thumb|center|500px|Figure 3 - Allocation of Vehicles not Satisfying the Equilibrium Condition]] 

At equilibrium there are 2,152 vehicles on link ''a'' and 5,847 on link ''b''.  Travel time is the same on each route: about 63.

Figure 3 illustrates an allocation of vehicles that is not consistent with the equilibrium solution.  The curves are unchanged, but with the new allocation of vehicles to routes the shaded area has to be included in the solution, so the Figure 3 solution is larger than the solution in Figure 2 by the area of the shaded area.

Given a flow of six (6) units from origin “o” to destination “r”.  Flow on each route ab is designated with Qab in the Time Function.  Apply Wardrop's Network Equilibrium Principle (Users Equalize Travel Times on all used routes)

'''A.'''  What is the flow and travel time on each link? 
(complete the table below) for Network A

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;background: ##aaaaaa; border: 4px solid #02D4EE; padding: 6pt; margin: 12pt 0.5em; width: -0.5em&quot;&gt;
[[Image:Evolution-tasks.png|40px|left|Example]]'''Solution:'''&lt;br&gt;
''' Part A '''

What is the flow and travel time on each link?  Complete the table below for Network A:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+ Link Attributes
|-
! Link
! Link Performance Function
! Flow
! Time
|-
| o-p || &lt;math&gt;C_{op} = 5 *Q_{op} &lt;/math&gt;|| ||   
|-
| p-r || &lt;math&gt;C_{pr} = 25 + Q_{pr} &lt;/math&gt;|| || 
|-
| o-q || &lt;math&gt;C_{oq} = 20 + 2*Q_{oq} &lt;/math&gt;|| || 	 
|-
| q-r || &lt;math&gt;C_{qr} = 5 *Q_{qr} &lt;/math&gt;|| ||
|}	 

These four links are really 2 links O-P-R and O-Q-R, because by conservation of flow Qop = Qpr and Qoq = Qqr.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+ Link Attributes
|-
! Link
! Link Performance Function
! Flow
! Time
|-
| o-p-r || &lt;math&gt;C_{opr} =25+ 6 *Q_{opr} &lt;/math&gt;|| ||   
|-
| o-q-r || &lt;math&gt;C_{oqr} = 20 + 7*Q_{oq} &lt;/math&gt;|| || 	 
|}

By Wardrop's Equilibrium Principle, the travel time (cost) on each used route must be equal. Therefore 
&lt;math&gt;C_{opr} = C_{oqr}&lt;/math&gt;. 

OR

&lt;math&gt;25+ 6*Q_{opr}= 20+7*Q_{oqr}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;5+ 6*Q_{opr}= 7*Q_{oqr}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;Q_{oqr} = 5/7 + 6*Q_{opr}/7&lt;/math&gt;


By the conservation of flow principle

&lt;math&gt;Q_{oqr}+Q_{opr} = 6&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;Q_{opr} = 6 - Q_{oqr}&lt;/math&gt;


By substitution

&lt;math&gt;Q_{oqr} = 5/7 + 6/7 (6 - Q_{oqr}) = 41/7 -6*Q_{oqr}/7&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;13*Qoqr = 41&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;Q_{oqr} = 41/13 = 3.15&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;Q_{opr}=2.84&lt;/math&gt;


Check

&lt;math&gt;42.01 = 25+6(2.84)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;42.05 = 20+7(3.15)&lt;/math&gt;


Check (within rounding error)

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+ Link Attributes
|-
! Link
! Link Performance Function
! Flow
! Time
|-
| o-p-r || &lt;math&gt;C_{opr} =25+ 6 *Q_{opr} &lt;/math&gt;|| 2.84 || 42.01   
|-
| o-q-r || &lt;math&gt;C_{oqr} = 20 + 7*Q_{oq} &lt;/math&gt;|| 3.15 || 42.01	 
|}

or expanding back to the original table:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+ Link Attributes
|-
! Link
! Link Performance Function
! Flow
! Time
|-
| o-p || &lt;math&gt;C_{op} = 5 *Q_{op} &lt;/math&gt;|| 2.84 ||   14.2
|-
| p-r || &lt;math&gt;C_{pr} = 25 + Q_{pr} &lt;/math&gt;|| 2.84 || 27.84 
|-
| o-q || &lt;math&gt;C_{oq} = 20 + 2*Q_{oq} &lt;/math&gt;|| 3.15 || 26.3 	 
|-
| q-r || &lt;math&gt;C_{qr} = 5 *Q_{qr} &lt;/math&gt;|| 3.15 || 15.75
|}	

User Equilibrium: Total Delay = 42.01 * 6 = 252.06

''' Part B '''

What is the system optimal assignment?


Conservation of Flow: 

&lt;math&gt;Q_{opr}+Q_{oqr} = 6 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;Total Delay = Q_{opr}(25+ 6*Q_{opr}) + Q_{oqr}(20+7*Q_{oqr}) \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;25 Q_{opr} + 6 Q_{opr}^2 + (6-Q_{opr})( 20 + 7(6-Q_{opr}))\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;25 Q_{opr} + 6 Q_{opr}^2 + (6-Q_{opr})( 62 - 7Q_{opr}))\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;25 Q_{opr} + 6 Q_{opr}^2 + 372 - 62 Q_{opr} - 42 Q_{opr} + 7 Q_{opr}^2\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;13 Q_{opr}^2 - 79 Q_{opr} + 372\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Analytic Solution requires minimizing total delay

&lt;math&gt;\delta C/\delta Q = 26 Q_{opr} - 79 = 0\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;Q_{opr} = 79/26 = 3.04\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;Q_{oqr} = 6-Q_{opr}=2.96\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

And we can compute the SO travel times on each path

&lt;math&gt; C_{opr,SO} = 25+ 6*3.04 = 43.24 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; C_{oqr,SO} = 20+7*2.96 = 40.72 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Note that unlike the UE solution, &lt;math&gt; C_{opr,SO} &gt; C_{oqr,SO} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Total Delay = 3.04(25+ 6*3.04) + 2.96(20+7*2.96) = 131.45+120.53= 251.98

Note: one could also use software such as a &quot;Solver&quot; algorithm to find this solution.

''' Part C '''

What is the Price of Anarchy?

User Equilibrium: Total Delay =252.06
System Optimal: Total Delay = 251.98

Price of Anarchy = 252.06/251.98 = 1.0003 &lt; 4/3
&lt;/div&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Dimmers''' are mechanical or electromechanical devices used to vary the amount of electrical power being sent to each lighting instrument. In most modern theaters, changing the dimmers' output is the primary means of controlling the intensity of the lighting on stage.

The construction of dimmers has evolved considerably over time. Some of the oldest dimmers used in the theater, known as 'salt water dimmers,' consisted of a glass jar filled with salt water with two metal leads placed inside. When this was wired in series with the light to be controlled, an operator could control the light's output by varying the distance between the leads. This was a difficult (and often hazardous) process.

Modern dimmers are much more technically complex, and a great deal safer. They control the amount of voltage in the circuit using ''thyristors'', simple electronic circuits that rapidly turn themselves on and off, allowing precisely the amount of current needed to pass through.

School funding inequalities affect people in areas like the inner city and rural areas.  Students living in these areas of the United States exhibit lower educational achievement and a higher percentage of dropping out of high school than do their suburban counterparts (Crowley, Devey, Donald).  The likelihood of dropping out of high school is twenty-eight percent higher than in rural areas, the percent for rural areas is only eighteen percent.


Family, class, background, capital income and parental education have a strong positive influence on achievement and decrease the dropping rate.  Families and school sin America’s inner cities and rural places lack resources that promote educational achievement and attainment.  Locales have lower family income, less parental education, and more siblings per household. Poorly performance schools tend to serve the most impoverished populations in the United States and are located in the most disadvantaged rural and urban areas of the country.  Inner city and rural areas differ substantially from suburban places in the availability of resources, local economy, economic development and spatial stratification.  Urban inner city areas have seen decentralization and capital flight since the 50’s.  What remains is a poor and often minority population increasingly dependent on low wage and relatively unstable service sector jobs.  Rural areas throughout the country too have been shaken by industrial restructuring, especially in agriculture, which has increased rates of unemployment, dependence on part time service sector work, and family economic vulnerability (Duncan 1996).  Suburban neighborhoods on the other hand is populated by educated, two parent families and have lower rates of poverty.  It has been said to be easier for a child to be educated in such context given the resource that both schools and families bring to bear on the educational process and on potentially influential investments (Roscigno 1999).  Family socioeconomics status and the economic well being of children are depressed in inner city and rural areas, a condition that has only increased in the past decades.  Socioeconomic status of a student’s household is consistently influential for both achievement and attainment.  This may be part to influence of economic well being on cognitive development early in education.  Middle and upper class parents can hire tutors and make time to meet with teachers; they are more likely to utilize proper English in the household, and they tend to structure their children’s leisure time in educationally meaningful ways (Lareau 2002).  Family structure is also patterned by local economic opportunity.  Rural families are more likely to have two parents, rural tends in a non marital childbearing and family dissolution now mirror those of inner city areas. All these statistics on students not being able to be educated because of what district they are in is just one of the problems.  School funding is the main cost of children not being educated.  Schools in the inner cities are nothing compared to those schools in suburban areas.  The schools in the city are old buildings that do not get fixed at all.  Student’s get old hand me down books, ruined desks, or even ugly old walls on the inside.  These buildings that are considered schools for these children are outrages and disgusting.  Compared to those in the suburban area, the schools might be new or renovated from ground up.  Technology is better, reading material better, and the facility is better.  Another example that is different from those students in inner city schools, they have different curriculums.  The wealthier school might have better programs for students, while the cities have little programs and not enough resources to have any.


The total amount of money available to a school district for education is the sum of locally raised revenues, state aid, federal aid, and miscellaneous revenues.  In the past most money that supported public elementary and secondary schools came from the local revenue sources and property taxes.  An increase in state revenue has helped offset decreases in local funding of the schools.  Currently states governments contribute about forty nine percent, local governments offer about forty three percent and the federal government provides about nine percent toward the financing of public schools.  State leaders planned to use the self inflicted crisis to recast the existing school finance system, which left great gaps in spending power between wealthy and poor school districts.  The quality of education in school districts with low property values, usually inner city and rural districts.  Property tax funding systems mean that a school district in a well to do areas is able to raise and spend much more money per pupil than districts in poor areas can.  


The future of education is left up with the states.  States are left with few popular options when faced with court rulings that order them to eliminate disparities in education funding.  The state also faces problems with bring the spending levels of poor and wealthy school districts closer together.  A few states have raised income and sales taxes to provide catch up money to poorer districts.  Others have found money in state budgets to increase spending on needy schools, and a few from wealthy districts to poorer ones.  Critics of spending equity say that even though some school districts may benefit from increased funding, attempts to achieve equity are misguided.  The central issue, they say, is whether the students are learning.  While money may not be the only answer to improving education in poor school districts, it is certainly a good place to start.  Students will never have an opportunity to meet higher standards unless their schools have adequate resources, they maintain.

Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]], a collection of open-content textbooks!

You should consider [[Special:Userlogin|creating an account or logging in]]. Here are some advantages:

* The use of a username of your choice.
* Greater security and privacy, as your IP address will be hidden from most users.
* You get your own personal user page and talk page, instead of having to share it.
* [[Special:Contributions/{{PAGENAME}}|Your contributions]] will be recognized as your own, and not confused with anyone else's.
* The use of your own watchlist which shows when pages you are interested in have been edited.
* Your opinions carry greater weight in the [[Wikibooks:Decision making|decision making process]].
* You become a recognized member of the Wikibooks community.
* Creating an account is easy and only takes a few minutes of your time, especially given the benefits.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikibookian and [[Special:Userlogin|create an account]].&lt;br/&gt;
Feel free to ask any questions on my talk page or in the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading room]].&lt;br/&gt;
Be sure to sign your posts and comments on talk pages with four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;),
this will let other editors know you said it.&lt;br/&gt;

| &lt;!-- this is so if anyone tries to use it where it doesn't go they will know. --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">This page is to be used as reference to making Virgin Strawberry Daiquiris. For regular (alcoholic), just add 2 cups of rum (or other liqueur) to this recipe. Please keep in mind that this is only one recipe used for mixing Daiquiris, and it is always fun to try different methods to pick your favorite. 

== Procedure ==
=== Ingredients ===
*1 cup of cold milk, cream, or combination of the two
*8 halved strawberries or other fruit if preferred
*1/4 cup water
*4 cups sugar
*1/2 cup ice
*1 Tablespoon of whipped cream (optional)

=== Directions ===
*Add all ingredients to blender.
*Blend until smooth and creamy.
*Freeze for 2 minute.
*Serve in shallow, chilled glass

=== Notes ===
#Strawberries can be replaced by any other fruit to create a different flavor of drink.
#Frozen fruits often yield a better consistency and texture than fresh fruit.
#One may also mix a matching flavored liqueur.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==== Standard C String &amp; Character ====
The Standard C Library includes also  routines that deals with characters and strings. You must keep in mind that in C, a string of characters is stored in successive elements of a character array and terminated by the '''NULL''' character.

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
/* &quot;Hello&quot; is stored in a character array */
char note[SIZE];
note[0] = 'H'; note[1] = 'e'; note[2] = 'l'; note[3] = 'l'; note[4] = 'o'; note[5] = '\0';
&lt;/source&gt;

Even if outdated this C string and character functions still appear in old code and more so than the previous I/O functions.

[[Image:xrx-book-cover.jpg|right]]
'''XRX''' or [[w:XForms|XForms]]/[[w:Representational_State_Transfer|REST]]/[[w:XQuery|XQuery]] is a simple and elegant web application architecture that leverages modern declarative and functional programming systems.  XRX allows the developer to create rich-client web applications that perform complex functions without the need for middle-tier objects, relational databases or client-side JavaScript.

XRX is based on three standards:

#XForms on the client
#REST interfaces
#XQuery on the server

These three standards have been created by the [[w:World Wide Web Consortium|W3C]] standards organization and represent their vision of the future of web application development.  For discussions on alternate definitions of the XRX web application architecture see [[/What is XRX/]].

This wikibook is intended as an example that specifically uses all three of these technologies to create small applications that work together.

== Related Wikibooks ==
There are two sibling Wikibooks that this Wikibook is designed to complement.

The [[XForms]] Tutorial and Cookbook Wikibook has over 90 sample XForms application to help you become familiar with the XForms model and XForms controls.  Although XForms has only 21 elements they can be combined in many different ways to build very complex web clients.

The [[XQuery]] Wikibook is focused on using the XQuery language with almost all of the sample programs using the eXist native XML database.

The XForms Wikibook has minimal dependencies on which server you use to host your web forms.  Almost all of the XQuery Wikibook does not assume any prior knowledge of XForms.  This book, on the other hand, assumes that you will be using '''both''' XForms and XQuery to create a complete web application development environment.

== Subversion Repository ==
Many of the example programs in this cookbook are now being stored in a Subversion repository on GoogleCode.  The URL for the XRX GoogleCode is here:

[http://code.google.com/p/xrx http://code.google.com/p/xrx]

If you are using an IDE with a Subversion client such as Eclipse or oXygen, the URL for the repository is:

[https://xrx.googlecode.com/svn/trunk https://xrx.googlecode.com/svn/trunk]

If you would like a read-only copy, you can use the non-SSL URL

[http://xrx.googlecode.com/svn/trunk http://xrx.googlecode.com/svn/trunk]

      <text xml:space="preserve">===== atof =====

{{C++ Programming/Syntax|
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;
double atof( const char *str );
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

The function atof() converts str into a double, then returns that value. str must start with a valid number, but can be terminated with any non-numerical character, other than &quot;E&quot; or &quot;e&quot;. For example,

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
x = atof( &quot;42.0is_the_answer&quot; ); 
&lt;/source&gt;

results in x being set to 42.0.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want to allow the user to save form data into a named file in an eXist collection that will not conflict with existing files.

== Method ==
When the user selects a Save button we will use switch/case to open up a save dialogue.  In this dialogue we will list all of the current files in a collection and allow the user to create a new file with a name that does not conflict with any existing file names.  If the user selects a file from the list, we will replace the current file name with that file name.

== Using the get-child-resources Function ==
eXist provides a function that lists the files in a collection.  You can get a sorted list of all the files in a collection with the following XQuery

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;
declare namespace xdb=&quot;http://exist-db.org/xquery/xmldb&quot;;
declare option exist:serialize &quot;method=xml media-type=text/xml indent=yes&quot;;

let $collection := request:get-parameter('collection', '/db/test')

return
&lt;files&gt;{
         for $child in xdb:get-child-resources($collection)
         order by lower-case($child)
         return
        &lt;file&gt;{$child}&lt;/file&gt;
}&lt;/files&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

When executed, this XQuery will return the files in a collection.  For example here is the URL of an XQuery execution with the collection parameter passed as an argument:

'''list-files-in-collection.xq?collection=/db/rss'''

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;files&gt;
   &lt;file&gt;news.rss&lt;/file&gt;
   &lt;file&gt;test.rss&lt;/file&gt;
&lt;/files&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

We can then use this XML listing to display a list of existing files and allow the user to select a name that is not on this list.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;html xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot; xmlns:ev=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events&quot; xmlns:xsd=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema&quot; xmlns:xf=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2002/xforms&quot;&gt;

        &lt;link type=&quot;text/css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;save-panel.css&quot; /&gt;

        &lt;xf:model&gt;
            
            &lt;!-- This is the data that we want to save to a file on the server. --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">===== atoi =====

{{C++ Programming/Syntax|
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;
int atoi( const char *str );
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

The atoi() function converts str into an integer, and returns that integer. ''str'' should start with a whitespace or some sort of number, and atoi() will stop reading from ''str'' as soon as a non-numerical character has been read. For example:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
int i;
i = atoi( &quot;512&quot; );
i = atoi( &quot;512.035&quot; );
i = atoi( &quot;   512.035&quot; );
i = atoi( &quot;   512+34&quot; );
i = atoi( &quot;   512 bottles of beer on the wall&quot; ); 
&lt;/source&gt;

All five of the above assignments to the variable ''i'' would result in it being set to 512.

If the conversion cannot be performed, then atoi() will return zero:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
int i = atoi( &quot; does not work: 512&quot; );  // results in i == 0
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;big&gt;'''Direct3D''' is the most advanced and complex component of DirectX.&lt;/big&gt; It deals with one of the most complex areas of modern computing - graphics. It relies heavily on mathematics, specifically Trigonometry and Algebra.

== Prerequisites ==
Understanding the majority of Direct3D requires understanding some mathematical concepts; including [[Statics/Vector_Math|Vectors]], [[w:Matrix_(mathematics)|Matrices]], and [[Trigonometry]]. While you will be able to do much of the basics in developing for DirectX without these, they become important later on and most people are generally unable to understand why we are doing something.

== Goals ==
This section of the [[DirectX]] book will (hopefully) teach you the basics of Direct3D, such as initialization, vertex and index buffers, cameras, models, textures, lights, and particles. Throughout the book, we will implement a benchmarking tool to test our understanding.

== Resources ==
These files will be used to provide a framework for our benchmark application:

*[[/DirectX/9.0/Direct3D/main.cpp | Framework main.cpp]]

== Contents ==
*[[DirectX/9.0/Direct3D/Initialization|Initialization]][[File:75%.svg]]
*[[DirectX/9.0/Direct3D/Primitives_and_Rendering|Primitives and Rendering]][[File:25%.svg]]

If you can use Direct3D; DirectSound is a breeze. There aren't as many errors that can occur; and you can basically skip the initialization because it's almost the same.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Introduction'''
	

Teachers as well as students need someone to listen to them and to help them with problems that they may be facing. A mentor is defined as a trusted counselor or guide. New teachers are faced with many overwhelming, new experiences that are why having a mentor is effective not only for the growth of the teacher but also for the growth of the school.
What do mentors bring to the classroom?
	“The mentor is supposed to just be there when you need her for whatever. They [the novice teachers] know that, and I establish that with them at the very beginning, that I’m here to help you in any capacity but what I do is make suggestion. And I tell them, if you don’t follow them its all right. Maybe what I suggest is something that you feel that you can’t use. –Terri, mentor teacher in Los Angeles” (Nemser and Parker).Mentors may not be able to fix the entire problem that may arise for new teachers but their suggestions make a difference. Someone close to a mentor would be a support teacher. “I see myself as someone who thinks with the clients I’m working with and can maybe help turn their thinking toward paths of growth that they think would be useful for themselves… There’s also a little bit of me in their thinking…So I make suggestion and help people to look at possibilities, but id never force them to take that road.-Pete, support teacher in Albuquerque (Nemser and Parker). Experienced teachers can become mentors and help new teachers stay positive in the classroom.


'''What are the benefits of having mentors?'''
	

  “The chance to “mentor” a new teacher addresses two serious problems in teaching, the abrupt and unsupported entry of novices into the field and difficulty of keeping good, experienced teachers in the classroom” (nemser and parker). According to most professionals having a mentor gets rid of the “sink or swim” mentality. Earlier in the Education institution they would throw teachers to the classrooms right out of school without anyone to guide them in their new experiences. Having a mentor gives the new teacher more support and keeps them learning and growing in their position. “Mentors are to guide the new teachers, to provide assistance, to help them in securing skills-all the things that the teachers are lacking, that they have either not had because they’ve not had any teacher classes and those everyday things that they learn just by virtue of teaching” (Nemser and Patrick).


'''What are the guidelines for Mentors?'''


	Mentors are important for teachers and the school because they give the support that the teacher needs to keep learning and teaching what they have learned. “Mentor teacher programs utilizing specially trained public school teachers as mentors to provide assistance and professional support to teachers entering the profession and to improve the performance of experienced teachers who are not performing at an acceptable level” (Mentor Teacher Programs). Teachers who have already been teaching for a while already have that security and experience in the classroom that they can share with new upcoming teachers. According to different studies “varying degrees of trauma associated with newness, such that it was equally difficult to begin teaching in a new setting” (Zimpher and Rieger). 


'''The Background of the Mentor program'''
	

In 1985-1991 “The Beginning Teacher Assistance Program (BTAP), initiated in 1985 as the first support program for beginning teachers, evolved into a performance assessment required for licensure. BTAP was rescinded by the General Assembly in 1991” (Mentor Teacher Programs). From 1987 to 2000 the General Assembly has been making many new decisions on mentoring for teachers. The Virginia General Assembly appropriated an additional 300,000 for mentor teacher programs and in 2000 there was the Quality Enhancement Act requiring a mentor for every beginning teacher (Mentor Teacher Programs).

'''How do Mentors affect new teachers?'''

	Mentors across the board help new teacher’s everyday in the schools. “Mentor programs help beginning teachers make a successful transition into teaching by relying on the expertise of veterans to provide a clinical, real-world training process” (Mentor Teacher Program). According to the article Mentor Teacher Programs new teachers who are mentored receive higher ratings from their principals, develop better planning skills, handle discipline problems more effectively and conduct more productive classroom discussions. Here is a story of a girl Julia who had the spark to teach but found out that it was harder than she thought “As the school year wore on, Julia wore out. Teaching left her with feelings of disillusionment, shattering her idealism. By June, Julia decided to leave teaching and to pursue another career” (Marge Scherer). 
Why mentors are important
	Mentors are important because they offer the new teacher a chance to enjoy what they love doing without becoming overwhelmed by the new stresses faced in the class room. Once the teacher has been there for a while they themselves can help out the new teacher by becoming their mentor.

















I think that every teacher should have a mentor beside them giving them advice and support. As we have seen previously it isn’t all about the showing them away around the school and class room, it is also about the emotional support and the needs that the new teacher needs. We all remember when we have started something new and how we were frightened by that fear of the unknown, being a new teacher is the same they are trying to come out on top because they know that this is the career that they want to pursue. Mentors are important they not only support their fellow co-workers but they also allow them to pursue the job that they have dreamed of.

{{Side note|side=right|{{Java Swings/Content}}}}
__NOTOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

The layout of components is dictated by the layout manager used. There are 7 layout managers built into Java. Most UIs are built using some combination of them, typically by nesting layout managers. The most commonly used layouts are FlowLayout, BorderLayout and BoxLayout.

{{XNote|LayoutManagers are a concept from AWT that is also used in Swing. This means they can be used in rendering AWT-based UIs as well as Swing-based UIs. They are mentioned here because they are an integral part of Swing UI development but they are not exclusive to Swing. The built in LayoutManagers all reside in the &lt;code&gt;java.awt&lt;/code&gt; package.}}

==BorderLayout==
* Used to arrange components around a center panel.
* Sizes components to use all available space for their region.
** North / South components will be as tall as their preferred height and as wide as the width of the component they're in.
** East / West components will be as wide as their preferred width and as tall as the height of the component they're in minus the preferred heights of the North and South components.
** Center will use all remaining space in the component after the North / South / East / West components have been sized.

                borderLayoutFrame.setVisible(true);
            }
        });
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;}}

==FlowLayout==

* Used to arrange components in a straight horizontal line.
* If there is not enough space for all the components to fit, they'll be moved to the next line.
* Components are set at their preferred sizes.

                contentPane instead.
*/
                Container contentPane = flowLayoutFrame.getContentPane();
                contentPane.setLayout(new FlowLayout());
                contentPane.add(new JButton(&quot;Button A&quot;));

                // buttonB will not be resized smaller than 200x40 pixels
                JButton buttonB = new JButton(&quot;Button B&quot;);
                buttonB.setPreferredSize(new Dimension(200, 40));
                contentPane.add(buttonB);
                contentPane.add(new JButton(&quot;Button C&quot;));
                contentPane.add(new JButton(&quot;Button D&quot;));

                flowLayoutFrame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
                flowLayoutFrame.setSize(400, 200);
                flowLayoutFrame.setVisible(true);
            }
        });
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;}}

==BoxLayout==
* Used to arrange components vertically or horizontally. &lt;code&gt;BoxLayout&lt;/code&gt; is essentially a replacement for &lt;code&gt;FlowLayout&lt;/code&gt; that is more powerful if thats what you're going for. However with great power comes great responsibility... or something like that. The trade off for having more power is you have to do a bit more work, but you can get things to look closer to what you really want. To demonstrate we'll go through several examples.
{{XNote|Though the comments about running in the EDT and adding to the content pane aren't in these examples, note we're still doing all the work on the components in the EDT and adding components to the content pane.}}

&lt;code&gt;BoxLayout&lt;/code&gt;s come in two basic flavors. Vertical or horizontal. These are represented by the constants &lt;code&gt;BoxLayout.X_AXIS&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;BoxLayout.Y_AXIS&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;BoxLayout.LINE_AXIS&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;BoxLayout.PAGE_AXIS&lt;/code&gt;. X/Y_AXIS specify to always layout the components along the X or Y axis of the container. The components are then arranged left to right (X_AXIS) or top to bottom (Y_AXIS). LINE/PAGE_AXIS will do exactly the same thing as X/Y_AXIS ''assuming'' the &lt;code&gt;ComponentOrientation&lt;/code&gt; field of the parent container is left to right oriented. If not, LINE_AXIS will add components from right to left, and PAGE_AXIS will by default align components on the right side of the panel. If you are planning to support locale specific layouts, PAGE_AXIS is the one for you.

Talking about alignments is fun, but lets see a demo. The below demo will create a main window which will allow you to create child windows laid out with the proper alignments.

==CardLayout==
* Used to show one component at a time from a set of components. It is like a deck of flash cards, where you show one of the cards at a time, hence the name. You can quickly change which component is shown at any time, e.g., when the user clicks a button.

==GridLayout==
* Used to arrange components in an evenly spaced grid.

__NOTOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

== Calculator ==
The example below builds a user interface using multiple nested layout managers, applies listeners and client properties to components, and demonstrates how to create components from the Event Dispatch Thread (EDT).

=== Main Method ===
The main method is pretty straight forward.
{{XExample|1='''Main method'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Remember, all swing components must be accessed from
    // the event dispatch thread.
    SwingUtilities.invokeLater(new Runnable() {
        public void run() {
            Calculator calc = new Calculator();
            calc.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
            calc.setVisible(true);
        }
    });
}
&lt;/source&gt;}}
It creates a new calculator, sets it to exit the program when its closed and then makes it visible. The interesting bit about this code is that it doesn't happen in the main thread. It happens in the event dispatch thread. While in a simple application like this it's enough to simply wrap the whole component creation in an &lt;code&gt;invokeLater()&lt;/code&gt; to push it into the EDT, larger applications need to be careful that they only access UI components from the EDT. Not doing so can cause mysterious deadlocks in applications.

=== Constructor ===
The constructor is where the calculator is laid out.
{{XExample|1='''The constructor'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
public Calculator() {
    super(&quot;Calculator&quot;);

    JPanel mainPanel = new JPanel(new BorderLayout());
    JPanel numberPanel = buildNumberPanel();
    JPanel operatorPanel = buildOperatorPanel();
    JPanel clearPanel = buildClearPanel();
    lcdDisplay = new JTextArea();
    mainPanel.add(clearPanel, BorderLayout.SOUTH);
    mainPanel.add(numberPanel, BorderLayout.CENTER);
    mainPanel.add(operatorPanel, BorderLayout.EAST);
    mainPanel.add(lcdDisplay, BorderLayout.NORTH);

    errorDisplay = new JLabel(&quot; &quot;);
    errorDisplay.setFont(new Font(&quot;Dialog&quot;, Font.BOLD, 12));

    getContentPane().setLayout(new BorderLayout());
    getContentPane().add(mainPanel, BorderLayout.CENTER);
    getContentPane().add(errorDisplay, BorderLayout.SOUTH);

    pack();
    resetState();
}
&lt;/source&gt;}}
This approach uses inheritance for defining the calculator. Another way of doing it would have been to have a &lt;code&gt;getComponent()&lt;/code&gt; method which would return a panel laid out as desired. The calculator would then be a controller dictating the behavior of the panels and own the panel all the components were on. While more complex, that method also scales more easily to larger, more complicated UIs. Inheritance has the problem of child classes having the ability to override methods that are currently being called in the constructor of the parent class. If the overridden methods required a field in the child class to be already initialized, you're in trouble. At the time that the method would be called in the parent, the child hasn't been fully initialized yet.

The constructor uses two BorderLayouts to do the layout. The first is for the main panel, the second is to compose the main panel with the error message panel. Also, each of the subpanels in the main panel are built with their own layout managers. This is a good example of building a more complicated UI as a composite of multiple simpler sub-panels.

=== Listeners ===
Here we start getting into the fun bits. For each of the buttons we want something to listen for the pushed button. The &lt;code&gt;ActionListener&lt;/code&gt; class does just that.
{{XExample|1='''The listeners'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
private final ActionListener numberListener = new ActionListener() {
    public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
        JComponent source = (JComponent)e.getSource();
        Integer number = (Integer) source.getClientProperty(NUMBER_PROPERTY);
        if (number == null){
            throw new IllegalStateException(&quot;No NUMBER_PROPERTY on component&quot;);
        }

        numberButtonPressed(number.intValue());
    }
};

private final ActionListener decimalListener = new ActionListener() {
    public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
        decimalButtonPressed();
    }
};

private final ActionListener operatorListener = new ActionListener() {
    public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
        JComponent source = (JComponent) e.getSource();
        Integer opCode = (Integer) source.getClientProperty(OPERATOR_PROPERTY);
        if (opCode == null) {
            throw new IllegalStateException(&quot;No OPERATOR_PROPERTY on component&quot;);
        }

        operatorButtonPressed(opCode);
    }
};

private final ActionListener clearListener = new ActionListener() {
    public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
        resetState();
    }
};
&lt;/source&gt;}}
We setup a separate listener for each type of button. Numbers, Decimals, Operators and Clear buttons. Each one processes the message associated with that class of button and only that class of button. While that's fine, how do you determine which button in that class was pressed? Well, Swing provides a way of setting arbitrary properties on objects. This is accomplished by the &lt;code&gt;getClientProperty putClientProperty&lt;/code&gt; pair. Below, we tell the difference between the number buttons by which number is associated with the &lt;code&gt;clientProperty&lt;/code&gt; of the button. Similarly the &lt;code&gt;operatorListener&lt;/code&gt; does the same, but pulling out its own property.

=== Building the buttons ===
Here we can see how the listeners get assigned to the buttons.
{{XExample|1='''The buttons'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
private JButton buildNumberButton(int number) {
    JButton button = new JButton(Integer.toString(number));
    button.putClientProperty(NUMBER_PROPERTY, Integer.valueOf(number));
    button.addActionListener(numberListener);
    return button;
}

private JButton buildOperatorButton(String symbol, int opType) {
    JButton plus = new JButton(symbol);
    plus.putClientProperty(OPERATOR_PROPERTY, Integer.valueOf(opType));
    plus.addActionListener(operatorListener);
    return plus;
}
&lt;/source&gt;}}
First we set the label for the buttons by passing a &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; to the constructor of the JButton, then we set the property value that we want using &lt;code&gt;putClientProperty&lt;/code&gt; then we add the appropriate action listener to the button. Action listeners are activated when the component takes its intended action. For a &lt;code&gt;JButton&lt;code&gt; that means being pressed.

=== Building the panels ===
Here we show building the number panel.
{{XExample|1='''The panels'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
public JPanel buildNumberPanel() {
    JPanel panel = new JPanel();
    panel.setLayout(new GridLayout(4, 3));

    panel.add(buildNumberButton(1));
    panel.add(buildNumberButton(2));
    panel.add(buildNumberButton(3));
    panel.add(buildNumberButton(4));
    panel.add(buildNumberButton(5));
    panel.add(buildNumberButton(6));
    panel.add(buildNumberButton(7));
    panel.add(buildNumberButton(8));
    panel.add(buildNumberButton(9));

    JButton buttonDec = new JButton(&quot;.&quot;);
    buttonDec.addActionListener(decimalListener);
    panel.add(buttonDec);

    panel.add(buildNumberButton(0));

    // Exit button is to close the calculator and terminate the program.
    JButton buttonExit = new JButton(&quot;EXIT&quot;);
    buttonExit.setMnemonic(KeyEvent.VK_C);
    buttonExit.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {
        public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
            System.exit(0);
        }
    });
    panel.add(buttonExit);
    return panel;

}
&lt;/source&gt;}}
We want an even grid for the number keys and want them all to be sized the same so we use a &lt;code&gt;GridLayout&lt;/code&gt; as our LayoutManager. This grid is 4 rows deep and 3 columns wide. Building the operator panel and the clear panel are both done similarly.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Samantha1.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Cat blanket (originally intended to be a tablecloth until the cat explained things to the silly human).]]
My cat claims ownership of every piece of crochet I make, if she doesn't succeed in shredding it during construction.  So in order to pacify the little beast I tempt her away from the yarn balls with this blanket.  It's just her size, it's soft, and she can leave her scent all over it.  She especially enjoys it when it's laid on the carpet in a patch of sunlight.  I don't think it makes the carpet any softer, but she seems to enjoy owning the thing.

== Materials ==
*Cotton yarn in ecru and Navy blue (amount)
*4mm hook (U.S. size G)

== Construction ==
The body of this blanket is the important part and it's as easy as can be: one chain stitch, one double crochet.  Wash, rinse, repeat.  Work a half double stitch in a contrasting color around the border and do anything you like afterward.  I got a little fancy because I had been staring at a book of border patterns and decided to try designing something of my own.  So don't be afraid of the border design - it's really just sets of chain stitches and double crochet.  If the thing gets frustrating, do a simpler border.

== Instructions ==
Body:
*Row 1: Begin with ecru yarn.  Chain stitch 154 plus a 3 stitch turning chain.
*Row 2: double crochet, chain stitch.  Skip 1, then double crochet and chain stitch again.  Repeat.  At the end of the row make 2 double crochet stitches in succession.  Make a 3 stitch turning chain.
*Row 3: skip 1, double crochet wrapping around the previous chain, chain stitch.  Repeast.  At end of row make two double crochet stitches in succession; the second double crochet goes into the previous turning chain.  Then make a 3 stitch turning chain.
* Rows 4-72: as row 3.

Border: 
*Part 1: switch to Navy blue yarn.  Half double crochet around the entire edge.  Make 1 stitch into each stitch of the rows, 5 stitches into the loose loop at each corner, and 2 stitches into each row along the sides.
*Part 2: switch back to ecru yarn.  Double crochet 3, chain stitch 1; skip 1.  Repeat.  At corners double stitch 2 stitches into each of the 5 corner stitches from the previous row.  Complete 1 circle around the border this way.  Close the loop with with a flat stitch.
*Part 3: 
**Row motif: chain stitch 3, skip 2 and double crochet wrapping around the chain stitch from the previous row; chain stitch 2, double crochet a second stitch around the same chain stitch; make a picot of 4 chain stitches, close with a flat stitch; chain stitch 2, double crochet a third time around the same chain stitch, chain stitch 3, skip 3, single crochet around the chain stitch.  Chain stitch 3, skip 3 and double crochet wrapping around the chain stitch from the previous row; chain stitch 2, double crochet a second stitch around the same chain stitch; make a picot of 4 chain stitches, close with a flat stitch; chain stitch 2, double crochet a third time around the same chain stitch, chain stitch 3, skip 3, single crochet around the chain stitch.  Repeat to end of row.
**Corner motif: chain stitch 3, skip 1 and double crochet; make a picot of 5 chain stitches and close with a flat stitch, double crochet, chain stitch 3, skip 1 and single crochet.  Repeat.
**Resume row motif for the other 3 rows and corner motif for the other 3 corners.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This chapter explains the approach of a design on a system level. Therefore it’s necessary to introduce several system criteria, these differ from the technical design criteria because they aren’t reflected in the final design. The 4 system criteria discussed in this chapter are optimization, design space, robustness and human resources.
A list of specific technical design criteria for ECSs is discussed at the end of the chapter.

The inputs of a design team are the requirements. These aren’t predetermined but subject to change during the design process. The majority of the requirements state a minimum or maximum value and not a fixed one (i.e. weight must be below 1 kg, cost must be below €5, …). Therefore the requirements can be thought of as the boundaries of the design space.

Within this design space all feasible solutions exist. Of all these feasible solutions, the designer is interested in the most optimal one. Hence there is need for optimization. Some commonly used ways to achieve this are:
* Full optimization.
* Using [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/80-20_rule pareto principle]: 20% of the effort of the first method leads to 80% of its goals.
* Best effort method.
* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming Linear programming]
* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiobjective_optimization Multiobjective optimization]
* [[Embedded_Control_Systems_Design/Model_driven_engineering|Model Driven Engineering]]

Optimization of a design is complicated because:
* The coupled nature of the technical design criteria: A change in one criteria has an impact on (almost) every other criteria. Hence optimization must be done by simultaneously solving for every criteria, instead of optimizing every criteria apart, one by one.
* Design criteria aren’t always easy to represent as a numerical value (i.e. How do you define how easy to use an ECS is?)
* Uncertainties on the requirements and thus insecurities on the design space.

In an ideal case, all requirements are convertible into quantitavely expressed formal representations that the designer can then optimize. However in most real-life scenarios some of the requirements aren’t simply convertible to a numerical value and so the optimization of these requirements is not as straightforward as minimizing or maximizing a value.
The  computational cost of the optimization is thus not the only factor to be considered. The quantification of design criteria can be more critical and a relatively big uncertainty of this quantification is sometimes inevitable.

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robust Robustness] is an important aspect of a system or design. It differs from most design criteria because of the difficulty to quantify or measure it. A system or design is said to be robust when it’s able to deal with uncertainties and variations of its operational environment with minimal damage and loss of functionality.
Optimization and robustness can be seen as each others complement. Optimization makes sure that in the operational environment the system works optimal (i.e. minimum cost), robustness must ensure that if, for an unknown reason, the environment changes the system will minimize damage and loss of functionality.

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resource_management Human resources] is also a system level criteria for a design. The number of personnel that is put into a project determines the time frame of the design. Since this is highly linked with the design costs a good designer includes it in the optimization process.

In conclusion we can state that:
The designer always tries to find an optimal solution within the set of feasible solutions, called the design space. Before optimization techniques can be used, the design criteria must be quantified. This quantification can sometimes be difficult and good insight of the designer is a necessity.
A good design means it has a thoughtful balance between optimization, robustness and human resources.

Below follows a list of some specific technical design criteria for ECS along with links to examples throughout the wikibook.
* Reliability
** Examples are:
*** [[Embedded_Control_Systems_Design/Aviation#Flight_Control_System|Aviation - Flight control]]
*** Medical equipment
** Typical measures include:
*** [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redundancy_(engineering) Redundancy]
*** [[Embedded_Control_Systems_Design/Failure_modes_and_prevention|Safe failure modes: Failure modes and prevention]]
*** [[Embedded Systems/Watchdog Timer]]s
*** [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchdog_timer Watchdogs]
* Communication: remote servicing, ...
** Examples are:
*** [[Embedded_Control_Systems_Design/Aviation#Air_Traffic_Control|Aviation - Air traffic control]]
*** [[Embedded_Control_Systems_Design/Robotics/A_team_of_RoboCup_robots|Robotics - Robocup]]
*** [[Embedded_Control_Systems_Design/Automotive#AUTOSAR|Automotive - AutoSAR]]
** A trend in embedded control systems is increasing communication. Between ECS but also with users. A good example of this trend is the AutoSAR project for standardization of the interface between the ECS in a car.
** Remote servicing is also gaining in interest. The constant monitoring of the state of ECSs lead to extra knowledge of the machines. This knowledge can be used to improve the global process (i.e. in a oil refinery) and thus reduce cost.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This chapter will discuss issues around system complexity.

'''What is system complexity?'''

Before dealing with issues as categorising it is important to define the meaning of complexity. One could be tempted to say that the bigger the system, the more complex it is. Lets take a look at an example:

An electrician is about to wire two buildings. One is a small house, the other is an apartment building. Obviously, a lot more work will go into wiring the second and the fusebox of the latter will look more complex but the key idea is the same for both: Get the electricity to the light bulbs and plugs. The amount of plugs doesn’t matter. If you can do it for one, you can do it for a thousand. The scale is larger but the complexity is the same!

When looking at complexity this way it’s clear that complexity is not defined by scale (in this case: the amount of wires).

In this chapter complexity is defined by the number of [[w:Asynchronous systems|asynchronous subsystems]] and the amount of their different communication and synchronization needs: every exchange of information between two activities that run in parallel disturbs in one way or another both running processes, and the handling of this disturbance in a predictable way is not at all obvious. (These aspects are explained in more detail in the chapter on asynchronous activities.) When looking at it this way, both the house and apartment building will classify as a non-complex system because there’s only one system and no need for communication.

'''How to classify complexity?'''

A possible classification, using the definition above, is given here.

* '''Centralized hardware — Centralized Control (C1)''': in this kind of system all information is concentrated in one place. There’s no need for an operating system. These are systems that can be designed and developed by one or two engineers in a very small company, because the whole design and development can fit in one persons head.
* '''Distributed Hardware — Centralized Control (C2)''': these systems consist of several smaller systems. Each subsystem has its own control unit. But every subsystem communicates with the main computer which takes all the decisions for the system. These systems require a team of, say, a dozen engineers in a large company. Specialization is most often inevitable.
* '''Distributed Hardware — Distributed Control (C3)''': these systems also consist of several subsystems, but each system can take its own decisions, so there’s no need for a central main computer. These are the most complex '''systems-of-systems''' for which hundreds of developers have to work together, possibly in many different companies.

The goal of this classification is not to be exhaustive or complete, but to give technical project managers a first-order idea about complexity (and hence cost) of various embedded systems, and about the kind of technical and managerial challenges that can be expected for systems in each category.


==Centralized Hardware — Centralized Control==
Examples of this class are vending machines, [[w:elevator|elevator]] controllers, [[w:conveyor belt|conveyor belts]], traffic [[w:Automatic full barrier|barriers]], etc. A very important element in controlling these systems is a [[w:Programmable Logic Controller|Programmable Logic Controller]] (PLC). It is the traditional device behind the interfacing and the control of simple systems.

This class of embedded system (or rather, embedded ''device'') is characterized by the following:
* it has one single processor, often of the [[w:embedded processor|embedded]] type.
* all hardware peripherals are connected to the processor board via direct signal cables.
* interfacing the hardware can be done via [[w:memory-mapped IO|memory-mapped IO]].
* the software consists of one single thread, that executes the same program loop over and over again.
* so, it needs no operating system.
* the device is used for very well defined tasks in very well defined environments, that is, with little need for adaptation or variation.

==Distributed Hardware — Centralized Control==

A robot or machine tool controller is a typical representative of this
class.

This class of embedded system is characterized by the following:
* it has one single processor of the ''PC type'', with possibly several [[w:embedded processor|embedded processors]] in some of the hardware peripherals.
* some hardware peripherals are connected to the processor board via [[w:field bus|field busses]].
* interfacing of that type of hardware requires a software ''stack'' for the reception and sending of messages over the fieldbus, and for interpreting the content of the messages.
* some of the peripheral hardware uses [[w:interrupt|interrupts]].
* the software consists of multiple threads (sharing memory) or multiple processes (running in protected memory spaces), that each execute a program on their own, but that require synchronization and data exchange between each other.
* so, an operating system is required.
* the device has reprogrammability possibilities so that it can achieve various tasks in rather well defined environments.

==Distributed Hardware — Distributed Control==

A [[w:multi-agent|multi-agent]] system of robots, an [[w:Air traffic control|air traffic control system]], or an airport luggage handling system are typical representatives of this class.

This class of embedded system is characterized by the following:
* the total system consists of a software and communication layer around a number of sub-systems, each of which belongs to one of the previous classes in itself.
* each of the sub-systems often has multiple processors, of the [[w:embedded processor|embedded]] and of the ''PC type''.
* the sub-systems are communicating via various networking technologies, such as wired or wireless ethernet, radio communication, etc.
* the communication is typically asynchronous.
* the communication software requires extensive protocols that encode the knowledge to control the total system.
* some of the peripheral hardware uses [[w:interrupt|interrupts]].
* the software consists of multiple programs, of the [[w:service oriented architecture|service oriented architecture]] type.
* multiple operating systems can be used in the various subsystems.
* the overall system has extensive reprogrammability possibilities (up to replacing subsystems or their software on the fly) so that it can achieve various tasks in very different environments.

When designing this class of system there’s a strong need for model driven engineering. You need to be able to divide the system into subsystems and divide the functions because you’re working in different development teams. However at this point there are no adequate models available.

'''Dealing with complexity'''

When designing complex system several issues come up.

A key aspect of dealing with complexity is that the users of the system should not be confronted with the complexity of the system. This seems to be no problem as you could make the system function like a black box. Unfortunately, most systems need to be monitored. This proves to be a problem as the interface needs to be as simple as possible but still needs to give the right amount of information.

The accident at [[w:Three Mile Island accident|Three Mile Island]] illustrates the previous statement. One of the components of the Three Mile Island reactor stopped working, which lead to many other system components to shut down. Indicator lamps in the control room showed these problems and the operators were suddenly overwhelmed with information, much of it irrelevant or misleading. The operators incorrectly interpreted the indicators and were so confused that they made the wrong decisions, causing a partial core meltdown.

A possible way of dealing with this problem is monitoring functionality instead of components. Only when there’s something wrong with the functionality there’s a need of looking at the components.

The risk of failure increases with increasing complexity. More interaction leads to a greater risk of errors and a larger complexity complicates it for a user to see what’s wrong. There are three possible reactions to errors:

- Finding the error to prevent disaster

- Looking at what you should do first to repair the systems components

- Finding the design error that caused system failure

'''An example of complexity: The car'''

At first, a car was hardly more than an engine powered chariot. There were no [[w:Asynchronous systems|asynchronous subsystems]] involved nor was there decision making by computers. It’s clear that, when using the previous explained concepts, this type of vehicle ranks as a non-complex system of type 1. 

Over the years, the car has evolved a lot. Since the 80’s there’s a trend towards more computers in a car. There’s the ECU, the ABS and ESP units and even a computer regulating the air conditioning. These are all asynchronous subsystems making the car a system of type 3. (note that you can find arguments to declare the car a type 2 system.) 

What hasn’t really changed over the years is the user interface. There still is a steering wheel, a gearshift nob and some gauges showing coolant temperature, fuel level and oil pressure. This illustrates nicely that it is possible not to show the user the full complexity of the vehicle.

There’s also a possible fourth category of centralised hardware and distributed control. A modern car is hard to characterise as any of the systems above, but  it could be developing into this fourth system. A cars main computer needs to run several programs simultaneously. These programs don’t interact in any way.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want that the content of a selection list to depend on the value another selection list.  This is also known as &quot;Cascading Selection&quot;.

== Method ==
We have two instances in a model.  The first instance populates the first select1 list.  The second select1 uses an '''xf:itemset''' to only select the relevant items from the second instance.  In effect we are adding a &quot;where&quot; clause to the list of items selected in the second list.

The presented form shows an example where the user can select a season (Spring, Summer,...) and in a second select the user will only be able to select from the relevant month in that season.

We also will automatically set the month to null when the season selection changes to make sure our pairing is always valid.

The example had been tested with Firefox 2.0.0.12 and the Mozilla XForms add on 0.8.4 as well as on FireFox 3.0.

== Screen Image ==

== Link to XForms Application ==

[http://xforms-examples.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/03-dynamic-forms/03-dependent-selection/dependent-selection.xhtml Load Example XForms Application]

Note that the initial values of the selections are set in the instance values.

== Sample Program ==

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;

           &lt;/xf:action&gt;
         &lt;/xf:select1&gt;
         &lt;br/&gt;
         &lt;xf:select1 ref=&quot;instance('selected-values')/selected-month&quot;&gt;
           &lt;xf:label&gt;Month:&lt;/xf:label&gt;
           &lt;xf:itemset nodeset=&quot;instance('months')/item[@season=instance('selected-values')/selected-season]&quot;&gt;
             &lt;xf:label ref=&quot;@name&quot;/&gt;
             &lt;xf:value ref=&quot;@name&quot;/&gt;
           &lt;/xf:itemset&gt;
         &lt;/xf:select1&gt;
         &lt;br/&gt;
         &lt;xf:output ref=&quot;instance('selected-values')/selected-season&quot;&gt;
            &lt;xf:label&gt;selected-season: &lt;/xf:label&gt;
         &lt;/xf:output&gt;
		  &lt;br/&gt;

         &lt;xf:output ref=&quot;instance('selected-values')/selected-month&quot;&gt;
            &lt;xf:label&gt;selected-month: &lt;/xf:label&gt;
         &lt;/xf:output&gt;

         &lt;h4&gt;Relevant Months using Repeat&lt;/h4&gt;
	   &lt;xf:repeat nodeset=&quot;instance('months')/item[@season=instance('selected-values')/selected-season]&quot;&gt;
		   &lt;xf:output ref=&quot;@name&quot;/&gt;
	   &lt;/xf:repeat&gt;

   &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Updating the Second Select When the First Select Changes ==
Note that we have added an action and trap the '''xforms-value-changed''' event to the first select1 statement.
We use the '''xf:setvalue''' event to change the value of the second select1 to be blank.  This will guarantee that the pair of values will always be consistent.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;xf:select1&gt;
.....
     &lt;!-- As soon as you chance this value we set the month to be null --&gt;
     &lt;xf:action ev:event=&quot;xforms-value-changed&quot;&gt;
          &lt;xf:setvalue ref=&quot;instance('selected-values')/selected-month&quot; value=&quot;''&quot;/&gt;
     &lt;/xf:action&gt;
&lt;/xf:select1&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want to create a new file and automatically create a new identifier for the file.

== Method ==
Create an XML file with a single counter in it.  Use this counter as part of the file name.  After you confirm that the file has been saved, increment the counter using the update function.

=== Sample XML File to Hold Next ID ===
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;data&gt;
   &lt;next-id&gt;47&lt;/next-id&gt;
&lt;/data&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Sample Code for save-new.xq ==

The following example works with an incoming HTTP POST request.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;
declare namespace exist = &quot;http://exist.sourceforge.net/NS/exist&quot;;
declare namespace xmldb = &quot;http://exist-db.org/xquery/xmldb&quot;;
declare namespace request=&quot;http://exist-db.org/xquery/request&quot;;

declare option exist:serialize &quot;method=html media-type=text/html indent=yes&quot;;

(: save a new task - filename: save-new.xq - change base path if this changes. :)

(: this only works with POST data :)
let $my-doc := request:get-data()

(: the base directory URL for this XQuery.  Use this to put links in the result page. :)
let $base-path := substring-before(request:get-url(), '/save-new.xq')

(: these paths must start with '/db' and are used for passing to doc() :)
let $data-collection := '/db/app/data'
let $next-id-file-path := '/db/app/edit/next-id.xml'

let $next-id := doc($next-id-file-path)/data/next-id/text()

(: use this as an arugment for for store command :)
let $new-term-base-file-name := concat($next-id, '.xml')

(: use this for doc :)
let $new-term-file-path := concat($data-collection, '/', $new-term-base-file-name)

(: add this line for testing in your local system or if you don't have group or RBAC set up :)
let $login := xmldb:collection($data-collection, 'mylogin', 'mypassword')

(: store the new document in the given collction :)
let $store-return-status := xmldb:store($data-collection, $new-term-base-file-name, $my-doc)

(: increment the next-id by one for the next document.  You can also use &quot;update value&quot; :)
let $retCode1 := update replace doc($next-id-file-path)/data/next-id/text()
                        with ($next-id + 1)
(: note that next-id is now the next item so the current is next-id -1 :)

(: update the ID in the new document.  Note that the saved document must have
the ID in the path /app/id. :)
let $retCode2 :=  update replace doc($new-term-file-path)/app/id with &lt;id&gt;{$next-id - 1}&lt;/id&gt;

return
&lt;html xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
       &lt;title&gt;Save Confirmation&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
       &lt;h1&gt;New file has been saved. id={$next-id - 1}.&lt;/h1&gt;
   &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Taking into account concurrent access ==
''Same as above but with locking the node holding the identifier''.

The following example works with an incoming HTTP POST request.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;
declare namespace exist = &quot;http://exist.sourceforge.net/NS/exist&quot;;
declare namespace xmldb = &quot;http://exist-db.org/xquery/xmldb&quot;;
declare namespace request=&quot;http://exist-db.org/xquery/request&quot;;

declare option exist:serialize &quot;method=html media-type=text/html indent=yes&quot;;

(: save a new task - filename: save-new.xq - change base path if this changes. :)

(: this only works with POST data :)
let $my-doc := request:get-data()

(: the base directory URL for this XQuery.  Use this to put links in the result page. :)
let $base-path := substring-before(request:get-url(), '/save-new.xq')

(: these paths must start with '/db' and are used for passing to doc() :)
let $data-collection := '/db/app/data'
let $next-id-file-path := '/db/app/edit/next-id.xml'

(: Get next-id current value and increment the node value with an exclusive lock of the node :)
let $next-id := util:exclusive-lock(
    doc($next-id-file-path)/data/next-id,
    let $current-id := doc($next-id-file-path)/data/next-id/text()
    let $retCode := update replace doc($next-id-file-path)/data/next-id/text() with ($current-id + 1)
    return ($current-id - 1))                      
(: Warning - Pitfall : $current-id evaluation changes after the update :)

(: use this as an arugment for for store command :)
let $new-term-base-file-name := concat($next-id, '.xml')

(: use this for doc :)
let $new-term-file-path := concat($data-collection, '/', $new-term-base-file-name)

(: add this line for testing in your local system or if you don't have group or RBAC set up :)
let $login := xmldb:collection($data-collection, 'mylogin', 'mypassword')

(: store the new document in the given collction :)
let $store-return-status := xmldb:store($data-collection, $new-term-base-file-name, $my-doc)

(: update the ID in the new document.  Note that the saved document must have
the ID in the path /app/id. :)
let $retCode2 :=  update replace doc($new-term-file-path)/app/id with &lt;id&gt;{$next-id}&lt;/id&gt;

return
&lt;html xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
       &lt;title&gt;Save Confirmation&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
       &lt;h1&gt;New file has been saved. id={$next-id}.&lt;/h1&gt;
   &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
== Adding and Incrementing an Attribute ==

Note that the syntax for inserting an attribute is the following:

   update insert attribute {$attrName} {$attrValue} into expression

The keyword attribute must be used and be followed with the attribute name and value.

If you want to store a new id in an attribute the syntax is:

   update insert attribute {'id'} {$next-id} into $doc/root

''Note: if the &lt;code&gt;attribute&lt;/code&gt; already exists in the &lt;code&gt;target node&lt;/code&gt; then &lt;code&gt;insert&lt;/code&gt; works as &lt;code&gt;replace&lt;/code&gt;''

And if you are updating the id you can use the replace function with the @ in the path expression:

   update replace doc/root/@id with ($next-id + 1)

== [[Wikijunior:Famous Inventors]] ==

I understand this is a class project, and the students are fairly young. We still need you to be careful to make sure they don't simply copy text from other websites, as that would be a [[WB:COPYVIO|copyright violation]]. If you would like, we can [[WB:RFI|import]] pages from Wikipedia (this complies with the [[WB:GFDL|GFDL]]), and your students can simply take sections of those pages, and merge it into the book. Since they are quite young, I think this would be the best idea. If you make up a list of articles from Wikipedia you'd like to copy from and add it to [[WB:RFI]], we'll get them imported quickly for you. If you need help with anything else, don't hesitate to ask. I don't think we've ever had a class project working on a Wikijunior book, so this is pretty exciting! &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:57, 30 March 2008 (UTC)

'''Traffic Flow''' is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they make with one another.  Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior is something that cannot be predicted with one-hundred percent certainty.  Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonably consistent range and, thus, traffic streams tend to have some reasonable consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.  To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.  These relationships help in planning, design, and operations of roadway facilities.

==Traffic flow theory ==

===Time-Space Diagram===

[[Image:TimeSpaceDiagram.png|right|thumb|300px|Time-space diagram showing trajectories of vehicles over time and space]]

Traffic engineers represent the location of a specific vehicle at a certain time with a time-space diagram.  This two-dimensional diagram shows the trajectory of a vehicle through time as it moves from a specific origin to a specific destination.  Multiple vehicles can be represented on a diagram and, thus, certain characteristics, such as flow at a certain site for a certain time, can be determined.

=== Flow and Density ===

Flow (q) = the rate at which vehicles pass a fixed point (vehicles per hour) , &lt;math&gt;t_{measured}&lt;/math&gt; = Average measured time headway


&lt;math&gt;q = \frac{{3600N}}{t_{measured}} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Density (Concentration) (k) = number of vehicles (N) over a stretch of roadway (L) (in units of vehicles per kilometer) &lt;ref&gt; Note: We use k because the word is Konzentration in German &lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;k = \frac{N}{L}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where:
* &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; = number of vehicles occupying a highway segment of length &lt;math&gt; L &lt;/math&gt; 
* &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; = equivalent hourly flow
* &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; = length of roadway
* &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; = density

=== Speed ===

Measuring speed of traffic is not as obvious as it may seem; we can average the measurement of the speeds of individual vehicles over time or over space, and each produces slightly different results.

==== Time mean speed ====

Time mean speed (&lt;math&gt;\overline {v_t } \,\!&lt;/math&gt;) = arithmetic mean of speeds of vehicles passing a point

&lt;math&gt;\overline {v_t }  = \frac{1}{N}\sum\limits_{n = 1}^N {v_n }  \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

==== Space mean speed ====

Space mean speed (&lt;math&gt;\overline {v_s } \,\!&lt;/math&gt;) is defined as the harmonic mean of speeds passing a point during a period of time.  It also equals the average speeds over a length of roadway. 

&lt;math&gt;\overline {v_s }  = \frac{N}{{\sum\limits_{n = 1}^N {\frac{1}{{v_n }}} }} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

==== Relating time and space mean speed ====

Note that the time mean speed is average speed past a point as distinct from space mean speed which is average speed along a length.

The two speeds are related as

&lt;math&gt;\overline {v_t }  = \overline {v_s } + \frac{\sigma_s^2}{\overline {v_s }}  \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

As a rule of thumb time mean speed is about 2% more than space mean speed i.e.

&lt;math&gt;\overline {v_t } \approxeq 1.02 \overline {v_s } \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

=== Headway ===

==== Time headway ====

Time headway (&lt;math&gt;h_t\,\!&lt;/math&gt;) = difference between the time when the front of a vehicle arrives at a point on the highway and the time the front of the next vehicle arrives at the same point (in seconds)

Average Time Headway (&lt;math&gt;\overline {h_t } \,\!&lt;/math&gt;) = Average Travel Time per Unit Distance * Average Space Headway

&lt;math&gt;\overline {h_t }  = \overline t *\overline {h_s }  \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

==== Space headway ====

Space headway (&lt;math&gt;h_s&lt;/math&gt;) = difference in position between the front of a vehicle and the front of the next vehicle (in meters)

Average Space Headway (&lt;math&gt;\overline {h_s } \,\!&lt;/math&gt;)= Space Mean Speed * Average Time Headway

&lt;math&gt;\overline {h_s }  = \overline {v_s } *\overline {h_t }  \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Note that density and space headway are related:

&lt;math&gt;k = \frac{1}{{\overline {h_s } }} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

== Fundamental Diagram of Traffic Flow ==
[[Image:TraditionalTrafficFlowModel.png|right|thumb|300 px|Traditional fundamental diagram of traffic]]
[[Image:TriangularTrafficFlowModel.png|right|thumb|300 px|Flow varying by density on detector 688 (I-94 at 49th/53rd Avenue in Minneapolis) on November 1st 2000]]

The variables of flow, density, and space mean speed are related definitionally as:

&lt;math&gt;q = k\overline {v_s }  \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

=== Traditional Model (Parabolic) ===

Properties of the traditional fundamental diagram.

* When density on the highway is zero, the flow is also zero because there are no vehicles on the highway
* As density increases, flow increases
* When the density reaches a maximum jam density (&lt;math&gt;k_j&lt;/math&gt;), flow must be zero because vehicles will line up end to end
* Flow will also increase to a maximum value (&lt;math&gt;q_m&lt;/math&gt;), increases in density beyond that point result in reductions of flow.
* Speed is space mean speed.
* At density = 0, speed is freeflow (&lt;math&gt;v_f&lt;/math&gt;). The upper half of the flow curve is uncongested, the lower half is congested.
* The slope of the flow density curve gives speed.  Rise/Run = Flow/Density = Vehicles per hour/ Vehicles per km = km / hour. 

=== Observation (Triangular or Truncated Triangular) ===

Actual traffic data is often much noisier than idealized models suggest.  However, what we tend to see is that as density rises, speed is unchanged to a point (capacity) and then begins to drop if it is affected by downstream traffic (queue spillbacks). For a single link, the relationship between flow and density is thus more triangular than parabolic. When we aggregate multiple links together (e.g. a network), we see a more parabolic shape.

== Microscopic and Macroscopic Models ==
Models describing traffic flow can be classed into two categories: microscopic and macroscopic. Ideally, macroscopic models are aggregates of the behavior seen in microscopic models.

[[Image:TrafficPhases.png|thumb|right|300px|Traffic phases in a the microscopic fundamental diagram (truncated triangular)]] 
[[Image:QueueingIOPhases.png|thumb|right|300px|Traffic phases in the queueing cumulative input-output (Newell) diagram]]

=== Microscopic Models ===
Microscopic models predict the following behavior of cars (their change in speed and position) as a function of the behavior of the leading vehicle.

=== Macroscopic Models ===

Macroscopic traffic flow theory relates traffic flow, running speed, and density. Analogizing traffic to a stream, it has principally been developed for limited access roadways (Leutzbach 1988).   The fundamental relationship “q=kv” (flow (q) equals density (k) multiplied by speed (v)) is illustrated by the fundamental diagram.  Many empirical studies have quantified the component bivariate relationships (q vs. v, q vs. k, k vs. v), refining parameter estimates and functional forms  (Gerlough and Huber 1975, Pensaud and Hurdle 1991; Ross 1991; Hall, Hurdle and Banks 1992; Banks 1992; Gilchrist and Hall 1992; Disbro and Frame 1992).  

The most widely used model is the Greenshields model, which posited that the relationships between speed and density is linear. These were most appropriate before the advent of high-powered computers enabled the use of microscopic models. Macroscopic properties like flow and density are the product of individual (microscopic) decisions. Yet those microscopic decision-makers are affected by the environment around them, i.e. the macroscopic properties of traffic.

While traffic flow theorists represent traffic as if it were a fluid, queueing analysis essentially treats traffic as a set of discrete particles. These two representations are not-necessarily inconsistent. The figures to the right show the same 4 phases in the fundamental diagram and the queueing input-output diagram. This is discussed in more detail in the [[Fundamentals of Transportation/Queueing and Traffic Flow| next section]].

== Examples ==

===Example 1: Time-Mean and Space-Mean Speeds===

{{TProblem|
Given five observed velocities (60 km/hr, 35 km/hr, 45 km/hr, 20 km/hr, and 50 km/hr), what is the time-mean speed and space-mean speed?
}}

{{Answer|
Time-Mean Speed:

&lt;math&gt;\overline {v_t }  = \frac{1}{5}(60 + 35 + 45 + 20 + 50) = 42 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Space-Mean Speed:

&lt;math&gt;\overline {v_s }  = \frac{N}{{\sum\limits_{n = 1}^N {\frac{1}{{v_n }}} }} = \frac{5}{{\frac{1}{{60}}+\frac{1}{{35}}+\frac{1}{{45}}+\frac{1}{{20}}+\frac{1}{{50}}}} = 36.37\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The time-mean speed is 42 km/hr and the space-mean speed is 36.37 km/hr.
}}

===Example 2: Computing Traffic Flow Characteristics===

{{TProblem|
Given that 40 vehicles pass a given point in 1 minute and traverse a length of 1 kilometer, what is the flow, density, and time headway?
}}

{{Answer|
Compute flow and density:

&lt;math&gt;q = \frac{{3600(40)}}{60s} = 2400 veh/hr\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;k = \frac{40}{1} = 40 veh/km\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Find space-mean speed:

&lt;math&gt;q = k\overline {v_s } = 2400 = 40\overline {v_s }\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\overline {v_s } = 60 km/hr \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Compute space headway:

&lt;math&gt;k = 40 = \frac{1}{{\overline {h_s } }} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\overline {h_s } = 0.025km = 25m \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Compute time headway:

&lt;math&gt;\overline {h_s }  = \overline {v_s } *\overline {h_t } = 25 = (60*1000/3600)\overline {h_t }\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\overline {h_t } = 1.5s\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The time headway is 1.5 seconds.
}}

== Thought Question ==

'''Problem'''

Microscopic traffic flow simulates the behaviors of individual vehicles while macroscopic traffic flow simulates the behaviors of the traffic stream overall.  Conceptually, it would seem that microscopic traffic flow would be more accurate, as it would be based on driver behavior than simply flow characteristics.  Assuming microscopic simulation could be calibrated to truly account for driver behaviors, what is the primary drawback to simulating a large network?

'''Solution'''

Computer power.  To simulate a very large network with microscopic simulation, the number of vehicles that needed to be assessed is very large, requiring a lot of computer memory.  Current computers have issues doing very large microscopic networks in a timely fashion, but perhaps future advances will do away with this issue.

'''Flow '''

&lt;math&gt;
q = N\left( {\frac{{3600}}{{t_{measured} }}} \right) = 4\left( {\frac{{3600}}{{15}}} \right) = 960veh/hr
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

'''Density '''

&lt;math&gt;
k = \frac{N}{L} = \frac{4*1000}{{280}} = 14.2veh/km
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

'''Time Mean Speed '''

&lt;math&gt;
\overline {v_t }  = \frac{1}{N}\sum\limits_{n = 1}^N {v_n }  = \frac{1}{4}\left( {72 + 90 + 80 + 88} \right) = 82.5km/hr
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

'''Space Mean Speed '''

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{l}
 \overline {v_s }  = \frac{N}{{\sum\limits_{n = 1}^N {\frac{1}{{v_i }}} }} = \frac{4}{{\frac{1}{{72}} + \frac{1}{{90}} + \frac{1}{{80}} + \frac{1}{{88}}}} = 81.86 \\ 
 t_i  = L/v_i  \\ 
 t_A  = L/v_A  = 0.28/88 = 0.00318hr \\

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Shockwaves''' are byproducts of traffic congestion and queueing.  They are transition zones between two traffic states that move through a traffic environment like, as their name states, a propagating wave.  On the urban freeway, most drivers can identify them as a transition from a flowing, speedy state to a congested, standstill state.  However, shockwaves are also present in the opposite case, where drivers who are idle in traffic suddenly are able to accelerate.  Shockwaves are one of the major safety concerns for transportation agencies because the sudden change of conditions drivers experience as they pass through a shockwave often can cause accidents.

== Visualization ==

While most people have probably experienced plenty of traffic congestion first hand, it is useful to see it systematically from three different perspectives: (1) That of the driver (with which most people are familiar), (2) a birdseye view, and (3) a helicopter view. Some excellent simulations are available here, please see the movies:

[http://www.vwi.tu-dresden.de/~treiber/movie3d/index.html Visualization with the TU-Dresden 3D Traffic Simulator]

This movie shows traffic jams without an &quot;obvious source&quot; such as an on-ramp, but instead due to randomness in driver behavior: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Suugn-p5C1M Shockwave traffic jams recreated for first time]

== Analysis of shockwaves ==
[[Image:ShockwaveGraphic.png|right|thumb|300px|Shockwave Diagram]]
[[Image:ShockwaveGraphic02.png|right|thumb|300px|Shockwave Diagram]]
Shockwaves can be seen by the cascading of brake lights upstream along a highway.  They are often caused by a change in capacity on the roadways (a 4 lane road drops to 3), an incident, a traffic signal on an arterial, or a merge on freeway.  As seen above, just heavy traffic flow alone (flow above capacity) can also induce shockwaves. In general, it must be remembered that capacity is a function of drivers rather than just being a property of the roadway and environment. As the capacity (maximum flow) drops from &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt;, optimum density also changes.  
Speeds of the vehicles passing the bottleneck will of course be reduced, but the drop in speed will cascade upstream as following vehicles also have to decelerate.  

The figures illustrate the issues.  On the main road, far upstream of the bottleneck, traffic moves at density &lt;math&gt;k_1&lt;/math&gt;, below capacity (&lt;math&gt;k_{opt}&lt;/math&gt;).  At the bottleneck, density increases to accommodate most of the flow, but speed drops.

== Shockwave Math ==

=== Shockwave speed ===
If the flow rates in the two sections are &lt;math&gt;q_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q_2&lt;/math&gt;,  then &lt;math&gt;q_1=k_1 v_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q_2=k_2 v_2&lt;/math&gt;. 

&lt;math&gt;v_w  = \frac{{q_2  - q_1 }}{{k_2  - k_1 }} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

=== Relative speed ===
With &lt;math&gt;v_1&lt;/math&gt; equal to the space mean speed of vehicles in area 1, the speed relative to the line &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; is:

&lt;math&gt;v_{r1}  = v_1  - v_w  \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The speed of vehicles in area 2 relative to the line w is
&lt;math&gt;v_{r2}  = v_2  - v_w  \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

=== Boundary crossing ===

The number of vehicles crossing line 2 from area 1 during time period &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is

&lt;math&gt;N_1  = v_{r1} k_1 t = (v_1 - v_w) k_1 t\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

and similarly

&lt;math&gt;N_2  = v_{r2} k_2 t = (v_2 - v_w) k_2 t\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

By conservation of flow, the number of vehicles crossing from left equals the number that crossed on the right

&lt;math&gt;N_1=N_2	\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

so:

&lt;math&gt;v_2 k_2 - v_1 k_1 = v_w (k_2 - k_1 )\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

or

&lt;math&gt;q_2  - q_1 = v_w (k_2 - k_1 )\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

which is equivalent to 

&lt;math&gt;v_w  = \frac{{q_2  - q_1 }}{{k_2  - k_1 }} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

== Examples ==

===Example 1===

&lt;div style=&quot;background: ##aaaaaa; border: 4px solid #ffCC99; padding: 6pt; margin: 12pt 0.5em; width: -0.5em&quot;&gt;
[[Image:Evolution-tasks.png|40px|left|TProblem]]'''Problem:'''&lt;br&gt;
The traffic flow on a highway is &lt;math&gt;q_1= 2000  veh/hr &lt;/math&gt; with speed of &lt;math&gt;v_1=80 km/hr &lt;/math&gt;.  As the result of an accident, the road is blocked.  The density in the queue is &lt;math&gt;k_2 = 275 veh/km &lt;/math&gt;. (Jam density, vehicle length = 3.63 meters).

* (A) What is the wave speed (&lt;math&gt;v_w&lt;/math&gt;)?
* (B) What is the rate at which the queue grows, in units of vehicles per hour (&lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;)?
&lt;/div&gt;

{{Answer|
(A) At what rate does the queue increase?

1. Identify Unknowns:

&lt;math&gt;k_1 = q/ v_1 = 2000/80 = 25 veh/km \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;v_2 = 0, q_2 = k_2 v_2 = 0 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

2. Solve for wave speed (&lt;math&gt;v_w&lt;/math&gt;)

&lt;math&gt;
v_w  = \frac{{q_2  - q_1 }}{{k_2  - k_1 }} = \frac{{0 - 2000}}{{275 - 25}} =  - 8km/hr
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Conclusion: the queue grows against traffic

(B) What is the rate at which the queue grows, in units of vehicles per hour?

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{l}
 N_1  = \left( {v_1  - v_w } \right)k_1 t = \left( {v_2  - v_w } \right)k_2 t = N_2  \\ 
 dropping\quad t\;\left( {let\;t = 1} \right) \\ 
 v_1 k_1  - v_w k_1  = v_2 k_2  - v_w k_2  \\ 
 q_1  - v_w k_1  = q_2  - v_w k_2  \\ 
 2000 - ( - 8)*25 = 0 - ( - 8)*275 \\ 
 2200veh/hr = 2200veh/hr \\ 
 \end{array}
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
}}

== Thought Question ==

'''Problem'''

Shockwaves are generally something that transportation agencies would like to minimize on their respective corridor.  Shockwaves are considered a safety concern, as the transition of conditions can often lead to accidents, sometimes serious ones.  Generally, these transition zones are problems because of the inherent fallibility of human beings.  That is, people are not always giving full attention to the road around them, as they get distracted by a colorful billboard, screaming kids in the backseat, or a flashy sports car in the adjacent lanes.  If people were able to give full attention to the road, would these shockwaves still be causing accidents?

'''Solution'''

Yes, but not to the same extent.  While accidents caused by driver inattentiveness would decrease nearly to zero, accidents would still be occurring between different vehicle types.  For example, in a case where conditions change very dramatically, a small car (say, a Beetle) would be able to stop very quickly.  A semi truck, however, is a much heavier vehicle and would require a longer distance to stop.  If both were moving at the same speed when encountering the shockwave, the truck may not be able to stop in time before smashing into the vehicle ahead of them.  That is why most trucks are seen creeping along through traffic with very big gaps ahead of them.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===== atol =====

{{C++ Programming/Syntax|
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;
long atol( const char *str );
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

The function atol() converts ''str'' into a long, then returns that value. atol() will read from ''str'' until it finds any character that should not be in a long. The resulting truncated value is then converted and returned. For example,

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
x = atol( &quot;1024.0001&quot; ); 
&lt;/source&gt;

results in x being set to 1024L.

{{Answer |
''' Step 0 '''

Solve for Unknowns:

Original speed

&lt;math&gt;
v_1=\frac{q_1}{k_1}=\frac{1800}{14.4} = 125 km/h
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Flow after police cruiser joins

&lt;math&gt;
q_2= k_2 v_2 = 88*20 = 1760 veh/h
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

''' Step 1 '''

Calculate the wave velocity:

&lt;math&gt;
v_w  = \frac{{q_2  - q_1 }}{{k_2  - k_1 }} = \frac{{1760 - 1800}}{{20 - 14.4}} =  - 7.14km/hr
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

''' Step 2 '''

Determine the growth rate of the platoon (relative speed)

&lt;math&gt;
v_{r2}  = v_2  - v_w  = 88 - ( - 7.14) = 95.1km/hr
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

''' Step 3 '''

Determine the time spent by the police cruiser on the highway

&lt;math&gt;
t = d/v = 10 km / 88 km/hr  = 0.11 hr = 6.8 minutes
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

''' Step 4 '''

Calculate the Length of platoon (not a standing queue)

&lt;math&gt;
L = v t = 95.1 km/hr * 0.11 hr = 10.46 km
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

''' Step 5 '''

What is the rate at which the queue grows, in units of vehicles per hour?

&lt;math&gt;
\Delta{q} = q_1 - k_1 v_w = q_2 - k_2 v_w = 1800 - (14.4*-7.14) = 1760- (20*-7.14) = 1902 veh/hr
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

''' Step 6 '''

The number of vehicles in platoon 

&lt;math&gt;
L_p k_2 = 10.46 km * 20 veh/km = 209.2 vehicles 
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

OR

&lt;math&gt;
\Delta{q}  t = 1902 veh/hr*0.11hr=209.2veh
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

'''How long will it take for the queue to dissipate?'''

(a) Where does the shockwave go after the police cruiser leaves? Just reverse everything?


&lt;math&gt;{{v}_{w}}=\frac{{{q}_{2}}-{{q}_{1}}}{{{k}_{2}}-{{k}_{1}}}=\frac{1800-1760}{14.4-20}=-7.14km/hr&lt;/math&gt;

Second wave never catches first.

(b) Return speed to 125, keep density @ 20?
&lt;math&gt;q_2 = 20*125=2500
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;{{v}_{w}}=\frac{{{q}_{2}}-{{q}_{1}}}{{{k}_{2}}-{{k}_{1}}}=\frac{2500-1760}{20-20}=\infty km/hr&lt;/math&gt;

Second wave instantaneously catches first

(c) Return speed to 125, keep density @ halfway between 14.4 and 20?
&lt;math&gt;q_2 = 20*125=2500
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;{{v}_{w}}=\frac{{{q}_{2}}-{{q}_{1}}}{{{k}_{2}}-{{k}_{1}}}=\frac{2150-1760}{17.2-20}=139km/hr&lt;/math&gt;

Second wave quickly catches first


&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  &amp; 139*t=7.14*\left( .11+t \right) \\ 
 &amp; \left( 139-7.14 \right)t=7.14*11 \\ 
 &amp; t=0.006h=.35\min =21\sec  \\ 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

(d) Drop upstream q,k to slow down formation curve.


&lt;math&gt;{{v}_{w}}=\frac{{{q}_{2}}-{{q}_{1}}}{{{k}_{2}}-{{k}_{1}}}=\frac{1780-1760}{14.24-20}=-3.47km/hr&lt;/math&gt;

Second wave eventually catches first

(e) If &lt;math&gt;q_{upstream}&lt;/math&gt; falls below downstream capacity, wave dissipates


&lt;math&gt;{{v}_{w}}=\frac{{{q}_{2}}-{{q}_{1}}}{{{k}_{2}}-{{k}_{1}}}=\frac{1250-1760}{10-20}=+51km/hr&lt;/math&gt;

Forward moving wave.

      <comment>Suggestion to extend the word &quot;innovation&quot; and to include CSI research.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">If you wish to include Gabriel Tarde as an initiator of the diffusion of innovation paradigm, then I guess it should be made clear that &quot;innovation&quot; is understood here in a very broad sense, and not only in terms of technology.

I am also surprised to see no reference to the Centre de sociologie de l'innovation of the École des mines (Michel Callon, Madeleine Akrich, Bruno Latour, and the whole &quot;french connection&quot;).

I'll work on this when I have some time, if no one wants to take it over. --[[User:Niccoben|Niccoben]] ([[User talk:Niccoben|talk]]) 18:55, 6 March 2008 (UTC)</text>

I heard from Jim that you are interested in working on the [[Digital Signal Processing]] and possibly the [[Signals and Systems]] books? I created both of those books back when I was still an undergrad, and haven't had the time to maintain them, much less improve them. I'm sure there are a lot of errors to be found, some that were typos on my part, or misunderstandings from back when I was less educated. These things are always a little funny in hindsight!

      <comment>/* Uncapacitated Queues (M/D/1) and (M/M/1) */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image: Queue_System.PNG|thumb|450 px|A Schematic of a Queue System]]

'''Queueing'''&lt;ref&gt;A Note on Linguistics: American English tends to use “Queueing” (getting 302,000 Google hits), while British English uses “Queuing” (getting 429,000 Google hits) 

Queueing is the only common English word with 5 vowels in a row. 

It has been posited: Cooeeing - To call out “cooee,” which is apparently something done in Australia.

The uncommon word: archaeoaeolotropic has 6 vowels - a prehistorical item that is unequally elastic in different directions - One suspects it is just made up to have a word with 6 vowels in a row though, and the “ae” is questionable anyway.
&lt;/ref&gt;
is the study of traffic behavior near a certain section where demand exceeds available capacity.  Queues can be seen in many common situations:  boarding a bus or train or plane, freeway bottlenecks, shopping checkout, exiting a doorway at the end of class, waiting for a computer in the lab, a hamburger at McDonald’s, or a haircut at the barber.  In transportation engineering, queueing can occur at red lights, stop signs, bottlenecks, or any design-based or traffic-based flow constriction.  When not dealt with properly, queues can result in severe network congestion or &quot;gridlock&quot; conditions, therefore making them something important to be studied and understood by engineers.

== Cumulative Input-Output Diagram (Newell Curve) ==

[[Image:QueueingIO.png|right|500px|thumb|Newell Curve showing the cumulative inputs and outputs from a queue]]

Based on the departure rate and arrival rate pair data, the delay of every individual vehicle can be obtained.  Using the input-output (I/O) queueing diagram shown in the side figure, it is possible to find the delay for every individual vehicle: the delay of the &lt;math&gt;i^{th}&lt;/math&gt; vehicle is time of departure - time of arrival (&lt;math&gt;t_2-t_1&lt;/math&gt;).
Total delay is  the sum of the delays of each vehicle, which is the area in the triangle between the arrival (''A(t)'') and departure (''D(t)'') curves.

== Distributions ==

Arrival Distribution - Deterministic (uniform) OR Random (e.g. Poisson)

Service Distribution - Deterministic OR Random

Service Method: 
* First Come First Served (FCFS) or First In First Out (FIFO)
* Last Come First Served (LCFS) or Last In First Out (LIFO)
* Priority (e.g. HOV bypasses at ramp meters)

== Characterizing Queues ==

Queue Length Characteristics - Finite or Infinite

Number of Channels - Number of Waiting Lines (e.g. Ramps = 2, Supermarket = 12)

We use the following notation:
*Arrival Rate = &lt;math&gt;   \lambda &lt;/math&gt;
*Departure Rate = &lt;math&gt; \mu &lt;/math&gt;

Utilization Rate  &lt;math&gt; \rho  = \frac{\lambda }{\mu }\,\!  &lt;/math&gt;

=== Degree of Saturation ===

Oversaturated: &lt;math&gt; \lambda &gt; \mu &lt;/math&gt;

Undersaturated &lt;math&gt; \lambda &lt; \mu &lt;/math&gt;

Saturated &lt;math&gt; \lambda = \mu &lt;/math&gt;

== Little's Formula ==

[[Image: Traffic Congestion Brasilia.jpg|thumb|200 px|A Traffic Queue]]

Little's Formula: &lt;math&gt;E(n)= \lambda E(v) &lt;/math&gt;

This means that the average queue size (measured in vehicles) equals the arrival rate (vehicles per unit time) multiplied by the average waiting time (both delay time in queue plus service time) (in units of time). This result is independent of particular arrival distributions and, while perhaps obvious, is an important fundamental principle that was not proven until 1961.

''See [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little's_Law Wikipedia article] for more applications.''

== Uncapacitated Queues (M/D/1) and (M/M/1) ==
[[Image: StochasticQueueingQueueLength.png|thumb|200 px|Stochastic Queueing Queue Length.png]]
[[Image: ComparisonOfStochasticAndDeterministicQueueingAndBPR.png|thumb|200 px|Comparison Of Stochastic And Deterministic Queueing And BPR.]]
[[Image: ComparisonOfStochasticQueueingWithBPRAndAkcelikFormula.png|thumb|200 px|Comparison Of Stochastic Queueing With BPR And Akcelik Formula.]]
It has been shown that queue sizes, waiting times, and delays differ between M/D/1 and M/M/1 queueing.  These differences are represented in formulas and shown below.  Note the minor differences between the two.

|-
| E(v) (average total delay)||&lt;math&gt;E(v) = \frac{{2 - \rho }}{{2\mu \left( {1 - \rho } \right)}}\,\! &lt;/math&gt;||&lt;math&gt;E(v) = \frac{1}{{\left( {\mu  - \lambda } \right)}} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| E(n) (expected number of units in the system (including vehicles being served))||&lt;math&gt;E(n) = \frac{{(2 - \rho ) \rho}}{{2(1 - \rho) }} \,\!&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;E(n) = \frac{{\rho }}{{1 - \rho }} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;


|}

Notes:
* Average wait time (E(w)) excludes service time.
* Average total delay (E(v))  is (wait time + service time). This is sometimes referred to ''average delay time'' due to the existence of the bottleneck.
* Expected number of units in the system (E(n)) includes customers currently being served (in number of units). According to Little's Law this  is arrival rate multiplied by the average time spent in the system &lt;math&gt;E(n)=\lambda * E(v)&lt;/math&gt;. 
* Sometimes Expected number of units in the queue (E(m)) is requested, excluding customers being served, which is a different formula ( arrival rate multiplied by the average waiting time &lt;math&gt;E(m)=\lambda * E(w)&lt;/math&gt;), and obviously results in a small number.

== Uncapacitated queues (M/M/1) (random arrival and random service) ==

In addition to the properties stated before, M/M/1 queueing have a few additional ones of which to take note.

[[File:WaitingTime.xlsx.png|thumb|How waiting time varies with capacity utilization]]

== Capacitated Queues (Finite) ==

Capacitated queues permit a maximum number of vehicles to wait, and thus have different properties than uncapacitated queues.
For single channel undersaturated finite queues where the maximum number of units in system is specified as &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; and with random arrivals and departures (&lt;math&gt;\lambda ,\mu&lt;/math&gt;) we have:

==Examples==

=== Example 1 ===

&lt;div style=&quot;background: ##aaaaaa; border: 4px solid #ffCC99; padding: 6pt; margin: 12pt 0.5em; width: -0.5em&quot;&gt;
[[Image:Evolution-tasks.png|40px|left|TProblem]]'''Problem:'''&lt;br&gt;

At the Krusty-Burger, if the arrival rate is 1 customer every minute and the service rate is 1 customer every 45 seconds, find the average queue size, the average waiting time, and average total delay. Assume an M/M/1 process.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;background: ##aaaaaa; border: 4px solid #02D4EE; padding: 6pt; margin: 12pt 0.5em; width: -0.5em&quot;&gt;
[[Image:Evolution-tasks.png|40px|left|Example]]'''Solution:'''&lt;br&gt;

To proceed, we convert everything to minutes.

Service time:


&lt;math&gt;
{{45/60}} =  0.75 minutes 
\,\!&lt;/math&gt; per customer. Alternatively, you can say the server can handle 60/45 = 1/0.75 = 1.33 customers per minute.

The arrival rate is 1 customer per minute.

The utilization rate &lt;math&gt;\rho =  (60/60) / (60/45) = 0.75 &lt;/math&gt; Meaning the server is busy on average 75% of the time. 

Average queue size (E(n)):

&lt;math&gt;
E(n) = \frac{{\rho }}{{1 - \rho }} = \frac{{0.75}}{{(1 - 0.75)}} = 3
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;E(n)= \lambda E(v) = 1 * 3.00 &lt;/math&gt; Little's Formula

Average wait time:

&lt;math&gt;
 E(w) = \frac{\lambda }{{\mu \left( {\mu  - \lambda } \right)}} = \frac{1}{{1.33\left( {1.33 - 1} \right)}} = 2.25 
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Average delay time:

&lt;math&gt;
 E(v) = \frac{1}{{\left( {\mu  - \lambda } \right)}} = \frac{1}{{\left( {1.33 - 1} \right)}} = 3 = E(w) + servicetime = 2.25 + 0.75 
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Comparison:

We can compute the same results using the M/D/1 equations, the results are shown in the Table below.

{| {{table}}
|+ Comparison of M/D/1 and M/M/1 queue properties
! align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#f0f0f0;&quot;|''''''
! align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#f0f0f0;&quot;|'''M/D/1'''
! align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#f0f0f0;&quot;|'''M/M/1'''
|-
| E(n) (average queue size (#))||1.875||3
|-
| E(w) (average waiting time)||1.125||2.25
|-
| E(v) (average total delay)||1.875||3
|}

As can be seen, the delay associated with the more random case (M/M/1, which has both random arrivals and random service) is greater than the less random case (M/D/1), which is to be expected.

&lt;/div&gt;

=== Example 2 ===

{{TProblem|
How likely was it that Homer  got his pile of hamburgers in less than 1, 2, or 3 minutes?
}}

{{Answer|
&lt;math&gt;

\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
P\left( {t \le 2} \right) = 1 - e^{ - \left( {1 - \rho } \right)\mu T}  = 1 - e^{ - \left( {1 - 0.75} \right)1.333*2}  = 1 - e^{ - 0.667}=0.487
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
P\left( {t \le 3} \right) = 1 - e^{ - \left( {1 - \rho } \right)\mu T}  = 1 - e^{ - \left( {1 - 0.75} \right)1.333*3}  = 1 - e^{ - 1}=0.631
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
}}

=== Example 3 ===

&lt;math&gt;
P\left( {w \le 3} \right) = 1 - \rho e^{ - \left( {1 - \rho } \right)\mu T}  = 1 - 0.75e^{ - \left( {1 - 0.75} \right)1.333*3} 
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
P\left( {w &gt; 3} \right) = 1 - P\left( {w \le 3} \right)
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
}}

=== Example 4 ===

{{TProblem|

}}

==Thought Question==

'''Problem'''

How does one minimize wait time at a queue?

'''Solution'''

Cutting in line always helps, but this problem will be answered without breaking any rules.  Think about going out to dinner, only to find a long line at your favorite restaurant.  How do you deal with that?  Maybe nothing can be done at that time, but the next time you go to that restaurant, you might pick a new time.  Perhaps an earlier one to avoid the lunch or dinner rush.  Similar decisions can be seen in traffic.  People that are tired of being in network queues on their way to work may attempt to leave earlier or (if possible) later than rush hour to decrease their own travel time.  This typically works well until all the other drivers figure out the same thing and shift congestion to a different time.

==External Exercises==

The assignment seeks to provide students with the opportunity to gain a better understanding of two queuing theories: M/D/1 and M/M/1.  Two preformatted spreadsheets have been made available for assistance in computing the values sought after in this exercise.  While these spreadsheets provide the computations for these results, the formula is listed below for reference:

&lt;math&gt;WT_q = (\frac{{C^2_\lambda + C^2_\mu}}{{2C^2_\lambda}})(\frac{{\rho}}{{1-\rho}})\frac{{1}}{{\mu}}
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
* &lt;math&gt;WT_q\,\!&lt;/math&gt;: Average customer delay in the queue
* &lt;math&gt;C_\lambda\,\!&lt;/math&gt;: Coefficient of variation (CV) of the arrival distribution
* &lt;math&gt;C_\mu\,\!&lt;/math&gt;: Coefficient of variation of the departure distribution
* &lt;math&gt;CV\,\!&lt;/math&gt;: Standard deviation/mean; CV = (1/SqRt (mean)) for Poisson process and CV = 0 for constant distribution
* &lt;math&gt;\mu\,\!&lt;/math&gt;: Average departure rate
* &lt;math&gt;\lambda\,\!&lt;/math&gt;: Average arrival rate
* &lt;math&gt;\rho\,\!&lt;/math&gt;: Utilization = Arrival rate/service rate &lt;math&gt;(\rho = \lambda / \mu)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

'''M/D/1 Queueing'''

Download the file for M/D/1 Queueing from the University of Minnesota's STREET website: [http://street.umn.edu/FOT/MD1Queue.xls M/D/1 Queue Spreadsheet]

With this spreadsheet, run 5 simulations for each of the 10 scenarios, using the arrival and departure information listed in the table below.  In other words, program the same data into the spreadsheet 5 different times to capture a changing seed and, thus, produce slightly different answers because of the model's sensitivity.  A total of 50 simulations will be run.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

|-
! Scenario

|-
| Service Rate || 0.5 || 0.5 || 0.5 || 0.5 || 0.5 || 0.5 || 0.5 || 0.5 || 0.5 || 0.5
|}

Also, find the utilization for all ten scenarios. Based on the utilization and the distribution variability, use the above equation to compute the average delays for all scenarios with utilization values of less than 1.

Finally, summarize the average-delays obtained both from the simulation and from the WTq equation in the same delay-utilization plot. Interpret your results.  How does the average user delay change as utilization increases? Does the above equation provide a satisfactory approximation of the average delays?

'''M/M/1 Queueing'''

Download the file for M/M/1 Queueing from the University of Minnesota's STREET website: [http://street.umn.edu/FOT/MM1Queue.xls M/M/1 Queue Spreadsheet]

With this spreadsheet, run 5 simulations for each of the 10 scenarios, using the arrival and departure information listed in the table below.  In other words, program the same data into the spreadsheet 5 different times to capture a changing seed and, thus, produce slightly different answers because of the model's sensitivity.

|-
| Service Rate || 0.5 || 0.5 || 0.5 || 0.5 || 0.5 || 0.5 || 0.5 || 0.5 || 0.5 || 0.5
|}

Again, you need to use five different random seeds for each scenario.  Summarize the results in a delay-utilization plot. Interpret your results (You do NOT need to use the WTq equation given above to compute delays for the M/M/1 queue).

'''Additional Questions'''

* Finally compare the M/M/1 queue and the M/D/1 queue. What conclusion can you draw? (For the same average arrival rate, do users experience the same delays in the two queuing systems? Why or why not?).
* Provide a brief example where M/M/1 might be the appropriate model to use.
* Provide a brief example where M/D/1 might be the appropriate model to use.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This example shows how to experimentally measure the response of the infrared sensors in proximity mode. The robot starts right in front of an obstacle and then moves backwards in small steps. After each step, a series of infrared proximity measurements are taken.

== Setup ==

Boot a Khepera III robot and make sure it is [[Khepera III Toolbox/Network Setup|connected]] to your computer via WLAN. In the following explanation, we assume that you are working with robot 203. Put the robot in front of an obstacle and make sure that there is at least 50 cm space behind it.

Copy the ''motor_initialize'', ''motor_stop'' and ''infrared_proximity'' programs onto the robot
 cd Programs
 k3put +203 motor_initialize motor_stop infrared_proximity
Log on to the robot
 k3go +203
and type
 cd your_username
 ./motor_initialize
to initialize the motors. 

To check if everything is working, type
 ./infrared_proximity
If your robot touches the obstacle in front of it, you should get results like this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
$IRPROXIMITY,0,44038,41,11,405,3963,3965,827,3,61,34,3108,3010
&lt;/source&gt;
The two highest values in the middle (3963 and 3965) belong to the front sensors and are those which we actually use in this experiment. These values may differ in your setup, since they are heavily influenced by the color and texture of your obstacle. Don't worry if you get values around 3000.

== Running the Experiment ==

Position the robot right in front of your obstacle (such that it touches the obstacle) and launch
 ./run.pl
The robot will now move backwards in small steps and take 10 infrared measurements which are stored in a file called ''run_results'' in the same folder. A complete run will take about 2 min, and the robot will stay at its place afterwards.

== Parsing the Result File ==

Type the following line to process the result file
 ./parse_results.pl 5 &lt; run_results &gt; matlab_run_results_5
 ./parse_results.pl 6 &lt; run_results &gt; matlab_run_results_6

Sensors 5 and 6 are the two front sensors. You could - in a similar fashion - take measurements with the other sensors as well.

== Plotting the Result in Matlab ==

Launch Matlab and type
 plot_results
The resulting diagram will show a curve for both sensors. Each point is an average of 10 samples.

== Notes ==

The infrared proximity sensor values decrease exponentially with distance. Depending on the color and shape of your obstacle, however, the curve can be significantly shifted. This is especially true for very dark obstacles (limited reflection), or thin obstacles (limited reflection surface). Be aware that the floor will have an influence for distances above 5 cm as well, as part of the emitted IR light is reflected there. Furthermore, a significant amount of ambient IR light (e.g. daylight on a sunny day) will also impact on the results.

In the folder of this example, you will find the two files ''ir_proximity_reponse_blackfloor.txt'' and ''ir_proximity_reponse_blackfloor.eps''. These are measurements taken on a dark (dark grey) floor (low reflection) in front of a white wall (high reflection) in a room with low ambient IR light.

== Human components ==
=== The creator(s) ===
Game creators are by definition artists, since they produce creative works with no utilitarian use, that at is most restricted form the concept of art. Of course that video games go above art and have a particularity, most components are modular (by design or by characteristics), for instance games may have music, a history and even the visuals may be considered artistic creations, since that are made functional by the aggregate.

Most video games share characteristics with other video creations, like cinema (film art) in a similar way as it relates to theater. The image angles, story telling concepts can literally be transposed to the video game medium with the added benefit of interactivity. In fact it is defended by many that there is a tendency of a merge between the two mediums. As an example we could point to how movie sound and 3D has evolved and to tests of interactive movies, where the audience selects the outcome of actions. 

Often the video game creator label is not restricted only the one that creates the game concept, but also those that implement that vision, since most of the times there are technical constrains that must be dealt with or haphazard improvements that are made to the original creator plan. Most video games today are collaborative works involving not only a large number of people but a large number of resources and technical knowhow. There are people involved with composing music, working with sound, programming, testing, art, graphics, and much, much more. 

Famous game creators:
*[[w:Bullfrog Productions|Bullfrog Productions]], the creators of many revolutionary games, for instance [[w:Populous|Populous]] or [[w:Syndicate (video game)|Syndicate]].
*'''Psygnosis''' (now [[w:SCE Studio Liverpool|SCE Studio Liverpool]] part of [[w:SCE Worldwide Studios|Sony Computer Entertainment Worldwide Studios]]), the creators of many innovative games like [[w:Shadow of the Beast|Shadow of the Beast]], [[w:Lemmings (video game)|Lemmings]] and [[w:Wipeout (video game)|Wipeout]].

{{TODO|Continue adding}}

=== The designer(s) ===
A video game is a collaboration of many different types of media and art, and requires many skilled people to put together. But before going on, it is important to note that there is a difference between people who are involved in creating a game, game creators and a game designer. A game designer is the person who works with a game's core concepts, its level design, and various other aspects of the overall ideas of the game. Sometimes the functions are mixed and there is some benefits in that but in the video game field the game designer can get reputation and recognition for the game, while the game creator will at best be recognized by the specific aspects of the game he directly worked on, more often creators get a joint recognition as a software house for the work on a specific game.

Famous game designers &lt;small&gt;(in no particular order)&lt;/small&gt;:
*[[w:Shigeru Miyamoto|Shigeru Miyamoto]], the designer, creator and producer of the Nintendo's Zelda and Mario franchises among other works.
*[[w:Sid Meier|Sid Meier]], the designer, creator of several popular computer strategy games, most notably [[w:Civilization (video game)|Civilization]].
*[[w:Peter Molyneux|Peter Molyneux]], created the [[w:god game|god game]]s [[w:Dungeon Keeper|Dungeon Keeper]], [[w:Populous|Populous]], and [[W:Black &amp; White (game)|Black &amp; White]], among others, as well as [[w:business simulation game|business simulation game]]s such as [[w:Theme Park (computer game)|Theme Park]] and the RPG series [[w:Fable (video game series)|Fable]].
*[[w:David Braben|David Braben]], creator [[w:Elite (video game)|Elite]] with [[w:Ian Bell (programmer)|Ian Bell]], a hugely popular and influential [[w:space trading|space trading]] computer game, in the early 1980s. He was also the creator of [[w:Zarch|Zarch]] (also known under its ported name of '''Virus''').

{{TODO|Continue adding and mine [[w:Video game designer]]}}

=== The player(s) ===
The player is the person who plays a video game. They are the customer, and the focus of the video game industry.

62% of players are male, and the average age of the player is 37. These are important factors to consider for game designers when creating a game, because you create a game ''for'' these people, and it must be interesting and fun for them.

This does not mean you should ignore the other sector of players though. 31% of players are under the age of 18, and 25% of players are over the age of 50. This means that about $3,920,000,000 of that 7 Billion come from the players under 18 and over 50.

==== Interaction ====
While the computer is only capable of communicating to a limited number of senses (vision, audio and recently tactile), there is a great part of the communication in the player, this has shaped recent advances like reading and interact with the player body movement or even reading players thoughts through [[w:Mind mental|mind mental]] interfaces.

Here is how it works: the player observes the output of the video game and processes it in the ''mind''. Then if any of what is processed is significant there may be an [[w:Emotion|emotional]] response to this. If this happens then the player will become wholly involved in the video game experience - and it is then that a video game goes from pixels and sound waves to an [[w:epic|epic]] experience.

===== Multi-player =====
[[w:Multiplayer|Multi-player]] games is where players interact with one another through the video game's interface.

====== Network ======
A network is sort of both input and output - communication with other people and computers. Allows for a nearly limitless input ability.

== Software/Hardware components ==
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software Software] is what the game is. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_hardware Hardware] is what the software, or game, runs on. Hardware is anything you can physically touch on your computer.

=== Hardware ===
Some examples of hardware would be a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_card sound card], or a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_card graphics card].

==== Consoles vs. Computers ====
There is a big difference between a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer computer] and a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_console video game console].

A video game console is designed solely for video games, and because of this they usually run a lot smoother. The controls of consoles are the video game ''controller''. But the console has its limits, whatever is in the console, is in the console, and this means that the designers may or may not implement on-line functions, customization, updates, etc. But in most cases, the graphical, auditory, and computational capabilities of a console are its limit.

A computer on the other hand, has lots of things going on inside it - whether you like it or not. This can often (but not always) slow down and hinder game-play. But, in opposition to the video game console, the computer has almost unlimited possibilities for everything. The hardware can be exchanged for better hardware to make games run faster and smoother. However, unlike the console, the computer does not essentially use the dynamic control interface - often making game-play uncomfortable. This is only true for some games. In fact, some games are generally better suited to the use of the keyboard and mouse interface, such as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMO Massively Multi-player] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_strategy Real-time Strategy] games.

==== Rise of WEB gaming ====

==== Portable devices ====

==== Input Devices (Controllers) ====
The form of input is the only way the player can interact with the game. In the ideal universe it would be nice if the player could just think what they wanted to happen, but this - however - is not yet possible.

So, when designing a game you must consider very carefully the type of input you use. You must consider the '''limitations''' of the input device, how easy it is to use, and how the user will be using it. Listed in this section are the various types of input devices.

Every [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_controller Controller] is different, however most controllers have an analog stick, a d-pad, and some buttons. Often times, these controllers are designed to fit the needs of games. Being designed exclusively for games, they are usually much more effective than other input devices.

===== Keyboard/Buttons =====
The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphanumeric_keyboard keyboard] is an interesting game input device, it has a vast selection of buttons, surpassing nearly all the other devices - granting a greater immersion through a larger choice of possible inputs sometimes at the cost of increased complexity. A disadvantage of the keyboard is that not present in all game devices by default (even unavailable at times), it is also too cumbersome for portable devices or limited in its implementation on/for them.

===== Joysticks =====
The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joystick Joystick] started as an analog directional axis controller with a few buttons. Today it can also be a completely digital interface. It's gained popularity as a general propose controller for the first consoles or arcade machines. The joystick is not as sensitive as a mouse or a trackball but permits a greater freedom of use (space or surface) and on the personal computer it was made popular over the keyboard as a vehicle controller specially for airplane simulators. Today the joystick has lost some of its popularity and was replaced in most consoles by a default keypad and simulator-specific controller for driving cars, planes, or other things.

===== Mouse =====
Quickly able to move anywhere in the game environment, button action limited. The mouse grants the user a greater control over accuracy and precision than the typical joystick. However, generic mice have a very limited amount of input options, and therefore they normally require the complementary use of a keyboard. 

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_mouse More info]

===== Other =====
There are many other types of input, such as [[w:Touch screen|touch screen]], [[w:Gyroscope|gyroscopic]], motion sensing, and so forth.

Unusual devices may also be part of a merchandising scheme and even an attraction to sell games or game systems. From driving sets that attempt to emulate real car (or even airplane) controls to musical instruments (realistic or not), all type of objects can serve as input devices. We are also entering in a new stage beyond simple actuators to having the game system detect body movements and facial expressions, eliminating the need for any direct controller with the virtualization of it.

==== Output ====
Output, or the response to the input, is just as - if not more - important as the input portion of the gameplay experience. There are usually only 2 types of output any standard device can perform, ''visual output'' and ''auditory output''.

===== Graphics =====
[http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/graphic Graphics] are the form of visual output seen on a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_screen computer monitor] by use of little dots called [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel pixels].

There are essentially two types of graphics: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2D_computer_graphics 2D] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics 3D], each offering very different gameplay experiences. However, 3D does not necessarily mean a better gameplay experience. Often, this is misconceived in today's game industry. A game developer will assume that because 3D is the most recent and advanced technology, it is naturally better.

While a 3D environment can provide a much deeper and more exciting gameplay experience, it is not always better. First off, we should make clear the difference between '''graphics''' and '''environment'''. The game environment is the realm the player is allowed and able to act within, while the graphics are what is seen.

Often times you will see a game with 3D graphics, but a 2D gameplay environment; Pac-Man World 3 is one of these. Oppositely, Super Mario Kart (for the Super Nintendo) would be considered a game with a 3D environment, but 2D graphics.

Another note, is that 3D graphics do not equal good graphics. There are plenty of games with 3D graphics that just look bad. And there are plenty of games with 2D graphics that look amazing. What makes graphics look good is very subjective; however, there are some concepts that seem to be good rules of thumb.

For any graphics to look good, they must be arranged in clearly defined objects (if there is a ball, you should be able to tell it is a ball). Lines should be straight, circles should be round, etc. For more realistic textures, modern games utilize bump mapping, which takes advantage of fractal geometry. A good example of this can be seen in the upcoming game Tekken 6. [http://www.youtube.com/w/Tekken-6-Preview?v=z8ZSCRU5Mjc&amp;feature=Random&amp;page=1&amp;t=t&amp;f=b/]

There are also two types of graphic files: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raster_graphics Raster] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_graphics Vector].

As mentioned at the beginning of the chapter, a video game is, at its foundation, communication. Graphics allow the player to see the world within the screen. It is the job of the programmer to portray this world so that the player can become a part of it. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senses More info: Senses]

===== Audio =====
There are 2 basic kinds of audio used in games, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_effect Sound effects] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music Music] - heard through the computer's [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_speaker Speakers].

Music can have a powerful effect on people, this effect is discussed later in the human element section of this chapter.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''benefit-cost analysis''' (BCA)&lt;ref&gt;benefit-cost analysis is sometimes referred to as cost-benefit analysis (CBA)&lt;/ref&gt; is often required in determining whether a project should be approved and is useful for comparing similar projects. It determines the stream of quantifiable economic benefits and costs that are associated with a project or policy. If the benefits exceed the costs, the project is worth doing; if the benefits fall short of the costs, the project is not. Benefit-cost analysis is appropriate where the technology is known and well understood or a minor change from existing technologies is being performed. BCA is not appropriate when the technology is new and untried because the effects of the technology cannot be easily measured or predicted. However, just because something is new in one place does not necessarily make it new, so benefit-cost analysis would be appropriate, e.g., for a light-rail or commuter rail line in a city without rail, or for any road project, but would not be appropriate (at the time of this  writing) for something truly radical like teleportation.

The identification of the costs, and more particularly the benefits, is the chief component of the “art” of Benefit-Cost Analysis.  This component of the analysis is different for every project.  Furthermore, care should be taken to avoid double counting; especially counting cost savings in both the cost and the benefit columns. However, a number of benefits and costs should be included at a minimum.  In transportation these costs should be separated for users, transportation agencies, and the public at large.  Consumer benefits are measured by consumer’s surplus. It is important to recognize that the demand curve is downward sloping, so there a project may produce benefits both to existing users in terms of a reduction in cost and to new users by making travel worthwhile where previously it was too expensive.

Agency benefits come from profits.  But since most agencies are non-profit, they receive no direct profits.  Agency construction, operating, maintenance, or demolition costs may be reduced (or increased) by a new project; these cost savings (or increases) can either be considered in the cost column, or the benefit column, but not both.

Society is impacted by transportation project by an increase or reduction of negative and positive externalities.  Negative externalities, or social costs, include air and noise pollution and accidents.  Accidents can be considered either a social cost or a private cost, or divided into two parts, but cannot be considered in total in both columns.  

If there are network externalities (i.e. the benefits to consumers are themselves a function of the level of demand), then consumers’ surplus for each different demand level should be computed. Of course this is easier said than done.  In practice, positive network externalities are ignored in Benefit Cost Analysis.

== Background ==
=== Early Beginnings ===

When Benjamin Franklin was confronted with difficult decisions, he often recorded the pros and cons on two separate columns and attempted to assign weights to them.  While not mathematically precise, this “moral or prudential algebra”, as he put it, allowed for careful consideration of each “cost” and “benefit” as well as the determination of a course of action that provided the greatest benefit.  While Franklin was certainly a proponent of this technique, he was certainly not the first.  Western European governments, in particular, had been employing similar methods for the construction of waterway and shipyard improvements.

Ekelund and Hebert (1999) credit the French as pioneers in the development of benefit-cost analyses for government projects.  The first formal benefit-cost analysis in France occurred in 1708.  Abbe de Saint-Pierre attempted to measure and compare the incremental benefit of road improvements (utility gained through reduced transport costs and increased trade), with the additional construction and maintenance costs.  Over the next century, French economists and engineers applied their analysis efforts to canals (Ekelund and Hebert, 1999).  During this time, The École Polytechnique had established itself as France’s premier educational institution, and in 1837 sought to create a new course in “social arithmetic”:  “…the execution of public works will in many cases tend to be handled by a system of concessions and private enterprise.  Therefore our engineers must henceforth be able to evaluate the utility or inconvenience, whether local or general, or each enterprise; consequently they must have true and precise knowledge of the elements of such investments.” (Ekelund and Hebert, 1999, p. 47).  The school also wanted to ensure their students were aware of the effects of currencies, loans, insurance, amortization and how they affected the probable benefits and costs to enterprises.

In the 1840s French engineer and economist Jules Dupuit (1844, tr. 1952) published an article “On Measurement of the Utility of Public Works”, where he posited that benefits to society from public projects were not the revenues taken in by the government (Aruna, 1980).  Rather the benefits were the difference between the public’s willingness to pay and the actual payments the public made (which he theorized would be smaller).  This “relative utility” concept was what Alfred Marshall would later rename with the more familiar term, “consumer surplus” (Ekelund and Hebert, 1999).

Vilfredo Pareto (1906) developed what became known as Pareto improvement and Pareto efficiency (optimal) criteria.  Simply put, a policy is a Pareto improvement if it provides a benefit to at least one person without making anyone else worse off (Boardman, 1996).  A policy is Pareto efficient (optimal) if no one else can be made better off without making someone else worse off.  British economists Kaldor and Hicks (Hicks, 1941; Kaldor, 1939) expanded on this idea, stating that a project should proceed if the losers could be compensated in some way.  It is important to note that the Kaldor-Hicks criteria states it is sufficient if the winners could potentially compensate the project losers.  It does not require that they be compensated.

=== Benefit-cost Analysis in the United States ===
Much of the early development of benefit-cost analysis in the United States is rooted in water related infrastructure projects.  The US Flood Control Act of 1936 was the first instance of a systematic effort to incorporate benefit-cost analysis to public decision-making.   The act stated that the federal government should engage in flood control activities if “the benefits to whomsoever they may accrue [be] in excess of the estimated costs,” but did not provide guidance on how to define benefits and costs (Aruna, 1980, Persky, 2001).  Early Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) projects also employed basic forms of benefit-cost analysis (US Army Corp of Engineers, 1999).  Due to the lack of clarity in measuring benefits and costs, many of the various public agencies developed a wide variety of criteria.  Not long after, attempts were made to set uniform standards.

The U.S. Army Corp of Engineers “Green Book” was created in 1950 to align practice with theory.  Government economists used the Kaldor-Hicks criteria as their theoretical foundation for the restructuring of economic analysis.  This report was amended and expanded in 1958 under the title of “The Proposed Practices for Economic Analysis of River Basin Projects” (Persky, 2001).

The Bureau of the Budget adopted similar criteria with 1952’s Circular A-47 - “Reports and Budget Estimates Relating to Federal Programs and Projects for Conservation, Development, or Use of Water and Related Land Resources”.

=== Modern Benefit-cost Analysis ===

During the 1960s and 1970s the more modern forms of benefit-cost analysis were developed. Most analyses required evaluation of:  

#	The present value of the benefits and costs of the proposed project at the time they occurred
#	The present value of the benefits and costs of alternatives occurring at various points in time (opportunity costs)
#	Determination of risky outcomes (sensitivity analysis)
#	The value of benefits and costs to people with different incomes (distribution effects/equity issues) (Layard and Glaister, 1994)

=== The Planning Programming Budgeting System (PPBS) - 1965 ===

The Planning Programming Budgeting System (PPBS) developed by the Johnson administration in 1965 was created as a means of identifying and sorting priorities.  This grew out of a system Robert McNamara created for the Department of Defense a few years earlier (Gramlich, 1981).  The PPBS featured five main elements:

#	A careful specification of basic program objectives in each major area of governmental activity.
#	An attempt to analyze the outputs of each governmental program.
#	An attempt to measure the costs of the program, not for one year but over the next several years (“several” was not explicitly defined).
#	An attempt to compare alternative activities.
#	An attempt to establish common analytic techniques throughout the government.

=== Office of Management and Budget (OMB) – 1977 ===

Throughout the next few decades, the federal government continued to demand improved benefit-cost analysis with the aim of encouraging transparency and accountability.  Approximately 12 years after the adoption of the PPBS system, the Bureau of the Budget was renamed the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).  The OMB formally adopted a system that attempts to incorporate benefit-cost logic into budgetary decisions.  This came from the Zero-Based Budgeting system set up by Jimmy Carter when he was governor of Georgia (Gramlich, 1981).

=== Recent Developments ===

Executive Order 12292, issued by President Reagan in 1981, required a regulatory impact analysis (RIA) for every major governmental regulatory initiative over $100 million.  The RIA is basically a benefit-cost analysis that identifies how various groups are affected by the policy and attempts to address issues of equity (Boardman, 1996).

According to Robert Dorfman, (Dorfman, 1997) most modern-day benefit-cost analyses suffer from several deficiencies.  The first is their attempt “to measure the social value of all the consequences of a governmental policy or undertaking by a sum of dollars and cents”.  Specifically, Dorfman mentions the inherent difficultly in assigning monetary values to human life, the worth of endangered species, clean air, and noise pollution.  The second shortcoming is that many benefit-cost analyses exclude information most useful to decision makers:  the distribution of benefits and costs among various segments of the population.  Government officials need this sort of information and are often forced to rely on other sources that provide it, namely, self-seeking interest groups.  Finally, benefit-cost reports are often written as though the estimates are precise, and the readers are not informed of the range and/or likelihood of error present.

The Clinton Administration sought proposals to address this problem in revising Federal benefit-cost analyses.  The proposal required numerical estimates of benefits and costs to be made in the most appropriate unit of measurement, and “specify the ranges of predictions and shall explain the margins of error involved in the quantification methods and in the estimates used” (Dorfman, 1997).  Executive Order 12898 formally established the concept of Environmental Justice with regards to the development of new laws and policies, stating they must consider the “fair treatment for people of all races, cultures, and incomes.”  The order requires each federal agency to identify and address “disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects of its programs, policies and activities on minority and low-income populations.”

=== Probabilistic Benefit-Cost Analysis ===

In recent years there has been a push for the integration of sensitivity analyses of possible outcomes of public investment projects with open discussions of the merits of assumptions used.  This “risk analysis” process has been suggested by Flyvbjerg (2003) in the spirit of encouraging more transparency and public involvement in decision-making. 

The Treasury Board of Canada’s Benefit-Cost Analysis Guide recognizes that implementation of a project has a probable range of benefits and costs.  It posits that the “effective sensitivity” of an outcome to a particular variable is determined by four factors: 

*	the responsiveness of the Net Present Value (NPV) to changes in the variable; 
*	the magnitude of the variable's range of plausible values; 
*	the volatility of the value of the variable (that is, the probability that the value of the variable will move within that range of plausible values); and 
*	the degree to which the range or volatility of the values of the variable can be controlled. 

It is helpful to think of the range of probable outcomes in a graphical sense, as depicted in Figure 1 (probability versus NPV).

Once these probability curves are generated, a comparison of different alternatives can also be performed by plotting each one on the same set of ordinates.  Consider for example, a comparison between alternative A and B (Figure 2).

In Figure 2, the probability that any specified positive outcome will be exceeded is always higher for project B than it is for project A.  The decision maker should, therefore, always prefer project B over project A.  In other cases, an alternative may have a much broader or narrower range of NPVs compared to other alternatives (Figure 3).

Some decision-makers might be attracted by the possibility of a higher return (despite the possibility of greater loss) and therefore might choose project B.  Risk-averse decision-makers will be attracted by the possibility of lower loss and will therefore be inclined to choose project A.

== Discount rate ==

Both the costs and benefits flowing from an investment are spread over time. While some costs are one-time and borne up front, other benefits or operating costs may be paid at some point in the future, and still others received as a stream of payments collected over a long period of time. Because of inflation, risk, and uncertainty, a dollar received now is worth more than a dollar received at some time in the future. Similarly, a dollar spent today is more onerous than a dollar spent tomorrow. This reflects the concept of time preference that we observe when people pay bills later rather than sooner. The existence of real interest rates reflects this time preference.  The appropriate discount rate depends on what other opportunities are available for the capital. If simply putting the money in a government insured bank account earned 10% per year, then at a minimum, no investment earning less than 10% would be worthwhile.  In general, projects are undertaken with those with the highest rate of return first, and then so on until the cost of raising capital exceeds the benefit from using that capital.  Applying this efficiency argument, no project should be undertaken on cost-benefit grounds if another feasible project is sitting there with a higher rate of return.

Three alternative bases for the setting the government’s test discount rate have been proposed:
#	The social rate of time preference recognizes that a dollar's consumption today will be more valued than a dollar's consumption at some future time for, in the latter case, the dollar will be subtracted from a higher income level.  The amount of this difference per dollar over a year gives the annual rate.  By this method, a project should not be undertaken unless its rate of return exceeds the social rate of time preference.
#	The opportunity cost of capital basis uses the rate of return of private sector investment, a government project should not be undertaken if it earns less than a private sector investment.  This is generally higher than social time preference.
#	The cost of funds basis uses the cost of government borrowing, which for various reasons related to government insurance and its ability to print money to back bonds, may not equal exactly the opportunity cost of capital.

Typical estimates of social time preference rates are around 2 to 4 percent while estimates of the social opportunity costs are around 7 to 10 percent.

Generally, for Benefit-Cost studies an acceptable rate of return (the government’s test rate) will already have been established.  An alternative is to compute the analysis over a range of interest rates, to see to what extent the analysis is sensitive to variations in this factor.  In the absence of knowing what this rate is, we can compute the rate of return (internal rate of return) for which the project breaks even, where the net present value is zero.  Projects with high internal rates of return are preferred to those with low rates.

== Determine a present value ==

The basic math underlying the idea of determining a present value is explained using a simple compound interest rate problem as the starting point. Suppose the sum of $100 is invested at 7 percent for 2 years. At the end of the first year the initial $100 will have earned $7 interest and the augmented sum ($107) will earn a further 7 percent (or $7.49) in the second year. Thus at the end of 2 years the $100 invested now will be worth $114.49.

The discounting problem is simply the converse of this compound interest problem. Thus, $114.49 receivable in 2 years time, and discounted by 7 per cent, has a present value of $100.

Present values can be calculated by the following equation:

(1) &lt;math&gt;
P = \frac{F}{{\left( {1 + i} \right)^n }}
\,\!&lt;/math&gt; 
 										
where:  
* F =  future money sum 
* P = present value 
* i = discount rate per time period (i.e. years) in decimal form (e.g. 0.07)
* n = number of time periods before the sum is received (or cost paid, e.g. 2 years)

Illustrating our example with equations we have:
 
&lt;math&gt;
P = \frac{F}{{\left( {1 + i} \right)^n }} = \frac{{114.49}}{{\left( {1 + 0.07} \right)^2 }} = 100.00
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The present value, in year 0, of a stream of equal annual payments of A starting year 1, is given by the reciprocal of the equivalent annual cost. That is, by:

(2) &lt;math&gt;
P = A\left[ {\frac{{\left( {1 + i} \right)^n  - 1}}{{i\left( {1 + i} \right)^n }}} \right]
\,\!&lt;/math&gt; 

where:
* A = Annual Payment

For example: 12 annual payments of $500, starting in year 1, have a present value at the middle of year 0 when discounted at 7% of: $3971
 
&lt;math&gt;
P = A\left[ {\frac{{\left( {1 + i} \right)^n  - 1}}{{i\left( {1 + i} \right)^n }}} \right] = 500\left[ {\frac{{\left( {1 + 0.07} \right)^{12}  - 1}}{{0.07\left( {1 + 0.07} \right)^{12} }}} \right] = 3971
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The present value, in year 0, of m annual payments of A, starting in year n + 1, can be calculated by combining discount factors for a payment in year n and the factor for the present value of m annual payments. For example: 12 annual mid-year payments of $250 in years 5 to 16 have a present value in year 4 of $1986 when discounted at 7%. Therefore in year 0, 4 years earlier, they have a present value of $1515.

&lt;math&gt;
P_{Y = 4}  = A\left[ {\frac{{\left( {1 + i} \right)^n  - 1}}{{i\left( {1 + i} \right)^n }}} \right] = 250\left[ {\frac{{\left( {1 + 0.07} \right)^{12}  - 1}}{{0.07\left( {1 + 0.07} \right)^{12} }}} \right] = 1986
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
P_{Y = 0}  = \frac{F}{{\left( {1 + i} \right)^n }} = \frac{{P_{Y = 4} }}{{\left( {1 + i} \right)^n }} = \frac{{1986}}{{\left( {1 + 0.07} \right)^4 }} = 1515
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

== Evaluation criterion ==
Three equivalent conditions can tell us if a project is worthwhile
#	The discounted present value of the benefits exceeds the discounted present value of the costs 
#	The present value of the net benefit must be positive.
#	The ratio of the present value of the benefits to the present value of the costs must be greater than one.

However, that is not the entire story.  More than one project may have a positive net benefit. From the set of mutually exclusive projects, the one selected should have the highest net present value.  We might note that if there are insufficient funds to carry out all mutually exclusive projects with a positive net present value, then the discount used in computing present values does not reflect the true cost of capital.  Rather it is too low.

There are problems with using the internal rate of return or the benefit/cost ratio methods for project selection, though they provide useful information.  The ratio of benefits to costs depends on how particular items (for instance, cost savings) are ascribed to either the benefit or cost column.  While this does not affect net present value, it will change the ratio of benefits to costs (though it cannot move a project from a ratio of greater than one to less than one).

==Examples==

===Example 1: Benefit Cost Application===

This problem, adapted from [http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/cba.htm Watkins (1996)], illustrates how a Benefit Cost Analysis might be applied to a project such as a highway widening. The improvement of the highway saves travel time and increases safety (by bringing the road to modern standards). But there will almost certainly be more total traffic than was carried by the old highway.  This example excludes external costs and benefits, though their addition is a straightforward extension. The data for the “No Expansion” can be collected from off-the-shelf sources. However the “Expansion” column’s data requires the use of forecasting and modeling. Assume there are 250 weekdays (excluding holidays) each year and four rush hours per weekday.

What is the benefit-cost relationship?

A 50 minute trip at $0.15/minute is $7.50, while a 30 minute trip is only $4.50. So for existing users, the expansion saves $3.00/trip. Similarly in the off-peak, the cost of the trip drops from  $3.50 to $2.50, saving $1.00/trip.

Consumers’ surplus increases both for the trips which would have been taken without the project and for the trips which are stimulated by the project (so-called “induced demand”), as illustrated above in Figure 1.  Our analysis is divided into Old and New Trips, the benefits are given in Table 3.

Note: Old Trips: For trips which would have been taken anyway the benefit of the project equals the value of the time saved multiplied by the number of trips.  New Trips:  The project lowers the cost of a trip and public responds by increasing the number of trips taken.  The benefit to new trips is equal to one half of the value of the time saved multiplied by the increase in the number of trips.
There are 1000 peak hours per year. With 8760 hours per year, we get 7760 offpeak hours per year. These numbers permit the calculation of annual benefits (shown in Table 4).

The safety benefits of the project are the product of the number of lives saved multiplied by the value of life. Typical values of life are on the order of $3,000,000 in US transportation analyses.  We need to value life to  determine how to trade off between safety investments and other investments. While your life is invaluable to you (that is, I could not pay you enough to allow me to kill you), you don’t act that way when considering chance of death rather than certainty. You take risks that have small probabilities of very bad consequences. You do not invest all of your resources in reducing risk, and neither does society.   If the project is expected to save one life per year, it has a safety benefit of $3,000,000. In a more complete analysis, we would need to include safety benefits from non-fatal accidents.

The annual benefits of the project are given in Table 5. We assume that this level of benefits continues at a constant rate over the life of the project.

'''Costs'''

Highway costs consist of right-of-way, construction, and maintenance. Right-of-way includes the cost of the land and buildings that must be acquired prior to construction. It does not consider the opportunity cost of the right-of-way serving a different purpose. Let the cost of right-of-way be $100 million, which must be paid before construction starts. In principle, part of the right-of-way cost can be recouped if the highway is not rebuilt in place (for instance, a new parallel route is constructed and the old highway can be sold for development). Assume that all of the right-of-way cost is recoverable at the end of the thirty-year lifetime of the project. The $1 billion construction cost is spread uniformly over the first four-years. Maintenance costs $2 million per year once the highway is completed.

The schedule of benefits and costs for the project is given in Table 6.

'''Conversion to Present Value'''

The benefits and costs are in constant value dollars. Assume the real interest rate (excluding inflation) is 2%. The following equations provide the present value of the streams of benefits and costs.

To compute the Present Value of Benefits in Year 5, we apply equation (2) from above.

&lt;math&gt;
P = A\left[ {\frac{{\left( {1 + i} \right)^n  - 1}}{{i\left( {1 + i} \right)^n }}} \right] = 139.72\left[ {\frac{{\left( {1 + 0.02} \right)^{26}  - 1}}{{0.02\left( {1 + 0.02} \right)^{26} }}} \right] = 2811.31
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

To convert that Year 5 value to a Year 1 value, we apply equation (1)

&lt;math&gt;
P = \frac{F}{{\left( {1 + i} \right)^n }} = \frac{{2811.31}}{{\left( {1 + 0.02} \right)^4 }} = 2597.21
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The present value of right-of-way costs is computed as today’s right of way cost ($100 M) minus the present value of the recovery of those costs in Year 30, computed with equation (1):

&lt;math&gt;
P = \frac{F}{{\left( {1 + i} \right)^n }} = \frac{{100}}{{\left( {1 + 0.02} \right)^{30} }} = 55.21 
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
100 - 55.21 = 44.79 
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The present value of the construction costs is computed as the stream of $250M outlays over four years is computed with equation (2):

&lt;math&gt;
P = A\left[ {\frac{{\left( {1 + i} \right)^n  - 1}}{{i\left( {1 + i} \right)^n }}} \right] = 250\left[ {\frac{{\left( {1 + 0.02} \right)^4  - 1}}{{0.02\left( {1 + 0.02} \right)^4 }}} \right] = 951.93
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
 
Maintenance Costs are similar to benefits, in that they fall in the same time periods.  They are computed the same way, as follows:
To compute the Present Value of $2M in Maintenance Costs in Year 5, we apply equation (2) from above.

&lt;math&gt;
P = A\left[ {\frac{{\left( {1 + i} \right)^n  - 1}}{{i\left( {1 + i} \right)^n }}} \right] = 2\left[ {\frac{{\left( {1 + 0.02} \right)^{26}  - 1}}{{0.02\left( {1 + 0.02} \right)^{26} }}} \right] = 40.24
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

To convert that Year 5 value to a Year 1 value, we apply equation (1)

&lt;math&gt;
P = \frac{F}{{\left( {1 + i} \right)^n }} = \frac{{40.24}}{{\left( {1 + 0.02} \right)^4 }} = 37.18
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

As Table 7 shows, the benefit/cost ratio of 2.5 and the positive net present value of $1563.31 million indicate that the project is worthwhile under these assumptions (value of time, value of life, discount rate, life of the road). Under a different set of assumptions, (e.g. a higher discount rate), the outcome may differ.

== Thought Questions ==

=== Decision Criteria ===
Which is a more appropriate decision criteria: Benefit/Cost or Benefit - Cost? Why?
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;background: ##aaaaaa; border: 4px solid #ffCC99; padding: 6pt; margin: 12pt 0.5em; width: -0.5em&quot;&gt;

=== Is it only money that matters? ===
'''Problem'''

Is money the only thing that matters in Benefit-Cost Analysis?  Is &quot;converted&quot; money the only thing that matters?  For example, the value of human life in dollars?

'''Solution'''

Absolutely not.  A lot of benefits and costs can be converted to monetary value, but not all.  For example, you can put a price on human safety, but how can you put a price on, say, aesthetics--something that everyone agrees is beneficial.  What else can you think of?
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;background: ##aaaaaa; border: 4px solid #ffCC99; padding: 6pt; margin: 12pt 0.5em; width: -0.5em&quot;&gt;

=== Can small units of time be given the same value of time as larger units of time?  ===

In other words, do 60 improvements each saving a traveler 1 minute equal 1 improvement saving a traveler 60 minutes? Similarly, does 1 improvement saving a 1000 travelers 1 minute equal the value of time of a single traveler of 1000 minutes. These are different problems, one is intra-traveler and one is inter-traveler, but related.

Several issues arise.

A. Is value of time linear or non-linear? To this we must conclude the value of time is surely non-linear. I am much more agitated waiting 3 minutes at a red light than 2, and I begin to suspect the light is broken. Studies of ramp meters show a similar phenomena&lt;ref&gt;Weighting Waiting:
Evaluating Perception of In-Vehicle Travel Time Under Moving and Stopped Conditions&lt;/ref&gt; .

B. How do we apply this in a benefit-cost analysis? If we break one project into 60 smaller projects, each with a smaller value of travel time saved, and then we added the gains, we would get a different result than the what obtains with a single large project. For analytical convenience, we would like our analyses to be additive, not sub-additive, otherwise arbitrarily dividing the project changes the result. In particular many smaller projects will produce an undercount that is quite significant, and result in a much lower benefit than if the projects were bundled.

As a practical matter, every Benefit/Cost Analysis  assumes a single value of time, rather than assuming non-linear value of time. This also helps avoiding biasing public investments towards areas with people who have a high value of time (the rich)

On the other hand, mode choice analyses do however weight different components of travel time differently, especially transit time (i.e. in-vehicle time is less onerous than waiting time). The implicit value of time for travelers does depend on the type of time (though generally not the amount of time). Using the log-sum of the mode choice model as a measure of benefit would implicitly account for this.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;background: ##aaaaaa; border: 4px solid #ffCC99; padding: 6pt; margin: 12pt 0.5em; width: -0.5em&quot;&gt;

=== Are sunk costs sunk, is salvage value salvageable? A paradox in engineering economics analysis ===

Salvage value is defined as &quot;The estimated value of an asset at the end of its useful life.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.investorwords.com/4372/salvage_value.html&lt;/ref&gt;
Sunk cost is defined as &quot;Cost already incurred which cannot be recovered regardless of future events.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.investorwords.com/4813/sunk_cost.html&lt;/ref&gt;

It is often said in economics that &quot;sunk costs are sunk&quot;, meaning they should not be considered a cost in economic analysis, because the money has already been spent.

Now consider two cases

In '''case 1''', we have a road project that costs $10.00 today, and at the end of 10 years has some economic value remaining, let's say a salvage value of $5.00, which when discounted back to the present is $1.93 (at 10% interest). This value is the residual value of the road. Thus, the total present cost of the project $10.00 - $1.93 = $8.07. Clearly the road cannot be moved. However, its presence makes it easier to build future roads ... the land has been acquired and graded, some useful material for aggregate is on-site perhaps, and can be thought of as the amount that it reduces the cost of future generations to build the road. Alternatively, the land could be sold for development if the road is no longer needed, or turned into a park.

Assume the present value of the benefit of the road is $10.00. The benefit/cost ratio is $10.00 over $8.07 or 1.23. If we treat the salvage value as a benefit rather than cost, the benefit is $10.00 + $1.93 = $11.93 and the cost is $10, and the B/C is 1.193.

In 10 years time, the community decides to replace the old worn out road with a new road. This is a new project. The salvage value from the previous project is now the sunk cost of the current project (after all the road is there and could not be moved, and so does not cost the current project anything to exploit). So the cost of the project in 10 years time would be $10.00 - $5.00 = $5.00. Discounting that to the present is $1.93.

The benefit in 10 years time is also $10.00, but the cost in 10 years time was $5.00, and the benefit/cost ratio they perceive is $10.00/$5.00 = 2.00

Aggregating the two projects
* the benefits are $10 + $3.86 = $13.86
* the costs are $8.07 + $1.93 = $10.00
* the collective benefit/cost ratio is 1.386
* the NPV is benefits - costs = $3.86

One might argue the salvage value is a benefit, rather than a cost reduction. In that case
* the benefits are $10.00 + $1.93 + $3.86 = $15.79
* the costs are $10.00 + $1.93 = $11.93
* the collective benefit/cost ratio is 1.32
* the NPV remains $3.86


'''Case 2''' is an identical road, but now the community has a 20 year time horizon to start.
The initial cost is $10, and the cost in 10 years time is $5.00 (discounted to $1.93). The benefits are $10 now and $10 in 10 years time (discounted to $3.86). There is no salvage value at the end of the first period, nor sunk costs at the beginning of the second period.
What is the benefit cost ratio?
* the costs are $11.93
* the benefits are still $13.86
* the benefit/cost ratio is 1.16
* the NPV is $1.93.

If you are the community, which will you invest in? 
Case 1 has an initial B/C of 1.23 (or 1.193), Case 2 has a B/C of 1.16. But the real benefits and real costs of the roads are identical.

The salvage value in this example is, like so much in economics (think Pareto optimality), an accounting fiction. In this case no transaction takes place to realize that salvage value. On the other hand, excluding the salvage value over-estimates the net cost of the project, as it ignores potential future uses of the project.

Time horizons on projects must be comparable to correctly assess relative B/C ratio, yet not all projects do have the same benefit/cost ratio.

&lt;/div&gt;

== Software Tools for Impact Analysis ==

The majority of economic impact studies for highway capacity
projects are undertaken using conventional methods.  These
methods tend to focus on the direct user impacts of individual
projects in terms of travel costs and outcomes, and compare
sums of quantifiable, discounted benefits and costs. Inputs to
benefit-cost analyses can typically be obtained from readily
available data sources or model outputs (such as construction
and maintenance costs, and before and after estimates of travel
demand, by vehicle class, along with associated travel times).
Valuation of changes in external, somewhat intangible costs of
travel (e.g., air pollution and crash injury) can usually be
accommodated by using ''shadow price'' estimates, such as
obtained from FHWA-suggested values, based on recent empirical
studies.

The primary benefits included in such studies are those related
to reductions in user cost, such as travel time savings and
vehicle operating costs (e.g. fuel costs, vehicle depreciation,
etc.).  Additional benefits may stem from reductions in crash
rates, vehicle emissions, noise, and other costs associated
with vehicle travel.  Project costs are typically confined to
expenditures on capital investment, along with ongoing
operations and maintenance costs.

A number of economic analysis tools have been developed under
the auspices of the United States Federal Highway Administration (FHWA)
permitting different forms of benefit-cost analysis for
different types of projects, at different levels of evaluation.
Several of these tools are prevalent in past impact analyses,
and are described here. However, none identifies the effects of
infrastructure on the economy and development.

=== MicroBENCOST ===
MicroBENCOST  &lt;ref&gt;McTrans. Microbencost. Web page, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; is a sketch planning tool for
estimating basic benefits and costs of a range of highway
improvement projects, including capacity addition projects.  In
each type of project, attention is focused on corridor traffic
conditions and their resulting impact on motorist costs with
and without a proposed improvement.  This type of approach may
be appropriate for situations where projects have relatively
isolated impacts and do not require regional modeling.

=== SPASM ===
The Sketch Planning Analysis Spreadsheet Model (SPASM) is a
benefit-cost tool designed for screening level analysis. It
outputs estimates of project costs, cost-effectiveness,
benefits, and energy and air quality impacts.  SPASM is
designed to allow for comparison among multiple modes and
non-modal alternatives, such as travel demand management
scenarios.  The model is comprised of three modules
(worksheets) relating to public agency costs, characteristics
of facilities and trips, and a travel demand component.
Induced traffic is dealt with through the use of
elasticity-based methods, where an elasticity of vehicle-miles
of travel (VMT) with respect to travel time is defined and
applied.  Vehicle emissions are estimated based on calcuations
of VMT, trip length and speeds, and assumed shares of travel
occuring in cold start, hot start, and hot stabilized
conditions.  Analysis is confined to a corridor level, with all
trips having the same origin, destination and length.  This
feature is appropriate for analysis of linear transportation
corridors, but also greatly limits the ability to deal with
traffic drawn to or diverted from outside the corridor. DeCorla-Souza et al. (1996) &lt;ref&gt;P. DeCorla-Souza, H. Cohen, and K. Bhatt. Using benefit-cost analysis to evaluate across modes and demand management strategies. In Compendium of Technical Papers, 66th Annual Meeting of the Institute of Transportation Engineers, pages 439–445. Institute of Transporta- tion Engineers, ITE, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; describe the model and its
application to a freeway corridor in Salt Lake City, Utah.

=== STEAM ===
The Surface Transportation Efficiency Analysis Model (STEAM) is
a planning-level extension of the SPASM model, designed for a
fuller evaluation of cross-modal and demand management
policies.  STEAM was designed to overcome the most important
limitations of its predecessor, namely the assumption of
average trip lengths within a single corridor and the inability
to analyze systemwide effects.  The enhanced modeling
capabilities of STEAM feature greater compatibility with
existing four-step travel demand models, including a trip table
module that is used to calculate user benefits and emissions
estimates based on changes in network conditions and travel
behavior.  Also, the package features a risk analysis component
to its evaluation summary module, which calculates the
likelihood of various outcomes such as benefit-cost ratios.  An
overview of STEAM and a hypothetical application are given by DeCorla-Souza et al. (1998)&lt;ref&gt;P. DeCorla-Souza, H. Cohen, D. Haling, and J. Hunt. Using steam for benefit-cost analysis of transportation alternatives. Transportation Research Record, 1649:63–71, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== SMITE ===
The Spreadsheet Model for Induced Travel Estimation (SMITE) is a
sketch planning application that was designed for inclusion
with STEAM in order to account for the effects of induced
travel in traffic forecasting.  SMITE's design as a simple
spreadsheet application allows it to be used in cases where a
conventional, four-step travel demand model is unavailable or
cannot account for induced travel effects in its structure&lt;ref&gt;P. DeCorla-Souza and H. Cohen. Accounting for induced travel in evaluation of urban high- way expansion. Online resource, U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;.  SMITE applies elasticity
measures that describe the response in demand (VMT) to changes
in travel time and the response in supply (travel time) to
changes in demand levels.

=== SCRITS ===
As a practical matter, highway corridor improvements involving
intelligent transportation systems (ITS) applications to smooth
traffic flow can be considered capacity enhancements, at least
in the short term.  The FHWA's SCRITS (SCReening for ITS) is a
sketch planning tool that offers rough estimates of ITS
benefits, for screening-level analysis.  SCRITS utilizes
aggregate relationships between average weekday traffic levels
and capacity to estimate travel speed impacts and vehicle-hours
of travel (VHT).  Like many other FHWA sketch planning tools,
it is organized in spreadsheet format and can be used in
situations where more sophisticated modeling systems are
unavailable or insufficient.

===HERS ===
In addition to helping states plan and manage their highway
systems, the FHWA's Highway Economic Requirements System for
states (HERS-ST) offers a model for economic impacts
evaluation. In one case, Luskin (2005) &lt;ref&gt;D. Luskin and Erin Mallard. Potential gains from more efficient spending on Texas highways. In Proceedings of the 84th Annual Meeting of the Transportation Research Board, January, Washington D.C., 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; use HERS-ST to
conclude that Texas is under-invested in highways –
particularly urban systems and lower-order functional classes –
by 50 percent.  Combining economic priniciples with engineering
criteria, HERS evaluates competing projects via benefit-cost
ratios.  Recognizing user benefits, emissions levels, and
construction and maintenance costs, HERS operates within a GIS
environment and will be evaluated under this project, for
discussion in project deliverables.  Well established software
like HERS offer states and regions an oportunity to readily
pursue standardized economic impact evaluations on all
projects, a key advantage for many users, as well as the
greater community.

=== Summary of Software Tools ===
Many analytical tools, like those described above, are favored
due to their relative ease of use and employment of readily
available or easily acquired data.  However, several
characteristics limit their effectiveness in evaluating the
effects of new highway capacity.  First, they are almost always
insufficient to describe the full range of impacts of new
highway capacity.  Such methods deliberately reduce economic
analysis to the most important components, resorting to several
simplifying assumptions. If a project adds capacity to a
particularly important link in the transportation network, its
effects on travel patterns may be felt outside the immediate
area.  Also, the effects of induced travel, in terms of either
route switching or longer trips, may not be accounted for in
travel models based on a static, equilibrum assignment of
traffic.  In the longer term, added highway capacity may lead
to the spatial reorganization of activities as a result of
changes in regional accessibility.  These types of changes
cannot typically be accounted for in  analysis methods.

Second, there is the general criticism of methods based on
benefit-cost analysis that they cannot account for all possible
impacts of a project.  Benefit-cost methods deliberately reduce
economic analysis to the most important components and often
must make simplifying assumptions.  The project-based methods
described here generally do not describe the economic effects
of a project on different user or non-user groups.  Winners and
losers from a new capacity project cannot be effectively
identified and differentiated.

Third, a significant amount of uncertainty and risk is involved
in the employment of project-based methods.  Methods that use
benefit-cost techniques to calculate B/C ratios, rates of
return, and/or net present values are often sensitive to
certain assumptions and inputs.  With transportation
infrastructure projects, the choice of discount rate is often
critical, due to the long life of projects and large, up-front
costs.  Also, the presumed value of travel time savings is
often pivotal, since it typically reflects the majority of
project benefits.  Valuations of travel time savings vary
dramatically across the traveler population, as a function of
trip purpose, traveler wage, household income, and time of day.
It is useful to test several plausible values.

Assessment procedures in the UK and other parts of Europe have
moved towards a multi-criteria approach, where economic
development is only one of several appraisal criteria.
Environmental, equity, safety, and the overall integration with
other policy sectors are examined in a transparent framework
for decision makers.  In the UK, the Guidance on the
Methodologies for Multi-Modal Studies (2000) &lt;ref&gt;Department of Transport and the Environment. Guidance on the Methodologies for Multi- Modal Studies. Technical report, Department of Transport and the Environment, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; provides such a framework. These procedures require a clear
definition of project goals and objectives, so that actual
effects can be tied to project objectives, as part of the
assessment procedure.  This is critical for understanding
induced travel effects.  Noland  (2007) &lt;ref&gt;R.B. Noland. Transport planning and environmental assessment: implications of induced travel effects. International Journal of Sustainable Transportation, 1(1):1–28, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;has argued
that this implies that comprehensive economic assessment,
including estimation of land valuation effects, is the only way
to fully assess the potential beneficial impacts of projects.

==Lesson==
'''Difference of Squares'''

Any binomial of the form &lt;math&gt;a^2 - b^2&lt;/math&gt; may be written as &lt;math&gt;(a+b) \cdot (a-b)&lt;/math&gt;. That is 

&lt;math&gt;a^2 - b^2 = (a-b) \cdot (a+b) &lt;/math&gt;.

'''Example 1:''' Factor &lt;math&gt;x^2 - 9&lt;/math&gt;. 

This is clearly seen just take &lt;math&gt;a^2 = x^2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b^2 = 9&lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt;b=3&lt;/math&gt;. So &lt;math&gt;x^2-9 = (x-3)(x+3)&lt;/math&gt; 


'''Example 2:''': &lt;math&gt;32w^4 - 162&lt;/math&gt;.  

Here it is unclear where we can use the difference of squares as 32 is NOT a perfect square. However if we look we see that we can factor out a common factor of 2. 

&lt;math&gt;32w^4 - 162 = 2(16w^4 -81)&lt;/math&gt; 

Now we see we can use the difference of two squares to simplify matters take &lt;math&gt;a^2 = 16w^4&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; b^2 = 81 &lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;2(16w^4 -81) =2(4w^2 - 9)(4w^2 + 9) &lt;/math&gt;

Now we notice that we can use the difference of squares again in the first factor to get:

&lt;math&gt;2(4w^2 - 9)(4w^2 + 9)=2(2w+3)(2w-3)(4w^2 + 9)&lt;/math&gt;

This is now completely factored.


This is brings us to our next point that is that &lt;math&gt;a^2 + b^2&lt;/math&gt; is NOT FACTORABLE (at least for the purposes of this class).

==Example Problems==

Let a = b

Therefore: a^2 = ab

Therefore: a^2 - b^2 = ab - b^2

Therefore: (a + b)(a - b) = b(a - b)

Now divide both sides by (a - b)

Therefore: a + b = b 

But since a = b and substituting b for a

Therefore: b + b = b

Therefore: 2b = b

Now divide both sides by b

Therefore: 2 = 1

QED

            container.add(panels[counter] = new MyPanel(getWidth()/2,getHeight()/2,
                                                     getWidth()/2*(counter/2),
                                                     getHeight()/2*(counter % 2),
                                                     colors[counter]));
      }
   }


i need help in understanding this code what does the line of code does ?

  container.add(panels[counter] = new MyPanel(getWidth()/2,getHeight()/2,
                                                     getWidth()/2*(counter/2),
                                                     getHeight()/2*(counter % 2),
                                                     colors[counter]));

Also 1 more Question:


whatg does thi do ?

g.fillOval(getWidth()/2-counter,getHeight()/2-counter,2*counter,2*counter);
         
            g.setColor(Color.lightGray);
         
            g.fillOval(getWidth()/2-counter+10,getHeight()/2-counter+10,2*counter-20,2*counter-20);


----
In general, the first bit of code you are asking about makes and adds a certain panel to the container and the second line draws a certain oval, and then another oval (which is gray).

I think it would be better to break up the program more and have more explanation to it.  It would also be beneficial to differentiate between AWT, SWT, and Swing.

Also, GridBagLayouts are much better than the kind you are using.

== Clean up examples ==

The examples in the Long Examples section need to be cleaned up, both due to bugs and poor programming practices. The concepts of the examples is sound however.
# Doesn't access swing components only from the event dispatch thread. This can cause a deadlock.
# Uses string literals for determining component placement instead of constants from the layout manager (&quot;East&quot;, &quot;West&quot;... instead of BorderLayout.EAST, BorderLayout.WEST etc.)
# Uses one agrigate listener that has to check which buttons were pushed. There should be one listener to handle the number buttons, one for the operations, one for special buttons.
## Also, doing &quot;if (src == button1)&quot; is error prone. If button1 has changed since the listener was added that will return false. 
# Formatting and naming convention doesn't follow Java standards. See [http://java.sun.com/docs/codeconv/html/CodeConventions.doc8.html#367 Java Coding Conventions]
# Two examples showing the same thing in functional and non-functional versions is overly verbose and confusing.
# String equality is done using var == &quot;literal&quot; instead of &quot;literal&quot;.equals(var), this &quot;works&quot; only because all literals are inlined.
# &quot;if (OperatorKey == true)&quot; is redundant, should be &quot;if(OperatorKey)&quot;
# Status is set to literal values instead of being set to constant values. Set to &quot;VALID&quot;, &quot;FIRST&quot;, &quot;ERROR&quot; et al.

Applied changes. [[User:Dark Pegasus|Dark Pegasus]] 04:01, 16 October 2006 (UTC)

== Reorganized ==
Along with splitting up the swing section into more subsections, I also moved the above talk from the first page to this page, as this is now the page that it pertains to.

__NOTOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

On this page, we'll get started with swing.  We'll look at the classes &lt;code&gt;JFrame&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;JLabel&lt;/code&gt;, and build a basic swing &quot;hello world&quot; application.

== JFrames ==

JFrames are swing components.  A swing component is a part of a graphic user interface (GUI).  Frames, windows, text boxes, buttons, switches and many other parts of a GUI application are all components.  The root class of all swing components is the &lt;code&gt;JComponent&lt;/code&gt; class, and other swing components, including &lt;code&gt;JFrame&lt;/code&gt;, are subclasses of &lt;code&gt;JComponent&lt;/code&gt;.  &lt;code&gt;JComponent&lt;/code&gt; is an abstract class, so it cannot be instantiated directly, but can be subclassed, which is useful if you want to write your own custom GUI component.

A JFrame is a top-level component, meaning that it contains other components, but is not contained itself.  It's onscreen appearance is dictated by the platform, but generally it is a
window that the user can resize, move, maximize, minimize, and has its own title bar.

Probably the best way to get familiar with a &lt;code&gt;JFrame&lt;/code&gt;, as well as components in general, is to run a short example program that creates one.  The following program will do the trick.
{{XCode|1='''A simple Swing application'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;Java&quot;&gt;
import javax.swing.JFrame;  // All swing components live
                    // in the javax.swing package


// A simple class to test a JFrame
public class JFrameTest {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        // create the frame.  The constructor optionally takes
                // a string as an argument that's used as the title.
        JFrame frame = new JFrame(&quot;This is a test!&quot;);
        
        // set the size -- 300 by 300 is good
        frame.setSize(300, 300);
        
        // this next line is currently commented.  If you
        // uncomment it, the user will not be able to resize
        // the JFrame

        // frame.setResizable(false);
        
        // has the application exit when the frame is closed
        frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
        
        // makes the frame visible.  The frame is invisible
        // until this method is called.
        frame.setVisible(true);
        
        // these lines are also commented, but you can uncomment
        // them to see their effects.  The first will center the
        // JFrame in the center of the screen.  The second will
        // make it the front, focused window.

        // frame.setLocationRelativeTo(null);
        // frame.toFront();
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;}}
&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted:
Here's the output:

[[Image:Java Programming-SwingImages-FrameTest.JPG]] --&gt;

The code creates an empty JFrame.  When you run it, you should see a window appear on your screen.  The code also illustrates some methods that can be used with JFrames, some of which are commented out.  I would encourage you to experiment a bit with commenting and uncommenting these, and seeing the effect.

== JLabels ==

An empty frame is only so exciting, so for this section, we're going to look at JLabels, and put one in a JFrame. A &lt;code&gt;JLabel&lt;/code&gt; is a GUI component that can hold an image, some text, or both.

The following code creates a GUI version of the &quot;Hello World!&quot; application.

{{XCode|1='''Hello world in Swing'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
import javax.swing.*;  // All swing components live
               // in the javax.swing package

// A GUI hello world application
public class Hello {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        // creates the label.  The JLabel constructor
        // takes an optional argument which sets the text
        // of the label.
        JLabel label = new JLabel(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;);
        
        // The next line is commented out.  If it is
        // uncommented, the text will be aligned with
        // the center of the frame, otherwise it will
        // align on the left.
        
        // label.setHorizontalAlignment(SwingConstants.CENTER);
        
        JFrame frame = new JFrame(&quot;Hello&quot;);
        frame.add(label);
        
        frame.setSize(300, 300);
        frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
        frame.setVisible(true);
        frame.setLocationRelativeTo(null);
        frame.toFront();
    }
}

&lt;/source&gt;}}

This program is pretty much like the previous one, except that it creates a &lt;code&gt;JLabel&lt;/code&gt; with the text &quot;Hello, World!&quot; in addition to the &lt;code&gt;JFrame&lt;/code&gt;, and uses the &lt;code&gt;JFrame&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;add()&lt;/code&gt; method to add it to the frame before making it visible.  If you compile and run the program as-is, the &quot;Hello, world&quot; text will be aligned on the left side of the window.&lt;!--  , like this:

Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Java Programming-SwingImages-SwingHello1.JPG]] --&gt;

By uncommenting the line &lt;code&gt;label.setHorizontalAlignment(SwingConstants.CENTER);&lt;/code&gt; you can move the text to the center.&lt;!--  , and get this output:

Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Java Programming-SwingImages-SwingHello2.JPG]] --&gt;

== Summary ==

We've seen how to create a JFrame, a top level container for a swing GUI application, as well as a few &lt;code&gt;JFrame&lt;/code&gt; methods that can be used to change its settings.  We also looked at the &lt;code&gt;JLabel&lt;/code&gt; class, and used the &lt;code&gt;JFrame&lt;/code&gt;'s &lt;code&gt;add()&lt;/code&gt; method to add a &lt;code&gt;JLabel&lt;/code&gt; to the frame in order to create a simple application.

Looking at these examples, you might be wondering what other methods exist for JFrames, JLabels, and other components.  Although we'll continue to look at more components and more methods.  Fortunately, Oracle provides an invaluable online reference to all of the core Java classes, including swing, which can be viewed at the following link:

{{Side note|side=right|{{Java Swings/Content}}}}
__NOTOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

On the last page, we created an application that passively displays a &quot;Hello, world&quot; message.  However, that gets boring quickly.  In this chapter, we'll talk about swing events and look at the &lt;code&gt;JButton&lt;/code&gt; class, and we'll build a small application that includes a &lt;code&gt;JButton&lt;/code&gt; with a &lt;code&gt;JLabel&lt;/code&gt;, and use it to introduce the concept of Layouts.

== Events ==

[[Java Programming/Event Handling|Events]] are a fundamental part of how swing works.  Various actions on the part of the user cause components to ''fire'' various types of events.  Other Java objects can register as listeners of events with any components whose events they are interested in.  In order to be a listener, the object must implement the appropriate listener interface (ie, &lt;code&gt;ActionListener&lt;/code&gt; for action events, &lt;code&gt;FocusListener&lt;/code&gt; for focus events, etc.), which contains methods which are called when the event is ''fired''.

In Java, events themselves are objects, and instances of event classes.  The event classes are located in the packages &lt;code&gt;java.awt.event&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;javax.swing.event&lt;/code&gt;.  A few common classes of events are:
* &lt;code&gt;ActionEvent&lt;/code&gt; &amp;mdash; a (somewhat generic) event fired by some objects, including JButtons
* &lt;code&gt;MouseEvent&lt;/code&gt; &amp;mdash; fired when the user does something with the mouse, such as a click, drag, or more general motion
* &lt;code&gt;KeyEvent&lt;/code&gt; &amp;mdash; fired when the user presses, releases, or more generally ''types'' a key on the keyboard

In order to see how events are used, we'll look at JButtons so that we can build an example.

== JButtons ==

A JButton is a component that, like a JLabel, can hold text, images, or both.  However, as we'd expect, it also has the property that the user can &quot;push&quot; it by clicking on it, which causes it to fire an event (specifically, an action event).  In this example, we'll more or less redo our previous example, except that we'll add a JButton.  In the next section, we'll add functionality so that pressing the button does something.

Here's the code that creates the previous &quot;Hello, world&quot; application, plus a button at the bottom of the screen:

[[File:Java Swings Wikibook, Event Handling, example 1 screenshot.png|thumb|right|400px|The window created by the code at left]]
{{XCode|1='''A Swing application with buttons'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
import javax.swing.*;
import java.awt.BorderLayout; // The BorderLayout class
                  // lives in java.awt.  We
                  // use its constants to tell
                  // the JFrame where we want the
                  // components to go.

// expanded version of the hello application,
// but with a button below.
public class HelloWithButton {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        // construct the JLabel,
        // an overloaded version of the constructor
        // allows us to specify the alignment off the
        // bat
        JLabel label = new JLabel
            (&quot;Hello, World!&quot;, SwingConstants.CENTER);
        
        // create the button. The text in the
        // constructor will be visible on the
        // button.
        JButton button = new JButton(&quot;Button&quot;);
        
        // create the frame
        JFrame frame = new JFrame(&quot;Hello&quot;);
        
        // add the label and the button to the
        // frame, using layout constants.
        frame.add(label, BorderLayout.CENTER);
        frame.add(button, BorderLayout.SOUTH);
        
        frame.setSize(300, 300);
        frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
        frame.setVisible(true);
        frame.setLocationRelativeTo(null);
        frame.toFront();
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;}}

What you should see is a frame appear that contains the text &quot;Hello, World!&quot; in the center, along with a button labeled &quot;Button&quot; at the bottom.  You can click on the button, but it doesn't do anything.

In this example, we not only added the components to the frame, but specified where they should go.  Every component which contains other components has a &lt;code&gt;LayoutManager&lt;/code&gt; object, which controls how the components are laid out, and different layout managers lay out their components differently.  A few examples of layout managers are &lt;code&gt;GridLayout&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;CardLayout&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;BorderLayout&lt;/code&gt;.  This last is the default layout manager of a JFrame (although we can change the layout manager of a component by using its &lt;code&gt;setLayout()&lt;/code&gt; method).  Although layout managers are covered in more detail in a later chapter, we'll say here that BorderLayout managers divide their space into five regions, and each is associated with a constant in the &lt;code&gt;BorderLayout&lt;/code&gt; class.  The constants (which explain the regions) are:
* &lt;code&gt;BorderLayout.NORTH&lt;/code&gt;,
* &lt;code&gt;BorderLayout.SOUTH&lt;/code&gt;,
* &lt;code&gt;BorderLayout.EAST&lt;/code&gt;,
* &lt;code&gt;BorderLayout.WEST&lt;/code&gt; and
* &lt;code&gt;BorderLayout.CENTER&lt;/code&gt;.
If you're adding a component to a container that is using a BorderLayout, you can pass one of these constants as an optional second parameter to the &lt;code&gt;add()&lt;/code&gt; method to specify where the component should be placed.  If no constant is specified, the layout manager by default places the new component in the center.  I would encourage you to experiment with the previous example and change the layout parameters, and observe the effect.

Anytime webaware. New recipies are unfortunately copyvios probably a good 30-40% of the time, so I always google part of the recipie to see.

== Background color ==

Is there any way to figure out the HTML color name for the background? If you look at my [[User_talk:Neoptolemus|talk page]], the color of the userbox to the right is about as close as I could get. I would just use ''transparent'', but the line from the first header would go through the userbox. '''[[User:Neoptolemus|Νεοπτόλεμος]]''' 12:55, 6 February 2008 (UTC)

:G'day Νεοπτόλεμος, well now: I can use a colour picker to tell you that the page background for monobook skin is #F8FCFF (unnamed but close to GhostWhite), and that you've picked #F0F8FF (AliceBlue) for your archive box. See [[w:Web colors]] for names. However, bear in mind that Wikibooks can easily be skinned to suit the viewer, so the background colours could well be different from person to person.

[edit] Introduction and disclaimers
While some conversions of ICE vehicles have been performed by major automobile manufacturers in the United States, all such programs have been terminated due to (to quote the manufacturers) &quot;lack of consumer demand&quot; for these vehicles. A few specialty rebuilders offer new or remanufactured conversions to satisfy a rather limited demand. The demand is low primarily due to the costs of completed vehicles, which are up to twice that of a comparable ICE vehicle. Some of these are built on new vehicles, purchased from the original equipment manufacturer but without the various ICE components.

This article is concerned mainly with the hobbyist conversion of ICE vehicles to electric propulsion. It is not intended to be a complete instruction manual, but rather a general guide to performing your own conversions and for purchasing or modifying an EV conversion. Some representative types of vehicle conversions will be presented.

In this article &quot;electric vehicle&quot; (EV) refers to various hobby conversions, not to high-end manufactured vehicles. Also, only technologies available to the hobbyist are considered in depth.

Branded products may be illustrated where such are commonly used in EV conversions. This should not be considered to be promotional or an endorsement, which otherwise might be considered to be in violation of Wikibooks policy.

Note the presence of hazardous materials and conditions that must be approached with proper precautions and procedures to avoid damaging, injurious, or even fatal consequences.


[edit] Why have an electric vehicle?
The greatest fans of electric vehicles are those who have obtained and used them. Owing to the fact that electric vehicles have not been promoted by the major manufacturers in the United States, this is a self-selected group, so their enthusiasm may be misleading. Fans point out the following:

Range is adequate if not the only vehicle in household or if long commutes are not required. Fans point out that most trips in non-commute vehicles are for shopping, school drop-off/pick-up, visiting, and other errands within a 10 to 20 mile (15 to 30 km) radius. Long range is simply not needed for such trips and an operating range of 30 to 40 miles (50 to 65 km) is quite sufficient. 
Fueling at home requires but seconds to plug in for overnight charging followed by a few extra moments in the morning. Some find this to be more convenient than driving to obtain gasoline whose availability and cost is less predictable. 
The homeowner can install on-grid solar photovoltaic rooftop power or residential wind generation and so produce most of the energy required for personal transportation with zero pollution. Since the vehicles can be charged during low demand times the photovoltaics provide a larger societal benefit by helping to satisfy local peak demand, greatly reducing overall pollution and reducing transmission line loads. Additional benefits can also flow to the user through time sensitive pricing/payback schemes, significantly reducing the cost of a system that will support transportation needs. Once a commitment to producing power is made it becomes an easy decision to commit to producing all household and local transportation power needs. Thus there is a societal benefit from electric vehicles beyond transportation. 
Electric vehicles are quiet. Even if not completely silent, they do not produce the low frequency rumble that can easily penetrate household walls and windows. 
Owners take pride in the non-polluting nature of their vehicles. Some point out that knowing that your vehicle is non-polluting quickly leads to a realization how stinky and noxious even modern, well tuned non-electric vehicles actually are — something that tends to be ignored when you are part of the problem. 
Some EV fans with a left of center political bias or of an extreme &quot;green&quot; inclination claim that when combined with household photovoltaics, electric vehicle users are not assisting (through their fuel purchases) despotic governments in oil-rich countries, nor the politically powerful companies that prepare and distribute their products, nor the politically powerful coal interests, nor the domestic politicians that serve and protect these companies and countries. Many electric vehicle owners and operators express great satisfaction in this aspect of electric vehicle use, even while acknowledging that this use can have only little effect on these matters unless adopted more widely and produced in greater quantities. 
Some USA EV fans have accused the three major domestic manufacturers, General Motors, Chrysler Corporation and Ford Motor Company of deliberately sabotaging their own electric vehicle efforts through several methods: failing to market, failing to produce appropriate vehicles, failing to satisfy demand, and using lease-only programs with prohibitions against end of lease purchase. They also point to the Chrysler &quot;golf cart&quot; program as an insult to the marketplace and to mandates, accusing Chrysler of intentionally failing to produce a vehicle usable in mixed traffic conditions. The manufacturers, in their own defense, have responded that they only make what the public wants. Of the various electric vehicles marketed by the &quot;Big Three&quot;, only the General Motors EV1 (manufactured by GM) and the Th!nk City (imported and marketed by Ford) came close to being appropriate configurations for a mass market. However, at the end of their programs GM destroyed its fleet, to avoid the continuing expense necessary to continue to provide maintenance and support for these vehicles. Ford's Norwegian-built &quot;Th!nk&quot; fleet was covered by a three-year exemption to the standard U.S. Motor Vehicle Safety laws, after which time Ford had planned to dismantle and recycle its fleet; the company was, however, persuaded by activists to not destroy its fleet but return them to Norway and sell them as used vehicles. Ford also sold a few lead-acid battery Ranger EVs and has allowed a small percentage of lease returns into a limited market (after crushing and destroying 90 percent of the fleet, without saving any components), and some fleet purchase Chevrolet S-10 EV pickups are being refurbished and sold on the secondary market. 
Both Honda and Toyota also manufactured electric only vehicles. Honda followed the lead of the other majors and terminated their lease-only programs. Toyota offered vehicles for both sale and lease. While Toyota has terminated manufacture of new vehicles it continues to support those manufactured and is allowing for some institutional lease returns to be placed in the marketplace. It is actually possible to see a RAV-4 EV on the road but this is indeed a rare sight. 

[edit] Why convert or purchase a converted ICE to get an electric vehicle?
In Europe and some parts of Asia vehicle buyers have the choice of ICE or electric - it is actually possible to obtain reliable, well engineered and road-worthy electric vehicles and to have them maintained by a dealer. Other than for a beginning market for Neighborhood Electric Vehicles (NEVs), is not possible in the United States for economic, political, and market-restraint reasons. Nor is it possible for a person to easily import a new electric vehicle from Europe or Asia. Certain restrictive safety regulations (such as the requirement for safety glass rather than tempered glass in windshields, airbag requirements, lighting regulations, plus the destructive testing by barrier collisions all operate to inhibit the use of offshore manufactured vehicles. In contrast there are few restrictions on the personal conversion of an ICE vehicle to BEV (battery electric vehicle). This anomaly is distinctly cultural in English speaking North America and is emblematic of a dichotomy in the American political psyche: On the one hand, social and political pressures force the government to protect consumers in the marketplace from exploitation by corporations and large corporations prefer legislation that restricts the entry of new players into the marketplace, while the preservation of individual freedom to tinker in one's garage or workshop is considered sacred, being in the spirit of great inventors such as Edison and the Wright brothers.

Note that battery technology is rapidly improving in cost/performance ratios due to the use of batteries in ICE-electric hybrid vehicles. The EV that is converted today will be upgradeable by future battery (and perhaps charger) replacement.


[edit] Recent history of the electric vehicle in California
Beginning in the 1990s the California Air Resources Board was looking for a way to combat air pollution and when GM began work with their EV1 it caught the eye of the Air Resources Board (Jananne Sharpless, Who Killed the Electric Car Interview). They also saw that the state was spending over $5 billion on air pollution-related illness. There was also a study done in 1989 that reported 1 out of 4 18 to 25 year olds had severe to moderate lung lesions. The Resources board eventually passed a mandate that stated by 2003, 10% of all vehicles sold in the state would be zero emission vehicles (ZEV). Toyota, Honda, General Motors, Ford, and Nissan all built limited production runs of battery-powered vehicles. For a variety of reasons; some say lack of advertising from the original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), others say the lack of purchase (they were only available by closed-end leases); still others say that the limited production runs kept costs too high to make them affordable by the average buyer-- almost all of the leased cars were collected at the end of their lease-- and then destroyed - despite the protestations of willing buyers. The CARB charter was not necessarily intended to drive up the production of electric vehicles, but rather to reduce air polution. The manufacturers successfully argued for changes to the rules. The CARB specifications were modified from zero emissions to an equivalent emission reduction by the mandated production of very low emission vehicles, SULEVs (SUper Low Emission Vehicles) - vehicles producing about one tenth the previously mandated emission levels. This effectively created a hole in the mandate, because the U.S. Federal Government is the only governing body allowed to &quot;mandate&quot; MPG; these are called CAFE standards, they also have not changed (until 2008) since the oil embargo of the 70s... Later on, GM followed by DaimlerChrysler and several dealerships would sue CARB. But it wouldn't be until the Federal government would come on board as well as the Bush administration to help kill the electric car. Not much later President Bush would commit more than a billion dollars to hydrogen fuel cells, while totally ignoring current and past 170 year old EV technology, estabished by analysis to be far more efficient source-to-sink than the proposed hydrogen schemes.

In general, you should not attempt to maintain and operate a &quot;home made&quot; electric vehicle unless you have some interest and perhaps at least modest skills concerning mechanical and electric devices. Such skills are difficult to come by in many states due to the generally low volume of shop and industrial arts classes in current intermediate and high school programs. However, if you are the kind of person who will at least take apart a malfunctioning small appliance, and can sometimes at least identify the problem (e.g., needs regreasing or new motor brushes) you should have little problem with maintaining an EV.

A professionally built conversion will often be designed to be ignored, being engineered, constructed, and tested to survive with only minor maintenance on the operator's part and regular charging, combined with a regular professionally performed maintenance schedule. On the other hand, a non-professional conversion will probably require regular inspections of details like battery and motor electrical and mechanical connections, security of auxiliary systems, and inspection of wires and cables for chafing and loose connectors in order to avoid more extensive problems. While these tasks do not require a large amount of time, this time is more than is usually required of a conventional internal combustion vehicle.


[edit] Operating costs
The direct operating costs will generally be confined to expenses for tires, battery replacement, battery water (where required), and electricity for recharging. Although the cost of electricity for charging these vehicles is generally much less than the cost of fuel for ICE vehicles, the cost of battery replacement can be very high. In general, the overall cost per mile for an EV - including periodic battery replacement, may be greater or less that for a conventional ICE vehicle of similar size and performance, depending largely upon the battery type used. For example, if the cost of electricity is (US) $0.12/KWH, the battery pack costs $1200 to replace (a low cost based upon the lowest cost technology), and lasts 20,000 miles (an optimistic number when using lead-acid batteries), and the vehicle uses 400WH/per mile (a rather high number), the combined cost per mile will be (960 + 1200) / 20000, less than $0.11/mile, comparable to an ICE vehicle getting 25MPG at a cost per gallon of $2.75. This does not count avoided costs such as engine oil changes (about $0.01/mile), smog inspections (about $0.002/mile), and various repairs required to maintain smog certification (which can be costly on an older ICE vehicle, probably between $0.005 and $0.015 per mile ), so the costs are currently roughly comparable at current fuel prices. With more expensive gasoline or the use of more expensive but longer lasting batteries the costs further favor the electric conversion in the long run.

Since converted vehicles are usually of an older vehicle, such vehicles may need other maintenance due to accumulated wear, perhaps wheel bearings, brakes rotors or drums, brake pads or shoes, suspension bushings and the like, and other components that are not usually replaced, but keep the vehicle up to date and show pride in ownership such as upholstery, door seals, and body paint. Such work is generally not cost effective in an ICE vehicle if performed by hire, while an interested hobbyist may do much work at quite modest cost and obtain substantial enjoyment in learning and performing various craft skills.

While a worn ICE vehicle of comparable condition would be simply scrapped, you will likely want to maintain and even improve your conversion, so you should consider maintenance (and even improvement) expenses to be a normal part of maintaining an older vehicle. A more common vehicle may be cheaper to maintain when in the seven to twenty year age range than a rare, special interest, or very old vehicle due to the availability of low cost usable parts from automotive recycling yards. Some special interest vehicles have enabled the creation of a robust secondary parts market, although such vehicles are generaly best left as ICE vehicles unless especially suitable for conversion to electric power.


[edit] Skills needed
A wide range of skills is needed by a converter of a vehicle. Fortunately, there will often be fellow EV enthusiasts in an area that are willing and able to assist the novice builder.


[edit] Automobile survey
A builder should be able to identify problems in a potential conversion vehicle. These are the same skills required to identify and purchase a good used ICE vehicle and are especially useful if a conversion (complete or partial) is purchased from another builder. Note that it may be possible to purchase a used EV conversion that only needs batteries - the owner may want to build another vehicle using the proceeds from the sale of an earlier conversion but not wish to invest in new batteries for a vehicle about to be sold. A careful survey of such a vehicle will go beyond that stated above as it is very important that latent electrical defects be identified and corrected, e.g.: the presence of chafing points in the electrical system that could lead to short circuits and an awareness of the possible necessity for the addition of primary or secondary electrical and operational safety equipment and circuits.

A guide for the inspection of a vehicle for purchase may be found at this How To wiki article (commercial site - not Wikimedia Foundation).


[edit] Basic mechanics
A builder should be able to fabricate small brackets for mounting sensors, switches, and relays. This can be done using simple hand tools - a small vice, hacksaw, shears, hammer, pliers, and various drills and files.


[edit] Machine shop skills
Most machining requires expensive equipment and extensive skills. Machine shop skills will not be needed if the converter can obtain &quot;off the shelf&quot; components (components made to order from known specifications). In the case of exotic conversions the converter may have to have specialized work done locally, or ship the transmission to a specialty vendor. The more machine shop skills a builder has the more work that builder will be able to perform, and will be more skilled at selecting professional help. Creation of the motor coupling and the motor to transmission adapter usually require skills and experience of a high order (a typical automotive machinist will not usually be able to perform the work satisfactorily). A knowledgeable converter will be better able to judge the qualifications of the machinist to be employed, and a cooperative machinist may be willing to allow the converter to perform some of the lower skilled and lower risk tasks. It is also important that the machine shop tasks be well planned out and broken down into the component subtasks, something that a converter of modest machine shop skills will be able to do. Work in a machine shop may be done at fixed price (in which case the enumeration of tasks will aid in bid preparation) or performed using an hourly rate, in which case the estimate will be more accurate. For an exotic conversions where components must be designed a good relationship with a cooperative machine shop is important to completing a successful and cost-effective project.


[edit] Welding
For conversion of a unit body vehicle it is especially important that the batteries be well secured. This is typically done by creating racks from angle steel stock or boxes from sheet metal welded into forms suitable for the batteries and vehicle. These racks or boxes are then welded to the unit body or secured to the vehicle's frame (if accessable). This requires care in avoiding warpage of the primary vehicle structure . For popular conversions it is possible to obtain manufactured racks designed for a pre-engineered layout, so this skill may be considered optional but dependent upon the vehicle selected for conversion. For light truck conversions with in-bed batteries no welding is necessary - all retention may be done with appropriate bolted hardwood components.


[edit] Automotive mechanics
The ability to remove, disassemble, rebuild, and install major ICE components such as transmissions, engines, and suspension components is useful but may be performed by a specialty conversion shop. The builder–owner should be especially cautious in the employment of ICE auto mechanics for these tasks as they may be unfamiliar with specialized EV procedures and requirements.


[edit] Basic electrical
A builder should be sufficiently knowledgeable about basic electricity to safely work on household and EV electrical systems. Note that an EV pack can provide extremely high currents, which can rapidly heat wires or misused tools, causing burns, and that batteries so overloaded can explode with consequent hazards of acid and toxic materials. Most traction packs and the associated high voltage accessory wiring (heater and twelve volt converter) supply or use potentially lethal voltages. Specific electrical arrangements are used to minimize the hazards present and it is important that the builder/operator observe proper precautions and maintain the equipment in a safe configuration.


[edit] Basic electronics
While the systems used in EV safety are not exotic, the builder should have sufficient skill to design and implement basic relay and diode logic for control and alarms. The smaller relays needed may be obtained at a local electronics supply shop or through an EV parts supplier. Some specialty components are obtained from EV parts suppliers or sometimes from automotive parts recyclers.


[edit] Application
Electric vehicles (EVs) are appropriate for short to medium range commuting. Longer ranges are possible if charging may be obtained at both ends of the commute.

EVs are appropriate for local errands where long range is not important. While Neighborhood Electric Vehicles (NEVs, essentially enhanced electric golf cars) are available from several manufactures, such vehicles are not considered here for hobby conversion as they are readily available from manufacturers and are not suitable for most suburban locations (although they may be well suited for operation in some urban environments and many self-contained communities).


[edit] Vehicle
 
Typical firewall components in a light truckWhile almost any vehicle can be converted to electric power, one should be cautious about converting a vehicle simply because it is available (such as a family vehicle with a non-functioning engine). One should first consider the performance envelope that is both desired and affordable (see below) and then find a suitable vehicle that will satisfy these needs when converted. A good used vehicle in running condition may be a better choice than a vehicle with a major defect, as one can test the running components such as transmission, differential, suspension, and other components by road test. If the parts to be removed are in good condition it may be possible to obtain a good price by selling the engine while it can be demonstrated in the vehicle. A purchaser will thus have some confidence in the quality of the engine and may be willing to pay more than for one of unknown quality that has been removed from the vehicle. A later model may be available with advanced safety features and better brakes than would be available on a fifteen or twenty year old vehicle.


[edit] Performance envelope
 
Charger, controller, and vacuum components in a light truck, garden tractor battery to right of vacuum pumpAs a minimum, an EV conversion should have sufficient performance so as not to impede conventional traffic operating within the speed limits of the roadway. This does not mean that it is necessary to obtain a level of performance equivalent to an ICE vehicle, although a short range performance vehicle may be constructed which will significantly outperform ICE vehicles below 30 mph (50 km/h).

Some designers point out that a specific type of electric vehicle offers comfort, utility and quickness, sacrificing only range. This is called a short range electric vehicle. This type may be built using high performance lead–acid batteries, but of only about half the mass that would be expected to obtain a 60 to 80 mile range. The result is a vehicle with about a thirty mile range, but when designed with appropriate weight distribution (40/60 front to rear) does not require power steering, offers exceptional acceleration in the lower end of its operating range, is freeway capable and legal, and costs less to build and maintain. By including a manual transmission this type of vehicle can obtain both better performance and higher efficiency than the single speed types developed by the major manufacturers. Unlike the converted golf carts used for neighborhood electric vehicles, these may be operated on typical suburban throughways (40 to 45 mph or 70 km/h speed limits are typical) and can keep up with traffic typical to these roads and to the short on and off segments of freeways that are common in suburban areas.


[edit] Operating costs vs. capital costs
Relative to an ICE vehicle an EV can offer substantially lower cost per mile in some applications but not all. An ICE can be very cheap to buy and maintain (until old and worn) but expensive for purchase of fuel and for &quot;smog&quot; inspections and oil changes.

An EV can be expensive to build and to replace batteries, yet quite inexpensive to operate if the cost of electricity is low. An EV is especially attractive if a homeowner has installed sufficient net metering photovoltaic (solar electric) panels, particularly if the net metering applies time of use rates.


[edit] Vehicle types

[edit] Novelty vehicle
At the 2005 Stanford University EV Gathering    

Above: Bob Schneeveis[1][2][3] demonstrates his Silver Sofa to the delight of his passengers. This can spin rapidly in place like a carnival ride and its batteries are recharged by the solar panels.

A novelty vehicle or an electric powered art car may not be suitable for on road use. Applications include electric vehicle show demonstrations, parades, parade floats, float towing, and eclectic off-road gatherings such as Burning Man.


[edit] Shoebox racer
A prelude to larger vehicles, intended for the education of middle school students, these are fabricated from a standardize box of components, with the overall design and gear ratios determined by the builder. A building team will typically consist of two students and an adult advisor.


[edit] Electric cart
Suitable for educating youth in the technologies of electric vehicles, technically advanced versions of the cart can exhibit high efficiency in energy use and are a natural prelude to later developing pure solar electric racing vehicles or the conversion of ICE vehicles to electric drive. Speeds are typically limited to about seven MPH so a running adult can overtake and stop a vehicle. Some classes allow a great freedom in design by having a class first disassemble the previous constructions, returning components to appropriate bins. This disassembly task informs the students on design methods and equiment assembly. The students, in small teams, then design and construct new vehicles.


[edit] Tour del Sol
The ultimate in efficiency is exhibited by solar powered electric cars with highly refined chassies, electrics, and aerodynamics. These are designed and assembled by college teams with the support of various businesses, especially those involved with solar power, batteries, electric propulsion, or automotive manufacturing. Competitions are traditionally biennial, with the most widely recognized event being the World Solar Challenge in Australia, an 1800 mile race from Darwin to Adelaide. In the North American Solar Challenge teams race 2500 miles from Austin, Texas through Winnipeg, Manitoba finishing in Calgary, Alberta.


[edit] Electric bicycle
A electric bicycle is a class of bicycles that are fitted with an electric motor. Often they are powered by rechargeable batteries however some experimental electric bicycles run directly on or recharge their batteries via solar panels, fuel cells, gas generators or other alternatives energy sources. Some experimenters have even used super capacitors to store energy. Using an on-board generator may impact the legal juristictional definition of an electric bicycle. A few types of electric bicycles are able to re-capture energy from braking and can re-charge the batteries while braking or travelling down hills (regenerative braking). With the advent of newer technology further features can be expected.

Some electric bikes have features where the motor can move the bicycle by itself if the rider chooses not to pedal, while others require the rider to pedal at all times. (see the Wikipedia article motorized bicycle).

The conversion of a bicycle to electric power is probably the lowest cost means of learning conversion methods. Battery packs are usually lead acid gel cells since these are available in small sizes suitable for this application. It is also practical to experiment with more expensive battery types since only a small pack is required. It is possible to repurpose battery packs and chargers intended for powering toys and similar small electrical devices.


[edit] Electric Scooter
 
ScooterNot typically suitable for on the road use these may be configured for either standing or sitting use


[edit] Electric motorcycle
 
MotorcycleA specialty niche, this can offer an opportunity to build a relatively low cost electric vehicle. Most of these use a two wheel configuration, although the two types of three wheel vehicle (and sometimes four wheel vehicles) are classified as motorcycles in many jurisdictions if their weight is sufficiently low (typically around 1000 pounds maximum). If a tricycle layout is employed the single wheel should be at the back, with normal automotive type front wheel steering, as the single wheel forward type is notoriously unstable in handling.


[edit] Economy coupe
A light vehicle can make an excellent choice if care is taken in component selection and placement and use restrictions are accepted. It is possible to obtain conversion kits for some popular light vehicles, most notably the rear motor, rear drive Volkswagen &quot;Beetle&quot;, its &quot;Type 3&quot; evolution, and its successor, the front motor/drive VW &quot;Rabbit&quot;. One should not expect to convert such a vehicle and then use it to transport four full size (or oversize) adults - the cars simply do not have the safe load carrying capacity for that. Instead, count on simply removing the rear seat to obtain space for light luggage. Rear wheel drive vehicles are especially suitable for high performance applications as the weight transfer due to acceleration will increase the traction on the driven wheels.

By converting a light vehicle it is possible to use a smaller motor, which both weighs and costs less than a larger motor. Lighter overall vehicle weight will reduce power consumption in start and stop traffic and so increase range in many practical driving conditions.

(At least one commercial converter, Solectria, has converted the front wheel drive General Motors Metro for electric use, creating the Solectria Force.)


[edit] Compact sedan or coupe
A compact sedan, compared to a subcompact, may have better load capacity and more room for battery placement. But, it is also heavier, and will generally have higher wind drag. This means, compared to a subcompact, they will require larger and more expensive motors, a more expensive controller, and more batteries ( higher weight and cost) . Some commercial EV Conversions use vehicles in this size range. One example is a 1992 Honda Civic (http://www.austinev.org/evalbum/542.html). In this conversion, the back seat was retained, and there is still enough room to sink nine flooded lead acid batteries low in the trunk where the spare tire was located, as well as another nine batteries under the hood. With suspension modifications, (increasing shock length &amp; spring rating), one will want to make certain that the vehicle is below GVWR to avoid an illegal and dangerous situation. The car should never be driven if the total vehicle weight is above the GVWR, or if either axle weight is above the maximum designed load for that axle. ( This is typically listed in the glove box, or on one of the door sills of the car)


[edit] Full size sedan
Full size sedans and minivans are generally considered to be less attractive candidates for EV conversion than smaller cars. It may be easier to obtain upgraded components for some smaller vehicles, since these may be used for sports racing (particularly autocross). Starting with a heavy vehicle and adding batteries will result in poor performance in acceleration, handling, braking, and economy of operation.


[edit] Sports car
For a person interested in sports car performance a satisfying conversion will likely lead to a number of difficulties in such details as battery disposition, as such vehicles generally have available space distributed in small volumes around the vehicle. This leads to complexity in securing and wiring batteries. Such vehicles can offer stunning performance in the lower speed ranges owing to light weight and rear wheel drive and may also offer good range from their superior aerodynamics.

By far the most often converted sports car is the Porsche 914 from the early 1970's. An unusually robust chassis, combined with a large interior storage volume for batteries has made this the vehicle of choice for many successful conversions.


[edit] Light truck
Light trucks are especially suitable for hobbyist conversion owing to the fact that it is easy to locate batteries remote from the passenger compartment and there is a good load handling capacity for the use of heavy batteries such as the flooded lead-acid batteries commonly used in golf carts. Light trucks also offer substantial utility in use simply because they are trucks. Even if a portion of the weight capacity is removed by the presence of batteries within the cargo bed, much of the spacial utility remains. A light truck is highly recommended as a first conversion effort owing to the simplicity of component layout. A simple conversion example: http://www.campbellot.com/electric-s10/.


[edit] Hotrod
While this type of vehicle is usually made to be a &quot;street legal&quot; performance machine it may also be developed for occasional use as a drag racing vehicle. The leading vehicle in this field was a Mazda RX-7 ([4]) sports car converted from rotary engine to electric. This vehicle can outrun Dodge Viper sports cars in quarter mile drag races. Faster still is John Wayland's White Zombie ([5]). This conversion of a 1972 Datsun 1200 sedan is currently the world's quickest &amp; fastest Street legal car(in the 1/4 mile, per NEDRA).


[edit] Autocross racer
EVs may prove to be especially suitable for autocross contests as low speed acceleration is especially important to success in this type of racing. Specific classes for electric autocross (called &quot;electrocross&quot; )are being introduced in some venues. Vehicles for these will typically be economy car conversions or custom built chassies but with excess rear weight bias to allow agile handling under the control of an experienced driver (such rearward balance may be dangerous for everyday use).


[edit] Drag racer
Intended only for specialized straight line quarter mile (acceleration) racing this type of vehicle is used only &quot;off road&quot; at specialized &quot;drag strips&quot;.


[edit] High speed straight line racer
Even more specialized than the drag racer this is intended to obtain high speeds on long, straight, and flat raceways, such as the dry lakebeds found in locations such as the Bonneville Salt Flats


[edit] Custom chassis
Suitable for a builder who is capable of constructing a kit car, with good abilities and equipment in machining and welding this can result in a unique vehicle. It is especially suitable for the construction of a lightweight vehicle that can offer exceptional performance.


[edit] Other trucks - full size and most SUVs
These are rarely converted due to their excessive weight, and inefficiencies (namely due to poor aerodynamics). To make the situation worse, many modern trucks/SUVs continue to get bulkier and heavier . As a direct result, the payload carrying capacity and thus the GVWR of the vehicles goes down. Such a trait is not desireable because it limits the weight of the battery pack that can be carried, limiting the maximum battery-to-vehicle weight ratio that could be achieved for the vehicle when converted to an EV. For a given battery type, reducing the battery-to-vehicle weight ratio always results in reduced vehicle range per charge. However, despite these mostly unavoidable limitations, several SUVs and larger trucks have been successfully converted to electric power by hobbyists. Some examples include the &quot;Gone Postal&quot; van converted to an EV racer by Roderick Wilde and Suckamps EV Racing, the 1971 Land Rover EV converted by Wilde Evolutions, and the 1988 Jeep Cherokee EV converted by Nick Viera.

Delta Examples make no sense it first states 'Delta, the letter you might expect to sound like D, actually sounds like th in &quot;this&quot;'

then goes on listing D based words e.g.  Ireland, Canada, Holland, Andorra, Denmark, India, Jordan
Isn't that a complete contradiction? to the fact that it doesn't sound like a D yet uses words containing D for examples?

^This is what I thought as well. These examples completely contradict the preceding explanation of the letter Δ.

      <comment>/* Dynamic microphones */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Acoustics microphone design and operation.JPG|center]]

== Introduction ==
Microphones are devices which convert pressure fluctuations into electrical signals.  There are two main methods of accomplishing this task that are used in the mainstream entertainment industry.  They are known as dynamic microphones and condenser microphones.  Piezoelectric crystals can also be used as microphones but are not commonly used in the entertainment industry.  For further information on piezoelectric transducers [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Acoustic:Piezoelectric_Transducers Click Here].

== Dynamic microphones ==
This type of microphone coverts pressure fluctuations into electrical current.  These microphones work by means of the principle known as Faraday’s Law.  The principle states that when an electrical conductor is moved through a magnetic field, an electrical current is induced within the conductor.  The magnetic field within the microphone is created using permanent magnets and the conductor is produced in two common arrangements.
  
[[File:Moving coil.JPG|thumb|300px|Figure 1: Sectional View of Moving-Coil Dynamic Microphone]]

The first conductor arrangement is made of a coil of wire.  The wire is typically copper and is attached to a circular membrane or piston usually made from lightweight plastic or occasionally aluminum.  The impinging pressure fluctuation on the piston causes it to move in the magnetic field and thus creates the desired electrical current.  Figure 1 provides a sectional view of a moving-coil microphone.

[[Image:Ribbon.jpg|thumb|300px|Figure 2: Dynamic Ribbon Microphone]]

The second conductor arrangement is a ribbon of metallic foil suspended between magnets.  The metallic ribbon is what moves in response to a pressure fluctuation and in the same manner, an electrical current is produced.  Figure 2 provides a sectional view of a ribbon microphone.  In both configurations, dynamic microphones follow the same principles as acoustical transducers.

== Condenser microphones ==
This type of microphone converts pressure fluctuations into electrical potentials through the use of changing an electrical capacitor.  This is why condenser microphones are also known as capacitor microphones.  An electrical capacitor is created when two charged electrical conductors are placed at a finite distance from each other.  The basic relation that describes capacitors is:

'''Q=C*V'''

where Q is the electrical charge of the capacitor’s conductors, C is the capacitance, and V is the electric potential between the capacitor’s conductors.  If the electrical charge of the conductors is held at a constant value, then the voltage between the conductors will be inversely proportional to the capacitance.  Also, the capacitance is inversely proportional to the distance between the conductors.  Condenser microphones utilize these two concepts.

[[Image:Condenser.jpg|thumb|600px|Figure 3: Sectional View of Condenser Microphone]]

The capacitor in a condenser microphone is made of two parts: the diaphragm and the back plate.  Figure 3 shows a section view of a condenser microphone.  The diaphragm is what moves due to impinging pressure fluctuations and the back plate is held in a stationary position.  When the diaphragm moves closer to the back plate, the capacitance increases and therefore a change in electric potential is produced.  The diaphragm is typically made of metallic coated Mylar.  The assembly that houses both the back plate and the diaphragm is commonly referred to as a capsule.

To keep the diaphragm and back plate at a constant charge, an electric potential must be presented to the capsule.  There are various ways of performing this operation.  The first of which is by simply using a battery to supply the needed DC potential to the capsule.  A simplified schematic of this technique is displayed in figure 4.  The resistor across the leads of the capsule is very high, in the range of 10 mega ohms, to keep the charge on the capsule close to constant.  

[[Image:Battery_Powered.jpg|thumb|500px|Figure 4: Internal Battery Powered Condenser Microphone]]

Another technique of providing a constant charge on the capacitor is to supply a DC electric potential through the microphone cable that carries the microphones output signal.  Standard microphone cable is known as XLR cable and is terminated by three pin connectors.  Pin one connects to the shield around the cable.  The microphone signal is transmitted between pins two and three.  Figure 5 displays the layout of dynamic microphone attached to a mixing console via XLR cable.  

[[Image:XLR.jpg|thumb|700px|Figure 5: Dynamic Microphone Connection to Mixing Console via XLR Cable]]

'''Phantom Supply/Powering''' (Audio Engineering Society, DIN 45596): The first and most popular method of providing a DC potential through a microphone cable is to supply +48 V to both of the microphone output leads, pins 2 and 3,  and use the shield of the cable, pin 1, as the ground to the circuit.  Because pins 2 and 3 see the same potential, any fluctuation of the microphone powering potential will not affect the microphone signal seen by the attached audio equipment.  This configuration can be seen in figure 6.  The +48 V will be stepped down at the microphone using a transformer and provide the potential to the back plate and diaphragm in a similar fashion as the battery solution.
In fact, 9, 12, 24, 48 or 52 V can be supplied, but 48 V is the most frequent.

[[Image:Powering.jpg|thumb|600px|Figure 6: Condenser Microphone Powering Techniques]]

The second method of running the potential through the cable is to supply 12 V between pins 2 and 3.  This method is referred to as '''T-powering''' (also known as Tonaderspeisung, AB powering; DIN 45595).  The main problem with T-powering is that potential fluctuation in the powering of the capsule will be transmitted into an audio signal because the audio equipment analyzing the microphone signal will not see a difference between a potential change across pins 2 and 3 due to a pressure fluctuation and one due to the power source electric potential fluctuation.

Finally, the diaphragm and back plate can be manufactured from a material that maintains a fixed charge.  These microphones are termed electrets.  In early electret designs, the charge on the material tended to become unstable over time.  Recent advances in science and manufacturing have allowed this problem to be eliminated in present designs.

== Conclusion ==
Two branches of microphones exist in the entertainment industry.  Dynamic microphones are found in the moving-coil and ribbon configurations.  The movement of the conductor in dynamic microphones induces an electric current which is then transformed into the reproduction of sound.  Condenser microphones utilize the properties of capacitors.  Creating the charge on the capsule of condenser microphones can be accomplished by battery, phantom powering, T-powering, and by using fixed charge materials in manufacturing.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Finite State Machines (FSM) and Petri Nets (PN) are conceptual models to represent the discrete interactions in a system.

* A FSM is a conceptual model that represents how ''one single activity'' can change its behaviour over time, reaction to internally or externally triggered events.
* A PN is a conceptual representation of how ''multiple activities'' are coordinated.

FSM's and Petri Nets are at a higher level than the actual software. This means it explains the behavior, but not how it can be implemented. It is an ideal representation, it doesn’t take time delays in account.

==Categories of system complexity==

Systems of different complexity are represented in different ways. An FSM or UML statechart (similar to FSM, but with more possibilities) can only represent a centralized system, so there is no coordination needed with other systems of its type. Examples of systems of this type are a soda machine, an elevator, ...

Systems with distributed hardware and a centralized software state can be represented using Petri Nets. The centralized software coordinates how the different pieces of hardware act on each other.

A system with distributed hardware and distributed software state can also be represented by a Petri Net, but in this case there is no central control unit. The different pieces of hardware have their own software state and they all 'know' the Petri Net. Now the different pieces have to coordinate themselves.

An example of a distributed system is Robocup. This is a soccer game played by robots. Every robot is a system. If there is a control tower coordinating the robots, this is a case of a centralized software state. The control tower itself can be seen as a system of its own, represented by a statechart with states like 'ball controlled by own team', 'ball controlled by other team', ... In each state, the robots have to cooperate in a different way; this is represented by different Petri Nets.

If there is no control tower, each robot has to control itself and they have to coordinate themselves. Each robot then 'knows' the Petri Net and has to make its own decisions, which can introduce some problems. These are handled later in the section 'Petri Net'.

==Finite State Machine==

A finite state machine is a model of discrete behavior, which consists of: a finite number of ''states'', ''transitions'' between two of those states, and ''actions''. A state represents a certain behavior. A transition indicates a state change and is guarded by a condition. An action is a description of an activity that is to be performed. If this action depends on the state, it’s called a Moore machine. If the action is performed when a transition occurs, so when the state and condition are satisfied, it’s called a Mealy machine. Most machines are both a Moore and Mealy machine at the same time.

Some integrated development environments ([[w:integrated development environment|IDE]]) allow a designer to draw a FSM diagram on screen, and then the IDE automatically translates the diagram into a software or FPGA or ASIC implementation. This allows the designer to use a natural way of representation of the system.

===Example 1===
A robot is working at high speed. When someone opens the door to enter the room, the robot continues its work but at a lower speed to guarantee the safety of the person. When the person leaves the room through the door, he/she has to push a button after closing the door. Now the robot can continue its work at high speed.

[[Image:fsm example 1.png]]

Notice that this a Moore machine, because the outputs (actions) are state-based. 

Also notice the fact that there is a difference between reality and the model of the reality. In the model, there is no time needed to check the condition. In reality, it takes some time to check the door-sensor and to check the pushbutton.

===Example 2===

In the train project, the lamps have to light up when the train passes through a tunnel. Although, when the train drives in daylight, the lamps should be dimmed.
Depending on the driving direction, either the white or red light should be working.

[[Image:fsm example 2.png]]

Notice that this a Mealy machine, because the outputs(actions) are input-based.

[[Image:fsm example 3.png|thumb|Example 3]]

===Example 3===

In the train project, the train has to slow down when he takes a turn. The motor has to work harder when to train is riding upon a hill. 
The transitions between states are controlled by beacons. The image shows the possible transitions from/to driving in a straight line, other transitions are possible too.

==UML Statecharts==
{{Main|UML state machine}}

FSM, explained before, is limited in a way. You cannot have two states active at the same moment, next to each other. The UML statechart is an attempt to overcome this limitation while retaining its good features. This is only one of the many graphical representations of a system that are defined in UML.
UML (Unified Modeling Language) is designed to specify, visualize, construct and document software-intensive systems. For more information, we refer to the  [[w:Unified Modeling Language|Wikipedia page]]. 
The essential syntax of statecharts is very much like FSM's. In a statechart, it is possible that there are states within states, so there is a kind of a hierarchical structure. They are called substates and superstates or parentstates.&lt;!--[[Image:branching.png|thumb|Branching]]--&gt;Another possibility is ''concurrent states''. By using ''branching'', a state can be followed by more than one other state. Each transition can be guarded with its own condition. When more than one condition is satisfied, two states can be active at the same moment.

Compared to FSM, the design of an embedded system can be visualised a lot better and less complicated with sub- and superstates. You can see better how the system works and it's also easier for the designer to locate problems and to adapt the system.
Because it's a standard, large number of simulation tools are available (StateMate, StateFlow, BetterState...). These simulation tools are just made to check the theoretical system, but you can never be sure that the embedded system will function properly. Available „back-ends“ translate StateCharts into C or VHDL. This enables software or hardware implementations. 

===Example===

A good example to explain the usage of a statechart is a soda machine. The user inserts a quarter and the machine waits until the user has inserted a second quarter.  After the user has chosen his drink, the drink is dispensed. The machine waits again. You have two big states: collecting and dispensing. They have substates because there are different drinks and every time the user inserts a coin a new state is entered. In theory this seems a good visualisation, but in practice there are a lot of other factors. These problems can be solved partially. The bottle could get stuck in the machine, so we make a new state next to the collecting and dispensing part like shown in the figure below.

==Petri Net==
===Introduction===

Petri Net(PN) is an abstract model to show the interaction between asynchronous processes. It is only one of the many ways to represent these interaction. Asynchronous means that the designer doesn't know when the processes start and in which sequence they'll take place. A common manner to visualize the concepts is with the use of places, tokens, transitions and arcs.
We refer to [[w:Petri net|the basics of Petri Net]] for a first introduction in notations. We want to mention that a transition can only fire when there are tokens in every input-place. When it fires, one token is taken from every input-place and every output-place from the transition gets an (extra) token.

[[Image:petrinet.png]]

Places can play the following roles:
*a type of communication medium: the wireless connection in Robocup;
*a buffer: all the robots send messages to each other. When one robot checks the first message, the other incoming information is placed in his memory;
*a geographical location: the environment of a robot, a place he has to go to;
*a possible state or state condition: normal mode and safe mode of a machine(see FSM);

Tokens can play the following roles:
*a physical object: a robot;
*an information object: a message between two robots;
*a collection of objects: the people mover;
*an indicator of a state: the state in which a robot is: defender/attacker;
*an indicator of a condition: a token indicates whether a certain condition is fulfilled (ex. Soccer game starts when the referee gives the signal).

Transitions can play the following roles:
*an event: start a thread, the ''switching'' of a machine from normal to safe mode;
*a transformation of an object: a robot who ''changes'' his role, see further;
*a transport of an object: the ball is ''passed'' between the robots.

An arc connects only places and transitions and indicates the direction in which the token travels.

===Coordination problems===

In a PN, situations can occur where two or more systems wait for each other before an action can take place. This is called a [[w:Deadlock|deadlock]]. It can also occur that a single system has to wait forever at the beginning of a transition because another process has always higher priority. This problem is called ''starvation''. 

In the mathematical model a transition takes no time. In the real world executing a transition takes some time and the sequence or timing of events becomes important. This problem relates to ''race conditions'' or ''race hazards''. When the PN is rather big, these problems are hard to find. 

===Robocup examples===

The problems and solutions that can occur will be introduced using the example Robocup. There has to be communication between the robots to achieve a certain purpose. We suppose that the autonomous robots are perfectly designed, so we use a behavior engineering approach.

When a robot stands on the field his behavior consists of a number of options. With these options and incoming information he decides what he is going to do.

Every robot can do some basic actions:
*stand still
*turn around
*walk
*go to ball
*grab
*pass
*kick the ball
*...

Two or more robots have to work together and therefore there actions have to be synchronized. The designer uses Petri Net as a virtual model to show the interactions.

'''Example''': double pass scenario

When a robot sees an opponent in front of him and there is a teammate close to him, he can set up a double pass action. We refer to the petri net figure in the introduction. With this model, the software in the first robot can communicate with the software in the second robot. Sometimes instructions must wait on an input signal which indicates that the other robot has finished his action. 

[[Image:double pass.jpg]]

There can be problems when the double pass is planned in such a way. When the second robot dribbles and loses the ball, the first robot will wait forever to accept the pass. A better implementation would require continuous communication between the 2 robots. The second robot can tell that he has lost the ball or that he wants to pass to another player.

'''Example''': wrong decision

Robots have to take decisions during the game. It takes some time to check several conditions and during this time the previous decisions can change from true to false. Consequently the robot does a wrong  action. For example: A robot asks the ball. The robot who has the ball has to check two conditions. IF teammate asks ball AND I have the ball THEN give a pass. When this robot has checked the first condition, there can be an opponent who jumps in front of the asking robot, so the robot says he doesn't want the pass anymore. The first robot checks the second condition and he passes the ball which is then intercepted by the opponent. This simple example can be extended by a third condition(IF there's no opponent) 

'''Example''': deadlock situations

* The principle of mutual exclusion says that a resource can only be assigned to one robot. When it isn't, the resource is free. When two robots claim the '''ball'''(=resource) a [[Embedded Control Systems_Design/DesignPatterns#Deadlock|deadlock]] situation can occur because the ball is assigned to two different agents. This problem also relates to a circular wait condition because each robot waits for the other to release the ball.

[[Image:circular wait.jpg]]

* The robots have to play a '''role'''(=resource) in their team. The role allocation can be as follows: primary attacker, offensive supporter, defensive supporter and goalkeeper. The role of goalkeeper is fixed throughout the game. The other three roles are more fluid. The robots signal one another constantly, broadcasting their estimate of the distance between themselves and the ball. Based on the various estimates, the robot that is closest to the ball takes on the role of primary attacker, proceeds towards the ball and tries to kick it towards the opposing team's goal. The offensive supporter also moves towards the ball, but stops before it gets too close. The defensive supporter waits until the ball approaches him (before switching to a primary attacker mode). There can occur problems when assigning those roles to the robots. Consider the role as primary attacker which can be allocated to exactly one robot. If no robots are allocating this resource, the team suffers since no robot will try to move to the ball. If several robots are allocating this resource then the team will suffer as they interfere with one another because they all try to get the ball. Another problem is the time delay which occurs during the switching  between two roles. A robot must first release resources so another robot can take it. Within this time the robot freezes and can't perform an action.

* In a critical situation when the attacker robot loses power, a deadlock situation can occur. The robot can't release his attacker role, so there are no agents who run towards the ball because they can't be primary attacker(the resource isn't released). This problem can be avoided with the communication between the robots or with an automatic release function when the power shuts down.

==Other models==
The previous models have a lot of extensions and variations. Because the list is so elaborate, only a few models are discussed. 

===Colored Petri Nets===

In a colored PN every token is an object with some properties. These properties can change when it travels through the structure. With these properties a certain object can, for example, get priority to other objects. 
Every object has some kind of Finite State Machine to follow and the coordination between the different objects is done by the colored Petri Net. So colored PNs can be considered as a combination of coordination and computation. 

===Communicating sequential processes (CSP)===
Communicating sequential processes ([[w:Communicating sequential processes|CSP]]) is a language, used in computer science, to describe the interaction in concurrent systems. Due to this concurrency, communication is essential. Every &quot;message&quot; is a combination of coordination and communication. This way, a formal verification between the processes is possible.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This chapter explains how to exchange data between two activities that run in parallel, or to synchronize their executions.

== interrupts and ISRs ==
{{chapter stub}}

Interrupts and ISRs (interrupt service routines) are the lowest level of asynchronous activity.
All higher levels are built on this foundation.
In some cases, the RTOS will handle all the low-level details for you.

We discuss interrupt and ISRs in more detail in other chapters --

===Software problems===

When implementing the software code in a robot, there can be problems with synchronous threads. This section gives some bad programming examples in multithreaded systems. It is illustrated in C-code. They are concerned because it is a first step to understand problems which occur do to concurrent engineering on a higher level.


*When a program has a global variable and synchronous threads, thread 1 might be interrupted before the global variable is written and thread 2 might work on ''old data''. This might still be acceptable, but the outcome of the program isn't what the programmer wants.

[[Image:old_information.jpg]]





*When the global variable changes from a positive to a negative value between lines 4 and 8, none of the conditions are true. There's no function call and this can lead to problems.
[[Image:no_execution.jpg]]


*When two threads use the same resources, the principle of ''mutual exclusion'' can be used. This can be implemented with a global variable counter. When the counter is negative one thread is blocked before entering the critical section while the other thread is still executing code within this critical section. The first thread sets the global_variable and the second one uses it to do a calculation. 
[[Image:deadlock.jpg]]

If the first thread decrements the counter and is then preempted, the second thread also decrements the counter and evaluates it afterwards. Both threads can't continue since the counter is at -1 now.
There is a deadlock situation in the executed program.

This problem can also arise at a higher level of abstraction. The deadlock situation in petri nets will be described in the following section.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want to build a form that will allow you to quickly test replacement regular expressions using XQuery's replace function.

== Method ==
We will use an XForms client that has several controls:
# a test input string
# a regular expression to evaluate
# a new string to be used in the replace
# a &quot;submit&quot; trigger (button)

When the submit trigger is pressed, the three strings are sent to the server and the XQuery replace() function will be executed.  The result is an output text area that is returned from the server to the web browser.

This tool will allow you to do things such as test your URL-rewrite rules.

        &lt;/xf:switch&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

== XQuery Replace Tester ==

If you are using eXist, just place this file on the server in the same folder as your XForms test driver.

In the example above I used a test folder on the localhost:

&lt;code&gt;
   http://localhost:8080/exist/rest/db/test/replace/replace.xq
&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;
declare namespace exist = &quot;http://exist.sourceforge.net/NS/exist&quot;; 
declare namespace system=&quot;http://exist-db.org/xquery/system&quot;;
declare namespace request=&quot;http://exist-db.org/xquery/request&quot;;
declare option exist:serialize &quot;method=xml media-type=text/xml indent=yes&quot;;
(: replace demo :)
let $input := request:get-parameter('input', '')
let $pattern  := request:get-parameter('pattern', '')
let $replacement := request:get-parameter('replacement', '')

return
&lt;results&gt;
   &lt;input&gt;{$input }&lt;/input&gt;
   &lt;pattern&gt;{$pattern}&lt;/pattern&gt;
   &lt;replacement&gt;{$replacement}&lt;/replacement&gt;
   &lt;replace-result&gt;{replace($input , $pattern, $replacement)}&lt;/replace-result&gt;
&lt;/results&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Discussion ==

This shows that you can quickly build tools to teach yourself complex functions like regular expression handling.  You can also use the XQuery &lt;b&gt;match&lt;/b&gt; function, which returns true or false if the regular expression matches an input string.

There are two variations of this example that are interesting.  The first is where you replace the input form with a large text area for doing global replacements of large blocks of text.  The second is where you replace the input box with a selection list with common replacement patterns.

      <comment>ReST is the acronym used for Re-Structured Text (an ascii markup format), and is not what should be refered to here. REST is the canonical acronym for Representational State Transfer.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Benefits of XRX Architecture ==

XRX benefits from each of its three underlying standards

* [[w:XForms|XForms]]
** Unlike technologies such as AJAX, XRX assumes a [[w:Model-view-controller|model-view-controller]] architecture
** XForms supports a [[w:Dependency graph|dependency graph]] that allows the right views to be automatically updated
** All interactions between the client and the server are sent through the model via submission elements
* [[w:REST|REST]]
** XRX takes advantage of web infrastructure such as multi-level caching and technologies that are collectively known as deep REST systems.
* [[w:XQuery|XQuery]]
** XQuery is a functional XML-oriented query and transform language that can perform the business logic for many systems.  In addition to its XML transform capabilities, it has advantages over older query languages such as SQL designed in the 1970s and 1980s.  XQuery has the expressive power of SQL (joins etc) and can also manipulate recursive hierarchical data structures.  Unlike SQL, XQuery is a W3C standard with very strong standardization across vendors and over 14,000 tests to ensure cross vendor compatibility.  Developers frequently develop XQuery applications on low-cost OpenSource databases and port them to commercial systems without significant changes.

Together, these three standards allow developers to use a single data format (XML) on the client, middle tier and the databases server.  This means there is no translation of the data formats between layers.  In contrast to this, many other modern systems communicate using XML, process business logic in an object-oriented layer, store data in a relational database, and render a GUI as HTML.  

Consider all the &quot;glue&quot; code in a typical modern system, which serves no purpose other than to translate from one representation to another:  object-relational mappings, HTML rendering code, XML import/export code.  These web application architectures take HTML forms (which use flat key-value pairs), convert these data structures to middle tier objects such as Java or .Net and then transform the objects into tabular data streams so they can be stored in relational databases.  Once in the relational database the data must then be re-serialized by doing SELECT statements, converted into objects and the objects then converted back into HTML forms.  This is a four-step translation architecture.

In contrast, XRX uses a zero-translation architecture.  Zero translation implies that XML is stored in the web client, transmitted to a middle tier validation rules engine in XML and then stored in its entirety in an XML database.  Typically, XML is also the format that data is delivered or streamed in from other systems.  The storage as XML is also known as a zero-shredding process since the data files are not separated into [[w:Third normal form|Third Normal Form]] (3NF) data structures.  

This relational (3NF) storage is often not helpful.  XML data has the relationships built into the data, whereas relational data is stored in &quot;dumb&quot; tables and allows/requires the applications to specify the relationships.  For applications where the relationships are well known (e.g. a user has a collection of blog posts, and those posts have collections of comments and replies) XML is better.  When a &quot;data warehouse&quot; is needed and the relationships will vary widely based on the calling application, a relational store may be better because RDBs are optimized for ad-hoc joins where XML DBs are generally not.  (e.g. a group of users are in a social network and there are a variety of ad-hoc relationships that *all* must be queried quickly - use an RDB).  XML databases are optimized for the relationships built into the XML, relational databases are optimized for easy programming and performance on one preferred set of relationships.

The biggest difference, though, is zero-translation vs. &quot;translation everywhere.&quot;

== 1+1+1=10 ==
Using a combination of all these three standards gives web developers a tenfold increase in productivity

====Inorganic Chemistry====
I have a rather long list of requests for importing from wikipedia, but then, Inorganic Chemistry happens to be a lot of factual matter.

*[[w:Molecular_orbital_theory]] &amp;rarr; [[Transwiki:Molecular orbital theory]]
*[[w:Molecular_orbital_diagram]] &amp;rarr; [[Transwiki:MO diagram]]
*[[w:Lewis_structure]] &amp;rarr; [[Transwiki:Lewis structure]]
*[[w:Orbital_hybridization]] &amp;rarr; [[Transwiki:Orbital hybridisation]]
*[[w:VSEPR_theory]] &amp;rarr; [[Transwiki:VSEPR theory]]

These articles serve primarily encyclopaedic content but can serve as a starting point for the [[Inorganic Chemistry]] - Chemical Bonding module.

::I noticed that not all images are not locally avaiable, like the portait of G N Lewis on the [[Inorganic Chemistry/Chemical Bonding/Lewis Dot Structures]] Is this some flaw or was intentionally done? Am i allowed to create copies of the images on wikipedia on wikibooks as well? --[[User:Thewinster|Thewinster]] ([[User talk:Thewinster|talk]]) 19:49, 27 March 2008 (UTC)

:::Those would be images that were uploaded to Wikipedia rather than to the Commons.  You can copy them from Wikipedia to the Commons yourself if you like.  Basically, you'll need to find the full resolution image on Wikipedia and save it to your local PC.  Then log into the Commons and click the upload link.  You will be presented with a set of choices, one of which is &quot;It is from another Wikimedia project&quot; - that's the one you'll want.  That will take you to a page with a form.  At the top of the page will be a link to &quot;the CommonsHelper tool&quot; which is very useful for capturing info about the picture.  I'm sure you can figure the rest out by reading the prompts, but if you run into trouble, please ask.  There's prolly a page about this process somewhere.  Hope that helped.  --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 21:01, 27 March 2008 (UTC)

::::Thanks for the info. I could have figured out a lot of it myself once i was told those images were not on commons. But the whole reply was bubbling with enthusiasm! :D Thanks for the &quot;from other wikiedia project&quot; bit! --[[User:Thewinster|Thewinster]] ([[User talk:Thewinster|talk]]) 16:52, 28 March 2008 (UTC)

:I don't think this should be imported to Wikibooks. Some of the reasons for suggesting its deletion on Wikipedia apply here as well. This seems to be original research, which means there probably isn't going to be a realistic way to independently verify what is being written isn't just being made up. I think this would be more appropriate for Wikiversity which does allow original research. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 12:49, 26 June 2008 (UTC)

:: It seems that a wikibook on this topic would be some sort of a manual. [[Question Writer 3 Manual]] may be a precedence. A number of wikibooks require some leniency on the original research clause.
:: The noteriety issue may be a tougher sticking point. I'd be willing to overlook that if there was the chance that it might develop into a good wikibook. There isn't much on that Wikipedia page; how about dropping the import request, being bold and just starting the book? --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 16:00, 26 June 2008 (UTC)

::: Question Writer 3 is a software program that has plenty of existing material available that I can find by a Google search, so I don't see the precedence there. My concern is that there appears to be little if any material that documents the mKR programming language that could be used to determine if a book written on Wikibooks about it is factually accurate, complete garbage or being invented as the person goes. It is in that sense that it is original research because it cannot be verified either way. I don't think it meets Wikibooks' inclusion requirements, but it does Wikiversity's. Other books that have had similar problems have been deleted as well. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 16:56, 26 June 2008 (UTC)

:::: Good points. I chose to point to Question Writer 3 since I stumbled across [[User:Hskeet]]'s comment on Whiteknight's [[User_talk:Whiteknight#Thank_you_for_your_offer_of_help|talk page]] where he explanes that he had &quot;been commissioned to write the manual by the owners/developers of the software&quot;. It seems that the principle author of that Wikipedia article is also the software author. In a sense that would be a pretty solid proof of validity, but naturally, that would not guarantee future edits.
:::: I'd like to see wikibooks embrace manuals like these, but not without ensuring verifiability. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 17:28, 26 June 2008 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">After a while, it gets rather tedious to
cut and paste into the Sway interpreter.
A more efficient method is to store
your program in a text file and then 
load the file.

I use ''vim'' as my text editor. Vim is
an editor that was written by programmers
for programmers (emacs is another such
editor) and serious Computer Scientists
and Programmers should learn vim (or emacs).

==Your first program==

Create a text file named hello.s. The
name really doesn't matter and doesn't
have to end in .s (the .s is a convention
to remind us this file contains Sway source
code). Place in the file

    println(&quot;hello, world!&quot;);

Save your work and exit the text editor.
Now execute the following command at the
system prompt (not the Sway interpreter prompt!):

    sway hello.s

You should see the phrase:

    hello, world!

displayed on your console. Here's a trace using Linux:

    lusth@warka:~$ sway hello.s
    hello, world!
    lusth@warka:~$

The &lt;tt&gt;lusth@warka:~$&lt;/tt&gt; is my system prompt.

==A Neat Macro==

One of the more useful things you can do is set up a vim 
macro. Edit (or create) the file .exrc in your home directory and
add these lines:

    set ai sm sw=4
    map @ :!sway %^V^M

The first line sets some useful parameters: autoindent and showmatch.
The &lt;tt&gt;sw=4&lt;/tt&gt; sets the indentation to four spaces.
The next line makes the '@' key,
when pressed,
run the Sway interpreter on
the file you are currently editing (save your work first before
tapping the @ key). The ^V^M part of the macro is not the four
characters ^ V ^ M, but two characters &lt;Ctrl&gt;-v and &lt;Ctrl&gt;-m.
It's just when you type &lt;Ctrl&gt;-v&lt;Ctrl&gt;-m, it will display as
^V^M.

==Writing Sway Programs==

A typical Sway program is composed of two sections. The first
section is composed of variable and function definitions.
The next section is composed of statements, which are Sway
expressions, each of which is (usually) followed by a 
semicolon.

The '''''hello.s'''' file above was a program with no
definitions and a single statement. A Sway program composed
only of definitions will usually run with no output to the
screen. Such programs are usually written for the express
purpose of being included
into other programs.

Typically, one of the function definitions is a function
named ''main'' (by convention); this function takes no
arguments.  The last line of the program is a call to main.
Here is a rewrite of hello.s using that convention.

    function main()
        {
        println(&quot;hello, world!&quot;);
        }

    main();

This version's output is exactly the same as the previous version.

==Order of definitions==

A function or variable must be defined before it is used. This 
program will generate an error:

    var x = y * y;
    var y = 3;

since ''x'' can't be given a value until ''y'' is defined.
This program is legal, however:

    function x()
        {
        y() * y();
        }

    function y()
        {
        3;
        }

    x();

because even though the body of function ''x'' refers to
function ''y'', function ''y'' is defined by the time
function ''x'' is called (the last statement of the program).

== Including code ==

One can include one Sway module into another by use of the ''include''
function:

    include(&quot;moduleX.s&quot;);

where '''''moduleX.s''''' is the name of the file whose Sway definitions
you wish to include. Including a module imports all the top level
definitions in that module. The statements beyond the definitions in
the included module are ignored and are not evaluated.

If '''''moduleX.s''''' has includes, those modules will be
included as well.

== Preventing multiple includes ==

Sometimes, in a complex implementation, a module can get included
more than once. Usually, this results in multiple definitions of
the same item and, while wasteful, usually does not cause any harm.
However,
consider the case where one module includes the
other and vice versa.
Here is an example. 
One module, '''''fact.s''''',
has the following implementation:

    include(&quot;fib.s&quot;);
    function fact(n)
        {
        if (n &lt; 2,1,n * fact(n - 1));
        }
    println(&quot;fib(5) is &quot;,fib(5));
    println(&quot;fact(5) is &quot;,fact(5));

The other module, '''''fib.s''''', has this code:

    include(&quot;fact.s&quot;);
    function fib(n)
        {
        if (n &lt; 2,v,fib(n - 2) * fib(n - 1));
        }
    println(&quot;fib(6) is &quot;,fib(6));
    println(&quot;fact(6) is &quot;,fact(6));

Trying to run Sway on either module results in an
out of memory error, since each file
gets included over and over
('''''fib.s''''' includes '''''fact.s'''''
which includes '''''fib.s''''' and so on).
One can prevent multiple includes by using
the ''includeOnce'' function. Here is a rewrite of each module.

=== fact.s ===

    includeOnce(fib.s,&quot;fib.s&quot;);
    function fact(n)
        {
        if (n &lt; 2,1,n * fact(n - 1));
        }
    println(&quot;fib(5) is &quot;,fib(5));
    println(&quot;fact(5) is &quot;,fact(5));

=== fib.s ===

    includeOnce(fact.s,&quot;fact.s&quot;);
    function fib(n)
        {
        if (n &lt; 2,v,fib(n - 2) * fib(n - 1));
        }
    println(&quot;fib(6) is &quot;,fib(6));
    println(&quot;fact(6) is &quot;,fact(6));

Running the '''''fact.s''''' program yields:

    fib(5) is 5
    fact(5) is 120

while running the '''''fib.s''''' program yields:

    fib(6) is 8
    fact(6) is 720

The first argument passed to the ''includeOnce''
function must be a variable, but this variable
does not necessarily have to be defined.
The ''includeOnce'' function checks to see if its
first argument has already been defined.
If the variable already exists, no further action is
taken.
If not, ''includeOnce'' defines it with a value of
&lt;tt&gt;:true&lt;/tt&gt; and
then includes the module named by the second argument.
Due to Sway's lax naming rules for variable names,
most file names (including Unix style paths)
without spaces are legal variable names.
By convention,
the variable name given to ''includeOnce'' is the name of the file containing the module; though
any variable name will suffice. If there is a name clash, however, and the variable is already
declared through some other means, the given module will not be included.
The ''includeOnce'' function only checks to see if the first
argument 
is defined in the current local scope,
so the check against multiple includes will not
work if you include once again at a different scope level.

The ''include'' and ''includeOnce'' function are the only functions that
are considered definitions and thus can appear in the definition area
of a Sway module. It is legal, however, to call either
function in an expression, as in:

    x = includeOnce(:module1.s,&quot;module1.s&quot;);

Of course, such calls to ''include'' and
''includeOnce'' are not
part of the definition area. In the following example, only the top level definitions from
modules B and C are included in A.

=== A.s ===

    include(&quot;B.s&quot;);
    ...

=== B.s ===

    include(&quot;C.s&quot;);
    var x;
    x = include(&quot;D.s&quot;);

The definitions from module '''''D.s''''' are not included
into '''''A.s''''' since only the
definition area of
'''''B.s''''' is included in '''''A.s'''''
(which causes an include of '''''C.s''''').
The call to include '''''D.s''''' is in the
expression area and is ignored when '''''B.s''''' is included.

==Sulphides==
===Sodium Nitroprusside===
Use [[w:Sodium Nitroprusside|Sodium Nitroprusside]]. In the presence of [[w:sulphide|sulphide]] ions a deep violet coloration is formed. [Fe(CN)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;NOS]&lt;sup&gt;4-&lt;/sup&gt; complex anion formed in the presence of sulphide ions is the cause for this coloration.
===Silver Nitrate===
If the salt is reacted with Silver Nitrate,it forms a black precipitate of Ag2S.

===Lead Ethanoate===

If the substance is soluble use [[w:lead acetate|lead acetate]] solution, if solid add dilute [[w:hydrochloric acid|hydrochloric acid]] and test the gas with lead acetate paper. If the salt in question is a sulphide an acrid smell of rotten eggs will be observed and the lead acetate will turn black.
(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Pb + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S -&gt; PbS + 2(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH)

===H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S===
'''The following two points do not fall in place here, kindly arrange them wherever they are best fit:'''

* When H2S is bubbled through a solution of Sodium sulphite or Sodium bisulphite, a white turbidity of sulphur is seen. What happens is, the s atom in sulphite/bisulphite (Oxidation state +5) and in H2S (Oxidation state -2) have coproportionated to give molecular sulphur in zero oxidation state. The reaction can be viewed as the reverse of a disproportionation reaction.

* When H2S is bubbled through acidified KMnO4 solution, it decolorizes and a white turbidity is observed. This is because, the powerful oxidizing agent permanganate ion has oxidized the sulphide ion (-2) to zero oxidation state. In doing so, the permanganate ions themselves reduce to Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions, thus the purple/violet/pink color of the solution is diluted and eventually fades away as the manganous ions do not impart any color to the solution.

==The nitrite ion==
The nitrite ion gives several reactions based on its redox properties.

===I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-===
When it reacts with the I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;- anion, the nitrite ion reduces itself to nitric oxide. The student should check the oxidation states of nitrogen in both the cases.

NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; + 2I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; + 2H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; --&gt; NO(g) + 3I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(aq) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(l)

The yellow color of the I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;- ions changes to a greenish tinge which later turns violet. This observation is made in the presence of an oxidizing agent which oxidizes iodine from -⅓ to 0. The O.A. in our case is of course, the nitrite ion!

Before turning violet, a greenish tinge is observed because the increasing concentration of violet color and the decreasing concentration of yellow color during the reaction impart a greenish color.

===Lead/Silver Nitrates===
Most lead and silver anions show much the same characteristics in analysis.  However, lead nitrite is soluble while silver nitrite is an insoluble white solid.

Therefore, to test for the presence of nitrite ions we can use silver and lead nitrate.  No precipitate will be observed with lead nitrate, but a white precipitate will form when silver nitrate is added.

2NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; + Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; -&gt; Pb(NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(aq)

NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; + Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; -&gt; AgNO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(s)

==The cyanide ions==
===Ferric ions===
When ferric ions are added to a solution of cyanide ions, no specific change in color is observed. However, if we add the ferric ions to the solution after adding thiosulphate or S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;, we get a blood red coloration of ferric thiocyanate.

Ferric thiocyanate is Fe(SCN)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

Actually, this is a characteristic test for the presence of ferric ions and for thiocyanate ions. Cyanide ions are nowhere directly involved in the formation of ferric(III) thiocyanate. If we review the test procedure for the detection of cyanide ions, we find that we add, according to our choice, either thiosulphate ions or S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt; ions. These ions disproportionate in the presence of cyanide ions, forming thiocyanate ions. It is these thiocyanate ions that eventually react with the added ferric ions to give the blood red complex formation

CN&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; + S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt; -&gt; SCN&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; + SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;

CN&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; + S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sub&gt; -&gt; SCN&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; + S&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;

Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; + SCN&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; -&gt; Fe(SCN)&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;

===Metallic copper===
It is a popular fact that most metals react with either water or dilute acid solution to liberate hydrogen. This is a redox reaction in which the metal acts as a reducing agent, reducing the proton or hydrogen in water to hydrogen gas, oxidizing itself to a metal cation.

A classic example of this type of redox reaction is the reaction of metallic sodium with water. The reaction takes place and liberates enough heat to melt the sodium which then floats on a cushion of hydrogen gas. e.g., 2Na + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O -&gt; H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2NaOH. In terms of the ions involved in the reaction Na -&gt; Na&lt;sup&gt;1+&lt;/sup&gt; + e&lt;sup&gt;1-&lt;/sup&gt; and then 2H&lt;sup&gt;1+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2e&lt;sup&gt;1-&lt;/sup&gt; -&gt; H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The same reaction occurs with any of the alkali metals in exactly the same way.

However, there are some metals like copper which will not react with either water or dilute acids in the same way. Quantitatively, Standard Electrode Potential is lower than that of hydrogen ions, meaning that more energy is required to form copper ions than the hydrogen ions can provide. [Note to editors --&gt; Is this any better?]

However, if we add metallic copper to a solution containing cyanide ions, copper gives into the greed of forming that ultrastable cyano complex of itself. That is, equilibrium favours the formation of tetracyanocomplexcuprate(I) ions. This is the point - in presence of cyanide ions, copper oxidizes itself to form the +1 metal complex. But then, if an oxidation has occurred so must have a reduction. What is the reduction reaction? The formation of hydrogen (editors - formation from what? proton or water molecule?) is the involved reduction.

'''We conclude that an aqueous solution of KCN dissolves metallic copper, generally administered as copper turnings through, the formation of tetracyanocuprate(I) ions.'''

(Note to editors --&gt; Explain this anamlolous behaviour of copper through the quantitative aspects of electrochemistry and chemical equilibrium, short enough to maintain interest.)

====Note on the tetracyano complex of copper====
When H2S is bubbled through the cyano complex of ferrous/ferric/cuprous/cupric ions, no sulphide is precipitated. While with most other metal cations, metal sulphide does get precipitated.

e.g. tetracyanocadmiumate ions give CdS with H2S and dicyanoargentate (silver complex) give Ag2S.

This can be explained on the basis of equilibrium constants - solubility products and formation constants of the concerned sulphides and cyanocomplexes. (note to editors --&gt; plz explain in a little more detail)

==The hypochlorite ion==
Adding a solution containing lead ions, such as lead nitrate, to a hypochlorite solution produces a brown precipitate of lead(IV) oxide.

2ClO&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; (aq) + Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (aq) → PbO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (s) + 2Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; (aq)

==The azide ion==
On adding triiodide ions, the azide ion oxidizes to nitrogen and decolorisation is observed. . Triiodide ions are reduced to iodide ions, and nitrogen is produced. The colour of solution changes from yellow to colourless and a brisk effervescence is noted.

2N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; -&gt; 3N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2e&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;

I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; + 3e&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; -&gt; 3I&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;

==The acetate ions==
===Dilute hydrochloric acid===
When dilute hydrochloric acid is added to an acetate solution, the acetate ions are acidified with the hydrogen ions of the hydrochloric acid, forming acetic acid which produces an observable smell of vinegar.

===Esterification===
When a drop of concentrated sulphuric acid and ethanol are added, the distinctive smell of an ester can be observed. This applies to all carboxylates, but is particularly useful in this case because the two reactants, acetic acid and ethanol, have distinctive smells which are replaced the completely different smell of the ester; in this case, ethyl acetate, which smells not unlike glue or nail polish remover.

CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH + CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH -&gt; CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;0

(The sulphuric acid is not shown as it is merely a catalyst, specifically a dehydrating agent.)

===Ferric Chloride===
When added to neutral FeCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; acetates produce a red coloration.

FeCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 3CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH -&gt; (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COO)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Fe + 3HCl

Neutral FeCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is prepared by taking about an mL of FeCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in a test tube and adding about an mL of NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;OH to give a red precipitate. Dil. HCl is added to the test tube till the precipitate has JUST dissolved. The resultant solution is added to the salt solution containing acetate to give a red colouration. The acetate ion is confirmed by adding water to this mixture and warming till formation of red precipitate.

==Thiosulphates==
Thiosulphates are reducing agents. They can reduce I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; ions to iodide ions which are colorless. However, it should be noted that this is not a confirmatory test as any reducing agent can do this.

2S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt; -&gt; S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt; + 2e

I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; +2e -&gt; 3I&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;

===Hydronium ions===
Adding dilute acid to a solution with thiosulphate ions yields a solution with precipitate, elemental sulfur, and release a burnt rubber smell (gaseous sulphur dioxide)

2H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; -&gt; S&lt;sub&gt;(s)&lt;/sub&gt; + SO&lt;sub&gt;2(g)&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;(l)&lt;/sub&gt;

===Ferric ions===
It also produces a momentary violet coloration with ferric ions.
---&gt;Expand&lt;--

===Copper Sulphate===
With copper sulphate, a white ppt. is obtained which dissolves in excess of thiosulphate to produce a colorless solution through the formation of a stable complex.

CuSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; -&gt; CuS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;

This test has to be carried out in such a way that initially the concentration of thiosulphate is low which then gradually increases enough to form the complex. The solution containing thiosulphate should be poured into the copper sulphate to prevent the changes being missed.

===Silver Nitrate===
This is a very peculiar reaction, because on the surface it seems as if the precipitate obtained is changing colors!

What actually happens is that when we add silver nitrate, a white ppt of silver thiosulphate is formed. This silver thiosulphate disproportionates to give silver sulphide and sulphuric acid, wherein as we know, silver sulphide is black. That is, on adding silver nitrate a white precipitate is obtained which changes to brown and finally to black.

S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt; + 2AgNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; -&gt; 2NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; + Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(s) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(l) -&gt; H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(aq) + Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S

Furthermore, in the presence of excess of thiosulphate ions the white ppt of Silver thiosulphate dissolves giving a colorless complex.

==Thiocyanate ions==
SCN&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; ions have been discussed once in the testing of cyanide ions.

In fact, one of the characteristic tests for thiocyanate ions is the same reaction that we discussed over there.

===Ferricthiocyanate===
With ferric ions, thiocyanate ions give a blood red coloration of Fe(SCN)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. This test is NOT given by ferrous ions - and hence is confirmatory for the presence of both ferric ions and for thiocyanate ions.

--&gt;Check lingo&lt;--
===Vogel's test===
If Co&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions are added to the thiocyanate ions a blue solution of tettrathiocyanatocobaltate is obtained. This complex on addition mercuric ions gives a Blue crystalline precipitate.

This ppt is NOT Mercuric tetrathiocyanatocobaltate! It is interesting to note that the actual precipitate is an isomer of the expected ppt - it is Cobalt(II) Tetrathiocyanatomercurate(II), that is the metal cations have switched places.

&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;If no effervescence is obtained with dilute HCl, heat the salt with Conc. H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;Sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;

The following ions belong to this list:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/B&gt;

==Fluorides==
===Evolution of HF===
When we add concentrated sulphuric acid to fluoride ions, they are protonated to give hydrogen fluoride. This is because hydrogen fluoride is a weak acid, its anion 
F&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; can be protonated back to the gas.

F&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; -&gt; HF + HSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;

--&gt;Note: Add equilibrium related discussion&lt;--

The question is, how do we know that HF has evolved? When we hold a glass rod at the mouth of the testtube, a white waxy deposit is obtained on the glass rod. This is because of the reaction of HF with Silica. (Glass rod - is of course nearly all silica!).

HF(g) + SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(s) -&gt; SiF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(g) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;0(l)

The silicon fluoride gas is easily hydrolyzed by the water released, and we get hydrogen silicofluoride and hydrogen silicate - the mixture which is the white waxy deposit in question.

3SiF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(g) + 4H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;0(l) -&gt; 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SiF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)(s) + H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(s)

Question:  Is is possible to detect HF or F&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; using Ca(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;?

2 F&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt; (aq)&lt;/sub&gt; + Ca(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; -&gt; CaF&lt;sub&gt;2 (s)&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt; (aq)&lt;/sub&gt;

===Oxidation of fluorides===
In this particular test, We added conc. H2SO4. H2SO4 is an oxidizing agent. When it is added to a fluoride salt, does it oxidize to molecular fluorine? Let us think for a second. Yes, we accept that Conc. H2SO4 is a pretty strong oxidizing agent, but the question is, is it strong enough to oxidize fluoride ions? The product of oxidation of fluoride ions is molecular fluorine - something which is rarer than anything. Molecular fluorine reacts with almost anything. It causes mayhem wherever it goes. So our answer is no. H2SO4 just can't oxidize fluoride ions into molecular fluorine.

--&gt;Note to editors: This is the purpose of the text - to acquaint the reader with the various facts of chemistry and making them realize their importance in the real life. While this point doesn't exactly point out the high reactivity of fluorine, half a dozen scattered discussions can do enough to hammer this point!

Possible insertions - the problems involved in the electrolytic extraction of fluorine.&lt;--

==Chlorides==
===Conc. H2SO4===
When Conc. H2SO4 is added, chloride salts evolve colorless HCl gas.

Now the presence of this HCl gas can be detected in two ways. The first is to hold an ammonium hydroxide test tube near the neck of the original solution. The HCl gas, if evolved, will react with NH4OH to give dense white fumes of NH4Cl.

Otherwise, we can use MnO2. Manganese in +4 state will be reduced to +2, oxidizing the chlorine in HCl to molecular chlorine gas - Cl2. Pale green (pale because of low concentration) Chlorine gas confirms that HCl was evolved.

===The Silver Nitrate test===
AgCl is a precipitate. So, if a silver nitrate solution is added to a sample of the being tested solution, a white ppt. is obtained. This precipitated Agcl is soluble in an excess of Ammonium Hydroxide soltion because of the formation of [Ag(NH3)2]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; complex ions.

if we note carefully, the ammine complex is the same one that is used in the silver mirror test (Tollen's test) for the detection of aldehydes. The reaction, if we recall, was a redox reaction in which the silver (I) is reduced to metallic (0) silver mirror, and the aldehyde being oxidized to an ate ion.

===The Chromyl Chloride test===
It should be noted that this test is not for a solution containing the solvated ions. Chromyl chloride test is performed on the salt in solid state.

Solid salt is mixed with Solid Potassium Dichromate and Conc. H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. If the salt is a chloride, on heating deep red vapors of Chromyl Chloride (CrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) are evolved.

Some chemists still bear a doubt, because the deep red vapors bear some resemblance to NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; vapors. They can be distinguished, though.

If these Chromyl Chloride vapors are passed through a dilute NaOH solution, it turns yellow. Most of us might have already guessed that the color is due to the formation of the Chromate ions. Indeed, the guess is true. This is then how we resolve our doubts and say that the salt is a chloride.

It is not unwise to note here that most chromates are yellow in color, with the notable exceptions being AgCrO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and Hg(CrO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Both are red!

&lt;B&gt;Predominantly covalent chlorides like HgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and alkyl chlorides do not offer this test.
&lt;/B&gt;
The real confirmation is adding acetic acid followed by lead acetate to the yellow solution which gives a pale yellow precipitate of lead chromate.

==Bromides/Iodides==
===Conc. H2SO4===
With conc. H2SO4, the florides/chlorides gave HF/HCl respectively. However, the bromides and iodides are oxidized to molecular bromine and iodine respectively!

So, in case of the reaction of iodides/bromides with Conc. H2SO4, bromides give deep brown vapors of Br2, while iodides give violet vapors of iodine.

===Silver nitrate solution===
With silver nitrate solution, bromides give a pale yellow ppt. of AgBr which is partially soluble in NH4OH. Iodides give a yellow ppt of AgI which is insoluble in ammonium hydroxide.

--&gt;Explain this point with reference to Solubility Product and formation constant of the concerned compounds. We need not give a numerical explanation! We just want to emphasize that Inorganic Chemistry is not plain mugging up.

===The Chloroform test===
Take the solution and add an equal amount of chloroform/CHCl3 to it. Add chlorine water and shake vigorously. Watch the change in color of the non-aqueous layer.

If iodide/bromide ions are present, they would be oxidized to Iodine/Bromine respectively. Iodine would impart a violet color to the non-aqueous layer while if bromine is created it will give out a reddish color to the non-aqueous layer.

==Oxalate ions==

Oxalate ions are C2O4&lt;sub&gt;--&lt;/sub&gt;

===Conc. H2SO4===
Concentrated sulphuric acid decomposes oxalate ions into Carbon monoxide and carbondioxide. Readers shouldn't take long to realize that the oxalate ions have decomposed through a disproportionation reaction. If the evolution of the two gases is confirmed, we can say that sulphuric acid reacted with oxalate ions.

If the evolved gaseous mixture is passed through limewater, it will turn milky and finally colourless. Carbon Monoxide in the mixture will burn with a blue flame to produce carbon dioxide. The two gases are confirmed in this way, confirming the presence of the oxalate ion.

===Acidified Potassium Permanaganate solution===
Acidified KMnO4 is an oxidizing agent. It will oxidize the oxalate ions into carbon dioxide. In the process, it will decolorize because of the reduction of the violet manganate ions into colorless manganous ions.

Now the question is, how do we know that the decolorization was due to oxalate ions? KMnO4 solution is decolorized each time the managanate ions oxidize ANYTHING.

The answer lies again, in the detection of the carbondioxide gas. Once the gas is confirmed, oxalate ions have been virtually confirmed.

===Calcium chloride solution===
Aqueous solution of oxalate ions give a white precipitate of calcium oxalate which is insoluble in acetic acid.

==Nitrates==
===Decomposition by Heat or Strong Acid===
All nitrate salts are decomposed by heat or dilute sulphuric acid to produce reddish brown fumes of nitrogen dioxide.

2Cu(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(aq) -&gt; 2CuO(aq) + 4NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(g) + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(g)

===The brown ring test===
When a freshly prepared acidified solution of ferrous sulphate is added to a solution of nitrate ions, in the presence of concentrated H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, a deep brown ring is formed.

This deep brown ring is due to the formation of the complex sphere [Fe(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;NO]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. In this form, the Fe ion is in both its +1 and +2 oxidation states, and oscillates between the two. This means that even a slight disturbance in the medium will disturb the complex. It is for this reason that the acidified ferrous sulphate is added drop-wise and allowed to roll down the walls of the test tube, this minimises any disturbance that would destroy the ring. It reacts upon contact with the medium, and forms the mentioned complex, but only at the edges, forming the characteristic brown ring.

The oscillation occurs in the following two ways

i) The NO ion loses an electron to the Fe2+ ion forming Fe&lt;sup&gt;1+&lt;/sup&gt; and NO&lt;sup&gt;1+&lt;/sup&gt;
NO -&gt; NO&lt;sup&gt;1+&lt;/sup&gt; + e&lt;sup&gt;1-&lt;/sup&gt;
Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; + e&lt;sup&gt;1-&lt;/sup&gt;  -&gt; Fe&lt;sup&gt;1+&lt;/sup&gt;

ii) The Fe&lt;sup&gt;1+&lt;/sup&gt; returns the electron to the NO&lt;sup&gt;1+&lt;/sup&gt; forming NO and Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;
Fe&lt;sup&gt;1+&lt;/sup&gt; -&gt; Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; + e&lt;sup&gt;1-&lt;/sup&gt;
NO&lt;sup&gt;1+&lt;/sup&gt; + e&lt;sup&gt;1-&lt;/sup&gt; -&gt; NO

It is worth noting that it is very rare to find iron in its (I) oxidation state, (II) and (III) are much more common

===Reduction to nitrites===
===Reduction to Ammonia===
The NItrate ion can easily be reduced to ammonia with either Devardas Alloy or Aluminium Foil. The aluminium is a very powerful reducing agent, and this combined with heating causes the nitrate ions to form ammonia gas. This can be tested for by holding a piece of damp red litmus paper over the end of the test tube. The ammonia will form alkaline ammonium ions in the water and turn the paper blue.

4NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) + 6H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;0(l) -&gt; 4NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(g) + 9O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(g)

Aluminium powder is not shown as it merely catalyses the reaction.

==Sulphates==
===Barium Chloride===
The addition of a sulphate to a barium chloride solution produces a white precipitate of barium sulphate. This precipitate is very insoluble, not dissolving in any common laboratory reagents.

Magnesium Sulphate + Barium Chloride -&gt; Barium Sulphate + Magnesium Chloride

MgSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(aq) + BaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(aq) -&gt; BaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(s) + MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(aq)

===Lead Nitrate/Lead Acetate===

A similar reaction to the above, a white precipitate of lead sulphate is formed. Again this is very difficult to dissolve in common reagent.

PbNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(aq) + MgSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(aq) -&gt; PbSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(s) + MgNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(aq)

(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Pb(aq) + K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(aq) -&gt; PbSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(s) + 2CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOK(aq)

==Manganate Ion==
===H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S test===
The oxidising properties of potassium manganate allow it to oxidise hydrogen sulphide rapidly from oxidation state (II) to 0, reducing itself to manganese ions. These do not impart any colour to the solution, yet the sulphur precipitate forms a white cloud as the purple colouration of manganate ions disappears.

2S&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt; -&gt; s&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 4e
MnO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt; + 4e&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; -&gt; Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

==Borates==
===Ethyl Alcohol===

==Ortho-Phosphates==
===Ammonium Molybdate===

When added to phosphate ions, warmed with nitric acid, forms a canary yellow precipitate of ammonium phosphomolybdate. Confirmatory test for presence of phosphates.&lt;br/&gt;
PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;sup&gt;3-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; + 12(NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;MoO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 21HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 3H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; -&gt; (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;·12MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;↓ + 21HN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 12H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

==Carbonates and Bi-Carbonates==
We first react it with HCl, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is emitted, so we know it is carbonate or bicarbonate
MgSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is added to the salt solution, white precipitate in cold indicates carbonate and white precipitate on heating confirms bicarbonate

{{Side note|side=right|{{Java Swings/Content}}}}
__NOTOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

In this section, we'll create an application that responds to a user action, namely the pressing of a button.

==The Program==

Last section, we wrote a program that displays a text label along with a button.  In this section, we'll add functionality to the application so that the text changes when the user presses the button.  In order to accomplish this, we'll write a subclass of &lt;code&gt;JLabel&lt;/code&gt; that can change its text, and implements the &lt;code&gt;ActionListener&lt;/code&gt; interface.  Because a JButton generates action events when pushed, we can connect our specialized JLabel to the JButton by registering it as a listener.  Here's the code:

{{XCode|1='''A new listener'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
import java.awt.event.ActionEvent;
import java.awt.event.ActionListener;
import javax.swing.SwingConstants;

// ActionEvent and ActionListener
// live in the java.awt.event
// package

class ChangingLabel extends JLabel implements ActionListener {
    
    // String constants which define the text that's displayed.
    private static final String TEXT1 = &quot;Hello, World!&quot;;
    private static final String TEXT2 = &quot;Hello again!&quot;;
    
    // Instance field to keep track of the text currently
    // displayed

{{XCode|1='''A Swing application with an active button'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
import java.awt.BorderLayout;

import javax.swing.JButton;
import javax.swing.JFrame;

// Application with a changing text field
public class HelloWithButton2 {

        public static void main(String[] args) {
                
                // Constructs the ChangingLabel.  All the
            // intialization is done be the default
            // constructor, defined in the ChangingLabel
            // class below.
                ChangingLabel changingLabel = new ChangingLabel();
                
                // Create the button
                JButton button = new JButton(&quot;Button&quot;);
                
                // Register the ChangingLabel as an action
                // listener to the button.  Whenever the
                // button is pressed, its ActionEvent will
                // be sent the the ChangingLabel's
                // actionPerformed() method, and the code
                // there will be executed.
                button.addActionListener(changingLabel);
                
                // Create the frame
                JFrame frame = new JFrame(&quot;Hello&quot;);
                
                // Add the label and the button to the
                // frame, using layout constants.
                frame.add(changingLabel, BorderLayout.CENTER);
                frame.add(button, BorderLayout.SOUTH);
                
                frame.setSize(300, 300);
                frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
                frame.setVisible(true);
                frame.setLocationRelativeTo(null);
                frame.toFront();
        }
}
&lt;/source&gt;}}

In this application, class &lt;code&gt;ChangingLabel&lt;/code&gt; defines a special type of label that is an action listener (ie, that can receive ActionEvents) by implementing the &lt;code&gt;ActionListener&lt;/code&gt; interface.  It also has the ability to change its text through the private method &lt;code&gt;changeLabel()&lt;/code&gt;.  The &lt;code&gt;actionPerformed()&lt;/code&gt; method just calls &lt;code&gt;changeLabel()&lt;/code&gt; when it receives an ActionEvent.

The main program code in &lt;code&gt;HelloWithButton2&lt;/code&gt; is similar to the code in the last section, but uses a &lt;code&gt;ChangeLabel&lt;/code&gt; instead of an ordinary &lt;code&gt;JLabel&lt;/code&gt; object.  It also registers the ChangeLabel as an &lt;code&gt;ActionListener&lt;/code&gt; of the button with the button's &lt;code&gt;addActionListener()&lt;/code&gt; method.  We can do this because JButtons create ActionEvents, and ChangeLabel is an ActionListener (ie, implements the &lt;code&gt;ActionListener&lt;/code&gt; interface).

There's one thing to notice in the above example.  Two classes are defined, one to contain the program code in the static main() method, and another that defines a type used in the program.  However, there's no reason that we can't put the &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt; method directly in our new type's class.  In fact, putting the program's &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt; method in a customized subclass of a component is a common idiom in programming Swing applications.  When reorganized this way, the program looks like this:

{{XCode|1='''The merged class'''

                        this.setText(TEXT1);

        public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
                this.changeLabel();
        }
        
        // Main method.  This is the code that is executed when the
        // program is run
        public static void main(String[] args) {

            frame.setLocationRelativeTo(null);
            frame.toFront();
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;}}

This program does exactly the same thing as the first, but organizes all the code into one class.

== Multi-threading in Swing ==

The thread that performs actions inside the action, change, mouse and other listeners is called a ''Swing thread''. These methods must execute and return quickly, as the Swing thread that must be available for the Swing framework to keep the application responsive. In other words, if you perform some time-consuming calculation or other activities, you must do this in a separate thread, not in the Swing thread. However then you access Swing components from the non-swing thread you initiated yourself, they may hang due race conditions if manipulated by the Swing thread at the same time. Because of that, Swing component from the non-Swing thread must be accessed through intermediate Runnable, using the &lt;code&gt;SwingUtilities.invokeAndWait()&lt;/code&gt; method:

{{XCode|1='''Multi-threading'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
 String myMessage = &quot;abc&quot;;
 final String message = myMessage; // Making final allows to access from inner class here.
 SwingUtilities.invokeAndWait(new Runnable {
   public void run() {
     myLabel.setText(message);
   }
 })
&lt;/source&gt;}}

This call will fire ''setText(message)'' in the appropriate time, when the Swing thread will be ready to respond. This approach is also usual when implementing the moving progress bar that only works properly if the slow process itself is implemented outside the Swing thread.

&lt;big&gt;'''Randomized Evidence for Pancreatic Cancer'''&lt;/big&gt;

In process of being cross-linked ...


==Resectable Disease==
===Biliary Drain===
*'''The Netherlands''' (2003-2008) -- preop biliary drainage vs. surgery only
**'''2010''' PMID 20071702 -- &quot;Preoperative biliary drainage for cancer of the head of the pancreas.&quot; (van der Gaag NA, N Engl J Med. 2010 Jan 14;362(2):129-37.)
**Randomized. 202 patients, obstructive jaundice and bilirubin 2.3 - 14.6 mg/dl. Arm 1) Preoperative biliary drainage for 4-6 weeks vs. Arm 2) No drainage. Both arms followed by surgical resection. Drainage primarily by ERCP placed endoprosthesis. Primary outcome rate of serious complications
***Outcome: Complications drain 74% vs. no drain 39% (RR 0.54, SS). Mortality and LOS no difference
***Conclusion: Routine pre-op biliary drainage increases rate of complications
===Extent of surgical resection===
*'''Mayo Clinic''' (1997-2003) -- standard LND vs. extended LND
**Randomized. 79 patients with resectable pancreatic head cancer, peri-ampullary and islet cell excluded. Distal gastrectomy, pylorus preservation not allowed. Arm 1) standard LND (D1) removed first-echelon lymph nodes en bloc vs. Arm 2) extended LND (D2) which in addition dissected second-echelon lymph nodes
**'''2005''' PMID 16269290 -- &quot;A prospective randomized trial comparing standard pancreatoduodenectomy with pancreatoduodenectomy with extended lymphadenectomy in resectable pancreatic head adenocarcinoma.&quot; (Farnell MB, Surgery. 2005 Oct;138(4):618-28; discussion 628-30.)
***Outcome: Median OR time D1 6.2 hrs vs. D2 7.6 hrs (SS), blood transfusions 22% vs. 44% (SS), median LN resected 15 vs. 36 (SS), LOS ~11 days (NS). Median OS 2.2 years vs. 1.6 years (NS), 1-year OS 82% vs. 71% (NS)
***Toxicity: Diarrhea, body appearance, bowel control better (SS) with D1 resection
***Conclusion: No difference, extended LND unattractive for further evaluation

*'''Johns Hopkins''' (1996-2001) - Pancreaticoduodenectomy: pylorus preservation with standard LND vs. distal gastrectomy with retroperitoneal LND
**Randomized. 299 patients with periampullary carcinoma (57% pancreatic, 22% ampullary, 17% distal bile duct, 3% duodenal). Initially treated with pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy then Arm 1) pylorus preservation and standard LND (distal gastrectomy only if inadequate margin) vs. Arm 2) radical resection with gastrectomy and extended LND
**'''2002''' PMID 12192322 -- &quot;Pancreaticoduodenectomy with or without distal gastrectomy and extended retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy for periampullary adenocarcinoma, part 2: randomized controlled trial evaluating survival, morbidity, and mortality.&quot; (Yeo CJ, Ann Surg. 2002 Sep;236(3):355-66; discussion 366-8.)
***Complication rate: standard 29% vs. radical 43%
***LN+ 74%, SM+ 10% (standard 21% vs. radical 5%)
**'''5-years; 2005''' PMID 16332474 -- &quot;Pancreaticoduodenectomy with or without distal gastrectomy and extended retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy for periampullary adenocarcinoma--part 3: update on 5-year survival.&quot; (Riall TS, J Gastrointest Surg. 2005 Dec;9(9):1191-204; discussion 1204-6.). Median live F/U 5.3 years
***Outcome: 5-year OS standard 25% vs. radical 31% (NS); pancreatic CA - standard 13% vs. radical 29% (NS). SM+ standard 21% vs. radical 5% (SS)
***Conclusion: Pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodectomy without retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy procedure of choice, but higher SM+ in standard resection

*'''Milan''' (Italy)(1991-1994) -- standard LND vs extended LND
**Randomized. 81 patients with resectable head of pancreas CA. Pancreatoduodenectomy, then Arm 1) standard LND vs. Arm 2) extended LND and retroperitoneal soft-tissue clearance (hepatic hilum, along aorta from the diaphragm to the IMA, laterally to both renal hila, with clearance of the celiac axis and SMA). IORT in 19 patients (NS)
**'''1998''' PMID 9790340 -- &quot;Standard versus extended lymphadenectomy associated with pancreatoduodenectomy in the surgical treatment of adenocarcinoma of the head of the pancreas: a multicenter, prospective, randomized study. Lymphadenectomy Study Group.&quot; Pedrazzoli S, Ann Surg. 1998 Oct;228(4):508-17.)
***Outcome: No difference in peri-operative outcomes. LN sampled standard 13 vs. extended 20 (SS). Median OS standard 11.0 months vs. 16.4 (NS)
***Post-hoc analysis: N1 patients significantly better survival if extended vs standard; no difference in N0 patients
***Predictors of survival: Grade, size (&gt;2.0 cm), N1, &gt;=4 transfused units of blood
***Conclusion: Extended resection doesn't improve survival, although trend in N1 patients


===Surgery +/- Chemo-RT===
*'''Erasmus MC''' (2000-2007) -- intra-arterial chemo-RT vs observation
**Randomized. 120 patients, pancreatic head (52%) or periampullary (48%) cancer. After pancreaticoduodenectomy, randomized to Arm 1) intra-arterial mitoxantrone, 5-FU, leucovoring, and cisplatin x6 cycles with RT 54/30 after first cycle vs Arm 2) observation
**'''2008''' PMID 19092348 -- &quot;Adjuvant intra-arterial chemotherapy and radiotherapy versus surgery alone in resectable pancreatic and periampullary cancer: a prospective randomized controlled trial.&quot; (Morak MJ, Ann Surg. 2008 Dec;248(6):1031-41.) Median F/U 1.5 years
***Outcome: Median OS 19 months vs 18 months (NS), PFS 37% vs 20% (SS). Significantly fewer liver mets on subgroup analysis
***Conclusion: Intra-arterial chemo-RT prolongs time to progression, but no impact on survival

*'''ESPAC-1''' (1994-2000) -- 2x2 surgery +/- chemotherapy and +/- chemo-RT
**Randomized, 2x2 design + 2 other randomizations to improve accrual. 541 patients total, treated with pancreaticoduodenectomy (R0 81%, R1 19%). Physicians could choose a randomization. 285 patients randomized to 2x2 factorial (observation, chemotherapy x6 cycles, chemo-RT, chemo-RT followed by adjuvant chemo x6 cycles). 68 patients randomized to +/- adjuvant chemo-RT. 188 patients randomized to +/- adjuvant chemo. Patients could be given other &quot;background&quot; therapy, which could be chemo or RT. RT AP/PA split course 20/10 + 20/10 (GITSG regimen, although up to 60 Gy could be given). Chemotherapy concurrent bolus 5-FU 500 mg/m2 + leucovorin, adjuvant 5-FU 425 mg/m2 x6 months
**'''All patients; 2001''' PMID 11716884 -- &quot;Adjuvant chemoradiotherapy and chemotherapy in resectable pancreatic cancer: a randomised controlled trial.&quot; (Neoptolemos JP, Lancet. 2001 Nov 10;358(9293):1576-85.) Median F/U of alive patients 10 months
***Analysis: Combined group chemo-RT (n=178) vs. no chemo-RT (n=175); combined group chemo (n=235) vs. no chemo (n=238). 
***Outcome: median OS chemo-RT 15 months vs. no chemo-RT 16 months (NS); median OS chemo 20 months vs. no chemo 14 months (SS)
***Conclusion: No survival benefit for adjuvant chemo-RT, significant benefit for adjuvant chemo
**'''2x2 subset; 2004''' PMID 15028824 &amp;mdash; &quot;A randomized trial of chemoradiotherapy and chemotherapy after resection of pancreatic cancer&quot; (Neoptolemos JP, N Engl J Med. 2004 Mar 18;350(12):1200-10.)
***Analysis of 2x2 factorial patients only. 289 patients, not powered for individual group comparison. 82% deaths recorded. Median F/U 3.9 years
***Outcome: median OS observation 17 months vs. chemo-RT 14 months vs. 22 months chemo vs. 20 months chemo-RT + chemo (not powered for statistics)
****Chemo-RT comparison: median OS chemo-RT 16 months vs. no chemo-RT 18 months (NS), 5-year OS chemo-RT 10% vs. no chemo-RT 20% (p=0.05); no benefit regardless of chemo
****Chemo comparison: median OS chemo 20 months vs. no chemo 15 months (SS), 5-year OS chemo 21% vs. no chemo 8% (p=0.009); benefit regardless of RT
***Pattern of failure: LR 35%, LR+DM 27%, DM 34%
***Conclusion: Adjuvant chemotherapy significant survival benefit; adjuvant chemo-RT had deleterious effect on survival

*'''EORTC 40891''' (1987-95) -- surgery +/- chemo-RT
**Randomized. 218 patients. Pancreatic T1-2 N0-1a (55%) or periampullary (ampulla, distal CBD, duodenum) T1-3 N0-1a (45%). Arm 1) Chemo-RT vs. Arm 2) observation. RT split course 20/10 + 20/10 (GITSG regimen). Chemo 5-FU C.I. 25 mg/kg over 5 days at the beginning of each RT course. No maintenance (vs. 2 years in GITSG). SM+ 21%, LN+ 50%
**'''1999''' PMID 10615932 &amp;mdash; &quot;Adjuvant radiotherapy and 5-fluorouracil after curative resection of cancer of the pancreas and periampullary region: phase III trial of the EORTC gastrointestinal tract cancer cooperative group.&quot; (Klinkenbijl JH, Ann Surg. 1999 Dec;230(6):776-82.)
***For all tumors: Median PFS chemo-RT 17 months vs observation 16 months (NS); median OS 24 months vs 19 months (NS). 2-year OS 51% vs 41%, 5-year OS 28% vs 22% (NS) 
***Pancreas tumor subset: median OS 17 months vs 13 months (NS). 2-year OS 37% vs 23%, 5-year OS 20% vs 10% (p=0.09).
***Periampullary tumor subset: median OS 39 months vs 40 months (NS). 5-year OS 38% vs. 36% (NS)
***Site of failure: LR both arms 15% (NS), LRR+DM ~20%, DM ~30%
***Conclusion: Routine use of post-op chemo-RT not warranted
**'''12-years; 2007''' PMID 17968163 -- &quot;Long-term survival and metastatic pattern of pancreatic and periampullary cancer after adjuvant chemoradiation or observation: long-term results of EORTC trial 40891.&quot; (Smeenk HG, Ann Surg. 2007 Nov;246(5):734-40.) Median F/U 11.7 years
***Outcome: Death reported in 79% (malignant disease cause of death in chemo-RT 79% vs. observation 86%); median OS chemo-RT 1.8 years vs. observation 1.6 years (NS), 5-year OS 25% vs. 22% (NS), 10-year OS 17% vs. 18% (NS) - pancreatic subset 8% vs. periampullary subset 29%; median PFS 1.5 years vs. 1.2 years (NS)
***Conclusion: No benefit for adjuvant chemo-RT
**Criticisms: No maintenance chemotherapy. About 20% of pts assigned to chemo-RT arm did not receive that treatment, although 93% received RT. Benefit was diluted by inclusion of favorable periampullary cancers, although on exploratory pancreatic cancer subset analysis there was no difference. 

*'''GITSG 9173''' (1974-82) -- surgery +/- chemo-RT
**Randomized. ''Terminated early due to poor accrual.'' 42 patients with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas (ampulla excluded), who were resected, margins negative, no peritoneal mets. Head of pancreas 95%, SM+ 38%, LN+ 28%, Grade 3 5%. Subtotal Whipple 68%, Stage I 35%. Randomized to Arm 1) RT + 5-FU vs Arm 2) observation. RT was supravoltage 40/20 split course (2 week break after 20/10). Fields included the pancreatic bed and regional nodes AP/PA. 5-FU (500 mg/m2) bolus on days 1-3 of each cycle. Adjuvant chemotherapy given weekly x 2 years beginning 1 month after RT. 
**'''1985''' PMID 4015380 &amp;mdash; &quot;Pancreatic cancer. Adjuvant combined radiation and chemotherapy following curative resection.&quot; (Kalser MH, Arch Surg. 1985 Aug;120(8):899-903.) Median F/U 5.5 years
***Median OS: chemo-RT 20 months vs observation 11 months (SS). 2-year OS 42% vs 15%; 5-yr OS vs 15% and 5%; median DFS 11 months vs. 9 months (SS) 
***Recurrence: overall 71% vs. 86%; local 47%; hepatic 32% vs. 50%; DM 40% vs 52%.
***Conclusion: Adjuvant chemo-RT may prolong survival time

===Surgery + Chemo-RT: Adjuvant Chemo Alternatives===
*'''RTOG 97-04 / Intergroup''' (1998-2002) -- sandwich chemo-RT adjuvant 5-FU vs. gemcitabine  
**Randomized. 451 patients, with complete GTR of pancreas. Arm 1) CI 5-FU (250 mg/m2) x3 weeks -&gt; chemo-RT -&gt; CI 5-FU (250 mg/m2) x12 weeks vs. Arm 2) gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2) x3 weeks -&gt; chemo-RT -&gt; gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2) x12 weeks. Chemo-RT was same for both arms (RT 50.4 Gy + concurrent 5-FU 250 mg/m2), 1-2 weeks after induction chemo. Compliance with both &gt;85%
**'''2008''' PMID 18319412 -- &quot;Fluorouracil vs gemcitabine chemotherapy before and after fluorouracil-based chemoradiation following resection of pancreatic adenocarcinoma: a randomized controlled trial.&quot; (Regine WF, JAMA. 2008 Mar 5;299(9):1019-26.)
***Outcome: median OS 5-FU 17 months vs. gemcitabine 20 months (p=0.09)
***Toxicity: Grade 4 hematologic 5-FU 1% vs. gemcitabine 14% (SS)
***Conclusion: Trend to survival for gemcitabine (but NS), and significantly more toxic


===Surgery +/- Adjuvant Chemotherapy===
*'''CONKO-001''' (Germany)(1998-2004) -- adjuvant gemcitabine vs observation
**Randomized. 354/368 patients. Pancreas carcinoma T1-4 N0-1 M0 s/p gross complete resection (R0 or R1 allowed). Arm 1) adjuvant gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2) x 6 cycles vs Arm 2) no adjuvant treatment. R0 resection in 80%
**'''2007''' PMID 17227978  &amp;mdash; &quot;Adjuvant Chemotherapy With Gemcitabine vs Observation in Patients Undergoing Curative-Intent Resection of Pancreatic Cancer.&quot; (Oettle H, JAMA. 2007 Jan 17;297:267-277.) Median F/U 4.4 years
***Relapse: chemo 74% vs control 92%; LR (with/without DM) in 34% vs 41%. DM alone in 56% vs 49%. 
***Survival: Median DFS 13 vs 7 months (SS); 1-year DFS 58% vs. 31%, 3-year 23% vs. 7%, 5-year 16% vs. 5%. Median OS 22 months vs. 20 months (NS) but 5-year OS 22% vs. 11% (p=0.06)
***Subgroup analysis shows benefit for gemzar for DFS for all subgroups. In subgroup analysis, OS benefit thus far for gemzar for R0 resection and T3-4 and N- pts.
***Conclusion: Adjuvant gemcitabine significantly improved DFS (primary endpoint), and trial supports its use as adjuvant therapy

*'''JSAP''' (Japan)(1992-2000) -- adjuvant cisplatin/5-FU vs. observation
**Randomized. 85 patients, s/p complete resection (R1 not allowed). Arm 1) adjuvant cisplatin 80 mg/m2 + 5-FU 500 mg/m2 x2 cycles. Intraop RT used but not discussed.
**'''2006''' PMID 16490736 -- &quot;A multicenter randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of adjuvant cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil therapy after curative resection in cases of pancreatic cancer.&quot; (Kosuge T, Jpn J Clin Oncol. 2006 Mar;36(3):159-65. Epub 2006 Feb 20.)
***Outcome: median OS chemo 12 months vs. observation 16 months (NS); 5-year OS chemo 26% vs. observation 15%
***Prognostic factors: Grade 1, no LN+. T-stage, size not prognostic
***Toxicity: Grade 3+ 16%
***Conclusion: Postop adjuvant cisplatin/5-FU safe, but no survival benefit

*'''Japan''' (1986-1992) -- adjuvant MF vs. observation
**Randomized. 508 patients (&lt;u&gt;pancreatic n=173&lt;/u&gt;, cholangio n=139, n=140, ampulla n=56), s/p surgery. Stage II-IV, pancreas LN+ 80%, liver+ 10%, curative resection 58%. Arm 1) adjuvant chemo with mitomycin C + 5-FU C.I. x2 courses, followed by 5-FU until recurrence vs. Arm 2) observation
**'''2002''' PMID 12365016 -- &quot;Is postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy useful for gallbladder carcinoma? A phase III multicenter prospective randomized controlled trial in patients with resected pancreaticobiliary carcinoma.&quot; (Takada T, Cancer. 2002 Oct 15;95(8):1685-95.)
***Outcome: 5-year OS pancreatic chemo 11% vs. observation 18%; for curative resection chemo 18% vs. observation 27% (NS)
***Conclusion: No benefit for adjuvant systemic chemotherapy in pancreatic cancer

*'''Norway''' (1984-1987) -- adjuvant AMF vs. observation
**Randomized. 61 patients with pancreatic (77%) or papilla (23%), s/p radical resection. Arm 1) adjuvant chemo ([[Radiation_Oncology/Chemotherapy_combinations|AMF]]) x6 cycles vs. Arm 2) control.
**'''1993''' PMID 8471327 -- &quot;Adjuvant combination chemotherapy (AMF) following radical resection of carcinoma of the pancreas and papilla of Vater--results of a controlled, prospective, randomised multicentre study.&quot; (Bakkevold KE, Eur J Cancer. 1993;29A(5):698-703.)
***Outcome: median OS chemo 23 months vs. observation 11 months (SS); 2-year OS 43% vs. 32% (NS); 5-year OS 4% vs. 8% (NS)
***Conclusion: Adjuvant chemo postpone incidence of recurrence during first 2 years; no difference on ultimate cure rate

===Surgery vs. Chemo-RT===
*'''Japan Pancreatic Cancer Study Group''' -- Surgery vs. Chemo-radiation
**Randomized. ''Stopped early after survival benefit to surgery.'' 42/150 patients, locally advanced but resectable pancreatic cancer, no involvement of SMA or common hepatic artery, no para-aortic LN+. Arm 1) Surgery (pancreaticoduodenectomy or distal pancreatectomy + dissection of regional lymphatics) vs. Arm 2) Concurrent RT 50.4/28 and C.I. 5-FU 200 mg/m2 to primary tumor + 1-3 cm margin to cover regional lymph nodes
**'''5-years; 2008''' PMID 18958561 -- &quot;Surgery versus radiochemotherapy for resectable locally invasive pancreatic cancer: Final results of a randomized multi-institutional trial.&quot; (Doi R, Surg Today. 2008 Nov;38(11):1021-1028. Epub 2008 Oct 29.) Minimum F/U alive patients 5 years
***Outcome: median OS surgery 12 months vs. chemo-RT 9 months (NS); 3-year OS 20% vs. 0% (SS); 5-year OS 10% vs. 0% (NS)
***Conclusion: Locally invasive resectable pancreatic cancer is treated more effectively by resection than by chemo-radiation

==Unresectable Disease==
===RT vs. Chemo-RT===
*'''GITSG 9273'''  (1970's) -- RT 60 Gy vs. RT 40 Gy + 5-FU vs. RT 60 Gy + 5-FU
**Randomized, 3 arms. 194 patients with locally unresectable pancreatic CA.

Here are the assumptions for the coloured areas:

*First assumption: the school is located in a place where the language of the school is a mother tongue of the surrounding population.
*Second assumption: It is very difficult for an 11 year old student to follow the lessons in a language that is not the student's mother tongue, therefore the school is recruiting primarily in countries where the school teaching language is mother tongue. 
*Third assumptions: The school may also recruit, but less frequently, in places where the language is close enough from the school language so that the students do not have to learn a language that is too different from the school language.

'''Locations'''
*Hogwarts location: Rowling said it is in Scotland in an Interview. This map has assumed that it is not in the most populated areas of Scotland (Edinburgh and Glasgow) since in Goblet of Fire, it is said that the nearest Muggle town is several miles away (that does not exist around Edinburgh and Glasgow). I have also excluded the Scottish Islands, since you can go to Hogwarts by train from London.
*Beauxbatons location: It must be in a French speaking area. The weather is warm (school uniform is very light), bouillabaisse seems to be a regular dish for the students.
*Durmstrang location: It must be in a Slavic country (Victor Krum is from Bulgaria, all other known students/teachers have a slavic name, all have a slavic accent when they speak). Latitude needs to be higher than Scotland (Dumbledore says that they are &quot;from the North&quot; while he is in Scotland), and Krum says that the winter days are very short, and summer days particularly long, compared to Hogwarts, implying that Durmstrang is near or above the Arctic Circle. Also he says that there are lakes and mountains around it. The map highlights those spots that match all 3 pieces of information (Slavic language, latitude higher than Scotland, lake + mountain areas).

'''Recruitment ground'''
*Hogwarts recruitment ground: Britain &amp; maybe Republic of Ireland (no language barrier to prevent it in the English-speaking areas, but the Gaelic-speaking areas could pose a problem).
*Beauxbatons recruitment ground: All french speaking countries in Europe + maybe other latin speaking countries (the languages are close enough to French to make the linguistic jump?) and North African countries where French is taught in primary school.
*Durmstrang recruitment ground: once it is established that Durmstrang can only be in northern Russia, it is assumed that Russian speaking countries are the primary recruitment ground. Bulgaria and other slavic speaking countries qualify as secondary recruitment ground because the other slavic languages could be close enough to Russian for the students to learn it.

==Usage, Limitations, and Options==
----
----
===Usage===
This is a simple text panel.   It has a text heading and a text body.   The background is white and the font is fixed.   It is intended for short code sections in pages.  The width can be set.   The alignment is ''right'', ''left'', and center.

An example of its use, and the result is shown below:

&lt;nowiki&gt;{{codebox|width=33%|align=center|Heading|This is the text body.   It has no frills and in my view might be good for listing code.   The problem of preformatted text is mentioned below, with the solution to it.   Expressing the solution in type is a problem all of its own!}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;


{{codebox|width=33%|align=center|Heading|This is the text body.   It has no frills and in my view might be good for listing code.   The problem of preformatted text is mentioned below, with the solution to it.   Expressing the solution in type is a problem all of its own!}}


===Limitations===
It needs tags for (pre)formatted text, with possible consideration of literals for any such tags in the code block itself. 

===Options===
;width:   box width px pt % (default 340px)
;align:   box position on the page, left, right, or center (default center)

Parameters are 1 and 2 for heading and body text


===Formatting Problems with ''''pre''''===
----
When a code block is enclosed with the terms '''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' to produce a page of preformatted code, the '''pre''' tags within the code block itself cause mixups with the outer tags.   Replace the '''code block's''' '''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' tags with the literals: 

'''&amp;amp;lt;pre&amp;amp;gt;'''  and  '''&amp;amp;lt;/pre&amp;amp;gt;'''

The resultant code block will show '''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' in their place, and the mixups will be avoided.   This method extends to other similar cases.

:{{Comment}} This book, and the one below, were donated to Wikibooks. I helped with the upload originally. This &quot;book&quot; was previously published, and so I didn't think it would constitute an OR violation. I do agree that this is highly academic in nature, but we don't have any limits on how academic a book can be before it must be removed from here.

      <comment>Variations</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">There about as many variations on kugelis as there are Lithuanian cooks.  Both of my grandmothers had slightly different versions--and my own mother did hers a little differently from either grandmom.

Some recipes call for using sour cream instead of milk; some call for scalding the milk or lightly sautéing the onions.  My mother liked to divide the potatoes and boil and mash 1 potato for every 2 raw grated potatoes.  Mom added a bit of baking powder to the mix also.  One grandmother used bacon fat, the other, butter.

I've also heard of cooks adding farina or bread crumbs for texture.

My own experience indicates that old potatoes produce better results than fresh ones do.  I prefer stay away from coarse-grained Idahoes and use white or red potates for a better texture.

What with the bacon fat, sour cream and butter, this is perhaps not the best dish for cardiovascular health, but it sure is yummy!

      <text xml:space="preserve">==== strtod ====

{{C++ Programming/Syntax|
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;
double strtod( const char *start, char **end );
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

The function strtod() returns whatever it encounters first in start as a double. end is set to point at whatever is left in start after that double. If overflow occurs, strtod() returns either '''HUGE_VAL''' or '''-HUGE_VAL'''.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
x = atof( &quot;42.0is_the_answer&quot; ); 
&lt;/source&gt;

results in x being set to 42.0.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Crochethookroll.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Crochet hook organizer]]

This handy little organizer was the first thing I ever designed.  Originally I worked it as practice in the half double crochet stitch (yes, my skills were that basic at the time).  It happened to be the right size for my crochet hooks so I stuck them through it and tied it with a piece of scrap yarn.  Later when my skills had improved I added the border and bow ends.

So I really don't understand why craft stores sell crochet hook organizers.  We're crocheters; we can make stuff!  And yes, it saves money.


== Materials ==
*Cotton yarn 
*4mm hook (U.S. size G)

== Construction ==
If the border is too difficult at first, do what I did and just use a spare piece of yarn to hold the roll together.  This should keep crochet hooks of nearly any size organized, although extreme oversized hooks and Tunisian crochet hooks won't fit.

== Instructions ==
[[Image:Crochethookrollclosed.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Rolled up and tied]]

'''Body'''

*Row 1: chain stitch 40.  Make 2 stitch turning chain.
*Row 2: half double.  Make 2 stitch turning chain.
*Rows 3-20: Repeat row 2.

'''Border'''
*In a contrasting color, start from the center of one of the short sides and half double around the edge.  To turn corners, work 5 half double stitches into the corner.  Stop 1 stitch short of completing the border
*To make the bow ties, chain stitch 30.  Make a 1 stitch turning chain.  Single crochet.  Anchor with 1 half double stitch to complete the border.  Make a second tie the same as the first one, then cut and work in loose ends.

== Good, we've started! ==

Hello everyone,
I created this article a while ago, and I'll be editing bits and bobs around, but just out of interest, why is there a link to the croatian language page? Wouldn't it be better to just link it straight back to the front page?
:I fixed the link. The person who put it there probably intended to write &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Croatian|Croatian language]] rather than [[Croatian language|Croatian]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. I mix up the order all the time.

== Here's an eager student ==
Hello guys! Thanks for the Croatian book and Good luck for your project. Looks very beautiful so far! 
I need to learn to say some basic Croatian sentences for my work, and came here. Would be great, if you guys could provide some pronunciation examples as audio files, for example in the way that we have made in the [[Finnish/Appendix_A|Finnish book]]. Not that Croatian pronunciation is too difficult, but for beginners it would be very useful to learn in properly at once.

Ellipses are sometimes called ovals.  Ellipses contain two foci.  The sum of the distance from a point on the ellipse to one focus and that same point to the other focus is constant

      <comment>/* XQuery Function to display session information */ nav</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want to use an XForms application to get login information and set server session variables.

== Method ==
The XForms standard has a &quot;secret&quot; attribute for collecting a password.  After the user fills out the login form, it is POSTed to the server.

&lt;span style=&quot;color:red;&quot;&gt;Note that you should not use HTTP GET for passwords since the passwords will appear in the web log files as a URL parameter.&lt;/span&gt;

The eXist system has several functions for setting session variables.  After a user logs in these session variables should be set and all subsequent XQueries can use these session variables when accessing secure resources.

Note that setting session variables is out-of-scope of the W3C XQuery 1.0 standard and each server may use slight variations of these functions.  But the concepts should be very similar.

Most commonly, a session variable is used to associate the user to one or more roles.  This is known as role-based access control (RBAC).  This allows your XQueries to set conditional behavior based on the user's role, and avoids having to hard-code XQueries based on usernames that may change frequently. A typical role is the &quot;admin&quot; role or the &quot;document-approver&quot; role. eXist uses a UNIX style group that can be associated with a collection or a file. You can use these groups for security if you note that a collection or file can be associated with one-and-only-one group at any time. Users are frequently associated with multiple roles during a session, just as in UNIX a user can be in many groups.

== Sample XForms Login Screen ==

A sample login XForms application is provided here:

[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/XForms/Secret XForms Login Screen]

This form may be customized to put in any legal disclaimers about the use of unauthorized systems.  It can then be wrapped in an XQuery function such as local:display-login() and invoked if the user is accessing a page that they do not have authorization to access.

== Sample XQuery to Check for Login ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;

(: This is juat a rough outline based on the admin.xql program.  Needs more work... :)

let $user := xdb:get-current-user()
let $pass := local:get-pass()
let $logout := local:get-login()

let $isLoggedIn :=  if($user eq &quot;guest&quot;)
   then
    (
    (: is this a login attempt? :)
        if($user and not(empty($pass)))
    then
        (
         if($user eq &quot;guest&quot;)
          then
            (
                (: prevent the guest user from accessing the admin webapp :)
                false()
            )
            else
            (
                (: try and log the user in :)
                xdb:login(&quot;/db&quot;, $user, $pass)
            )
        )
        else
        (
            (: prevent the guest user from accessing the admin webapp :)
            false()
        )
    )
    else
    (
        (: if we are already logged in, are we logging out - i.e. set permissions back to guest :)
        if  ($logout)
           then
        (
        	let $null := xdb:login(&quot;/db&quot;, &quot;guest&quot;, &quot;guest&quot;) return
        	    false()
        )
        else
        (
             (: we are already logged in and we are not the guest user :)
            true()
        )
    )
return
&lt;html&gt;
...
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== XQuery Function to display session information ==
Once the user is logged in, the following function can be used to display session information in the upper-right corder of the screen.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
(: 
    Display the version, SVN revision and user info in the top right corner 
:)
declare function admin:info-header() as element()
{
    &lt;div class=&quot;info&quot;&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Version: { util:system-property( &quot;product-version&quot; ) }&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;SVN Revision: { util:system-property( &quot;svn-revision&quot; ) }&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Build: {util:system-property(&quot;product-build&quot;)}&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;User: { xdb:get-current-user() }&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
};
&lt;/source&gt;

      <comment>/* Kids' block toys-- best construction and engineering education */ link to table saw</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The following entries apply initially to a '''single flapdisc system''' used to sand relatively small blocks for children.  

==Kids' block toys-- best construction and engineering education==

Wood block toys are widely recognized to be the most versatile and most educational of all toys, yet they are surprisingly underrepresented in the armarium of toys and education devices available to children worldwide, with unfortunate results.  Children are steered to toys from which one can learn little about how to do anything (music, math, engineering) but much about image, status and bogus conceptions of personal identity (dolls, similated weapons and other symbolic possessions, passive entertainment audio and video, etc. focused on the endless quarrel over who has the upper hand).  

A recent Beckley-Cardy &quot;education&quot; toy catalog devoted less than 5% of its pages to wood block toy products-- most of the rest consisting of plastic, paper, media etc.  The block toy section offered, among other things similarly priced, a set of 500 blocks for $700($1.40 per block), guaranteeing that they are made of only the very best special New England maple and that every block is an exact precise multiple of the length or width of every other. (What does a 2-year-old care about wood pedigree?)  

Forget spending all that money; buy a second-hand [[Carpentry/Power_Tools/Table_Saw|table-saw]] and a 7-1/4&quot; carbide-tipped sawblade (which will last through hundreds of nailhits) and you can transform editable old scrapwood cutoffs from crates, pallets, construction and demolition leftovers, etc., into clean gorgeous blocks in surprisingly little time.  Try to use what you find discarded in your neighborhood, or deadwood trunks and branches edited from local garden and street trees -- the main priority is to trim and sand away dirt, pollution and splinters, leaving exposed the beautiful, infinitely instructive grain pattern, and round off sharp edges and corners.

There is no limit to sizes or shapes of blocks worth making for children, nor is exact geometry of importance prior to age 3 (&quot;Irregular Blocks Teach Adaptive Engineering&quot;). 
(Next to maybe writing symphonies for large orchestra, saw-trimming scrapwood into blockshapes for children is the most intellectually challenging and creative work on the planet.)
 
(Diagrams and pictures of representative products are in preparation to be added to the article, [[v:Essential_Preschool_Part_I|Wikiversity: Essential Preschool Part I]]. If you have a product idea with picture don't hesitate to add it there.)Tokerdesigner 22:29, 15 February 2008 (UTC)

==Disc sanding system== 

Many sides and edges will have to be sanded to eliminate all chance of splinters, and round all sharp edges and corners on blocks destined for use by children.  Attach a regular 1725-rpm motor to a table with the shaft pointing out over the table's edge. Onto the shaft, with an arbor/converter which can be obtained for less than $US10, attach a 7-inch flapsander disc (the #24-Grit &quot;Tiger-Disc&quot; for $18 from Weiler Abrasives is recommended, and other discs, from Grit #36 up, are often cheaper). This disc will survive tens of thousands of wood sandings.

As you face the sander with the block firmly held in both hands, the disc will be revolving counter-clockwise so that the direction is down on the left side, up on the right. Do all your sanding on the left side of the disc so that the dust flies downward into a sack, box or vacuum contrivance. Protective eyeware and woodman's muzzle (Muzzlewoodmanism) advised.

Instead of just holding the block still while pushing it against the disc, you want to keep the block moving so as to reduce heat-buildup (and clogging). 

*  Movement left and right distributes abrasion heat among different areas of the sandpaper and of the wood. 

*  Movement up and down varies the direction of cut (see below).

Develop a sequence of movements for sanding all sides and turning edges and corners. Mentally count numbers as needed to keep track of where you are in your system. Sanding a typical block from totally rough may take two minutes.  (With hardwoods, you can save time by skinning the sides with a table saw or chop saw, leaving only sharp corners and edges to be sanded with higher grit paper.)

When rounding an end-edge, sand '''out of the sidegrain into the endgrain''' so you won't rip anything off (such as the bark on rustic pieces). Sanding blocks is analogous to conducting that symphony which someone else (maybe you earlier) wrote. It brings out the glorious artistry of the artist (tree), and will help you develop a systematic mind and sense of rhythm so that you are more effective demonstrating a Zooky (see [[v:Essential_Preschool_Part_I|Wikiversity: Essential Preschool Part I]]).

===Some notes on strokes===

From much practice with the benchmounted disc system described above, the writer has learned to distinguish three types of strokes:

*  Hyphen-stroke-- left-right-- used for low-pressure rounding of edges (usually four side grain and four side-to-end grain).

*  C-stroke-- a double stroke with the wood continuously in contact with the flapdisc 180 degrees around the left side of the disc and alternatively a little further toward the right at the top of the disc and a little further to the right at the bottom of the disc (illustration is in preparation and will be added to article).  This is used for high-pressure sanding of flat sidegrain.

*  I-stroke-- up-down-- used for sanding flat endgrain surfaces.

===A stroke sequence found practical===

1.  Side grain: start with the block lying laterally with your right hand gripping the block strongly and ready to do turns, and your left fingers pressing the block against the left edge of the sanding disc, at a slight angle so that most of the pressure is against the outer edge of the disc.  Sand about half the block with two high-pressure C-strokes (right-left-right-left), then turning the block &quot;away&quot; from you up to 45 degrees, two low-pressure hyphen-strokes, then again two high-pressure C-strokes on the original side, then turning the block &quot;toward&quot; you, two low-pressure hyphen-strokes.  Do the complete operation four times in one smoothly continuous non-stop sequence.  Then turn the block around and repeat the above for the opposite half of the block. 

2.  Turn the block so that it is slanting downward about 45 degrees toward the disc and rotate it so that each side-to-end edge is rounded; then turn the block end (crossgrain) flat against the outer part of the disc and do one or two I-strokes (see above); turn to 45-degree angle and rotate one 90-degree turn; again flatten endface against disc for one or two I-strokes, etc. (do the above four times).

3.  With block lying laterally, this time about parallel to the whole flapdisc, grip strongly (for turning) with your left hand and with your right fingers press the block against the inner lip of the flapseries (at this position, nearer the center of the disc, the sandpaper is moving almost twice as slow as during the above sequences).  Sand about half the block with two high-pressure C-strokes, turn it &quot;toward&quot; you for two low-pressure hyphen-strokes, and so on around (usually four times).  Turn the block and do the other end-half similarly.  This sequence is a little shorter than #1 above, and you are sanding in the opposite direction from #1.

4.  Repeat #2 above with I-strokes on the endface, but this time against the inner lip of the flaps instead of the outer edge.

Depending on the size of the block, the above four-step sequence may take 1-4 minutes.  In most cases, a softwood block handled this way is ready for varnish or paint, and a hardwood block for the next finer disc (with a shorter sequence).  By turning and alternating you avoid overheating and use the disc most efficiently.

===Varnish, paint?===

'''Varnishing''' is advisable to protect some softwoods which soil or stain easily, and it will make some pines, etc., more dramatic by bringing out the color contrast between hard (dark) and soft (light) rings. Select the boringest softwood pieces to be '''painted''': first a coat of paint, then let dry; resand, possibly partly eroding the paint in an interesting grainy/drainy/trainy pattern; second coat may be varnish.  Or paint the blocks with a light color, sand just enough for smoothness, give to children to draw or paint illustrations on, then final varnish.

An option with hardwood blocks is to resand with a higher grit (and at a slower wheel speed, which may require belt and pulley): Grit #36, #50, #60, #80, #100 etc. requiring 2/3, 1/2, 1/3 wheel speeds etc.  The crossgrain thus revealed (detailed view of many years of treegrowth) is the #1 most educational view seen anywhere on the planet.  Some pieces of especial beauty will need no varnish at all; others may be painted and/or varnished only on the side grain, leaving the final fine sanding of endgrain for after the varnish has dried.

===Further learning bonus: sandman training===

Compared to saws, which scare parents, the sander is a relatively safe machine for relatively young children to use, making blocks for relatively younger children. Consult experts on how to set up a workspace in which some children can participate safely in this profoundly educating and productive performance art.)

==Other small sanded-wood products==

The above cited suggestions for sanding with the flapdisc system are applicable to a wide range of office equipment, tool handles, etc. where scrapwood-based product can substitute for presently available product made with new wood, petroleum plastics, metal and other less eco-friendly materials.

==Shelfboards==

Most boards under 4'/1.3m are about as easily, and more cheaply, prepared with the disc sander system above, compared with a pricey handheld disc sander or belt sander, good as they are.

1.  Stand facing the table- or bench-height 24-grit flapdisc and keep moving the board in a systematic way while pressing the board against the left side of the disc, mostly sanding crossgrain because though this may make the board slightly less flat the main thing is to kill splinters.

a.  When sanding sides and edges at the left (your left) end of the board, hold most of the board securely under your right armpit and press with your left hand from behind the board.

b.  When sanding sides and edges at the right (your right) end, hold board securely under your left armpit and press with your right hand from behind the board.

c.  Sand at a 45 degree angle all the way around each end (holding the board pointing down 45 degrees toward where it contacts the sandpaper) before sanding the flat end.  Rounding all edges will solve at least 90% of all splinter problems.

==1. Make a collection of at least ten different kinds of fossils and label each with its name and geographic location. ==
Fossils are found in many places where sedimentary rocks, such as claystones, shales, limestones, and sandstones, are exposed. Only certain sedimentary rocks harbored the appropriate environmental conditions to preserve and yield fossils, which are often concentrated along particular bedding planes within the rocks.
===Finding Fossils===
Fossils are generally found in sedimentary rock with differentiated strata representing a succession of deposited material.

The occurrence of fossil bearing material depends on environmental factors before and after the time of preservation. After death, the first preserving factor is a rapid burial in water bodies or terrestrial sediment which would help in preserving the specimen. These rocks types are usually termed clastic rock, and are further subdivided into fine, medium and coarse grained material. While fossil's can be found in all grain typed, more detailed specimens are found in the fine grained material.  A second type of burial is the non-clastic rock, form where the rock is made up of the precipitation of compacted fossil material, types of rock include limestone and coal. The third fossil bearing material is the evaporates, which precipitate out of concentrated dissolved salts to form nodular deposits, examples include rock salt and phosphate concentrations. The evaporates are usually associated with gastropod, algae, vertebrate, and trace fossils.

Areas where sedimentary rocks are being eroded include exposed Mountainous areas, river banks and beds and engineering features like quarries and road cuts. Generally in appearance, a fossil will be either a different color to the surrounding rock, because of the different mineral content, will have a defining shape and texture or a combination of both. Dried up natural lake beads and caves in the form of pitfall traps also has an occurrence of a recent fossil fauna for the locality as is the case with Cuddie Springs and Naracoorte Caves in Australia.

Fossils are not to be found in areas of igneous rock (except in some beds between lava flows). In rocks which have undergone metamorphism, they are usually so distorted that they are difficult to recognize or have been destroyed completely.

Artificial exposures, such as road cuttings or quarries, can often be good collecting spots, along with continually eroding river or coastal exposures. Coal mining operations often yield excellent fossil plants, but the best ones are to be found not in the coal itself but in the associated sedimentary rock deposits called ''coal measures''.

In hilly regions the best sections are often those exposed at the sides of streams that have cut into the bedrock.

Wave washed sea cliffs and foreshore exposures are often good places to search for fossils, but always be aware of the state of the tides in the area. Never take chances by climbing high cliffs of crumbling rock or clay (many have died attempting it).

Exposures of softer rocks, such as clays and sands, can be good collecting spots. However inland sections tend to degrade rapidly, becoming overgrown, and are lost forever.

===Collecting Ethics===
To collect fossils, there are various legal realities that must be observed. Permission should be sought before collection begins on private land.

Hammering the rocks in national parks and other areas of natural beauty is often discouraged and in most cases is illegal.

===Equipment===
It is important to have the right kind of field equipment when looking for fossils, and safety should always be an important concern.

A hard hat is essential protection from loose stones that may be dislodged from cliffs above, but will not protect the wearer from larger falling rocks. Hard hats are normally a requirement in operational quarries.

Safety goggles and protective gloves are also essential, as rocks can be sharp and dangerous; safety goggles will protect eyes from chips produced while hammering, and gloves protect the hands.

A collector need dress appropriately for collecting trips, taking into account the climate and terrain of the area. Sturdy footwear, such as walking or hiking boots with steel toes, are recommended. A hammer, chisel and wrapping materials are the basic equipment required for fossil collecting, along with a stout rucksack or canvas bag for carrying equipment and fossil finds. The steel of many ordinary hammers is too soft for use on most type of rock. The steel may splinter, and the flying fragments cause injury to the person using the hammer, or others in the vicinity. The hammer should always strike away from the body. The head of a geological hammer or rock pick is made from specially hardened steel designed for use on rocks. The head is either firmly attached to a wooden shaft, or the hammer have the head and the shaft formed from one piece of steel. The head may have any combination of a square face, a tapered point, or a straight chisel edge. The point of such picks are not meant for striking rock directly, but for tapping rock (such as shale) open along planes and for prying: the hammer end is used for striking.

A convenient weight for a general purpose geological hammer or rock pick is around 1 kg (2 to 3 pounds). For breaking very hard rocks one may need a hammer of between 3 and 6.5 kg (7 and 14 pounds) in weight, with a correspondingly longer and thicker shaft. A hammer that is too heavy is tiring to use and results in unsafe work.

==2. Have a brief definition of each of the following in your notebook: == 
;a. Geology: Geology is the science and study of the solid matter that constitutes the Earth.

;b. Fossils: Fossils are the mineralized or otherwise preserved remains or traces (such as footprints) of animals, plants, and other organisms.
;c. Catastrophism: Catastrophism is the idea that Earth has been affected by sudden, short-lived, violent events that were sometimes worldwide in scope.
;d. Paleontology:  Paleontology is the study of prehistoric life forms on Earth through the examination of plant and animal fossils.
;e. Graptolite: A Graptolite is a fossil colonial animal known chiefly from the Upper Cambrian through the Lower Carboniferous (Mississippian) periods.
;f. Trilobite: Trilobites are extinct arthropods that form the class Trilobita. They appeared in the 2nd Epoch (Series 2) of the Cambrian period and flourished throughout the lower Paleozoic era before beginning a drawn-out decline to extinction when, during the Late Devonian extinction, all trilobite orders, with the sole exception of Proetida, died out.
;g. Dinosaur: A dinosaur is any of various extinct reptiles.
;h. Mammoth: A mammoth is any species of an extinct genus of proboscidean (elephants and their extinct relatives), often with long curved tusks and, in northern species, a covering of long hair.
;i. Mastodon: Mastodons are members of the extinct genus Mammut of the order Proboscidea and form the family Mammutidae; they resembled, but were distinct from, the woolly mammoth which belongs to the family Elephantidae. Mastodons were browsers and mammoths were grazers.
;j. Crinoid: Crinoids, also known as &quot;sea lilies&quot; or &quot;feather-stars&quot;, are marine animals that make up the class Crinoidea of the echinoderms (phylum Echinodermata).  There are only a few hundred known modern forms, but crinoids were much more numerous both in species and numbers in the past. Some thick limestone beds dating to the mid- to late-Paleozoic are entirely made up of disarticulated crinoid fragments.
;k. Lingula: Lingula is a genus of brachiopods.
;l. Calamite: A fossil made when sediment filled the hollow stem of a plant.
;m. Foraminifera:  The Foraminifera are a large group of unicellular organisms with reticulating pseudopods, fine strands of cytoplasm that branch and merge to form a dynamic net. They typically produce a test, or shell, which can have either one or multiple chambers, some becoming quite elaborate in structure. About 275,000 species are recognized, both living and fossil.
;n. Radiolaria: Radiolaria are amoeboid protozoa that produce intricate mineral skeletons, typically with a central capsule dividing the cell into inner and outer portions, called endoplasm and ectoplasm. They are found as zooplankton throughout the ocean, and because of their rapid turn-over of species, their tests are important diagnostic fossils found from the Cambrian onwards.
;o. Paleozoic: The Paleozoic Era is the earliest of three geologic eras of the Phanerozoic eon. The Paleozoic era is defined by geologists as spanning from roughly 542 million years ago to roughly 251 million years ago.

;p. Mesozoic: Lying between the Paleozoic and the Cenozoic, Mesozoic means 'middle animals'. It is often called the 'Age of the Dinosaurs'.
;q. Cenozoic: The Cenozoic Era is the latest of three geologic eras of the Phanerozoic eon.  Geologists define this era as having started about 65 million years ago, when the age of the dinosaurs ended.
;r. Pleistocene: The Pleistocene epoch on the geologic timescale is the period from 1,808,000 to 11,550 years before present. The Pleistocene epoch had been intended to cover the world's recent period of repeated glaciations, or the Ice Age.
;s. Paleobotany: Paleobotany is the branch of paleontology or paleobiology dealing with the recovery and identification of plant remains from geological contexts, and their use for the biological reconstruction of past environments. Paleobotany includes the study of terrestrial plant fossils, as well as the study of prehistoric marine photoautotrophs, such as photosynthetic algae, seaweeds or kelp.
;t. Pelecypod: Pelecypod are molluscs belonging to the class Bivalvia. They typically have two-part shells, with both valves being symmetrical along the hinge line. The class has 30,000 species, including scallops, clams, oysters and mussels.
;u. Brachiopod: Brachiopods are two-shelled marine animals with an external morphology superficially resembling pelecypods (for instance, clams) of phylum Mollusca to which they are not closely related. It is estimated by paleobiologists that 99 percent of all documented lamp-shell species are both fossils and extinct.

==3. Visit a museum where fossils are on display and make a written or oral report of your trip. ==
Most museums of natural history will have a fossil collection, and even small museums are likely to have a few.  If you do not know of such a museum in your area, the Internet is your friend.  Try searching for &quot;fossil,&quot; &quot;museum,&quot; and the name of your locality.  If you are still unsure, get a list of local museums and call them.  They will be happy to tell you if they have fossils on display, and if they do not, they may be able to direct you to a museum that does.

After the visit, have your Pathfinders either write their reports or present one orally.  This would be a great topic for worship during your club's opening exercises, or during a campout.

==4. Describe the process of the proper removal of delicate specimens. Tell how a skeleton of a dinosaur or other gigantic fossil would be removed. Why should beginners not remove such specimens? What should be done by the beginner when he finds what is obviously a valuable fossil? ==
===Removal of delicate specimens===
For extracting fossils from harder rocks, a sturdy mallet and cold steel chisels may also be required. Usually one needs a range of chisels in size from small ones with a sharp edge of about 1 cm (quarter of an inch), to much larger and heavier chisels. A broad-bladed chisel is often very useful for splitting rocks along their bedding plane.

Different types of rocks will break differently and a beginner should put in a little practice, getting the feel for a particular type of rock before he or she starts hammering out fossils. It is all too easy to ruin a specimen with one ill-placed blow of a hammer.

Extracting a specimen that is embedded in solid rock may prove to be a long and difficult process. Before attempting to extract a specimen, the collector should make sure that it is feasible to remove it without destroying or damaging it. Leaving sufficient rock beneath the specimen to protect it from fracturing; excess matrix can be trimmed at a later time.

For soft sediments and unconsolidated deposits, such as sands, silts and clays, a spade and a flat-bladed trowel or stout bladed knife may be the most useful tools for clearing the area around a fossil. Brushes are also useful for removing loose sediment from around fossils.

A sieve is used to separate fossils from sands and gravels. A smaller mesh is required in order to avoid losing small fossils. One practical difficulty with using sieves in the field is that they easily become clogged, especially when the material sieved has a high moisture content. However, under dry weather conditions the more durable fossils, such as teeth and bones, can be quickly and easily sieved out of loose sands. Shaking the sieve is always liable to damage or destroy fragile fossils.

If there is water available, such as on a beach or next to a stream, the material containing the fossils can be sieved wet and the matrix gradually washed away. Wet sieving is a technique that is frequently used for the collection of small mammalian fossils, and by using this technique even the smallest specimens may be recovered.

===Removing gigantic fossils===
Occasionally, large fragile specimens may need to be surrounded and supported using a jacket of plaster before their removal from the rock: This protects the fossil, protecting it from shattering. If a fossil is to be left in situ, a cast may be produced, using plaster of paris or latex - while not preserving every detail, such a cast is inexpensive, easier to transport, causes less damage to the environment, and leaves the fossil in place for others to enjoy. Subtle fossils which are preserved solely as impressions in sandy layers, such as the Ediacaran fossils, are usually sampled by means of a cast, which shows up detail more clearly than the rock itself.

===Valuable fossils===
If you find an obviously valuable fossil, you should contact a professional.  It is too easy to ruin a fossil by attempting to remove it yourself.  Leave the extraction in the hands of an experienced collector.  If you find such a fossil on public land, contact the authority responsible for the land.  The fossil belongs to them, and they have the right to decide what to do with it.  To find a professional, contact a museum or a local university.  If they do not have one on staff, they will be able to refer you to one.

==5. Explain the difference in the account scientists give for the presence of fossils as related by evolutionists and creationists. ==
Evolutionists and creationists both agree that fossils are formed when a creature is quickly buried in sediment.  They disagree on how long ago this happened.  Evolutionists believe most fossils were made millions of years ago.  Creationists believe that nearly all fossils were made during Noah's flood less than 10,000 years ago.

==6. From the Bible and writings of Ellen G. White cite statements to explain the origin of the following: &lt;br&gt;a. Coal &lt;br&gt;b. Petroleum &lt;br&gt;c. Fossils &lt;br&gt;d. Limestone==
{| border=1 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=5  width=75% align=&quot;center&quot;
|-
!From Patriarchs and Prophets, pp 107, 108
|-
|''Everywhere were strewn the dead bodies of men and beasts. The Lord would not permit these to remain to decompose and pollute the air, therefore He made of the earth a vast burial ground. A violent wind which was caused to blow for the purpose of drying up the waters, moved them with great force, in some instances even carrying away the tops of the mountains and heaping up trees, rocks, and earth above the bodies of the dead.''

''At this time immense forests were buried. These have since been changed to coal, forming the extensive coal beds that now exist, and also yielding large quantities of oil. The coal and oil frequently ignite and burn beneath the surface of the earth. Thus rocks are heated, limestone is burned, and iron ore melted.''
|}
The Bible itself offers no explicit explanation of coal, petroleum, fossils, or limestone, though it does contain the story of Noah's flood (see Genesis chapters 6-9).  In this account, the whole earth is covered by water, and all life, except those in the ark, is lost.  The Biblical account of creation rejects the notion of hundred of millions of years of evolution, stating with clarity that God created the world in six days.  In Genesis chapter 5, the Bible also provides genealogies of the Patriarchs, including their ages when they had children and when they died.  From this, and from other historical records, the Bible sets the age of the Earth at about 6000 years.

She is also a writer, although hasn't had very much published and a musician, but isn't very good at that either. One day, she'll find her place on Earth...

This girl is a fan of non-English music, especially Japanese ''Visual Kei'' and German ''Tanzmetall''. Amongst her favourite bands are Nightmare, Maximum the Hormone and Rammstein. She also enjoys listening to Gackt, and has just realised how truly depressing and realistic his songs really are. If anyone wants to know how she feels, right now, whack a few of his songs on, grab a tissue and enjoy.

Occasionally, Phoenix writes fiction, such as [http://angel-lithium-lit.deviantart.com/art/Angels-ONE-Wanted-52425043 |Fallen Angels], which needs serious updating.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Structure of the Book ==

A number of ways of organising this material are possible:
* ad-hoc question and answer discussion 
* topics  in time, addressing the tasks which make up the flow of development from initiation through writing editing publishing and .. pulping.
* topics by type of artefact - proposal, contract, book, supporting web-side, pod-cast and the means, both social and technical for their development



=== Ground rules ===

* don't use the discussion pages -its all discussion - discussion pages don't come up in the list of recent changes so contributions there  tend to get missed 

* use 4 tildes to sign a contribution if it expressed as a personal opinion.

=== Initial Structure ===

All designs go through a phase of divergence , in which ideas, possibilities and problems spring to mind, and convergence , when ideas must be filtered, sorted , structured , decisions made.

A collaborative wikibook might be expected to go through the same sequence, so initially the book will be structured with questions and ensuing discussion, later to be re-shaped into a more coherent set of patterns as they emerge</text>

==Ingredients==
All ingredients are added to taste - quantities don't matter too much in this recipe

*I tin tomatoes (chopped, whole, whatever you like, as long as it has juice)
*Cheese (to taste - type doesn't matter, just so long as it melts)
*1 tsp cornflour

'''&quot;Pizza Toppings&quot;'''&lt;br&gt;
You can add whatever you like here in whichever quantity you like. Some ideas:

* Ham
* Mushrooms
* Peppers
* Bacon
* Sweetcorn

==Utensils==
* Knife (or knives, depending on ingredients)
* Chopping board(s)
* Saucepan
* Cheese grater
* Spoon
* Blender (optional)

==Procedure==
# Make the base of the soup
## Chop the tomatoes and add them to the saucepan with the juice. Water can be added if necessary. 
## Grate some cheese (for this part I would use at least a handful, depending on the size of your pan) and add to the pan.
## Add cornflour, if required
## Stir, and leave to stand on a low/medium heat until the cheese has melted. More may be added to taste
## For a smoother soup, you could blend it at this point.
# Add your chosen &quot;toppings&quot;.
## Chop or slice the toppings, making sure your chunks aren't too large (unless you like chunky soup)
## Add to the pan and heat again
# Serve
## Extra cheese may be added to top.
## Enjoy</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Is anything in particular going on in this page? [[User:PhoenixBlitzkrieg|PhoenixBlitzkrieg]] ([[User talk:PhoenixBlitzkrieg|talk]]) 21:56, 8 March 2008 (UTC)

== Correct pronuntiation of です ==

The article states that '&quot;desu&quot; is usually pronounced as &quot;dess&quot;'. That is wrong. This varies in the region of japan and is right to say both ways. It's just like an &quot;accent&quot;. --[[User:Luis Sergio Moura|Luis Sergio Moura]] ([[User talk:Luis Sergio Moura|talk]]) 14:36, 2 April 2008 (UTC)

== &quot;Nanori&quot; (title) is strange ==

We don't use &quot;Nanori&quot; independently in Japan.
And &quot;Nanori&quot; derives fron &quot;Nanoru&quot; which is a verb.
So I think the title &quot;Nanoru&quot; is better than &quot;Nanori&quot;.</text>

      <comment>A reminder: books vs. movies</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Philosopher's Stone ==

Just a reminder that we are talking about the books, not the movies. An earlier editor had Flint hit a bludger at Wood that knocked him through the hoops and out of play. That did happen, but only in the movie; in the book, that sort of dirty play did not happen until the third year, and even there Wood didn't get knocked through the hoops, though he did get double-teamed with bludgers.</text>

      <comment>/* What writing system(s) does this language use? */general cleanup, [[WP:AWB/T|typos fixed]]: english → English using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt; {{ {{BOOKTEMPLATE}} }}&lt;/noinclude&gt;
==What writing system(s) does this language use?==
Māori originally had no writing system. Later the Māoris used the same system as we do in English. Their alphabet is slightly different though. h, k, m, n, p, r, t, w, a, e, i, o, u, wh, ng .&quot;A&quot; is said like in &quot;car&quot;. &quot;E&quot; like in &quot;bear&quot;. &quot;I&quot; like the &quot;e&quot;s in tree.
==How many people speak this language?==
The 2006 New Zealand Census found that 157,000 people can have a basic Māori conversation. It is believed around 29,000 can speak Māori fluently.
==Where is this language spoken?==
Māori is mostly spoken in New Zealand. Particularly in the North Island.
==What is the history of this language?==
==Who are some famous authors or poets in this language?==
==What are some basic words in this language that I can learn?==
* Hello - Kia ora
* How are you? - Kei te pēhea koe?
* Good luck - Kia waimarie
* Do you speak Māori? - He reo Māori tōu?

==What is a simple song/poem/story that I can learn in this language?==
This is the Haka. It is sung by the All Blacks rugby team before games. It was a traditional Māori war chant.
KA MATE!
KA MATE!

Originally starting from the obvious need to produce technical books, I have backtracked to explore the whole subject of profession development for software practioners. In the session I will be surveying the learning resources actually used  by  the attendees in their last learning episode, and from there look at how they were used in order to understand the changing role of the prin book and its structure.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Please note that the groups of cations mentioned/discussed here do not refer to the groups of the periodic table! The various cations have been arranged into several groups for the purpose of qualitative analysis and these are the groups that we are talking about.

--&gt;Insert a proper explanation of groups. Also accompany with a table.

==Group I==
In the first group of cations, we include Silver(I), Mercury(I)and Lead(II) cations.  Before we begin, it is good to note that mercury(I) ions - or mercurous ions - are NOT Hg&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; but Hg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;.

The group reagent is dilute Hydrochloric acid.

When we pass dil. Hcl through the solution, we expect the precipitation of the chlorides of the aforementioned cations. ANY Precipitation is nothing but a chloride and the cation of the ppt. can not be any other than the three.

If a ppt is obtained, group I cations are confirmed. If not, we wll test the solution for the presence of group II cations.

Suppose we obtain a ppt on adding dil. HCl to the solution. It is inferred that the cation in the solution is either Ag+, Hg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;2+ or Pb2+.

Our goal now would be to distinguish between these three cations.

Before we pass onto this section, please realize that dil. HCl was added to only a part of the solution, taken in another testtube. The rest of the solution would be preserved for use in other tsts should it be needed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Since the inception of the World Wide Web and its general acceptance in the 1990s, internet engineers have exploited the capability of linkage to endeavor deeper into the semantic purposes of the web. Long gone are the days when the web was considered an alternative to other communication media. These days however, it is anything but. From music to video, richer multimedia content has revolutionized the power of links into something far superior that it was when it was designed.

Fueled by the collective intellect of people from all corners of the globe, the Internet is growing at an accelerated speed. Internet can no longer be called a technology, Internet is the people!

People brought together under the banner of a common interest, e.g., skiing, paragliding, etc., on the Internet form an online [[w:Virtual community|virtual community]] dubbed a '''web community'''. Trivial as it may sound, the notion of a community on the web has been the subject of many a books in the past decade and people have refrained from focusing more on the core technologies that build the web like HTML, JavaScript and CSS and rather thinking of ways of manipulating user interactions, interventions and interests to weave a social network.

This book in its concise form would give its readers a bird's eye view of the basics of developing such an online community, its pros and cons along with actual examples of work by others on the concept.

== What this book is about? ==
'''Community design fundamentals for the web''' - Throughout this book, we will be exploring different types of communities on the web and the very basic fundamentals they are racked upon. We will also look into a chronological evolution of design for such communities and peek into community building ideologies explored into by virtual community pioneers and experts.

'''Tools and best practices''' - This book encourages the readers to focus on an array of best practices and tools for the creation of communities using key pointers from these very community researchers. Along the brick road, we may also focus on some of the many trends that are brewing towards a truly new breed of communities called Community 2.0.

== What this book is ''not'' about? ==
'''Not much technical babble involved''' - At some points, this book might even touch some technical aspects of community design albeit only where necessary. In its entirety, this book serves only as a text supplementing core concepts of community design and would not fall into deeper technicalities of it thereof. Advice on collection and usage of user-collected data may sometimes address some technical issues.

'''Building upon works and not just adoption''' - This book would be using existing web communities as a tool to teach robust design and in no way tends to limit readers into adopting similar concepts but rather advises them to use this text to think up original and creative experiences out of the box.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want a method for creating a rating system for items, such as a five-star rating for a product or service.

== Method ==
Each registered user in a system can rate items.  A separate collection associates users with ratings.  Ratings can be placed anywhere in a form and can associate a user to an item and that association has a numeric value of 1 to 5.  Items can then display their average user rating.

|description=Saanen goats are a white breed of goat which are the largest of the dairy breeds. Does typically weigh 150 lb (68 kg) or more, with bucks weighing over 200 lb (91 kg). The Saanen breed also produces the most milk (as a breed- there will be good and poor individuals in any breed) and tends to have a lower butterfat content, about 2.5%-3%. The Saanen temperament is as a rule, calm and mild mannered; breeders have been know to refer to them as living marshmallows. Saanen goats are easier for children to handle and are popular in the showmanship classes due to their calm nature. With solid white coats and pink skin these extremely mild tempered goats are heavy milkers. They originated from Switzerland.

|description=
The '''Toggenburg''' is named after the region in Switzerland where the breed originated, the Toggenburg valley. Toggenburgs are medium in size, moderate in production, and have relatively low butterfat content (2-3%) in their milk. The color is solid varying from light fawn to dark chocolate with no preference for any shade. Distinct white markings are as follows: white ears with dark spot in middle; two white stripes down the face from above each eye to the muzzle; hind legs white from hocks to hooves; forelegs white from knees downward with a dark line (band) below knee acceptable; a white triangle on either side of the tail. Wattles, small rudimentary nubs of skin located on each side of the neck, are often present in this breed. The Toggenburg underwent a development program when introduced to Britain - the resulting British Toggenburg being heavier and having improved milk quality. By the middle of the year 2002, 4146 Toggenburgs had been registered with the New Zealand Dairy Goat Breeders Association, representing 8.10% of registered dairy goats. They perform better in cooler conditions. They are the oldest known dairy breed of goats.

|image =Nubische geiten.jpg
|description = 
The '''Anglo-Nubian''', or simply '''Nubian''' in the United States, is a breed of domestic goat developed in Great Britain of native milking stock and goats from the Middle East and North Africa. Its distinguishing characteristics include large, pendulous  ears and a &quot;Roman&quot; nose.  Due to their Middle-Eastern heritage, Anglo-Nubians can live in very hot climates and have a longer breeding season than other dairy goats.  Considered a dairy or dual-purpose breed, Anglo- Nubians are known for the high butterfat content of their milk, although on average, the breed produces less volume of milk than other dairy breeds.  Anglo-Nubians are large, with does weighing around 64 kg. The average height of the breed, measured at the withers, is 81 cm for does and 94 cm for bucks.  Like most dairy goats, they are normally kept hornless by disbudding within approximately two weeks of birth.

|description=
The Alpine is a large breed of dairy goat which may have a variety of coat colors. British Alpines are black with white markings.  They are best suited to temperate climates and do not do well in humid environments.  Alpines have erect ears, and multiple coat colors are acceptable. The Alpines are excellent milkers and can produce milk over an extended period of time. The Alpine is the second most registered of the dairy breeds. Average milk fat content for Alpines was 3.5 percent in 2003 and average milk production per doe was 2,083 pounds, according to national Dairy Herd Improvement statistics.

|description=The merino is the most numerous breed of sheep in the world. It is a breed prized for its wool, although more recently the low price of wool has led to more of an emphasis on its meat. Super fine merinos are regarded as having the finest and softest wool of any sheep.

The '''Rambouillet''' is also known as the Rambouillet Merino or the French Merino. 
The fleece was valuable in the manufacture of cloth, at times being woven in a mixed fabric of cotton warp and wool weft, known as delaines. 

The breed is well known for its wool, but also for its meat, both lamb and mutton.  It has been described as a dual-purpose breed, with superior wool and near-mutton breed characteristics.

|name = Shropshire
|image = Dark-faced Norfolk sheep.jpg
|description =
The '''Shropshire breed of sheep''' originated from the hills of Shropshire, and North Staffordshire, England, during the 1840's. The breeders in the area used the local horned black-faced sheep and crossed them with a few breeds of white-faced sheep (Southdown, Cotswold , and Leicester). This produced a medium sized hornless sheep that produced good wool and meat. 

The breed's adaptability to most environments and their dual-purpose nature led to them quickly becoming a popular breed. 

Today's modern Shropshire isone of the most numerous breeds of sheep (especially in the mid-west). Its gentle nature and medium size makes it very popular with 4H exhibitors. The mature weights for Shropshire rams is between 225 to 250 pounds and between 150 to 180 pounds for the females.

|name = Hampshire
|image = Mouton Hampshire.JPG
|description =
The Hampshire is a breed of sheep developed from the Southdowns.
The Southdowns had long had sheep which had dark brown or black legs, matured early, produced the best of mutton and a fine quality of medium wool. The original Hampshire was larger, coarser, but hardier, slower to mature, with inferior flesh, and a longer but coarser wool. The Southdown had always been remarkable for its power of transmitting its special characteristics to its progeny by other kinds of sheep, and hence it soon impressed its own characteristics on its progeny by the Hampshire. The horns of the original breed have disappeared; the face and legs have become dark, the frame has become more compact, the bones smaller, the back broader and straighter, the legs shorter, and the flesh and wool of better quality, while the superior hardiness and greater size, as well as the large head and Roman nose of the old breed, still remain. Hampshires of the 1890s matured early and fattened readily. They clipped from six to seven pounds of wool, suitable for combing, which was longer than Southdown wool, but less fine. 

The resultant mutton had a desirable proportion of fat and lean, and was juicy and fine flavored; the lambs were large and were usually dropped early and fed for market.

|name = Lincoln
|image = o_aye.jpg
|description =
The '''Lincoln Longwool''' is a breed of sheep from England that has been significantly altered by selective breeding in the later part of the eighteenth century. Cross-breeding with Leicesters improved the breed's meat production qualities.

The Lincoln Longwool is the largest British sheep, developed specifically to produce the heaviest, longest and most lustrous fleece of any breed in the world. Great numbers were exported to many countries to improve the size and wool quality of their native breeds. The versatile fleece is in great demand for spinning, weaving and many other crafts.

The adult has a body weight of about 60 kg, its fleece can weigh up to 7 kg with a diameter of about 40 microns and a staple ranging up to 32&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{TopNav|prev=Introduction|next=Trigonometry}}

==Topic 2: Core - Functions and Equations==

===The Axis of Symmetry for the Graph of a Quadratic Function===
&lt;math&gt;f(x) = a(x-p)^2 + q&lt;/math&gt;

The axis of symmetry is &lt;math&gt;x = p&lt;/math&gt;

Ex. &lt;math&gt;y = 2(x+3)^2 + 4&lt;/math&gt;

The axis of symmetry of the graph is &lt;math&gt;x = -3&lt;/math&gt;

===Solving Quadratics===
Quadratic Equations are in the form &lt;math&gt;f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c&lt;/math&gt; or in the form &lt;math&gt;a(x-p)^2 + q&lt;/math&gt;. To be solved the equations either have to be factored or be solved using the
quadratic formula : &lt;math&gt;\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}&lt;/math&gt;

Ex. &lt;math&gt;y = x^2 + 2x - 1&lt;/math&gt;
Since this cannot be factored, it is possible to use the quadratic formula
&lt;math&gt;x = -1 \pm \sqrt{5}&lt;/math&gt;
====Discriminant====
The discriminant of the equation is important in determining whether the equation has 2, 1, 0 roots
The equation of the discriminant: &lt;math&gt;b^2 - 4ac&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;b^2 - 4ac &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; : The equation has 2 real roots

&lt;math&gt;b^2 - 4ac = 0&lt;/math&gt; : The equation has 1 real root

&lt;math&gt;b^2 - 4ac &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt; : The equation has 0 real roots

If the middle number is even in &lt;math&gt;ax^2 + bx + c&lt;/math&gt; then the discriminant can be calculated as 
&lt;math&gt;\frac{b^2}{4} - ac&lt;/math&gt;. The properties of this modified equation remain the same

===Higher level Functions===
These functions have a degree of two or higher and as a result have more than 2 roots. An example of a higher polynomial function is y = x&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; − 2x. This is a cubic equation, with three roots. To find these roots just factor the equation. In this case, it becomes, x(x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;−2). From here you can factor using the difference of squares (a&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;−b&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Thus the equation then becomes, y=x(x+√2)(x−√2). The roots of the equation then become 0,±√2.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Some additional background on [[Fundamentals of Transportation/Destination Choice]]

== History ==

Over the years, modelers have used several different formulations of trip distribution. The first was the Fratar or Growth model (which did not differentiate trips by purpose). This structure extrapolated a base year trip table to the future based on growth, but took no account of changing spatial accessibility due to increased supply or changes in travel patterns and congestion. 

The next models developed were the gravity model  and the intervening opportunities model. The most widely used formulation is still the gravity model. 

While studying traffic in Baltimore, Maryland, Alan Voorhees developed a mathematical formula to predict traffic patterns based on land use. This formula has been instrumental in the design of numerous transportation and public works projects around the world. He wrote &quot;A General Theory of Traffic Movement,&quot; (Voorhees, 1956) which applied the gravity model to trip distribution, which translates [[trip generation|trips generated]] in an area to a matrix that identifies the number of trips from each origin to each destination, which can then be loaded onto the network.

Evaluation of several model forms in the 1960s concluded that &quot;the gravity model and intervening opportunity model proved of about equal reliability and utility in simulating the 1948 and 1955 trip distribution for Washington, D.C.&quot; (Heanue and Pyers 1966). The Fratar model was shown to have weakness in areas experiencing land use changes. As comparisons between the models showed that either could be calibrated equally well to match observed conditions, because of computational ease, gravity models became more widely spread than intervening opportunities models. Some theoretical problems with the intervening opportunities model were discussed by Whitaker and West (1968) concerning its inability to account for all trips generated in a zone which makes it more difficult to calibrate, although techniques for dealing with the limitations have been developed by Ruiter (1967).

With the development of logit and other discrete choice techniques, new, demographically disaggregate approaches to travel demand were attempted. By including variables other than travel time in determining the probability of making a trip, it is expected to have a better prediction of travel behavior. The logit model and gravity model have been shown by Wilson (1967) to be of essentially the same form as used in statistical mechanics, the entropy maximization model. The application of these models differ in concept in that the gravity model uses impedance by travel time, perhaps stratified by socioeconomic variables, in determining the probability of trip making, while a discrete choice approach brings those variables inside the utility or impedance function. Discrete choice models  require more information to estimate and more computational time. 

Ben-Akiva and Lerman (1985) have developed combination destination choice and mode choice models using a logit formulation for work and non-work trips.  Because of computational intensity, these formulations tended to aggregate traffic zones into larger districts or rings in estimation.  In current application, some models, including for instance the transportation planning model used in Portland, Oregon use a logit formulation for destination choice. Allen (1984) used utilities from a logit based mode choice model in determining composite impedance for trip distribution.  However, that approach, using mode choice log-sums implies that destination choice depends on the same variables  as mode choice.  Levinson and Kumar (1995) employ mode choice probabilities as a weighting factor and develops a specific impedance function or “f-curve”  for each mode for work and non-work trip purposes.

== Mathematics ==

At this point in the transportation planning process, the information for zonal interchange analysis is organized in an origin-destination table.  On the left is listed trips produced in each zone.  Along the top are listed the zones, and for each zone we list its attraction.  The table is ''n'' x ''n'', where ''n'' = the number of zones.  

Each cell in our table is to contain the number of trips from zone ''i'' to zone ''j''.  We do not have these within cell numbers yet, although we have the row and column totals.  With data organized this way, our task is to fill in the cells for tables headed ''t=1'' through say ''t=n''.

Actually, from home interview travel survey data and attraction analysis we have the cell information for ''t = 1''.  The data are a sample, so we generalize the sample to the universe.  The techniques used for zonal interchange analysis explore the empirical rule that fits the ''t = 1'' data.  That rule is then used to generate cell data for ''t = 2'', ''t = 3'', ''t = 4'', etc., to ''t = n''.

The first technique developed to model zonal interchange involves a model such as this:

&lt;math&gt;
T_{ij}  = T_i\frac{{T_j f\left( {C_{ij} } \right)K_{ij} }}
{{\sum_{j = 1}^n {T_j f\left( {C_{ij} } \right)K_{ij} } }}
&lt;/math&gt;

where:
* &lt;math&gt;T_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; : trips from i to j.
* &lt;math&gt;T_i&lt;/math&gt; : trips from i, as per our generation analysis
* &lt;math&gt;T_j&lt;/math&gt; : trips attracted to  j, as per our generation analysis
* &lt;math&gt;f(C_{ij})&lt;/math&gt; : travel cost friction factor, say = &lt;math&gt;C_{ij}^b&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;K_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; : Calibration parameter
 
Zone ''i'' generates &lt;math&gt;T_i&lt;/math&gt; trips; how many will go to zone ''j''?  That depends on the attractiveness of ''j'' compared to the attractiveness of all places;  attractiveness is tempered by the distance a zone is from zone ''i''. We compute the fraction comparing ''j'' to all places and multiply &lt;math&gt;T_i&lt;/math&gt; by it.

The rule is often of a gravity form:

&lt;math&gt;
T_{ij}  = a\frac{{P_i P_j }} {{C_{ij}^b }}
&lt;/math&gt;

where:
* &lt;math&gt;P_i; P_j&lt;/math&gt; : populations of  ''i''  and  ''j''
* &lt;math&gt;a; b&lt;/math&gt; :  parameters


But in the zonal interchange mode, we use numbers related to trip origins (&lt;math&gt;T_i&lt;/math&gt;) and trip destinations (&lt;math&gt;T_j&lt;/math&gt;) rather than populations.

There are lots of model forms because we may use weights and special calibration parameters, e.g., one could write say: 

&lt;math&gt;
T_{ij}  = a\frac{{T_i^c T_j^d }}
{{C_{ij}^b }}
&lt;/math&gt;

or 
&lt;math&gt;
T_{ij}  = \frac{{cT_i dT_j }}
{{C_{ij}^b }}
&lt;/math&gt;

where:
* ''a, b, c, d'' are parameters
* &lt;math&gt;C_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; : travel cost (e.g. distance, money, time)
* &lt;math&gt;T_j&lt;/math&gt; : inbound trips, destinations
* &lt;math&gt;T_i&lt;/math&gt; : outbound trips, origin

== Entropy Analysis ==

Wilson (1970) gives us another way to think about zonal interchange problem.  This section treats Wilson’s methodology to give a grasp of central ideas.
	To start, consider some trips where we have seven people in origin zones commuting to seven jobs in destination zones.  One configuration of such trips will be:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
|+'''Table: Configuration of Trips'''

!3

|}

&lt;math&gt;
w\left( {T_{ij} } \right) = \frac{{7!}}
{{2!1!1!0!2!1!}} = 1260
&lt;/math&gt;


where &lt;math&gt;0!=1&lt;/math&gt;
	
That configuration can appear in 1,260 ways.  We have calculated the number of ways that configuration of trips might have occurred, and to explain the calculation, let’s recall those coin tossing experiments talked about so much in elementary statistics.
	The number of ways a two-sided coin can come up is 2n, where n is the number of times we toss the coin.  If we toss the coin once, it can come up heads or tails, 2*1 = 2.  If we toss it twice, it can come up  HH, HT, TH, or TT, 4 ways, and  2*2 = 4.  To ask the specific question about, say, four coins coming up all heads, we calculate  4!/4!0! =1 .  Two heads and two tails would be 4!/2!2! = 6.  We are solving the equation:

		
&lt;math&gt;
w = \frac{{n!}}
{{\prod_{i = 1}^n {n_i !} }}
&lt;/math&gt;


An important point is that as ''n'' gets larger, our distribution gets more and more peaked, and it is more and more reasonable to think of a most likely state.

However, the notion of most likely state comes not from this thinking; it comes from statistical mechanics, a field well known to Wilson and not so well known to transportation planners.  The result from statistical mechanics is that a descending series is most likely.  Think about the way the energy from lights in the classroom is affecting the air in the classroom.  If the effect resulted in an ascending series, many of the atoms and molecules would be affected a lot and a few would be affected a little.  The descending series would have a lot affected not at all or not much and only a few affected very much.  We could take a given level of energy and compute excitation levels in ascending and descending series.  Using the formula above, we would compute the ways particular series could occur, and we would concluded that descending series dominate. 

That’s more or less Boltzmann’s Law, 

&lt;math&gt;
p_j  = p_0 e^{\beta e_j } 
&lt;/math&gt;

That is, the particles at any particular excitation level, j, will be a negative exponential function of the particles in the ground state, &lt;math&gt;p_0&lt;/math&gt;, the excitation level, &lt;math&gt;e_j&lt;/math&gt;, and a parameter &lt;math&gt;beta&lt;/math&gt;, which is a function of the (average) energy available to the particles in the system.
	
The two paragraphs above have to do with ensemble methods of calculation developed by Gibbs, a topic well beyond the reach of these notes.

Returning to our O-D matrix, note that we have not used as much information as we would have from an O and D survey and from our earlier work on trip generation.  For the same travel pattern in the O-D matrix used before, we would have row and column totals, i.e.:
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
|+'''Table: Illustrative O-D Matrix with row and column totals'''

Consider the way the four folks might travel, 4!/2!1!1! = 12; consider three folks, 3!/0!2!1! = 3.  All travel can be combined in 12*3 = 36 ways.  The possible configuration of trips is, thus, seen to be much constrained by the column and row totals.

We put this point together with the earlier work with our matrix and the notion of most likely state to say that we want to

&lt;math&gt;
\max w\left( {T_{ij} } \right) = \frac{{T!}}
{{\prod_{ij} {Tij!} }} 
&lt;/math&gt;  

subject to

&lt;math&gt; 
\sum_j {T_{ij}  = T_i } ;
\sum_i {T_{ij}  = T_j }  
&lt;/math&gt;

where:
&lt;math&gt;
T = \sum_j {\sum_i {T_{ij} } }  = \sum_i {T_i }  = \sum_j {T_j } 
&lt;/math&gt;

and this is the problem that we have solved above.

Wilson adds another consideration; he constrains the system to the amount of energy available (i.e., money), and we have the additional constraint,

&lt;math&gt;
\sum_i {\sum_j {T_{ij} C_{ij}  = C} } 
&lt;/math&gt;


where ''C'' is the quantity of resources available and &lt;math&gt;C_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is the travel cost from ''i'' to ''j''.

The discussion thus far contains the central ideas in Wilson’s work, but we are not yet to the place where the reader will recognize the model as it is formulated by Wilson.

First, writing the function to be maximized using [[w:Lagrange multipliers|Lagrangian multipliers]], we have:

&lt;math&gt;
\frac{{T!}}
{{\prod_{ij} {Tij!} }} + \sum_i {\lambda _i \left( {T_i  - \sum_j {T_{ij} } } \right)}  + \sum_j {\lambda _j \left( {T_j  - \sum_i {T_{ij} } } \right) + \beta \left( {C - \sum_i {\sum_j {T_{ij} C_{ij} } } } \right)} 
&lt;/math&gt;

where  &lt;math&gt;\lambda_i, \lambda_j, and \beta&lt;/math&gt; are the Lagrange multipliers, &lt;math&gt;beta&lt;/math&gt; having an energy sense.

Second, it is convenient to maximize the natural log (ln) rather than  w(Tij), for then we may use [[w:Stirling's approximation|Stirling's approximation]].

&lt;math&gt;
\ln N! \approx N\ln N - N
&lt;/math&gt;

so
&lt;math&gt;
\frac{{\partial \ln N!}}
{{\partial N}} \approx \ln N
&lt;/math&gt;


Third, evaluating the maximum, we have

&lt;math&gt;
\frac{{\partial T}}
{{\partial T_{ij} }} =  - \ln T_{ij}  - \lambda _i  - \lambda _j  - \beta C_{ij}  = 0
&lt;/math&gt;


with solution

&lt;math&gt;
\ln T_{ij}  =  - \lambda _i  - \lambda _j  - \beta C_{ij} 
&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;
T_{ij}  = e^{ - \lambda _i  - \lambda _j  - \beta C_{ij} } 
&lt;/math&gt;



Finally, substituting this value of  &lt;math&gt;T_ij&lt;/math&gt;  back into our constraint equations, we have:
&lt;math&gt;
\sum_j {e^{ - \lambda _i  - \lambda _j  - \beta C_{ij} } }  = 0
\sum_i {e^{ - \lambda _i  - \lambda _j  - \beta C_{ij} } }  = 0
&lt;/math&gt;

and, taking the constant multiples outside of the summation sign

&lt;math&gt;
e^{ - \lambda _j }  = \frac{{T_i }}
{{\sum_j {e^{ - \lambda _j  - \beta C_{ij} } } }};e^{ - \lambda _i }  = \frac{{T_j }}
{{\sum_i {e^{ - \lambda _i  - \beta C_{ij} } } }}
&lt;/math&gt;


let
&lt;math&gt;
\frac{{e^{ - \lambda _j } }}
{{T_i }} = A_i ;\frac{{e^{ - \lambda _i } }}
{{T_j }} = B_j 
&lt;/math&gt;

		
we have
		
&lt;math&gt;
T_{ij}  = A_i B_j T_i T_j e^{ - \beta C_{ij} } 
&lt;/math&gt;


which says that the most probable distribution of trips has a gravity model form, &lt;math&gt;T_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is proportional to trip origins and destinations.  Ai, Bj, and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; ensure constraints are met.

Turning now to computation, we have a large problem.  First, we do not know the value of ''C'', which earlier on we said had to do with the money available, it was a cost constraint.  Consequently, we have to set &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; to different values and then find the best set of values for &lt;math&gt;A_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B_j&lt;/math&gt;.  We know what &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; means – the greater the value of &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;, the less the cost of average distance traveled.  (Compare &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; in Boltzmann’s Law noted earlier.)  Second, the values of &lt;math&gt;beta_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta_j&lt;/math&gt; depend on each other.  So for each value of &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;, we must use an iterative solution.  There are computer programs to do this.

Wilson’s method has been applied to the Lowry model.

;Bio :I'm a twenty five year old [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics Bioinformatics] student at [http://www.rit.edu Rochester Institute of Technology]. I graduated from [https://www.hvcc.edu/index.php Hudson Valley Community College] in 2005 with an Associates of Science in Biotechnology and enrolled into RIT afterwards. I am currently working on a dual degree, a BS/MS in Bioinformatics and will most likely graduate in 2010 with both degrees. I've expanded into a little bit of game design this spring but I can't share more details until after our release date. I'm a generally cheerful and bubbly girl, not to mention very geeky, whose hobbies include abstract and surreal art, writing, D&amp;D, videogames and programming (yes, I actually like programming, gasp and horror).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
;Project Work :I joined the Wikibooks project in the spring of 2007 when I worked on the [[Proteomics|Proteomics]] wikibook's [[Proteomics/Introduction_to_Proteomics|Introduction Section]] for [[User:Pac8612|Dr. Craig's]] Proteomics class at [http://www.rit.edu Rochester Institute of Technology]. In 2008 I continued my class based involvement by working on the [[Metabolomics|Metabolomics]] wikibook's [[Metabolomics/Introduction_to_Metabolomics/Relationship_to_Traditional_Metabolism|Introduction Section]] as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;During the course of the 2008-2009 school year (starting in fall of 2009) I worked for independent credit with Dr. Craig, [[User:Kdv2754|Khoi Vo]], and [[User:Nxn6364|Nick Norrell]] on the Metabolomics project. We refined content, added articles and pictures and standardized the look and feel of the wikibook. I also added navigation links to all of the pages, allowing a person to easily move from chapter to chapter, page to page from nearly any level in the book. Khoi, Nick and myself also assisted Dr. Craig in running The Metabolomics project in his Biochemistry Metabolism class as Teacher Assistants for Winter quarter. I provided the same formatting template to the Proteomics class in the Spring quarter for the Proteomics wikibook.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm also currently the primary writer for an article (to be submitted to a biochemistry education journal for peer review) on this project. If published we could start a trend of collaborative textbook projects using technology like wiki and making the lives of students and professors a great deal easier (and less expensive).

      <text xml:space="preserve">The ''i2cal'' module provides a very easy to use I2C interface. The I2C bus is the &quot;backbone&quot; of the Khepera III robot, and used to communicate with three microcontrollers:
* ''Main microcontroller'' (infrared sensors, ultrasound sensors, battery)
* ''Left motor controller''
* ''Right motor controller''
To work with the sensors and actuators of the robot, you may want to use the ''khepera3'' module which contains high-level functions and itself uses this module to communicate with the microcontrollers. However, if you develop your own extension boards that you stuck on top of the robot, this module offers you all you need to access these boards via the I2C bus.

== Synopsis ==

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
// Initialize the module
i2cal_init();

// Let's assume that the I2C address of your device is 0x45
i2c_address = 0x45;

// Write the 16-bit value 10000 to register 0x82
i2cal_start();
i2cal_writedata_uint8(0x82);
i2cal_writedata_uint16(10000);
i2cal_write(i2c_address);
i2cal_commit();

// Read a 16-bit followed by two 8-bit values (4 bytes total) from register 0x83
i2cal_start();
i2cal_writedata_uint8(0x83);
i2cal_write(i2c_address);
msg_read = i2cal_read(i2c_address, 4);
i2cal_commit();

first_value = i2cal_readdata_uint16(msg_read, 0);  // read two bytes starting at byte 0
second_value = i2cal_readdata_uint8(msg_read, 2);  // read one byte starting at byte 2
third_value = i2cal_readdata_uint8(msg_read, 3);   // read one byte starting at byte 3
&lt;/source&gt;

== Description ==

After initalization ('''i2cal_init'''), the ''i2cal'' module allows to send transactions on the I2C bus. A transaction consists of a sequence of message exchanges, either from the processor to your board (write), or from your board to the processor (read).

Transactions are started with '''i2cal_start''' and executed with '''i2cal_commit'''. In between these two calls, a series of read and write messages can be added. A write message is added by first writing the data ('''i2cal_writedata_*'''), followed by a call to '''i2cal_write''' with the device address. Read messages are added with '''i2cal_read''' which takes the device address and the number of bytes to read as argument, and returns a pointer to an ''i2c_msg'' structure.

The '''i2cal_commit''' call transfers the messages and returns after all data has been successfully sent and received. The received bytes are available in the ''i2c_msg'' structures, and can be read using the '''i2cal_readdata_*''' functions. Note that all data has to read from these structures before starting a new transaction.

=== Error Handling ===

The '''i2cal_commit''' function returns either -1 to indicate success, or 0 to indicate failure. Failure simply means that the data could not be transferred, and is usually caused by one of the following:
* Error in the firmware of the microcontroller, i.e. the microcontroller does not (or incorrectly) respond to I2C request. 
* Error in the firmware of another microcontroller on the I2C bus, causing it to misbehave (e.g. by pulling SDA or SCL low).
* Wrong electrical connections, e.g. SDA/SCL flipped, one of the signals grounded, ...
Debugging such errors efficiently requires an oscilloscope (or similar test infrastructure), preferably with support for I2C decoding.

If the electrical design and the firmware implementation on the microcontroller are correct, errors are highly unlikely. Therefore, it is usually not worth implementing a sophisticated error handling procedure.

=== Transaction Size Limitations ===

The ''i2cal'' module limits a transaction to 16 messages (read or write messages combined). Furthermore, the total number of bytes sent must not exceed 256, and the total number of bytes read must not exceed 256 neither. In view of the timing issues discussed in the next section, this should be by far enough for all real-world applications. If necessary (e.g. for testing), the numbers can be changed in ''i2cal.c''.

== Timing Issues ==

The I2C bus on the Khepera III robot is running at 100 KHz. Transferring one byte (8 bits + some overhead) over this bus therefore takes about 0.1 ms.

A message consists of an address byte, plus the data to be read or written. As a rule of thumb, the minimum time for a transaction can be calculated as follows:
::&lt;math&gt;t_{min} = (\#\mbox{messages} + \#\mbox{bytes written} + \#\mbox{bytes read}) \cdot 0.1 \mbox{ ms}&lt;/math&gt;

In reality, two other delays add to this time:
* ''Queuing delay'': As the bus can only send one message at the time, the kernel keeps a queue of messages and transactions. Your transaction will have to compete with other processes using the I2C bus. To achieve a low delay for all processes, it is preferred to communicate in small transactions (&lt; 100 bytes at a time).
* ''Processing delay on the microcontroller'': Each transmitted byte has to be acknoledged by the microcontroller, and each received byte had to be prepared by the microcontroller. For the latter, the microcontroller is allowed to buy in up to about 10 ms of time (I2C clock stretch), during which the bus is occupied and your process waiting. To achieve a good bus usage, this should by all means be avoided.

== Synchronization Issues ==

A ''transaction'' here is called so because it is executed as one atomic block. This is very important, as the following piece of code illustrates:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
// Read a 16-bit value from register 0x83 in one transaction -&gt; correct
i2cal_start();
i2cal_writedata_uint8(0x83);
i2cal_write(i2c_address);
msg_read = i2cal_read(i2c_address, 2);
i2cal_commit();

// Read a 16-bit value from register 0x83 in two transactions -&gt; wrong
i2cal_start();
i2cal_writedata_uint8(0x83);
i2cal_write(i2c_address);
i2cal_commit();
    // &lt;-- Another process may communicate with the same device here, overwriting your 0x83 request
i2cal_start();
msg_read = i2cal_read(i2c_address, 2);
i2cal_commit();
&lt;/source&gt;

If only one process is communicating with that device at any given time, both code snippets are equivalent. However, if more than one process is accessing that device (and you should always think this way), splitting the task in two transactions is wrong.

To understand why, put yourself in the position of the microcontroller (or other I2C slave). You receive register 0x83, and prepare your output buffers for the following read operation. Since the transaction ends there, it is possible that another process communicates with you ''before'' the first process reads its two bytes. This process may send register 0x92, and you are preparing (and possibly serving) your output buffer for this new request. When the first process finally attempts to read its two bytes, the microcontroller will either serve the first two bytes of the 0x92 request, or serve some error code to indicate that the result of 0x92 has been read already.

As a rule of thumb, each self-contained operation (such as register read, or register write) must be performed as exactly one transaction.

== Multi-Threaded Programs ==

Since the data structures of this module are allocated statically, it is not safe to call functions which update the same fields from two different threads. To avoid interference between threads, whole blocks between '''i2cal_start''' and '''i2cal_commit''' (inclusive) must be synchronized.

== Comparison with the Linux I2C Interface ==

Linux (and most other Unix systems) offer a fairly simple interface to the I2C bus via file operations on the I2C device file (''/dev/i2c/0''), notably ''ioctl'' calls. If you look the source code of the ''i2cal'' module, you will notice that ''i2cal_commit'' is nothing else but such an ''ioctl'' call on ''/dev/i2c/0'', and that all other functions around mostly prepare the data structures to pass to that call. Nevertheless, the ''i2cal'' module provides an even simpler interface by taking care of all the necessary buffers, and with functions to correctly read and write 2-byte and 4-byte values from these buffers.

== API ==

The following list summarizes the functions of the ''i2cal'' module:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
// Module initialization
int i2cal_init();

// Start a new transaction
void i2cal_start();

// Add general read/write messages

      <text xml:space="preserve">perhaps clarify on these pages that discussion applies to standard Euclidian/othogonal geometry.  Thus, in non-Euclidian(Riemann), points are not connected by  straight lines ....--[[User:Billymac00|Billymac00]] ([[User talk:Billymac00|talk]]) 21:30, 10 March 2008 (UTC)

== Not what I'd call Elementary ==

The following additions to this book are clearly at odds with the book's intent:

|Projective n-space is a mathematical object. It is homeomorphic to the space of all lines through the origin (as if these lines were disjoint). Some properties are:
* Projective 1-space is diffeomorphic to a circle

Do elementary students have any idea what a projective n-space is?  What about diffemorphic?  I don't think so! --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 12:44, 6 October 2008 (UTC)

==Axiom: there is only a single straight line between two points==

People have a gut feeling for what a straight line is, and '''ANY''' line drawn on the surface of a sphere is NOT straight by any normal definition. If you start redefining straight to be &quot;shortest distance by pulling some cotton taut between the the two points then only one of the two &quot;curves&quot; in the section is straight. IMO this section is very poor at achieving its objective and needs a complete rewrite for elemntary readers. -- [[Special:Contributions/212.24.70.122|212.24.70.122]] ([[User talk:212.24.70.122|talk]]) 14:32, 3 March 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The ''khepera3'' module provides access to all sensors and actuators of the robot and it divided into the following parts:
* '''General''': firmware version and timestamp
* '''Motor''': left and right motor (accessed individually)
* '''Drive''': drive system (both motors) 
* '''Infrared''': infrared sensors, in ''ambient'' or ''proximity'' mode
* '''Ultrasound''': ultrasound sensors
* '''Battery''': battery voltage, current and charge level

Even though each part is implemented in a separate file, it is sufficient to include ''khepera3.h'', which includes all other files.

== Synopsis ==

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
// Initialize the module
khepera3_init();

// Move the left motor to a specific encoder position
khepera3_motor_stop(&amp;khepera3.motor_left);
khepera3_motor_set_current_position(&amp;khepera3.motor_left, 0);
khepera3_motor_start(&amp;khepera3.motor_left);
khepera3_motor_goto_position(&amp;khepera3.motor_left, 10000);
while (1) {
	khepera3_motor_get_current_speed(&amp;khepera3.motor_left);
	... = khepera3.motor_left.current_speed;
}

// Set the speed of the robot by setting the speed of both wheels
khepera3_drive_start();
khepera3_drive_set_speed(5000, 5000);

// Set the speed in a differential manner (speed, forward coefficient, turn coefficient, turn coefficient maximum)
khepera3_drive_set_speed_differential(5000., 1., 0.2, 1.);

// Read infrared sensor values
khepera3_infrared_proximity();
int value = khepera3.infrared_proximity.sensor[cKhepera3SensorsInfrared_FrontLeft];
for (i = cKhepera3SensorsInfrared_Begin; i &lt; cKhepera3SensorsInfrared_End; i++) {
	weighted_sum += khepera3.infrared_proximity.sensor[i] * weight[i];
}

// Enable and read ultrasound values
khepera3_ultrasound_enable(cKhepera3SensorsUltrasoundBit_Front);
khepera3_ultrasound(cKhepera3SensorsUltrasound_Front);
for (i = 0; i &lt; khepera3.ultrasound.sensor[cKhepera3SensorsUltrasound_Front].echos_count; i++) {
	... = khepera3.ultrasound.sensor[cKhepera3SensorsUltrasound_Front].distance[i];
	... = khepera3.ultrasound.sensor[cKhepera3SensorsUltrasound_Front].amplitude[i];
}

// Read battery voltage
khepera3_battery_voltage();
float voltage_V = (float)khepera3.battery.voltage * 0.0001;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Description ==

The ''khepera3'' module is build around a statically allocated data structure called ''khepera3''. This structure is hierarchically organized and contains fields for all sensors and actuators. A few fields are set at module initialization ('''khepera3_init'''), but most fields are updated by the sensor functions provided by this module.

To get a measurement for any sensor, first call the appropriate sensor function (e.g. '''khepera3_infrared_proximity'''). When this function returns, the corresponding fields in the ''khepera3'' data structure will contain the new values. Some sensors also return a timestamp, which is a 32bit-counter incremented at regular time intervals. The interval is not precisely defined, and the counter overflows (i.e. restarts at 0 after having reached 2^32-1). Nevertheless, the timestamp is sometimes useful to find out at what regularity measurements are taken.

For actuator functions (e.g. '''khepera3_drive_set_speed'''), on the other hand, the values are directly passed as arguments to the function call, and not through the ''khepera3'' structure. Note that for all drive functions, the left motor value is specified before the right motor.

=== Error Handling ===

All functions return either -1 to indicate success, or 0 to indicate failure. Failure usually means that the data could not be tranferred over the I2C bus to the microcontroller in charge of the corresponding sensor or actuator. Such errors may occasionally appear, and most often require to cold reboot (switch off, wait a few seconds, then switch on again) the robot.

Therefore, it is not worth implementing sophisticated error handling procedures - either let the program crash (or not work properly) in such cases, or quit cleanly upon failure.

== Multi-Threaded Programs ==

Since the ''khepera3'' structure is allocated statically, it is not safe to call functions which update the same fields from two different threads. I.e. calling '''khepera3_infrared_proximity()''' results in a race condition. The same also applies to the underlying ''i2cal'' module, which makes use of statically allocated structures as well. Thread safety interferes with programming simplicity here, which would suffer if these structures were not allocated statically.

== API ==

Since the function and variable names are self-explanatory, we do not provide a huge documentation here, but instead list functions, constants and structures of each module part. For a more exhaustive documentation, refer to the '''.h''' files.

| description = Honey bees (or honeybees) are a subset of bees which represent a far smaller fraction of bee diversity than most people suspect; of the approximately 20,000 known species of bees, there are only seven presently-recognized species with a total of 44 subspecies (Engel, 1999; historically, anywhere from six to eleven species have been recognized). These bees are the only living members of the tribe Apini, all in the genus Apis, and all of which produce and store liquified sugar (&quot;honey&quot;) to some degree, and construct colonial nests out of wax secreted by the workers in the colony. Other types of related bee produce and store honey, but only members of the genus Apis are considered true honey bees.

|description =
The Phasmatodea are an order of insects, whose members are variously known as stick insects (in Europe), walking sticks (in the United States of America), ghost insects and leaf insects (generally the family Phyliidae). The ordinal name is derived from the Greek &quot;phasma&quot; meaning an apparition or phantom, and refers to the resemblance of many species to sticks or leaves. Some species (e.g. Anisomorpha) are capable of secreting a substance from glands on the metathorax that can cause an intense burning irritation of the eyes (and in some cases temporary blindness) and mouth of potential predators on contact.

|description =
Cockroaches (or simply &quot;roaches&quot;) are insects of the order Blattodea. This name derives from the Latin word for &quot;cockroach&quot;, blatta.

Among the most well-known species are the American cockroach, Periplaneta americana, which is about 30 mm (1 inch) long, the German cockroach, Blattella germanica, about 15 mm (1/2 inch) long, the Asian cockroach, Blattella asahinai, also about 15 mm (1/2 inch) in length, and the Oriental cockroach, Blatta orientalis, about 25 mm (3/4 inch). Tropical cockroaches are often much bigger, and extinct cockroach relatives such as the Carboniferous Archimylacris and the Permian Apthoroblattina were several times as large as these. Cockroaches are generally considered pests; however, only about 30 species (less than 1%) infest urban habitats.

|description = Termites mostly feed on dead plant material, generally in the form of wood, leaf litter, soil, or animal dung, and about 10% of the estimated 4,000 species (about 2,600 taxonomically known) are economically significant as pests that can cause serious structural damage to buildings, crops or plantation forests. Termites are major detrivores, particularly in the subtropical and tropical regions, and their recycling of wood and other plant matter is of considerable ecological importance.

As social insects, termites live in colonies that, at maturity, number from several hundred to several million individuals. They are a prime example of decentralised, self-organised systems using swarm intelligence and use this cooperation to exploit food sources and environments that could not be available to any single insect acting alone. A typical colony contains nymphs (semi-mature young), workers, soldiers, and reproductive individuals of both genders, sometimes containing several egg-laying queens.

|description = 
Mantises are notable for their hunting abilities. They are exclusively predatory, and their diet usually consists of living insects, including flies and aphids; larger species have been known to prey on small lizards, frogs, birds, snakes, and even rodents. Most mantises are ambush predators, waiting for prey to stray too near. The mantis then lashes out at remarkable speed. Some ground and bark species, however, pursue their prey rather quickly. Prey are caught and held securely with grasping, spiked forelegs (&quot;raptorial legs&quot;); the first thoracic segment, the prothorax, is commonly elongated and flexibly articulated, allowing for greater range of movement of the front limbs while the remainder of the body remains more or less immobile.

'''Psocoptera''' are an order of insects that are commonly known as '''booklice''', '''barklice''' or '''barkflies'''.
They range in size from 1–10mm in length.

The species known as booklice received their common name because they are commonly found amongst old books — they feed upon the paste used in binding. The barklice are found harmlessly on trees, feeding on algae and lichen.

|description =
Thrips (Order Thysanoptera) are tiny, slender insects with fringed wings (thus the scientific name, from the Greek thysanos (fringe) + pteron (wing)). Other common names for thrips include thunderflies, thunderbugs, storm flies, and corn lice. Thrips species feed on a large variety of sources both plant and animal by puncturing them and sucking up the contents. A large number of thrips species are considered pests, because they feed on plants with commercial value. Some species of thrips feed on other insects or mites and are considered beneficial, while some feed on fungal spores or pollen. So far around 5,000 species have been described. Thrips are generally tiny (1 mm long or less) and are not good flyers, although they can be carried long distances by the wind. In the right conditions, many species can explode in population and swarm everywhere, making them an irritation to humans.

|description =
As lice spend their whole life on the host they have developed adaptations which enable them to maintain close contact with the host. These adaptations are reflected in their size (0.5–8 mm), stout legs, and claws which are adapted to cling tightly to hair, fur and feathers, and that they are wingless and flattened.

Lice feed on skin (epidermal) debris, feather parts, sebaceous secretions and blood. A louse's color varies from pale beige to dark grey; however, if feeding on blood, it may become considerably darker.

A louse egg is commonly called a nit. Lice attach their eggs to their host's hair with specialized saliva which results in a bond that is very difficult to separate without specialized products. Living lice eggs tend to be pale white. Dead lice eggs are orangeish.

|description =
Beetles are a group of insects which have the largest number of species. They are placed in the order Coleoptera, which means &quot;sheathed wing&quot; and contains more described species than in any other order in the animal kingdom, constituting about twenty-five percent of all known life-forms. Forty percent of all described insect species are beetles (about 350,000 species), and new species are frequently discovered. Estimates put the total number of species, described and undescribed, at between 5 and 8 million.

Beetles can be found in almost all habitats, but are not known to occur in the sea or in the polar regions. They interact with their ecosystems in several ways. They often feed on plants and fungi, break down animal and plant debris, and eat other invertebrates. Some species are prey of various animals including birds and mammals. Certain species are agricultural pests, such as the Colorado potato beetle Leptinotarsa decemlineata, the boll weevil Anthonomus grandis, the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum, and the mungbean or cowpea beetle Callosobruchus maculatus, while other species of beetles are important controls of agricultural pests. For example, coccinellidae (&quot;ladybirds&quot; or &quot;ladybugs&quot;) consume aphids, scale insects, thrips, and other plant-sucking insects that damage crops.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Celx Scripting: Observer =

== observer ==

Observer objects are used to access properties specific to a view, such as viewer position, viewer orientation, frame of reference, and tracking status. The viewer position and orientation can be manipulated with goto commands or by setting properties directly.

Within a CELX script, the observer methods can be used on an observer object, by separating the observer object from the observer method with a semicolon.

The following methods can be used to obtain an observer object:
* Using the [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx celestia#getobserver|celestia:getobserver()]] method regarding the active view.
* Using the [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx celestia#getobservers|celestia:getobservers()]] method in case of a Multiview, which results in a list of observer objects for each view.

'''Notes:'''
# As views (and thus observers) can be created and destroyed by the user, observer-objects in Lua can become invalid. Accessing an invalid observer object will result in an error.
# To ease handling of observer-objects, you can compare them with other observer-objects using &quot;==&quot;, which is not reliably possible with other celx objects.

== Methods ==
This chapter contains a list of all available observer methods, which can be used on &quot;observer&quot; objects. 

=== goto ===

{{Celx:func|observer:goto}}({{Celx:arg|object/position:target [, number:duration, number:start_interpolation, number:end_interpolation]}})

Goto an object or position, similar to pressing the ['''G'''] key on the keyboard.

{{Celx:argdesc|

'''Notes:'''
# This command returns immediately, so you probably want to '''wait'''(''number:duration'') seconds, before continuing the script.
# When an &quot;object&quot; object is specified to goto, the final orientation will be towards the &quot;object&quot; object.
# When a position object is specified to goto, the final orientation will be the same as the initial orienation.
# Going to the position returned by [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx object#getposition|object:getposition()]] method is not the same as going to the object. This because the returned position refers to the center of the object, so you will goto the center of that object.
# The given position is expected to be relative to the universal frame-of-reference. So depending on the used frame of reference, you have to convert the position first to &quot;Universal&quot; before using it in the goto. 
# Position components (X,Y,Z) in Celestia are stored in millionths of a light year. So when you have your own positions defined in km or miles, you have to convert these positions. Therefore, you can use a constant, which must be initialized first within your script:
#* From km to millionths of a light year, use a constant uly_to_km = 9460730.4725808.
#* From miles to millionths of a light year, use a constant uly_to_mls = 5912956.5453630.
# Next you can convert km or miles to millionths of a light year as follows: 
#* millionths_of_a_light_year = ''number:km'' / uly_to_km 
#* millionths_of_a_light_year = ''number:miles'' / uly_to_mls

{{Celx:v132}} {{Celx:func|observer:goto}}({{Celx:arg|table:parameters}})

Go from an initial position with an initial orientation to a final position with a final orientatien.

Using this method, many different types of gotos can be performed.

{{Celx:argdesc|
;parameters: The parameters for the goto must be given in a table. Valid table keys are:
:* '''duration'''&lt;br&gt;Number of seconds the goto should take. Default is 5 seconds.

:* '''to'''&lt;br&gt;Final target position where the goto ends. Must be a &quot;position&quot; object.
:* '''initialOrientation'''&lt;br&gt;Initial source orientation of the observer. Must be a &quot;rotation&quot; object.
:* '''finalOrientation'''&lt;br&gt;Final target orientation of the observer. Must be a &quot;rotation&quot; object.
:* '''startInterpolation'''&lt;br&gt;The point in time during the goto (expressed as a percent number between 0 and 1), at which the observer should &lt;u&gt;begin&lt;/u&gt; turning from the initial orientation to the final orientation. Default is 0.25.
:* '''endInterpolation'''&lt;br&gt;The point in time during the goto (expressed as a percent number between 0 and 1) at which the observer should &lt;u&gt;finish&lt;/u&gt; turning from the initial orienation to the final orientation. Default is 0.75.
:* '''accelTime'''&lt;br&gt;Indicates (as a percentage number between 0 and 1) how much of the time during the goto should be spent accelerating away from the initial position. It also represents the amount of time that will be spent decelerating towards the final position. The remainder of the time during the goto is spend cruising. Default is 0.25, minimum is 0.01 and maximum is 0.5.

#* radians = math.rad( ''number:degrees'' ) = ( ''number:degrees'' / 180 * math.pi) = ( ''number:degrees'' / 180 * 3.14159265).
#* degrees = math.deg( ''number:radians'' ) = ( ''number:radians '' * 180 / math.pi) = ( ''number:radians '' * 180 / 3.14159265).

'''Notes:'''
# If you have an original object somewhere on your screen and then you center a new object, using the [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx observer#center|observer:center()]] method, you might or might not lose sight of your original object, as the observer rotates to center the new object.

# When the object used as the reference in the current frame is still centered on the screen, using this method may cause the target object to (fully or partially) disappear behind the reference object.
# If the object used as the reference in the current frame is the same as the target object, but NOT centered on the screen, the result of this method will just be an orbit around the object for duration seconds, where the observer orientation stays the same with respect to the object.
# If the target object is already centered on the screen, nothing will happen when using this method.
# If the current frame of reference is “universal”, nothing will happen when using this method.

{{Celx:argdesc|
;target: The object to be synchronize with. Must be an &quot;object&quot; object.

'''Notes:'''
# The observer remains in a stationary, or geosynchronous orbit above the reference object. As the object rotates on its axis, the observer will remain the same distance, longitude and latitude above the object, as if it were attached to the object.
# The origin of the Celestia Coordinate System is the center of the reference object.
# In the Geographic Coordinate System, the axes rotate with the selected object. The Y axis is the axis of rotation, counter-clockwise, so it points north for prograde rotators (like Earth), and south for retrograde rotators (like Venus). The X axis points from the center of the object to the intersection of its zero longitude meridian and equator. The Z axis (at a right angle to the XY plane) completes the right-handed coordinate system.

{{Celx:func|observer:chase}}({{Celx:arg|object:target}})

Activate chase-mode on target object.

Chase-mode is the same as setting the frame of reference to &quot;chase&quot; with target as reference object.

{{Celx:argdesc|
;target: The object to chase. Must be an &quot;object&quot; object.
}}

'''Notes:'''
# In Chase mode, the position of the observer remains fixed relative to the target's direction of motion and the observers orientation keeps constant with respect to the direction in which an object is moving. 
# The origin of the Celestia Coordinate System is the center of the reference object.
# This Coordinate System is similar to &quot;lock&quot;, except that the Z axis points in the direction of motion relative to the target object's parent body (the Sun for planets, a planet for moons).

'''Example:'''&lt;br&gt;Select the Moon, activate chase-mode and then go to the Moon.

=== lock ===

{{Celx:func|observer:lock}}({{Celx:arg|object:target}})

Activate lock-mode on the axis from the current reference object to the target object.

Lock-mode is the same as setting the frame of reference to &quot;lock&quot; with target as target-object and the current reference object.

{{Celx:argdesc|
;target: The object to be locked with the current reference object. Must be an &quot;object&quot; object.
}}

'''Notes:'''
# In Lock mode, the position of the observer remains fixed relative to the line between the reference object and the target object. As the target object moves around the reference object (relatively speaking) so does the observer. The distance from the observer to the reference object remains the same, where the distance from the observer to the target object may vary.
# The origin of the Celestia Coordinate System is the center of the reference object.
# The Z axis points from the reference object to the target object. The Y axis lies in the plane defined by the Z axis and the rotation axis of the reference object, at a right angle to the Z axis. The X axis completes the right-handed coordinate system.
# Just selecting an object previously to activating the lock-mode, doesn't make that object the reference object. To make an object the reference object, use the [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx observer#follow|observer:follow()]] or [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx observer#synchronous|observer:synchronous()]] or [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx observer#chase|observer:chase()]] method first, before activating lock-mode.
# If the reference object is the same as the target object, within a Solar System the central star will be set as the reference object instead.
# If the central star in a Solar System is the reference object as well as the target object, using this '''observer:lock()''' method will not have any effect.
# If the &quot;universal&quot; frame of reference is active prior to using this '''observer:lock()''' method (so no reference object is available), using this method will not have any effect.

'''Example:'''&lt;br&gt;Maintain position with respect to the Earth and keep the line between the Moon and the Earth fixed in the view. (Mind that the position with respect to the Moon will vary, because of the eccentricity of the Moon's orbit).

'''Notes:'''
# This method sets the new observer orientation immediately. To more simulate the CEL: ROTATE command and let the observer rotate during a period of time, the rotation angle can be split up in more smaller rotation angles, which are quickly processed after each other, by using this '''observer:rotate()''' method in a Lua &quot;'''for'''&quot; or &quot;'''while'''&quot; control structure (''see next notes'').
# When using this '''observer:rotate()''' method in a Lua &quot;'''for'''&quot; control structure (''see example-1''), the rotation period will take a fraction longer than ''number:duration'' seconds (depending on the speed of your computer), but the total rotation angle along the specified axis will be exactly correct. This because the commands in the generated loop also take some additional computer time to execute. In case of a slower computer, you can decrease the number of steps per second, but that can also mean the scene becomes more jerkier.
# It is also possible to use this '''observer:rotate()''' method in a Lua &quot;'''while'''&quot; control structure, (''see example-2''). In that case the rotation period can be set exactly to the ''number:duration'' seconds, but the total rotation angle along the specified axis will NOT be exactly correct. Again depending on the speed of your computer, you'll have to make a guess about the step-angle or wait-time for each sequence in the &quot;'''while'''&quot; control structure, to end up as close to the total target rotation angle as possible.

'''Example-1:'''&lt;br&gt;Select, follow and center Earth, then rotate the observer during &lt;u&gt;'''about'''&lt;/u&gt; 5 seconds over &lt;u&gt;'''exactly'''&lt;/u&gt; 90 degrees to the right, along the Z axis of Earth.

'''Notes:'''
# This method differs from the [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx celestia#gettime|celestia:gettime()]] method, because in case of a Multiview scene the simulation time can differ between the available observers. This method returns the time for the observer of the active view. For more information about the synchronizing time between the different views (observers), check the {{Celx:v161}} [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx celestia#synchronizetime|celestia:synchronizetime()]] and {{Celx:v161}} [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx celestia#istimesynchronized|celestia:istimesynchronized()]] methods.
# The TDB time scale is a bit different from the more familiar UTC. By using TDB, Celestia places objects much more accurately. As of January 1, 2008, the difference between the two is about 65 seconds. For more information, see [[Celestia/Time_Scales]].
# To convert between UTC and TDB times, you can use the {{Celx:v150}} [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx celestia#utctotdb|celestia:utctotdb()]] and {{Celx:v150}} [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx celestia#tdbtoutc|celestia:tdbtoutc()]] methods.

'''Notes:'''
# This method sets the new observer position and orientation immediately. To more simulate the CEL: ORBIT command and let the observer orbit during a period of time, the rotation angle can be split up in more smaller rotation angles, which are quickly processed after each other, by using this '''observer:orbit()''' method in a Lua &quot;'''for'''&quot; or &quot;'''while'''&quot; control structure (''see next notes'').
# When using this '''observer:orbit()''' method in a Lua &quot;'''for'''&quot; control structure (''see example-1''), the orbit period will take a fraction longer than ''number:duration'' seconds (depending on the speed of your computer), but the total orbit angle around the specified axis will be exactly correct. This because the commands in the generated loop also take some additional computer time to execute. In case of a slower computer, you can decrease the number of steps per second, but that can also mean the scene becomes more jerkier.
# It is also possible to use this '''observer:orbit()''' method in a Lua &quot;'''while'''&quot; control structure, (''see example-2''). In that case the orbit period can be set exactly to the ''number:duration'' seconds, but the total orbit angle around the specified axis will NOT be exactly correct. Again depending on the speed of your computer, you'll have to make a guess about the step-angle or wait-time for each sequence in the &quot;'''while'''&quot; control structure, to end up as close to the total target orbit angle as possible.
# In case of the universal frame of reference, where no reference object is present, using this '''observer:orbit()''' method will not result in an observer orbit, even if an object is selected! 

'''Example-1:'''&lt;br&gt;Select, follow and center Earth, then orbit the observer during &lt;u&gt;'''about'''&lt;/u&gt; 10 seconds over &lt;u&gt;'''exactly'''&lt;/u&gt; 360 degrees, along the Y axis of Earth.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want to create a simple &quot;rules editor&quot; that allows non-programmers to maintain simple business rules for an application.

== Method ==
Business rules are expressed as a set of conditional statements.  Each conditional statement has two parts: a condition and an action.  For example, the following is a simple business rule that can check the validity of a date:

&lt;pre&gt;
IF (TransactionDate &gt; currentDate())
THEN ERROR, MESSAGE=&quot;Transaction date must be in the past&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

The if portion of the rule tests to see if the transaction date is larger then the current date.  If it is, then the date is not in the past. The submission of the form data is rejected, and a useful error message is returned to the user.

One of the best examples of a simple rule editor is an email rules editor. This is usually set up as a template such as the following:

[http://www.freedos.org/ FreeDOS] is a great way to bring all of those old, much-loved and hard to replace programs from the DOS world back to life under a modern operating system. Using FreeDOS, graphical programs that won't run under Microsoft Windows, [[w:Wine (software)|Wine]] or [[w:DOSBox|DOSBox]] might just run flawlessly under QEMU.

Download one of the bootable CD images from the [http://www.freedos.org/freedos/files/ FreeDOS website]. The base CD is fine for running most old DOS software, but the full CD has lots of other goodies on it if you want to experiment further with FreeDOS.

==Creating an image==

To make it possible to exchange files with FreeDOS by copying files to and from the image, don't create the image as ''qcow''. Instead, just create ''raw'' images. This will allow the FreeDOS image to be [[../Images#Mounting an image on the host|mounted]] under Linux and other Unix-like hosts just like a regular hard drive. Create a 100 MiB hard disk image named &lt;code&gt;freedos.img&lt;/code&gt;:

 qemu-img create -f raw freedos.img 100M

Now boot up FreeDOS from the CD image (&lt;code&gt;fdbasecd.iso&lt;/code&gt;) and follow the menus to partition, format and install onto the hard drive.

 qemu -localtime freedos.img -cdrom fdbasecd.iso -boot d

Once the install is complete, you can boot FreeDOS from the image file without the CD.

 qemu -localtime freedos.img

To transfer files between FreeDOS and the host, stop QEMU and mount the FreeDOS image under the filesystem.

 mkdir -p /mnt/freedos
 mount -t msdos -o loop,offset=32256 freedos.img /mnt/freedos
 cp oldgames /mnt/freedos
 umount /mnt/freedos

NB: never mount the image while QEMU is using it and remember to unmount it before starting QEMU again!
