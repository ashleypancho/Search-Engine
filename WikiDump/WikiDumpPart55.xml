** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Yes, I realize this leaves out the:
 chmod 744 X.py &amp;&amp; ./X.py
method of running programs in *nix/OS X, but in the interest of simplicity and platform independence (as this doesn't run on Windows), I'm leaving it out.

If it's required, it can be added as a subsection as &quot;Another method of executing programs&quot; or something.</text>

# Pick over beans, then add cold water.
# Soak overnight, or 6 hours minimum.
# Drain and rinse.
# Simmer until tender.

==Tips, Notes, and Variations==

* As beans are a natural product, pick over beans, discarding any stones, dirt particles, or discolored beans before soaking or cooking.
* If you have hard water in your area, adding ⅛ teaspoon baking soda will reduce the cooking time.
* Make sure water covers beans by at least 2 [[Cookbook:Inch|inches]] (5 [[Cookbook:Centimetre (cm)|centimeters]]), check on water level every little while and don't let the top beans get above the water.

''This is a wonderful dish that is very easy to do. It does call for the use of raw eggs, which is not to everyone's taste, but to the best of my knowledge, no one has died from Carbonara sauce poisoning. However, pregnant women should not eat raw eggs as salmonella can cause spontaneous miscarriage.''

{{see also|Cookbook:Spaghetti alla Carbonara}}

==Ingredients==

* 4 free-range [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]] with large yolks (double yolkers are particularly suitable!) The use of &quot;cheap&quot; eggs will have a marked effect on the sauce. Yolks as fresh and as yellow as possible please!
* 3oz [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Italy|Italian]] [[Cookbook:Pancetta|pancetta]]. PLEASE don't buy the ready cubed stuff, but the fresh, Italian version, with a little cracked pepper on the rind. If you really can't find it, smoked bacon will do.
* 1 sprig of fresh [[Cookbook:Thyme|thyme]], finely chopped.
* 1/4 small onion, chopped finely. 
* The chopped [[Cookbook:Zest|zest]] of ½ a [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]].
* [[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]] and [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]] to taste.

==Procedure==

# Put on the desired quantity of Pasta to cook. This complete dish is often referred to as &quot;Spaghetti Carbonara&quot; but using small Penne Rigate is, in my humble opinion, better.
# Split the eggs carefully and separate the yolks from the whites (a good - and rather sensuous - way of doing this is to run the egg through the almost closed fingers of your upturned palm, so as the white runs away through the fingers, and the yolk remains in your hand!) Keep the yolks in a large bowl (and use the whites for something useful, like [[Cookbook:Meringue|meringues]], if you must!) remembering to pick out that pesky little white bit which always remains behind when you split an egg.
# Fry the pancetta on a lowish heat in a dry frying pan until it is crispy. Always make sure you have more than enough for your sauce, as the temptation to snaffle a few bits of the pancetta whilst it is cooking is irresistible ! 
# When the pancetta is cooked, allow it to cool for a few minutes, before adding it to the yolks (allowing it to cool precludes you scrambling the eggs in the process of adding the piping hot fried pancetta)
# Add a pinch of rock-salt and a very generous amount indeed of ground pepper to the bowl.
# Add the lemon zest and the chopped thyme. Also add a small amount of the Parmigiano cheese to the bowl.
# Once the pasta is cooked, the '''MOST''' important thing is to get your guests to sit down at the table ...!! This dish waits for NO man, woman or child !! It '''HAS''' to be served as soon as it is ready. No ifs or buts here !
# Drain the pasta through a [[Cookbook:Colander|colander]], count to 10, which seems to allow the pasta to cool just a tad, so again it does not scramble the sauce, and add it to the carbonara mixture.
# Mix it through with a wooden spoon and serve immediately, sprinkling the remaining Parmigiano cheese over the top!!

''If you want to add a little chopped flat leaf parsley (not the curly stuff) to add colour go ahead.''

Served with a simple green salad, it's delicious.

Buon Appetito, Wikibookies

&lt;big&gt;'''Randomized evidence for breast cancer'''&lt;/big&gt; 
(in progress)


==DCIS==
===Surgery +/- RT===
*'''NSABP B-17'''
**Randomized. 818 women with DCIS, SM-. Treated with lumpectomy or lumpectomy + RT 50Gy (no boost)
**'''2001''' PMID 11498833 -- &quot;Prevention of invasive breast cancer in women with ductal carcinoma in situ: an update of the national surgical adjuvant breast and bowel project experience.&quot; (Fisher B, Semin Oncol. 2001 Aug;28(4):400-18.) Update on B-17 and B-24. F/U 12 years
***10-year IBTR: 30.8% vs. 14.9% (51% reduction);Invasive 16.4% to 7.1% (57% reduction)
***No difference in distant recurrence or contralateral breast cancers.
*'''UKCCCR''' (1990-1998)
**Randomized. 1701 women with DCIS. 2x2 factorial: BCS followed by 1) observation, 2) RT alone, 3) tamoxifen alone, or 4) RT + Tamoxifen. RT to 50 Gy, TAM 20mg qd x5 years
**'''2003''' PMID 12867108 -- &quot;Radiotherapy and tamoxifen in women with completely excised ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast in the UK, Australia, and New Zealand: randomised controlled trial.&quot; (Houghton J, Lancet. 2003 Jul 12;362(9378):95-102.). Mean F/U 4.4 years
***Tamoxifen: no impact on invasive IBTR, benefit for DCIS IBTR (HR 0.68)
***RT: benefit for invasive IBTR (HR 0.45), and benefit for DCIS IBTR (HR 0.36). New breast events reduced 16% to 7% (SS)
***No synergy between tamoxifen and RT

*'''Swedish DCIS Trial''' (1987-1999) -- RT vs No RT
**Randomized. 1046 women, DCIS on sector resection, target clinical surgical margin 1 cm but microscopically negative SM not required; clinically N0. Arm 1) RT 50/25 vs Arm 2) no RT
**'''2008''' PMID 18250350 -- &quot;Absolute risk reductions for local recurrence after postoperative radiotherapy after sector resection for ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast.&quot; (Holmberg L, J Clin Oncol. 2008 Mar 10;26(8):1247-52. Epub 2008 Feb 4.)
***Outcome: IBTR RT+ 12.1% vs RT- 27.1% (RR 0.4, SS), invasive recurrence ~50%. No difference in DMFS. Age effect: women &lt;50 RR 0.7, age &gt;50 RR ~0.3. No group defined by stratification variables that had low risk without RT
***Conclusion: RT decreases risk by ~50%, though younger women have low protective effect and older women benefit substantially

*'''EORTC 10853''' (1986-1996)
**Randomized. 1010 women with DCIS. Size &lt;=5cm. SM- (intraop evaluation of margins, re-excision if needed). Lumpectomy alone to lumpectomy + RT 50 Gy
**'''2006''' PMID 16801628 &amp;mdash; &quot;Breast-Conserving Treatment With or Without Radiotherapy in Ductal Carcinoma In Situ: Ten-Year Results of European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Randomized Phase III Trial 10853--A Study by the EORTC Breast Cancer Cooperative Group and EORTC Radiotherapy Group.&quot; (Bijker N, J Clin Oncol. 2006 Jul 20;24(21):3381-7.). Median F/U 10.5 yrs. 
***10-year LR: 26% BCS alone vs 15% BCS+RT (SS), 47% reduction. All subgroups benefited.
***10-year LR: invasive 13% vs. 8% (SS), 42% reduction; DCIS 14% vs. 7% (SS), 48% reduction
***Increased risk for LR: age &lt;40, grade 2 or 3, cribiform or solid growth pattern, doubtful margin, and LE alone. Size not a prognostic factor
***No difference in OS or distant mets

===Surgery + RT +/- Tamoxifen===
*'''NSABP B-24'''
**Randomized, double-blind. N=1804 women with DCIS or LCIS, involved margins included. BCS + RT with or without tamoxifen. RT 50 Gy (no boost), TAM 20mg QD
**'''1999''' PMID 10376613 -- &quot;Tamoxifen in treatment of intraductal breast cancer: National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project B-24 randomised controlled trial.&quot; (Fisher B, Lancet. 1999 Jun 12;353(9169):1993-2000.) Median F/U 6.2 years
***5-year BCA events: 13.4% vs tamoxifen 8.2% (SS), ipsilateral 9.5% vs. 6.0% (SS), contralateral 3.4% vs. 2.0% (SS)
***5-year invasive: 7.2% vs 4.1% (SS), ipsilateral 4.2% vs. 2.1% (SS), 2.3% vs. 1.8% (NS)
***Younger patients are at higher risk.
***Conclusion: Tamoxifen of benefit for further reduction of invasive breast cancer recurrences.  There was no difference in regional or distant metastases.

*'''UKCCCR''' (1990-1998)
**Randomized. 1701 women with DCIS. 2x2 factorial: BCS followed by 1) observation, 2) RT alone, 3) tamoxifen alone, or 4) RT + Tamoxifen. RT to 50 Gy, TAM 20mg qd x5 years
**'''2003''' PMID 12867108 -- &quot;Radiotherapy and tamoxifen in women with completely excised ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast in the UK, Australia, and New Zealand: randomised controlled trial.&quot; (Houghton J, Lancet. 2003 Jul 12;362(9378):95-102.). Mean F/U 4.4 years
***Tamoxifen: no impact on invasive IBTR, benefit for DCIS IBTR (HR 0.68)
***RT: benefit for invasive IBTR (HR 0.45), and benefit for DCIS IBTR (HR 0.36). New breast events reduced 16% to 7% (SS)
***No synergy between tamoxifen and RT
***Note: No benefit of tamoxifen differs from B-24 trial: authors suggest it may be due to differences in the patient population.  In B-24 33.5% of patients were under 50 compared to only 9.5% in the UK/ANZ trial.


==Extent of Surgery==
*'''NSABP B-04''' (1971-1974) -- radical mastectomy vs. total mastectomy + RT vs. total mastectomy alone
**Randomized, 2 separate randomizations. 1665 women.'' For further information, please see page at'' [[Radiation_Oncology/Breast/Early_breast/Axilla#Surgery_vs_Radiotherapy|Axilla]]
***1079 women with clinically LN-: Arm 1) radical mastectomy vs. Arm 2) total mastectomy + RT vs. Arm 3) total mastectomy alone 
***586 women with clinically LN+: Arm 1) radical mastectomy vs. Arm 2) total mastectomy + RT
**'''25-years, 2000''' PMID 12192016 -- &quot;Twenty-five-year follow-up of a randomized trial comparing radical mastectomy, total mastectomy, and total mastectomy followed by irradiation.&quot; (Fisher B, N Engl J Med. 2002 Aug 22;347(8):567-75.)
***No difference in DFS, RFS, DM, or OS
***Conclusion: No advantage to radical mastectomy. Also no survival advantage to removing occult positive nodes at surgery or to RT

*'''Denmark DBCG''' (1951-1957) -- extended radical mastectomy vs. simple mastectomy + RT
**Randomized. 666 consecutive patients with untreated primary breast CA randomized, 425 patients underwent surgery (majority of those excluded were not surgical candidates). Arm 1) extended radical mastectomy (radical mastectomy + dissection of axilla, infraclavicular, supraclavicular, and 2nd-4th intercostal spaces) vs. Arm 2) simple mastectomy + RT. RT given with opposing tangential fields including internal mammary LN + anterior/posterior fields to axilla supraclavicular region. Energy 180 kV - 400 kV, dose 42-45 Gy given in 6 days/week
**'''50-years; 2008''' PMID 18465331 -- &quot;Extended radical mastectomy versus simple mastectomy followed by radiotherapy in primary breast cancer. A fifty-year follow-up to the Copenhagen Breast Cancer randomised study.&quot; (Johansen H, Acta Oncol. 2008;47(4):633-8.)
***Outcome: 5-year OS ERM 1% vs. SM + RT 1% (NS); 30-year OS 11% vs. 9% (NS). 25-year DFS 18% vs. 14% (NS)
***Predictors: Stage I better vs. Stage II-III; premenopausal better vs. postmenopausal. Excess mortality due to breast CA demonstrable up to 20-25 years after primary diagnosis
***Toxicity: lymphedema ERM 12% vs. SM + RT 4%
***Conclusion: Mutilating extended radical mastectomy can be safely substituted by simple mastectomy with radiation; no difference in OS or DFS


==Early Breast Cancer==
===Breast Conservation Surgery +/- RT===
*'''NSABP B-06''' (1976-84) 
**See above for more details. Total mastectomy vs lumpectomy vs lumpectomy + RT. Chemo in N+ melphalan + 5-FU
**20-year LR: No RT 39.2% vs RT 14.3%. No difference in survival
**Node negative subgroup showed survival advantage (unpublished)

*'''Uppsala-Orebro''' (1981-88) 
**381 patients. Stage I (&lt;2cm, N0). &quot;Sector resection&quot; and ALND, +/- RT 54/27 without boost. No systemic therapy
**'''5-years, 1994''' PMID 8158702 -- &quot;Sector resection with or without postoperative radiotherapy for stage I breast cancer: five-year results of a randomized trial. Uppsala-Orebro Breast Cancer Study Group.&quot; (Liljegren G, J Natl Cancer Inst. 1994 May 4;86(9):717-22.)    
***Local recurrence 18% vs 2%. No survival difference.
**'''10-years, 1999''' PMID 10561294 -- &quot;10-Year results after sector resection with or without postoperative radiotherapy for stage I breast cancer: a randomized trial.&quot; (Liljegren G, J Clin Oncol. 1999 Aug;17(8):2326-33.)
***10-year LR: no RT 24% vs. RT 8.5% (SS); no difference in OS at 77%
***Low risk: &gt;55 and no comedo/LCIS - no RT 11% vs. RT 6% (NS)

*'''St. George's''' (1981-1990)
**418 patients treated with wide local excision, adjuvant chemo (tamoxifen if ER+ or CMF if ER-), +/- RT
**'''5-years, 1996''' PMID 8846860 -- &quot;The importance of the resection margin in conservative surgery for breast cancer.&quot; (Renton SC, Eur J Surg Oncol. 1996 Feb;22(1):17-22.)
***Local recurrence: no RT 35% vs. RT 13%. LR strictly related to margin status; if SM+ LR 17% with RT
***Conclusion: RT cannot compensate for inadequate surgery

*'''Ontario''' (1984-89) 
**Randomized. 837 patients, &lt;4cm, LN-. Lumpectomy and axillary dissection +/- RT. RT 40/16 + boost 12.5/5 No systemic therapy

**'''8-years, 1996''' PMID 8931610 -- &quot;Randomized clinical trial of breast irradiation following lumpectomy and axillary dissection for node-negative breast cancer: an update. Ontario Clinical Oncology Group.&quot; (Clark RM, J Natl Cancer Inst. 1996 Nov 20;88(22):1659-64.). Median F/U 7.6 years
***Ipsilateral recurrence: No RT 35% vs. RT 11% (SS). OS: 24% vs. 21% (NS). Bigger tumors on average
***Predictors for relapse: age &lt;50, size &gt;2cm, poor grade

***Recurrence: IBTR (only if lumpectomy) NEO 13% vs. 10% (NS); chest wall both 3% (NS); regional 4% vs. 5% (NS); contralateral 5% vs. 6% (NS)
***Conclusion: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy comparable to adjuvant therapy, and may allow BCS for patients who may not otherwise be candidates


==Recurrent disease==
===Hyperthermia===
*'''International Collaborative Hyperthermia Group''' (1988-1991) -- combined results from 5 PIII trials
**Randomized. ''5 trials merged due to slow accrual, closed early after benefit.'' 306 patients. Advanced primary or recurrent BCA; 50% active disease outside treatment area. Could have had prior RT. Trials: Dutch Hyperthermia Group (DHG), Medical Research Council (MRC BrI and BrR), European Society of Hyperthermic Oncology (ESHO), and Princes Margaret (PMH). Target hyperthermia 43C. RT given in various fractions.
**'''1996''' PMID 8690639 -- &quot;Radiotherapy with or without hyperthermia in the treatment of superficial localized breast cancer: results from five randomized controlled trials. International Collaborative Hyperthermia Group.&quot; (Vernon CC, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1996 Jul 1;35(4):731-44.)
***Outcome: CR RT 41% vs. RT+HT 59% (SS); greatest effect in recurrent lesions in previous RT, where re-irradiation dose was low. 2-year OS ~40% (NS), 74% patients progressed outside HT area during follow-up
***Conclusion: Combined result demonstrated efficacy of hyperthermia as adjunct to RT for treatment of recurrence


==Metastatic breast cancer==
===Palliative RT and Zoledronic Acid===
*'''Turkey''' (2003-2005) -- Zoledronic acid + RT 30/10 vs. Zoledronic acid + RT 15/5
**Randomized. 100 patients, at least one bone metastasis, life expectancy &gt;6 months. Excluded pathologic fractures, prior RT to that area, prior treatment with zoledronic acid, brain mets. Zoledronic acid 4 mg Q28 days, starting day 1 of RT. Used objective measure (MRI, bone scan) and subjective end points (pain, analgesic score, visual analog score)
**'''2009''' PMID 19484483 -- &quot;Zoledronic acid concurrent with either high- or reduced-dose palliative radiotherapy in the management of the breast cancer patients with bone metastases: a phase IV randomized clinical study.&quot; (Atahan L, Support Care Cancer. 2009 May 31. [Epub ahead of print]). Minimum F/U 6 months
***Outcome: No difference in time-to-first skeletal event, rate of first-skeleta-event, time-to-response, rate of response, or duration of response. Higher satisfaction in shorter 15/5 arm
***Conclusion: Concomitant use of zoledronic acid and RT safe

===Erythropoietin===
*'''Canada; 2005''' PMID 16087945 -- &quot;Maintaining normal hemoglobin levels with epoetin alfa in mainly nonanemic patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving first-line chemotherapy: a survival study.&quot; (Leyland-Jones B, J Clin Oncol. 2005 Sep 1;23(25):5960-72. Epub 2005 Aug 8.)
**Randomized. ''Stopped early due to adverse outcomes''. 939 patients. Arm 1) placebo vs. Arm 2) Epo to maintain Hgb 12-14 g/dL, and initiated if Hgb &lt;13 g/dL
**Outcome: 1-year OS placebo 76% vs. Epo 70% (SS); no difference in tumor response
**Conclusion: Epo use to maintain high Hgb was associated with decreased survival</text>

= The film had already started when we arrived =

'''Aim of this lesson:''' Learn about and use the Past Perfect and understand the difference between the tense and Past Simple.  Vocabulary that will be taught is related to cinema.

== Speaking about films ==
''Work with a partner, if you can, and ask/answer these questions.  If you're on your own you should think about these questions and write your answers instead.''

* What's your favourite kind of film?
* What films have you seen this year?
* Who is your favourite male or female actor?
* What's the best film you've ever seen?
* Do you prefer watching films at home or at the cinema?

== Grammar - Past Perfect ==

Past perfect is used in English to indicate that an event occurred before another past event.
[[Image:LowryCentre.jpg|thumb|330px|right|Lowry Centre, Salford Quays, United Kingdom]]

{| {{English/B2/Table|Grammar|Past Perfect||3}}
!
! Form
! Example
|-
| + positive
| subject + had + past participle
| I had just eaten dinner when the phone rang.
|-
| - negative
| subject + hadn't (had not) + past participle
| I hadn't started making dinner when the electricity went off
|-
| ? questions
| had + subject + past participle
| Had you ever worked in a bar before getting this job?
|-
|colspan=&quot;29&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#E7F5DE&quot;|
* It is very unusual to use past perfect on its own.  This tense is almost always used with past simple or another tense as you can see in the examples above.
|-
|colspan=&quot;29&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#E6EBBE&quot;|
* the negative form of the past perfect isn't very common
|-
|colspan=&quot;29&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#E7F5DE&quot;|
* &quot;I had just eaten dinner when the phone rang&quot; - first I ate dinner and then the phone rang.
|}

=== Further examples of past simple and past perfect ===

* How many hours had you slept for when your alarm clock went off this morning?
* My mother was angry because I had crashed her car.
* She didn't realise that she had forgotten her credit card until she got to the cash machine.
* I had only walked 100 metres when it started raining.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What should you read in English?==

By this stage you should be able to understand the main idea and key words of many articles.  You will still have difficulty recognising and using many words but you should not let this prevent you from attempting to read in English.  The following newspapers can be read online.  Newspapers like ''The Guardian'' are considered to be broadsheet newspapers and articles are usually longer and may use more formal vocabulary.  Newspapers like ''The Sun'' are tabloid newspapers and their articles are often shorter, with more pictures but they may use very informal language, idioms and phrasal verbs which may be a challenge for non-native speakers to read.  English varies around the world so you should try to read articles from many different countries

'''Water''' is both added to food as an ingredient and used to transfer heat for cooking.

For both such purposes, the water should be generally drinkable. Water is a common source of disease organisms. [[Cookbook:Boiling|Boiling]] water for about 5 minutes should take care of this problem. Baked goods containing water also need to be kept at a boiling temperature to prevent the spread of disease.

Water-based cooking methods include:

*[[Cookbook:Blanching|blanching]]
*[[Cookbook:Boiling|boiling]]
*[[Cookbook:Poaching|poaching]]
*[[Cookbook:Simmering|simmering]]
*[[Cookbook:Steaming|steaming]]

==Water for fermenting==
When adding water to a [[Cookbook:Fermentation|fermented food]], it is generally best to use water with little or no chlorine. Chlorine is added to water to kill harmful microbes such as bacteria, and as such, can change how well a fermentation progresses, by slowing it down or even by ruining it. 

Commercial [[Cookbook:Yeast|yeast]] ferments like [[Cookbook:Beer|beer]] are not as sensitive to chlorine as yeast / bacteria ferments like sourdough, but often still benefit from chlorine-free water as it also affects the taste of the final product.

Chlorine can be removed from tap water by boiling for a few minutes and leaving to cool. Also, leaving uncovered overnight (e.g. in the refrigerator) will reduce chlorine. However, some water suppliers are now using the more stable chloramine instead, which cannot be boiled out and will remain stable in water for longer periods. Many water filters will remove both chlorine and chloramine.

==Potable==

Potable means &quot;drinking&quot; quality. Making water potable involves several steps.
#Remember, some contaminants cannot be removed except with a reverse osmosis filter, for example, heavy metals, or poisons that, in trace amounts, are still toxic, like dioxin.
#Gross physical contaminants should be removed, by pulling them out, coarse filtration with screens or sand, or settling in a quiet pond.
#Fine physical contaminants (haziness or cloudiness) may be removed by fine filtration, filtering through activated charcoal, or by settling with agents, such as diatomaceous earth.
#Biological purification should be performed on any natural water source on the surface. This may be chemical, with chlorine bleach or iodine (will stain clothing), or boiling for 5 minutes ''at an actively rolling boil.''
#After boiling, the water often tastes flat, and this can usually be remedied by pouring the purified water from pan to pan (they must be ''clean!'') for several minutes to put dissolved air back into the liquid.
#Distillation can often be used to make water potable but volatiles, such as petroleum products will usually distill along with the water. After distillation, the water will taste flat.

[[Image:Pesto being processed.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Pesto in a [[Cookbook:Food Processor|food processor]]]]

'''Pesto''' is a sauce which is added mainly, but by no means exclusively to [[Cookbook:Pasta|pasta]]. Pesto is purely the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Italy|Italian]] version of this delicious sauce, with other names for the same (or similar) sauce from other countries. Another famous national variant to pesto is ''pistou'', which is the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of France|French]] equivalent.

{{see also|Cookbook:Pesto}}

== Ingredients ==

* the best quality [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]] you can find. I believe that Greek olive oil is actually better for this recipe than either French or Italian as it has a stronger taste.
* a packet of either [[Cookbook:Pine Nut|pine nuts]] or [[Cookbook:Walnut|walnuts]] (pine nuts give the pesto a blander flavour, walnuts a more robust flavour)
* at least 2 large plants of fresh [[Cookbook:Basil|basil]]
* 7 [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]] cloves
* freshly grated [[Cookbook:Parmesan Cheese|Parmesan cheese]] (not Pecorino please)

== Procedure ==

# Whatever you may have been told, use a electric [[Cookbook:Blender|blender]] or a liquidiser to make pesto. Faffing about with a [[Cookbook:Mortar and Pestle|pestle and mortar]] is for the birds !!
# Again, whatever you have been told, put a good quantity of olive oil in the blender ''first'' and start it running, otherwise the blades will gum up and you risk burning the basil.
# Drop basil leaves through the top into the olive oil so that they are mulched up by the blades.
# Add some pine nuts (or walnuts) so they are also mulched up.
# When the developing Pesto sticks and becomes too thick, simply add more olive oil until the whole lot starts to mulch again. Continue adding basil leaves, pine nuts (walnuts) and the garlic cloves, always making sure the mixture remains fluid.
# Once you begin to run out of basil leaves and nuts add a handful of Parmesan cheese (though not too much; remember the taste should be predominantly of basil).

The end result should be a wondrous smelling, glutinous mass of green which should be then emptied out of the blender into its own container.

==Notes, tips and variations==
* If you like your pesto a little rough, add a small extra quantity of pine nuts and some grated Parmesan cheese to the finished pesto and mix in well. You're ready to go.
* Fresh pesto can be stirred into pasta (penne in my opinion being the best), added as a topping to crostini, or eaten, with eyes closed and a smile on your face, off a spoon, entirely on its own.
*

== How to Install ==

{{User:Whiteknight/Gadget Instructions 2|remotetalk.js|ie7=yes|ie6=yes|ff2=yes|ff3=yes|safari=yes|chrome=yes}}

=== Accessing the Gadget ===

Once you have installed the necessary javascript and properly configured it (see below), you can access the remote talk gadget by coming to this page or by transcluding this page into another page where you want it to appear (such as your user or user talk page). To do this, add this to the appropriate page:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{User:Whiteknight/Remotetalk Gadget}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

=== How to Configure ===

To configure this gadget to look at the correct pages, you need to create a 2-D array named &quot;Alias&quot; to contain the parameters:

 var Alias = new Array(
   [LANG, PROJECT, USERNAME, LINKNAME],
   [LANG, PROJECT, USERNAME, LINKNAME],
   ...);

The LANG is the 2 or 3 letter language code (such as &quot;en&quot;). PROJECT is the name of the project using all lower-case letters. The URL is created by:

 LANG.PROJECT.org

So if you want to make a link to a page at meta, you would say:

 ['meta', 'wikimedia', ...],

The USERNAME is your username on that project. LINKNAME is the words that you want to appear as the hyperlink. For instance, the following code:
 
 var Alias = new Array(
   ['en', 'wikipedia', 'TimmyWikibookian', 'Me at Wikipedia']
 );
 import_script('User:Whiteknight/remotetalk2.js');

Will produce a link that says &quot;Me At Wikipedia&quot;, and loads the page at en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:TimmyWikibookian&quot;. If you leave one of the fields blank, or if you do not create an Alias array at all, defaults will be provided for you.

;Note:I am working on an easier way to install the gadget. Future versions will hopefully be easier to install.

== About this Gadget ==

This gadget is used to view the talk pages of multiple user accounts on other projects from a single location. It uses IFRAME elements for the page loads, instead of AJAX, so that the server can be remote. You must install the script and properly configure it before use.

== To Do ==

*Figure out why it doesnt work in safari

== Version History ==

*3.01 Fixed for complete compatibility with IE
*3.00 Complete rewrite using new gadgets framework.
*2.00 Major rewrite, integrated into my gadgets framework, allowed default parameters for various fields.
*1.00 First stable version

===1...b6===
Black prepares to fianchetto his queenside bishop. This move is not popular at the professional level because it gives white easy development and a full pawn centre, while black himself will be constrained to the last three ranks of the board for some time. Nonetheless, it has occasionally been dabbled with and black can get good counterplay if white is unwise and overextends his pawns in the centre.

White generally responds to Owen's Defence with 2. d4, preparing to take over the centre.

== flags ==

The current flags (German, Austrian, Swiss) don't make much sense to me because the English translation isn't related to these flags. Moreover, in Switzerland you would always use &quot;ss&quot; instead of &quot;ß&quot;. Moreover, the flags aren't used anywhere else; thus, maybe it's best to get rid of them. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 08:27, 8 June 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Gothic}}
=== What is a case? ===
In the simplest terms, a case is what will determine how a word is used in a sentence. Gothic makes these cases destinctive for each type of stem that is used by using Verb Strength. Cases are not a prominent feature in English unless you go into the forms of questions and personal nouns, so it might be harder for you to understand. We only use one case in speech for the most part, maybe two. In Gothic, we have four basic cases that we will use:
* The '''Nominative Case''', which describes the subject of a sentence. Example: '''The man''' went to the store.
* The '''Genitive Case''', which describes who owns an object. Example: This is '''the man's''' store.
* The '''Dative Case''', which describes the &lt;u&gt;Indirect Object&lt;/u&gt; of a sentence.  Example: The man gave the money '''to the storekeeper'''.
* The '''Accusative Case''', which describes the direct object of a sentence if the verb requires a subject and a direct object in order for the sentence to be logical. Example: The man bought '''blocks'''.

That is all you need to know about cases.</text>

[[This quantum world/Implications and applications/Time independent Schr%C3%B6dinger equation|'''&amp;lt; PREVIOUS''']]
&lt;/div&gt;

==Why energy is quantized==

Limiting ourselves again to one spatial dimension, we write the time independent Schrödinger equation in this form:
:&lt;math&gt;
{d^2\psi(x)\over dx^2}=A(x)\,\psi(x),\qquad A(x)={2m\over\hbar^2}\Big[V(x)-E\Big].
&lt;/math&gt;
Since this equation contains no complex numbers except possibly &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; itself, it has real solutions, and these are the ones in which we are interested. You will notice that if &lt;math&gt;V&gt;E,&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is positive and &lt;math&gt;\psi(x)&lt;/math&gt; has the same sign as its second derivative. This means that the graph of &lt;math&gt;\psi(x)&lt;/math&gt; curves upward above the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; axis and downward below it. Thus it cannot cross the axis. On the other hand, if &lt;math&gt;V&lt;E,&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is negative and &lt;math&gt;\psi(x)&lt;/math&gt; and its second derivative have opposite signs. In this case the graph of &lt;math&gt;\psi(x)&lt;/math&gt; curves downward above the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; axis and upward below it. As a result, the graph of &lt;math&gt;\psi(x)&lt;/math&gt; keeps crossing the axis — it is a wave. Moreover, the larger the difference &lt;math&gt;E-V,&lt;/math&gt; the larger the curvature of the graph; and the larger the curvature, the smaller the wavelength. In particle terms, the higher the kinetic energy, the higher the momentum.

Let us now find the solutions that describe a particle &quot;trapped&quot; in a potential well — a bound state. Consider this potential:

&lt;br&gt;[[image:Potential energy well.svg|480px]]

&lt;br&gt;Observe, to begin with, that at &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_2,&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;E=V,&lt;/math&gt; the slope of &lt;math&gt;\psi(x)&lt;/math&gt; does not change since &lt;math&gt;d^2\psi(x)/dx^2=0&lt;/math&gt; at these points. This tells us  that the probability of finding the particle cannot suddenly drop to zero at these points. It will therefore be possible to find the particle to the left of &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; or to the right of &lt;math&gt;x_2,&lt;/math&gt; where classically it could not be. (A classical particle would oscillates back and forth between these points.)

Next, take into account that the probability distributions defined by &lt;math&gt;\psi(x)&lt;/math&gt; must be normalizable. For the graph of &lt;math&gt;\psi(x)&lt;/math&gt; this means that it must approach the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; axis asymptotically as &lt;math&gt;x\rightarrow\pm\infty.&lt;/math&gt; 

Suppose that we have a normalized solution for a particular value &lt;math&gt;E.&lt;/math&gt; If we increase or decrease the value of &lt;math&gt;E,&lt;/math&gt; the curvature of the graph of &lt;math&gt;\psi(x)&lt;/math&gt; between &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_2&lt;/math&gt; increases or decreases. A small increase or decrease won't give us another solution: &lt;math&gt;\psi(x)&lt;/math&gt; won't vanish asymptotically for both positive and negative &lt;math&gt;x.&lt;/math&gt; To obtain another solution, we must increase &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; by just the right amount to increase or decrease by one the number of wave nodes between the &quot;classical&quot; turning points &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_2&lt;/math&gt; and to make &lt;math&gt;\psi(x)&lt;/math&gt; again vanish asymptotically in both directions.

The bottom line is that the energy of a bound particle — a particle &quot;trapped&quot; in a potential well — is ''quantized'': only certain values &lt;math&gt;E_k&lt;/math&gt; yield solutions &lt;math&gt;\psi_k(x)&lt;/math&gt; of the time-independent Schrödinger equation:

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello, and welcome to Wikibooks! Please feel free to wander around and poke at things... but of course, constructively!

I am one of the editors over at the Muggle's Guide, and I note that you have been playing with the series timeline; and I wonder why you chose to put Riddle's application for the DADA teacher's job as late as you did. I'm not saying it's wrong, mind -- we have no information that I can see that would suggest either way when the application was... but I'm interested in '''why''' you chose the date you did. Would you be so kind as to go to the Discussion tab on the Timeline page and fill in something about your reasoning? Thank you very much...

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Herbrand Theories==
Until now we considered arbitrary interpretations of formulae in
predicate logics. In particular we sometimes used numbers as
interpretation domain and functions, like addition or successor. In
the following, we will concentrate on a special case, the Herbrand
interpretation and we will discuss their relation to the general
case. 
==Definition 11==
Let &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; be a set of clauses. The Herbrand universe &lt;math&gt;U_H&lt;/math&gt;
for &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is given by:
  
*All constants which occur in &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; are in  &lt;math&gt;U_H&lt;/math&gt; (if no   constant appears in &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, we assume a single constant, say &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; to be in &lt;math&gt;U_H&lt;/math&gt;). 
*For every &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-ary function symbol &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; and every &lt;math&gt;t_1, \cdots,t_n \in U_H &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f(t_1, \cdots , t_n)\in U_H&lt;/math&gt;. 

'''Examples:''' Given the clause set  &lt;math&gt;S_1 = \{ P(a),  \lnot P(x) \lor
P(f(x))\}&lt;/math&gt;, we construct the Herbrand universe
&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
 U_H = \{ a, f(a), f(f(a)), f(f(f(a))), \cdots \}
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
For the clause set &lt;math&gt;S_2 = \{ P(x)\lor
Q(x), R(z)\}&lt;/math&gt;  we get the Herbrand universe &lt;math&gt;U_H =\{a\}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Definition 12==
Let &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; be a set of clauses. An interpretation &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I} = (U_\mathcal{I}, A_\mathcal{I})&lt;/math&gt;
is an Herbrand interpretation iff
  
*&lt;math&gt;U_\mathcal{I} = U_H&lt;/math&gt;  
*For every &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-ary function symbol (&lt;math&gt;n\geq 0&lt;/math&gt;) &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t_1,   \cdots, t_n \in U_H&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; f^\mathcal{I} (t_1, \cdots , t_n) =f(t_1,\cdots , t_n) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Note, that there is no restriction on the assignments of relations to
predicate symbols (except, that, of course, they  have  to be
relations over the Herbrand universe &lt;math&gt;U_H&lt;/math&gt;).

In order to discuss the interpretation of predicate symbols, we need
the notion of Herbrand basis.

==Definition 13==

A ground atom or a  ground term is an atom or a
term without an occurrence of a variable.
The Herbrand basis for a set of clauses &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is the set of
ground atoms &lt;math&gt;p(t_1, \ldots, t_n)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-ary predicate
symbol from &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t_1, \ldots, t_n \in U_H&lt;/math&gt;


We will notate the assignments of relations to predicate symbols by
simply giving a set &lt;math&gt;I = \{ m_1, m_2, \cdots , m_n, \cdots \}&lt;/math&gt;, where each
element is a literal with its atom is from the Herbrand basis.

'''Examples:'''

  
*&lt;math&gt;S= \{p(x) \lor q(x), r(f(y))\} &lt;/math&gt; 
*&lt;math&gt;U_H = \{ a, f(a), f(f(a)), \ldots\} &lt;/math&gt; 
*&lt;math&gt;I = \{ p(a), q(a), r(a), p(f(a)), q(f(a)), r(f(a)), \cdots \} &lt;/math&gt;

==Definition 14==
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I} =( U_\mathcal{I}, A_\mathcal{I} )&lt;/math&gt; be an interpretation for a set of clauses &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;; the Herbrand
interpretation &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}^*&lt;/math&gt;  corresponding to &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt; is a Herbrand
interpretation satisfying the following condition:
Let  &lt;math&gt;t_1,\ldots, t_n &lt;/math&gt; be Elements from the Herbrand universe &lt;math&gt;U_H&lt;/math&gt;
for &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. By the interpretation &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt; every &lt;math&gt;t_i&lt;/math&gt; is mapped to a
&lt;math&gt;d_i \in U_\mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;p^\mathcal{I}(d_1, \ldots, d_n) = true (false)&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;p(t_1,
\ldots, t_n) &lt;/math&gt; have to be assigned &lt;math&gt;true (false)&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}^*&lt;/math&gt;.

Let us now state a simple, very obvious  lemma, which will help us,
to focus on Herbrand interpretation in the following.

==Lemma 4==
If &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I} &lt;/math&gt; is a model for a set of clauses, then every corresponding
Herbrand interpretation &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}^*&lt;/math&gt; is a model for &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;

==Theorem 4==
A set of clauses &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is unsatisfiable iff there is no Herbrand
model  for &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Proof:''' If &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is unsatisfiable, there is obviously no Herbrand
model for &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;br&gt;
Assume that  there is no Herbrand model for &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; and that &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is
satisfiable. Then, there is a model &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;  and according to
lemma 4 the corresponding Herbrand
interpretation &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}^*&lt;/math&gt; is a model for &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, which is a
contradiction.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Semantic Trees==
In this section we introduce the concept of semantic trees, which then can
be used to proof completeness of resolution. For this we assume
familiarity with the concepts of trees, binary trees 
and paths in trees.

==Definition 15==
A semantic tree for a set of clauses &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a 
binary tree &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; with root &lt;math&gt;N_0&lt;/math&gt;, such that the edges are label with
literals, built from elements from the Herbrand basis of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, such
that:
  
*If &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is an inner node, its two outgoing edges are label with complementary literals &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lnot A&lt;/math&gt;. 
*Every path  to a node  &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;  in &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; does not contain  complementary literals in &lt;math&gt;I(N)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;I(N)&lt;/math&gt; is the set of   literals which are labels  along the edges of the path.

==Definition 16==

A semantic tree is called complete, if every path contains every atom
from the Herbrand basis either positive or negative. 

'''Example:''' &lt;math&gt;S = \{ p(x), q(f(x))\} &lt;/math&gt; with Herbrand basis
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\{p(a), q(a), p(f(a)), q(f(a)), p(f(f(a))), \ldots\} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Note, that for a semantic tree &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; and a node &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; the set &lt;math&gt;I(N)&lt;/math&gt;
can be seen as an assignment of truth-values to ground atoms, as it
is done in an Herbrand interpretation. Hence we call &lt;math&gt;I(N)&lt;/math&gt; a
partial interpretation. A complete semantic tree corresponds to an
exhaustive &quot;enumeration&quot; of interpretations.

==Definition 17==
*A node &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; of a semantic tree &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is a failure node if &lt;math&gt;I(N)&lt;/math&gt; falsifies some ground instance of a clause in  &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, but &lt;math&gt;I(N')&lt;/math&gt;  does not falsifiy any ground instance of a clause in &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; for every ancestor node &lt;math&gt;N'&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;. 
*A semantic tree &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is called closed if every path contains a failure node. 
*A node &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; of a closed semantic tree is called an inference node, if both immediate descendant nodes are failure nodes. 

'''Example:''' &lt;math&gt;S = \{ p(x), \lnot p(x) \lor q(f(x)), \lnot q(f(a))\} &lt;/math&gt; with
Herbrand basis
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\{
p(a), q(a), p(f(a)), q(f(a)), p(f(f(a))), \ldots\} 
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; be a complete semantic tree, than we call &lt;math&gt;T'&lt;/math&gt; the
corresponding closed tree, if it is obtainable from &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; by cutting
all branches at a failure node.

==Theorem 5 (Herbrand's Theorem - Version 1)==

A set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; of clauses is unsatisfiable, iff for every complete
semantic tree for &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; there is a corresponding finite closed
semantic tree.

'''Proof:''' Assume &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; to be unsatisfiable and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; a complete
semantic tree for &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. For every path &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; we have the set of
labels &lt;math&gt;I_B&lt;/math&gt;, which is an interpretation, because the tree is
complete. Hence, &lt;math&gt;I_B&lt;/math&gt; falsifies a ground instance &lt;math&gt;C'&lt;/math&gt; of a clause
&lt;math&gt;C \in S&lt;/math&gt;, because &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is unsatisfiable. Since there are only
finitely many literals in  &lt;math&gt;C'&lt;/math&gt;, there must be a failure node
&lt;math&gt;N_B&lt;/math&gt; in a finite distance from the root. Since every path has such
a failure node, there is a corresponding closed semantic tree &lt;math&gt;T'&lt;/math&gt;,
which is finite.

For the opposite direction, assume that for every complete semantic
tree &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; there is a finite closed corresponding tree &lt;math&gt;T'&lt;/math&gt;. Then,
every path contains a failure node, and hence, every interpretation
falsifies &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;; hence &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is unsatisfiable.

==Theorem 6 (Herbrand's Theorem - Version 2)==
A set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; of clauses is unsatisfiable, iff there is a finite
unsatisfiable set &lt;math&gt;S'&lt;/math&gt; of ground instances of clauses in &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. 

'''Proof:''' Assume &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; to be unsatisfiable and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; a complete
semantic tree for &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. By Herbrand's theorem, version 1, there is a
finite closed semantic tree &lt;math&gt;T'&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;S'&lt;/math&gt; be the set of
ground instances of clauses, which are falsified at all failure nodes
of &lt;math&gt;T'&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;S'&lt;/math&gt; is finite and is falisified by every interpretation and
hence unsatisfiable.
The opposite direction we show by contraposition:

Note, that this version of Herbrand's theorem can be turned directly
into a proof procedure:
Given a set of clauses &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, for which we want to proof
unsatisfiability.

  
*Generate &lt;math&gt;S_1', \ldots, S_n', \ldots &lt;/math&gt; sets of ground instances of clauses of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. Perform a propositional test for unsatisfiability   on each of them.  
*According to Herbrand's theorem, there is a finite &lt;math&gt;S_N'&lt;/math&gt; which is unsatisfiable, if &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is unsatisfiable.

[[This quantum world/Implications and applications/Why energy is quantized|'''&amp;lt; PREVIOUS''']]
&lt;/div&gt;

==A quantum bouncing ball==
As a specific example, consider the following potential:
:&lt;math&gt;
V(z)=mgz\quad\hbox{if}\quad z&gt;0\quad\hbox{and}\quad V(z)=\infty\quad\hbox{if}\quad z&lt;0.
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is the gravitational acceleration at the floor. For &lt;math&gt;z&lt;0,&lt;/math&gt; the Schrödinger equation as given in the 
[[This quantum world/Implications and applications/Why energy is quantized|previous section]] tells us that &lt;math&gt;d^2\psi(z)/dz^2=\infty&lt;/math&gt; unless &lt;math&gt;\psi(z)=0.&lt;/math&gt; The only sensible solution for negative &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; is therefore &lt;math&gt;\psi(z)=0.&lt;/math&gt; The requirement that  &lt;math&gt;V(z)=\infty&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;z&lt;0&lt;/math&gt; ensures that our perfectly elastic, frictionless quantum bouncer won't be found below the floor.

Since a picture is worth more than a thousand words, we won't solve the time-independent Schrödinger equation for this particular potential but merely plot its first eight solutions:

&lt;br&gt;[[image:Quantum bouncer.png|580px]]

&lt;br&gt;Where would a classical bouncing ball subject to the same potential reverse its direction of motion? Observe the correlation between position and momentum (wavenumber).

All of these states are stationary; the probability of finding the quantum bouncer in any particular interval of the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; axis is independent of time. So how do we get it to move?

Recall that any linear combination of solutions of the Schrödinger equation is another solution. Consider this linear combination of two stationary states:
:&lt;math&gt;
\psi(t,x)=A\,\psi_1(x)\,e^{-i\omega_1t}+B\,\psi_2(x)\,e^{-i\omega_2t}.
&lt;/math&gt;
Assuming that the coefficients &lt;math&gt;A,B&lt;/math&gt; and the wave functions &lt;math&gt;\psi_1(x),\psi_2(x)&lt;/math&gt; are real, we calculate the mean position of a particle associated with &lt;math&gt;\psi(t,x)&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;
\int\!dx\,\psi^*x\psi=\int\!dx\,(A\psi_1e^{i\omega_1t}+B\psi_2e^{i\omega_2t})\,x\,(A\psi_1e^{-i\omega_1t}+B\psi_2e^{-i\omega_2t})&lt;/math&gt;
:::&lt;math&gt;=A^2\int\!dx\,\psi_1^2\,x+B^2\int\!dx\,\psi_2^2\,x+AB(e^{i(\omega_1-\omega_2)t}+e^{i(\omega_2-\omega_1)t})\int\!dx\,\psi_1x\psi_2.
&lt;/math&gt;
The first two integrals are the (time-independent) mean positions of a particle associated with &lt;math&gt;\psi_1(x)\,e^{i\omega_1t}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi_2(x)\,e^{i\omega_2t},&lt;/math&gt; respectively. The last term equals
:&lt;math&gt;
2AB\cos(\Delta\omega\,t)\int\!dx\,\psi_1x\psi_2,
&lt;/math&gt;
and this tells us that the particle's mean position oscillates with frequency &lt;math&gt;\Delta\omega= \omega_2-\omega_1&lt;/math&gt; and amplitude &lt;math&gt;2AB\int\!dx\,\psi_1x\psi_2&lt;/math&gt; about the sum of the first two terms.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Resolution==
In the propositional case we defined the resolution inference rule by
&quot;cutting away&quot; a pair of complementary literals in two clauses which 
are resolved upon. In the first order case however this is not always
sufficient:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
C_1: &amp; p(x) \lor q(x) \\

C_2: &amp; \lnot p(f(x))
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
In these two clauses there are no complementary literals, however,
after substituting the term &lt;math&gt;f(a)&lt;/math&gt; for the variable &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; and
&lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt; we arrive at:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
C_1': &amp; p(f(a)) \lor q(f(a)) \\ 

C_2': &amp; \lnot p(f(a))
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Now we can apply the inference rule from propositional logic and
arrive at the resolvent &lt;math&gt;q(f(a))&lt;/math&gt;.

Another possibility is to substitute &lt;math&gt;f(x')&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; to get
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
C_1'':  p(f(x')) \lor q(f(x')) 
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
and then we can have the resolvent &lt;math&gt;q(f(x'))&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;C_1''&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt;, which is in a certain sense more general then the resolvent derived
previously.

==Definition 18 ==
A substitution &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is a function, which maps variables 
to terms and which is the identical mapping almost everywhere. Hence
it can be represented as 
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\sigma =\{x_1 / t_1, \cdots , x_n / t_n\}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
If &lt;math&gt;t_1, \cdots , t_n&lt;/math&gt; are groundterms, we call &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; a
ground substitution. The empty substitution is
notated by &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; .

==Definition 19 ==
Let &lt;math&gt;\theta = \{ x_1 / t_1, \cdots , x_n / t_n\}&lt;/math&gt; be a substitution and &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; an
expression (i.e. a literal or a term), then &lt;math&gt;E\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the expression, 
obtained from &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; by replacing simultaneously each occurrence of
&lt;math&gt;X_i, 1 \leq i \leq n&lt;/math&gt;  in &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; by the term &lt;math&gt;t_i&lt;/math&gt;. 

Example:&lt;br&gt;
With  &lt;math&gt;\theta = \{ x/a, y/f(b), z/e\}&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;E = p(x, y, z)&lt;/math&gt;, we get &lt;math&gt;E\theta = p(a,f(b),c)&lt;/math&gt;

==Definition 20 ==
Let &lt;math&gt;\sigma = \{ x_1 / t_1, \cdots , x_n / t_n\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \lambda = \{ y_1/s_1,\cdots , y_m/s_m\}&lt;/math&gt; be substitutions. Then the composition of substitutions, denoted by &lt;math&gt; \sigma \circ \lambda &lt;/math&gt;,
is the substitution, which is obtained from &lt;math&gt; \{ x_1 / t_1 \lambda,
\cdots,x_n / t_n \lambda, y_1/s_1,\cdots , y_m/s_m \}&lt;/math&gt; by deleting any element
&lt;math&gt;x_j/t_j \lambda&lt;/math&gt; for which &lt;math&gt; t_j \lambda = x_j&lt;/math&gt; and any element
&lt;math&gt;y_i/s_i&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;y_i \in\{ x_1, \cdots, x_n\}&lt;/math&gt; .
&lt;br&gt;
Example:

==Definition 21 ==
Let &lt;math&gt; \{E_1, \cdots, E_n\}&lt;/math&gt;  be a set of expressions and &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; a
substitution, &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is unifier for  &lt;math&gt; \{E_1, \cdots, E_n\}&lt;/math&gt;
iff 
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;E_1\theta = E_2\theta = \cdots E_n\theta &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;.

A unifier &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is called most general unifier iff for every
unifier &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; there is a substitution &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; \sigma =  \theta \circ \lambda&lt;/math&gt;.

In the following we discuss an algorithm for computing most general
unifiers. For this we assume a set of terms   &lt;math&gt; \{t_1, \cdots,
t_n\}&lt;/math&gt; to be unified. First we transform this into a set of equations
by introducing a new variable not yet occurring in this set, say &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; 
and by defining the set of equations
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;N = \{ y = t_1, \cdots , y = t_n\} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
We will now transform this set such that its unifiers stay invariant,
where a &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is a unifier of a set of &lt;math&gt; \{s_1 = t_1, \cdots , s_n =
t_n\}&lt;/math&gt; if  &lt;math&gt; \{s_1 \sigma = t_1 \sigma , \cdots , s_n\sigma  =
t_n\sigma \}&lt;/math&gt; holds.

{{Box| &lt;center&gt;'''Unification'''&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Given a set of expression. Transform it into a set of equations &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;
as defined above. Apply the following transformation rules as long as
possible: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

#&lt;math&gt;\frac {R \uplus \{t=x\}}{R \uplus \{x=t\}}&lt;/math&gt;  ''Orient'' &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; where &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is a variable and  &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; a non-variable term   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\frac{R \uplus \{s=s\}}{R}&lt;/math&gt; ''Delete'' &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    
# &lt;math&gt;\frac{R \uplus \{f(s_1,\dots, s_n) = f(t_1, \dots, t_n)\}}{R \uplus \{s_1=t_1, \dots, s_n=t_n\}} &lt;/math&gt; ''Decompose ''(Termreduction)   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\frac{R \uplus \{x=t\}}{R[x/t] \uplus \{x=t\}}&lt;/math&gt; ''Eliminate'' (Elimination of variable I)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  if  &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; not in &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, but in &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;
#&lt;math&gt; \frac{R \uplus \{x=y\}}{R[x/y] \uplus \{x=y\}}&lt;/math&gt;''Coalesce'' (Elimination of variable II)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; if &lt;math&gt;x \neq y&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
# &lt;math&gt; \frac{R \uplus \{f(s_1, \dots, s_m) = g(t_1,\dots, t_n)\}}{\mbox{FAIL}}&lt;/math&gt; ''Conflict''&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   if &lt;math&gt;f \neq g&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;m \neq n&lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\frac{R \uplus \{x=t\}}{\mbox{FAIL}}&lt;/math&gt;  ''Occur Check'' &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; if &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt; }}

==Theorem 7==
Let &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; be a set of expressions. The above unification algorithm
terminates. If it returns &lt;math&gt;FAIL&lt;/math&gt;, there is no unifier for &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, otherwise 
&lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;  is transformed into a set of equation  &lt;math&gt;\{y_1 = u_1, \cdots , y_m 
= u_m\}&lt;/math&gt;, which represents the most general unifier for &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;.

==Definition 22==
Let two or more literals of a clause &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; have a unifier &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, then 
&lt;math&gt;C\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is called a factor of &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Example: &lt;br&gt;
With &lt;math&gt; C= \{p(x), p(f(y)), \lnot q(x)\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma = \{ x/f(y)\}&lt;/math&gt; we 
get the factor &lt;math&gt;C\sigma = \{p(f(y)), \lnot q(f(y))\}&lt;/math&gt;

==Definition 23==
Let &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt; be two clauses with no variables in common, such
that &lt;math&gt;L_1 \in C_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;L_2 \in C_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;L_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;L_2&lt;/math&gt; have a most
general unifier &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;. A binary resolvent of &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; and
&lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt; is 
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; (C_1\sigma - L_1\sigma) \cup (C_2 \sigma - L_2\sigma) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Example:
Given  &lt;math&gt;C_1 = \{ p(x), q(x)\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_2 = \{\lnot p(a),r(x)\}&lt;/math&gt;. After
renaming &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;C_2 = \{\lnot p(a), r(y)\}&lt;/math&gt; we get the resolvent 
&lt;math&gt;\{q(a), r(y)\}&lt;/math&gt; by using the most general unifier &lt;math&gt;\{x/a\} &lt;/math&gt;. 


We often depict resolvent graphically, e.g.
&lt;center&gt;
[[Image:resolvent.png]]&lt;/center&gt;

==Definition 24==
A resolvent of two clauses &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt; is one of the
following binary resolvents:
  
*a binary resolvent of &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt; 
*a binary resolvent of &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; and a factor of &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt; 
*a binary resolvent of a factor of &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt; 
*a binary resolvent of a factor of &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; and a factor of  &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;
Example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Given  &lt;math&gt;C_1 = \{ p(x), p(f(y)), r(g(y))\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_2 = \{\lnot
p(f(g(a))),q(b)\}&lt;/math&gt;.

A factor of &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;C_1\prime = \{p(f(y)), r(g(y))\}&lt;/math&gt;.  A binary
resolvent of &lt;math&gt;C_1\prime&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt; and hence also of &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; and
&lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;C_3 = \{ r(g(g(a))), q(b)\} &lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The following lemma is used in the completeness proof of resolution.

==Lemma 5 (Lifting lemma)==
If &lt;math&gt;C_1\prime&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_2\prime&lt;/math&gt; are instances of &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt;,
respectively, and &lt;math&gt;C\prime&lt;/math&gt; is a resolvent  of  &lt;math&gt;C_1\prime&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_2\prime&lt;/math&gt;, 
then there is a resolvent &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; of  &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt; such that
&lt;math&gt;C\prime&lt;/math&gt; is an instance of &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;br&gt;

==Theorem 8==
A set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; of clauses is unsatisfiable iff the empty clause can be
derived from &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; by resolution.
&lt;br&gt;
'''Proof:'''&lt;br&gt;
Assume that &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is unsatisfiable. Let &lt;math&gt;A = \{ A_1,A_2, \ldots\}&lt;/math&gt; be
the ground atom set of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, hence the Herbrand basis. Let &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; be a
complete binary tree, as given in Figure 2. According to Herbrand's theorem
(version1)  there exists a closed finite semantic tree
&lt;math&gt;T'&lt;/math&gt;. There are two cases:
  
*If &lt;math&gt;T'&lt;/math&gt; consists only of one node (hence the root), The interpretation to be collected from the empty branch in this tree falsifies only the empty clause. Hence the empty clause must be in &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. 
*Assume &lt;math&gt;T'&lt;/math&gt; consists of more than one node. Then there must be an inference node &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;T'&lt;/math&gt;, hence both its descendants   &lt;math&gt;N_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;N_2&lt;/math&gt; are failure nodes. If such a node would not exist, every node would have at least one non-failure node, which would mean that there is at least an infinite path in &lt;math&gt;T'&lt;/math&gt;, which   would violate, that fact that it is a finite closed semantic tree.   Let &lt;math&gt;N, N_1, N_2&lt;/math&gt; given as described above; and let &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
  I(N) &amp; =&amp; \{m_1, m_2, \ldots, m_n\} 
   I(N_1) &amp; =&amp; \{m_1, m_2, \ldots, m_n, m_n, m_{n+1}\} 
  I(N_2) &amp;  =&amp;  \{m_1, m_2, \ldots, m_n, m_n, \lnot m_{n+1}\} \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Now, let &lt;math&gt;C_1'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_2'&lt;/math&gt; be ground instances of clauses &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt;, such that  &lt;math&gt;C_1'&lt;/math&gt; is falsified by &lt;math&gt;I(N_1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_2'&lt;/math&gt;  by &lt;math&gt;I(N_2)&lt;/math&gt;, such that both are not falsified by &lt;math&gt;I(N)&lt;/math&gt;.
 Hence we have &lt;math&gt;\lnot m_{n+1} \in C_1'&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt; m_{n+1} \in C_2'&lt;/math&gt; and we can construct the resolvent &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
C' = (C_1' - \{ \lnot m_{n+1}\} ) \cup (C_2' - \{  m_{n+1}\} ) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;C'&lt;/math&gt; must be false in &lt;math&gt;I(N)&lt;/math&gt;, because both &lt;math&gt;(C_1' - \lnot m_{n+1})&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(C_2' -  m_{n+1})&lt;/math&gt; are false in &lt;math&gt;I(N)&lt;/math&gt;. According to the Lifting Lemma 5 there exists a resolvent &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; of  &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;C'&lt;/math&gt; is a ground instance of &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;T \; '' &lt;/math&gt; be the closed semantic tree for &lt;math&gt; S \cup \{ C\} &lt;/math&gt; , obtained from &lt;math&gt;T'&lt;/math&gt; by deleting all nodes below the first node which falsifies &lt;math&gt;C'&lt;/math&gt;. Note, that &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is unsatisfiable if and only if &lt;math&gt;S \cup \{ C\} &lt;/math&gt; is unsatisfiable. Clearly, &lt;math&gt;T \; ''&lt;/math&gt; has less nodes than &lt;math&gt;T'&lt;/math&gt; and we now can iterate this process until only the root of the semantic tree is remaining. This, however is only possible if the empty clause &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt; is derivable. 
For the opposite direction, assume that  &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt; is derivable by
resolution from &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;R_1, \ldots, R_k&lt;/math&gt; the resolvents
constructed during this process. Assume &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is satisfiable and
&lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; to be a model for &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. From the correctness lemma according to
the propositional case we known, that if a model satisfies two
clauses it also satisfies its resolvent. Therefore &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; has to satisfy
&lt;math&gt;R1, \ldots, R_k&lt;/math&gt;; this, however, is impossible, because one of this
resolvents is &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Molarity versus Molality==
*Molarity (M) - moles of solute per liter of solution.
*Molality (m) - moles of solute per kilogram of solvent.

==Solubility Rules==
These will NOT be given to you on the test. You must memorize them.
# Compounds with Group 1 elements are soluble or the ammonium ion are soluble.
# Nitrates, acetates, chlorates, and perchlorates are soluble.
# Chlorides, bromides, and iodides are generally soluble, unless they contain copper, silver, lead, or mercury.
# Sulfates are soluble, unless they contain barium, lead, silver, strontium, or calcium.
# Most silver salts are insoluble unless listed in rule #2.
# Most hydroxide salts are insoluble unless stated in rule #1 or contain calcium, strontium, or barium.
# Most sulfides are insoluble unless stated in rule #1, or contain Group 2 elements.
# Carbonates and phosphates are insoluble unless listed in rule #1.

==Forgot Your Polyatomic Ions?==
*Ammonium - NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
*Nitrate - NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;
*Acetate - CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COO&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;
*Chlorate - ClO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;
*Perchlorate - ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;
*Sulfate - SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;
*Carbonate - CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;
*Phosphate - PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3-&lt;/sup&gt;

==Solubility==
*Solids are more soluble when they are warm, but gases are the opposite.
*Supersaturated solutions will settle if disturbed.

==Colligative Properties==
Colligative properties are properties of solutions that depend on the amount of solute particles present rather than the identity of the particles.
*Vapor pressure lowering
*Freezing point depression and boiling point elevation (molality)
*Osmotic pressure

==Not Solutions==
*Colloids look &quot;milky&quot; when light is passed through them (Tyndall Effect)
*Suspensions settle if left long enough, and also look milky.

      <text xml:space="preserve">*Reactants form products.
*Reactions may be exothermic (releasing heat) or endothermic (absorbing heat).

==Types of Reactions==
*Synthesis: A + B → AB
*Decomposition: AB → A + B
*Single Replacement: AB + C → AC + B.
*Double Replacement: AB + CD → AD + CB.
**Precipitation - when two ionic compounds are dissolved in a solvent, they form four ions. Quite often, the positive ion from one compound will react with the negative ion from the other, forming an insoluble compound. This compound precipitates to the bottom as a solid.
**Neutralization - when an acid and base are mixed, water and a '''salt''' will form.

===Redox Reactions===
These are reactions where the oxidation numbers of particles change. The particle whose oxidation number decreases is '''reduced''', and is called an '''oxidizing agent'''. The other particle is '''oxidized''', and is called a '''reducing agent'''. If oxygen is the ''oxidizing'' agent, the reaction is called combustion.

===Predicting Chemical Reactions===
{{:General Chemistry/Predicting Chemical Reactions}}

==Kinetics==
*Rate constant - constant only for a specific reaction and temperature.
*Order of a reaction - add up all the exponents of the molarities.

==Polyprotic Acids==
Can donate more than one hydrogen ion. (Bronsted-Lowry)

==Titration==
Titration is the combining of a known concentration solution with an unknown concentration solution. The titration is stopped at the '''equivalence point''', where all of the acid or base has been reacted. Polyprotic acids have more than one equivalence point.

==Conjugate Acids and Bases==
Conjugates differ by one hydrogen ion. Strong acids have weak base conjugates, and vice versa.

==Water Dissociation Constant==
K&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; = [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;][OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;] = 10^-14 at 298K.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==About SDL Trados==
SDL TRADOS is CAT translation software, widely used by corporate language departments, language service providers, freelance translators and academic institutions. As other CAT tools, SDL Trados is designed to increase efficiency and quality during translation and localization. Probably the most frequently used components of a CAT tool are:

Translation memory: A linguistic database that records your translations as you work, then displays past translations when the same or similar source material appears again.

Terminology management: Essentially a dictionary that can be referenced on the fly while working

==SDL Trados 2007==
SDL Trados 2007 adds a new component, Synergy, which provides means to keep track of multiple files with the memory and terminology database. 

As with any CAT tool, there are frequent complaints about bugs and failures in this software. User groups are available to seek help to problems, and SDL Trados provides a fee-based support system (also the target of many complaints).

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is the chapter 1 of the Disaster and WMD defence guide and it's subject is Nuclear &amp; Radiation protection.

=Protection from an imminent strike=
The only thing you can do to protect your self from a strike about to occur is either to quickly go to a [[wikipedia: civil protection|CP]] shelter or to go as low underground as you can and stay near a wall to prevent being buried by a possible collapse of your roof etc.

==Protection from a possible attack==
First try to get at least 50km (40mi)

===Aftermath===
After the strike you should get as far away from ground zero as possible or stay in a preserved shelter for as long as possible

=Radiation leak=

      <text xml:space="preserve">You should primaly take shelter in a [[wikipedia:Civil protection|CP]] shelter. If you don't have this option, in case of nuclear leak take cover in an under ground cellar space or in case of a gas leak you should (depending on the gas) take cover in the top floor (don't go to the attic, because attics usually present a lot of &quot;blocking&quot; which will be handled later,

==Radioactivity weakens==
When it goes through material
For example 35cm (14inches) of concrete reduces the radiation levels to 1:50

When the distance to the radiating particles grows,
half of the radiation is received when a person is within 8 meter radius of the source of radiation.

==Preparing your shelter==

* !Radio, TV or a Computer! A radio is the best because it's got a simple broadcasting system which is easier to have back up and running after any type of situation. Stay on government channels to receive more accurate info.
* =Personal protection gear =
* =Important medication and Important documents=
* Eating utilities, Plates, forks etc.
* Matches Don't use unless you absolutely need to because they &quot;eat&quot; oxygen

'''Adrenocortical Carcinoma'''

==Overview==
*Rare tumors
**Incidence 1 per 1,000,000
**Represent 0.2% of all cancers
**Up to 14% of adrenal incidentalomas
*Located in the adrenal cortex
*Produce steroids ~50% cases
*Equal in men:women
*Often associated with [[Handbook_of_Genetic_Counseling/Beckwith-Wiedemann_Syndrome|Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome]]
*May be part of MEN I (hyperparathyroidism, endocrine pancreas tumors, pituitary adenomas, adrenal tumors, neuroendocrine tumors)


*'''UCSF, 2006''' PMID 16680602 -- &quot;Extent of disease at presentation and outcome for adrenocortical carcinoma: have we made progress?&quot; (Kebebew E, World J Surg. 2006 May;30(5):872-8.)
**SEER database review 1973-2000
**Average age 51.2, 46% men, average tumor size 12 cm (only 4% &lt;6cm)
**Treatment: 88% surgical resection, EBRT used in 12%
**Prognostic factors: low tumor grade, low stage, surgical resection
**Conclusion: no change in presentation, diagnosis, stage over time

==Staging==
*Tumor (T)
**T1: Tumor 5 cm or less in size; invasion absent
**T2: Tumor greater than 5 cm in size; invasion absent
**T3: Tumor outside adrenal in fat
**T4: Tumor invading adjacent organs

*Lymph nodes (N)
**N0: No positive lymph nodes
**N1: Positive lymph nodes

*Metastases (M)
** M0: No distant metastases
** M1: Distant metastases

==Treatment==
*Surgical
*Adjuvant mitotane
*Use of RT controversial
*Perez 4th Edition:
**Consider RT: preop in unresectable to downstage, postop with residual disease, postop with high risk features, primary RT for nonsurgical candidates, palliative
**Dose 50-60 Gy to tumor/tumor bed, nodal drainage including contralateral periaortics
**Shielding of contralateral kidney


*'''Italy/Germany, 2007''' (1985-2005) PMID 17554118 -- &quot;Adjuvant Mitotane Treatment for Adrenocortical Carcinoma.&quot; (Terzolo M, N Engl J Med. 2007 Jun 7;356(23):2372-2380.)
**Retrospective. 177 patients at 8 centers in Italy and 47 centers in Germany. Radical surgery. Adjuvant mitotane in 47 Italian patients vs. no further treatment in 55 Italian and 75 German patients. Italian patients similar, German older and more Stage I-II
**Outcome: RFS mitotane 42 months vs. Italian control 10 months vs. German control 25 months
**Conclusion: Adjuvant mitotane may prolong recurrence-free survival
**Editorial: While retrospective, well done, and provides compelling rationale for adjuvant low-dose mitotane

*'''Hahnemann, 1991''' (1962-1990) PMID 1709336 -- &quot;Radiation therapy for adjunctive treatment of adrenal cortical carcinoma.&quot; (Markoe AM, Am J Clin Oncol. 1991 Apr;14(2):170-4.)
**Retrospective. 13 patients treated in 2 hospitals, 6 patients with primary/adjuvant RT
**Conclusion: Postop RT may have improved survival

*'''Christie Hospital, 1987''' (UK) (1968-1981) PMID 3121234 -- &quot;Adrenal cortical carcinoma: survival after radiotherapy.&quot; (Magee BJ, Clin Radiol. 1987 Nov;38(6):587-8.)
**Retrospective. 15 patients, 9 post op RT 
**Outcome: 10-year OS 33%
**Prognostic: age at diagnosis, hormone production, complete resection

*'''Michigan, 2011''' (1989-2008) PMID 20675074 -- &quot;Adjuvant and definitive radiotherapy for adrenocortical carcinoma.&quot; (Sabolch A, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2011 Aug 1;80(5):1477-84.)
**Retrospective. 58 patients, 10 post op RT 
**Outcome: Lack of radiotherapy use was associated with 4.7 times the risk of local failure compared with treatment regimens that involved radiotherapy
**Conclusion: Adjuvant radiotherapy should be strongly considered after surgical resection.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Mediastinum_anatomy.jpg|thumb|right|385px|The heart and lungs and surrounding arteries and veins.]]  The job of the circulatory system is to provide [[Wikijunior:Human_Body/Glossary#oxygen|oxygen]] and [[Wikijunior:Human_Body/Glossary#nutrient|nutrients]] to all the parts of the body. Waste products like [[Wikijunior:Human_Body/Glossary#carbon dioxide|carbon dioxide]] are carried away so they can leave the body. 

__TOC__

==What does the circulatory system look like?==

The heart is about the size of a fist. The blood vessels are long, thin tubes that carry blood. There are thousands of blood vessels. If you stretched them all out, one person's blood vessels would cover over 60,000 miles!

==What are the parts of the circulatory system?==

The [[Wikijunior:Human_Body/Glossary#circulatory|circulatory]] system includes the heart, blood, and blood vessels. Blood vessels are the tubes that carry blood all over the body. 
[[Wikijunior:Human_Body/Glossary#artery|Arteries]], [[Wikijunior:Human_Body/Glossary#vein|veins]], and [[Wikijunior:Human_Body/Glossary#capillary|capillaries ]] are all different kinds of blood vessels.
It also includes the lymphatic system, which comprises a network of conduits called lymphatic vessels that carry a clear fluid called lymph ''unidirectionally'' towards the heart.

==What is the function of the circulatory system?==

The job of the circulatory system is to carry oxygen and nutrients from food to all the parts of the body. Then waste products like carbon dioxide are carried back out. This is all done by the blood which travels through the blood vessels. The job of the heart is to pump the blood all over the body.

The circulatory system is very important. Without it, the rest of the body would die.

==How does the circulatory system interact with other parts of the body?==

All the parts of your body need a supply of blood. This red sticky liquid carries food and oxygen to every part of your body. The heart and its network of blood vessels are called the circulatory system. The artery that carries oxygen rich blood cells away from your heart is called the aorta and the vein that takes it back again is called the vena cava.

Your heart is made of two pumps. The left pump or left ventricle receives blood filled with oxygen from your lungs and sends it around your body. The right pump or right ventricle gets blood from the body and sends it to the lungs to pick up some more oxygen. The inside walls of your heart squeeze regularly to pump the blood around your body. This is called the heart beat.

In your body you have one way valves in your main veins and in your heart. They make your blood flow the right way around your body. If your blood tries to go the other way the valve will snap shut so your blood can’t get through.

Your arteries have thick walls to cope with the high pressure of the blood from your heart. They branch out to make a network of very small blood vessels called capillaries. Many substances can pass through the walls. Not only oxygen passes from blood to nearby cells but carbon dioxide and other waste matter passes into the capillary to be carried away.

Your blood is made up of four things. About half of your blood is made up of plasma, about 40% is made of red blood cells which carry oxygen and a very little bit is made of white blood cells and platelets. Plasma is a pale yellow liquid. It is made up of sugars, salts and other body chemicals. Red blood cells are donut shaped which carries oxygen around the body. The blood gets its red colour from these cells. Hemoglobin I your red blood cells are the red I it. The amount of oxygen in the blood cell determines how red the cell is. White blood cells go around the body looking for germs to eat. They are like jelly filled bags and can change their shape to get out of the blood stream and go into other body parts. Platelets help you clot your blood if you prick yourself or get a bruise. They are made in bone marrow and are round or oval in shape.

In models or diagrams oxygen rich blood is shown red and veins carrying old blood are shown in blue when it is actually a darker red.

==How can you keep your the circulatory system healthy?==

Regular [[Wikijunior:Human_Body/Glossary#exercise|exercise]] and eating healthy food helps keep the heart healthy. Sometimes, the circulatory system has problems like high blood pressure or high [[Wikijunior:Human_Body/Glossary#cholesterol|cholesterol]]. Diet, exercise, and sometimes [[Wikijunior:Human_Body/Glossary#medication|medication]] can help those problems.

      <comment>Labeling the Picture</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">We need a good illustration here (the classic red arteries and blue veins image). I had a hard time finding one that didn't have prominent male anatomy that we should probably avoid in a little kids' book. If anyone can help find something for this, that would be great. [[User:Kfasimpaur|Kfasimpaur]] 01:24, 9 June 2007 (UTC)
:How's that? --[[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:50, 18 June 2007 (UTC)

I'd like to say that thie illustration that is already there is perfect, but someone should 
add labels to the picture. They should say something like: main ateries, red blood cells, heart, and anything else we can think of. Tell me your suggestions!</text>

==CSI RT Dose==
*'''POG 8631/CCG 923''' (1986-1990) -- '''CSI 36 Gy vs. CSI 23.4 Gy'''
**2000, PMID 10944134 -- &quot;Low-stage medulloblastoma: final analysis of trial comparing standard-dose with reduced-dose neuraxis irradiation.&quot; (Thomas PR, J Clin Oncol. 2000 Aug;18(16):3004-11.)
**Randomized. 126 patients, low risk (&gt;3 years, complete resection T1-T2, later also T3a, M0) standard CSI 36(20*1.8) vs. reduced CSI 23.4(13*1.8); both followed by posterior fossa boost to 54(30*1.8) Gy. ''Study closed prematurely due to high relapse in reduced arm''
**5-year EFS: standard CSI 67% vs. reduced CSI 52% (p=0.080)&lt;br&gt;8-year EFS: standard CSI 67% vs. reduced CSI 52% (p=0.141)&lt;br&gt;''These data confirm the original one-sided conclusions but suggest that differences are less marked with time''
**Conclusion: Reduced CSI 23.4 Gy alone is insufficient; may need concurrent chemo

*'''SIOP II''' (1984-1989) -- '''CSI 35 Gy vs. CSI 25 Gy; also +/- adjuvant chemo'''
**1995, PMID 7623725 &quot;Prospective randomised trial of chemotherapy given before radiotherapy in childhood medulloblastoma. International Society of Paediatric Oncology (SIOP) and the (German) Society of Paediatric Oncology (GPO)&quot;  Bailey et al.  Med Pediatr Onc 25(3):166-78, 1995
**Randomized. 364 patients. SIOP I low risk (total/subtotal resection, no brain stem invasion, M0) randomized to +/- adjuvant chemo (vincristine, methotrexate, procarbazine), and then randomized to standard CSI 35 Gy vs. reduced CSI 25 Gy. Boost posterior fossa to 55 Gy. High risk randomized to +/- adjuvant chemo, then standard CSI and additional post-RT chemo 
**Outcome: No advantage to pre-RT chemo. Standard CSI 35 Gy for low risk pts increased EFS (68% vs 55%). Low risk patients with adjuvant chemo and CSI 25 Gy did particularly badly
**Conclusion: No benefit to adjuvant chemo. Standard dose of CSI is 35 Gy

==CSI +/- Chemo==
*'''CCG A9961''' (1996-2000) -- '''CSI 23.4 Gy + CCNU-based vs. cyclophosphamide-based chemo'''
**2006, PMID 16943538 &quot;Phase III study of craniospinal radiation therapy followed by adjuvant chemotherapy for newly diagnosed average-risk medulloblastoma&quot;  Packer et al.  JCO 24(25):4204-8, 2006.
**Randomized. 421 patients, standard risk. Treated  with reduced dose RT (23.4 Gy CSI + 55.8 Gy to posterior fossa) and concurrent vincristine, and randomized to either:  1) CCNU, cisplatin and vincristine or 2) cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, vincristine. Median F/U 5 years
**5-year outcome: EFS 81%, OS 86%. No difference by chemo arm  
**Prognostic factors: anaplasia OS 75% vs. 89% (SS)
**Relapse: posterior fossa alone 32%, disseminated alone 40%, PF+disseminated 25%
**Toxicity: 25% with delayed onset mutism, hypotonia, cerebellar deficits, supranuclear CN deficits, extreme irritability, and/or emotional lability. ~50% residual deficits at 1 year
**Conclusion: Reduced dose CSI with chemo can be done safely to avoid toxicities of higher dose RT. No difference between chemo arms

*'''PNET 3''' (1992-2000) -- '''CSI 35 Gy +/- neoadjuvant chemo'''
**2003, PMID 12697884 -- &quot;Results of a randomized study of preradiation chemotherapy versus radiotherapy alone for nonmetastatic medulloblastoma: The International Society of Paediatric Oncology/United Kingdom Children's Cancer Study Group PNET-3 Study.&quot; (Taylor RE, J Clin Oncol. 2003 Apr 15;21(8):1581-91.)
**Randomized. 179/217 standard risk patients (including M1). Treated with neoadjuvant chemo (vincristine/etoposide/carboplatin/cyclophosphamide) vs. RT alone (CSI 35 Gy + 20 Gy posterior fossa boost). Median F/U 5.4 years. ''Study closed early due to lack of accrual in RT alone arm''
**5-year outcome: OS 70% (NS), EFS chemo-RT 74% vs. RT alone 60% (SS)
**Conclusion: improved EFS with addition of chemo, no impact on survival

*'''SIOP II''' (1984-1989) -- '''CSI 35 Gy vs. CSI 25 Gy; also +/- adjuvant chemo'''
**1995, PMID 7623725 &quot;Prospective randomised trial of chemotherapy given before radiotherapy in childhood medulloblastoma. International Society of Paediatric Oncology (SIOP) and the (German) Society of Paediatric Oncology (GPO)&quot;  Bailey et al.  Med Pediatr Onc 25(3):166-78, 1995
**Randomized. 364 patients. SIOP I low risk (total/subtotal resection, no brain stem invasion, M0) randomized to +/- adjuvant chemo (vincristine, methotrexate, procarbazine), and then randomized to standard CSI 35 Gy vs. reduced CSI 25 Gy. Boost posterior fossa to 55 Gy. High risk randomized to +/- adjuvant chemo, then standard CSI and additional post-RT chemo 
**Outcome: No advantage to pre-RT chemo. Standard CSI 35 Gy for low risk pts increased EFS (68% vs 55%). Low risk patients with adjuvant chemo and CSI 25 Gy did particularly badly
**Conclusion: No benefit to adjuvant chemo. Standard dose of CSI is 35 Gy

*'''SIOP I''' -- '''CSI +/- adjuvant chemo'''
**1990, PMID 2141512 -- &quot;Adjuvant chemotherapy for medulloblastoma: the first multi-centre control trial of the International Society of Paediatric Oncology (SIOP I).&quot; (Tait DM, Eur J Cancer. 1990 Apr;26(4):464-9.)
**Randomized. 286 patients, 15 countries. Treated with CSI, randomized to +/- chemo (concurrent vincristine, then CCNU/vincristine maintenance)
**Survival: 5-year 53%, 10-year 45%. No difference between arms
**Subgroup benefit: subtotal surgery, brainstem involvement, T3-T4 disease
**Conclusion: No difference, but subgroup benefit

*'''CCG 942''' -- '''CSI +/- adjuvant chemo'''
**1990, PMID 2319316 -- &quot;The treatment of medulloblastoma. Results of a prospective randomized trial of radiation therapy with and without CCNU, vincristine, and prednisone.&quot; (Evans AE, J Neurosurg. 1990 Apr;72(4):572-82.)
**Randomized. 233 patients. CSI +/- chemo (CCNU, vincristine, prednisone)
**5-year outcomes: EFS chemo-RT 59% vs. RT alone 50% (NS); OS 65% for both (NS)
**Subgroup benefit: large tumors (EFS chemo-RT 48% vs. RT alone 0%)
**Conclusion: no benefit for chemo in low stage, subgroup benefit for advanced stage

==CSI + adjuvant chemo alternatives==
*'''CCG 921''' (1986-1992) -- vincristine/lomustine/prednisone (VCP) vs. 8-in-1
**Randomized. 427 children &lt;21 years, with medulloblastoma, pineoblastoma, ependymoblastoma, central neuroblastoma, PNET, or malignant ependymoma, with unfavorable features. For ST-PNET required M+ staging. Children age &gt;1.5 years (n=328) received post-op CSI with Arm A) vincristine, lomustine, prednisone vs. Arm B) ''8-in-1'' (cisplatin, procarbazine, lomustine, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, methylprednisolone, hydroxyurea, cytarabine). RT: age &gt;3 received CSI 36 Gy, boost to 50.4-54 Gy spine mets and 54 Gy primary brain site; age &lt;3 received CSI 23.4 Gy with boost to 45 Gy. Children age &lt;1.5 years (n=99) were not randomized and received only Arm B

Median F/U 7.0 years
***Subset analysis. 203 patients with medulloblastoma. Median OS 8-in-1 55% vs. VCP 54% (NS); PFS 63% vs. 45% (SS)
***Prognostic factors: age &lt;3 (who received lower CSI dose); if &gt;3 y/o then M stage (PFS M0 70% vs. M1 57% vs. M2+ 40%, SS); if M0 tumors, then residual (PFS &lt;1.5 cm2 78% vs. &gt;1.5 cm2 54%)
***Conclusion: VCP + XRT superior; if &lt;3 years (with reduced RT) had lowest survival

==Pre-RT chemo vs. Post-RT chemo==
*'''German HIT 91''' (1991-97) -- '''Chemo x2 cycles -&gt;RT vs. RT -&gt; chemo x8 cycles'''
**Trial enrolled pts with supratentorial PNET, medulloblastoma, and anaplastic ependymomas. All treated with extensive resection. In HIT 88/89, pts treated  In HIT 91, randomized to 1) chemo x2 cycles (Ifosfamide, etoposide, MTX, cisplatin, cytarabine) -&gt; RT (CSI 35.2 Gy + PF boost 20 Gy) or 2) immediate RT (35.2 + 20) followed by maintenance chemo x8 cycles (CCNU, cisplatin, vincristine).
**Medullo subset, 2000 PMID 10661332 -- &quot;Postoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy before radiotherapy as compared to immediate radiotherapy followed by maintenance chemotherapy in the treatment of medulloblastoma in childhood: results of the German prospective randomized trial HIT '91.&quot; (Kortmann RD, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2000 Jan 15;46(2):269-79.)
***Subset report of 158 medulloblastoma patients (137 randomized). Median F/U 2.5 years
***3-year outcome: RFS RT-&gt;chemo 78% vs. chemo-&gt;RT 65% (SS), but no difference if age 3-6 years
***Negative prognosis: M2/3 disease, age &lt;8 years. M1 not a bad prognostic factor
**Conclusion: RT upfront with maintenance chemo more effective. Neoadjuvant chemo caused higher RT myelotoxicity, and more RT interruptions</text>

=== Stems ===
In Gothic, like in many, if not all languages, words will change stems to show their meaning. '''Stems''' are sounds added to the ends of a root word to denote what the word really means. For example:
* The stem of '''gifted''' is '''ed''' and the root is '''gift'''. '''ed''' denotes that the action happened in the past.
* The stem of '''precaution''' is '''pre''' and the root is '''caution'''. '''pre''' denotes that this word is before an action.
* The stem of '''lemony''' is '''y''' and the root is '''lemon'''. '''y''' denotes that the word it is describing is similar to the root.
Now that you get the gist of what stems are, you are ready to learn the Gothic stems. The stems used by Gothic are probably larger than in Modern English. They are based on the gender given to an object, their strength, and their case in basis. 

=== The Gothic Stems ===
In Gothic, stems are used mostly to simply describe the case of a word and whether it is masculine, feminine, or neuter in nature. Here are the stems in Gothic. They are all '''suffixes''', or stems that will got on the end of a root rather than the front.

      <text xml:space="preserve">One can prepare most herbal remedies by infusion.  The infusion method involves preparing herbs by placing 1 to 2 teaspoons of dried herb or 2 to 4 fresh herbs in oil or water for approximately ten minutes, then straining.  Waiting too long before straining results in bitter tasting herbs.  People typically prepare teas and herbal teas by infusion.

Long term infusions involve leaving the herbs in the solute for at least one year.  Long term infusions result in highly concentrated solutions similar to essential oils.  Because of their concentration, users of long-term infusions must take greater care with overdose concerns; long term infusions do not function as teas.

==Presentation==

With the Finger Stretching check, you grip a finger firmly, and try to elongate it by pulling. If it stretches, you're dreaming.

See [[Talk:Lucid Dreaming: Reality Checks: Finger Stretching]] for a discussion of this reality check's effectiveness.

==Examples of this reality check working==

* I thought to myself &quot;If I am dreaming, then my finger will stretch if I tug on it hard.&quot;.  I did, and I became lucid.

==Examples of this reality check failing==

* This has yet to fail for the first editor of this article.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== WHNF picture ==

Hi David,

Just thought I might suggest making the WHNF picture correspond to the example, if possible.  Best, -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 06:26, 9 June 2007 (UTC)
:To add to that, boy am I looking forward to this chapter!  I've always had a vague and imprecise understanding about laziness (&quot;sum'ing about thunks&quot;) and would love to be more comfortable with the idea -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 07:17, 9 June 2007 (UTC)

: The reason I didn't do that is because there would be too many stages of evaluation for (length [1..5], reverse &quot;olleh&quot;). It'd go something like this:

 thunk
 (thunk, thunk)
 (length thunk, thunk)
 (length (1:thunk), thunk)
 (1 + length thunk, thunk)
 (1 + length (2:thunk), thunk)
 (1 + 1 + length thunk, thunk)
 (1 + 1 + length (3:thunk), thunk)
 (1 + 1 + 1 + length thunk, thunk)
 (1 + 1 + 1 + length (4:thunk), thunk)
 (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + length thunk, thunk)
 (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1, thunk)
 (5, thunk)
 (5, reverse thunk)
 (5, reverse ('o':thunk))
 (5, reverse thunk ++ [o])
 (5, reverse ('l':thunk) ++ [o])
 (5, reverse thunk ++ [l] ++ [o])
 (5, reverse ('l':thunk) ++ [l] ++ [o])
 (5, reverse thunk ++ [l] ++ [l] ++ [o])
 (5, reverse ('e':thunk) ++ [l] ++ [l] ++ [o])
 (5, reverse thunk ++ [e] ++ [l] ++ [l] ++ [o])
 (5, reverse ('h':thunk) ++ [e] ++ [l] ++ [l] ++ [o])
 (5, reverse thunk ++ [h] ++ [e] ++ [l] ++ [l] ++ [o])
 (5, reverse [] ++ [h] ++ [e] ++ [l] ++ [l] ++ [o])
 (5, [] ++ [h] ++ [e] ++ [l] ++ [l] ++ [o])
 (5, &quot;hello&quot;)

And even that's skipping the definitions of (+) and (++). Something like that could feasibly go into the article proper, though, what do you think? [[User:DavidHouse|DavidHouse]] 10:04, 9 June 2007 (UTC)

:Ouch.  What if we used a shorter example, something like &lt;code&gt;(reverse &quot;hi&quot;)&lt;/code&gt;?  Also, it might be helpful to have the implementation of reverse somewhere in a sidebox maybe (don't know if that would just be distracting).  But yeah, it would probably be useful to have an example worked out in the main text.  It's also more accessible to people who can't see the graphics -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 11:02, 9 June 2007 (UTC)

== Introduction ==

I thought it would be useful to start out with a quick motivation section, not a lot of blah blah but just enough to drive home the point that laziness is more about writing nice code than it is about writing efficient code (as far as I understand).  I would like to have a very simple, minimal &quot;obvious&quot; example without a lot of explanation.  I thought maybe we could lay that example down, not explain it too much, and then add a transition like &quot;so let's see what makes this tick&quot; -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 07:37, 9 June 2007 (UTC)

:I'm somewhat unsatisfied with my ''it makes the right things '''efficient enough''''' because it doesn't capture the idea of making circular code possible in the first place.  I wonder if there is a better way to phrase this -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 11:11, 9 June 2007 (UTC)

== What is strict/lazy ==

Following the introduction, I was thinking that a sort of shallow bullet-pointed overview of laziness and strictness might be helpful, something like:

* data structures are lazy
* functions are lazy wrt their arguments
* pattern matching, however, is strict

Not everything in a lazy language can be lazy, otherwise nothing would ever get done!  Somewhere in the language, we need to have something to force things to get evaluated.  In Haskell, the thing which forces evaluation is pattern matching. -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 08:01, 9 June 2007 (UTC)

: True. I'll add something like this in to the first section. [[User:DavidHouse|DavidHouse]] 09:55, 9 June 2007 (UTC)

== Possible split ==
I've thought about splitting this article into two sections, one that explains the theory behind lazy evaluation and one that will probably get merged with the Strictness article and can talk about the performance implications of laziness. Thoughs? [[User:DavidHouse|DavidHouse]] 10:06, 9 June 2007 (UTC)

:Well, that sounds like a good idea.  On the other hand, there is this point that making code lazier can sometimes result in performance gains (but i guess that could appear in the Strictness chapter too).  I would say that if you're going to split the article, trying moving them directly to Strictness first.  But otherwise, maybe it's best to just leave those bits as stub and see how the situation clarifies itself as the rest of the article gets written -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 11:05, 9 June 2007 (UTC)

:: Well, yeah, the idea was to have a &quot;Laziness and nonstrictness&quot; section where we explore why it's important to have nonstrict semantics in Haskell (the kinds of things that are going into your introduction, easier to write concise code, don't have to worry about execution order etc., ''brief'' mention of performance gains) and how this is implemented (explain laziness in terms of thunks), then have a different chapter where we look at the performance implications of nonstrictness and cover way to make your program more strict and ways to make it lazier, and when either is beneficial. [[User:DavidHouse|DavidHouse]] 11:34, 9 June 2007 (UTC)

:::* Splitting sounds good. I originally intended that the chapter [[Haskell/Graph reduction]] covers how functional programs are evaluated at all, i.e. what the different normal forms are and how lazy and eager evaluation work. So, the basic question is &quot;How to evaluate an expression?&quot;. It really helps to do several reductions by hand on a piece of paper. Maybe the chapter name is too special, something like [[Haskell/Evaluating Functional Programs]] would be more fitting. Mixing _|_ into the reduction strategy discussion is more confusing than helpful, because it has to be mentioned over and over again. But I think it can be put in a separate extra section &quot;Approximating Reduction with Denotational Semantics&quot; or something like that. Basic cheat: assume that Haskell has lazy evaluation but don't mention this false claim :-)
:::* The plan for [[Haskell/Laziness]] was to showcase the benefits and power of lazy evaluation. There are some points to make: formulating algorithms compositionally without damaging asymptotic time complexity, create your own control structures, infinite data structures, tying knots, memoization. Reasoning about space and time complexity is needed a bit, but detailed methods (from Okasaki's book) are probably best left to a data structure chapter. This means that this chapter should not explain what lazy evaluation is, that has to be done in [[Haskell/Graph reduction]].
:::* For [[Haskell/Strictness]], I had in mind that it should explain how to enforce strictness and when or when not we want that at all.

== When to use lazy pattern matching ==

The article says to use lazy pattern matching when there is only one constructor. But normally (except in the case of tuples) you can declare a type having only one constructor as a newtype, and then there's no pattern match overhead because the constructor doesn't actually exist at runtime! So it seems that it's only useful for tuples - am I wrong?--[[User:Greenrd|Greenrd]] 21:26, 21 June 2007 (UTC)

:Well, the constructor may have multiple arguments &lt;code&gt;data Stream a = S a (Stream a)&lt;/code&gt;. But of course, you can replace this with a tuple in a newtype: &lt;code&gt;newtype Stream a = S (a,Stream a)&lt;/code&gt; and lazy pattern match as in &lt;code&gt;f (S ~(x,xs)) = ...&lt;/code&gt;.
:However, lazy pattern matches are also useful with multiple constructors, namely with the &quot;blueprint technique&quot;. An intended rewrite of this chapter will incorporate a section on this. In the meantime, see also

Another interesting sample where lazy pattern matching is needed is shown here:
[http://www.haskell.org/tutorial/patterns.html#sect4.4 Lazy patterns]. Two mutual recursive functions are defined producing lists, which represent a couple of interacting automata (a &quot;server&quot; and a &quot;client&quot;) exchanging tokens; without lazy patterns the two agents would deadlock waiting for each other's token.

== let (x,y) = ... in ==

About the following quote from the text:

 let (x, y) = (length [1..5], reverse &quot;olleh&quot;) in ...
«(We'll assume that in the 'in' part, we use x and y somewhere. Otherwise, we're not forced to evaluate the let-binding at all; the right-hand side could have been undefined and it would still work if the 'in' part doesn't mention x or y. This assumption will remain for all the examples in this section.)»

I question the validity of that comment. As I understand it, the text implies that until x and y are not used, the pattern matching is not run; but a ''non-lazy'' pattern matching is used, so the right-hand side of the let binding must be evaluated, and cannot be undefined.
What is correct to say is that &quot;length [1..5]&quot; and reverse &quot;olleh&quot; could be undefined, if x and y are not used.

-- [[User:Blaisorblade|Blaisorblade]] ([[User talk:Blaisorblade|talk]]) 17:30, 30 December 2007 (UTC)

:Let bindings - as opposed to case-expressions - are always lazy, so it's indeed true that the right-hand side won't be evaluated until x or y are demanded. But the whole chapter needs a big overhaul anyway, and I plan to rewrite this example. -- [[User:Apfelmus|apfe&lt;b&gt;&amp;lambda;&lt;/b&gt;mus]] 09:19, 1 February 2008 (UTC)

== isInfixOf xs [1..] ==
&lt;code&gt;isInfixOf xs [1..]&lt;/code&gt; is presented like it will terminate, even if [1..] is infinite. I think it is a mistake: it should either return True or not terminate at all. I suggest we show two examples instead: one which make an infinite list from another infinite list (like map, tail --filter isn't completely safe), and another which produce a finite result from an infinite list (like take 42, head).

:Right, the example is not so good. Concerning this subsection, I had examples similar to John Hughes' &quot;Why functional programming matters&quot; in mind. I'll rewrite the stuff here at some point. -- [[User:Apfelmus|apfe&lt;b&gt;&amp;lambda;&lt;/b&gt;mus]] 09:19, 1 February 2008 (UTC)

== &quot;Bad haskellish logic&quot; comments ==

I removed from the body of the article the accusations of rose-tinted glasses shown in [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Haskell%2FLaziness&amp;diff=2315176&amp;oldid=2314420 this diff]. While that section is not, IMO, significantly misleading, I tried to account partially for the criticism by qualifying one of the claims in the first sentence. --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Duplode|contribs]]) 09:04, 1 May 2012 (UTC)</text>

&lt;/div&gt;

==Atomic hydrogen==
While de Broglie's theory of 1923 featured circular electron waves, Schrödinger's &quot;wave mechanics&quot; of 1926 features standing waves in three dimensions. Finding them means finding the solutions of the time-independent Schrödinger equation
:&lt;math&gt;
E\psi(\mathbf{r})=-{\hbar^2\over2m}\left(\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}+
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2}+\frac{\partial^2}{\partial z^2}\right)\psi(\mathbf{r})+V(\mathbf{r})\,\psi(\mathbf{r}).
&lt;/math&gt;
with &lt;math&gt;V(\mathbf{r})=-e^2/r,&lt;/math&gt; the potential energy of a classical electron at a distance &lt;math&gt;r=|\mathbf{r}|&lt;/math&gt; from the proton. (Only when we come to the relativistic theory will we be able to shed the last vestige of classical thinking.)
:&lt;math&gt;
E\psi(\mathbf{r})=-{\hbar^2\over2m}\left(\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}+
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2}+\frac{\partial^2}{\partial z^2}\right)\psi(\mathbf{r})-\frac{e^2}{r}V(\mathbf{r})\,\psi(\mathbf{r}).
&lt;/math&gt;
In using this equation, we ignore (i) the influence of the electron on the proton, whose mass is some 1836 times larger than that of he electron, and (ii) the electron's spin. Since relativistic and spin effects on the measurable properties of atomic hydrogen are rather small, this non-relativistic approximation nevertheless gives excellent results.

For bound states the total energy &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is negative, and the Schrödinger equation has a discrete set of solutions. As it turns out, the &quot;allowed&quot; values of &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; are precisely the values that Bohr obtained in 1913:
:&lt;math&gt;
E_n=-{1\over n^2}\,{\mu e^4\over2\hbar^2},\qquad n=1,2,3,\dots
&lt;/math&gt;
However, for each &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; there are now &lt;math&gt;n^2&lt;/math&gt; linearly independent solutions. (If &lt;math&gt;\psi_{1},\dots,\psi_{k}&lt;/math&gt; are independent solutions, then none of them can be written as a linear combination &lt;math&gt;\sum a_i\psi_i&lt;/math&gt; of the others.)

Solutions with different &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; correspond to different energies. What physical differences correspond to linearly independent solutions with the same &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;?

[[image: Polarcoordinates.png|right|360px]]
Using polar coordinates, one finds that all solutions for a particular value &lt;math&gt;E_n&lt;/math&gt; are linear combinations of solutions that have the form
:&lt;math&gt;
\psi(r,\phi,\theta)=e^{(i/\hbar)\,l_z\,\phi}\psi(r,\theta).
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;l_z&lt;/math&gt; turns out to be another ''quantized'' variable, for &lt;math&gt;e^{(i/\hbar)\,l_z\,\phi}=e^{(i/\hbar)\,l_z\,(\phi\pm2\pi)}&lt;/math&gt; implies that &lt;math&gt;l_z=m\hbar&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;m=0,\pm1,\pm2,\dots&lt;/math&gt; In addition, &lt;math&gt;|m|&lt;/math&gt; has an upper bound, as we shall see in a moment.

Just as the factorization of &lt;math&gt;\psi(t,\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;e^{-(i/\hbar)\,E\,t}\,\psi(\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt; made it possible to obtain a &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;-independent Schrödinger equation, so the factorization of &lt;math&gt;\psi(r,\phi,\theta)&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;e^{(i/\hbar)\,l_z\,\phi}\,\psi(r,\theta)&lt;/math&gt; makes it possible to obtain a &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;-independent Schrödinger equation. This contains another real parameter &lt;math&gt;\Lambda,&lt;/math&gt; over and above &lt;math&gt;m,&lt;/math&gt; whose &quot;allowed&quot; values are given by &lt;math&gt;l(l+1)\hbar^2,&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; an integer satisfying &lt;math&gt;0\leq l\leq n-1.&lt;/math&gt; The range of possible values for &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is bounded by the inequality &lt;math&gt;|m|\leq l.&lt;/math&gt; The possible values of the ''principal quantum number'' &lt;math&gt;n,&lt;/math&gt; the ''angular momentum quantum number'' &lt;math&gt;l,&lt;/math&gt; and the so-called ''magnetic quantum number'' &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; thus are:

Each possible set of quantum numbers &lt;math&gt;n,l,m&lt;/math&gt; defines a unique wave function &lt;math&gt;\psi_{nlm}(t,\mathbf{r}),&lt;/math&gt; and together these make up a complete set of bound-state solutions (&lt;math&gt;E&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;) of the Schrödinger equation with &lt;math&gt;V(\mathbf{r})=-e^2/r.&lt;/math&gt; The following images give an idea of the position probability distributions of the first three &lt;math&gt;l=0&lt;/math&gt; states (not to scale). Below them are the probability densities plotted against &lt;math&gt;r.&lt;/math&gt; Observe that these states have &lt;math&gt;n-1&lt;/math&gt; nodes, all of which are spherical, that is, surfaces of constant &lt;math&gt;r.&lt;/math&gt; (The nodes of a wave in three dimensions are two-dimensional surfaces. The nodes of a &quot;probability wave&quot; are the surfaces at which the sign of &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; changes and, consequently, the probability density &lt;math&gt;|\psi|^2&lt;/math&gt; vanishes.)

&lt;br&gt;[[image:S states.jpg|520px]]

&lt;br&gt;Take another look at these images:

&lt;br&gt;&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Orbitals1.png|&lt;math&gt;
Image:Orbitals2.png|&lt;math&gt;
Image:Orbitals3.png|&lt;math&gt;
Image:Orbitals4.png|&lt;math&gt;
Image:Orbitals1a.png|&lt;math&gt;\rho_{2p0}&lt;/math&gt;
Image:Orbitals2a.png|&lt;math&gt;\rho_{3p0}&lt;/math&gt;
Image:Orbitals3a.png|&lt;math&gt;\rho_{3d0}&lt;/math&gt;
Image:Orbitals4a.png|&lt;math&gt;\rho_{4p0}&lt;/math&gt;
Image:Orbitals5.png|&lt;math&gt;
Image:Orbitals6.png|&lt;math&gt;
Image:Orbitals7.png|&lt;math&gt;
Image:Orbitals8.png|&lt;math&gt;
Image:Orbitals5a.png|&lt;math&gt;\rho_{4d0}&lt;/math&gt;
Image:Orbitals6a.png|&lt;math&gt;\rho_{4f0}&lt;/math&gt;
Image:Orbitals7a.png|&lt;math&gt;\rho_{5d0}&lt;/math&gt;
Image:Orbitals8a.png|&lt;math&gt;\rho_{5f0}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;

&lt;br&gt;The letters s,p,d,f stand for l=0,1,2,3, respectively. (Before the quantum-mechanical origin of atomic spectral lines was understood, a distinction was made between &quot;sharp,&quot; &quot;principal,&quot; &quot;diffuse,&quot; and &quot;fundamental&quot; lines. These terms were subsequently found to correspond to the first four values that &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; can take. From &lt;math&gt;l=3&lt;/math&gt; onward the labels follows the alphabet: f,g,h...) Observe that these states display both spherical and conical nodes, the latter being surfaces of constant &lt;math&gt;\theta.&lt;/math&gt; (The &quot;conical&quot; node with &lt;math&gt;\theta=0&lt;/math&gt; is a horizontal plane.) These states, too, have a total of &lt;math&gt;n-1&lt;/math&gt; nodes, &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; of which are conical.

Because the &quot;waviness&quot; in &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is contained in a phase factor &lt;math&gt;e^{im\phi},&lt;/math&gt; it does not show up in representations of &lt;math&gt;|\psi|^2.&lt;/math&gt; To make it visible, it is customary to replace &lt;math&gt;e^{im\phi}&lt;/math&gt; by its real part &lt;math&gt;\cos(m\phi),&lt;/math&gt; as in the following images, which do ''not'' represent probability distributions.

&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Orbitals1b.jpg|&lt;math&gt;\rho_{4f1}&lt;/math&gt;
Image:Orbitals2b.jpg|&lt;math&gt;\rho_{4f3}&lt;/math&gt;
Image:Orbitals3b.jpg|&lt;math&gt;\rho_{5f1}&lt;/math&gt;
Image:Orbitals4b.jpg|&lt;math&gt;\rho_{5f2}&lt;/math&gt;
Image:Orbitals5b.jpg|&lt;math&gt;\rho_{5f3}&lt;/math&gt;
Image:Orbitals6b.jpg|&lt;math&gt;\rho_{5g1}&lt;/math&gt;
Image:Orbitals7b.jpg|&lt;math&gt;\rho_{5g2}&lt;/math&gt;
Image:Orbitals8b.jpg|&lt;math&gt;\rho_{5g3}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;

The total number of nodes is again &lt;math&gt;n-1,&lt;/math&gt; the total number of non-spherical nodes is again &lt;math&gt;l,&lt;/math&gt; but now there are &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; plane nodes containing the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; axis and &lt;math&gt;l-m&lt;/math&gt; conical nodes.

What is so special about the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; axis? Absolutely nothing, for the wave functions &lt;math&gt;\psi'_{nlm},&lt;/math&gt; which are defined with respect to a different axis, make up another complete set of bound-state solutions. This means that every wave function &lt;math&gt;\psi'_{nlm}&lt;/math&gt; can be written as a linear combination of the functions &lt;math&gt;\psi_{nlm},&lt;/math&gt; and vice versa.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Really Quick Start=

* Checkout the Project Wonder - the ERSelenium is in the Wonder/Common/Frameworks folder.
* Examine test cases from ERSeleniumExample/Resources/Selenium/main/ and from [http://wiki.objectstyle.org/confluence/display/WONDER/Getting+Started+with+BugTracker BugTracker] in Eclipse text editor.
* Launch ERSeleniumExample and point your browser to SeleniumStartTesting Direct Action url (e.g. http://192.168.0.58/cgi-bin/WebObjects/ERSeleniumExample.woa/-42422/wa/SeleniumStartTesting).

You can also use Selenium IDE to create and edit tests:
* Launch FireFox and install [http://release.openqa.org/selenium-ide/0.8.7/selenium-ide-0.8.7.xpi Selenium IDE Firefox plugin].
* Using [http://wiki.openqa.org/display/SIDE/Contributed+Extensions+and+Formats Selenium IDE format plugin installation instructions] install Selenese-ide-plugin.js (it is in ERSelenium/Resources).
* Play around with test cases from ERSeleniumExample/Resources/Selenium/ using Selenium IDE.

=Overview and Usage Notes=

ERSelenium provides several features for effective use of [http://openqa.org/selenium-core/ SeleniumCore] with WebObjects applications including:
* Custom setup/teardown actions that can be run before/after each test.
* Base URL independence.
* Support of HTML and Selenese test formats (Java support is planned).
* &quot;On-the-fly&quot; generation of test suites from the files in your project's source tree.
* Bookmarkable DirectAction url to run all tests (can be used for automated testing).
* Metacommands (special instructions specified in comments).
  
''[http://openqa.org/selenium-core/ SeleniumCore] is the powerful javascript toolkit for web applications &quot;black-box&quot; testing. It emulates different kinds of user actions such as: clicking the hyperlink, editing text in the input field, choosing item from the list and so on.''

==Using ERSelenium==

You can use ERSelenium directly from workspace:
# Specify it as your project's workspace dependency .
# Enable it in the project's Properties file:
&lt;pre&gt;
SeleniumTestsEnabled=true
&lt;/pre&gt;
   
Debug output of ERSelenium can be enabled in Properties by:
&lt;pre&gt;
log4j.logger.er.selenium = DEBUG
&lt;/pre&gt;

Other ERSelenium properties:
* '''SeleniumTestsRoot=&quot;SomeOtherPath&quot;''' - change the tests location. By default ERSelenium will search for tests in &quot;Resources/Selenium&quot;.
* '''SeleniumActionsClass=&quot;FullClassName&quot;''' - specifies the class with methods, which should be executed before and during the test using SeleniumAction direct action (see below for details). By default SeleniumDefaultSetupActions class is used.
* '''SeleniumReportPath=&quot;PathName&quot;''' - specified the path to the report file, which is created after the testing is done. &quot;./Contents/Resources/&quot; is the default value.

In your SeleniumTestsRoot folder (Resources/Selenium by default) you should create tests hierarchy. Tests are divided into groups, each group is located in its own folder. In each folder there should be a collection of test files, each in one of the formats, supported by ERSelenium. Example hierarchy:
&lt;pre&gt;
./Resources
  ./Selenium
    ./registration
      ./successful.sel
      ./alreadyexists.sel
    ./shop
      ./buyitem.html
      ./notenoughmoney.html
      ./transfer.sel
&lt;/pre&gt;

You can use both standard HTML and wiki-like Selenese formats for writing tests although Selenese format is usually a preferred choice.

To run all tests point your browser to SeleniumStartTesting Direct Action:
http://[baseurl]/wa/SeleniumStartTesting

Example:
http://127.0.0.1/cgi-bin/WebObjects/SampleProject.woa/-42421/wa/SeleniumStartTesting

To run a specific group of tests, add &quot;/TestGroupName&quot;:

&lt;/pre&gt;

=Some tips for writing tests for ERSelenium=
* Don't use full URLs with open/openWindow commands (http://[baseurl] part will be added by ERSelenium):
&lt;pre&gt;
  |open|/wa/EditPerson|
  |open|/|
&lt;/pre&gt;
* You can use setup/teardown methods from the class, specified in SeleniumActionsClass property by opening /wa/SeleniumAction/methodName URL, e.g.:
&lt;pre&gt;
  |open|/wa/SeleniumAction/resetSession|
&lt;/pre&gt;
* You can use @repeat-@values-@done metacommands to execute specific part of the test with different values edited in textboxes, e.g.:
&lt;pre&gt;
  |open|/|
  @repeat
  ...some actions...
  @values __selenium_test@ @__sel notcorrect@@
  |type|xpath=id('content')/input|__selenium_test@incorrectdomain|
  ...some actions...
  @done
&lt;/pre&gt;
The commands between @repeat and @done will be repeated several times, each time with new value in &quot;xpath=id('content')/input&quot; input field.
  
''Note: in Selenese format, lines that don't begin with &quot;|&quot; are treated as comments, so metacommands in the example above will be safely processed by Selenium IDE.''
* [http://release.openqa.org/selenium-ide/0.8.7/selenium-ide-0.8.7.xpi Selenium IDE Firefox plugin] and [https://addons.mozilla.org/ru/firefox/addon/1095  XPath Checker] can be very handy for creating and editing Selenium tests. Selenium IDE Selenese source plugin with proper comments support resides in ERSelenium/Resources/selenese-ide-plugin.js.

== Overview ==

'''''Mrs. Norris''''' is a cat, the pet of [[../Argus Filch/]], the caretaker at [[../../Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]. She is described as a thoroughly unpleasant cat, almost skeletally thin; but Filch evidently cares very deeply for her.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] ===

When [[../Harry Potter|Harry]], [[../Ron Weasley|Ron]], [[../Hermione Granger|Hermione]], and [[../Neville Longbottom|Neville]] are in the Trophy Room waiting for [[../Draco Malfoy/]] to arrive for the promised Wizard's Duel at midnight, Filch's approach is heralded by us overhearing him talking to Mrs. Norris.

As Harry is on his way to the library at Christmas, under his [[../../Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloak]], he passes Mrs. Norris in the halls. Mrs. Norris seems to be able to perceive him, but may not be able to recognize him as a student; in any event, she allows him to pass without going for Filch.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] ===

During [[../Nearly Headless Nick/]]'s Deathday party, Mrs. Norris is Petrified and left hanging by her tail from a torch bracket. Filch is fiercely angry at this, demanding that someone must be punished. He spends much of the book sitting at the spot where Mrs. Norris was actually left hanging.

== Strengths ==

== Weaknesses ==

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

Mrs. Norris seems to distrust all of the Hogwarts students, and seems to have no mission in life other than to report their infractions to Filch. In return, all of the students detest Mrs. Norris, and many have expressed a wish to do her harm; however, whether through their fear of Filch or their inability to catch her, no harm has yet befallen her from the students.

== Analysis ==

Mrs. Norris seems exceptionally smart for a cat, to the point that we might think her a cat / [[../../Magic/Kneazle|Kneazle]] cross like [[../Crookshanks/]], an [[../../Magic/Animagus|Animagus]], or Filch's familiar, it those existed in this world. However, [http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/rumours_view.cfm?id=40 the author has stated] that she is just a highly unpleasant cat.

      <comment>/* Command Line -- Interfacing */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">What about this for example:

 for /R %%A in (*.mpg) do IF NOT EXIST &quot;%dgindex%&quot; &quot;%~1%%~pnA.d2v&quot; -AIF=[%~1%%~pnxA] -OF=[%~1%%~pnA] -exit

as an example for parsing all .d2v files within a directory using DGIndex (a program part of video-editing).

I didn't write the command myself, but I just tweaked the one I was given to suit the task at hand.
Can anyone explain the use of the 'A' variable instead of 'I' in %~1%%~pnxA, and maybe explain fully what exactly is implied here?

== Command Line -- Interfacing ==

I created CountArgs.exe and counts.bat precisely according to your examples, and the value returned in DOS prompt wasn't 3, but 4.
Is there any mistake?

''I believe so, I have attempted to correct it''--[[User:AAdaamS|AAdaamS]] ([[User talk:AAdaamS|talk]]) 11:48, 30 July 2008 (UTC)

== Format of wiki page ==
Sorry for being negative, but the formating of the wiki text is quite bad. If just feels someone has copied the text from somewhere.

== Method of getting user input ==
User input in DOS is very hard to get, but there are two things that you can do: &lt;tt&gt;SET /p&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;CHOICE.COM&lt;/tt&gt;. The former is a DOS command that puts user input into a variable. The latter is a dos program you can download. I might document these some time in this book if I can.

== History ==
When the first modern digital computers appeared in the early 1940s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Leondes|title= intelligent systems: technology and applications|year=2002| publisher=CRC Press| isbn =9780849311215 | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt; the instructions to make them operate were wired into the machine.  At this time, people working with computers were engineers, mostly electrical engineers.  This hardware centric design was not flexible and was quickly replaced with the &quot;stored program architecture&quot; or von Neumann architecture.  Thus the first division between &quot;hardware&quot; and &quot;software&quot; began with abstraction being used to deal with the complexity of computing.

Programming languages started to appear in the 1950s and this was also another major step in abstraction.  Major languages such as Fortran, ALGOL, and COBOL were released in the late 1950s to deal with scientific, algorithmic, and business problems respectively.  E.W. Dijkstra wrote his seminal paper, &quot;Go To Statement Considered Harmful&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; in 1968 and David Parnas introduced the key concept of modularity and information hiding in 1972&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; to help programmers deal with the ever increasing complexity of software systems.  A software system for managing the hardware called an operating system was also introduced, most notably by Unix in 1969. In 1967, the Simula language introduced the object-oriented programming paradigm.

These advances in software were met with more advances in computer hardware.  In the mid 1970s, the microcomputer was introduced, making it economical for hobbyists to obtain a computer and write software for it.  This in turn led to the now famous Personal Computer (PC) and Microsoft Windows.  The Software Development Life Cycle or SDLC was also starting to appear as a consensus for centralized construction of software in the mid 1980s. The late 1970s and early 1980s saw the introduction of several new Simula-inspired object-oriented programming languages, including Smalltalk, Objective-C, and C++.

Open-source software started to appear in the early 90s in the form of Linux and other software introducing the &quot;bazaar&quot; or decentralized style of constructing software.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond, Eric S. ''The Cathedral and the Bazaar''. ed 3.0. 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;  Then the World Wide Web and the popularization of the Internet hit in the mid 90s, changing the engineering of software once again.  Distributed systems gained sway as a way to design systems, and the Java programming language was introduced with its virtual machine as another step in abstraction.  Programmers collaborated and wrote the Agile Manifesto, which favored more lightweight processes to create cheaper and more timely software.

The current definition of ''software engineering'' is still being debated by practitioners today as they struggle to come up with ways to produce software that is &quot;cheaper, better, faster&quot;. Cost reduction has been a primary focus of the IT industry since the 1990s.  Total cost of ownership represents the costs of more than just acquisition. It includes things like productivity impediments, upkeep efforts, and resources needed to support infrastructure.

      <comment>/* Text Interface */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Installation==

If you have just obtained a copy of Mathematica, you will need to install it on your system. To do this, you should follow the instructions that come with your copy.

==Interfacing with Mathematica==

Mathematica runs as a &quot;kernel&quot; which performs the calculations and the &quot;front-end&quot; with which it communicates with the user by input and output. Mathematica can be used either through interactive &quot;notebook&quot; files or through a command prompt-style text interface. 

===Notebook Interface===
The notebook style interface can be started by clicking a Mathematica icon or a Mathematica entry on the start menu. When this is done, a blank notebook is opened.

You can then input commands into the notebook inteface. Pressing &lt;tt&gt;Shift-Enter&lt;/tt&gt; executes the command and produces the output you desire.

When a command is executed, it is labeled automatically by &lt;tt&gt;In[n]:=&lt;/tt&gt;, where &quot;&lt;tt&gt;n&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; is a unique identifier (for that session) for your input. The corresponding output is labeled &lt;tt&gt;Out[n]:=&lt;/tt&gt;. For example, consider the following command where you add 2 and 3. You simply type &quot;&lt;tt&gt;2+3&lt;/tt&gt; and press &lt;tt&gt;Shift-Enter&lt;/tt&gt;. The notebook will then display the following:

 In[1]:=  '''2+3'''

 Out[1]=  5

====Quitting====
To quit the notebook, you may click the &quot;X&quot; in the top-right of the notebook window, or press &lt;tt&gt;Ctrl-F4&lt;/tt&gt; or select the &lt;tt&gt;Close&lt;/tt&gt; menu item in the File menu. This will prompt you to save if the notebook has been edited since the last save. To close the whole of Mathematica, click the &quot;X&quot; in the top right of the Mathematica window, or select the &lt;tt&gt;Exit&lt;/tt&gt; option on the File menu.

===Text Interface===

The text interface can be started in a terminal (command “math”). Input is entered as usual but it's only necessary to press “enter” to execute commands (some characters though cannot be entered — greek letters, integrals, etc. — but equivalent commands will exist).  Because of the terminal's limitations, the output is formatted differently from the graphical interface: when possible formulae are rendered with 2D constructs mimicking fractions, exponents, etc., while plots are not shown (a string “-Graphics-” appears instead).

To quit the text interface, one can use the “&lt;code&gt;Quit[]&lt;/code&gt;” command or type an “end of file” character (Unix: &lt;code&gt;Ctrl-D&lt;/code&gt;).

The text interface is most suitable to the batch execution of code or remote development when desktop sharing isn't an option (either because the bandwidth doesn't allow it or when there are restrictions preventing one from resorting to the notebook interface). This can be done by writing the code in a file and tell Mathematica to run it. This would typically be run as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
math &lt; code.m
&lt;/source&gt;

[[This quantum world/Implications and applications/Atomic hydrogen|'''&amp;lt; PREVIOUS''']]
&lt;/div&gt;

==Observables and operators==
Remember the mean values
:&lt;math&gt;
\langle x\rangle=\int |\psi|^2\,x\,dx \quad\hbox{and}\quad 
\langle p\rangle=\hbar\langle k\rangle=\int |\overline{\psi}|^2\,\hbar k\,dk.
&lt;/math&gt;
As noted already, if we define the operators
:&lt;math&gt;
\hat x=x&lt;/math&gt; (&quot;multiply with &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&quot;) and &lt;math&gt;\hat p=-i\hbar\frac\partial{\partial x},&lt;/math&gt;
then we can write
:&lt;math&gt;
\langle x\rangle=\int \psi^*\,\hat x\,\psi\,dx\quad\hbox{and}\quad 
\langle p\rangle=\int \psi^*\,\hat p\,\psi\,dx.
&lt;/math&gt;
By the same token,
:&lt;math&gt;
\langle E\rangle=\int \psi^*\,\hat E\,\psi\,dx \quad\hbox{with}\quad \hat E=i\hbar\frac\partial{\partial t}.
&lt;/math&gt;
Which observable is associated with the differential operator &lt;math&gt;\partial/\partial\phi&lt;/math&gt;? If &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; are constant (as the partial derivative with respect to &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; requires), then &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; is constant, and
:&lt;math&gt;
{\partial\psi\over\partial\phi}={\partial y\over\partial\phi}\,{\partial\psi\over\partial y}+{\partial x\over\partial\phi}\,{\partial\psi\over\partial x}.
&lt;/math&gt;
Given that &lt;math&gt;x=r\sin\theta\,\cos\phi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y=r\sin\theta\,\sin\phi,&lt;/math&gt; this works out at &lt;math&gt;x{\partial\psi\over\partial y}-y{\partial\psi\over\partial x}&lt;/math&gt; or 
:&lt;math&gt;
-i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial\phi}=\hat x\hat p_y - \hat y\hat p_x.
&lt;/math&gt;
Since, classically, orbital angular momentum is given by &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L}=\mathbf{r}\times\mathbf{p},&lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt;L_z=x\,p_y-y\,p_x,&lt;/math&gt; it seems obvious that we should consider &lt;math&gt;\hat x\hat p_y - \hat y\hat p_x&lt;/math&gt; as the operator &lt;math&gt;\hat l_z&lt;/math&gt; associated with the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;component of the atom's angular momentum.

Yet we need to be wary of basing quantum-mechanical definitions on classical ones. Here are the quantum-mechanical definitions:

Consider the wave function &lt;math&gt;\psi(q_k,t)&lt;/math&gt; of a closed system &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;degrees of freedom. Suppose that the probability distribution &lt;math&gt;|\psi(q_k,t)|^2&lt;/math&gt; (which is short for &lt;math&gt;|\psi(q_1,\dots,q_K,t)|^2&lt;/math&gt;) is invariant under translations in time: waiting for any amount of time &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; makes no difference to it:
:&lt;math&gt;
|\psi(q_k,t)|^2=|\psi(q_k,t+\tau)|^2.
&lt;/math&gt;
Then the time dependence of &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; is confined to a phase factor &lt;math&gt;e^{i\alpha(q_k,t)}.&lt;/math&gt;

Further suppose that the time coordinate&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; and the space coordinates&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;q_k&lt;/math&gt; are homogeneous — equal intervals are physically equivalent. Since &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; is closed, the phase factor &lt;math&gt;e^{i\alpha(q_k,t)}&lt;/math&gt; cannot then depend on&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;q_k,&lt;/math&gt; and its phase can at most linearly depend on&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;t:&lt;/math&gt; waiting for &lt;math&gt;2\tau&lt;/math&gt; should have the same effect as twice waiting for&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\tau.&lt;/math&gt; In other words, multiplying the wave function by &lt;math&gt;e^{i\alpha(2\tau)}&lt;/math&gt; should have same effect as multiplying it twice by &lt;math&gt;e^{i\alpha(\tau)}&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;
e^{i\alpha(2\tau)}=[e^{i\alpha(\tau)}]^2=e^{i2\alpha(\tau)}.
&lt;/math&gt;
Thus
:&lt;math&gt;
\psi(q_k,t)=\psi(q_k)\,e^{-i\omega t}=\psi(q_k)\,e^{-(i/\hbar)E\,t}.
&lt;/math&gt;
So the existence of a constant (&quot;conserved&quot;) quantity &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; or (in conventional units)&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is implied for a closed system, and this is what we mean by the ''energy'' of the system.

Now suppose that &lt;math&gt;|\psi(q_k,t)|^2&lt;/math&gt; is invariant under translations in the direction of one of the spatial coordinates&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;q_k,&lt;/math&gt; say&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;q_j&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;
|\psi(q_j,q_{k\neq j},t)|^2=|\psi(q_j+\kappa,q_{k\neq j},t)|^2.
&lt;/math&gt;
Then the dependence of &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;q_j&lt;/math&gt; is confined to a phase factor &lt;math&gt;e^{i\beta(q_k,t)}.&lt;/math&gt;

And suppose again that the time coordinates&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; and&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;q_k&lt;/math&gt; are homogeneous. Since &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; is closed, the phase factor &lt;math&gt;e^{i\beta(q_k,t)}&lt;/math&gt; cannot then depend on&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;q_{k\neq j}&lt;/math&gt; or&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;t,&lt;/math&gt; and its phase can at most linearly depend on&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;q_j&lt;/math&gt;: translating &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;2\kappa&lt;/math&gt; should have the same effect as twice translating it by&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\kappa.&lt;/math&gt; In other words, multiplying the wave function by &lt;math&gt;e^{i\beta(2\kappa)}&lt;/math&gt; should have same effect as multiplying it twice by &lt;math&gt;e^{i\beta(\kappa)}&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;
e^{i\beta(2\kappa)}=[e^{i\beta(\kappa)}]^2=e^{i2\beta(\kappa)}.
&lt;/math&gt;
Thus
:&lt;math&gt;
\psi(q_k,t)=\psi(q_{k\neq j},t)\,e^{i\,k_j\,q_k}=\psi(q_{k\neq j},t)\,e^{(i/\hbar)\,p_j\,q_k}.
&lt;/math&gt;
So the existence of a constant (&quot;conserved&quot;) quantity &lt;math&gt;k_j&lt;/math&gt; or (in conventional units)&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;p_j&lt;/math&gt; is implied for a closed system, and this is what we mean by the j-component of the system's ''momentum''.

You get the picture. Moreover, the spatial coordiates might as well be the spherical coordinates &lt;math&gt;r,\theta,\phi.&lt;/math&gt; If &lt;math&gt;|\psi(r,\theta,\phi,t)|^2&lt;/math&gt; is invariant under rotations about the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;axis, and if the longitudinal coordinate &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is homogeneous, then
:&lt;math&gt;
\psi(r,\theta,\phi,t)=\psi(r,\theta,t)\,e^{i m\phi}=\psi(r,\theta,t)\,e^{(i/\hbar) l_z\phi}.
&lt;/math&gt;
In this case we call the conserved quantity the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;component of the system's ''angular momentum''.

&lt;br&gt;
----

&lt;br&gt;Now suppose that &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt; is an observable, that &lt;math&gt;\hat O&lt;/math&gt; is the corresponding operator, and that &lt;math&gt;\psi_{\hat O,v}&lt;/math&gt; satisfies
:&lt;math&gt;
\hat O\,\psi_{\hat O,v}=v\,\psi_{\hat O,v}.
&lt;/math&gt;
We say that &lt;math&gt;\psi_{\hat O,v}&lt;/math&gt; is an ''eigenfunction'' or ''eigenstate'' of the operator&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\hat O,&lt;/math&gt; and that it has the ''eigenvalue''&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;v.&lt;/math&gt; Let's calculate the mean and the standard deviation of&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\psi_{\hat O,v}.&lt;/math&gt; We obviously have that
:&lt;math&gt;
\langle O\rangle=\int\psi^*_{\hat O,v}\hat O\,\psi_{\hat O,v}\,dx=\int\psi^*_{\hat O,v}v\,\psi_{\hat O,v}\,dx=v\int|\psi_{\hat O,v}|^2\,dx=v.
&lt;/math&gt;
Hence
:&lt;math&gt;
\Delta O=\sqrt{\int \psi^*_{\hat O,v}\,(\hat O-v)\,(\hat O-v)\,\psi_{\hat O,v}\,dx }=0,
&lt;/math&gt;
since &lt;math&gt;(\hat O-v)\,\psi_{\hat O,v}=0.&lt;/math&gt; For a system associated with &lt;math&gt;\psi_{\hat O,v},&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;is dispersion-free. Hence the probability of finding that the value of&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt; lies in an interval containing&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;v,&lt;/math&gt; is&amp;nbsp;1. But we have that
:&lt;math&gt;
\hat E\,\psi(q_k)\,e^{-(i/\hbar)E\,t}=E\,\psi(q_k)\,e^{-(i/\hbar)E\,t}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\hat p_j\,\psi(q_{k\neq j},t)\,e^{(i/\hbar)\,p_j\,q_k}=p_j\,\psi(q_{k\neq j},t)\,e^{(i/\hbar)\,p_j\,q_k}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\hat l_z\,\psi(r,\theta,t)\,e^{(i/\hbar)\,l_z\phi}=l_z\,\psi(r,\theta,t) \,e^{(i/\hbar)\,l_z\phi}.
&lt;/math&gt;
So, indeed, &lt;math&gt;\hat l_z&lt;/math&gt; is the operator associated with the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;component of the atom's angular momentum.

Observe that the eigenfunctions of any of these operators are associated with systems for which the corresponding observable is &quot;sharp&quot;: the standard deviation measuring its fuzziness vanishes.

For obvious reasons we also have
:&lt;math&gt;
{\hat l}_x=-i\hbar\left(y{\partial\over\partial z}-z{\partial\over\partial y}\right)\quad
\hbox{and}\quad{\hat l}_y=-i\hbar\left(z{\partial\over\partial x}-x{\partial\over\partial z}\right).
&lt;/math&gt;
If we define the ''commutator'' &lt;math&gt;[{\hat A},{\hat B}]\equiv{\hat A}{\hat B}-{\hat B}{\hat A},&lt;/math&gt; then saying that the operators &lt;math&gt;{\hat A}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{\hat B}&lt;/math&gt; commute is the same as saying that their commutator vanishes. Later we will prove that two observables are ''compatible'' (can be simultaneously measured) if and only if their operators ''commute''.

&lt;br&gt;'''Exercise''': Show that &lt;math&gt;[{\hat l}_x,{\hat l}_y]\,=i\hbar{\hat l}_z.&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;br&gt;One similarly finds that &lt;math&gt;[{\hat l}_y,{\hat l}_z]=i\hbar{\hat l}_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;[{\hat l}_z,{\hat l}_x]=i\hbar{\hat l}_y.&lt;/math&gt; The upshot: different components of a system's angular momentum are ''incompatible''.

&lt;br&gt;'''Exercise''': Using the above commutators, show that the operator &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{L}^2}\equiv{\hat l}_x^2+{\hat l}_y^2+{\hat l}_z^2&lt;/math&gt; commutes with &lt;math&gt;{\hat l}_x,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;{\hat l}_y,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{\hat l}_z.&lt;/math&gt;

Hello {{PAGENAME}}, '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]] to [[Wikibooks]]'''!

{| style=&quot;background:white; border:1px solid #abd5f5;; padding:0px; border-spacing:0px;&quot;
 ! style=&quot;background:#d0e5f5;&quot; | Here are some tips to help you get started
 |-
 | style=&quot;padding:5px;&quot; |
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window that will insert this, too; it looks like part of a signature.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!
 |}

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or ask me personally on my talk page. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add this page to your &quot;watchlist&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

Good luck! 

You might also be interested to read our [[Cookbook:Policy|Cookbook policy]] page and talk to other [[Cookbook talk:Table of Contents|Cookbook editors]]. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 09:59, 10 June 2007 (UTC)</text>

=== Introduction: A Flat New World ===
&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;10%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFF7F7;
border: solid 1px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;[http://cagle.msnbc.com/news/backschool/schoolGIFS3/siersjkh.jpg Cartoon]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

In their collaborative work, Multiliteracies, the New London Group, which was composed of scholars from four different nations, attempts to formulate a pedagogy that will accommodate a rapidly changing world—a world in the process of being radically reshaped by the forces of globalism, multimodalism, and multiculturalism. The first sentence of Chapter 1 reads: &quot;If it were possible to define generally the mission of education, it could be said that its fundamental purpose is to ensure that all students benefit from learning in ways that allow them to participate fully in public, community, and economic life&quot; (New London Group, 2000). As a result of a number of social and economic forces, the old hierarchical systems are gradually crumbling and being replaced by a network of horizontal connections; or, as Friedman has said in his book by this title, &quot;The world is flat&quot; (2005). How, then, can we ensure that our students are competitive in this new flat world? Not surprisingly, just as the old vertical arrangements are collapsing in the economic, and to some extent the political, world, so the outdated hierarchical structures of our educational system are faltering and ultimately failing to prepare our children to participate fully in the social and economic life of our country and the inter-connected global community to which we all belong. The &quot;top-down&quot; reforms of the last twenty years have simply not worked—neither to narrow the achievement gap between higher and lower socioeconomic student populations nor to improve our students' performance in science and math relative to that of students in other nations. Clearly, sweeping reforms are needed to improve student achievement—reforms that will connect our children laterally to a larger world that is freely available to them as a result of new, multimodal technologies. Outdated curricula must give way to content that speaks directly to our students and that they can actively apply to their lives. Ineffective teacher-centered instruction must yield to methods that allow students to take charge of their own learning and generate their own knowledge. These new methods and materials must take into account both the global nature of our economy and the increasing diversity of our student population. As Florin and Hall note, &quot;The world is changing, and so must education&quot; (2007).

=== Globalism and Its Implications for Education Reform ===
The culture of our planet has been evolving and changing dramatically in the past few decades. We haven’t moved toward a single world government or found a universal religion or language to follow, but globalization is taking place. Wikipedia tells us that “Globalization refers to increasing global connectivity, integration and interdependence in the economic, social, technological, cultural, political, and ecological spheres.” Our world is becoming more interconnected on a daily basis. One of the key components of any industrialized nation is its economy. The world economies have had a long history of utilizing (and often exploiting) other nations as their workforce. The shift we are seeing now is a movement away from exploitation toward interdependence. Thomas Friedman (2005) takes the view that the world economies have essentially become a level playing field where any nation may now compete. In his book he describes 10 major events that have served to flatten the global playing field. These so called “flatteners” have been pivotal global events and major surges in technology innovation and availability. Friedman has also coined the Dell Theory of Conflict Prevention. He explains how wars are being prevented because of the interdependence of a global supply chain. Countries like China and Taiwan or India and Pakistan have been able to forgo the use of military action at least in part because of their strong economic interdependences.

Globalization has been a topic of growing interest throughout American media. In the past few years, outsourcing has become a buzzword that has inspired fear and concern for many Americans. Morgan Spurlock, in his television documentary series, &quot;30 Days,&quot; highlighted outsourcing in an episode. The story followed an American who had lost his job due to outsourcing to an Indian company named Tata. He lived with an Indian family where both the husband and wife worked for a call center. The episode showed how life has changed for many Indian citizens and how they have become an integral part of the American economy. Several news organizations have run pieces on globalization and outsourcing. ABC News addressed this issue of outsourcing in a two-part segment in 2006. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwwgXCOEYks&amp;mode=related&amp;search=
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXulLCkDf8Q&amp;mode=related&amp;search=
The segments dealt mainly with modern Indian life and the new revolution that has taken place. They discuss the changes that are allowing a large number of Indian citizens to become trained and become an integral part of the global economy. The segments also highlighted aspects of outsourcing beyond simply call centers. Because of the new flattening, surgeries and even education are now being outsourced. Even shows such as The Simpsons and Conan O’Brien have humorously treated the new global trends. Globalization and the flattening of the world are trends that will have an effect on generations to come. The real question is whether globalization will function primarily as a modified form of exploitation for corporate profit or whether it will result in true economic partnerships that will catapult nations into brighter futures.

Clearly, our current school system is not promoting and fostering the skills future generations will need to become successful in an increasingly competitive job market. Both low- and high-skill jobs are being outsourced to other countries by corporations. Among other things America has been known for its innovations, creativity, and productivity. Our current school reform plan, the No Child Left Behind Act, is essentially stifling our nation's creativity by forcing schools to heavily promote teaching to the test. Tested areas in the educational system are given priority, while areas such as art and drama are often overlooked or even cut from the curriculum. Robert Lynch (2007), in his summary of Arts and Economic Prosperity III, came to the conclusion that in this high-stakes society, funding the arts makes economic sense. Besides being a powerful outlet for creativity and expression, arts and culture are a multi-billion dollar industry. Little is being done in our schools to promote our students' creativity, innovation, or production. How will our children compete with millions of other applicants who have the same or greater skills and can afford to work for far less money? We need to generate a nation of workers with unique and marketable skills. It seems unlikely that meeting the state's minimum requirements will help them to achieve this.

In addition, students need to understand the global implications of environmental issues. Global warming, ozone depletion, disease prevention, and disease containment can not be invesigated without taking on a global perspective. Students do not know geography. Many of the places they talk about, or read about, are abstract in their mind. Indeed there is an increasing divide between children and the natural world. Educators must take the time to refer to geographic locations as they bring up global issues. But they also need to get kids outside. They need to understand the natural world around them in order to appreciate the connection of global warming, ozone depletion, and deforestation to their own lives and immediate surroundings. This must not be limited to geography class. Just as the world is becoming more and more connected and inter-related, so must educational curriculum. By building bridges between disciplines, referring to global issues in all classes, and giving kids opportunities to experience nature, learning connections will be developed as well. How can we expect our students to care about other geographic locations and cultures when they know nothing about them? How can we expect them to be stewards of the environment when they are disconnected from the natural world in their own community?

=== Multimodalism and Its Potential for Instruction Reform ===
''Our students have changed radically. Today's students are no longer the people our educational system was designed to teach '' -- Prensky (2001).

Marc Prensky made this bold statement when he made his case for digital natives and digital immigrants. Essentially, he was saying that individuals who have been raised in the digital age (digital natives) have a different view and, often, ability when it comes to using technology. To digital natives, technology is second nature and generally non-threatening. The internet, cell phones, text messaging, and computer games are part of their daily lives. Digital immigrants, as the term implies, are individuals trying to learn this new technology, and it is often a struggle. Prensky maintains that there is not only a divide in how these digital individuals relate to and interact with modern technology but also a great difference in their learning and thinking processes.

The advent of the computer age has been an enormous global flattener. In order for our students to succeed in this ever-changing world, the way teachers disseminate information must also change. Elizabeth Simpson makes this clear when she discusses the utility that video games can have in the classroom. In her 2005 article about the video game generation, she discusses the great digital divide that can exist in the average classroom between teachers and students. The video game has been a training tool for students whether they realize they are learning from it or not. Games generally deal with a problem and a solution, and in turn they foster problem-solving skills in students. Video games often provide varied outcomes and allow for multiple methods of solving problems. The modern classroom should acknowledge the power of video games and find ways to harness that power beyond using it for simple drill and practice.

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;60%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFF7F7;
border: solid 1px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;&quot;Encouraging students to examine critically their own and others' customs and traditions is a necessary element for an education that enables them to discern what is of value and what ought to be cherished and retained.&quot; (IB, 2007).&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;


=== Multiculturalism and Education Reform ===
Another sign of a flattening world is the diversification of America's population. In addition to the high numbers of other minorities in our schools, the Hispanic population now accounts for over 15 percent of school-age children, just under that of African American students, and this number is expected to increase considerably by the year 2030 (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 2001; Hernandez, 2006). In addition, by 2030 children of families of European origin will make up less than 50 percent of the population of children under the age of five (National Research Council, 1998). Clearly, if over 30 percent of its children are not well educated, America has little chance of competing in a global economy in the years to come. However, despite numerous efforts at school reform from the federal and state levels, including Goals 2000 and No Child Left Behind, the achievement gap between economically disadvantaged minority students and white middle-class students has widened rather than narrowed over the past twenty years (Kozol, 2005; Florin &amp; Hall, 2007; Waks, 2005). Clearly these top-down reforms are not working for this culturally, linguistically, and economically diverse population. If the needs of these students are to be met, educators, administrators, and government officials must adopt a multicultural approach that functions horizontally rather than vertically, democratically rather than hierarchically, and locally rather than nationally. 
Moreover, reforms must take place at all levels: instructional, curricular, and institutional.

At the instructional level, teachers must develop what Richards, Browne, and Ford (2007) call &quot;a culturally responsive pedagogy&quot; (p. 64). A teacher population that is proportionately largely white and middle class must develop a &quot;cultural competence&quot; that allows teachers to understand and effectively instruct students whose values may not only differ from but even clash with their own (Ming &amp; Dukes, 2006, p. 42). The student/teacher relationship is perhaps the greatest influence on student success. Yet, students in teacher education programs receive little to no training and have little, if any, experience interacting with racially and culturally diverse students (Fashola, 2005). America's largely white, middle class teaching force is often ill equipped to take full advantage of students' cultural histories. This is not to suggest that a teacher from the minority culture is better prepared to teach minority students. The quality of the teacher is of greater importance than race; however, the quality of all teachers would be tremendously improved if all teacher education programs included diversity education and methods courses focusing on the infusion of multicultural education into the curriculum. Moreover, teacher education programs must require the completion of practicum experiences at schools with high populations of minority students. Teachers must make an effort to reach out to minority students by developing a deep understanding of the physical conditions and cultural influences that have shaped these students' psyches and lives. In these efforts, teachers should be supported by teacher-training and professional development programs that prepare them to meet their students' widely divergent needs. 

Unfortunately, teachers are more often hindered than helped by an outdated curriculum that requires an English teacher, for example, to teach Charles Dickens's Great Expectations to a class of students with more ties to Africa and Latin America than to England. The English curriculum should be reformed to include multicultural and cross-cultural literature that relates directly to the lives of minority students (Ming &amp; Dukes, 2006). Not only would this practice result in more effective instruction for these students, but it would also enrich and broaden the learning experience of students in the mainstream.

On an institutional level, it is crucial that schools develop and maintain ties with the communities from which these minority students come. Moreover, school counselors and administrators should make a concerted effort to establish contact with the various agencies such as Social Services, public health clinics, and police departments that serve these communities (Epstein, 2005). In short, schools must develop horizontal networks of the kind already prevalent in the economic sphere in order to solve the wide array of problems that arise with a highly diverse student population. Another problem that has arisen in schools with high percentages of minority students is that on average the teachers are less qualified and less effective than their counterparts in predominantly Caucasian schools. This situation exacerbates the ongoing problem of the achievement gap. In order for students at these minority schools to rise up to the achievement level of their Caucasian peers, we need to place qualified and effective teachers in these schools (Haycock &amp; Peske, 2006).

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;60%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFF7F7;
border: solid 1px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;&quot;Educators [must] show a new willingness to experiment with the radically new technological and organizational means, addressing racial and ethnic inequalities not merely in education but across the institutional spectrum, if they hope to make education an effective tool for equal citizenship&quot; (Waks, 2005, p. 128).&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

=== System-wide Reforms ===
Perhaps the most pressing question with respect to education reform is this: How can we expect our children to be academically competitive if their most fundamental physical, emotional, and social needs remain unmet? When considered in this light, the topdown federal and state reforms for promoting academic standards by means of high-stakes testing seem almost laughable. In a 1999 poll, one agency identified three major concerns of the parents of public school students: lack of parental involvement, drug abuse, and lack of discipline; academic achievement never entered the picture (Epstein, 2005). As a result of shifting social, economic, and demographic forces, children no longer receive the kind of support from family and community they once did. By and large, schools have taken over the roles formerly performed by family and community; many schools provide psychological counseling, free meals, driver training, sex education, drug and alcohol awareness programs, and before-school and after-school programs. In short, they function in loco parentis as a result of the vacuum created by divorce, poverty, and crumbling community networks. Because of underfunding and poor policymaking, many schools are not equipped to handle these massive responsibilities, which inevitably devolve upon the shoulders of teachers already overburdened by heavy teaching loads and administrative duties. It is small wonder that the rates of teacher burnout are so high (Esteve, 2000). Moreover when teachers must act as parents, therapists, and babysitters, the quality of education suffers. 

Clearly the current situation calls for sweeping reforms at all levels of school governance. For an overall solution, we can do no better than to turn to economic model of Tom Friedman's flat world (2005). Given the forces of globalism, multimodalism, and multiculturalism, a hierarchical system of school governance can only be outmoded and ineffectual. As has been said earlier, a one-size-fits-all system of tests and standards has no chance of success in the current highly diversified demographic landscape. Given this situation, the federal and state government would do well to dismantle this ineffective system and concentrate their efforts on providing funds so that the schools can handle their problems locally with the help of community service agencies already in place. In their book American schools: The 100 billion dollar challenge (2000), Allen and Cosby propose that the federal government increase its spending by almost 100 percent so that the schools will have the funds they need for school reform; the one hundred billion per year this would require is a small fraction of the more than four hundred billion spent so far just to finance the Iraq War (Iraq War, 2007). 

This increase in funding would allow schools to improve infrastructure, raise teacher salaries, expand technology, and serve the many extracurricular needs of their students. In fact, a number of schools have already become &quot;hybrid institutions that are raising many of our children, not just educating them&quot; (Epstein, 2005, p. J6). Some 3,000 to 5,000 schools act as community centers that are open year round from early morning until 9 P.M. and that provide a full range of academic, health, and crisis-intervention services (p. J6). Several reformers suggest, with considerable justification, that, under the circumstances, our best hope is to make all schools community schools (Allen and Cosby, 2000; Epstein, 2004; Waks, 2005). The problem then becomes &quot;how to manage these hybrid institutions so that both nonacademic and academic programs get a fair shake&quot; (Epstein, 2005, p. J6). Clearly, teachers cannot be expected to take the responsibility for all aspects of their students' (often troubled) lives. These services should come from professionals hired by schools for these particular services and community agencies with appropriate resources already in place. Epstein suggests that because of their power to commandeer local resources, mayors may be the most likely candidates for coordinating these nonacademic services (2005). In any event, the schools need to establish lateral connections within the community to ensure that their students' needs are met. This practice would have the added advantage of breaking through the isolation that often separates and alienates the school from the surrounding community (Horne &amp; Hotchkiss, 2007). As Epstein notes, &quot;The foremost requirement is to ensure that others tend to the many nonacademic responsibilities of the communal child-rearing institutions while school superintendents, principals and teachers concentrate on imparting academic skills. That's the only way we'll have a fighting chance of improving student achievement while also working to improve children's lives&quot; (Epstein, 2005, J6).

Only with such major reforms can we hope to give our students the competitive academic edge they need to compete in a flat world.

== Essay Questions ==

=== Question #1 ===
What can teachers do to promote the curricular and instructional reforms most likely to foster the competencies in students that will empower them to function effectively in a flat world?

'''First Response to Question #1'''

Currently, teachers have very little input into school governance policies made at the federal and state levels. This must change. Teachers should have the power to determine policies that will affect them and their students directly. In the 1920s, university professors joined forces to gain power over their working conditions; as a result they now have considerable influence on almost all aspects of their professional lives, including the power to hire and fire and to speak freely without fear of serious repercussions. Elementary and secondary school teachers must follow their lead. To be effective, teachers must work at all levels to acquire more power over their professions and their lives—in their classrooms, institutions, communities, and the political arena.

Most immediately, teachers must fight for the working conditions that will allow them the time and energy they need to be politically and professionally active. When I recently taught English at a local high school, I was assigned six classes on a block schedule. Since I had three classes in a row on alternate days, I had to teach continuously for four-and-a-half hours. My four honors courses required me to assign and grade extra papers, and my two regular courses had many students with special needs that demanded extra time and attention. I barely had time for the administrative tasks that were piled onto the class preparation and grading I already had. With the very best of intentions, I had no extra time to work for the institutional and political reforms about which I felt so strongly. I voted with my feet by leaving after only a semester, but I couldn't help wondering: If all the teachers in this district had asserted themselves by protesting against this inhuman schedule and set of working conditions, might those in authority have possibly listened and even worked to improve them? This is not the time for teachers to be passive and submissive. We must speak loudly and with one voice to assert our needs and demand the changes necessary to ensure they are met.

Once we have the time and energy to do so, we must become more politically active at all levels, local to national. We must carefully research the positions of and vote for the administrators, legislators, school board members, and mayors most likely to support educational reform and the appropriation of the necessary funds to effect it. Teachers belonging to unions must make full use of their services, and those of us who are unable to unionize must simply unite our efforts and voices with those of other teachers to bring about the changes we need. Technology affords us many ways of communicating and cooperating with each other to reach our common goals; wikis, blogs, email, and listservs are just a few of the means we can use to collaborate with each other and make our wishes known to the public. Whenever possible, we must reach out to the members of our local communities—most immediately through the parents of our students—to make sure they are well informed on the issues and to enlist their help, if possible, in promoting needed reforms.

Within our institutions, we must work for curricular reform so that the materials we use directly speak to the students' interests and real-world needs. For example, given a choice between teaching Swift's Gulliver's Travels and Angelou's I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings to African American inner-city students, the English teacher should not think twice before deciding on the latter. We must work to integrate technology into our teaching and in our students' experience so that they can use it responsibly and effectively to increase their knowledge of academic subjects and of the &quot;real&quot; world. We must promote active, student-centered learning in our classrooms and foster the metacognitive critical thinking skills that will help students to achieve economic and personal success in the rapidly changing world of the twenty-first century. We must reach out to our minority students and engage them in meaningful learning that directly relates to their experience. We must instill a sense of social justice in all our students, helping them to work together to improve their lives and the world around them.

'''Second Response to Question #1'''

Assuming no vast US school reform is on the horizon the challenge of preparing students to be able to compete in this ever flattening working falls squarely on the shoulders of the classroom teacher. I believe that creativity, innovation, exploration, expression, and knowledge are key factors in a person's future success. How many of these traits are our schools designed to foster on a regular basis? On a good day two, three? Teachers are responsible for addressing the state standards and seeing that students perform up to par on state exams. However, the underlying challenge for the teacher really isn't teaching to the test, it's teaching to the student's potential. Educators need to educate the public on what the standardized tests really tell us. For some reason the public seems to lose site of the fact that these tests are minimum competence tests. So what if the scores are going up? Is it good enough to be minimally competent? In addition, teachers must maintain the mind set, in spite of all of the test pressure, that the SOLs are meant to be the floor, not the ceiling of what gets taught in the classroom. Too often educators pass up valuable educational moments because &quot;it's not going to be on the test.&quot;
I have observed first hand teachers choosing which standards to teach and which ones to skip in a calculated gamble to get the most bang for the buck on end of year tests. In one case, teachers collectively chose not to teach third graders multiplication because prior end of year tests only had a couple of such questions on them. This is not the only disturbing part of the story. The same teachers achieved incredible end of year scores, one even got a 100% pass rate. Yes, the students could pass without knowing multiplication. But guess what nightmares the fourth grade teachers inherited when their students had no idea what multiplication was? Does the public see this side of what high stakes tests are doing to the curriculum? There is something inherently wrong with a system that rewards a teacher (high pass rates) for cutting vital content out of instruction time. As an educator, I try to look at each child as my own. What would I want them to get from the experience? Education has to be personal. The teacher has to take the initiative to push the envelope when it comes to what is taught and how it is taught in his/her classroom. In the same way, it is up to the teacher to provide outlets for student's to explore and be creative even if it is within the scope of the state standards. Teachers aren't able to change the state requirements but they still have some freedom in how the material is presented. This means offering open ended questions and scenarios. This often means giving up the reins for a bit to allow for some student driven learning. Present the situations and see what your kids can do. As Ms. Frizzle says: &quot; Take chances, make mistakes, and get messy!&quot; In the classroom you are the captain of the ship so guide it where it needs to go. Just make sure the admiral's on board with what your doing.

=== Question #2 ===

How should classroom teachers successfully interact with students and families that hold cultural values that differ and even conflict with their own?

'''First Response to Question #2'''

Well there's no easy answer to this question but it definitely deserves attention. Certainly in some cases the teacher may have already had some previous cultural experience outside their normal comfort zone. However, let's assume we have a student originally from another country and a teacher who has never left the east coast of the US. Let's even have our student speak English so everythings looking pretty good right? Not necessarily... Some households view education as a top priority, some secondary or even less. In some cases a family may view work (as in jobs) as a top priority so schoolwork or even attending school may not happen. Populations can also be transient which can make for additional challenges. So how are teachers supposed to deal with this? Developing one's &quot;cultural competence&quot; may not come naturally. Perhaps cultural awareness should become a regular part of teacher training. If nothing else a serious effort should be made by the teacher to communicate with the household early on. Opening those lines of communication can be helpful but how do you overcome those cultural barriers? Honestly, I just don't have the answer to this question. I have had a few experiences with this situation but beyond making an effort to communicate with the household and trying to make everyone feel welcome in the classroom; I was at a loss as how to make the students and the parents make education a high priority. One time was my first year and I muddled through but just recently when I saw things weren't working as well as I'd like and I was pursuing some advice/help from other sources the family moved. I'm sure I'm not the only teacher concerned with this issue and my limited knowledge on how to successfully combat it. With the ever changing face of education it is more important than ever to promote cultural awareness.

'''Second Response to Question #2'''

Clearly, the teacher needs to do his/her best to find some common ground with the student and his/her family. Sometimes, of course, this is virtually impossible. For example, if both student and family see education as a means by which they as minority members are oppressed by the powers that be (represented by the teacher), winning them over could be quite hard. Sometimes in these cases, education is seen as &quot;uncool&quot; and resistance to it as a sign of heroic cultural resistance. Fortunately, most parents do value education and do equate it with professional and economic success for their children. This is, for example, especially true of many Asian immigrants, who come from countries where education and educators are held in high esteem. In such cases, the teacher's best bet is simply to convince the parents that he or she has the child's best interests at heart. Of course, it helps for the teacher to try to honor the cultural identity of the family by showing an interest in it. A social studies teacher covering Latin American history might, for example, want to invite the parents of a Hispanic student to the class to talk about their native diet or customs. Of course, it also really helps for the teacher to know something about different cultures. For example, my background in Chinese literature helped me enormously when I taught ESL composition to college freshmen, many of whom were of Asian extraction. Finally, I think it important for the teacher to model an attitude of acceptance and social justice with regard to minority students. He or she should try to impress on all the students in the class how important it is to treat others fairly and respectfully regardless of gender, race, or socioeconmic status.

==Wikibook on .NET Application development foundation==

Hi Ravichandar,

I've been working on [[Microsoft_Certified_Technology_Specialist/Exam_70-536]] recently and I saw that you are interested in .NET while doing some research for other .NET resources on Wikibooks.

If you have a few minutes, could you take a look at the [[Microsoft_Certified_Technology_Specialist/Exam_70-536]] and tell me if there are major errors or if you see ways of improving to book's organization.

Thanks in advance, Regards, --&amp;nbsp;[[User:Jacques Bergeron|Jacques]]&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Jacques_Bergeron|talk]])&amp;nbsp;([[Special:Emailuser/Jacques Bergeron|email]]) 17:37, 10 December 2007 (UTC)

== [[.NET Framework 3.0]] ==

I'm glad you like the template, it's just a basic design so there is lots of room for improvement if you are interested. I'm not certain that this book is ready to be featured, and I'll tell you why: all the pages are very short and there are too few code examples. What's here serves as a brief summary of the topics, but doesn't really get in-depth to any practical level. As it stands now, it's more like an &quot;introduction to the terminology of .NET 3.0&quot;, because it explains what some of the words are terms are, but doesn't explain how to implement them. 

I think the book is off to a good start, but I feel like it really could be expanded in a number of areas. I would like to see more code examples, more text and explanations, more information in general. 

If it's not your intent for this book to be large and comprehensive, maybe the title needs to be changed to reflect the fact that it's basically a short primer and not a &quot;complete textbook&quot; in the ordinary sense. &quot;Introduction to .NET 3.0&quot; or &quot;.NET Framework 3.0 Primer&quot; might be options worth considering. However, even with a change of title, I worry that there still isn't enough content, and people are going to vote against featuring it because of that. 

To a certain degree I can help with the expansion when I have some time, but this isn't an area of expertise for me. Let me know what your plans are. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 13:34, 24 January 2008 (UTC)

You &quot;closed&quot; [[Wikibooks:Votes_for_deletion#Brazilian_History|this VfD]] as delete.  In practice VfDs stay open for a minimum of 7 days.  As 7 days are now up maybe &quot;reclose&quot; the VfD now (allowiing it to have been open in a sense for 7 days)?  Equally you can then re-instate the &quot;impending doom&quot; tag.  I think you have to realise that the policy is there for a reason - if you had created something &amp; were not a daily visitor to en wb then you might well be concerned to find that your offering had been deleted without you having a chance to voice an opinion.

I had tagged the page as &lt;query&gt; the tag has been removed by another editor (not the original creator of the page), the requirements were not met (no clear scope or idea on what way the book should evolve was added, the information present is very general). There must be another book were the minor content present could be added to (I noticed you post on the talk page), if the book stalls in this situation the probable outcome will be a VFD vote...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 02:36, 11 October 2008 (UTC)
:I have been patrolling and fixing a lot of related issues, but not from the same editor, posting information or making a fuss about it will probably not resolve the issue if it continues probably sticking a note in higher evidence in the toc will be the only recourse. I haven't examined every possibilities on why it is happening, I fixes some empty links on the toc to bad locations (outside the book scope) but new new pages have continued to appear outside...

My only request before you get +patroller would be that you welcome users and explain to them any problems you see with their work &amp; help them along. In a few instances, you've tagged stuff {{tlx|delete}} but the user still hadn't been welcomed, and you didn't explain your actions to them either. As long as that sort of communication is consistent, I think you'll do a good job. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:30, 17 October 2008 (UTC)

== Adding sources ==
Myself as a author, I avoid making reference to sources and only do if the concept can't be explained in full on the book I'm working into or it isn't covered by the scope, everything else if there is a need to mention demonstrations or piratical applications goes in a special section at the end of the book (adding footnotes doesn't work very well in multipage books anyway). This should be a requests not a demand nor is it an obligation by the contributor (regarding a post of further info I saw by you, if we push new contributors to strongly they will faster quit than address or learn how to cope with requirements).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 05:25, 23 October 2008 (UTC)

:: Firstly, I strongly feel that there should be references or at least some external links in order to establish that &quot;it is a concept&quot;. Well, if there is no reference, it could very well be original research. As for the content, yeah, I agree with you. The author provides his own work after all. But I feel that the author should provide some reference or link on the topic.-&lt;font color=&quot;maroon&quot; size=&quot;4&quot; face=&quot;Monotype Corsiva&quot;&gt;[[User:Ravichandar84|Ravichandar]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;aqua&quot; face=&quot;Monotype Corsiva&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Ravichandar84|My coffee shop]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; 05:41, 23 October 2008 (UTC)

:::Yup, what I was attempting to state here is that we shouldn't demand (even if you feel that it should be added, request it, you can even work out a proposal to make it a requirement if you feel it is indispensable), there is no policy or guideline at the moment that puts that obligation upon the contributor. Especially with new users we must take care on the wording and requirements we use, even in minor vandalism we should attempt to apply something on the lines of [[Wikibooks:Assume good faith]], to educate and avoid alienating people, even with the best intentions this is a very difficult task and time consuming.
:::As for the requirement of sources, they can be useful and important on particular situations but if the topic is well known and non controversial the importance is not that great (besides those specific points I gave on the other post), consider the  recent NPOV violation I made to [[South Ossetia War]], you can even find sources that contradict themselves and books can cover topics that don't have any sources but aren't original work...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 05:57, 23 October 2008 (UTC)
:::I've never contributed to Wikipedia (when I think something is missing/bad I use the talk page there) but this is probably one of those things that are diferent. [[Help:Wikibooks for Wikimedians]] ''&quot;As a general rule, Wikibooks modules don't contain as many links as Wikipedia articles. This is because a book is supposed to be a self-contained resource with a contiguous narrative. Links to all sorts of outside places can, furthermore, serve as a distraction. Links to other resources should usually be placed in a separate resources or bibliography section at the end of the book or module.&quot;'', I share this view but try to add a link to the wikipedia article when first introducing a concept, new keyword, etc...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 06:03, 23 October 2008 (UTC)
:::: Well, I didn't feel as  if I was being too harsh. Indeed, I feel that we need atleast one or two references to check if the subject of the book is not a complete hoax or [[WB:OR|original research]]. Else, we might end up having something like [[Lo Langesi]]. As for your concerns about sourcing in Wikipedia, yeah, those kind of policies do exist in Wikipedia. And I do follow them in Wikipedia. However, I haven't created any such sort of content in Wikibooks with links (both internal and external) or inline citations. In fact, you will observe from my book on [[Iranian History]] that I've created a separate [[Iranian History/Contents/Bibliography/|bibliography page]] with the required references for each chapter and provided links from that particular chapter in the book.-&lt;font color=&quot;maroon&quot; size=&quot;4&quot; face=&quot;Monotype Corsiva&quot;&gt;[[User:Ravichandar84|Ravichandar]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;aqua&quot; face=&quot;Monotype Corsiva&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Ravichandar84|My coffee shop]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; 18:39, 23 October 2008 (UTC)
*reset
I had seen some pages of the [[Iranian History]] project but only now taken the full picture of the work, great work.&lt;br&gt;
Yup the  use of a Bibliography is important especially when dealing with historical events but consider a math book if they aren't covering something new or extremely complex (that the description they include doesn't suffice to illustrate it) adding sources is difficult, this goes for some technical books also if not rewriting something that has been said before...&lt;br&gt;
As for the wording I was referring also to the time line and tone. If we place ourselves on the skin of the contributor we can imagine something like this:&lt;r&gt;
- I just made my first contribution. Heck this is like Wikipedia.&lt;br&gt;
- I got a tag on my the page, darn. It states the I probably made it as resulting from an error or on the wrong place, the dude even posted something commenting on my work on the talk page. Fantastic, everyone is a critic.&lt;br&gt;
- Ho it was was fallowed by another post asking for sources stating that my writing is confusing, jeez, why do I bother, I'm probably a very bad writer.&lt;br&gt;
- Ho finally someone placed the welcome information, I was looking for (this site is very confusing), let's see what I did wrong.&lt;br&gt;
- Darn another post asking for sources, I quit...&lt;br&gt;
This can be a probable outcome if we consider the timing of our simultaneous interventions and the tone we used. Highlighting the negative aspects without balance with positives can be depressing to one that is contributing time and work freely.&lt;br&gt;
If we look [[Talk:Three Domains of Life]] (I've got a reply) my comments even if asking for action aren't negative and propose solutions or alternatives, that was all I was attempting to say (this not always works and I've had my dose of problems and been misunderstood often).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 19:10, 23 October 2008 (UTC)

== seven days ==

Dear Ravichandar84,

Thank you for making many excellent improvements to Wikibooks.

Allow me to point out a (perhaps new?) Wikibooks policy:

The current Wikibooks policy says that we must wait until a new Wikibook &quot;has existed on the system for more than one week ... give the Wikibook some time to develop before the VfD discussion even takes place&quot; before slapping the {{tlx|vfd}} on it. See [[WB:DP#Votes_for_deletion]].

A bit annoying that I can't slap that on there as soon as I see it, since in a week I'll probably have forgotten all about it.

But you know. ''It's policy''.

{| style=&quot;background:white; border:1px solid #abd5f5;; padding:0px; border-spacing:0px;&quot;
 ! style=&quot;background:#d0e5f5;&quot; | Here are some tips to help you get started
 |-
 | style=&quot;padding:5px;&quot; |
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window that will insert this, too; it looks like part of a signature.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

The California Open Source Textbook Project (COSTP), founded by Sanford Forte, began as a private/public undertaking promote use of [http://www.cde.ca.gov/be/st/ss/documents/histsocscistnd.pdf California State K-12 Standards] to develop printed and eBook versions of open source textbooks that will be approved for adoption by California's State Board of Education for use in California public schools at far less cost than current commercial textbook offerings - thus helping the State of California save money ($200M+ per year) while providing more robust content for its public schools. 

The COSTP World History Project on Wikibooks is a placeholder pilot that helped prove Open-licensed textbooks as a viable concept in K-12 education. The COSTP World History Project proved successful in helping California education officials understand the value of the open source content approach applied to K-12 textbooks. 

At this point in time, (October, 2010) the World History Project takes on the role of &quot;historical document&quot;, in that as a very early promotional tool - even in an incomplete state - it succeeded in helping educators and policy makers understand how a textbook could be collaboratively built on the web, by collaborators - in a way that would gain acceptance by educators and policy makers. 

Please note: Wikibooks hosts [[World_History|another textbook on World History]] based on Advanced Placement Standards for World History. Although a worthy project in its own right, the AP World History project is not related to the California Open Source Textbook Project (COSTP). COSTP is dedicated to writing content that strictly adheres to the California State Education framework for K-12 content in all disciplines - in this case, World History. 

In order for open source books to pass peer review (and thus approval for public school adoption) at the California State Board level (this is also true in most other states), textbook content *must* conform to the written state K-12 education framework standard - this is a sine qua non for adoption, no exceptions are made. California's State Board of Education would thus *not* approve the above AP World History project for general adoption because it does not conform to California's K-12 World History standard. This is an important distinction between the two projects. Private institutions, some state education bureaucracies, and independent learners might want to choose the AP World History course for their own specific purposes, but adoption by California public schools for widespread baseline World History K-12 education would not be permitted or considered for the reasons stated.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The excretory system is how our bodies get rid of things they don't need. This is called waste. The urinary system is a part of this, but there are also other organs that help our bodies get rid of waste.

__TOC__

==What does the excretory system look like? (Appearance)==

[[Image:Illu_urinary_system.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Urinary system]]

The largest organs in the excretory system are the '''kidneys'''. There are 2 of them. They are shaped like large reddish brown beans. They are about the size of a fist and are located on each side of your back. 

Running from the kidneys to the bladder are two long skinny tubes called '''ureters'''.

The '''bladder''' is a hollow organ that holds urine. It can stretch to hold more liquid. There is another tube called the '''urethra''' that carries urine out of the body.

==What are the parts of the excretory system? (Parts)==

There are several parts of the excretory system. To get rid of liquid waste in our bodies, we have two kidneys, two ureters, a bladder, and a urethra. 

Kidneys filter our blood to get rid of things if our blood that are not needed. If we didn’t have kidneys, we would eventually be poisoned by this waste. The kidneys are full of millions of microscopic things called '''nephrons'''. They filter the blood and produce urine. Urine is the liquid that leaves your body when you go to the bathroom.

The urine travels down two tubes called ureters to get to the bladder. The bladder is where '''urine''' is stored until you go to the bathroom. The last tube the urine goes through to leave the body is called the urethra.

Solid wastes leave the body through the '''rectum''', as described in the section on the [[Wikijunior:Human_Body/DigestiveSystem| digestive system]]. The lungs are also a part of the excretory system. They get rid of the carbon dioxide that our bodies don’t need. This happens when we breathe out, as is described in the section on the respiratory system.

One other part of the excretory system is our '''sweat glands'''. The purpose of sweat glands is to keep our bodies cool and also to get rid of wastes, including salts that our body doesn’t need. Sweat glands are in your skin, and there are over 2 million of them in each person!

==What is the function of the excretory system? (Function)==
There are some things in our body that can’t be used and may even be dangerous to your body. They need to be gotten rid of. The job of the excretory system is to get rid of that waste.

==How does the excretory system interact with other parts of the body? (Interactions With Other Body Parts)==
All of our blood runs through our kidneys every day. There is an artery and a vein that runs in and out of each kidney to take the blood there and back.

Solid waste is filtered out by the digestive system. 

Without the excretory system, the other parts of the body would eventually be poisoned by waste.

==How can you keep your excretory system healthy? (Health)==

Make sure to eat healthy foods and drink plenty of water. If you have any pain when you go to the bathroom, make sure to tell someone, so they can see if something is wrong.

If you have diarrhea or sweat too much, your body may lose too much fluids and salts. Make sure to drink lots of water to replenish your body. You may also need to drink a sports drink.

      <text xml:space="preserve">: ''See also:'' [[Authoring Foreign Language Textbooks]]

The Korean Wikibook has two major divisions:
* Reading, writing, and pronunciation
* Conversation

==Reading, writing, and pronunciation==
The '''Reading, writing, and pronunciation''' series teaches hangeul, the Korean writing system. The student is assumed to have no previous knowledge of Korean.
* [[Korean/Alphabet]]: a brief overview of Hangeul
* [[Korean/RWP]]: '''Read, Write, Pronounce Korean''' is a course teaching Hangeul.
*: See: [[Korean/Writing lessons plan]].
*: Includes: jamo stroke order, composition, basic pronunciation; jamo in English cognates; reading, writing.
*: Deliberately excludes vocabulary and grammar.
*: Basic phonology is only exposed incidentally.
* [[Korean/Principles of Orthography]]:  writing jamo, composing syllables (initials; horizontal, vertical, wrapping medials; finals)
*: '''needs to include other principals, e.g. palatization of consonants before 이, 여, 야, etc.
* [[Korean/Essential Pronunciation Rules]]: plain, aspirated, tense; ㄹ; initial, medial, final; ㅇ; final-initial ㄴㄹ, ㄹㄹ; t-stops
*: '''needs to include palatization and other essential topics'''
* [[Korean/Advanced Pronunciation Rules]]: phonology of final-initial combinations
*: '''needs much more'''

==Conversation==
The conversation series teaches Korean vocabulary and grammar.  The student is expected to know how to read, write, and pronounce Korean before beginning this series.

This series has the following goals:
* The series should be easy for the target student.
* The series should teach essential vocabulary and grammar.
* The series should introduce important aspects of modern Korean culture.

The target student is assumed to have the following characteristics:
* Upon beginning the Level I (beginner) series of conversation lessons, the student already knows hangeul but presumably nothing else about the Korean language or culture.
* Upon beginning the subsequent series, the student is assumed to know the content of the previous series but not necessarily anything else about the Korean language.
* The student may have no access to Korean reference material other than the Wiktionary entries directly linked from the lessons.
* The student may have no access to a teacher of Korean or to any native Korean speakers.

===Structure===
The conversation series are structured as follows:
* [[Korean/Lesson I1|Level I: Beginner]]
*# [[Korean/Lesson I1|Basic Korean sentence structure, basic vocabulary, and greetings]]
*# [[Korean/Lesson I2|Particles, present progressive, future tense, requests]]
* [[Korean/Lesson II1|Level II: High beginner]]
* [[Korean/Lesson III1|Level III: Low intermediate]]
* [[Korean/Lesson IV1|Level IV: High intermediate]]
* [[Korean/Lesson V1|Level V: Low advanced]]
* [[Korean/Lesson VI1|Level VI: Advanced]]

===Grammar topics===
The following grammar topics are arranged according to intended sequence of introduction:
* Basic Korean sentence structure
* Verb stems
* Honorifics (시, 으시)
* Present indicative 합쇼체 (ㅂ니다/습니다): [[Korean/Lesson I1]]
* Topic particle (는/은): [[Korean/Lesson I1]]
* Present interrogative 합쇼체 (ㅂ니까/습니까): [[Korean/Lesson I1]]
* Noun honorific suffix: ([[wikt:님|-님]])
* Special honorific nouns
* Particles
* 에 (locative particle): currently in [[Korean/Lesson I1]], but probably should move to a later lesson
* 에게 (dative particle): currently in [[Korean/Lesson I1]], but probably should move to a later lesson
* 에서 (from, at, location of action particle): [[Korean/Lesson I2]]
* 로/으로 (toward): [[Korean/Lesson I2]]
* 를/을 (direct object particle): [[Korean/Lesson I2]]
* 이다 and 있다
* 해요체 and 해체 speech levels
* 겠다 (future tense): currently in [[Korean/Lesson I2]], but probably should move to a later lesson
* 고 있다 (present progressive): Currently in [[Korean/Lesson I2]], but it should probably move to a latter lesson.
* Imperative 합쇼체
* Hortative (proposative)
* Past 합쇼체
* 하다 and -하다 compounds
* -고
* -지 ([[wikt:덥다|덥지]] 않아요, 어렵지 않아요)
* -니
* other clausal/combining forms
* Other tenses (remote past, past future, remote past future) and moods (cohortative)
* Counters?
* Optional plural marker (들)
* ㅂ-&gt;우 (verb stem change before vowel)
*: E.g.: [[wikt:귀엽다|귀엽다]] (귀여워요), [[wikt:덥다|덥다]]
*: Exceptions: [[wikt:뽑다|뽑다]] (뽑아요), [[wikt:집다|집다]] (집어요)

Before this course plan was created, a separate '''grammar''' series took a rules-based approach to teaching Korean.  The following legacy grammar topics should be incorporated into the main the conversation series:
*[[Korean/Verbs]] ([[Talk:Korean/Verbs]])
** Speech levels: To ensure that learners who quit early walk away with the most useful polite speech levels, the verbs lesson teaches the speech levels [[wikt:합쇼체|합쇼체]] and [[wikt:해요체|해요체]] in that order.
*[[Korean/Nouns]] ([[Talk:Korean/Nouns]])
*[[Korean/Particles]]
*[[Korean/Personal pronouns]] ([[Talk:Korean/Personal pronouns]])
** casual and polite/humble equivalents
** avoidance of second person singular pronoun
** substitutes for second/third person pronouns
** contractions with particles
*[[Korean/Demonstrative pronouns]]
*[[Korean/Adjectives]]
*[[Korean/Determiners]]
*[[Korean/Conjunctions]]
*[[Korean/Comparatives and superlatives]]
*[[Korean/Questions]]
*[[Korean/Commands]]
*[[Korean/Dates and times]]

===Glossary index===
To help ensure that lessons build only on material already taught, [[Korean/Conversation lessons plan/Glossary]] lists each vocabulary word along with the lesson where it is first introduced.

This guide was written several months ago, based on my official training for becoming a member of a local draft board.  As I am an active member of the board, this is being released anonymously.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Background'''

A concern in times like these shared among many is the reinstatement of the draft.  The general Selective Service draft could draft, in normal active operation, men between the ages of 18 and 25, starting at age 20 (up to 25, then down to 18).  An additional healthcare draft could draft healthcare workers into military service from ages 20 to 44 normally, possibly up to 55.  While both drafts currently only apply to men, if reinstated, the healthcare draft would very likely include women due to the major role women now play in the modern healthcare industry.  Congressional action has the potential to also modify the general draft to select women as well.

Many people, due to varying reasons of conviction, would find their participation in a particular military action, or any military action, to be immoral, yet have registered with the Selective Service System.  Conscientious objection has long been recognized by the government, but seldom respected.  Conscientious objectors have been ostracized, fined, jailed, pressed into service, denied any clothing in response to refusal to wear a uniform, and even used as human guinea pigs for alternative service (WWII).  While the system has slowly become more tolerant, the burden of evidence and standards for conscientious objection are still extremely high.  Hardship deferments are not treated as harshly, but the standards tend to still be quite strict.  Various other types of claims can be made as well, from essentiality of occupation to ministerial deferments.

Yet, the problem often doesn't lie within the standards.  The fact is that many of the people on draft boards are old, retired career military individuals who simply don't like the concept of conscientious objection or other deferments.  Many feel that military life is something that everyone would appreciate once exposed to it, and that it is disloyal to refuse to serve your country if your country calls you.  In my Selective Service board training, one member declared during a role-playing session that the fictional CO, despite his sincerity, should have his claim denied: &quot;basic training would straighten him out&quot; and he'd be &quot;happy to serve after that&quot;; all he needed was a good &quot;indoctrination&quot;.  Four out of five people on one team denied CO status to the aforementioned character after acknowledging that the registrant met the CO guidelines (sincerity, opposition to all wars, morally/ethically grounded, etc).  Why?  The registrant was &quot;a good shot, and he would be an important addition to the army&quot;. 
These sorts of arguments are, quite obviously, completely against the guidelines.  That doesn't change the fact that these people now serve on local boards.

You may be told a lot of things by people if you receive a draft notice.  You may be told, for example, that they won't make you serve in a combat role if you oppose such an assignment.  Don't believe it.  The only way to ensure that you're in a noncombat role while serving in the military is to be classified as 1-A-O status, which means an appeal to the draft board.  A friend of mine lost a close, pacifist friend in the Vietnam War who fell for precisely this lie.  He was shot and killed in combat carrying a weapon that he refused to load.  Despite his explicit requests not to be buried in a military uniform, he was buried in one.  It took a protest on the part of the pallbearers not to have his coffin buried with an American Flag on it.  No matter what
your reason for wanting to avoid the draft, the time to act is when you receive your notice or sooner.  Don't leave your fate to chance.

If you truly object to service, getting past your local draft board is not something that should be taken lightly.  This guide is designed to show you, the registrant, how to stand the best possible odds of your claim making it past review.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Meeting Structure'''

Regardless of the grounds on which you appeal your draft notice, the procedure will be roughly the same.  Your order will be to report for a physical, mental, and moral evaluation; after you recieve the results, you will have only ten days to file a claim for exemption, postponement, or deferment.  When your claim is processed, the local board will be alerted and will work you into their schedule -- probably in a matter of days to weeks, depending on their workload.  When you are met, or any of your witnesses are met, there will be something along the lines of this:

* Introduction/Welcome/This is an informal hearing.
* Photographic/sound equipment/verbatim transcripts prohibited; however, registrant may take notes during hearing
* If hearing is open to the public (as per your request), the chair may limit the number of people in the room and may close the hearing if the people become disruptive.
* May have up to three witnesses
* May not be represented by a lawyer,  but may have an advisor.  The advisor may have discussions with the registrant, but may NOT take an active part in the hearing, nor interfere with the proceedings.
* May have interpreter, if necessary may present evidence not contained in the file
* False statements subject to imprisonment of up to 5 years or fine of up to $250,000, or both.

On closing of the meeting, you will be told something along the lines of this:

* Thank registrant/witness/interpreter/advisor
* Decision will be made by board members present
* Decision will be based on oral testimony and information in file
* Registrant classified in lowest class for which eligible
* Registrant will receive notice of classification identifying claim considered, which will notify him whether claim is granted or denied and, if denied, the reason for denial.
* The notice of classification will inform registrant of appeal rights and procedures.
* Registrant may file written summary of testimony within 5 calendar days from date of hearing
* CO claims only: If classified 1-0 (not available for combat or non-combat military service) and found qualified for service, will receive order to perform alternative service and required to serve 24 months.  If classified 1-A-O (available for non-combat military service only), will receive induction reporting date for noncombatant service in the armed forces.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''General Strategies'''

The meeting is not a trial.  If you become combative, you will likely be reminded of this.  Whatever the biases of the board members, they only want a smooth meeting with which to assess you.  What they would like is more akin to the meeting of a psychiatrist with a patient.  Your advisor, if you choose to have one, is not taking the role of a lawyer.  They can only talk to you.  If they talk to the board, they will be out of order, and may end up kicked out.

I would strongly advise against having an advisor, except for possibly a ministerial deferment.  Especially in CO cases, the board needs to assess your sincerity.  Whispering back and forth with an advisor is a perfect way to make you look insincere.  Equally insincere in appearance is reading from a script, or sounding like you're reciting a memorized script.  Relax.  Know what you plan to say, but try to have a calm, peaceable conversation.

If you absolutely feel that you must bring an advisor, consider having a lawyer as the advisor (this is allowed).  Lawyers are intimidating.  The lawyer could just sit there silently and still have an effect.  Board members are just laypeople, volunteers.  We want lawsuits (even meritless ones) about as much as we want our teeth drilled.  This came up as a concern by several board members during training.  If you are going for a claim in which sincerity is key, however, I would recommend against any advisor for the aforementioned reasons.

Practice with your witnesses.  Your witness may undercut your argument if they say something dumb.  Have them read this guide.  Use written documentation wherever appropriate.  It must be signed to be considered.  No matter how important a piece of documentation would be for us, if it's not signed, we cannot use it.  Try to supply, as documentation, anything you can think of, just in case the board needs it.  The local board cannot re-hear your case again later if you forget to provide something; they'll just weigh the evidence without it.

Know your board.  Who is on it is a matter of public record.  If you can't find them elsewhere, contact the Selective Service at www.sss.gov; as of the time of writing, the phone number is 1-703-605-4100.  You can google search the board members' names to see if you can get any clues to how they stand on the issues.  A bad sign is a retired ex-military person.  A good sign is a young person with involvement in antiwar groups.  The best information would be arrived at talking with a local board member or someone who has gone before them.  Talking with a board member does not give that board member a conflict of interest -- although, if they're not supportive, you may be hurting your chances if you come across as trying to cheat the system.  Conflicts of interest for board members generally only apply to close relatives, coworkers and employers/employees, not friends and neighbors.  If evidence suggests that the board is disinclined to approve a certain type of claim, consider filing a different type.  

If you have not been drafted yet, consider moving to an area with a friendly board.  As a trainer stated at our meeting, &quot;I have a number of boards who I could rely on to deny almost every CO claim that comes before them.  I also have some who consistently approve almost every CO claim.&quot;  Remember: you only need to have your claim approved once.  You can appeal the decision of your local board to the regional or even national board, but the government will never appeal a decision that was made in your favor.  A local board's decision in your favor is final.

Pick a proper claim.  You can pick multiple claims -- however, there are a few caveats.  You will ultimately only be classified under one status.  The board will have to hear each claim separately.  This may sound like two claims doubles your chances, but there are downsides.  For one, you're holding up the board from reviewing other registrants, which may or may not predispose members against you, depending on their personalities and schedules.  Secondly, filing under multiple claims has the possibility of making you seem insincere about your claims.  The board knows that someone may file under multiple claims for precisely the reason that you would be tempted to do it -- to double your odds.  Whether or not to do this should be left up to you and your particular situation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Claim #1: Conscientious Objector (1-A-O, 1-O)'''

There are two conscientious objector categories.  1-A-O means that you refuse to serve in a combat role, but will serve the military in a noncombat role.  If you file for this and are approved, expect to be placed in the military.  Note that in the modern military, the roles between combat and noncombat roles have been somewhat blurred; even a trucker in Iraq gets shot at, and bases get incoming mortars.  1-O means that you object to all forms of military service.  This does not mean that if you are approved that you get to sit around at home all day; rather, you are assigned to twenty-four months of &quot;alternative service&quot;.  This is designed to be service that will help the government out as much as possible without violating your moral beliefs.  If it does, you can appeal your assignment -- hence, as much as they'd like to assign you to a munitions plant, they know it would be a waste of their time because you'd just appeal.  The classic example of alternative service from ages past is forestry service.

CO status may well be the hardest status to get.  However, there is one advantage: it is permanent.     

The key issue for CO status that you must convince the board of your sincerity.  This cannot be overstressed.  The board must truly believe that you are sincere in your strong, long-held beliefs.  The reason for your belief does not need to be religious, as it used to.  Ethical or moral beliefs that are strongly held are also admittable.  The registrant must be opposed to all wars.  Not just some, not just the current war.  All wars.  The board officially cannot ask you about hypothetical wars or future situations (that doesn't mean that they won't, though; don't complain if they do).  But if they ask you (for example) would you have fought in World War II, the answer must be no (preferably with convincing, sincere elaboration).  You can support the right to self-defense, but not at a national level (a person who subscribes to St. Augustine's &quot;just war&quot; doctrine does not qualify for CO status).  The cutoff point is the community level.  Your behavior must match your stated beliefs.

Another major issue will be the length of time that you have held these beliefs.  If you developed these beliefs recently, you will likely cause serious doubt as to how deepheld your CO beliefs are.  At least a year should be a standard, and many years is highly recommended.  Documentation of past beliefs is very valuable.  Witnesses can be especially valuable in a CO case, as they can attest to knowing about your beliefs for a long period of time.  It is in your best interests to bring three witnesses who will sincerely vouch for you.

Because this category is so subjective, your odds are highly dependent on who your board is.  If your board hates COs, they may deny your claim even if you make a flawless case.  A friendly board (while somewhat rarer, they certainly do exist) may approve even a sloppy CO case.  But you might as well give yourself the best odds you can.  Don't be stupid.  Don't say, for example, that you've studied MLK and Gandhi when you haven't.  The board may ask you some basic questions about them, and if you can't answer those, you've been caught lying.  Which means that you have no sincerity, which means that your odds of being denied are quite high.

Summary: Having a non-hostile board and coming across as sincere are the most important elements.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Claim #2: Hardship (3-A)'''

A hardship claim means that there's one or more people out there who will be seriously adversely affected by you being drafted.  Who?  Almost anyone.  Wife, child, parent, grandparent, and sibling are the official categories, but it can be applied to others (a sample case involves a niece and nephew). The support can include financial assistance, personal care, and companionship.  Pretty broad, so you have lots of wiggle room there, so long as there are serious adverse effects: &quot;more than the usual and customary grief and problems caused by the absence of a loved one&quot;.  Furthermore, there cannot be a reasonable solution to the problem -- a workaround that remedies the situation should you be drafted.  Being the lone care provider for someone who cannot take care of themselves, with no other friends or relatives who could do the job and no money to pay for care, is a good example.

This claim is less subjective than CO, but still highly subjective.  Witnesses can be very important here.  Boards are somewhat less likely to be inherently hostile to a hardship claim than to a CO, but it won't help with the people who think that their job is to send as many people on to the military as possible.  Written documentation can be critical to prove the claims that you're making; your word alone is unlikely to be good enough.  Don't lie.

Summary: Having a non-hostile board is important, but sincerity and good documentation are critical.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Claim #3: Divinity Student (2-D) or Minister (4-D)'''

These claims are almost unfairly easy to land ... if you have the qualifications.  They tend to be &quot;just the facts&quot;; reviews, so the particular board isn't as important as it is with prior claims.  

For a divinity student, you must prove that you are preparing for the ministry under direction of a recognized church or religious organization, making satisfactory progress, and working towards this full time.  The school must be a recognized theological or divinity school.  The church must have an organized structure, congregations chapters or groups, scheduled services/meetings, liturgical materials, shared beliefs, and a governing body.  About the only personal judgment the board would likely weigh is how long you've been in the school (more than one semester is probably good enough).  The length of the exemption is 12 months or less.  You can then reapply for another deferment.

For a minister, you must be recognized by your church as a minister of religion, the church must be established as a community of faith and belief, doctrines, and practices.  Ministering must be your primary occupation.  The only kind of judging that may come into play here is if you're part of a religion where &quot;everyone&quot; is a minister, such as the Jehovah's Witnesses, or if the church you claim to be a minister for is itself iffy.  There is no expiration date for this claim.

I'll again stress that there is very little judging here apart from the facts of the case (so have everything documented and signed!).  Witnesses aren't very important compared to prior claims, but are unlikely to hurt.  You could come in looking high and have a criminal record, but if your papers are in order, it would be very hard for the board to deny your claim.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Claim #4: Essentiality of Occupation (2-AM)'''

This applies only to people who work in the healthcare industry.  Curiously enough, neither in our training literature nor the lectures was a &quot;length of time in the field&quot; consideration listed, which would make this seem to be a good fields to get into late in the game for a deference, like ministerial school.  However, that doesn't mean that a board won't weigh the job change.  Also, note that healthcare workers may be in double jeopardy for being drafted, as both the general and healthcare draft lotteries could select them (whichever lottery selects them first gets them).  So, it's a double-edged sword.  Ministerial school is probably a safer bet.

You not only must be working in the healthcare industry, but you must be filling a critical national or community healthcare need.  This can be the practice of medicine, health research, teaching health care professionals, or being engaged in the delivery of other direct health care services.  You must be unable to be replaced within the forseeable future because of a shortage of other persons with the same qualifications and skills.  Removal of you for your position would have to cause a lengthy loss of effectiveness in health care activity, esp. in the community.  For community needs essentiality, you must be currently practicing in the community in question or be contracted to serve there in the future, in a way that the breaking of the contract would lead to the reduction or elimination of the service (only concerning a contract signed at least six months before the date of the induction order and with a start date not later than 90 days after the induction date).

Note that not only can direct health care providers get this exemption, as mentioned, but also teachers and researchers.  They must demonstrate that removal of them from their positions would cause a long term shortage or elimination of critical health care teaching or research services.  From the board's perspective, they're going to be looking for people who, if removed from their jobs, their community or the nation will be clearly harmed more than it supposedly benefits from having the citizens serving in the military.

A good example of an essentiality claim is a doctor who is one of the few health practitioners on a remote island.  Technically, however, it could apply to people as diverse as a teacher in a medical school or a person writing software for medical research, so long as they can demonstrate how important their work is to the future of local and/or national healthcare.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Other Deferments Or &quot;Options&quot;'''

''4-B'': Official Deferred by Law.  Odds are, this doesn't apply to you.  It applies to the people who made the policy decisions that are trying to send you to war, though.

''4-G'': Exempt from Service Because of Death of Parent or Sibling while Serving in the Armed Forces or Whose Parent or Sibling is in a Captured or Missing in Action Status.  In short, they don't want to deprive a single family of many members.

''4-F'': Not Acceptable for Military Service.  You've failed the military's physical, mental, or moral fitness requirements. See Richard Feynman's autobiography, or &quot;Alice's Restaurant.&quot;

''Student'': Non-divinity students cannot get the nice deferments that they used to be able to.  The student deferments were a source of resentment among the poor and working class during the Vietnam War, as they saw it as a way that the rich could pay their way out of going to war.  Presently, students are allowed to finish up their semester or, if they are in their senior year, their academic year.  After that, they are activated.

''Running to Canada'': While this worked in Vietnam, Canada is not guaranteed to be a safe haven unless there is government backing for such a policy.  Check your countries before you leave.  If they're merely &quot;sympathetic&quot;, fleeing and keeping a low profile may be a solution.  Don't expect to be able to return to the US for a long period of time, if ever.  Draft dodgers from Vietnam weren't allowed back in until Carter's 1977 blanket pardon, and by then, most were so integrated with their new communities that only half ultimately returned.  

''Risking jailtime'': Judging from Vietnam, expect a prison term of at least one year, probably three to four years -- if convicted.  There's a chance that you won't even be prosecuted; it all depends on how the Justice Department decides to treat cases.  Just realize that, if you take this route, you're gambling with serious consequences.  If you want to resist the draft directly in this manner, check out [http://www.resisters.info Resisters.info] for advice.  For this route, sooner is better than later.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Closing'''

There are no guarantees.  But there are a number of things you can do to increase your odds of getting past the board.  Know your local board and how they tend to vote, if you can.  If it's not too late, prepare in advance by laying the groundwork for a future claim(s) or living where there is a friendly board.  Pick your claim(s) well, and prepare, prepare, prepare.  Prep yourself and your witnesses alike.  If your claim is denied, move up the chain; you just need one board to grant you one of your claimed statuses.  Make sure that you meet the requirements of your claim, that you come across as sincere, and all of your documents are signed.  Don't give them any excuse to turn you down, because a number of boards are loaded with people eager to send everyone off to war.  Then again, some boards are loaded with people who are just the opposite.  In the end, by knowing what your options are and preparing, you're in better shape than most people who appear before the boards.

{{quote|The point of making this distinction between resisters and dodgers is not, however, to pass judgment on either. Instead, it is to make clear that during the Vietnam War, the Johnson and Nixon administrations dishonored a generation of men by making them decide between 1) fighting in a war regarded by many as immoral and illegal, 2) going to prison, or 3) evading both the war and prison. To this day, those choices haunt many of that generation and, I would argue, contribute significantly to the cynicism so many Americans have come to share about the faithfulness of their government.|&quot;Confronting the War Machine&quot;, Michael S.

== Purpose of the book ==

What is the purpose of this book - is it meant to be an introduction to programming in SAS, a history of the company or something else?  I have some ideas for content if it is a programming guide which I am happy to add and perhaps the book title should be changed then too?

This book is intended to be a guide to SAS programming. [[User:PAC|PAC]] ([[User talk:PAC|talk]]) 14:17, 1 September 2009 (UTC)

I'm not convinced this book in its present form is really of any value.  It seems to me that it might be preferable to merge the most important parts into the SAS Programming article on Wikiversity and then direct people to that resource, which seems to me to be both more complete and better written. [[w:User:Truthfulcynic|Truthfulcynic]] ([[w:User Talk:Truthfulcynic|talk]]) 18:40, 12 July 2010 (UTC)

I have discovered the wikiversity SAS programming recently and it's true that the wikiversity page is more complete. However, I am not sure that we should merge this book with the university project. I think it would be nice if we could have an [[R]], a [[Stata]] and a [[SAS]] wikibook. The main advantage of this wikibook over the wikiversity project is that it is organized by task, not by SAS modules. --[[User:PAC2|PAC2]] ([[User talk:PAC2|talk]]) 07:27, 13 July 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Looks to be a good tutorial, if only it was finished!

----- 

This Tutorial is excellent as of September 2008! As well as being an easy tute to follow [do download the PDF version - an absolute must due to the screen shots], is is an amazing insight to what some of the settings in the textures actually do for anyone with a bit of intelligence, and desire to learn.

I hope to see more from this author, with more descriptions of what can be accomplished with the texture settings. He demonstrates a great deal of mastery of the Material/texture settings in this tutorial, making me drool for more. I bow to you master!! The way you simulated 'Red Eye' in your 'eye' tute was simply beyond me until you described what you were doing (even though you did it - simply because 'I can'. Beautiful) -----

More please, [please, please. Pretty please?]


I liked it, but it would be much better converted to wiki format, as then corrections and clarifications can be easily made [[User:Lordelph|Lordelph]] ([[User talk:Lordelph|talk]]) 14:40, 2 January 2009 (UTC)


Without the pdf (which is not available at the specified website), this tutorial is extremely difficult to follow, especially the Iris texture description, which assumes you can see the pictures. [[User:Nanobug|Nanobug]] ([[User talk:Nanobug|talk]]) 20:11, 21 October 2010 (UTC)</text>

==Beyond hydrogen: the Periodic Table==
If we again assume that the nucleus is fixed at the center and ignore relativistic and spin effects, then the stationary states of helium are the solutions of the following equation:
:&lt;math&gt;
E\,{\partial\psi\over\partial t}=-{\hbar^2\over2m}
\left[{\partial^2\psi\over\partial x_1^2}+{\partial^2\psi\over\partial y_1^2}+{\partial^2\psi\over\partial z_1^2}+ {\partial^2\psi\over\partial x_2^2}+{\partial^2\psi\over\partial y_2^2}+{\partial^2\psi\over\partial z_2^2}\right]+ \left[-\frac{2e^2}{r_1}-\frac{2e^2}{r_2}+\frac{e^2}{r_{12}}\right]\psi.
&lt;/math&gt;
The wave function now depends on six coordinates, and the potential energy&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is made up of three terms. &lt;math&gt;r_1=\sqrt{x_1^2+y_1^2+z_1^2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r_2=\sqrt{x_2^2+y_2^2+z_2^2}&lt;/math&gt; are associated with the respective distances of the electrons from the nucleus, and &lt;math&gt;r_{12}=\sqrt{(x_2{-}x_1)^2+ (y_2{-}y_1)^2 +(z_2{-}z_1)^2}&lt;/math&gt; is associated with the distance between the electrons. Think of &lt;math&gt;e^2/r_{12}&lt;/math&gt; as the value the potential energy associated with the two electrons would have if they ''were'' at &lt;math&gt;r_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r_2,&lt;/math&gt; respectively.

&lt;br&gt;Why are there no separate wave functions for the two electrons? The joint probability of finding the first electron in a region&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and the second in a region&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; (relative to the nucleus) is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
p(A,B)=\int_A\!d^3r_1\!\int_B\!d^3r_2\;|\psi(\mathbf{r}_1,\mathbf{r}_2)|^2.
&lt;/math&gt;
If the probability of finding the first electron in&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; were independent of the whereabouts of the second electron, then we could assign to it a wave function&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\psi_1(\mathbf{r}_1),&lt;/math&gt; and if the probability of finding the second electron in&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; were independent of the whereabouts of the first electron, we could assign to it a wave function&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\psi_2(\mathbf{r}_2).&lt;/math&gt; In this case &lt;math&gt;\psi(\mathbf{r}_1,\mathbf{r}_2)&lt;/math&gt; would be given by the product &lt;math&gt;\psi_1(\mathbf{r}_1)\,\psi_2(\mathbf{r}_2)&lt;/math&gt; of the two wave functions, and &lt;math&gt;p(A,B)&lt;/math&gt; would be the product of &lt;math&gt;p(A)=\int_A\!d^3r_1\,|\psi(\mathbf{r}_1)|^2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p(B)=\int_B\!d^3r_2\,|\psi(\mathbf{r}_2)|^2.&lt;/math&gt; But in general, and especially inside a helium atom, the positional probability distribution for the first electron is conditional on the whereabouts of the second electron, and vice versa, given that the two electrons repel each other (to use the language of classical physics).

&lt;br&gt;For the lowest energy levels, the above equation has been solved by numerical methods. With three or more electrons it is hopeless to look for exact solutions of the corresponding Schrödinger equation. Nevertheless, the [[wikipedia:Periodic table|Periodic Table]] and many properties of the chemical elements can be understood by using the following approximate theory.

First,we disregard the details of the interactions between the electrons. Next, since the chemical properties of atoms depend on their outermost electrons, we consider each of these atoms subject to a potential that is due to (i)&amp;nbsp;the nucleus and (ii)&amp;nbsp;a continuous, spherically symmetric, charge distribution doing duty for the other electrons. We again neglect spin effects ''except'' that we take account of the [[wikipedia:Pauli exclusion principle|Pauli exclusion principle]], according to which the probability of finding two electrons (more generally, two [[wikipedia:Fermion|fermions]]) having exactly the same properties is&amp;nbsp;0. Thus two electrons can be associated with exactly the same wave function provided that their spin states differ in the following way: whenever the spins of the two electrons are measured with respect to a given axis, the outcomes are perfectly anticorrelated; one will be &quot;up&quot; and the other will be &quot;down&quot;. Since there are only two possible outcomes, a third electron cannot be associated with the same wave function.

This approximate theory yields stationary wave functions &lt;math&gt;\psi_{nlm}(\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt; called [[wikipedia:Atomic orbital|orbitals]] for individual electrons. These are quite similar to the stationary wave functions one obtains for the single electron of hydrogen, except that their dependence on the radial coordinate is modified by the negative charge distribution representing the remaining electrons. As a consequence of this modification, the energies associated with orbitals with the same quantum number&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; but different quantum numbers&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; are no longer equal. For any given&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;n\geq1,&lt;/math&gt; obitals with higher&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; yield a larger mean distance between the electron and the nucleus, and the larger this distance, the more the negative charge of the remaining electrons screens the positive charge of the nucleus. As a result, an electron with higher&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; is less strongly bound (given the same&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;), so its [[wikipedia:Ionization potential|ionization energy]] is lower.

Chemists group orbitals into [[wikipedia:Electron shell|shells]] according to their principal quantum number. As we have seen, the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-th shell can &quot;accommodate&quot; up to &lt;math&gt;n^2\times2&lt;/math&gt; electrons. Helium has the first shell completely &quot;filled&quot; and the second shell &quot;empty.&quot; Because the helium nucleus has twice the charge of the hydrogen nucleus, the two electrons are, on average, much nearer the nucleus than the single electron of hydrogen. The ionization energy of helium is therefore much larger, 2372.3&amp;nbsp;[[wikipedia:Joule per mole|J/mol]] as compared to 1312.0&amp;nbsp;J/mol for hydrogen. On the other hand, if you tried to add an electron to create a negative helium ion, it would have to go into the second shell, which is almost completely screened from the nucleus by the electrons in the first shell. Helium is therefore neither prone to give up an electron not able to hold an extra electron. It is chemically inert, as are all elements in the rightmost column of the Periodic Table.

In the second row of the Periodic Table the second shell gets filled. Since the energies of the 2p orbitals are higher than that of the 2s orbital, the latter gets &quot;filled&quot; first. With each added electron (and proton!) the entire electron distribution gets pulled in, and the ionization energy goes up, from 520.2&amp;nbsp;J/mol for lithium (atomic number Z=3) to 2080.8&amp;nbsp;J/mol for neon (Z=10). While lithium readily parts with an electron, fluorine (Z=9) with a single empty &quot;slot&quot; in the second shell is prone to grab one. Both are therefore quite active chemically. The progression from sodium (Z=11) to argon (Z=18) parallels that from lithium to neon.

There is a noteworthy peculiarity in the corresponding sequences of [[wikipedia:Ionization energies of the elements|ionization energies]]: The ionization energy of oxygen (Z=8, 1313.9&amp;nbsp;J/mol) is lower than that of nitrogen (Z=7, 1402.3&amp;nbsp;J/mol), and that of sulfur (Z=16, 999.6&amp;nbsp;J/mol) is lower than that of phosphorus (Z=15, 1011.8&amp;nbsp;J/mol). To understand why this is so, we must take account of certain details of the inter-electronic forces that we have so far ignored.

Suppose that one of the two 2p&amp;nbsp;electrons of carbon (Z=6) goes into the &lt;math&gt;m{=}0&lt;/math&gt; orbital with respect to the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;axis. Where will the other 2p&amp;nbsp;electron go? It will go into any vacant orbital that minimizes the repulsion between the two electrons, by maximizing their mean distance. This is neither of the orbitals with &lt;math&gt;|m|{=}1&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;axis but an orbital with &lt;math&gt;m{=}0&lt;/math&gt; with respect to some axis perpendicular to the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;axis. If we call this the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;axis, then the third 2p&amp;nbsp;electron of nitrogen goes into the orbital with &lt;math&gt;m{=}0&lt;/math&gt; relative to &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;axis. The fourth 2p&amp;nbsp;electron of oxygen then has no choice but to go — with opposite spin — into an already occupied 2p&amp;nbsp;orbital. This raises its energy significantly and accounts for the drop in ionization from nitrogen to oxygen.

By the time the 3p&amp;nbsp;orbitals are &quot;filled,&quot; the energies of the 3d&amp;nbsp;states are pushed up so high (as a result of screening) that the 4s&amp;nbsp;state is energetically lower. The &quot;filling up&quot; of the 3d&amp;nbsp;orbitals therefore begins only after the 4s&amp;nbsp;orbitals are &quot;occupied,&quot; with scandium (Z=21).

Thus even this simplified and approximate version of the quantum theory of atoms has the power to predict the qualitative and many of the quantitative features of the Period Table.

Dual boot configurations between home operating systems (Windows Me, Windows 98 SE, Windows 98, Windows 95 OSRx and Windows 95) are not supported. For example, Windows Me and Windows 9x can not be installed on the same partition, and you can not run any home operating system along any home operating system. These operating systems use typically the same IO.SYS, MSDOS.SYS and COMMAND.COM files. In addition, start-up configuration of Windows 2000 or Windows NT operating system and many home operating systems, for example, Windows Me and Windows 9x at once, are not supported.

You can install each from two operating systems, such as Windows 2000 or Windows NT and Windows Me or Windows 9x, on the same partition. More than two operating systems on the same partition are not supported.

It is recommended that you install as the first operating system, home system such as Windows Me or Windows 9x, and then install professional system such as Windows 2000 or Windows NT. This step ensures that the boot sector of Windows 2000 or Windows NT is not overwritten.

The boot partition on your computer that is configured for dual-boot must use the FAT16 file system, unless you want to install Windows Me, Windows 98 SE, Windows 98 or Windows 95 OSR2 and Windows 2000 on the same partition. In this case, the boot partition can be FAT32. If you want to use any combination of system configurations other than Windows 2000 and Windows Me, Windows 98 SE, Windows 98 or Windows 95 OSR2 and the boot partition is either FAT32, or NTFS, you must back up your data, and then repartition and reformat your hard disk to FAT16 to properly and correctly prepare it before you set up your dual-boot configuration.

&lt;/div&gt;

==Probability flux==
The time rate of change of the probability density &lt;math&gt;\rho(t,\mathbf{r})=|\psi(t,\mathbf{r})|^2&lt;/math&gt; (at a fixed location &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt;) is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t}=\psi^*\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial t}+\psi\frac{\partial\psi^*}{\partial t}.
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br&gt;With the help of the Schrödinger equation and its complex conjugate,

&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
i\hbar\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial t}=\frac{1}{2m} \left(\frac{\hbar}{i}\frac{\partial}{\partial\mathbf{r}}
-\mathbf{A}\right)\cdot\left(\frac{\hbar}{i}
\frac{\partial}{\partial\mathbf{r}}-\mathbf{A}\right)\psi+V\psi,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
{\hbar\over i}{\partial\psi^*\over\partial t}=
\frac{1}{2m}\left(i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial\mathbf{r}}-\mathbf{A}\right)\cdot
\left(i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial\mathbf{r}}-\mathbf{A}\right)\psi^*+V\psi^*,
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;br&gt;one obtains

&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t}=-\frac i\hbar\psi^*\left[\frac{1}{2m} \left(\frac{\hbar}{i}\frac{\partial}{\partial\mathbf{r}}-\mathbf{A}\right)\cdot\left(\frac{\hbar}{i}
\frac{\partial}{\partial\mathbf{r}}-\mathbf{A}\right)\psi+V\psi\right]&lt;/math&gt;
:::&lt;math&gt;
+\frac i\hbar\psi\left[\frac{1}{2m}\left(i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial\mathbf{r}}-\mathbf{A}\right)
\cdot\left(i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial\mathbf{r}}-\mathbf{A}\right)\psi^*+V\psi^*\right].
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;br&gt;The terms containing &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; cancel out, so we are left with

&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t}=-\frac i{2m\hbar}\left[
\psi^*\left(i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial\mathbf{r}}+\mathbf{A}\right)\cdot\left(i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial\mathbf{r}}+\mathbf{A}\right)\psi-\psi\left(i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial\mathbf{r}}-\mathbf{A}\right)\cdot\left(i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial\mathbf{r}}-\mathbf{A}\right)\psi^*
\right]&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
=\dots=-\frac{\hbar}{2mi}\left(\frac{\partial^2\psi}{\partial\mathbf{r}^2}\psi^*-\psi\frac{\partial^2\psi^*}{\partial\mathbf{r}^2}\right)
+\frac1m\left(\psi\psi^*\frac{\partial}{\partial\mathbf{r}}\cdot\mathbf{A}+\mathbf{A}\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial\mathbf{r}}\psi^*+\mathbf{A}\psi\frac{\partial\psi^*}{\partial\mathbf{r}}\right).
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;br&gt;Next, we calculate the divergence of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{j}=\frac{\hbar}{2mi}\left(\psi^*\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial\mathbf{r}}
-\frac{\partial\psi^*}{\partial\mathbf{r}}\psi\right)-\frac{1}{m}\mathbf{A}\psi^*\psi&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial}{\partial\mathbf{r}}\cdot\mathbf{j}=\frac{\hbar}{2mi}\left(\frac{\partial^2\psi}{\partial\mathbf{r}^2}\psi^*-\psi\frac{\partial^2\psi^*}{\partial\mathbf{r}^2}\right)-\frac1m\left(\psi\psi^*\frac{\partial}{\partial\mathbf{r}}\cdot\mathbf{A}+\mathbf{A}\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial\mathbf{r}}\psi^*+\mathbf{A}\psi\frac{\partial\psi^*}{\partial\mathbf{r}}\right).
&lt;/math&gt;
The upshot:

{| style=&quot;border:5px solid lightsteelblue&quot; cellpadding=&quot;20px&quot;
|&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t}=-\frac{\partial}{\partial\mathbf{r}}\cdot\mathbf{j}.
&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Integrated over a spatial region&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; with unchanging boundary &lt;math&gt;\partial R:&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
{\partial\over\partial t}\int_R\rho\,d^3r=-\int_R{\partial\over\partial\mathbf{r}}\cdot\mathbf{j}\,d^3r.
&lt;/math&gt;
According to [[wikipedia:Gauss's law|Gauss's law]], the outward flux of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{j}&lt;/math&gt;  through &lt;math&gt;\partial R&lt;/math&gt; equals the integral of the [[wikipedia:Divergence|divergence]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{j}&lt;/math&gt; over&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;R:&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\oint_{\partial R}\mathbf{j}\cdot d\Sigma=\int_R {\partial\over\partial\mathbf{r}}\cdot\mathbf{j}\,d^3r.
&lt;/math&gt;
We thus have that
:&lt;math&gt;
{\partial\over\partial t}\int_R\rho\,d^3r=-\oint_{\partial R}\mathbf{j}\cdot d\Sigma.
&lt;/math&gt;
If &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the continuous density of some kind of stuff (stuff per unit volume) and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{j}&lt;/math&gt; is its flux (stuff per unit area per unit time), then on the left-hand side we have the rate at which the stuff inside&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; 
increases, and on the right-hand side we have the rate at which stuff enters through the surface of&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;R.&lt;/math&gt; So if some stuff moves from place A&amp;nbsp;to place&amp;nbsp;B, it crosses the boundary of any region that contains either A or&amp;nbsp;B. This is why the framed equation is known as a [[wikipedia:Continuity equation|continuity equation]].

&lt;br&gt;In the quantum world, however, there is no such thing as continuously distributed and/or continuously moving stuff. &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{j},&lt;/math&gt; respectively, are a density (something per unit volume) and a flux (something per unit area per unit time) only in a formal sense. If &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; is the wave function associated with a particle, then the integral &lt;math&gt;\int_R\rho\,d^3r=\int_R|\psi|^2\,d^3r&lt;/math&gt; gives the probability of finding the particle in &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; ''if the appropriate measurement is made'', and the framed equation tells us this: if the probability of finding the particle inside&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;R,&lt;/math&gt; as a function of the time at which the measurement is made, increases, then the probability of finding the particle outside&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;R,&lt;/math&gt; as a function of the same time, decreases by the same amount. (Much the same holds if &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; is associated with a system having &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;degrees of freedom and &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is a region of the system's configuration space.) This is sometimes expressed by saying that &quot;probability is (locally) conserved.&quot; When you hear this, then remember that the probability for something to happen in a given place at a given time isn't anything that is situated at that place or that exists at that time.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Description ==

This component grabs frames from a [http://www.baslerweb.com Basler Vision] gigabit ethernet camera ([http://www.baslerweb.com/beitraege/beitrag_en_34697.html scout] or [http://www.baslerweb.com/beitraege/beitrag_en_48495.html pilot] series, or a compatible model) using the Basler Pylon driver (version 2.0). Note that this component is not part of the standard distribution of SwisTrack and requires [[SwisTrack/Developers|compiling SwisTrack by yourself]].

== Input ==

A Pylon compliant GigE (Gigabit Ethernet) camera, such as the [http://www.baslerweb.com/beitraege/beitrag_en_34697.html scout] or [http://www.baslerweb.com/beitraege/beitrag_en_48495.html pilot] GigE cameras from [http://www.baslerweb.com Basler Vision].

== Output ==
[[Image:SwisTrack_ColorImage.jpg]]

A grayscale or a color image.

== Trigger Mechanism ==

If configured in software trigger mode, this component always accepts processing frames.

In all other trigger modes, the component vetoes execution until the next frame from the camera is ready.

== Parameters ==

=== Camera ===
Choose the GigE camera you want to use to acquire images. The special entry &quot;Any&quot; takes any available camera (actually the camera that the driver lists as first camera).

=== Mode ===
Color or grayscale mode. Note that you anyway need to add an input conversion component.

=== Trigger mode ===
If you have an external trigger connected to your camera, select the trigger input line here. Acquisition will be triggered on the rising edge.

&lt;i&gt;Timer&lt;/i&gt; uses the internal timer of the camera.

&lt;i&gt;Software trigger&lt;/i&gt; sends the trigger signal over ethernet, which is not as precise as an external trigger or the internal timer. (In this configuration, the component does not act as a trigger.)

=== Timer ===
Sets the internal timer trigger of the camera. Note that this field is only used if ''Trigger mode'' is set to ''Timer''.

=== Exposure time ===

Raw exposure time. This value is multiplied by the exposure time base of the camera to obtain the actual exposure time. Refer to the camera documentation for details.

=== Analog gain ===

Analog gain. Refer to the camera documentation for details.

=== Area of Interest (Offset and Size) ===

The image area to sample and transmit. Smaller areas will result in higher frame rates.

=== Input buffer size ===

The number of input buffers (in number of frames) to provide to the camera driver. The camera driver will fill these buffers in case the computer is temporarily busy with other tasks and not able read the frames at the speed they arrive. Recommended values are:
* 1 - 4 for online processing (e.g. for live tracking of robots)
* 8 - 16 for offline processing (e.g. recording for post-experiment analysis)

== About me==
I'm currently pursuing an undergraduate degree (BSc) in [[w:Cognitive Science|Cognitive Science]], but my interests extend beyond cognition. My main interests are ''consciousness'' studies, philosophy and psychology, least not forget ''music'', composing and piano playing.
I am strongely addicted to ideas of community building and open access.

'''Technology and Such'''&lt;br&gt;
I'm starting to learn programming in [[w:Java_%28programming_language%29|JAVA]] and in striving to become a scientist I have to study statistics. Although this is not my best subject I enjoy it, strangely enough. Perhaps this is because I have finally got hold of a great introduction to the topic. I have a fair knowledge of HTML and [[w:CSS|CSS]] - read the [[CSS_Programming|book]].

Sometimes I get lost in technical literature and my prose follows suite, especially in languages other than my own.

'''APE Users Guide''' is a book designed to help you get the most out of the open source 2D physics engine [http://www.cove.org/ape '''APE'''].

==About==
APE (Actionscript Physics Engine) is written in AS3 and is designed for use in Flash or Flex games and applications.

==Overview==
[[Image:Ape_1.png|right|frame|A CircleParticle and a RectangleParticle connected by a SpringConstraint]]
APE is a 2D physics engine written in Actionscript 3 for use in Flash and Flex.

You can simulate 2D dynamics by using particles and connecting them with constraints to create more complex shapes. The engine currently has 3 different kinds of particle classes - the CircleParticle, RectangleParticle, and WheelParticle, and one type of constraint - the SpringConstraint.

==Setup==
====Flex Builder 2====
====Flash CS3====

A good tutorial here (this is Part 2, which directly addresses Flash CS3, as opposed to part one which works with Flex):

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What is Electronics? ==

Electronics is the study of flow of electrons in various materials or space subjected to various conditions. In the past, electronics dealt with the study of Vacuum Tubes or Thermionic valves, today it mainly deals with flow of electrons in semiconductors.  However, despite these technological differences, the main focus of electronics remains the controlled flow of electrons through a medium.  By controlling the flow of electrons, we can make them perform special tasks, such as power an induction motor or heat a resistive coil.

Plumbing Analogy A simple way to understand electrical circuits is to think of them as pipes.  Let's say you have a simple circuit with a voltage source and a resistor between the positive and negative terminals on the source.  When the circuit is powered, electrons will move from the negative terminal, through the resistor, and into the positive terminal.  The resistor is basically a path of conduction that resists the movement of electrons.  This circuit could also be represented as a plumbing network.  In the plumbing network, the resistor would be equivalent to a section of pipe, where the water is forced to move around several barriers to pass through, effectively slowing its flow.  If the pipe is level, no water will flow in an organized fashion, since the pressure is equal throughout the pipe.  However, if we tilt the pipe to a vertical position (similar to turning on a voltage source), a pressure difference is created (similar to a voltage difference) and the water begins flowing through the pipe.  This flow of water is similar to the flow of electrons in a circuit.

== Electricity ==
To understand electronics, you need to understand electricity and what it is.  Basically, electricity is the flow of electrons due to a difference in electrical charge between two points.  This difference in charge is created due to a difference in electron density.  If you have a point where the electron density is higher than the electron density at another point, the electrons in the area of higher density will want to balance the charge by migrating towards the area with lower density.  This migration is referred to as electrical current.  Thus, flow in an electrical circuit is induced by putting more electrons on one side of the circuit than the other, forcing them to move through the circuit to balance the charge density.

==Electric Charge==
In normal conditions all matter has a neutral or has a zero net charge. When an object receives an electron the object becomes negatively charged. When an object gives up an electron the object becomes positively charged. Each charge possesses electric field lines and charge quantities. A positive charge possesses charge quantities of +Q and has electric field lines going outward. A negative charge possesses charge quantities of -Q and has electric field lines going inward. In general, like charges will oppose each other and opposite charges will attract each other. Hence, it is a property of matter.
===Coulomb's Law===
The force of attraction between two charges can be calculated by Coulomb's Law. Below would be the calculation between a positive and negative charge.
: &lt;math&gt;F = k \frac{Q+.Q-}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;

===Ampere's Law===
The electric force, F, on a charge, Q, within an electric field, E, are related by Ampere's Law. On an atomic basis, this is the force that gives rise to current.
:&lt;math&gt;F = E Q&lt;/math&gt;

===Lorentz's Law===
When a charge in motion passes through a magnetic field. The magnetic field will push a positive charge upward and negative charge downward in the direction perpendicular to the initial direction traveled. The magnetic force on the charge is calculated by Lorennt's Law
:&lt;math&gt;F = Qv B&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;F = -Qv B&lt;/math&gt;

===ElectroMagnetic Force===
The sum of Ampere's Force and Lorentz's Force exert on a charge is called EletroMagnetic Force
:&lt;math&gt;F = F + F = Q E + Q vB = Q (E + vB)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;F = F + F = Q E - Q vB = Q (E - vB)&lt;/math&gt;

==Electricity and Matter==
All matter interacts with Electricity, and are divided into three categories: Conductors, Semi Conductors, and Non Conductors.

[[Conductor]]
: Matter that conducts Electricity easily. Metals like Zinc (Zn) and Copper (Cu) conduct electricity very easily. Therefore, they are used to make Conductors.

[[Non-Conductor]]
: Matter that does not conduct Electricity at all. Non-Metals like Wood and Rubber do not conduct electricity so easily. Therefore, they are used to make Non-Conductors.

[[Semi Conductor]]
:Matter that conducts electricity in a manner between that of Conductors and Non-Conductors. For example, Silicon (Si) and Germanium (Ge) conduct electricity better than non-conductors but worse than conductors. Therefore, they are used to make Semi Conductors.

==Electricity and Conductors==
Normally, all conductors have a zero net charge . If there is an electric force that exerts a pressure on the charges in the conductor to force charges to move in a straight line result in a stream of electric charge moving in a straight line 

===Voltage===
:The pressure the electric force exert on the charges is called ''voltage'' denoted as V measured in Volt (V) and defined as the ''ratio of Work Done on Charge''
: &lt;math&gt;V = \frac{W}{Q}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;V = \frac{P}{I}&lt;/math&gt;

===Current===
:The moving of straight lines of electric charges in the conductor is called ''current'' denoted as I measured in Ampere (A) and defined as ''Charge flow through an area in a unit of time''
: &lt;math&gt;I = \frac{Q}{t}&lt;/math&gt;

===Conductance===
: Conductance is defined as ''the ratio of current over voltage'' denoted as Y measured in mho
: &lt;math&gt;Y = \frac{I}{V}&lt;/math&gt;

===Resistance===
:Resistance is defined as ''the ratio of voltage over current'' denoted as R measured in Ohm
: &lt;math&gt;R = \frac{V}{I}&lt;/math&gt;

Generally, resistance of any conductor is found to increase with increasing temperature
 
For Conductor
: R = Ro(1 + nT)
For Semi Conductor
: R = Ro e&lt;sup&gt;nT&lt;/sup&gt;

When a conductor conducts electricity, it dissipates heat energy into the surrounding . This results in a loss of electric energy transmitted '' . If the electric supply energy is P&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; and the electric loss energy is P&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; Then the electric energy delivered: 

: P = P&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; - P&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;P = IV - I^2 R = IV - \frac{V^2}{R}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;P = I (V - IR) = V (I - \frac{V}{R})&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;P = Cos \theta&lt;/math&gt;

==Black Body Radiation==
Further experience with conductors that conduct electricity . It is observed that all conductors that conduct electricity exhibit 
# Change in Temperature
# Release Radiant Heat Energy into the surrounding

===Experiment===
Connect a conductor with an electric source in a closed loop . Plot the value I at different f to have a I - f diagram

===Observation===
for f&lt;fo
: Current increasing with increasing f . 
: Radiant heat is a wave travels at velocity v = λf carries energy E = m v&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; . 

for f=fo, 
: Current stops increasing . 
: Radiant heat is a wave travels at velocity v = c (speed of Light) carries energy E = hfo . 

for f&gt;fo, 
: Current remains at the value of current at fo . 
: Radiant heat is a wave travels at velocity v = c (speed of Light) carries energy E = h nfo

===Conclusion===
# All conductor that conducts Electricity has a threshold frequency fo
# The Radiant Heat Energy is a Light Wave of dual Wave Particle characteristic. Sometimes it behaves like Particle, sometimes it behaves like Wave
# At Frequency f &gt; fo . The energy of the Light is quantized . it can only have the value of multiple integer of fo . E = hf = h nfo

      <text xml:space="preserve">*Percent composition - the percent mass of an element in a compound. This only requires the '''empirical formula''' which is the ratio of elements in a compound. This is different from a '''molecular formula''', which counts the total number of atoms of each element in the compound.

*Limiting reactants - In a reaction, if there is not enough of a specific reactant, it is called the limiting reactant. To find out which substance is the limiting reactant, first find out how many moles of each substance exist at first. Then, divide each by the coefficient of the respective substance in the balanced equation. The substance with the smallest number in the end is the limiting reactant.
{{todo|add an example}}

*Percent yield - (actual yield / theoretical yield) * 100. If this isn't self explanatory, you shouldn't be taking the AP exam.

==Examples==
A certain compound has the empirical formula C&lt;sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;. When 4 moles of it is burned with excess oxygen (combustion), it produces 72.08gH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. What is the molecular formula of the compound?

Start by writing a balanced equation of the combustion of C&lt;sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;.

4C&lt;sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; + 5O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr;  4CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;+  2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

Now use stoichometry to find the mass of the C&lt;sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;.

72.08gH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

&lt;math&gt; 72.08gH_2O \times \frac{1molH_2O}{18.02gH_2O} \times \frac{4molCH}{2molH_2O} \times \frac{13.02gCH}{1molCH} = {104.16g} CH&lt;/math&gt;

Remember that four moles were burned, so the mass you found is found in four moles. You can now use this to find the molecular formula.

&lt;math&gt; \frac {104.16g}{4molCH} \times \frac {1molCH}{13.02gCH}= 2 &lt;/math&gt;

This is number is the number you multiply the subscripts by, and so you find the molecular formula to be C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

      <comment>/* Ideal Gas Equation */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Kinetic Molecular Theory==
Ideal gases don't exist, but if they did, they would fit the following descriptions:
*Full of tiny particles that are far apart
*Neither attract nor repel each other
*Are constantly and randomly moving, creating pressure
*Do not lose energy when colliding.

===Pressure===
Pressure is measured with a barometer (for atmospheric pressure) or a manometer (for sealed containers of gases).

{{:General Chemistry/Gas Laws}}

===Avogadro's Law===
One mole of gas particles at STP takes up 22.4L

===Ideal Gas Equation===
PV=nRT, where R = 0.0821 L*atm/K*mol = ideal gas constant. Note how if P is in atm, V is in L, n is in moles, and T is in Kelvin, the units cancel out.

Remember that these gas laws only work in '''Kelvin'''.

===Graham's Law===
For every x times heavier a gas is, it travels &lt;math&gt; \sqrt{x} &lt;/math&gt; times slower:

&lt;math&gt; \frac{v_2}{v_1} = \sqrt{\frac{MM_1}{MM_2}} &lt;/math&gt;

==Non-Ideal Gases==
When gases are polar, massive, at high pressure and low temperature, they do not behave like ideal gases. They may even condense into liquids or freeze into solids.

==Japanese Vocabulary==
All subpages of [[Japanese/Vocabulary]] should be transwikied to wiktionary and new pages should follow the structure of [[Miskito/Vocabulary (Miskito)]] (i.e. vocabulary pages should reference words in lessons)
==Japanese Grammar==
Should be kept how it is. Need to organize [[Japanese/Grammar/Table of contents]].
==Japanese Kana==
*[[Japanese/Lessons/Lesson 6]] -&gt; [[Japanese/Kana]]
*[[Japanese/Kana Chart]] -&gt; [[Japanese/Kana/Chart]]
In order to reduce the number of page moves, keep the rest of the pages the same (i.e. [[Japanese/Kana/Lessons/Hiragana/Lesson 1]]). [[Japanese/Kana/Lessons/Katakana/Lesson 1/Exercises]], [[Japanese/Kana/Lessons/Katakana/Lesson 1/Key]], [[Japanese/Kana/Lessons/Katakana/Lesson 2/Exercises]], [[Japanese/Kana/Lessons/Katakana/Lesson 2/Key]] should be transwikied to wikiversity as it is in their scope. The menomics in the lessons should also be transwikied to wikiversity as it may not work for everyone and it allows other people to suggest their menomics.
==Japanese Lessons==
There were 6 attempts in lessons and are as follows
*[[Japanese/Grammar Lessons]] and its chapters
*[[Japanese/Random Lessons]]
*[[Japanese/Lessons]] and its decendants
*[[Japanese/Basic Japanese]]
*[[Japanese/Elementary Japanese]]
*[[Japanese/Intermediate Japanese]]
As development in all of these attempts have stopped, I propose these lessons be archived and we should start over.

==Japanese Pronunciation==
Fine the way they are, just need to structure them to follow structure of book and follow order as listed in [[v:Pronunciation of Japanese#Reading|]].
==Meta Pages==
Should be archived.</text>

''Why should the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Italy|Italians]] have all the luck when it comes to meatballs, delicious as they may be ? I say let others get a look in, and here we have a recipe from Germany which is easy and utterly delicious. And not a tomato in sight!! These are known in Germany as Konigsberge Klopse, or sometimes as Konigsberger Klopsies !! 

''Konigsberg, also now known as Kaliningrad is, somewhat disappointingly, not in Germany at all but is in the Russian exclave (whatever that is!!) between Lithuania and Poland, but was formerly a part of the German province of East Prussia.''

''Whether the meatballs should thus be renamed &quot;''Russian Exclave meatballs''&quot; is a subject for those more qualified than I to discuss !! My view is that &quot;Konigsberger Kloepse&quot; or even German Meatballs sound rather more palatable.''

== Ingredients ==

* 8 [[Cookbook:Ounce|oz]] (225[[Cookbook:Gram|g]]) of low fat [[Cookbook:Mincing|minced]] [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]]
* 8 oz (225g) of minced [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]]
* 1 large [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]] (peeled and chopped)
* 5 [[Cookbook:Anchovy|anchovy]] fillets chopped finely
* 2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] [[Cookbook:Caper|capers]]
* ¼ bottle of Riesling white [[Cookbook:Wine|wine]]
* 6 fl oz of [[Cookbook:Crème Fraîche|crème fraîche]]
* 1 tablespoon of [[Cookbook:Mixed Herbs|mixed herbs]]
* 1 large [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]
* 2 - 3 slices of brown [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]] or a roll, soaked in [[Cookbook:Water|water]]
* juice of 2 [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemons]]
* [[Cookbook:Zest|zest]] of 2 [[Cookbook:Lime|limes]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Clove|cloves]]
* ½ tablespoon of [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] and freshly ground [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]
* 2 tablespoon of [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] mixed with water to form a [[Cookbook:Roux|roux]]

== Procedure ==
# Finely chop the onion and fry it until translucent making sure it does not brown in any way, and then add to the minced beef and pork mixture.
# Soak the brown bread or roll in water, and then also add to the minced meat.
# Add Pepper, salt, chopped anchovy fillets, egg and mixed herbs to the mince, mix everything together by hand and start forming little meatballs about ¾ inch in diameter. 
# To make them, take a quantity of the mince mixture in your hands and form it into a round shape. Then gently roll them between your palms so they become as round as possible. Don't become obsessed with shape here, it doesn't matter if they are neither symmetrical or the same size as each other.
# Bring at least 2 pints of water to a rolling simmer, and add the lemon juice, the cloves, the olive oil to it, and gently drop in the meatballs. Don't overcrowd the pan, if need be drop the meatballs in in 2 goes.
# As soon as the meatballs rise to the surface, remove them with a slotted spoon and set aside keeping warm.
# Now add the wine, the crème fraîche and the flour mixture (called a ''roux'') to the water and reduce a little and thicken. There should be plenty of sauce for this dish, so rather than rely on reducing the sauce to thicken it, don't be afraid of adding more roux to achieve this.
# As the sauce begins to thicken, return the meatballs to the sauce and continue to cook for another 10 minutes or so.
# At the last moment add the capers and the zest of the limes.
# Adjust your seasoning to suit your taste.
# Pour the entire contents of the pan through a semi-fine sieve which will get rid of the &quot;bits&quot;.
# Heat up the sauce again if needed, add the meatballs in the sieve, and a handful of capers (they don't actually need cooking) according to your taste and you are ready to go.

This version of meatballs are best served with boiled, waxy [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]] which can be ''scrunshed'' into the sauce to make it all the more delicious.

ctypes[http://python.net/crew/theller/ctypes/] is a [[w:Foreign function interface|foreign function interface]] module for Python (included with Python 2.5 and above), which allows you to load in dynamic libraries and call C functions.  This is not technically extending Python, but it serves one of the primary reasons for extending Python: to interface with external C code.

==Basics==

A library is loaded using the &lt;code&gt;ctypes.CDLL&lt;/code&gt; function.  After you load the library, the functions inside the library are already usable as regular Python calls.  For example, if we wanted to forego the standard Python print statement and use the standard C library function, &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt;, you would use this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
from ctypes import *
libName = 'libc.so' # If you're on a UNIX-based system
libName = 'msvcrt.dll' # If you're on Windows
libc = CDLL(libName)
libc.printf(&quot;Hello, World!\n&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

Of course, you must use the libName line that matches your operating system, and delete the other.  If all goes well, you should see the infamous Hello World string at your console.

==Getting Return Values==

ctypes assumes, by default, that any given function's return type is a signed integer of native size.  Sometimes you don't want the function to return anything, and other times, you want the function to return other types.  Every ctypes function has an attribute called &lt;code&gt;restype&lt;/code&gt;.  When you assign a ctypes class to &lt;code&gt;restype&lt;/code&gt;, it automatically casts the function's return value to that type.

      <text xml:space="preserve">why does this recipe state 3/4 of a placenta when the weight of placentas very so widely? and because the placenta really can be treated as any other meat, is it necessary to include such a bland recipe when a potential chef could simply check some more creative and numerous beef stew recipes?
:Presumably this is what happens when precedent is set that Placenta-meat is important enough to merit an article on WikiCookBook. [[Special:Contributions/66.215.20.28|66.215.20.28]] ([[User talk:66.215.20.28|talk]]) 09:12, 21 July 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Many quanities in mechanics are '''vectors'''.  A vector is a quantity that has a '''magnitude''' and a '''direction'''.  ''Velocity'' is a vector.  To solve a problem, it is not enough to know the speed a vehicle is travelling, but one must also know the direction in which the vehicle is travelling at that speed.  Likewise, ''Force'' is a vector quantity.  It has a magnitude (the amount of force in Newtons) and the direction in which the force is being applied.

==Graphical Representation==

Vectors are usually denoted in boldface, as '''a'''. Other conventions include &lt;math&gt;\vec{a}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;u&gt;''a''&lt;/u&gt;, especially in handwriting. Alternately, some use a tilde (~) or a wavy underline drawn beneath the symbol, which is a convention for indicating boldface type.

Vectors are usually shown in graphs or other diagrams as arrows, as illustrated below:

[[Image:vector from A to B.svg|center|200px|Vector arrow pointing from ''A'' to ''B'']]

Here the point ''A'' is called the ''tail'', ''base'', ''start'', or ''origin''; point ''B'' is called the ''head'', ''tip'', ''endpoint'', or ''destination''.  The length of the arrow represents the vector's magnitude, while the direction in which the arrow points represents the vector's direction. 

In the figure above, the arrow can also be written as &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{AB}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;u&gt;''AB''&lt;/u&gt;.

[[Image:Notation for vectors in or out of a plane.svg|right|200px]]
On a two-dimensional diagram, sometimes a vector perpendicular to the plane of the diagram is desired. These vectors are commonly shown as small circles. A circle with a dot at its centre indicates a vector pointing out of the front of the diagram, towards the viewer. A circle with a cross inscribed in it indicates a vector pointing into and behind the diagram. These can be thought of as viewing the tip an arrow front on and viewing the vanes of an arrow from the back.

[[Image:Plane Cartesian vector.png|thumb|right|A vector in the Cartesian plane, with endpoint (2,3).  The vector itself is identified with its endpoint.]]

==Array Notation==

==Dot Product==
The dot product of two vectors '''a''' = [''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, … , ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;] and '''b''' = [''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, … , ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;] is defined as:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}\cdot \mathbf{b} = \sum_{i=1}^n a_ib_i = a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + \cdots + a_nb_n &lt;/math&gt;
where Σ denotes summation notation and ''n'' is the dimension of the vectors.

==Cross Product==
==Scalars==
Magnitudes without directions are referred to as '''scalars'''. These are not vectors but only single numbers.

This page details a method for finding the solutions to equations of the form
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}+P(x)y=Q(x),&lt;/math&gt;
Using the Integrating Factor: &lt;math&gt;I(x)=e^{\int P(x) dx}&lt;/math&gt;

==Example 1==
Consider the following equation:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx} + 3y=xe^{-3x} + 1&lt;/math&gt;
Now the &lt;math&gt; P(x) = 3&lt;/math&gt;
So the integrating factor is: 
:&lt;math&gt; I(x)=e^{\int P(x) dx} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; I(x)=e^{\int 3 dx}    &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; I(x)=e^{3x}           &lt;/math&gt;

Multiply the original equation by &lt;math&gt; I(x) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;e^{3x}\frac{dy}{dx} + e^{3x}3y=e^{3x}(xe^{-3x} +1)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;e^{3x}\frac{dy}{dx} + e^{3x}3y=x + e^{3x}&lt;/math&gt;

Then try: &lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dx}(ye^{3x}) = e^{3x}\frac{dy}{dx} + e^{3x}3y&lt;/math&gt;

Which is equal to the LHS giving us:
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dx}(ye^{3x})= x + e^{3x}&lt;/math&gt;

Then integrate with respect to x:
:&lt;math&gt; \int\frac{d}{dx}(ye^{3x})dx=\int x dx + \int e^{3x} dx&lt;/math&gt;

Giving:
:&lt;math&gt; ye^{3x} = \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{e^{3x}}{3} + C&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; y = \frac{x^2}{2e^{3x}} + \frac{1}{3} + Ce^{-3x}&lt;/math&gt;    (This is the general solution)

This book is going to serve as a replacement for the current [[Modern Physics/Gravity]] chapter of the [[Modern Physics]] book. I had previously not made this chapter into a separate book because there was very little content in it. However, a book about gravity (even if it is a very short book) will be useful as a background for other physics and engineering books.

== Table of Contents ==

*Law of Gravity
*Gravitational Constant
*Gravity as a Vector
*Gravitational Field

My name is Jon. I've been a wikipedia addict since mid-2005. I hope I never quit.

I'm mostly interested in learning and have always loved trivia. Wikipedia is ''the'' place not just for learning trivia, but for learning it in context. 

My main interests are science and [[literature]], so most of my contributions to wikipedia have been correcting typos on pages dealing with [[technology]] and science, though only recently with the username '''jonnyapple'''. If you ever see me make mistakes, please let me know as I feel I can handle criticism and am always trying to learn.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{WikiProject Languages}} 

ljubiti/љубити has the principal meaning of &quot;to kiss&quot; in Serbian, Bosnian, and Croatian.
voleti/волети is &quot;to love&quot;. I would suggest changing this table or putting a note somewhere. The Russian &quot;я тебя люблю&quot; - I love you would be the south Slavic (BCS) &quot;Ja tebe ljubim&quot; which means &quot;I am kissing YOU&quot; (the form &quot;tebe&quot; serves as an emphasis of which person the sentence refers to).

Also, &quot;трудан/trudan&quot; is a valid expression of &quot;difficult&quot; in most Serbian dialects, especially Torlakian - see &quot;trud&quot; (effort) and hence cannot be a true false friend with Bulgarian. It is an archaism, but it is a part of the language.

In Ukrainian language &quot;любити&quot; means &quot;to love&quot; as well as &quot;to like&quot;.--[[User:Kovtun|Kovtun]] ([[User talk:Kovtun|talk]]) 16:42, 26 January 2009 (UTC)

== Map none ?? ==

I don't understand why the name of this &quot;Semasiological map for lubyt&quot; has it's own name: &quot;Map none&quot;?
Much of other items without any relationship are pointing here! I suppose &quot;Map none&quot; should be some art of void map but not this! --[[User:Kychot|Kychot]] ([[User talk:Kychot|talk]]) 14:17, 7 January 2009 (UTC)

It's removed now. --[[User:Kovtun|Kovtun]] ([[User talk:Kovtun|talk]]) 18:53, 28 January 2009 (UTC)

Czech líbít means &quot;to like&quot;, but líbát means &quot;to kiss&quot;, for me both are the false friends, and I would add the &quot;to kiss&quot; meaning too, on Czech Republic</text>

'''Sow thistle''' (less commonly '''hare thistle''' or '''hare lettuce''') is the common name for a number of related annual herbs in the Genus '''''Sonchus''''', the ancient Greek name for these plants. Sow thistles are common roadside plants, and while native to Eurasia and tropical Africa, they are found almost worldwide in temperate regions. In some regions sow thistles are known as &quot;milk thistles&quot;, although a true milk thistle is placed in a different genus.

==Description==
All are characterized by soft, somewhat irregularly lobed leaves that clasp the stem and, at least initially, form a basal rosette. The stem contains a milky sap. Flower heads are yellow and range in size from half to one inch in diameter; the florets are all of ray type. 

Mature sow thistle stems can range from 30 cm to 2 m (1 to 6 feet) tall, depending upon species and growing conditions. Colourations range from green to purple in older plants. Sow thistles exude a milky latex when any part of the plant is cut or damaged, and it is from this fact that the plants obtained the common name, &quot;sow thistle&quot;, as they were fed to lactating sows in the belief that milk production would increase.

==Growing Conditions==
Widely adaptable to soils, full sun.

==Varieties==
''[[../Sonchus asper/]]'' - spiny sow thistle&lt;br&gt;
''[[../Sonchus arvensis/]]'' - field or perennial sow thistle&lt;br&gt;
''[[../Sonchus dregeanus/]]''&lt;br&gt;
''[[../Sonchus integrifolius/]]''&lt;br&gt;
''[[../Sonchus nanus/]]''&lt;br&gt;
''[[../Sonchus oleraceus/]]'' - common sow thistle&lt;br&gt;
''[[../Sonchus wilmsii/]]'' - milk thistle

==Uses==
The plant has been used as a stockfeed and particularly as a feed for rabbits, hence the other common names of &quot;hare thistle&quot; or &quot;hare lettuce&quot;. The plant is also edible by humans as a leaf vegetable; old leaves and stalks can be bitter, but young leaves have a flavour similar to lettuce. Going by the name ''puha'' it is frequently eaten in New Zealand as a vegetable, particularly by the native Māori. When cooked it tastes similar to chard.

==Maintenance==
In many areas sow thistles are considered a noxious weed, as they grow quickly in a wide range of conditions, and their wind-bourne seeds allow them to spread rapidly.  ''Sonchus arvensis'', the perennial sow thistle, is considered the most economically detrimental, as it can crowd commercial crops, is a heavy consumer of nitrogen in soils, and can regrow and sprout additional plants from its creeping roots.

Sow thistles are easily uprooted by hand, and their soft stems present little resistance to slashing or mowing. Most livestock will readily devour sow thistle in preference to grass.

==Pests and Diseases==
Sow thistles are a common host plant for aphids. Gardeners may consider this a benefit or a curse; aphids may spread from sow thistle to other plants, but alternatively the sow thistle can encourage the growth of beneficial predators such as hoverflies. In this regard sow thistles make excellent sacrificial plants.

This book is an annotated text for 3 noteworthy chapters from Fyodor Dostoevsky's book '''The Brothers Karamazov'''. The three chapters considered here are '''The Grand Inquisitor''', '''Rebellion''', and '''The Devil''', which are considered to be some of the most powerful chapters from the book, and some of the most influential chapters in the canon of western literature. Eventually this book could be expanded to include other chapters from this book, although it is unlikely that the entire book will ever be annotated here.

These three chapters revolve around Ivan Karamazov, an educated intellectual and admitted atheist in Russia. The first two chapters also include Alyosha Karamazov, a counter-point to Ivan, who is a monk in training, and is well known for his qualities of compassion, unconditional love, strong faith, and trustworthyness.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Kinetic Energy===
Energy of an object due to the motion of the object. It is represented: KE=1/2mv&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

===Enthalpy versus Entropy===
Enthalpy (H) - heat of a system. Negative enthalpy means that the temperature &lt;u&gt;increases&lt;/u&gt;.
Entropy (S) - randomness of a substance.

===Other Stuff===
Specific heat capacity - number of joules of heat needed to warm 1 gram of a substance by 1K. Water's specific heat, in case you didn't remember, is 4.184J/g.

First Law of Thermodynamics = Law of Conservation of energy

Second Law of Thermodynamics - spontaneous reactions increase entropy (randomness).

===Gibb's Free Energy===
&amp;Delta;G = &amp;Delta;H - T &amp;Delta;S, where T is temperature in Kelvin. If &amp;Delta;G is negative, a reaction is spontaneous. Note that some reactions are always spontaneous, some are never, and some depend on the temperature. Also, H is measured in kJ, and S in J.

The '''first ionization energy''' is the energy required to remove one of the highest-energy electrons from an atom. In general, first ionization energy increases across a period and decreases down a group. In other words, it increases from bottom-left to top-right.

==Phase Diagrams==
All three phases exist at the triple point. Critical point is where the substance is neither gas nor liquid.

==Intermolecular Forces That Cause Ideal Gas Theory to Fail==
*Polar substances - are more positive at one end and more negative at the other. Note that a compound may have polar bonds without being polar as a whole (if the poles cancel out).
*Hydrogen bonding - occurs when hydrogen bonds to N, O, or F. This is what gives water its unusual characteristics (high boiling point,  heat capacity, and heat of vaporization, the fact that ice floats)
*London Dispersion - this occurs in massive, nonpolar substances, where a temporary electron asymmetry creates a dipole.

==Liquids==
*Surface tension is stronger in polar compounds.
*Viscosity is how &quot;sticky&quot; the substance is.
*Capillary action - remember bio class?

==Solids==
*Amorphous solids are just viscous liquids. Very viscous liquids. E.g. Petroleum-derived pitch.
*Crystal lattices are made up of repeated unit cells.
*Metallic solids have a &quot;sea&quot; of decentralized electrons, which is why metals conduct electricity.
*Covalent network solids are basically one huge molecule made from repeating smaller molecules. Examples include (SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Socrates, Plato and Aristotle===

From approximately 600 to 300 BC, Greek philosophers conjectured on a wide range of topics relating to what we now consider psychology.  For example, Socrates and his followers, Plato and  Aristotle wrote about pleasure, pain, knowledge, motivation, rationality, among other topics.  They theorized about such things as whether human traits are innate or the product of experience, which continues to be a topic of debate even today.  They also considered the origins of mental illness, with both Socrates and Plato focusing on psychological forces as the root of the such illnesses.

===Descartes and mind-body dualism===

René Descartes was a French mathematician and philosopher from the 1600s.  He theorized that the body and mind are separate entities.  The body was viewed as a physical entity and the mind as a spiritual entity.  Descartes believed that the two interacted only through a tiny structure at the base of the brain called the pineal gland.  His position of the mind and body as separate entities became known as '''dualism'''.  According to dualism, the body's behavior is scientifically measureable, however the mind is not, as it transcends the material world.

===Hobbes and Locke's monism===
Thomas Hobbes and John Locke were English philosophers who disagreed with the concept of dualism.  They argued that all human experiences are physical processes occurring within the brain and nervous system.  Thus, their argument was that sensations, images, thoughts and feelings are all valid subjects of study.  As this view holds that the mind and body are one and the same, it later became known as  '''monism'''.  Today, most psychologists reject a rigid dualist position since many years of research has indicated that the physical and mental aspects of human experience are intertwined. The fields of psychoneuroimmunology and behavioral medicine explicitly focus on this interconnection.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Franz Anton Mesmer===

In reading the history of Franz Anton Mesmer’s life, it is unclear as to whether to conclude that he was truly one of the foreparents of clinical psychology or no more than a quack. However, at least three things are certain: he delighted, offended, and mesmerized. Psychology was influenced by various theories throughout history that have no scientific foundation, including the beliefs of this Viennese physician of the 18th century. This section will outline some of the history of Mesmer and discuss how various personal factors in his life may have contributed to his beliefs and practices. There will also be some contemplation as to how his work has contributed to psychology.

Franz Anton Mesmer was born in May of 1734 or 1735 in Europe, on the German-Swiss border in Lake Constance. He was raised in a Swiss-German family in a small town called Iznang, and was the third of a family of nine children. Not much seems to be known about his parents, except that his father was a gamekeeper and forest warden. It has therefore been said that his parents were able to afford a decent and modest lifestyle for the family. Both of his parents were very strong Catholics and tried to encourage the young Mesmer into the priesthood. After studying at the Jesuit universities of Dilligen and Ingolstadt, Mesmer took up the study of medicine at the University of Vienna in 1759. His doctoral dissertation was entitled, “On the Influence of the Planets on the Human Body”, which relied largely on Newton’s theories of the tides. It has been suggested that Mesmer plagiarized his dissertation from a work by Richard Mead (1673-1754), an English physician who was friends with Newton (Pattie, 1994).

Mesmer argued that certain tides in the human body might be accounted for by the movements of the sun and moon (Bloch, 1980). He later added support to this argument in 1774, citing a successful treatment for one of his first clients when he produced an “artificial tide” in her body by having her swallow a solution containing iron and then passing strong magnets over areas of so-called “blockages”. Mesmer believed that illness was caused by an imbalance or blockage of magnetic fluids in the body (Darnton, 1968). Mesmer claimed that his patients would fall into a trance and awaken from it feeling better. Today, Mesmer’s technique, known as mesmerism, is regarded as an early forerunner of modern hypnosis.  

Some believe that hypnosis has been around for well over 6,000 years, dating back to prehistoric times. Ancient Egyptians, Romans, Greeks, Persians, Chinese, and Samarians, among many other ancient cultures, are documented as having used hypnosis as a therapeutic tool. Prior to the 18th century, the phenomenon of hypnosis hadn’t ever been brought into the general population. Although it wasn’t known as “hypnosis” at the time, Mesmer had remarkable success healing patients, relying on his own instincts in effecting his cures (Gould, 1991).  Interestingly, while he did manage to “cure” many patients, mainly all pretty young ladies, it is said that his elderly wife remained ill.    

It wasn’t until approximately 1776 that Mesmer observed a priest who effected cures without the use of magnets, but by manipulation alone. This led him to discard the magnets and suppose that some kind of life force resided in himself that he could use to influence others. He believed that this force permeated the universe and more especially affected the nervous system of men. He was quite flamboyant in his healings and people crowded to him, with patients coming from far and wide to get treatment or a cure for their ailments. However, the medical community treated Mesmer as an eccentric outsider due to his unorthodox beliefs and methods.  By 1779, he had built a reputation for himself as an occultist and in 1784, after an investigation initiated by the French government, a prestigious committee of scientists concluded that the effects of Mesmer’s therapy were attributable to the power of suggestion, not the power of “animal magnetism” (McNally, 1999). He was therefore labeled as a fraud because there was no proof that he had discovered a new physical fluid. There didn’t appear to be any contention over the fact that Mesmer’s treatments often worked. It was concluded by a French Royal Commission set up by Louis XVI that the effects of Mesmer’s treatments were derived from either the imaginations of his patients or through charlatanry (Léger, 1846). Not much is known about what Mesmer did in the last 20 years of his life, however it has been suggested that he traveled about Europe, settling in his native Germany, and that he continued to practice animal magnetism for friends and neighbors until he died in 1815. 

The most important of Mesmer’s many disciples was Armand de Puységur (1751-1825), who arrived at the recognition that magnetic effects depended on the magnetizer’s personal belief in the efficacy of cure, desire to cure, and rapport with the patient. These ideas formed the basis of his work, “Mémoires pour servir a l’histoire et a l’éstablissement due magnétisme animal”, a work considered the point of origin of modern psychotherapy. It is important to note that right from the inception of psychotherapeutic procedure, it was recognized that belief in the efficacy of cure, desire to cure, and the nature of the therapeutic relationship between therapist and client were fundamental factors in psychotherapeutic success. 

There were various factors that impacted Mesmer’s beliefs and practices. First of all, he was trained as a physician and therefore was interested in wellness and healing people from illness. Second, his parents were very strong Catholics and they encouraged him into the priesthood. In addition, he studied at Jesuit universities before taking up the study of medicine. Mesmer’s beliefs around a “life force” within him that he could impart to others by way of his hands to effect healing is a very Christian concept. Innumerable passages could be quoted from the sacred books of Christianity in support of the practice of healing “by the laying on of hands”.  This was said to be common among the Jews and was practiced by the founder of Christianity and his immediate followers with reportedly marvelous results. For example, the Bible states, “Lay hands upon the sick and they shall recover” (Mark xvi. 18), “The Lord granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands” (Acts xiv. 3), and “Joshua was full of the spirit of wisdom, because Moses had laid his hands upon him (Numbers xxvii, 18, 23).  In Christianity, spiritual powers, gifts of healing, prophecy, and leadership were also conveyed by the laying on of hands. Given Mesmer’s background growing up in a very strong Catholic family, it is no wonder that he abandoned his technique of using magnets to heal and turned to the use of his hands, especially when in 1776 he observed a priest who effected cures with his hands. Furthermore, I would argue that his Christian upbringing likely also contributed to his misogynistic view that this “life force” to effect healing resided only in men.

Despite his shortcomings, Mesmer contributed to psychology in various ways. First, he understood that illness is not natural. The source of illness is not always in the physical body and some kind of blockage, whether it be tangible or not, will inevitably yield stagnation and sickness. Today we know that depression, anxiety and other psychological symptoms can contribute to physical sensations and a sense of being physically unwell. Today we also have an understanding of psychosomatic illness. Another important contribution was Mesmer’s recognition of the unconscious, although he did not speak of it as such. He experienced the power of the unconscious in that he contributed to the discovery of the hypnotic state, which can be a powerful therapeutic tool in therapy. Although he was labeled a fraud on the basis that there was no proof that he had discovered a new physical fluid, it is an important finding just the same that his clients were cured on the basis of suggestion. This is important in terms of how the psychological relates to the physical. Another contribution to psychology is that Mesmer sought to be both a scientist and a practitioner, and that this model of the dual role of a therapist is important for therapists working in psychology today. Finally, Mesmer mentored an important figure in the history of psychology who recognized that the belief in the efficacy of cure, desire to cure and the therapeutic relationship were fundamental factors in successfully working with clients in therapy. These beliefs are central to the practice of clinical psychology in our world today.

In conclusion, it is still unclear as to whether Mesmer was truly one of the foreparents of clinical psychology or just a quack. Despite the fact that his theories had no scientific foundation, such is often the reality in the field of psychology in that phenomenon experienced by our clients isn’t always easily testable.  There is no doubt that Mesmer is a curious figure in the history of psychology. He contributed to our awareness of the unconscious, hypnosis and the relationship between psychology and health. At the very least, he has contributed his inquisitiveness and modeled his stance as a scientist and practitioner in undertaking to improve the qualities of the lives of others. Such qualities have thankfully become the hallmark of prominent practitioners of psychology today.

===Franz Joseph Gall===

In the late 18th and 19th centuries, Franz Joseph Gall developed '''phrenology''', a theory that psychological traits and abilities reside in certain parts of the brain and can be identified and measured by the bumps and indentations of the skull. Although some of his ideas did not have empirical support, research later confirmed the more general point that certain mental activities can be traced to specific parts of the brain.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Wundt and his two psychologies===

Wilhem Maximilian Wundt is generally recognized as the founder of experimental psychology, although he also contributed to social psychology (psychology of culture - ''Völkerpsychologie''). Wundt was trained in physiology and psychology. His approach to the study of the mind was ground-breaking in that it was based on systematic and rigorous observation, laying the foundation for the modern psychological experiment. He systematically studied topics such as attention span, reaction time, vision, emotion and time perception. 

Wundt's primary method of research was &quot;introspection&quot;.  This involved training people to concentrate and report on their conscious experiences as they reacted to stimuli. This approach is still used today in modern neuroscience research. For instance, Tibetan monks who have trained themselves to be able to sustain attention are asked to keep track of their inner experiences while undergoing neuroimaging (Carter, Presti, Callistemon, Ungerer, Liu, &amp; Pettigrew, 2005). 

Wundt had a very productive career in psychology.  He founded the first laboratory dedicated to the scientific study of the mind, supervised a total of 186 doctoral dissertations, taught thousands of students, founded the first scholarly psychological journal (''Philosophical Studies''), and published a large volume of scientific studies.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Attachment is defined as a social and emotional bond between infant and caregiver that spans both time and space (Carlson, Buskist, Enzle, &amp; Heth, 2002).  

===Animal Studies that Influenced Attachment Theory and Research: Lorenz and Harlow===

The following summarizes animal research conducted by two influential people whose ideas shaped the way later researchers would conceptualize attachment in human beings; [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konrad_Lorenz Konrad Lorenz’s] (1903-1989) and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Harlow Harry Frederick Harlow (1905-1981)]. In particular, researchers credited for founding the theory and research behind attachment, John Bowlby and Mary Ainsworth, considered the following research with animals to inform their own work with human beings.  

In 1937, Konrad Lorenz conducted research with goslings, which supported ethological ideas of attachment.  He observed the behaviour of newly born goslings, which would follow or ‘imprint’ on almost any moving object (e.g. mother, duck, or even human being) (Shaffer, Wood &amp; Willoughby, 2002).  Lorenz reported that imprinting was automatic and did not need to be taught, and that this behaviour occurs within a critical period after birth, and that gosling remain attached to the particular object (Shaffer, Wood &amp; Willoughby, 2002).  Lorenz explains:

:…goslings following responses become imprinted “to geese” or “to humans,” but it is still an intriguing puzzle which particular stimulus situation represents each of these concepts.  The human-imprinted gosling will unequivocally refuse to follow a goose instead of a human, but it will not differentiate between a petite, slender young girl and a big old man with a beard (Lorenz, 1965)

Lorenz goes on to explain:

:During the first two days after leaving the nest, the gosling follows the parent about and there is a second tremendous increase in the selectivity of its following response. By that time, it has learned to recognize the parents personally and will never mistake another pair of geese for them… (Lorenz, 1965)

This idea of imprinting influenced Bowlby’s theory of attachment in humans. In 1956 he wrote about his support for the ecological view of attachment over the opposing and more popular views held by learning theorists and psychoanalysis:

:Two views are now current. One, which is held by all those of the learning theory school…held by many psychoanalysts…that the infant's only primary needs are the physiological ones for food, warmth and so on, and that, insofar as he becomes emotionally attached to his mother, it is because he learns that she is the agent through whom his physiological needs are satisfied...The alternative view is that the infant's need to attach himself to a mother-figure is as primary as his need to take nourishment or to prefer warmth to cold. This implies the existence of a primary socially-oriented drive, basically independent of the need for food or warmth. This view is held by the group of European students of animal behaviour headed by Lorenz and Tinbergen...Pending the results of this, it is the second hypothesis which seems to me the more likely to prove right. It is plain that the infant is endowed with at least two innate responses which have a social significance, namely crying and smiling… (Bowlby, 1956).

Mary Ainsworth who worked closely with Bowlby, admitted that Bowlby’s interest in an evolutionary and ethological approach to attachment initially made her “uneasy”, and that she had asked him to reconsider this theoretical position (Ainsworth, 1983).  It was only after Ainsworth conducted the very first empirical study on attachment that she reconsidered this position.  

Bowlby and Ainsworth’s ideas regarding attachment were also influenced and supported by research conducted by Harry Harlow in the late 1950’s.  Harlow conducted many studies examining the effects of rhesus monkeys separated from their mothers at birth. His most popular study entailed examining the behaviour of infant monkeys who were raised by two surrogate mothers from birth; a “wire” mother and a “cloth” mother.  This research demonstrated that regardless of which mother the monkeys received nourishment from they continually sought comfort and safety from the cloth constructed surrogate mother (Shaffer, Wood &amp; Willoughby, 2002).  

Of particular interest to Ainsworth, were Harlow’s findings regarding his monkey subjects behaviour in the presence of the cloth mother, in which he explains, “…it as if the cloth mother provides the infant with a sense of security, releasing positive responses of exploration and play…” (Harlow, 1961).  Harlow’s findings supported Ainsworth’s own ideas regarding a caregiver’s role as a secure base for their infant.

This brief description of Konrad Lorenz’s and Harry Harlow’s animal research demonstrates their influence on attachment research and ideas that are still prominent today. In particular, ideas surrounding an infants need to form an attachment with their caregiver, and how that attachment influences subsequent development.

===John Bowlby (1907-1990)===

=====Early Biographical History=====
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bowlby John Bowlby] was born in 1907 in London, England to an upper-middle class family. His parents, especially his father, were described as “remote” and largely “inaccessible”, and his relationship with them was considered “distant” (Coates, 2004). The caregiving for Bowlby and his siblings was provided primarily by nannies, as this was custom among families of their class (referred to as haute bourgeoisie) and generation. Bowlby had two older sisters, and two brothers (one older and one younger). The elder brother, Anthony, (who was only 13 months older than Bowlby) was considered their mother’s clear favourite. He appeared gifted intellectually, became a successful industrialist and inherited their father’s name. John and Anthony were treated as twins – dressed in matching clothes and placed in the same classroom. Bowlby made attempts to overpower his brother, who remained determined to exert his advantage over his younger counterpart. Their younger brother, Jim, seemed to display possible intellectual limitations and struggled throughout his life. Bowlby’s competitiveness combined with his concern for disadvantaged children may have its roots in his position between his two brothers. Bowlby was quite protective of Jim, especially when he was bullied by their older brother. When this occurred, Bowlby was especially outraged over the apparent lack of sensitivity that Anthony displayed towards their younger brother (Brandell &amp; Ringell, 2007).  

Bowlby’s mother held the view that spoiling children was “dangerous”, and so she regularly blocked any attempts by the children to elicit attention and affection from her (van Dijken, 1997).  Their mother had confided to friends that she never worried about her children and felt comfortable leaving them to their own devices. She received reports about her children from their nanny who was responsible for all daily care-taking duties (e.g., bathing, feeding, etc.). Their mother would “visit” with the children from 5 to 6 PM daily, after tea, where she would read to them (Holmes, 1993). She seemed to spend more time with her children during their summers, which were spent on the Isle of Skye.

As a preschooler, Bowlby shared a close relationship with his nanny who served as his primary caretaker. However, when he was almost four-years-old, she left the family. Bowlby would later write: “for a child to be looked after entirely by a loving nanny and then for her to leave when he is two or three, or even four or five, can be almost as tragic as the loss of a mother” (Bowlby, 1958, quoted in van Dijken, 1997, p. 25).  At the age of eight, Bowlby was sent to a boarding school with his older brother, which coincided with their father being sent off to war.  Bowlby has reported feeling very unhappy throughout his stay at the school. In later years, he told his wife that he would not send even a “dog” away from home at such a young age (Coates, 2004): “Unhappiness in a child accumulates because he sees no end to the dark tunnel. The thirteen weeks of a term might just as well be thirteen years” (Bowlby, 1973, p. 3, quoted in Coates, 2004, p. 574).  These experiences appear to have shaped the development of Bowlby's ideas on the impact of parenting and early experiences on children. In particular, he loathed traditional English child-rearing patterns of the time, which emphasized the denial of love and affection to children so as not to spoil them. 

Although he initially chose to study medicine at Cambridge, Bowlby became interested in working with children and left his studies after one year to volunteer at a small analytically-oriented residential institution for maladjusted and delinquent children. Bowlby came to view this experience as the single-most valuable learning opportunity in his life (van Dijken 1997). Bowlby was drawn to the plight of two children in particular. One of these children was an isolated, withdrawn child who was expelled from school due to theft. Bowlby wrote how this child had never experienced a stable relationship with a mother figure. The other child was a anxious boy who became quite attached to Bowlby and followed him around like a shadow. Both of these children had experienced the loss of their mother, and it is through working with them that Bowlby was sensitized to the effects of maternal deprivation on children's development and well-being (Karen, 1998). His experiences with these two boys would lead Bowlby to reconsider his career goals. Specifically, Bowlby would return to medical school but chose to train as a child psychiatrist. He subsequently attended the British Psychoanalytic clinic where he trained with Melanie Klein.

Through his training in psychoanalysis (and his experience with his own analyst), Bowlby came to view analysts (including Melanie Klein) as overly focused on the child’s inner fantasy life (e.g., conflicts between aggressive and libidinal drives) and overlooking actual events and experiences in the child’s real life. Bowlby argued for a greater emphasis on the role of interactions with parents in shaping a child’s personality, and speculated that the origins of these interactions were in the parents’ early experiences with their own parents. 

In 1936, Bowlby began working at the London Child Guidance Clinic where he studied behaviour and emotional disturbances among children raised in institutions. He found that many of these children were largely &quot;affectionless&quot;. In other words, they were unable to love because they had not formed a solid attachment to a mother figure early in life. Brandell and Ringell (2007) note that Bowlby's observations took place in England during World War II at a time when families were losing fathers who went to fight in the war. The family members who remained experienced tremendous financial difficulties, leading parents to abandon their infants to be raised in hospitals and institutions. Beginning in the late 1930’s, Bowlby would publish several papers on the effects of maternal separation and loss on children. Specifically, Bowlby argued that “psychological deprivation” (due to maternal deprivation) as a opposed to economic, nutritional, or medical deprivation was the primary source of maladjustment in children (Coates, 2004).

=====Maternal Deprivation=====

The impact of maternal deprivation (through loss of the mother due to death or separation) on children was first outlined by John Bowlby in a series of studies published in the 1940’s and early 1950’s. Bowlby claimed that maternal deprivation produces disadvantageous physical, intellectual, behavioural, and emotional outcomes in the developing child. In “Child care and the Growth of Love” (1953), Bowlby presents his own studies of juvenile delinquents in addition to observations by others (including Anna Freud) of children raised in institutions and residential nurseries. He studies “the harm done” to these children using direct observations and through examining their early histories, referred to as retrospective studies. Based on these data, Bowlby concluded that children deprived of maternal care are likely to experience far-reaching disadvantages compared to children who are raised by their mothers. Specifically, children raised in institutions were found to display stunted physical development and delayed language development. As they grew older, their ability to form stable relationships with others was noticeably impaired. Based on his observations, Bowlby argued that “prolonged separation of a child from his mother (or mother substitute) during the first five years of life stands foremost among the causes of delinquent character development” (Bowlby, 1944, quoted in Holmes, 1993).  Moreover, even brief separations during the first five years of life were considered by Bowlby to have detrimental implications for the child over the course of the lifespan. Bowlby's findings concerning the effects of maternal deprivation would form the basis of his pioneering contributions to attachment theory. 

=====Contributions to Attachment Theory=====

Bowlby is considered to have provided the most comprehensive and influential account of attachment formation. His contributions are heavily influenced by ethology, including an emphasis on the evolutionary origins and biological purposes of behaviour. 

The young child, according to Bowlby, is “biologically biased” to develop attachments to its caretakers as a result of its genetic endowment. A close bond with the caretaker ensures survival, especially in times when the presence of a predator meant certain danger. Thus, the attachment bond is as important to the species as other inborn behaviour systems such as feeding and mating. In order for the infant to survive, he or she must be able to activate and maintain the parents’ proximity. These include attachment responses such as crying, clinging, and following. These are only effective if the parent reciprocates the child’s behaviour. Thus, a complimentary parental attachment system is believed to have developed over the course of evolution. Presently, attachment behaviour continues to be activated by perceived danger, and it is terminated by perceived safety. The biological function of attachment is the protection of the young, and the psychological function is to provide security. Thus, infants are “genetically wired” to maintain proximity to the mother and to signal to her for attention and help at times of distress. In turn, mothers are programmed to respond to such signals. 

Bowlby also contributed the concept of internal working models. These begin to form as children become better able to represent the world to themselves in symbolic form (generally around 2 years old). They begin to form models of themselves, of significant others and of the relationships they have with others. These models eventually come to guide the child’s actions by helping the child anticipate another’s actions and plan an appropriate behavioural response. Internal working models are built up on the basis of experience with a particular attachment figure and reflect the quality of the relationship with that figure. The repeated experience of bonding with a warm, accepting mother contributes to the formation of an internal working model in which the child views the mother as a source of security and support. In turn, the child will expect the mother to be predictably available as a secure base and will develop positive emotions towards her. Such expectations are then likely to be transferred to other people. Once formed, the model is imposed like a template on new interactions. Moreover, the child’s model of the self is also largely built up through the first attachment relationship: a child who experienced a punitive and rejecting mother will develop a sense of failure and lack of self-worth. If the self is not acceptable in the eyes of the attachment figure, this will undermine the child’s own self-image. In the absence of sensitive and responsive caregiving, the child will come to view others as untrustworthy and the world as unsafe. Thus, working models of the self, others, and the world develop in unison.

===Mary Ainsworth (1913-1999)===

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Ainsworth Mary Ainsworth] was born Mary Dinsmore Salter, on December 1st, 1913 in Glendale Ohio.  Mary Ainsworth grew up and obtained all her formal education in Toronto, Ontario (Bretherton, 2003).  Mary’s academic, professional, and personal decisions would continually lead her in the direction of attachment research.  This direction would follow her into her seventy-sixth year when she completed her final empirical attachment study, and months before her death at the age of eighty-five, when she was honored by the APA for Lifetime Achievements in the Science of Psychology (Main, 1999).  

'''Education'''

In an autobiography, Mary explains that she first realized she wanted to become a psychologist in her last year of high-school, at 15-years-old.  After reading ''Character and the Conduct of Life (1928)'' by William McDougall, Mary explains:

:It had not previously occurred to me that one might look within oneself for some explanation of how one felt and behaved, rather than feeling entirely at the mercy of external forces. What a vista that opened up! I decided thereupon to become a psychologist. (Ainsworth, 1983, p. 201)

Mary Ainsworth completed her undergraduate and graduate studies at the University of Toronto, in 1935 and 1939, respectively (American Psychological Foundation (APF), 1998).  Mary’s doctoral dissertation was entitled “An Evaluation of Adjustment Based on the Concept of Security”, in which she is noted as stating, “Where family security is lacking, the individual is handicapped by lack of a secure base from which to work” (Main, 1999, p. 683).  This experience set the stage for Mary’s later work in attachment, where the idea of an infant using their caregiver as a ‘secure base’ became a central component.

After completing her graduate work, Mary continued to work at the University of Toronto as a lecturer until 1942, when she was commissioned into the Canadian Women’s Army Corp (APF, 1999).  Joining the Army was Mary’s choice, as she explains she was, “no longer content to be away from all the action …” (Ainsworth, 1983, p. 206).  With this experience, Mary obtained expertise in clinical work, such as interviewing, history taking, and test administration (Bretherton, 2003).  In 1946, she returned from her army work, and accepted a professor assistantship with the University of Toronto.  Mary also co-directed a research team with her former doctoral supervisor, Dr. Blatz (Bretherton, 2003).  It is within this research team that she met a graduate student, Leonard Ainsworth, who she married in 1950 (Bretherton, 2003).  
 
'''London, England'''

The newly married couple decided to relocate to London, England, where Leonard would carry out his doctoral dissertation at University College.  When Mary arrived in London she reconnected with a colleague she had met while in the Army, Edith Mercer, who directed her attention to a job advertisement in the ''London Times''. This was a research position at Tavistock Clinic working with John Bowlby investigating the effects of maternal separation on infant personality development.  Mary applied for this job, was interviewed and hired.  Mary would later state that, “…Edith Mercer and a newspaper advertisement reset the whole direction of my research career” (Ainsworth, 1983, p. 208).  

While working at Bowlby’s clinic Mary worked closely with James Robertson, who greatly influenced the way she would continue to collect data throughout her professional career.  Robertson had previously trained under Anna Freud, and received thorough instruction on child observation, which included taking extensive narratives during naturalistic observation (Bretherton, 1992).  Mary was impressed by Robertson’s methods, and would continue to emulate them in her own work.  

'''Uganda'''

In 1953 Mary and Leonard Ainsworth relocated to Uganda. It was here that Mary performed the very first empirical attachment study (1955-1956).  This was a short term longitudinal naturalistic study in which Mary employed Robertson’s extensive recording methods.   Mary concluded from this study that, “Attachment is not present at birth, but, however it emerges gradually…” (Ainsworth, 1967, p. 430).  It was also during this study that Ainsworth revisited the ideas present in her dissertation regarding ‘secure base’, and started uncovering the crucial role of ''maternal sensitivity'' in infant attachment (Ainsworth, 1967; Bretherton, 2003).  

'''Baltimore'''

Upon arriving in Baltimore (1955), Mary worked as a clinician, and a lecturer in clinical and developmental psychology at Johns Hopkins University.  During this time, in 1960, Mary and Leonard divorced, she recounts this experience as a “personal disaster”, and explains that “a depressive reaction to divorce led me to seek professional help, which culminated into an eight-year psychoanalytic experience” (Ainsworth, 1983, p.  210).  It was reported that through her experience in psychoanalysis she also became more ‘energized’ and ‘enthusiastic’ about her work, and therefore began to work more frequently (Main, 1999).  Ainsworth herself claimed that psychoanalysis, “was the most important positive influence” on her career (Ainsworth, 1983, p. 210).  
	
It was in Baltimore that Mary published her Uganda results, with encouragement from Bowlby.  She also worked on a new empirical study to replicate her earlier findings.  This study included extensive observations (72 hours per dyad) spanning over the period of the first 54 weeks of an infants life with their mother (Bretherton, 2003).  It was during this time that Mary developed a lab procedure, which is still well known and still used to classify attachment in infants, the ''Strange Situation''.  Within this procedure, Mary witnessed unexpected behavioural patterns when examining reunions between infants and their mothers after brief separations.  This procedure again made Mary re-examine the caregiver as a ‘secure base’ for infants.  Support for her ideas and how to classify them within the strange situation were influenced by Harlow’s research with monkeys, in which his monkey subjects performed more exploratory behaviours in the presence of the ‘cloth mother’ versus a ‘wire mother’.  She also developed the avoidant and ambivalent attachment classifications which are still well known today.  In all, Mary was pleased with the Baltimore study, stating, “This research has turned out to be everything I had hoped it would be, and it has drawn together all the threads of my professional career” (Ainsworth, 1983, p. 211).

Findings lending support to Bowlby’s theories were influential in changing recommendations to existing parental practices, replacing ideas initially set out by learning theorist (Bretherton, 2003).  Mary’s attachment research was highly controversial in the late 1970’s and therefore not always accepted.  She was accused of being “out of touch with current changes in lifestyles” and not supporting women’s liberation; however she stated that her belief was that, “…infants are perhaps a million or so years out of touch with them [current lifestyle]” (Ainsworth, 1983, p. 213).  In 1977, the Society for Research in Child and Development (SRCD) rejected a journal submission that summarized her work.  It was not until other researchers began to replicate her work that she started to receive recognition (Bretherton, 2003). Indeed, SRCD, who had originally rejected her ideas, honored her with an ‘Award for Distinguished Contributions to Child Development’, in 1985 (Bretherton, 2003).    

'''Mentor/Researcher'''

Aside from her contributions to attachment research, Mary is also well admired by many students that she mentored in this field.  Ainsworth received the first ‘Mentoring Award’ of the APA’s Division of Developmental Psychology (Bretherton, 2003).  She is also looked upon by current attachment researchers as a 'mentor' and 'hero'(Pederson &amp; Pederson, personal communication, 2006).  Her students remember her as a “lively and robust women” (Main, 1999, p. 682).  Mary Ainsworth did not have any children of her own.  She was known to refer to her graduate students as her family, in which she is quoted as stating, “The most extraordinary thing in my life has been seeing so many people become interested in the concept of attachment and dedicating themselves to developing it further…I think of them as my family” (Bretherton, 2003). In examining Mary Ainsworth’s life it is evident that she was devoted to developing and understanding infant-maternal interactions.  Her work continues to influence current attachment research.  The APA Gold Medal Award for Lifetime Achievement in the Science of Psychology in 1998 was ultimately to recognize her “as one of the major figures of the 20th century in the study of the relations between young children and their caregivers (E.Waters)” (Bretherton, 2003).

===Strange Situation &amp; Patterns of Attachment===

Stranger anxiety and separation anxiety are two infant behaviours in which attachment is revealed (Carlson et al., 2002). Stranger anxiety is a wariness and fearful response (i.e., crying and clinging to caregivers) that infants display when in the presence of an unfamiliar individual.  This behaviour usually surfaces sometime between 6 months and 12 months of age.  Separation anxiety is a fearful response (i.e., crying, arousal and clinging to caregivers) that infants exhibit when a caregiver attempts to leave the infant (Carlson et al., 2002). Separation anxiety first appears at around 6 months of age and peaks around 15 months of age. This pattern of development has been found across several cultures (Kagan, Kearsley,  Zelazo, 1978).  Stranger anxiety and separation anxiety are the bases for Ainsworth’s test of attachment called the Strange Situation. 

The Strange Situation is a test of attachment involving an unfamiliar situation, people, and events developed by Ainsworth and her colleagues (Ainsworth, Blehar, Waters &amp; Wall, 1978) in order to examine the balance of attachment and exploratory behaviours under conditions of high and low levels of stress.  It involves a series of eight episodes, each lasting for approximately 3 minutes, during which an infant/child is exposed to events (i.e., separation anxiety and stranger anxiety) that are designed to elicit some distress related to attachment and security.  It also allows the observation of the infants’ reactions to comforting by both the caregiver and stranger.  The Strange Situation is based on the fact that if an infant has developed a secure attachment with his or her caregiver, then he or she will use the caregiver as a secure base from which to explore the unfamiliar environment.  By evaluating the infant’s behaviours during the Strange Situation, researchers are able to determine the type of attachment between infant and caregiver.  

A typical strange situation has 8 episodes as follows (taken from Shaffer, Wood, &amp; Willoughby, 2002) :
*1. Experimenter introduces parent and infant to the playroom and then leaves.
*2. Parent sits while infant plays with toys. (Parent as a secure base)
*3. Stranger enters, sits, and talks to parent. (Stranger anxiety)
*4. Parent leaves, stranger offers comfort if the infant is upset. (Separation anxiety)
*5. Parent returns, greets infant, and offers comfort if infant is upset.  Stranger leaves. (Reunion behaviours)
*6. Parent leaves room. (Separation anxiety)
*7. Stranger enters and offers comfort. (Ability to be soothed by stranger)
*8. Parent returns, greets infant, offers comfort if necessary, and tries to interest infant in toys. (Reunion behaviours)
''* Note: All episodes except for the first episode last 3 minutes. However, if infants become extremely upset, separation episodes may be shortened and reunion episodes extended.'' 

Ainsworth identified three patterns of attachment: secure, resistant and avoidant.  '''Secure attachment''', the ideal pattern of attachment, is found in approximately 7 in 10 infants (Myers &amp; Spencer, 2001).  It is characterized by the infants showing a distinct preference for their caregiver over the stranger.  When the caregiver returns in the room, the infant will seek comfort and will be able to be calmed by the caregiver.  The infant is usually outgoing with strangers while the mother is present. Caregivers of securely attached infants tend to respond promptly to their crying, reacting sensitively and appropriately.

Infants with '''resistant attachment''' show signs of tension in their relationship with their caregiver.  They stay close to their caregiver before he or she leaves the room but exhibit both approach and avoidance behaviours when the caregiver returns.  For instance, they may continue to show signs of distress, such as crying, when the caregiver returns in the room and may even push their caregiver away if the caregiver attempts to comfort them.  These infants are usually quite wary of strangers, even when their mother is present.  Resistant attachments are usually formed when caregivers are impatient with their infants and spend little time interacting with them (Carlson et al., 2002) 

Infants with '''avoidant attachment''' usually do not show a distinct preference between their caregiver and the stranger.  They tend to not to show distress when they are left alone and will most likely avoid or ignore their caregiver upon his or her return.  These patterns of attachment are found in approximately 2 in 10 infants (Myers &amp; Spencer, 2001). These infants are often quite sociable with strangers, however, they may sometimes ignore them in the same way that they ignore their caregiver. Avoidant attachment patterns are usually formed when caregivers are insensitive to their infant’s needs (Carlson et al., 2002).    
 
As older children (i.e., over the age of 2) become less stressed by brief separations with their caregivers and encounters with strangers, the strange situation is not as useful for characterizing the attachments of older children.  The Attachment Q-set (AQS) is an alternative assessment of attachment quality that can be used with children from age 1 to 5 years.  It requires a parent or trained observer to sort a set of 90 descriptors of attachment-related behaviours (e.g., &quot;Child greets mother with big smiles&quot;) into categories ranging from &quot;most like&quot; to &quot;least like&quot; the childs behaviours in order to gain a profile that reprsents how secure the child is.  The Q-set has been found to be concordant with the strange situation attachment classification system (Pederson &amp; Moran, 1996).

''Mary Main &amp; The AAI''

Mary Main was one of Mary Ainsworth's students.  In 1986 she identified a group of children more distrubed than the others and who did not fit Ainsworth's original 3 categories of attachment.  She termed this fourth category of attachment'''&quot;disoriented/disorganized&quot;''' (Main &amp; Soloman, 1990).  Children who fit this attachment pattern demonstrated behaviours associated with both resistant and avoidant children in an unpredictable manner.  This attachment pattern is said to characterize 5 to 10 percent of North American infants (Shaffer, Wood &amp; Willoughby, 2002). Infants with this pattern of attachment appear to be the most troubled.  They react to their caregiver in contradictory ways.  For example, they might stop crying when held by their caregiver yet become rigid, turn their head away from their caregiver and show no emotion.  Main reported that many of the mothers of disoriented children had been victims of trauma or had experienced losses in early childhood which were unresolved.  She believed that the mothers anxiety and fearfulness were transmitted to the infant as a result.  Disoriented attachments have also been reported to be found in the majority of abused infants (Carlson et al., 1989).

Main also contributed to the field of attachment by developing the '''Adult Attachment Interview''' (AAI) at the University of California at Berkley (Main &amp; Goldwyn, 1993).  The AAI is an interview that contains 20 questions which ask about one's experiences with parents and other attachment figures.  The AAI also asks questions relating to significant losses in one's life, trauma, and experiences with their own children.  It takes approximately 60 to 90 minutes to administer and is then scored by a trained person.  The scoring process is complicated, requiring 2 weeks of intensive training followed by 18 months of reliability training for a research to be properly trained.  When scoring the interview, the overall coherence of the subject's responses are analyzed.

Main's original purpose in developing the AAI was to translate Ainsworth's infant-mother attachment patterns into corresponding adult patterns.  The AAI classifies an adult into one of the following three categories of attachment:

*Autonomous-secure (adult provided a clear and coherent account of early attachments, whether or not these attachments were satisfying or not)

* Preoccupied (adult spoke of conflicted childhood memories about attachment but did not draw them together into an organized, consistent picture)

* Dismissing (adult had an inability to recollect much about attachment relationships in childhood.  When specific memories were recalled, they suggested episodes of rejection)

===Father-Child Relationships and Attachment===

Although there has been a tendency in the past to focus on the mother-child relationship when discussing the concept of attachment, the role of fathers and the impact that they can have on children's attachment styles is becoming an increasingly popular area of interest.  As traditional gender roles have changed over the last 30 years, more mothers are obtaining employment outside of the home and more fathers are taking on an active parenting role within the home (Dacey &amp; Travers, 1996).  This has called into question whether or not infants actually do react differently to each of their parents. ''Do the types of relationships and attachment styles that develop between parent and child differ for mothers and fathers?''

Research exploring the similarity of mother and child attachment and father and child attachment reveals that there is no clear answer to this question, as several studies have come up with opposing results.  When exploring the styles of attachment that develop between fathers and their children, Bowlby (1988) noted that the styles that emerge are very similar to the styles of attachment that form between mothers and their children.  However, Bowlby also noted that, within the same family, there is no correlation &quot;between the attachment patterns for each parent&quot; (Dacey &amp; Travers, 1996, 147).  That is, mother and infant may be securely attached while father and infant may not or vice versa.  Research shows that infants are more socially responsive when they are securely attached to both the mother and the father.  Furthermore, there is evidence to suggest that a secure attachment with the father may buffer the potentially negative effects of an insecure mother-infant attachment (Shaffer, Wood &amp; Willoughby, 2002).

=== Cultural Variations and Attachment ===

The development of attachment is strongly influenced by cultural variables in that infant and parent attachment behaviours vary from culture to culture.  For example, a study examining cross-cultural attachment patterns (Harwood, Miller, &amp; Irizarry, 1995) found that Caucasian American mothers emphasize independence, self-reliance and self-confidence in their children as they believed that children should grow up to be self-sustaining individuals.  In contrast, Puerto Rican mothers were found to emphasize respect, courtesy and tact when interacting with their children as they believed children should grow up to be polite and law-abiding citizens.  Research also shows that resistant attachments, characterized by intense separation and stranger anxieties, are much more common in cultures where caregivers rarely leave their infants in substitute care, such as Japan (Shaffer, Wood, &amp; Willoughby, 2002). 

Some researchers argue that what qualifies as a secure or insecure attachment varies across cultures.  For example, a secure attachment in Western societies is characterized by an infant being encouraged to separate themselves from their caregiver in order to explore the environment, and therefore becoming independent and autonomous.  In contrast, Japanese mothers emphasize an infant's total dependence on the mother, causing Japanese babies to exhibit behaviours during separations and reunions that would classify them as insecurely attached when tested in the strange situation.  Yet, these behaviours are exactly what would be considered highly adaptive in Japan because it emphasizes community and interdependence (Shaffer, Wood, &amp; Willoughby, 2002).

===Explanations of Attachment: How Does Attachment Develop?===

Depending on the theoretical stance that one takes to attachment, the mechanism through which the type of relationship that develops between parent and child may differ.  

For example, '''psychoanalytic theorists''', in line with Freud, would argue that infants become attached to those who fulfill their early desires, such as the desire for oral satisfaction.  Infants become attached to their parents, and especially their mothers, because parents are primarily responsible for feeding the infant.  Erikson, also a psychoanalyst, would argue that infants become attached because feeding allows for a sense of trust and security to develop between the mother and infant.

'''Behaviourists''' in line with Skinner, would emphasize the role of reinforcement in attachment.  Different styles of attachment emerge based on how reinforcing the interaction between parent and infant is.  Interactions that include close physcial contact, comforting, and appropriate stimulation (such as visual and vocal interaction) should be positively reinforcing and result in more secure types of attachment.

Although, '''cognitive-developmental theory''' does not offer much in terms of how infants form attachments with their caregivers, this theory does suggest that the ability to form attachments depends on the infant's level of cognitive development.  Specifically, before an attachment can occur, an infant must be able to distinguish familiar individuals from strangers.  Furthermore, an infant must also have &quot;object permanence&quot;, as it would be difficult to become attached to a person who ceases to exist whenever they are out of view (Schaffer, 1971).  It is interesting to note that attachments first emerge at around age 6 to 9 months, which is the same time when infants are entering Piaget's fourth sensorimotor substage when they are first able to search for and locate objects that they've seen someone hide from them (Shaffer, Wood &amp; Willoughby, 2002).

An '''ethological theory''' of attachment stems from Konrad Lorenz's work (1937) on imprinting.  He noted that very young ducklings followed almost any moving object, whether it be their mothers, another animal, or a human.  He termed this behaviour &quot;imprinting&quot;.  He noted that imprinting is automatic in that young goslings do not have to be taught to follow, that it occurs within a critical period after the bird has hatched and is irreversible, in that once the young bird begins to follow a particular object/person, it remains attached to it (Shaffer, Wood &amp; Willoughby, 2002). Lorenz concluded that imprinting was an adaptive response, increasing a young birds chances of survival if they follow their mothers to food.  Arising from Lorenz's work, ethologists believe that many innate behaviours are designed to promote attachments between infants and their caregivers.  The attachment relationship protects young from harm and ensures that their needs are met, permitting one to live long enough to reproduce in order for their species to survive.

===Attachment and Later Development===

It is believed that the type of attachment an infant forms with his or her caregiver has implications for later life (Belsky &amp; Cassidy, 1994), especially in how one forms relationships with others (Waters, Merrick, Treboux, Crowell &amp; Albersheim, 2000).  Securely attached infants are likely to display more favourable developmental outcomes.  Securely attached adults find it easy to get close to others and don’t worry about becoming too dependent or being abandoned (Myers &amp; Spencer, 2001).  They also are more likely to report that their relationships are satisfying and enduring.  Avoidant adults tend to be less invested in relationships and are more likely to leave them (Myers &amp; Spencer, 2001). Avoidant adults have been found to be possessive, jealous and less trusting when in relationships.  They often break up repeatedly with the same person (Myers &amp; Spencer).  Furthermore, among women, insecure attachments are correlated with clinical depression and difficulties in coping with stress (Barnas, Pollina, &amp; Cummings, 1991).

Bowlby (1980, 1988) and Bretherton (1985, 1990) believe that infants use internal working models, or cognitive representations of themselves and other people, to interpret events and form expectations about relationships.  Thus, sensitive, responsive caregiving leads to positive working models that view others as dependable.  Insensitive, neglectful, or abusive caregivieng on the other hand, may lead to negative working models of others, characterized by insecurity and a lack of trust.

===Attachment Application:  Circle of Security Project===

The Circle of Security project (COS) is an example of how years of attachment theory and research is informing current interventions with at-risk caregivers and infants.  The COS project was developed from contemporary attachment theory and is geared towards at-risk toddler, preschoolers and their caregivers (Marvin, Cooper, Hoffman, &amp; Powell, 2002).  

This COS project is a group based intervention. Six caregivers participate in 20 week (1.15 hours per week) sessions with a psychotherapist who leads the group.  Theory and research informs an individualized program for each member in the group, based on the caregiver’s and their child’s attachment patterns. Attachment patterns are assessed prior to the intervention utilizing evidence based attachment procedures (e.g. Strange Situation, Adult Attachment Interview) (Marvin, Cooper, Hoffman, &amp; Powell, 2002).  

The intervention is focused on the caregiver, who is responsible for inducing change in the caregiver-child relationship. Caregivers are introduced to attachment theory in a user-friendly manner (e.g. pictorial graphs). Main constructs introduced examine Ainsworth’s ideas regarding the caregiver as a ‘secure base’ and a ‘haven of safety’ for their child. Parents are trained to identify and repair ‘disrupted’ interactions with their child.  A pre and post intervention study reports successful outcomes; altering disorganized attachment patterns into secure attachment patterns. (Marvin, Cooper, Hoffman, &amp; Powell, 2002).

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Sigmund Freud===
No history of psychology would be complete without acknowledging Viennese physician, Sigmund Freud’s, psychoanalytic approach to understanding child development.

Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) was born in what is now known as the Czech Republic (formerly known as Freiburg). His family relocated to Vienna when he was four years old. Growing up he was attracted to Darwin’s theories and noted that “it was upon hearing Goethe’s beautiful essay ''On Nature''…just before I left school that I decided to become a medical doctor” (Britannica, 1952).  

Freud’s first experimental investigations involved examining the nervous systems of fish.  He later began to conduct research with children experiencing cerebral paralysis.  When Freud was awarded with a traveling fellowship for his work in this field, he decided to pursue a research interest in France with Jean-Martin Charcot, who was using hypnosis to treat many types of mental disorders (Britannica). After this experience, Freud returned to Vienna to work with Joseph Breuer, who was at the time using hypnosis to treat hysteria (a term used to describe an individual who was experiencing physical symptoms with no apparent or identified physical cause).  It was out of these experiences, and Freud's own clinical work, that Freud developed his theories on personality (Baron, 2001).  Freud would eventually replace Breuer’s ideas of hypnosis with free association, and include dream analysis into his work.  

Freud’s believed that personality consisted of three main parts; ''id, ego, superego''.  He explained that the ''id'' was related to desires and impulses, which consisted of our basic needs and feelings.  The processes that the id controlled were primarily unconscious that worked on what Freud termed, the ''pleasure principle''; that is, the id looks for immediate pleasure and ignores the consequences.  The ''ego'', Freud explained, was related to reason.  Its role was to regulate the id, assuring that urges were satisfied but only when it was appropriate to do so.  This process of regulation was believed to be partly conscious and worked on what Freud termed the ''reality principle''; that is, the ego monitors behaviour to satisfy desires while also avoiding negative consequences.  Similar to the ego, the superego restricts id urges to avoid consequences, but also, takes into account what is morally right and wrong.  It's role is to consider the social teachings and norms of a society.  Freud believed that a struggle existed between these levels of consciousness, influencing personality development and psychopathology. (Baron, 2001).

Based on Freud’s observations of his adult patients, and their accounts of painful events occurring during their childhood, he constructed his '''Psychosexual Theory of Development''', which is probably his most well-known theory of personality development.  Interestingly, Freud never saw children clinically. He based his model on his work with adults.

Freud’s theory consisted of five age-related stages, each with a different physical center of pleasure (an erogenous zone), which children and adolescents pass through in order to become fully mature individuals (Dacey &amp; Travers, 1996).  At each stage the child or adolescent is “confront[ed with] conflicts between biological drives and social expectations” (Berk, 2000, 16).  Their ability to resolve these conflicts is hypothesized to determine their ability to function in their environment and cope with anxiety.

*'''Stage 1''': The Oral Stage of development was thought to last from birth until the child was one and a half years old.  Within this stage, the pleasure centre is the oral cavity.  The goal of the child is to obtain an “appropriate amount of sucking, eating, biting, and talking” (Dacey &amp; Travers, 1996, 29).
*'''Stage 2''': The Anal Stage of development was thought to last from one and a half to three years of age.  Within this stage, the anus is the pleasure center and mastery of this stage is achieved when the child is successfully toilet trained (Dacey &amp; Travers, 1996).
*'''Stage 3''': The Phallic Stage of development was thought to last from three to five years of age.  Within this stage the pleasure center for boys is the penis and the pleasure center for girls is the clitoris.  The object of sexual desire at this stage is the parent of the opposite sex (known as the Opedial Complex in boys and Electra Complex in girls).  Mastery of this stage is achieved when the conflict caused by this desire is resolved (Dacey &amp; Travers, 1996).
*'''Stage 4''': The Latency Stage of development was thought to last from five to twelve years of age.  This stage is characterized by repression of all sexual desires for the opposite sex.  Children are more likely to only engage in same-sex play and they frequently reject members of the opposite sex.  Freud thought that this was especially true for boys and he noted that boys were particularly likely to reject all types of affection from their mothers and voice their disdain for same-age opposite-sex peers (Dacey &amp; Travers, 1996).
*'''Stage 5''': The Genital Stage of development was thought to last from twelve years of age into adulthood.  During this stage, puberty, and its associated surge of sexual hormones, is thought to bring about “an unconscious recurrence of the phallic stage” (Dacey &amp; Travers, 1996, 29). However, to hold and express sexual desire for one’s parent is taboo. As a result, adolescents then attempt to establish relationships with same-aged members of the opposite sex.

But what happens if children fail to master a particular stage?  Freud believed that some individuals do not adequately master all of the stages as he outlined them.  He postulated that some individuals actually become “stuck” within a stage because they are unable to resolve the conflict associated with it.  Freud defined this inability to move on as “'''fixation'''.”  When fixation occurs, anxiety is the byproduct and the individual develops defense mechanisms to deal with it (Dacey &amp; Travers, 1996).  These fixations can occur at any of the psychosexual stages listed above.

An oral fixation can have two possible outcomes. A person can take on an Oral Receptive Personality and reduce tension through oral activity such as eating, drinking, smoking, or biting nails.  These individuals are usually passive, needy, sensitive to rejection, and easily swayed by other people's ideas.  In contrast, a person can take on an Oral Aggressive Personality.  These individuals are usually hostile and verbally abusive and they use mouth-based aggression to control others.

An anal fixation, which Freud thought was caused by harsh punishment during toilet training, can also have two possible outcomes.  Individuals who develop the Anal Retentive Personality becomes stingy and preoccupied with order and tidiness.  They are usually perfectionists and have a tendency to be stubborn.  On the other hand, individuals who develop the Anal Expulsive Personality lack self control and are usually messy and careless (the oppositive of the Anal Retentive Personality).

Phallic fixation occurs when boys do not manage to work through the Oedipal Complex and girls do not manage to work through the Electra Conflict.  The result is that these individuals never learn to identify with their same sex parent.  The Oedipal Complex refers to a boy's sexual desire for his mother. As a result of this desire, he sees his father as a rival for her affections. A boy then suffers from castration anxiety, fearing that his father will uncover his desire for his mother and will castrate him.  Boys then repress their desire for their mother and defensively identify with their father.  A girl, on the other hand, suffers from penis envy and desires her father as a means to obtain a penis substitute.  Her desire for her father is later repressed and instead her mother's values are incorporated in that she accepts her inherent 'inferiority' in the society.  Freud (1920) himself believed that an inability to resolve the Oedipux Complex or the Electra Conflict leads to neurosis.

===Karen Horney===

Karen Horney may be considered among the great psychoanalytic thinkers of the twentieth century. She deserves historical recognition for her work on '''Feminine Psychology''' which analyzed women's personalities with greater dignity and respect than Freudian psychoanalysis. She also developed her own psychological theory of human personality and behaviour which has been widely applied in treatment approaches. 

Karen Danielsen was born on September 16, 1885 in Hamburg, Germany. Her pursuit to become a doctor and a psychiatrist was radical for her time. She was accepted into medical school in 1906, not long after women were permitted to attain higher education. In Germany, this privilege did not come until 1900. The university that did accept her, the University of Freiburg, was one of the first to enroll women in medicine (Mazzarella, 1999). One may consider how strong and determined she must have been to accomplish her goals when challenged not only by family disapproval but also by public scrutiny. Karen persevered, transferring to the University of Berlin and graduating in medicine 1913 (Mazzarella, 1999). Here, she also studied psychiatry. During her university years, Karen met and married a law student named Oskar Horney (Mazzarella, 1999). The marriage did not last, but her contributions to the field of psychology became legendary.

Karen Horney (1937) believed that adult personality and behaviour could be studied as individual ways of dealing with anxiety, or what she termed basic anxiety. She held that basic anxiety stemmed from childhood feelings of being alone, isolated, and helpless in a cruel world. She saw basic anxiety resulting, not from sexual or aggressive conflicts, as  Freud did, but from problematic relationships that the child experienced with his or her parents (Horney, 1937, 1939, 1945). Key factors in the formation of anxiety were believed to be rejection, punishment, the breakdown of trust, and/or overprotection. According to Horney, children raised in environments of love, trust, warmth, and tolerance have lower risks of developing anxiety.

Known as the founder of ''Feminine Psychology'' (1922-1937, 1967), Horney bravely opposed Freud and his loyal band of Neo-Freudians by stating that women deserve to be treated as more than inadequate men. Horney's work criticized orthodox Freudianism for failing to give consideration to the socio-cultural dynamics that shape women's lives. Her then radical perspective shook the world of psychotherapy to the benefit of women everywhere. Feminine psychology gave women’s health issues a voice and provided empathy and understanding in the therapeutic healing of female patients who were previously treated under the catchall diagnosis of hysteria.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Class Example ==
Why is the very first example of a class derived from another class? Does the example code actually use methods from &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt;? 

I've noticed that other online Objective-C tutorials have the same habit of not showing an example of a non-derived class. The other example I looked at derived its classes from &lt;code&gt;NSObject&lt;/code&gt;. Apparently, it makes a difference at a very fundamental level:

&lt;pre&gt;
   Point *point = [Point new];
   Point *point = [[Point alloc] init];
&lt;/pre&gt;

The other site used the syntax of the second line for instantiating its very basic object, which looked very much like our &lt;code&gt;Point&lt;/code&gt;, except it was derived from &lt;code&gt;NSObject&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt;. But the instantiation of an object derived from &lt;code&gt;NSObject&lt;/code&gt; looks very different from the instantiation of an object derived from &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt;.

Would a non-derived &lt;code&gt;Point&lt;/code&gt; not have a memory-allocation method? Would it also not have a constructor? Perhaps somebody who knows something about Objective-C should write about that.

The methods to set the x and y values are private. Shouldn't they be made public with a '+' so a class outside Point can call it? If i'm correct, this isn't proper Objective C. {{subst:unsigne|80.101.83.92}}

      <comment>Categorising with [[:Category:Applied History of Psychology]]  ([[Project:AWB|AWB]])</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Although psychology is one of the youngest sciences, emerging as a formal discipline in the late 19th century, its history is vast and extends to the ancient past.  In general, studying history leads us to incredible resources to answer specific questions.  One '''guiding question''' for people interested in applied psychology includes: What can the past teach us about how to improve human lives...?

This question motivates the study of history because it seems likely that those most successful at improving lives in the past might have had better (or at least different) ideas about how to do it and how to evaluate that success.  This is particularly true if we no longer believe in a view of progress in which 'newer is better'.  Returning to historical figures and movements often shows that they had more sophistication than commonly remembered, raising issues that might not have seemed important then, but that can be useful or insightful to us today.

In this project, we consider a few historical attempts to improve human lives:  Some attempts aim to refine or accelerate spontaneous human development through education (especially through accommodations for atypical students), others look at ways to alleviate human suffering through clinical intervention (both biological—pharmacological or surgical—and psychological).  Knowing how best to intervene and whether that intervention was successful also requires assessment and evaluation, which is also very different in different times and places.

The book is organized in a manner respective of this concern with how to use psychology to improve human lives. It begins with the development of our field, before progressing more specifically to 
the development of each human life and its relationships (attachment). We then move on to how to analyze and assess these lives, before finally looking at how we decide when something has gone awry (&quot;mental disorder&quot;) and how we actually help, which is the culmination of the efforts of psychology which came before. The book closes by examining some psychological difficulties in detail and then we look at some special interests of our contributors. Specifically:

The first section of ''Applied History of Psychology'' focuses on the early contributions to the field, from the work of influential Greek philosophers to a discussion of Wundt's laboratory work. 

The second section examines various models of human development from the development of relationships with parents in infancy through personality development, cognitive development, social development, and finally moral development. Controversies within conceptualizations of development are also discussed. 

The third section looks at models of learning (behaviour theory), views of intelligence, and different forms and purposes of psychological assessment from intellectual to vocational.

The fourth section looks at the application of psychology to &quot;mental disorder&quot; or mental distress. In  this section issues of diagnosis and treatment are discussed and a few disorders are discussed in detail.

The fifth section looks at the history of attention in detail as it represented a special interest for the participants in this project.

Overall, this book represents a history of psychology representative of the various interests of a specific group of graduate students in psychology. Although gaps are certainly present, we have tried to provide a history relevant to psychology as we experience it and use it in our work.

== Chapter 1 Introduction ==



=== Defining language ===

To a common man, language is &quot;the expression of what we have in our mind&quot; and they know that this expression can be in form of written symbols, spoken sounds or body gestures. But to the linguists or other language researchers, it is &quot;a contextualized system of finite arbitrary symbols, sounds and gestures combined according to rules of grammar for the purpose of communication” and it is “an infinitely extensible and modifiable system of communication based on pure arbitrary convention.&quot; Language is more than just a means of communication. It influences our culture and even our thought processes. Language is a social phenomenon. Language only exists in society. It is a means of nourishing and developing culture and establishing human relations. 

‘Language’ is a human’s innate ability to talk or in more technical terms, an abstract faculty of speech which facilitates him or her to learn and use a language in order to communicate with other humans. This faculty is held by all human beings in common and does not vary from one region to another as human psychology is universally the same. On the other hand, ‘a language’ is that particular set of codes which ‘language faculty’ facilitates us to learn and use. ‘A language’ is a set of conventions operated through the faculty of ‘language.’ These sets vary in terms of codes as different humans learn and use different codes and thus each group of humans uses a different language and the set of codes, which they name as some particular language, is not held by all human beings in common.

=== Language as a system of systems ===
Language is symbolic, yet its symbols are arranged in a particular system. Almost all languages of the world have their own well-organized and highly developed systems of arranging these symbols. Though symbols in each human language are finite; they can be arranged infinitely, that is to say, we can produce an infinite set of sentences by a finite set of symbols. Every language is a system of systems. All languages have phonological and grammatical systems, and within a system there are also several sub-systems. For example, within grammatical system, we have morphological and syntactic systems, and within these two sub-systems, we have still other sub-systems such as those of number, of mood, of tense, of class etc.

=== Language as social semiotic ===

The study of attention is a major part of contemporary cognitive psychology and cognitive neuroscience. Attention plays a critical role in essentially all aspects of perception, cognition, and action, influencing the choices we make. The study of attention has been of interest to the field of psychology since its earliest days. However, many ideas about attention can be traced to philosophers in the 18th and 19th centuries, preceding the foundation of the field of psychology.

The topic of attention was originally discussed by philosophers. Among the issues considered was the role of attention on conscious awareness and thought, and whether attention was directed voluntarily or involuntarily toward objects or events. The characterization of attention provided by each philosopher reflected that individual's larger metaphysical views of the nature of things and how we come to know the world. For instance, Joan Luis Vives (1492-1540) recognized the role of attention in forming memories. Gottfried Leibniz (1646-1716) introduced the concept of apperception, which refers to an act that is necessary for an individual to become conscious of a perceptual event. He noted that without apperception, information does not enter conscious awareness. Leibniz said, &quot;Attention is a determination of the soul to know something in preference to other things&quot;. In summary, many philosophers gave attention a central role in perception and thinking. They introduced several important issues, such as the extent to which attention is directed automatically or intentionally. These topics continue to be examined and evaluated in contemporary research. Although they conducted little experimental research themselves, their conceptual analysis of attention laid the foundation for the scientific study of attention in ensuing years.

The philosophical analyses of attention led to some predictions that could be tested experimentally. In addition, in the mid-1800s psychophysical methods were being developed that allowed measurement of the relation between physical stimulus properties and the psychological perceptions of them. Wilhelm Wundt, who established the first laboratory devoted to psychological research in 1879, was responsible for introducing the study of attention to the field. In addition, the relation between attention and perception was one of the first topics to be studied in experimental psychology. Wundt held that attention was an inner activity that caused ideas to be present to differing degrees in consciousness. He distinguished between perception, which was the entry into the field of attention, and apperception, which was responsible for entry into the inner focus. He assumed that the focus of attention could narrow or widen. This view that has also enjoyed popularity in recent years.
At the end of the 19th century, Hermann von Helmholtz (1821-1894) argued that attention is essential for visual perception. Using himself as a subject and pages of briefly visible printed letters as stimuli, he found that attention could be directed in advance of the stimulus presentation to a particular region of the page, even though the eyes were kept fixed at a central point. He also found that attention was limited: The letters in by far the largest part of the visual field, even in the vicinity of the fixation point, were not automatically perceived.

William James' (1890/1950) views on attention are probably the most well known of the early psychologists. In his famous Principles of Psychology (1980), James asserted that &quot;the faculty of voluntarily bringing back a wandering attention, over and over again, is the very root of judgment, character, and will.&quot; His definition of attention is also widely quoted. According to James (1890), “It is taking possession by the mind, in clear and vivid form, of one of what seem several simultaneously possible objects or trains of thought. Focalization, concentration, of consciousness are of its essence. It implies withdrawal from some things in order to deal effectively with others, and is a condition which has a real opposite in the confused, dazed, scatterbrained state.&quot;

Moreover, according to James, the immediate effects of attention are to make us perceive, conceive, distinguish and remember, better than we otherwise could –both more successive things and each thing more clearly. It also shortens “reaction time”. James’s definition also mentions clearness, which Titchener (1908/1973) viewed as the central aspect of attention. Pillsbury (1908/1973) agreed with Titchener, indicating, “the essence of attention as a conscious process is an increase in the clearness on one idea or a group of ideas at the expense of others”. Researchers at the beginning of the 20th century debated how this increased clearness is obtained.

In summary, around 1860, the philosophical approach dominated the study of psychology in general and attention especially. During the period from 1980 to 1909, the study of attention was transformed, as was the field of psychology as a whole, to one of scientific inquiry with emphasis on experimental investigations. However, given that behaviourism came to dominate psychology in the next period, at least in the United States, the study of attentional mechanisms was largely delayed until the middle of the 20th century.

Although one often reads that research on attention essentially ceased during the period of 1910-1949, attention research never disappeared completely. However, there was an increase in interest in the topic with the advent of contemporary cognitive psychology. Lovie (1983) compiled tables showing the numbers of papers on attention listed in Psychological Abstracts and its predecessor, Psychological Index, in five-year intervals from 1910 to 1960, showing that studies on the topic were conducted during these time periods. Among the important works on attention was that of Jersild (1927) who published a classic monograph, “Mental Set and Shift”. Another significant contribution during this era was the discovery of the psychological refractory period effect by Telford (1931). He noted that numerous studies showed that stimulation of neurons was followed by a refractory phase during which the neurons were less sensitive to stimulation. Stroop (1935/1992) also published what is certainly one of the most widely cited studies in the field of psychology, in which he demonstrated that stimulus information that is irrelevant to the task can have a major impact on performance (see below for John Ridley Stroop and the impact of the Stroop Color-Word Task on research on attention). Paschal (1941), Gibson (1940) and Mowrer, Rayman and Bliss (1940) also conducted research on attention such as that on preparatory set or mental set. In sum, although the proportion of psychological research devoted to the topic of attention was much less during this time period than during preceding decades, many important discoveries were made, which have influenced contemporary research on the topic.

The period from 1950 to 1974 saw a revival of interest in the characterization of human information processing. Research on attention in this period was characterized by an interplay between technical applications and theory. Mackworth (1950) reported experiments on the maintenance of vigilance that exemplified this interaction and set the stage for extensive research on the topic over the remainder of the 20th century. This research originated in concerns about the performance of radar operators in World War II detecting infrequently occurring signals. Cherry (1953) conducted one of the seminal works in attention during this period, studying the problem of selective attention, or, as he called it, “the cocktail party phenomenon”. He used a procedure called dichotic listening in which he presented different messages to each ear through headphones. Broadbent (1958) developed the first complete model of attention, called Filter Theory (see below). Treisman (1960) reformulated Filter Theory into what is now called the Filter-Attenuation Theory (see below).

In the early 1970s, there was a shift from studying attention mainly with auditory tasks to studying it mainly with visual tasks. A view that regards attention as a limited-capacity resource that can be directed toward various processes became popular. Kahneman’s (1973) model is the most well known of these unitary capacity or resource theories. According to this model, attention is a single resource that can be divided among different tasks in different amounts. The basic idea behind these models is that multiple tasks should produce interference when they compete for the limited capacity resources. Also, in this time period, the first controlled experiments that used psychophysiological techniques to study attention were conducted on humans. These experiments used methods that allow brain activity relating to the processing of a stimulus, called event related potentials, to be measured using electrodes placed on the scalp. In sum, the research during this period yielded considerable information about the mechanisms of attention. The most important development was the introduction of detailed information processing models of attention.

Research on attention blossomed during the last quarter of the 20th century. Multiple resources models have emerged from many studies showing that it is easier to perform two tasks together when the tasks use different stimulus or response modalities than when they use the same modalities. Treisman and Gelade (1980) also developed a highly influential variant of the Spotlight Theory called the Feature Integration Theory to explain the results from visual search studies, in which subjects are to detect whether a target is present among distracters (see below). Priming studies have also been popular during the most recent period of attention research. In such studies, a prime stimulus precedes the imperative stimulus to which the subject is to respond; the prime can be the same as or different from some aspect of the imperative stimulus.

In addition, a major focus has been on gathering neuropsychological evidence pertaining to the brain mechanisms that underlie attention. Cognitive neuroscience, of which studies of attention are a major part, has made great strides due to the continued development of neuroimaging technologies. The converging evidence provided by neuropsychological and behavioral data promises to advance the study of attention significantly in the first half of the 21st century. Finally, significant advances have also been made toward expanding the theories and methods of attention to address a range of applied problems. Two major areas can be identified. The first one concerns ergonomics in its broadest sense, ranging from human-machine interactions to improvement of work environments such as mental workload and situation awareness. The second major area of application is clinical neuropsychology, which has benefited substantially from adopting cognitive models and experimental methods to describe and investigate cognitive deficits in neurological patients. There is also work being one on the clinical application of attentional strategies (e.g., mindfulness training) in the treatment of a wide range of psychological disorders (see section on mindfulness).

===John Ridley Stroop and The Stroop Effect===

For over half a century, the Stroop effect has been one of the most well known standard demonstrations in undergraduate psychology courses and laboratories. In this cognitive task, participants asked to name the color of the ink in which an incompatible color word is printed (e.g., to say “red” aloud in response to the stimulus word GREEN printed in red ink) take longer than when asked to name the color in a control condition (e.g., to say &quot;red&quot; to the stimulus XXXXX printed in red ink). This effect, now known as the Stroop effect, was first reported in the classic article “Studies of Interference in Serial Verbal Reactions” published in the Journal of Experimental Psychology in 1935. Since then, this phenomena has become one of the most well known in the history of psychology. However, less is known about the man behind this landmark cognitive task. In this paper, a biography of John Ridley Stroop, the creator of the Stroop Color-Word task and discoverer of the Stroop Effect, will be outlined. 

John Ridley Stroop was born near Murfreesboro, Tennessee, on March 21, 1897. His middle name derived from a preacher whom his parents admired, and Stroop was known by that name both personally and professionally all through his life (MacLeod, 1992). Stroop was the second youngest of six children. As an infant, Stroop was not expected to live, which led his parents to shelter him during his childhood. Unlike the other the family members, he was not required to do heavy physical work on the family farm (MacLeod, 1991a).

Stroop's initial schooling was at Kitrell County School, where he graduated at the top of his elementary school class. He continued his education in nearby Nashville at David Lipscomb High School, graduating  in 1919. In 1921, he obtained a diploma from David Lipscomb Junior College, where he was selected to be Valedictorian. On December 23, 1921, during his second year in college at the age of 24, Stroop married Zelma Dunn, great niece of Mr. David Lipscomb. Over the next seven years, they had three sons. To be able to support his growing family, Stroop taught at David Lipscomb College and worked as a janitor and as a librarian while in graduate school (MacLeod, 1992). 

Stroop’s university years were spent at George Peabody College (now part of Vanderbilt University) in Nashville. There, he received his BS in 1924, his MA in 1925, and his PhD in 1933. His doctoral degree was in Experimental Psychology with a minor in Educational Psychology and an elective in Education. Stroop’s dissertation research was carried out under the supervision of Dr. Joseph Peterson, a former president of the American Psychological Association, at the Jesup Psychological Laboratory. Stroop developed these color-word tasks partly because the naming-reading comparison was of interest to Dr. Peterson in his individual differences research (MacLeod, 1991a). However, his real interest was on interference between conflicting processes. His research followed studies being conducted at the time on interference or inhibition but using materials that were similar in nature to those employed in color naming-word reading studies (Stroop, 1935). For instance, Stroop referred in his article to studies on color-word naming that were conducted  by John James McKeen Cattell (1886), who at the instigation of his doctoral supervisor, Wilhelm Wundt, investigated differences in reaction times to naming objects, the properties of those objects, as well as the corresponding words. Catell reported that reading words took less time than naming the objects or properties, the latter including color (Macleod, 1991b). However, it was not until Stroop's research that anyone thought to combine the word and object/property dimensions, creating the now famous situation of response conflict (MacLeod, 1991). Stroop’s PhD dissertation went to become his classic paper, which over the  years became one of the most cited articles in the history of the Journal of Experimental Psychology. 

Stroop teaching career began well in advanced to the completion of his doctoral degree. He was principal at a Mississippi Consolidated School in 1921-1922. Then, he returned to David Lipscomb College. There, he began as an instructor in Mathematics and English (1922-1923), and then switched to Modern Languages (1924-1928). Between 1928 and 1932, he was Professor of Psychology and Education, serving as Dean of the Faculty for the 1928-1929 academic year. After completing his PhD, Stroop conducted research for the Tennessee Educational Commission (1933-1934), then serving briefly as a special instructor in Psychology and Education at Tennessee Polytechnic Institute. He returned to David Lipscomb College, where he taught for almost his entire 40-year career. 

After completing his PhD, Stroop had planned to continue his line of research. However, when Dr. Peterson died in 1935, Stroop never again conducted research in psychology. As Macleod (1992) noted, it was probably this event more than any other that led Stroop to discontinue his psychological research. His wife also wrote in her biographical sketch of him:
&quot;His major professor at Peabody, Dr. Joseph Peterson, invited him to collaborate with him on a research project furthering the study of [Stroop] 's doctorate thesis. Dr. Peterson's unexpected death prevented such from happening. This was probably the changing of his work as he became more involved in teaching the Bible and writing in that field.&quot; (in MacLeod, 1991a).
Stroop published just four papers in psychology throughout his career. One concerned with group versus individual judgments (1932), and the other three related to color-word processing including his classic paper (1935), a critique of work on the color-word issue  (1935), and a test of a possible explanation of the Stroop effect (1938). Stroop remained in psychology and chaired his department from 1948 until 1964; however, he never again conducted research in the field. Instead of psychology, Stroop devoted his attention to his religion for the rest of his life.

Stroop was a Christian who preached every Sunday in and around Nashville, often taking a train out into the country and being paid with a chicken or a bag of potatoes. He also kept a card file indicating for each Sunday where he had spoken and what his topic had been (MacLeod, 1991a). Moreover, Stroop taught bible classes in college in addition to teaching psychology. He was known to colleagues and students as both Dr. Stroop and Brother Stroop. Stroop’s major contributions were in the area of biblical studies. He wrote seven books based on his biblical teachings, beginning with Why Do People Not See the Bible Alike?  published in 1949 and ending with Restoration Ideas on Church Organization published in 1966. His major work was a trilogy entitled God’s Plan and me, which was published in 1950s. He received awards for these books, which were popular as textbooks in Christian schools. The bible then rather than psychology was Stroop’s life work.  John Ridley Stroop retired in 1967. He spent 1967-1968 as Dean of Ohio Valley College in Parkersburg, Virginia, after which he took up the position of Emeritus Professor of Biblical Studies at David Lipscomb College (MacLeod, 1991a). He died  on September 1, 1973 at the age of 76.

Stroop’s article has become one of the most cited articles in the history of experimental psychology. It has more than 700 studies seeking to explain some nuance of the Stroop effect along with thousands of others directly or indirectly influenced by this article (MacLeod, 1992). However, at the time of its publication, it had relatively little impact because it was published at the height of Behaviourism in America (MacLeod, 1991). For the next thirty years after its publication, almost no experimental investigations of the Stroop effect occurred. For instance, between 1935 and 1964, only 16 articles are cited that directly examined the Stroop effect. In 1960s, with the advent of information processing as the dominant perspective in cognitive psychology, Stroop's work was rediscovered. Since then, the annual number of  studies rose quickly, until by 1969 the number of articles settled in at just over 20 annually, where it appears to have remained (MacLeod, 1992). 

The discovery of the Stroop Effect and the development of this Color-Word task has had a lasting impact on cognitive psychology. As MacLeod (1991a) has noted,
“There are few phenomena in psychology so robust that they appear in virtually every introductory text and are known by researchers in almost every sub-area of the discipline. The Stroop effect is one of these rare phenomena…. John Ridley Stroop was a pioneer, instrumental in providing one of the tools most valued by cognitive psychologists. A half century later, the task that bears his name continues to be a challenging puzzle for experimental psychologists to solve. (MacLeod, 1991a)” This landmark cognitive task has been widely used to index attentional and linguistic processes. Understanding the Stroop effect may ultimately lead us to a fuller comprehension of how attention works and of the place of attention in a more general theory of cognition.

===Donald Broadbent and Dichotic Listening===

Donald E. Broadbent has been praised for his outstanding contributions to the field of psychology since the 1950s, most notably in the area of attention. In fact, despite the undeniable role that attention plays in almost all psychological processes, research in this area was neglected by psychologists for the first half of the twentieth century (Massaro, 1996). During that time, behaviourists ignored the role of attention in human behaviour. Behaviourism was characterized by a stimulus-response approach, emphasizing the association between a stimulus and a response, but without identifying the cognitive operations that lead to that response (Reed, 2000). Subsequently, in the mid-1950s, a growing number of psychologists became interested in the information-processing approach as opposed to the stimulus-response approach. It was Broadbent’s elaboration of the idea of the human organism as an information-processing system that lead to a systematic study of attention, and more generally, to the interrelation of scientific theory and practical application in the study of psychology.

Broadbent was born May 6, 1926, in Birmingham, England (American Psychological Association, 1976). He was originally interested in the natural sciences, and thus, when he joined the Royal Air Force (RAF) in 1944, he began his study of aeronautical engineering. As he spent time in the RAF he observed that human difficulties often arose from psychological, as opposed to physical, causes (Craik &amp; Baddeley, 1995). More specifically, he noted that communication difficulties, such as problems listening to a specific stream of auditory information when presented with numerous streams, were frequently caused by inefficient processes of attention, perception, or memory, rather than by failures of hearing or technical equipment (Craik, 2000). Upon this observation, Broadbent’s interests changed from the subject of engineering to that of psychology. 

At that time, however, the field of psychology was virtually unheard of in his home country of England. It was not until Broadbent travelled across the Atlantic to the United States for flying training that he discovered that psychology was being widely studied in North America (APA, 1976). After some time working in the personnel selection branch of the RAF, he began to study experimental psychology at Cambridge. Fortunately for Broadbent, and for scores of future psychologists, the psychology department at Cambridge was an especially suitable place for him due to its natural sciences orientation and its emphasis on practical application (Craik &amp; Baddeley, 1995). Headed by Sir Frederic Bartlett, the department was enthusiastic to apply the ''cybernetic'' ideas of the late K .J. W. Craik, with the aim of understanding human behaviour in terms of control systems, to practical problems and psychological theory in general (APA, 1976). By sheer accident, but with fortunate advantage to the field of psychology, Broadbent’s interests in experimental psychology and practical application allowed him to find his place in the Applied Psychology Unit at Cambridge.

It was during his 25 years, from 1958 to 1974, as director of the Applied Psychology Unit that Broadbent was able to study and define models related to his interests in the effects of environmental stressors on cognitive performance, problems related to the detection and understanding of speech, and problems of selective listening and attention (Craik &amp; Baddeley, 1995). Up to that time, most research had shown that noise did not influence performance on psychological tasks. Broadbent wondered, however, if noise would adversely influence performance on untraditional psychological tests (APA, 1976). For instance, he discovered that noise did have an effect on the vigilance tasks invented by N. H. Mackworth, however, these tasks were deliberately long and repetitive, making them tedious to study.

During that time, Broadbent also looked at the problems caused by communicating with gunnery and air control systems, in which many channels of speech communication were delivered at one time. In contrast to the vigilance studies, he found that this problem allowed for short and quick experiments, which contributed favourably to his study of attention and noise (APA, 1976). His work on communication systems indicated that most people spend their lives surrounded by many different types of stimuli, however, they cannot respond or describe the majority of them.

Not only were Broadbent’s contributions to experimental psychology noteworthy for attention research, they also contributed to belief in the need for societal relevance in research (Craik, 2000). It is perhaps through his background in natural sciences and engineering, and his subsequent practical work with the RAF on noise and communication, that Broadbent developed a particular admiration for applied psychological work. In addition, he had an informal speaking style when presenting lectures and essays, as well as used commonplace analogies to represent complicated ideas, which allowed society as a whole to consume his theories. For instance, when initially stated, his mechanical model of attention consisted of a Y-tube, in which two separate channels of ping-pong balls merge in a central channel protected by a filter that allows only one ball to enter (Massaro, 1996). Such an analogy clearly illustrated the limitations of human attention when attempting to attend to two auditory channels at the same time. As stated by Craik and Baddeley, “[Broadbent’s] psychology was intended for society and its problems, not merely for the dwellers in ivory towers” (1995, pp. 303). 

After his death in 1993, numerous tributes and biographical acknowledgements were written in Broadbent’s honour. Above all, he is remembered for the unmistakable image that he projected of himself, as “the man, the scholar, the scientist, the philosopher of science, and of his commitments to empirical psychology, to explicit models or theories, and to the application of psychological knowledge to real-word problems” (Massaro, 1996, pp. 141). It is with this clear image in mind that a new generation of psychologists set forth, using Broadbent’s principles of experimental psychology as tools for practical application and research in the area of attention, and more broadly, all psychological processes that influence humankind.

====Dichotic Listening Experiments====

In 1952, Broadbent published his first report in a series of experiments that involved a dichotic listening paradigm. In that report, he was concerned with a person’s ability to answer one of two messages that were delivered at the same time, but one of which was irrelevant.

The participants were required to answer a series of Yes-No questions about a visual display over a radio-telephone. For example, the participant would be asked “S-1 from G.D.O. Is there a heart on Position 1?” Over,” to which the participant should answer “G.D.O. from S-1. Yes, over.” Participants in groups I, II, III, and IV heard two successive series of messages, in which two voices (G.D.O and Turret) spoke simultaneously during some of the messages. Only one of the voices was addressing S-1, and the other addressed S-2, S-3, S-4, S-5, or S-6. Participants were assigned to the following five groups:
*'''Group I:''' instructed to answer the message for S-1 and ignore the other on both runs
*'''Group II:''' instructed on one run to only answer the message from G.D.O. and on the second run was provided with a visual cue before the pairs of messages began for the name of the voice to be answered
*'''Group III:''' were given the same directions as Group I on one run, and on the other run had the experimenter indicate the correct voice verbally after the two messages had reached the “over” stage
*'''Group IV:''' had the correct voice indicated in all cases, but in one run it was before the messages began (like in Group II) and in the other run it was after the messages had finished (like in Group III)
*'''Group V:''' under the same conditions as Group I, heard the same recordings as Groups I, II, III and IV, but then also heard a two new recordings. One recording had a voice that addressed S-1 and a voice that addressed T-2, T-3, T-4, T-5, or T-6 (thus the simultaneous messages were more distinct than for the other groups). The other recording had this same differentiation of messages, but also had both voices repeat the call-sign portion of the message (i.e., “S-1 from G.D.O., S-1 from G.D.O.)

For groups I and II, it is important to note that the overall proportion of failures to answer the correct message correctly was 52%. Results from Groups III and IV indicated that delaying knowledge of the correct voice until the message is completed makes that knowledge almost useless. More specifically, Broadbent (1952) stated:

:“The present case is an instance of selection in perception (attention). Since the visual cue to the correct voice is useless when it arrives towards the ends of the message, it is clear that  process of discarding part of the information contained in the mixed voices has already taken place…It seems possible that one of the two voices is selected for response without reference to its correctness, and that the other is ignored…If one of the two voices is selected (attended to) in the resulting mixture there is no guarantee that it will be the correct one, and both call signs cannot be perceived at once any more than both messages can be received and stored till a visual cue indicates the one to be answered”. (p. 55)

In 1954, Broadbent used the same procedure as discussed above with slight modifications. In that case, he found information that indicated the positive impact that spatial separation of the messages has on paying attention to and understanding the correct message. The dichotic listening paradigm has been utilized in numerous other publications, both by Broadbent and by other psychologists working in the field of cognition. For example, Cherry (1953) investigated how we can recognize what one person is saying when others are speaking at the same time, which be described as the “cocktail party problem” (p. 976). In his experiment, subjects listened to simultaneous messages and were instructed to repeat one of the messages word by word or phrase by phrase.

====Information-Processing and The Filter Model of Attention====

Cognitive psychology is often called ''human information processing'', which reflects the approach taken by many cognitive psychologists in studying cognition. The stage approach, with the acquisition, storage, retrieval, and use of information in a number of separate stages, was influenced by the computer metaphor and the way people enter, store, and retrieve data from a computer (Reed, 2000). The stages in an information-processing model are:
*'''Sensory Store:''' brief storage for information in its original sensory form
*'''Filter:''' part of attention in which some perceptual information is blocked out and not recognized, while othere information is attended to and recognized
*'''Pattern Recognition:''' stage in which a stimulus is recognized
*'''Selection:''' stage that determines what information a person will try to remember
*'''Short-Term Memory:''' memory with limited capacity, that lasts for about 20-30 seconds without attending to its content
*'''Long-Term Memory:''' memory that has no capacity limit and lasts from minutes to a lifetime

Using an information-processing approach, Broadbent collected data on attention (Reed, 2000). He used a dichotic listening paradigm (see above section), asking participants to listen simultaneously to messages played in each ear, and based on the difficulty that participants had in listening to the simultaneous messages, proposed that a listener can attend to only one message at a time (Broadbent, 1952; Broadbent, 1954). More specifically, he asked enlisted men in England's Royal Army to listen to three pairs of digits. One digit from each pair was presented to one ear at the same time that the other digit from the pair was presented to the other ear. The subjects were asked to recall the digits in whatever order they chose, and almost all of the correct reports involved recalling all of the digits presented to one ear, followed by all the digits presented to the other ear. A second group of participants were asked to recall the digits in the order they were presented (i.e., as pairs). Performance was worse than when they were able to recall all digits from one ear and then the other.

To account for these findings, Broadbent hypothesized that the mechanism of attention was controlled by two components: a selective device or filter located early in the nervous system, and a temporary buffer store that precedes the filter (Broadbent, 1958). He proposed that the filter was tuned to one channel or the other, in an all-or-nothing manner. Broadbent’s filter model, described in his book Perception and Communication (1958), was one of the first information-processing models to be examined by psychologists.

Shortly after, it was discovered that if the unattended message became highly meaningful (for example, hearing one’s name as in Cherry's Cocktail Party Effect, as mentioned above), then attention would switch automatically to the new message. This result led to the paradox that the content of the message is understood before it is selected, indicating that Broadbent needed to revise his theory (Craik &amp; Baddeley, 1995). Broadbent did not shy away from this task. In fact, he saw all scientific theories as temporary statements, a method of integrating current evidence in a coherent manner. According to Craik and Baddeley, (1995), although Broadbent always presented his current theories firmly and persuasively, he never took the position of obstinately defending an outmoded theory. When he published his second book on the topic, Decision and Stress (1971), he used his filter model as the starting point, to which he applied modifications and added concepts “to accommodate new findings that the model itself had stimulated” (Massaro, 1996, pp. 141). Despite its inconsistencies with emerging findings, the filter model remains the first and most influential information-processing model of human cognition.

===Anne Treisman and Feature Integration Theory===
Anne Treisman is one of the most influential cognitive psychologists in the world today.  For over four decades, she has been has using innovative research methods to define fundamental issues in the area of attention and perception. Best known for her Feature Integration Theory (1980, 1986), Treisman’s hypotheses about the mechanisms involved in information processing have formed a starting point for many theorists in this area of research.

Anne Treisman (née Taylor) was born on September 2nd, 1935 in Wakefield, Yorkshire, England (Anon, 1991). Through the war years, Treisman lived with her family in a village near Rochester, Kent, where her father, Percy Taylor, worked as chief education officer. Forced by the English educational system to choose only three subjects to study throughout secondary school, Treisman’s studies focused on the language arts, a choice which would shape much of her post-secondary pursuits (Anon, 1991).

It was at Cambridge University that Treisman first discovered the pleasures of intellectual exchange.  Studying modern languages, she obtained a first class BA with distinction, which earned her a research scholarship (Anon, 1991; Treisman, 2006). However, faced with the prospect of research on a relatively unknown author, Treisman decided to use her scholarship to obtain a second BA in psychology instead. Under the supervision of Richard Gregory, Treisman completed this second degree in one extra year (Anon, 1991).  Gregory’s influence on Treisman was profound; in this year, she was introduced to various methods of exploring the mind through experiments in perception, igniting in her the enthusiasm for research that she maintains to this day (Anon, 1991). 

In 1957, Treisman began working toward her DPh at Oxford University, under the supervision of Carolus Oldfield (Anon, 1991).  She conducted research on aphasia and considered pursing a career in clinical psychology. However, Treisman soon realized that she lacked the appropriate training to effectively help patients and, unwilling to simply use her patients as subjects in graduate research, Treisman’s clinical career aspirations faded.  Around the same time, information theory was shifting psychologists’ view of the mind from the traditional behaviourist view of the mind as a switchboard to that of an active processor of information (Goldstein, 2005). Donald Broadbent and Colin Cherry had recently published groundbreaking papers introducing selective listening (also known as the “cocktail party problem”), which launched the cognitive revolution (Broadbent, 1954; Cherry, 1953).  Broadbent’s Filter Model of selective attention (1958), also referred to as an early selection model, proposed that unattended information is filtered out early in the process of auditory perception, that is, before incoming information is analyzed to determine its meaning.  While this theory was tremendously influential, and could account for much of the cocktail party problem, it has been criticized for being too “inflexible” (e.g., this theory could not explain why unattended information occasionally gets through to consciousness).  Guided by Donald Broadbent's book Perception and Communication (1958), Treisman began using a two-channel tape recorder (that she had been using to test aphasics) to conduct research on auditory attention in the normal population (Anon, 1991).  After three years of research, she married Michel Treisman, another Oxford graduate student.  Two years later, in 1962, she completed her thesis on selective attention and speech perception that earned her the DPh degree (Treisman, 2006).

Treisman spent the next four years working in the Medical Research Council Psycholinguistics Research Unit, conducting more research in selective listening (Anon, 1991).  In 1964, Treisman proposed an influential theory that addressed some of the “inflexibility” of Broadbent’s Filter model. This was Treisman’s Attenuation Theory, whereby processing of unattended information is attenuated or reduced, rather than completely filtered out, accounting for the fact that unattended information sometimes reached consciousness.  Further, her model proposed that information processing occurs in a hierarchical manner, with processing of physical characteristics occurring at an early stage (e.g., pitch, or tone of voice) and semantic processing at a later point (Treisman, 1964, 1969).  

In 1969, while Treisman worked as a visiting scientist in the psychology department at Bell Telephone Laboratories, she published an influential paper in Psychological Review that was central to the development of selective attention as a scientific field of study. This paper articulated many of the fundamental issues that continue to guide studies of attention to this day. While at Bell, Treisman’s research interests began to expand (Anon, 1991).  Although she remained intrigued by the role of attention on auditory perception, she was now also fascinated by the way this construct modulates perception in the visual modality. 

In the following years, Treisman returned to Oxford, where she accepted a position as University lecturer in the Psychology Department and was appointed a Fellow of St. Anne’s College (Treisman, 2006). Here, she began to explore the notion that attention is involved in integrating separate features to form visual perceptual representations of objects.  Using a stopwatch and her children as research participants, she found that the search for a red ‘X’ among red ‘Os’ and blue ‘Xs’ was slow and laborious compared to the search for either shape or colour alone (Gazzaniga et al., 2002).  These findings were corroborated by results from testing adult participants in the laboratory and provided the basis of a new research program, where Treisman conducted experiments exploring the relationships between feature integration, attention and object perception (Triesman &amp; Gelade, 1980).  

In 1976, Treisman’s marriage to Michel Treisman ended.  She remarried in 1978, to Daniel Kahneman, a fellow psychologist who would go on to win the Nobel Prize for Economics in 2002.  Shortly thereafter, Treisman and Kahneman accepted positions at the University of British Columbia, Canada. In 1980, Treisman and Gelade published a seminal paper proposing her enormously influential Feature Integration Theory (FIT).  Treisman’s research demonstrated that during the early stages of object perception, early vision encodes features such as color, form, and orientation as separate entities (in &quot;feature maps&quot;) (Treisman, 1986).  Focused attention to these features recombines the separate features resulting in correct object perception.  In the absence of focused attention, these features can bind randomly to form illusory conjunctions (Treisman &amp; Schmidt, 1982; Treisman, 1986).  Feature integration theory has had an overarching impact both within and outside the area of psychology.  

In the early 1980s, neuroscientists were discovering that the primate visual cortex contained areas where neurons were specifically tuned to selective features (e.g., orientation, luminance, colour, shape etc.) (Gazzaniga et al., 2002).  These findings perplexed the neuroscience community who was now faced with the question of how the brain solves the “binding problem” (i.e., how does the visual system recombine these disconnected features into unified wholes).  Treisman approached this problem by testing patients with selective attention problems.  She and her colleagues were first to demonstrate that the binding problem could present itself in everyday life and that one of its solutions involved spatial attention (Treisman and Schmidt, 1982; Goldstein, 2005).  Treisman’s theory has had a tremendous impact, providing a starting point for a great number of experiments in the areas of cognitive psychology, vision science, imaging, neuropsychology and cognitive neuroscience. 

In 1984, Treisman was made Fellow of the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research in their program of artificial intelligence (Treisman, 2006).  The fellowship allowed Treisman to collaborate closely with computer scientists who approached the study of perception from a different angle.  Two years later, Treisman and Kahneman moved to the University of California, Berkeley, where they were both professors in the Psychology Department (Treisman, 2006).  In 1989, Treisman was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, London, and in 1990, she was awarded the Howard Crosby Warren medal of the Society for Experimental Psychologists.  In 1993, Treisman accepted a position as a professor in the Psychology Department at Princeton University in New Jersey, where she still conducts research to this day.  Along with her numerous graduate students, Treisman continues to tackle some of the more challenging questions in cognitive psychology.

Treisman continues to receive numerous prestigious awards recognizing her invaluable contributions to the study of perception and attention, including the William James Fellowship of the American Psychological Society (2002) and a D. Sc., granted honoris causa, from the University of British Columbia (2004).  Clearly, Anne Treisman has been a key figure in the establishment of cognitive psychology as a science, and a significant contributor to its evolution.

====Feature Integration Theory Experiments====
According to Treisman’s Feature Integration Theory perception of objects is divided into two stages:

'''Pre-Attentive Stage:'''The first stage in perception is so named because it happens automatically, without effort or attention by the perceiver.  In this stage, an object is analyzed into its features (i.e., colour, texture, shapes etc.).   Treisman suggests that the reason we are unaware of the breakdown of an object into its elementary features is that this analysis occurs early in the perceptual processes, before we have become conscious of the object. 

Evidence: Treisman created a display of four objects flanked by two black numbers.  This display was flashed on a screen for one-fifth of a second and followed by a random dot masking field in order to eliminate residual perception of the stimuli.  Participants were asked to report the numbers first, followed by what they saw at each of the four locations where the shapes had been.  In 18 percent of trials, participants reported seeing objects that consisted of a combination of features from two different stimuli (i.e., colour and shape).  The combinations of features from different stimuli are called illusory conjunctions (Treisman and Schmidt, 1982).  The experiment also showed that these illusory conjunctions could occur even if the stimuli differ greatly in shape and size.  

According to Treisman, illusory conjunctions occur because early in the perceptual process, features may exist independently of one another, and can therefore be incorrectly combined in laboratory settings when briefly flashed stimuli are followed by a masking field (Treisman, 1986). 

'''Focused Attention Stage:''' During this second stage of perception features are recombined to form whole objects.  

Evidence: Treisman repeated the illusory conjunction experiment, but this time, participants were instructed to ignore the flanking numbers, and to focus their attention on the four target objects.  Results demonstrated that this focused attention eliminated illusory conjunctions, so that all shapes were paired with their correct colours (Treisman and Schmidt, 1982).  The experiment demonstrates the role of attention in the correct perception of objects.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Jean Piaget===

From the 1920's through 1960's, behaviorism was the dominant force in psychology.  However, psychologists eventually began to move away from strict behaviorism and move towards an emphasis on cognition or mental processes.  This shift is often referred to as the &quot;cognitive revolution&quot; because the emphasis on cognition had such a profound influence on psychology.  Much of this can be attributed to the work of Jean Piaget.

Born on August 9, 1896 in Neuchâtel, Switzerland, Jean Piaget, a Swiss philosopher, natural scientist and developmental psychologist began his career as a biologist at the early age of ten, when he published his first paper - a one-page report about his sighting of an albino sparrow.  Piaget's interests in science soon began to reflect a deeper curiosity around science itself and the thinking involved in practicing science.  It is from these beginnings that Piaget became interested in the nature of 'thought' and the development of 'thinking' and his work in this area resulted in one of the most famous and widely-accepted theories of cognitive development.  


'''The Piagetian Model of Children's Thinking'''

*'''Sensorimotor Period (birth to 2 years)'''
:Key ideas in cognitive development at this stage:
::*Coordination of sensory input and motor responses
::*Development of object permanence
::*Little or no capacity for symbolic representation
:Milestones:
::*Birth to 1 month: Child displays modification of reflexes to make one more adaptive.
::*1 to 4 months: Primary circular reactions and coordination of actions occur.
::*4 to 8 months: Child displays secondary circular reactions but will not search for hidden objects.
::*8 to 12 months: Coordination of secondary circular reactions. The infant can retrieve hidden objects but continues searching where objects were previously found rather than where they were last hidden (A not B error).
::*12 to 18 months: The child engages in tertiary circular reactions. The baby will systematically vary the height from which he/she drops things.
::*18 to 24 months: The child is beginning to form true mental representations. There is deferred imitation.

*'''Preoperational Period (2 to 7 years)'''
:Key ideas in cognitive development at this stage:
::*Development of symbolic thought
::*Irreversible, egocentric thinking
:Milestones:
::*2 to 4 years: Development of symbolic capacities, as indicated by language, make-believe play, drawings, and understanding of spatial symbols. Growth of language and mental imagery occurs but communication remains egocentric.
::*4 to 7 years: Child has good language and mental imagery skills, but an inability to represent transformations. She/he focuses on single perceptual dimensions in conservation, class inclusion, time, seriation, and other problems. The child also replaces magical beliefs about fairies, goblins, and events that violate expectations with plausible expectations and shows improved ability to distinguish appearance from reality.  They are capable of creating more realistic drawings, which begin to depict the third dimension.

*'''Concrete Operational Period (7 to 12 years)'''
:Key ideas in cognitive development at this stage:
::*Mental operations applied to concrete objects and events
::*Development of conservation, mastery of concept of reversibility
:Milestones:
::*Whole period: The child can now perform true mental operations, represent transformations and static states, and solve conservation, class, inclusion, time, and many other problems. She/he still has difficulty thinking of all possible combinations and transformations.

*'''Formal Operational Period (12 years through rest of life)'''
:Key ideas in cognitive development at this stage:
::*Mental operations applied to abstraction
::*Development of logical and systematic thinking
:Milestones:
::*Whole Period: The adolescent can think about all possible outcomes, interpret particular events in terms of their relation to hypothetical events, and understand abstract concepts such as conservation of motion and chemical interactions.

'''Criticisms of Piaget's Stage Model'''

Although it is undeniable that Piaget’s work was highly influential and groundbreaking, it is not without criticism. Some theorists and developmental psychologists actually question whether or not development occurs in the ''stagewise'' fashion as Piaget suggested; ''that is, is cognitive development in children all or nothing (e.g. a child is either in the sensorimotor stage or the preoperational stage but not between) or do cognitive structures and abilities develop more gradually?'' These developmental psychologists point to experimental research that demonstrates that children can actually accomplish certain tasks earlier than Piaget would have thought.  

For example, the work of '''Renee Baillargeon (1987)''' has demonstrated that the concept of '''object permanence''' may actually develop much sooner than the age of 8-12 months (as Piaget would have predicted). Object permanence is usually studied by showing an infant a highly desirable toy and then removing that toy and hiding it from view (for example, under a blanket).  After viewing the toy being placed under the blanket, Piaget showed that infants as young as eight months would attempt to reveal the toy by pulling off the blanket. Piaget posited that this action demonstrated that the infant understood that the object continued to exist even though it was out of sight. Infants younger than eight months rarely attempted to remove the blanket, demonstrating that they failed to understand that the object continued to exist when hidden.  

Baillargeon believed that infants younger than eight months failed Piaget’s task because they were lacking in the gross and fine motor movement required to reach out and remove the blanket from atop of the toy. As a result, Baillargeon (1987) designed a study to test object permanence that did not require a motor movement from the infant. In her study, Baillargeon (1987) seated a child in front of a large rotating cardboard screen.  She showed the infant several trials of the screen moving back and forth in a 180 degree motion (starting flat on the table and moving away from the child until it again came to rest flat on the table). On some trials Baillargeon placed a block behind the rotating screen. On these trials the screen would rotate away from the child and come to rest on the block (moving only approximately 110 degrees) (possible task).  Finally, on some trials the block was placed in sight but then as the rotating screen blocked it from view it was removed, allowing the screen to rotate the full 180 degrees and seemingly right through the block (impossible task). Results from this study revealed that infants as young as three and a half months looked significantly longer at the seemingly impossible task when compared to the possible tasks (screen resting on the block or screen rotating through air). Baillargeon (1987) interpreted this longer looking time as evidence that the infants knew that the block continued to exist even though it was blocked from view and that they were ‘shocked’ that the screen seemingly rotated right through it.

Another task that Piaget is famous for involves having an experimenter show an infant a highly desirable toy and place it within reach of either their left or right hand. The placement location of the toy is referred to as ‘'''Location A'''.’ The desirable toy is then covered with an object, such as a blanket, and the infant is given the opportunity to retrieve the toy.  After hiding and retrieving the toy several times at Location A, the experimenter moves the toy to the opposite side of the child (but in view of the child). This is referred to as ‘'''Location B'''.’When the toy is hidden again, and the child is given another chance to retrieve it, surprisingly infants between 8 and 12 months of age reach for Location A rather than Location B! This is what Piaget called the ‘'''A not B Error'''.’

But many child development researchers following Piaget have questioned whether infants really do not understand that the toy has moved locations and that it now exists elsewhere. It was noted that a small percentage of infants in Piaget's studies actually looked at Location B (where the toy was) while reaching for Location A. These observations lead other researchers to come up with and use a novel design – termed the ''''violation of expectancy paradigm'''' - to further test Piaget’s notions about young infants’ ability to search for objects and their memory for object location.

'''Ahmed and Ruffman (2000)''' conducted a series of three experiments to further explore the A not B errors that infants make. In their first study the authors attempted to replicate the results of Piaget’s original task, requiring infants to search for an object using a motor response. In the second study the authors used a ‘nonsearch task.’ Here the infants saw a toy being hidden and retrieved at Location A by an experimenter. Then the infant watched the experimenter move and hide the toy at a new location – Location B. The toy was then retrieved by the experimenter from Location A (impossible event) or Location B (possible event). If the infants understood that the toy was at Location B, retrieval from Location A should violate their expectancy and as a result, infants’ looking times should be longer for the impossible rather than the possible event.  In the third study the authors used a nonsearch task that only involved one location.  Infants were shown the toy only being hidden and retrieved from Location A.  The violation of expectation would be when the experimenter retrieved the hidden toy from Location B (a location in which the toy was never hidden).  

Results from these studies showed that tasks requiring a motor response replicated Piaget’s early findings, that is infants made the A not B error (Ahmed &amp; Ruffman, 2000). However, when tasks did not require a motor response, infants who were aged 8 to 12 months looked longer at impossible events when compared to possible events – inconsistent with the A not B error (Ahmed &amp; Ruffman, 2000). Together these results suggest that the ability to remember the location of objects develops prior to 8 to 12 months and earlier than Piaget believed.

===Lev Vygotsky===

Lev Semyonovich Vygotsky was born in Russia in 1896. In 1916, he graduated from Moscow University with a degree in Law and later worked in his native town of Gomel before he moved in Moscow in 1924, where he lived until his death in 1934. At the same time Piaget was working on his theory, this pioneering psychologist brought a new perspective to cognitive development research that stressed the importance of social interaction to cognitive growth. While his work was left incomplete after his unfortunate death at the age of 38, Vygotsky’s cultural-historical theory of higher mental functions development has had a significant impact on the history of the cognitive sciences. Often compared and contrasted with Piaget’s cognitive-developmental theory, the sociocultural perspective challenges Piaget’s universalist notion of development in favour of a cultural relativist approach that considers specific cultural context and social interactions, with a particular emphasis on belief systems, language structure and social environment. 

The main principles of his sociocutlural theory suggest: 
*That cognitive growth occurs within a sociocultural context that affects its form and processes.
*&quot;Many of a child’s cognitive skills evolve from social interactions with parents, teachers, and other more competent associates” (Shaffer, 1999, p.259).
*Language plays a central role in mental development.

Vygotsky claimed that infants are born with very few elementary mental functions – attention, sensation, perception and memory – that are eventually stimulated and nurtured by culture, developing into new and more sophisticated mental processes he labeled “higher mental functions” (Shaffer, 1999). He suggested that each culture transmitted beliefs, values, and preferred methods of thinking and problem-solving which were then internalized by its children. Thus, culture played a significant role in teaching younger generations what to think and how to go about it. Vygotsky categorized these types of cultural information as “''tools of intellectual adaptation''” which allowed elementary mental functions to be adapted more readily to the particular social environment (1978). 

The central tenant of sociocultural theory indicates that children acquire cultural information in the context of collaborative dialogue and exchange with a more knowledgeable partner. The child learner begins to internalize the directions of the instructor in order to complete tasks which are otherwise too complex to be completed by the child alone. While Vygotsky agreed with Piaget that children were actively involved in learning and discovery, he placed less importance on self-initiated discovery choosing instead to focus on the contributions of social interaction or dialogue (Shaffer, 1999). Within Vygotsky’s framework, truly important discoveries occur when the learner is operating within the “''zone of proximal development''”; that is, where the encouragement and instruction of a skillful tutor can push the learner’s level of accomplishment well beyond the level attained through independent discovery.

Vygotsky’s sociocultural theory also raised significant questions about the relationship of language and thought. From his perspective, language:
*Is the primary vehicle through which adults pass cultural systems of thought and problem-solving on to their children.
*Is one of the more powerful tools of intellectual adaptation.

Of particular importance was Vygotsky's view on the significance of verbal self-directed utterances of pre-school aged children as it contrasts sharply with Piaget’s perspective. 

'''Egocentric Speech (Piaget) vs. Private Speech (Vygotsky)''' 

Both theorists recognize the pre-school child’s self-directed monologues but disagree on the significance of such verbal expressions to the child’s cognitive development. Piaget regards this as “egocentric” – merely reflecting the child’s ongoing mental activity. On the other hand Vygotsky recognized such self-directed speech as communicative rather than egocentric; it is “speech for self” or “private speech” (Shaffer, 1999, p.265). He suggests that this type of speech helps young children to plan strategies and regulate their behaviour so that they are more likely to accomplish their goals. As such, language plays a critical role in cognitive development by helping children organize their thoughts and become more proficient problem solvers. Further, Vygotsky’s position suggests that this early speech pattern or “private speech” never fully disappears, but becomes a silent inner speech that serves as a “cognitive self-guidance system” used to regulate everyday behaviour in later years. 

Vygotsky’s sociocutlural theory has greatly impacted the historical trajectory of developmental psychology as it has posed a strong challenge to universalist notions of cognitive development and has reminded us that cognitive growth is best understood within the cultural and social contexts in which it occurs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Erikson===

Freud’s work attracted many followers, however his pupils did not always agree with his teachings.  Many began to modify Freud’s work and as a result, became important theorists in their own right.  Among the most notable neo-Freudian scholars was German born, '''Erik Homburger Erikson'''(1902 – 1994). 

It was in the summer of 1927 when Erik, then a young artist, took a job in a school founded for the children of Sigmund Freud’s patients and friends.  While working in this school, he associated with the psychoanalysts and later became trained by them.  He began to practice psychotherapy, marked by a change in his name from Homburger to Erikson, and eventually began to promote his own ideas on the nature of human personality and its development.  While he maintained several of Freud’s ideas in his theorizing, he made several of his own contributions to psychoanalytic thinking around development (Burger, 2000). 

One of Erikson's greatest contribution was to propose eight stages of development, versus Freud's suggested five.  Particularly, Erikson expanded Freud's genital stage to include adolescence and three stages of adulthood.  Erickson also expanded Freud's theory by emphasizing the psychosocial outcomes of development by suggesting that a major psychological conflict is resolved at each psychosexual stage of development, which allows the individual who resolves the conflict to acquire skills and attitudes that permit him or her to contribute constructively to the society (Berk, 2000).

Erik Erikson's theory of psychosocial development contended that each life stage includes a crisis that requires resolution.  Erikson posited that young children wrestle with issues of trust, autonomy, and initiative; school aged children wrestle with the issue of competence; adolescents wrestle with the issues of identity and itimacy; and adults wrestle with issues of generativity and integrity.

'''Erikson's Stages of Psychosocial Development''' - Adapted from (Myers, 1998)

*'''Infancy (1st year): Trust vs. Mistrust:''' 
:If needs are met, infants develop a sense of basic trust
*'''Toddler (2nd year): Autonomy vs. Shame &amp; Doubt:''' 
:Toddlers learn to exercise will and do things for themselves, or they doubt their abilities
*'''Preschooler (3-5 years): Initiative vs. Guilt:''' 
:Preschoolers learn to initiate tasks and carry out plans, or they feel guilty about trying to be independent
*'''Elementary School (6 years to puberty): Competence vs. Inferiority:''' 
:Children learn the pleasure of applying themselves to tasks, or they feel inferior
*'''Adolescence (Teen years into 20s): Identity vs. Role Confusion:''' 
:Adolescents aim to refine a sense of self by testing and integrating ‘roles’ to form a single *'''Young Adulthood (20s to early 40s): Intimacy vs. Isolation:''' 
:Young adults struggle to form close relationships and capacity for intimate love, or they feel socially isolated
*'''Middle Adulthood (40s – 60s): Generative vs. Stagnation:''' 
:Middle-aged adults discover a sense of contributing to the world (usually through family and work), or they may feel a lack of purpose
*'''Late Adulthood (Late 60s and up): Integrity vs. Despair:''' 
:Older adults develop a feeling of satisfaction when reflecting on their life, or they may feel a sense of failure

Erikson's interests in social development and in particular, the development of one's sense of self, can be traced back to his childhood experiences and personal struggles with his own identity. Born to a Jewish father and Danish mother, Erikson grew up conflicted by his sense of self, he was “scored as a Jew in school but mocked as a Gentile in the synagogue because of his blond hair and blue eyes” (Hunt, 1993, p. 391).  

'''Contributions and Criticisms of Erikson’s Theory:'''

Erikson's theory of social development is typically more accepted than Freud's theory which emphasizes humans' instinctual drives (Shaffer, 1999).  Rather than viewing children as passive beings, driven by their instincts and shaped by their parents, Erikson stressed that children are active, curious explorers who are rational, adaptive in nature and impacted by social and cultural influences.  In his eight proposed stages of development, he captured many of life’s central issues, such as, emotional development in infants, self-concept development in childhood, identity issues in adolescence, etc.  His work is relatable, as it emphasises many of the personal dilemmas and social conflicts that people experience and are able to recognize in others (Shaffer, 1999).

Despite his lasting contributions to the thinking around development, Erikson has been criticized by his peers for being too vague about the actual causes of development.  Unfortunately, Erikson was not explicit about what influences an individual to develop in certain ways or how the outcome of each psychosocial stage later influences personality.  However, Erikson’s work has helped to advance our understanding of social development, his theory being more descriptive in nature has also left some unanswered questions about how or why development takes place (Shaffer, 1999).

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Lawrence Kohlberg===

Lawrence Kohlberg (October 25, 1927 - January 19, 1987) was an American psychologist born in Bronxville, New York.  Famous for his work in moral education and reasoning, Kohlberg proposed a stage theory of moral development that is thought to extend the work of Jean Piaget’s Theory of Cognitive Development.

Kohlberg focused on the development of moral judgments in children rather than on their actions. He saw the child as a &quot;moral philosopher.&quot; Like Piaget, Kohlberg gathered his data by asking subjects questions about hypothetical stories. One of these stories has become famous as a classical ethical dilemma:

:In Europe, a woman was near death from a special kind of cancer. There was one drug that the doctors thought might save her. It was a form of radium that a druggist in the same town had recently discovered. The drug was expensive to make but the druggist was charging ten times what the drug cost him to make. He paid $200.00 for the radium and charged $2000.00 for a small dose of the drug. The sick woman's husband, Heinz, went to everyone he knew to borrow the money, but he could only get together about $1,000.00 (which was half of what it cost). Heinz told the druggist that his wife was dying and asked him to sell it to him cheaper or let him pay later. The druggist said, &quot;no, I discovered the drug and I am going to make money from it.&quot;  Heinz got desperate and broke into the man's store to steal the drug for his wife. Should the husband have done that?

Based on his analysis of the answers that children provided to this ethical dilemma, Kohlberg developed his stage model of moral development.

'''Kohlberg's Stages in the Development of Moral Judgment'''

'''Level 1 - Preconventional'''
*'''Stage 1 - Obedience-and-Punishment Orientation'''
:The child obeys rules to avoid punishment and there is no internalization of moral standards.  The child finds it difficult to consider two points of view in a moral dilemma and instead they focus on fear of authority and avoidance of punishment as reasons for behaving morally (Berk, 2000).
:Pro: Theft is justified because the drug did not cost much to provide.
:Con: Theft is condemned because Heinz will be caught and go to jail.
*'''Stage 2 - Naive Hedonistic and Instrumental Orientation'''
:The child becomes aware that people can have different perspectives in a moral dilemma; however, the child's behaviour is motivated by a selfish desire to obtain rewards and benefits. Although reciprocity occurs, it is self-serving, manipulative, and based on a market-place outlook. For example, &quot;You can play with my blocks if you let me play with your cars&quot; would be a common type of statement for children within this stage.
:Pro: Theft is justified because his wife needs the drug.  Heinz needs his wife's companionship and help in life.
:Con: Theft is condemned because his wife will probably die before Heinz gets out of jail, so it will not do him much good.

'''Level 2 - Conventional'''
*'''Stage 3 - &quot;Good Boy&quot; - &quot;Nice Girl&quot; Morality'''
:The child is concerned with winning the approval and avoiding disapproval of others.  In judging the goodness or badness of behavior, the child considers a person's ''intentions''. The child holds the conception of a morally good person as one who possesses a set of virtues and as a result, the child places much emphasis on being &quot;nice.&quot;
:Pro: Theft is justified because Heinz is unselfish in looking after the needs of his wife.
:Con: Theft is condemned because Heinz will feel bad thinking of how he brought dishonour to his family and his family will be ashamed of his act.
*'''Stage 4 - &quot;Law-and-order&quot; Orientation'''
:The individual blindly accepts social convention and rules. Emphasis is on &quot;doing one's duty,&quot; showing respect to authority, and maintaining a given social order for its own sake. Moral choices no longer depend on close ties to others at this stage and instead, rules are seen as needing to be enforced in the same manner for everyone.
:Pro: Theft is justified because Heinz would otherwise have been responsible for his wife's death.
:Con: Theft is condemned because Heinz is a lawbreaker.

'''Level 3 - Postconventional'''
*'''Stage 5 - Social Contract Orientation'''
:The individual believes that the purpose of the law is to preserve human rights and that unjust laws should be changed. Morality is seen as based on an agreement among individuals to conform to laws that are necessary for the community welfare. Since it is a social contract, it can be modified as long as basic rights like life and liberty are not impaired.
*'''Stage 6 - Universal Ethical Principal Orientation'''
:Conduct is controlled by an internalized set of ideas, which, if violated, results in self-condemnation and guilt. The individual follows self-chosen ethical principals based on abstract concepts (e.g., the equality of human rights, the Golden Rule, respect for the dignity of each human being) rather than concrete rules (e.g., the Ten Commandments). Unjust laws may be broken because they conflict with broad moral principals.
:Pro: Theft is justified because Heinz would not have lived up to the standards of his conscience if he had allowed his wife to die.
:Con: Theft is condemned because Heinz did not live up to the standards of his conscience when he engaged in stealing.

'''Criticisms of Kohlberg's Theory'''

Carol Gilligan questioned the influence of gender on Kohlberg's work on moral development because Kohlberg's theory was developed based on interviews that Kohlberg had conducted exclusively with male participants.  Gilligan noted that Kohlberg's theory devalued qualities most encouraged in females, specifically an &quot;ethic of care,&quot; and stressed those qualities most encouraged in males, that is &quot;justice, or an abstract, rational commitment to moral ideals&quot; (Berk, 2000). 

In addition to being questioned about the influence of gender, others have suggested that Kohlberg's theory of moral development is culturally-biased. Specifically, researchers have posited that the highest stages of his theory reflect a westernized ideal of justice based on individualistic thought and that it is biased against those that live in non-Western societies that do not value individualism as much (Shaffer, Wood, &amp; Willoughby, 2002).

Finally, '''Shaffer and colleagues (2002)''' have criticized Kohlberg's theory of moral development for several important reasons.  First, they argue that Kohlberg neglects to take into account the central role that emotion plays in morality.  Given that emotions play a critical role in influencing our thoughts and motivating our actions, it seems critical that emotion be part of the model.  Second, they criticize Kohlberg's model because it underestimates the moral sophistication of elementary school children.  By focusing so heavily on legalistic concepts perhaps this model underestimates the moral sophistication of even very young children.  Lastly, Shaffer and colleagues (2002) state that Kohlberg's model is deficient because he fails to consider that moral reasoning is not a good predictor of moral behaviour.  If someone's self report of how they would act is not a good predictor of how they will actually act then perhaps Kohlberg's theory lacks generalizability and utility.

===Carol Gilligan===

Feminist, ethicist and psychologist '''Carol Gilligan''' was born in New York on November 28, 1936. Before turning to psychology, she studied English literature at Swarthmore College. She received her MA in clinical psychology from Radcliff College and her Ph.D. in social psychology from Harvard University.  

After graduating, she worked as a lecturer at the University of Chicago for one year (1965-1966). She was subsequently hired by Harvard University and she received tenure as a full professor in 1986. During her tenure, Gilligan also spent two years teaching at the University of Cambridge in England as a Pitt Professor of American History and Institutions (1992-1994). In 1997, Harvard University School of Education appointed Gilligan to the endowed Patricia Albjerg Graham Chair in Gender Studies. This was the first Harvard University position in gender studies. 

As part of her position at the School of Education, Gilligan initiated the Harvard Project on Women's Psychology and Girls' Development. She also worked with the Strengthening Healthy Resistance and Courage in Girls program. 

Gilligan's early research career was influenced by her work with Lawrence Kohlberg. She began to develop an interest and primary focus on girls' moral development as a result of her observation that Kohlberg theory was based on his interview with privileged white men and boys. She felt that Kohlberg theory was biased and she developed a model of moral development based on her research with women. 

Carol Gilligan's Stages of Moral Development

*Pre-conventional - Goal is individual survival
*Conventional - Self-sacrifice is goodness
*Post-conventional - Principle of nonviolence: do not hurt others or self

Some of Gilligan's major contributions: 

:Psychological theory and women’s development (1982)
:Mapping the moral domain (1988)
:Making Connection (1990)
:Women, girls and psychotherapy: Reframing Resistance (1991)
:Meeting at the crossroads: Women’s psychology and girls’ development (1992)
:Between Voice and Silence: Women and Girls, Race and Relationships (1995)
:Birth of Pleasure (2002)

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Longstanding Questions &amp; Controversies About Human Development===

''What exactly causes development and what course does it follow? '' 
Developmental theorists have pondered and debated over these questions for decades.  In an effort to explain the complexities of human development, psychologists (such as those discussed above) have proposed and tested theories over the years; however, consensus around development’s true cause and course has yet to be established (Shaffer, 1999).  

Throughout psychological history and still in present day, three key issues remain among which developmental theorists often disagree.  Particularly, often disputed is the role of early experiences on later development in opposition to current behaviour reflecting present experiences – namely the passive verses active issue.  Likewise, whether or not development is best viewed as occurring in stages or rather as a gradual and cumulative process of change has traditionally been up for debate – a question of continuity versus discontinuity.  Further, the role of heredity and the environment in shaping human development is a much contested topic of discussion – also referred to as nature/nurture debate. 


'''The Active/Passive Issue:'''

A key topic of debate among developmental theorists revolves around the issue of ‘active’ or ‘passive’ development (Shaffer, 1999).  Of interest is whether or not children should be viewed as active contributors to their own development (i.e. influence how others treat them) or as passive recipients impressed upon by others and their environment.  

Only a generation ago, most people, including psychologists, believed that the “footprints of our genes and early experience [were] set in cement” (Myers, 1998, p. 143).  They believed that in response to these events, one’s development would follow a stable life course. For example, early psychoanalytic theorists like Freud believed that children were passive beings moulded by their parents.

On the other hand, psychologists like Erikson believed that children develop as a response to their adaptations to their environments and social/cultural influences.  It wasn’t until the 1960s, that new findings surfaced suggesting that personality and development evolved with time and frequently undergo surprising and unpredictable changes.  For example, longitudinal research by Jean Macfarlane (1964), in which 166 people were followed from infancy to age 30, found that many of the participants who had severely troubled childhoods and adolescences were later rated as some of the most “mature and competent” adults within the study.  Research by Thomas and Chess (1986) report similar results.  

Thus, as Bernice Neugarten (1980) once said upon reflecting on her work on changes within the life cycle, “the primary consistency we have found is lack of consistency”.


'''The Continuity/Discontinuity Issue:'''

The debate among theorists about developmental change occurring steadily and over time or suddenly and perhaps in stages has been longstanding and has fuelled much of developmental thinking and research.  

Continuity theorists view human development as an “additive process that occurs gradually and continuously, without sudden change” (Shaffer, 1999, p. 40).  Whereas discontinuity theorists describe developmental growth as occurring through a series of abrupt changes, each which “elevates the child to a new and presumably more advanced level functioning” (p. 40).  

In our account of prominent historical developmental researchers, several stage or discontinuity theorists have been considered: Piaget on cognitive development, Kohlberg on moral development, Erikson on social development and Freud on personality development.   Over time, research has been conducted to support the idea that stage development may be true to certain times within development.  For example, Thatcher, Walker and Guidice (1987) has found that there are spurts of brain growth during childhood and puberty that approximately correspond to Piaget’s proposed stages.  However, despite the groundbreaking work of these theorists, they have also faced criticisms demonstrating that life may not always progress through a fixed, predictable set of steps as suggested (see criticisms of each theorist above).  Rather, theorists such as Vygotsky, discuss change as it occurs progressively and in accordance with ever-changing social and cultural influences.

===The Nature Nurture Debate===

One of the most important and long standing questions that has been debated by both philosophers and psychologists is whether or not we develop as individuals because of the biological contributions we receive from our parents (genetics) or environmental experience we gain after birth (Myers, 1998).

Here is how a few of the most prominent philosophers and psychologists weighed in on the issue:
*In the 17th century, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Locke John Locke] used the term &quot;tabula rasa&quot; to describe the state of the mind at birth as a &quot;blank slate.&quot;  Locke posited that it is only through our senses (experiences) that we come to develop ways of perceiving and ultimately understanding the world (Myers, 1998).  This view of ''empiricists'' is in contrast to that of ''nativists'', who believed that certain elementary truths are innate to the human mind and need not be gained through experience.
*G. Stanley Hall was one of the earliest psychologists to propose a theory of adolescent development.  He believed that all individuals pass through the same four stages of development and that progression through these stages was based on physiological factors (genetics).  Development was framed as an &quot;unchangeable, universal pattern, and the effects of the environment [were thought to be] minimal&quot; (Dacey &amp; Travers, 1996, 284).
*[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Galton Sir Francis Galton] assumed that &quot;talent is transmitted by inheritance in a very remarkable degree&quot; (Galton, 1865, 157).  As support for this claim Galton argued that the most desirable human traits, such as height or intelligence, tend to run in families.  Taking this notion one step further, Galton believed that we as a society could strive for human betterment by mating those people with the most desirable traits, as they would pass on their genes and likely produce the most favourable offspring.  It was this belief that founded the Eugenics movement. 

Today, it is generally agreed upon that it is neither genetics nor environment alone that determine how we develop as individuals; but rather, genetics, environment, and the interaction between the two, are all thought to have a part in explaining how we develop.  Traditional studies within the field of child development have primarily focussed on the impact that the family has on children.  However, these studies confound the influence of genetics and environment because parents are the providers of both genes and environment.  In order to tease apart the influence of genetics and environment, designs that are genetically sensitive must be utilized (Jenkins, 2006).

'''Twin Studies''' are one way to help tease apart genetic and environmental influences.  Using this design, researchers compare monozygotic twins (MZ twins), who share 100% of their genes, to dyzygotic twins (DZ twins), who only share 50% of their genes.  Knowing how genetically similar twins are and comparing how behaviourally similar they are allows researchers to infer the relative importance of genes and environment.  If monozygotic twins (MZ) are proven to be ''more similar'' on a given trait or characteristic when compared to dyzygotic twins (DZ), it would suggest that there is a strong genetic component to that trait or characteristic.  However, if monozygotic twins (MZ) are found to be ''no more similar'' to each other on a given trait or characteristic when compared to (DZ) twins, it would suggest that there is a strong environmental component to that trait or characteristic.

'''Adoption Studies''' are another important way of disentangling genetic and environmental effects.  That is, studying children who were brought up from an early age by parents other than the ones who conceived them (Schaffer, 1996).   Adopted children can be compared to their adoptive parents to determine how similar or different they are from each other.  If adoptive parents and children are found to be similar to one another than this is likely support for environmental influence (because they do not share genetic material).  Adopted children can also be compared to their biological parents (those which they have not been reared by).  If biological parents and adopted children share similar characteristics, this lends support to the argument for genetic influences.  However, adoption studies are not lacking criticism.  Oftentimes 1) biological parents cannot or do not wanted to be located/do not wish to be tested and 2) children who are going to be adopted are often placed with families that resemble or share characteristics with their biological parents (Schaffer, 1996).

Finally, recent developments in the field of '''Molecular Genetics''' have allowed for the &quot;investigation of gene-environment interaction in behaviour&quot; (Jenkins, 2006).  It is believed that polymorphisms on specific genes may actually make some children more ''vulnerable'' than others to negative  influences within their environments (Caspi ''et al.'', 2002).  Levels of symptomatology or psychopathology within individuals are then examined as a function of 1) genetics, 2) the environment, and 3) the combined effects of genetics and the environment, referred to as the 'gene-environment interaction.'

It is interesting however, to examine the history and assumptions behind the twin studies method. Classical twin studies were inspired by the writings of Francis Galton and build upon the family pedigrees studies of eugenicist Abraham Myerson (1925).  In the past, family studies demonstrating clustering of particular traits or so-called mental disorders were taken as “proof” of the genetic argument. This search for the culprit genes and demonstration of the inheritibility of psychological traits and disorders continues. The belief in the inheritance of certain psychological traits deemed undesirable is one of the reason thousands of individuals were sterilized without their consent in the 1900s. 

One of the main theoretical assumption of twin-studies is that of the “equal environment assumption.” In classical twin-studies examining MZ and DZ reared in similar environment, it is argued that higher concordance rates of a psychological trait or condition in MZ vs DZ demonstrates the genetic basis and inheritibility of this trait or condition. However, MZ share a more similar prenatal and perinatal environment than DZ twins. DZ share the same placenta, they are treated more similarly, they are more often raised as a unit and spend more time together then MZ twins. As a result, it is not possible to completely tease apart the environment from the genetic influence or their interaction. For instance, if a particular disorder is associated with exposure to a toxin in the environment, it is more likely that DZ twins will share similar levels of exposure in comparison to MZ twins. Thus, it is problematic to conclude inheritance based on higher concordance rates of MZ vs DZ twins. 

Studies of twins reared apart are also problematic, at least with regard to the pre-natal environment. The role of early bonding and attachment experiences prior to being separated would also need to be taken into consideration given their influence on  psychological functioning.

      <text xml:space="preserve">====Brief History of the DSM====

The first edition of the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'' (DSM-I) was published in 1952, and listed about 60 different disorders. DSM-II was published in 1968. Both of these editions were strongly influenced by the psychodynamic approach. There was no sharp distinction made between normal and abnormal, and all disorders were considered reactions to environmental events. 

The early editions of the DSM distinguished between a psychosis and a neurosis. A psychosis is a severe mental disorder characterized by a break with reality. Psychoses typically involve hallucinations, delusions, and illogical thinking. A neurosis is a milder mental disorder characterized by distortions of reality, but not a complete break with reality. Neuroses typically involve anxiety and depression. 

In 1980, with DSM-III, the psychodynamic view was abandoned and the medical model became the primary approach, introducing a clear distinction between normal and abnormal. The DSM became &quot;atheoretical&quot;, since it attempted to have no preferred etiology for mental disorders. In 1987 the DSM-III-R appeared as a revision of DSM-III. 

In 1994, it evolved into DSM-IV. The most recent version is the 'Text Revision' of the DSM-IV, also known as the DSM-IV-TR, published in 2000. DSM-5, is not scheduled for publication until 2013.

====Introduction to the DSM-IV-TR====

The ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition, Text Revision'' (DSM-IV-TR) is the manual used to diagnose mental illnesses in North America right now (The ''International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Health Related Problems-10'' [ICD-10] is used in the rest of the world). It is put out by the American Psychiatric Association. It comprises a list of clinical entities that have been constructed and defined by people with particular interests (psychiatrists, psychologists, medical doctors). These individuals met and agreed upon lists of criteria (signs and symptoms) that need to be present for a particular diagnosis to be assigned. 

====Utility of the DSM====

The DSM can help clinicians choose the best treatment for any particular person. It also helps with classification for research purposes. In addition, having a DSM diagnosis can provide access to funding for treatment (i.e., through insurance companies).

The DSM provides professionals within the world of psychology a common language in which to talk about mental disorders.  Clinicians are able to discuss cases and be more confident that their colleagues will understand what they are referring to when they state that a patient meets diagnostic criteria for say 'depression' or 'anxiety'.

====Validity and reliability issues====

The validity and reliability problems associated with diagnostic activities are well-documented, but not often widely recognized and discussed (Ericksen &amp; Kress, 2005; Kutchings &amp; Kirk, 1997). One of the problems with diagnosis is that there are different classification systems (e.g., DSM-IV-TR and ICD-10) using different labels and criteria. This creates some problems in clinical practice. For instance, psychologists trained in Canada generally use the DSM-IV-TR. If they are called to work in the Motor-Vehicle Accident industry, they have to use ICD codes in administrative procedures, but will often use DSM-IV-TR codes in their psychological reports. 

Even within one classification system, validity and reliability problems are prevalent. In addition, co-morbidity in clinical practice is more the rule than the exception, which then raises doubt about the validity of these illnesses as distinct. 

Another issue is that the DSM is revised every 10 or so years, which points to the lack of reliability and validity of the manual (i.e., how can we trust these sets of criteria if they are constantly changing--presumably the disorders are not actually changing).

====Stigma or Damage of Labelling and other Critical Issues====

There are many arguments for and against the use of DSM-IV-TR diagnoses. This section discusses the effects of diagnoses more broadly and pays particular attention to the actual lived experience of those who have experienced this process. 

Giving someone a label can be stigmatizing in that people often have preconceived ideas about certain diagnoses.  For instance, some clinicians prefer not to work with people diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder, as clients with that diagnosis are often considered &quot;difficult to work with.&quot;  In addition, a person who received such a diagnosis and looks it up on the internet might become discouraged and feel that he or she is hopeless.  

Labels can also prevent the clinician from seeing factors that might be unique for clients with the same diagnosis in that it can make the clinician interpret everything the client does as consistent with the label. One controversial study by David Rosenhan (1973) demonstrated this point quite effectively. Rosenhan and seven of his colleagues were admitted to mental hospitals (and designated &quot;mentally ill&quot;) after complaining that they were &quot;hearing voices.&quot;  Once admitted to the mental hospital, Rosenhan and the other patients no longer purposefully exhibited any further symptoms and they were completely honest when their life history interviews were conducted. In spite of this, the clinicians who worked with the &quot;patients&quot; often interpretted their seemingly normal behaviour as disordered (e.g. writing in a journal was interpretted as excessive notetaking)and were able to uncover the causes of their disorders by analyzing their quite normal life histories.

On the other hand, some feel that &quot;diagnosis and &quot;labeling&quot; is often helpful to the individual. People with psychological difficulties often feel isolated, alone, and misunderstood; labeling tells  the suffering person &quot;you're understood, and there are others with similar experiences. You're not alone.&quot; Labeling (i.e., diagnosing) a psychological disorder provides a framework and language with which to communicate. It also can provide access to funding for treatment, which some individuals would otherwise not have access to.

A further argument in support of diagnosis involves treatment implications. Specifically, some suggest that providing a working diagnosis throughout therapy guides treatment efforts in order to best help clients. 

Ronald Bassman (1999; 2001), a psychologist and self-identified psychiatric survivor, as well as other professionals with similar experiences have widely written about the damaging impact of diagnosis. Their difficulties in living and emotional distress was made worse in part because the label they received suggested poor prognosis (e.g., chronicity of schizophrenia) and in part because it guided treatment that they experienced as very damaging (e.g., ECT for a diagnosis of depression leading to permanent memory loss, forced neuroleptic drugging for diagnosis of schizophrenia leading to post-traumatic stress symptoms, forced insulin shock treatment for psychotic disorders NOS). They argue that individuals with psychological difficulties can best be supported and feel understood through community and empowerment processes (see also Burstow, 2004; 2005; 2006).

The use of psychiatric diagnoses cannot be detached from the history of psychiatry. Even if no biological tests exists to &quot;diagnose&quot; so-called mental disorders, the biomedical model of emotional distress continues to prevail. This is likely partly due to our being part of a capitalistic society, in that workers in mental health require a structure and guidelines in order to receive pay for service.  Without diagnoses, it is difficult to quantify and document time and treatment provided to clients, and therefore, little justification or basis for fee-for-service.

====Alternatives to the DSM-IV-TR====

Other systems for diagnosis include the ''Diagnostic Classification of Mental Health And Development Disorders Of Infancy and Early Childhood: DC: 0-3R'', a manual designed for diagnosing difficulties (including relational problems) in very young children by the Zero to Three organization (2005). As mentioned above ICD-10 is typically used outside of North America. Psychodynamically-oriented clinicians also recently created their own manual called the ''Psychodynamic Diagnostic Manual'' (PDM; 2006)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The ''ў'' Letter==

The ''у нескладо́вае'' letter is considered a consonant. However, it has all features of a vowel except one - it does not make a syllable (''нескладовае'' means ''non-syllabic'').

The ''ў'' letter is always preceded by a vowel. Together they form something like English diphthongs: ''ow'' in ''slow'' etc.

'''воўк''' &quot;vouk&quot; a wolf

'''ла́ўка''' &quot;lauka&quot; a bench

A y-vowel following the ''ў'' letter is read with a ''й'' sound.

'''здаро́ўе''' &quot;zdarouye&quot; health

Other vowels never follow ''ў''. If as a result of word flexion or derivation ''ў'' gets in such a position, it is replaced by ''в''. The opposite is also true. The ''в'' letter is never followed by a consonant, and can not be the final letter of the word. In such a position, it is replaced by ''ў''.

'''ла́ўка''' &quot;lauka&quot; a bench - '''ла́вачка''' &quot;lavachka&quot; a bench (diminutive)

'''хлеў''' &quot;khleu&quot; a shed - '''хлявы́''' &quot;khliavy&quot; sheds

'''здаро́вы''' &quot;zdaróvy&quot; healthy, in good health - '''здаро́ўе''' &quot;zdarouye&quot; health

==Singular Nouns Genitive==

Nouns, adjectives, pronouns and adjective-like determiners are deflected by cases. So far, we have dealt with the Nominative, which is the initial case. Nominative singular (Nominative singular masculine for adjectives) is the word form to be searched in a dictionary.

The Genitive case is used to denote a kind of &quot;kinship&quot; between objects: a whole-to-part relation, a producer-to-product relation etc. In such cases, the &quot;master&quot; word (whole, producer etc.) would be Genitive.

In English such relations are usually denoted by the ''of'' preposition. Thus, a Genitive word ''X'' will most probably be translated to English as ''of (the) X''. The opposite is also true. In Belarusian, there is no preposition that directly corresponds to the English ''of'' word. The ''of+noun'' expression would most probably be denoted by the Genitive in Belarusian.

===Feminine===

Singular feminine nouns have ''ы'' or ''і'' endings in the Genitive - exactly the same as Nominative plural forms.

'''шко́ла''' a school - '''шко́лы''' of a school (or schools)

'''до́ля''' a part, a share - '''до́лі''' of a part (or parts)

'''ко́шка''' a cat - '''ко́шкі''' of a cat (or cats)

'''ноч''' a night - '''но́чы''' of a night (or nights)

'''гусь''' a goose - '''гу́сі''' of a goose (or geese)

With feminine nouns having stressed endings in Nominative singular, the stressed is not shifted in the Genitive. Thus, Genitive singular and Nominative plural differ for such words.

'''вада́''' water - '''вады́''' of water - '''во́ды''' waters

'''зямля́''' a land - '''зямлі''' of a land - '''зе́млі''' lands

'''рака́''' a river - '''ракі''' of a river - '''рэ́кі''' rivers

Masculine nouns ending in ''а'' or ''я'' form the Genitive in the same way.

'''мужчы́на''' a man - '''мужчы́ны''' of a man (or men)

'''саба́ка''' a dog - '''саба́кі''' of a dog (or dogs)

===Neuter===

Neuter nouns ending in ''о'', ''а'' have ''а'' ending in the Genitive, and neuter nouns ending in ''е'', ''ё'' take the ''я'' ending in the Genitive.

'''акно́''' a window - '''акна́''' of a window

'''ко́ла''' (of) a wheel

'''по́ле''' a field - '''по́ля''' of a field

===Masculine===

The most difficult situation is about masculine nouns ending with a consonant. They can take either ''а'' (''я'' for soft consonants) or ''у'' (''ю'' for soft consonants) ending. The rule to distinct these two cases is rather complicated.

The ''а'' (''я'') ending is taken by masculine nouns that denote

(a) animate creatures, i.e. people and animals

'''чалаве́к''' a person - '''чалаве́ка''' of a person

'''воўк''' a wolf - '''ваўка́''' of a wolf

'''конь''' a horse - '''каня́''' of a horse

(b) countable objects

'''стол''' a table - '''стала́''' of a table

'''хлеў''' a shed - '''хлява́''' of a shed

(c) body parts

'''нос''' a nose - '''но́са''' of a nose

'''хвост''' a tail - '''хваста́''' of a tail

''BUT'' '''твар''' a face - '''тва́ру''' of a face

(d) public organisations

'''заво́д''' a factory - '''заво́да''' of a factory

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Models of Human Development===

Theories of child development have evolved over time to reflect &quot;cultural values, philosophical thinking about children, and scientific progress&quot; (Berk, 2000, p. 11).  To fully understand modern theories of child development it is important to consider some of the early ideas that people held about children.

In Medieval times, from the sixth through to the fifteenth century, children were thought of as miniature versions of adults.  Age was viewed as unimportant and a review of family and civil records from that time reveals that the age of persons was rarely mentioned.  Although children were likened to smaller versions of adults (this is especially evident in the art of the time), there was some recognition of the need to protect children from adults who might mistreat them and early writings revealed that there were special instructions specifically outlined for the care of children.  However, there were no theoretical conceptualizations about the &quot;uniqueness&quot; of childhood or separate developmental periods as we have today (Berk, 2000).

The sixteenth century reflected a &quot;revised image of childhood [that] sprang from the religious movement that gave birth to Protestantism&quot; (Berk, 2000, p. 11).  It was believed that children were born evil and that they had to be taught how to become civilized (Shahar, 1990).  As a result, a harsh and punitive parenting style was strongly endorsed.  However, it is unclear whether or not this type of parenting was endorsed by most families at that time.  Moran and Vinovskis (1986) suggest that most Puritan families, emigrating from England to the United States at that time, were reluctant to use such harsh and punitive discipline.  Rather they tried to find a way to balance “discipline with indulgence, severity with permissiveness” (Moran &amp; Vinovskis, 1986, p. 29).  Parents endorsed reason and tried to teach their children how to decipher right from wrong.

In the seventeenth century, the Enlightenment brought new conceptualizations of childhood that “emphasized ideals of human dignity and respect.  Conceptions of childhood appeared that were more humane than those of centuries past” (Berk, 2000, p. 11).  British philosopher, John Locke, believed that children were essentially born as “blank slates” (tabula rasa) and that their character developed through the interaction and experience they had with the world. Children were viewed as having a passive role in their development and the type of person that they became was attributable to those persons and/or sensory experiences that “wrote on their slate.”  Locke promoted kind and compassionate treatment of children and believed that it was parents’ responsibility to serve as “rational tutors” for children, molding children through positive instruction and example (Berk, 2000).

During the eighteenth century the idea that children were “blank slates” to be written on by others was discarded and replaced with the idea that children were “noble savages, naturally endowed with a sense of right and wrong and with an innate plan for orderly, healthy growth” (Berk, 2000, p. 12).  French philosopher, Jean Jacques Rousseau adopted a child-centered approach to development which emphasized adult responsiveness to the needs of children at four different stages of development including: infancy, childhood, late childhood, and adolescence.

Rousseau’s approach to child development was the first to introduce the concepts of ''stages of development'' and ''maturation'' (two concepts that are still found in modern theories of child development), as childhood was defined as something unique from adulthood that progressed in a discontinuous and stepwise process (Berk, 2000).

Currently, a much more humanist view of children is discussed in the fields of pre- and perinatal psychology and other areas of psychology. The idea that even pre-born children can feel pain, react to the emotional experiences of their mother, and learn is recognized.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In the 19th century the behaviorist school of thought had some components in common with the more popular Psychoanalytic and Gestalt theories of psychology.  There were far more differences however, especially relating to internal states of mind, consciousness and the concept of private events. Behaviorism can be considered a philosophy of psychology that explains all things that organisms do.  This chapter will include the major contributions to the behaviorist movement from John Watson, Ivan Pavlov, B.F. Skinner and Albert Bandura. 


===Behaviorism===

====John B Watson (1878-1958)====
John Broadus Watson (1878-1958) is widely regarded as having been the founder of the school of behaviorism, which dominated much of North American psychology between 1920 and 1960. The central tenets of behaviorism are that scientific psychology must focus on the relationship between environmental contingencies and behavior, rather than on the presumed contents of consciousness, and that the principles governing behavior of humans and other animals are essentially identical (Greene, 1997).

John B. Watson was born in Travelers Rest, South Carolina, on January 9, 1878, into a very poor family.  Watson was the fourth of six children. While he later described himself as a poor student, he entered Furman College at the age of 16 and graduated in 1899. A connection between one of Watson's professors at Furman, Gordon B. Moore, and the University of Chicago, seems to have smoothed the way for his entry to Chicago's graduate school. In 1901, Watson decided to major in psychology, under the supervision of James Rowland Angell (1869-1949), a leading functionalist, and minor in both philosophy under John Dewey (1959-1952) and neurology under Henry Herbert Donaldson (1857-1938). During his tenure at Chicago, Watson also took neurology courses from the famous German biologist Jacques Loeb (1859-1924). His dissertation, accepted in 1903, described the neurological and psychological development of the white rat.  Watson graduated from the University of Chicago in 1903. His dissertation, &quot;Animal Education: An Experimental Study on the Psychical Development of the White Rat, Correlated with the Growth of its Nervous System,&quot; described the neurological and psychological development of the white rat and is the first modern scientific book on rat behavior. 

In 1905 Watson travelled to Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore to learn vivisectional techniques, and returned to Chicago as an instructor in 1906. The following year, 1907, he was offered the post of associate professor at Johns Hopkins by James Mark Baldwin (1861-1934), the famous developmental-psychological theorist, and founding editor of the prestigious journal, Psychological Review. Within weeks of Watson's arrival, Baldwin was forced from his chair by a scandal, leaving Watson in charge of both the department and the journal. 

In 1913, Watson published what is sometimes considered his most important work, the article &quot;Psychology as the Behaviorist Views It&quot;--sometimes called &quot;The Behaviorist Manifesto.&quot; The following year, 1914, he published the book, &quot;Behavior: An Introduction to Comparative Psychology&quot;, and in 1915 he became President of the American Psychological Association. The following year he extended behaviorism to the study of mental illness. Soon after, came one of his most important books , &quot;Psychology from the Standpoint of a Behaviorist (1919). 
Watson was influenced by the Nobel Prize-winning (1904) work of Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov (1849-1936) on conditioned reflexes. Soon after, Watson began adopting and adapting Pavlov's &quot;reflexological&quot; terminology to human behavior. In 1920 he published his most famous conditioning experiment; the &quot;Little Albert&quot; study in which he produced, in a small child, conditioned fear of a white rabbit by repeatedly pairing it with the loud &quot;clang&quot; of a metal bar. This conditioned fear was then shown to generalize to other white furry objects. The controversy about this experiment is actually a modern development. There seemed to be little concern about it in Watson's time. 

Although Watson's academic star burned brightly, it was destined to be short-lived.  He had an affair with Rosalie Raynor, his graduate student assistant, and divorced his first wife. He was asked by the university to resign his position. Watson later married Raynor and the two remained together until her death in 1935. After leaving his academic position, he continued to publish books on Behaviorism (1924), and The Psychological Care of Infant and Child (1928). In 1930s his main career interest had shifted to the advertising business, and he ended his scholarly pursuits. He spent his last years living a reclusive life on a farm in Connecticut. Before his death, Watson burned many of his unpublished personal papers and letters. John B Watson died in 1958 at age 80, shortly after receiving a citation from the American Psychological Association for his contributions to psychology.

===Classical Conditioning===
====Ivan Pavlov (1849-1936)====


Ivan Petrovich Pavlov was born on September 14, 1849 in a small village in central Russia, Ryazan, where his father, Peter Dmitrievich Pavlov, was a village priest . His family hoped that he would become a priest, and he went to a theological seminary. Then, in the 1860s, the cultural environment within the Russian empire changed dramatically. The regime of Tsar Alexander II permitted the publication of Western scientific works in the Russian language. In the Ryazan’ Public Library, Pavlov read popular renditions of physiology and Darwin's theory of evolution (Windholz, 1997). After reading these works, he became interested in natural science and rejected a career in the church. He then matriculated in 1870 at the Faculty of the Physical–Mathematical Sciences of the University of St. Petersburg (Windholz, 1997). 

In 1875,  Pavlov completed his course with an outstanding record and received the degree of Candidate of Natural Sciences. However, impelled by his overwhelming interest in physiology, he decided to continue his studies and proceeded to the Academy of Medical Surgery to take the third course there. He completed this in 1879 and was again awarded a gold medal. In 1883, Pavlov was awarded an MD degree by the Imperial Military–Medical Academy (Gureeva &amp; Chebysheva in Windholz, 1997). After a competitive examination, Pavlov won a fellowship at the Academy.  This together with his position as Director of the Physiological Laboratory at the clinic of the famous Russian clinician, S. P. Botkin, enabled him to continue his research work.

In 1890 Pavlov was invited to organize and direct the Department of Physiology at the Institute of Experimental Medicine. Under his direction, over a period of 45 years, the Institute became one of the most important centres of physiological research. He was also was appointed Professor of Pharmacology at the Military Medical Academy in 1890, and five years later he was appointed to Chair of Physiology, which he held till 1925.

It was at the Institute of Experimental Medicine in the years 1891-1900 that Pavlov did the bulk of his research on the physiology of digestion. Pavlov's research into the physiology of digestion led him logically to create a science of conditioned reflexes. Pavlov was profoundly influenced by Darwin's concept of the struggle for existence and its functionalistic implications. In the 1890s, he hypothesized that the upper tract of animals’ digestive system responded functionally to specific foods, namely, a small salivary secretion to moist foods, such as meat, and a larger salivary secretion to dry foods, such as bread. Pavlov's student, S. G. Vul'fson (1898) tested this hypothesis, finding experimental support for Pavlov's hypothesis. In addition,  Vul'fson found serendipitously that after eating the moist and dry foods, dogs that were “teased” from afar by these foods responded with a corresponding but diminished salivary secretion. Salivation to stimuli presented at a distance was anomalous because, in view of the Cartesian conceptualization of reflexive action, an immediate contact between environmental agents and the organism's sensory receptors was required (Windholz, 1997). The use of precise and sensitive salivary reflex conditioning as a method in the study of the normal animal's cortical processes was of revolutionary significance considering that the previously used method of exploring cortical functions was extirpation performed on a traumatized animal (Pavlov, 1912/1951j in Windholz, 1997). 

In 1903, at the 14th International Medical Congress in Madrid, Pavlov read a paper on «The Experimental Psychology and Psychopathology of Animals». In this paper the definition of conditioned and other reflexes was given and it was shown that a conditioned reflex should be regarded as an elementary psychological phenomenon, which at the same time is a physiological one. It followed from this that the conditioned reflex was a clue to the mechanism of the most highly developed forms of reaction in animals and humans to their environment and it made an objective study of their psychic activity possible.

Subsequently, experiments carried out by Pavlov and his pupils showed that conditioned reflexes originate in the cerebral cortex, which acts as the «prime distributor and organizer of all activity of the organism» and which is responsible for the very delicate equilibrium of an animal with its environment. In 1905 it was established that any external agent could by coinciding in time with an ordinary reflex, become the conditioned signal for the formation of a new conditioned reflex. In connection with the discovery of this general postulate Pavlov proceeded to investigate «artificial conditioned reflexes». Research in Pavlov's laboratories over a number of years revealed for the first time the basic laws governing the functioning of the cortex of the great hemispheres. 

Even in the early stages of his research Pavlov received world acclaim and recognition. In 1901 he was elected a corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, in 1904 he was awarded a Nobel Prize, in 1907 he was elected Academician of the Russian Academy of Sciences, in 1912 he was given an honorary doctorate at Cambridge University, and in the following years honorary membership of various scientific societies abroad. Finally, upon the recommendation of the Medical Academy of Paris, he was awarded the Order of the Legion of Honour (1915).

The Communist Party and the Soviet Government saw to it that Pavlov and his collaborators were given unlimited scope for scientific research. The Soviet Union became a prominent centre for the study of physiology, which was demonstrated by the fact that the 15th International Physiological Congress of August 9-17, 1935, was held in Leningrad and Moscow.

Pavlov nurtured a great school of physiologists, which produced many distinguished pupils. He left the richest scientific legacy, a brilliant group of pupils, who would continue developing the ideas of their master, and a host of followers all over the world. Pavlov died in Leningrad on February 27, 1936.

Pavlov's Classical Conditioning theory states that a neutral stimulus can be paired with an excitatory stimulus to have the previously neutral stimulus elicit the response that is associated with the excitatory stimulus.  According to Classical Conditioning, an unconditioned stimulus (US) (for example, a piece of meat in a dog's mouth) leads to an unconditioned response (UR) (for example, salivation in a dog).  The US can then be paired with a conditioned stimulus (CS) (for example, a bell), which initially elicits no reaction.  It is paired repeatedly until the CS begins to elicit a conditioned response (CR), which in this case is salivation.  The way it would happen is that the bell would ring and then the dog was fed, which was repeated several times until it began to elicit salivation (CR) from the dog in response to the ringing of the bell (CS) even when the food (US) was removed.  The CR could also be eliminated by continuous presentations of the CS without the US (in this case, ringing the bell without giving the dog any food).  This process is called extinction.  However, reintroducing the CS (the ringing of the bell) after a few days following extinction results once again in the CR (salivation), which Pavlov termed spontaneous recovery.

===Operant Conditioning===

'''E. L. Thorndike (1874-1949)'''

In the late 1800s, Thorndike was studying mind reading in children for his Ph.d.  He would ask a child to guess what he was thinking and if they guessed correctly they got a piece of candy.  He soon found that the children made the same guess again if their answer had led to a piece of candy previously.  His research with children was a failure however this led Thorndike to study learning in animals.         Thorndike was most famous for his work with cats.  He built a puzzle box in which he placed a cat inside.  The cat would then thrash around until it happened to press the latch that opened the door so the cat could escape.  The cats were then put back in the box repeatedly.  Eventually, the cat learned to press the latch to escape (Thorndike, 1898).  
Thorndike's research led to his famous Law of Effect (Thorndike, 1927).  The Law of Effect states that if behaviour is followed by positive outcomes, the behaviour will most likely be repeated.  Alternatively, if the behaviour if followed by a negative outcome, the beahviour will not likely be repeated (Thorndike, 1927).  

::Law of Effect:     Learning = Behaviour + Consequence

Thorndike helped steer the field of psychology away from unobservable internal states and focused on measurable and observable behaviour.  

In the 1930's Skinner further expanded Thorndike's theory and Watson's desire for practical psychology of behavioural control.

====B.F.Skinner(1904-1990)====

:&quot;All we need to know in order to describe and explain behavior is this: actions followed by good outcomes are likely to recur, and actions followed by bad outcomes are less likely to recur.&quot; (Skinner, 1953)

B.F. Skinner was responsible for expanding the field of behaviourism as described by Watson.  He described the distinction between '''RESPONDENT CONDITIONING''' and '''OPERANT CONDITIONING''' whereby the consequence of a behaviour controls the future occurrence of the behaviour. 
Through work with animal conditioning Skinner discovered the now famous '''3-term Contingency''':

Skinner was a psychological revolutionary who remains extremely influential in present day psychology, education and behaviourism.  Burrhus Frederic Skinner was born in the small rural town of Susquhanna, Pennsylvania.  He received a BA in English from Hamilton College in New York.  Following graduation, he attempted a career in writing.  After writing poetry and his first book about a 1904 coal strike entitled the ''Digest of Decisions of the Anthracite Board of Conciliation'' he decided that he had little to offer the literary world.  After working at a book store and reading the works of Watson and Pavlov he soon changed his path and moved on to psychology.  He went back to school and received his masters in psychology in 1930 and his doctorate in 1931 from Harvard.    

During his 60 year career, Skinner discovered important principles of operant conditioning, which is a type of learning that involves rewards and punishments.  Skinner was a strict behaviourist and believed that operant conditioning could explain even the most complex of human behaviour.  

'''Skinner's Research on Rats and Pigeons'''

After many attempts at different apparatus for his rats Skinner invented the cumulative recorder, which was used in the analysis of schedules of reinforcement (see section below) and plotted the cumulative number of responses over time.  While working with his rats in the cumulative recorder box (i.e., Skinner box) he discovered that the rate of responding did not depend on on what occurred prior to the behaviour (as Watson and Pavlov stated), but on what occurred after the behaviour.  Unlike the reflexes that Pavlov had studied, this kind of behaviour Skinner described operated on the environment and was controlled by environmental effects.  Skinner named this operant behavior. The process of arranging the contingencies of reinforcement responsible for producing this new kind of behaviour he called operant conditioning (Skinner, 1938). Skinner's work with rats in his operant conditioning apparatuses (often referred to as a 'Skinner box') led him to discover a process he called ''shaping''.  When the rat is initially put in the 'Skinner box' it does not know that it has to push the lever to get food so it is rewarded for successive approximations to the desired behaviour.  For example, first the rat was reinforced for facing the lever, then for going toward the lever, then if it stands on its   hind legs near the lever, then for touching the lever and finally only for pressing the lever.  Skinner also established secondary reinforcers which are events that signal that a positive reinforcement is on the way.  For example, Skinner set up the 'Skinner box' to give food pellets when the rat pressed the lever but only if a signal light was on.  Therefore, the light acts as a secondary reinforcer signaling to the rat that food pellets are available.   

In 1944, during World War II, Skinner received funding for a top secret project to teach pigeons to guide bombs (Project Pigeon).  Skinner trained the pigeons to peck continuously at a target which would in turn hold a missile on a target.  Project Pigeon was discontinued due to another top secret project testing radar.  Although this project was a failure it was successful in that Skinner discovered that pigeons behave more rapidly then rats, allowing more rapid discoveries of the effect of new contingencies (Skinner, 1938).  Skinner never worked with rats again.     

In 1948 he published a paper entitled,'' Superstition' in the Pigeon''.  The pigeons were put in experimental cages and a clock was set to present food at regular intervals regardless of the bird's behaviour.  In this situation operant behaviour usually took place.  For example, one bird was conditioned to turn counter-clock wise in the cages 2 to 3 times between reinforcement.  The conditioning process was usually obvious in that the bird happens to be executing some response at the same time that food appears and as a result it tends to repeat that response.  The bird behaves as if there were a causal relation between its behaviour and the presentation of food, demonstrating a sort of superstition (Skinner, 1948). 


'''Types of reinforcement'''    

''Positive reinforcement''= when a person or animal performs a desired behaviour and gets a desired reward.  For example, when a rat presses the lever (desired behaviour) it is rewarded with a food pellet (desired reward).

''Negative reinforcement''= is when an undesirable event occurs until the person or animal performs a desired behaviour.  For example, he floor of the rat cage is electrified until the rat presses the lever to turn off the electricity.

Positive and negative reinforcement both increase the frequency of a behaviour.

''Punishment''= is the opposite of reinforcement in that it decreases behaviour.  The person or animal performs an undesirable behaviour and an aversive or negative consequence is administered.  


'''Schedules of Reinforcement:'''
In his work with pigeons and rats, Skinner found 4 main schedules of reinforcement; that is, ways in which he could reinforce behavior so that it would continue to occur.  These four types of reinforcement included:

:'''1)Fixed Ratio (FR)'''
::A fixed ratio reinforcement schedule involves waiting for a fixed number of responses to occur and then reinforcing the behaviour the next time the appropriate response is made.

:'''2) Fixed Interval (FI)'''
::A fixed interval reinforcement schedule involves waiting for a fixed time to pass and then reinforcing the behaviour the next time the appropriate response is made.  

:'''3) Variable Ratio (VR)'''
::A variable ratio reinforcement schedule involves providing reinforcement a for response when that response has occurred after a variable number of times.
  
:'''4) Variable Interval (VI)'''
::A variable interval reinforcement schedule involves providing reinforcement for a response when that response has occurred after a variable amount of time has passed.    

Based on Skinner's use of these very different types of reinforcement schedules, he found that variable reinforcement schedules (ratio and interval) were the ones that maintained behaviour best (Miller, 1997)


'''Verbal Behavior'''

&quot;No black scorpion is falling upon this table&quot;

In 1934 Skinner was dining with a professor of philosophy at which time he decided to expand on and promote behaviourism with his company.  His guest acknowledged that science might account for most of human behavior but he challenged it did not include verbal behavior.  He ended the dinner with a challenge asking Skinner to account for his behaviour as he sat there saying, &quot;No black scorpion is falling upon this table&quot;.  The next day began his book Verbal Behavior.  It took him 22 years to complete from 1934 to 1957.    
 
In this book Skinner states that verbal behaviour requires a separate analysis because it does not operate on the environment directly (as non verbal behaviour does), but rather through the behaviour of other people in a verbal conversation (Skinner, 1957).  Verbal Behaviour expands his lab work and principles of selection by consequences to what people say, write, gesture and think.  Skinner claims that the structure of a sentence consists of associations between the words in the sentence.  For example, if a child knows the words 'dog' and 'run' and hears then together in a sentence like &quot;the dog was running&quot; the child may imitate &quot;dog run&quot; and is rewarded/reinforced by their parent.  In this situation the word 'dog' has become a conditioned stimulus for the word 'run'(Skinner, 1957).  Skinner detailed what is often referred to as the four-term contingency model made up of Motivating Operation (MO), Discriminative Stimulus (SD), Response (R), and Reinforcement (Sr). Also within this book he introduced the terms and concepts; mand, tact, audience, relation, echoic, textual and intraverbal (Skinner, 1957).  A mand is most simply a request, a tact is a term for labeling, and echoic is the imitation of language.  Intraverbal is a verbal behaviour that is under the instructional control of other verbal behaviour.  There are two types of intraverbal fill-ins (e.g., &quot;A dog...?&quot; and the child fill in &quot;barks&quot;) and wh- questions (e.g., child responds to &quot;What is something  that barks?&quot;).  An MO (Motivating Operation) relates to a condition of deprivation and aversion (e.g., if a child is deprived of an item they will have higher MO of that item and are more likely to mand (i.e., request) for that item). A Discriminative Stimulus (SD) is more simply the instruction delivered.

Skinner's book Verbal Behaviour sparked much controversy most notably, Noam Chomsky's review of the book which he published in 1959 (Chomsky, 1959).   


'''B.F. Skinner-Why was he controversial?'''  

&lt;u&gt;A brief description of Walden II&lt;/u&gt;
Skinner began writing Walden Two in the summer of 1945 and wrote a preface to the novel in 1976, nearly 28 years after its original publication. Skinner explains that at the time of writing the novel, western civilization was in a relatively good place.  Hitler was dead, the Great Depression of the 30's was over and forgotten, communism was no longer considered a threat and Hiroshima hadn't yet occurred. He explains that he wrote  &quot;Walden II&quot; due to personal dissatisfactions with society, particularly involving women struggling with domesticity and the state of education.    This book was particularly controversial as it describes a fictional utopian society that can be considered scientifically efficient.  His goal in writing this book was to work out how his theories could be used in &quot;real&quot; life. 

Perhaps what is of most interest is the &quot;Walden II Code&quot;.  This was developed in the book as the rules that all members of the community must follow.  
The main components of the code are as follows: (1)engage in physically hard labour (2)avoid unnecessary possessions (3)no gratitude is to be expressed (4)individuals should not be compared (5)avoid gossip about personal ties (6)No exclusive time is to be spent with one's own children (7)One shouldn't talk to outsiders about community affairs (8)Personal competition should be discouraged (9) In Walden Two there are no heroes  nor is history relevant (10) Marriage plans are voided by tested-for psychological incompatibilities (11)Members are not to argue about the Walden Code with members-at-large; but, to see the managers(12)No one is to act for the benefit of anyone else except as an agent of the community (Rozycki, 1999).
Being part of this community is described as being hard work with little room for materialistic ideals.  But how is operant conditioning and behaviourism incorporated into this community? Individuals in this society earn work credits for the quality of work completed instead of the quantity.  Compensation is dependent on the demand or the need for a particular job to be completed.  This society also promotes short (four hour) work days with a concentration on being happy, and having an appreciation for arts and sciences.  In addition to this, positive reinforcement is used to reinforce adults for appropriate child rearing techniques, as well as for work productivity.
So why was this novel so controversial?  This can best be described in an article by Edward Rozycki(1999) Rozycki has 3 main arguments against this novel and its ideologies:
First it is argued that although Skinner vehemently considered himself an empiricist and ''not'' a theorist, &quot;most of his work is theory based on what he considered the world to be&quot;.  Rozycki argues that Skinner is not in fact a great scientist, as he chose not to run controls in his experiments to make them empirically valid.
Second, it is argued that Skinner is advocating a totalitarian or communist society.  It is evident that writing about a communist &quot;utopia&quot; in 1948 would be the cause of much uproar in America.
Finally, Rozycki argues that all members of the community are so happy because if they do not behave that way, they will be forced out of the community.
Other critics argue that nothing can be concluded from an experiment on a small scale community. Skinner claims that in order to make change, one must start with a &quot;pilot project&quot; before attempting to change an entire population.  Walden II can be considered that pilot project.
I think it's important to note here that Skinner wrote a piece of ''fiction'' and it probably did not warrant such outrage and controversy.  Then again, the ''Satanic Verses'' by Salmon Rushdie was also a piece of fiction.

&lt;u&gt;The Baby Tender&lt;/u&gt;
Skinner built a heated crib with a Plexiglass window where a baby could sleep without suffocating in blankets or getting caught in the bars of a crib. The device was meant to serve as a temperature and humidity controlled environment as an aid for child rearing by reducing laundry and diaper rash and teaching babies to be more confident, mobile, comfortable, and healthy and therefore less prone to cry. Skinner sent his invention to Ladies Home Journal who published an article entitled “Baby in a box” (Smith, 1999).  This led to major confusion by the public who believed that Skinner created a “baby box” similar to the Skinner box.  The confusion and criticism was unwarranted, as Skinner simply built the crib as a new and improved place for babies to sleep (Smith, 1999).  


'''Practical Applications of Skinner's theories- Contributions to and History of Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA)'''
The roots of behaviour analysis are in the theories of B.F. Skinner.  Applied Behaviour Analysis can be described as the science that studies environmental events that change behaviour (Miller, 1997). 
The defining characteristics of Applied Behavior Analysis are as follows:
1) It is '''Applied'''. This is determined by the social significance of the behavior under investigation.  That is, the behavior is important to either the subject, or society (Cooper ''et al.'', 1995)
2) It is '''Behavioral'''.  The behavior should be in need of improvement, and should be measurable.  The behavior should also be observable.
3) It is '''Analytic'''.  The experimenter shold be able to demonstrate a functional relationship between the manipulated events (the environment) and the behavior in question.  In other words, how does one affect the other and how can the experimenter control it.
4) It is ''''Technological'''.  All procedures used in studies should be precisely described so that anyone experienced in ABA could run the study without question.
5) It is '''Conceptually Systematic'''.  There are many procedures that can be used to alter behaviour but most are derived from a few basic principles of behavior.  Research and procedures in ABA should be described using these basic principles.
6)It is '''Effective'''. ABA must produce clinical or social significance in order to be deemed effective as opposed to traditional science whereby statistical significance proves a study to be effective
7)It has '''Generality'''.  The behavior change must last over time and appear in other environments in which it was not originally tested in.
(Cooper ''et al.'', 1995)

One of the first psychologists to use Skinner's theories for testing human behavior was Paul Fuller. In 1949, he conducted experiments with an 18 year old boy who was described at the time as a &quot;vegetative idiot&quot;.  He was bedridden and unable to roll over independently.  Fuller filled a syringe filled with warm milk and sugar and injected it into the boy's mouth every time he moved his right arm.  Within four sessions, the boy was moving his arm to a vertical position at a rate of 3 times per minute.  Skinner would call this the process of Positive Reinforcement, as described above.

Skinner's publications are extremely influential in both guiding the practice of behaviourism as a science, and also in extending the application of these principles to new areas. (Cooper, ''et al.'' 1995).  Although the theories of ABA are well known in the context of teaching children and adults with autism and other developmental disabilities, it is used in practice in a wide range of areas. Some of these areas are as follows:

Mental illnesses-Reduction of inappropriate behaviours such as non-compliance and aggression in institutional settings, as well as teaching work and social skills.

Rehabilitation- Helping people regain normal functioning that they may have lost through some sort of trauma.  ABA can help to promote compliance with physical therapy routines, to help with memory loss to help with chronic pain, and even to deal with addictions.

Community psychology- ABA can be used to design intervention programs for a large group of people or community.  For example, behaviour interventions have been used to help reduce littering, increase recycling, reduce energy consumption, reduce unsafe driving, increase use of seat belts, reduce speeding etc.

Clinical Psychology- Behaviour analysis is used to help clients deal with personal problems.  Cognitive Behaviour Therapy is an extension of Behaviour analysis.

Business/Human services- ABA can be used in organizational settings and a new branch of ABA has now developed entitled Organizational Behaviour Management.  The goal is to design interventions to improve work performance, decrease lateness, absenteeism, and accidents on the job.

Sports Psychology- ABA has been used to improve athletic performance during practice and in competition and also to help with coaching styles.

The list of areas that ABA has expanded to is endless.  The theories of behaviorism as developed by all four of the major founders of this field have made a distinctive and long lasting impression on the field as it is practised today.

'''Applied Behavior Analysis and Autism- Dr.Ivar Lovaas'''
Dr. Ivar Lovaas is currently a Professor Emeritus at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA).  Most famous for his studies in the 60's using behaviour analysis for the treatment of children with autism, he is now considered the father of ABA.
Lovaas published his most famous study entitled &quot;Behavioral Treatment and Normal Educational and Intellectual Functioning in Young Autistic Children&quot; in the Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology in 1987. The data collection for this study however, began in 1970. This particular study compared treatment for two groups of similar young children with autism. Participants were assigned to one of two groups: an &quot;intensive treatment&quot; experimental group that received 40 hours of one-to-one treatment per week, or the &quot;minimal treatment&quot; group that received 10 hours or less of one-to-one treatment per week.  Results showed that 47% of the experimental &quot;intensive&quot; group achieved normal intellectual and educational functioning, while only 2% of the minimal treatment group did so (Lovaas, 1987). Although this study had its limitations, it shows strong support for behaviour analysis and its effect on behavior change for young children with autism.  Skinner's original theories of positive and negative reinforcement were used treat these at-risk children.

===Cognitive Social Learning Theory===

====Albert Bandura (1925 - present)====

Born in the small town of Mundare, Alberta, Canada on December 4, 1925,Albert Bandura would grow to be one today’s most influential psychologists and learning theorists.  He attended a local elementary and high school and later received a Bachelors degree in psychology from the University of British Columbia (1949).  He pursued graduate studies at the University of Iowa, where he completed a Doctorate degree in 1952.  It was during his graduate work that he developed an interest in behaviourism and learning theory.

In 1965, Albert Bandura made a statement about the process of learning that was at that time considered to be radical and against all thinking on the matter: “children can learn by merely observing the behaviour of a social model, even without first performing the responses themselves or receiving any reinforcement for performing them” (Shaffer, 1999, p. 50).  

Clearly, his thoughts went against Skinner’s ideas that one must be reinforced for their responses in order for learning to occur. While Bandura agreed with Skinner that operant conditioning is an important type of learning (especially with animals), he believed that humans are ''cognitive'' beings who unlike animals are likely to think about the links between their behaviour and its consequences (Shaffer, 1999, p. 49). He believed that humans are more likely to be influenced by what they believe will happen than by actual experience.  Behaviour is not simply shaped by immediate consequences, but rather by considering the implications of it.

In seeing humans as ‘active information processors’, Bandura emphasized our tendency to ''learn from observation''.  He proposed that learning can also result from observing the behaviour of other people (models).  For example, a two-year old could learn how to ‘play’ with the family pet simply from watching her older sister do so.  Bandura suggested that we “must attend carefully to the model’s behaviour, actively digest it or encode what we observe, and then store this information in memory (as an image or verbal label) in order to imitate what we have observed at a later time” (p. 49).  

In an effort to test and support his theory, in 1965 Bandura conducted a now notable experiment on observational learning.  In this study, nursery-school aged children were presented with a short film in which an adult model directed aggression towards an inflatable Bobo Doll.  Three main conditions included: (a) the model-reward condition, in which the children saw a second adult give the aggressive model candy for a “championship performance”, (b) the model-punished condition, in which the children saw a second adult scold the model for their aggression, and (c) the no-consequence condition in which the children simply saw the model behave aggressively.  Results indicated that following the film viewing, children, when left alone in a room with the Bobo doll and props used by the adult aggressor, imitated quite readily the responses they had witnessed on screen.  Those in the model-reward and no-consequence conditions were more willing to imitate the aggressive acts than those in the model-punished condition.  However, further testing revealed that children in each condition had learning equally as much from each learning condition by just observing the adult models.  Thus, Bandura demonstrated that reinforcement is not necessary for observational learning, though it may impact performance.

In addition, Bandura also proposed the concept of ''reciprocal determinism'' to describe his idea that human development reflects an interaction among an active person, their behaviour and their environment.  Unlike Watson and Skinner who proposed that the environment exclusively influenced behaviour, Bandura (and others) suggested that the relationship between the person, their behaviour and the environment is bi-directional.  Thus, each factor can influence the other, suggesting that children are actively involved in moulding the environment that influences their own development and growth (Shaffer, 1999).

      <text xml:space="preserve">During the era of psychometrics and behaviourism, intelligence was thought to be a single, inherit entity. The human mind was believed by some to be a &quot;blank slate&quot; that could be educated and trained to learn anything if taught in the appropriate manner. However, contrary to this notion, an increasing number of researchers and psychologists now believe that the opposite is true; that is, individuals are born with and possess different levels of ability.  The development and use of intelligence tests have been one way that researchers and psychologists have attempted to support their argument.  Gardner (1993) expresses this view quite elegantly, stating that &quot;there exists a multitude of intelligences, quite independent of each other; that each intelligence has its own strengths and constraints; that the mind is far from unencumbered at birth; and that it is unexpectedly difficult to teach things that go against early 'naive' theories that challenge the natural lines of force within an intelligence and its matching domains.&quot;

===Howard Gardner===
Howard Gardner has earned his place in psychological history for revolutionizing education with his ''Theory of Multiple Intelligences'' (1983).


Howard Gardner was born in Scranton Pennsylvania in 1943, five years after his parents fled from Nürnberg, Germany. The family's loss of Howard's older brother resulted in his being raised in a protective environment that favoured the pursuit of intellectual interests over adventure (Winner, 2007).

As a young man, Gardner attended Harvard University with the intention of studying law. This notion changed, however, he met a number of influential individuals: psychoanalyst Eric Erikson, sociologist

David Riesman, and cognitive psychologist Jerome Bruner. Gardner was consequentially inspired to pursue interests in psychology and social sciences (Winner, 2007).

Gardner graduated summa cum laude from Harvard University in 1965, and entered Harvard University's Doctoral programme in 1966.
In 1967, he began working on Project Zero—a research team on arts education. This pursuit became a forum for Gardner to explore his interest in human cognition; it also became a passionate commitment that would span over twenty years (Winner, 2007). 

By 1971, Gardner earned his PhD from Harvard, completing his dissertation on style and sensitivity in children. He then lectured at Harvard until 1986, when he began teaching at the Harvard Graduate School of Education (Winner, 2007).

To date, Howard Gardner has received honorary degrees from twenty-one different colleges and universities. Internationally, these include institutions in Ireland, Italy, Israel, and Chile. He continues to co-direct Project Zero with David Perkins.

Some of Gardner's accomplishments include the following:

*First American to receive the University of Louisville's Grawemeyer Award in Education in 1990
*Received a Fellowship from the Hohn S. Guggenheim Memorial Foundation in 2002 
* Named an Honorary Professor at East China Normal University in Shanghai in 2004
*Selected by Foreign Policy and Prospect magazines as one of the 100 most influential intellectuals in the world in 2005


Gardner's first major book, ''The Shattered Mind'', was published in 1975. He would write and publish at least fifteen more major books. Some of these works include: ''Frames of Mind: The Theory of Multiple Intelligence'' (1983), ''To Open Minds: Chinese Clues to the Dilemma of Contemporary Education'' (1989), ''The Unschooled Mind: How Children Think and How Schools Should Teach'' (1991), ''Frames of Mind: The Theory of Multiple Intelligence'' (1993)—this second edition celebrated the ten year anniversary of the original work, ''Intelligence Reframed: Multiple Intelligences for the 21st Century'' (1999), and ''The Disciplined Mind: Beyond Facts and Standardized Tests: The K-12 Education that Every Child Deserves'' (1999).


Howard Gardner viewed intelligence as &quot;the capacity to solve problems or to fashion products that are valued in one or more cultural settings&quot; (Gardner &amp; Hatch, 1989). He is most known for his work on the ''Theory of Multiple Intelligences''.


====Theory of Multiple Intelligences====

Howard Gardner's (1983) original theory of Multiple Intelligences comprised seven types of intelligences: 

*'''Linguistic Intelligence''' 

:Linguistic intelligence is the ability to learn languages and to use one's skill in using language effectively to accomplish specific goals. Individuals high in linguistic intelligence are often writers, poets, and lawyers.

*'''Logical-Mathematical Intelligence''' 

:Logical-mathematical intelligence is the ability to analyze problems logically. It includes skill at completing mathematical operations and solving mathematical problems as well as the ability to investigate hypotheses scientifically. Those high in logical-mathematical intelligence tend to be logical thinkers with high deductive reasoning skills. 

*'''Spatial Intelligence''' 

:Spatial intelligence refers to an individual's ability to represent the spatial world in his or her own mind. It includes skill at recognizing and using patterns. Architects, urban planners, geographers, cartographers, pilots, and sailors tend to be high in spatial intelligence abilities.

*'''Musical Intelligence''' 

:Musical intelligence includes abilities in composing and performing music and in recognizing and composing musical pitches, tones, and rhythms. It also includes skills in recognizing and appreciating musical patterns. Individuals high in musical intelligence may have talents in vocal and/or instrumental abilities. 

*'''Bodily-Kinesthetic Intelligence''' 

:Bodily-kinesthetic intelligence refers to an individual's ability to use mental abilities to coordinate bodily movements. According to Gardner, mental and physical abilities are related. Athletes, dancers, actors, and performers often display high levels of bodily-kinesthetic intelligence.

*'''Interpersonal Intelligence''' 

:Interpersonal intelligence is concerned with an individual's ability understand the intentions, motivations, and desires of other people. Such skills are beneficial in working and getting along with others. Those high in interpersonal intelligence are often educators, salespeople, religious and political leaders, counsellors and social workers.

*'''Intrapersonal Intelligence''' 

:Intrapersonal intelligence refers to the capacity to understand oneself--one's thoughts, feelings, fears, desires, and motivations. It includes the ability to use this knowledge toward successful outcomes. Writers and artists often demonstrate intrapersonal intelligence in their work.

Howard Gardner's Theory of Multiple Intelligences has received strong positive responses from educators, who readily adapted his work to applied settings in the classroom.

Since Gardner's original listing of the seven intelligences, other possible candidates or forms of intelligence have been discussed and considered for inclusion. These forms of intelligence include:  

*'''Naturalist Intelligence'''

:Naturalist intelligence refers to an individual's ability to recognize, categorize, and draw upon certain features of the environment.

*'''Spiritual Intelligence''' 

:Spiritual intelligence explores the nature of existence.

*'''Existential Intelligence''' 

:Existential intelligence refers to the concern with the &quot;ultimate issues.&quot;

*'''Moral Intelligence'''

:Moral Intelligence refers to the concern with rules, behaviours, and attitudes that govern the sanctity of human life as well as lives of other living creatures and the world they live in.

===Robert Sternberg===

Robert J. Sternberg may be considered one of the most prominent psychologists of this century. In addition to his theoretical contributions, Sternberg is the author of over 1100 published works. His major contributions to psychology have been his work on intelligence, creativity, and wisdom.


Robert J. Sternberg was born on December 8, 1949. From an early age, he was interested in intelligence, and at the age of 13 he designed and wrote his first intelligence test. Sternberg graduated in psychology from Yale University in 1972, and then went on to earn his Ph.D. from Stanford University in 1975. He also holds five honorary doctorates. Sternberg’s work in studying various types of intelligence led to development of his ''Triarchic Theory of Human Intelligence'' (1985). In 2004, he was IBM Professor of Psychology and Education, Professor of Management in the School of Management, and Director of the Center for the Psychology of Abilities, Competencies, and Expertise at Yale University. This centre has been relocated to Tufts University (2007). Sternberg was  President-Elect of the Eastern Psychological Association from 2005-2006 (Tufts, 2007).

Robert J. Sternberg is currently Dean of Arts and Sciences at Tufts University. His commitments and accomplishments in the fields of psychology and education are many: 

*The American Psychological Foundation Board of Directors
*The Editorial Board of Intelligence 
*The American Academy of Arts and Sciences
*The American Association for the Advancement of Science
*The American Psychological Association—in 15 divisions
*The American Psychological Society
*The Connecticut Psychological Association
*The Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters
*The International Association for Empirical Aesthetics
*The Laureate Chapter of Kappa Delta Pi
*The Society of Experimental Psychologists
*Former president of the APA Divisions of General Psychology, Educational Psychology, Psychology and the Arts, and Theoretical and Philosophical Psychology of the APA
*Past Editor of the Psychological Bulletin and The APA Review of Books: Contemporary Psychology. 
* Winner of awards from APA, AERA, APS, to name a few (Tufts, 2007)

Some of Sternberg’s published works on intelligence include: ''Successful Intelligence'' (1998), ''Teaching for Successful Intelligence'' (1998), ''Handbook of Creativity'' (1999), ''Practical Intelligence in Everyday life'' (2000), and ''Why Schools Should Teach for Wisdom: The Balance Theory of Wisdom in Educational Settings'' (2001).

Sternberg (1985) holds that conventional measures of intelligence, such as SATs and IQ tests, fail to identify the high abilities many individuals possess. He recognizes that some intelligence abilities not measured by traditional means may be beneficial to one’s academic, professional, and personal success. From this perspective, traditional educational methods can be problematic for their tendency to favour students with strong memory and analytical skills  (Sternberg, 1985). Oftentimes, students with strong creative and practical skills are disadvantaged due to teaching methods that do not allow them to demonstrate their strengths and skills (Sternberg, 1985). Sternberg also criticizes traditional methods for a tendency to favour students of higher socio-economic backgrounds. His research led to the development of the ''Triarchic Theory of Human Intelligence'' and the theory of ''Successful Intelligence''.

====Triarchic Theory of Human Intelligence====
Sternberg's (1985) Triarchic Theory of Human Intelligence includes three facets:

*'''Analytical Intelligence''' (componential) 
:Analytical Intelligence is a measure of one's ability to solve academic problems, such as analogies and puzzles. It is seen as a reflection of how the individual relates to one's internal world.

*'''Creative Intelligence''' (experiential) 
:Creative Intelligence reflects an individual's ability to connect their internal world to their external reality. It includes one's ability to use prior knowledge in new or innovative ways in different circumstances, such as finding a new approach to a problem. In this way, creative intelligence encompasses creative thinking.

*'''Practical Intelligence''' (contextual) 
:Practical Intelligence involves one's ability to understand and effectively deal with everyday tasks. It is reflective of how the individual relates to the external world.

Most individuals will score higher in one of the three areas of intelligence.

====Theory of Successful Intelligence====

Sternberg (1999) holds that individuals who excel in all areas of the triarchic intelligence test may be considered to have successful intelligence, which he defines as the ability to achieve success in accordance with one's personal standards and within one's socio-cultural context. Individuals with high levels of successful intelligence tend to be better equipped for success and able to adapt well to their socio-cultural context. 

Sternberg’s (1999) construct of successful intelligence may be applied to educational settings with the aim of increasing student learning while bridging gaps among socio-economic and ethnically diverse groups. In addition, the theory of successful intelligence offers researchers, psychologists, and educators an opportunity to redefine intelligence, and educational opportunity.

=== Charles E. Spearman===

Charles Spearman was one of the earliest psychologists to propose a factor analytic approach to intelligence testing.  His theory stated that there was one ''general factor (g)'' and one or more'' specific factors (s)'' that accounted for individuals' performance on intelligence tests.  Spearman conceptualized the g factor as ''general mental energy''.  This factor is involved in deductive reasoning and is linked to the &quot;skill, speed, intensity, and extent of intellectual output.&quot; (Sattler, 2001, 138).  Spearman believed that general mental ability represented the 'inventive' aspect to mental ability rather than the 'reproductive' aspect.  The cognitive abilities associated with general mental ability might include being able to describe how two concepts are related or being able to find a second idea that is related to one that has already been proposed.  Tests with high g loading are complex and include tasks that involve reasoning and hypothesis testing (Sattler, 2001).  Tests with low g loadings are less complex and include tasks that involve recognition, recall, and speed (Sattler, 2001).

===Emotional Intelligence===

The construct of emotional intelligence, or (EQ), is becoming an increasingly valued area of psychological research due to the adaptive properties it holds for both the individual and society. Experts vary somewhat in their definition of emotional intelligence and the standards for its empirical assessment, but most agree that individuals having high EQ scores possess character traits that foster strong interpersonal skills, excellent coping strategies, and decision-making abilities that lead to positive outcomes. Theories and applications of emotional intelligence aim to improve quality of life of the individual by helping her/him to achieve goals, form satisfying relationships, find meaningful work, and attain personal and professional success. An understanding of emotional intelligence is therefore not only conducive to intellectual growth, it holds a significant role in individual happiness.


The study of intelligence has a rich history in cognition, and it was long held that the arousal state of emotion caused disorganization of cognitive activity (Massey, 2002). Charles Darwin challenged this notion when he wrote ''The Expression of Emotions in Man and Animals'' in 1872. Darwin's work recognized the emotional system as important to survival across species. According to Darwin's theory, emotions served as an important signaling system that served as being highly adaptive (Darwin, 1872).

About a century later, Howard Gardner challenged the traditional notion of IQ in his day by introducing the world to new intelligences, proposing that individuals have many intelligences in a variety of abilities. His famous book titled ''Frames of Mind: The Theory of Multiple Intelligences'' (Gardner, 1983) outlined seven new intelligences with highly adaptive properties. Two aspects of his theory, interpersonal and intrapersonal intelligences, correspond to some aspects of EQ abilities. They are defined as ability in using one’s intelligence in gaining empathy toward others and in understanding the self and using this knowledge effectively (Gardner, 1983). Although Gardner is against the concept of emotional intelligence, his work has precipitated research in the areas of interpersonal relations and self-understanding-components of EQ. 

At the same time in history, Sternberg (1985) developed his ''Triarchic Theory of Human Intelligence'', proving individuals don’t have to be “book smart” to be highly intelligent. Two components of his theory—creative intelligence and practical intelligence—comprise skills beyond those measured in traditional IQ assessments, with qualities mirrored in EQ abilities (Sternberg, 1985). Some research points to the value of understanding emotions evoked in art, and the healing power of creativity (Glennon, 2000); other works hold practical aspects of goal attainment to be in new approaches to intelligence, including areas of EQ. 

In 1987, Nancy Cantor and John Kihlstrom published their work on ''Social Intelligence'' (Cantor &amp; Kihlstrom, 1987). Their work would lead many researchers to consider the role of effective social interactions in intelligence, inspiring future work on EQ abilities.

It was not until 1990 that the term &quot;emotional intelligence&quot; was first used, when John D. Mayer and Peter Salovey formulated their original hierarchical model of EQ. They defined emotional intelligence as &quot;the ability to monitor one's own and other's feelings and emotions, to discriminate among them and to use this information to guide one's thinking and actions&quot; (Mayer &amp; Salovey, 1990)

Borrowing from Mayer and Salovey's theory, Daniel Goleman wrote ''Emotional Intelligence''in 1995. In his book, Goleman (1995) defines emotional intelligence as: knowing one’s emotions, managing one’s emotions, motivating oneself, recognizing emotions in others, and handling relationships. His theory, derived from work on brain research proves that emotional stability, or EQ, is more important than IQ in determining one’s success. The book became a best seller. The topic of EQ received widespread attention by being on the cover of ''Time'' and ''Forbes'' magazines; Goleman’s book is also discussed on the television shows ''Oprah'' and ''20/20''. 

Expanding on their earlier work, Mayer and Salovey formulated a revised model of emotional intelligence (1997), which gave more emphasis to cognitive components of EQ, and conceptualized EQ as it related to intellectual and emotional growth. This processing model contained four branches:

::*'''Perceiving Emotions'''
:::The ability to perceive emotions in oneself and others as well as in objects, art, stories, music, and other stimuli.
::*'''Facilitating Thought'''
:::The ability to generate, use, and feel emotion as necessary to communicate feelings or employ them in other cognitive processes.
::*'''Understanding Emotions'''
:::The ability to understand emotional information, to understand how emotions combine and progress through relationship transitions, and to appreciate such emotional meanings.
::*'''Managing Emotions'''
:::The ability to be open to feelings, and to modulate them in oneself and others so as to promote personal understanding and growth.

Work in the field was gaining increased popularity, and competing theories were surfacing. Additional work on EQ led to ''Development of the BarOn EQ-i: a measure of emotional intelligence'' (Bar-On, 1997). This research produced a test of the emotional intelligence quotient. The same year, the book ''Executive EQ: emotional intelligence in leadership and organizations'' was published in New York (Cooper, &amp; Sawaf, 1997). The corporate world began to recognize the importance of emotional intelligence, its role in the knowledge economy, and its impact for success. Following this, Wessinger’s (1998) book ''Emotional Intelligence at Work'' explored the applications of emotional intelligence in employment settings, giving more reason for corporations and individuals to learn more about the concept in applied settings.

As the end of the decade neared, additional research studies on the construct continued to be published. The 33-Item Emotional Intelligence Scale was published (Schutte et al.,1998). This work defined emotional intelligence according to the following abilities: non-verbal communication and mood/affect, optimism and pessimism, attention to feelings, clarity of feelings, mood repair, and depressed mood an impassivity. Responses on this scale aim to provide psychologists with valid insights into individual levels of competence in awareness and regulation of emotion, outlook on life, mood/affect, and inpulsiveness. While all this research was going on, controversey and debate over whether emotional intelligence qualifies as an intelligence was high. In response, John D. Mayer, David R. Caruso, and Peter Salovey (1999) published research to support emotional intelligence meets traditional standards for an intelligence. Their work led to the development of the Multifactor Emotional Intelligence Scale, or MEIS (1999). The MEIS was an ability test and was devised to overcome challenges associated with earlier self-report tests (Mayer, Caruso, &amp; Salovey, 1999). 

Recognizing a lack of adequate testing measures for assessing EQ scores in children, Amie Kistler Sullivan developed ''The Emotional Intelligence Scale for Children'', or EISC, (1999). Based on the MEIS, the EISC was devised using child-development research. Giving consideration to children’s verbal and cognitive skills, as well as ther developmental experience, this work produced five subscales, which include: faces, music, stories, understanding, and managing emotions. An empathy scale has also been added. The measurement of emotional intelligence now had an application in educational settings. Sullivan’s empirical studies prove that a child’s emotional intelligence abilities impact on learning and future life outcomes. She states that individuals with greater levels of emotional intelligence come to make decisions that impact on their lives positively; the opposite is also true (Sullivan, 1999). For example, children having high scores on the EISC achieve academic success, whereas children having low scores are at risk of dropping out of school (Sullivan, 1999). This work was beneficial in allowing educators to consider ways of helping children achieve high EQ abilities--traces of this notion are found in the teaching of character education. Teachers were learning how to help children become happy and successful in later life.

The turn of the new millennium brought about research on emotional intelligence in applied settings. Michelle M. Englund and collaborators (2000) proved that low measures of emotional intelligence and social competence are found to correlate to feelings of negativity, hostility, aggression and/or frustration toward others. In group settings, individuals with low EQ scores fail to participate in group tasks and do not contribute to discussions; they display little consideration toward others and their opinions, and are uninterested in group activities (Englund et al., 2000). With this knowledge, the business world began to recognize the value of hiring emotionally intelligent individuals for their skills in social competence. Highly emotionally intelligent individuals are desirable job candidates for their traits in: ability to function well within a group, to work cooperatively toward group goals, and to strive toward attaining positive outcomes of problems-solving tasks (Englund et al., 2000). Emotionally intelligent individuals are respected and wield influence in group dynamics. These individuals are able to guide discussions, promote participation by others, and often make final decisions that others adhere to. They are confident and possess a belief in their abilities and expect success for their effort (Englund et al., 2000).

Individuals having high EQ scores have also proven to be better equipped to conquer life challenges. In an applied setting, Sheldon and Houser-Marko (2001) demonstrated that individuals having high EQ scores are better able to cope with the challenges and changes associated with entering college or university—increasingly difficult curricula and increased peer interactions. Students with high EQ abilities successfully meet such challenges with higher grade point averages and the ability to better meet year-long goal attainment during the incoming year (Sheldon, &amp; Houser-Marko, 2001).

Psychological research at this time also explored the role of emotional intelligence in individual success and happiness. Nicola S. Schutte, John M. Malouff, Chad Bobik, Tracie D. Coston, Cyndy Greeson, Christina Jedlicka, Emily Rhodes, and Greta Wendorf (2001) explored the role of ''Emotional Intelligence and Interpersonal Relations''. They found that emotionally intelligent individuals possess abilities that lead to success in social situations that correspond to overall improved quality of life (Schutte et al., 2001). For example, emotionally intelligent individuals had higher scores for empathetic perspective taking and self-monitoring of emotions and behaviours in a variety of environmental contexts (Schutte et al., 2001). They  proved better at effectively managing inappropriate behaviours, such as hostility and aggression; they also respond assertively to anger-provoking situations, respecting both their own rights as well as those of others. Individuals with high EQs possessed increased social skills, are more cooperative toward partners, have more affectionate relationships, and enjoy greater satisfaction in personal relationships (Schutte et al., 2001). In summary, emotionally intelligent individuals get along well with a variety of people and are very well liked; they also receive more positive treatment from others and report having more satisfying relationships (Schutte et al., 2001).

Growing popularity of the construct of emotional intelligence has not been without criticism. A critique of empirical research on emotional intelligence points to the problem of self-report findings. Research that resulted in the development of the various EQ scales may represent or be vulnerable to subject bias. It is possible that subjects responded to self-report studies by portraying themselves in a more positive manner, and/or by providing answers they wished the investigators/researchers to read/observe. Applied studies may also be vulnerable to subject-bias effects.

In response to such criticsm, the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test, or MSCEIT, (Mayer et al., 2002) aimed to measure performance abilities associated with EQ. The MSCEIT was developed from earlier intelligence-testing research by Mayer and Salovey, such as the Multifactor Emotional Intelligence Scale, or MEIS (Mayer, Caruso, &amp; Salovey, 1999). This new test was designed to measure the four branches of the MEIS by determining how well people perform tasks having emotional content (Mayer et al., 2002). Scores on the MSCEIT reflect ability measures are relatively unaffected by self-concept, response set, emotional state, and/or other confounds (Mayer et al., 2002). That is, responses to MSCEIT represent actual abilities at solving emotional problems. 

At present, the construct continues to be researched, debated, and discussed around the world. ''The First International Congress on Emotional Intelligence'' will take place September 2007 in Málaga, Spain. More than 200 well-known researchers will contribute to analyzing important theoretical, empirical, and applied aspects of emotional intelligence related to health, education, and business. Another world-wide forum for EQ is ''The International Conference on Emotional Intelligence'' (ICEI), which invites expert speakers from prominent organizations to discuss the integration of emotional intelligence in the workplace. Industry leaders from Deloitte, American Express, and UBS—to name a few, will be in attendance at the conference in London, England in June 2007. In addition, South Africa will host the ''Emotional Intelligence World Summit'' in September 2007. The Conference will highlight effectiveness of leadership using emotional intelligence in education, business, and health.

In summary, results of research in this field have led to a greater understanding of what emotional intelligence is, how it can be identified, and why it matters. Despite the varying descriptions of emotionally intelligent personalities and abilities, experts agree that individuals having high EQ scores display combinations of some or all of the following: emotional stability, strong interpersonal and social skills, self-awareness, self-management, and positive mood/affect. As a result, they are better equipped for success and tend to live happier and more fulfilled lives.

Given the adaptive properties of emotional intelligence and its impact on one’s success in life, it is important to note that experts are in concordance to the developmental nature of EQ scores (Mayer, Caruso, &amp; Salovey, 1999; Schutte et al., 1998; &amp; Sullivan, 1999). That is, most individuals can look forward to increasing levels of emotional intelligence abilities with age and experience. For example, challenging periods of adjustment during childhood—attachment during infancy, preschool in early childhood, summer camp in middle childhood, and the formation of intimate relationships in adolescence—illustrate the changing coping styles and qualitative differences in EQ abilities at each stage of development (Englund et al., 2000). Because adolescents function within a larger network of relationships, they are required to employ new skills in various situations, thus expanding their perceptual and cognitive emotional abilities (Englund et al., 2000). Similarly, as one enters adulthood and finds employment and faces the responsibilities of marriage and family life, new and more complex EQ skills become necessary (Sheldon, &amp; Houser-Marko, 2001; &amp; Schutte et al., 2001). It is important for individuals to understand their strengths and weaknesses in areas of emotional intelligence and to find ways to aid in improving these skills. Due to the developmental nature of emotional intelligence, experts are optimistic that appropriate intervention strategies will yield increases in EQ performance measures. Such increases are believed to improve one’s quality of life and probability for success (Sheldon, &amp; Houser-Marko, 2001). Research on EQ has found a correlation among emotional intelligence and measures of empathy, artistic ability, time spent in psychotherapy, preference for leisure activities, and life satisfaction. It has been suggested that emotional intelligence may improve through appropriate leisure activities, such as reading self-help books and being exposed to an emotionally and creatively enriched environment (Mayer, Caruso, &amp; Salovey, 1999. Listening to classical music, attending concerts, and having an appreciation for the arts permits a greater understanding of emotional self-awareness and creative and emotional expression (Mayer, Caruso, &amp; Salovey, 1999). Time spent in psychotherapy is believed to correspond positively with increases in emotional and cognitive growth—both of which attribute to greater self-knowledge and self-understanding (Mayer, Caruso, &amp; Salovey, 1999). For youth at risk, life skills training could be implemented to aid adolescents in setting appropriate academic and life goals, empowering them to successfully deal with future challenges. This may be especially important as low EQ scores have been linked to youth violence and teen pregnancy (Englund et al., 2000).

===Dynamic Assessment===

Dynamic Assessment is characterized by an approach first forwarded by Feurstein (1979). Feurstein spoke of the Learning Potential Assessment Device. Feuerstein's background was in Israel, working with children displaced by the Holocaust. Feurstein found that on traditional intelligence tests, these children often scored in the very delayed range, but he saw the progress they made with support and the &quot;spark&quot; for learning they had. He thus spoke of the &quot;potential&quot; of children and focused on this ability to change rather than any score. His approach is based on a series of learning tasks with children. Once a child's strategies are uncovered with support (we would characterize this now as &quot;testing of the limits&quot;) he would use this knowledge to help children see how to apply these strategies in other situations, specifically within academic tasks.

More generally, dynamic assessment refers to a process where teaching and assessment occur in tandem. Terms such as &quot;testing of limits&quot; are used to indicate that after a standardized administration of a test, the child's limits are tested by seeing what they can do with a change in instruction, support, stimuli, etc. Other approaches include test, teach, retest. This refers to administering a test, then teaching the child the skill, then retesting them to measure the improvement. Dynamic assessment attempts to evaluate a child's response to instruction. In this way, it is considered less biased than traditional assessment models which can be biased by educational history or culture.

===Cross-Battery Assessment (Cattell-Horn-Carroll) Model===

Early work by Raymond Cattell and John Horn reflects a factor analytic approach to intelligence.  The '''Cattell-Horn Fluid-Crystallized Intelligence Theory''' distinguished between two types of intelligence, that is fluid intelligence and crystallized intelligence.  

'''Fluid intelligence''' refers to the ability to understand and reason with nonverbal (culturally free) information.  Examples of tasks that tap into fluid intelligence might include figure classifications and matricies).  Fluid intelligence is thought to gradually increase during childhood and it peaks in adolescence.  After peaking, fluid intelligence is thought to gradually decrease over the rest of an individual's life due to the degeneration of physiological brain structures.

'''Crystallized intelligence''' refers to the acquired skills and knowledge that an individual possess.  Contrary to fluid intelligence, crystallized intelligence is not culture-free, but rather it is dependent on being exposed to culture.  This type of intelligence invovles &quot;overlearned and well established cognitive functions and is related to mental products and achievements.&quot; (Sattler, 2001, 140). Examples of tasks that tap into crystallized intelligence might include vocabulary and general information.  Crystallized intelligence is strongly influenced by formal and informal education and as a result, is thought to increase at least until middle adulthood.

After this original two-factor conceptualization of intelligence, Cattell, Horn, and Carroll proposed that there were more than two specific types of abilities that underly learning.  If fact, they propsed nine different &quot;broad&quot; classifications of intelligence and they developed the '''Cattell-Horn-Carroll Theory of Cognitive Abilities'''.  The nine different classifications of intelligence include (from Sattler, 2001, p. 141):

*'''Fluid Intelligence (Gf):''' Refers to reasoning, seriation, sorting, and classifying abilities
*'''Crystallized Intelligence (Gc):''' Refers to achievement and knowledge that results from acculturation
*'''Visual Processing (Gv):''' Refers to the ability to accurately perceive/interpret spatial information and visually and mentally manipulate figures
*'''Auditory Processing (Ga):''' Refers to the ability to listen and respond appropriately to auditory information
*'''Short-Term Memory (Gsm):''' Refers to immediate awareness, alertness, and retrieval of recently learned information
*'''Long-Term Storage and Retrieval (Glr):''' Refers to the ability to retrieve information from long-term storage
*'''Processing Speed (Gs):''' Refers to the ability to quickly and efficiently respond to simple tasks
*'''Decision Speed (Gt):''' Refers to the ability to provide speeded responses to tasks of slight or moderate difficulty
*'''Quantitative Knowledge (Gq):''' Refers to the ability to understand and apply mathematical concepts

A large number of other abilities (70) are subsumed under these categories (narrow classifications). An example of a narrow classification would be Foreign Language Aptitude which falls under the broad classification of Crystallized Intelligence (Gc). A third stratum also exists in the model and this level subsumes all other levels of ability.  &quot;g&quot; or a general cognitive ability is representative of higher-order cognitive abilities. 

The Cross Battery Assessment model takes as its starting point the idea of multiple intelligences within multiple areas. It is empirically based and theory driven.  It seeks to provide a more thorough understanding of a child's ability than would be possible using any single test and is based on the Cattell-Horn-Carroll Theory of Cognitive Abilities.  Cross-battery assessment, as the name implies, involves utilizing ''more than one'' psychological test or battery to evaluate the abilities that underly learning in children.  This has resulted in the development of  several cognitive and achievement tests that use the CHC model of intelligence explicitly in their structure.  The Woodcock-Johnson Tests of Cognitive Abilities (WJ-III COG), the Woodcock-Johnson Tests of Achievement, Third Edition (WJ-III ACH), and the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children, Second Edition (KABC-II) all include tasks which tap into these multiple areas of ability.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Psychotherapy===
This section does not purport to cover all types of therapies of the last 100 years. It does, however, sketch a general picture of  nine significant schools of thought. In doing so, the authors admit to their biases, whether personal affection for a particular type of therapy, or experience in one form over another. The common elements between the nine schools of therapy presented below include their unrelenting force in the way psychology is practiced today. The reader should also make note of the fact that only three approaches outlined in this section originated in Europe (Freud's Psychoanalysis, Existential Therapy, and Gestalt Therapy), as opposed to the other approaches which originated in the United States. Therefore, while reading this section, ask yourself the following questions: 

*How did Freud's experience as a Jewish minority in Vienna impact Psychoanalysis? 
*How did Frankl's experience as a Jewish minority impact Existential Therapy and how does this contrast with Psychoanalysis?
*In what way do the American approaches differ from European approaches, and how did these differences express themselves as all nine approaches evolved into what we practice today?
*How do current cultural trends influence the ways in which these therapies are practiced today? 

====Psychodynamic Therapy====

Freud was born in 1856 in the town of Freiberg in Moravia, which is present day Czechoslovakia, and his family relocated to Vienna in Austria, where he lived and worked most of his life (Rychlak, 1981).  He earned a medical degree from the University of Vienna and established a medical practice in Vienna as a neurologist, which is a specialist in the nervous system (Rychlak, 1981).  Freud was highly creative and productive during his lifetime and his collected works fill 24 volumes (Corey, 2005).  A remarkable fact that was revealed from his correspondence with his friend Wilhelm Fliess is that virtually all of Freud’s theoretical ideas had been sketched during the period of 1887 through just after the turn of the twentieth century, while the most creative period of his life was shortly following his father’s death in 1896 (Rychlak, 1981).  This period marked a defining moment in Freud’s life as it was during this time in his life that he developed the theory of Oedipus complex.

The death of Freud’s father seems to have increased his numerous psychosomatic disorders, his exaggerated fear of dying and other phobias that troubled Freud throughout his life (Rychlak, 1981).  During that emotionally difficult period Freud began a self-analysis, using a general approach that he had worked out for the study and treatment of neuroses (Rychlak, 1981).  This was a turning point for Freud in that from this self-analysis one can trace the beginning of the psychotherapy procedure now called psychoanalysis.  In the process of his self-analysis, in which Freud was exploring the meaning of his own dreams and examined his childhood memories, he came to realize that during his childhood he had experienced sexual feelings for his mother, who was attractive, loving, and protective, as well as intense hostility for his father (Corey, 2005).  From this experience of analyzing himself as well as from observation of his patients as they worked through their own problems in psychoanalysis, he clinically formulated his theory of Oedipus complex (Corey, 2005).

According to the theory of Oedipus complex, the mother becomes the first ‘love-object’ of the child’s sexual instinct (Freud, 1920).  According to Freud (1920), the erotic nature of this attachment to the mother is established when the little boy wants to sleep with his mother at night, insists on being in the room with her while she is dressing, or even attempts physical acts of seduction.  Freud (1920) writes:

:It is easy to see that the little man wants his mother all to himself, finds his father in the way, and shows his dissatisfaction when the latter takes upon himself to caress her, and shows his satisfaction when the father goes away or is absent.  He often expresses his feelings directly in words and promises his mother to marry her (p. 90).

During puberty, an individual must free oneself from the parents in that a son must release his libidinal desires from his mother and reconcile himself with his father or free himself from the father’s domination (Freud, 1920).  Freud (1920) emphasized, however, that this task is seldom accomplished in a satisfactory manner.  It should be noted that although Freud also developed a theory of the female Oedipus complex, it was argued that Freud was definitely uncertain in his theory of female sexuality, which makes psychoanalysis more of a masculine than a feminine theory of personality (Rychlak, 1981).  This once again emphasizes the fact that it was his self-analysis that heavily influenced the development of his theories.

Taking into account that Freud is considered the father of modern personality theory (Rychlak, 1981) one needs to appreciate the importance of the Oedipus complex as essential for Freud’s theory of personality.  Freud (1920) believed that in ‘neurotics’ the detachment from the parents, which must take place during puberty, is not accomplished at all.  In other words, the son remains dominated by his father and is incapable of transferring his libido from his mother to a new sexual object, which leads to a neurosis (Freud, 1920).  In this way, the Oedipus complex was argued by Freud (1920) to be “the kernel of the neuroses” (p. 91).

From this, one can see that Freud’s self-analysis of his childhood experiences was a defining moment in life work.  Freud himself was aware of the extent to which his self-analysis had affected his formulation of the theory of Oedipus complex, as can be seen from his correspondence with his friend, Wilhelm Fliess.  In one of his letters to Fliess, which he wrote on October 15, 1897, Freud states:

:My self-analysis is in fact the most essential thing I have at present and promises to become of the greatest value to me if it reaches its end…. Being totally honest with oneself is a good exercise.  A single idea of general value dawned on me. I have found, in my own case too [the phenomenon of] being in love with my mother and jealous of my father, and I now consider it a universal event in early childhood, even if not so early as in children who have been made hysterical. (Freud, quoted by Masson, 1984, p. 272).

From that excerpt it appears that despite the fact that Freud saw the connection between his self-analysis and the theory he had developed, he nevertheless considered his discoveries about himself to be universal, believing that all young boys go through the experience of being in love with their mothers and jealous of their fathers, absence of resolution of which leads to neuroses later in their lives.

In this way one can see how Freud’s life circumstances, in particular, his father’s death and his subsequent self-analysis of his dreams and his childhood memories, led to the development of the theory of Oedipus complex, which is at the heart of Freud’s formulation of ‘neurosis’.  The period of his life, when in the midst of his emotional and psychosomatic difficulties following his father’s death he found the strength to engage in self-analysis, led to the development of his famous theory of personality, which is a precursor of the modern personality theory.

====Client Centred Therapy====

'''Introduction'''

During the 1950's and 1960's, humanistic psychology was born.  Human nature had been previously conceptualized by Freud, drawing attention to the dark forces of the unconscious, and Skinner, examining the effects of reinforcement on  observable behavior.  Humanistic psychology was born out of attempts to understand the conscious mind, motivation, human dignity, self-reflection and the capacity for growth. Humanistic psychology became known as &quot;the third force&quot; as an alternative to psychoanalysis and behaviorism.

The humanistic movement was led by Carl Rogers and Abraham Maslow.  Maslow theorized that all people are motivated to fulfil a hierarchy of needs.  Maslow theorized that once their basic needs are met, including hunger, thirst, sleep, safety, security, love and esteem, that humans strive for ''self actualization'', the ultimate state of personal fulfillment. Maslow explains, &quot;I think of the self-actualizing man not as an ordinary man with something added, but rather as the ordinary man with nothing taken away&quot; (Hoffman, 174). Rogers argued that all humans are born with a drive to achieve this &quot;self actualization&quot; or full capacity and that the role of therapists is to facilitate this growth.

Client-centered therapies belong within the field of humanistic psychology. Carl Rogers is known as the father of client-centered therapy. Partly in response to the psychoanalytic and behavioral schools that emphasized interpretations or manipulations, Rogers developed a non-directive therapy focused on creating a reflective space for individuals to actualize their potential. He later changed the name of this therapy to &quot;person-centred therapy&quot;. 

In a paper written by Carl Rogers (1979), he reviews briefly the central hypothesis of his person-centred therapy. He suggests that each of us has within us the resources to achieve self-understanding, as well as to alter our self-concept, our basic attitudes, and our self-directed behaviour. Rogers (1979) proposes that these resources can be tapped only within a very specific type of environment which is characterized by what he refers to as &quot;facilitative conditions&quot;.

According to Rogers (1979), there are three conditions that facilitate this growth: 1) Genuineness/Realness/Congruence; 2) Acceptance/Caring/Unconditional Positive Regard, and 3) Empathic Understanding. 

Congruence refers to the therapist being transparent to the client, and not putting up a professional front. It would involve the therapist demonstrating congruence with what they are experiencing at the gut level, what is present in their awareness, and what they are expressing to the client. According to Rogers (1979), the more the therapist demonstrates congruence within the therapeutic environment, the more the client will be likely to change and grow in a positive manner.

Unconditional Positive Regard is the second facilitative condition and involves the therapist being with the client and accepting the client throughout therapy regardless of where they are at, and what feelings they are experiencing. Rogers (1979) believes that the more the client is prized in an unconditional manner, the more the client will be likely to grow and improve.

The final facilitative condition that Rogers (1979) proposed is empathy. Empathy within therapy has been one of the most researched facilitative conditions. Empathy refers to the idea that the therapist is able to capture sensitively and accurately the meaning and personal feelings that the client is experiencing. Additionally, empathy also implies that the therapist is able to successfully relay these feelings and the meaning they hold back to the client. At the very deepest level of empathic understanding, the therapist will not only be able to clarify the meaning of things in which the client is aware, but will also be able to clarify those things that are just below the client's awareness. Rogers (1979) believed that more empathic understanding was associated with greater improvements and growth within the therapy.

'''Development of Client Centered Therapies'''

'''Four Waves of Rogers' Therapy'''

Rogers' therapy/theory has undergone many changes over time. Of importance are four main periods in time that were marked by major changes. These changes are mentioned in Corey (2005) briefly, and more fully elaborated and discussed by Zimring and Raskin (1992) and Bozarth, Zimring and Tausch (2002).

During the 1940s, Rogers developed what was known as '''non-directive counselling'''. This was in response to the traditional directive psychoanalytic approaches of the time. Below is a list of the significant contributions put forth by Rogers in the first wave of his theory:
*emphasized that the therapist create a permissive and nondirective climate.
*challenged the concept that the &quot;counsellor knows best&quot;.
*challenged traditional procedures used by many therapists like advice, suggestion, direction, persuasion, teaching, and interpretation.
*challenged the use of diagnostic procedures as he believed that they were often inaccurate, prejudicial, and misused.
*avoided sharing information about himself, and instead focused on reflecting and clarifying the clients' verbal/nonverbal communications.
*aimed to gain insight into the feelings expressed by the client.

During the 1950s, Rogers renamed his approach to counselling '''client-centered therapy'''. There are two features to note in this change. First, of course is the concept of &quot;client-centred&quot;. Second, and equally important, is the change from using the term &quot;counselling&quot; to using the term &quot;therapy&quot;. This changes marks a shift from an advice-giving model where a person is &quot;counselled&quot; to take some action to a more open-ended model where the client is not counselled to do or feel anything, but rather to explore whatever they feel is of value. At this time, a very important book was published by Rogers called &quot;Client-centered Therapy&quot; (Rogers, 1951), which began to reflect an emphasis on the client, rather than a therapist's use of directive methods. Also of significance during this period was:
*a shift from clarification of feelings to examining instead more heavily the phenomenological world of the client.
*a strong focus on the client's internal frame of reference in order to gain an understanding of how people behave.
*a strong focus on the actualizing tendency, as the basic motivating force that leads to client change.

Beginning somewhat in the late 1950s, but extending all the way into the 1970s, Rogers began to address what have become known as the '''necessary and sufficient conditions of therapy'''. During this time, among other books, Rogers published his nationally recognized book &quot;On Becoming a Person&quot; (1961). Of significance during this time period was:
*his hypothesis that the facilitative conditions were related to psychotherapy improvements. This prediction triggered decades of research in psychology and related fields.
*a strong focus on becoming one's experience was introduced, which involves an openness to experience, a trust in that experience, an internal locus of evaluation, and a willingness to be in process.
*the initial expansion of Rogers' ideas to education occurred and was called student-centered teaching.

The final phase, during the 1980s and 1990s, was marked by great expansion of Rogers' ideas to many facets of life. For this reason, Rogers changed the name of his approach to '''person-centered therapy'''. This time in history was of significance because it involved:
*an expansion to education, industry, conflict resolution, administrations.
*an influence on family, health care, and cross-cultural and racial activity.
*an involvement in politics, especially the search for world peace, which led to Rogers being nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.

To this day, many researchers continue to be influenced by the seminal work conducted by Carl Rogers. To conclude, a list is provided below of current day researchers who have at the root of their work the ideas of Rogers (see Corey, 2005, pp. 183-184).
*Virginia Axline made use of Rogers' ideas to start working with children using a model of non-directive Play Therapy.
*Eugene Gendlin developed a technique known as focusing, in order to facilitate client experiencing within therapy.
*Laura Rice initiated a technique known as systematic evocative unfolding as a way of recreating and potentially gaining a better understanding of a particular troubling experience.
*Leslie Greenberg from York University, and his colleagues, have encouraged therapists to facilitate emotional change within therapy, and have also applied his emotion focused therapy to couples and families.
*Jeanne Watson from OISE/UT has demonstrated the importance of empathy within therapy, and has encouraged making use of empathy to tap cognitive, affective, and interpersonal issues within therapy.

Carl Rogers' most famous and influential book was ''On Becoming a Person''

Within this book, Carl Rogers highlights some significant learnings that he had accumulated over the thousands of hours he has spent with individuals in personal distress. These particular learnings are highlighted in a chapter entitled &quot;This is Me&quot;. Rogers (1961) reports that these learnings has significance for him (at that point in his life/career), but admits that he is in no way attempting to present these learnings as a guide for anyone else. A brief description of each learning is helpful other to gain a deeper understanding of Carl Rogers, the researcher, the clinician, and the man. Each has been directly quoted from his book &quot;On Becoming a Person&quot; (Rogers, 1961).

*In my relationships with persons I have found that it does not help, in the long run, to act as though I were something that I am not.
*I find I am more effective when I can listen acceptantly to myself, and can be myself.
*I have found it of enormous value when I can permit myself to understand another person.
*I have found it enriching to open channels whereby others can communicate their feelings, their private perceptual worlds, to me.
*I have found it highly rewarding when I can accept another person.
*The more I am open to the realities in me and in the other person, the less do I find myself wishing to rush into &quot;fix things&quot;.
*I can trust my experience.
*Evaluation for others is not a guide for me.
*Experience is, for me, the highest authority.
*I enjoy the discovering of order in experience.
*The facts are friendly.
*What is most personal is most general.
*It has been my experience that persons have a basically positive direction.
*Life, at its best, is a flowing, changing, process by which nothing is fixed.

Rogers describes these learnings as incomplete, scattered, and continuously changing. He also reports that he continues to learn and relearn them, and at times forgets to apply them. However, he mentions they are all of great importance to him and have become a large part of his inner values and ways of behaving.

Another significant, but often overlooked, contribution of Rogers was his advancement of research into psychotherapy. He was one of the first people to systematically study therapy. He pioneered the use of audiotapes in therapy, feeling that one of the best ways to improve therapeutic technique was to record and listen to sessions in detail. One of his most famous statements on this front was &quot;The facts are friendly&quot; (Rogers, 1961, p. 25).

====Cognitive and Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy====

'''Principles'''

Cognitive Therapy, as developed by Beck, is a psychotherapy quite distinct from other forms such as psychoanalytic or behavioral psychotherapy because it is based on an information-processing model of human behavior and psychopathology rather than a motivational or instinctual model.  However, it should be noted that numerous cognitive/cognitive-behavioral therapies (CT/CBT) have emerged since the groundbreaking work of Aaron Beck and contemporaries such as Albert Ellis, and these differ in terms of their underlying assumptions concerning the nature of reality, knowledge (what we know and are aware we know), and causal mechanisms (see, for example, Mahoney, 1988).  Common features of the cognitive/cognitive-behavioral therapies include (i) a collaborative relationship between therapist and patient, (ii) an emphasis on disturbances in cognitive processes as the key factor in psychological distress, (iii) a belief that one’s own cognitive activity can be accessed, monitored and reported, (iv) beliefs that cognition affects behavior and that behavior and affect can be therapeutically changed through efforts to change cognitions, and, finally, (v) a time-limited, problem focused, psycho-educationally based format that is adapted according to the specifics of distinct disorders (Dobson &amp; Block, 1988).  

'''Technical Features'''

The process of Beck’s Cognitive Therapy (which he formulated in the early 1960s – see Beck, 1963, 1964, 1967) can be viewed in hierarchical terms (Blackburn, 1992), with the initial focus in therapy sessions placed on the observable behaviors and symptoms that brought the client to treatment (historically the purview of the behavioral approach).  This leads in later sessions to an examination of the client’s automatic thoughts (conscious or pre-conscious, but quite distinct from the psychoanalyst’s concept of the subconscious), elucidation of the cognitive processes underlying these automatic thoughts, and finally therapeutic work on the core belief systems and schemata that the client holds (with these latter three conceptual levels broadly consistent with the experimental and theoretical cognitive psychology movement that was gaining momentum at the time Beck was developing his ideas).  

The aim of CT is to change the client’s habitual ways of processing types of information, to reduce the client’s general bias towards particular interpretations and attributions (whether associated with depressive, phobic, or otherwise dysfunctional thoughts) and to encourage re-evaluation of the client’s basic beliefs (or ‘schemata’) regarding the self, the future, and the world.  This is achieved during sessions through in-depth discussion (and a Socratic questioning style) of the client’s experiences relating to the presenting problem and the client’s subjective interpretations of these experiences.  Therapeutic gains are also sought between sessions with mutually agreed upon homework assignments involving a wide range of foci and activities, from keeping ‘thought’ and ‘feeling’ diaries to conducting in vivo experiments that test the client’s problem-related beliefs.  It is only really in his recent adaptation of the therapy model for personality disorders (Beck, Freeman, Davis, &amp; Associates, 2004), with its explicit focus on childhood experiences as the ultimate source of maladaptive schemata that Cognitive Therapy reaches beyond the client’s recent and present experiences.  In this adaptation for personality disorders, developmental experiences are identified as important grist for the therapeutic mill and, in this respect, it shares a broader temporal focus with that more commonly associated with psychoanalytic therapy.      

The focus on cognitive mechanisms to effect behavioral change is a key difference between the cognitive-behavioral and behavioral approaches to therapy, with the latter based instead on a stimulus-response (nonmediational) model.  Indeed, cognitive mediation could be considered the defining feature of cognitive-behavioral theories of psychopathology and therapy.  However, revealing their common basis in behavior therapy, many CBT models rely on behavioral therapeutic techniques and behavioral assessment procedures to determine clients’ progress.  They also maintain the emphasis found in behavior therapy on outcome data, seeking to (i) remedy specific predefined problems with which the client presents and (ii) empirically document the therapeutic efforts.  Such features are rather less characteristic of the psychoanalytic school of therapy.  It is this shared focus between behavior and cognitive-behavioral therapies that greatly facilitated the growth of the treatment evaluation literature and allowed direct contrasts between these approaches and their relative efficacy for different clinical problems.  Beck’s Cognitive Therapy model is consistent with these features.  Beck deliberately sought to demonstrate an empirical basis from the outset which, over forty years, has resulted in a considerable body of experimental and clinical research testing the cognitive mediational model of psychopathology (Beck, 1992, 2005; Leahy &amp; Dowd, 2002) and the efficacy of CT/CBT (Butler, Chapman, Forman, &amp; Beck, 2006).

The psychoeducational element also clearly distinguishes CBT from many of the other schools of psychotherapy (such as psychoanalysis, with its provision of interpretation to the client by the therapist [Blanck, 1976; Brown &amp; Pedder, 1996], or strategic and systemic family therapies, with their use of paradoxical methods [Minuchin &amp; Fishman, 1981; Watzlawick, Weakland, &amp; Fisch, 1974).  Beck’s Cognitive Therapy model typifies this ‘educating process’; the client receives clear explanations early on in therapy of the model and underlying rationale as well as the therapeutic techniques and processes involved.  In the 1960s this marked an important shift in psychotherapy away from an expert role for the therapist (whether based on the revealing insights of the psychoanalyst or the procedural direction given by the behavioral therapist).  However, it did not amount to an embrace of the equality between therapist and client inherent in the Rogerian client-(later person-) centered approach (Rogers, 1979), which did away with the expert therapist on the basis of a quite different rationale.  At least implicit in the educational emphasis within CT/CBT is the aim that clients will come to understand their problem and the means through which therapy works so that they can apply this knowledge and the skills acquired during treatment in a preventative fashion later on or in the event that they experience a recurrence of their problem (e.g., Beck et al., 1979).  Indeed, outcome data suggests that relapse is less common in clients assigned to Cognitive Therapy compared with those assigned to antidepressant medication (Gloaguen, Cottraux, Cucherat, &amp; Blackburn, 1998).      

'''Historical Context'''

Emerging from the behavioral approach to psychotherapy, cognitive-behavioral adaptations can be seen to have occurred through the confluence of a variety of historical factors, a number of which are worth noting here.  The first was the recognition arising in the 1950s and 1960s that a nonmediational model could not account for all human behavior (see, for example, Rotter’s [1954] concepts of internal and external foci of attributions, Kelly’s [1955] psychology of personal constructs, Bandura’s [1969, 1971] work on vicarious learning, and Mischel’s [Mischel, Ebbesen, &amp; Zeiss, 1972] on delayed gratification).  The second influence of particular note was the theoretical and empirical advances being made in the 1960s and 1970s on mediational models in laboratory-based cognitive psychology (Neisser, 1967; Paivio, 1971), which invited clinical adaptations (see, for example, the work of Lazarus and his colleagues [1966, Lazarus &amp; Alfert, 1964]).  The third influence that helped usher in the ‘cognitive evolution’ in psychotherapy (Blackburn, 1992) was the negative conclusions being drawn from a growing number of scientific investigations of psychoanalytic theory and therapy efficacy (see Eysenck, 1969, 1985; Kline, 1981; Luborsky, Singer, &amp; Luborsky, 1975; and Rachman &amp; Wilson, 1971).  This lack of empirical support caused some practitioners to turn away and develop viable alternatives, with Ellis and Beck exemplary among these.
  
Indeed, the final major historical influence on the emergence of cognitive-behavioral approaches to psychotherapy to be discussed here was the work of Beck (1963, 1964, 1967) and Ellis (1962, 1970).  It is of historical note that although the CT/CBT movement in psychotherapy is widely known to have developed from traditional behavior therapy (Dobson &amp; Block, 1988), it must not be overlooked that Beck and Ellis came from backgrounds in psychoanalysis.  Their rejection of psychoanalysis was all the more significant because it was the prevailing paradigm at that time in mental health care among North American and European psychiatrists (although the resurgence of biological models and pharmacological treatment was quite separately assailing the dominance of psychoanalysis in psychiatry in the same period, see Shorter, 1997).  It is of additional historical interest that Beck and Ellis weren’t the first notables from within psychoanalysis to break with psychoanalytic thinking and introduce prescient cognitive ideas.  Alfred Adler before them had already set a precedent (see, for example, Freud’s [1914] account of Adler’s perceived apostasy), and had explicitly implicated personal representations of external reality as integral to psychopathology (Adler, 1931), portending a central tenant of Beck’s theory.

Certainly, parallels can be drawn between psychoanalysis and the psychotherapeutic approach represented by Ellis and Beck; in explaining behavior, both implicate memory, attention, and decision-making (indeed, Freud’s own early work has been viewed as an attempt to forge a cognitive neuropsychology [Pribram &amp; Gill, 1976]).  But the clinical and empirical frustrations with psychoanalysis that Beck and Ellis experienced compelled their radical departure from the motivationally based psychoanalysis of their training.  

Although both Ellis and Beck were aware of the literature documenting the practice of behavior therapy (traditionally the purlieus of psychologists), their grounding in psychoanalysis would have made it very difficult for them to simply embrace behaviorism’s exclusive focus on observable behavior or to view mental activity as being beyond the reach of science.  Being former psychoanalysts their interest in mental activity remained paramount.  Ellis and Beck’s background in psychoanalysis would actually have provided something of an intellectual protection against metaphysical behaviorism (Mahoney, 1974).  As it was, neither individual’s thinking was encumbered by the theoretical foundations of behavior therapy.  Unlike cognitively inclined behaviorists (such as Goldfried &amp; Merbaum, 1973, and Rachlin, 1974) who felt impelled to redefine behavior therapy in order to accommodate the growing body of data supporting cognitive mediation theories, Beck and Ellis owed no loyalty (and had no acquired bias) toward the principles of behavior modification.  Instead, the influence of philosophers such as Epictetus (the Greek Stoic) and Spinoza (the 17th century Dutch rationalist and ethicist) can be found in Ellis’ ideas.  Indeed, Epictetus’ frequently quoted statement, that “We are disturbed not be events, but by the views which we take of them”, effectively captures the fundamental premise from which CT/CBT models were to grow.   

Somewhat in contrast, Beck drew more explicitly on the psychological literature (including the work of Piaget, Kelly, and, later, Bandura) and selectively adopted those elements of behavior therapy that he found helpful (particularly the emphasis on experimental methodologies to investigate theory and practice) as he developed his own model.  And so with a psychoanalytic training in common that they rejected, both Beck and Ellis charted new courses as eventual grandfathers of CT/CBT by complimentary rather than commensurate intellectual pathways.

In closing this brief overview it is worth noting that, quite apart from the personal legacies that Ellis and Beck are to leave behind, the CT/CBT movement that owes a considerable debt to their pioneering efforts remains tremendously influential in the psychotherapy field.  In a recent US national survey of current practice and orientation among mental health practitioners, the majority of respondents endorsed CBT (or CBT used in conjunction with other methods) as their main approach (Psychotherapy Networker, 2007).  Mindfulness (which has actually been used to revise more traditional CT models with promising results – see for example, Kenny &amp; Williams, 2007, and Teesdale, Segal, &amp; Williams, 1995) and psychoanalytic/psychodynamic psychotherapies were among the other models that were reportedly also widely practiced.  Furthermore, in recent survey concerning trends in the field anticipated by psychotherapy experts, more psychotherapists were expected to endorse a CBT orientation, rather than any other psychotherapy model, over the next decade as their main approach (Norcross, Hedges, &amp; Prochaska, 2002).  According to the same survey, behavior therapy was also expected to increase in its number of adherents but the number practicing psychoanalytic psychotherapy was predicted to drop.  Given their own eschewal of psychoanalysis, it seems likely that Beck and Ellis would welcome such developments.  That a significant historical influence on the emergence of CT/CBT as a school of thought and an applied practice came from within the psychoanalytic fold in the persons of the iconoclastic Ellis and Beck would make such developments almost poignant.        

'''Key Figure'''

Aaron Beck was born July 18, 1921 in Providence, Rhode Island, United States, to Russian Jewish immigrants.  Beck’s birth, as the youngest of five children, was into a family marked by tragedy; a brother had already died in infancy as had a sister during the influenza pandemic in 1919.  One consequence of these events was that Beck’s mother was severely depressed for periods of Beck’s childhood, providing him with his first exposure to a principal focus of his future career.  Beck viewed himself as a replacement child, effectively easing his mother’s sense of loss.  It seems fitting that Beck’s arrival apparently served as at least a partial cure for his mother’s depression, setting him on his life’s work at a very early age. 

A childhood accident in which Beck’s arm was broken and became infected represents another important episode from which we can trace Beck’s later interest in and understanding of psychopathology.  Beck’s condition had been serious and his recovery in hospital was long and arduous; he developed a number of phobias and anxieties as a result and his extended absence from school led him to believe he was stupid and inept (beliefs compounded by a harsh grade one teacher who held him back).  But through self-help and hard work Beck eventually overtook his age-matched peers.  Weishaar (1993) quotes Beck as recalling of his ‘comeback’, “psychologically it did show some evidence that I could do things, that if I got into a hole I could dig myself out” (p. 10).  His school success over the next few years illustrated for the young Beck the power of disconfirming evidence in the face of negative thoughts and beliefs about oneself, a realization that became a corner stone of his later therapy model.  As well, Beck considered the anger of this teacher and his mother’s mood swings to have been instrumental in developing his pronounced sensitivity to changes in others’ moods, a skill that his students and colleagues observed many years later to be a key feature of Beck’s therapy work (although somewhat less evident in his therapy writings).   

It wasn’t until conversations many years later with David Barlow (the renowned behavior therapist and anxiety specialist) and his 1985 adaptation of his therapy model for anxiety disorders and phobias that Beck fully understood the phobias (of abandonment, of blood, and of surgery) he developed following his childhood accident and convalescence.  Indeed, he wrestled with these for years, attributing his entry into medicine as partly an attempt to defeat them, and using his internship experiences on rotations in surgery and internal medicine to disconfirm the beliefs that underscored these phobias.  Beck drew on his first-hand experience with phobias and anxiety, and also his bouts of mild depression (funding limitations and the loss of an office on campus marked a difficult period for him in the mid-1960s) as valuable experiences from which he gained insight as he wrote his books on the causes and treatment of there disorders (the first of which was published in 1967).  

Beck graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Brown University in 1942 and completed his M.D. at Yale in 1946.  Although initially interested in psychiatry, Beck could not embrace the Kraeplinian approach to psychiatry, which he found to be nihilistic.  Nor was he wholly comfortable with what he considered to be the soft and esoteric approach of the Psychoanalytic School of Psychotherapy.  His initial rejection of the latter reveals another key characteristic of Beck that set the stage for his venture toward an innovative theory of psychopathology and psychotherapy of his own.  Weishaar (1993) quotes him as recalling, “It [psychoanalysis] was nonsense.  I could not see that it really fitted.  I always had a kind of rebellious thing… [but] this was probably the first time I was aware of it” (p. 14).  His evidence-based training in internal medicine led him instead to pursue neurology with its precision and empiricism but a required rotation back in psychiatry meant his struggles with psychoanalytic thought and therapy were only really just beginning.  However, he remained in psychiatry after the required six months, slowly ‘seduced’ by the manner in which psychoanalysts had interpretations and explanations for everything and by the promise of psychoanalysis as a cure for most conditions.  Beck was even supervised by Erik Erickson, the renowned German psychoanalyst, during his two-year fellowship in psychiatry at the Austin Riggs Center in Massachusetts.  

Beck was board certified in psychiatry in 1953 and began teaching in psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania Medical School in 1954.  After finishing his analytic training at the Philadelphia Psychoanalytic Institute he took a post as an assistant professor of psychiatry at Penn in 1959.  At that point he set about researching the empirical basis of psychoanalytic theory, with the objective of convincing ‘hard-headed psychologists’, who Beck recognized as influential but rejecting of psychoanalysis, of its scientific validity.  Beck focused on the dreams of depressed patients because he believed that the psychoanalytic theories of depression were both well-developed and testable (and he had a readily available depressed population with which to work).  However, using procedures from experimental psychology (learnt from colleagues in psychology such as Seymour Feshbach), the collective evidence from these studies (which was quite the contrary to the retroflected hostility, need to suffer, and seeking of failure predicted by psychoanalytic theory), led Beck to view depressed patients instead as holding distorted views of themselves and reality.  His research results matched his experiences with patients in therapy.  Beck has pointed to the lack of empirical support as the reason for his moving away from the motivational basis and associated structures of psychoanalytic thinking.  But according to his collaborator, Ruth Greenberg, his personality, particularly the aforementioned rebelliousness, would have undermined his ability to remain within the psychoanalytic fold for very long (Weishaar, 1993).  Beck erred towards his own data rather than the psychoanalytic authorities of his day.  Beck also liked to be in control, Greenberg recalled, something that he would have lacked while undergoing analysis himself; it is likely no coincidence that his Cognitive Therapy explicitly involves the patient in a collaboration with the therapist and makes the patient their own authority.                           

As he developed Cognitive Therapy, Beck drew on the work of psychologists (such as George Kelly and Jean Piaget in his initial formulations), finding support in the advances made with the emergence of cognitive psychology in the 1970s (including the work of individuals such as Albert Bandura), and later corresponding with fellow cognitively oriented theorists and therapists including Albert Ellis and Donald Meichenbaum.  But what is interesting about his break with psychoanalytic thought and therapy is just how quickly and comprehensively he formulated his alternative model of psychopathology and therapy.  As he recollects, “Within a couple of years, I really laid the framework for everything that’s happened since then.  There’s nothing that I’ve been associated with since 1963 the seeds of which were not in the 1962 to 1964 articles” (Weishaar, 1993, p. 21). 
 
In coming up with Cognitive Therapy, Beck described the process as having involved, first, observing his patients and developing ways to measure his observations; second, advancing a theory to explain these observations; third, devising interventions to address them; and, fourth, designing research to confirm or disconfirm the whole enterprise.  The development and use of measures in psychotherapy (among which the most well known are the Beck Depression Inventory, Beck Anxiety Inventory, and Scale for Suicide Ideation) represents one area in which Beck’s pioneering efforts made a huge and influential contribution to the field more broadly.  A second area in which Beck’s contribution is clear is in evaluation research work.  From the beginning, Beck emphasized the importance of empirical evaluations of therapy, with the first study of his own Cognitive Therapy published in 1977 by Beck’s close collaborator, Shaw, and a recent review of 16 meta-analyses by Beck and his colleagues appearing in 2006.  A third area representing another of his major contributions is reflected in Beck’s publication in 1979 of what was, essentially, a therapist’s ‘how-to’ guide to the treatment of depression.  This book was based on the early training manual and its revisions that Beck had used as he recruited and trained his team of psychiatrists and psychologists in his clinical and research endeavors.  The manualization of treatment approaches has greatly facilitated the training of psychotherapists and, since Beck’s initial efforts, has become a mainstay of treatment program evaluation research today (Woody &amp; Sanderson, 1998), affording researchers a means to introduce and monitor treatment integrity and fidelity and so discern what differences truly exist between models and approaches under scrutiny.    

It should be noted, however, that Beck’s ideas and therapy weren’t the only developments that undermined the dominance of psychoanalytic thought in psychiatry.  Biological models of psychopathology and pharmacological treatments were (re-)emerging in the 1960s too.  Indeed, it is interesting to note that the two articles Beck published in 1963 and 1964 in the journal Archives of General Psychiatry (articles in which he first set out his theory of depression, his clinical observations and evidence in support of it, and its application to psychotherapy), appeared alongside numerous articles about the biological basis and assessment of depression (e.g., Gibbons, 1964; Kurland, 1964; Wechsler et al., 1963).  Of course, Beck wasn’t alone in his desire to better understanding and treating depression but he was quite distinct from others, in that he was putting forward his ideas about the role of cognition (combining the patient’s internal experience, specifically their accessible thoughts and feelings rather than the subconscious motivations emphasized by psychoanalytic thought, with an emphasis on empiricism borrowed from behavior therapy) at a time when North American psychiatry was quite distracted by a paradigm shift that was already under-way.  Unlike Beck, his fellow ‘radicals’ in psychiatry (and their articles book-ending Beck’s in the 1960s) were struggling to give nature a place back at the table, turning from phenomenology to biological models and pharmacological treatments.  It is of interest that these efforts eventually ushered in the renaissance of biological psychiatry in the 1970s (Shorter, 1997), with Beck’s work appearing conspicuously more at home in the context of the cognitive revolution in psychology, which also was taking place in that period.   

It seems fitting to end this selective consideration of Beck’s biography and contributions as we started, by looking back at Beck’s family.  Beck faced considerable resistance to his ideas throughout his career from the psychoanalytic and behavioral schools.  Despite this resistance, and his own history of various phobias and depression, Beck was evidently a strong and determined individual, able to work for many years in relative isolation (although his preference has clearly been for collaborative efforts (see, for example, some of his key publications).  It is in Beck’s parents that the source of these characteristics can be clearly seen.  Turning first to Beck’s mother, Lizzie Temkin, we can see the same determination and autonomy that her youngest son showed later.  The premature death of Beck’s grandmother meant Lizzie, as the oldest of nine, had to assume much of the responsibility of caring for the family, and she maintained her role as matriarch throughout her life.  Although three of her brothers graduated from universities, her own aspiration to be a physician went unfulfilled.  But her dominant and outspoken manner must have been an inspiration of sorts to Beck in later life as he persevered to develop and disseminate his research and psychotherapy.  

In Beck’s father too, Harry Beck, a printer by trade, we can see the foundations of some of Beck’s characteristics.  Harry was not nearly religious enough to endear himself to Lizzie’s father when their marriage was announced.  This was, in part, due to Harry’s active involvement in the socialist movement (having been an anti-Bolshevik in his native Russia).  Harry was also something of an intellectual in their Rhode Island community, serving as a regular host of meetings in which politics, philosophy, and literature were discussed, and later taking courses in literature and psychology at his son’s future alta mater, Brown University.  All his sons inherited their father’s intellectual curiosity; Beck is known to have wide and eclectic reading interests.  As well, it is interesting to note that just as his father regularly sought feedback on his poetry from his sons, Beck went on to regularly seek feedback on his ideas and manuscripts from his colleagues and students.  Most notably in the context of these comments is the fact that Harry was a free-thinker, not merely someone who unquestioningly went along with prevailing wisdom and practice, just as his youngest son proved to be years later as a pioneer in the psychotherapy field.          

Brief mention must also be made both of Beck’s prolific output (he has published over 500 articles and authored or co-authored 17 books, as reported on the website for the Beck Institute for Cognitive Therapy and Research), and also the plethora of major awards Beck has received over his lifetime (41 are noted on the Beck Institute website).  These serve as testament to the considerable importance of his work.  Of particular note are the awards he received from the American Psychological Association, in 1989, and from the American Psychiatric Association, in 2006, but also earlier and perhaps of greater historical interest, in 1979, at a time when the American Psychoanalytic School were strongly resisting the purging of its influence in the DSM (see Bayer &amp; Spitzer, 1985) and whose adherents would not have been welcoming of any recognition of Cognitive Therapy.  Indeed, Beck is the only individual to have been honored by both Associations.

====Existential Therapy====

Existential therapy is described as a philosophical approach (Corey, 2001), which differs from other therapies, such as cognitive behavioral therapy which consists of well-defined techniques. Ideas and themes are the basis of existential therapy, which stresses the basic conditions of human existence such as choice, the freedom and responsibility to shape one’s life, and self-determination. Of great importance is the quality of the therapeutic relationship. The role of the therapist is to “encourage clients to explore their options for creating a meaningful existence. We can begin by recognizing that we do not have to remain passive victims of our circumstances but instead can consciously become the architect of our life” (Corey, 2001, p. 143). 

The basic dimensions of human condition as viewed by existential therapy:
*'''The Capacity for Self-Awareness:''' As our self-awareness increases, the greater our possibilities for freedom. A therapeutic goal is to expand the client’s awareness by increasing his/her capacity to live fully. Either expanding or restricting consciousness is viewed as a choice. The decision to expand the consciousness is seen as necessary for human growth. 
*'''Freedom and Responsibility:''' Freedom to choose among alternatives in life shapes the client’s destiny. Therefore, the client is encouraged to accept responsibility for directing his/her life.
*'''Striving for Identity and Relationship to Others:''' Examining the ways in which the client has lost touch with their identity is important. This is accomplished by examining the courage to be, experiencing aloneness, experiencing relatedness, and a generally struggling with identity.
*'''The Search for Meaning:''' Looking for significance and purpose in life is paramount. Strategies for accomplishing this is examining the problem of discarding old values (i.e., those imposed by tradition), experiencing meaninglessness, and creating new meaning. 
*'''Anxiety as a Condition of Living:''' The experience of anxiety is viewed as necessary for growth and motivation to change. Anxiety is believed to arise from awareness. An aim of therapy is not to eliminate anxiety, but to encourage clients to take a stance, make a decision, or take action. 
*'''Awareness of Death and Nonbeing:''' Out of awareness of death, the client is encouraged to think significantly about life and evaluate how well they are living. 

Existential therapy was not created by any one person or group. Instead, in the 1940’s and 1950’s this philosophy arose out of different schools of psychology and psychiatry spontaneously throughout Europe. The focus was on understanding the unique experience of being human.

'''Key Figures'''


'''Viktor Frankl (1905-1997)'''
Viktor Frankl is most famous for his book ''Man’s Search for Meaning'', which he wrote in 1946. In German editions, his book is titled ''From Concentration Camp to Existentialism''. He contributed largely to the field of existential psychology by creating a school of psychotherapy in Vienna and his creation of Logotherapy.  He dedicated his professional life to the topic of meaning, receiving 28 honorary doctorates from universities across the world and publishing over 32 books in the course of his life time (Harvey, 1998). 

He was born March 26, 1905 in Vienna. Frankl describes announcing that he planned to be a physician when he was just 3 years old. At a very early age, Frankl became interested in psychology and psychiatry and prior to graduating high school had received a publication in the International Journal of Psychoanalysis as well as engaged in multiple correspondences with Sigmund Freud (Boeree, 1998).  He attended the University of Vienna, specializing in neurology and psychiatry with a specific emphasis on the areas of depression and suicide (Harvey, 1998).  During the year of 1924, Frankl was appointed President of the Sozialistische Mittelschuler Osterreich which spurred him to create a counseling program for students during times in the academic year when they were to receive their grades.  This counselling program was deemed very successful due to the fact that there were no Viennese student suicide occurrences during Frankl’s tenure.  In 1930 Frankl received his M.D. and in 1949 he received his Ph. D., both from the University of Vienna. He became an associate professor at the University of Vienna as well as a visiting professor at various universities in the United States including Harvard and Stanford. 

In 1938, when Germany took control of Austria, Frankl was banned from treating Aryan patients due to his Jewish ethnicity, forcing him to spend the next two years privately practicing neurology and psychiatry (Boeree, 1998).  Two years later, in 1940, Frankl became head of the neurological department of the Rothschild Hospital, which was the only hospital for Jews in Vienna during the Nazi regime.  It was here that Frankl spared the lives of many patients by making false diagnoses in order to avoid policies at the time that insisted upon the euthanizing of mentally ill individuals (Boeree, 1998).

From 1942 to 1945 Frankl was a prisoner in Nazi concentration camps at Auschwitz and Dachau. During these three years, he lost many of his family members and friends at the hands of the Nazis. Within his family, he experienced the loss of both of his parents, his brother, and his wife due to the atrocities of the concentration camps. 

Frankl had begun to develop theories and existential approaches to therapy before becoming a prisoner in the concentration camps. However, this experience solidified his views and became the basis for Logotherapy. “Frankl observed and personally experienced the truths expressed by existential philosophers and writers, including the view that love is the highest goal to which humans can aspire and that our salvation is through love” (Corey, 2001, p. 141). Frankl believed that we have choices in every situation, no matter how dire. Nothing can take a person’s spiritual freedom and independence. He stated that we always have the ability to choose our attitude and the experience that makes us human is the search for meaning and purpose. These ideas became the basis of Logotherapy.  


'''Rollo May (1909-1994)'''
Rollo May is touted as the “principal American spokesman of European existential thinking as it is applied to psychotherapy” (Corey, 2001, p. 142). Rollo May remembered his home life as being unhappy, which lead him to his interest in psychology and counselling (Corey). He studied with Alfred Adler in Vienna and while completing his doctorate degree, he became ill. He was diagnosed with tuberculosis and as a result spent two years in a sanatorium. During this two year period, he spent much of his time reading. He became interested in trying to understand anxiety since dealing with anxiety was an issue he was experiencing at this time. He published quite a few books during his lifetime. Two of his more popular books include ''The Meaning of Anxiety'' (1950) and ''Love and Will'' (1969).

Rollo May believed that psychotherapy should be centred on the goal of discovering meaning in clients’ lives. He suggested that this be accomplished by helping clients with problems of being rather than helping them to problem-solve. May described problems of being as including learning to cope with issues such as sex and intimacy, growing old, and facing death. He suggested that higher values (e.g., contributing to the betterment of society) should be paramount in therapy. He believed that if this focus of therapy was present in all psychotherapies, this would eliminate the need for therapy. 


'''Irving Yalom '''

See Group Therapy Below.

====Group Therapy====

'''Irving Yalom, 1951 - '''

'''Home:''' New York City

'''School:''' Interpersonal, with a psychoanalytical background - although he uses a &quot;Here and Now Focus.&quot; Yalom may claim himself to be an existentialist as his therapy deals with &quot;existential factors&quot;, but he does not take a phenomenonlogical approach to therapy.
He was educated at Stanford University, and was strongly influenced by psychodynamic and phonomenological thinking, as well as by other mental-health professionals, such as social workers. He has been extremely influential in the practice of group psychotherapies, and has published numerous books, including &quot;The Theory and Practice of Group Psychotherapy&quot; (1996) and existential Psychology&quot;. Yalom has also written a book on Nietzsche

'''Influences:''' Yalom was most notably influenced by Harry Stack Sullivan who believed that pathology derives from interpersonal perceptual problems. In dealing with these problems, Yalom, unlike Sullivan, sought to work them out in a group setting, with a &quot;Here and Now Focus&quot;. In this focus, the therapist facilitates interaction in the group, with issues taking place in the group. Members are discouraged from talking about their past issues or events occurring outside the group. When one member of the group expresses some interactional problem, they are asked to find someone within the present group who is similar to a person they would deal with in their regular lives. Conflicts and other issues are worked out, in vivo.

During this interaction, Yalom asks clients to observe themselves in the interaction. What he is attempting to create here is what he calls a Self Reflective Loop. While observing what they do &quot;here and now&quot;, what they are feeling, saying and doing, they may learn how they really act outside the group.

In Yalom's view, the group is a microcosm of other social groups, such as families, and even society itself. In order to reinforce the effects of the group, Yalom feels that therapy should become  the most important event in a client's life (i.e., temporarily, for the duration of therapy).

In Yalom's group therapies, newness and experimentation during  therapeutic interactions are emphasized. Members collect feedback as they try out new behaviors.

Yalom has outlined the processes underlying his group therapies, calling them the ''curative factors in group therapy''. These are outlined below. 

'''The Curative Factors in Groups Therapy '''

*'''Instillation of Hope:''' Establishing a sense among group members that change and resolution are possible. 
*'''Universality:''' The sense that group members experience similar pain and struggles. 
*'''Imparting of information:''' Group members share information about recovery, strategies, resources, and behaviours (i.e., what to do).
*'''Altruism:''' The very nature of the therapy, in which group members help each other (while getting help) is reciprocal. This reciprocity gives way to feelings of altruism - which in itself has the capacity to make one feel better. 
*'''The corrective recapitulation of the primary family group:''' The group environment mimics the primary family, and the group member can therefore experience what it is like to be in a more supportive environment (if his/her family experiences were negative). 
*'''Development of socializing techniques:''' Therapy is a place to be with others, to listen, and to talk to others. Therefore, Yalom views that very act ov socializing to be therapeutic. 
*'''Imitative behavior:''' Therapy is a place where you can try behaviors that others have found successful. This process relates to the process of altruism mentioned above, in that group members can experiment ''in vivo'' with the advice they learn from others. 
*'''Interpersonal learning:''' The process of learning how to adopt and take on other perspectives - other than one's own. 
*'''Group cohesiveness:''' Being a part of a group instils a sense of belonging, which a priori includes a sense of being important to each other.  
*'''Catharsis:''' Therapy should be a place to vent and explore feelings and get relief from them.

In Yalom's view, two processes work together to produce change:  Group Cohesiveness and Catharsis. Cohesiveness is what causes members to cathect to the group - i.e. it is what makes their feedback emotionally motivating - and thus a force of change. When a member cathects to the group, s/he is motivated to change behaviors that are unacceptable to the group. When the group matters to the individual, the individual becomes more like the group, and thus changes. Therefore, the group must become important to all the group's members if cohesiveness is to be established.

====Gestalt Therapy====

Gestalt therapy is an experiential therapy which focuses on awareness and integration. This therapeutic orientation was developed in the 1940's by Fritz Perls and his wife, Laura. The overall goal of the therapy is to integrate the functioning of the body and mind. This approach is described as both phenomenological and existential (Corey, 2001). The phenomenological aspect of the therapy is that is focuses on the client's perception of reality. Existential ideas are present in the belief that the client is always in process of &quot;becoming, remaking, and rediscovering themselves&quot; (Corey, 2001, p. 195). Gestalt therapy is widely known for its use of experiments designed by the therapist to increase their client's self-awareness.

Therapeutic Goals (Zinker, 1978):

*Move toward increased awareness of themselves
*Gradually assume ownership of their experience (as opposed to making others responsible for what they are thinking, feeling, and doing)
*Develop skills and acquire values that will allow them to satisfy their needs without violating the rights of others.
*Become more aware of all of their senses. 
*Learn to accept responsibility for what they do, including accepting the consequences of their actions.
*Move from outside support toward increasing internal support.
*Be able to ask for and get help from others and be able to give to others.

The therapist works with their client while focusing on the client's use of language. Aspects of language for the therapist to focus on include ''It talk'', ''You talk'', ''Questions'', ''Language that denies power'', ''Listening to client’s metaphors'', and ''Listening for language that uncovers a story''.

Techniques used in gestalt therapy:

*'''The Internal Dialogue Exercise:''' In order to integrate the client’s personality, the therapist works with splits in personality function (i.e. “top dog” and “underdog”). Conflicts between the two opposing poles in the personality can be resolved by using the empty-chair technique. The goal of internal dialogue exercises is to learn to accept polarities by exploring conflicts that exist within the client.
*'''Making the Rounds:''' This technique takes part in a group setting. Each individual is required to talk to each person by confronting, risking, disclosing, experimenting with new behaviour, which ultimately results in growth and change. 
*'''The Reversal Technique:''' This technique is used to access that part of the client that has previously been denied. They are asked to act in a way that is the opposite of how they normally present themselves (e.g. act in the role of an exhibitionist for those who are excessively timid). 
*'''The Rehearsal Exercise:''' This involves speaking to the therapist about “rehearsals” in terms of how the client wishes to behave. The goal of this technique is to help the client gain awareness regarding how they try to meet other's expectations, gain approval, and gain approval. 
*'''The Exaggeration Exercise:''' In order to become more aware of subtle cues clients are sending through body language, the client is asked to exaggerate the body language repeatedly. This results in clarifying the inner meaning of the gesture thus intensifying the feelings underlying the behaviour.
*'''Staying with the Feeling:''' During key moments when clients speak about an unpleasant feeling, they are asked to stay with that feeling. They are encouraged to explore the feeling deeper, thus gaining tolerance of dealing with unpleasant feelings and making way for growth.
*'''Dream Work:''' Dreams are not analyzed and interpreted. Instead, they are relived as if they were occurring in the present moment. The belief is that the dream is a projection and by working through this projection, the client will understand themselves better.

'''Key Figures'''

'''Fritz Perls (1893-1970)''' Fritz Perls is known as the main originator of Gestalt therapy. He was born in Berlin and graduated with an MD with a specialization in psychiatry. He was a medic for the German Army in 1916 for World War I. He began psychoanalytic training in Vienna following the war. Of note, he was supervised by Karen Horney during this time. In 1946 he emigrated to the United States and broke away from the psychoanalytic tradition. He established the New York Institute for Gestalt Therapy in 1952.

'''Laura Perls (1905-1990)''' Laura Perls was born in Pforzheim, Germany. She was a concert pianist and attended law school in addition to completing a graduate degree in Gestalt psychology. She met Fritz in 1926 and they began to collaborate together creating Gestalt therapy.

====Mindfulness Based Therapy====

In the last thirty years, mindfulness-based interventions have gained tremendous popularity in the fields of behavioral medicine and clinical psychology (Kabat-Zinn, 2003). The impressive body of research literature examining the efficacy of interventions focusing specifically on the development of mindfulness practices and skills continues to grow (Baer, 2003; Grossman, Niemann, Schmidt, &amp; Walach, 2004). This section on the history of mindfulness-based therapies first tracks the roots of mindfulness through various cultures and histories. Then, a brief review of the research literature examining it's application in clinical practice and recent development is offered. 

'''Acknowledging multiple roots'''

Mindfulness is presented within psychology and behavioral medicine as a secular practice with Buddhist roots (Kabat-Zinn, 2003). What are thought to be the earliest surviving records of the teachings of the Buddha are contained in the Pali Cannon (Tipitaka). These were first passed down orally until around 100BCE, when they were committed to text (Robinson, Johnson, &amp; Bhikkhu, 2005). By 250 BCE, the text was organised in three sets of teachings: The Vinyana consists of the precepts and directions for living for the monks and nuns; the Suttas consists of the discourses given by the Buddha; and the Abhidhamma consists of seven volumes about the working of the mind and consciousness. Many traditions of Buddhism emerged as a result of differing interpretations of the Buddha’s teachings. The two most commonly known schools are the Theravada or The Way of the Elders and Mahayana or The Greater Vehicle. The first teaching of the Buddha consists in the Four Noble Truths, which focus on human experience and the liberation from suffering through awakening. 1) There is dukkha (suffering), 2) The cause of dukkha is craving, 3) To cease suffering, one relinquishes that craving, 4) The path towards cessation of suffering is the Noble Eighfold path of right view, right resolve, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness and right concentration. It is said that the Buddha based the following 45 years of teaching upon this foundation. There are many forms of meditation practices in Buddhism. Mindfulness meditation refers to the cultivation of moment-to-moment awareness. Cultivating mindfulness allows for a recognition of the transitory nature of all experience (e.g., thoughts, emotions, sensations) and for the development of a different relationship to these experiences (e.g., instead of tensing up in response to painful sensations leading to exacerbation of pain, allowing oneself to explore these sensations). 

The roots of mindfulness practice are not limited to Buddhism. It is interesting to note that there are descriptions of spiritual practices that seem very similar to mindfulness practice throughout other cultures and religions. For instance, Australian Indigenous Elder Miriam-Rose Ungunmerr-Baumann (2002) speaks of Dadirri in the following ways: What I want to talk about is a special quality of my people. I believe it is the most important. It is our most unique gift. It is perhaps the greatest gift we can give to our fellow Australians. In our language this quality is called Dadirri. Dadirri is an inner, deep listening and quiet, still awareness. Dadirri recognises the deep spring that is inside us. We call on it and it calls to us. This is the gift that Australia is thirsting for. It is something like what you call ‘contemplation’. A big part of Dadirri is listening (cited in Atkinson, 2002).

'''Timeline - From the East to the West'''

'''Eastern Philosophical and Religious Beginning'''
*'''6th Century BCE:''' the Indian sage Kapila founded the Vedic philosophy Samkhya. This philosophy taught that we have a true self (purusha) and a false-self; the true self is free from suffering, desire, thoughts, ideas etc. and the false-self lives in this unhappy state. The purpose of these teachings was for students to delve within to realise and become aware of the root of their suffering (i.e. the ego which keeps us trapped within the false self) and to then become one with the true self(purusha).(Armstrong,2007)
*'''End of the 5th Century BCE:''' Siddharta Gotama began his inner journey and discovers the middle path. The teachings of mindfulness (sati) begin to emerge, and in fact is thought by the Buddha as a precursor of meditation. He taught that introspective exercises allowed one to see the ebb and flow of their thoughts, desires, sensations etc., and thus see their impermanence and transitory nature. (Armstrong, 2007)
*'''472 BCE:''' Aeschylus wrote the play ''The Persians'', which forced Athenian audiences in Dionysia to see the battle at Salamis from the Persian point of view, showing them not as the enemy but also as people in mourning. This reflected Aeschylus’s conscious attempt to bring about empathy, in other words stepping outside oneself to see things from a different perspective, which is also the essence of mindfulness.
*'''420-399 BCE:''' Socrates was using his dialectic of rigorous dialogue to get individuals to look inward and see their mistakes. In this way they would achieve ekstasis, which is stepping outside of one self, going beyond the self, and therefore transcending normal experience.

'''The Transition into the West'''
*'''1775:''' America Revolution occurs; sects of occult Christianity begin to emerge and the early farmers of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution were being influenced by the teachings of mystical Sufism and Jewish Kabballah, through their involvement in groups like the Rosecrucians. (Taylor, 2005)
*'''1840s to 1880s:''' Asian ideas began to seep into Western taught during the era of transcendentalists (American literary movement that taught the need to return to nature) Ex. Henry David Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson, both of who studied Vedantic scriptures. Also during this time Helena P. Blavatsky (founder of the International Theosophical Society)is credited for bringing Hindu text into the West by translating them into English. 
*'''1893:''' The World Parliament of Religion in Chicago was a landmark event that brought eastern practitioners to the west to speak publicly for the first time about meditation.
*'''1890:''' Sarah Farmer of Portsmouth, New Hampshire had been teaching the ideas of meditation at the Greenacre School of Comparative Religion.
*'''1900:''' The Sacred Books of the East series, edited by F. Max Mueller, which included Pali texts on Theravada Buddhism.
*'''1904:''' Anagarika Dharmapala lectured at Harvard on Theravada Buddhist meditation.
*'''1907:''' Soyen Shaku toured the US teaching Zen and principles of Mahayana Buddhism.
*'''1920s:''' American pop culture was introduced to meditation by Paramahansa Yoganada, taught Kriya Yoga and developed a very extensive curriculum or manual of the practice of meditation, also Shoma Morita of Japan developed a psychotherapy based on Zen Buddhism.
*'''1924:''' Gurdjieff, Georgian mystic also spread meditation.
*'''1940s:''' Krishnamurti, who fled to America with several English writers and practitioners of meditation (Aldous Huxley, Gerald Heard, Christopher Isherwood
*'''1941:''' Henrich Zimmer, Indologist and Sanskrit scholar (friend and confident of Carl Jung) introduced comparative mythology and folklorist to the Bollingen Foundation, also brought the young Joseph Campbell there. This foundation translated Jung’s collected works as well as books by Zimmer, which Campbell edited. The most influential book brought out was the I Ching. (Taylor, 2005)
*'''1950:''' Was a turning point for the interest in Asian philosophy and meditation; a Stanford professor of comparative mythology, Fredrick Speilberg, opened the California Institute of Asian Studies. Allan Watts, a student of Zen and former Episcopalian minister, soon joined the faculty and from there produced ''Psychotherapy East and West and the Meaning of Zen''. (Talyor, 2005)

Also in the 1950s Micheal Murphy first came under the influence of Speilberg and began the practice of meditation. With the assistance of Abraham Maslow, Alan Watts, and other Murphy collaborated with Richard Price to launch the '''Esalen Institute''': a centre of theory and research on various aspects of academia. There is also a work study program, which &quot;...is designed to explore and apply human values and potentials.&quot; It also has one of the largest accumulation of meditation articles (10,000) of these 1253 were scientific and literary studies on meditation.

Zen Buddhism, because of Watts and D.T. Suzuki was also becoming big in the states around this time.

'''Other factors that indirectly effected Eastern ideas coming to the West:'''
*The rise of Communism in China (1921) and their take over of Tibet and Mongolia (1950s), Soviet Influence in India (1960s), saw a lot of eastern spiritual teachers moving to the West.
*One of the best known and most influential of these figures in the 14th Dalai Lama of Tibet, Tenzin Gyatso, he defined mindfulness as “…a state of alertness in which the mind does not get caught up in thoughts or sensations, but lets them come and go, much like watching a river flow by.” (Gyatso, 2003).
*1960s mind expanding drugs were being used in a lot by post war baby boomers (approx. 40 million).  &quot;This led a lot of teens and twenties to begin to explore inward perception, experiments with alternate lifestyles, and questioning of the established cultural norms.&quot; (Taylor, 2005).
*The flux of eastern spiritual teachers and the use and experimentation of psychedelic drugs  worked together to create an expansion for each other. Thus in the 1960s psychedelic drugs subside and in the 1970s meditation becomes an enduring part of that generation. From this a boom in the study of eastern thought begins to take place in the west.
*'''1958:''' ALbert Ellis introduces Rational Psychotherapy, in which he advocates the relative acceptance of symptoms, self-acceptance etc. His therapy is now called Rational Emotive Behavioural Therapy (REBT).
*'''1980s-1990s:''' Mindfulness began to really penetrate psychotherapy in two different directions:
:1. More cognitive and scientific based use of it (i.e. Ellen Langer's use of mindfulness)
:2. A humanistic approach, which encourages the over all well-being of the individual (i.e. Jon Kabat-Zinn)
 
The ancient teachings of the eastern world have always spoken about the attainment of oneness. This can be defined as a pinnacle of spiritual achievement that permanently unites the divine essence of the adept or bodhisattva (aspirant of Buddhahood or enlightenment), to the very source of all creation, the Absolute, Tao or God. In Buddhism, this process of enlightenment or true freedom (i.e. attainment of nirvana, samadhi etc.) can only be achieved through the Bodhicitta, literally meaning the ‘enlightenment of the mind’.

:“Empty your mind of all thoughts.
:Let your heart be at peace.
:…
:return to the common source.
:Returning to the source is serenity.” (excerpt from the Tao Te Ching, Chapter 16).

The mind is a central theme not just in Buddhism, but dates back to some of the earliest eastern texts of the Aryans, the Vedas. In the most infamous of these text, the Mahabharata (The Great War), Arjuna can be seen wrestling with the act of killing his kin in the 18-day war that is to unfold. At first he patiently listens to the sacred advice of Lord Krishna, but ultimately must dig deep within to understand the concept of dharmic duty. This is the essence of mindfulness, the process of turning our undivided attention and perception to the mysteries that lay within, and ultimately where we will find our answers.

In the Mahabharata, what unfolded with Arjuna was not explicitly called mindfulness. It is not until some of the early Buddhist text that we begin to see this word emerge, particularly in the ''Suttras''(Dryden &amp; Still, 2006). It was the Pali word (the language of the early Buddhist texts) ''sati'' that was translated into what we refer to as &quot;mindfulness&quot; today. There have been debates over the translation of the word ''sati'', some translations have included &quot;self-possession&quot;, &quot;concentration&quot;, or &quot;mind development&quot; (Dryden &amp; Still, 2006). To make matters more complicated ''sati'' is often found or linked with another Pail word, ''sampajanna''. &quot; Sampajanna is sometimes translated [as]‘‘awareness,’’ so sati-sampajanna becomes ‘‘mindfulness and awareness,’’as though awareness is not automatically included as part of mindfulness.&quot; (Dryden &amp; Still, 2006, p.19). One Buddhist monk, Nanavira Thera, distinguishes &quot;awareness&quot; and &quot;mindfulness&quot; in the following way: 

:&quot;Mindfulness is general recollectedness,not being scatter-brained; whereas awareness is more precisely keeping oneself under constant observation, not letting one’s actions (or thoughts, or feelings, etc) pass unnoticed.&quot; (Dryden &amp; Still, 2006, p. 19).

The origin of the word 'mindfulness', although not without debate, is not as obscure as the introduction to this and other eastern concepts into western thought. Eastern ideas of meditation and other forms of introspective spiritual work began to emerge in the west (mostly the United States) &quot;...during the era of the transcendentalists, especially between the 1840s and the 1880s, largely influencing the American traditions of spiritualism, theosophy, and mental healing.&quot; (Taylor,2004,p.1). It really took root with the writings and works of Helena P. Blavatsky, co-founder of the International Theosophical Society. She began to translate Hindu texts into English making these eastern ideas more accessible to the readers in North America.

Furthermore, some who have used mindful concepts in their work acknowledge no influence of Buddhist ideas on their work, where as others do (Still, 2005).

'''Current Conceptualization''' 

Mindfulness refers to a compassionate and non-judgemental moment-to-moment awareness of one’s experience. Mindfulness is different from but related to meditation. There are various forms of meditations generally divided in two broad categories: Receptive practices and concentrative practices (Goleman, 1976). Receptive meditation practice involve widening our perceptual field to become more aware of our experiences, including bodily sensations, feelings, thoughts, and our 5-sense perceptions. Concentrative meditation practices involve focusing the attention on an object (e,g., the breath or the flame of a candle) narrowing the field of attention, in order to attain states of rapture. In practice, mindfulness training involves formal meditation exercises including both concentrative (e.g., sitting mindfulness with focus on the breath) and receptive practices (e.g., being aware of any objects that manifests within the field of one’s awareness). Another important aspect of structured mindfulness training program the program is that participants are invited to integrate their mindfulness practice into their daily lives, so that they bring the same quality of attention to their work, personal care, and relationships. 

'''Mindfulness and Therapy'''

Discussion of the integration of mindfulness into psychotherapy can be found as early as the 1960s, with the well-known works Psychotherapy East and West (Watts, 1960) and Psychoanalysis and Zen Buddhism (Suzuki, Fromm &amp; DeMarino, 1960). Mindfulness is central to Hakomi (ref), Sensori-Motor Psychotherapy (ref), Core Process Psychotherapy (ref), Dialectical Behavior Therapy (ref), as well as Acceptance and commitment therapy (ref), to name a few. 

There are also programs that focus specifically on mindfulness practices, the most popular and well-researched intervention being Jon Kabat-Zinn's (1982; 1990) Mindfulness-Based Stress Reducation program (MBSR) Mindfulness-based therapies have gained tremendous popularity in the last three decades. 

The traditional MBSR program involves 8 weekly 2-hour group sessions as well as a full day silent retreat. During the training, participants learn formal mindfulness exercises and are expected to set aside time for practice, 45 minutes a day, 6 days a week. The exercises are designed to help participants augment their awareness of moment-to-moment experience, including sensations, feelings, thoughts, while cultivating compassion and love. In addition to the mindfulness exercises, participants are invited by the group leader to reflect on deepening one’s mindfulness practice, so it transforms one’s way of life, can support choices that are healthier, life-enhancing choices, in particular when confronted with challenges. 

The initial impetus for the development of this program was Jon Kabat-Zinn's observation that many individuals with chronic health problems were not benefiting from allopathic medicine's interventions. Kabat-Zinn suggested to a group of doctors that they refer such individuals to the stress reduction program he created and he started gathering data to examine the effects of the intervention and found long-lasting effects (Kabat-Zinn 1982; Kabat-Zinn, Lipworth, Burney, &amp; Sellers, 1987). 

The benefits of participation in MBSR has been demonstrated for a number of physical and mental health problems including cancer, chronic pain, fibromyalgia, depression, anxiety, and disordered eating (for review see Baer, 2003 and Grossman et al., 2004).

Two similar programs have been developed in recent years: Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) and Mindfulness-Based Wellness Education (MBWE). 

MBCT was designed for individuals with history of recurrent major depressive disorder. Segal, Williams and Teasdale (2001) found that participation in MBCT prevented depressive relapse. 

'''Philosophical Underpinning'''

The use of mindfulness in psychotherapy was for patience to achieve self-acceptance, awareness, non-judgement of self or others, and over all mental well-being. The idea behind this is that the person implementing this type of practice would have more choice and control in everyday life. 

Principle behind Ellen Langer's use of Mindfulness captures most of the aims the implementation of this type of practice hopes to achieve,
:&quot;Self-acceptance is crucial to mental health. The absence of ability to unconditionally accept oneself can lead to a variety of emotional difficulties, including uncontrolled anger and depression. The person who is caught up in self-evaluation rather than self-acceptance may also be very needy and may devote considerable attention and personal resources to self-aggrandizement in order to compensate for perceived personal deficits. One of the simplest and most natural methods of reducing self-evaluation and replacing it with acceptance is to assume a mindset of mindfulness rather than mindlessness (Langer, 1989).” (Carson &amp; Langer, 2006)

Thus mindfulness is about achieving a flexible cognitive state that results from drawing novel distinctions about the situation and the environment. (Carson &amp; Langer, 2006). In this context one is aware and actively engaged in the present sensitive to both context and perspective, thus always noticing new things.The hallmarks condition of mindfulness for Langer are: (1) the ability to view both objects and situations from multiple perspectives, and (2) the ability to shift perspectives depending upon context. (Carson &amp; Langer, 2006). As opposed to mindlessness, which pigeon holes a person experience through rigid rules, regulation, prior constructions, and most importantly does not allow a person to see beyond their personal experience and see things from a alternative perspective.

Even Jon Kabat-Zinn who used mindfulness from a more Buddhist mindset, had much of Langer's aims at heart. However, Kabat-Zinn was really looking for an approach that would not only help individuals overcome pain etc., but would help them achieve overall well-being. Mindfulness meditation as used by Kabat-Zinn helped individuals to pay attention to ones thinking, to observe it and to analyse it, which was what Buddha spoke about in his original teachings. This daily practice of being mindful would then allow patience to see within and that it is a flaw in their thinking, desires, etc. that is causing their suffering.

====Emotion-Focused Therapy (EFT)====

Emotion-Focused Therapy (EFT) has also shown itself to be an effective treatment for a variety of psychological issues. For example, in a study on depression, Greenberg and Paivio (1995) reported clinically meaningful, stable gains for most clients treated with process-experiential therapy (a type of EFT), and that these gains were significantly greater improvements as compared to a psychoeducational group. In addition, Nieuwenhuis and Paivio (2001) investigated a 20-session EFT applied to adults with PTSD symptoms as a result of unresolved childhood abuse issues. Clients in the treatment group were compared to a wait-list control group. EFT clients showed significantly greater improvements than wait-list controls on measures of general anxiety and PTSD symptoms, global interpersonal problems, self-affiliation, and resolution of issues with abusive others. Several other studies have also shown EFT to be effective in treating PTSD symptoms (Soulier, 1995; Clarke, 1993; Davis, Elliott &amp; Slatick, 1998). EFT works well with clients dealing with a variety of issues because often people have not been able to develop the skills necessary to process their emotions due to past trauma and/or early attachment experiences. EFT can help increase clients’ emotional intelligence and improve their emotional processing skills so they can better regulate their emotions (Watson, 2006). Clients move towards healing and wholeness in their lives as they learn to become aware of, label, express and reflect upon their emotions so that they may move more productively towards fulfilment of their needs, values and goals (Watson, 2006).

====Solution Focused Brief Therapy====
Solution Focused Brief Therapy (SFBT) is a relatively new therapeutic approach that has been developed over the past 30 years. Practicing SFBT requires that the therapist not pathologize or spend much time focused on the details of their client’s problems.  Instead, therapists are to ask clients to work within their own definition of what they consider healthy believing that the client inherently understands themselves and knows what is best for them. A central tenant of this therapy is that individuals always have strengths that can be mobilized to improve their quality of living. 

Therapy continues for as many sessions as the client determines they need, generally consisting of two or more sessions. The therapist asks the client when they would like to return at the end of the first session and then during additional sessions the client is asked if they think it would be helpful to return for additional sessions and if so, when. Therapists are empathic and supportive while listening carefully and in a non-judgemental manner. Therapists lead from one step behind by focusing on what is important to the client.

In thinking about facilitating change, clients are viewed to fall in one of or more than one of the following categories: visitor, complainant, or customer. Change is most likely to occur at the customer level where clients take responsibility for their own impact on their problem. SFBT suggests focusing on different strategies depending which category the client falls into. 

Techniques of SFBT:
*'''Miracle Question:''' The miracle question is used to help clients formulate their own goals and amplify what clients want. An example of the miracle question is as follows: “Now, I want to ask you a strange question. Suppose that while you are sleeping tonight and the entire house is quiet, a miracle happens. The miracle is that the problem which brought you here is solved. However, because you are sleeping, you don’t know that the miracle has happened. So, when you wake up tomorrow morning, what will be different that will tell you that a miracle has happened and the problem which brought you here is solved? (de Shazer, 1988, p. 5). 
*'''Scaling Questions:''' Use scaling questions to help clients detail steps that will be to get them closer to their goal. The client is asked to rate on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 representing the problem being solved and 1 representing the problem at its worst, how they are feeling each session. It is explored with them what it would take to move up one step on the scale. 
*'''Exception Seeking Questions:''' Help clients to identify and increase occurrences of exceptions by asking them details regarding what they and those involved were doing when things seemed a little bit better. 
*'''Emphasizing Strengths:''' helps clients to feel that they have the ability to change. Increase clients’ access to their strengths by highlighting them throughout the session and summarizing them during feedback at the end of the session. 
*'''Amplifying Solution Talk:''' By focusing on solutions, rather than details about the client’s problems, the client begins to explore new possibilities. They are able to focus on what they would like to be different rather than getting lost in their problem.

===Treatment Effectiveness===

'''Research Findings'''

Historically, the question of interest was whether psychotherapy/counselling worked. To date, the research has been convincing that psychotherapy does indeed work, as a number of studies have demonstrated the efficacy and effectiveness of many types of psychotherapy, including humanistic, cognitive/behavioural/cognitive-behavioural, and psychodynamic therapies (see Lambert, 2004 for a review). 

This area of investigation then turned to investigate which therapies worked best. Since this line of research began, many studies have been conducted that have demonstrated that a number of different types of psychotherapy have been shown to be effective. For instance, Smith and Glass (1977) did the first meta-analysis on this topic (also the first ever &quot;meta-analysis&quot;) which essentially found that psychotherapy was effective. The controversial part, was that they all came out equally effective, despite vastly different theoretical underpinnings.

As a result of this, many researchers have narrowed down the area of investigation to look at: what the common factors are among each of the therapies, and what processes within psychotherapy are occurring that lead to improvements. 

Just to illustrate a number of variables that have been posited to have an impact on therapy effectiveness, research has demonstrated that such things as the therapeutic alliance, therapist empathy, collaboration and consensus on goals, client expectations, symptom severity, psychotherapeutic techniques, therapist competence, and cohesion in group therapy, are related to outcome (see Lambert, 2004 &amp; Norcross, 2002 for reviews).

Many other therapist and client variables, as well as within therapy processes have been shown to impact the therapeutic environment, so interested readers are directed to read the two books cited above for further details.

Additional brief comments, including mention of earlier research placing these variables in their historical context, illustrate how psychotherapy shares in common a number of key features and characteristics, although these often originated as explicit concerns on a particular school or approach.  Examples of note include the therapeutic alliance, mentioned above, and the use of homework assignments.  The latter generally refers to activities or tasks that the patient undertakes between therapy sessions.  The focus of a task is usually agreed during therapy and is designed so that the patient can practice or develop a skill, explore or test an idea or belief, or prepare material concerning an issue, with this work then reviewed in the next therapy session.  

As Kamins (2006) notes, “More than 70 years ago, behavioral therapists recognized the value and power of utilizing extratherapeutic time to enhance the outcome of therapy sessions” (p .189).  By the 1960s and 1970s, homework assignments were integral to a number of behavioral (Shelton &amp; Ackerman, 1974) and cognitive (Beck, Rush, Shaw, &amp; Emery, 1979) therapy models.  Shelton and Levy (1981) reported that 68% of more than 500 evaluation studies published in the early 1970s that they reviewed involved the use of homework assignments.  In the intervening years, homework assignments have become most strongly associated with cognitive-behavioral psychotherapies, with their emphasis on belief testing and skill building (Startup &amp; Edmonds, 1994).  However, homework is also given to patients engaged in contemporary forms of psychodynamic psychotherapy, particularly brief formats of this approach (Badgio, Halperin, &amp; Barber, 1999; Stricker, 2006), behavior therapy (Cox, Tisdelle, &amp; Culbert, 1988), marital and family therapies (Carr, 1997; Dattilo, 2002), and more solution-focused approaches (Beyebach, Morejon, Palenzuela, &amp; Rodriguez-Arias, 1996).  In a recent survey of over 200 New Zealand psychologists (43% of whom described their primary theoretical orientation as psychodynamic, humanistic, interpersonal, or family-systems compared with 57% who endorsed a CBT approach) homework was reported as being incorporated into therapy in 57% of sessions (Kazantzis &amp; Deane, 1999).  Indeed, many psychotherapists now appear to view homework as a key element in the process of change (Kamins, 2006).    

Psychotherapy evaluation research certainly supports this view although much of this empirical basis is for CBT.  A brief selection of recent findings follows.  Use of homework techniques was positively related to the magnitude of the effect size in a meta-analytic review of 40 studies evaluating CBT programs (skills training, problem solving, and multimodal interventions) for anger in children and adolescents (Sukhodolsky, Kassinove, &amp; Gorman, 2004).  In a meta-analysis of 24 studies evaluating cognitive-behavioral treatment for social phobia, only the effect size for cognitive restructuring combined with within-session and homework exposure exercises was significantly larger than the placebo effect size (Taylor, 1996).  Homework (whether it was assigned or not in the treatment) was also a moderator in a meta-analysis of 31 studies demonstrating positive effects for problem-solving therapy (Malouff, Thorsteinsson, &amp; Schutte, 2007).  In a CBT program for Irritable Bowel Syndrome, symptom improvement at 3 months post-treatment was associated with greater quantity and quality of homework completed (Bogalo &amp; Moss-Morris, 2006).  Finally here, Gonzalez, Schmitz, and DeLaune (2006) found that homework compliance early in a CBT program for cocaine dependence was associated with lower attrition, although overall effect of homework compliance on post-treatment cocaine use was moderated by patients’ readiness to change, which underscores the importance of considering other process variables alongside homework in psychotherapy evaluation research. 

'''Empircally-supported/empirically-validated Treatments'''

In 1993 Division 12 (Clinical Psychology) of the American Psychological Association (APA) published a list of &quot;emprically-validated&quot; treatments for a variety of mental health issues. The term used has since been changed to &quot;empirically-supported&quot; treatments and continues to be a contentious issue within the psychological community. 

The original report of the Task Force on Promotion and Dissemination of Psychological Procedures was intended to identify the characteristics of studies which enabled us to deem them &quot;efficacious&quot;. The report also include a list of examples of interventions that met these criteria. 

The Task Force (initially headed by Diane Chambless) originally intended this report to be used to guide future research and training programs to ensure that students were taught empirically-supported treatments in graduate training programs. The initial report caused a significant furore, with insurance companies quick to only fund those treatments listed and researchers and practitioners who practiced and/or studied treatments not on the list, gravely offended. 

Two issues have dominated the discussion on the use of this list. First, is the type of research required to qualify as supported under the task force's guidelines. Second, is that certain types of therapy consistently qualify under the criteria given their research histories and styles (i.e., cognitive-behaviour therapy) while others do not (i.e., psychodynamic therapies).

The two issues are closely linked, with certain types of therapy easier to &quot;manualize&quot; and briefer therapies easier to follow given the shorter time span involved. The list has also become a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy with treatments deemed efficacious eligible for more funding, while treatments which have not made the list have a harder time gaining funding in order to do the research necessary to make it on the list. 

A further issue is that although there is no list of &quot;treatments that don't work&quot; some feel that that has indeed become the situation with treatments not on the list considered ineffective, rather than &quot;yet to be supported&quot;.

===Psychopharmacology===

Psychopharmacology is a growing industry for the treatment of symptoms related to mental health issues. Although medications can only be prescribed by physicians and psychiatrists, a seemingly growing number of clients seen by psychologists and psychotherapists are taking medication while attending therapy. The four categories of psychotropic medication are briefly described as follows:

'''Four Groups of Psychotropic Medication:'''
*Anxiolytic/hypnotics: These medications are used to induce sleep, as surgical anesthesia, and for the treatment of anxiety. Common anxiolytic/hypnotics include Diazepam and Nitrazepam.
*Antipsychotics: Also called neuroleptic drugs or major tranquilizers. They are generally used in treatment for those diagnosed with psychotic disorders or schizophrenia. Common antipsychotics include Chlorpromazine, Thioridazine and Risperidone.
*Mood Stabilizers: They are generally used in treatment for those diagnosed with a mood disorder, such as bipolar disorder. Common mood stabilizers include Lithium Carbonate and Carbamazepine.
*Antidepressants: Also called Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRI). Antidepressants are used in the treatment of clinical depression. Common Antidepressants include Fluoxetine (Prozac) and Sertraline (Zoloft).

===Introduction to Perspectives on Psychological Trauma===

It has been said that whatever doesn’t kill us makes us stronger. A few people live through horrible events without experiencing much fear, but most of us react with feelings of horror and helplessness. Psychological trauma occurs in the wake of an unexpected event that is so unpleasant and shocking that the human mind and body react in an autonomic defensive manner (Thornet, 2000). For some people, surviving severe traumatic events leaves them depressed, anxious, and with other emotional scars such as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).

By definition, PTSD includes episodic re-experiencing of traumatic events, usually in the form of dysphoric memories.  Because these memories are vivid, frightening and unexpected, they have secondary effects, causing sufferers to doubt their sanity, their progress in recovery and their fundamental sense of security (Ochberg, 1998).  The original traumatic experience had elements of terror, horror, and/or helplessness, and persistent episodes of traumatic memory continue and compound such elements (Ochberg, 1998).  Recent findings have indicated PTSD prevalence rates of 5% and 10% respectively among American men and women (Kessler, Sonnega, Bromet, Hugues, &amp; Nelson, 1996).

The key to understanding the scientific basis and clinical expression of PTSD is the concept of “trauma” (Friedman, 1997).  PTSD is unique among other psychiatric diagnoses because of the great importance placed upon the etiological agent, the “traumatic stressor” (Herman, 1992).  Thus, traumatization is seen as being caused by the event, not because of some failing or weakness in the person.  In fact, one cannot make a clinical diagnosis of PTSD unless the client has actually met the “stressor criterion”.  Along with the diagnostic criteria of exposure to a “traumatic event” are symptoms from each of the three symptom clusters:  intrusive recollections, avoidant/numbing symptoms and hyperarousal symptoms (APA, 1994). A fifth criterion concerns the duration of the symptoms (APA, 1994).  The duration criteria for diagnosis of PTSD when the above criteria have been met is one month (APA, 1994).  

Not only is PTSD typified by the automatic, involuntary symptoms such as flashbacks, intrusive thoughts and autonomic hyperarousal, but also consciously mediated attempts to make meaning of the trauma experience(s) (Clark &amp; Ehlers, 2000).  The automatic and involuntary symptoms are said to represent conditioned responding to environmental triggers associated with the trauma (Clark &amp; Ehlers, 2000).  Much less is known about the origins and consequences of victims’ efforts to understand their trauma(s) or about how best to treat the symptoms associated with personal beliefs about the trauma (Meichenbaum, 1994).

In children, an important issue in the experience of trauma is its effect on the attachment system and developing brain function.

===Earliest writings on trauma cases===

Humankind has never been without traumatic events. The earliest writings of history contain evidence of the manifestation of psychological symptoms related to distressing experiences. Over time theories regarding the symptoms, causes, and treatment resulting from trauma have greatly varied. 

Initially, only women were believed to be inflicted by symptoms that had no physical explanation, such as sudden loss of sight, loss of ability to walk, or uncontrollable shaking. The earliest indication of these symptoms was recorded on an Egyptian papyrus from 1900 BC, which attributed the disorder to a wandering uterus. The use of the term, hysteria, to describe this constellation of symptoms dates back to Hippocrates (430-367 B.C.) who labeled the condition for its Greek meaning of uterus. Since this condition was only documented in women, his prescribed cure for the afflictions caused by a wandering uterus was marriage. Of note, trauma is a term widely used in psychology and its meaning is derived from the Greek word for wound. The term emerged into the neurological and psychiatric vocabulary in the 1860’s and 1870’s. Previously, the term trauma had been reserved for the description of physical wounds and had been documented in the surgical medicine literature. 

Anton Mesmer (1734-1815) was the first to explain hysteria in a physiological way.  He believed that hysteria was a direct result of a disturbed distribution of the magnetic fluid present in all humans. He appears to have been the first to document the possibility that hysterical symptoms could be present in men and women. Mesmer’s treatment for hysteria involved touching his patients with rods, which he said transmitted a magnetic force called animal magnetism from his body to the patient. He believed that this force of animal magnetism was capable of rearranging the patient’s fluids to result in healthy functioning, and thereby curing the condition of hysteria. With our knowledge today, it is widely believed that Mesmer’s approach was a predecessor of hypnotism due to his convincing manner of describing his techniques to his patients and his strong suggestions of recovery. Although Mesmer’s techniques resulted in improvement and documented cures of many of his patients, his theories and techniques were not respected by other health professionals at the time. 

With the development of the railroad in the mid 1800’s, there was also an increase in accidents and death with this initially dangerous mode of transportation. Lerner (2003) found statistics of injuries related to the railway in the United States in 1889: one out of every 117 train workers was killed and one out of every 12 workers was injured. In addition, passengers and bystanders were involved in train collisions and derailings, which in that time were common. Some accident victims seemed to complain of common symptoms such as headaches, dizziness, paralysis, and general disinterest and listlessness with no apparent physical cause. In 1866, an English physician, John Eric Erichsen (1818-1896) published several cases of this condition and coined the term “railway spine”. In addition to the above mentioned symptoms, he wrote about memory loss, confusion, diminished business aptitude, ill temper, sleep disorders, sensory impairment, attitude changes, loss of motor power, numbness and sexual impotence. Although these symptoms paralleled those of hysteria, Erichsen chose the new label of railway spine since it was previously believed that only women were inflicted with hysteria and most of his patients related to the railroad were men. 

With increasing numbers of mental health diagnoses related to trauma, treatment for these symptoms was in high demand. Jean-Martin Charcot (1825-1893) was a neurologist who believed that hypnotism was of value in treating hysterics. Originally, his theories on hysteria were somatic in nature. Over time, he adjusted his original theories to include psychological factors. Additionally, in 1882, he began treating cases of hysteria in male patients, which he reported were growing in large numbers. He described symptoms in these males as motor and sensory disturbances due to railroad accidents, workplace accidents, and service in war. He believed that these symptoms were directly related to a traumatic stimulus in those individuals who had an inherited, constitutional disposition.

As stated earlier, symptoms of hysteria were not initially believed to be inflictions of men. However, with men fighting in the frontlines of World War I where they took the lives of the opposition, witnessed violent deaths of their fellow soldiers, and often narrowly escaped death themselves, it is not surprising that many soldiers began demonstrating symptoms of what was then know as hysteria. Soldiers were documented as suffering from symptoms such as debilitating shakes, stutters, tics and tremors, disorders of sight, hearing, and gait (Lerner, 2003). Although there is evidence of other problems during other wars, the sheer number of soldiers with these inflictions caught medical authorities unprepared and therefore drew much attention. Since it was thought unfitting to diagnose these men with a woman’s illness, new labels were created to describe these combinations of symptoms as listed earlier. Many features of what is now called post-traumatic stress disorder were well-described in literary form during this time, such The Red Badge of Courage.  However, it wasn’t until World War II that there was a creation of a formal diagnostic category.  World War II had brought together soldiers, psychiatrists and other medical personnel, and they discovered that they did not always have a common vocabulary to discuss syndromes and diagnoses.  

After World War II ended, the Veterans Administration (VA) developed a diagnostic manual.  This provided incentive for the American Psychological Association (APA) to create its own first manual.  Thirteen years after his Freud’s death, the American Psychological Association (APA) published its first diagnostic and statistical manual (DSM-1) in 1952 and re-wrote his conceptualization of traumatic neurosis for Gross Stress Reaction.  During the post-war era and after there was a rise in systematic investigations of things such as the consequences of exposure to death camps and experiences of prisoners of war, as well as nonmilitary stressors such as mass catastrophes, such as fires, earthquakes and plane crashes (Adler, 1943; Andreasen, Hartford &amp; Norris, 1971). 
 
For reasons unknown, but perhaps because of the early links between military combat and stress disorders, Gross Stress Reaction was somehow dropped from DSM-II (Andreasen, 2004).  That manual was written when the United States was not engaged in any major war.  However, the scientific study of the consequences of stress continued, particularly in the area of consequences of severe burn injuries (Andreasen, 2004).

After the Vietnam War, the U.S. contained another wave of young men who had been traumatized in combat. There was no official diagnosis to give them, and therefore, no coverage for treatment. American veterans lobbied the APA to construct a diagnosis of “Post-Vietnam Syndrome” to recognize the long-term psychological damage incurred by soldiers in combat, in order to pave the way for therapeutic services. Recognizing the long history of the syndrome proposed, as well as the fact that it frequently occurred in traumatized civilians as well, and being rooted in the extensive literature on stress disorders already available at the time, the APA came up with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder as an operational diagnosis in DSM-III. Criteria specified for the new diagnosis included an initial stressor that would evoke distress in almost anyone (Criterion A), a time frame, and a list of “symptoms”.  

The diagnosis began to be used widely and its application broadened steadily. For example, it began to be used for victims of childhood sexual abuse who developed traumatic stress symptoms much later in life. The requirement that the stressor be outside the range of normal human experience was sometimes reinterpreted to include less severe stressors (Andreasen, 2004). In 1987, the criteria for PTSD was reworked in the DSM-III-R.  he veteran issues again faded in importance, while feminist practitioners took a special interest in PTSD.

Feminist therapists began lobbying the APA to alter the definition of PTSD so that more of their clients would fall under its auspices (Burstow, 2005). In 1994, PTSD was revised in DSM-IV such that Criterion A now stated that the person had to either experience, witness or be confronted with an event or events that involved actual or threatened death or serious injury or a threat to the physical integrity of self or others. The person’s response must have involved intense fear, helplessness or horror and caused clinically significant distress and impairment in social, occupational or other important areas of functioning. This incorporated the concept of “vicarious traumatization” (i.e. emergency services, rescue workers, etc.). The DSM-IV also added back what was formerly called Acute PTSD, which had been dropped from DSM-III-R, under a new name of Acute Stress Disorder (ASD). In 2000, the DSM-IV-TR PTSD reformulated such that it is not required that the traumatizing event be outside the range of normal experience and explicitly makes room for common events such as childhood sexual abuse.
Currently, trauma is of particular interest, at a time when the entire world is aware of the potential for terrorism to strike – a stressor of great magnitude that could strike at any time and anywhere. This is also a time when the U.S. is seeing the return of many traumatized young soldiers returning from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Unfortunately, the present state of our world is likely going to provide many more opportunities to study stress reactions, and the diagnoses of ASD and PTSD are likely here to stay.

===Recent expansion on the conceptualization of trauma===

Currently, there is increasing recognition of the complex impact of discrete traumatic experiences coupled with the impact of insidious trauma, intergenerational trauma and early trauma (Vasquez, 2006). 

Insidious trauma is a term that has been coined by Dr. Maria Roots. Some of the life experiences that have informed her work include her  experience of racism while growing up as mixed Filipino/Caucasian woman. She studied sociology and clinical psychology, graduating with a Ph.D. in clinical psychology from the University of Washington in 1983. Root articulated her definition of insidious trauma in 1992. Insidious trauma takes into account the impact of multiple forms of oppression anchored in race, gender, class, sexual orientation, immigration, and culture. Dr. Roots highlights that this consequences of these type of trauma are sometimes very difficult to identify and that the symptoms of insidious trauma are often attributed to people’s personalities or mental disorder. This is turns can further consolidate a distorted self-image and adoption of a view of self as sick. 

Some example of insidious trauma include the lasting effects of European colonization upon indigenous people on the North American continent. The internalized oppression of many queer people, the residuals of slavery of African Americans, or the impact of violence against women. 

There is increased recognition that insidious trauma as well as more direct forms of trauma often have intergenerational effects. The emerging literature appear first to focus on children of survivors and now stories of great-children of survivors of the holocaust demonstrating that they can trauma adaptation / symptoms can be passed down. Two popular Canadian case example include the experience of many children of indigenous residential school survivors (Manzes, 2003), or the children of the children of Duplessi who have higher levels of substance use and other forms of emotional problems.

===Assessment of Trauma and PTSD===
====Assessment Instruments====
Frueh, Elhai, &amp; Kaloupek (2004) provided a list of measures of trauma and suggest that these measures can be classified within the following four categories:
*'''Trauma exposure measures'''
:Traumatic Life Events Questionnaire
:Traumatic Stress Schedule
*'''Symptom-referenced PTSD measures'''
:PTSD Symptom Scale
:PTSD Checklist
*'''PTSD diagnostic measures based on standard interview formats''' 
:Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID) PTSD Module
:Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS)
*'''Psychometrically derived PTSD measures'''
:Mississippi Combat PTSD Scale 
:Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 (MMPI-2)

=== Treatment Throughout History === 

==== Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing (EMDR) ====

EMDR is a recently developed psychotherapy that is best known as a treatment for psychological problems relating to traumatic life experiences. In 1987, Francine Shapiro noticed that her own upsetting throughs faded when her eyes spontaneously moved rapidly from side to side.  She developed a complex method, combining behavioral and client centered approaches, in which the client concentrates intensely on the most distressing segment of their traumatic memory while following with their eyes the therapist's fingers moving across the visual field.  Shapiro (1995) had presented this method in detail.  The literature strongly suggests that EMDR is superior to traditional forms of trauma therapy (Greenwald, 1998).

==== Exposure Therapy ====

Keane and his colleagues first applied Exposure Therapy (ET) to the treatment of PTSD in the form of single-subject designed studies to document the effects of exposure to memories of traumatic events (Black &amp; Keane, 1982; Fairbank &amp; Keane, 1982; Kaloupek &amp; Keane, 1982).  Significant reductions in trauma symptoms, anxiety, and other related symptoms were found as a function of ET interventions.  This preliminary work led to the development of randomized clinical trials that compared Imaginal Based ET to the less intensive treatment of Anxiety Management Therapy (AMT) and wait-list controls.  The results of this study were clear.  Compared to the wait-list condition and AMT, those clients receiving ET showed significant reductions on standard psychometric instruments and on clinician ratings of symptoms, and changes were maintained at a 6-month follow-up (Caddell, Fairbank, Keane &amp; Zimmering, 1989).

More recently, many studies have appeared in the literature comparing the effectiveness of ET to Cognitive Therapy (CT).  For example, Barrowclough, Faragher, Graham, Pilgrim, Reynolds, Sommerfield &amp; Tarrier (1999) examined the effectiveness of ET and CT in the treatment of outpatients with PTSD stemming from many different traumatic events.  Both groups manifested significant improvements that were maintained at a 6-month follow-up.  No significant differences were found between the two treatments and outcomes were favorable for both groups.  Similar results have also been found by other authors, such as Astin, Nishith, and Resick (2000) who reported on the comparison of ET and CT in the treatment of rape-related PTSD.  In general, the two treatments have been found to be equally effective and more effective than wait-list control groups.

==== Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy ====

Cognitive Therapy (CT) involves addressing key cognitive distortions found among people who have been traumatized.  In particular, the interventions are designed to address difficulties in safety, trust, power, self-esteem, and intimacy in the lives of survivors.  Combination treatments that include an array of cognitive-behavioral strategies have had intuitive clinical appeal because they address multiple problems that people with PTSD may exhibit, as well as incorporating techniques that have empirical support in the literature.  For example, Fecteau and Nicki (1999) examined a treatment package of 8-10 sessions including trauma education, ET, cognitive restructuring and guided behavioral practice and compared outcomes to wait-list controls.  The results of the intervention were successful as measured by clinical ratings, self-report questionnaires, and a laboratory-based psychophysiological assessment procedure.  The results were clinically, as well as statistically, significant and the treatment effects were maintained at 6-month follow-up.

==== Emotion-Focussed Therapy ====

Emotion-Focused Therapy (EFT) has also shown itself to be effective in helping clients deal with the sequelae of trauma.  For example, Greenberg and Paivio (1995) reported clinically meaningful, stable gains for most clients treated with process-experiential therapy (a type of EFT), and that these gains were significantly greater improvements as compared to a psychoeducational group.  In addition, Nieuwenhuis and Paivio (2001) investigated a 20-session EFT applied to adults with PTSD symptoms as a result of unresolved childhood abuse issues.  Clients in the treatment group were compared to a wait-list control group.  EFT clients showed significantly greater improvements than wait-list controls on measures of general anxiety and PTSD symptoms, global interpersonal problems, self-affiliation, and resolution of issues with abusive others.  Several other studies have also shown EFT to be effective in treating PTSD symptoms (Soulier, 1995; Clarke, 1993; Davis, Elliott &amp; Slatick, 1998).  These studies are more than adequate to support the conclusion that EFT is an efficacious and specific treatment for people suffering the effects of trauma (Elliott et al., 2003).  I would argue that EFT works well with clients dealing with PTSD symptoms because often such clients have not been able to develop the skills necessary to process their emotions due to past trauma and/or early attachment experiences.  EFT can help increase clients’ emotional intelligence and improve their emotional processing skills so they can better regulate their emotions (Watson, 2006). Clients move towards healing and wholeness in their lives as they learn to become aware of, label, express and reflect upon their emotions so that they may move more productively towards fulfillment of their needs, values and goals (Watson, 2006).

==== Expressive Writing ====

Emotional expression has long been viewed as a vital component of good mental and physical health, and it is an important ingredient of many forms of psychotherapy. In fact, the use of writing about stressful life events and negative emotions has been used extensively by artists and poets throughout history, who have advocated for its use in promoting healing for themselves and others (DeSalvo, 1999). Expressive writing techniques are also not new to therapeutic settings as clinicians and counsellors have used “journaling” to facilitate healing (Progoff, 1977), and have increasingly encouraged writing assignments as “homework” throughout the psychotherapy endeavor (Lepore &amp; Smyth, 2002). Despite its frequent use however, the difference today is that many researchers are beginning to empirically study the therapeutic benefits of writing.

A number of reasons exist for this increased attention. First, a plethora of studies have demonstrated the effectiveness and success of the writing paradigm developed by James Pennebaker and colleagues (Pennebaker &amp; Beall, 1986). This procedure, known as expressive writing (EW), involves asking participants to write emotionally about their most traumatic/stressful life event on several occasions for about 20-30 minutes. Research has continuously linked EW with improvements in reported physical health, psychological well-being, as well as medical physiological and general functioning (Smyth, 1998). 

Second, this widely studied EW procedure may provide a low-cost treatment that many clinicians may find useful as a result of the demands to keep costs down and services available (Lepore &amp; Smyth, 2002). As a result, the continued development and investigation of inexpensive treatment methods such as the EW intervention have been deemed critical in the face of these demands (Friedman, Sobel, Myers, Caudill &amp; Benson, 1995). 

Third, despite a desire to discuss personally traumatic and stressful experiences with other individuals, a number of constraints limit or prevent people from being able to do this. For instance, social constraints, personal inhibitions, a lack of availability/suitability of services offered, or limited mobility may all contribute to this problem (Lepore, Silver, Wortman, &amp; Wayment, 1996; Pennebaker &amp; Harber, 1993). The use of the EW intervention allows for one to overcome these obstacles by offering individuals the opportunity to express their thoughts, needs, and emotions in whatever environment they choose, without concern that they will be looked down upon or incur social/interpersonal consequences for doing so.

The initial EW study conducted by Pennebaker and Beall (1986) was grounded in the idea that a failure to disclose personally traumatic events leads to an increased incidence of distress and stress related diseases. In this seminal study, Pennebaker and Beall (1986) set out to investigate whether writing about traumatic events would impact long-term indices of health, as well as short-term measures of mood and physiological arousal. A total of 46 undergraduate participants were randomly assigned to one of four writing conditions: 1) a control condition where they were instructed to write about different trivial topics (e.g., the shoes they were wearing, or a description of their living room; 2) a trauma-fact condition where they were instructed to write about an upsetting experience in a narrative form without any reference to emotions; 3) a trauma-emotion condition where they were instructed to write about the feelings they had in response to an upsetting experience, with specific direction not to describe what the experience entailed; and 4) a trauma-combination condition where they were instructed to write about both the upsetting event, and their thoughts and emotions they had in response to the event. Participants in each group were requested to write their essays for 15 min each night on four consecutive evenings. Participants in the control condition were assigned a different trivial topic each night, and participants in the trauma conditions were given the option of writing about the same traumatic experience, or to choose a different upsetting event each night. A number of pre-writing and post-writing outcome measures were collected, as well as follow up measures four months later.

The results of this influential study indicated that overall, writing emotionally about a traumatic experience (trauma-emotion condition and trauma-combination condition) resulted in greater physiological reactivity and more negative mood immediately after writing in comparison to the control condition and the trauma-fact condition. However, at four month follow up, those participants in these two emotionally expressive writing conditions also reported fewer physical health problems. Additionally, those participants in the trauma-combination condition only reported visiting the campus health center less frequently than the other groups in the six months following the writing. Finally, it is important to highlight that writing simply about the facts of the traumatic experience was not associated with reports of feeling upset, heightened physiological arousal, or any long-term improvements in health.

Since the publication of this study, a number of investigators have examined the therapeutic effects and health improvements of the EW intervention by attempting to replicate and extend the findings. Using this writing paradigm, researchers have found differences between experimental and control groups on a variety of outcome indices including: psychological well-being, physical health, health centre visits, immune response measures, re-employment status, adjustment to college, and grade point average (Smyth, 1998). Additionally, the EW intervention has been used on a number of non-clinical and clinical populations including: undergraduate students, community samples, terminally ill and non-terminally ill patients (e.g., cancer, asthma, and arthritis), psychiatric patients (e.g., depressed, suicidal, and those with PTSD), prison inmates, and people suffering from relationship difficulties or bereavement (see reviews by Frisina, Borod &amp; Lepore, 2004; Lepore &amp; Smyth, 2002; Smyth, 1998).
Although the literature does show some inconsistent findings (e.g., Gidron, Peri, Connolly &amp; Shalev, 1996; Walker, Nail &amp; Croyle, 1999), two meta-analyses have been conducted and have supported the effectiveness of the EW intervention with both non-clinical (Smyth, 1998), and clinical samples (Frisina et al., 2004).

After a review of the EW literature it is reasonable to suggest that this form of therapeutic writing results in improvements in emotional and physical health in a number of individuals. However, a continuing puzzle remains as to how and why it works. Up to this point, a myriad of theories have been posited, and a number of reviews are helpful in understanding the specifics of each theory, and the empirical support (or lack thereof) that exists for each (see Kennedy-Moore &amp; Watson, 1999; Lepore &amp; Smyth, 2002; Sloan &amp; Marx, 2004a). To date, a few of the more common hypotheses proposed include: decreasing the physiological work of emotional inhibition (Pennebaker, 1989; Sloan, Marx, &amp; Epstein, 2005), forming a narrative which strengthens cognitive-emotional integration (Park &amp; Blumberg, 2002; Smyth, True, &amp; Souto, 2001), being exposed to a feared memory or thoughts and habituating the fear/anxiety response, (Bootzin, 1997; Pennebaker, 1997; Sloan &amp; Marx, 2004b), increasing self-understanding or insight into a problem or past trauma (Kennedy-Moore &amp; Watson, 1999; Pennebaker, 1993a; Pennebaker, 1993b), enhancing positive emotional reflection (Kennedy-Moore &amp; Watson, 1999), and impacting interpersonal interactions and/or social support (Kennedy-Moore &amp; Watson, 1999; Pennebaker &amp; Graybeal, 2001).

After evaluating the theories underlying the expressive writing paradigm, along with the inconsistent and overlapping empirical support for each theory, Sloan and Marx (2004a) have recently concluded that no single theory appears to account for the effectiveness of the EW intervention. To support this claim, even James Pennebaker (2004), in a commentary of the Sloan and Marx (2004a) article admits, “most likely, there was never any reasonable hope of uncovering a single theory or mediating process to explain the power of writing” (p.138). He goes on to offer a number of reasons for this dilemma including: 1) major differences in the populations studied (e.g., age, gender, ethnicity, diagnoses, sick versus healthy, distressed versus not distressed), 2) differences in the writing topics varying from traumatic childhood experiences to ongoing current stressors, and 3) a myriad of different outcome measures that measure vastly different emotions, symptoms or behaviours. Additionally, Pennebaker (2004) suggests that the lack of one single theoretical explanation is also due to the fact that EW affects people on a variety of levels. Specifically, he argues that a number of short and long-term emotional and cognitive changes likely impact and interact with social and biological processes, making a single explanatory theory improbable.

=== Diagnostic Issues ===

By definition, PTSD includes episodic re-experiencing of traumatic events, usually in the form of dysphoric memories.  Because these memories are vivid, frightening and unexpected, they have secondary effects, causing sufferers to doubt their sanity, their progress in recovery and their fundamental sense of security (Ochberg, 1998).  The original traumatic experience had elements of terror, horror, and/or helplessness, and persistent episodes of traumatic memory continue and compound such elements (Ochberg, 1998).  Recent findings have indicated PTSD prevalence rates of 5% and 10% respectively among American men and women (Kessler, Sonnega, Bromet, Hugues, &amp; Nelson, 1996).

The key to understanding the scientific basis and clinical expression of PTSD is the concept of “trauma” (Friedman, 1997).  PTSD is unique among other psychiatric diagnoses because of the great importance placed upon the etiological agent, the “traumatic stressor” (Herman, 1992).  Thus, traumatization is seen as being caused by the event, not because of some failing or weakness in the person.  In fact, one cannot make a clinical diagnosis of PTSD unless the client has actually met the “stressor criterion”.  Along with the diagnostic criteria of exposure to a “traumatic event” are symptoms from each of the three symptom clusters:  intrusive recollections, avoidant/numbing symptoms and hyperarousal symptoms (APA, 1994). A fifth criterion concerns the duration of the symptoms (APA, 1994).  The duration criteria for diagnosis of PTSD when the above criteria have been met is one month (APA, 1994).  

Not only is PTSD typified by the automatic, involuntary symptoms such as flashbacks, intrusive thoughts and autonomic hyperarousal, but also consciously mediated attempts to make meaning of the trauma experience(s) (Clark &amp; Ehlers, 2000).  The automatic and involuntary symptoms are said to represent conditioned responding to environmental triggers associated with the trauma (Clark &amp; Ehlers, 2000).  Much less is known about the origins and consequences of victims’ efforts to understand their trauma(s) or about how best to treat the symptoms associated with personal beliefs about the trauma (Meichenbaum, 1994).

Research has shown that clients with PTSD are twice as likely to suffer from a co-morbid psychiatric disorder as those without PTSD, which means there can be complicating factors in proper diagnosis (Kulka, Fairbank, Hough, Jordan, Marmar, Mavissakalian &amp; Schlenger, 1990).  Thus, PTSD is frequently a diagnostic oversight that can lead to improper treatment strategies (Kulka et al., 1990).  This is, in part, because of the reticence of patients to talk about traumatic experiences, which makes the therapeutic relationship an important first step in proper identification.

=== Key Figures ===

* '''Pierre Janet''' published L'Automatisme Psychologique, which was his first work to deal with how the mind processes traumatic experiences. &quot;Janet claimed that vehement emotions interfere with proper appraisal and appropriate action. Failure to confront the experience fully leads to dissociation of the traumatic memories and their return as fragmentary reliving experiences, feeling states, somatic sensations, visual images, and behavioral reenactments. A century later, Janet still provides an unsurpassed framework for integrating current knowledge about the psychodynamic, cognitive, and biological effects of human traumatization&quot; (Brown, van der Hart &amp; van der Kolk, 1989).
* '''Edna B. Foa''' has been described as one of the leading experts in post-traumatic stress disorder research. Among her many publications, are the popular books ''Posttraumatic stress disorder: DSM-IV and beyond'' (American Psychiatric Press, Inc: 1992) and ''Treating the Trauma of Rape'' (Guilford Publications, Inc.: 1997)
* '''Judith Herman''' is a well-known psychiatrist in the field of trauma research.

==Historical Perspectives on Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)==

===A Brief History of Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)===

Children, adolescents, and adults experiencing problems with attention, hyperactivity, and impulse control have appeared throughout history. For instance, a literary reference to the malady of attention was made by Shakespeare in ''King Henry VIII'' (Barkley, 2003). A hyperactive child was the focus of a German poem, “Fidgety Phil”, by physician Heinrich Hoffman. William James, in his ''Principles of Psychology'', described a normal variant of character that he called the “explosive will”, which resembles the difficulties experienced by those who today are described as having ADHD. However, more serious clinical interest in children with ADHD first occurred in three lectures of the English physician George Still (1902) before the Royal Academy of Physicians (Barkley, 2003).

Still reported a group of 20 children in his clinical practice whom he defined as having a deficit in “volitional inhibition”. He described these children as aggressive, passionate, lawless, inattentive, impulsive, and overactive. Still’s observations were quite astute, describing many of the features that would come to be corroborated in research over the next century such as overrepresentation of male subjects, high comorbidity with Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD), and a familial predisposition, among others (Barkley, 2003). 

After the encephalitis epidemics of 1917-1918, interest in these children arouse in North America. Children surviving these brain infections had many behavioural problems similar to those seen in contemporary ADHD (Barkley, 2003). These cases and others known to have arisen from birth trauma, head injury, toxin exposure, and infections, gave rise to the concept of a “brain-injured child syndrome”. This concept evolved into that of “minimal brain damage” and eventually “minimal brain dysfunction” (MBD) as challenges were raised to the label in view of the dearth of evidence of obvious brain injury in most cases (Barkley, 2003).

During the 1950s and 1960s, others became interested in the more specific behaviors of hyperactivity and poor impulse control characterizing these children. The disorder was labeled “hyperkinetic impulse disorder” and was attributed to cortical overstimulation due to poor thalamic filtering of stimuli entering the brain (Barkley, 2005). This definition marked a shift in diagnostic terminology away from the obvious conclusion that such symptoms indicated brain damage or dysfunction and toward a more descriptive view of the disorder. These changes in perspective gave rise to the diagnostic term “hyperactive child syndrome”. Nevertheless, a belief continued among clinicians and researchers of this era that the condition had some sort of neurological origin.

Yet the larger influence of psychoanalytic thought held sway over child psychiatry and along with it the belief that children’s mental disorders necessarily arouse as a reaction to various environmental factors, particularly early events in the family life of the child (Barkley, 2005). Therefore, in the second edition of the DSM, hyperactive child syndrome became “hyperkinetic reaction of childhood”. Problems with attention and distractibility were included under the definition of the disorder. Also, the recognition that the disorder was not caused by brain damage created the beginnings of the major conceptual rift between professionals in North America and those in Europe that continues to some extent in the present. In North America, ADHD is viewed as a developmental disorder having substantial biological origins. In contrast, in Europe, these same children are viewed as having a conduct problem because of their often hostile, defiant and belligerent nature and it is viewed as a behavioural disturbance believed to originate largely due to poor parental management, family dysfunction and/or social disadvantage (Barkley, 2005).

By the 1970s, research was appearing that emphasized the importance of problems with sustained attention and impulse control in addition to hyperactivity in understanding the nature of the disorder (Barkley, 2005). Douglas (1983) would eventually come to theorize that the disorder was comprised of four major deficits, these being in the investment, organization, and maintenance of attention and effort, the ability to inhibit impulse behaviour, the ability to modulate levels of arousal to meet situational demands, and an unusual strong inclination to seek immediate reinforcement (in Barkley, 2005). Douglas’s seminal paper, along with the numerous studies of attention, impulsiveness and other cognitive sequel of this disorder that followed, eventually led to retitling the disorder as “attention-deficit disorder” (ADD) in 1980 (Barkley, 2003).

During the 1980s, reports began to appear that challenged the notion that ADHD was primarily a disturbance in attention, instead focusing upon problems with motivation generally, and insensitivity to response consequences specifically (Barkley, 2005). Research was demonstrating that children with ADHD did not respond in the same way to alterations in contingencies of reinforcement or punishment as did normal children. In addition, in the late 1980s, researchers employed information-processing paradigms to study ADHD and found that problems in perception and information processing were not as evident as were problems with motivation and response inhibition (Barkley, 2003). The problems with hyperactivity and impulsivity also were found to form a single dimension of behavior. 

Debate continues to the present over the core deficits of ADHD, with increasing weight being given to problems with behavioral inhibition, self-regulation, and the related domain of executive function. Moreover, controversy still continues around the place of a subtype composed primarily of inattention within the larger condition of ADHD, with some arguing that it is a distinct disorder. 

Presently, ADHD is defined as a complex, highly heritable, heterogeneous, and prevalent disorder, which occurs in 3% to 5% of children. It is characterized by developmentally inappropriate and impairing levels of inattentive and/or hyperactive/impulsive behavior, which initially appears in childhood and manifests itself with symptoms of hyperactivity, forgetfulness, poor impulse control, and distractibility. The disorder is also associated with a wide range of cognitive difficulties and high rates of comorbidity with learning disorders and other psychiatric disorders. ADHD tends to persist into adulthood and contributes to increased risk for problems in educational, occupational, and psychiatric domains.

===Historical Perspectives on the Diagnosis of ADHD===

====Early Discovery and Diagnosis====

Much of the early clinical work on ADHD was completed in England. A British pediatrician, Dr. G. F. Still, described hyperactive and impulsive behaviour of children in 1902, indicating that it was an unknown medical diagnosis (McNeil Pediatrics, 2007). By 1922, symptoms that are currently associated with ADHD were documented and given a diagnosis of &quot;Post-Encephalitic Behaviour Disorder&quot;. In the 1970s, symptoms of inattention, such as lack of focus and daydreaming, were first associated with the impulsive and hyperactive symptoms described over 50 years earlier by Dr. Still. 

It was not until the 1980s, however, that the American Psychological Association identified a cluster of behavioural symptoms as Attention Deficit Disorder with or without hyperactivity (ADD +/-) in the DSM-III. Shortly after, in 1987, ADD was renamed Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD; McNeil Pediatrics, 2007).

====Current Diagnosis====

Currently, the ''Diagnosis and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'' (see the section on the DSM-IV) provides criteria for the diagnosis of ADHD, with the following three types specified: primarily inattentive (ADHD-IA), primarily hyperactive and impulsive (ADHD-HI), and a combination of ADHD-IA and ADHD-HI.

For each type, diagnosis of ADHD is made only if the individual displays at least six of the nine symptoms for inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, or both, shown below:

Symptoms of inattention:
*Fails to give close attention to details, makes careless mistakes
*Has difficulty sustaining attention
*Does not seem to listen
*Has difficulty organizing tasks and activities
*Avoids or dislikes tasks requiring sustained effort
*Loses things needed for tasks
*Is easily distracted by extraneous stimuli
*Is often forgetful in daily activities

Symptoms of Hyperactivity and Impulsivity:
*Fidgets with hands or feet, squirms in seat
*Leaves seat in classroom or in other situations
*Runs about or climbs excessively
*Has difficulty playing or engaging in leisure activities quietly
*Talks excessively
*Acts as if “driven by motor” and cannot sit still
*Blurts out answers before questions are completed
*Has difficulty waiting in line or awaiting turn in games or activities
*Interrupts or intrudes on others

In addition to the criteria listed in the DSM-IV, behavioural assessment methods are increasingly being used to identify ADHD (Lerner, 2003). These include teacher rating scales and parent rating scales, such as the Conners’ Rating Scales, and direct observation. Whether using the DSM-IV or behavioural assessment methods for diagnosis, ADHD is typically associated with activity and attentional difficulties that are present for at least six months and to a degree that is developmentally deviant by the age of seven (Santrock, Woloshyn, Gallagher, Di Petta, &amp; Marini, 2004). It is recommended that clinicians use more than one diagnostic method when assessing a child for ADHD to prevent a misdiagnosis.

There is controversy due to the recent increase in the diagnosis of ADHD (Santrock ''et al.'', 2004) Some experts attribute the increase to improved awareness of the disorder, however, others are concerned that many children are being misdiagnosed with the disorder without extensive professional assessment using multiple sources.

===Historical Perspectives on Treatment for ADHD===

Although the symptoms characterizing ADHD were first described in the early 1900s (see above), effective pharmacological treatments were not available until more than a half-century later.  In 1937, physicians discovered that amphetamines could effectively reduce the cluster of hyperactive and impulsive behaviours associated with what was then called “Minimal Brain Dysfunction” (MBD). However, it was not until over a decade later, in the 1950s, that stimulant medications were regularly used as therapy to treat MBD. 

In 1954, methylphenidate, a mild central nervous system stimulant was patented by the Ciba pharmaceutical company. Initially prescribed as a treatment for depression, chronic fatigue, and narcolepsy, methylphenidate has effects similar to, caffeine (though more potent) and amphetamines (though less potent). In 1956, the well-known methylphenidate brand-name Ritalin was introduced as a treatment for hyperactivity and impulsivity. It has a notably calming and “focusing” effect on individuals exhibiting such symptoms and facilitates concentration on work and other tasks. It is generally well tolerated by patients when prescribed in correct dosages (Steele et al., 2006).  Based on brain imaging studies, researchers believe that methylphenidate’s therapeutic effects are due to increases in dopamine (a neurotransmitter) levels (Volkow et al., 2002).  Today, methylphenidate is the most widely prescribed pharmacological treatment for ADHD around the world.

In the early 1960s Dr. Stella Chess coined the term “Hyperactive Child Syndrome”, referring to the cluster of behavioural symptoms of hyperactivity and impulsivity (anon, 2007). Following the disorder’s name-change, stimulant prescription increased dramatically and quickly became a widespread treatment for the &quot;syndrome&quot;. Despite much speculation at the time regarding the etiology of the hyperactive child syndrome (e.g., poor parenting, environmental toxins, food allergies, etc.), Dr. Chess believed that it had a biological basis (anon, 2007). Research examining the effects of diet on hyperactive behaviour began in the 1970s and while the belief that hyperactive symptoms can be traced back to the child’s diet (e.g., sugar, junk food, etc.) has been a robust one, several empirically based studies have discounted many of these claims (e.g., Wolraich et al., 1995). Further, there is little scientific evidence to indicate that dietary treatments alleviate symptoms of ADHD (Bateman et al., 2004).
 
In the 1970s, behaviour modification was first applied systematically to manage the behavioural problems associated with ADHD. Considering that 8-25% of children with the disorder do not respond positively to pharmacological treatment, effective behavioural interventions play an important role in symptom management (Barkley, 2004). Traditionally, behavioural treatments have been divided into three classes: direct contingency management, clinical behaviour therapy, and cognitive-behavioural procedures.  Of these behavioural therapy techniques, contingency management procedures in particular (e.g., token reinforcement) have provided clear benefits, both at home and in the classroom, for children with ADHD  (Barkley, 2004). Cognitive behavioural therapy on the other hand, may be more effective in laboratory compared to real-world settings (Barkley, 2004).

In 1999, the MTA cooperative group conducted an extensive study examining the effects of various treatments and their combinations on core ADHD symptoms.  For the management of hyperactivity and impulsivity, the authors found that a combined treatment (where child receives both medication and behavioural treatment) yielded similar benefits as those seen medication-only management (MTA, 1999). It is important to note, however, that positive outcomes of the combined treatment group were achieved at significantly lower drug doses than those used in medication-only group.

Although research on ADHD treatment continued throughout the 1980s and 1990s, it was only in 1996 that a second stimulant medication, named Adderall, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Shortly thereafter, Matadate (1999), Concerta (2000), and Focalin (2001) gained FDA approval for ADHD management. Concerta was the first once-daily, 12-hour release medication available for treatment of the disorder. Research has shown that long-acting methylphenidate formulas such as Concerta are equally effective as instant release preparations (Pelham et al., 2001; Hoare et al., 2005).

In 2001, the American Academy of Paediatrics published recommendations for the treatment of children diagnosed with ADHD in the Journal Pediatrics. These guidelines, intended to be used by paediatricians working in primary care settings, outline steps to develop a treatment program in collaboration with the child’s family and school, as well as follow-up procedures.

In 2002, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry published parameters to guide physicians in the prescription of stimulant medication. The guidelines, which were devised following extensive, independent literature reviews, provide physicians with empirically-based recommendations for the treatment of children, adolescents, and adults with ADHD.

Also in 2002, the U.S. FDA approved Strattera, the first non-stimulant medication for the treatment of ADHD. Strattera, is a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (NRI), which means that it increases the level of the norepinephrine (also known as noradrenaline) neurotransmitter in the brain by partially blocking the transporters that remove it from the synapses. 

In 2006, Daytrana, a once-daily transdermal patch for the treatment of ADHD was approved by the U.S. FDA. The patch delivers methylphenidate in doses of 10, 15, 20, or 30 mg, but must be applied several hours before the effect is desired (Peck, 2006). Furthermore, because Daytrana’s effect lingers for several hours after patch removal, the patch should be removed in the mid-to-late afternoon in order to avoid insomnia.

In recent years, reports of methylphenidate abuse by individuals for whom it is not prescribed have surfaced. The drug is abused for its stimulant effects of appetite suppression, wakefulness, increased focus/attentiveness, and euphoria. Addiction to methylphenidate is most likely to occur when it is taken in sudden large doses, resulting in rapid increases of dopamine (a CNS neurotransmitter) (Volkow and Swanson, 2003).  Conversely, the therapeutic effect of the drug as used in the treatment of ADHD is achieved by slow and steady increases in dopamine, resembling the natural production of this neurotransmitter by the brain (Volkow and Swanson, 2003). The risk of addiction of prescribed methylphenidate, therefore, is small, as doses of prescribed by physicians start low and increase slowly until a therapeutic effect is achieved.

==Historical Perspectives on Autism Spectrum Disorders==

The disorder known today as ''autism'' has a tumultuous and controversial history. It was originally viewed as childhood schizophrenia, followed by the belief that the disorder was the result of a “refrigerator mother”, in Bruno Bettelheim’s words. The disorder was finally identified in the terms we know today by two doctors working half a world away from each other –in the United States and Austria. 
This section briefly outlines the history of how Leo Kanner and Hans Asperger identified the similar symptoms in children, arriving at very similar conclusions of what the symptoms comprised. In the 1940s, both Leon Kanner in the United States and Hans Asperger in Austria noted characteristics of children referred today as having autism spectrum disorders. Kanner and Asperger were not aware of each other's work, and it wasn't until Lorna Wing published Asperger's writings that the similarity between the two clinicians' descriptions emerged. Both described children with odd social skills. Yet, Kanner recorded more severe cases in which language and communication did not develop at all, while Asperger recorded the characteristics of children with typical or even high intelligence and language development, but odd social behaviours.

The disorder known today as autism has a tumultuous and controversial history. It was originally viewed as childhood schizophrenia, followed by the belief that the disorder was the result of a “refrigerator mother”, in Bruno Bettelheim’s words. This section briefly outlines how the disorder we know today was identified and explained by two doctors working half a world away from each other – in the United States and Austria. 

In the 1980s, diagnostic measures were developed that significantly improved diagnostic validity and specificity. Michael Rutter and Catherine Lord devised the Autism Diagnostic Interview, which is a semi-structured interview that details the child’s development and probes for autistic symptoms. To complement this parent interview, the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule was devised. This tool puts the child or adult in a social situation with a variety of activities, and provides an estimate of the child’s social abilities. 

Today, autism is considered to be a spectrum of disorders, spanning from severely autistic symptoms (e.g., no language development) to relatively mild symptoms (e.g., high intelligence with very few social skills). The disorders are therefore termed autism spectrum disorders, and include the diagnostic labels of autism, Asperger syndrome, or pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS). This conceptualization has broadened our knowledge of symptoms, and has enabled a large number of people to seek support and guidance which adequately suits their particular needs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===A Brief History of Psychological Testing===

Although the widespread use of psychological testing is largely a phenomenon of the 20th century, it has been noted that rudimentary forms of testing date back to at least 2200 B.C., when the Chinese emperor had his officials examined every third year to determine their fitness for office (Gregory, 1992). Such testing was modified and  refined over the centuries until written exams were introduced in the Han dynasty. The Chinese examination system took its final form about 1370 when proficiency in the Confusian Classics was emphasized. The examinations were grueling and rigorous (e.g., spend a day and a night in a small isolated booth composing essays on assigned topics and writing a poem). Those who passed the hierarchical examinations became mandarins or eligible for public office (Gregory, 1992). However, the similarities between the ancient Chinese traditions and current testing practices are superficial. 

Psychological testing also owes as much to early psychiatry as it does to the laboratories of experimental psychology. The examination of the mentally ill around the middle of the last century resulted in the development of numerous early tests. For instance, in 1885, German physician Hubert von Grashey developed the antecedent of the memory drum as a means of testing brain-injured patients. In 1889, German psychiatrist Conrad Rieger developed a battery to assess defects resulting from brain injury, which included assessment of long- term memory, visual recognition, and short-term memory (Gregory, 1992). These early tests lacked standardization and were relegated to oblivion (Gregory, 1992). Nonetheless, they were influential in determining the course of psychological testing. 

Most historians trace the beginnings of psychological testing to the experimental investigation of individual differences that flourished in Germany and Great Britain in the late 1800s. Early experimentalists like Wilhelm Wundt, Francis Galton, and James Cattell laid the foundation for testing in the twentieth century (Gregory, 1992).  They departed from the wholly subjective and introspective methods and began to test human abilities in laboratories. For instance, Galton used several of the psychophysical procedures practiced by Wundt and others in Europe and adapted them to a series of simple and quick sensorimotor measures. To further study individual differences, Galton set up a laboratory in London at the International Health Exhibition in 1884, which was later transferred to a London Museum (Gregory, 1992). The tests and measures used involved both the physical and behavioral domains. Galton has often been regarded as the father of mental testing by historians (Gregory, 1992). Even though his simplistic attempts to gauge intellect with measures of reaction time and sensory discrimination proved fruitless, he provided a tremendous impetus to the testing movement by demonstrating that objective tests could be devised and that meaningful scores could be obtained through standardized procedures (Gregory, 1992). 

James McKeen Cattell studied the new experimental psychology with both Wundt and Galton before settling in Columbia University. Cattell continued studying reaction times to measure individual differences (Gregory, 1992). Cattell also introduced the term “mental test” in his famous paper entitled “Mental Tests and Measurements”. This paper described ten mental tests, which were physiological and sensory measures, reflecting his Galtonian heritage  (Gregory, 1992). Clark Wissler, one of Cattell’s doctoral graduates, conducted a study to test whether results could predict academic performance. His results showed virtually no tendency for the mental test scores to correlate with academic achievement. 

With the publication of Wissler’s results, experimental psychologists largely abandoned the use of reaction time and sensory discrimination as measures of intelligence. However, the void created by the abandonment of the Galtonian tradition did not last long. In Europe, Alfred Binet (see below for biographical information) introduced his scale of intelligence in 1905 and shortly thereafter H.H. Goddard imported it to the United States. Binet developed his tests in early 1900s to help identify children in the Paris school system who were unlikely to profit from ordinary instruction. Binet’s measures of intelligence focused on higher psychological processes rather than the elementary sensory processes such as reaction time. Binet developed his 1905 scales in collaboration with Theodore Simon. The character of the 1905 scales owed much to a prior test developed by Dr. Blin (1902) and his pupil M. Damaye, who attempted to improve the diagnosis of mental retardation by using a battery of assessments (Gregory, 1992). Binet criticized the scales for being too subjective and for having items reflecting formal education; however, he was much impressed with the idea of using a battery of tests, a feature which he adopted in his 1905 scales (Gregory, 1992).

===Heredity, Historiometry and Eugenics===

====Galton to Ceci: Concerning The Reductionist View of Intelligence====

It is with Galton (1892) that the reductionist conception of intelligence lies. His hypothesis was that eminence in the arts, sciences, letters, and law had its roots in the hereditary transmission of microlevel sensory and perceptual processes. He thought that differences in general intelligence were manifested in individual differences in the speed and accuracy of these sensory and perceptual processes.

Even though much of Galton’s own data failed to support his hypothesis, his idea slowly gained momentum and appeared to be borne out by research in the 20th Century.  The late 1970s and early 1980s saw the development of improved batteries of microlevel tasks. These were superior to those of the earlier researchers because they had better psychometric properties and were explicitly focused on theoretically important constructs that were cognitive in nature rather than on constructs that were unrelated to intellectual ability (e.g., simple motor speed).

From this late 20th century work the link between microlevel measures and macrolevel abilities seemed clear (see, for example, Eysenck, 1982, and Jensen, 1982), suggesting that, essentially, individuals inherit a central nervous system (CNS) of determinate efficiency. This efficiency enables the individual to more or less effectively glean information from the environment. Thus, individual differences at this microlevel were thought to lead to individual differences on macrolevel measures, such as IQ test performance, school performance, and vocational outcomes. 

But others have rejected this reductionist view first propounded by Galton.  As one, relatively recent example, the arguments put forward by Ceci (1990) based on his own experimental research are briefly considered here.  The first of these is that microlevel measures are not impervious to environmental differentiation. Ceci used an encoding task to demonstrate this. Subjects were presented with a number for a brief duration, which was then followed by an unfilled inter-stimulus interval. A pattern mask was then imposed where the number had appeared. While all subjects recognized the number, with a mask individual differences emerged in the time taken to detect the number.  According to Ceci, although all subjects were likely to be equally familiar with the number, they differed in the degree of elaboration with which they represented the number in their memory. By elaboration he meant, for example, that 49 can be represented as simply an odd number, or more elaborately by its factors, its roots, and other associations. Ceci found that the greater the elaboration, the faster the recognition, suggesting that a microlevel task like encoding is not merely a straightforward measure of CNS efficiency; clearly individual differences in knowledge-bases are involved. 

A second argument against Galtonian reductionism advanced by Ceci (1990) was based on the finding that inter-correlation patterns between microlevel tasks could not be satisfactorily accounted for by reference to a singular resource pool (that is, CNS efficiency). Ceci found that correlations were actually higher between conceptually dissimilar mircolevel tasks (e.g., encoding shapes and encoding auditory words) than they were between similar microlevel tasks (e.g., auditory encoding of pitch and auditory encoding of duration). Such findings undermined the assertion that microlevel measures directly reflected some fundamental physiological resource; if they did, Ceci argued, one would have expected there to be a higher correlation between similar mircolevel tasks.      
 
Ceci (1990) also argued that the existing genetic evidence was ambiguous regarding what precisely is being transmitted. Ceci observed that inherited dispositions, which are not themselves considered evidence of intellectual capacity, could affect the cognitive abilities of an individual. The example he gives is temperament. Ceci’s point was that the path from genetics to IQ is not one that necessarily has much to do with biology but is instead the manner in which we navigate our social environment; this point is, of course, relevant when one reviews Galton’s own studies of eminence and accomplishment with his rather select samples.   

Building on this argument, Ceci (1990) goes on to critique the research concerning real world attainment.  In particular, he addresses Terman’s work (1925; Terman &amp; Oden, 1959) on the predictive validity of IQ. The general interpretation of Terman’s data on the outcomes of high IQ children was that IQ was a predictor of real world success. Ceci focused on earnings in his own re-analysis of Terman’s data, and reported that, in fact, there was no relationship between IQ and earnings across the whole IQ range once social variables were adequately controlled for.  

In essence, Ceci’s contribution to the debate that Galton began was that the causal pathways from performance on microlevel tasks to macrolevel indices of achievement are moderated by aspects of the individual’s ecology rather than being determined directly by a basic, innate intelligence as Galtonian thought maintained.

====Wilhelm Wundt (1832-1920)====
Years before [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wundt Wundt] started the first psychological laboratory in 1879, he started measuring mental processes in 1862 when he experimented with his thought meter (Gregory, 2007).  This instrument was a calibrated pendulum with needles protruding from each side.  The pendulum would swing back and forth, striking bells with the needles.  The observer’s task was to take note of the position of the pendulum when the bells sounded.  Wundt thought that the difference between the observed pendulum position and the actual position would provide a means of determining the speediness of thought of the observer, an attribute he thought that is different from one person to another.  The use of an empirical analysis to explain individual differences was the most significant contribution Wundt made to modern psychological testing (Gregory, 2007).

====Sir Francis Galton (1822-1911)====
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Galton Galton] was originally trained in medicine in London, Cambridge and Birmingham until inheriting a considerable fortune at the age of twenty-two.  Then, he abandoned his medical studies and spent several years traveling.  In two years in southwest African he made important contributions to geography.   He was the first to publish weather maps and to describe the anticyclone as a weather system.  Besides his important influence in eugenics and heredity, as reflected by his work ''Hereditary Genius'' (1869) and ''Inquiries into Human Faculty and Its Development'' (1883), Galton also studied a wide variety of subjects.  For example, he developed a method of composite photography for summarizing portraits and conducted research that eventually led to the use of fingerprints as a means of identification.  Galton also pioneered in the study of resemblance in physical and mental characteristics in successive generations, and used twins to investigate the relative effects of nurture and nature.  He also recognized the need for a method to describe the relationship of two variables, hence developing the product-moment formula for linear correlation, which was considered as his most outstanding contribution to the area of test theory (DuBois, 1970).   

Galton’s fascination with quantification and individual differences led him to invent methods for measuring human traits.  When his cousin, Charles Darwin, proposed his theory of natural selection – that nature naturally selects human traits that are most successful – Galton followed by suggesting that human traits could be measured and ranked for the purpose of breeding superior people.  His interest in promoting human betterment led him to found the eugenics movement (Myers, 1998).  

:“I have no patience with the hypothesis occasionally expressed and often implied, especially in tales written to teach children to be good, that babies are born pretty much alike, and that the sole agencies in treating differences between boy and boy, and man and man, are steady application and moral effort.  It is in the most unqualified manner that I object to pretensions of natural equality” (Galton, 1892 in Myers, 1998).

Over the next few years, Galton attempted to measure innate mental capacity in an effort to quantify human superiority.  In his book, ''Hereditary Genius'' (1869), he experimented with the idea of measuring one’s head size to assess intelligence and, in later years he developed a number of diverse measures of what he believed were the “biological underpinnings of genius” (Myers, 1998, p. 334).  

Galton borrowed the psychophysical procedures practiced by Wundt and adapted them into a series of simple sensorimotor measures.   Because of his efforts in devising practicable measures of individual differences, Galton is often regarded as the &quot;father of mental testing&quot; (Goodenough, 1949, as cited in Gregory, 2007).  In 1884, he set up a psychometric laboratory in London at the International Health Exhibition, where for a small fee a person could have a series of measurements taken and recorded, including height, weight, head length, head breadth and arm span (DuBois, 1970; Gregory, 2007).  Although Galton’s simplistic attempts to assess intellect with measures of reaction time and sensory discrimination proved futile, he pioneered in the development of objective tests to investigate psychological problems to obtain meaningful scores through standardized procedures (DuBois, 1970; Gregory, 2007).

====James McKeen Cattell (1860-1944)====
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Cattell Cattell] was the American psychologist who introduced the Galton tradition in testing to the US and was responsible for many early developments in mental measurements (DuBois, 1970; Gregory, 2007).  From 1880 to 1882, he studied under Wundt in his psychological laboratory, where he did a series of Reaction Time (RT) studies.  He noticed that he and another colleague had small but consistent differences in RT and proposed to Wundt that such individual differences ought to be studied systematically.  However, he received no support from Wundt to continue research in this area.  

Cattell also worked for Galton in his Anthropometric Laboratory in 1888, where he received enthusiastic support for his research on individual differences.  After that, he lectured and collected psychological test data at Cambridge and in the U.S.  Cattell was also the first person to receive the title “Professor of Psychology” in the U.S. (DuBois, 1970).  
Cattell (1890; as cited in DuBois, 1970) invented the term &quot;mental test&quot; in his famous paper entitled “Mental Tests and Measurements”, which described his research programming detailing ten mental tests he proposed for use with the general public.  These tests were adapted from Galton’s battery of testing, which include items like strength of hand squeeze, degree of pressure to cause pain, time for naming colors and weight differentiation. 

In 1891, Cattell accepted a position at Columbia University, where he founded the Psychological Laboratory, and soon he inaugurated a battery of physical and mental tests which were given to approximately 50 freshmen in the college each year.  During his professorship, he supervised many students who turned out to be very influential in psychology, such as E.L. Thorndike (author of famous Introduction to the Theory of Mental and Social Measurement), R.S. Woodworth (creator of the first personality test), E.K. Strong (creator of the Strong Vocational Interest Blank) and Clark Wissler.  Wissler (1901; as cited in Gregory, 2007) himself was a great influence on the early history of psychological testing, as he demonstrated that mental scores do not correlate with academic achievement, which eventually led to the abandonment of the use of RT and sensory discrimination as measures of intelligence (Gregory, 2007).

===Intelligence Testing===
====Alfred Binet (1857-1911)====

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Binet Alfred Binet] was born in Nice on July 11, 1857.  He was a very bright child and his mother decided to send him off to Paris to study at the age of 12.  Although he was most well known for inventing the first modern intelligence test, the Metric Intelligence Scale, he had also studied in many areas such as perception, hallucinations, language and anatomy.  

Binet began his career in medicine and later switched to psychology.  At the Salpetriere Hospital, Binet met the neurologist J. M. Charcot (1825-1893); Charcot later became his mentor.  Binet and his colleague Charles Fere published four studies that were thought to demonstrate how the polarity of a magnet could induce complete mood changes in a single hypnotized subject, but the results were met with harsh criticism.  Later, Binet published a recantation of the findings and realized the importance of using scientific experimental procedures.  

Learning from the lesson, Binet’s significant contribution to education psychology was the use of scientific methods, which is to experiment and observe: &quot;a collaboration between theory and experimentation&quot; (Binet &amp; Simon, 1908, p. 1).  The study of mental fatigue, which referred to whether the workload imposed on children in school was too heavy and exhausting, was an illustration of an experimental investigation by Binet and his colleagues (1898).  The psychological effects of mental fatigue were explored in two setting – the laboratory and the classroom.  Binet considered it important to begin experiments in the laboratory because methodological problems could be solved and the important research questions could be established in this setting.  Then, experiments would be carried out in real-life settings so that more efficient, effective and elaborate plans could be devised and hypotheses tested.  Binet asserted that all experimental research should follow four steps: hypothesis, collection of facts, interpretation of data, and replication.  His insistence on using scientifically sound methodology prompted him to develop new statistical tools and to make use of control groups, providing a model experiemental approach for later psychologists to follow.  However, it is worth noting that many of Binet's observations, which formed the basis of much of his theoretical work on cognitive development, were of his own children!  Like Piget after him, Binet gained considerable insight into the developmental processes that interested him through this qualitative aspect of his research.   

In 1904, Binet was appointed by the Minister of Public Education in France to a commission charged with devising a measure that could identify retarded school children.  With the help of his doctoral student, Theodore Simon, Binet created the Metric Intelligence Scale.  In this respect, Binet pioneered the notion of a general intelligence when the prevailing view was of quite distinct mental functions.  The Scale was actually comprised of 30 separate tests (some developed by Binet, others based on existing cognitive tests), assessing a wide range of abilities from psychomotor coordination to complex mental reasoning. Setting the trend for later intelligence test developers, Binet's tests increased in difficulty and provided a means to determine normal performance between children according to their chronological age as well as whether or not they were normal or abnormal.  Children identified with learning impairments, based on their performance of the scale, were selected and put into special education class.  Of note, however, was Binet's insistence that before these special education classes were made available to all children with abnormality, their impact must be assessed and verified experimentally.

Binet’s conception of abnormality was quite different from the widespread views of the time (which essentially held the abnormal child to be one whose development has slowed down or stopped).  He believed that abnormality was actually a different developmental pattern, in which the abnormal child shares some aspects with normal children while other aspects differ.  Most importantly, this conceptualization of abnormality meant that it could be addressed or overcome by special education designed to improve a child's cognitive functioning through specific instruction and practice.  He also emphasized that the scale should only be used as an indication of the child’s cognitive level at the time of administration, suggesting that this level could change over time (and as a consequence of remediation and practice).  He clearly warned against construing the child's performance on his IQ test as a fixed measure of the child's intelligence.  

To identify children eligible for special education, Binet also considered the schoolteacher’s impression of &quot;possibly retarded&quot; pupils based on their performance on studies.  In effect, Binet was seeking to establish concurrent validity for his test by corroborating the results of its administration with the impressions of the child's school teacher.  To Binet's credit, he insisted that these impressions of teachers were not known to his test administrators prior to testing.  This served to control for any possible confirmation bias.  Binet made it clear that his scale was just one assessment tool to identify retarded children and the observation of the child’s usual performance was also critical in making decisions about identification and placement.    

Although Binet’s aim was to detect and assist, and clearly not to segregate, retarded or abnormal children, his test was put to use for precisely the purpose he had so carefully and explicitly counselled against when Lewis Terman introduced it in the US in 1916.  Terman stressed the importance of hereditary factors in explaining IQ performance.  Contrary to Binet, he believed that the reason for placing children with low IQ scores in special classes was that there was no hope of them being able to benefit from normal schooling.  Fortunately Terman’s views are certainly not representative of contemporary policy and practice in the field of School Psychology in North America and Europe.  Indeed, it is interesting to note in reading Binet’s work on assessment procedures that many of his concerns and recommendations of a century ago are explicitly emphasized in the authoritative texts used today concerning the testing of children (Sattler, 2001; Sattler &amp; Hoge, 2006).   

Binet’s views on learning also made an impact in the field of psychology. He realised the importance of studying individual differences both between children of different ages and also between children of the same age in order to identify the strengths and weaknesses of different learners.  As such, he emphasized the need to assess a broad range of skills to identify children’s potential and so plan and provide optimal education corresponding to their abilities. Binet believed that any child could learn providing they experience optimal conditions for this learning.  One crucial condition was that the level of difficulty in the material or concepts taught had to be carefully adjusted for the child so that its comprehension and mastery did not lie completely beyond the child's capacity. This idea bares striking similarity with Vygotsky's &quot;zone of proximal development&quot;. Also, Binet believed that learning came with practice and that students should not only be lectured but also given opportunities to practice their knowledge. Moreover, Binet contended that a multitude of factors must be taken into account when studying the complexities of human functioning. For example, based on his belief that cognitive functioning cannot be separated from emotional functioning, he examined the relation between eating habits and intellectual achievement.

====Henry H. Goddard (1866-1957)====

In 1906, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Goddard Henry H. Goddard] was hired by the Vineland training School in New Jersey to conduct research on the classification and education of “feeble-minded” children. Soon, he realized that a diagnostic instrument would be necessary and was amazed to learn about the 1908 Binet-Simon scale. He quickly set about translating the scale, making minor changes so that it would be applicable to American children (Gregory, 2007).  

Goddard was a strong advocate of eugenics, engaging in the use of intelligence testing to demonstrate that a large number of immigrants entering the US were mentally retarded (Gregory, 2007). He also tested many normal children with his translation of the Binet-Simon scales, and supported the viewpoint that children identified as mentally deficient should be segregated so that they would be prevented from “contaminating society” (1911; as cited in Gregory, 2007).  He also gained a reputation as one of the leading experts on the use of intelligence tests to identify persons with impaired intellect.

====Lewis M. Terman (1877-1956) - Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale====

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Terman Lewis Terman] was born the eleventh of fourteen children on an Indiana farm in 1877 (Chapman, 1988). He quickly became and avid reader, excelled in school, and began to prepare for a career in teaching at the age of fifteen.  He found an interest in psychology from reading famous works such as Darwin’s On the Origin of Species and William James’s Principles of Psychology (Chapman, 1988). His interest in mental testing originated in the years at Clark University where he did his Ph.D. In his doctoral dissertation entitled “Genius and Stupidity”, he derived a variety of tests, including measures of inventiveness and imagination, logical processes, mathematical ability and language, to seven “bright” and seven “stupid” boys selected as extreme cases from approximately 500 children (DuBois, 1970; Chapman, 1988). He concluded that the nature of intelligence could best be explained through the use of mental tests by which an individual’s performance could be quantified and compared to the normal performance of the population at large (Chapman, 1988).   

Terman discontinued his research of the measurement of intelligence until his appointment to the Department of Education in the Standford University in 1910, where he began a revision of Binet’s intelligence scale for use in America (DuBois, 1970; Chapman, 1988). Using the 1911 Binet-Simon scale as the source, Terman produced the Stanford-Binet in 1916, which became the standard of intelligence testing for decades (DuBois,1970; Gregory, 2007), and the work he was best known for.  

The new scale was based on comprehensive and systematic research (DuBois, 1970; Chapman, 1988). The Binet material and forty additional tests were prepared for tryout with 905 normal children between the ages of 5 and 14, all within two months of a birthday. Also, results of testing some 1400 other cases, including 200 defective and superior children and 400 adults, were considered in making the revision.  A considerable amount of time was spent to train the examiners and all records were scored by Terman himself to ensure uniformity.  

The new Standford-Binet consisted of 90 items and it was suitable for those with mental retardation, children, and both normal and superior adults (DuBois, 1970; Gregory, 2007). It had clear and well-organized instructions for administration and scoring.  One of the major additions that Terman made to the test was the introduction of the concept of ''mental quotient'' (originally propsed by Loius William Stern), whereby which an individual's mental age is divided by their chronological age, to express test results.  Terman renamed this ratio ''intelligence quotient (IQ),'' a term that continues to be widely used today (Sattler, 2001).

====David Wechsler (1896 – 1981) – Wechsler-Bellevue Intelligence Scale====

Major improvements in the measurement of intelligence were made by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Wechsler David Wechsler], who published the Wechsler-Bellevue Intelligence Scale in 1939 (DuBois, 1970).  he scale composed of subscales so that a give type of task or item was administered only once to the subject.  The IQ became a standard score with a mean of 100 at each age level and a standard deviation so that 50 percent of the IQs were between 90 and 110. The instrument also yielded a verbal IQ, a performance IQ and a total IQ (DuBois, 1970; Gregory, 2007). Modifications were made so that the scale was more suitable for adults than earlier scales had been, which was known as the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (DuBois, 1970). A version for children, the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, was developed in 1949 (Gregory, 2007).

====Early Group Tests====

With the success of the Binet scale, measurement of mental abilities by a device that could be administered simultaneously to large numbers of subjects was a logical next step (DuBois, 1970).  Among the first to develop group tests was Pyle, who in 1913 published schoolchildren age norms for a battery consisting of measures such as memory span, digit-symbol substitution, and oral word association (Gregory, 2007), which was intended to be used diagnostically (DuBois, 1970).  

In 1917, Pintner modified Pyle’s approach so as to measure general intelligence (DuBois, 1970).  Using the five tests from Pyle that seemed to have the highest correlations with general intelligence, he added a timed cancellation test in which the child crossed out the letter a wherever it appeared in a body of text (DuBois, 1970; Gregory, 2007).  

The pace of developments in group testing picked up dramatically as the US entered World War I in 1917 (Gregory, 2007).  Robert M. Yerkes was the president of the American Psychological Association at that time and he immediately took energetic steps to discover and implement ways in which psychology could be of service in the national effort (DuBois, 1970).  He assembled the committee on the examination of recruits in May 1917 and it was decided that a group intelligence test should be administered to all recruits for the purposes of classification and assignment (DuBois, 1970; Gregory, 2007).  Some criteria for the new group test include: adaptability for group use, correlation with valid intelligence measures, measurement of a wide range of ability, and objectivity of scoring and economy of time (DuBois, 1970).  

Two group tests emerged from this effort: the Army Alpha and the Army Beta (Gregory, 2007).  The Alpha consisted of eight verbally loaded tests for average and high-functioning recruits.  The eight tests were (1) following oral directions, (2), arithmetical reasoning, (3) practical judgment, (4) synonym-antonym pairs, (5) disarranged sentences, (6) number series completion, (7) analogies, and (8) information.  

The Beta was a nonverbal group test designed for use with illiterates and recruits whose first language was not English.  It consisted of various visual-perceptual and motor tests such as tracing a path through mazes and visualizing the correct number of blocks depicted in a three-dimensional drawing (Gregory, 2007).  

The Army testing program was the first large-scale use of intelligence tests.  Approximately 1.75 million recruits were examined, of which at least 1.25 million were tested with one of the five forms of the Army Alpha (DuBois, 1970).  It received good acceptance by the military establishment, which used the results in making important personnel decisions.

===Personality Testing===

====Some Introductory Comments on General Approaches to Personality Assessment====

Although there is marked variation in the ways lay people and even psychologists define it, personality can be taken to refer to the characteristic patterns of thinking, feeling, and behaving that reflect a person’s individual style and influence the way the person interacts with his or her environment.  A number of different theories concerning personality have been expounded and closely associated with these are contrasting approaches to personality assessment.  Of particular note given their longstanding influence on thinking and assessment practices in the field are trait theory and psychoanalytic theory and their associated assessment procedures.   

Trait theorists hold that there are distinct categories or types of personality.  An individual is categorized according to their position on two or more continuous dimensions, which are usually measured using rating scales that can be summed and combined in pre-specified manner to generate a constellation of higher order personality traits.  Trait theorists have sought to derive an optimal set of these traits so that the underlying constructs make theoretical sense and receive empirical support while also sufficiently accounting for the diversity that characterizes human personality.  Questionnaire format personality inventories have been developed on which respondents rate their thoughts, feelings, or reactions to the scenarios described.  Construction of these tests and item inclusion has been based on theory (the rational method) or through the use of statistical procedures such as factor analysis (the criterion or empirical method). 

Significant contributions to the trait theory of personality during the 20th Century include the work of McDougall (1932), Thurstone (1934), Gordon Allport (1937, 1961), Raymond Catell (1943, 1947), Hans Eysenck (1970), and John Digman (1963, 1972).  Currently, the five-factor model of personality (comprised of Neuroticism [maladjustment], Extraversion, Openness to Experience, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness) enjoys wide acceptance in the field and a firm empirical basis (Costa &amp; McCrae, 1985, 1989, 1992).  Examples of contemporary inventories representing this approach include the NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI-R: Costa &amp; McCrae, 1992) and, in clinical contexts, the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI-2: Butcher &amp; Megargee, 1989) (see below).

The psychoanalytic view of personality implicates unconscious motivations as the underlying cause of individuals’ behaviors across situations (as well as of their dreams and slips of the tongue).  Freud (1933, 1991) viewed personality as being composed of the id, the ego, and the superego, which he argued were often in conflict because of the differing principles according to which each operates.  The Pleasure Principle, always driving toward instant gratification of biological impulses, controls the id.  In contrast, the ego operates on the Reality Principle, tempering the impulses of the id by delaying gratification until socially acceptable means of securing it are possible.  The superego represents the individual’s conscience, imposing moral standards against which the individual plans and judges his thoughts, feelings, and behavior.  In this theory it is the ego that balances the influences and tension between the other two components in the well-integrated personality.

In contrast to the structured and standardized assessment procedures developed and used by trait theorists, psychoanalytically oriented personality assessors use projective tests.  In these tests the stimuli are deliberately ambiguous and the individual is thought to reveal unconscious motives and desires by projecting his or her personality onto the stimuli.  Examples of these projective tests include the Rorschach Test (see below) and the Thematic Apperception Test.  Administration of these tests involves considerable judgment and interpretation on the part of the assessor.

====Robert S. Woodworth (1869-1962) – Personal Data Sheet====

Although Galton had devised an assessment method to investigate imagery, it was not until WWI that [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Sessions_Woodworth R.S. Woodworth] applied the technique to develop an instrument to detect Army recruits for their susceptibility to emotional stability (DuBois, 1970; Gregory, 2007).  In doing so, he developed the Personal Data Sheet in 1919, which was the first personality test in history.  

The Personal Data Sheet consisted of 116 questions that required the subject to answer Yes or No.  The questions involved fairly serious symptomatology.  Items that were found to differentiate between normal and abnormal subjects were the following:  
*Do you feel sad or low-spirited most of the time? 
*Are you ever bothered with feeling that people are reading your thoughts?  

In 1919, Woodworth reported that of the 100 symptoms inquired about, the average college student reported about 10 and the typical hysteric reported over 40 (DuBois, 1970).

====Hermann Rorschach (1884 – 1922) – Rorschach Inkblot Test====

Hermann Rorschach was born in Zurich on November 8, 1884.  He spent his youth in Schaffhausen and studied medicine mostly in Zurich.  He worked as a resident physician in the asylums of several Swiss towns, and for seven months in 1914 he worked at a sanatorium in Moscow.  Hermann was the associate director of the asylum when he died prematurely on April 2, 1922 at the age of 37.  Ten months prior to his death, in June 1921, Rorschach published Psychodianostics, the monograph of the famous Inkblot Test, which became a milestone in the history of projective testing (Ellenberger, 1993; Gregory, 2007).  The Rorschach Inkblot test consisted of 10 inkblots, which was formed by dribbling ink on a piece of paper and folding the paper in half, producing relatively symmetrical designs (Gregory, 2007).  Five of the inkblots are black or shades of gray, while five contain color.  As Rorschach was more interested in exploring subject’s modality of perception than the content of the associations invoked, he focused on how the subject responded, such as their reaction time, whether the form is conceived in parts or in its entirety, and how did the form, movement and color influence the subject’s appreciation of the blot (DuBois, 1970).  

To one’s amazement, Hermann’s nickname as a secondary school student was “Klex”, a word meaning “inkblot”, which coincides with the test for which he is renowned for (Ellenberger, 1993).  Klecksography was a popular game among Swiss children that consists of making inkblots on a piece of paper and folding it to construct forms of an object, such as a bird or a butterfly.   

One incident that stimulated Rorschach’s interest in studying human unconscious was a dream that he had when he was a medical student (Ellenberger, 1993).  He dreamt that his own brain was being cut into slices exactly as he had seen it done during the autopsy, and he felt these slices falling forward, one after the other, across his forehead.  Two questions immediate arose in his mind: How can someone experience in a dream perceptions that are physiologically impossible?  And how could a succession of optic images be translated into and re-experienced as a succession of kinesthetic images?  These questions proved to be the guiding force of Rorschach’s (1964) Psychodiagnostics, in which he concluded: 
The apparatus with which the individual is endowed for assimilating experiences is much broader, more extensive instrument than that which he uses in daily life. A person has a number of registers which enable him to experience, but he uses only a few in the ordinary run of living. 

A major influence in Rorschach’s Inkblot Test was Jung’s Word Association Test, the first experimental method applied to dynamic psychiatry (Ellenberger, 1993).  Using this test, Jung detected mental complexes and isolated a special test syndrome for every disorder.  He classified subjects into introverts and extroverts by distinguishing their semantic and verbal associations.  This formal classification of answers is considered as Jung’s most original contribution, which greatly influenced the detail and framework of Rorschach’s test (Ellenberger, 1993).  For example, in Psychodiagnostics, Rorschach (1964) presented observations of 405 subjects and classified their responses by types such as normal, feebleminded, epileptics and schizophrenics, a structure similar to Jung’s classification.  Although using it in an entirely different fashion, Rorschach also borrowed the word introversion from Jung (Rorschach, 1964).  

Another thrust in the development of the Inkblot Test was Rorschach’s encounter of S. Hen’s dissertation entitled “Testing the Imagination of School Children, Adults, and Mental Patients by Means of Formless Blots” published in 1917.  Hens employed eight inkblots to evaluate the content of interpretation of a thousand children, a hundred normal adults, and a hundred psychotics (Rorschach, 1964; Ellenberger, 1993).  At the end of the study, Hens offered a few suggestions for future direction of research.  He noted that some subjects tended to interpret the whole picture while others only in parts, which prompted him to speculate whether this pattern is meaningful.  He also noticed that all of his eight cards were in black and white colors, which led him to consider whether colored cards would elicit differential responses.  Finally, Hens wondered about the possibility of using the inkblots test to diagnose psychoses.  All these questions were attempted by Rorschach (1964) in Psychodiagnostics, with the focus of investigating the pattern of perceptive process.

==== Myers-Briggs, Keirsey's Temperments, and True Colours ====
Myers-Briggs Personality Tests, is influenced by the work of Carl Jung and is made up of 16 distinct personality types. These personality types are derived from four main variables:
* Intorvert/extrovert (I/E)
* Sensor/ Intuitive (S/N)
* Feeling/Thinking (F/T)
* Judger/Perceiver (J/P)
From this combination of opposite tendencies, the assumption is that most people tend towards one more than the other. For example, a person may find that they lean more towards an extroverted personality type versus an introverted personality type. Furthermore, derived from these main variables are the 16 personality types, which are expressed in four letters (i.e. INFJ or ENFP). Most often when a person is administered this test they will find that they can see a little bit of them self in more than one personality type. As such, the administrator of the test will usually comment that it is a test of ones most frequent preference or dominant tendency as apposed to a rigid diagnosis. 

David Keirsey, a renowned psychologist born in Oklahoma in 1921, modified the test by organising the 16 personality types into four main temperaments. These temperaments he called Guardians, Artisans, Idealists, and Rationals.

The True Colours Test, which is another personality test, is also related to the Myers-Briggs and Keirsey's temperaments. Don Lowry, founded True Colours in 1978 after becoming interested in the work of Keirsey, studying Katerine Briggs, Isable Myers, and Carl Jung. He took Keirsey's four main personality types and then created a test for children and adults that would be easy, fun and convinient to use. Each colour of the test is used to characterize a certain type of person and there are also comparisons of compatibility and non-compatibility across colours. An individual taking this test can then rank, through a series of tests, the order of these colours in their personality (from most prevalent to least). This test has been used in classrooms, corporate offices, apprenticeship programs, and even in career development. It is very useful for a person to understand their strengths, tendencies, attitudes, and the perseption others may have of them.

====Starke R. Hathaway (1903-1984) and J. C. McKinley (1891-1950) - Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI)====

Using Woodworth’s procedure of writing items that seemed to have clinical significance and establishing validity by contrasting the responses of normal and abnormal subjects, S. R. Hathaway and J. C. McKinley published the MMPI in 1943 (DuBois, 1970; Gregory, 2007).  They also used the model of the Strong Vocational Interest Blank in that a large item pool was created with the idea that only a relatively small subset would be included in any one key or scale (DuBois, 1970).  The MMPI also introduced the use of validity scales to determine fake bad, fake good and random response patterns (DuBois, 1970; Gregory, 2007).  

The MMPI consisted of 566 true-false items designed to diagnosis psychiatric symptoms (Gregory, 2007).  These items were selected from more than 1000 items covering health conditions, habits, personal and social attitudes, and psychiatric symptoms, and were administered both to normal subjects and to individuals exhibiting a defined pathological condition (DuBois, 1970).  Items showing the greatest differentiation were selected for the scale, which was then cross-validated on new groups of cases (DuBois, 1970; Gregory, 2007).

====Personality Testing with Criminals in the 20th Century: The Contributions of Eysenck and Hare====

That criminals are individuals who are in some way different from other members of society has been a pervasive view for centuries and remains so today among many.  The contribution of psychology has included the formulation of personality theories explaining criminality as the product of a certain personality type.  As one area in the psychology of individual differences research, efforts to measure the personality of criminals can be likened to Galton’s and Terman’s efforts to discriminate between the eminent or intelligent and the weak-minded, with the social engineering implications clear in both areas of testing.  Within the broader framework of a multidisciplinary approach, personality theories represent a middle range explanation, that is, below macro-theories of social structure and organisation and above micro-theories that are based on research into the biological make-up of individuals. 

The sociologist Durkheim (1895, 1938) posited that crime was in fact a normal social phenomenon and not a pathological element within society.  In contrast, Eysenck (1964, 1970, 1977) advanced the theory that criminals were psychologically different from others and his work can be seen to have ushered in a new era of psychology inquiry into the question.  Using the concept of personality, Eysenck sought to identify a subset of ‘aberrant’ people, criminals, different from the larger ‘normal’ whole, the general population.  While this conception of crime as pathology, in essence the Positive School of Criminology, was not new, Eysenck’s introduction of psychometric tests to illustrate between-group differences was. 

Adapting his general theory of personality, in which individuals could be categorized according to behavioral tendencies, Eysenck hypothesised that criminals would have a distinct personality type, measurable using his inventories (Maudsley Personality Inventory, MPI; Eysenck Personality Inventory, EPI, see Eysenck, 1960, and Eysenck &amp; Eysenck, 1964). Basically, individuals could be located on two spectrums, extroversion/introversion and neuroticism, which are independent and represent overall personality dimensions.  Extroversion is characterised by impulsiveness, sociability and generally outgoing behavior while introversion is typically demonstrated by shyness, control, withdrawal and inversion.  According to Eysenck, the criminal would be high in extroversion and high in neurotism, and prone to criminal behavior because of this personality type.  Initial data with offender populations were generally consistent with this (Eysenck, 1964).  Other evidence consistent with Eysenck’s theory came from twin and adoption studies (Eysenck, 1977; Mednick, Gabrielle, &amp; Hutchings, 1984).    

However, Eysenck’s work on personality testing with criminals has been subject to a number of criticisms.  One concern was that his measures were self-report questionnaires; the degree of transparency in the material left them susceptible to response biases.  While the incorporation of the L (Lie) scale in 1964 was an attempt to counter this, other researchers found that response profiles could be manipulated without elevating scores on this scale (see Farrington, Biron, &amp; LeBlanc, 1982). Another problem with Eysenck’s personality measures was the finding that the dimensions correlated with one another to varying degrees (Eysenck &amp; Eysenck, 1970; Eysenck &amp; Eysenck, 1976). Clearly personality dimensions should be homogeneous and independent of each other if they are to be taken to be fundamental constructs.  

Of course, Eysenck’s personality inventories represented only one contribution to personality research among many.  Tennenbaum (1977) undertook a substantial review of the literature and found that 52 different tests had been used to investigate personality in criminals with little evidence of discriminative validity in general.  As such, it seemed necessary to begin to look for a more homogenous subset within the criminal population in order to better elucidate core personality traits with discriminative and predictive validity.  So Eysenck and Eysenck (1978) attempted to operationalize the concept of psychoticism, “… the psychotic is ‘mad’ in the sense that his cognitive processes are deranged… while the neurotic is usually in full possession of his mental faculties, but not in control of his emotions (p. 57).  Effectively Eysenck was modifying his personality theory by postulating a three dimensional personality breakdown, consisting of E, N and P dimensions, which predicted that psychopaths and criminals should have high scores on the E, N and P scales.  Hare (1982) found that P scores correlated with six of the 22 items on his Psychopathy Checklist (Hare 1980). However, he opined, “… high scores on the P scale may be more a reflection of criminal and antisocial tendencies and behavior than of the inferred psychological constructs (e.g. lack of empathy, guilt, remorse, concern for others etc.) that are essential for the diagnosis of psychopathy.” Similarly, diagnostic criteria for Antisocial Personality Disorder in the DSM (see most recently American Psychiatric Association, 2000) has also been widely criticised for merely providing a description of the habitual criminal.  

In contrast to the earlier attempts of Eysenck and others to measure criminal personality, a considerable body of empirical evidence has emerged over the past 25 years in support of the psychopathic personality as operationalized by Hare’s Psychopathy Checklist (1980, 1991, 2003), which Hare developed following the clinical observations and seminal theorizing of the psychiatrist Hervey Cleckley (1941).  Psychopathy is a complex personality disorder that has been defined by a constellation of interpersonal, affective and behavioral characteristics.  The PCL-R is a structured clinical assessment instrument developed to assess a range of emotional and interpersonal traits as well as socially deviant behaviors.  It is scored by a trained assessor on the basis of an individual interview and review of file materials.  Its reliability and validity are well established (Hare, 2003).  Of particular note, research shows that psychopathic traits, as assessed by the PCL-R, are associated with negative indices of treatment involvement among general correctional samples of offenders (e.g., Hare, Clark, Grann, &amp; Thornton, 2000; Hobson, Shine, &amp; Roberts, 2000; Ogloff, Wong, &amp; Greenwood, 1990).  Strong associations have also been reported between PCL-R scores and both general and violent recidivism among correctional and psychiatric populations (e.g., Hemphill Hare, &amp; Wong, 1998; Salekin, Rogers, &amp; Sewell, 1996).  

Although the etiology of the psychopathic personality remains poorly understood, a growing body of evidence (see Patrick, 2006) supports Hare’s (1993) postulation that ‘genetic factors contribute to the biological bases of brain function and to basic personality structure, which in turn influence the way the individual responds to, and interacts with, life experiences and the social environment” (p. 173).  Certainly, the theoretical and conceptual impact of the construct of the psychopathic personality has been considerable.  As a personality assessment tool, the PCL-R has been highly influential in both research and applied settings.  It stands as one of the key advances in the 20th century in personality research at the juncture with clinical and forensic psychology, comparing favourably with the endeavors of earlier thinkers and scientists from Eysenck all the way back though notables such as Cesare Lombroso (1835-1909) and Franz Joseph Gall (1758-1828) to Aristotle.

===Interest Inventories===
====Edward K. Strong (1884-1963) – The Strong Vocational Interest Blank====

Edward K. Strong, a psychologist whose professional endeavor was to measure vocational interests, devoted 36 years to the development of empirical keys for the modified instrument known as the Strong Vocational Interest Blank (SVIB) since its first publication in 1927 (DuBois, 1970; Gregory, 2007).  To do so, he used large and well-selected groups of respondents, studied the test’s reliability and validity, examined variation in vocational interest with time, developed manuals and devices to aid in the interpretation of results and made various improvements in the device and its scoring methods (DuBois, 1970).  Subjects taking the test could be scored on separate keys for several dozen occupations, providing a series of scores of great value in vocational guidance (Gregory, 2007).  The modern version, the Strong Interest Inventory, is still widely used by guidance counselors nowadays (Gregory, 2007).  A companion blank for women was introduced in 1933 (DuBois, 1970).

Huh?

At http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Main_Page search for &quot;fiction&quot; and see
http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=fiction&amp;go=Go
showing 458 results for &quot;fiction&quot; at Wikibooks.

But, I find no &quot;fiction&quot; page at Wikibooks: 
&quot;Warning: You are recreating a page that was previously deleted.&quot;.

Can someone explain?  You're joking, right?

What could &quot;wiki&quot; and &quot;books&quot; mean, after all?

'''From Google define:wiki'''

:- A website or similar online resource which allows users to add and edit content collectively.
:- A collection of websites of hypertext, each of them can be visited and edited by anyone. “Wiki wiki” means &quot;rapidly&quot; in the Hawaiian language.
:- online collaboration model and tool that allows any user to edit some content of webpages through a simple browser.
:- A wiki ... is a web application that allows users to add content, as on an Internet forum, but also allows anyone to edit the content. Wiki also refers to the collaborative software used to create such a website (see Wiki software).

'''From Google define:book'''

:- a written work or composition that has been published (printed on pages bound together); &quot;I am reading a good book on economics&quot;
:- physical objects consisting of a number of pages bound together; &quot;he used a large book as a doorstop&quot;
:- ledger: a record in which commercial accounts are recorded; &quot;they got a subpoena to examine our books&quot;
:- a major division of a long written composition; &quot;the book of Isaiah&quot;
:- script: a written version of a play or other dramatic composition; used in preparing for a performance
:- a collection of rules or prescribed standards on the basis of which decisions are made; &quot;they run things by the book around here&quot;

Yet the front page says &quot;wikibooks = TEXT books ONLY&quot;?!?  What could &quot;text&quot; or &quot;textbook&quot; mean, and why not have them in the name of the wiki after all if it's going to be limited to &quot;textbooks&quot;?

'''Google define:text'''

:- the words of something written; &quot;there were more than a thousand words of text&quot;; &quot;they handed out the printed text of the mayor's speech&quot;; &quot;he wants to reconstruct the original text&quot;

They are further defined by both the age of the person who is to study the text and the classification of the subject matter itself. Textbooks are published by specialty printers to serve every request for an understanding of every subject that can be taught. It is a big business that requires mass volume sales to make the publications profitable ...

Huh?  Misnomer?  Why not change the name of wikibooks to '''Wikiralph''' if the title is not going to describe and relate to the contents?  I call for moving the &quot;textbook&quot; contents of wikibooks to a new namespace or enhanced, smart categories under wikibooks, like wikibooks:textbooks as a subset to allow wikibooks to become the BOOK library it promises in it's title.

*Wikibooks:textbooks
*Wikibooks:fiction
*Wikibooks:nonfiction
*Wikibooks:nonfiction:more
*Wikibooks:nonfiction:more:and-so-on
*Wikibooks:unplublished manuscripts
*Wikibooks:...and on and on.

Book category wise, http://www.lib.upm.edu.my/clas.html has a nice short listing - only 84 book categories!  But, what was wrong with the 3 digits in the Dewey Decimal System?  See http://www.tnrdlib.bc.ca/dewey.html ... and some endless challenges or discussions at links like http://www.gslis.utexas.edu/%7Elandc/fulltext/LandC_33_2_Wiegand.pdf - nothing perfect, buy why not try?  Why not have such a bifurcated namespace scheme on wikibooks? We might as well get started now rather than wait for someone to create a separate Wikilibrary that includes periodicals, audio, video and so on!

I'm sure there are many, many schemes for organizing books by content.  Yeah, yeah, I know about http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Category:Main_page, but really, &quot;mobile phones&quot; is a category?  Are we idiots who've never been inside a real library?  It seems to me that the challenge is to proceed with both energies - contributing books and organizing them at the same time.  Waiting for one task to be complete or perfect before doing the other seems impractical.  I guess we need to do both at the same time - upload our books of any category while at the same time, moving them around the virtual shelves so they can be found by their content ... and title and author, of course.  We are expanding &quot;search&quot; to facilitate searching by the classical:
* author
* title
* subject
... right?  After all, these are the 3 card catalogs in our old-fashioned libraries, right? See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_catalog.  Let's get to work!  ;-)

PS - Doesn't anybody vet out the potential meanings of new words in the public lexicon before getting started and publishing new web pages and products?  The same shenanigans are happening with &quot;wikimedia&quot; versus &quot;mediawiki&quot; versus the &quot;foundation&quot; versus &quot;meta&quot; and other combinations of those words.  Which word represents a product and which represents the source identifier?  No one really  knows how to keep them straight!  Wasn't there an on-line questionnaire recently trying to vet out the meanings of the names, and all this years after the fact of introducing the names the public?

'''Diagonal lashing''' is a type of [[W:lashing|lashing]] used to bind [[W:spar|spar]]s or poles together, to prevent racking. It is usually applied to cross-bracing where the poles do not initially touch, but may by used on any poles that cross each other at a 45° to 90° angle. Large, semipermanent  structures may be built with a combination of [[W:square lashing|square lashing]], which is stronger, and diagonal lashing.

[[W:Bailing twine|Bailing twine]] has sufficient strength for some lashing applications but [[W:rope|rope]] should be used for joining larger poles and where supporting people sized weights.

Diagonal lashing steps (see image at right);
#Begin with a [[W:timber hitch|timber hitch]] around the juncture of the two poles.
#Make three turns in each direction - tightening steadily as you go.
#Make two frapping turns, tightening the joint as much a possible.
#To end, make two [[W:half hitch|half hitch]]es
#Cinch the half hitches into a [[W:clove hitch|clove hitch]]

A [[W:lashing stick|lashing stick]] can be used to safely tighten the joint.  Strength will be improved if the first turn is 90° to the timber hitch and if care is taken to lay the rope turns parallel with no crossings.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Square lashing===
[[Image:Lashing square.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Square Lashing]]

'''Square lashing''' is a type of [[W:lashing knot|lashing knot]] used to bind poles together. Large structures can be built with a combination of square and [[W:diagonal lashing|diagonal lashing]], with square lashing generally used on load bearing members and diagonal lashing usually applied to cross bracing. If any gap exists between the poles then diagonal lashing should be used.

Square lashing steps (see image at right);
#Begin with a [[W:timber hitch|timber hitch]] on the vertical pole beneath the horizontal pole and tuck the loose end under the wrapping.
#Wrap in a square fashion about three times around the poles.
#Wrap two or three times, pulling often to work the joint as tight as possible.
#Tie two [[W:half hitch|half hitch]]es around the horizontal pole
#Cinch the half hitches into a [[W:clove hitch|clove hitch]], an additional clove hitch may be added if desired.

When the turns are taken around the vertical pole they should be inside the previous turns. The ones around the cross pole should be on the outside of the previous turns. This makes sure that the turns remain parallel and hence the maximum contact between the rope and wood is maintained.

Strength is improved if care is taken to lay the rope wraps and fraps in parallel with a minimum of crossing.
 
An alternative method is known as the '''Japanese square lashing'''. The Japanese square lashing is similar to the standard square lashing in appearance, but in fact is much faster and easier to use. One drawback to consider is that it is difficult to estimate how much rope is needed, which can lead to needlessly long working ends.

#Begin by placing the middle of the rope under the bottom pole
#Lay both ends over the top pole, and cross under the bottom pole. Do this about three times. Take care to keep the wrappings as tight as possible.
#After the last wrap, cross the ropes again over the bottom pole and frap around the wrappings. Do this enough times (at least 3) to finish with a square knot.

A properly executed lashing is very strong and will last as long as the twine or rope maintains its integrity. A [[W:lashing|lashing stick]] can be used to safely tighten the joint.

      <comment>clean up, typos fixed: 80 Kg → 80 kg using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Also see [[W:Tent|Tent]] on Wikipedia

With the modern materials available these days, tent manufacturers have the ability to change types, styles and shapes of tents.

* The tent poles hold and keep the shape of the tent.
* Poles can be made to be dismantled so that they can be easily transported, are color-coded, and/or linked by chain or a cord, to make it easier to set up a tent.
* Very few guy ropes are needed to tie down the tent (and sometimes none).
* Exact placement of the guy ropes is unnecessary.

====Rigid Poles====

Many tents which use rigid steel poles are free-standing and do not require guy ropes, though they may require pegs around the bottom edge of the fabric. These tents are usually so heavy (25 to 80 kg) that it takes a rather strong wind to blow them away.

* Frame tents are double-skin tents. They have a living area and one or more cotton/nylon/polyester inner tents. The outer tent is draped over a free-standing steel frame, and may be made of canvas or polyester (the latter often has a hydrostatic head of 3000mm, i.e. three season camping). The living area is generally at least as large as the sleeping area, and there may be a specific section with window and extra air vents for use as a kitchen. The walls are nearly vertical and are typically about 150 to 180 cm high (5 ft to 6 ft). The center of the gently sloping roof is often 210 cm (7 ft) high or more and provides reasonable headroom throughout. The smaller 2-person models were less than 3 metres square (10 ft), but these have largely been replaced by dome or tunnel tents. The larger 8-person models may exceed 5 metres (16 ft) in length and/or width.

* Cabin tents are single-skin tents used mainly in the USA. They often have nylon walls, polyester roof, and a polyethylene floor, plus an awning at one or both ends. With a hydrostatic head of only 1000 mm, they may best be considered as summer tents. Removable internal dividers allow the cabin to be split into 'rooms'. Sizes may range from 13 ft by 8 ft (2 rooms) up to 25 ft by 10 ft (4 rooms), with wall and roof heights similar to those of frame tents. There are three separate pole units, with each unit consisting of two uprights and a connecting ridge. These pole units support the centre and ends of the roof, and are usually outside the tent.

====Flexible Poles====
Flexible poles used for tents in this section are typically between 3 and 6 metres long (10 and 20 feet) and are normally made of tubes of fibreglass with an external diameter less than 1 cm (1/3 inch). For ease of transportation, these poles are made in sections some 30 cm to 60 cm long (1 to 2 ft), with one end of each section having a socket into which the next section can fit. For ease of assembly, the sections for each pole are often connected by an internal cord running the entire length of the pole.

[[Image:Dome_tent.png|thumb|260px|This is a basic dome tent, shown without rain fly or stakes.]]

* ''Dome'' tents have a very simple structure and are available in a wide variety of sizes ranging from lightweight 2-person tents with limited headroom up to 6 or 9-person tents with headroom exceeding 180 cm (6 ft). These may be single wall, or single-wall with partial flysheet, or double wall.  Depending on the pole arrangement, some models pitch outer-tent first, while others pitch inner-tent first. The former helps keep the inner tent dry, but the latter is easier to pitch.

:The basic dome has a rectangular floor and two poles which cross at the peak; each pole runs in a smooth curve from one bottom corner, up to the peak, and then down to the diagonally opposite bottom corner. There are usually special fittings at each corner which fit into sockets at the ends of each pole - pole tension keeps everything in shape. The poles usually run outside the tent fabric, which is attached to the poles by sleeves. In some new models clips are also used. Dome tents do not require guy ropes and pegs for structural integrity, but must be pegged down in high winds. 

:The basic dome design has been modified extensively, producing tents with three poles, tents with irregularly-shaped bases, and other unusual types. A common variation is to add a third pole going from corner to corner on one side; this is angled away from the tent, and supports an extended flysheet or outer tent to give a porch/storage area.

[[Image:nammatjknoydart.jpg|thumb|250px|Tunnel tent]]

* ''Tunnel'' tents may offer more usable internal space than a dome tent with the same ground area, but almost always need guy ropes and pegs to stay upright. These are almost always double wall tents. Sizes range from 1-person tents with very limited headroom up to 8 or 10-person tents with headroom exceeding 180 cm (6 ft). Tunnel tents have a low end profile making them great for high wind situations.

:A basic tunnel tent uses three flexible poles, arranged as three parallel hoops, with tent fabric attached to form a tunnel. The most common designs have a sleeping area at one end and a porch/storage/living area at the other. Smaller designs may use only 2 poles and larger designs may use 4 poles; the latter may have a sleeping area at each end and a living area in the middle.

* ''Hybrid dome/tunnel'' tents are now common. One variation is to use a basic dome as the sleeping area; one or two hooped poles to one side are linked by a tunnel to the dome to provide a porch. Another variation is to use a large dome as the living area, with up to 4 tunnel extensions to provide sleeping areas.

* ''Geodesic'' tents are essentially dome tents with 2 or more extra poles which criss-cross the normal two poles to help support the basic shape and minimise the amount of unsupported fabric. This makes them more suitable for use in snowy conditions. To help withstand strong winds they are rarely more than 120 or 150 cm high (4 to 5 ft).

* ''Single-hoop'' tents use just one flexible pole and are often sold as light-weight 1 or 2-person tents. These are the modern equivalent of older style pup tents, and have the same feature of somewhat limited headroom. Different styles may have the pole going either along or across the tent.

====Older Tent Styles====

[[image:Boulanger_Gustave_Clarence_Rodolphe_C_Est_Un_Emir.jpg|250px|thumb|right|A tent from Gustave Boulanger's painting ''C'est Un Emir''. ]]

Most of these tent styles are no longer generally available. Most of these are single-skin designs, with optional fly sheets for the ridge tents.

All the tents listed here had a canvas fabric and used a substantial number of guy ropes (8 to 18). The guys had to be positioned and tensioned fairly precisely in order to pitch the tent correctly, so some training and experience were needed. This made these styles relatively unsuitable for casual or occasional campers. Pup tents might use wooden or metal poles, but all the other styles mentioned here used wooden poles.

* A ''pup tent'' is a small version of a ridge tent intended for 2 or 3 people. It usually has a rectangular floor of size ranging from 4 ft by 6 ft up to 6 ft by 8 ft, and ridge heights ranging from 3 ft up to 5 ft. The side walls are usually about 1 ft high. There are guy ropes for each pole, at each corner, and in the centre of each side, and these guy ropes help to maintain the required shape.  Earlier versions had a single upright pole at each end, while later versions often have two poles at each end, arranged rather like an 'A' shape, in order to make access easier. Some models have a horizontal ridge pole joining the tops of the end poles to support the centre of the tent.

* A ''ridge tent'' can sleep 5 to 8 people. They usually have a rectangular floor of size ranging from 8 ft by 10 ft up to 10 ft by 16 ft, and ridge heights around 6 ft to 7 ft. The side walls are usually about 3 ft high. They normally have a single upright pole at each end with the tops joined by a horizontal ridge pole. Longer models might have an additional upright pole in the centre to help support the ridge pole. They often have two guy ropes at each corner, and guy ropes every 2 ft along the sides. If strong winds are expected then two additional storm guy ropes are attached to the top of each pole.

* A ''square centre-pole tent'' was often used for family camping in the first half of the 20th century. Despite the use of 9 poles and 12 guy ropes, such a tent could be pitched by an (experienced) family of four in some 10 to 15 minutes. These tents had a square floor of size ranging from 8 by 8 ft up to 15 by 15 ft. There were poles about 5 ft high at each corner and in the middle of each side, and a 10 ft or 12 ft pole in the centre - the walls were vertical and the roof was pyramid-shaped, so there was plenty of headroom over most of the tent.

* A ''[[W:Sibley tent|Sibley tent]] (bell tent)'' had a circular floor plan some 10 ft to 15 ft across, a single central pole some 10 ft high, and walls about 3 ft high. Guy ropes were connected every 2 ft around the top of the walls - these had to carefully tensioned to hold the pole upright and keep the tent in shape.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Theory Overview==
===Who is Glasser?===

Dr. William Glasser is  an American psychiatrist and the developer of the Reality Theory and Choice Theory.  Born in Cleveland, Ohio in 1925, he was educated at Case Western Reserve University, where he received a B.S. and M.A. in clinical psychiatry.  In 1953, he received his M. D. and completed his residency at UCLA and the Veterans Administration Hospital of Los Angeles.  He received numerous awards for his outstanding work.  These awards include an honorary degree from the University of San Francisco in 1990.  He also received the American Counseling Association’s Professional Development Award in 2003 and the ACA’s “A Legend in Counseling Award” in 2004.  Dr. Glasser founded The Institute for Reality Therapy in 1967, which was later renamed The Institute for Control Theory, Reality Therapy and Quality Management in 1994.  The name changed again in 1996 when it was renamed The William Glasser Institute. 

Dr. Glasser’s ideas are considered controversial by mainstream psychiatrists.  Glasser’s ideas focus on personal choice, personal responsibility, and personal transformation, whereas his critics focus instead on classifying psychiatric syndromes and often prescribing psychotropic medications to treat mental disorders.  Glasser is noted for applying his theories to broader social issues, including education, management, and marriage.  He also advocated the consideration of mental health as a public health issue.  By 1996, Glasser’s body of work, known as Control Theory, was renamed Choice Theory.&lt;ref&gt;Retrieved from(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Glasser)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

The Control Theory, later named Choice Theory, states that a person’s behavior is inspired by what that person wants or needs at that particular time, not an outside stimulus.  Glasser states that all living creatures control their behavior to fulfill their need for satisfaction in one or more of these five areas: survival, to belong and be loved by others, to have power and importance, freedom and independence, and to have fun.&lt;ref&gt;Retrieved from(http://www.funderstanding.com/control_theory.cfm)&lt;/ref&gt;  Every individual has the power to change their lives for the better based on the choices they make.  A person can make the proper choices and take greater responsibility for their actions by asking themselves the following questions:&lt;br&gt; 
* What do you want?&lt;br&gt;
* What are you doing to achieve what you want?&lt;br&gt;
* Is it working?&lt;br&gt;
* What are your plans or options?&lt;ref&gt;Quoted from(http://wik.ed.uiuc.edu/index.php/Control_Theory)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;

1.	Identify at least three indicators of consistent classroom management used by the teacher and how well was the teacher able to facilitate learning?

To provide an answer to this question would fall next to impossible if Classroom Management and Classroom Management Indicator hang undefined. Classroom management is the process of managing and controlling the classroom environment. To ensure that teachers are able to get through to students in an effective and productive manner, without distractions or disruptive behavior, they use specific techniques. Classroom Management Indicators are used to measure the success that teachers have in managing their classroom and activities (Martin, 2005). Assuming what the source has presented comes with accuracy, classroom management indicators are somewhat like barometers made use of by the teachers to determine whether their strategy or two of keeping the students under a particular management are consistently operative or merely nominal. 
Overlooking the class from the backmost part of the classroom during the first day of classroom observation, it was virtually noticeable how the teacher underlined strategies to keep the students under an effective classroom management. Utter positive reinforcements were present. Frequent use of verbal reprimands was in the picture. Reward system, proper arrangement of chairs, individualized praises, oral recognition of misbehaviors and other common strategies were also observed. As you may have noticed, the list of strategies I detailed tends to come with quite of a length. But the number of strategies applied isn’t really a matter. What matters most is the efficiency and consistency of the technique being reinforced. To note, it has been said that “effective management is the key factor to a positive classroom environment” (Hue &amp; Li, 2008). 
Consistency in reinforcing techniques of classroom management can be determined, I can tell, by at least three indicators. First, when students that constitute a class maximally involve themselves to work despite the variation of their interests, backgrounds, cultures and ideas, consistent classroom management is observably present. According to Oliver Clinton Moles (1990), classrooms are crowded and busy places in which group of students who vary in interests and abilities must be organized and directed in ways that maximize work involvement and minimize disruptions. Second, when misbehaving students of a class tend to conform their actions more often to rules and instructions set by the teacher and thus no longer misbehaving, consistent classroom management is keenly used. As any experienced teacher would say, one common fruit of effective management is the shift of students’ behavior. Third and last, when the entirety of classroom atmosphere seems to no longer need further management from the teacher, consistent classroom management is obviously present. Classroom management is basically a necessary conditioning practice done to keep the students moderated, properly propped and enabled to effectively learn. So simple logic will say when one classroom management exercise has truly been consistent and effective, all the moderation, proper propping and enabling no longer have to be done repeatedly.

Choice Theory® is the basis for all programs taught by the Institute. It states that all we do is behave, that almost all behavior is chosen, and that we are driven by our genes to satisfy five basic needs: survival, love and belonging, power, freedom and fun. In practice, the most important need is love and belonging, as closeness and connectedness with the people we care about is a requisite for satisfying all of the needs. Choice Theory (and the Seven Caring Habits) is offered to replace external control psychology (and the Seven Deadly Habits), the present psychology of almost all the people in the world. Unfortunately, this forcing, punishing psychology is destructive to relationships. When used in a relationship it will always destroy the ability of one or both to find satisfaction in that relationship, and will result in people becoming disconnected from those with whom they want to be connected. Disconnectedness is the source of almost all human problems, such as what is called mental illness, drug addiction, violence, crime, school failure, spousal and child abuse, to mention a few. The 1998 book, Choice Theory: A New Psychology of Personal Freedom, is the primary text for all that is taught by the Institute.&lt;br&gt;

==Implementation==
After looking through the Glasser's theory and models, what is the most effective way to learn about choice theory?  What practical ways can we implement the Glasser’s Choice (Control) Theory (behavior results from one of five basic needs needing to be met) into a classroom?

Here are a few examples for both Elementary and Secondary Levels.

===Elementary===
When deciding to use Choice Theory in an elementary classroom, teachers must share with their students that they have a say in what they learn and how they learn it. In order to have their “say” students must learn to make choices. 

In order to convey the message, a suggested way to teach the theory concept is by teaching through the use of skits or role-playing.  William and Carleen Glasser have created a series of skits to assist teachers (although written for use basically in secondary schools) in teaching the theory.  The skits help in teaching students about such concepts as building trust, making connections and responsible choices, making decisions, talking together, acquiring knowledge to using knowledge, authentic assessment, competency, getting along, caring and respecting, moving from external control to internal control, teaching Choice Theory to others and every student can succeed.

Can these skits be adapted to teach younger, elementary aged students?  It has been accomplished.  As stated by Angela Ward, her suggestion for teaching the concepts in her second grade class would be to use the series by, “restructuring the skits by changing the amount of characters from five to four to account for her teams in her 
classroom.”  In addition, she suggests, “by keeping the names consistent throughout, the students were able to each do a different skit and the audience could follow the story line.”&lt;ref&gt;Retrieved from http://www.wglasser.com/Teaching%20Choice%20Theory%20Through%20Skits.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;

In addition, Glasser shares what he believes are the Seven Caring Habits which includes:  Supporting, Encouraging, Listening, Accepting, Trusting, Respecting, and Negotiating Differences and he shares his belief of the Seven Deadly Habits – Criticizing, Blaming, Complaining, Nagging, Threatening, Punishing, and Bribing or rewarding to control.

To teach this in elementary schools a teacher could possibly borrow the ideas from Gail Edelman Small a teacher from Conejo Elementary School near Thousand Oaks, California.  Students made creative representations to show the importance of choices.  Three examples were:  creating a “choice flower” – the petals on the flower were used to describe the things and people the student loved and what things or events made her feel “powerful and free.”  A second example:  a student created a book about her thoughts and feelings surrounding her choices.  And a third example was a student who created posters of magazine cutouts about Glasser's idea of how seven caring and deadly habits make or break relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Retrieved from http://www.toacorn.com/news/2007/0531/Community/021.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;

===Secondary (Middle and High School)===

Implementation of choice theory into secondary education would basically allow students the freedom of choice.  Educators would only be supportive entities only to help the students make a better choice.  Reaffirming that one can only control oneself would be the focus of teachers in this particular environment.  Educators and students will recognize everyone’s basic needs and the necessity in fulfilling those needs in an environment that fosters caring and respect for all.  Ensuring the students attain self-awareness and esteem to make better choices for themselves develops as a secondary goal.  The primary goal of an educator is to prepare students for the “real world”.  Real world skills that are needed are interpersonal skills and group problem solving.  Secondary education would emphasize not blatant memorization but more on critical thinking skills and a problem-based learning.  As in the real world, students are encouraged to seek help and help one another as necessary.  Students will use all resources available, including parents, each other, texts, to demonstrate understanding.  The grading system is based on competence and credit will be given only if competence is demonstrated (B).  Student with an understanding above the competence level along with willingness to help others would earn an exemplary grade (A).


The following Glasser skit can be modified for elementary level students.

==Critique==
===Support===

There are over twenty “Quality Schools” that have implemented William Glasser’s Choice Theory in their schools (William Glasser Institute, 2006). Many of the supporters of Glasser’s theory believe his ideas are revolutionary and at the same time contain a basic common sense philosophy. In Corning New York they have implemented  &quot;the Choice Community Project.&quot; Many different segments of this community are involved in this project: the senior center has a support group for women; the county jail has workshops for the inmates; one pastor has couples in pre-marriage counseling read about Glasser's philosophy; and workshops have been offered to community citizens, promoting their participation the project.  Supporters of the community project have stated, ...&quot;there are signs that Corning -- person by person, household by household -- is gradually becoming a kinder, gentler place&quot; (Foderaro, 2002,  5). One superintendent involved with the “Quality Schools”  in Corning indicated that his schools have had fewer suspensions since the project began (Foderaro, 2002).  Additionally, despite the claim Glasser's Choice Theory is not supported by research, educator's research using Glasser's Choice theory with students has found student's learning and retention is increased as well as overall student satisfaction in the classroom. (Cooke, 1995; Martin, 1988).

===Disagreements===

William Glasser has written numerous books of which two are entitled, Defining mental Health as a Public Health Problem and Warning, Psychiatry Can be Hazardous to Your Health. These titles seem to directly challenge psychological and mental health professions.  Some of these professionals have countered that Glasser's work has been an attempt to reinvent theories of other theorists such as “… Erich Fromm, the psychologist Abraham Maslow and the psychotherapist Carl Rogers“ (Foderaro, 2002, p. 2).  

Dr. W. Thomas Bourbon, a Perceptual Control Theorist from Rochelle, Texas wrote a review of Edward E. Ford’s book, Discipline for Home and School, Book Two: Practical Standards for Schools (revised and expanded edition).  In this review, Bourbon describes a chronological history comparing the work of Ford along side the work of Glasser.  Throughout his comparison of these theorists Bourbon challenges the credibility of Glasser's work.  At one point in the review Bourbon states, &quot;Does the material I have quoted from Glasser's web site seem to indicate that he (Glasser) has modified his personal beliefs in cause-effect to make them more compatible with PCT science? Are Glasser's assertions the same as PCT? You tell me&quot; (Bourbon, n.d., 98 section,  2).  Bourbon then refers to a lack of  research supporting Glasser’s work, ... &quot;it is a serious mistake to believe that a particular set of needs has been &quot;scientifically proved&quot; to be real&quot; (Bourbon, n.d., 98 section,  10).

===Personal Reflections===
Dee's Reflection: &lt;br&gt;
As I look through the information provided for Choice Theory and the five basic needs each person has and how this reflects in our behavior, I think of these things how they relate in my private life before I put this in context with students.  I agree with the theory 
that Glasser has shared.  I have always believed that each person has choices, and each choice has some sort of outcome or consequence that results from that particular choice.  When I think about using the theory in my classroom, I believe it is something that I already stress to some degree.  I often convey the message to my students that 
most everything that we do in class leaves room for choices. For example, they can choose to behave one way or another; they have a choice whether to complete classwork; they have a choice to ask for assistance when they’re struggling with something.

In addition, I agree with the aspect of the theory that one behaves one way when a basic need is not met.  For example, I had situations in my classroom where a behavior stemmed from a child wanting attention because there was a situation at home, which resulted in them possibly not feeling loved.  Another example could be a student’s 
inappropriate behavior resulted from their need for “survival” when a skill was being introduced or reviewed because they “didn’t get it” and they were trying to downplay the lack of knowledge.

On a personal standpoint, I know, myself, if my needs aren’t being met in some way, my reactions and “behavior” is not the norm.  For example, if I don’t receive a hug from my son in the morning or after school, I tend to be a little grumpy.  Another example, is if I 
don’t have my one cup of coffee in the morning, I am very lethargic in my mood and actions.

I am in agreement with Glasser’s theory  people always have control over their behavior and how the outcome for such choices or behavior will result.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Randi's Reflection:&lt;br&gt; 
The Choice Theory reveals a manner of observing behavior and examining the needs of individuals that appeals to me.  Through an examination of the criticisms of William Glasser’s Choice Theory there was a discovery of, and an interest found for, the Perceptual Control Theory.  This new interest does not change the appeal of Glasser’s work, for me, it adds an extra added dimension to understanding “the why” of needs.  Why do we have the needs we do?  After reading Dr. Bourbon’s opinions and perceptions I was left wondering what got him so invested in his stance, seemingly against anything to do with Glasser.  Personally I see both of these theories working hand in hand, I also believe there is room for both theories.&lt;p&gt;  

Through my observations in life I have come to believe that … Everyone has choices everyday.  Sometimes we are unaware we have or make these choices … by becoming aware …  we become responsible not only for our choices but also to make these choices  … consciously.  We ALL have the choice about … how we feel … how we react … how we think … I believe that we ALWAYS have a choice … with everything … AND because of this choice we choose/create our reality.  For do we not define reality through our thoughts and what we chose to believe.&lt;br&gt;         
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Tammy’s Reflection:&lt;br&gt;
When researching Glasser’s theory of Choice Theory, at first it sounded a bit too abstract.  Although we all seek to have our needs met, I had not considered that those needs drove our every decision.  I had felt that when students acted out it was because of an outstanding source or for a need for attention, but now I see that there are other motives that drive our behavior.  I found the ten axioms to be fairly solid for me.  There is one that I have used many times but did not know where it came from, “You cannot control another person’s behavior just your response to that behavior.”  I find that to be very true.  Having learned the ideas from Glasser’s Choice Theory, I can now better evaluate why a student might be acting out and determine which of his needs are not being met.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Val's Reflection:&lt;br&gt;
After reviewing Glasser’s theory, I believe that many of my own personal beliefs mesh with his Choice Theory.  I often tell my students that we cannot control what happens to us but we control how we choose to react.  There are many hardships facing our students today, do we really want them to sit around and belly ache about how bad it is or do we want to help them take steps to improve their own situations.  Choice theory does not allow ones environment to be an excuse but instead treats it as a learning opportunity.  The path to becoming a responsible person is a tough one and it comes with facing problems and choosing the best way to learn from those problems.  There is a need to feel we deserve better, the empowerment that develops with making one’s own decisions can only increase self-esteem.  There will be mistakes but that is how problems are solved, by finding a solution.  Ultimately the student’s choices determine what and how successful they will be.  A personal area of improvement would be to have higher expectations for my students.  I have high expectations for younger family members.  In the current grading systems, I do not allow them to settle for a C.  I have a friend who has observed this and asked me “Why is it okay for your students to have a C and not your nephew?”  I didn’t have an answer.  I feel this expectation should be relevant for everyone I care about and I have resolved to hold my students to this expectation as well.  Although I might not be able to support my students as much as my own family but I feel this is an attainable goal and will strive to push my students toward it.  Another expectation I would like to implement is that of helping one another, an exemplary grade can only be earned if the student chooses to help others.  I believe this a very important life skill and plan to integrate it into future classes.&lt;br&gt;

===Overview of History and Theory===
====History of Thomas Gordon====

Thomas Gordon dedicated his life to developing training systems that help individuals improve their relationships with one another. Dr. Thomas Gordon’s approach to psychology was revolutionary because it looked at relationships, rather than individuals, to solve conflicts. 

When Dr. Gordon began in the field of psychology he was dissatisfied with the emphasis on statistics and scientific process. What Dr. Gordon was really interested in was the relationships between people. On his website, there is a story about how a young Dr. Gordon was inspired while watching a Sunday school teacher. The Sunday school teacher, “created a climate in class that made the students feel good about themselves and that encouraged them to enjoy learning” (Gordon Training International, 2005-2007). Dr. Gordon was also influenced by his experience in the Army Air Force from 1942-1946. As a student in the Army’s pilot training program he suggested that the authoritarian style of discipline contributed to accidents and a large drop out rate. After persuading his superiors to implement a program in which fear was not the primary element, students in the training program became much more successful.
 
After his time in the war, Dr. Gordon went to the University of Chicago to pursue his Ph.D. with his favorite professor Carl Rogers. It was there that he discovered, “that with training in reflective listening, and with an attitude of genuine acceptance and trust in their clients’ ability to solve their own problems, positive and lasting changes in their clients could be achieved” (Gordon Training International, 2005-2007). After receiving his Ph.D. in 1949, he spent five years of teaching at the University of Chicago. After that,Dr. Gordon took his experience and continued his career as a private consultant.

Throughout his career Dr. Gordon has published works focusing on issues such as organizational leadership, communications, counseling, discipline, parenting, conflict resolution and democratic decision making. In addition to contributing over 50 published articles, Dr. Gordon also authored 9 books including Teacher Effectiveness Training. During his lifetime he was involved in many different psychological associations including Division of Peace Psychology and the National Peace Foundation. In 1997, 1998 and 1999 Dr. Gordon was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize (Gordon Training International, 2005-2007).

====Classroom Philosophy====

The central tenet of Dr. Gordon’s approach to classroom management is the importance of developing meaning and mutually beneficial relationships. Dr. Gordon rejects traditional models of reward and punishment because they are based upon an assertion of power and foster no intrinsic motivation. Instead Dr. Gordon focuses on how student’s conflicts can be resolved in a way that will improve their relationships with their teacher and peers. 

Dr. Gordon recognizes that conflict is an inevitable part of relationships because each person is an individual with unique values and needs. There will be times when these needs come into conflict. However, conflict does not have to destroy a relationship. By having open and honest communication, along with listening with genuine acceptance and understanding, individuals are able to find their own solutions. It is important that these solutions are agreeable to both parties involved in the conflict. It is also important to tell someone if their behaviors are negatively affecting you. The hope is that they will respect your feelings enough to change their behavior (Gordon, 1978). 

When conflict arises in the classroom setting Dr. Gordon suggests following a series of steps. The first step is to use a graphic tool developed by Dr. Gordon called a “Behavior Window.” The purpose of the Behavior Window is to determine if “a problem exists, who owns it, and what skill can be used to solve it” (Gordon Training International, 2005-2007). If the student owns the problem, the second step for the teacher is to engage is active listening. Active listening occurs when a teacher listens and reflects back to a student their understanding of the conflict. This process communicates to the student that the teacher cares and is genuinely engaged in the conversation. If the teacher owns the problem, Dr. Gordon suggests that the second step of the resolution process begin with an “I-Message”. This means that the teacher will initiate the conversation by explaining her feelings to the student. The purpose of the I-Message is to confront someone else’s misbehavior without being confrontational.  The final step is the “No-Lose Conflict Resolution.” The purpose of this final step is to come up with a solution that everyone can be invested in. If both parities participate in creating a solution, the solution is more likely to work!

===Implementation===
The implementation of Thomas Gordon’s theory of conflict resolution must be based on helping student relations grow positively out of conflict, rather than degenerate.  This can be accomplished by discussing and agreeing on common resolutions in a role-play situation before implementation into the classroom.  The main components of the theory should be modeled, discussed, and then actively practiced for proper implementation.  These components include active listening and the usage of I-messages to form a common resolution of a dispute.

In an elementary setting, Thomas Gordon’s theory of conflict resolution can be implemented through a “Peace Walk.”  The peace walk is designed for two students to walk together through specific steps that lead to peaceful resolution of conflict.  Each student is to practice active listening, as well as the usage of I-messages.  One student is the color red, while the other is blue.  The steps include:

   Step 1: RED: use an I-message to tell how you feel.
   BLUE: Listen and retell what you hear.
   Step 2: RED: Suggest a solution.             
   BLUE: Listen and retell what you hear.
   Step 3: BLUE: Suggest a solution.             
   RED: Listen and retell what you hear.
   Step 4: RED: Agree on a solution.
   BLUE: Agree on a solution.

In a secondary setting, Thomas Gordon’s theory of conflict resolution can be implemented through a “Peace Table,” which is permanently located in a section of each classroom.  If a conflict among students occurs in a classroom setting, the students are required to sit at the “Peace Table” and discuss their individual feelings.  The peace table is equipped with a graphic organizer, which lists the steps students are required to take in order to resolve the conflict.  The steps are as follows:

   1.   Student A uses I-messages to explain how he/she feels about the present situation.
   2.   Student B practices active listening while Student A shares his/her feelings.
   3.   Student B uses I-messages to explain how he/she feels about the present situation.
   4.   Student A practices active listening while Student B shares his/her feelings.
   5.   Students A and B agree on a common solution after their discourse is complete.

Implementation of the peace walk and the peace table should be preceded with appropriate modeling of the conflict resolution theory.  Students should have the opportunity to practice active listening and the usage of I-messages through role-plays in the classroom.  

In an elementary setting, a teacher can provide students with generated social conflicts, which students may practice resolving through the peace walk process.  Students can practice active listening and the usage of I-messages.  They can then determine an appropriate resolution to the generated conflict, in which both students are equally invested.

In a secondary setting, a teacher can create a role-play scenario, in which students are to conference peacefully about a specific global issue.  Students are required to practice active listening while another is speaking.  In discussing the global issue, students are required to use I-messages to present information about the issue, as well as express how they are personally feeling.  Near the end of the discussion, all students are required to agree upon a common resolution, in which everyone is invested.    

===Professional Critique===
According to Thomas Gordon, the basis for a manageable classroom is developing positive relationships with students. Many other educators support this idea through the use of I messages and active listening; some have even gone as far as to include it as part of a curriculum. 

Amy Martin, from the Morningside Center for Teaching Social Responsibility, has created lesson plans for teaching the use of I-Messages in the classroom. Martin’s use of I-Messages supports Gordon’s philosophy in that it provides resources for teachers and parents to resolve conflicts constructively with their children. Martin focuses on the fact that I messages do not put blame on the individual, but rather allow for a strong statement about one’s feelings while remaining positive. Similar to Gordon, Martin recognizes that peaceful resolutions help individuals to grow in positive relationships after a conflict.  In addition to using this method in times of conflict, Martin claims it is important to create a routine where students can practice using I-Messages before hectic times of day such as recess and other transitions.  She states “These are times of the day when strong emotions can take over and interfere with clear expression. Because our days are usually over-packed with teaching and learning, it is important to really plan this activity into your schedule” (Martin)

Other curriculum companies such as Success for All have actually created manuals like Getting Along Together to teach conflict management at the very beginning of the year in order to create an environment filled with positive relationships. This manual uses an activity called “The Peace Path” (Success for All, 2005). This activity supports Gordon’s philosophy of creating positive relationships out of conflict by giving students specific steps for resolving conflicts. The first step calls for one child to use an I-Message to express their feelings. At this time, the other student must use active listening to listen and restate what he or she heard. The next step has the first student suggest a solution while the other student listens and restates the first student’s solution. Then, the second student suggests a solution while the first student listens and retells the other student’s solution. Finally, both students agree on a solution (Success for All, 2005). This particular activity focuses on Gordon’s primary components of conflict resolution and supports the building of positive relationships in the classroom.

Thomas Gordon Critique:

	While Thomas Gordon’s theory on classroom management has many positive aspects, it is important to critique any theory before implementation in the classroom.  Thomas Gordon focuses mainly on how to solve problems in the most kind and effective way possible.  He believes that by using his method of solving conflicts, relationships are going to strengthen.
	One might critique Gordon’s theory because he focuses mainly on resolving conflict after it arises.  Gordon does not take any preventative measures in avoiding conflict.  Theorist Jacob Kounin, however, is a firm believer in preventing misbehaviors from occurring in the classroom by setting expectations at the start of the year.  If expectations are not set right from the start, students are likely to misbehave, simply because they are unaware of how their teachers expect them to behave (http://wik.ed.uiuc.edu/index.php/Kounin,_Jacob, June 14, 2007).  
	After teachers elicit clear and concise expectations for their students, other forms in which to prevent misbehavior include the creation of engaging lessons, teacher preparation and organization, and a focus on movement.  Kounin believes there are five important roles a teacher must exhibit in the classroom: Withitness, Overlapping, Momentum, Smoothness and Group Alerting.  When a teacher is “with it,” he or she knows exactly what is happening in the classroom at all times.  Overlapping is having the ability to do more than one thing at a time.  Momentum has to do with the flow of the lesson.  A teacher must be prepared during a lesson, but also willing to be flexible if necessary.  Smoothness refers to the ability to stay on task within a lesson and refrain from using tangents.  Group Alerting is the way in which a teacher keeps students actively involved and engaged in a lesson.  If a teacher exhibits these five roles, students will refrain from misbehaving in class ((http://wik.ed.uiuc.edu/index.php/Kounin,_Jacob, June 14, 2007).  
	Thomas Gordon has also been critiqued on his usage of I-messages.  I-messages are ways in which a person can express him or herself without placing blame on another person.  They are designed to be used in a positive manner, however, Dr. Jane Bluestein (2007) believes I-messages are ways in which to control and manipulate others.  Dr. Bluestein gives an example of a negative I-message in an article entitled, “What’s Wrong with ‘I-Messages?’” Her example is as follows: “I feel ____ when you _____” (Bluestein, 2007).  In other words, your behavior causes me to have a specific, usually negative, feeling.  Dr. Bluestein (2007) argues that one should always take responsibility for how one is feeling and never place burden on another.  She writes, “We certainly don’t want to burden others, especially our children with the overwhelming—and impossible—responsibility for our hap¬piness and well-being. Remember that personal growth and self-responsibility typically involve learning to separate who we are and how we feel about ourselves from other people’s behav¬iors” (Bluestein, 2007).  Everyone has very different needs, and when a person attempts to please others, that person’s individual needs are often not being met.  
	Bluestein (2007) also argues that I-messages can create an opposite reaction than they are intended.  After hearing an I-message, a person may feel resentment toward the other person and may not be willing to change behaviors for the person.  Instead of using I-messages, Bluestein argues that it is important to set boundaries.  If a child is misbehaving, an adult should step in and be assertive with the child.  Misbehaviors should not be supported or condoned, and the child who is misbehaving should not have to feel responsible for how another person is feeling about their behavior.  That child should take responsibility for his or her own actions without feeling blamed by another.

Our critique:

After carefully researching Thomas Gordon's classroom management theory and articles from his colleagues, we have concluded that Gordon's theory is only one piece of the puzzle. Gordon’s use of I-Messages and Active Listening can be a very useful tool for addressing one’s own feelings. However, we believe that the use of I-Messages still poses blame on another party. We feel it is important for students to recognize that feelings from an action are subject to that individual’s personality; no one can make you feel something. We believe it is important for students to take responsibility for their own feelings and not blame them on another person. In Gordon’s implementation of I-Messages as student would state: “I feel (feeling) when you (action).” We disagree with the use of I messages in this format because the blame is still being placed on another individual. Perhaps a way to change this is by never using the word you in an I-Message. For example, “I feel (feeling) when (action) happens.” One of Gordon’s goals in his management theory is for students to develop positive relationships out of conflict; we believe there is a better way to meet this goal than using Gordon’s model of I-Messages.

===Questions===
1. What techniques that Thomas Gordon uses to solve conflicts? List at least three techniques. 

2. Evaluate. How you could implement Gordon’s model of conflict resolution in your classroom management plan?

      <text xml:space="preserve">There has been a large increase in research activity in the area of attention since the 1950s. This research has focused not only on attention, but also how attention is related to memory and executive functioning. Human learning and behaviour are dependent on our ability to pay attention to our environment, retain and retrieve information, and use cognitive strategies. An understanding of the development of attention is also critical when we consider that deficits in attention often lead to difficulties in school and in the work force. Thus, attention is an important topic in the study of psychology, specifically in the areas of development (see Part II of this book), learning (Part III), and psychological disorders (see the section on ADHD in Part IV). There is no doubt that an understanding of attention and related concepts is critical to our understanding of human cognition and learning.

===Introduction to The History of Research on Attention===

The study of attention is a major part of contemporary cognitive psychology and cognitive neuroscience. Attention plays a critical role in essentially all aspects of perception, cognition, and action, influencing the choices we make. The study of attention has been of interest to the field of psychology since its earliest days. However, many ideas about attention can be traced to philosophers in the 18th and 19th centuries, preceding the foundation of the field of psychology.

The topic of attention was originally discussed by philosophers. Among the issues considered were the role of attention on conscious awareness and thought, and whether attention was directed voluntarily or involuntarily toward objects or events. The characterization of attention provided by each philosopher reflected that individual's larger metaphysical views of the nature of things and how we come to know the world. For instance, Joan Luis Vives (1492-1540) recognized the role of attention in forming memories. Gottfried Leibniz (1646-1716) introduced the concept of apperception, which refers to an act that is necessary for an individual to become conscious of a perceptual event. He noted that without apperception, information does not enter conscious awareness. Leibniz said, &quot;Attention is a determination of the soul to know something in preference to other things&quot;. In summary, many philosophers gave attention a central role in perception and thinking. They introduced several important issues, such as the extent to which attention is directed automatically or intentionally. These topics continue to be examined and evaluated in contemporary research. Although they conducted little experimental research themselves, their conceptual analysis of attention laid the foundation for the scientific study of attention in ensuing years.

The philosophical analyses of attention led to some predictions that could be tested experimentally. In addition, in the mid-1800s psychophysical methods were being developed that allowed the relation between physical stimulus properties and their corresponding psychological perceptions to be measured. Wilhelm Wundt, who established the first laboratory devoted to psychological research in 1879, was responsible for introducing the study of attention to the field. In addition, the relation between attention and perception was one of the first topics to be studied in experimental psychology. Wundt held that attention was an inner activity that caused ideas to be present to differing degrees in consciousness. He distinguished between perception, which was the entry into the field of attention, and apperception, which was responsible for entry into the inner focus. He assumed that the focus of attention could narrow or widen. This view that has also enjoyed popularity in recent years.
At the end of the 19th century, Hermann von Helmholtz (1821-1894) argued that attention is essential for visual perception. Using himself as a subject and pages of briefly visible printed letters as stimuli, he found that attention could be directed in advance of the stimulus presentation to a particular region of the page, even though the eyes were kept fixed at a central point. He also found that attention was limited: The letters in by far the largest part of the visual field, even in the vicinity of the fixation point, were not automatically perceived.

William James's (1890/1950) views on attention are probably the most well known of the early psychologists. In his famous Principles of Psychology (1980), James asserted that &quot;the faculty of voluntarily bringing back a wandering attention, over and over again, is the very root of judgment, character, and will.&quot; His definition of attention is also widely quoted. According to James (1890), “It is taking possession by the mind, in clear and vivid form, of one of what seem several simultaneously possible objects or trains of thought. Focalization, concentration, of consciousness are of its essence. It implies withdrawal from some things in order to deal effectively with others, and is a condition which has a real opposite in the confused, dazed, scatterbrained state.&quot;

Moreover, according to James, the immediate effects of attention are to make us perceive, conceive, distinguish and remember, better than we otherwise could –both more successive things and each thing more clearly. It also shortens “reaction time”. James’s definition also mentions clearness, which Titchener (1908/1973) viewed as the central aspect of attention. Pillsbury (1908/1973) agreed with Titchener, indicating, “the essence of attention as a conscious process is an increase in the clearness on one idea or a group of ideas at the expense of others”. Researchers at the beginning of the 20th century debated how this increased clearness is obtained.

In summary, around 1860, the philosophical approach dominated the study of psychology in general and attention especially. During the period from 1980 to 1909, the study of attention was transformed, as was the field of psychology as a whole, to one of scientific inquiry with emphasis on experimental investigations. However, given that behaviourism came to dominate psychology in the next period, at least in the United States, the study of attentional mechanisms was largely delayed until the middle of the 20th century.

Although one often reads that research on attention essentially ceased during the period of 1910-1949, attention research never disappeared completely. However, there was an increase in interest in the topic with the advent of contemporary cognitive psychology. Lovie (1983) compiled tables showing the numbers of papers on attention listed in Psychological Abstracts and its predecessor, Psychological Index, in five-year intervals from 1910 to 1960, showing that studies on the topic were conducted during these time periods. Among the important works on attention was that of Jersild (1927) who published a classic monograph, “Mental Set and Shift”. Another significant contribution during this era was the discovery of the psychological refractory period effect by Telford (1931). He noted that numerous studies showed that stimulation of neurons was followed by a refractory phase during which the neurons were less sensitive to stimulation. Stroop (1935/1992) also published what is certainly one of the most widely cited studies in the field of psychology, in which he demonstrated that stimulus information that is irrelevant to the task can have a major impact on performance (see below for John Ridley Stroop and the impact of the Stroop Color-Word Task on research on attention). Paschal (1941), Gibson (1940) and Mowrer, Rayman and Bliss (1940) also conducted research on attention such as that on preparatory set or mental set. In sum, although the proportion of psychological research devoted to the topic of attention was much less during this time period than during preceding decades, many important discoveries were made, which have influenced contemporary research on the topic.

The period from 1950 to 1974 saw a revival of interest in the characterization of human information processing. Research on attention during this period was characterized by an interplay between technical applications and theory. Mackworth (1950) reported experiments on the maintenance of vigilance that exemplified this interaction and set the stage for extensive research on the topic over the remainder of the 20th century. This research originated from concerns about the performance of radar operators in World War II detecting infrequently occurring signals. Cherry (1953) conducted one of the seminal works in attention during this period, studying the problem of selective attention, or, as he called it, “the cocktail party phenomenon”. He used a procedure called dichotic listening in which he presented different messages to each ear through headphones. Broadbent (1958) developed the first complete model of attention, called Filter Theory (see below). Treisman (1960) reformulated Broadbent's Filter Theory into what is now called the Filter-Attenuation Theory (see below).

In the early 1970s, there was a shift from studying attention mainly with auditory tasks to studying it mainly with visual tasks. A view that regards attention as a limited-capacity resource that can be directed toward various processes became popular. Kahneman’s (1973) model is the most well known of these unitary capacity or resource theories. According to this model, attention is a single resource that can be divided among different tasks in different amounts. The basic idea behind these models is that multiple tasks should produce interference when they compete for the limited capacity resources. Also, in this time period, the first controlled experiments that used psychophysiological techniques to study attention were conducted on humans. These experiments used methods that allow brain activity relating to the processing of a stimulus, called event related potentials, to be measured using electrodes placed on the scalp. In sum, the research during this period yielded considerable information about the mechanisms of attention. The most important development was the introduction of detailed information processing models of attention.

Research on attention blossomed during the last quarter of the 20th century. Multiple resources models have emerged from many studies showing that it is easier to perform two tasks together when the tasks use different stimulus or response modalities than when they use the same modalities. Treisman and Gelade (1980) also developed a highly influential variant of the Spotlight Theory called the Feature Integration Theory to explain the results from visual search studies, in which subjects are to detect whether a target is present among distracters (see below). Priming studies have also been popular during the most recent period of attention research. In such studies, a prime stimulus precedes the imperative stimulus to which the subject is to respond; the prime can be the same as or different from some aspect of the imperative stimulus.

In addition, a major focus has been on gathering neuropsychological evidence pertaining to the brain mechanisms that underlie attention. Cognitive neuroscience, of which studies of attention are a major part, has made great strides due to the continued development of neuroimaging technologies. The converging evidence provided by neuropsychological and behavioral data promises to advance the study of attention significantly in the first half of the 21st century. Finally, significant advances have also been made toward expanding the theories and methods of attention to address a range of applied problems. Two major areas can be identified. The first one concerns ergonomics in its broadest sense, ranging from human-machine interactions to improvement of work environments such as mental workload and situation awareness. The second major area of application is clinical neuropsychology, which has benefited substantially from adopting cognitive models and experimental methods to describe and investigate cognitive deficits in neurological patients. There is also work being done on the clinical application of attentional strategies (e.g., mindfulness training) in the treatment of a wide range of psychological disorders (see section on mindfulness).

===John Ridley Stroop and The Stroop Effect===

For over half a century, the Stroop effect has been one of the most well known standard demonstrations in undergraduate psychology courses and laboratories. In this cognitive task, participants asked to name the color of the ink in which an incompatible color word is printed (e.g., to say “red” aloud in response to the stimulus word GREEN printed in red ink) take longer than when asked to name the color in a control condition (e.g., to say &quot;red&quot; to the stimulus XXXXX printed in red ink). This effect, now known as the Stroop effect, was first reported in the classic article “Studies of Interference in Serial Verbal Reactions” published in the Journal of Experimental Psychology in 1935. Since then, this phenomena has become one of the most well known in the history of psychology. However, less is known about the man behind this landmark cognitive task. In the following section, a biography of John Ridley Stroop, the creator of the Stroop Color-Word task and discoverer of the Stroop Effect, will be outlined. 

John Ridley Stroop was born near Murfreesboro, Tennessee, on March 21, 1897. His middle name derived from a preacher whom his parents admired, and Stroop was known by that name both personally and professionally all through his life (MacLeod, 1992). Stroop was the second youngest of six children. As an infant, Stroop was not expected to live, which led his parents to shelter him during his childhood. Unlike the other the family members, he was not required to do heavy physical work on the family farm (MacLeod, 1991a).

Stroop's initial schooling was at Kitrell County School, where he graduated at the top of his elementary school class. He continued his education in nearby Nashville at David Lipscomb High School, graduating  in 1919. In 1921, he obtained a diploma from David Lipscomb Junior College, where he was selected to be Valedictorian. On December 23, 1921, during his second year in college at the age of 24, Stroop married Zelma Dunn, great niece of Mr. David Lipscomb. Over the next seven years, they had three sons. To be able to support his growing family, Stroop taught at David Lipscomb College and worked as a janitor and as a librarian while in graduate school (MacLeod, 1992). 

Stroop’s university years were spent at George Peabody College (now part of Vanderbilt University) in Nashville. There, he received his BS in 1924, his MA in 1925, and his PhD in 1933. His doctoral degree was in Experimental Psychology with a minor in Educational Psychology and an elective in Education. Stroop’s dissertation research was carried out under the supervision of Dr. Joseph Peterson, a former president of the American Psychological Association, at the Jesup Psychological Laboratory. Stroop developed these color-word tasks partly because the naming-reading comparison was of interest to Dr. Peterson in his individual differences research (MacLeod, 1991a). However, his real interest was on interference between conflicting processes. His research followed studies being conducted at the time on interference or inhibition but using materials that were similar in nature to those employed in color naming-word reading studies (Stroop, 1935). For instance, Stroop referred in his article to studies on color-word naming that were conducted  by John James McKeen Cattell (1886), who at the instigation of his doctoral supervisor, Wilhelm Wundt, investigated differences in reaction times to naming objects, the properties of those objects, as well as the corresponding words. Catell reported that reading words took less time than naming the objects or properties, the latter including color (Macleod, 1991b). However, it was not until Stroop's research that anyone thought to combine the word and object/property dimensions, creating the now famous situation of response conflict (MacLeod, 1991). Stroop’s PhD dissertation went to become his classic paper, which over the  years became one of the most cited articles in the history of the Journal of Experimental Psychology. 

Stroop teaching career began long before the completion of his doctoral degree. He was principal at a Mississippi Consolidated School in 1921-1922. Then, he returned to David Lipscomb College. There, he began as an instructor in Mathematics and English (1922-1923), and then switched to Modern Languages (1924-1928). Between 1928 and 1932, he was Professor of Psychology and Education, serving as Dean of the Faculty for the 1928-1929 academic year. After completing his PhD, Stroop conducted research for the Tennessee Educational Commission (1933-1934), then serving briefly as a special instructor in Psychology and Education at Tennessee Polytechnic Institute. He returned to David Lipscomb College, where he taught for almost his entire 40-year career. 

After completing his PhD, Stroop had planned to continue his line of research. However, when Dr. Peterson died in 1935, Stroop never again conducted research in psychology. As Macleod (1992) noted, it was probably this event more than any other that led Stroop to discontinue his psychological research. His wife also wrote in her biographical sketch of him:
&quot;His major professor at Peabody, Dr. Joseph Peterson, invited him to collaborate with him on a research project furthering the study of [Stroop] 's doctorate thesis. Dr. Peterson's unexpected death prevented such from happening. This was probably the changing of his work as he became more involved in teaching the Bible and writing in that field.&quot; (in MacLeod, 1991a).
Stroop published just four papers in psychology throughout his career. One concerned with group versus individual judgments (1932), and the other three related to color-word processing including his classic paper (1935), a critique of work on the color-word issue  (1935), and a test of a possible explanation of the Stroop effect (1938). Although his research career ended following the publication of these papers, Stroop remained in psychology and chaired his department from 1948 until 1964. After this period, Stroop's interest shifted away from psychology, and he devoted his attention to his religion for the rest of his life.

Stroop was a Christian who preached every Sunday in and around Nashville, often taking a train out into the country and being paid with a chicken or a bag of potatoes. He also kept a card file indicating for each Sunday where he had spoken and what his topic had been (MacLeod, 1991a). Moreover, Stroop taught bible classes in college in addition to teaching psychology. He was known to colleagues and students as both Dr. Stroop and Brother Stroop. Stroop’s major contributions were in the area of biblical studies. He wrote seven books based on his biblical teachings, beginning with Why Do People Not See the Bible Alike?  published in 1949 and ending with Restoration Ideas on Church Organization published in 1966. His major work was a trilogy entitled God’s Plan and me, which was published in 1950s. He received awards for these books, which were popular as textbooks in Christian schools. The bible then rather than psychology was Stroop’s life work.  John Ridley Stroop retired in 1967. He spent 1967-1968 as Dean of Ohio Valley College in Parkersburg, Virginia, after which he took up the position of Emeritus Professor of Biblical Studies at David Lipscomb College (MacLeod, 1991a). He died  on September 1, 1973 at the age of 76.

Stroop’s article has become one of the most cited articles in the history of experimental psychology. It has more than 700 studies seeking to explain some nuance of the Stroop effect along with thousands of others directly or indirectly influenced by this article (MacLeod, 1992). However, at the time of its publication, it had relatively little impact because it was published at the height of Behaviourism in America (MacLeod, 1991). For the next thirty years after its publication, almost no experimental investigations of the Stroop effect occurred. For instance, between 1935 and 1964, only 16 articles are cited that directly examined the Stroop effect. In 1960s, with the advent of information processing as the dominant perspective in cognitive psychology, Stroop's work was rediscovered. Since then, the annual number of  studies rose quickly, until by 1969 the number of articles settled in at just over 20 annually, where it appears to have remained (MacLeod, 1992). 

The discovery of the Stroop Effect and the development of this Color-Word task has had a lasting impact on cognitive psychology. As MacLeod (1991a) has noted,
“There are few phenomena in psychology so robust that they appear in virtually every introductory text and are known by researchers in almost every sub-area of the discipline. The Stroop effect is one of these rare phenomena. John Ridley Stroop was a pioneer, instrumental in providing one of the tools most valued by cognitive psychologists. A half century later, the task that bears his name continues to be a challenging puzzle for experimental psychologists to solve. (MacLeod, 1991a)” This landmark cognitive task has been widely used to index attentional and linguistic processes. Understanding the Stroop effect may ultimately lead us to a fuller comprehension of how attention works and of the place of attention in a more general theory of cognition.

===Donald Broadbent and Dichotic Listening===

Donald E. Broadbent has been praised for his outstanding contributions to the field of psychology since the 1950s, most notably in the area of attention. In fact, despite the undeniable role that attention plays in almost all psychological processes, research in this area was neglected by psychologists for the first half of the twentieth century (Massaro, 1996). During that time, behaviourists ignored the role of attention in human behaviour. Behaviourism was characterized by a stimulus-response approach, emphasizing the association between a stimulus and a response, but without identifying the cognitive operations that lead to that response (Reed, 2000). Subsequently, in the mid-1950s, a growing number of psychologists became interested in the information-processing approach as opposed to the stimulus-response approach. It was Broadbent’s elaboration of the idea of the human organism as an information-processing system that lead to a systematic study of attention, and more generally, to the interrelation of scientific theory and practical application in the study of psychology.

Broadbent was born May 6, 1926, in Birmingham, England (American Psychological Association, 1976). He was originally interested in the natural sciences, and thus, when he joined the Royal Air Force (RAF) in 1944, he began his study of aeronautical engineering. As he spent time in the RAF he observed that human difficulties often arose from psychological, as opposed to physical, causes (Craik &amp; Baddeley, 1995). More specifically, he noted that communication difficulties, such as problems listening to a specific stream of auditory information when presented with numerous streams, were frequently caused by inefficient processes of attention, perception, or memory, rather than by failures of hearing or technical equipment (Craik, 2000). Upon this observation, Broadbent’s interests changed from the subject of engineering to that of psychology. 

At that time, however, the field of psychology was virtually unheard of in his home country of England. It was not until Broadbent travelled across the Atlantic to the United States for flying training that he discovered that psychology was being widely studied in North America (APA, 1976). After some time working in the personnel selection branch of the RAF, he began to study experimental psychology at Cambridge. Fortunately for Broadbent, and for scores of future psychologists, the psychology department at Cambridge was an especially suitable place for him due to its natural sciences orientation and its emphasis on practical application (Craik &amp; Baddeley, 1995). Headed by Sir Frederic Bartlett, the department was enthusiastic to apply the ''cybernetic'' ideas of the late K .J. W. Craik, with the aim of understanding human behaviour in terms of control systems, to practical problems and psychological theory in general (APA, 1976). By sheer accident, but with fortunate advantage to the field of psychology, Broadbent’s interests in experimental psychology and practical application allowed him to find his place in the Applied Psychology Unit at Cambridge.

It was during his 25 years, from 1958 to 1974, as director of the Applied Psychology Unit that Broadbent was able to study and define models related to his interests in the effects of environmental stressors on cognitive performance, problems related to the detection and understanding of speech, and problems of selective listening and attention (Craik &amp; Baddeley, 1995). Up to that time, most research had shown that noise did not influence performance on psychological tasks. Broadbent wondered, however, if noise would adversely influence performance on untraditional psychological tests (APA, 1976). For instance, he discovered that noise did have an effect on the vigilance tasks invented by N. H. Mackworth, however, these tasks were deliberately long and repetitive, making them tedious to study.

During that time, Broadbent also looked at the problems caused by communicating with gunnery and air control systems, in which many channels of speech communication were delivered at one time. In contrast to the vigilance studies, he found that this problem allowed for short and quick experiments, which contributed favourably to his study of attention and noise (APA, 1976). His work on communication systems indicated that most people spend their lives surrounded by many different types of stimuli, however, they cannot respond or describe the majority of them.

Not only were Broadbent’s contributions to experimental psychology noteworthy for attention research, they also contributed to belief in the need for societal relevance in research (Craik, 2000). It is perhaps through his background in natural sciences and engineering, and his subsequent practical work with the RAF on noise and communication, that Broadbent developed a particular admiration for applied psychological work. In addition, he had an informal speaking style when presenting lectures and essays, as well as used commonplace analogies to represent complicated ideas, which allowed society as a whole to consume his theories. For instance, when initially stated, his mechanical model of attention consisted of a Y-tube, in which two separate channels of ping-pong balls merge in a central channel protected by a filter that allows only one ball to enter (Massaro, 1996). Such an analogy clearly illustrated the limitations of human attention when attempting to attend to two auditory channels at the same time. As stated by Craik and Baddeley, “[Broadbent’s] psychology was intended for society and its problems, not merely for the dwellers in ivory towers” (1995, pp. 303). 

After his death in 1993, numerous tributes and biographical acknowledgements were written in Broadbent’s honour. Above all, he is remembered for the unmistakable image that he projected of himself, as “the man, the scholar, the scientist, the philosopher of science, and of his commitments to empirical psychology, to explicit models or theories, and to the application of psychological knowledge to real-word problems” (Massaro, 1996, pp. 141). It is with this clear image in mind that a new generation of psychologists set forth, using Broadbent’s principles of experimental psychology as tools for practical application and research in the area of attention, and more broadly, all psychological processes that influence humankind.

====Dichotic Listening Experiments====

In 1952, Broadbent published his first report in a series of experiments that involved a dichotic listening paradigm. In that report, he was concerned with a person’s ability to answer one of two messages that were delivered at the same time, but one of which was irrelevant.

The participants were required to answer a series of Yes-No questions about a visual display over a radio-telephone. For example, the participant would be asked “S-1 from G.D.O. Is there a heart on Position 1?” Over,” to which the participant should answer “G.D.O. from S-1. Yes, over.” Participants in groups I, II, III, and IV heard two successive series of messages, in which two voices (G.D.O and Turret) spoke simultaneously during some of the messages. Only one of the voices was addressing S-1, and the other addressed S-2, S-3, S-4, S-5, or S-6. Participants were assigned to the following five groups:
*'''Group I:''' instructed to answer the message for S-1 and ignore the other on both runs
*'''Group II:''' instructed on one run to only answer the message from G.D.O. and on the second run was provided with a visual cue before the pairs of messages began for the name of the voice to be answered
*'''Group III:''' were given the same directions as Group I on one run, and on the other run had the experimenter indicate the correct voice verbally after the two messages had reached the “over” stage
*'''Group IV:''' had the correct voice indicated in all cases, but in one run it was before the messages began (like in Group II) and in the other run it was after the messages had finished (like in Group III)
*'''Group V:''' under the same conditions as Group I, heard the same recordings as Groups I, II, III and IV, but then also heard a two new recordings. One recording had a voice that addressed S-1 and a voice that addressed T-2, T-3, T-4, T-5, or T-6 (thus the simultaneous messages were more distinct than for the other groups). The other recording had this same differentiation of messages, but also had both voices repeat the call-sign portion of the message (i.e., “S-1 from G.D.O., S-1 from G.D.O.)

For groups I and II, it is important to note that the overall proportion of failures to answer the correct message correctly was 52%. Results from Groups III and IV indicated that delaying knowledge of the correct voice until the message is completed makes that knowledge almost useless. More specifically, Broadbent (1952) stated:

:“The present case is an instance of selection in perception (attention). Since the visual cue to the correct voice is useless when it arrives towards the ends of the message, it is clear that  process of discarding part of the information contained in the mixed voices has already taken place…It seems possible that one of the two voices is selected for response without reference to its correctness, and that the other is ignored…If one of the two voices is selected (attended to) in the resulting mixture there is no guarantee that it will be the correct one, and both call signs cannot be perceived at once any more than both messages can be received and stored till a visual cue indicates the one to be answered”. (p. 55)

In 1954, Broadbent used the same procedure as discussed above with slight modifications. In that case, he found information that indicated the positive impact that spatial separation of the messages has on paying attention to and understanding the correct message. The dichotic listening paradigm has been utilized in numerous other publications, both by Broadbent and by other psychologists working in the field of cognition. For example, Cherry (1953) investigated how we can recognize what one person is saying when others are speaking at the same time, which be described as the “cocktail party problem” (p. 976). In his experiment, subjects listened to simultaneous messages and were instructed to repeat one of the messages word by word or phrase by phrase.

====Information-Processing and The Filter Model of Attention====

Cognitive psychology is often called ''human information processing'', which reflects the approach taken by many cognitive psychologists in studying cognition. The stage approach, with the acquisition, storage, retrieval, and use of information in a number of separate stages, was influenced by the computer metaphor and the way people enter, store, and retrieve data from a computer (Reed, 2000). The stages in an information-processing model are:
*'''Sensory Store:''' brief storage for information in its original sensory form
*'''Filter:''' part of attention in which some perceptual information is blocked out and not recognized, while othere information is attended to and recognized
*'''Pattern Recognition:''' stage in which a stimulus is recognized
*'''Selection:''' stage that determines what information a person will try to remember
*'''Short-Term Memory:''' memory with limited capacity, that lasts for about 20-30 seconds without attending to its content
*'''Long-Term Memory:''' memory that has no capacity limit and lasts from minutes to a lifetime

Using an information-processing approach, Broadbent collected data on attention (Reed, 2000). He used a dichotic listening paradigm (see above section), asking participants to listen simultaneously to messages played in each ear, and based on the difficulty that participants had in listening to the simultaneous messages, proposed that a listener can attend to only one message at a time (Broadbent, 1952; Broadbent, 1954). More specifically, he asked enlisted men in England's Royal Army to listen to three pairs of digits. One digit from each pair was presented to one ear at the same time that the other digit from the pair was presented to the other ear. The subjects were asked to recall the digits in whatever order they chose, and almost all of the correct reports involved recalling all of the digits presented to one ear, followed by all the digits presented to the other ear. A second group of participants were asked to recall the digits in the order they were presented (i.e., as pairs). Performance was worse than when they were able to recall all digits from one ear and then the other.

To account for these findings, Broadbent hypothesized that the mechanism of attention was controlled by two components: a selective device or filter located early in the nervous system, and a temporary buffer store that precedes the filter (Broadbent, 1958). He proposed that the filter was tuned to one channel or the other, in an all-or-nothing manner. Broadbent’s filter model, described in his book Perception and Communication (1958), was one of the first information-processing models to be examined by psychologists.

Shortly after, it was discovered that if the unattended message became highly meaningful (for example, hearing one’s name as in Cherry's Cocktail Party Effect, as mentioned above), then attention would switch automatically to the new message. This result led to the paradox that the content of the message is understood before it is selected, indicating that Broadbent needed to revise his theory (Craik &amp; Baddeley, 1995). Broadbent did not shy away from this task. In fact, he saw all scientific theories as temporary statements, a method of integrating current evidence in a coherent manner. According to Craik and Baddeley, (1995), although Broadbent always presented his current theories firmly and persuasively, he never took the position of obstinately defending an outmoded theory. When he published his second book on the topic, Decision and Stress (1971), he used his filter model as the starting point, to which he applied modifications and added concepts “to accommodate new findings that the model itself had stimulated” (Massaro, 1996, pp. 141). Despite its inconsistencies with emerging findings, the filter model remains the first and most influential information-processing model of human cognition.

===Anne Treisman and Feature Integration Theory===
Anne Treisman is one of the most influential cognitive psychologists in the world today.  For over four decades, she has been has using innovative research methods to define fundamental issues in the area of attention and perception. Best known for her Feature Integration Theory (1980, 1986), Treisman’s hypotheses about the mechanisms involved in information processing have formed a starting point for many theorists in this area of research.

Anne Treisman (née Taylor) was born on February 27, 1935 in Wakefield, Yorkshire, England (Anon, 1991). Through the war years, Treisman lived with her family in a village near Rochester, Kent, where her father, Percy Taylor, worked as chief education officer. Forced by the English educational system to choose only three subjects to study throughout secondary school, Treisman’s studies focused on the language arts, a choice which would shape much of her post-secondary pursuits (Anon, 1991).

It was at Cambridge University that Treisman first discovered the pleasures of intellectual exchange.  Studying modern languages, she obtained a first class BA with distinction, which earned her a research scholarship (Anon, 1991; Treisman, 2006). However, faced with the prospect of research on a relatively unknown author, Treisman decided to use her scholarship to obtain a second BA in psychology instead. Under the supervision of Richard Gregory, Treisman completed this second degree in one extra year (Anon, 1991).  Gregory’s influence on Treisman was profound; in this year, she was introduced to various methods of exploring the mind through experiments in perception, igniting in her the enthusiasm for research that she maintains to this day (Anon, 1991). 

In 1957, Treisman began working toward her DPh at Oxford University, under the supervision of Carolus Oldfield (Anon, 1991).  She conducted research on aphasia and considered pursing a career in clinical psychology. However, Treisman soon realized that she lacked the appropriate training to effectively help patients and, unwilling to simply use her patients as subjects in graduate research, Treisman’s clinical career aspirations faded.  Around the same time, information theory was shifting psychologists’ view of the mind from the traditional behaviourist view of the mind as a switchboard to that of an active processor of information (Goldstein, 2005). Donald Broadbent and Colin Cherry had recently published groundbreaking papers introducing selective listening (also known as the “cocktail party problem”), which launched the cognitive revolution (Broadbent, 1954; Cherry, 1953).  Broadbent’s Filter Model of selective attention (1958), also referred to as an early selection model, proposed that unattended information is filtered out early in the process of auditory perception, that is, before incoming information is analyzed to determine its meaning.  While this theory was tremendously influential, and could account for much of the cocktail party problem, it has been criticized for being too “inflexible” (e.g., this theory could not explain why unattended information occasionally gets through to consciousness).  Guided by Donald Broadbent's book Perception and Communication (1958), Treisman began using a two-channel tape recorder (that she had been using to test aphasics) to conduct research on auditory attention in the normal population (Anon, 1991).  After three years of research, she married Michel Treisman, another Oxford graduate student.  Two years later, in 1962, she completed her thesis on selective attention and speech perception that earned her the DPh degree (Treisman, 2006).

Treisman spent the next four years working in the Medical Research Council Psycholinguistics Research Unit, conducting more research in selective listening (Anon, 1991).  In 1964, Treisman proposed an influential theory that addressed some of the “inflexibility” of Broadbent’s Filter model. This was Treisman’s Attenuation Theory, whereby processing of unattended information is attenuated or reduced, rather than completely filtered out, accounting for the fact that unattended information sometimes reached consciousness. Further, her model proposed that information processing occurs in a hierarchical manner, with processing of physical characteristics occurring at an early stage (e.g., pitch, or tone of voice) and semantic processing at a later point (Treisman, 1964, 1969).  

In 1967, while Treisman worked as a visiting scientist in the psychology department at Bell Telephone Laboratories, she published an influential paper in Psychological Review that was central to the development of selective attention as a scientific field of study. This paper articulated many of the fundamental issues that continue to guide studies of attention to this day. While at Bell, Treisman’s research interests began to expand (Anon, 1991).  Although she remained intrigued by the role of attention on auditory perception, she was now also fascinated by the way this construct modulates perception in the visual modality. 

In the following years, Treisman returned to Oxford, where she accepted a position as University lecturer in the Psychology Department and was appointed a Fellow of St. Anne’s College (Treisman, 2006). Here, she began to explore the notion that attention is involved in integrating separate features to form visual perceptual representations of objects. Using a stopwatch and her children as research participants, she found that the search for a red ‘X’ among red ‘Os’ and blue ‘Xs’ was slow and laborious compared to the search for either shape or colour alone (Gazzaniga et al., 2002).  These findings were corroborated by results from testing adult participants in the laboratory and provided the basis of a new research program, where Treisman conducted experiments exploring the relationships between feature integration, attention and object perception (Triesman &amp; Gelade, 1980).  

In 1976, Treisman’s marriage to Michel Treisman ended.  She remarried in 1978, to Daniel Kahneman, a fellow psychologist who would go on to win the Nobel Prize for Economics in 2002.  Shortly thereafter, Treisman and Kahneman accepted positions at the University of British Columbia, Canada. In 1980, Treisman and Gelade published a seminal paper proposing her enormously influential Feature Integration Theory (FIT).  Treisman’s research demonstrated that during the early stages of object perception, early vision encodes features such as color, form, and orientation as separate entities (in &quot;feature maps&quot;) (Treisman, 1986).  Focused attention to these features recombines the separate features resulting in correct object perception.  In the absence of focused attention, these features can bind randomly to form illusory conjunctions (Treisman &amp; Schmidt, 1982; Treisman, 1986).  Feature integration theory has had an overarching impact both within and outside the area of psychology.  

In the early 1980s, neuroscientists were discovering that the primate visual cortex contained areas where neurons were specifically tuned to selective features (e.g., orientation, luminance, colour, shape etc.) (Gazzaniga et al., 2002).  These findings perplexed the neuroscience community who was now faced with the question of how the brain solves the “binding problem” (i.e., how does the visual system recombine these disconnected features into unified wholes).  Treisman approached this problem by testing patients with selective attention problems.  She and her colleagues were first to demonstrate that the binding problem could present itself in everyday life and that one of its solutions involved spatial attention (Treisman and Schmidt, 1982; Goldstein, 2005).  Treisman’s theory has had a tremendous impact, providing a starting point for a great number of experiments in the areas of cognitive psychology, vision science, imaging, neuropsychology and cognitive neuroscience. 

In 1984, Treisman was made Fellow of the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research in their program of artificial intelligence (Treisman, 2006).  The fellowship allowed Treisman to collaborate closely with computer scientists who approached the study of perception from a different angle.  Two years later, Treisman and Kahneman moved to the University of California, Berkeley, where they were both professors in the Psychology Department (Treisman, 2006).  In 1989, Treisman was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, London, and in 1990, she was awarded the Howard Crosby Warren medal of the Society for Experimental Psychologists.  In 1993, Treisman accepted a position as a professor in the Psychology Department at Princeton University in New Jersey, where she still conducts research to this day.  Along with her numerous graduate students, Treisman continues to tackle some of the more challenging questions in cognitive psychology.

Treisman continues to receive numerous prestigious awards recognizing her invaluable contributions to the study of perception and attention, including the William James Fellowship of the American Psychological Society (2002) and a D.Sc., granted honoris causa, from the University of British Columbia (2004).  Clearly, Anne Treisman has been a key figure in the establishment of cognitive psychology as a science, and a significant contributor to its evolution.

====Feature Integration Theory Experiments====
According to Treisman’s Feature Integration Theory perception of objects is divided into two stages:

'''Pre-Attentive Stage:'''The first stage in perception is so named because it happens automatically, without effort or attention by the perceiver.  In this stage, an object is analyzed into its features (i.e., colour, texture, shapes etc.).   Treisman suggests that the reason we are unaware of the breakdown of an object into its elementary features is that this analysis occurs early in the perceptual processes, before we have become conscious of the object. 

Evidence: Treisman created a display of four objects flanked by two black numbers.  This display was flashed on a screen for one-fifth of a second and followed by a random dot masking field in order to eliminate residual perception of the stimuli.  Participants were asked to report the numbers first, followed by what they saw at each of the four locations where the shapes had been.  In 18 percent of trials, participants reported seeing objects that consisted of a combination of features from two different stimuli (i.e., colour and shape).  The combinations of features from different stimuli are called '''illusory conjunctions''' (Treisman and Schmidt, 1982).  The experiment also showed that these illusory conjunctions could occur even if the stimuli differ greatly in shape and size.  

According to Treisman, illusory conjunctions occur because early in the perceptual process, features may exist independently of one another, and can therefore be incorrectly combined in laboratory settings when briefly flashed stimuli are followed by a masking field (Treisman, 1986). 

'''Focused Attention Stage:''' During this second stage of perception features are recombined to form whole objects.  

Evidence: Treisman repeated the illusory conjunction experiment, but this time, participants were instructed to ignore the flanking numbers, and to focus their attention on the four target objects.  Results demonstrated that this focused attention eliminated illusory conjunctions, so that all shapes were paired with their correct colours (Treisman and Schmidt, 1982).  The experiment demonstrates the role of attention in the correct perception of objects.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Digital versus traditional?  You mean &quot;Digital capture, processing and display versus non-digital capture, processing and display&quot;, right? ==

Sorry, but digital IS &quot;traditional&quot; for people who've never used or seen anything else.  Perhaps you mean &quot;historic&quot; or &quot;analog&quot; or &quot;current technical generation versus previous technical generations(s)&quot;.  There's a similar problem in organized academically supported medicine practice versus traditional medicine, which they call &quot;alternative&quot; even though it's been the &quot;traditional&quot; health and healing mainstay for thousands of years longer than the new fangled &quot;medial&quot; stuff.  Naming things clearly, unambiguously, timelessly, is a challenge, I know, but I think it's worth it.  Give it a try.  &quot;Digital capture, processing and display versus non-digital capture, processing and display&quot;.  There, that even suggests a structure upon which to hang the contents.  Many people capture digitally, don't process at all (that they know of) and only see and share (display) digitally.  Some people capture non-digitally (or have years of non-digital capture already archived as slides, negatives and prints), want to process and print digitally, and expect to display non-digitally a print they can sell and frame and cherish &quot;just like&quot; the prints they get from the local photo lab (which nowadays are digitally processed and printed, also!).  Should I edit your &quot;module&quot; pages or will you revisit them with new eyes?  Thanks.  -- Peter Blaise [[User:Peterblaise|Peterblaise]] 19:47, 13 June 2007 (UTC)

== Where are the pictures of digital photography? ==

Why no illustrations?  Isn't photography a visual language? Yeah, I know, if I want something, contribute it!  ;-) -- Peter Blaise [[User:Peterblaise|Peterblaise]] 19:48, 13 June 2007 (UTC)

== Cost Differences ==

The cost differences between digital and film photography are exaggerated greatly in this article. At a processing cost of roughly $15-$20 USD per roll of 24-exposure film, any serious aspiring photographer that takes a significant number of pictures will quickly find digital photography to be one or two orders of magnitude cheaper than film photography. Yes, the bodies are more expensive, but once the sunk cost of the body is incurred, the cost per photo is drastically lower, regardless of how you compare. If you consider all photos taken, then the cost of keeping digital photos is equal to the proportion of the going rate for hard drive space occupied. If you consider just the &quot;keepers&quot;, the difference grows even more stark because all film photographs have to be developed and mounted as slides or printed, even the misses and bad shots. When this cost is amortized over just the keepers, hundreds of thousands of developed photos may have to be taken in order to acquire a single &quot;keeper&quot;. In the digital world, just that one keeper would be printed.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Before you continue with learning the Cherokee language, it is important to be able to read and write in Cherokee. That is what this lesson will help you with. 

The Cherokee language does '''not''' use a alphabet, but a syllabary. That means each Cherokee symbol represents a syllable, not just a consonant or a vowel. Because of this, Cherokee symbols are arranged in a chart, with a column for each Cherokee vowel and a row for each Cherokee consonant.

Below is a chart of the Cherokee Syllabary:

[[Image:Cherokee_Syllabary.svg|730px]]

'''Sounds Represented by Vowels'''
:a (as in f''a''ther, or short as in riv''a''l)
:e (as in h''a''te, or short as in m''e''t)
:i (as in p''i''que, or short as in p''i''t)
:o (as in l''aw'', or short as in n''o''t)
:u (as in f''oo''l, or short as in p''u''ll)
:v (as in b''u''t, nasalized)

===Exercises:===
/Yet to come: A good exercise would be to have a whole bunch of words in Cherokee syllabary, and the student can transliterate them, and then check the answer's--and vice versa./

*Example: ''o-si-yo'' (hello). '''First write the syllable for o then si then yo.'''
*Example 2: ''ᎠᎹ''(a-ma') (water). '''First write the syllable for Ꭰ(a) and then for Ꮉ(ma).'''

Learning the Cherokee Syllabary is a important part of learning the Cherokee language. Hopefully after these exercises you have gotten familiar with them. You'll continue to get more and more familiar with constant use, and all the next lessons will be in the Syllabary. Don't get discouraged though, if you don't completely know the Syllabary yet. The next few lesson's will have the Latin transcription side by side with the syllabary to help you. But pay attention to the syllabary, as the transliteration will slowly be phased out.

One of the better ways to learn the Syllabary is by writing the letters out individually by dictation.

One source of Cherokee Syllabary dictation is: http://www.cherokeelessons.com/Super-Cherokee-Syllabary-Dictation-Practice/

'''Note''': You must be using Cherokee Unicode Supported Fonts to view this site. Information on obtaining and installing Cherokee Unicode Fonts for Windows 2000 and Windows XP is available on the Cherokee [[w:chr:Unicode|Unicode page]]. Mac OS X from version 10.3 (Panther), Windows Vista and some Linux Operating System's include default support for displaying the Cherokee Language in syllabary.
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
==Lesson 1: Basic Greeting==

'''Perhaps this lesson should be expanded.'''

===Dialogue===

:Jane: ᎣᏏᏲ, ᏙᎯᏧ? ''o-si-yo, to-hi-tsu?'' (English:hello, how are you?) 
:John: ᎣᏍᏓ, ᏂᎯᎾ? ''o-s-da, ni-hi-na?'' (English:good, and you?)
:Jane: ᎣᏍᏓᏛ ''o-s-da-dv'' (English:good)
:John: ᎰᏩ! ''ho-wa!'' (English:alright!)
:Jane: ᎦᏙ ᏕᏣᏙᏩ? ''Gado detsadowa?'' (English: What is your name?)
:John: ᏣᏂ ᏓᏩᏙᎠ ''tsa-ni da-wa-to-a'' (English: I am called John)
:Jane: ᎭᏢ ᎯᏁᎳ? ''hatlv hinela?'' (English:Where do you live?)
:John: ᏓᎵᏩ ᏥᏁᎳ. ''daliwa tsinela'' (English:I live in Tahlequa --lit. Tahlequa live I)

===Exercise===

Unless you have printed this out, get a clean piece of paper. Without looking at the top, fill in the Cherokee words. (In syllabary as far as you remember, and in Latin)

:Jane: (1)_______________ (hello, how are you?)
:John: (2)_________________ (good, and you?)
:Jane: (3)________ (fine) (in reply to the second person)
:John: (4)_______ (alright!)


Answers: Here are the answers for questions 1-4: &lt;small&gt; (1) ᎣᏏᏲ, ᏙᎯᏧ?  ''o-si-yo, to-hi-tsu'' (2)ᎣᏍᏓ, ᏂᎯᎾ? ''o-s-da, ni-hi-na?'' (3)ᎣᏍᏓᏛ ''o-s-da-dv'' (4)ᎰᏩ! ''ho-wa!'' &lt;/small&gt;

==Notes for those who correct the book==
*ᎣᏏᏧ (O-si-tsu) mean &quot;I am fine&quot;
*ᏂᎾ (ni-na) or ᏂᎯᎾ (ni-hi-na) for ''And You?''
*ᏓᏩᏙᎠ ''da-wa-to-a'' or ᏓᏩᏙ 'da-wa-do''

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Linear Resolution==
In contrast to the saturation-based procedure, which we gave  for propositional 
resolution, we will discuss now a strategy which allows goal directed generation of resolvents.
We will see later, namely in the case of Horn clauses, that this linear strategy, is the basis 
for the interpretation of logic programs.

Given a set of clauses &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; and a clause &lt;math&gt;C_0&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. A
linear deduction of top clause &lt;math&gt;C_0&lt;/math&gt; is a
sequence &lt;math&gt;C_0, C_1, \cdots , C_n&lt;/math&gt; , where &lt;math&gt;\forall 1\leq i \leq n&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt;C_i&lt;/math&gt; is a resolvent of &lt;math&gt;C_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;B \in S \cup \{C_j \mid j&lt;i \}&lt;/math&gt; . 
If &lt;math&gt;C_n = \square&lt;/math&gt; the sequence is called a linear refutation.
==Definition 25==

The following is an example for a linear deduction. The clause set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is
given by:
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
symptom(s)  &amp; (1) \\
 
cause(c_1)\lor  cause(c_2) \lor \lnot symptom(s) &amp; (2) \\
 
treatment(t_0)\lor  \lnot cause(c_1) &amp;(3) \\

treatment(t_1)\lor \lnot  cause(c_1) &amp; (4) \\
 
treatment(t_0) \lor \lnot  cause(c_2)&amp;(5) \\
 
treatment(t_2) \lor \lnot cause(c_2)&amp; (6) \\
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

and together with  the goal &lt;math&gt;\lnot treatment(x)&lt;/math&gt;, we get the following
refutation, where clauses from &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; are given by the respective
numbers:
&lt;math&gt;\lnot treatment(X)&lt;/math&gt;, (4),&lt;math&gt; \lnot cause(c_1)&lt;/math&gt;, (2), &lt;math&gt;cause(c_2) \lor \lnot symptom(s)&lt;/math&gt;,
(1), &lt;math&gt;cause(c_2)&lt;/math&gt;, (6),  &lt;math&gt;treatment(t_2)&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt; \square &lt;/math&gt;

the same refutation can be given more naturally be the following
picture:
The following theorem states correctness and completeness of linear
resolution. Note that completeness only states that there exists a
linear refutation, there is no guaranty that every clause in the
sequence really is necessary to derive the empty clause.


&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;[[Image:linearresolution1.png]]&lt;/center&gt;
==Theorem 9==

Linear resolution is complete and correct.
Example:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;[[Image:linearresolution2.png]]&lt;/center&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Experimental Set-up==

The two slit experiment is theoretically very simple to set up and demonstrates a very interesting property of waves, even outside the area of quantum physics. A coherent monochromatic wave source is directed at two slits in an otherwise impenetrable screen. Because the slits will [[w:Diffraction|diffract]] the waves, this produces two light sources which are related very closely:
*They both have identical wavelengths (as the original source is monochromatic)
*They are both coherent (the waves are in phase)

This is shown conceptually in the diagram below. This is a very simple diagram, but it is useful to describe the concept.

[[Image:Two-Slit Experiment Light Setup.svg|centre]]

Let us now specify some parameters for the set up. We will produce our waves using a light source (such as a laser) with a wavelength of 800nm. This is just outside the red end of the visible spectrum, and is not quite visible to the human eye. However, it is a convenient number to use as it is easily divided. If you do this experiment in real life, it is likely that the light will be around 700nm (deep red). We will shine our light through two slits (which we will assume to be so narrow that the diffraction is perfect), with a separation of 0.1mm, which, as we will see, gives a significant effect and is not too difficult to achieve practically. We will then place our screen at a distance of 5 metres from the slits. So, our parameters are:

*&lt;math&gt;\lambda = 400 \times 10^{-9} \mbox{ m}\,&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;d = 0.1 \times 10^{-3} \mbox{ m}\,&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;L = 5 \mbox{ m} \,&lt;/math&gt;

Assuming that our medium has a refractive index that is very close to 1 (such as air), we also know the speed of the wave, ''c'', as this is a universal constant:

*&lt;math&gt;c = 3 \times 10^{8} \mbox{ m s}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

We can therefore work out the frequency, ''f'', and the angular frequency, ''&amp;omega;'':
*&lt;math&gt;f = \frac{c}{\lambda}=375 \times 10^{12} \mbox{ Hz}&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\omega = 2 \pi f =750\pi \times 10^{12} \mbox{ rad s}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

The wavenumber (number of cycles per metre), ''k'', can also be found:
*&lt;math&gt;k = \frac{2 \pi}{\lambda}=2.5\pi \times 10^{6} \mbox{ m}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.

==The Equation for a Single Slit==

Let us first consider the waves emanating from just one of the slits. If we assume that the slit is very long (many times the wavelength) and very narrow (much smaller than the wavelength), and that the light from the laser is a plane wave (so the phase at every point on the slit is identical), then we can say that the diffracted wave is cylindrical:

[[image:Diffraction through Slit.svg|center|400px]]

This can be proved directly from the [[w:Wave equation|wave equation]]. This means that we can just consider a &quot;slice&quot; of the wavefront and not worry about the effect of vertical distance (i.e. in the direction of the slits), as it does not affect the wave. In real life, a laser produces a tight point of light, so the wave produced is a very thin cylindrical wave (because it is not diffracted vertically by the long slit).

Let us now consider the equation for a [[w:Progressive wave|progressive wave]]. The disturbance, ''u'' produced by the wave at a distance ''x'' from the source and time ''t'', is given by the following equation:

::&lt;math&gt;u \left( x,t \right)=A \left(x,t \right) \sin \left( k x - \omega t + \phi \right)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''&amp;phi;'' is a phase offset, which we can set to zero from here on, as all the waves we are dealing with are in phase. ''A(x,t)'' is the amplitude envelope of the wave. For simplicity, we will assume that the wave does not decrease in amplitude significantly in this experiment. This is an acceptable simplification, because we are concerned with only the phase relation of the waves. In real life, the amplitude of a cylindrical wave varies inversely with distance (not the square of distance as a spherical wave does).

Below is a plot of a progressive wave in one dimension, over a whole period. This wave does not decay with distance.

[[image:1D Progressive Wave.gif|center|1D Progressive wave. You can see the wave traveling in the positive-x direction]]

Now, because we know we are dealing with a cylindrical wave, we only need to consider a 2D slice of the whole system. We set the ''x'' and ''y'' axes as shown in the image at the top of the page. The distance, ''r'', to a point at ''(x,y)'' in this case is given by the [[w:Pythagorean theorem|Pythagorean Theorem]]:

::&lt;math&gt;r=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the equation our progressive wave in 2D is now (remember we are ignoring the amplitude and phase offset):

::&lt;math&gt;u \left( x,y,t \right)=\sin \left( k \sqrt{x^2+y^2} - \omega t\right)&lt;/math&gt;

The image below shows this wave at t=0. Notice that the wave is not smooth at the origin (you can see a flipped-over - actually 180° out of phase - version of the function [[:Image:Sine of distance from origin negative.png|here]]). If this were animated, it would appear to ''flow'' outwards.

[[Image:Sine of distance from origin.png|center|400px]]

We can center one of these point sources at any point (''x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,y&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'') using the following equation:

::&lt;math&gt;u \left( x,y,t \right)=\sin \left( k \sqrt{(x-x_0)^2+(y-y_0)^2} - \omega t\right)&lt;/math&gt;

==Modeling the Experiment==

We can now construct a model of our two-slit experiment. If we place the sources at &lt;math&gt;\left(\pm \frac{d}{2},0 \right)&lt;/math&gt;, we get our slit separation of ''d''. The equation for the disturbance at any point in space and time is therefore given by the following equation:

::&lt;math&gt;u(x,y,t)=
\sin \left( k \sqrt{ \left( x-\frac{d}{2} \right)^2 + y^2} - \omega t \right)+
\sin \left( k \sqrt{ \left( x+\frac{d}{2} \right)^2 + y^2} - \omega t \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

Our slit sepation is 0.1mm and the wavelength is 800nm. This means that the slits are 125 wavelengths apart, so we will be able to make out the diffraction pattern quite easily on a reasonably sized graph. Below is a density plot of the diffraction pattern for our setup. Black corresponds to the minimum amplitude and white corresponds to the maximum, while mid-grey is zero. We are now only concerned with positive ''y'' values, as the screen with the slits in it forms a barrier at y=0.

[[image:Two_Slit_Interference,_800nm_wl,_0.1mm_d,_close_up.png|center]]

We can clearly see the criss-crossing pattern, but we cannot immediately see any &quot;fringing&quot; effects. This is because the fringing is a result of the wave's ''average'' value varying with position. In fact, the image does contain faint evidence of fringing. You may notice that there are approximately radial &quot;bands&quot; of wave where it changes from white to black and back again, and bands where it stays around mid grey. These will stay in position with time. Bands that run across the image are an artifact of the cyclic and progressive nature of the wave, and these will shift with time. The fringing becomes clearly visible when the wave is averaged over a period of time. The image below shows a plot of the same area, but instead of the wave frozen in time as b, it is a plot composed of many samples of the wave over time. The light area correspond to places where the amplitude of the resulting wave is high, and the black areas are where the wave has a zero amplitude.

[[image:Two_Slit_Interference,_800nm_wl,_0.1mm_d,_close_up_average.png|center]]

You can see the fringes here, but they are very close together, and would not be easily discernible to the naked eye. Also, the fringes are not perfectly radial (coming from a single point), so we cannot easily work out their spacing without plotting this graph. If we view the system (averaged as before) from much further away as below, we can see a much simpler pattern:

[[image:Two_Slit_Interference,_800nm_wl,_0.1mm_d,_distant_average.png|center]]

The resulting wave now appears to be a sequence of radial lines of alternating high and low intensity that originate from the slits (which are imperceptibly separated at this scale). As we find in the next section, this makes a very useful approximation accurate. Also, the fringes are much further apart, so we can measure the fringe separation much more easily. Beware of the apparent curved lines in the bottom corner - there are no curved lines here, but the regular grid of pixels combined with the sloping lines causes false patterns to appear. For more information on related phenomena, see [[w:Moiré|moiré]] and [[w:Heterodyne|heterodynes and beat frequencies]].

We can plot a graph of the wave at y=5m. The image below is the central maximum, over a one period of the wave:

[[Image:Two Slit Interference, 800nm wl, 0.1mm d, Central Maximum.gif|center]]

You can't see this oscillation in real life because of the immensely high frequency of visible light (hundreds of terahertz). However, we can perceive the [[w:irradiance|irradiance]] at the screen. (see [[/Irradiance|this page]] for a derivation. Now, the irradiance, ''I'', at a point on the screen is given by:

::&lt;math&gt;I=\epsilon v \langle \mathbf{E}^2 \rangle&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\langle \mathbf{E}^2 \rangle&lt;/math&gt; means the time-average of the magnitude of the electric field squared. This is an elementary result of fields theory and this is not the place to prove it. For the moment, as we are dealing with relative intensities, we will leave out the constants and set

::&lt;math&gt;I=\langle \mathbf{E}^2 \rangle&lt;/math&gt;

From the principle of superposition,

::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}=\mathbf{E}_1+\mathbf{E}_2&lt;/math&gt;

where '''E'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and '''E'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are the components of the field resulting from each slit. We can now write:

::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}^2=\left( \mathbf{E}_1+\mathbf{E}_2 \right)^2&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}^2=\mathbf{E}_1^2+\mathbf{E}_2^2+2 \mathbf{E}_1+\mathbf{E}_2&lt;/math&gt;

Time-avaraging both sides of this equation gives us:


The image below is the central 5 maxima at t=0. You can easily see the regular-looking maxima where the wave has a high amplitude, and the minima, where the wave's amplitude is very small. You should also be able to see that the variation in intensity is similar to the absolute value of a cosine wave.

[[Image:Two Slit Interference, 800nm wl, 0.1mm d, Central 5 Maxima.png|center]]

You can compare this to the fringes seen in real life (the upper pattern result from two slits, the bottom pattern from five slits):

[[Image:Diffraction-with-two-and-five-slits.jpg|centre]]

Let us now find a relationship between the physical properties of the system and the distance between the fringes.

==An Approximation for Fringe Spacing==

[[Image:Two-Slit Experiment Approximation.svg|right]]
If we make certain approximations, it is simple to find an expression for the fringe spacing in this system. Consider the diagram on the right. If shows two rays of light, one from each slit, both going the same point on the screen, which is marked by a black dot. Because the distance to the screen is much greater than the distance between the slits, the rays are essentially parallel.

Now, the lower ray has further to go than the upper ray, and we will call the difference in path length ''&amp;Delta;l''. This is marked in red on the diagram. For perfect constructive interference, the path difference must be a whole number of wavelengths:

::&lt;math&gt;\Delta l=n \lambda, \quad n=(0,1,2,\ldots)&lt;/math&gt;

Because the rays are parallel, we can see that the two angles marked ''&amp;theta;'' are identical. This means that we can determine the path difference from the angle to the point using trigonometry:

::&lt;math&gt;\sin \theta = \frac{\Delta l}{d}&lt;/math&gt;

We can also work out the distance of the point from the centre of the screen, ''s'', using ''&amp;theta;'':

::&lt;math&gt;\tan \theta = \frac{s}{L}&lt;/math&gt;

For small angles, we can make the following approximation:

::&lt;math&gt;\sin \theta \approx \tan \theta&lt;/math&gt;.

Therefore, we can write

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{\Delta l}{d}=\frac{s}{L}&lt;/math&gt;

And substituting in our value for maximum constructive interference, we get an expression for the distance from the centre line to the ''n''th bright fringe:

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{n \lambda}{d}=\frac{s}{L}&lt;/math&gt;

And rearranging gives:

::{|style=&quot; border: solid 2px #D6D6FF; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; 
|align=&quot;left&quot;|&lt;math&gt;s=\frac{n \lambda L}{d}, \quad n=(0,1,2,\ldots)&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Let's try this for our theoretical example from earlier. To find the basic fringe spacing, just set n=1 (this is the spacing between the central fringe and the first fringe to one side):

::&lt;math&gt;s=\frac{\lambda L}{d}&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;s=\frac{800 \times 10^{-9} \times 5}{0.1 \times 10^{-3}}&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;s=0.04 \mbox{ m}\,&lt;/math&gt;

This is almost exactly what we saw (it is only an approximation, so it is not technically exact). The following conditions must apply for this to work:
::*The distance from the slits to the screen, ''L'' must be much larger than the slit separation, ''d''. 
::*The angle, ''&amp;theta;'', to the fringe from the slits must be small
::*As before, the slits must be narrow enough to refract almost perfectly

#&lt;s&gt;Move all content from [[Wikibooks:Dewey Decimal Classification]] to the appropriate sub-pages.&lt;/s&gt;
#&lt;s&gt;Create Categories for all the Dewey top-level categories, and all the LOC top-level categories.&lt;/s&gt;
#Where possible, associate each bookshelf with the appropriate Dewey and LOC categories.
#Create a single template, similar to the Infobox (but smaller) that will identify the Dewey, LOC, and alphabetical classifications of a book.
#Fix the [[Wikibooks:Community Portal]], because it is not good.

== [[Wikibooks:Card Catalog Office]] ==

This page is outdated. It needs to be completely redone, but before we break any ground we need to have a clear plan of ''what this page should be''. 

=== [[Wikibooks:CCO Librarians]] ===

This page is basically useless and should probably be deleted.

=== [[Wikibooks:CCO Resources]] ===

This page has been revamped, and is now useful as-is. We can expand it more as needed.

== [[Wikibooks:All Books]] ==

This page is basically a duplicate of the [[Wikibooks:All bookshelves]] page (discussed below). It should be deleted, and all links should be updated to point to the proper locations.

== [[Wikibooks:All bookshelves]] ==
Each bookshelf needs an associated category. To do this easily, Each bookshelf will get an associated template that will automatically add books to that category. Every book on a bookshelf will get tagged with the appropriate template. This table below will also provide default values for the DDC and LOC systems for each bookshelf.

==Misplaced content==
The following was misplaced on [[Korean/Verbs]]:
:One way of using honorifics is to use special &quot;honorific&quot; nouns in place of regular ones. A common example is using [[wikt:진지|진지]] (''jinji'') instead of [[wikt:밥|밥]] (''bap'') for &quot;food&quot;. Often, honorific nouns are used to refer to relatives. The honorific suffix [[wikt:님|-님]] (''-nim'') is affixed to many kinship terms to make them honorific.  Thus, someone may address his own grandmother as [[wikt:할머니|할머니]] (''halmeoni'') but refer to someone else's grandmother as [[wikt:할머님|할머님]] (''halmeonim'').

==Misplaced content==
The following content was misplaced in [[Korean/Verbs]]:

:Pronouns in Korean have their own set of polite equivalents, e.g. [[wikt:저|저]] (''jeo'') is the humble form of [[wikt:나|나]] (''na'', &quot;I&quot;) and [[wikt:저희|저희]] (''jeohui'') is the humble form of [[wikt:우리|우리]] (''uri'', &quot;we&quot;).  However, Koreans usually avoid using the second person singular pronoun, especially when using honorific forms, and often avoid the third person pronouns as well.  So, although honorific form of [[wikt:너|너]] (''neo'', singular &quot;you&quot;) is [[wikt:당신|당신]] (''dangsin'', literally, &quot;friend&quot; or &quot;dear&quot;), that term is only used as a form of address in a few specific social contexts, such as between two married couples or in an ironic sense between strangers. Other words are usually substituted where possible, e.g. the person's name, a kinship term, a professional title, the plural [[wikt:여러분|여러분]] ''yeoreobun'', or no word at all, relying on context to supply meaning instead.

The above information probably belongs in this [[Korean/Personal pronouns]] lesson. [[User:Rodasmith|Rodasmith]] 22:17, 13 June 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Sex Tourism and Neocolonial Power Relationships in the Caribbean'''

Caribbean countries participating in the global economy have turned to tourism as their primary financial strategy.  Sex tourism has been an integral, if not explicit part of this strategy.  This paper provides evidence that colonial power relationships are perpetuated through sex tourism, exploring this theme from the macro level of global economics to the micro level of intimate sexual relationships involving tourists. Dominant themes on both levels are imbalances of power based on economic dependency and ineffective advancement strategies. Tourism marketing can be seen as the link between the macro and micro levels. Stereotypical racialized fantasies play an important role in both tourism marketing and sex tourism relationships. 

==Introduction==
Tourism has become the primary financial strategy for Caribbean countries participating in the global economy.  The tourism industry promotes an image of the Caribbean as &quot;fantasy islands&quot; based on &quot;four S's&quot;: Sun, Sand, Sea and implicitly, Sex (Campbell, Perkins and Mohammed 1999; Lowry 1993). Sex tourism, loosely defined as tourism that involves sexual relationships between tourists and locals, is a vast and growing global phenomenon that is a popular research topic. As Kamala Kempadoo (1999) suggests, sex tourism provides a clear example of how power relationships that began with slavery and colonization are perpetuated between the &quot;1st&quot; and &quot;3rd&quot; world countries through globalization processes.  Caribbean countries are forced into marketing their beaches and also their bodies as commodities to the tourist markets of North America and Europe as the Caribbean becomes a tropical playground for the globally powerful to explore their racialized fantasies.  This paper presents evidence to support the theory that global power dynamics perpetuate colonial relationships, from a &quot;macro&quot; to a &quot;micro&quot; level: 1) At the macro level global economic forces promote tourism as a development strategy in the Caribbean; 2) Tourism marketing is the middle link, and plays on persistent colonial stereotypes and fantasies; and 3) At the micro level, tourists and locals reinforce these stereotypical roles and power dynamics in their relationships.  Common themes on both the macro and micro levels are imbalances of power based on economic dependency and ineffective advancement strategies.

==Background==    

===What is Sex Tourism? ===

The lack of a consistent definition contributes to the deficiency of statistics on sex tourism, but it is estimated to be a multibillion dollar transnational industry (Mullings 1999). The sex tourism industry has been fueled by the advent and growth of the internet (Scheeres 2007). A growing consensus in the literature is that most definitions of &quot;sex tourism&quot; are too narrow, and critiques of the various research approaches and categories abound in the literature.  Opperman (1999) and Herold, Garcia and De Moya (2001), and Cabezas (2004) argue against defining sex tourism as necessarily involving the exchange of money for sex.  As Cabezas points out, involvement with tourists does not necessarily have to be sexual, and beyond monetary exchange there is the prospect of further opportunities such as for recreation, migration and marriage (2004).  Cabezas (2004) critiques the focus in research on relationships that are public and easily perceived, pointing out that many sexual relationships occur with employees of other tourism related positions, such as hotel chambermaids or taxi drivers.  The term &quot;open-ended prostitution&quot; was introduced to describe the ambiguous types of relationships such as those that are long-term or involve affection and companionship (Kempadoo 1999:25).  

Martin Opperman points out that the term sex tourism usually conjures the idea of older, out-of-shape white men traveling to developing countries for cheap sexual pleasures not available in their own countries (1999). But sex tourists are male and female, heterosexual and homosexual (Cabezas 2004, Kuar Puar 2002, Wonders and Michalowski 2001). Some tourists travel with the specific intention of participating in sexual activity, for others it is not anticipated.  Many tourists, despite their sexual intentions, do not believe themselves to be &quot;prostitute users&quot; or the locals they interact with to be &quot;prostitutes&quot; (Opperman 1999, Cabezas 2004).  

Work in the tourist sex trade in the Caribbean is characterized by a relative lack of organization, in comparison to other global markets such as Asia (Cabezas 2004, Kempadoo 1999, Pattulo 2005). In the Caribbean, many sex workers interacting with tourists are &quot;freelancers&quot; operating without middlemen such as pimps or brothel owners.  According to Polly Patullo (2005), formalized prostitution is becoming a problem in the Dominican Republic and Cuba, and that from the Dominican Republic trafficking in women between islands and to Europe is evidenced. Klaus Albuquerque states that &quot;So large is the Dominican sex industry that young women have become one of the principal exports of the country&quot; (1998:95). The bodies of Caribbean natives are another &quot;resource&quot; for wealthy first world consumption, yet another manifestation of an imbalanced economic power relationship between the global &quot;North&quot; and &quot;South&quot; that began during colonial times. 

===The Caribbean Region and its Colonial Legacy===

The Caribbean region consists of the islands framing the Caribbean Sea from below Florida in North America to near Venezuela in South America. Mainland areas in Central and South America such as Belize, which are historically and culturally considered part of the Caribbean (Pattulo 2005). The diverse area shares a heritage of slavery and colonialism, based on plantation economies (Pattulo 2005).  

The legacy of colonialism in the Caribbean has been well-covered in the literature (Canterbury 2005, Clarke 1983, Knippers Black 1997, Shankar 1999). A Caribbean &quot;pigmentocracy&quot; or social hierarchy based on skin color is an often cited as an example of colonial legacy (Albo 2006; Clarke 1983). This hierarchy can also be found within the sex tourism trade today, as &quot;Racial and sexual ordering reflects consequences and legacy of colonialism as they play out on this current stage of global capitalism&quot; (Cabezas 2004:998).  Sex has long been a part of economics in the Caribbean, such as was evidenced in the breeding of slaves, and in the use of concubines and prostitutes by colonial plantation owners (Cabezas 2004).  During slavery, many black women were mistresses to white males, and prostitution rates were high. Yet this can be seen as a strategy of women for both survival and advancement, as mistresses occasionally could get preferential treatment and through prostitution women attempted to purchase their freedom (Albo 2006). 

==The Macro-Level: Tourism as a Development Strategy==

For Caribbean countries, there was a relatively rapid transition from colonial rule to being heavily indebted and dependent on tourism. The post-colonial era in the Caribbean has been characterized by dependency on foreign trade, and an economy focused on extractive resources and export products (Pattulo 2005). In the latter 20th century, many former colonies transitioned to become nation states, yet old economic patterns of dependency on foreign investment and export economics persisted (Pattulo 2005).  

Since the 1980s restructuring of the global economic system has included structural adjustment programs (SAP's) enforced by the international lenders for the repayment of debts. Most SAP's have involved drastic reductions in public spending and focus on resource extraction and export production and  foreign investment has been encouraged and benefited from national laws (Kempadoo 1999).  The results of SAP's in the Caribbean region have included a rise in unemployment and poverty, leading to a &quot;search for new survival strategies at both community and national levels&quot; (Kempadoo 1999:19).  One of the main &quot;new survival strategies&quot; has been the promotion of tourism. 

In 1995 the Caribbean Tourism Organization stated &quot;Trading blocs such as the NAFTA and the European Community have made it increasingly difficult for traditional Caribbean manufacturing and agricultural industries to remain competitive, giving tourism an even higher priority throughout the region&quot; (Pattulo 2005). Tourism has been promoted by the United Nations, the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as an effective strategy for debt-ridden countries' participation of in the global economy.  

Despite the promotion of tourism as a development strategy, most tourist resorts are controlled by foreign investors and outside corporations, which coupled with the promotion of all-inclusive packages purchased in the tourists' home countries has meant that capital continues to accumulate in industrialized nations rather than in the host countries, a phenomenon referred to as &quot;leakage&quot; (Kempadoo 1999, Wyllie 2000). Management and higher positions within the tourist industry are often filled by people from the companies' home countries, while jobs created by tourism that are available to locals are service-oriented and low-paying, meaning that often tourist-oriented prostitution is more lucrative or can provide desperately needed additional cash (Wyllie 2000).  This illustrates how global forces promote sex tourism, as people struggle to earn a living in an economy that keeps them and their countries in a position of disadvantage.    

Within Caribbean countries, the dependence on foreign exchange combined with the lack of work fuel migration to cities or tourist areas for employment.  Sex is but one of many services that can be offered to tourists in order to earn a living.  Although sex tourism is often maligned as a form of harassment and &quot;threat to the industry&quot; (Mullings 1999:55), sex tourism may actually be tacitly encouraged by governments and the tourism industry because of heightened attraction and profits (Kempadoo 1999). Government responses to sex tourism range from official regulation or informal tolerance (Kempadoo 1999). Because of the variety of activities that fall within the practices of sexual tourism, regulation can be difficult.  In most Caribbean countries prostitution falls under &quot;gray areas&quot; of the law, and is usually not itself illegal. Arrests are often based on &quot;harassment&quot; of foreigners, and usually involve arbitrary sweeps of unaccompanied and often racially profiled women (Cabezas 2004, Kempadoo 1999, Sanchez-Taylor 2001). Amalia L. Cabezas (2004) points out that because tourism is a major source of income generation for the state, a reliance on former colonial powers for economic stability is perpetuated.  And sex sells.

===Promoting Tourism and Sex: Bodies and Beaches  ===

Caribbean tourism has been branded and marketed based on the West's imaginary idea of &quot;tropical paradise&quot; (Henshall Momsen 2005, Sheller 2004).  As Janet Henshall Momsen points out, &quot;the word ‘Caribbean' conjures up Kodachrome images of azure seas with matching skies framing green palm trees along unblemished white sand beaches, awaiting Robinson Crusoe's footprint&quot; (2005:209). In 1492 Christopher Columbus, the first white tourist, wrote to King Ferdinand, &quot;Sire, these countries far surpass all the rest of the world in beauty&quot; (in Henshall Momsen 2005:209).  Henshall Momshen states that &quot;Thus the region's first publicist sold the image of an Edenic, unspoiled paradise to attract investment and visitors half a millennium ago. Little since has diminished tourists' fascination with islands&quot; (2005:209).  Lowry (1993) states that tourism advertisers rely on a sign system, informally known as the four S's of tourism advertising: Sun, Sand, Sea and Sex. This has been particularly prevalent in promoting tourism in the Caribbean. Lowry's analysis of tourism advertisements includes one from the Dominican Republic Ministry of Tourism, featuring a young, attractive couple in a very sexualized pose on a beach lounge chair on a deserted beach, with a tropical bird perched above them and the caption &quot;The Perfect Vacation All Year Round: The Dominican Republic, Where Dreams Have a Special Way of Coming True&quot; (1993:195). Other suggestive marketing slogans include &quot;It's better in the Bahamas&quot; (Sheller 2004:33).  Mimi Sheller further illustrates how the sexualization of ‘exotic' bodies has become a standard promotion tool of the Caribbean tourist industry and &quot;feeds into the development of sex tourism in the region&quot; (2004:33).  She describes a British Airways magazine article that promises that in Jamaica ‘you'll be in the nearest thing we have on earth to the Garden of Eden, and to make it even better, it's after Eve tempted Adam with the apple' (2004:35).  Sheller concludes that this promotion strategy lends to tourists &quot;hedonistic abandon to its associated sexual temptations without guilt&quot; and that &quot;the transgression of moral boundaries serves to reinforce the constitution of geographies of difference that define the North as ‘civilised' and the Caribbean as ‘unreal', like ‘going back in time'&quot; (2004:35).  These constructions of difference are fundamental in understanding what &quot;fuels&quot; sex tourism.  As Wyllie discusses, &quot;tourism is whorism&quot; when &quot;Like many prostitutes, poor countries have few economic alternatives at their disposal, and have little to sell but their physical attractiveness&quot; (2000:81), and the marketing strategies involved in this commoditization cater to and reinforce the stereotypical gendered and racial fantasies of the potential tourists. 

==The Micro-Level: Power Dynamics within Sex Tourism Relationships==

===The Role of Racial Stereotypes in Sex Tourism Relationships===

Culturally produced racialized fantasies play a role in the demand for sex tourism. Research shows that a large percentage of sex customers seek sex workers whose racial, national, or class identities are different from their own (O'Connell, Davidson and Sanchez 1999). Sex tourists say that sex is &quot;more natural&quot; in 3rd world countries, perceiving prostitution as proof of this belief (O'Connell Davidson and Sanchez Taylor 1999).  This justifies the use of prostitutes for tourists who would not patronize them in their own countries, and they do not perceive themselves as participating in prostitution.  Further, the idea of &quot;naturalness&quot; of prostitution in the third world reassures the tourist of their cultural superiority, continuing the traditional Western idea of the opposition between the &quot;civilized&quot; West and the &quot;barbarous&quot; Other (O'Connell Davidson and Sanchez Taylor 1999). Research finds this is true for both male and female sex tourists. 

Many researchers have examined the phenomenon of female tourists who visit the Caribbean in search of &quot;romance&quot; with local men. In their study of tourist interactions with Jamaican male hustlers or &quot;rent-a-dreads,&quot; Deborah Pruitt and Suzanne La Font coined the term &quot;romance tourism&quot; to distinguish these relationships from male &quot;sex tourism&quot;, under the rationale that neither the women nor the local men consider their relationship to be prostitution, and due to their &quot;emphasis on courtship&quot; (1995:423).  Klaus Albuquerque (1998) challenged this distinction, arguing that there is essentially no difference between female and male tourists, with the prime motivation being &quot;sexual fantasy as it is derived from racist mythology,&quot; for women that being the hypersexualized black male, and for men the &quot;hot mulatta&quot; (1998:92). O'Connel Davidson (1998) similarly believes that females are just as exploitive as males in using their greater economic power to gain access to third world partners.  Herold, Garcia and DeMoya (2001) further explored the distinction, actually interviewing female tourists who interacted with Dominican &quot;beach boys&quot; (and taking Albuquerque to task for not doing so) and stressing the importance of the females belief that they are engaging in consensual romantic relationships and suggesting a continuum of romance/sex motivations for both male and female tourists. Sanchez Taylor (2001) points out that the problem with the argument between &quot;sex versus romance&quot; tourism lies in essentialist understandings of male and female sexuality, and a privileging of gendered power over racialized and economic power. She points out that ideas of racial &quot;otherness,&quot; particularly racist ideas about &quot;hypersexuality,&quot; played a key role in allowing women tourists, like male tourists, to ignore imbalances of age and economic power (2001:759-60). 

Both male and female sex tourists seem to be seeking an idealized encounter, seemingly stemming from their frustrations with gender relations in their home countries, as many of the men's and women's complaints sound very similar. According to Robert Wyllie some men feel &quot;they are losing out in the ‘battle of the sexes'&quot; (2000:83). Ronnie Shawe (2001) found that male sex tourists in Costa Rica harbored complaints about women from their home countries based on this idea. One man stated that &quot;The average American woman figures she doesn't need a man anymore. Women here like the traditional role,&quot; while another said &quot;American women are too independent and strong minded, it's intimidating,&quot; and yet another felt that:  &quot;... American women have lots of hang-ups, they're afraid of commitment and, worst of all, sex,&quot; and according to another  &quot;... my former girlfriend was more interested in her career, pets, and even her mother more than me&quot; (2001: no page).  According to Pruitt and LaFont, the women seem similarly frustrated with men from their own cultures, complaining that they are &quot;inattentive, preoccupied with careers, unemotional, or confused about their male role...&quot; (2004:320).  

While men are often seeking &quot;submissive&quot; women in contrast to the liberated women at home, Pruitt and LaFont described the romance tourists as seeking the &quot;archetypal masculine&quot; (2004:324) and state that while many women are seeking or enjoying control and power in their relationships the &quot;are simultaneously drawn to conventional notions of masculinity&quot; (2004:331). According to Jaqueline Sanchez Taylor, &quot;tourism allows both male and female sex tourists to seek experiences that are ‘fictionalized, idealized or exaggerated models' not simply of social life, but of social relations of power&quot;(2000: 51).  

Sex workers servicing tourists in the Caribbean enact the racial stereotypes and fantasies of the tourists, thereby reinforcing them. As Polly Patullo states, &quot;Tourists whose expectations of the Caribbean are of one long bacchanal are rewarded by dollar-seeking locals, who cannot afford to be bothered too much by stereotyping&quot; (2005:109). Denise Brennan (2004) found that women's &quot;performances&quot; of being in love with their foreign partners was a crucial strategy in their success and &quot;while male clients delude themselves into thinking that brown-skinned women prefer them sexually to their own men,&quot; according to Dominican sex workers the main reason they &quot;entered the trade&quot; was for earning more money (Sharpe and Pinto 2006: 254). Similarly, Ronnie Shaw (2001) found that male tourists seemed unaware of how the sex workers actually felt, that racialized ideas about &quot;Latin&quot; women as being innately more sensual helped them rationalize the relationships. In his interviews with male sex tourists in Costa Rica, he found that western men make cultural assumptions about Latin women, and that the women sex workers manipulate these assumptions in their sexual transactions, perpetuating the stereotypes (2001). The phenomenon of &quot;romancing,&quot; or creating aura of friendship and romance, is seen in research on both males females sexually servicing tourists, drawing attention away from the underlying economic motivations and creating the feeling that the relationships occur &quot;naturally&quot; and are mutually desired (Kempadoo 1999:25).

===Sex Tourism as an Advancement Strategy ===

Sex with foreigners for monetary gain can be seen as a strategy for survival and advancement, much as it was in colonial times. But studies show that advancement is quite difficult, also much as it was in colonial times.  Denise Brennan's book, What's Love Got to Do With It? (2004) an ethnographic anthropological study of the sex tourism culture in the town of Sosua in the Dominican Republic, demonstrates through the stories of women's daily lives that despite the hopes of the women, sex work is in fact not a path to social mobility, and that most of the sex workers ended up in the same economic situation (or worse) than when they started.  Brennan confesses &quot;I had set out to write a feminist ethnography of the sex trade to raise questions about poor women's power, control and opportunities in a globalized economy. Yet the waters are murky when considering women's agency in the sex trade, no matter how determined and creative their efforts to get ahead&quot; (2004:211). In their review of Brennan's book, Sharpe and Pinto point out that this admission is a &quot;sobering reminder of how globalization has deepened rather than eliminated poverty&quot; (2006:256). 

Economically, sex tourism interactions involve disparities in wealth, with the tourists having the upper hand.  Female sex workers and &quot;beach boys&quot; catering to tourists, are  economically disadvantaged people who are hoping that tourists hold the key to a better life, an escape from poverty.  According to one woman interviewed by Brennan &quot;We come here because we dream of a ticket&quot; (2004:306).  And according to Pruitt and LaFont, the Jamaican male hustlers hope that getting involved with a foreign woman will &quot;provide them with a way out of their limited circumstances&quot; (2004:322). In both situations, the rare relationships that do provide some benefits usually do not last, as Brennan states that most women &quot;leave the sex trade with little more than when they arrived&quot; (2004:303) Similarly, Pruitt and LaFont describe the disappointment and conflicts that develop in relationships between the women tourists and the &quot;Rastas&quot; when the economic dependency becomes more evident (2004).  

Thus, several important factors interplay in sex tourism relationships, including social factors, such as power relationships and cultural and gender stereotypes, as well as economic factors such as the disparities in wealth between the sex workers and the tourists. These relationships mirror the economic and political dependency of the host country on that of the tourists.  

==Discussion/Conclusion==

As Kempadoo observes, &quot;that sex industries today depend upon the eroticization of the ethnic and cultural other suggests we are witnessing a contemporary form of exoticism which sustains post-colonial and post-cold war relations of power and dominance&quot; (1995:75-6). This paper has attempted to provide evidence to support the theory that neocolonial global power relationships between the &quot;global North&quot; and the Caribbean are perpetuated through sex tourism. On the &quot;macro level&quot; sex tourism, like colonial relationships, is characterized by economic inequality and the dependence of the Caribbean region on the global North. Caribbean countries, remaining economically marginalized as they were under colonialism, turn to tourism to bring in needed funds and pay off debts. The tourism market is the wealthy nations of the north, and to sell themselves to these consumers the Caribbean region must rely on old fantasies of tropical paradise. The perpetuation of racial stereotypes and fantasies through the imagery of tourism industry marketing...  On the micro-level, the importance of race and economic power is revealed on an individual level within intimate relationships, where both men and women of the global north can use their privileged positions to access the bodies of Caribbean natives.  These dynamics are perhaps more subtle than under colonial or slavery conditions, but that doesn't mean they are any less wrong, only more insidious. In the Caribbean, impoverished people and impoverished nations sell themselves to the wealthy global north because they have little alternative. And the global north is buying.

according to (hopefully not only) [http://www.uvm.edu/~cmazzoni/3grammatica/grammatica/possessives.html la grammatica italiana] the examples are presenting '''possessive adjectives''' and not '''possessive pronouns''' !   ... the latter should replace a noun, but in fact the nouns are quite visible.</text>

'''Sheer lashing''' uses two or three spars or poles, 15 - 20 feet of rope.

To tie a sheer lashing, lay the two poles side-by-side and parallel to one another.  Tie a clove hitch around one spar.  Then wrap the free end of the rope around both spars about seven or eight times.  Pull them as tight as you can.  Then make three fraps around the lashing, and again, pull the rope as tight as you can.  Finally, tie a clove hitch on the second spar.

To use sheer lashing around with three poles, lay all three poles side by side and parallel to one another.  Tie a clove hitch on one pole, and wrap the rope around all three seven or eight times.  Pull the rope tight.  Make three fraps between two of the poles, then cross over and make three more between the other two poles.  Pull the frapping as tight as you can and finish it off with a clove hitch.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The most fundamental thing about playing the cello, of course, is how to hold it ''while'' playing. The cello is held with the sides of the kneecaps resting on the bottom points of each c-bout, with the C-peg resting just behind the left ear. The left hand is used to press the strings, and should be angled so that the thumb is roughly in the middle of the neck and directly behind the middle finger, and the wrist is roughly straight. The feet are not a critical part of playing technique, and while many recommend placing the feet flat on the floor to fascilitate good posture, or simply out of etiquette, many players are known to use their foot as a makeshift metronome to tap out a time. Proper technique will develop in the individual based on personal preference and style, so although there is a correct posture for the cello, don't let that stop you from developing your own style. With certain parts of posture, like foot positioning, if there is no widely accepted &quot;way&quot; to position yourself in that aspect, roll with what works best for you.

The back should be kept straight while playing. Slumping or slouching while playing will not only decrease your ability to manoeuver the bow arm and left hand, but will cause lower back pain if continued for long periods of time. It is recommended that the player sit near the edge of his/her chair while playing. It can help make playing more comfortable and the arms easier to manoeuver about the instrument, as well as prevent the back of the cello from hitting the chair, which can make playing uncomfortable, and can damage the instrument.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The bow is held by the right hand, at the '''frog''', the black endpiece of the bow. Bowhand is not a strict requirement that must be conformed to ''exactly''. Obviously, as one plays and learns from their experience, they will develope a more personalized bowhand. However, the bowhand remains ''mostly'' the same for each player. The thumb is placed on the gap between the '''bowgrip''', the rubber grip on the bottom portion of the bow and the frog. The index finger is placed ahead of the thumb, near the middle of the bowgrip. The middle finger is positioned roughly on the line between the end of the frog and the start of the bow hair. The ring finger is placed roughly in the middle of the frog. Finally, the pinky is placed on the side of the screw. The bow should also be held with a straight wrist.

This will insert the requirements and all the country-invariant answers that have been added to date.  You can then start adding the rest of the answers and editing answers we ''thought'' were invariant.  

You can edit the main template [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Arts and Crafts/Currency - Advanced (Template)|here]], but keep in mind that it should only have generally applicable answers (i.e., country-invariant answers).

=== Anti-counterfeiting measures ===

''Selection from'' [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterfeit#Anti-counterfeiting_measures Wikipedia]

In the 1980s counterfeiting in the Republic of Ireland twice resulted in sudden changes in official documents: in November 1984 the [[W:Irish punt|£1]] postage stamp, also used on savings cards for paying television licenses and telephone bills, was invalidated and replaced by another design at a few days' notice, because of widespread counterfeiting. Later, the £20 [[W:Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland|Central Bank of Ireland]] Series B banknote was rapidly replaced because of what the Finance Minister described as &quot;the involuntary privatization of banknote printing&quot;.

In the 1990s, the portrait of Chairman Mao Zedong was placed on the banknotes of the People's Republic of China to combat counterfeiting, as he was recognized better than the generic designs on the [[W:renminbi|renminbi]] notes.

In Australia, the original paper decimal currency banknotes introduced in 1966 were eventually replaced with new designs printed on clear polyester film which allowed them to have &quot;see through&quot; sections that are almost impossible to duplicate with a photocopier.

==4. Attend a meeting of a local coin club and report on your experience. Possible items to consider: &lt;br&gt;a. Level of expertise of members as demonstrated by presentations and dialogues.&lt;br&gt;b. Average general age of attendees. &lt;br&gt;c. Ideas which might help the club extend its collector interest to a wider audience. &lt;br&gt;d. How newcomer friendly is the organization. &lt;br&gt;e. Suggestions on how these people might be reached with the gospel through a manner which they would find attractive. ==

==5. Select one of the three categories of your collection as required under the Currency Honor requirements 7 and 8, and increase your collection to include twice the total number of specimens. ==

''Requirements 7 &amp; 8 reproduced below for simplicity''

 Requirement 7. Collect and mount a type set of coins from your country of any date 
                currently being minted or in circulation. Proof, commemorative, rare,
                silver, or expensive coins are not needed. In your collection:
                a. Possess at least one coin from each mint in the type set.
                b. Locate and identify the mint mark (if any) on each coin.
                c. Locate and identify the initials (if any) of each coin's designer(s).

 Requirement 8. Do two of the following:
                a. Make enlarged drawings of both sides of ten different denominations or
                   forms of coins for your country no longer in circulation.
                b. Collect, identify, and mount 25 different foreign coins. No two coins alike.
                c. Collect and mount a type set of coins from your country minted during the 20th Century.
                d. Collect and mount a date set of series of coins for your country beginning 
                   with your birth year. (Commemorative, gold, proof, expensive, or rare coins need not be included.)

==6. Add to your collection at least one of the unusual (odd and curious) forms learned about in requirement 1 of the Currency Honor requirements and have in your Currency Honor files, at least a paragraph summarizing how, when and where this item was used as currency.==

''Requirement 1 reproduced below for simplicity''

 Requirement 1. Relate briefly the story of barter, showing three reasons why money came into
                being and naming at least ten strange forms of money used in place of coins or currency.

I really like using D for Deadly Bleeding, as it reinforces that there needs to be a &quot;wet check&quot; (aka &quot;gross blood check&quot; or &quot;Rapid Body Survey&quot;). How do we feel about using D for that, and finding another way to integrate AED in another section. We could have a chapter on more advanced aspects of first aid, such as AED and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (which is currently included in [[First Aid/B for Breathing|B for Breathing]], which I don't like)?? So AED and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (and possibly some other stuff) would get moved to a chapter called &quot;Advanced First Aid Topics&quot; or something, and D would turn into a section on deadly bleeding, which would remove that section from [[First Aid/External Bleeding|External Bleeding]].

Defibrillation does not deal with patients who are in Cardiac Arrest. Cardiac Arrest is when the heart stops, a defibrillator cannot re-start a stopped heart. (A defib machine can stop a heart to give you something to work with when doing CPR.) This is why AEDs will not shock a victim whose heart is stopped, as there is no electrical signal to be read. Just a note to look into. --[[User:Nugger|Nugger]] 23:56, 15 July 2007 (UTC)

If you familiar with [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OGNL OGNL] then key value coding is a bit like that.  We'll call key value coding KVC in the context of this page to abbreviate.  KVC also exists in the Cocoa infrastructure shipped with MacOS-X as well as the OPENSTEP infrastructure.  In this page we will focus on KVC in the context of WebObjects and java.

== Conceptual Aspects ==

Consider the following model segment;

[[Image:ModelForKVCArticle.png]]

This model shows a number of entities and the lines between the entities show relationships.  For example, the Organisation entity has a to-one relationship with a Worker called &quot;workerAccount&quot; and it also has a &quot;to-many&quot; relationship to &quot;OrgRegion&quot; called &quot;orgRegions&quot;.

The term &quot;instance&quot; here is referring to a specific organisation.  For example, &quot;The Corn Flour Company&quot; and &quot;Aqua Breweries&quot; might be instances of the Organisation entity.

=== Value For Key ===

An instance of an Organisation can supply values for the keys &quot;address&quot;, &quot;countryIso&quot;, &quot;email&quot; etc... and they will return a value for the key.  It is essentially acting like an NSDictionary or a Map object.  This is how data is extracted from an object.

=== Take Value For Key ===

This is where an instance of an entity is asked to &quot;take up&quot; some value for a key.  For example, an instance of an organisation might be told to take the value &quot;foo@foo.co.nz&quot; for the key &quot;email&quot;.  This is how data is loaded into an object using KVC.

=== Value For Key Path ===

Using a dotted path, it is possible to traverse relationships to access data in other entities.  For example, if you have an instance of &quot;OrgExpertise&quot;, it is possible to get the value for the key path &quot;organisation.workerAccount.name&quot;.  This is how you can extract data from the interconnected network of object instances.

=== Take Value For Key Path ===

Using a dotted path, it is possible to get an object in the interconnected network of object instances to &quot;take up&quot; some piece of data.  For example, if you have an instance of &quot;OrgExpertise&quot; then it is possible to get the object to &quot;take up&quot; a value of &quot;Joe Smith&quot; for the key path &quot;organisation.workerAccount.name&quot;.

[[Image:Continuous-lashing.jpg|thumb|right|500px|Continuous Lashing]]

'''Continuous Lashing''' is a fun technique. It is used to create shelves, tables, and other structures.

''Comments on the pictures on the right'''
# Support poles under the 'surface' poles.
# Attach string to the support pole using a clove hitch.
# Clove hitch, up over surface pole, back down &amp; cross under below support pole, and up over the second surface pole.
# Detail of lashing as seen from top.
# Detail of lashing as seen from bottom. Inset shows details of clove hitch, and cross-under below support pole.
# View from the top.


&lt;hr&gt;


* Start with a string/rope that is 4 or 5 times longer than the length of your project. 
* Find the middle/center of the string and attach it to one of the support poles.
* Put one of the surface sticks on top of the support pole and bring both ends of the string over this surface stick.
* Continue back down below the support pole.
* Cross the string under the support pole.
* Bring it back up and over the next surface stick and then back down and cross under the support pole.
* Repeat for the remaining surface sticks.
* End off with a square knot when all the surface sticks are attached.

      <text xml:space="preserve">According to classical physics, electrons should behave like particles - they travel in straight lines and do not curve in flight unless acted on by an external agent, like a magnetic field. In this model, if we fire a beam of electrons through a double slit onto a detector, we should get two bands of &quot;hits&quot;, much as you would get if you fired a machine gun at the side of a house with two windows - you would get two areas of bullet-marked wall inside, and the rest would be intact.

[[image:Two-Slit Experiment Particles.svg|centre]]

This was the behaviour noted for years. However, if the slits are made small enough and close enough together, we actually observe the following:

[[image:Two-Slit Experiment Electrons.svg|centre]]

This means that the electrons are ''diffracting'' through the slits and ''interfering'' with each other just like waves.  This means that the electrons have wave-particle duality, just like photons. In this case, they must have properties like wavelength and frequency. We can deduce the properties from the behaviour of the electrons as they pass through our diffraction grating.

Recall the property relating wavelength to diffraction fringe spacing that we found [[Materials in Electronics/Wave-Particle_Duality/The_Two-Slit_Experiment/Ideal|earlier]]:

::&lt;math&gt;s=\frac{\lambda L}{d}&lt;/math&gt;

where
:*''s'' is the fringe spacing
:*''&amp;lambda;'' is the wavelength
:*''L'' is the distance from slits to screen
:*''d'' is the grating spacing

If we can get electrons to diffract through a known grating, we can obtain a wavelength for the electron. This could also be derived theoretically, but it requires relativity, and is certainly a non-trival exercise. Practically, it turns out that electrons have an extremely short wavelength, so we cannot make gratings fine enough to diffract them significantly using traditional methods. However, we can use crystals as they are essentially extremely regular gratings with a spacing on the order of nanometres.

If we use an electron gun to produce our electrons, and fire these electrons though a crystal with a known atomic structure, we can work out the wavelength of the electron experimentally. This leads to a description of the electron as a wave. This is expanded on [[Materials_in_Electronics/Wave-Particle_Duality/Electrons as Waves|here]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
The time value of money is the premise that a fixed amount of money available today is more valuable/desired than the same amount of money available in the future.
This premise can be generalized for economic resources (of which money is an embodiment by social contract).
We can state two reasons to justify the premise for all resources:
1) We prefer to have in our control a resource today rather than in the future, because of the inherent uncertainty that characterizes any future event. We cannot be certain that we will acquire the resource in the future.
2) We prefer to have in our control a resource today rather than in the future, because we could use to our favor this resource in the meantime (this is a temporal version of the notion of &quot;opportunity cost&quot;).

Especially for money, there is a third reason, namely the existence of inflation: given inflation, the same amount of money will buy tomorrow fewer goods than today. 
It must be noted however that while Uncertainty of the Future and Opportunity Cost, are rooted in the very foundations of human existence, inflation is a historical event that may change direction. In the case of &quot;negative inflation&quot;, ie where money increases rather than loses its value as time passes, then &quot;money tomorrow&quot; tends to be more valuable than &quot;money today&quot; (or at least, it partially offsets the pull of the other two fundamental reasons given above towards the opposite direction). Nevertheless, in modern market economies, a consistent trend of negative inflation is absent for almost a century.

A fourth reason is the belief that maybe the money might not be around in the future.  The borrower might not be around or the repayment contract could be lost.  The currency could be abolished or a catastrophy could occur rendering money valueless.

==The Discount Rate==
The time value of money can be easily quantified at a personal level. A person can ask herself, &quot;What do I prefer, 100 euros today or XXX euros in a year from now?&quot;
When she finds the amount that makes her &quot;indifferent&quot;, then she can calculate easily her Personal Discount Rate.
Assume that given the question, &quot;100 euros now or 120 euros in one year from now,&quot; a person replies, &quot;it's all the same to me&quot;.
Then this person's Yearly Personal Discount Rate (YPDR) is calculated as

                           &lt;math&gt; YPDR = (120/100)-1 = 1,2 - 1 = 0,2 = 20%&lt;/math&gt;

and in general terms

                         YPDR = (Equally preferred value in a year / Value today)-1

Note that YPDR quantifies together the effects of all the reasons given above that lead to &quot;money tomorrow&quot; being worth less than &quot;money today&quot;.

If a person has calculated his own YPDR honestly, carefully, and rationally, and has tested it over a period of time for stability of preferences, he can then use it as a tool to assist him in taking economic decisions than involve different amounts and timings of money (to be given or to be received). Essentially, by using the discount rate, we can calculate what amount of money received or given today is -for us- equivalent with an amount of money to be received (or to be given) in the future.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The term annuity is used in finance theory to refer to any terminating stream of fixed payments over a specified period of time. This usage is most commonly seen in academic discussions of finance, usually in connection with the valuation of the stream of payments, taking into account time value of money concepts.

An annuity can be valued with the following formula, where C is the amount of the payment, r is the discount rate, and t is the number of periods for which the payment will be received.

PV&lt;sub&gt;annuity&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;math&gt;C\left[\frac{1}{r}-\frac{1}{r\left(1+r\right)^t}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, we can see that a 10 year, $100 per year annuity would be worth $614.46 with a 10% discount rate.

We can also find the present value of an annuity whose payments grow by a fixed rate g.

PV&lt;sub&gt;growing annuity&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;math&gt;{C \over (r-g)}\left[ 1- \left({1+g \over 1+r}\right)^t \right] &lt;/math&gt;

Solving a similar problem, with a payment of $100 that grows at a rate of 5% for 10 years, with a 10% discount rate, we get a present value of $743.98.

Note that the preceding two formulas assume that the payment will be made at the end of each period. If the payment is to be received at the beginning of each period, it is called an '''Annuity Due'''. The preceding two formulas can still be used in the case of an annuity due, with some modification. Simply subtract 1 from the number of periods, and then add the amount of the payment to the resulting answer. For example, if the first problem we did were an annuity due, it would look like this:

PV&lt;sub&gt;annuity due&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;math&gt;100\left[\frac{1}{0.1}-\frac{1}{0.1\left(1.1\right)^9}\right] + 100&lt;/math&gt;

The answer, of course, is $675.90. Note that an annuity due will always have a higher present value than an equivalent standard annuity, due to the time value of money. That is, a dollar received at an earlier date is more valuable than a dollar received at a later date.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Scratch Introduction ==

Welcome to learning about Scratch!

When you first start Scratch, you will see something that looks like this:

[[Image:Scratch 1.4 Initial Screen.png|500px]]

It is important before you begin to understand some basic ideas about Scratch.  Scratch is a very visual programming language, and is mainly concerned with two major elements:  The '''stage''' and '''sprites''' (or actors) who perform on that stage.

Each sprite (and the stage itself) has three major parts:

*scripts - this is how you tell the stage and sprites to &quot;do their stuff&quot;
*costumes/backgrounds - these are images which are added to Scratch which allow you to see the sprites.  Each sprite can have multiple costumes, allowing a sprite to change its appearance.
*sounds - Not only can sprites appear and change, but they can also &quot;speak&quot; and tell a story.  This can also include sound effects and background noises, which can also appear on the stage as well.

Scripts are made up of graphical blocks that each look something like this:

[[Image:Scratch Move Block.png]]

There are nearly a hundred different kinds of blocks that you can use within your Scratch projects, and each one does something just a little bit different.

== Language Options ==

It should also be pointed out that Scratch is available in multiple written languages.  If you click on this button:

[[Image:Scratch Language Button.png]]

You will see a list of 13 different languages like this:

[[Image:Scratch Language Options.png]]

What is useful about this tool is that the text of the blocks for Scratch scripts will change if you select a different language.  An example of the move block &quot;translated&quot; into German would look like this:

[[Image:Scratch Gehe block.png]]

Scratch will also &quot;remember&quot; the language you select, so you do not need to select a new language each time you start Scratch.  When Scratch projects are saved, they are not saved in a specific &quot;written&quot; language, but instead are saved as a &quot;move block&quot; or a &quot;say block&quot; and are &quot;translated&quot; into the language of the person using Scratch to see the script.  This allows Scratch projects to be shared between people from different cultures and countries, and is one of the strengths of this computer language.

== Extra Help ==

[[Image:Scratch Extra Help.png]]

Clicking on the &quot;Want Help?&quot; button will automatically open your default web browser to the Scratch website help pages.  These include some quick reference guides available in Adobe Acrobat&amp;trade; format, some '''&quot;Scratch Cards&quot;''' which are small trading-card like short ideas on how to use Scratch, and some video tutorials on learning the basics about Scratch.

Some of these files are included when you install the Scratch software on your computer, but others can only be downloaded from the main Scratch website.

Thanks for your contributions to the [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Nature/Cacti]] Cacti honor.  It's ''very'' nice to have input like yours.  If you have any questions at all, drop me a note on my [[User_talk:Jomegat|Talk page]].  Thanks again! -- [[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] 14:02, 2 May 2007 (UTC)

You're welcome. ~lw

: Hi lw,
: I noticed you just uploaded a picture of a cactus.  That's a good thing and all, but it would be better to upload that sort of thing to commons.wikimedia.org so that it can be used by other projects as well (such as Wikipedia).  The only pictures I upload to wikibooks are ones that are &quot;free use&quot; or not generally applicable to other projects.  Thanks again for all your work on the book!  --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] 01:44, 22 May 2007 (UTC)

* Grrrr! And I thought I was doing good. Oh well - another thing learned today! ;&gt; ~lw 01:55, 22 May 2007 (UTC)
** Don't get down on yourself.  I uploaded about a dozen pictures to Wikibooks before anyone clued me in.  Also, this is a very minor thing.  There are lots of photos on Wikipedia that are not in the commons.  I've migrated several.  --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] 02:08, 22 May 2007 (UTC)

* Ooooooh! This is going to help me greatly! Now I don't have to agonize over 'taking' photos and releasing them into the PD. Commons will do '''just''' fine. I'd taken a photo today to exhibit 'panning' for the Photography honor, but you already beat me to it.  ~lw 02:58, 22 May 2007 (UTC)

** It's kinda hard to find those kinds of photos on the commons because they are organized and categorized by what's in the picture rather than by photography technique - that is, you can't really search for &quot;blurry background&quot; or &quot;rule of thirds.&quot;  I had to try to imagine a picture that might demonstrate the effect and search for ''that''.  I searched for &quot;runner&quot; for one and &quot;mountain&quot; on the other.  Oh - one other thing.  When you think an honor is finished (cacti?) please go ahead and edit the index pages (i.e., mark [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Nature]] as 100% and add the finished honor to the list on [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book|the front page]].  If you like, you should also announce that it's finished on the PF forum (which I see you have joined, assuming there is only one lwan98 in the world). -- [[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] 14:48, 22 May 2007 (UTC)

==Printing==
* Waiting for input from my printing contacts to finish up #5. ~lw 15:39 17-May-2007 Central.
* All requirements filled out ~lw 11:47 18-May-2007 Central.

==Radio, Advanced==
* Not many requirements here. Provided write up and links to relevant sources to pursue the necessary technical license. ~lw 13:00 18-May-2007 Central.

==Shorthand==
* I looked at Shorthand. It looks complete. ~lw 13:12 18-May-2007 Central.
: I think I did all the editing on the Shorthand honor, but did not think it was substantial enough to use to teach (or learn) the honor.  The example of shorthand shows the Lord's Prayer, and I was having a difficult time decoding it given the info I was able to scare up and put in there.  If you know shorthand (I don't) and you think this is enough, I won't complain if you mark it as 100% complete. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] 01:42, 21 May 2007 (UTC)
* Figured out the error in my thinking. Leaving it as incomplete, since it is not a skill that is easily transferred in the normal Pathfinder setting. ~lw 06:66 21-May-2007 Central.

== About the Author ==

Hi Lwan98,

If you like, you could create an [[About the author/Lwan98]] page and then include it at the bottom of any honors you write the answers to like this:

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
{{:About the author/Lwan98}}
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

I have done this on the honors I have answered if I have any related credentials or expertise on the matter (for example, [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Vocational/Radio Electronics]]).  Of course you do not ''have'' to do this at all, but I think it adds a human touch and adds some credibility to the whole project.

: BTW, nice About the author page. ;-) It is of course, totally OK to remain anonymous.  --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] 02:09, 22 May 2007 (UTC)

:: I did leave a picture. Of course, it's a forest/trees thingy. ;&gt; ~lw 15:31, 22 May 2007 (UTC)

== Division honors ==

Hey LW,

I've been thinking that when I originally laid out this wikibook that I should not have put anything in the Division hierarchy.  Having a [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Division]] page is OK, but I think storing honors under there was prolly a bad idea.  After all, none of the NAD honors are in the Division category.  Do you think I should move them to their respective categories (i.e., move [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Division/Video]] to [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Vocational/Video]])?  I'd keep the Division page and change all the links.  I'd also leave the redirects in place, so that anyone who went to where they are now would still find them (but in the new place). --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] 00:41, 23 May 2007 (UTC)

* I think that they should be stored under their respective categories. They should also be listed under the Division, but linking to them under the categories, and leaving out the percentages. ~lw 01:19, 23 May 2007 (UTC)

::OK - that's two people out of two who think that should be done, so I'm going to go ahead and start moving things.  Then I'll go back through and relink.  Since you're working on the Video honor, I'll save it for last or wait until tomorrow.  BTW, if you start a line with a space (and maybe a tab, I'm not sure), the wikimedia software thinks you don't want it to do any formatting and outlines the text with a dotted line.  That's useful if you're writing a module about software and want to show a code listing (just in case you were wondering why that happens.)  To indent, start the line with a colon.  To indent more, use more colons.  Also, some images you added to the Cacti honor earlier today did not show your caption - that's because the caption only shows if you give it the &quot;thumb&quot; or &quot;frame&quot; property.  I added &quot;thumb&quot; for you.  It took me a ''long'' time to figure that one out.  --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] 01:28, 23 May 2007 (UTC)

* I'm learning - I'm also trying to remember to Preview first, so that I can see the error of my ways. That dotted line worked out great for Typewriting. ~lw 01:34, 23 May 2007 (UTC)

* What about a box/shortcut/exploder, similar to the warning at [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Recreation/Dutch Oven Cooking]], under the 'Honor Header' but before the 'Contents', that would acknowledge the division that introduced the honor? No, not a warning, but, some kind of acknowledgement. Thoughts? ~lw 02:25, 25 May 2007 (UTC)
::The honor_header template should probably indicate the division instead of the GC.  I think most of them do, but I could be mistaken. -- [[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] 03:05, 25 May 2007 (UTC)
:::Ah, I see it now - my bad. ~lw 03:15, 25 May 2007 (UTC)

== Commons ==
* How do I get images from Wikipedia into Commons? [[W:Plastic_canvas|Train &amp; Canvas]]? ~lw 03:26, 23 May 2007 (UTC)
: It's a bit involved, but not ''too'' bad.  First you have do download them to your PC.  I use Firefox, so I can just right-click on the image and &quot;save-as&quot;.  Make sure you save the highest resolution image they have available.  Then I go to [http://tools.wikimedia.de/~magnus/commonshelper.php this tool] and enter in the name of the image as it is named on Wikipedia, and click &quot;Get text&quot;.  This will take a few minutes, but what it is doing is gathering all the info about the image it can divine (including original authors, etc).  When that is finished, I copy the text it generates with a ctrl-C.  Then go to the commons and click &quot;Upload&quot;, browse to the saved image, and paste in the text generated by the tool.  Finally, hit &quot;Upload&quot;.  Here it is again, bulleted:
:* Save image to PC
:* Generate text using [http://tools.wikimedia.de/~magnus/commonshelper.php this tool]
:* Copy generated text to paste buffer (ctrl-C)
:* Go to the commons' upload page
:* browse to saved image
:* paste in text.
:* Hit the Upload button.
:That's pretty much it.  It's easier than it sounds, and if you have trouble, let me know. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] 03:36, 23 May 2007 (UTC)

* Are these images in Wikipedia available to be put into commons? [[W:Bargello_%28needlework%29|Bargello (needlework)]] The four images middle to bottom on the page that have some kind of license tag. ~lw 14:46, 23 May 2007 (UTC)

: Yes.  The creator licensed them under the GFDL, so they'll be fine. It's refreshing to work with someone who ''cares'' about the licenses! --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] 16:47, 23 May 2007 (UTC)

==Robots &amp; Archivers==
* is there a way to have a robots.txt file so that the '''search engines''' and '''internet archivers''' ''exclude'' specific pages like user talk and about the author pages?  (yes, i understand that it only works for those who actually behave by the rules) ~lw 03:32, 25 May 2007 (UTC)
: I dunno.  You could ask on the [[WB:SL|Staff lounge]].  Most books don't have an About the Author section, and I'm not even sure it's a sanctioned practice.  But you could ask about the User: and User_talk: namespaces.  If there's a way to exclude the User namespace, you could put your About the Author page under there, a la [[User:Lwan98/About the Author]].  Or you could just not have one.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">*Nuclear chemistry is just arithmetic with two variables - charge and mass.
*proton + electron = neutron
*2 protons + 2 neutrons = alpha particle(Helium-4 Nucleus)
*electron = beta particle
*energy = gamma ray emission
*proton = neutron + positron

===Nuclear Stability===
*Anything with 83 protons (Bismuth) or more is radioactive. Small stable molecules have a neutron:proton ratio of approximately 1:1. More massive ones have a ratio of 1.5:1.

*Isotopes can also be radioactive, an example of this is carbon-14 which is used in carbon dating only has 6 protons but is radioactive .

===Half Life===
The half life of an isotope is time it take for half of a sample to decay.  It can vary from very small times(fraction of second) to millions of years.  Knowing the half life of a substance allows radioactive dating to be done.  The relative abundance of the isotopes in a sample compared to the original abundance can be used to determine the age of the specimen.
*ln(percent remaining) = -k(time)
*half-life = ln(2/k)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Skits to Help High School Students Learn Choice Theory
Material from William Glasser, M.D.&lt;br&gt;
Modified By Dee and Valerie&lt;br&gt;

'''Purpose:'''&lt;br&gt; 	
This skit can be used as a classroom discussion starter for eighth to twelfth grade students who are in the process of learning choice theory. Both students and teachers can use the skits to get the feel of how different this classroom is.  

'''Characters:'''&lt;br&gt;
Five tenth grade students, three boys and two girls who are learning choice theory in some depth from their new English teacher. These students are close friends and often hang around together.  

'''Setting:'''&lt;br&gt;	
School cafeteria after lunch. 

'''The New Teacher:'''

Jeff:  I like our new English teacher; she’s really cool.&lt;br&gt;

Kim:  What’s cool about her?&lt;br&gt; 

Amy:  She’s so friendly. I mean like she doesn’t even yell at us. 
She’s always calm. She’s kinda weird.&lt;br&gt;

Kim:  I think it’s weird because she doesn’t have a normal name. All she has are two initials. She wants us to call her C.R.&lt;br&gt; 

Tom:  I like calling her C.R. That’s cool. I asked her what they stood for and she said, “When I get to know the class better I’ll tell you.”&lt;br&gt;

Ken:  Yeah, she’s really cool. Like this morning when that jerk that sits behind me kept poking me with his finger, I turned around and started yelling at him to stop. She just watched us for a minute. Then she walked over and quietly asked if she could help us solve the problem.&lt;br&gt;

Amy:  I saw that. She didn’t say anything else. She just asked if she could help with the problem.&lt;br&gt;

Kim:  She didn’t have to say anything else. You both stopped yelling and it was over.&lt;br&gt;

Tom:  But you let him get away with it. You know he’ll just do it again.&lt;br&gt;

Ken:  I didn’t feel like it. It was her quiet voice and the way she looked at both of us. It’s like she doesn’t want to make a big deal out of a little trouble. She wasn’t even angry.&lt;br&gt;

Kim:  But I did see her talking to you for a moment before you left class. What was that about?&lt;br&gt;

Ken:  Nothing. She said she appreciated me calming down and suggested I try to be friends with him. He’s new and probably lonely. Then she smiled at me.&lt;br&gt;

Jeff:  You aren’t going to make friends with him, are you? He’s a jerk.&lt;br&gt;

Ken:  Big deal. He didn’t hurt me. It’s tough being a new kid in high school.  That little talk we had after class, she didn’t have to do that. She cares about me. She doesn’t treat any of us like kids.&lt;br&gt; 

Jeff:  That’s how I feel. She treats us like we we’re being good even if we’re not. That’s weird.&lt;br&gt; 

Amy:  She does but I’m not sure she should do that.  I think she should have done more than look at you. You were yelling. Even though you shut up, she should have said something.&lt;br&gt;

Ken:  But she did later before we left. She even said I should make friends. I told that to the kid and we shook hands. No teacher ever suggested that. I think we should all make friends with him.&lt;br&gt; 

Jeff:  Yeah, like she trusts us to do the right thing.  She’s not goin’ to change. Trusting us is the way she is. &lt;br&gt;

Amy:  I’ve talked to my mother about how C.R. trusts us and doesn’t yell or punish us. My mother says punishment builds good character. My Dad agrees with her. &lt;br&gt;

Jeff:  But remember what she did yesterday when the new kid kept talking and refused to shut up. He was giving her a real hard time.&lt;br&gt;

Tom:  She told him to go to the office and he’s still gone.&lt;br&gt;

Kim:  She didn’t get angry or raise her voice. She just told him she’d never learned how to teach when a student keeps talking and she asked him to please go to the office.  She talked real soft but I did hear her tell him, don’t worry, you’ll be okay. No one is going to punish you.&lt;br&gt;

Ken:  I know why he hasn’t come back. He rides on my bus and I’ve been talking to him. He told me he’s in the “connecting room” and he likes being there.&lt;br&gt;

Amy:  What’s the connecting room? I never knew we had one.  Where is it?&lt;br&gt;

Ken:  Amy, like you’ll ever see that room. He’s been telling me about it. It’s for kids who make trouble.  He says he’s doing work now in that room. He says the kids in the connecting room like him and the teacher helps him with the work. He says they don’t have to be totally good but after the first few days most of them are.&lt;br&gt; 

Amy:  What do they do in there?&lt;br&gt; 

Ken:  They talk a lot to each other and the teacher. They also do assignments. C.R.’s been bringing him the English work and he’s been doing it. The teacher there helps all the kids catch up with their work.&lt;br&gt; 

Jeff:  How many are in there?&lt;br&gt; 

Ken:  He says usually around nine.&lt;br&gt;  

Tom:  Why do they call it the connecting room?&lt;br&gt; 

Ken:  He says kids who make trouble are mostly like him, they don’t have enough friends in school. The teacher helps them to connect with each other in the room. The teacher uses the word connecting for making friends. That teacher is like C.R. He doesn’t yell or punish either.&lt;br&gt; 

Kim:  Did you ask him if he’s ever coming back?&lt;br&gt; 

Ken:  He said the teacher in that room doesn’t want him to come back until he can figure out how to get along in class. We’ve been getting along fine on the bus. I told him I’d be his friend if he’d come back to our English class.&lt;br&gt;

Tom:  But he never did much work in here. Why’d he change?&lt;br&gt; 

Ken:  He told me he’s learning something they call choice theory from the teacher and it’s helping.&lt;br&gt; 

Kim:  I wonder if C.R. is going to teach us choice theory.&lt;br&gt; 

Ken:  I asked her that and she says she’s going to start next week. It’ll only take us fifteen minutes a week and if we like it we’ll do it once a week every Friday.&lt;br&gt; 

Jeff:  Well, at least we know why she’s like she is. She must be using that choice theory or whatever.&lt;br&gt; 

Amy:  I guess she’ll expect us to use it, too.&lt;br&gt;  

Tom:  I asked her that and she said that all she wants is for us to learn it. We don’t have to use it if we don’t want to. Haven’t you noticed how she’s been saying choosing this and choosing that since she came here? She says we choose everything we do.&lt;br&gt;

Kim:  She says if it’s a choice we can always make a better choice.&lt;br&gt; 

Ken:  That’s what the kid on the bus told me. He’s choosing to learn it and he’s getting along better with the kids in that room. He says he’s looking forward to coming back to our class.&lt;br&gt; 

Jeff:  But this is school. We never get a chance to choose anything. They even make us come here.&lt;br&gt; 

Kim:  Maybe she’s figured out if she tries to make us we won’t want to.&lt;br&gt; 

Jeff:  But we’re teenagers. Everyone makes us do every thing. If we don’t, they punish us.&lt;br&gt; 

Jeff: I like learning about the basic needs. It was neat to find out I have a need for fun. More teachers need to know about what we need.&lt;br&gt;

Amy:  Yeah, the needs were easy to learn.&lt;br&gt; 

Tom:  She’s going to pass out a handout and a test that we can take it home just like homework.&lt;br&gt; 

Amy:  But we’ll have all the answers on the handout. We’ll get them all right. What kind of a test is that?&lt;br&gt; 

Tom:  That’s what I asked her and you know what she said.  She said she wants us to get them all right. If we get an answer wrong we can keep working on it until we get it right. She said we really don’t learn much from making mistakes but we learn a lot by correcting them.&lt;br&gt;

Jeff:  I’d sure like to hear more about how to do that. I never get all the answers right on a test.&lt;br&gt;

Amy:  She lets the kids who didn’t answer the way she wanted to keep working until they got it. That wasn’t fair. I should get a better grade because I got every one right the first time.&lt;br&gt; 

Kim:  I don’t think we got away with anything. I’d rather take a test once than have to keep working on it.&lt;br&gt;  

Jeff:  One kid had to work on it for two more nights. He had to get help from his parents. But in the end he got the answers the way she wanted. He was okay with it.&lt;br&gt; 

Tom:  A couple of girls didn’t take the test at all and she didn’t do anything to them. She’s not kidding. She really doesn’t punish.&lt;br&gt;

Kim:  I was curious. I asked the two girls why they didn’t take the test.&lt;br&gt;

Amy:  What did they say?&lt;br&gt;

Kim:  They hate tests. They like talking about choice theory in class when we’re learning it but they won’t take a test on it. They said that was okay with C.R. She told them to participate when we discuss it. They’d still learn a lot.&lt;br&gt; 

Kim:  But the questions C.R. asks are a lot different from most of the questions I’ve ever had on tests. They’re not really harder, they’re just different.&lt;br&gt;

Amy:  I kind of like them. I guess she wants to find out if we can think and if we really know it.&lt;br&gt; 


'''A Note:'''&lt;br&gt;
We’ve modified Glasser’s skits into a more concise one that is, we hope, interesting and informative. Enjoy!

* C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt; is '''oct'''ane

=== Alkyl groups ===
An alkyl group is a radical of with a certain number of carbons and is of the general formula C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2n+1&lt;/sub&gt; that has had one of its hydrogens removed, freeing up one of its bonds. This allows it to bond to a carbon (or oxygen, etc.) in a compound, and form more complex compounds.

==Functional Groups==
*Alcohols contain OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, e.g. C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;OH is ethanol or ethyl alcohol.
[[Image:Ethanol-structure.png|100px]]
*Alkanes have the general formula of C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2n+2&lt;/sub&gt; and are saturated (i.e. they only contain single bonds), such as methane(CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and propane (C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;).
[[Image:Propane-2D-flat.png|100px]]
*Alkenes have the general formula of C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2n&lt;/sub&gt; and are unsaturated (i.e. they contain double/triple bonds), such as ethylene(C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).
[[Image:Ethene-2D-flat.png|100px]]
*Alkynes have the general formula of C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2n-2&lt;/sub&gt; and are unsaturated, such as ethylyne (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).
[[Image:Alkyne general.svg|100px]]
*Amines contain nitrogen, and resemble ammonia structurally.
[[Image:Amine-2D-general.png|100px]]
*Nitriles contain a '''nitrile group'''(CN&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;).

=== Skeletal formulae ===
Skeletal formulae are very important in organic chemistry for two reasons: (1) they appear very frequently, and (2) they make sketching organic compounds much easier.
Consider the following image.
[[Image:Butane-skeletal.png|100px]]
The image to the left is butane (C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;). As you can see however there are no Cs and Hs written on the sketch. Carbons are represented by the vertices at the ends of the line segments. The line segments themselves represent (as normal) single bonds. The hydrogens are not drawn in, but are there, because all carbons form four bonds. Because butane is saturated, the hydrogens have to attach to the carbons, where they can still form bonds.
[[Image:Ethylene-2D-skeletal.png|100px]]
The image to the left is ethene (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). As you can see, there are two line segments in this sketch. When two or three line segments appear superincumbently, they represent double and triple bonds respectively (as they do in the structural formulae).
[[Image:Benzene both.svg|100px]]
This is another important concept in organic chemistry. Since its discovery thousands of new organic chemicals have been created, based on this one component. The formula for benzene is C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. Benzene occurs commonly in organic chemicals called aromatics, as seen to the right (in aspirin).
[[Image:Aspirin.png|100px]]
Carbon and hyrdrogen (although hydroxide (OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;) is written out as well) are the only two elements that are not indicated with their chemical symbol in skeletal formulae; they are called implicit. Other common elements in organic chemistry such as nitrogen, chlorine, florine,  and oxygen are indicated with their chemical symbols; they are called explicit, and are seen to the right. Remember the symbol R is any alkyl group. Alkyl groups should be considered explicit.

==Other Naming Conventions==
=== Naming alkanes, alkenes, and alkynes ===
# Determine if the compound is saturated or unsaturated
## If it is saturated, it is an alkane, and takes the suffix ''–ane''
## If it is unsaturated
### And has double bonds, it is an alkene, and takes the suffix ''-ene''
### And has triple bonds, it is an alkyne, and take the suffix ''–yne''
# Find the main chain by counting the number of carbons starting at one end of the compound, and goint to another end, without counting a carbon twice (keep some of the later steps in mind). Then, based on this number of carbons select a prefix from the chart in the prefixes section above.
## If it is an alkane, just use the suffix from step 1.1.
## If it is an alkene, use the appropriate suffix from step 1.2. Then, place the number of the carbon where the double/triple bond begins, making it the lowest number possible, and separate it from the number-of-carbons prefix and suffix with hyphens (e.g. but-2-ene ). Note that C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; (the first carbon in the main chain) should be based on this step. It also seems to be acceptable to place the number before the name of the main chain (e.g. 2-butene)
# If the compound is an alkene, then another element can be added to the name.
## If the parts of the compound separated by the double bond are on the same side of the double bond, then the prefix ''cis-'' is added before the name of the main chain (e.g. cis-but-2-ene).
## If the parts of the compound separated by the double bond are on different sides of the double bond, then the prefix ''trans-'' is added before the name of the main chain (trans-but-2-ene).
# Identify if the compound has alkyl groups.
## If there are, determine how many there are, and where they are relative to C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.
### The number of the carbon where the alkyl group attaches to the main chain is placed before the name of the alkyl group, and this is placed before the name of the main chain (e.g. 2-methylbutane)
### If there are more than one type of alkyl group, the alkyl groups are named in alphabetical order, and separated by commas (e.g. 3-ethyl,4-methyhexane)
### If there are more than one of a certain type of alkyl group, the carbons where they attach are separated by commas, and a prefix based on their number is added (e.g. 2,2-dimethypropane). A list is provided below.

=== Alkyl group prefixes ===
{| class=wikitable
| Number of groups || prefix
|-
| 1 || none
|-
| 2 || di-
|-
| 3 || tri-
|-
| 4 || tetra-
|}

===Examples===
[[Image:2-methylhexane-2D-skeletal.png| thumb| left | 200px]]
# The compound is saturated, and therefore is an alkane.
# The main chain of carbons contains six carbons (''hex-'').
# It is not an alkene.
# The compound has one alkyl group (methyl) connecting at C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

This compound’s name is 2-methylhexane

[[Image:2,3-dimetilbutāns.svg | thumb | left | 200px]]
# The compound is saturated, and therefore is an alkane.
# The main chain contains four carbons (''but-'').
# It is not an alkene.
# The compound has two alkyl groups (both methyl) connected at the C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

The name of this compound is 2,3-dimethylbutane

[[Image:Skeletal-formulae-internal-double-bond.png| thumb | left | 200px]]
# This compound is unsaturated and is an alkene (double bonds).
# The main chain has six carbons (''hex-''), and the double bond is at C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.
# Disregard step 3.
# The compound has no alkyl groups.

The name of this compound is hex-3-ene or 3-hexene.

[[Image:Skeletal-formulae-terminal-triple-bond.png| thumb | left | 200px]]
# This compaound is unsaturated and is an alkyne (triple bonds)
# The main chain has six carbons (''hex-'')
# Disregard step 3.
# the compound has no alkyl groups

The name of this conpound is hex-1-yne or 1-hexyne.

===Isomers===
*Structural - carbons are arranged differently.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== A Closed Set ==

===Properties of the Interior of a Set ===
The last item in the &quot;Properties of the Interior of a Set&quot; talks about &quot;A&quot; being &quot;open&quot;, but this is before the section which defines what an open set is. What's worse, proof of this property is left as an exercise to the reader, but there's nothing to prove since this is exactly the definition of an open set that's introduced later on. Am I missing something or does this need fixing? {{unsigned|71.37.2.6}}
:No your not missing anything.  Even though the proof is painfully trivial, it still needs to be proved.  But your correct if follows immediately.  Something does need to be fixed, the concept of open should probably come before interior.  I won't have time to rework it but your welcome to try if you like. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub]][[Special:Contributions/Thenub314|314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 06:33, 7 June 2011 (UTC)
::If the concept of open set is defined in terms of int(A) = A, and you put it before the concept of interior, we'd end up with the same issue. Also, regarding the proof exercise: the property ''is'' the same as the definition of open set. There is nothing to prove. They only differ in notation (prose vs. &lt;=&gt;), but they say exactly the same. I'd suggest just removing that line: it doesn't provide any substantial information (open sets are covered afterwards anyway) and it can easily lead to confusion. [[Special:Contributions/85.58.134.159|85.58.134.159]] ([[User talk:85.58.134.159|discuss]]) 22:10, 28 April 2013 (UTC)

===Open vs Closed===
&quot;In \R, under the regular metric, the only set that is both open and closed is \R&quot;. What about the empty set? [[User:SuneJ|SuneJ]]

===Metric Space Example: Hölder's inequality===
Two lines above where it says &quot;This is called Hölder's inequality&quot;, there is a line that seems not to be a valid result of the previous line. I think to make it valid you would have to have c^p the sum of the absolute values of c &lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;. If this is the case, what is stated as Hölder's inequality was already given a couple lines earlier, with a and b instead of c and d.

== Internal points ==

Hello

I have seen these called interior points, not internal points.  And, in Royden's ''Real Analysis'', there is a separate definition of something called an internal point.  It has to do with convexity and is related, I believe, but is different.  Is &quot;internal&quot; a standard name or would interior be better?

Thanks

== Open Ball / Graphics ==

The graphics in section &quot;Open Ball&quot; are nicely rounded, but is that really appropriate for a mathematical text? Is there any consensus here? --[[User:Jerome Baum|Jerome Baum]] ([[User talk:Jerome Baum|talk]]) 08:21, 24 November 2009 (UTC)

: I agree. The graphics are incorrect and possibly misleading. The corners should be perfectly sharp.[[Special:Contributions/130.243.130.84|130.243.130.84]] ([[User talk:130.243.130.84|talk]]) 10:20, 18 September 2010 (UTC)
: I agree too.  These must change - they are too misleading.  --[[User:JamesCrook|JamesCrook]] ([[User talk:JamesCrook|talk]]) 11:05, 9 January 2011 (UTC)

{{Ay prerequisite|Arts and Crafts|Currency}}
==2. Select a coin or note from your collection and present an oral or written report on the historical or other significance of the person(s), place(s), item(s) or symbol(s) found on both sides. ==

==3. What are the laws regarding counterfeiting in your country and what devices are used in your nation's currency to prevent it? ==

=== European Union ===
In preparation for the arrival of the Euro on the continent on 1 January 2002, all Member States, bear an obligation to co-operate fully in the fight against currency counterfeiting.  To reflect this, the EC has passed two Regulations – 1338/2001 and 1339/2001 (both passed on 28 June 2001) – each of which is intended to prevent counterfeiting of the new Euro notes and coins.

Regulation 1338 places obligations on those Member States which have adopted the Euro as their single currency; Regulation 1339 then extends these obligations to the other Member States.   Article 6 of the former requires the Member States to implement “effective, proportionate and deterrent sanctions” on institutions which fail to withdraw and hand over counterfeit Euros to the country’s ‘Competent National Authorities’.

Individuals who fail to withdraw counterfeit Euros from circulation will be liable to up to two years in prison and those who fail to hand them in to the proper authorities could be fined.

* [http://europa.eu/scadplus/leg/en/lvb/l33136.htm EU Fight Against Counterfeiting]
* [http://www.interpol.int/Public/FinancialCrime/CounterfeitCurrency/faq.asp Interpol on what to do about counterfeits]

=== Anti-counterfeiting measures ===

====Banknotes====
Many security features have been incorporated into the euro banknotes. They will help you to recognise a genuine banknote at a glance.

* The notes have raised print – a special printing processes give banknotes a unique feel.

* Look at the banknote against the light for a watermark, a security thread and the see-through number. All three features should be seen from the front and back of genuine banknotes.

* Tilt the banknote and on the front, you should see the shifting image on the hologram. On the back, you should see the glossy stripe (on the €5, €10 and €20 banknotes) or the colour-changing number (on the €50, €100, €200 and €500 banknotes).

Also see [http://www.ecb.int/bc/euro/banknotes/security/html/index.en.html Security Features on Euro banknotes]

====Coins====
Euro coins have machine-readable characteristics. They can be used in vending machines throughout the euro area - no matter where they were issued.

* A sophisticated bi-metal and sandwich technology have been incorporated into the €1 and €2 coins.
* The material of the 10, 20 and 50 cent coins is a unique alloy (Nordic gold), which is difficult to melt and used exclusively for coins.

Additionally there is lettering around the edge of the €2 coin and a unique metal composition is used for the 10, 20 and 50 cent coins to protect against counterfeiting. 

Also see [http://www.ecb.int/bc/euro/coins/security/html/index.en.html Security Features for Euro coins]

==4. Attend a meeting of a local coin club and report on your experience. Possible items to consider: &lt;br&gt;a. Level of expertise of members as demonstrated by presentations and dialogues.&lt;br&gt;b. Average general age of attendees. &lt;br&gt;c. Ideas which might help the club extend its collector interest to a wider audience. &lt;br&gt;d. How newcomer friendly is the organization. &lt;br&gt;e. Suggestions on how these people might be reached with the gospel through a manner which they would find attractive. ==

''Search Suggestions''

* [http://dir.groups.yahoo.com/dir/1600062367 Coin Collecting groups on Yahoo! Groups]

==5. Select one of the three categories of your collection as required under the Currency Honor requirements 7 and 8, and increase your collection to include twice the total number of specimens. ==

''Requirements 7 &amp; 8 reproduced below for simplicity''

 Requirement 7. Collect and mount a type set of coins from your country of any date 
                currently being minted or in circulation. Proof, commemorative, rare,
                silver, or expensive coins are not needed. In your collection:

      <text xml:space="preserve">A GlobalID (often called a GID) is an object which can be used to uniquely identify an instance of an entity.  For example, if you have an entity called &quot;Trucks&quot; then GIDs can be used to identify which truck is being considered.  The superclass EOGlobalID can be used through the EOF API, but its concrete subclasses are used in specific situations.  These are described below, but often you do not need to consider what sort of GID you actually have.

== Key Global IDs ==

An EOKeyGlobalID is used to uniquely identify an instance of an entity that is already stored in a database.  Here is an example of how the truck table might look.

{|border=&quot;1&quot;
!id (primary key)
!license plate
!purchase timestamp
|-
|42352
|RU1993
|2002-09-28 12:00:00
|-
|42355
|AA3335
|2006-05-01 11:00:00
|-
|42376
|QW7733
|2007-01-01 14:00:00
|}

The primary key is carried inside the EOKeyGlobalID to identify the instance of the entity which is effectively the row in the database.  In this example, the EOKeyGlobalID that contains the key 42355 would be a unique identifier for the Truck with the data containing the number plate AA3335.

== Temporary Global IDs ==

EOTemporaryGlobalID-s are used when instances of an entity are still only in memory.  This happens when you are creating new data because the instances do not yet have rows stored in the database.  The EOTemporaryGlobalID uses a long string that composites various pieces of information to make an identifier which is unique not only in the system you are running, but between systems as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Table_made_with_lashings.png|thumb|400px|Top view of a table made from two trees, two poles, and several shorter spars]]
A camp sink need not be any more than a few large containers placed on a table.  For the containers, you can use a large salad bowl or a plastic storage tub.  The table to place them on can be constructed by finding two trees at least {{units|20 cm|8 inches}} in diameter and about {{units|2 meters|6 feet}} apart.  Then using square lashing, attach two long poles to either side of the trees, at waist-height.  Use continuous lashings to lash several shorter poles across the support poles to make the table surface.  The short poles should all be as close to the same diameter as possible, or if that's impossible, arranged from smallest to largest.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Most outdoor outfitters carry camp showers, but the trick is setting up a showering area that will  provide clean feet and privacy.

Clean feet can be had by building a platform similar to the table shown above, except that it need not be lashed to any trees - it can simply lie on the ground.  If you do not build a platform, you will create a mud hole when you shower, and then everything will be clean ''except'' your feet.  Somehow the mud on the feet have a way of migrating elsewhere too, rendering the whole showering experience an exercise in futility.  Don't scrimp on the rope when attaching the spars to the poles - the platform ''must'' be secure and stable, and the spars must not roll around.  Lash them down ''securely''.

For privacy, you can bring a tarp, and string up an enclosure using trees for support.  Make the enclosure large enough to hold a chair so the freshly cleaned Pathfinder can remain freshly clean as he/she dries off, gets dressed, and puts on his/her shoes.

*Heel spur first described in 1900 as exostatic plantar bone formation at the insertion of the plantar fascia
**Plantar heel spur - into calf
**Dorsal heel spur - into Achilles tendon
*Overall prevalence estimated 8-10%
*Symptoms: extensive pain under heel, may radiate into lower leg. Usually gait and mobility impairment
*Treatment: as for osteoarthritis; decreasing weight-bearing, NSAIDS, corticoid crystal suspensions, local anesthesia, iontophoresis, microwave/ultrasound
*RT considered a &quot;last resort&quot; approach for refractory cases
**RT dose 3 Gy total in 0.5 Gy/fx twice weekly effective


*'''Wiesbaden, 2007''' (Germany) (1990-2002) PMID 17453376 -- &quot;Demographic, clinical and treatment related predictors for event-free probability following low-dose radiotherapy for painful heel spurs - a retrospective multicenter study of 502 patients.&quot; (Muecke R, Acta Oncol. 2007;46(2):239-46.)
**Retrospective. 502 patients with painful heel spurs. Low-dose RT. Median F/U 2.1 years
**RT: 6 or 10 MV beam: 5 Gy in 10 fxs twice weekly, or 5 Gy in 5 fxs twice weekly; 175 kVP beam: 6 Gy in 6 fxs three times weekly
**8-year EFS: 61%; prognostic factors: only one RT course, age &gt;58, megavoltage photons
**Conclusion: low-dose RT very effective for painful heel spurs

*'''Offenbach, 2007''' (Germany) PMID 17225939 -- &quot;Radiation Therapy for Painful Heel Spurs : Results of a Prospective Randomized Study.&quot; (Heyd R, Strahlenther Onkol. 2007 Jan;183(1):3-9.)
**Randomized. 130 patients with painful heel spurs. RT low-dose 3 Gy in 0.5 Gy/fx twice weekly vs. high-dose 6 Gy in 1.0 Gy/fx twice weekly
**Outcome: 6-month excellent/good LD 66% vs. 68% (NS)
**Conclusion: RT effective, shouldn't give more than 3 Gy</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Input and Unit Resolution==
==Definition 26==
Given a set of clauses &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. The inference rule input resolution is resolution, such that one parent clause is a clause from &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.
The inference rule unit resolution is resolution, such that
at least one parent clause is a unit clause or a unit factor of a
parent clause.

In an obvious way the notions of unit (input) derivations and
refutations are defined.

==Theorem 10 ==
For a set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; of clauses there exists a unit refutation iff there
exists an input refutation.
Unit resolution (and hence input resolution) is not complete for full
first order logics!

For Horn clauses, however,  it is a complete strategy and indeed, it
is the basis for the SLD-resolution principle, which is the core of

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Parkour}}

Parkour exercises often focus on compound, functional (e.g. pertaining to real-life situations) movements. The movements are intended to build strength and agility rather than bulk.  Following is a brief outline of some common exercises.

[[File:2009 PKTO.jpg|thumbnail|300px|A ''traceur'' doing a handstand push-up.]]
== Before You Begin ==
In order to help prevent injury, a proper warm-up is essential for a traceur. A warm-up might take 10-20 minutes but it should leave you feeling energized and alert. A successful warm-up may include:
* ''Joint rotations'', paying attention to shoulders, knees, elbows and wrists, which are often injured in Parkour.
* ''Aerobic activity'' until the muscles feel warm, such as jumping jacks or spot running.
* ''Dynamic stretching'', such as the Burpee (below).

== Exercises ==

*'''[[/The Burpee|The Burpee]]'''
''The Burpee is rumored to have developed in maximum security prisons. In such facilities, inmates are not allowed exercise equipment, so the burpee was developed by the prisoners to keep themselves in good physical condition.''
*'''[[/The Muscle-Up|The Muscle-Up]]'''
''A Muscle-Up is an excellent general conditioning exercise, which engages most of the arm, shoulder, back, and core musculature.''
*'''[[/The Handstand Push-Up|The Handstand Push-Up]]'''
''This exercise works the core and arms.''
*'''[[/The Pull-Up and Chin-Up|The Pull-Up and Chin-Up]]'''
''The Pull-up is a upper-body arm exercise. It requires a sturdy bar, above your shoulders but low enough for you to reach it and it must be able to support your body weight. When this exercise is done with an underhand grip (palms facing you) it is a chin-up, chin-ups put more emphasis on your biceps where pull-ups put more emphasis on your lats''
*'''[[/The Push-Up|The Push-Up]]'''
''The push-up (or press-up) is a basic upper body exercise that targets many muscles in your arms and chest.''
*'''[[/The Squat|The Squat]]'''
''The squat is a total leg workout exercise. It doesn't require any equipments but can be done with weights to add resistance and there are many variations to keep yourself interested.''
*'''[[/The Lunge|The Lunge]]'''
''The lunge trains the legs, hips, and - if done properly - the core.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">In M1 you learnt the five formulae for motion with constant linear acceleration:
:* &lt;math&gt; v = u + at \,&lt;/math&gt;
:* &lt;math&gt; s = ut + \frac {1}{2} at^2 &lt;/math&gt;
:* &lt;math&gt; s = \frac {1}{2}(u+v)t &lt;/math&gt;
:* &lt;math&gt; v^2 = u^2 + 2as \,&lt;/math&gt;
:* &lt;math&gt; s = vt - \frac {1}{2} at^2 &lt;/math&gt;

We can consider motion with constant angular acceleration in the same way:
:* &lt;math&gt; \omega _1 = \omega _0 + \alpha t \,&lt;/math&gt;
:* &lt;math&gt; \theta = \omega _0 t + \frac{1}{2} \alpha t^2&lt;/math&gt;
:* &lt;math&gt; \theta = \frac{1}{2}(\omega _0 + \omega _1)t&lt;/math&gt;
:* &lt;math&gt; \omega _1^2 = \omega _0^2 + 2\alpha\theta&lt;/math&gt;
:* &lt;math&gt; \theta = \omega _1 t - \frac{1}{2} \alpha t^2&lt;/math&gt;

While the first set of formulae cover the displacement, velocity and acceleration in terms of straight-line distance, the second set cover the same quantities but for rotating objects.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==SLD Resolution==
In this section we will introduce a special form of linear resolution
for Horn clauses. We will interpret a clause a program by notationing
it in the following form:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
A &amp;  \gets &amp; &amp; &amp; \text{program clause (fact)} \\

A &amp; \gets &amp; B_1, \ldots, B_n &amp;&amp; \text{ program clause }\\ 

&amp; \gets &amp; B_1, \ldots, B_n &amp;&amp; \text{ goal }\\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

==Definition 27==
Let &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; be a set of program clauses. Assume a
selection function, which gives for a given goal &lt;math&gt;\gets A_1,
\ldots, A_n&lt;/math&gt; one of its subgoals &lt;math&gt;A_i&lt;/math&gt;.
Further assume a goal &lt;math&gt;G_i = \gets A_1, \ldots, A_m, \ldots, A_n&lt;/math&gt; and a selection
function which selects &lt;math&gt;A_m&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;C_i = A  \gets  B_1, \ldots, B_q&lt;/math&gt; be a
variant of a clause in &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;C_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G_i&lt;/math&gt; have no
variable in common. If &lt;math&gt;\theta_{i+1}&lt;/math&gt; is most general unifier of &lt;math&gt;A_m&lt;/math&gt; and
&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;,  the goal
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
G_{i+1} = \gets( A_1, \ldots, A_{m-1}, B_1, \ldots, B_q, A_{m+1}, \ldots, A_n) \theta_{i+1}
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
is called SLD-resolvent

==Definition 28==
An SLD-deduction (-refutation)of &lt;math&gt;P \cup \{ G\} &lt;/math&gt; for  a set of
program clauses &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and a goal clause &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a linear deduction
(refutation) in which only SLD-resolution steps occur and &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the
start clause.
  
*An  &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-computed answer substitution &lt;math&gt; \theta&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;P \cup \{ G\} &lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\theta_1 \circ \ldots \circ \theta_n |_{Var(G)}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\theta_1, \ldots,   \theta_n&lt;/math&gt; are the mgUs from a SLD-refutation of &lt;math&gt;P \cup \{ G\} &lt;/math&gt; with selection function &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;. 
*A substitution &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;Var(G)&lt;/math&gt; is an answer substitution for   &lt;math&gt;P   \cup \{ G\} &lt;/math&gt;. 
*It is a  correct answer substitution for   &lt;math&gt;P   \cup \{   G\} &lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;P \models \forall G \theta &lt;/math&gt;
==Theorem 11==
Let &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; be a set of program clauses, &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; a goal clause and &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; a
selection function. For every correct answer substitution &lt;math&gt;\theta &lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;P
\cup \{ G\} &lt;/math&gt;, there is an  &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-computed answer substitution &lt;math&gt; \sigma &lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;P \cup \{ G\} &lt;/math&gt; and a substitution &lt;math&gt;\gamma &lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;\theta = \sigma \circ \gamma \; |_{Var(G)}&lt;/math&gt;

In the Section on Propositional Logic we already explained
propositional tableaux and its variants, like the connection calculus
and model elimination. In this section we will give model elimination
in the first order case. Note that we need one more inference rule,
the reduction rule, in this case

==Definition 29==
A clause (normalform) tableau for a set of clauses &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;  is a tableau
for &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, whose nodes are literals from &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; and which is constructed by 
a (possibly infinite) sequence of applications of the following rules:

*The tree consisting of root &lt;math&gt;true&lt;/math&gt; and immediate successors     &lt;math&gt;L_1, \cdots , L_n&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;C = L_1, \cdots , L_n&lt;/math&gt; is a new variant of a clause from &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a tableau for &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; (initialisation rule).   
*Let &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; be a tableau for &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; a branch of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;C=L_1, \cdots ,L_n&lt;/math&gt; an new variant of a clause from &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, such that the link-condition with mgu &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is satisfied.  If the tree &lt;math&gt;T'&lt;/math&gt; is constructed by extending     &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; by the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; subtrees &lt;math&gt;L_i&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;T'\sigma &lt;/math&gt; is a tableau for &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; (expansion rule). 
*Let &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; be a tableau for &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; a branch of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; a leaf  of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;L' \in C&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;\overline{L'}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; have a mgu &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, than  &lt;math&gt;T \sigma&lt;/math&gt; is a  tableau for &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; (reduction rule).

The following are three possible link conditions:
  
#No condition.  
#Weak link condition: There is a literal &lt;math&gt;L \in B&lt;/math&gt; and   &lt;math&gt;L' \in C&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;\overline{L'}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; have a mgu &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; 
#Strong link condition: There is a leaf &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;,   and &lt;math&gt;L' \in C&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;\overline{L'}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; have a mgu &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; . 

Analog to the propositional case the different link conditions result
in different calculi:

*The empty condition results in a  clause normal form tableau calculus.

*The weak condition results in a connection calculus.

*The strong link condition results in a model elimination calculus.

Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]], a collection of open-content textbooks!

You should really consider [[Special:Userlogin|creating an account or login in]]. Here are some advantages:

* The use of a username of your choice.
* Greater security and privacy, your IP address will be hidden from most users.
* You get your own personal user page and talk page, instead of having to share it.
* [[Special:Contributions/{{PAGENAME}}|Your contributions]] will be reconized as your own, and not confused with anyone elses.
* The use of your own watchlist, which shows when pages you are interested in have changed.
* Your opinions carry greater weight in the [[Wikibooks:Decision making|decision making process]].
* You become a recognized member of the Wikibooks community.
* Creating an account is easy and only takes a few minutes of your time.

We hope that you choose to become a [[Wikibooks:Wikibookians|Wikibookian]] and [[Special:Userlogin|create an account]].&lt;br/&gt;
Feel free to ask any questions on my talk page or in the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]].&lt;br/&gt;
Be sure to sign your posts and comments on talk pages with four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;),
this will let other editors know you said it.&lt;br/&gt;

| &lt;!-- this is so if anyone tries to use it where it doesn't go they will know. --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Bow Drill.png|thumb|300px]]
The &quot;bow and drill&quot; method is well-known and it is a lot of work. The bow is similar to that used for archery. To make such a bow, find a thin rope or flexible but sturdy vine, and a sturdy stick {{units|60-120 cm|2 to 4 feet}} long. Tie the rope to one end of the stick, and make another knot on the other end of the stick, with the rope between the ends not quite taut. 

The drill (or spindle) is another straight stick, thin but strong, preferably stripped of bark, sharpened on the bottom end and rounded on the top. The center of the bowstring (rope) is wrapped around the drill, with the bow and spindle at right angles to each other. The end of the spindle is placed on a fireboard.  

The fireboard is a piece of dry, softwood (cedar is excellent), with a conical impression in the top surface (such as might be made with a countersink).  This impression is bored near the edge of the fireboard, and a notch is cut into it.  The apex of the notch should be at the center of the impression.  Place a card or a piece of bark beneath the notch to catch the hot wood which the spindle will grind off the fireboard.

The top of the spindle is rounded and smoothed, and placed in a socket made of a hardwood, bone, stone, or something similar.  The socket should be smoothed and greased to reduce friction - you do not want to generate heat in the socket.  

Once the equipment is ready, gather some tinder.  This tinder should be easily lit.  Dry grass, pine needles, and dryer lint all work well for this.  Form the tinder pile into the shape of a bird's nest.  Then make sure you have enough kindling on hand and an easily lit fire laid with fuel ready to go.  When tinder bursts into flames, it is ''not'' the right time to start looking for kindling and fuel.  Do this ''ahead'' of time.

Once the spindle is in place with its bottom tip in the impression in the fireboard, the top held firmly by the socket, and the cord wrapped around its center, the fire builder will move the bow back and forth quickly to rotate the spindle.  Long strokes are better than short strokes.

If the socket is pressed too hard, the spindle will not spin.  If it is not pressed hard enough, the spindle will come loose.

After only a few seconds of spinning the spindle, the fireboard should begin to smoke.  Keep working the bow.  After about a minute of smoke, look for a pile of hot wood powder to accumulate in the notch, caught on the card or bark placed beneath it.  Stop working the bow and see if the wood powder continues to smoke.  If it does not, work the bow again.

When the wood powder continues to smoke after the spindle stops, carefully pick up the card or bark, slide the wood powder into the center of the bird's nest tinder pile, and ''gently'' blow on the wood powder.  Slowly increase the strength of the air stream blown into the tinder.  It should glow red, and as more air is forced into it and the tinder worked into the ember, it should glow even brighter.  Eventually when you take your next breath, the tinder pile will burst into flames.  Place the burning tinder beneath the kindling and tend the fire as you would any newly lit fire.

Brilliant idea.  Any attempt to show how to avoid fighting America's oil wars is a very good cause. [[User:Xania|Xania]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 21:17, 15 June 2007 (UTC)

== What Wikipedia is not ==

&quot;Wikipedia is not a place to publish your own thoughts and analyses or to publish new information not previously published.&quot; - from the article &quot;What Wikipedia is not.&quot;

This quote form the opening page of the article &quot;How To Beat The Draft Board&quot; is in violation of the above: &quot;This guide was written several months ago, based on my official training for becoming a member of a local draft board.&quot; 

Also from the article &quot;What Wikipedia is not:&quot;

&quot;Personal essays that state your particular feelings about a topic (rather than the consensus of experts). Wikipedia is supposed to compile human knowledge. It is not a vehicle to make personal opinions become part of human knowledge.&quot;

The last paragraph from the opening page of &quot;How To Beat The Draft Board&quot; is, again in violation of the above: &quot;Unfortunately, in this country, the draft boards are often stacked with pro-war, pro-military types who see it as their duty not to evaluate cases, but to send as many people as possible to the front lines.&quot;

Based on the above reasons, this article should be deleted immediately.

== Opposition to the war is a world-wide belief not a personal belief ==

In response to the above comment.  This is a text book and one with many uses although I don't understand why the USA has a draft board - surely they only exist if a country has conscription??  And anyway the last line of the paragraph you quoted is fact. --[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 18:50, 8 April 2008 (UTC)

''Spaghetti alle vongole'' (spaghetti and clams) originated in Naples and is very popular throughout the surrounding Campania region in addition to [[wikipedia:Rome|Rome]]. Italians prepare this dish two ways: with tomatoes (''in rosso'') and without (''in bianco'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.italiantourism.com/vongole.html Info on ''Spaghetti alle vongole'' on Italiantourism.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The below recipe is based on the one found in the recipe book published by ''La Accademia Italiana della Cucina'' (The Academy of Italian Cuisine).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accademiaitalianacucina.it/inglese/indricette.html ''La Accademia Italiana della Cucina'']&lt;/ref&gt; It differs from the Academy's recipe only in that it includes clam broth and canned clams in addition to the traditional ingredients.

==Cleaning and eating clams==
This recipe calls for live clams. Here are some safety guidelines for buying, eating and cooking live clams.

*Never buy a clam that's open or cracked.
*Never eat a clam that won't open after cooking.
*Cook clams within 24 hours of purchasing.
*Always scrub clams clean before cooking.

For more info on this subject, read ''[http://www.foodreference.com/html/clamshappy.html Happy as a clam]'' by Chef Mark R. Vogel.

==Ingredients==
* 4 liters (1 gallon) water
* 450 grams (1 pound) dry spaghetti
* olive oil (See below for quantities.)
* 20 grams (3/4 ounces) [[cookbook:garlic|garlic]], minced
* 1 kilogram (2 pounds) live clams
* 225 grams (8 ounces) diced plum [[Cookbook:tomato|tomatoes]] (Use for ''in rosso''. Omit for ''in bianco''.)
* 225 grams (8 ounces) canned, shelled clams, thoroughly rinsed (optional)
* 120 milliliters (4 fluid ounces) bottled clam [[cookbook:broth|broth]] (optional)
* a handful of [[Cookbook:parsley|parsley]], minced
* [[cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]] (See below for quantity.)
* salt to taste (See below for quantity.)
* Peperoncino or, less commonly, [[cookbook:Pepper|black pepper]] to taste

==Procedure==
#Boil the water in a large pot with a tablespoon of salt.
#Add the spaghetti once the water starts boiling. Cook until the pasta is ''[[Cookbook:al dente|al dente]]''. This should take 7-8 minutes.
#Pour olive oil into a large, wide pan so that it barely covers the bottom and heat the oil.
#Add the garlic, along with the peperoncino, and sauté until golden brown. This should take about a minute. Be careful not to burn the garlic. 
#Add the live clams and diced tomatoes.
#Put the lid on the pan and cook for about eight minutes. Shake the pan every minute or so to help the clams open. Throw out those that don't.
#Drain the spaghetti and put it in the pan with the live clams and tomatoes. Reduce the heat to low.
#Add the canned clams and clam broth to the pan.
#Season with salt (and pepper, if the peperoncino is not used) to taste and toss until the pasta is well coated with tomatoes and oil. Add another tablespoon of olive oil if you like.
#Sprinkle with chopped parsley.
#Serve hot.

==Tip==
Resist the urge to add cheese. This recipe is intended as a light summer dish.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Black Dwarfs ==

Black dwarfs are thought to be the end stage of stars that initially have between .07 and 10 solar masses.  After passing through a red giant phase, a significant proportion of the mass of the star is shed as a planetary nebula.  What remains is a white dwarf, which is initially extremely hot, but which does not generate any new energy through nuclear fusion -- and which is supported by electron degeneracy pressure.  White dwarfs cool very slowly, eventually becoming dead black dwarfs.  This process takes so long that the universe is not thought to be old enough to contain black dwarfs yet, so they are theoretical objects.

{{subject}}

A black dwarf is a white dwarf that has cooled down to the temperature of the cosmic microwave background, and so is invisible. Unlike red dwarfs, brown dwarfs, and white dwarfs, black dwarfs are entirely &lt;u&gt;hypothetical&lt;/u&gt;. 

Once a star has evolved to become a white dwarf, it no longer has an internal source of heat, and is shining only because it is still hot. Like something taken from the oven, left alone a white dwarf will cool down until it is the same temperature as its surroundings. Unlike tonight’s dinner, which cools by convection, conduction, and radiation, a white dwarf cools only by ''radiation''.

Because it’s electron degeneracy pressure that stops it from collapsing to become a black hole, a white dwarf is a fantastic conductor of heat . How fast a white dwarf cools is thus easy to work out … it depends on only its initial temperature, mass, and composition (most are carbon plus oxygen; some maybe predominantly oxygen, neon and magnesium; others helium). At least, part of the core of a white dwarf may crystallize, the cooling curve will have a bit of a bump around then.

The universe is only 13.7 billion years old, so even a white dwarf formed 13 billion years ago (unlikely; the stars which become white dwarfs take a billion years, or so, to do so) it would still have a temperature of a few thousand degrees. The coolest white dwarf observed to date has a temperature of a little less than 3,000 K. A long way to go before it becomes a black dwarf.

I'm working on the [[Feminism]] book and am really proud to be contributing to this project. It seems to be pretty quiet. I'm a radical feminist who holds a dual citizen-ship in Canada and the United States. I love French and English literature, especially from the mid 1900's to the early 20th century, such as [[Emile Zola]], [[Colette]], and [[DH Lawrence]].

== Hello! ==

Hello OneWomanArmy, how are you? As a matter of professional interest, I've just started uploading a book about gender issues, [[Gender and ICT]]. This book was donated to Wikibooks by the United Nations Development Programme, and is all about the effects of gender on the use of communications technology (internet, phone, radio, etc). 

Anyway, I think it's great to have more books about progressive human rights issues here on Wikibooks, especially things like [[Feminism]]. It gives us the ability to not only be a source of information, but also a source of ''the right kinds of information''. 

Anyway, if you need any help, let me know: I've been around for a while and can probably answer most questions that you have. Talk to you later. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 03:25, 22 June 2007 (UTC)</text>

| name = Taut-line hitch
| image = TautlineHitch-ABOK-1800.jpg
| use = The '''[[W:Taut-line_hitch|Taut-Line Hitch]]''' is an adjustable loop knot for use on lines under tension. It is useful when the length of a line will need to be periodically adjusted in order to maintain tension. It is made by tying a Rolling hitch around the standing part after passing around an anchor object. Tension is maintained by sliding the hitch to adjust size of the loop, thus changing the effective length of the standing part without retying the knot. When under tension, however, the knot will grip the cord and will be difficult to cause to slip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is typically used for securing tent lines in outdoor activities involving camping, by arborists when climbing trees, for creating adjustable moorings in tidal areas, and to secure loads on vehicles. A versatile knot, the Taut-line hitch was even used by astronauts during STS-82, the second Space Shuttle mission to repair the Hubble Space Telescope.
| tying_instructions = 
#Pass the working end around the anchor object. Bring it back along side of the standing part and make a half-hitch around the standing part.
#Continue with another wrap inside the loop, effectively making a round turn around the standing part.
#Complete with a half-hitch outside the loop, made in the same direction as the first two wraps, as for a clove hitch.
#Dress by snugging the hitch firmly around the standing part. Load slowly and adjust as necessary.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;big&gt;&lt;b&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social psychologist Rudolf Dreikurs was born in Vienna, Austria on February 8, 1897. He graduated from the medical school of the University of Vienna before spending five years as an intern and resident in psychiatry. His research in the field of social psychiatry led him to organize the first Mental Hygiene Committee in Austria and to become interested in the teachings of social psychologist Alfred Adler. As a director of one of the child guidance centers in Vienna, he employed Adler's methods with families and classrooms (http://wik.ed.uiuc.edu/index.php/Dreikurs%2C_Rudolf) .&lt;p&gt; 
In 1937, Dreikurs left Austria to avoid Nazi persecution and arrived in the U.S. He eventually moved to Chicago in 1939 and became a student and colleague of Adler, who believed that the main purpose of all humans was belonging and acceptance by others. The &lt;i&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/i&gt; describes Dreikurs as an &quot;American psychiatrist and educator who developed the Austrian psychologist Alfred Adler's system of individual psychology into a pragmatic method for understanding the purposes of reprehensible behavior in children and for stimulating cooperative behavior without punishment or reward.&quot; Dreikurs was Professor Emeritus of Psychiatry at the Chicago Medical School and the Director of the Alfred Adler Institute of Chicago. He also was editor of the &lt;i&gt;Journal of Individual Psychology&lt;i&gt;. He died in Chicago on May 25, 1972.&lt;p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;The following is a list of books written by Dreikurs and one written about Dreikurs: (Rudolf Dreikurs, n.d.)&lt;p&gt;

(Biography)&lt;i&gt; Courage to Be Imperfect: The Life and Work of Rudolf Dreikurs&lt;/i&gt; by Janet Terner, W.L. Pew''&lt;p&gt;





&lt;big&gt;
&lt;b&gt;FUNDEMENTALS OF DREIKURS' SOCIAL DISCIPLINE MODEL&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;p&gt;



Dreikurs' Social Discipline model is based on the four basic premises of Adler's social theory. These premises are (http://wik.ed.uiuc.edu/index.php/Dreikurs%2C_Rudolf):&lt;p&gt;
     1. Humans are social beings and their basic motivation is to belong&lt;p&gt;
     2. All behavior has a purpose&lt;p&gt;
     3. Humans are decision-making organisms&lt;p&gt;
     4. Humans only perceive reality and this perception may be mistaken or biased&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dreikurs' educational philosophy is &quot;based on the philosophy of democracy, with its implied principle of human equality, and on the socio-teleological approach of the psychology of Alfred Adler. In this frame of reference, man is recognized as a social being, his actions as purposive and directed toward a goal, his personality as a unique and indivisible entity&quot; (Dreikurs, 1968, p. x). A socio-teleological approach implies the existence of God, a higher purpose, and a natural order of things. Dreikurs believed it was possible to understand children's misbehaviors by recognizing the four main purposes or goals of the child. The four goals of misbehavior are &lt;i&gt;attention getting, the contest for power, seeking revenge, and displaying inadequacy&lt;/i&gt;. Dreikurs promoted the use of encouragement and logical (and natural) consequences rather than reward and punishment.&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially, every action of the child is grounded in the idea that he is seeking his place in the group. A well-adjusted child will conform to the requirements of the group by making valuable contributions. A child who misbehaves, on the other hand, will defy the needs of the group situation in order to maintain social status. Whichever of the aforementioned goals he chooses to employ, the child believes that this is the only way he can function within the group dynamic successfully. Dreikurs states that &quot;his goal may occasionally vary with the circumstances: he may act to attract attention at one moment, and assert his power or seek revenge at another&quot; (Dreikurs, 1968, p.27). Regardless if the child is well-adjusted or is misbehaving, his main purpose will be social acceptance. &lt;p&gt;

The following are techniques that can be used to address the four goals of misbehavior:&lt;p&gt;
A. Attention Getting
##Minimize the Attention - Ignore the behavior, stand close by, write a note&lt;p&gt;
##Legitimize the Behavior - Create a lesson out of the behavior, have the class join in the behaviors&lt;p&gt;
##Do the Unexpected - Turn out the lights, play a musical instrument, talk to the wall&lt;p&gt;
##Distract the Student - Ask a question or a favor, change the activity&lt;p&gt;
##Recognize Appropriate Behavior - Thanks students, give the a written note of congratulations&lt;p&gt;
##Move the Student - Ask the student to sit at another seat, send the student to a &quot;thinking chair&quot;&lt;p&gt;

B. Seeking Power and Control
##Make a Graceful Exit - Acknowledge student's power, remove audience, table matter for later discussion,&lt;p&gt;
##Use a Time-Out&lt;p&gt;
##Apply the Consequence&lt;p&gt;

C. Seeking Revenge
## Same as for &quot;Contest for Power&quot;&lt;p&gt;

D. Displaying Inadequacy
##Modify Instructional Methods&lt;p&gt;
##Use Concrete Learning Materials and Computer-Enhanced Instruction&lt;p&gt;
##Teach One Step at a Time (or break instruction into smaller parts)&lt;p&gt;
##Provide Tutoring&lt;p&gt;
##Teach Positive Self-Talk and Speech&lt;p&gt;
##Teach that Mistakes are Okay&lt;p&gt;
##Build Student's Confidence&lt;p&gt;
##Focus on Past Successes&lt;p&gt;
##Make Learning Tangible&lt;p&gt;
##Recognize Achievement&lt;p&gt;



&lt;big&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;CASE STUDIES FOR PRACTICAL CLASSROOM IMPLEMENTATION&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;We have summarized some actual case studies from Dreikurs' book entitled &lt;i&gt;Psychology in the Classroom: A Manual for Teachers&lt;/i&gt; in hopes that these examples will be inspirational for use in your own classroom. These studies provide methods and strategies for dealing with the four goals of misbehavior: &lt;i&gt;Attention Getting, Revenge, Power and Control, and Helplessness and Inadequacy&lt;/i&gt;. While each strategy may be modified for the secondary classroom, Dreikurs primary focus was behavior management at the elementary level. The authors have given examples for elementary, junior high or middle school, and high school levels. These case studies come from the school system of Gary, Indiana in the 1950's.&lt;p&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Elementary Case Study&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Bessie is repeating the third grade. Her learning rate is probably low. In math she will put anything down for an answer or she might put down no answer at all. She seems afraid to recite. Dreikurs concludes that the child is functioning on a lower level than her ability allows. Bessie's teacher has spoken with the class about the importance of being good listeners. It was decided and agreed upon that while one student was reading aloud other students would wait to raise their hands until the teacher asked for input. This would encourage students like Bessie to recite without feeling nervous or interrupted. Dreikurs notes how this strategy was effective in inducing the whole class to give Bessie support and encouragement. The teacher also began giving Bessie more time to finish her work. By the next week, Bessie had improved a great deal. The teacher remarked that she was proud of Bessie, drew a smiling picture on her paper, and solicited encouragement from the principal as well. Bessie's teacher, by identifying Bessie's fear of failure during recital and removing pressure, allowed Bessie to discover that she could solve the problems. After this realization, Bessie was soon able to work at a faster pace. Furthermore, by encouraging Bessie, the teacher nurtured Bessie's pride in her accomplishments (Dreikurs, 1968, p.178).&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This case study focuses on the fourth goal of misbehavior, or &lt;i&gt;Helplessness and Inadequacy&lt;/i&gt;. Bessie was refusing to try most educational demands because she was unaware of her capabilities and therefore refused to comply with classroom expectations. Bessie's problems are rooted in feeling discouraged. Strategies that assist helpless students include modifying instructional methods, teaching in a step-by-step fashion, allowing for mistakes, building confidence by recognizing achievement, and teaching positive self-talk. By modifying instruction based on Bessie's individual needs, her teacher was successful. It is important to note the significance of the teacher's responsibilities when considering Dreikur's behavior management techniques. These strategies require an openness and caring for the student in order to achieve success.&lt;p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Middle School Case Study&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Charles is fifteen years old and in the seventh grade. Although he is three years older than the other students, he is small and slight. He comes from a large family with many older married siblings. There is a new baby at home. His sister, one year younger than him, is also in the class. The teacher was assigned the class four months prior following a substitute. He found Charles to be disruptive and uncooperative. Charles would wander around the classroom and speak out of turn regularly. Although there were other disruptive students in the class, Charles had a more malicious and arrogant demeanor. Dreikurs theorized that Charles sought power and control and was perhaps exhibiting elements of revenge. The teacher sought to diffuse the situation by being friendly and courteous, yet was at a loss for an effective strategy. A paddle was supplied by the administration, but the teacher declined this approach. Dreikurs felt that the paddle more than likely contributed to the disruptive situation in the classroom and appreciated the teacher's approach. The teacher found it difficult to maintain group discussions on discipline in the classroom due to disruptions. He observed that Charles migrated to the larger, more rugged boys in the class, often trading punches. Charles once displayed a switchblade, which the teacher firmly asked him to leave at home. Dreikurs observed that the teacher did the right thing in not confiscating the knife because Charles respected the teacher's instructions and did not display the knife again.&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day when the teacher observed Charles out of his seat again, he asked Charles why he was not seated. Charles responded that he needed to find his book. It had been fifteen minutes since the assignment requiring the book had begun, so the teacher replied that perhaps Charles better sit down before he lost his seat. This was greeted with laughter by the class. Driekurs explained the successful strategy of using humor to win the class over to his side. &quot;Solitation of group pressure is by and large a powerful and effective method&quot; (Dreikurs, 1968, p.155). Charles no longer held power and as a result conformed to the classroom expectation of remaining seated.&lt;p&gt;

&lt;P&gt;This example illustrates the &lt;i&gt;Power and Control&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Revenge&lt;/i&gt;  goals for motivating misbehavior. Removing the ability to gain power is an effective strategy for dealing with these issues. Dreikurs suggests doing the unexpected, removing the audience, and using time-outs. Once again the emphasis is on &lt;i&gt;logical consequences&lt;/i&gt;. Effectiveness is increased when these consequences are set in advance. Furthermore, this case study illustrated the goal of &lt;i&gt;Attention Getting&lt;/i&gt;. Some suggestions Dreikurs gives are reducing attention in favor of distracting the student and emphasizing appropriate behavior.&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;High School Case Study&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Hal is the eldest of two children and a student in the teacher's eleventh grade English class. Hal's parents were divorced when he was eleven years old. His mother usually worked in the evenings leaving Hal and his brother on their own. Hal seldom did the assignments, rarely participated in class discussions, and was often absent. Hal and two classmates were caught robbing a home and had succeeded in robberies before. Hal was the ring-leader. All three were put on probation. When at school, Hal appeared nervous and assumed everyone was out to get him. For example, if the teacher happened to look his way, Hal would respond, &quot;What are you watching me for?&quot;  Dreikurs explains that Hal's defensive attitude is a result of being pushed around and that because Hal expects this treatment, he unintentionally provokes it. Hal is seeking revenge against a society in which he has no place (Dreikurs, 1968, p.172).&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When studying drama, the teacher asked Hal to read for a part in a play. Hal did very well and was awarded a leading role on the condition that he keep up with classwork and attend all rehearsals. Dreikurs noted that Hal was ambitious and capable, as evidenced by his criminal activities. By incorporating Hal into the framework of productive society, Hal could now use his talents appropriately. By taking a chance on Hal, the teacher facilitated a situation in which Hal gained confidence and cooperated throughout the remainder of the school year. Dreikurs felt that it probably was not solely the play that was responsible for the changes in Hal. Dreikurs adds the teacher must have employed a great deal of encouragement and understanding as well.&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This example of the &lt;I&gt;Revenge&lt;/i&gt; goal illustrates how the strategy of acknowledging the student's power can be extremely effective. Hal sought status through his criminal activity. By achieving this recognition through more socially appropriate activities, such as starring in the school play, Hal's goals were met and the misbehavior was no longer necessary.&lt;p&gt;

&lt;big&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;PROFESSIONAL CRITIQUE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/big&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Articles in Support of Dreikurs' Theory&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It was difficult to find scholarly articles that were supportive of Dreikurs's work and his educational theory. However, a search on the Internet quickly showed that &quot;Dreikursian&quot; and &quot;Alderian/Dreikursian&quot; principles are used in different therapy and guidance situations throughout the country. For example, these principles are used and taught in &quot;child guidance&quot;, &quot;parent education&quot;, and family therapy&quot; situations at various centers. The following example of how these Dreikursian&quot; and &quot;Alderian/Dreikursian&quot; principles are used is from the Positive Discipline Association.&lt;p&gt;
The Positive Discipline Association is a program that teaches young people to be &quot;responsible, respectful and resourceful members of their communities(Positive Discipline Association).&quot; Their &quot;Positive Discipline Parenting and Classroom Management Model&quot; is based on Adler' and Dreikurs's work, particularly their democratic approach to teaching and parenting. This Association provided one example of this approach working in a school setting. There was a 4-year study of classroom meetings, one technique promoted by Dreikurs, in a lower-income Sacramento elementary school. The study showed that during the four-year period, suspensions decreased (from 64 per year to 4 per year), vandalism decreased (from 24 occurrences to 2) and teachers reported an improvement in the classroom climate, behavior, and academic performance&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Articles That Do Not Support Dreikurs' Theory&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It was difficult to find scholarly articles that were critical of Dreikurs's work and his educational theory. Alfie Kohn is very critical of his work and theory, and Charles Wolfgang has some issues with the ability of teachers to determine a student's goal of misbehavior and use logical consequences, but little else, especially from psychologists, was found that did not support Dreikurs's theory.&lt;p&gt;
Alfie Kohn, an author and lecturer who speaks widely on human behavior, education, and parenting, in an article entitled &quot;Beyond Discipline&quot; in Education Week (1996), is skeptical of Dreikur's ideas of logical consequences. Kohn believes Dreikurs simply repackages punishment as logical consequences. As Kohn notes, &quot;The student is still forced to do something undesirable (or prevented from doing something desirable), but the tone of the interaction is supposed to be more reasonable and friendly, and the consequence itself must have some conceptual connection to the child's act.&quot; Kohn goes on to describe a situation Dreikurs wrote about in his &lt;i&gt;Logical Consequences: A New Approach to Discipline&lt;i&gt;. A 2nd grade male student who talked out of turn, squirmed a lot, and so on was given the &quot;logical consequence&quot; of being taken from the classroom and told to spend some time back in kindergarten. According to Dreikurs, this is a logical or appropriate consequence as long as the teacher prefaces it with telling the student that she wonders if the student is ready to continue in the 2nd grade and suggesting that it might be better for him to go back to kindergarten.&lt;p&gt;
Kohn also has an issue with Dreikurs's idea of democracy in the classroom. Kohn suspects that Dreikurs used classroom meetings and other &quot;modern&quot; techniques to get students to conform or do what they were told. Kohn quotes Dreikurs as writing, &quot;It is autocratic to force, but democratic to induce compliance.&quot; (R. Dreikurs et al., &lt;i&gt;Maintaining Sanity in the Classroom&lt;/i&gt;, 2d ed. [New York: HarperCollins, 1982], page 67.) Obviously Kohn does not see Dreikurs's use of classroom meetings and other techniques as democratic because teachers still hold much of the power and students have no choice but to conform to what the teacher wants and thinks is best for the group.&lt;p&gt;

Charles Wolfgang, the author of &lt;i&gt;Solving Discipline and Classroom Management Problems: Methods and Models for Today's Teachers&lt;/i&gt;, notes that it may be difficult to determine which of the four goals of misbehavior a student is exhibiting. Wolfgang also mentions that it may be difficult for a teacher to determine what sort of logical consequences are appropriate to use. In essence, Wolfgang is not necessarily criticizing Dreikurs's philosophy but is questioning the ease with which teachers and other adults can determine the particular goal of a misbehavior and use logical consequences.&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt; The Authors' Personal Reflections &lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Angela Curry&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One point I found particularly interesting relates back to the second case study above involving Charles. During the time of writing these studies, corporal punishment was a prevalent and acceptable means of behavior management. Dreikurs, however, felt that this type of punishment probably contributed to disruptive behavior. Even today, spanking, while debatable, is still quite present in our society. Many agree with &quot;spare the rod, spoil the child&quot;. In reference to Dreikurs' view of logical consequences, spanking does seem a bit absurd. How is hitting a child a logical consequence of, for example, not making her bed? Or saying a bad word? In adulthood, we have logical consequences mandated by law. These consequences make our society function somewhat rationally. If I am speeding, I might get a speeding ticket, and this seems logical. What if the consequence for speeding required that I spend a year in prison? Would I passively accept these consequences, or might I tend toward disruption?&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recurring theme I have noticed in Dreikursian theory is the respect for the child as a member of society. There are many examples throughout history of what happens when a people do not feel respected. If we model our classrooms on societies and communities, we must realize that mutual respect is of the utmost necessity. By setting logical consequences in advance and encouraging the student, we are setting good examples and modeling good citizenship. -&lt;i&gt;A.C.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Chris Adams&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find Angela's reflection on corporal punishment particularly cogent because I grew up during a time when corporal punishment in schools was still practiced and an often used consequence for misbehavior. Though it was not a logical consequence according to Dreikurs, it sure did prevent me from misbehaving in Mr. Baker's class.&lt;p&gt;
I find Dreikurs's emphasis on democracy in the classroom intriguing and appropriate, even though Kohn believes it is more autocratic than democratic. It is intriguing in light of the history of education prior to the 20th century. For example, education in the post-Revolutionary War period emphasized promoting patriotism, teachings about the new republic and what it meant to be a citizen in America. I just find the juxtaposition of this pre-20th century idea of education with Dreikurs's methods for bringing democracy into the classroom, such as classroom meetings and discussions, interesting.&lt;p&gt;
Dreikurs's methods of bringing a democratic approach into the classroom are in line with my desire to make my classroom more democratic. His methods of addressing misbehaviors in the classroom are appropriate and adaptable to my 9th grade science classroom. By employing these methods, I hope to take my teacher-centered classroom with inconsistent classroom management and re-create it into a student-centered classroom with more effective classroom management. I believe I can do this in three ways: (1) learn to recognize why students are misbehaving (Dreikurs's four goals); (2) use some of the techniques (discussed above) to deal with these behaviors; and (3) incorporate more classroom discussion (maybe using the Touchstones Discussion method) and meetings into lessons. Dreikurs's methods seem to parallel my belief that your have to be a teacher that is kind and fair with students, aware of their behaviors and the reasons behind those behaviors, and open to discussing with students how to deal with particular positive and negative behaviors in the classroom.&lt;p&gt;    

&lt;big&gt;&lt;b&gt;QUESTIONS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
##What are the four goals of misbehavior according to Dreikurs and what are two techniques you can use to address each misbehavior?&lt;p&gt;
##Compare your approach to classroom management with Dreikurs's approach and determine which of Dreikurs's approaches you could incorporate into yours. How would you incorporate them?&lt;p&gt;

There are two fundamental properties of DNA molecule often studied with sequence statistics; ''local'' and ''long-range'' properties. These properties are usually analyzed in terms of displaced correlations at nucleotide and Batch levels. In which case, the levels are studied as statistical models involving spectral analysis where they are noted to exhibit entropy.

==BMW E30 Megasquirt &amp; Wasted Spark ECU Convertion==

This is a guide to upgrade the Motronic ECU fitted to BMW's [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_E30 E30 3-Series] (1988 to 1991) using the after market ECU [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megasquirt Megasquirt], and a Coil Pack for [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasted_spark Wasted Spark].  The model used in this guide, is a UK spec 1989 325i.  Other models may very, particularly those models that use the pre-88 Jetronic system, which will require additional work.

===Parts Needed===
 Megasquirt I or II
 Megasquirt connector &amp; short Wiring loom
 Coil Pack (Vauxhall Vectra/Omega V6)
 Wideband O2 sensor (Innovate LC-1)
 Motronic Plug (scrap ECU box)
 TPS (Throttle Position Sensor)
 IAT (Intake Air Temperature sensor)
 Hose
 Wire
 Diodes


==Megasquirt ECU==
Megasquirt can be purchased in kit form or ready built.  Either way, you need to order it with two additional spark outputs.  See the main [http://www.megasquirt.info/ Megasquirt site] for suppliers and constructional details.  For details on wiring the additional coil drivers, see 
[http://megasquirt.sourceforge.net/extra/setup-msns.html this page]

==Wiring the ECU loom==
Wiring Megasquirt to the car, can either be done by connecting every component directly (sensors, injectors, coil etc), or reusing as much as the existing wiring as possible.  In this guide, we do the latter, by gutting an old Motronic ECU box, and reusing the connector.  Additional wiring will be needed for the coil outputs, and the O2 sensor.  The Megasquirt box can be bolted on top of the Motronic case, or if your building MS in kit form, it's possible to put the MS circuit board into the old Motronic box.

==Wiring the Sensors==
===Throttle Position Sensor (TPS)===

===Air Intake Sensor (IAT)===

==Wiring the Coil Pack==

The coil pack used, was a Vauxhall Vectra/Omega V6.  It has 3 coils with 6 outputs.  Spark plugs are fired in pairs, on the ignition and exhaust stroke.
&lt;br&gt;
The M20 firing order is 1-5-3-6-2-4.  The three Megasquirt outputs are A B &amp; C

 Bank A = Cylinder 1 &amp; 6
 Bank B = Cylinder 5 &amp; 2
 Bank C = Cylinder 3 &amp; 4

 Coil Pack Plug:
 1 (A) Cyl 1 6 (nearest to 4 pin connector) (My Brown)
 2 (B) Cyl 5 2 (My Yellow)
 3 (C) Cyl 3 4 (my Blue)
 4 +12v

It's more convenient to install the coil pack closest to the bulkhead, so you need to reverse the plug leads so that the shortest is at the back, longest at the front.
&lt;br&gt;
I found a coil pack plug at a scrapyard, and used shielded 4-core cable from [http://cpc.farnell.com CPC] Part:CB08732 to connect directly to Megasquirt.

==Wideband O2 Sensor==

Ideally the wideband sensor needs welding into a section of the exhaust pipe that sees exhaust gases from all six cylinders.  This may not be practical, without using two sensors.  However, you can compromise, by just sensing the gases from 3 cylinders, and assume the other 3 cylinders are the same.  This is not ideal, but better than doing without.

There are 3 relays next to the expansion tank (one may be missing).  One of these (the missing one!) controls the O2 sensor (if fitted).  The connector for this, is under the battery tray, and can be used to power the Wideband sensor.  Cut off the connector (or find a suitable plug), and use the green &amp; white wire.  The Innovate LC-1 controller requires two separate earthing points.  Attach one to the body of the car, and feed the other one through the bulkhead to to the Motronic connector along with the output wires. You need to use Output 2 (brown) as this is confirured from factory for wideband use.</text>

===Making soap===

'''Equipment'''
*Any sort of animal or vegetable fat. 
*Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH), also known as lye. 
*Glass beaker and stirring rod. 
*Bunsen burner or other means of heating solution. 
*Mold for making soap bars (any flexible plastic container).

*Vinegar, just in case.

|align=&quot;center&quot; |'''&lt;big&gt; SAFETY NOTES&lt;/big&gt;'''
|-
|
* Gloves, labcoat and appropriate eyewear should be worn when handling the Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH). 
*You should do this in a well-ventilated area, preferably in a fume hood or outdoors.
*'''DO NOT BREATHE THE FUMES'''. 
*Wash with vinegar if you get some on your skin (have some vinegar handy before starting the experiment) - '''DO NOT wash with water!'''.  
*Mixing lye with water results in a chemical reaction that creates extreme heat - hence, washing lye off your hands (for example) with water will only initiate that reaction on your hand, resulting in chemical burn.
|-

|}

'''What to do'''

# Place 16 oz. of any fat, such as oil or butter in a beaker. 
# In another container add 2.1 oz. (59.5 g) of Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH) to 6 oz. (170g) of water (do not ''add water to Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH)'' - it will splatter) stir to dissolve and let cool to 110 F. 
# Melt fat under low heat to 110°F (49°C) and add the Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH) solution while stirring until the base has completely reacted with the fat (about 20 to 30 minutes) 
# Pour the mixture into molds. 
# Let this cool and sit for a day or two. Let the soap cakes cure for three weeks before using.

This is a guide to upgrade the Motronic ECU fitted to BMW's [[w:BMW_E30 E30|3-Series]] (1988 to 1991) using the after market ECU [[w:Megasquirt|Megasquirt]], and a Coil Pack for Wasted Spark.  The model used in this guide, is a UK spec 1989 325i.  Other models may very, particularly those models that use the pre-88 Jetronic system, which will require additional work.

'''Background'''

The Motronic ECU fitted to BMWs in the late 80's whilst reliable, is somewhat outdated now.  It relies on an Air Flow Meter for air intake measurement, which is more restrictive to air flow than a more modern MAF sensor.  Megasquirt takes this a step further, and uses a MAP Sensor instead, removing the need for any air measurement.  Megasquirt also opens the door to using an alternative ignition system, such as Wasted Spark.  For the price of a new BMW distributor cap and rotor arm, Wasted spark can be added to the Megasquirt system, boosting performance (a stronger spark) and reliability (no contacts to wear out).

'''Advantages'''
*Improved fuel economy
*Lower emissions.
*Improved performance
*Solid state ignition (no dizzy cap/rotor)
*Relatively cheap modification for benefits gained.
*Extendability (platform for future mods - turbo/supercharging etc.).

===Parts Needed===
*Megasquirt I or II (I used &quot;Megasquirt-extra I&quot; for this writeup)
*Megasquirt connector &amp; short Wiring loom
*Coil Pack (Vauxhall/Opel Vectra/Omega V6 or Bosch 0221503002)
*Wideband O2 sensor (Innovate LC-1)
*Motronic Plug (or scrap ECU box)
*TPS (Throttle Position Sensor  - BMW part 0280120406/13631726591)
*IAT (Intake Air Temperature sensor)
*3mm vacuum tube &amp; T-piece.
*Hose
*Wire
*Diodes
*Megastim (optional - get it anyway, you can always sell it)

'''DME &amp; O2 Relays'''

The DME relay, and O2 relay (if used) need to be powered when the Engine/ECU is running.  The simplest way to do this is connect the DME &amp; O2 relays to megasquirts fuel pump output.  In doing so I found that a strange chattering noise came from the relays when I switched off the ignition.  To cure this, I added an inline diode to each of the three relays inputs. Tip: Also connect an LED (with resistor) as an indicator to the fuel pump output - it will help with diagnostics, should you run into difficulties.


==Wiring the Sensors==
'''Throttle Position Sensor (TPS)'''
The standard E30 TPS is of no use, as all this provides is a simple on-off-on state.  I found a Bosch TPS (0280120406) which bolted stright on. I made up a new connector, which plugs into the original TPS socket. An e36 m/s 50 series TPS will work, however it will need simple custom bracketry as it does not bolt right up.  Remember to set the lower, and upper throttle ranges into Megasquirt, so it knows when your foot is off and full on the peddle.

'''Air Intake Sensor (IAT)'''

Push the IAT into the bellows, where the Idle Control Valve used to sit.  Use a jubilee clip to hold it in place.
Use a multimeter or continuity tester to find the correct pin used on the Air Flow Meter connector, then connect it to the IAT sensor.

'''Coolant Sensor (CLT)'''
The standard blue temperature sensor already fitted to the engine (Bosch NTC M12) will work.  It has different properties to that of the default megasquirt settings, so they will need to be changed.  You can use &quot;EasyTherm&quot; software to do this. using the settings in the table below.

==Wiring the Coil Pack==

The coil pack used, was a Vauxhall Vectra/Omega V6.  It has 3 coils with 6 outputs.  Spark plugs are fired in pairs, on the ignition and exhaust stroke.
&lt;br&gt;
The M20 firing order is 1-5-3-6-2-4.  The three Megasquirt outputs are A B &amp; C

 Bank A = Cylinder 1 &amp; 6
 Bank B = Cylinder 5 &amp; 2
 Bank C = Cylinder 3 &amp; 4

 Coil Pack Plug:
 1 (A) Cyl 1 6 (nearest to 4 pin connector)
 2 (B) Cyl 5 2
 3 (C) Cyl 3 4
 4 +12v

It's more convenient to install the coil pack closest to the bulkhead, so you need to reverse the plug leads so that the shortest is at the back, longest at the front.
&lt;br&gt;
I found a coil pack plug at a scrapyard, and used shielded 4-core cable from [http://cpc.farnell.com CPC] Part:CB08732 to connect directly to Megasquirt.

==Wideband O2 Sensor==

Ideally the wideband sensor needs welding into a section of the exhaust pipe that sees exhaust gases from all six cylinders.  This may not be practical, without using two sensors.  However, you can compromise, by just sensing the gases from 3 cylinders, and assume the other 3 cylinders are the same.  This is not ideal, but better than doing without.

There are 3 relays next to the expansion tank (one may be missing).  One of these (the missing one!) controls the O2 sensor (if fitted).  The connector for this, is under the battery tray, and can be used to power the Wideband sensor.  Cut off the connector (or find a suitable plug), and use the green &amp; white wire.  The Innovate LC-1 controller requires two separate earthing points.  Attach one to the body of the car, and feed the other one through the bulkhead to the Motronic connector along with the output wires. You need to use Output 2 (brown) as this is configured from factory for wideband use.

==Vacuum tube==
Use 3mm vacuum tube, with a T-piece between the intake manifold, and the fuel regulator.

==Tachometer==
The tachometer requires a square wave signal from the Motronic ECU, so Megasquirt will need to supply that signal instead.  Normally you would just use the ECU's coil output, but since we are using Wasted Spark, we need a different signal- one that signals every spark.  Thankfully, Megasquirt-extra can provide the signal needed from one of its auxiliary outputs.  All you need, is a couple of resistors, and a transistor.  See [[http://megasquirt.sourceforge.net/extra/tachopin.html]]
Note:  I have read of some people having difficulties getting this working with BMW's tachos.  You may need to increase the resistor value that connects to 12V from 1K to anything up to 100K.  I used a 10K resistor, and that worked fine.


==Tuning==

It's best to start off with a fuel/spark map that is known to work for someone else with the same engine configuration.  This is just to get you started, and not as a substitute for doing your own tuning.  Before you go out on the road, you should at least make sure the engine will idle unassisted (see setting the idle).  Now the fun starts.

With Autotune enabled, drive around to allow megatune to do it's job.  The engine may feel rough at times, but the more you drive, the better it will get (assuming the Spark timings are not way-off).  Remember to burn the table into the ECU before you switch off the engine, otherwise all will be lost.


==Setting the idle==
The butterfly valve on the throttle body is normally fully closed.  The idle stop screw needs to be adjusted, so the butterfly valve is slightly open.  Getting the right adjustment requires trial and error (and a warmed up engine).  You want the idle to be around 700rpm, and the MAP sensor to show the lowest possible value.  However, I found that 700rpm idle was too low for cold starts, and set the idle a bit higher.  Make sure the timing is set to 16 Degrees when idling (there is a setting that can override the timing to this when there is no throttle).
&lt;br&gt;
Be careful when turning the idle screw.  Its probably never been moved since manufacture, and is easily broken (I know from experience!).  Use penetrating oil first.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Vote for deletion ==

Not necesserily this page, but all my other contributions to wikibooks.
I am not an active wikibooks contributor anymore.
To my knowldge, all my submissions from the past few days are not within
wikibooks guidelines, due to a misunderstanding on my part,
with respect to books VS textbooks, and the definition of either.

I appologize to whomever admin did or will do any work for this,
and feel free to instruct me or ask for help.


Please visit my [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Ohadaloni page]] at wikipedia.

== You Guys are Wierd ==

From ''[[Wikibooks:Votes_for_deletion]]''


I agree. There was a great confusion between the terms book and textbook.

This sequence of events could have been prevented by simply just one of you saying: ''Looks like Fiction'', or,
''wikibooks is not for books, just textbooks'',
''that must adhere to certain standards''.

I write mostly fact based fiction in research style. but most is
more fiction like than balanced knowledge material.

While [[Evolution Theory For Kids]] and [[NoSoul]] are books that might
eventually fit wikibooks standards,
also those will not meet them any time soon.

I propose an admin would delete all my work
as is demanded by the wiki guidelines.
As with wikipedia, I will not myself erase the content, for the sake of clarity.

I am assuming my page will remain, though my acitivites with wikibooks will cease, so I am placing a copy of this message on my page.

== Post Scriptum ==

Not to negate my forced political stand above:


I am an '''educator''', not a '''warrior'''.

As such my content will always present unbalanced opinion
following the lines of my concept of life.

[[Reggy]] is a philosophy book, presented as a chapter inside a fiction novel.
[[Reggy]] is the name I naturally also gave the entire novel.
[[Evolution Theory For Kids]] is a superb pure textbook that can not be published
in wikibooks mostly due to
its [http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang big banging] of [http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/God God].
[[NoSoul]] is a collection of verifiable facts regarding the human brain,
composed to a single train of thought with no specific order.
At this stage [[NoSoul]] is also very young.
[[Jaccuse]] is a case study of an assasination attempt inside a modern day family.
It is a factual, accurate, unbalanced descriotion of events.

There is no opinion, other than unbalanced opinion.
The balance comes from the free disemination of information and opinion, not from its guarding police.

Unlike in the library, with wikibooks,
one could say, ''lets delete this one'',
or one could say, ''lets fix this one''.

I noticed the deleting and fixing part is what most wikibookiwhateverans do most of the time,
as the content creation originality of this army is strictly forbidden.

With an Encyclopedia, the balance comes from the fact that each
concept is a separate entity shared in its creation by many.

If you understand the Verifiable Statistical fact that a [http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/textbook textbook] is
created by only one or a few,
then you surely also understand that you will have to police its content forever if you want it to remain balanced.
You will be forever at war with any creator, while hardly anyone else cares.

==== [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminus_%28planet%29 Terminus] Pride of a Volunteer ====

I am a proud wikipedian.
I lost my pride as a wikibookedian - ''even thuogh this is much more fitting my life's mission'' - due to opinion control regulations.

I thank the creators of the wikipedia software for having
enlightened me with some minor software details.
I will continue to thank the wikipedia by working
frantically for its declared purpose with dedication.

My textbook writings I will keep at theora.com as before,
with my open souce software presenting it, aided by some tricks
I learned from the wikipedia software.
it is also more financially beneficial for me this way.

==== You are free to read unbalanced textbooks if you wish ====

If you have enough freedom in your mind to read unbalanced thoughts and
make your own judgement,
those books, and a few others, are at theora.com.

My blog is also there, at the home page, usually relying on verifiable
facts, and it is hillarious.

e.g.

==== The Big Banging of God ==== 

Here is a textbook in its entirety you can study for years
and still have a lot to learn.

It discusses a very tough educational problem
where many opinions are required for the purpose of balance
and proper education on the subject.

The opinions in this textbook are very '''carefully and precisely balanced''', ''for educational purposes''.

This in itself is a form of presentation of ''my own opinion'',
and is therefore intrinsically unbalanced,
regardless of my superb objectivity.

You will need to be knwoledgable
or read on for quite some time to discover the
validity of any of the above statements.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Accounting Operations: Credit &amp; Debit ==

Accounting approaches the world of economic transactions from the viewpoint of Capital Transformation. Accounting books record the source of the Capital and the form it takes after passing through a company's productive &amp; administrative mechanism. Since Accounting wants to capture these two pieces of information (whence the Capital comes - to what it is transformed), it needs two operations - and Accounting has indeed two and two only operations: Credit &amp; Debit. Traditionally we always say &quot;Debit &amp; Credit&quot; and we always put &quot;Debits&quot; to the &quot;left&quot; (of a page) and &quot;Credits&quot; to the &quot;right&quot; (of a page). But causally speaking, the act which the operation &quot;Credit&quot; captures comes first: because Credit shows the source of the Capital, while Debit shows to what the capital has been transformed before. That's why &quot;A Debit must always equal the corresponding Credit&quot;.

Suppose now that the company's Board of Directors, after receiving the cash from the shareholders, decides to spend it in order to buy new productive equipment, striking a deal with a supplier to pay him or her after 60 days from purchasing the equipment.
In order to reflect this transaction we need to record two different Accounting Entries.

A) The purchasing of the equipment under 60 days credit terms. Here, since we are buying &quot;on credit&quot;, the supplier essentially supplies us with Capital (for 60 days). So we will Credit the Suppliers Account in order to show that we initially are buying the equipment using the suppliers capital, and we will Debit a Fixed Assets account (with equal amount) in order to show that we transformed this capital into Equipment.

B) The cash payment for the equipment after 60 days. Here Accounting sees that capital available to us in the form of Cash (the initial shareholders capital increase in cash), is transformed into Capital returned to supplier. So we will Credit our Bank Account (to show whence capital comes), and we will Debit the Suppliers Account to show to what we have transformed this capital (into Capital Returned to the Supplier).
===== For each transaction, the sum of credits equals the sum of debits =====
The difficulty is the exercise of correct categorization of which accounts to debit , which to credit, and by what amounts.

===== The first categorization of accounts is whether the account is an asset account, liability account , equity account , income or expense account =====
In general, debits increase the left side, and credits increase the right side (of the equation : assets= liabilities + equity ).

Hence ,  &lt;u&gt;debits increase asset accounts&lt;/u&gt; , &lt;u&gt;credits increase liability accounts&lt;/u&gt;, &lt;u&gt;credits increase equity accounts&lt;/u&gt;. Income can be thought as increasing equity, so &lt;u&gt;credits increase income accounts&lt;/u&gt;. Expenses decrease equity, so it is the  opposite of Income, so &lt;u&gt;debits increase expense accounts&lt;/u&gt;.  

(After a while, it becomes almost automatic to record an expense as a debit to an expense account, and a credit to an asset account (cash) , or a credit to a liability account (payable); a sale as as a debit to cash , or a debit to accounts receivable, and a credit to sales account; a inventory purchase as a debit to inventory, and a credit to cash , or a credit to accounts payable ; a loan as a debit to cash in bank, and a credit to bank loan account (liability)  . 

It is also customary, that debits are written down first , then credits, when recording initially in chronological order in the general journal ).  

Once these are gotten used to by practice , there may be also a need to think of ''contra-accounts'', such as contra-asset accounts such as accumulated depreciation, or 
contra-equity accounts such as Recovered Bad Debts previously written off.

== Forms of Capital ==
As the above example indicated, &quot;capital&quot; in the world of Accounting, can take many forms. We can state the following all-encompassing definition:
'''Any debt of a company, with or without interest, that is &lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt; paid in cash or otherwise settled, at the moment it is recorded in the Accounting Books, becomes capital given to the company'''.

Essentially then, &quot;capital given to a company&quot; is the amount that the company must return to its creditors. And we record as &quot;capital&quot; even temporarily unpaid debt. For example, suppose that from the payroll of a certain month, you have deducted from the employees' salary a payroll tax that you should pay to the State. If this payment, according to the relevant laws, must be executed three months after the month to which it originates, then for these three months, the state has given to you an amount of capital equal to the Payroll tax amount.

== So what are we actually seeing in a Balance Sheet? ==
In a Balance Sheet we have three main headlines: Assets, Liabilities, Owner's Equity (aka Equity). In many countries, Assets are shown in the left of the page, while Owners' Equity to the top right and Liabilities to the lower right.

Now, it is a fundamental Accounting rule that &quot;Assets = Owners' Equity + Liabilities&quot;. But why?

...If we use the &quot;Capital Transformation&quot; approach, we can understand why: &quot;Assets&quot; are of course what the word Assets means. But at the same time they show to us to what the company has transformed the capital given to it by... whom?

a) The Shareholders (&quot;Owner's Equity&quot;), and b) Everybody Else (Liabilities). 
In Equity we see the amount that is to be returned to the Shareholders, after all Assets are liquidated and all Liabilities are paid in full. In that sense, &quot;Owners' Equity&quot; is also a liability for the company: A company does not own anything - it owes all of its Assets to somebody, Third Parties or its Shareholders. A company is a separate entity from its owners.

In Liabilities, we see the amounts that the company owes to third parties - Suppliers, Banks, Internal Revenue Service, etc. At the same time they show to us &quot;whence the capital came&quot;. 

So the right side of a Balance Sheet shows how much capital and from whom the company has managed to get at the specific moment of the balance sheet (from third parties-&quot;Liabilities&quot; or from its own shareholders-&quot;Equity&quot;). On the left side of the Balance Sheet, we see to what the company has transformed this capital-&quot;Assets&quot;. '''Again, we are talking about the same capital, the same quantity'''. So the &quot;right side&quot; (Equity + Liabilities) '''must''' equal the &quot;left side&quot; (Assets).

== Alternative views of accountancy principles ==
Accountancy may have been an elaboration of an accidental discovery, much like the tale Archimedes and the bathtub discovery of 
water volume displacement equals floating object volume. Some idly rich mathematicians found that assets equals liabilities plus equities. 

The official story is that accountancy was first systematically expounded by Luca Pacioli in the Renaissance, who in a section of a mathematical book he is generally thought to have written, describes the Venetian method, or '''double entry accounting.'''  

Double entry accounting maintains the assertion or constraint that''' assets = liabilities + equity'''. It gives rise to the concept of periodic '''trial balances''', where the equation is checked at the end of a period. There is also a concept of '''closing entries''', where  in addition to the more permanent account types of '''asset''' accounts, '''liability''' accounts, and '''equity''' accounts, there are ''temporary'' operational '''income''' accounts  and '''expense''' accounts, which are updated ideally throughout a period of operation, or as a minimum,  before the end of a reporting period with journalised historical data, and '''closed off''' , i.e. ''the result of income minus expenses is added to equity , and the temporary income and expense accounts made to have zero balances for the next reporting period''. 

There is also the concept of '''accrual''' vs '''cash''' accounting  : cash accounting requires an entry whenever cash is exchanged , so doesn't record borrowings or loans , and therefore isn't very sufficient , whereas accrual accounting makes a recording whenever an enforceable or highly probable obligation arises for the future movement of cash to an entity ( receivables, a subtype of asset ), or out of an entity ( liabilities) occur. 

Because there are transactions that are accrued , they record an obligation, later transactions are needed to record when obligations are met. Some obligations gradually are met over time, so are calculated according to the amount of time that has expired since the last calculation was made and recorded , and these fall under the category
of '''adjusting entries'''. Examples of end of period adjusting entries include the recording depreciation,  usage of prepaid expenses such as insurance, rent ,  the performance of services paid in advance by customers ( unearned revenue fulfillment ).  End of period adjusting entries are made before the closing entries that closes off temporary income and expense accounts and updates equity. 

There are other uses of adjusting entries, such as in adjusting entries for subsequent periods. These occur because end of period deadlines may be straddled by the periods
for which prepayments exist, or periods for which current liabilities fall due, and because these are only partially accounted for in the end of period adjusting entries.

===== Illustrative example of role of adjusting entries ===== 
Pay day is fortnightly and last falls on June 23 for the last accounting period, so on 30th June, a '''end of period adjusting entry''' is made to salaries payable for the employee Joe who earns $2000 per fortnight,
and an entry is made to salaries payable for $1000, or 7 days of 14 days.  Closing entries  then close off the salary expense account to zero balance, as profit is calculated as sum of income minus sum of expenses and added to equity (owner capital ) , and any owner drawings are subtracted from capital. Then pay day occurs on 7th of July in the next period, but instead of debiting $2000 from salary expense as usual, $1000 is debited from salary payable (which removes the previous recorded liability), and $1000 is debited to salary expense , ( the other side of the double entry is a credit of $2000 to the cash-in-bank asset account , which is unchanged from the normal entry ).    This non-regular apportioning of an entry to account for end of period adjustments is  termed '''adjusting entries for subsequent periods.''' 
As a side note, this irregularity of entry can be avoided by making ''preempting adjusting entries at the beginning of a period'' , which are quite artificial : these are called '''reversing entries''' . 

In the previous example, the ''opening reversing entry'' would be a debit to salary payable of $1000 and a credit of salary expense of $1000, leaving the salary expense account in the situation of being $1000 in credit (if there is only Joe on the payroll) since the salary expense account was cleared to zero with a closing entry from the last period (this situation seems artificial because expense accounts are normally in debit). However, this allows the normal pay day entry on the 7th July for $2000 dr to salary expense, to leave the salary expense account in the correct $1000 DR balance, given the other $1000 had been previously accounted for in the previous period ( it was recorded as the end of period accrued adjusting entry to salary expense mentioned at the start of the example ; even though there had been no exchange of cash at the time, the work had been done and therefore owed ).

===== Basic financial statements from the adjusted trial balance =====
The usefulness of double entry accounting is that the equation assets equals liabilities plus equities should always hold after each double entry , 
and can be done once after adjusting entries are made , called an '''adjusted trial balance''' . From the adjusted trial balance, 3 different parts can be used
to produce 3 basic reporting statements,  the income statement, the statement of change of equities and the ending balance sheet. 

Each statement depends on the previous statement. &lt;u&gt;The income statement&lt;/u&gt; is a summary of the temporary income and expenses accounts, and states a profit. The profit is shown in &lt;u&gt;the statement of change of equity&lt;/u&gt;, where  ''beginning capital'' amount is added to the ''profit'' from the period, any ''drawings'' amount subtracted,  and the '''ending capital''' amount is determined .

Thirdly, &lt;u&gt;the balance sheet&lt;/u&gt;  shows the ending amounts of the permanent accounts ( excluding income and expense accounts , which have been closed off), with the '''ending capital''' from ''the statement of change of equity'' as the capital stated in the equity section. It will show that the sum of the asset accounts less the sum of the liabilities , is equal to the ending capital (equity ).

===== Why financial statements, or why accountancy ? =====    
Another view of accountancy principles is existential justification. When isn't it necessary to practice accountancy ? 
Some people feel accountancy is mainly of benefit when a certain threshold of money is involved ,&lt;u&gt;and&lt;/u&gt; there is use of other people's money. It is those
other parties that need to be accounted to. Otherwise, accountancy becomes an exercise of not letting oneself defraud oneself unwittingly.

===== If a need for accountancy exists, what qualities make it sufficient ? =====
If it is given that a need exists for accountancy - e.g. some hotshot is playing with some retiree's lifetimes earnings, and could lose it to some undeserving employee of a merchant bank who spends it on cocaine and a collection of porsches , it may be useful to name what qualities might make the results of doing accountancy useful.

4 memorable qualities might be '''understandable''', '''relevant''', '''reliable''', and '''comparable'''. 

Financial statements should be &lt;u&gt;understandable&lt;/u&gt; : usually they are, because there is almost a standard format for statements of income, change in equity, balance sheet, and cash flow. Even so, it is still common practice that these understandable items aren't analysed by spruikers of investing opportunities in a standard way. 

Even if the statements are understandable, they could suffer from being irrelevant or unreliable. 

&lt;u&gt;Relevance&lt;/u&gt; / materiality means if something is included or excluded from financial statements, it can affect the economic decisions of investors if the opposite was true. Including immaterial stuff can paint a too rosy picture, and excluding material stuff can be hiding big problems. 

&lt;u&gt;Reliability&lt;/u&gt; sounds like relevance, and it begs the question as to whether something can be relevant and unreliable, but it appears to mean that one should not take the accrual principle too far. Examples of accrual in action, is the allowance for bad debts, and provisions for contigent liabilities. As an example of something unreliable is making a recording of an asset some financial product backed by subprime mortgage parcels. Another , which might also lack relevance, is having a major controlling shareholding in a company financed by margin lending, and this amount of equity included in the previous balance sheet. The major shareholder is a separate accounting entity, so doesn't have to reveal his liabilities in the balance sheet, but the amount stated as shareholder equity is in hindsight , unreliable, after a margin call is made.

Another example of unreliable accounting, is having an accumulated provisions for the possibility of fire account as a cash account reserved in theory for the provision, instead of buying prepaid insurance for a specific amount , as the latter is more reliable because there is documentation , a provisioned amount is certain and it is probable that it sufficiently provides for the contingency.
 
Finally , &lt;u&gt;comparability&lt;/u&gt; means that accounting is done similiar enough to other companies to make comparisons , as well being able to compare the accounts between different accounting periods of the same company, because enough information is given when policy changes are made, e.g. to the type of accounting made for inventory .

      <text xml:space="preserve">NOTE: This tutorial is for new installations of '''osDate''', and not for upgrades of existing osDate installations. Installation of the forum and instant messenger are not included. These will follow in another section.

To install '''osDate''' is simple, quick and easy. Before you start, you need to know a few things first.

*You can download software to load on your own personal computer, that turns your computer into a webserver. This server is not accessible to other people who access the internet, unless you have set the configurations for people to do so. This is done by web developers to develop and test websites &quot;locally&quot; first, before the website is loaded to a &quot;live&quot; webserver for the public or other parties to access. This is called a '''local server'''.
*A live webserver refers to a webserver that is specifically setup for hosting websites, and in general can be accessed by anyone who has internet connectivity.

== Hosting ==

Quite obvious, isn't it? You need to have a website hosting solution to host your website. Get a hosting solution that is suitable for your needs. The technology you need to meet your requirements will change because it is always advancing. At the time of writing, typically you'd need:

On the server side:

* PHP 4.3.0 or higher
* MySQL 3.23 or higher 
* Ability to change the permissions of files and folders 
* PHP GD or GD2 
* Flash 7 Player or higher 

On the client (your) side:

* An FTP client. The FTP client is an application that allows you to transfer files from your computer to the webserver.
* Cpanel access. Cpanel access to the webserver is vital, as you will need to log into the admin side of your user account on the webserver to be able to create a new database.

== Download Installation Files And Patches ==

* Download the latest version of [http://www.tufat.com/s_free_dating_system.htm osDate]
* Download the [http://www.tufat.com/forum/showthread.php?t=19519 patches and updates]
* Patch the files before uploading to the server.

Patching normally involves replacing existing files with the new &quot;patches&quot;, for example, in the downloaded patches, there could be a folder called ''public_html'', and in this folder there might be a file called ''config.php ''. What you do now is this:

In the downloaded installations files folder, you look for the folder called '''public_html''', and in that folder you look for the file called '''config.php ''' . You now replace the original ''config.php '' file in the ''public_html'' folder from the original downloaded files with the new ''config.php'' from the downloaded patches files.

Simple, isn't it?

== Load The Files To The Webserver ==

Using your FTP Client, create a directory in your user account folder to load the files to. 
Call it what you like, for example '''osdate'''. In this newly created folder (osdate), create another folder and name it what your website will be called. For example: '''my-dating-site'''.

The directory structure should look something like this:

'''your_user_account\osdate\my_dating_site'''

Using your FTP Client, upload the files to this directory on the webserver. Use an FTP client that has an Auto function.. [http://www.coreftp.com/ Core FTP] has been used for a few years with no issues, set it to Auto and forget it.  

== Setting File And Folder Permissions ==

These settings are for the files and folders on the webserver.

Using your FTP Client, right click on a folder or file, in the pop-up menu, click on properties, and there the properties (CHMOD) for that file or folder will be displayed. Before installation:

In the '''&quot;public_html&quot;''' folder, set the following folder permissions:

'''FOLDER''' ==&gt;''' banners'''       ==&gt; change CHMOD to ==&gt; '''777'''

'''FOLDER''' ==&gt; '''cache'''         ==&gt; change CHMOD to ==&gt; '''777'''

'''FOLDER''' ==&gt; '''emailimages'''   ==&gt; change CHMOD to ==&gt; '''777'''

'''FOLDER''' ==&gt; '''temp'''          ==&gt; change CHMOD to ==&gt; '''777'''

'''FOLDER''' ==&gt; '''templates'''     ==&gt; change CHMOD to ==&gt; '''777'''

'''FOLDER''' ==&gt; '''templates_c'''   ==&gt; change CHMOD to ==&gt; '''777''' 

'''FOLDER''' ==&gt; '''userimages'''    ==&gt; change CHMOD to ==&gt; '''777'''

In the folder '''&quot;public_html&quot;''', set the following file permissions:

'''FILE''' ==&gt; '''config.php'''      ==&gt; change CHMOD to ==&gt; '''777'''

In the '''public_html''' folder, there is another folder called '''forum'''.

In the '''forum''' folder, set the following file permissions:

'''FILE''' ==&gt; '''config.php'''      ==&gt; change CHMOD to ==&gt; '''777'''


{{Yellow Warning| Do not confuse the file '''config.php''' in the '''forum''' folder with the file '''config.php''' in the &quot;public_html&quot; folder, although both need to have the same CHMOD settings.}}


After installation set the file permissions as low as possible. Start with 400. Some servers will not allow permissions lower than 644.

==Create A Database ==

Using '''phpMyAdmin''', in the '''CPanel''' of your user account on the webserver, create a database on your server and name it '''your_database_name'''. I suggest using a simple name related to what your site is going to be called. For this tutorial, I will name the database '''mydatabase'''.

== osDate Installation Screen (1) ==

You are now ready to begin the installation. Using your webbrowser, enter the location of your osDate files:

If osDate is installed on a '''local server''', in your browser's addressbar you will type in:  
'''localhost/osdate/my_dating_site''' .

'''your_user_account\osdate\my_dating_site'''

If osDate is installed on a '''live server''' (non-local server), in your browser's addressbar you will type in: 
'''www.yourdomain.com''' (or net, or org, or whatever yours is)&quot; if your osdate is the main part of your site. 

If osdate will only be a secondary feature of your site, i.e., you want your main site to load, then people will click on a link to actually access the osDate part of it), then put your osDate files into another folder within your public_html documents, and access it like so: 
'''www.yourdomain.com/thefolderosdateisin/'''. 

Don't forget to change the Doc Root entry in your configuration files to show you have placed it in a secondary folder. Instead of it being &quot;/&quot;, it would now be &quot;/thefolderosdateisin/&quot;

The following screen will appear:

Click on '''install.php''' in the above screen to continue.

== osDate Installation Screen (2) ==

The next screen will appear after clicking on &quot;install.php&quot;.

If there are any errors, or you didn't set the correct file and folder permissions first, the following screen will appear.

{{Yellow Warning|If there are any errors reported above, you will have to fix them first!}}

You can use the script to fix the errors, I just find it easier to do the CHMOD settings using my FTP Client.

If there are no errors, a screen will appear - click on Continue
== osDate Installation Screen (3) ==
The next screen will appear - fill in the relevant information.

'''Database Name:''' (enter your database name here) '''mydatabase'''

'''Database User:''' (enter the database username here) '''your_user_account_name'''

'''Database Password:''' (enter the database password here, if you created one) '''your_database_password'''

'''Database Host:''' (the default is localhost) usually localhost

'''Database Type:''' (the default is MySQL) This is the type of database that is running on the webserver

'''Table Prefix:'''  (the default is osdate) Change this if you want to, but can be left as is.

'''Document Root:''' /osDate/my_dating_site/public_html/ (leave default)

'''Admin Password:''' (enter the password you want to use for the admin section of your dating site)

'''Confirm Password:''' (re-enter the password you want to use for the admin section)

'''Default Language:''' (the default is English) (leave this as default, will install later)

'''Country:''' (the default is United States) (select the country where the webserver is)

If you load extra languages at this point, the installation may time out. Rather leave it until the whole installation has completed successfully and then load the other languages you want to install from the Admin Page.

When all is done, and all the information is correct, you can continue. Click on '''Continue'''. If any of the information you entered is incorrect, you will be returned to the above screen with an error message.

Edit the information and make sure that this time the information is correct and click on '''Continue'''

== osDate Installation Screen (4) ==

If you try to load zip codes at this stage, there is a chance that the server may time out. Rather leave it until the whole installation has been finalized, and then you can load zip codes from the Admin Page. Don't select any zip codes, and click on '''Continue without loading'''

== osDate Installation Screen (5) ==

Dance around the room or office, as you are very close to being finished!

Click on '''Continue'''

== osDate Installation Screen (6) ==

In this screen you enter your SMTP settings. This will all depend on how your hosting is setup, and how you want the mail to be sent.

'''More on this to follow soon!'''

After entering the correct information, and making sure all is correct, click on '''Continue'''

==Federalist No. 61==
Federalist No. 61 is titled ''&quot;The Same Subject Continued: Concerning the Power of Congress to Regulate the Election of Members&quot;''. This Federalist Paper was written by Alexander Hamilton.

===Text===
''To the People of the State of New York:''

''THE more candid opposers of the provision respecting elections, contained in the plan of the convention, when pressed in argument, will sometimes concede the propriety of that provision; with this qualification, however, that it ought to have been accompanied with a declaration, that all elections should be had in the counties where the electors resided. This, say they, was a necessary precaution against an abuse of the power. A declaration of this nature would certainly have been harmless; so far as it would have had the effect of quieting apprehensions, it might not have been undesirable. But it would, in fact, have afforded little or no additional security against the danger apprehended; and the want of it will never be considered, by an impartial and judicious examiner, as a serious, still less as an insuperable, objection to the plan. The different views taken of the subject in the two preceding papers must be sufficient to satisfy all dispassionate and discerning men, that if the public liberty should ever be the victim of the ambition of the national rulers, the power under examination, at least, will be guiltless of the sacrifice.''

''If those who are inclined to consult their jealousy only, would exercise it in a careful inspection of the several State constitutions, they would find little less room for disquietude and alarm, from the latitude which most of them allow in respect to elections, than from the latitude which is proposed to be allowed to the national government in the same respect. A review of their situation, in this particular, would tend greatly to remove any ill impressions which may remain in regard to this matter. But as that view would lead into long and tedious details, I shall content myself with the single example of the State in which I write. The constitution of New York makes no other provision for LOCALITY of elections, than that the members of the Assembly shall be elected in the COUNTIES; those of the Senate, in the great districts into which the State is or may be divided: these at present are four in number, and comprehend each from two to six counties. It may readily be perceived that it would not be more difficult to the legislature of New York to defeat the suffrages of the citizens of New York, by confining elections to particular places, than for the legislature of the United States to defeat the suffrages of the citizens of the Union, by the like expedient. Suppose, for instance, the city of Albany was to be appointed the sole place of election for the county and district of which it is a part, would not the inhabitants of that city speedily become the only electors of the members both of the Senate and Assembly for that county and district? Can we imagine that the electors who reside in the remote subdivisions of the counties of Albany, Saratoga, Cambridge, etc., or in any part of the county of Montgomery, would take the trouble to come to the city of Albany, to give their votes for members of the Assembly or Senate, sooner than they would repair to the city of New York, to participate in the choice of the members of the federal House of Representatives? The alarming indifference discoverable in the exercise of so invaluable a privilege under the existing laws, which afford every facility to it, furnishes a ready answer to this question. And, abstracted from any experience on the subject, we can be at no loss to determine, that when the place of election is at an INCONVENIENT DISTANCE from the elector, the effect upon his conduct will be the same whether that distance be twenty miles or twenty thousand miles. Hence it must appear, that objections to the particular modification of the federal power of regulating elections will, in substance, apply with equal force to the modification of the like power in the constitution of this State; and for this reason it will be impossible to acquit the one, and to condemn the other. A similar comparison would lead to the same conclusion in respect to the constitutions of most of the other States.''

''If it should be said that defects in the State constitutions furnish no apology for those which are to be found in the plan proposed, I answer, that as the former have never been thought chargeable with inattention to the security of liberty, where the imputations thrown on the latter can be shown to be applicable to them also, the presumption is that they are rather the cavilling refinements of a predetermined opposition, than the well-founded inferences of a candid research after truth. To those who are disposed to consider, as innocent omissions in the State constitutions, what they regard as unpardonable blemishes in the plan of the convention, nothing can be said; or at most, they can only be asked to assign some substantial reason why the representatives of the people in a single State should be more impregnable to the lust of power, or other sinister motives, than the representatives of the people of the United States? If they cannot do this, they ought at least to prove to us that it is easier to subvert the liberties of three millions of people, with the advantage of local governments to head their opposition, than of two hundred thousand people who are destitute of that advantage. And in relation to the point immediately under consideration, they ought to convince us that it is less probable that a predominant faction in a single State should, in order to maintain its superiority, incline to a preference of a particular class of electors, than that a similar spirit should take possession of the representatives of thirteen States, spread over a vast region, and in several respects distinguishable from each other by a diversity of local circumstances, prejudices, and interests.''

''Hitherto my observations have only aimed at a vindication of the provision in question, on the ground of theoretic propriety, on that of the danger of placing the power elsewhere, and on that of the safety of placing it in the manner proposed. But there remains to be mentioned a positive advantage which will result from this disposition, and which could not as well have been obtained from any other: I allude to the circumstance of uniformity in the time of elections for the federal House of Representatives. It is more than possible that this uniformity may be found by experience to be of great importance to the public welfare, both as a security against the perpetuation of the same spirit in the body, and as a cure for the diseases of faction. If each State may choose its own time of election, it is possible there may be at least as many different periods as there are months in the year. The times of election in the several States, as they are now established for local purposes, vary between extremes as wide as March and November. The consequence of this diversity would be that there could never happen a total dissolution or renovation of the body at one time. If an improper spirit of any kind should happen to prevail in it, that spirit would be apt to infuse itself into the new members, as they come forward in succession. The mass would be likely to remain nearly the same, assimilating constantly to itself its gradual accretions. There is a contagion in example which few men have sufficient force of mind to resist. I am inclined to think that treble the duration in office, with the condition of a total dissolution of the body at the same time, might be less formidable to liberty than one third of that duration subject to gradual and successive alterations.''

''Uniformity in the time of elections seems not less requisite for executing the idea of a regular rotation in the Senate, and for conveniently assembling the legislature at a stated period in each year.''

''It may be asked, Why, then, could not a time have been fixed in the Constitution? As the most zealous adversaries of the plan of the convention in this State are, in general, not less zealous admirers of the constitution of the State, the question may be retorted, and it may be asked, Why was not a time for the like purpose fixed in the constitution of this State? No better answer can be given than that it was a matter which might safely be entrusted to legislative discretion; and that if a time had been appointed, it might, upon experiment, have been found less convenient than some other time. The same answer may be given to the question put on the other side. And it may be added that the supposed danger of a gradual change being merely speculative, it would have been hardly advisable upon that speculation to establish, as a fundamental point, what would deprive several States of the convenience of having the elections for their own governments and for the national government at the same epochs.''

''PUBLIUS.''

===Analysis===
This Federalist Paper is the last of three papers discussing the power of Congress over the election of its own members.

==Federalist No. 62==
Federalist No. 62 is titled ''&quot;The Senate&quot;''. This Federalist Paper was written by Alexander Hamilton or James Madison.

===Text===
''To the People of the State of New York:''

''HAVING examined the constitution of the House of Representatives, and answered such of the objections against it as seemed to merit notice, I enter next on the examination of the Senate.''

''The heads into which this member of the government may be considered are: I. The qualification of senators; II. The appointment of them by the State legislatures; III. The equality of representation in the Senate; IV. The number of senators, and the term for which they are to be elected; V. The powers vested in the Senate.''

''I. The qualifications proposed for senators, as distinguished from those of representatives, consist in a more advanced age and a longer period of citizenship. A senator must be thirty years of age at least; as a representative must be twenty-five. And the former must have been a citizen nine years; as seven years are required for the latter. The propriety of these distinctions is explained by the nature of the senatorial trust, which, requiring greater extent of information and stability of character, requires at the same time that the senator should have reached a period of life most likely to supply these advantages; and which, participating immediately in transactions with foreign nations, ought to be exercised by none who are not thoroughly weaned from the prepossessions and habits incident to foreign birth and education. The term of nine years appears to be a prudent mediocrity between a total exclusion of adopted citizens, whose merits and talents may claim a share in the public confidence, and an indiscriminate and hasty admission of them, which might create a channel for foreign influence on the national councils.''

''II. It is equally unnecessary to dilate on the appointment of senators by the State legislatures. Among the various modes which might have been devised for constituting this branch of the government, that which has been proposed by the convention is probably the most congenial with the public opinion. It is recommended by the double advantage of favoring a select appointment, and of giving to the State governments such an agency in the formation of the federal government as must secure the authority of the former, and may form a convenient link between the two systems.''

''III. The equality of representation in the Senate is another point, which, being evidently the result of compromise between the opposite pretensions of the large and the small States, does not call for much discussion. If indeed it be right, that among a people thoroughly incorporated into one nation, every district ought to have a PROPORTIONAL share in the government, and that among independent and sovereign States, bound together by a simple league, the parties, however unequal in size, ought to have an EQUAL share in the common councils, it does not appear to be without some reason that in a compound republic, partaking both of the national and federal character, the government ought to be founded on a mixture of the principles of proportional and equal representation. But it is superfluous to try, by the standard of theory, a part of the Constitution which is allowed on all hands to be the result, not of theory, but &quot;of a spirit of amity, and that mutual deference and concession which the peculiarity of our political situation rendered indispensable.&quot; A common government, with powers equal to its objects, is called for by the voice, and still more loudly by the political situation, of America. A government founded on principles more consonant to the wishes of the larger States, is not likely to be obtained from the smaller States. The only option, then, for the former, lies between the proposed government and a government still more objectionable. Under this alternative, the advice of prudence must be to embrace the lesser evil; and, instead of indulging a fruitless anticipation of the possible mischiefs which may ensue, to contemplate rather the advantageous consequences which may qualify the sacrifice.''

''In this spirit it may be remarked, that the equal vote allowed to each State is at once a constitutional recognition of the portion of sovereignty remaining in the individual States, and an instrument for preserving that residuary sovereignty. So far the equality ought to be no less acceptable to the large than to the small States; since they are not less solicitous to guard, by every possible expedient, against an improper consolidation of the States into one simple republic.''

''Another advantage accruing from this ingredient in the constitution of the Senate is, the additional impediment it must prove against improper acts of legislation. No law or resolution can now be passed without the concurrence, first, of a majority of the people, and then, of a majority of the States. It must be acknowledged that this complicated check on legislation may in some instances be injurious as well as beneficial; and that the peculiar defense which it involves in favor of the smaller States, would be more rational, if any interests common to them, and distinct from those of the other States, would otherwise be exposed to peculiar danger. But as the larger States will always be able, by their power over the supplies, to defeat unreasonable exertions of this prerogative of the lesser States, and as the faculty and excess of law-making seem to be the diseases to which our governments are most liable, it is not impossible that this part of the Constitution may be more convenient in practice than it appears to many in contemplation.''

''IV. The number of senators, and the duration of their appointment, come next to be considered. In order to form an accurate judgment on both of these points, it will be proper to inquire into the purposes which are to be answered by a senate; and in order to ascertain these, it will be necessary to review the inconveniences which a republic must suffer from the want of such an institution.''

''First. It is a misfortune incident to republican government, though in a less degree than to other governments, that those who administer it may forget their obligations to their constituents, and prove unfaithful to their important trust. In this point of view, a senate, as a second branch of the legislative assembly, distinct from, and dividing the power with, a first, must be in all cases a salutary check on the government. It doubles the security to the people, by requiring the concurrence of two distinct bodies in schemes of usurpation or perfidy, where the ambition or corruption of one would otherwise be sufficient. This is a precaution founded on such clear principles, and now so well understood in the United States, that it would be more than superfluous to enlarge on it. I will barely remark, that as the improbability of sinister combinations will be in proportion to the dissimilarity in the genius of the two bodies, it must be politic to distinguish them from each other by every circumstance which will consist with a due harmony in all proper measures, and with the genuine principles of republican government.''

''Secondly. The necessity of a senate is not less indicated by the propensity of all single and numerous assemblies to yield to the impulse of sudden and violent passions, and to be seduced by factious leaders into intemperate and pernicious resolutions. Examples on this subject might be cited without number; and from proceedings within the United States, as well as from the history of other nations. But a position that will not be contradicted, need not be proved. All that need be remarked is, that a body which is to correct this infirmity ought itself to be free from it, and consequently ought to be less numerous. It ought, moreover, to possess great firmness, and consequently ought to hold its authority by a tenure of considerable duration.''

''Thirdly. Another defect to be supplied by a senate lies in a want of due acquaintance with the objects and principles of legislation. It is not possible that an assembly of men called for the most part from pursuits of a private nature, continued in appointment for a short time, and led by no permanent motive to devote the intervals of public occupation to a study of the laws, the affairs, and the comprehensive interests of their country, should, if left wholly to themselves, escape a variety of important errors in the exercise of their legislative trust. It may be affirmed, on the best grounds, that no small share of the present embarrassments of America is to be charged on the blunders of our governments; and that these have proceeded from the heads rather than the hearts of most of the authors of them. What indeed are all the repealing, explaining, and amending laws, which fill and disgrace our voluminous codes, but so many monuments of deficient wisdom; so many impeachments exhibited by each succeeding against each preceding session; so many admonitions to the people, of the value of those aids which may be expected from a well-constituted senate?''

''A good government implies two things: first, fidelity to the object of government, which is the happiness of the people; secondly, a knowledge of the means by which that object can be best attained. Some governments are deficient in both these qualities; most governments are deficient in the first. I scruple not to assert, that in American governments too little attention has been paid to the last. The federal Constitution avoids this error; and what merits particular notice, it provides for the last in a mode which increases the security for the first.''

''Fourthly. The mutability in the public councils arising from a rapid succession of new members, however qualified they may be, points out, in the strongest manner, the necessity of some stable institution in the government. Every new election in the States is found to change one half of the representatives. From this change of men must proceed a change of opinions; and from a change of opinions, a change of measures. But a continual change even of good measures is inconsistent with every rule of prudence and every prospect of success. The remark is verified in private life, and becomes more just, as well as more important, in national transactions''

''To trace the mischievous effects of a mutable government would fill a volume. I will hint a few only, each of which will be perceived to be a source of innumerable others.''

''In the first place, it forfeits the respect and confidence of other nations, and all the advantages connected with national character. An individual who is observed to be inconstant to his plans, or perhaps to carry on his affairs without any plan at all, is marked at once, by all prudent people, as a speedy victim to his own unsteadiness and folly. His more friendly neighbors may pity him, but all will decline to connect their fortunes with his; and not a few will seize the opportunity of making their fortunes out of his. One nation is to another what one individual is to another; with this melancholy distinction perhaps, that the former, with fewer of the benevolent emotions than the latter, are under fewer restraints also from taking undue advantage from the indiscretions of each other. Every nation, consequently, whose affairs betray a want of wisdom and stability, may calculate on every loss which can be sustained from the more systematic policy of their wiser neighbors. But the best instruction on this subject is unhappily conveyed to America by the example of her own situation. She finds that she is held in no respect by her friends; that she is the derision of her enemies; and that she is a prey to every nation which has an interest in speculating on her fluctuating councils and embarrassed affairs.''

''The internal effects of a mutable policy are still more calamitous. It poisons the blessing of liberty itself. It will be of little avail to the people, that the laws are made by men of their own choice, if the laws be so voluminous that they cannot be read, or so incoherent that they cannot be understood; if they be repealed or revised before they are promulgated, or undergo such incessant changes that no man, who knows what the law is to-day, can guess what it will be to-morrow. Law is defined to be a rule of action; but how can that be a rule, which is little known, and less fixed?''

''Another effect of public instability is the unreasonable advantage it gives to the sagacious, the enterprising, and the moneyed few over the industrious and uniformed mass of the people. Every new regulation concerning commerce or revenue, or in any way affecting the value of the different species of property, presents a new harvest to those who watch the change, and can trace its consequences; a harvest, reared not by themselves, but by the toils and cares of the great body of their fellow-citizens. This is a state of things in which it may be said with some truth that laws are made for the FEW, not for the MANY.''

''In another point of view, great injury results from an unstable government. The want of confidence in the public councils damps every useful undertaking, the success and profit of which may depend on a continuance of existing arrangements. What prudent merchant will hazard his fortunes in any new branch of commerce when he knows not but that his plans may be rendered unlawful before they can be executed? What farmer or manufacturer will lay himself out for the encouragement given to any particular cultivation or establishment, when he can have no assurance that his preparatory labors and advances will not render him a victim to an inconstant government? In a word, no great improvement or laudable enterprise can go forward which requires the auspices of a steady system of national policy.''

''But the most deplorable effect of all is that diminution of attachment and reverence which steals into the hearts of the people, towards a political system which betrays so many marks of infirmity, and disappoints so many of their flattering hopes. No government, any more than an individual, will long be respected without being truly respectable; nor be truly respectable, without possessing a certain portion of order and stability.''

''PUBLIUS.''

===Analysis===
This Federalist Paper is the first of two essays detailing, and seeking to justify, the organization of the [[w:United States Senate|United States Senate]].

==Federalist No. 63==
Federalist No. 63 is titled ''&quot;The Senate Continued&quot;''. This Federalist Paper was written by Alexander Hamilton or James Madison.

===Text===
''To the People of the State of New York:''

''A FIFTH desideratum, illustrating the utility of a senate, is the want of a due sense of national character. Without a select and stable member of the government, the esteem of foreign powers will not only be forfeited by an unenlightened and variable policy, proceeding from the causes already mentioned, but the national councils will not possess that sensibility to the opinion of the world, which is perhaps not less necessary in order to merit, than it is to obtain, its respect and confidence.''

''An attention to the judgment of other nations is important to every government for two reasons: the one is, that, independently of the merits of any particular plan or measure, it is desirable, on various accounts, that it should appear to other nations as the offspring of a wise and honorable policy; the second is, that in doubtful cases, particularly where the national councils may be warped by some strong passion or momentary interest, the presumed or known opinion of the impartial world may be the best guide that can be followed. What has not America lost by her want of character with foreign nations; and how many errors and follies would she not have avoided, if the justice and propriety of her measures had, in every instance, been previously tried by the light in which they would probably appear to the unbiased part of mankind?''

''Yet however requisite a sense of national character may be, it is evident that it can never be sufficiently possessed by a numerous and changeable body. It can only be found in a number so small that a sensible degree of the praise and blame of public measures may be the portion of each individual; or in an assembly so durably invested with public trust, that the pride and consequence of its members may be sensibly incorporated with the reputation and prosperity of the community. The half-yearly representatives of Rhode Island would probably have been little affected in their deliberations on the iniquitous measures of that State, by arguments drawn from the light in which such measures would be viewed by foreign nations, or even by the sister States; whilst it can scarcely be doubted that if the concurrence of a select and stable body had been necessary, a regard to national character alone would have prevented the calamities under which that misguided people is now laboring.''

''I add, as a SIXTH defect the want, in some important cases, of a due responsibility in the government to the people, arising from that frequency of elections which in other cases produces this responsibility. This remark will, perhaps, appear not only new, but paradoxical. It must nevertheless be acknowledged, when explained, to be as undeniable as it is important.''

''Responsibility, in order to be reasonable, must be limited to objects within the power of the responsible party, and in order to be effectual, must relate to operations of that power, of which a ready and proper judgment can be formed by the constituents. The objects of government may be divided into two general classes: the one depending on measures which have singly an immediate and sensible operation; the other depending on a succession of well-chosen and well-connected measures, which have a gradual and perhaps unobserved operation. The importance of the latter description to the collective and permanent welfare of every country, needs no explanation. And yet it is evident that an assembly elected for so short a term as to be unable to provide more than one or two links in a chain of measures, on which the general welfare may essentially depend, ought not to be answerable for the final result, any more than a steward or tenant, engaged for one year, could be justly made to answer for places or improvements which could not be accomplished in less than half a dozen years. Nor is it possible for the people to estimate the SHARE of influence which their annual assemblies may respectively have on events resulting from the mixed transactions of several years. It is sufficiently difficult to preserve a personal responsibility in the members of a NUMEROUS body, for such acts of the body as have an immediate, detached, and palpable operation on its constituents.''

''The proper remedy for this defect must be an additional body in the legislative department, which, having sufficient permanency to provide for such objects as require a continued attention, and a train of measures, may be justly and effectually answerable for the attainment of those objects.''

''Thus far I have considered the circumstances which point out the necessity of a well-constructed Senate only as they relate to the representatives of the people. To a people as little blinded by prejudice or corrupted by flattery as those whom I address, I shall not scruple to add, that such an institution may be sometimes necessary as a defense to the people against their own temporary errors and delusions. As the cool and deliberate sense of the community ought, in all governments, and actually will, in all free governments, ultimately prevail over the views of its rulers; so there are particular moments in public affairs when the people, stimulated by some irregular passion, or some illicit advantage, or misled by the artful misrepresentations of interested men, may call for measures which they themselves will afterwards be the most ready to lament and condemn. In these critical moments, how salutary will be the interference of some temperate and respectable body of citizens, in order to check the misguided career, and to suspend the blow meditated by the people against themselves, until reason, justice, and truth can regain their authority over the public mind? What bitter anguish would not the people of Athens have often escaped if their government had contained so provident a safeguard against the tyranny of their own passions? Popular liberty might then have escaped the indelible reproach of decreeing to the same citizens the hemlock on one day and statues on the next.''

''It may be suggested, that a people spread over an extensive region cannot, like the crowded inhabitants of a small district, be subject to the infection of violent passions, or to the danger of combining in pursuit of unjust measures. I am far from denying that this is a distinction of peculiar importance. I have, on the contrary, endeavored in a former paper to show, that it is one of the principal recommendations of a confederated republic. At the same time, this advantage ought not to be considered as superseding the use of auxiliary precautions. It may even be remarked, that the same extended situation, which will exempt the people of America from some of the dangers incident to lesser republics, will expose them to the inconveniency of remaining for a longer time under the influence of those misrepresentations which the combined industry of interested men may succeed in distributing among them.''

''It adds no small weight to all these considerations, to recollect that history informs us of no long-lived republic which had not a senate. Sparta, Rome, and Carthage are, in fact, the only states to whom that character can be applied. In each of the two first there was a senate for life. The constitution of the senate in the last is less known. Circumstantial evidence makes it probable that it was not different in this particular from the two others. It is at least certain, that it had some quality or other which rendered it an anchor against popular fluctuations; and that a smaller council, drawn out of the senate, was appointed not only for life, but filled up vacancies itself. These examples, though as unfit for the imitation, as they are repugnant to the genius, of America, are, notwithstanding, when compared with the fugitive and turbulent existence of other ancient republics, very instructive proofs of the necessity of some institution that will blend stability with liberty. I am not unaware of the circumstances which distinguish the American from other popular governments, as well ancient as modern; and which render extreme circumspection necessary, in reasoning from the one case to the other. But after allowing due weight to this consideration, it may still be maintained, that there are many points of similitude which render these examples not unworthy of our attention. Many of the defects, as we have seen, which can only be supplied by a senatorial institution, are common to a numerous assembly frequently elected by the people, and to the people themselves. There are others peculiar to the former, which require the control of such an institution. The people can never wilfully betray their own interests; but they may possibly be betrayed by the representatives of the people; and the danger will be evidently greater where the whole legislative trust is lodged in the hands of one body of men, than where the concurrence of separate and dissimilar bodies is required in every public act.''

''The difference most relied on, between the American and other republics, consists in the principle of representation; which is the pivot on which the former move, and which is supposed to have been unknown to the latter, or at least to the ancient part of them. The use which has been made of this difference, in reasonings contained in former papers, will have shown that I am disposed neither to deny its existence nor to undervalue its importance. I feel the less restraint, therefore, in observing, that the position concerning the ignorance of the ancient governments on the subject of representation, is by no means precisely true in the latitude commonly given to it. Without entering into a disquisition which here would be misplaced, I will refer to a few known facts, in support of what I advance.''

''In the most pure democracies of Greece, many of the executive functions were performed, not by the people themselves, but by officers elected by the people, and REPRESENTING the people in their EXECUTIVE capacity.''

''Prior to the reform of Solon, Athens was governed by nine Archons, annually ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE AT LARGE. The degree of power delegated to them seems to be left in great obscurity. Subsequent to that period, we find an assembly, first of four, and afterwards of six hundred members, annually ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE; and PARTIALLY representing them in their LEGISLATIVE capacity, since they were not only associated with the people in the function of making laws, but had the exclusive right of originating legislative propositions to the people. The senate of Carthage, also, whatever might be its power, or the duration of its appointment, appears to have been ELECTIVE by the suffrages of the people. Similar instances might be traced in most, if not all the popular governments of antiquity.''

''Lastly, in Sparta we meet with the Ephori, and in Rome with the Tribunes; two bodies, small indeed in numbers, but annually ELECTED BY THE WHOLE BODY OF THE PEOPLE, and considered as the REPRESENTATIVES of the people, almost in their PLENIPOTENTIARY capacity. The Cosmi of Crete were also annually ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE, and have been considered by some authors as an institution analogous to those of Sparta and Rome, with this difference only, that in the election of that representative body the right of suffrage was communicated to a part only of the people.''

''From these facts, to which many others might be added, it is clear that the principle of representation was neither unknown to the ancients nor wholly overlooked in their political constitutions. The true distinction between these and the American governments, lies IN THE TOTAL EXCLUSION OF THE PEOPLE, IN THEIR COLLECTIVE CAPACITY, from any share in the LATTER, and not in the TOTAL EXCLUSION OF THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PEOPLE from the administration of the FORMER. The distinction, however, thus qualified, must be admitted to leave a most advantageous superiority in favor of the United States. But to insure to this advantage its full effect, we must be careful not to separate it from the other advantage, of an extensive territory. For it cannot be believed, that any form of representative government could have succeeded within the narrow limits occupied by the democracies of Greece.''

''In answer to all these arguments, suggested by reason, illustrated by examples, and enforced by our own experience, the jealous adversary of the Constitution will probably content himself with repeating, that a senate appointed not immediately by the people, and for the term of six years, must gradually acquire a dangerous pre-eminence in the government, and finally transform it into a tyrannical aristocracy.''

''To this general answer, the general reply ought to be sufficient, that liberty may be endangered by the abuses of liberty as well as by the abuses of power; that there are numerous instances of the former as well as of the latter; and that the former, rather than the latter, are apparently most to be apprehended by the United States. But a more particular reply may be given.''

''Before such a revolution can be effected, the Senate, it is to be observed, must in the first place corrupt itself; must next corrupt the State legislatures; must then corrupt the House of Representatives; and must finally corrupt the people at large. It is evident that the Senate must be first corrupted before it can attempt an establishment of tyranny. Without corrupting the State legislatures, it cannot prosecute the attempt, because the periodical change of members would otherwise regenerate the whole body. Without exerting the means of corruption with equal success on the House of Representatives, the opposition of that coequal branch of the government would inevitably defeat the attempt; and without corrupting the people themselves, a succession of new representatives would speedily restore all things to their pristine order. Is there any man who can seriously persuade himself that the proposed Senate can, by any possible means within the compass of human address, arrive at the object of a lawless ambition, through all these obstructions?''

''If reason condemns the suspicion, the same sentence is pronounced by experience. The constitution of Maryland furnishes the most apposite example. The Senate of that State is elected, as the federal Senate will be, indirectly by the people, and for a term less by one year only than the federal Senate. It is distinguished, also, by the remarkable prerogative of filling up its own vacancies within the term of its appointment, and, at the same time, is not under the control of any such rotation as is provided for the federal Senate. There are some other lesser distinctions, which would expose the former to colorable objections, that do not lie against the latter. If the federal Senate, therefore, really contained the danger which has been so loudly proclaimed, some symptoms at least of a like danger ought by this time to have been betrayed by the Senate of Maryland, but no such symptoms have appeared. On the contrary, the jealousies at first entertained by men of the same description with those who view with terror the correspondent part of the federal Constitution, have been gradually extinguished by the progress of the experiment; and the Maryland constitution is daily deriving, from the salutary operation of this part of it, a reputation in which it will probably not be rivalled by that of any State in the Union.''

''But if any thing could silence the jealousies on this subject, it ought to be the British example. The Senate there instead of being elected for a term of six years, and of being unconfined to particular families or fortunes, is an hereditary assembly of opulent nobles. The House of Representatives, instead of being elected for two years, and by the whole body of the people, is elected for seven years, and, in very great proportion, by a very small proportion of the people. Here, unquestionably, ought to be seen in full display the aristocratic usurpations and tyranny which are at some future period to be exemplified in the United States. Unfortunately, however, for the anti-federal argument, the British history informs us that this hereditary assembly has not been able to defend itself against the continual encroachments of the House of Representatives; and that it no sooner lost the support of the monarch, than it was actually crushed by the weight of the popular branch.''

''As far as antiquity can instruct us on this subject, its examples support the reasoning which we have employed. In Sparta, the Ephori, the annual representatives of the people, were found an overmatch for the senate for life, continually gained on its authority and finally drew all power into their own hands. The Tribunes of Rome, who were the representatives of the people, prevailed, it is well known, in almost every contest with the senate for life, and in the end gained the most complete triumph over it. The fact is the more remarkable, as unanimity was required in every act of the Tribunes, even after their number was augmented to ten. It proves the irresistible force possessed by that branch of a free government, which has the people on its side. To these examples might be added that of Carthage, whose senate, according to the testimony of Polybius, instead of drawing all power into its vortex, had, at the commencement of the second Punic War, lost almost the whole of its original portion.''

''Besides the conclusive evidence resulting from this assemblage of facts, that the federal Senate will never be able to transform itself, by gradual usurpations, into an independent and aristocratic body, we are warranted in believing, that if such a revolution should ever happen from causes which the foresight of man cannot guard against, the House of Representatives, with the people on their side, will at all times be able to bring back the Constitution to its primitive form and principles. Against the force of the immediate representatives of the people, nothing will be able to maintain even the constitutional authority of the Senate, but such a display of enlightened policy, and attachment to the public good, as will divide with that branch of the legislature the affections and support of the entire body of the people themselves.''

==Federalist No. 64==
Federalist No. 64 is titled ''&quot;The Powers of the Senate&quot;''. This Federalist Paper was written by John Jay.

===Text===
''To the People of the State of New York:''

''IT IS a just and not a new observation, that enemies to particular persons, and opponents to particular measures, seldom confine their censures to such things only in either as are worthy of blame. Unless on this principle, it is difficult to explain the motives of their conduct, who condemn the proposed Constitution in the aggregate, and treat with severity some of the most unexceptionable articles in it.''

''The second section gives power to the President, &quot;BY AND WITH THE ADVICE AND CONSENT OF THE SENATE, TO MAKE TREATIES, PROVIDED TWO THIRDS OF THE SENATORS PRESENT CONCUR.&quot;''

''The power of making treaties is an important one, especially as it relates to war, peace, and commerce; and it should not be delegated but in such a mode, and with such precautions, as will afford the highest security that it will be exercised by men the best qualified for the purpose, and in the manner most conducive to the public good. The convention appears to have been attentive to both these points: they have directed the President to be chosen by select bodies of electors, to be deputed by the people for that express purpose; and they have committed the appointment of senators to the State legislatures. This mode has, in such cases, vastly the advantage of elections by the people in their collective capacity, where the activity of party zeal, taking the advantage of the supineness, the ignorance, and the hopes and fears of the unwary and interested, often places men in office by the votes of a small proportion of the electors.''

''As the select assemblies for choosing the President, as well as the State legislatures who appoint the senators, will in general be composed of the most enlightened and respectable citizens, there is reason to presume that their attention and their votes will be directed to those men only who have become the most distinguished by their abilities and virtue, and in whom the people perceive just grounds for confidence. The Constitution manifests very particular attention to this object. By excluding men under thirty-five from the first office, and those under thirty from the second, it confines the electors to men of whom the people have had time to form a judgment, and with respect to whom they will not be liable to be deceived by those brilliant appearances of genius and patriotism, which, like transient meteors, sometimes mislead as well as dazzle. If the observation be well founded, that wise kings will always be served by able ministers, it is fair to argue, that as an assembly of select electors possess, in a greater degree than kings, the means of extensive and accurate information relative to men and characters, so will their appointments bear at least equal marks of discretion and discernment. The inference which naturally results from these considerations is this, that the President and senators so chosen will always be of the number of those who best understand our national interests, whether considered in relation to the several States or to foreign nations, who are best able to promote those interests, and whose reputation for integrity inspires and merits confidence. With such men the power of making treaties may be safely lodged.''

''Although the absolute necessity of system, in the conduct of any business, is universally known and acknowledged, yet the high importance of it in national affairs has not yet become sufficiently impressed on the public mind. They who wish to commit the power under consideration to a popular assembly, composed of members constantly coming and going in quick succession, seem not to recollect that such a body must necessarily be inadequate to the attainment of those great objects, which require to be steadily contemplated in all their relations and circumstances, and which can only be approached and achieved by measures which not only talents, but also exact information, and often much time, are necessary to concert and to execute. It was wise, therefore, in the convention to provide, not only that the power of making treaties should be committed to able and honest men, but also that they should continue in place a sufficient time to become perfectly acquainted with our national concerns, and to form and introduce a system for the management of them. The duration prescribed is such as will give them an opportunity of greatly extending their political information, and of rendering their accumulating experience more and more beneficial to their country. Nor has the convention discovered less prudence in providing for the frequent elections of senators in such a way as to obviate the inconvenience of periodically transferring those great affairs entirely to new men; for by leaving a considerable residue of the old ones in place, uniformity and order, as well as a constant succession of official information will be preserved.''

''There are a few who will not admit that the affairs of trade and navigation should be regulated by a system cautiously formed and steadily pursued; and that both our treaties and our laws should correspond with and be made to promote it. It is of much consequence that this correspondence and conformity be carefully maintained; and they who assent to the truth of this position will see and confess that it is well provided for by making concurrence of the Senate necessary both to treaties and to laws.''

''It seldom happens in the negotiation of treaties, of whatever nature, but that perfect SECRECY and immediate DESPATCH are sometimes requisite. These are cases where the most useful intelligence may be obtained, if the persons possessing it can be relieved from apprehensions of discovery. Those apprehensions will operate on those persons whether they are actuated by mercenary or friendly motives; and there doubtless are many of both descriptions, who would rely on the secrecy of the President, but who would not confide in that of the Senate, and still less in that of a large popular Assembly. The convention have done well, therefore, in so disposing of the power of making treaties, that although the President must, in forming them, act by the advice and consent of the Senate, yet he will be able to manage the business of intelligence in such a manner as prudence may suggest.''

''They who have turned their attention to the affairs of men, must have perceived that there are tides in them; tides very irregular in their duration, strength, and direction, and seldom found to run twice exactly in the same manner or measure. To discern and to profit by these tides in national affairs is the business of those who preside over them; and they who have had much experience on this head inform us, that there frequently are occasions when days, nay, even when hours, are precious. The loss of a battle, the death of a prince, the removal of a minister, or other circumstances intervening to change the present posture and aspect of affairs, may turn the most favorable tide into a course opposite to our wishes. As in the field, so in the cabinet, there are moments to be seized as they pass, and they who preside in either should be left in capacity to improve them. So often and so essentially have we heretofore suffered from the want of secrecy and despatch, that the Constitution would have been inexcusably defective, if no attention had been paid to those objects. Those matters which in negotiations usually require the most secrecy and the most despatch, are those preparatory and auxiliary measures which are not otherwise important in a national view, than as they tend to facilitate the attainment of the objects of the negotiation. For these, the President will find no difficulty to provide; and should any circumstance occur which requires the advice and consent of the Senate, he may at any time convene them. Thus we see that the Constitution provides that our negotiations for treaties shall have every advantage which can be derived from talents, information, integrity, and deliberate investigations, on the one hand, and from secrecy and despatch on the other.''

''But to this plan, as to most others that have ever appeared, objections are contrived and urged.''

''Some are displeased with it, not on account of any errors or defects in it, but because, as the treaties, when made, are to have the force of laws, they should be made only by men invested with legislative authority. These gentlemen seem not to consider that the judgments of our courts, and the commissions constitutionally given by our governor, are as valid and as binding on all persons whom they concern, as the laws passed by our legislature. All constitutional acts of power, whether in the executive or in the judicial department, have as much legal validity and obligation as if they proceeded from the legislature; and therefore, whatever name be given to the power of making treaties, or however obligatory they may be when made, certain it is, that the people may, with much propriety, commit the power to a distinct body from the legislature, the executive, or the judicial. It surely does not follow, that because they have given the power of making laws to the legislature, that therefore they should likewise give them the power to do every other act of sovereignty by which the citizens are to be bound and affected.''

''Others, though content that treaties should be made in the mode proposed, are averse to their being the SUPREME laws of the land. They insist, and profess to believe, that treaties like acts of assembly, should be repealable at pleasure. This idea seems to be new and peculiar to this country, but new errors, as well as new truths, often appear. These gentlemen would do well to reflect that a treaty is only another name for a bargain, and that it would be impossible to find a nation who would make any bargain with us, which should be binding on them ABSOLUTELY, but on us only so long and so far as we may think proper to be bound by it. They who make laws may, without doubt, amend or repeal them; and it will not be disputed that they who make treaties may alter or cancel them; but still let us not forget that treaties are made, not by only one of the contracting parties, but by both; and consequently, that as the consent of both was essential to their formation at first, so must it ever afterwards be to alter or cancel them. The proposed Constitution, therefore, has not in the least extended the obligation of treaties. They are just as binding, and just as far beyond the lawful reach of legislative acts now, as they will be at any future period, or under any form of government.''

''However useful jealousy may be in republics, yet when like bile in the natural, it abounds too much in the body politic, the eyes of both become very liable to be deceived by the delusive appearances which that malady casts on surrounding objects. From this cause, probably, proceed the fears and apprehensions of some, that the President and Senate may make treaties without an equal eye to the interests of all the States. Others suspect that two thirds will oppress the remaining third, and ask whether those gentlemen are made sufficiently responsible for their conduct; whether, if they act corruptly, they can be punished; and if they make disadvantageous treaties, how are we to get rid of those treaties?''

''As all the States are equally represented in the Senate, and by men the most able and the most willing to promote the interests of their constituents, they will all have an equal degree of influence in that body, especially while they continue to be careful in appointing proper persons, and to insist on their punctual attendance. In proportion as the United States assume a national form and a national character, so will the good of the whole be more and more an object of attention, and the government must be a weak one indeed, if it should forget that the good of the whole can only be promoted by advancing the good of each of the parts or members which compose the whole. It will not be in the power of the President and Senate to make any treaties by which they and their families and estates will not be equally bound and affected with the rest of the community; and, having no private interests distinct from that of the nation, they will be under no temptations to neglect the latter.''

''As to corruption, the case is not supposable. He must either have been very unfortunate in his intercourse with the world, or possess a heart very susceptible of such impressions, who can think it probable that the President and two thirds of the Senate will ever be capable of such unworthy conduct. The idea is too gross and too invidious to be entertained. But in such a case, if it should ever happen, the treaty so obtained from us would, like all other fraudulent contracts, be null and void by the law of nations.''

''With respect to their responsibility, it is difficult to conceive how it could be increased. Every consideration that can influence the human mind, such as honor, oaths, reputations, conscience, the love of country, and family affections and attachments, afford security for their fidelity. In short, as the Constitution has taken the utmost care that they shall be men of talents and integrity, we have reason to be persuaded that the treaties they make will be as advantageous as, all circumstances considered, could be made; and so far as the fear of punishment and disgrace can operate, that motive to good behavior is amply afforded by the article on the subject of impeachments.''

This Federalist Paper was the last of John Jay's five contributions to the series (he could not contribute more Federalist Papers because he fell sick when the first Federalist Papers were written). It, as its name describes, talks about the powers of the United States Senate and any limitations the Senate may have.

==Federalist No. 65==
Federalist No. 65 is titled ''&quot;The Powers of the Senate Continued&quot;''. This Federalist Paper was written by Alexander Hamilton.

===Text===
''To the People of the State of New York:''

''THE remaining powers which the plan of the convention allots to the Senate, in a distinct capacity, are comprised in their participation with the executive in the appointment to offices, and in their judicial character as a court for the trial of impeachments. As in the business of appointments the executive will be the principal agent, the provisions relating to it will most properly be discussed in the examination of that department. We will, therefore, conclude this head with a view of the judicial character of the Senate.''

''A well-constituted court for the trial of impeachments is an object not more to be desired than difficult to be obtained in a government wholly elective. The subjects of its jurisdiction are those offenses which proceed from the misconduct of public men, or, in other words, from the abuse or violation of some public trust. They are of a nature which may with peculiar propriety be denominated POLITICAL, as they relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself. The prosecution of them, for this reason, will seldom fail to agitate the passions of the whole community, and to divide it into parties more or less friendly or inimical to the accused. In many cases it will connect itself with the pre-existing factions, and will enlist all their animosities, partialities, influence, and interest on one side or on the other; and in such cases there will always be the greatest danger that the decision will be regulated more by the comparative strength of parties, than by the real demonstrations of innocence or guilt.''

''The delicacy and magnitude of a trust which so deeply concerns the political reputation and existence of every man engaged in the administration of public affairs, speak for themselves. The difficulty of placing it rightly, in a government resting entirely on the basis of periodical elections, will as readily be perceived, when it is considered that the most conspicuous characters in it will, from that circumstance, be too often the leaders or the tools of the most cunning or the most numerous faction, and on this account, can hardly be expected to possess the requisite neutrality towards those whose conduct may be the subject of scrutiny.''

''The convention, it appears, thought the Senate the most fit depositary of this important trust. Those who can best discern the intrinsic difficulty of the thing, will be least hasty in condemning that opinion, and will be most inclined to allow due weight to the arguments which may be supposed to have produced it.''

''What, it may be asked, is the true spirit of the institution itself? Is it not designed as a method of NATIONAL INQUEST into the conduct of public men? If this be the design of it, who can so properly be the inquisitors for the nation as the representatives of the nation themselves? It is not disputed that the power of originating the inquiry, or, in other words, of preferring the impeachment, ought to be lodged in the hands of one branch of the legislative body. Will not the reasons which indicate the propriety of this arrangement strongly plead for an admission of the other branch of that body to a share of the inquiry? The model from which the idea of this institution has been borrowed, pointed out that course to the convention. In Great Britain it is the province of the House of Commons to prefer the impeachment, and of the House of Lords to decide upon it. Several of the State constitutions have followed the example. As well the latter, as the former, seem to have regarded the practice of impeachments as a bridle in the hands of the legislative body upon the executive servants of the government. Is not this the true light in which it ought to be regarded?''

''Where else than in the Senate could have been found a tribunal sufficiently dignified, or sufficiently independent? What other body would be likely to feel CONFIDENCE ENOUGH IN ITS OWN SITUATION, to preserve, unawed and uninfluenced, the necessary impartiality between an INDIVIDUAL accused, and the REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PEOPLE, HIS ACCUSERS?''

''Could the Supreme Court have been relied upon as answering this description? It is much to be doubted, whether the members of that tribunal would at all times be endowed with so eminent a portion of fortitude, as would be called for in the execution of so difficult a task; and it is still more to be doubted, whether they would possess the degree of credit and authority, which might, on certain occasions, be indispensable towards reconciling the people to a decision that should happen to clash with an accusation brought by their immediate representatives. A deficiency in the first, would be fatal to the accused; in the last, dangerous to the public tranquillity. The hazard in both these respects, could only be avoided, if at all, by rendering that tribunal more numerous than would consist with a reasonable attention to economy. The necessity of a numerous court for the trial of impeachments, is equally dictated by the nature of the proceeding. This can never be tied down by such strict rules, either in the delineation of the offense by the prosecutors, or in the construction of it by the judges, as in common cases serve to limit the discretion of courts in favor of personal security. There will be no jury to stand between the judges who are to pronounce the sentence of the law, and the party who is to receive or suffer it. The awful discretion which a court of impeachments must necessarily have, to doom to honor or to infamy the most confidential and the most distinguished characters of the community, forbids the commitment of the trust to a small number of persons.''

''These considerations seem alone sufficient to authorize a conclusion, that the Supreme Court would have been an improper substitute for the Senate, as a court of impeachments. There remains a further consideration, which will not a little strengthen this conclusion. It is this: The punishment which may be the consequence of conviction upon impeachment, is not to terminate the chastisement of the offender. After having been sentenced to a perpetual ostracism from the esteem and confidence, and honors and emoluments of his country, he will still be liable to prosecution and punishment in the ordinary course of law. Would it be proper that the persons who had disposed of his fame, and his most valuable rights as a citizen in one trial, should, in another trial, for the same offense, be also the disposers of his life and his fortune? Would there not be the greatest reason to apprehend, that error, in the first sentence, would be the parent of error in the second sentence? That the strong bias of one decision would be apt to overrule the influence of any new lights which might be brought to vary the complexion of another decision? Those who know anything of human nature, will not hesitate to answer these questions in the affirmative; and will be at no loss to perceive, that by making the same persons judges in both cases, those who might happen to be the objects of prosecution would, in a great measure, be deprived of the double security intended them by a double trial. The loss of life and estate would often be virtually included in a sentence which, in its terms, imported nothing more than dismission from a present, and disqualification for a future, office. It may be said, that the intervention of a jury, in the second instance, would obviate the danger. But juries are frequently influenced by the opinions of judges. They are sometimes induced to find special verdicts, which refer the main question to the decision of the court. Who would be willing to stake his life and his estate upon the verdict of a jury acting under the auspices of judges who had predetermined his guilt?''

''Would it have been an improvement of the plan, to have united the Supreme Court with the Senate, in the formation of the court of impeachments? This union would certainly have been attended with several advantages; but would they not have been overbalanced by the signal disadvantage, already stated, arising from the agency of the same judges in the double prosecution to which the offender would be liable? To a certain extent, the benefits of that union will be obtained from making the chief justice of the Supreme Court the president of the court of impeachments, as is proposed to be done in the plan of the convention; while the inconveniences of an entire incorporation of the former into the latter will be substantially avoided. This was perhaps the prudent mean. I forbear to remark upon the additional pretext for clamor against the judiciary, which so considerable an augmentation of its authority would have afforded.''

''Would it have been desirable to have composed the court for the trial of impeachments, of persons wholly distinct from the other departments of the government? There are weighty arguments, as well against, as in favor of, such a plan. To some minds it will not appear a trivial objection, that it could tend to increase the complexity of the political machine, and to add a new spring to the government, the utility of which would at best be questionable. But an objection which will not be thought by any unworthy of attention, is this: a court formed upon such a plan, would either be attended with a heavy expense, or might in practice be subject to a variety of casualties and inconveniences. It must either consist of permanent officers, stationary at the seat of government, and of course entitled to fixed and regular stipends, or of certain officers of the State governments to be called upon whenever an impeachment was actually depending. It will not be easy to imagine any third mode materially different, which could rationally be proposed. As the court, for reasons already given, ought to be numerous, the first scheme will be reprobated by every man who can compare the extent of the public wants with the means of supplying them. The second will be espoused with caution by those who will seriously consider the difficulty of collecting men dispersed over the whole Union; the injury to the innocent, from the procrastinated determination of the charges which might be brought against them; the advantage to the guilty, from the opportunities which delay would afford to intrigue and corruption; and in some cases the detriment to the State, from the prolonged inaction of men whose firm and faithful execution of their duty might have exposed them to the persecution of an intemperate or designing majority in the House of Representatives. Though this latter supposition may seem harsh, and might not be likely often to be verified, yet it ought not to be forgotten that the demon of faction will, at certain seasons, extend his sceptre over all numerous bodies of men.''

''But though one or the other of the substitutes which have been examined, or some other that might be devised, should be thought preferable to the plan in this respect, reported by the convention, it will not follow that the Constitution ought for this reason to be rejected. If mankind were to resolve to agree in no institution of government, until every part of it had been adjusted to the most exact standard of perfection, society would soon become a general scene of anarchy, and the world a desert. Where is the standard of perfection to be found? Who will undertake to unite the discordant opinions of a whole community, in the same judgment of it; and to prevail upon one conceited projector to renounce his INFALLIBLE criterion for the FALLIBLE criterion of his more CONCEITED NEIGHBOR? To answer the purpose of the adversaries of the Constitution, they ought to prove, not merely that particular provisions in it are not the best which might have been imagined, but that the plan upon the whole is bad and pernicious.''

''To the People of the State of New York:''

''A REVIEW of the principal objections that have appeared against the proposed court for the trial of impeachments, will not improbably eradicate the remains of any unfavorable impressions which may still exist in regard to this matter.'''

''The FIRST of these objections is, that the provision in question confounds legislative and judiciary authorities in the same body, in violation of that important and well established maxim which requires a separation between the different departments of power. The true meaning of this maxim has been discussed and ascertained in another place, and has been shown to be entirely compatible with a partial intermixture of those departments for special purposes, preserving them, in the main, distinct and unconnected. This partial intermixture is even, in some cases, not only proper but necessary to the mutual defense of the several members of the government against each other. An absolute or qualified negative in the executive upon the acts of the legislative body, is admitted, by the ablest adepts in political science, to be an indispensable barrier against the encroachments of the latter upon the former. And it may, perhaps, with no less reason be contended, that the powers relating to impeachments are, as before intimated, an essential check in the hands of that body upon the encroachments of the executive. The division of them between the two branches of the legislature, assigning to one the right of accusing, to the other the right of judging, avoids the inconvenience of making the same persons both accusers and judges; and guards against the danger of persecution, from the prevalency of a factious spirit in either of those branches. As the concurrence of two thirds of the Senate will be requisite to a condemnation, the security to innocence, from this additional circumstance, will be as complete as itself can desire.''

''It is curious to observe, with what vehemence this part of the plan is assailed, on the principle here taken notice of, by men who profess to admire, without exception, the constitution of this State; while that constitution makes the Senate, together with the chancellor and judges of the Supreme Court, not only a court of impeachments, but the highest judicatory in the State, in all causes, civil and criminal. The proportion, in point of numbers, of the chancellor and judges to the senators, is so inconsiderable, that the judiciary authority of New York, in the last resort, may, with truth, be said to reside in its Senate. If the plan of the convention be, in this respect, chargeable with a departure from the celebrated maxim which has been so often mentioned, and seems to be so little understood, how much more culpable must be the constitution of New York?''

''A SECOND objection to the Senate, as a court of impeachments, is, that it contributes to an undue accumulation of power in that body, tending to give to the government a countenance too aristocratic. The Senate, it is observed, is to have concurrent authority with the Executive in the formation of treaties and in the appointment to offices: if, say the objectors, to these prerogatives is added that of deciding in all cases of impeachment, it will give a decided predominancy to senatorial influence. To an objection so little precise in itself, it is not easy to find a very precise answer. Where is the measure or criterion to which we can appeal, for determining what will give the Senate too much, too little, or barely the proper degree of influence? Will it not be more safe, as well as more simple, to dismiss such vague and uncertain calculations, to examine each power by itself, and to decide, on general principles, where it may be deposited with most advantage and least inconvenience?''

''If we take this course, it will lead to a more intelligible, if not to a more certain result. The disposition of the power of making treaties, which has obtained in the plan of the convention, will, then, if I mistake not, appear to be fully justified by the considerations stated in a former number, and by others which will occur under the next head of our inquiries. The expediency of the junction of the Senate with the Executive, in the power of appointing to offices, will, I trust, be placed in a light not less satisfactory, in the disquisitions under the same head. And I flatter myself the observations in my last paper must have gone no inconsiderable way towards proving that it was not easy, if practicable, to find a more fit receptacle for the power of determining impeachments, than that which has been chosen. If this be truly the case, the hypothetical dread of the too great weight of the Senate ought to be discarded from our reasonings.''

''But this hypothesis, such as it is, has already been refuted in the remarks applied to the duration in office prescribed for the senators. It was by them shown, as well on the credit of historical examples, as from the reason of the thing, that the most POPULAR branch of every government, partaking of the republican genius, by being generally the favorite of the people, will be as generally a full match, if not an overmatch, for every other member of the Government.''

''But independent of this most active and operative principle, to secure the equilibrium of the national House of Representatives, the plan of the convention has provided in its favor several important counterpoises to the additional authorities to be conferred upon the Senate. The exclusive privilege of originating money bills will belong to the House of Representatives. The same house will possess the sole right of instituting impeachments: is not this a complete counterbalance to that of determining them? The same house will be the umpire in all elections of the President, which do not unite the suffrages of a majority of the whole number of electors; a case which it cannot be doubted will sometimes, if not frequently, happen. The constant possibility of the thing must be a fruitful source of influence to that body. The more it is contemplated, the more important will appear this ultimate though contingent power, of deciding the competitions of the most illustrious citizens of the Union, for the first office in it. It would not perhaps be rash to predict, that as a mean of influence it will be found to outweigh all the peculiar attributes of the Senate.''

''A THIRD objection to the Senate as a court of impeachments, is drawn from the agency they are to have in the appointments to office. It is imagined that they would be too indulgent judges of the conduct of men, in whose official creation they had participated. The principle of this objection would condemn a practice, which is to be seen in all the State governments, if not in all the governments with which we are acquainted: I mean that of rendering those who hold offices during pleasure, dependent on the pleasure of those who appoint them. With equal plausibility might it be alleged in this case, that the favoritism of the latter would always be an asylum for the misbehavior of the former. But that practice, in contradiction to this principle, proceeds upon the presumption, that the responsibility of those who appoint, for the fitness and competency of the persons on whom they bestow their choice, and the interest they will have in the respectable and prosperous administration of affairs, will inspire a sufficient disposition to dismiss from a share in it all such who, by their conduct, shall have proved themselves unworthy of the confidence reposed in them. Though facts may not always correspond with this presumption, yet if it be, in the main, just, it must destroy the supposition that the Senate, who will merely sanction the choice of the Executive, should feel a bias, towards the objects of that choice, strong enough to blind them to the evidences of guilt so extraordinary, as to have induced the representatives of the nation to become its accusers.''

''If any further arguments were necessary to evince the improbability of such a bias, it might be found in the nature of the agency of the Senate in the business of appointments.''

''It will be the office of the President to NOMINATE, and, with the advice and consent of the Senate, to APPOINT. There will, of course, be no exertion of CHOICE on the part of the Senate. They may defeat one choice of the Executive, and oblige him to make another; but they cannot themselves CHOOSE, they can only ratify or reject the choice of the President. They might even entertain a preference to some other person, at the very moment they were assenting to the one proposed, because there might be no positive ground of opposition to him; and they could not be sure, if they withheld their assent, that the subsequent nomination would fall upon their own favorite, or upon any other person in their estimation more meritorious than the one rejected. Thus it could hardly happen, that the majority of the Senate would feel any other complacency towards the object of an appointment than such as the appearances of merit might inspire, and the proofs of the want of it destroy.''

''A FOURTH objection to the Senate in the capacity of a court of impeachments, is derived from its union with the Executive in the power of making treaties. This, it has been said, would constitute the senators their own judges, in every case of a corrupt or perfidious execution of that trust. After having combined with the Executive in betraying the interests of the nation in a ruinous treaty, what prospect, it is asked, would there be of their being made to suffer the punishment they would deserve, when they were themselves to decide upon the accusation brought against them for the treachery of which they have been guilty?''

''This objection has been circulated with more earnestness and with greater show of reason than any other which has appeared against this part of the plan; and yet I am deceived if it does not rest upon an erroneous foundation.''

''The security essentially intended by the Constitution against corruption and treachery in the formation of treaties, is to be sought for in the numbers and characters of those who are to make them. The JOINT AGENCY of the Chief Magistrate of the Union, and of two thirds of the members of a body selected by the collective wisdom of the legislatures of the several States, is designed to be the pledge for the fidelity of the national councils in this particular. The convention might with propriety have meditated the punishment of the Executive, for a deviation from the instructions of the Senate, or a want of integrity in the conduct of the negotiations committed to him; they might also have had in view the punishment of a few leading individuals in the Senate, who should have prostituted their influence in that body as the mercenary instruments of foreign corruption: but they could not, with more or with equal propriety, have contemplated the impeachment and punishment of two thirds of the Senate, consenting to an improper treaty, than of a majority of that or of the other branch of the national legislature, consenting to a pernicious or unconstitutional law, a principle which, I believe, has never been admitted into any government. How, in fact, could a majority in the House of Representatives impeach themselves? Not better, it is evident, than two thirds of the Senate might try themselves. And yet what reason is there, that a majority of the House of Representatives, sacrificing the interests of the society by an unjust and tyrannical act of legislation, should escape with impunity, more than two thirds of the Senate, sacrificing the same interests in an injurious treaty with a foreign power? The truth is, that in all such cases it is essential to the freedom and to the necessary independence of the deliberations of the body, that the members of it should be exempt from punishment for acts done in a collective capacity; and the security to the society must depend on the care which is taken to confide the trust to proper hands, to make it their interest to execute it with fidelity, and to make it as difficult as possible for them to combine in any interest opposite to that of the public good.''

''So far as might concern the misbehavior of the Executive in perverting the instructions or contravening the views of the Senate, we need not be apprehensive of the want of a disposition in that body to punish the abuse of their confidence or to vindicate their own authority. We may thus far count upon their pride, if not upon their virtue. And so far even as might concern the corruption of leading members, by whose arts and influence the majority may have been inveigled into measures odious to the community, if the proofs of that corruption should be satisfactory, the usual propensity of human nature will warrant us in concluding that there would be commonly no defect of inclination in the body to divert the public resentment from themselves by a ready sacrifice of the authors of their mismanagement and disgrace.''

==Federalist No. 67==
Federalist No. 67 is titled ''&quot;The Executive Department&quot;''. This Federalist Paper was written by Alexander Hamilton.

===Text===
''To the People of the State of New York:''

''THE constitution of the executive department of the proposed government, claims next our attention.''

''There is hardly any part of the system which could have been attended with greater difficulty in the arrangement of it than this; and there is, perhaps, none which has been inveighed against with less candor or criticised with less judgment.''

''Here the writers against the Constitution seem to have taken pains to signalize their talent of misrepresentation. Calculating upon the aversion of the people to monarchy, they have endeavored to enlist all their jealousies and apprehensions in opposition to the intended President of the United States; not merely as the embryo, but as the full-grown progeny, of that detested parent. To establish the pretended affinity, they have not scrupled to draw resources even from the regions of fiction. The authorities of a magistrate, in few instances greater, in some instances less, than those of a governor of New York, have been magnified into more than royal prerogatives. He has been decorated with attributes superior in dignity and splendor to those of a king of Great Britain. He has been shown to us with the diadem sparkling on his brow and the imperial purple flowing in his train. He has been seated on a throne surrounded with minions and mistresses, giving audience to the envoys of foreign potentates, in all the supercilious pomp of majesty. The images of Asiatic despotism and voluptuousness have scarcely been wanting to crown the exaggerated scene. We have been taught to tremble at the terrific visages of murdering janizaries, and to blush at the unveiled mysteries of a future seraglio.''

''Attempts so extravagant as these to disfigure or, it might rather be said, to metamorphose the object, render it necessary to take an accurate view of its real nature and form: in order as well to ascertain its true aspect and genuine appearance, as to unmask the disingenuity and expose the fallacy of the counterfeit resemblances which have been so insidiously, as well as industriously, propagated.''

''In the execution of this task, there is no man who would not find it an arduous effort either to behold with moderation, or to treat with seriousness, the devices, not less weak than wicked, which have been contrived to pervert the public opinion in relation to the subject. They so far exceed the usual though unjustifiable licenses of party artifice, that even in a disposition the most candid and tolerant, they must force the sentiments which favor an indulgent construction of the conduct of political adversaries to give place to a voluntary and unreserved indignation. It is impossible not to bestow the imputation of deliberate imposture and deception upon the gross pretense of a similitude between a king of Great Britain and a magistrate of the character marked out for that of the President of the United States. It is still more impossible to withhold that imputation from the rash and barefaced expedients which have been employed to give success to the attempted imposition.''

''In one instance, which I cite as a sample of the general spirit, the temerity has proceeded so far as to ascribe to the President of the United States a power which by the instrument reported is EXPRESSLY allotted to the Executives of the individual States. I mean the power of filling casual vacancies in the Senate.''

''This bold experiment upon the discernment of his countrymen has been hazarded by a writer who (whatever may be his real merit) has had no inconsiderable share in the applauses of his party; and who, upon this false and unfounded suggestion, has built a series of observations equally false and unfounded. Let him now be confronted with the evidence of the fact, and let him, if he be able, justify or extenuate the shameful outrage he has offered to the dictates of truth and to the rules of fair dealing.''

''The second clause of the second section of the second article empowers the President of the United States &quot;to nominate, and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, to appoint ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, judges of the Supreme Court, and all other OFFICERS of United States whose appointments are NOT in the Constitution OTHERWISE PROVIDED FOR, and WHICH SHALL BE ESTABLISHED BY LAW.&quot; Immediately after this clause follows another in these words: &quot;The President shall have power to fill up ?? VACANCIES that may happen DURING THE RECESS OF THE SENATE, by granting commissions which shall EXPIRE AT THE END OF THEIR NEXT SESSION.&quot; It is from this last provision that the pretended power of the President to fill vacancies in the Senate has been deduced. A slight attention to the connection of the clauses, and to the obvious meaning of the terms, will satisfy us that the deduction is not even colorable.''

''The first of these two clauses, it is clear, only provides a mode for appointing such officers, &quot;whose appointments are NOT OTHERWISE PROVIDED FOR in the Constitution, and which SHALL BE ESTABLISHED BY LAW&quot;; of course it cannot extend to the appointments of senators, whose appointments are OTHERWISE PROVIDED FOR in the Constitution, and who are ESTABLISHED BY THE CONSTITUTION, and will not require a future establishment by law. This position will hardly be contested.''

''The last of these two clauses, it is equally clear, cannot be understood to comprehend the power of filling vacancies in the Senate, for the following reasons: First. The relation in which that clause stands to the other, which declares the general mode of appointing officers of the United States, denotes it to be nothing more than a supplement to the other, for the purpose of establishing an auxiliary method of appointment, in cases to which the general method was inadequate. The ordinary power of appointment is confined to the President and Senate JOINTLY, and can therefore only be exercised during the session of the Senate; but as it would have been improper to oblige this body to be continually in session for the appointment of officers and as vacancies might happen IN THEIR RECESS, which it might be necessary for the public service to fill without delay, the succeeding clause is evidently intended to authorize the President, SINGLY, to make temporary appointments &quot;during the recess of the Senate, by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of their next session.&quot; Secondly. If this clause is to be considered as supplementary to the one which precedes, the VACANCIES of which it speaks must be construed to relate to the &quot;officers&quot; described in the preceding one; and this, we have seen, excludes from its description the members of the Senate. Thirdly. The time within which the power is to operate, &quot;during the recess of the Senate,&quot; and the duration of the appointments, &quot;to the end of the next session&quot; of that body, conspire to elucidate the sense of the provision, which, if it had been intended to comprehend senators, would naturally have referred the temporary power of filling vacancies to the recess of the State legislatures, who are to make the permanent appointments, and not to the recess of the national Senate, who are to have no concern in those appointments; and would have extended the duration in office of the temporary senators to the next session of the legislature of the State, in whose representation the vacancies had happened, instead of making it to expire at the end of the ensuing session of the national Senate. The circumstances of the body authorized to make the permanent appointments would, of course, have governed the modification of a power which related to the temporary appointments; and as the national Senate is the body, whose situation is alone contemplated in the clause upon which the suggestion under examination has been founded, the vacancies to which it alludes can only be deemed to respect those officers in whose appointment that body has a concurrent agency with the President. But lastly, the first and second clauses of the third section of the first article, not only obviate all possibility of doubt, but destroy the pretext of misconception. The former provides, that &quot;the Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each State, chosen BY THE LEGISLATURE THEREOF for six years&quot;; and the latter directs, that, &quot;if vacancies in that body should happen by resignation or otherwise, DURING THE RECESS OF THE LEGISLATURE OF ANY STATE, the Executive THEREOF may make temporary appointments until the NEXT MEETING OF THE LEGISLATURE, which shall then fill such vacancies.&quot; Here is an express power given, in clear and unambiguous terms, to the State Executives, to fill casual vacancies in the Senate, by temporary appointments; which not only invalidates the supposition, that the clause before considered could have been intended to confer that power upon the President of the United States, but proves that this supposition, destitute as it is even of the merit of plausibility, must have originated in an intention to deceive the people, too palpable to be obscured by sophistry, too atrocious to be palliated by hypocrisy.''

''I have taken the pains to select this instance of misrepresentation, and to place it in a clear and strong light, as an unequivocal proof of the unwarrantable arts which are practiced to prevent a fair and impartial judgment of the real merits of the Constitution submitted to the consideration of the people. Nor have I scrupled, in so flagrant a case, to allow myself a severity of animadversion little congenial with the general spirit of these papers. I hesitate not to submit it to the decision of any candid and honest adversary of the proposed government, whether language can furnish epithets of too much asperity, for so shameless and so prostitute an attempt to impose on the citizens of America.''

Federalist No. 68 is titled ''&quot;The Mode of Electing the President&quot;''. This Federalist Paper was written by Alexander Hamilton.

===Text===
''To the People of the State of New York:''

''THE mode of appointment of the Chief Magistrate of the United States is almost the only part of the system, of any consequence, which has escaped without severe censure, or which has received the slightest mark of approbation from its opponents. The most plausible of these, who has appeared in print, has even deigned to admit that the election of the President is pretty well guarded. I venture somewhat further, and hesitate not to affirm, that if the manner of it be not perfect, it is at least excellent. It unites in an eminent degree all the advantages, the union of which was to be wished for.''

''It was desirable that the sense of the people should operate in the choice of the person to whom so important a trust was to be confided. This end will be answered by committing the right of making it, not to any preestablished body, but to men chosen by the people for the special purpose, and at the particular conjuncture.''

''It was equally desirable, that the immediate election should be made by men most capable of analyzing the qualities adapted to the station, and acting under circumstances favorable to deliberation, and to a judicious combination of all the reasons and inducements which were proper to govern their choice. A small number of persons, selected by their fellow-citizens from the general mass, will be most likely to possess the information and discernment requisite to such complicated investigations.''

''It was also peculiarly desirable to afford as little opportunity as possible to tumult and disorder. This evil was not least to be dreaded in the election of a magistrate, who was to have so important an agency in the administration of the government as the President of the United States. But the precautions which have been so happily concerted in the system under consideration, promise an effectual security against this mischief. The choice of SEVERAL, to form an intermediate body of electors, will be much less apt to convulse the community with any extraordinary or violent movements, than the choice of ONE who was himself to be the final object of the public wishes. And as the electors, chosen in each State, are to assemble and vote in the State in which they are chosen, this detached and divided situation will expose them much less to heats and ferments, which might be communicated from them to the people, than if they were all to be convened at one time, in one place.''

''Nothing was more to be desired than that every practicable obstacle should be opposed to cabal, intrigue, and corruption. These most deadly adversaries of republican government might naturally have been expected to make their approaches from more than one quarter, but chiefly from the desire in foreign powers to gain an improper ascendant in our councils. How could they better gratify this, than by raising a creature of their own to the chief magistracy of the Union? But the convention have guarded against all danger of this sort, with the most provident and judicious attention. They have not made the appointment of the President to depend on any preexisting bodies of men, who might be tampered with beforehand to prostitute their votes; but they have referred it in the first instance to an immediate act of the people of America, to be exerted in the choice of persons for the temporary and sole purpose of making the appointment. And they have excluded from eligibility to this trust, all those who from situation might be suspected of too great devotion to the President in office. No senator, representative, or other person holding a place of trust or profit under the United States, can be of the numbers of the electors. Thus without corrupting the body of the people, the immediate agents in the election will at least enter upon the task free from any sinister bias. Their transient existence, and their detached situation, already taken notice of, afford a satisfactory prospect of their continuing so, to the conclusion of it. The business of corruption, when it is to embrace so considerable a number of men, requires time as well as means. Nor would it be found easy suddenly to embark them, dispersed as they would be over thirteen States, in any combinations founded upon motives, which though they could not properly be denominated corrupt, might yet be of a nature to mislead them from their duty.''

''Another and no less important desideratum was, that the Executive should be independent for his continuance in office on all but the people themselves. He might otherwise be tempted to sacrifice his duty to his complaisance for those whose favor was necessary to the duration of his official consequence. This advantage will also be secured, by making his re-election to depend on a special body of representatives, deputed by the society for the single purpose of making the important choice.''

''All these advantages will happily combine in the plan devised by the convention; which is, that the people of each State shall choose a number of persons as electors, equal to the number of senators and representatives of such State in the national government, who shall assemble within the State, and vote for some fit person as President. Their votes, thus given, are to be transmitted to the seat of the national government, and the person who may happen to have a majority of the whole number of votes will be the President. But as a majority of the votes might not always happen to centre in one man, and as it might be unsafe to permit less than a majority to be conclusive, it is provided that, in such a contingency, the House of Representatives shall select out of the candidates who shall have the five highest number of votes, the man who in their opinion may be best qualified for the office.''

''The process of election affords a moral certainty, that the office of President will never fall to the lot of any man who is not in an eminent degree endowed with the requisite qualifications. Talents for low intrigue, and the little arts of popularity, may alone suffice to elevate a man to the first honors in a single State; but it will require other talents, and a different kind of merit, to establish him in the esteem and confidence of the whole Union, or of so considerable a portion of it as would be necessary to make him a successful candidate for the distinguished office of President of the United States. It will not be too strong to say, that there will be a constant probability of seeing the station filled by characters pre-eminent for ability and virtue. And this will be thought no inconsiderable recommendation of the Constitution, by those who are able to estimate the share which the executive in every government must necessarily have in its good or ill administration. Though we cannot acquiesce in the political heresy of the poet who says: &quot;For forms of government let fools contest That which is best administered is best,&quot; yet we may safely pronounce, that the true test of a good government is its aptitude and tendency to produce a good administration.''

''The Vice-President is to be chosen in the same manner with the President; with this difference, that the Senate is to do, in respect to the former, what is to be done by the House of Representatives, in respect to the latter.''

''The appointment of an extraordinary person, as Vice-President, has been objected to as superfluous, if not mischievous. It has been alleged, that it would have been preferable to have authorized the Senate to elect out of their own body an officer answering that description. But two considerations seem to justify the ideas of the convention in this respect. One is, that to secure at all times the possibility of a definite resolution of the body, it is necessary that the President should have only a casting vote. And to take the senator of any State from his seat as senator, to place him in that of President of the Senate, would be to exchange, in regard to the State from which he came, a constant for a contingent vote. The other consideration is, that as the Vice-President may occasionally become a substitute for the President, in the supreme executive magistracy, all the reasons which recommend the mode of election prescribed for the one, apply with great if not with equal force to the manner of appointing the other. It is remarkable that in this, as in most other instances, the objection which is made would lie against the constitution of this State. We have a Lieutenant-Governor, chosen by the people at large, who presides in the Senate, and is the constitutional substitute for the Governor, in casualties similar to those which would authorize the Vice-President to exercise the authorities and discharge the duties of the President.''

This Federalist Paper describes Hamilton's view of the process for selecting the president, which was via election. By writing this document, Hamilton sought to influence the [[w:Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention]] that was drafting what would become the [[../../Constitution/]].

==Federalist No. 69==
Federalist No. 69 is titled ''&quot;The Real Character of the Executive&quot;''. This Federalist Paper was written by Alexander Hamilton.

===Text===
''To the People of the State of New York:''

''I PROCEED now to trace the real characters of the proposed Executive, as they are marked out in the plan of the convention. This will serve to place in a strong light the unfairness of the representations which have been made in regard to it.''

''The first thing which strikes our attention is, that the executive authority, with few exceptions, is to be vested in a single magistrate. This will scarcely, however, be considered as a point upon which any comparison can be grounded; for if, in this particular, there be a resemblance to the king of Great Britain, there is not less a resemblance to the Grand Seignior, to the khan of Tartary, to the Man of the Seven Mountains, or to the governor of New York.''

''That magistrate is to be elected for FOUR years; and is to be re-eligible as often as the people of the United States shall think him worthy of their confidence. In these circumstances there is a total dissimilitude between HIM and a king of Great Britain, who is an HEREDITARY monarch, possessing the crown as a patrimony descendible to his heirs forever; but there is a close analogy between HIM and a governor of New York, who is elected for THREE years, and is re-eligible without limitation or intermission. If we consider how much less time would be requisite for establishing a dangerous influence in a single State, than for establishing a like influence throughout the United States, we must conclude that a duration of FOUR years for the Chief Magistrate of the Union is a degree of permanency far less to be dreaded in that office, than a duration of THREE years for a corresponding office in a single State.''

''The President of the United States would be liable to be impeached, tried, and, upon conviction of treason, bribery, or other high crimes or misdemeanors, removed from office; and would afterwards be liable to prosecution and punishment in the ordinary course of law. The person of the king of Great Britain is sacred and inviolable; there is no constitutional tribunal to which he is amenable; no punishment to which he can be subjected without involving the crisis of a national revolution. In this delicate and important circumstance of personal responsibility, the President of Confederated America would stand upon no better ground than a governor of New York, and upon worse ground than the governors of Maryland and Delaware.''

''The President of the United States is to have power to return a bill, which shall have passed the two branches of the legislature, for reconsideration; and the bill so returned is to become a law, if, upon that reconsideration, it be approved by two thirds of both houses. The king of Great Britain, on his part, has an absolute negative upon the acts of the two houses of Parliament. The disuse of that power for a considerable time past does not affect the reality of its existence; and is to be ascribed wholly to the crown's having found the means of substituting influence to authority, or the art of gaining a majority in one or the other of the two houses, to the necessity of exerting a prerogative which could seldom be exerted without hazarding some degree of national agitation. The qualified negative of the President differs widely from this absolute negative of the British sovereign; and tallies exactly with the revisionary authority of the council of revision of this State, of which the governor is a constituent part. In this respect the power of the President would exceed that of the governor of New York, because the former would possess, singly, what the latter shares with the chancellor and judges; but it would be precisely the same with that of the governor of Massachusetts, whose constitution, as to this article, seems to have been the original from which the convention have copied.''

''The President is to be the ``commander-in-chief of the army and navy of the United States, and of the militia of the several States, when called into the actual service of the United States. He is to have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, EXCEPT IN CASES OF IMPEACHMENT; to recommend to the consideration of Congress such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient; to convene, on extraordinary occasions, both houses of the legislature, or either of them, and, in case of disagreement between them WITH RESPECT TO THE TIME OF ADJOURNMENT, to adjourn them to such time as he shall think proper; to take care that the laws be faithfully executed; and to commission all officers of the United States.&quot; In most of these particulars, the power of the President will resemble equally that of the king of Great Britain and of the governor of New York. The most material points of difference are these: First. The President will have only the occasional command of such part of the militia of the nation as by legislative provision may be called into the actual service of the Union. The king of Great Britain and the governor of New York have at all times the entire command of all the militia within their several jurisdictions. In this article, therefore, the power of the President would be inferior to that of either the monarch or the governor. Secondly. The President is to be commander-in-chief of the army and navy of the United States. In this respect his authority would be nominally the same with that of the king of Great Britain, but in substance much inferior to it. It would amount to nothing more than the supreme command and direction of the military and naval forces, as first General and admiral of the Confederacy; while that of the British king extends to the DECLARING of war and to the RAISING and REGULATING of fleets and armies, all which, by the Constitution under consideration, would appertain to the legislature. The governor of New York, on the other hand, is by the constitution of the State vested only with the command of its militia and navy. But the constitutions of several of the States expressly declare their governors to be commanders-in-chief, as well of the army as navy; and it may well be a question, whether those of New Hampshire and Massachusetts, in particular, do not, in this instance, confer larger powers upon their respective governors, than could be claimed by a President of the United States. Thirdly. The power of the President, in respect to pardons, would extend to all cases, EXCEPT THOSE OF IMPEACHMENT. The governor of New York may pardon in all cases, even in those of impeachment, except for treason and murder. Is not the power of the governor, in this article, on a calculation of political consequences, greater than that of the President? All conspiracies and plots against the government, which have not been matured into actual treason, may be screened from punishment of every kind, by the interposition of the prerogative of pardoning. If a governor of New York, therefore, should be at the head of any such conspiracy, until the design had been ripened into actual hostility he could insure his accomplices and adherents an entire impunity. A President of the Union, on the other hand, though he may even pardon treason, when prosecuted in the ordinary course of law, could shelter no offender, in any degree, from the effects of impeachment and conviction. Would not the prospect of a total indemnity for all the preliminary steps be a greater temptation to undertake and persevere in an enterprise against the public liberty, than the mere prospect of an exemption from death and confiscation, if the final execution of the design, upon an actual appeal to arms, should miscarry? Would this last expectation have any influence at all, when the probability was computed, that the person who was to afford that exemption might himself be involved in the consequences of the measure, and might be incapacitated by his agency in it from affording the desired impunity? The better to judge of this matter, it will be necessary to recollect, that, by the proposed Constitution, the offense of treason is limited ``to levying war upon the United States, and adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort&quot;; and that by the laws of New York it is confined within similar bounds. Fourthly. The President can only adjourn the national legislature in the single case of disagreement about the time of adjournment. The British monarch may prorogue or even dissolve the Parliament. The governor of New York may also prorogue the legislature of this State for a limited time; a power which, in certain situations, may be employed to very important purposes.''

''The President is to have power, with the advice and consent of the Senate, to make treaties, provided two thirds of the senators present concur. The king of Great Britain is the sole and absolute representative of the nation in all foreign transactions. He can of his own accord make treaties of peace, commerce, alliance, and of every other description. It has been insinuated, that his authority in this respect is not conclusive, and that his conventions with foreign powers are subject to the revision, and stand in need of the ratification, of Parliament. But I believe this doctrine was never heard of, until it was broached upon the present occasion. Every jurist of that kingdom, and every other man acquainted with its Constitution, knows, as an established fact, that the prerogative of making treaties exists in the crown in its utmost plentitude; and that the compacts entered into by the royal authority have the most complete legal validity and perfection, independent of any other sanction. The Parliament, it is true, is sometimes seen employing itself in altering the existing laws to conform them to the stipulations in a new treaty; and this may have possibly given birth to the imagination, that its co-operation was necessary to the obligatory efficacy of the treaty. But this parliamentary interposition proceeds from a different cause: from the necessity of adjusting a most artificial and intricate system of revenue and commercial laws, to the changes made in them by the operation of the treaty; and of adapting new provisions and precautions to the new state of things, to keep the machine from running into disorder. In this respect, therefore, there is no comparison between the intended power of the President and the actual power of the British sovereign. The one can perform alone what the other can do only with the concurrence of a branch of the legislature. It must be admitted, that, in this instance, the power of the federal Executive would exceed that of any State Executive. But this arises naturally from the sovereign power which relates to treaties. If the Confederacy were to be dissolved, it would become a question, whether the Executives of the several States were not solely invested with that delicate and important prerogative.''

''The President is also to be authorized to receive ambassadors and other public ministers. This, though it has been a rich theme of declamation, is more a matter of dignity than of authority. It is a circumstance which will be without consequence in the administration of the government; and it was far more convenient that it should be arranged in this manner, than that there should be a necessity of convening the legislature, or one of its branches, upon every arrival of a foreign minister, though it were merely to take the place of a departed predecessor.''

''The President is to nominate, and, WITH THE ADVICE AND CONSENT OF THE SENATE, to appoint ambassadors and other public ministers, judges of the Supreme Court, and in general all officers of the United States established by law, and whose appointments are not otherwise provided for by the Constitution. The king of Great Britain is emphatically and truly styled the fountain of honor. He not only appoints to all offices, but can create offices. He can confer titles of nobility at pleasure; and has the disposal of an immense number of church preferments. There is evidently a great inferiority in the power of the President, in this particular, to that of the British king; nor is it equal to that of the governor of New York, if we are to interpret the meaning of the constitution of the State by the practice which has obtained under it. The power of appointment is with us lodged in a council, composed of the governor and four members of the Senate, chosen by the Assembly. The governor CLAIMS, and has frequently EXERCISED, the right of nomination, and is ENTITLED to a casting vote in the appointment. If he really has the right of nominating, his authority is in this respect equal to that of the President, and exceeds it in the article of the casting vote. In the national government, if the Senate should be divided, no appointment could be made; in the government of New York, if the council should be divided, the governor can turn the scale, and confirm his own nomination. If we compare the publicity which must necessarily attend the mode of appointment by the President and an entire branch of the national legislature, with the privacy in the mode of appointment by the governor of New York, closeted in a secret apartment with at most four, and frequently with only two persons; and if we at the same time consider how much more easy it must be to influence the small number of which a council of appointment consists, than the considerable number of which the national Senate would consist, we cannot hesitate to pronounce that the power of the chief magistrate of this State, in the disposition of offices, must, in practice, be greatly superior to that of the Chief Magistrate of the Union.''

''Hence it appears that, except as to the concurrent authority of the President in the article of treaties, it would be difficult to determine whether that magistrate would, in the aggregate, possess more or less power than the Governor of New York. And it appears yet more unequivocally, that there is no pretense for the parallel which has been attempted between him and the king of Great Britain. But to render the contrast in this respect still more striking, it may be of use to throw the principal circumstances of dissimilitude into a closer group.''

''The President of the United States would be an officer elected by the people for FOUR years; the king of Great Britain is a perpetual and HEREDITARY prince. The one would be amenable to personal punishment and disgrace; the person of the other is sacred and inviolable. The one would have a QUALIFIED negative upon the acts of the legislative body; the other has an ABSOLUTE negative. The one would have a right to command the military and naval forces of the nation; the other, in addition to this right, possesses that of DECLARING war, and of RAISING and REGULATING fleets and armies by his own authority. The one would have a concurrent power with a branch of the legislature in the formation of treaties; the other is the SOLE POSSESSOR of the power of making treaties. The one would have a like concurrent authority in appointing to offices; the other is the sole author of all appointments. The one can confer no privileges whatever; the other can make denizens of aliens, noblemen of commoners; can erect corporations with all the rights incident to corporate bodies. The one can prescribe no rules concerning the commerce or currency of the nation; the other is in several respects the arbiter of commerce, and in this capacity can establish markets and fairs, can regulate weights and measures, can lay embargoes for a limited time, can coin money, can authorize or prohibit the circulation of foreign coin. The one has no particle of spiritual jurisdiction; the other is the supreme head and governor of the national church! What answer shall we give to those who would persuade us that things so unlike resemble each other? The same that ought to be given to those who tell us that a government, the whole power of which would be in the hands of the elective and periodical servants of the people, is an aristocracy, a monarchy, and a despotism.''

===Analysis===
This Federalist Paper discusses Hamilton's views on the President's military as well as political role. It also set the length of a term of office for a President: 4 years and also gives no limit on how many times he may be reelected. This would later be changed with the ratification of [[../../Additional amendments to the United States Constitution#Amendment XXII|Amendment XXII]] of the Constitution. Federalist No. 69 is the third in a series of eleven essays discussing the powers and limitations of the Executive branch.

==Federalist No. 70==
Federalist No. 70 is titled ''&quot;The Executive Department Further Considered&quot;''. This Federalist Paper was written by Alexander Hamilton.

===Text===
''To the People of the State of New York:'' 

''THERE is an idea, which is not without its advocates, that a vigorous Executive is inconsistent with the genius of republican government. The enlightened well-wishers to this species of government must at least hope that the supposition is destitute of foundation; since they can never admit its truth, without at the same time admitting the condemnation of their own principles. Energy in the Executive is a leading character in the definition of good government. It is essential to the protection of the community against foreign attacks; it is not less essential to the steady administration of the laws; to the protection of property against those irregular and high-handed combinations which sometimes interrupt the ordinary course of justice; to the security of liberty against the enterprises and assaults of ambition, of faction, and of anarchy. Every man the least conversant in Roman story, knows how often that republic was obliged to take refuge in the absolute power of a single man, under the formidable title of Dictator, as well against the intrigues of ambitious individuals who aspired to the tyranny, and the seditions of whole classes of the community whose conduct threatened the existence of all government, as against the invasions of external enemies who menaced the conquest and destruction of Rome.'' 

''There can be no need, however, to multiply arguments or examples on this head. A feeble Executive implies a feeble execution of the government. A feeble execution is but another phrase for a bad execution; and a government ill executed, whatever it may be in theory, must be, in practice, a bad government.'' 

''Taking it for granted, therefore, that all men of sense will agree in the necessity of an energetic Executive, it will only remain to inquire, what are the ingredients which constitute this energy? How far can they be combined with those other ingredients which constitute safety in the republican sense? And how far does this combination characterize the plan which has been reported by the convention?'' 

''The ingredients which constitute energy in the Executive are, first, unity; secondly, duration; thirdly, an adequate provision for its support; fourthly, competent powers.'' 

''The ingredients which constitute safety in the republican sense are, first, a due dependence on the people, secondly, a due responsibility.'' 

''Those politicians and statesmen who have been the most celebrated for the soundness of their principles and for the justice of their views, have declared in favor of a single Executive and a numerous legislature. They have with great propriety, considered energy as the most necessary qualification of the former, and have regarded this as most applicable to power in a single hand, while they have, with equal propriety, considered the latter as best adapted to deliberation and wisdom, and best calculated to conciliate the confidence of the people and to secure their privileges and interests.'' 

''That unity is conducive to energy will not be disputed. Decision, activity, secrecy, and despatch will generally characterize the proceedings of one man in a much more eminent degree than the proceedings of any greater number; and in proportion as the number is increased, these qualities will be diminished.''

''This unity may be destroyed in two ways: either by vesting the power in two or more magistrates of equal dignity and authority; or by vesting it ostensibly in one man, subject, in whole or in part, to the control and co-operation of others, in the capacity of counsellors to him. Of the first, the two Consuls of Rome may serve as an example; of the last, we shall find examples in the constitutions of several of the States. New York and New Jersey, if I recollect right, are the only States which have intrusted the executive authority wholly to single men. Both these methods of destroying the unity of the Executive have their partisans; but the votaries of an executive council are the most numerous. They are both liable, if not to equal, to similar objections, and may in most lights be examined in conjunction.'' 

''The experience of other nations will afford little instruction on this head. As far, however, as it teaches any thing, it teaches us not to be enamoured of plurality in the Executive. We have seen that the Achaeans, on an experiment of two Praetors, were induced to abolish one. The Roman history records many instances of mischiefs to the republic from the dissensions between the Consuls, and between the military Tribunes, who were at times substituted for the Consuls. But it gives us no specimens of any peculiar advantages derived to the state from the circumstance of the plurality of those magistrates. That the dissensions between them were not more frequent or more fatal, is a matter of astonishment, until we advert to the singular position in which the republic was almost continually placed, and to the prudent policy pointed out by the circumstances of the state, and pursued by the Consuls, of making a division of the government between them. The patricians engaged in a perpetual struggle with the plebeians for the preservation of their ancient authorities and dignities; the Consuls, who were generally chosen out of the former body, were commonly united by the personal interest they had in the defense of the privileges of their order. In addition to this motive of union, after the arms of the republic had considerably expanded the bounds of its empire, it became an established custom with the Consuls to divide the administration between themselves by lot one of them remaining at Rome to govern the city and its environs, the other taking the command in the more distant provinces. This expedient must, no doubt, have had great influence in preventing those collisions and rivalships which might otherwise have embroiled the peace of the republic.'' 

''But quitting the dim light of historical research, attaching ourselves purely to the dictates of reason and good sense, we shall discover much greater cause to reject than to approve the idea of plurality in the Executive, under any modification whatever.''

''Wherever two or more persons are engaged in any common enterprise or pursuit, there is always danger of difference of opinion. If it be a public trust or office, in which they are clothed with equal dignity and authority, there is peculiar danger of personal emulation and even animosity. From either, and especially from all these causes, the most bitter dissensions are apt to spring. Whenever these happen, they lessen the respectability, weaken the authority, and distract the plans and operation of those whom they divide. If they should unfortunately assail the supreme executive magistracy of a country, consisting of a plurality of persons, they might impede or frustrate the most important measures of the government, in the most critical emergencies of the state. And what is still worse, they might split the community into the most violent and irreconcilable factions, adhering differently to the different individuals who composed the magistracy.'' 

''Men often oppose a thing, merely because they have had no agency in planning it, or because it may have been planned by those whom they dislike. But if they have been consulted, and have happened to disapprove, opposition then becomes, in their estimation, an indispensable duty of self-love. They seem to think themselves bound in honor, and by all the motives of personal infallibility, to defeat the success of what has been resolved upon contrary to their sentiments. Men of upright, benevolent tempers have too many opportunities of remarking, with horror, to what desperate lengths this disposition is sometimes carried, and how often the great interests of society are sacrificed to the vanity, to the conceit, and to the obstinacy of individuals, who have credit enough to make their passions and their caprices interesting to mankind. Perhaps the question now before the public may, in its consequences, afford melancholy proofs of the effects of this despicable frailty, or rather detestable vice, in the human character.'' 

''Upon the principles of a free government, inconveniences from the source just mentioned must necessarily be submitted to in the formation of the legislature; but it is unnecessary, and therefore unwise, to introduce them into the constitution of the Executive. It is here too that they may be most pernicious. In the legislature, promptitude of decision is oftener an evil than a benefit. The differences of opinion, and the jarrings of parties in that department of the government, though they may sometimes obstruct salutary plans, yet often promote deliberation and circumspection, and serve to check excesses in the majority. When a resolution too is once taken, the opposition must be at an end. That resolution is a law, and resistance to it punishable. But no favorable circumstances palliate or atone for the disadvantages of dissension in the executive department. Here, they are pure and unmixed. There is no point at which they cease to operate. They serve to embarrass and weaken the execution of the plan or measure to which they relate, from the first step to the final conclusion of it. They constantly counteract those qualities in the Executive which are the most necessary ingredients in its composition, vigor and expedition, and this without any counterbalancing good. In the conduct of war, in which the energy of the Executive is the bulwark of the national security, every thing would be to be apprehended from its plurality.''

''It must be confessed that these observations apply with principal weight to the first case supposed that is, to a plurality of magistrates of equal dignity and authority a scheme, the advocates for which are not likely to form a numerous sect; but they apply, though not with equal, yet with considerable weight to the project of a council, whose concurrence is made constitutionally necessary to the operations of the ostensible Executive. An artful cabal in that council would be able to distract and to enervate the whole system of administration. If no such cabal should exist, the mere diversity of views and opinions would alone be sufficient to tincture the exercise of the executive authority with a spirit of habitual feebleness and dilatoriness.'' 

But one of the weightiest objections to a plurality in the Executive, and which lies as much against the last as the first plan, is, that it tends to conceal faults and destroy responsibility.'' 

''Responsibility is of two kinds to censure and to punishment. The first is the more important of the two, especially in an elective office. Man, in public trust, will much oftener act in such a manner as to render him unworthy of being any longer trusted, than in such a manner as to make him obnoxious to legal punishment. But the multiplication of the Executive adds to the difficulty of detection in either case. It often becomes impossible, amidst mutual accusations, to determine on whom the blame or the punishment of a pernicious measure, or series of pernicious measures, ought really to fall. It is shifted from one to another with so much dexterity, and under such plausible appearances, that the public opinion is left in suspense about the real author. The circumstances which may have led to any national miscarriage or misfortune are sometimes so complicated that, where there are a number of actors who may have had different degrees and kinds of agency, though we may clearly see upon the whole that there has been mismanagement, yet it may be impracticable to pronounce to whose account the evil which may have been incurred is truly chargeable.'' 

''``I was overruled by my council. The council were so divided in their opinions that it was impossible to obtain any better resolution on the point.'' These and similar pretexts are constantly at hand, whether true or false. And who is there that will either take the trouble or incur the odium, of a strict scrutiny into the secret springs of the transaction? Should there be found a citizen zealous enough to undertake the unpromising task, if there happen to be collusion between the parties concerned, how easy it is to clothe the circumstances with so much ambiguity, as to render it uncertain what was the precise conduct of any of those parties?''

''In the single instance in which the governor of this State is coupled with a council that is, in the appointment to offices, we have seen the mischiefs of it in the view now under consideration. Scandalous appointments to important offices have been made. Some cases, indeed, have been so flagrant that ALL PARTIES have agreed in the impropriety of the thing. When inquiry has been made, the blame has been laid by the governor on the members of the council, who, on their part, have charged it upon his nomination; while the people remain altogether at a loss to determine, by whose influence their interests have been committed to hands so unqualified and so manifestly improper. In tenderness to individuals, I forbear to descend to particulars.''

''It is evident from these considerations, that the plurality of the Executive tends to deprive the people of the two greatest securities they can have for the faithful exercise of any delegated power, first, the restraints of public opinion, which lose their efficacy, as well on account of the division of the censure attendant on bad measures among a number, as on account of the uncertainty on whom it ought to fall; and, secondly, the opportunity of discovering with facility and clearness the misconduct of the persons they trust, in order either to their removal from office or to their actual punishment in cases which admit of it.'' 

''In England, the king is a perpetual magistrate; and it is a maxim which has obtained for the sake of the public peace, that he is unaccountable for his administration, and his person sacred. Nothing, therefore, can be wiser in that kingdom, than to annex to the king a constitutional council, who may be responsible to the nation for the advice they give. Without this, there would be no responsibility whatever in the executive department an idea inadmissible in a free government. But even there the king is not bound by the resolutions of his council, though they are answerable for the advice they give. He is the absolute master of his own conduct in the exercise of his office, and may observe or disregard the counsel given to him at his sole discretion.''

''But in a republic, where every magistrate ought to be personally responsible for his behavior in office the reason which in the British Constitution dictates the propriety of a council, not only ceases to apply, but turns against the institution. In the monarchy of Great Britain, it furnishes a substitute for the prohibited responsibility of the chief magistrate, which serves in some degree as a hostage to the national justice for his good behavior. In the American republic, it would serve to destroy, or would greatly diminish, the intended and necessary responsibility of the Chief Magistrate himself.'' 

''The idea of a council to the Executive, which has so generally obtained in the State constitutions, has been derived from that maxim of republican jealousy which considers power as safer in the hands of a number of men than of a single man. If the maxim should be admitted to be applicable to the case, I should contend that the advantage on that side would not counterbalance the numerous disadvantages on the opposite side. But I do not think the rule at all applicable to the executive power. I clearly concur in opinion, in this particular, with a writer whom the celebrated Junius pronounces to be ``deep, solid, and ingenious,'' that ``the executive power is more easily confined when it is ONE''; that it is far more safe there should be a single object for the jealousy and watchfulness of the people; and, in a word, that all multiplication of the Executive is rather dangerous than friendly to liberty.''

''A little consideration will satisfy us, that the species of security sought for in the multiplication of the Executive, is unattainable. Numbers must be so great as to render combination difficult, or they are rather a source of danger than of security. The united credit and influence of several individuals must be more formidable to liberty, than the credit and influence of either of them separately. When power, therefore, is placed in the hands of so small a number of men, as to admit of their interests and views being easily combined in a common enterprise, by an artful leader, it becomes more liable to abuse, and more dangerous when abused, than if it be lodged in the hands of one man; who, from the very circumstance of his being alone, will be more narrowly watched and more readily suspected, and who cannot unite so great a mass of influence as when he is associated with others. The Decemvirs of Rome, whose name denotes their number, were more to be dreaded in their usurpation than any ONE of them would have been. No person would think of proposing an Executive much more numerous than that body; from six to a dozen have been suggested for the number of the council. The extreme of these numbers, is not too great for an easy combination; and from such a combination America would have more to fear, than from the ambition of any single individual. A council to a magistrate, who is himself responsible for what he does, are generally nothing better than a clog upon his good intentions, are often the instruments and accomplices of his bad and are almost always a cloak to his faults.'' 

''I forbear to dwell upon the subject of expense; though it be evident that if the council should be numerous enough to answer the principal end aimed at by the institution, the salaries of the members, who must be drawn from their homes to reside at the seat of government, would form an item in the catalogue of public expenditures too serious to be incurred for an object of equivocal utility. I will only add that, prior to the appearance of the Constitution, I rarely met with an intelligent man from any of the States, who did not admit, as the result of experience, that the UNITY of the executive of this State was one of the best of the distinguishing features of our constitution.'' 

''PUBLIUS.'' 

===Analysis===
This Federalist Paper is the fourth in a series of eleven essays discussing the powers and limitations of the Executive branch.

The essay deals with the question of a plural executive. Hamilton argues that a plural executive, having more than one president, &quot;tends to conceal faults, and destroy responsibility&quot;, and states that a singular president would better be suited to wield the full potential of his power in a quick and efficient way, without falling into endless squabbling and dispute with other executives with the same power. He also warns that when dealing with more than one leader, &quot;there is always difference of opinion&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Discrimination, Subtask: How to describe a set of structures independent from a logic?
Easy for finitely describable structures: by a finite set of structures.

Difficult: Infinite set of structures.  Approach: the notion of pattern, i.e. Partial Isomorphisms that can be enhanced by induction.

&lt;math&gt;\exists_x \exists_y x R y&lt;/math&gt;, can be described by single structure, like: 

&lt;math&gt;\exists_x \exists_y \neg x R y&lt;/math&gt;, can be described by a set of structures of size 2, like: 

&lt;math&gt;\neg \exists_x \exists_y x R y&lt;/math&gt;, requires infinitely many structures, since ... 

In the latter case it is important how the pattern is extended, thus we need a rule for it. This can be achieved by induction, i.e. a structure for which the pattern holds is extended by a single element s.t. the pattern applies for x and y (i.e. all unified variables) with this element.

So, finally we get a structure where the pattern is applied to each single combination of elements (for the unifier case) - i.e. ''for all'' elements - and this is where ''FO'' comes in here.

In the basics section we defined the notion of finite (partial?) isomorphism.  Now one can ask for a reasonable definition of two structures being finitely isomorphic. We discuss miscellaneous approaches here and will see that - on finite relational structures - one is equivalent to the concept of elementary equivalence.

==Loosely Finite Isomorphic Structures==
====All or Any====

i.e. there is any subset of A with a FI to B, what is trivial in most cases, since one can pick a single element from each A and B. But on the other hand requiring that for all subsets of A there is a FI would demand a total FI from A to B i.e. would include the notion of Isomorphism(?):
 

====Total====
So one can make the definition relative to the domain-size m of FI, that is:

(shallow)

(deep)

I will reply where the message was left and would appreciate it if you did the same to avoid fragmentation of discussions. I will periodically archive this page of all sections which are unlikely to be continued. If you would like to continue an archived discussion simply remove it from the archive page and paste it here.he

== Tagging images nld ==

G'day Lcarsdata, I see you are running a bot across the images to tag the unlicensed ones. That's great, but many of the early ones you hit were tagged without subst'ing the template, e.g. [[:Image:Cherokee Syllabary.png]]. Could you please go back and fix those? ta, [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:42, 17 June 2007 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">My experience is that linguists are rarely up to date with contemporary programming and computer usage. For example, the best ones (which I know, of course) today knows how to program in [[w:Perl|Perl]]. However, contemporary programming is moved from Perl via Python to Ruby. Also, even linguistics is one of the best fields for database usage, I don't know ''any'' linguist who knows to make even the most simple SQL query. Also, it is very frustrating to me whenever I realize that some linguist doesn't know how to make boolean query on Google.

In this moment I am not sure what I am starting to make: a manual, a book, an university course. Probably, all of them, but, until the final decision I'll leave this inside of my user space. Of course, everyone is welcome to join me. And, of course, this is just a temporary introduction :) Don't worry, I know what NPOV is ;) Also, feel free to fix my spelling and syntax; I am not native English speaker. :)

==What linguist should know==

This list is not complete. I am sure that I missed something...

Sections are listed below.

Types of knowledge are:
*Basic -- basic knowledge.
**Of course, as I see it. You may see my POV here: I prefer Debian instead of other distributions, I prefer Gnome instead of KDE and so on. However, You may add, for example, &quot;Gnome or KDE&quot; and put there a section about KDE.
*Independent (user) -- this is a set of knowledge which makes user independent. In general, after those lectures people are ready to use computers and learn independently.
*Advanced -- advanced knowledge.
*Extra -- not necessary knowledge (if other is learned).

===General===
*Basic: [[User:Millosh/Internet and Programming for Linguists/Introduction to algebra|Introduction to algebra]]

===The Big Picture===
*Basic: [[User:Millosh/Internet and Programming for Linguists/The Big Picture|The Big Picture]] -- how computers and Internet are working.
*Cultural education: History of computing and Internet.
*Independent: How to be up to date?

===GNU/Linux===
*Basic: Using GNU/Linux -- things like cp/ls/mv/rm/mkdir and installation of GNU/Linux (Debian), vim, joe; basic shell scripting (bash).
*Independent: Debian package system, Samba, Apache, ssh and so on.
*Independent: How to find the right software?
*Independent: Installation and update of the system (in depth)

===GUI===
*Basic: Gnome and xfce
*Basic: GNU/Linux equivalents to MS Windows programs (Firefox, OpenOffice, Gimp etc.)

===Text processing===
*Basic: OpenOffice in depth
*Basic: character sets manipulation (Character map programs, iconv, other [natural] language specific tools)
*Basic: Regular expressions and their implementations in sed, vim and Perl.
*Advanced: TeX

===Programming===
*Basic: HTML
*Advenced: XML
*Basic: Ruby
*Basic: SQL (PostgreSQL implementation)
*Extra: Python
*Advanced: Web programming in Ruby

===Internet===
*Basic: How to find information (Google, Wikipedia)

===Learning order===
The first paradigm is related to types, the second is related to sections. So, in this moment order of lessons is:

*Basic: The Big Picture -- how computers and Internet are working.
*Basic: Using GNU/Linux -- things like cp/ls/mv/rm/mkdir and installation of GNU/Linux (Debian), vim, joe; basic shell scripting (bash).
*Basic: Gnome and xfce
*Basic: GNU/Linux equivalents to MS Windows programs (Firefox, OpenOffice, Gimp etc.)
*Basic: OpenOffice in depth
*Basic: character sets manipulation (Character map programs, iconv, other [natural] language specific tools)
*Basic: Regular expressions and their implementations in sed, vim and Perl.
*Basic: HTML
*Basic: Ruby
*Basic: SQL (PostgreSQL implementation)
*Basic: How to find information (Google, Wikipedia)
*Independent: How to be up to date?
*Independent: Debian package system, Samba, Apache, ssh and so on.
*Independent: How to find the right software?
*Independent: Installation and update of the system (in depth)
*Advanced: TeX
*Advenced: XML
*Advanced: Web programming in Ruby
*Extra: Python
*Cultural education: History of computing and Internet.</text>

It has internal memory (what DOS/Windows people call &quot;RAM&quot; and Unix people often call &quot;core&quot;; the Unix term is a folk memory from when RAM consisted of ferrite-core donuts). The processor and memory live on the ''motherboard'', which is the heart of your computer.

Your computer has a screen and keyboard. It has hard drives and a CD-ROM and maybe a floppy disk. Some of these devices are run by ''controller cards'' that plug into the motherboard and help the computer drive them; others are run by specialized chipsets directly on the motherboard that fulfill the same function as a controller card. Your keyboard is too simple to need a separate card; the controller is built into the keyboard chassis itself.

We'll go into some of the details of how these devices work later. For now, here are a few basic things to keep in mind about how they work together:

All the parts of your computer inside the case are connected by a ''bus''. Physically, the bus is what you plug your controller cards into (the video card, the disk controller, a sound card if you have one). The bus is the data highway between your processor, your screen, your disk, and everything else.

(If you've seen references to ‘ISA’, ‘PCI’, and ‘PCMCIA’ in connection with PCs and have not understood them, these are bus types. ISA is, except in minor details, the same bus that was used on IBM's original PCs in 1980; it is passing out of use now. PCI, for Peripheral Component Interconnection, is the bus used on most modern PCs, and on modern Macintoshes as well. PCMCIA is a variant of ISA with smaller physical connectors used on laptop computers.)

The processor, which makes everything else go, can't actually see any of the other pieces directly; it has to talk to them over the bus. The only other subsystem that it has really fast, immediate access to is memory (the core). In order for programs to run, then, they have to be ''in core'' (in memory).

When your computer reads a program or data off the disk, what actually happens is that the processor uses the bus to send a disk read request to your disk controller. Some time later the disk controller uses the bus to signal the processor that it has read the data and put it in a certain location in memory. The processor can then use the bus to look at that data.

Your keyboard and screen also communicate with the processor via the bus, but in simpler ways. We'll discuss those later on. For now, you know enough to understand what happens when you turn on your computer.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A computer&lt;ref&gt;This document contains material from [http://en.tldp.org/HOWTO/Unix-and-Internet-Fundamentals-HOWTO/ The Unix and Internet Fundamentals HOWTO] made by [http://www.catb.org/~esr/ Eric S. Raymond], version 2.9 from 2004-03-03. According to the [http://www.tldp.org/manifesto.html LDP manifesto], text is adopted under the terms of [[GNU Free Documentation License|GNU Free Documentation License 1.2 or any later]].&lt;/ref&gt; without a program running is just an inert hunk of electronics. The first thing a computer has to do when it is turned on is start up a special program called an ''operating system''. The operating system's job is to help other computer programs to work by handling the messy details of controlling the computer's hardware.

The process of bringing up the operating system is called ''booting'' (originally this was ''bootstrapping'' and alluded to the process of pulling yourself up &quot;by your bootstraps&quot;). Your computer knows how to boot because instructions for booting are built into one of its chips, the BIOS (or Basic Input/Output System) chip.

The BIOS chip tells it to look in a fixed place, usually on the lowest-numbered hard disk (the ''boot disk'') for a special program called a ''boot loader'' (under Linux the boot loader is called Grub or LILO). The boot loader is pulled into memory and started. The boot loader's job is to start the real operating system.

The loader does this by looking for a ''kernel'', loading it into memory, and starting it. When you boot Linux and see &quot;LILO&quot; on the screen followed by a bunch of dots, it is loading the kernel. (Each dot means it has loaded another ''disk block'' of kernel code.)

(You may wonder why the BIOS doesn't load the kernel directly — why the two-step process with the boot loader? Well, the BIOS isn't very smart. In fact it's very stupid, and Linux doesn't use it at all after boot time. It was originally written for primitive 8-bit PCs with tiny disks, and literally can't access enough of the disk to load the kernel directly. The boot loader step also lets you start one of several operating systems off different places on your disk, in the unlikely event that Unix isn't good enough for you.)

Once the kernel starts, it has to look around, find the rest of the hardware, and get ready to run programs. It does this by poking not at ordinary memory locations but rather at ''I/O ports'' — special bus addresses that are likely to have device controller cards listening at them for commands. The kernel doesn't poke at random; it has a lot of built-in knowledge about what it's likely to find where, and how controllers will respond if they're present. This process is called ''autoprobing''.

Most of the messages you see at boot time are the kernel autoprobing your hardware through the I/O ports, figuring out what it has available to it and adapting itself to your machine. The Linux kernel is extremely good at this, better than most other Unixes and ''much'' better than DOS or Windows. In fact, many Linux old-timers think the cleverness of Linux's boot-time probes (which made it relatively easy to install) was a major reason it broke out of the pack of free-Unix experiments to attract a critical mass of users.

But getting the kernel fully loaded and running isn't the end of the boot process; it's just the first stage (sometimes called ''run level 1''). After this first stage, the kernel hands control to a special process called ‘init’ which spawns several housekeeping processes.

The init process's first job is usually to check to make sure your disks are OK. Disk file systems are fragile things; if they've been damaged by a hardware failure or a sudden power outage, there are good reasons to take recovery steps before your Unix is all the way up. We'll go into some of this later on when we talk about how file systems can go wrong.

Init's next step is to start several ''daemons''. A daemon is a program like a print spooler, a mail listener or a WWW server that lurks in the background, waiting for things to do. These special programs often have to coordinate several requests that could conflict. They are daemons because it's often easier to write one program that runs constantly and knows about all requests than it would be to try to make sure that a flock of copies (each processing one request and all running at the same time) don't step on each other. The particular collection of daemons your system starts may vary, but will almost always include a print spooler (a gatekeeper daemon for your printer).

The next step is to prepare for users. Init starts a copy of a program called '''getty''' to watch your console (and maybe more copies to watch dial-in serial ports). This program is what issues the '''login''' prompt to your console. Once all daemons and getty processes for each terminal are started, we're at ''run level 2''. At this level, you can log in and run programs.

But we're not done yet. The next step is to start up various daemons that support networking and other services. Once that's done, we're at ''run level 3'' and the system is fully ready for use.

Raymond], version 2.9 from 2004-03-03. According to the [http://www.tldp.org/manifesto.html LDP manifesto], text is adopted under the terms of [[GNU Free Documentation License|GNU Free Documentation License 1.2 or any later]].&lt;/ref&gt; (give a name to '''getty''') you identify yourself to the computer. It then runs a program called (naturally enough) '''login''', which takes your password and checks to see if you are authorized to be using the machine. If you aren't, your login attempt will be rejected. If you are, login does a few housekeeping things and then starts up a command interpreter, the ''shell''. (Yes, '''getty''' and '''login''' could be one program. They're separate for historical reasons not worth going into here.)

Here's a bit more about what the system does before giving you a shell (you'll need to know this later when we talk about file permissions). You identify yourself with a login name and password. That login name is looked up in a file called /etc/passwd, which is a sequence of lines each describing a user account.

One of these fields is an encrypted version of the account password (sometimes the encrypted fields are actually kept in a second /etc/shadow file with tighter permissions; this makes password cracking harder). What you enter as an account password is encrypted in exactly the same way, and the '''login''' program checks to see if they match. The security of this method depends on the fact that, while it's easy to go from your clear password to the encrypted version, the reverse is very hard. Thus, even if someone can see the encrypted version of your password, they can't use your account. (It also means that if you forget your password, there's no way to recover it, only to change it to something else you choose.)

Once you have successfully logged in, you get all the privileges associated with the individual account you are using. You may also be recognized as part of a ''group''. A group is a named collection of users set up by the system administrator. Groups can have privileges independently of their members’ privileges. A user can be a member of multiple groups. (For details about how Unix privileges work, see the section below on permissions.)

(Note that although you will normally refer to users and groups by name, they are actually stored internally as numeric IDs. The password file maps your account name to a user ID; the &lt;code&gt;/etc/group&lt;/code&gt; file maps group names to numeric group IDs. Commands that deal with accounts and groups do the translation automatically.)

Your account entry also contains your ''home directory'', the place in the Unix file system where your personal files will live. Finally, your account entry also sets your ''shell'', the command interpreter that '''login''' will start up to accept your commmands.

Raymond], version 2.9 from 2004-03-03. According to the [http://www.tldp.org/manifesto.html LDP manifesto], text is adopted under the terms of [[GNU Free Documentation License|GNU Free Documentation License 1.2 or any later]].&lt;/ref&gt; is Unix's interpreter for the commands you type in; it's called a shell because it wraps around and hides the operating system kernel. It's an important feature of Unix that the shell and kernel are separate programs communicating through a small set of system calls. This makes it possible for there to be multiple shells, suiting different tastes in interfaces.

The normal shell gives you the ‘$’ prompt that you see after logging in (unless you've customized it to be something else). We won't talk about shell syntax and the easy things you can see on the screen here; instead we'll take a look behind the scenes at what's happening from the computer's point of view.

After boot time and before you run a program, you can think of your computer as containing a zoo of processes that are all waiting for something to do. They're all waiting on ''events''. An event can be you pressing a key or moving a mouse. Or, if your machine is hooked to a network, an event can be a data packet coming in over that network.

The kernel is one of these processes. It's a special one, because it controls when the other ''user processes'' can run, and it is normally the only process with direct access to the machine's hardware. In fact, user processes have to make requests to the kernel when they want to get keyboard input, write to your screen, read from or write to disk, or do just about anything other than crunching bits in memory. These requests are known as ''system calls''.

Normally all I/O goes through the kernel so it can schedule the operations and prevent processes from stepping on each other. A few special user processes are allowed to slide around the kernel, usually by being given direct access to I/O ports. X servers (the programs that handle other programs’ requests to do screen graphics on most Unix boxes) are the most common example of this. But we haven't gotten to an X server yet; you're looking at a shell prompt on a character console.

The shell is just a user process, and not a particularly special one. It waits on your keystrokes, listening (through the kernel) to the keyboard I/O port. As the kernel sees them, it echoes them to your screen. When the kernel sees an ‘Enter’ it passes your line of text to the shell. The shell tries to interpret those keystrokes as commands.

Let's say you type ‘ls’ and Enter to invoke the Unix directory lister. The shell applies its built-in rules to figure out that you want to run the executable command in the file &lt;code&gt;/bin/ls&lt;/code&gt;. It makes a system call asking the kernel to start /bin/ls as a new ''child process'' and give it access to the screen and keyboard through the kernel. Then the shell goes to sleep, waiting for ls to finish.

When '''/bin/ls''' is done, it tells the kernel it's finished by issuing an ''exit'' system call. The kernel then wakes up the shell and tells it it can continue running. The shell issues another prompt and waits for another line of input.

Other things may be going on while your ‘ls’ is executing, however (we'll have to suppose that you're listing a very long directory). You might switch to another virtual console, log in there, and start a game of Quake, for example. Or, suppose you're hooked up to the Internet. Your machine might be sending or receiving mail while '''/bin/ls''' runs.

According to the [http://www.tldp.org/manifesto.html LDP manifesto], text is adopted under the terms of [[GNU Free Documentation License|GNU Free Documentation License 1.2 or any later]].&lt;/ref&gt; is a very simple input device; simple because it generates small amounts of data very slowly (by a computer's standards). When you press or release a key, that event is signalled up the keyboard cable to raise a ''hardware interrupt''.

It's the operating system's job to watch for such interrupts. For each possible kind of interrupt, there will be an ''interrupt handler'', a part of the operating system that stashes away any data associated with them (like your keypress/keyrelease value) until it can be processed.

What the interrupt handler for your keyboard actually does is post the key value into a system area near the bottom of memory. There, it will be available for inspection when the operating system passes control to whichever program is currently supposed to be reading from the keyboard.

More complex input devices like disk or network cards work in a similar way. Earlier, I referred to a disk controller using the bus to signal that a disk request has been fulfilled. What actually happens is that the disk raises an interrupt. The disk interrupt handler then copies the retrieved data into memory, for later use by the program that made the request.

Every kind of interrupt has an associated ''priority level''. Lower-priority interrupts (like keyboard events) have to wait on higher-priority interrupts (like clock ticks or disk events). Unix is designed to give high priority to the kinds of events that need to be processed rapidly in order to keep the machine's response smooth.

In your operating system's boot-time messages, you may see references to ''IRQ'' numbers. You may be aware that one of the common ways to misconfigure hardware is to have two different devices try to use the same IRQ, without understanding exactly why.

Here's the answer. IRQ is short for &quot;Interrupt Request&quot;. The operating system needs to know at startup time which numbered interrupts each hardware device will use, so it can associate the proper handlers with each one. If two different devices try use the same IRQ, interrupts will sometimes get dispatched to the wrong handler. This will usually at least lock up the device, and can sometimes confuse the OS badly enough that it will flake out or crash.

Raymond], version 2.9 from 2004-03-03.

But a computer can change tasks very rapidly, and fool slow human beings into thinking it's doing several things at once. This is called ''timesharing''.

One of the kernel's jobs is to manage timesharing. It has a part called the ''scheduler'' which keeps information inside itself about all the other (non-kernel) processes in your zoo. Every 1/60th of a second, a timer goes off in the kernel, generating a clock interrupt. The scheduler stops whatever process is currently running, suspends it in place, and hands control to another process.

1/60th of a second may not sound like a lot of time. But on today's microprocessors it's enough to run tens of thousands of machine instructions, which can do a great deal of work. So even if you have many processes, each one can accomplish quite a bit in each of its timeslices.

In practice, a program may not get its entire timeslice. If an interrupt comes in from an I/O device, the kernel effectively stops the current task, runs the interrupt handler, and then returns to the current task. A storm of high-priority interrupts can squeeze out normal processing; this misbehavior is called ''thrashing'' and is fortunately very hard to induce under modern Unixes.

In fact, the speed of programs is only very seldom limited by the amount of machine time they can get (there are a few exceptions to this rule, such as sound or 3-D graphics generation). Much more often, delays are caused when the program has to wait on data from a disk drive or network connection.

An operating system that can routinely support many simultaneous processes is called &quot;multitasking&quot;. The Unix family of operating systems was designed from the ground up for multitasking and is very good at it — much more effective than Windows or the old Mac OS, which had multitasking bolted into them as an afterthought and do it rather poorly. Efficient, reliable multitasking is a large part of what makes Linux superior for networking, communications, and Web service.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Last Theorem ==

Fermat's Last Theorem can be stated simply as follows:

:It is impossible to separate any power higher than the second into two like powers,

or, more precisely:

:If an integer ''n'' is greater than 2, then the equation ''a&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; + b&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; = c&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' has no solutions in non-zero integers ''a'', ''b'', and ''c''. 

If you let ''n'' = 2, the equation takes the form used in the Pythagorean Theorem.

Since this equation can be satisfied by non-zero integers, the requirement that ''n'' be greater than 2 is necessary.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The kernel's scheduler&lt;ref&gt;This document contains material from [http://en.tldp.org/HOWTO/Unix-and-Internet-Fundamentals-HOWTO/ The Unix and Internet Fundamentals HOWTO] made by [http://www.catb.org/~esr/ Eric S. Raymond], version 2.9 from 2004-03-03. According to the [http://www.tldp.org/manifesto.html LDP manifesto], text is adopted under the terms of [[GNU Free Documentation License|GNU Free Documentation License 1.2 or any later]].&lt;/ref&gt; takes care of dividing processes in time. Your operating system also has to divide them in space, so that processes can't step on each others'; working memory. Even if you assume that all programs are trying to be cooperative, you don't want a bug in one of them to be able to corrupt others. The things your operating system does to solve this problem are called ''memory management''.

Each process in your zoo needs its own area of memory, as a place to run its code from and keep variables and results in. You can think of this set as consisting of a read-only ''code segment'' (containing the process's instructions) and a writeable ''data segment'' (containing all the process's variable storage). The data segment is truly unique to each process, but if two processes are running the same code Unix automatically arranges for them to share a single code segment as an efficiency measure.

===Virtual memory: the simple version===

Efficiency is important, because memory is expensive. Sometimes you don't have enough to hold the entirety of all the programs the machine is running, especially if you are using a large program like an X server. To get around this, Unix uses a technique called &lt;a name=&quot;vm&quot;&gt; ''virtual memory''. It doesn't try to hold all the code and data for a process in memory. Instead, it keeps around only a relatively small ''working set''; the rest of the process's state is left in a special ''swap space'' area on your hard disk.

Note that in the past, that &quot;Sometimes&quot; last paragraph ago was &quot;Almost always&quot; — the size of memory was typically small relative to the size of running programs, so swapping was frequent. Memory is far less expensive nowadays and even low-end machines have quite a lot of it. On modern single-user machines with 64MB of memory and up, it's possible to run X and a typical mix of jobs without ever swapping after they're initially loaded into core.

===Virtual memory: the detailed version===

Actually, the last section oversimplified things a bit. Yes, programs see most of your memory as one big flat bank of addresses bigger than physical memory, and disk swapping is used to maintain that illusion. But your hardware actually has no fewer than five different kinds of memory in it, and the differences between them can matter a good deal when programs have to be tuned for maximum speed. To really understand what goes on in your machine, you should learn how all of them work.

The five kinds of memory are these: processor registers, internal (or on-chip) cache, external (or off-chip) cache, main memory, and disk. And the reason there are so many kinds is simple: speed costs money. I have listed these kinds of memory in decreasing order of access time and increasing order of cost. Register memory is the fastest and most expensive and can be random-accessed about a billion times a second, while disk is the slowest and cheapest and can do about 100 random accesses a second.

Here's a full list reflecting early-2000 speeds for a typical desktop machine. While speed and capacity will go up and prices will drop, you can expect these ratios to remain fairly constant — and it's those ratios that shape the memory hierarchy.

;Disk
:Size: 13000MB Accesses: 100KB/sec
;Main memory
:Size: 256MB Accesses: 100M/sec
;External cache
:Size: 512KB Accesses: 250M/sec
;Internal Cache
:Size: 32KB Accesses: 500M/sec
;Processor
:Size: 28 bytes Accesses: 1000M/sec

We can't build everything out of the fastest kinds of memory. It would be way too expensive — and even if it weren't, fast memory is volatile. That is, it loses its marbles when the power goes off. Thus, computers have to have hard disks or other kinds of non-volatile storage that retains data when the power goes off. And there's a huge mismatch between the speed of processors and the speed of disks. The middle three levels of the memory hierarchy (''internal cache'', ''external cache'', and main memory) basically exist to bridge that gap.

Linux and other Unixes have a feature called ''virtual memory''. What this means is that the operating system behaves as though it has much more main memory than it actually does. Your actual physical main memory behaves like a set of windows or caches on a much larger &quot;virtual&quot; memory space, most of which at any given time is actually stored on disk in a special zone called the ''swap area''. Out of sight of user programs, the OS is moving blocks of data (called &quot;pages&quot;) between memory and disk to maintain this illusion. The end result is that your virtual memory is much larger but not too much slower than real memory.

How much slower virtual memory is than physical depends on how well the operating system's swapping algorithms match the way your programs use virtual memory. Fortunately, memory reads and writes that are close together in time also tend to cluster in memory space. This tendency is called ''locality'', or more formally ''locality of reference'' — and it's a good thing. If memory references jumped around virtual space at random, you'd typically have to do a disk read and write for each new reference and virtual memory would be as slow as a disk. But because programs do actually exhibit strong locality, your operating system can do relatively few swaps per reference.

It's been found by experience that the most effective method for a broad class of memory-usage patterns is very simple; it's called LRU or the &quot;least recently used&quot; algorithm. The virtual-memory system grabs disk blocks into its ''working set'' as it needs them. When it runs out of physical memory for the working set, it dumps the least-recently-used block. All Unixes, and most other virtual-memory operating systems, use minor variations on LRU.

Virtual memory is the first link in the bridge between disk and processor speeds. It's explicitly managed by the OS. But there is still a major gap between the speed of physical main memory and the speed at which a processor can access its register memory. The external and internal caches address this, using a technique similar to virtual memory as I've described it.

Just as the physical main memory behaves like a set of windows or caches on the disk's swap area, the external cache acts as windows on main memory. External cache is faster (250M accesses per sec, rather than 100M) and smaller. The hardware (specifically, your computer's memory controller) does the LRU thing in the external cache on blocks of data fetched from the main memory. For historical reasons, the unit of cache swapping is called a ''line'' rather than a page.

But we're not done. The internal cache gives us the final step-up in effective speed by caching portions of the external cache. It is faster and smaller yet — in fact, it lives right on the processor chip.

If you want to make your programs really fast, it's useful to know these details. Your programs get faster when they have stronger locality, because that makes the caching work better. The easiest way to make programs fast is therefore to make them small. If a program isn't slowed down by lots of disk I/O or waits on network events, it will usually run at the speed of the smallest cache that it will fit inside.

If you can't make your whole program small, some effort to tune the speed-critical portions so they have stronger locality can pay off. Details on techniques for doing such tuning are beyond the scope of this tutorial; by the time you need them, you'll be intimate enough with some compiler to figure out many of them yourself.

===The Memory Management Unit===

Even when you have enough physical core to avoid swapping, the part of the operating system called the ''memory manager'' still has important work to do. It has to make sure that programs can only alter their own data segments — that is, prevent erroneous or malicious code in one program from garbaging the data in another. To do this, it keeps a table of data and code segments. The table is updated whenever a process either requests more memory or releases memory (the latter usually when it exits).

This table is used to pass commands to a specialized part of the underlying hardware called an ''MMU'' or ''memory management unit''. Modern processor chips have MMUs built right onto them. The MMU has the special ability to put fences around areas of memory, so an out-of-bound reference will be refused and cause a special interrupt to be raised.

If you ever see a Unix message that says &quot;Segmentation fault&quot;, &quot;core dumped&quot; or something similar, this is exactly what has happened; an attempt by the running program to access memory (core) outside its segment has raised a fatal interrupt. This indicates a bug in the program code; the ''core dump'' it leaves behind is diagnostic information intended to help a programmer track it down.

There is another aspect to protecting processes from each other besides segregating the memory they access. You also want to be able to control their file accesses so a buggy or malicious program can't corrupt critical pieces of the system. This is why Unix has file permissions which we'll discuss later.

===How does my computer store things in memory?===

You probably know that everything on a computer is stored as strings of bits (binary digits; you can think of them as lots of little on-off switches). Here we'll explain how those bits are used to represent the letters and numbers that your computer is crunching.

Before we can go into this, you need to understand about the ''word size'' of your computer. The word size is the computer's preferred size for moving units of information around; technically it's the width of your processor's ''registers'', which are the holding areas your processor uses to do arithmetic and logical calculations. When people write about computers having bit sizes (calling them, say, &quot;32-bit&quot; or &quot;64-bit&quot; computers), this is what they mean.

Most computers (including 386, 486, and Pentium PCs) have a word size of 32 bits. The old 286 machines had a word size of 16. Old-style mainframes often had 36-bit words. The AMD Opteron, Intel Itanium, and the Alpha from what used to be DEC and is now Compaq have 64-bit words.

The computer views your memory as a sequence of words numbered from zero up to some large value dependent on your memory size. That value is limited by your word size, which is why programs on older machines like 286s had to go through painful contortions to address large amounts of memory. I won't describe them here; they still give older programmers nightmares.

===Numbers===

Integer numbers are represented as either words or pairs of words, depending on your processor's word size. One 32-bit machine word is the most common integer representation.

Integer arithmetic is close to but not actually mathematical base-two. The low-order bit is 1, next 2, then 4 and so forth as in pure binary. But signed numbers are represented in ''twos-complement'' notation. The highest-order bit is a ''sign bit'' which makes the quantity negative, and every negative number can be obtained from the corresponding positive value by inverting all the bits and adding one. This is why integers on a 32-bit machine have the range -2&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt; to 2&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt; - 1. That 32nd bit is being used for sign; 0 means a positive number or zero, 1 a negative number.

Some computer languages give you access to ''unsigned arithmetic'' which is straight base 2 with zero and positive numbers only.

Most processors and some languages can do operations in ''floating-point'' numbers (this capability is built into all recent processor chips). Floating-point numbers give you a much wider range of values than integers and let you express fractions. The ways in which this is done vary and are rather too complicated to discuss in detail here, but the general idea is much like so-called ‘scientific notation’, where one might write (say) 1.234 * 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;; the encoding of the number is split into a ''mantissa'' (1.234) and the exponent part (23) for the power-of-ten multiplier (which means the number multiplied out would have 20 zeros on it, 23 minus the three decimal places).

===Characters===

Characters are normally represented as strings of seven bits each in an encoding called ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange). On modern machines, each of the 128 ASCII characters is the low seven bits of an ''octet'' or 8-bit byte; octets are packed into memory words so that (for example) a six-character string only takes up two memory words. For an ASCII code chart, type ‘man 7 ascii’ at your Unix prompt.

The preceding paragraph was misleading in two ways. The minor one is that the term ‘octet’ is formally correct but seldom actually used; most people refer to an octet as ''byte'' and expect bytes to be eight bits long. Strictly speaking, the term ‘byte’ is more general; there used to be, for example, 36-bit machines with 9-bit bytes (though there probably never will be again).

The major one is that not all the world uses ASCII. In fact, much of the world can't — ASCII, while fine for American English, lacks many accented and other special characters needed by users of other languages. Even British English has trouble with the lack of a pound-currency sign.

There have been several attempts to fix this problem. All use the extra high bit that ASCII doesn't, making it the low half of a 256-character set. The most widely-used of these is the so-called ‘Latin-1’ character set (more formally called ISO 8859-1). This is the default character set for Linux, HTML, and X. Microsoft Windows uses a mutant version of Latin-1 that adds a bunch of characters such as right and left double quotes in places proper Latin-1 leaves unassigned for historical reasons (for a scathing account of the trouble this causes, see the [http://www.fourmilab.ch/webtools/demoroniser/ demoroniser page]).

Latin-1 handles western European languages, including English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Dutch, Norwegian, Swedish, Danish. However, this isn't good enough either, and as a result there is a whole series of Latin-2 through -9 character sets to handle things like Greek, Arabic, Hebrew, Esperanto, and Serbo-Croatian. For details, see the [http://www.utia.cas.cz/user_data/vs/documents/ISO-8859-X-charsets.html ISO alphabet soup page].

The ultimate solution is a huge standard called Unicode (and its identical twin ISO/IEC 10646-1:1993). Unicode is identical to Latin-1 in its lowest 256 slots. Above these in 16-bit space it includes Greek, Cyrillic, Armenian, Hebrew, Arabic, Devanagari, Bengali, Gurmukhi, Gujarati, Oriya, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Thai, Lao, Georgian, Tibetan, Japanese Kana, the complete set of modern Korean Hangul, and a unified set of Chinese/Japanese/Korean (CJK) ideographs. For details, see the [http://www.unicode.org/ Unicode Home Page].

Raymond], version 2.9 from 2004-03-03. According to the [http://www.tldp.org/manifesto.html LDP manifesto], text is adopted under the terms of [[GNU Free Documentation License|GNU Free Documentation License 1.2 or any later]].&lt;/ref&gt; at a hard disk under Unix, you see a tree of named directories and files. Normally you won't need to look any deeper than that, but it does become useful to know what's going on underneath if you have a disk crash and need to try to salvage files. Unfortunately, there's no good way to describe disk organization from the file level downwards, so I'll have to describe it from the hardware up.

===Low-level disk and file system structure===

The surface area of your disk, where it stores data, is divided up something like a dartboard — into circular tracks which are then pie-sliced into sectors. Because tracks near the outer edge have more area than those close to the spindle at the center of the disk, the outer tracks have more sector slices in them than the inner ones. Each sector (or ''disk block'') has the same size, which under modern Unixes is generally 1 binary K (1024 8-bit words). Each disk block has a unique address or ''disk block number''.

Unix divides the disk into ''disk partitions''. Each partition is a continuous span of blocks that's used separately from any other partition, either as a file system or as swap space. The original reasons for partitions had to do with crash recovery in a world of much slower and more error-prone disks; the boundaries between them reduce the fraction of your disk likely to become inaccessible or corrupted by a random bad spot on the disk. Nowadays, it's more important that partitions can be declared read-only (preventing an intruder from modifying critical system files) or shared over a network through various means we won't discuss here. The lowest-numbered partition on a disk is often treated specially, as a ''boot partition'' where you can put a kernel to be booted.

Each partition is either ''swap space'' (used to implement virtual memory) or a ''file system'' used to hold files. Swap-space partitions are just treated as a linear sequence of blocks. File systems, on the other hand, need a way to map file names to sequences of disk blocks. Because files grow, shrink, and change over time, a file's data blocks will not be a linear sequence but may be scattered all over its partition (from wherever the operating system can find a free block when it needs one). This scattering effect is called ''fragmentation''.

===File names and directories===

Within each file system, the mapping from names to blocks is handled through a structure called an ''i-node''. There's a pool of these things near the &quot;bottom&quot; (lowest-numbered blocks) of each file system (the very lowest ones are used for housekeeping and labeling purposes we won't describe here). Each i-node describes one file. File data blocks (including directories) live above the i-nodes (in higher-numbered blocks).

Every i-node contains a list of the disk block numbers in the file it describes. (Actually this is a half-truth, only correct for small files, but the rest of the details aren't important here.) Note that the i-node does ''not'' contain the name of the file.

Names of files live in ''directory structures''. A directory structure just maps names to i-node numbers. This is why, in Unix, a file can have multiple true names (or ''hard links''); they're just multiple directory entries that happen to point to the same i-node.

===Mount points===

In the simplest case, your entire Unix file system lives in just one disk partition. While you'll see this arrangement on some small personal Unix systems, it's unusual. More typical is for it to be spread across several disk partitions, possibly on different physical disks. So, for example, your system may have one small partition where the kernel lives, a slightly larger one where OS utilities live, and a much bigger one where user home directories live.

The only partition you'll have access to immediately after system boot is your ''root partition'', which is (almost always) the one you booted from. It holds the root directory of the file system, the top node from which everything else hangs.

The other partitions in the system have to be attached to this root in order for your entire, multiple-partition file system to be accessible. About midway through the boot process, your Unix will make these non-root partitions accessible. It will ''mount'' each one onto a directory on the root partition.

For example, if you have a Unix directory called &lt;code&gt;/usr&lt;/code&gt;, it is probably a mount point to a partition that contains many programs installed with your Unix but not required during initial boot.

===How a file gets looked up===

Now we can look at the file system from the top down. When you open a file (such as, say, &lt;code&gt;/home/esr/WWW/ldp/fundamentals.xml&lt;/code&gt;) here is what happens:

Your kernel starts at the root of your Unix file system (in the root partition). It looks for a directory there called ‘home’. Usually ‘home’ is a mount point to a large user partition elsewhere, so it will go there. In the top-level directory structure of that user partition, it will look for a entry called ‘esr’ and extract an i-node number. It will go to that i-node, notice that its associated file data blocks are a directory structure, and look up ‘WWW’. Extracting ''that'' i-node, it will go to the corresponding subdirectory and look up ‘ldp’. That will take it to yet another directory i-node. Opening that one, it will find an i-node number for ‘fundamentals.xml’. That i-node is not a directory, but instead holds the list of disk blocks associated with the file.

===File ownership, permissions and security===

To keep programs from accidentally or maliciously stepping on data they shouldn't, Unix has ''permission'' features. These were originally designed to support timesharing by protecting multiple users on the same machine from each other, back in the days when Unix ran mainly on expensive shared minicomputers.

In order to understand file permissions, you need to recall the description of users and groups in the section What happens when you log in?. Each file has an owning user and an owning group. These are initially those of the file's creator; they can be changed with the programs chown(1) and chgrp(1).

The basic permissions that can be associated with a file are ‘read’ (permission to read data from it), ‘write’ (permission to modify it) and ‘execute’ (permission to run it as a program). Each file has three sets of permissions; one for its owning user, one for any user in its owning group, and one for everyone else. The ‘privileges’ you get when you log in are just the ability to do read, write, and execute on those files for which the permission bits match your user ID or one of the groups you are in, or files that have been made accessible to the world.

To see how these may interact and how Unix displays them, let's look at some file listings on a hypothetical Unix system. Here's one:

&lt;pre&gt;
snark:~$ ls -l notes
-rw-r--r-- 1 esr users 2993 Jun 17 11:00 notes
&lt;/pre&gt;

This is an ordinary data file. The listing tells us that it's owned by the user ‘esr’ and was created with the owning group ‘users’. Probably the machine we're on puts every ordinary user in this group by default; other groups you commonly see on timesharing machines are ‘staff’, ‘admin’, or ‘wheel’ (for obvious reasons, groups are not very important on single-user workstations or PCs). Your Unix may use a different default group, perhaps one named after your user ID.

The string ‘-rw-r--r--’ represents the permission bits for the file. The very first dash is the position for the directory bit; it would show ‘d’ if the file were a directory, or would show ‘l’ if the file were a symbolic link. After that, the first three places are user permissions, the second three group permissions, and the third are permissions for others (often called ‘world’ permissions). On this file, the owning user ‘esr’ may read or write the file, other people in the ‘users’ group may read it, and everybody else in the world may read it. This is a pretty typical set of permissions for an ordinary data file.

Now let's look at a file with very different permissions. This file is GCC, the GNU C compiler.

&lt;pre&gt;
snark:~$ ls -l /usr/bin/gcc
-rwxr-xr-x 3 root bin 64796 Mar 21 16:41 /usr/bin/gcc
&lt;/pre&gt;

This file belongs to a user called ‘root’ and a group called ‘bin’; it can be written (modified) only by root, but read or executed by anyone. This is a typical ownership and set of permissions for a pre-installed system command. The ‘bin’ group exists on some Unixes to group together system commands (the name is a historical relic, short for ‘binary’). Your Unix might use a ‘root’ group instead (not quite the same as the ‘root' user!).

The ‘root’ user is the conventional name for numeric user ID 0, a special, privileged account that can override all privileges. Root access is useful but dangerous; a typing mistake while you're logged in as root can clobber critical system files that the same command executed from an ordinary user account could not touch.

Because the root account is so powerful, access to it should be guarded very carefully. Your root password is the single most critical piece of security information on your system, and it is what any crackers and intruders who ever come after you will be trying to get.

About passwords: Don't write them down — and don't pick a passwords that can easily be guessed, like the first name of your girlfriend/boyfriend/spouse. This is an astonishingly common bad practice that helps crackers no end. In general, don't pick any word in the dictionary; there are programs called ''dictionary crackers'' that look for likely passwords by running through word lists of common choices. A good technique is to pick a combination consisting of a word, a digit, and another word, such as ‘shark6cider’ or ‘jump3joy’; that will make the search space too large for a dictionary cracker. Don't use these examples, though — crackers might expect that after reading this document and put them in their dictionaries.

Now let's look at a third case:

&lt;pre&gt;
snark:~$ ls -ld ~
drwxr-xr-x 89 esr users 9216 Jun 27 11:29 /home2/esr
snark:~$ 
&lt;/pre&gt;

This file is a directory (note the ‘d’ in the first permissions slot). We see that it can be written only by esr, but read and executed by anybody else.

Read permission gives you the ability to list the directory — that is, to see the names of files and directories it contains. Write permission gives you the ability to create and delete files in the directory. If you remember that the directory includes a list of the names of the files and subdirectories it contains, these rules will make sense.

Execute permission on a directory means you can get through the directory to open the files and directories below it. In effect, it gives you permission to access the i-nodes in the directory. A directory with execute completely turned off would be useless.

Occasionally you'll see a directory that is world-executable but not world-readable; this means a random user can get to files and directories beneath it, but only by knowing their exact names (the directory cannot be listed).

It's important to remember that read, write, or execute permission on a directory is independent of the permissions on the files and directories beneath. In particular, write access on a directory means you can create new files or delete existing files there, but does not automatically give you write access to existing files.

Finally, let's look at the permissions of the login program itself.

&lt;pre&gt;
snark:~$ ls -l /bin/login
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root bin 20164 Apr 17 12:57 /bin/login
&lt;/pre&gt;

This has the permissions we'd expect for a system command — except for that ‘s’ where the owner-execute bit ought to be. This is the visible manifestation of a special permission called the ‘set-user-id’ or ''setuid bit''.

The setuid bit is normally attached to programs that need to give ordinary users the privileges of root, but in a controlled way. When it is set on an executable program, you get the privileges of the owner of that program file while the program is running on your behalf, whether or not they match your own.

Like the root account itself, setuid programs are useful but dangerous. Anyone who can subvert or modify a setuid program owned by root can use it to spawn a shell with root privileges. For this reason, opening a file to write it automatically turns off its setuid bit on most Unixes. Many attacks on Unix security try to exploit bugs in setuid programs in order to subvert them. Security-conscious system administrators are therefore extra-careful about these programs and reluctant to install new ones.

There are a couple of important details we glossed over when discussing permissions above; namely, how the owning group and permissions are assigned when a file or directory is first created. The group is an issue because users can be members of multiple groups, but one of them (specified in the user's &lt;code&gt;/etc/passwd&lt;/code&gt; entry) is the user's ''default group'' and will normally own files created by the user.

The story with initial permission bits is a little more complicated. A program that creates a file will normally specify the permissions it is to start with. But these will be modified by a variable in the user's environment called the ''umask''. The umask specifies which permission bits to ''turn off'' when creating a file; the most common value, and the default on most systems, is -------w- or 002, which turns off the world-write bit. See the documentation of the umask command on your shell's manual page for details.

Initial directory group is also a bit complicated. On some Unixes a new directory gets the default group of the creating user (this in the System V convention); on others, it gets the owning group of the parent directory in which it's created (this is the BSD convention). On some modern Unixes, including Linux, the latter behavior can be selected by setting the set-group-ID on the directory (chmod g+s).

===How things can go wrong===

Earlier it was hinted that file systems can be fragile things. Now we know that to get to a file you have to hopscotch through what may be an arbitrarily long chain of directory and i-node references. Now suppose your hard disk develops a bad spot?

If you're lucky, it will only trash some file data. If you're unlucky, it could corrupt a directory structure or i-node number and leave an entire subtree of your system hanging in limbo — or, worse, result in a corrupted structure that points multiple ways at the same disk block or i-node. Such corruption can be spread by normal file operations, trashing data that was not in the original bad spot.

Fortunately, this kind of contingency has become quite uncommon as disk hardware has become more reliable. Still, it means that your Unix will want to integrity-check the file system periodically to make sure nothing is amiss. Modern Unixes do a fast integrity check on each partition at boot time, just before mounting it. Every few reboots they'll do a much more thorough check that takes a few minutes longer.

If all of this sounds like Unix is terribly complex and failure-prone, it may be reassuring to know that these boot-time checks typically catch and correct normal problems ''before'' they become really disastrous. Other operating systems don't have these facilities, which speeds up booting a bit but can leave you much more seriously screwed when attempting to recover by hand (and that's assuming you have a copy of Norton Utilities or whatever in the first place...).

One of the trends in current Unix designs is ''journalling file systems''. These arrange traffic to the disk so that it's guaranteed to be in a consistent state that can be recovered when the system comes back up. This will speed up the boot-time integrity check a lot.

      <text xml:space="preserve">We've already discussed&lt;ref&gt;This document contains material from [http://en.tldp.org/HOWTO/Unix-and-Internet-Fundamentals-HOWTO/ The Unix and Internet Fundamentals HOWTO] made by [http://www.catb.org/~esr/ Eric S. Raymond], version 2.9 from 2004-03-03. According to the [http://www.tldp.org/manifesto.html LDP manifesto], text is adopted under the terms of [[GNU Free Documentation License|GNU Free Documentation License 1.2 or any later]].&lt;/ref&gt; how programs are run. Every program ultimately has to execute as a stream of bytes that are instructions in your computer's ''machine language''. But human beings don't deal with machine language very well; doing so has become a rare, black art even among hackers.

Almost all Unix code except a small amount of direct hardware-interface support in the kernel itself is nowadays written in a ''high-level language''. (The ‘high-level’ in this term is a historical relic meant to distinguish these from ‘low-level’ ''assembler languages'', which are basically thin wrappers around machine code.)

There are several different kinds of high-level languages. In order to talk about these, you'll find it useful to bear in mind that the ''source code'' of a program (the human-created, editable version) has to go through some kind of translation into machine code that the machine can actually run.

===Compiled languages===

The most conventional kind of language is a ''compiled language''. Compiled languages get translated into runnable files of binary machine code by a special program called (logically enough) a ''compiler''. Once the binary has been generated, you can run it directly without looking at the source code again. (Most software is delivered as compiled binaries made from code you don't see.)

Compiled languages tend to give excellent performance and have the most complete access to the OS, but also to be difficult to program in.

C, the language in which Unix itself is written, is by far the most important of these (with its variant C++). FORTRAN is another compiled language still used among engineers and scientists but years older and much more primitive. In the Unix world no other compiled languages are in mainstream use. Outside it, COBOL is very widely used for financial and business software.

There used to be many other compiler languages, but most of them have either gone extinct or are strictly research tools. If you are a new Unix developer using a compiled language, it is overwhelmingly likely to be C or C++.

===Interpreted languages===

An ''interpreted language'' depends on an interpreter program that reads the source code and translates it on the fly into computations and system calls. The source has to be re-interpreted (and the interpreter present) each time the code is executed.

Interpreted languages tend to be slower than compiled languages, and often have limited access to the underlying operating system and hardware. On the other hand, they tend to be easier to program and more forgiving of coding errors than compiled languages.

Many Unix utilities, including the shell and bc(1) and sed(1) and awk(1), are effectively small interpreted languages. BASICs are usually interpreted. So is Tcl. Historically, the most important interpretive language has been LISP (a major improvement over most of its successors). Today, Unix shells and the Lisp that lives inside the Emacs editor are probably the most important pure interpreted languages.

===P-code languages===

Since 1990 a kind of hybrid language that uses both compilation and interpretation has become increasingly important. P-code languages are like compiled languages in that the source is translated to a compact binary form which is what you actually execute, but that form is not machine code. Instead it's ''pseudocode'' (or ''p-code''), which is usually a lot simpler but more powerful than a real machine language. When you run the program, you interpret the p-code.

P-code can run nearly as fast as a compiled binary (p-code interpreters can be made quite simple, small and speedy). But p-code languages can keep the flexibility and power of a good interpreter.

Important p-code languages include Python, Perl, and Java.

      <text xml:space="preserve">To help you&lt;ref&gt;This document contains material from [http://en.tldp.org/HOWTO/Unix-and-Internet-Fundamentals-HOWTO/ The Unix and Internet Fundamentals HOWTO] made by [http://www.catb.org/~esr/ Eric S. Raymond], version 2.9 from 2004-03-03. According to the [http://www.tldp.org/manifesto.html LDP manifesto], text is adopted under the terms of [[GNU Free Documentation License|GNU Free Documentation License 1.2 or any later]].&lt;/ref&gt; understand how the Internet works, we'll look at the things that happen when you do a typical Internet operation — pointing a browser at the front page of this document at its home on the Web at the Linux Documentation Project. This document is

&lt;pre&gt;
http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Unix-and-Internet-Fundamentals-HOWTO/index.html
&lt;/pre&gt;

which means it lives in the file HOWTO/Unix-and-Internet-Fundamentals-HOWTO/index.html under the World Wide Web export directory of the host www.tldp.org.

===Names and locations===

The first thing your browser has to do is to establish a network connection to the machine where the document lives. To do that, it first has to find the network location of the ''host'' www.tldp.org (‘host’ is short for ‘host machine’ or ‘network host'; www.tldp.org is a typical ''hostname''). The corresponding location is actually a number called an ''IP address'' (we'll explain the ‘IP’ part of this term later).

To do this, your browser queries a program called a ''name server''. The name server may live on your machine, but it's more likely to run on a service machine that yours talks to. When you sign up with an ISP, part of your setup procedure will almost certainly involve telling your Internet software the IP address of a nameserver on the ISP's network.

The name servers on different machines talk to each other, exchanging and keeping up to date all the information needed to resolve hostnames (map them to IP addresses). Your nameserver may query three or four different sites across the network in the process of resolving www.tldp.org, but this usually happens very quickly (as in less than a second). We'll look at how nameservers detail in the next section.

The nameserver will tell your browser that www.tldp.org's IP address is 152.19.254.81; knowing this, your machine will be able to exchange bits with www.tldp.org directly.

===The Domain Name System===

The whole network of programs and databases that cooperates to translate hostnames to IP addresses is called ‘DNS’ (Domain Name System). When you see references to a ‘DNS server’, that means what we just called a nameserver. Now I'll explain how the overall system works.

Internet hostnames are composed of parts separated by dots. A ''domain'' is a collection of machines that share a common name suffix. Domains can live inside other domains. For example, the machine www.tldp.org lives in the .tldp.org subdomain of the .org domain.

Each domain is defined by an ''authoritative name server'' that knows the IP addresses of the other machines in the domain. The authoritative (or ‘primary') name server may have backups in case it goes down; if you see references to a ''secondary name server'' or (‘secondary DNS') it's talking about one of those. These secondaries typically refresh their information from their primaries every few hours, so a change made to the hostname-to-IP mapping on the primary will automatically be propagated.

Now here's the important part. The nameservers for a domain do ''not'' have to know the locations of all the machines in other domains (including their own subdomains); they only have to know the location of the nameservers. In our example, the authoritative name server for the .org domain knows the IP address of the nameserver for .tldp.org but ''not'' the address of all the other machines in .tldp.org.

The domains in the DNS system are arranged like a big inverted tree. At the top are the root servers. Everybody knows the IP addresses of the root servers; they're wired into your DNS software. The root servers know the IP addresses of the nameservers for the top-level domains like .com and .org, but not the addresses of machines inside those domains. Each top-level domain server knows where the nameservers for the domains directly beneath it are, and so forth.

DNS is carefully designed so that each machine can get away with the minimum amount of knowledge it needs to have about the shape of the tree, and local changes to subtrees can be made simply by changing one authoritative server's database of name-to-IP-address mappings.

When you query for the IP address of www.tldp.org, what actually happens is this: First, your nameserver asks a root server to tell it where it can find a nameserver for .org. Once it knows that, it then asks the .org server to tell it the IP address of a .tldp.org nameserver. Once it has that, it asks the .tldp.org nameserver to tell it the address of the host www.tldp.org.

Most of the time, your nameserver doesn't actually have to work that hard. Nameservers do a lot of cacheing; when yours resolves a hostname, it keeps the association with the resulting IP address around in memory for a while. This is why, when you surf to a new website, you'll usually only see a message from your browser about &quot;Looking up&quot; the host for the first page you fetch. Eventually the name-to-address mapping expires and your DNS has to re-query — this is important so you don't have invalid information hanging around forever when a hostname changes addresses. Your cached IP address for a site is also thrown out if the host is unreachable.

===Packets and routers===

What the browser wants to do is send a command to the Web server on www.tldp.org that looks like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
GET /LDP/HOWTO/Fundamentals.html HTTP/1.0
&lt;/pre&gt;

Here's how that happens. The command is made into a ''packet'', a block of bits like a telegram that is wrapped with three important things; the ''source address'' (the IP address of your machine), the ''destination address'' (152.19.254.81), and a ''service number'' or ''port number'' (80, in this case) that indicates that it's a World Wide Web request.

Your machine then ships the packet down the wire (your connection to your ISP, or local network) until it gets to a specialized machine called a ''router''. The router has a map of the Internet in its memory — not always a complete one, but one that completely describes your network neighborhood and knows how to get to the routers for other neighborhoods on the Internet.

Your packet may pass through several routers on the way to its destination. Routers are smart. They watch how long it takes for other routers to acknowledge having received a packet. They also use that information to direct traffic over fast links. They use it to notice when another router (or a cable) have dropped off the network, and compensate if possible by finding another route.

There's an urban legend that the Internet was designed to survive nuclear war. This is not true, but the Internet's design is extremely good at getting reliable performance out of flaky hardware in an uncertain world. This is directly due to the fact that its intelligence is distributed through thousands of routers rather than concentrated in a few massive and vulnerable switches (like the phone network). This means that failures tend to be well localized and the network can route around them.

Once your packet gets to its destination machine, that machine uses the service number to feed the packet to the web server. The web server can tell where to reply to by looking at the command packet's source IP address. When the web server returns this document, it will be broken up into a number of packets. The size of the packets will vary according to the transmission media in the network and the type of service.

===TCP and IP===

To understand how multiple-packet transmissions are handled, you need to know that the Internet actually uses two protocols, stacked one on top of the other.

The lower level, ''IP'' (Internet Protocol), is responsible for labeling individual packets with the source address and destination address of two computers exchanging information over a network. For example, when you access http://www.tldp.org, the packets you send will have your computer's IP address, such as 192.168.1.101, and the IP address of the www.tldp.org computer, 152.2.210.81. These addresses work in much the same way that your home address works when someone sends you a letter. The post office can read the address and determine where you are and how best to route the letter to you, much like a router does for Internet traffic.

The upper level, ''TCP'' (Transmission Control Protocol), gives you reliability. When two machines negotiate a TCP connection (which they do using IP), the receiver knows to send acknowledgements of the packets it sees back to the sender. If the sender doesn't see an acknowledgement for a packet within some timeout period, it resends that packet. Furthermore, the sender gives each TCP packet a sequence number, which the receiver can use to reassemble packets in case they show up out of order. (This can easily happen if network links go up or down during a connection.)

TCP/IP packets also contain a checksum to enable detection of data corrupted by bad links. (The checksum is computed from the rest of the packet in such a way that if either the rest of the packet or the checksum is corrupted, redoing the computation and comparing is very likely to indicate an error.) So, from the point of view of anyone using TCP/IP and nameservers, it looks like a reliable way to pass streams of bytes between hostname/service-number pairs. People who write network protocols almost never have to think about all the packetizing, packet reassembly, error checking, checksumming, and retransmission that goes on below that level.

===HTTP, an application protocol===

Now let's get back to our example. Web browsers and servers speak an ''application protocol'' that runs on top of TCP/IP, using it simply as a way to pass strings of bytes back and forth. This protocol is called ''HTTP'' (Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol) and we've already seen one command in it — the GET shown above.

When the GET command goes to www.tldp.org's webserver with service number 80, it will be dispatched to a ''server daemon'' listening on port 80. Most Internet services are implemented by server daemons that do nothing but wait on ports, watching for and executing incoming commands.

If the design of the Internet has one overall rule, it's that all the parts should be as simple and human-accessible as possible. HTTP, and its relatives (like the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, ''SMTP'', that is used to move electronic mail between hosts) tend to use simple printable-text commands that end with a carriage-return/line feed.

This is marginally inefficient; in some circumstances you could get more speed by using a tightly-coded binary protocol. But experience has shown that the benefits of having commands be easy for human beings to describe and understand outweigh any marginal gain in efficiency that you might get at the cost of making things tricky and opaque.

Therefore, what the server daemon ships back to you via TCP/IP is also text. The beginning of the response will look something like this (a few headers have been suppressed):

&lt;pre&gt;
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Sat, 10 Oct 1998 18:43:35 GMT
Server: Apache/1.2.6 Red Hat
Last-Modified: Thu, 27 Aug 1998 17:55:15 GMT
Content-Length: 2982
Content-Type: text/html
&lt;/pre&gt;

These headers will be followed by a blank line and the text of the web page (after which the connection is dropped). Your browser just displays that page. The headers tell it how (in particular, the Content-Type header tells it the returned data is really HTML).

Thanks for experimenting with Wikibooks. Your test worked, and has now been removed. Please use [[Wikibooks:Sandbox]] for any other tests you want to do, since testing material in modules will normally be removed quickly. Please see the [[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome page]] if you would like to learn more about contributing to our project. Thanks.

We had one author put up an item here that while accurate, was misplaced. Just as a reminder: this page is for Cho Chang's relationships, from Cho Chang's point of view. While it is important that Harry stopped caring about Cho in HBP because he was rather stuck on Ginny, that is Harry's and Ginny's story and has little to do with Cho.

''The following is a list of words that are used commonly by those who are participating with the development of the [[w:Scratch (programming language)|Scratch programming language]], and whose meaning may not be clearly understood by those new to programming in Scratch.  If there are additional words or terms that are used by the Scratch community that you may not understand, please simply add that word to this list without a definition.  If you are an &quot;old hand&quot; to the Scratch community, help us out as well by adding words that may be confusing.''

;actor:See '''sprite'''

;block:An individual command or instruction used within a script.

;project:Sometimes known as a &quot;program&quot;.  A project is a collection of scripts, sprites, sounds, backgrounds, and other images that are saved in a single file and used together.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Alfie Kohn=

==Overview==
===The theorist===
Alfie Kohn is a contemporary academic who studies and writes about issues of education, parenting, and human behavior. He has published many books on these topics including Punished by Rewards (1993), No Contest (1986), and The Homework Myth (2006). Alfie Kohn lectures at Universities and groups with related interests and has been a guest on The Today Show and Oprah. He lives in the Boston area with his wife and two children. 

===The theories of Alfie Kohn===
Because of the extensive list of published articles and books by Kohn, one could discuss his specific theories on a wide variety of topics. There is, however, an overarching theme throughout much of Kohn’s work. Kohn is very critical of the use of competition or any external factor as a motivator, whether that is in the home, the classroom, or the workplace. He believes that societies based on these extrinsic motives will inevitably be inefficient. Building on this critical view of competition, Kohn questions the effectiveness of hierarchical structures because they rely on the assumption that people will be competitive and want to move up the ladder and these structures make positions of authority unnaturally scarce. In the workplace, this overarching idea manifests itself in Kohn’s belief that workers should be given more autonomy over their own work. In the family, Kohn’s fundamental beliefs are visible as he argues that parent should utilize a “cooperative, loving, guiding form of parenting which places children on more equal footing with parents” (Wikipedia, 2007). These fundamental beliefs are also clear in his many discussions of education. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The ideal classroom, according to Alfie Kohn, is one in which curiosity and cooperation are emphasized above all else. This is true throughout Kohn’s discussions on standards, standardized testing, homework, and classroom management. Kohn believes that the students’ curiosity should govern what is taught inside the classroom; therefore, if standards are necessary at all, they should be kept very general. Because of this belief, Kohn is critical of standardized testing. This sort of testing is extrinsic to real learning and also enforces a strict curriculum that is not flexible to students’ interests and needs. Again, going back to Kohn’s focus on curiosity and intrinsic rewards of education, Kohn feels that most homework serves to undermine these two goals as opposed to reinforcing them. Kohn’s most recent book deals with this topic extensively. In addition to these ideas about curriculum, Kohn has made his thoughts clear on classroom management. Kohn believes that most traditional methods of classroom management foster extrinsic motivation rather than intrinsic. Because of this, he is a proponent of what could be termed a very “hands off” type of management approach. Kohn believes that if the classroom is run with cooperation in mind, and if the students’ curiosity is being nurtured, than students will act appropriately and neither rewards nor punishments will be necessary. Overall, curiosity and cooperation should govern the classroom.&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;
In addition to understanding some of the basic foci of Kohn’s ideas, it is important to be able to place these ideas into a greater context. For example, one should consider the predecessor of this type of thinking and the time during which Kohn is writing. While there divergences, Kohn’s beliefs are generally aligned with Critical Pedagogy, or the application of Marxist principles to the educational system. There are many other radical educational theorists, many of which have preceded Kohn, who would concur with many of his thoughts. Paulo Freire, Henry Giroux, and Michael Apple are just a few who come to mind and have surely influenced Alfie Kohn. In addition to this piece of context, it is important to note that Alfie Kohn has been writing and publishing during a time when there is a strong movement to standardize education and create more accountability within the system. This has clearly influenced the focus of much of Kohn’s writing and is important to keep in mind when considering his contributions to the field of education.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

==Implementation==
===Practical ways to implement in a classroom===
In order to implement the ways of Alfie Kohn in the classroom, teachers need to allow their students to explore the topics which interest them. Kohn insists that teaching to the standards or teaching to the test are not effective ways to help students learn. Instead, students “should be able to think and write and explore without worrying about how good they are” (Kohn, 2004, p. 37). Kohn believes that there is an overemphasis on achievement rather than on the process of learning. According to Kohn, students should not be working towards success or charting their progress on the wall. Alternatively, “students should be immersed in learning” (Kohn, 2004, p. 37). He does not support the idea of strict standards to ensure that all students are learning the same thing at the same time because not all students learn at the same pace, and “research has demonstrated the importance of making sure students are actively involved in their own learning, invited to play a role in formulating questions, creating projects, and so on” (Kohn, 2004, p. 48). Standards and alignment do not take into account the fact that students are different and have different interests. Kohn encourages teachers to help students to pursue their own interests. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Kohn also discourages the use of positive reinforcement, particularly the repetition of trite phrases like “good job.” As he explains, positive reinforcement may work for a while, “but it’s very different from working with kids – for example, by engaging them in a conversation about what makes a classroom (or family) function smoothly, or how other people are affected by what we have done – or failed to do” (Kohn, 2004, p. 107). He says that positive reinforcement does encourage students, but it only encourages them to seek out more positive reinforcement. After a student receives praise for an action, the point is no longer to repeat the action. Now, “the point is to get the goody” (Kohn, 2004, p. 109). Kohn encourages teachers to avoid positive reinforcement and instead to engage in discussion with the students about their actions.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
===How to Adapt It for Elementary School===
There are several practical ways to implement the ideas of Kohn in the classroom at the elementary school. The teachers should avoid doing their favorite units of study, and they should adjust their units of study to fit their students. Although the teacher may have developed an excellent unit on dinosaurs and a dinosaur unit may be in the standards and on the test, if the students do not want to learn about dinosaurs, then they will not benefit from the study as much as they would had the unit been created to fit their interests. A more individualized learning plan will work better for the students. One student may want to do a project on dinosaurs, and the next student may be interested in a project on bears. A more successful classroom will have students learning about their personal interests.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In addition, the teacher should resist the urge to constantly provide positive reinforcement for his or her students. The teacher should meet with students individually to discuss their behavior, their successes, and their weaknesses. If a student understands the thinking behind a positive or negative behavior, then the student is more likely to act accordingly without needing the reassurance of praise.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
===How to Adapt It for Middle School and High School===
One of the easiest ways to allow students to pursue their own individual interests in middle school and high school is through research. Research can be done in almost any content area. The students can research a virus that interests them in science or a culture that interests them in social studies. Just as a teacher creates the unit for the students in elementary school, the students can create their own units in high school. The teacher can guide his or her students through the research process, and by picking their own topics, the students will be immersed in the learning.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Again, teachers at the secondary level should also avoid using positive reinforcement with their students. They can offer their students more specific feedback that is not as general as “excellent work!” Teachers should make an effort to communicate with their students and discuss both positive and negative behavior with their students. This will help the students reflect on their own behavior and performance in a way that is more meaningful than if they just seek out the teacher’s praise. The students should learn to be responsible for their own behavior whether or not it is recognized or rewarded by somebody else.&lt;br&gt;

==Professional Critique==
===Kohn’s Place in Classroom Management Theory History===
&lt;br&gt;
While many early classroom management theorists, like Redl and Wattenburg, Dreikurs, and Kounin, focused on the psychology behind misbehavior and how to control it, and many later 20th century theorists like Ginott, Canter, Jones, and Albert, looked at a mixture of reward, punishment, and environment, to create a certain controlled classroom setting, Alfie Kohn flies in the face of all of them with his theory of moving beyond discipline.  There is much more to say about theorists who have or would have disagreed with Kohn than those who would agree.  The same seems to apply for parents and fellow educators.  However, like any theory, Kohn challenges people’s thinking leading to growth whether one agrees or disagrees with part or all of his ideas.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Kohn’s ideas, published mostly from the 1990’s on, seem very disconnected from earlier theories except that they provided a foundation for him to react against.  As is summarized by Charles (1999), Kohn rejects all systems of reward and punishment in favor of community and student decision-making, saying that all systems of discipline assume students are troublemakers, learning occurs in quiet controlled places, and the teacher’s role “is to make students obedient, compliant, and above all quiet”(p. 229).  With Kohn’s dramatic stance on dropping all previous discipline systems, it’s no wonder that Fried (1998) comments, “I SUSPECT that over the years Alfie Kohn has made a lot of people angry”(p. 264).&lt;br&gt;
===Coloroso, a Theorist Who Aligns with Kohn===
There are many critical or radical theorists, modern and otherwise, who would agree with Kohn.  Barbara Coloroso is one contemporary of Kohn's who shares many of his principles.  Like Kohn, Coloroso gives students a lot of credit.  Rather than approaching students as creatures capable of great destruction, needing to be controlled, she, according to Charles (1999), aims to treat students with respect and empower them with their own inner discipline (p.217).  She seems to view the teacher’s role as mentor and guide. This is a more authoritarian role than the title Kohn might give the teacher as a mere facilitator.  Unlike Kohn, Coloroso also still has faith in “natural and reasonable” consequences and rewards.  Charles (1999) states her principals as, “Natural consequences are events that happen naturally in the real world… [And] reasonable consequences are events imposed by the teacher that are related to a violation of rules” (p. 219).  An example of the former would be receiving negative feedback from peers when you didn’t work cooperatively in a group and the latter, apologizing to a classmate you hurt or offended in some way. &lt;br&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;
Coloroso’s and Kohn’s greatest area of agreement is their faith in students’ capability to police themselves.  However, they still disagree on how to encourage this and how directly the teacher should be involved.  Kohn would say that challenging curriculum and classroom community are all that is necessary where Coloroso would call for teacher help in producing good student decision-making and would keep a set of rules and consequences at hand. &lt;br&gt;

===A Summary of Unsupportive Voices===
It does not take too much imagination to guess what kind of feedback Kohn receives for his theories.  Many people believe that without discipline policies there is chaos.  Especially when Kohn’s classroom management theory is isolated from its placement in his total reform of the public education system, it appears radical and a bit preposterous.  Rochester (1998) sums up many concerns with Kohn’s ideas in an article, “What’s It All About, Alfie? A parent/educator’s response to Alfie 
Kohn.”  As Rochester (1998) voices, “In my judgment, the poor quality of the average student admitted to our colleges and universities today can be traced mainly to the trends of the past two decades in K-12 education, particularly to the emergence of the self-indulgent, nonjudgmental, nonhierarchical classroom that —in fusing a radical libertarianism with a radical egalitarianism — has resulted in the near total collapse of standards” (p. 168).  Kohn encourages this trend by giving students the full responsibility of disciplining, or not disciplining, themselves and having the teacher in a non-authoritative position as producer of riveting material that will seduce the students into functioning well in their tight knit classroom community.  
Rochester is also arguing against the amount of voice the student has in Kohn’s model of classroom meetings, determining many decisions about the class.  In a different conversation, Kohn presents a rebuttal to this issue as O’Neil (1999) captures him saying, “It’s hard to ask kids how we might solve a problem together because then we no longer have unilateral control over them. And that is frightening. It carries with it a whiff of something utterly unfamiliar and terrifying to most Americans: democracy” (p. 21).  As seems to be usual, Kohn is a witty instigator.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
===Closing and Critical Thoughts===
&lt;br&gt;Alfie Kohn provides much fodder for thought about previous assumptions on discipline and classroom management.  He has alternatives to a public school system of teacher authority and, what some would call, student subjugation that has not been totally successful.  However, his prescription raises some challenges for the inexperienced teacher, if not teachers of any level.  While a positive classroom environment and venues for student input and feedback are crucial, abolishing all traditional systems of rules and consequences seems brusque and frankly unsafe for the new teacher.  Likewise, involving student reflection on consequences for their misbehavior sounds very reasonable but trusting all students’ ability to self-monitor seems risky.  Kohn’s ideas could be crafted to work well for 80% of students but I wonder what his answer is to the students with chronic behavior problems stemming from emotional or physical triggers?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Alfie Kohn’s ideas about student respect and input are inspiring. I appreciate his willingness to not only test the waters of the traditional classroom management models but completely break them down and start fresh.  He gives many ideas from which to glean and perhaps integrate with other models in order to create a personalized and effective classroom management plan.

==Lingering Questions==
&lt;br&gt;
What does Alfie Kohn think of positive reinforcement? What does Alfie Kohn think of negative reinforcement? &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Apply Alfie Kohn's thoughts about the ideal classroom to society. What would an ideal society look like to Kohn?

      <text xml:space="preserve">Welcome to the Learning Talmud Wikibook.

===Aim of the Book===
The Learning Talmud Wikibook is a heavily annotated version of the Babylonian Talmud, aimed at increasing readers' ability to read the text itself.  Rather than presenting a direct or transcluded translation of the text (ala Wikisource's [[:w:Wikisource:Mishnah/Seder_Zeraim/Tractate_Berakhot|Mishnah Tractate Berakhot]]), the Learning Talmud Wikibook will present the Talmud text as a series of hyper-linked terms, using footnotes to translate entire sentences.  This will allow students to build their Aramaic reading skills as well as their ability to interpret the text.

====A Demonstration of the Learning Talmud Wikibook Methodology====

Here is a sentence from Bava Batra 58a, presented in the textbook's schema.  Some readers may find this example familiar, as it is used in the first lesson of David Marcus' ''A Manual of Babylonian Jewish Aramaic''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Contextual Outline==
&lt;small&gt;Text excerpt is from [http://www.boardofstudies.nsw.edu.au/syllabus_hsc/pdf_doc/physics_stg6_syl_03.pdf Physics Stage 6 Syllabus] &lt;/small&gt;

Modern industrialised society is geared to using electricity. Electricity has characteristics that have made it uniquely appropriate for powering a highly technological society. There are many energy sources that can be readily converted into electricity. In Australia, most power plants burn a fuel, such as coal, or use the energy of falling water to generate electricity on a large scale. Electricity is also relatively easy to distribute. Electricity authorities use high-voltage transmission lines and transformers to distribute electricity to homes and industries around each state. Voltages can be as high as 5 x 105 volts from power stations but by the time this reaches homes, the electricity has been transformed to 240 volts. While it is relatively economical to generate electric power at a steady rate, there are both financial and environmental issues that should be considered when assessing the long-term impact of supplying commercial and household power.
The design of a motor for an electrical appliance requires consideration of whether it will run at a set speed, how much power it must supply, whether it will be powered by AC (alternating current) or DC (direct current) and what reliability is required. The essentials of an electric motor are the supply of electrical energy to a coil in a magnetic field causing it to rotate.The generation of electrical power requires relative motion between a magnetic field and a conductor. In a generator, mechanical energy is converted into electrical energy while the opposite occurs in an electric motor. The electricity produced by most generators is in the form of alternating current. In general AC generators, motors and other electrical equipment are simpler, cheaper and more reliable than their DC counterparts. AC electricity can be easily transformed into higher or lower voltages making it more versatile than DC
electricity. This module increases students’ understanding of the applications and uses of physics and the implications of physics for society and the environment.

      <comment>/* Applications of eddy currents */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==

==Applications of eddy currents==

===Induction cooktops===
An induction cooktop has a coil wound on ferromagnetic material under it. A high frequency alternating current in this coil produces a rapidly changing magnetic field. Placing a magnetic-based leads to a change in magnetic flux, because the magnetic field B varies. From Faraday's Law, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}= \frac{\Delta\phi}{\Delta t},&lt;/math&gt;
an emf (electromagnetic field) is induced. From Lenz's Law, eddy currents flow in the pan. The resistance in the pan to the oscillating AC current results in heat being produced directly in the base of the pan. Unlike gas cooking, the ceramic cooktop is not heated directly. This makes induction cookers much more energy efficient than traditional cookers.

The direction of the eddy current is determined by Lenz's Law. In addition to efficiency, other benefits include safety (because the cooktop is not heated directly) and speed of cooking.

===Electromagnetic braking===
When a rotating metal disc passes through  a magnetic field, there is a change in magnetic flux. From Faraday's Law, an emf is induced. From Lenz's Law, this induces eddy currents whose magnetic field interacts with the external magnetic field in a way that causes in magnetic flux in the disk. That is, the currents inside the magnetic field experience a force that acts in the opposite direction to the motion of the disc. Therefore, the speed of the disc's motion slows down.

One benefit of electromagnetic  braking is that the braking is smooth. This is because the strength of the eddy currents is proportional to the speed of the disc. This means as the disc slows, eddy currents reduce. There is no physical contact between the disc and brake. Another benefit is that it is more effiecient at high speeds because the opposing magnetic forces is larger at higher speeds. These useful properties of electromagnetic brakes serve them well in many applications, such as amusement park ride brakes and brakes in some types of trains.

If I have made an erroneous edit on a math page, correct it! If there is still a problem drop me a line here, thanks ;).

P.S. I will reply here unless otherwise specified, so remember to watch this page.

== Calculus ==

I looked over your edits, the trig proof looks fine to me, some skipped steps.  Other than that, what I've seen looks fine.

There seems to be two ways the book can be written:

1)  A more intuitive look and a fact depiction of the rules of it.

2)  A very rigorous and accurate approach.

In terms of classes, there's usually a normal calculus class that does 1, and a Real Analysis (or sometimes proofs class) class that does 2.

What sort of book are you looking to try to construct?

Other than that, I'll see what I can do from what you leave on the talk pages.

[[User:Fephisto|Fephisto]] 03:41, 19 June 2007 (UTC)

Is 1.65 a valid answer :) ? I would really like to create a rigorous and accurate approach that does not leave anyone stranded or confused. Rigorous approaches that do not convey the essence of the topic are fairly useless to the prospective student.--[[User:Cronholm144|Cronholm]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Cronholm144|144]]&lt;/sup&gt; 08:27, 19 June 2007 (UTC)

== Hidden Divs ==

If you get tired of writing out all those divs, you could use the {{tlx|hidden}} template instead. That should make alot of your work easier. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 00:17, 20 June 2007 (UTC)

&lt;s&gt;What would that do? I am not familiar with that template&lt;/s&gt;(or any template really, it is the one area of the wiki software that I avoid scrupulously). Anyway, I am copying an pasting and it isn't that bad at all.--[[User:Cronholm144|Cronholm]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Cronholm144|144]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:22, 20 June 2007 (UTC)

== [[Wikibooks:Featured books/Nominations#Calculus]] ==

I just wanted to let you know that the [[Calculus]] book has been nominated for featured status. The vote is generally going well so far (although it could always use more support), but there are criticisms about the book as well. Some of these comments could serve as a good starting point for you, as you look for more things to improve in this book. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 01:24, 21 June 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Tener que''' in Spanish grammar is used to convey the idea of ''having to do something''. 

It is relatively simple to form and these are the following steps to take:

1) '''Take the appropriate form of tener:'''

To do this you need to decide which tense you are going to use: the present tense(for actions that one need to do now), the imperfect (for a past, continuous action), the perfect tense (for past, complete actions) and the future.

For learning purposes it is useful to look at the present tense:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

!Person
|yo
|tú
|él
|nosotros
|vosotros
|ellos
|-
|Verb
|tengo
|tienes
|tiene
|tenemos
|tenéis
|tienen
|}

2)To all of these verbs you add ''que'' to get the desired effect. 

3)Moreover, for other tenses, you simply use the appropriate form of ''tener'' and again add ''que''.

* juice of two [[cookbook:orange|oranges]]
* ¼ C chopped [[cookbook:almond|almonds]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]]. [[cookbook:cinnamon|cinnamon]]
* 1 tsp. [[cookbook:ginger|ginger]], preferably freshly grated
* 2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|T]] [[cookbook:honey|honey]]
* 2 T [[cookbook:Matsoh Meal|matsoh meal]]

== Procedure ==
# Plump dried fruit in juice.
# Mash reconstituted fruit with almond and spices to get a mortar-like texture.
# Adjust texture with matsoh meal and if needed, sweeten with honey.
# Serve as part of the [[Cookbook:Seder|Seder]]. The north west African tradition uses bitter greens such as endive rather than horseradish with the Charoseth.

'''Iraqi Charoset''' is a dried fruit and nut based paste served during the Jewish celebration of Passover by Jews from Iraq.

==Ingredients==
* 500 ml. Iraqi [[cookbook:date|date]]s, chopped and seeded
* water
* salt
* 125 ml. chopped [[cookbook:walnut|walnut]]s or [[cookbook:pistachio|pistachio]]s

== Procedure ==
# Boil dates in lightly salted water stirring frequently until it is a thick paste.
# Mix in finely chopped nuts.
# A traditional variant is to strain the pulp out of the paste producing a honey-like date syrup.  This procedure uses considerably more dates and can take several days to produce sufficient syrup.

==Epidemiology==
*SCC of unknown primary represents 3-5% of cancers of head and neck.

==Natural History==
*Likely a result from subclinical primary malignancy in upper aerodigestive tract.
*Primary identified in approximately 40% of cases (80% of identified primary cancers are from either tonsil or base of tongue).
*Most commonly affect jugulodigastric and upper jugular nodes.

==Diagnostic Workup==
*''Clinical examination''
**Complete head and neck exam.
**Examination of the skin of the head and neck region.
*''CT or MRI''
**Imaging should extend from base of skull to thoracic inlet.
*''Panendoscopy with directed biopsies''
**Endoscopic evaluation should include direct laryngoscopy and nasopharynx survey.
**For Level II node, directed biopsies should include base of tongue, nasopharynx, pyriform sinus, tonsil.
*''Tonsillectomy ''
**Tonsillectomy improves yield over focally directed biopsy.
**Question ipsilateral vs bilateral tonsillectomy is controversial.
**'''Johns Hopkins, 1998'''  PMID 9818813 -- McQuone S &quot;Occult tonsillar carcinoma in the unknown primary.&quot;  Laryngoscope. 1998 Nov;108(11 Pt 1):1605-10.
*''PET''
**NCCN recommends only if other workup does not identify the primary.
**After FNA of the neck mass, can increase diagnostic yield by 20-30%
**However, after negative PET, pan-endoscopy with directed biopsies can detect primary in 10-20% cases. 
**Therefore, combination of PET and pan-endoscopy with directed biopsies is probably best, with a yield of almost 50%
**'''UT San Antonio, 2008''' PMID 17657782 -- Miller FR, &quot;Management of the unknown primary carcinoma: long-term follow-up on a negative PET scan and negative panendoscopy.&quot; Head Neck. 2008 Jan;30(1):28-34.
**'''Emory Review, 2004''' PMID 15517576 -- Rusthoven KE &quot;The role of fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography in cervical lymph node metastases from an unknown primary tumor.&quot;  Cancer. 2004 Dec 1;101(11):2641-9.
***PET detected previously unidentified primary in 24.5% of patients
*''Level IV/V LNs''
**Also perform bronchoscopy, esophagoscopy and CT of chest/abdomen/pelvis

==Staging==
*''Nodes'' (same as for most H&amp;N sites){{:Radiation Oncology/Head &amp; Neck/Node staging}}

*''Stage Grouping''
**Stage III - N1
**Stage IVA - N2
**Stage IVB - N3
**Stage IVC - M1

==Treatment Overview==
'''Stage'''
*N1 disease can be treated with neck dissection alone.
*Patients w/ an excisional biospy should be tx'd w/ definitive xrt.
*N2A-C and N3 disease can be treated with definitive xrt alone.
**Planned neck dissection following xrt if persistent disease 
**Some institutions consider planned neck dissection standard after definitive xrt for N2 disease


'''''University of Florida algorithm''' (in Gunderson, 2nd ed, 2007)
*cN1: neck dissection
**If pN1, no ECE - observe
**If pN2+ or ECE - adjuvant RT
**If excisional biopsy done - definitive RT
*cN2: 
**If early N2: definitive RT
**If advanced N2-3: definitive chemo-RT
**For both, CT scan 1 month after RT, if residual disease, adjuvant neck dissection


'''Volume'''
*Classically, RT fields would include bilateral neck nodes and mucosal sites of putative origin (nasopharynx, oropharynx, hypopharynx, larynx)
*Modified mucosal volume may include only nasopharynx and oropharynx, since University of Florida data shows that hypopharynx and larynx primaries are rare. Nevertheless, for isolated Level III-IV LN, these should probably still be covered
*Modified neck volume may include ipsilateral Level Ib-V + RP nodes and contralateral low Level II-V lymph nodes. 
*Treatment of bilateral neck + mucosal sites of risk appears to improve rate of neck control and even overall survival in some series as compared to unilateral neck irradiation.  This issue is considered somewhat controversial and must be weighed against the added toxicity of comprehensive irradiation

==Surgery Alone==
*'''Mayo Clinic; 1992''' PMID 1618667 -- &quot;Cervical nodal metastasis of squamous cell carcinoma of unknown origin: indications for withholding radiation therapy.&quot; (Coster JR, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1992;23(4):743-9.)
**Retrospective. 24 patients, unknown primary, unilateral neck disease, curative resection by neck dissection or excisional biopsy. N1 (n=14), N2a (n=6), N2b (n=3), N3 (n=1). ECE (n=8). Median F/U alive patients 8.5 years
**Outcome: Primary developed in 4%. Neck recurrence 25%, median TTF 3 months. In 5/6 patients with recurrence ECE+. Both N1 patients who recurred had ECE. 5-year CSS 74%, OS 66%
**Conclusion: In pN1 and no ECE, surgery alone sufficient. If pN2+ or ECE, consider adjuvant RT

==Definitive Radiation==
*'''Gainesville, 2001''' (1964-97) PMID 11316546 -- Erkal HS et al.  &quot;Squamous cell carcinomas metastatic to cervical lymph nodes from an unknown head-and-neck mucosal site treated with radiation therapy alone or in combination with neck dissection.&quot;  Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2001 May 1;50(1):55-63.
**126 pts w/ SCC of cervical neck from unknown primary.  &gt;90% tx'd w/ comprehensive nodal/mucosal site irradiation.
**5yr neck control 78% (10% persistent dz, 12% nodal failure.
**5yr OS 47%
**Factors that affected OS on multi-variate analysis were ECE, N stage, RT dose to mucosal sites.

*'''Danish, 2000''' (1975-95) PMID 10799723 -- Grau C et al.  &quot;Cervical lymph node metastases from unknown primary tumours. Results from a national survey by the Danish Society for Head and Neck Oncology.&quot;  Radiother Oncol. 2000 May;55(2):121-9.
**277 pts tx'd radically for unknown primary of H&amp;N.  81% tx'd with comprehensive fields (b/l neck, nasopharynx, hypopharynx, oropharynx and larynx).
**5yr OS 37%
**Mucosal primary emergence rate 16% (50% of emerging primaries in lung or esophagus).
**Comprehensive xrt fields appeared to decrease neck relapse and development of distant mets.  Comprehensive xrt fields also improved median overall survival.

===Volume===
'''''Larynx/Hypopharynx Sparing'''''
*'''University of Florida; 2005''' (1997-2002) PMID 16199981 -- &quot;Larynx-sparing radiotherapy for squamous cell carcinoma from an unknown head and neck primary site.&quot; (Barker CA, Am J Clin Oncol. 2005 Oct;28(5):445-8.)
**Retrospective. 17 patients, curative intent. RT 64.8/36 parallel opposed fields to nasopharynx, oropharynx, and upper cervical LN. Matched anterior neck field at thyroid notch 50/25. Majority had &gt;2 year follow-up
**Outcome: No SCC in H&amp;N mucosa. 1/17 (6%) persistent nodal disease, 1/17 (6%) recurrent nodal disease. No distant mets. 5-year CSS 88%, 5-year OS 82%
**Conclusion: Larynx-sparing Rt appears effective, and likely reduces toxicity


'''''Unilateral vs Bilateral Neck'''''
*'''Princess Margaret; 1995''' (1970-86) PMID 7480823 -- Weir L et al.  &quot;Radiation treatment of cervical lymph node metastases from an unknown primary: an analysis of outcome by treatment volume and other prognostic factors.&quot;  Radiother Oncol. 1995 Jun;35(3):206-11.
**144 pts tx'd for unknown primary H&amp;N CA.  85 tx'd to involved nodes; 59 tx'd to both nodes and potential primary sites.
**5yr OS 41%
**Nodal control 51% (94% neck failures failed within initial tx volume).
**Trend towards improved survival for treatment of both potential primary and nodes.

*'''Loyola; 1997''' PMID 9128954 -- Reddy SP et al.  &quot;Metastatic carcinoma in the cervical lymph nodes from an unknown primary site: results of bilateral neck plus mucosal irradiation vs. ipsilateral neck irradiation.&quot;  Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1997 Mar 1;37(4):797-802.
**36 pts irradiated to b/l neck + mucosal sites, 16 pts tx'd to unilateral nodes (electrons).
**Contralateral nodal failure 44% (unilateral xrt) vs 14% (bilateral xrt)
**Mucosal primary emergence rate 44% (unilateral xrt) vs 8% (bilateral xrt)
**No difference in 5yr OS.

===IMRT===
*'''Memorial Sloan Kettering; 2008''' (2000-2005) PMID 17980501 -- &quot;Intensity-modulated radiotherapy for head and neck cancer of unknown primary: toxicity and preliminary efficacy.&quot; (Klem ML, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2008 Mar 15;70(4):1100-7. Epub 2007 Nov 5.)
**Retrospective. 21 patients treated with IMRT (5 definitive, 16 postoperative). Target volume bilateral neck and mucosal surface. Median dose 66 Gy. Median F/U 2.0 years
**Outcome: 2-year PFS 90%, OS 85%
**Toxicity: PEG required in 72% combined chemo-RT and 43% IMRT alone. Acute Grade 1 57%, Grade 2 43%. Three esophageal strictures
**Conclusion: Acceptable toxicity and encouraging efficacy

Computers take numerous physical forms. Early electronic computers were the size of a large room, consuming as much power as several hundred modern personal computers. &lt;ref&gt;In 1946, [[w:ENIAC|ENIAC]] consumed an estimated 174 kW. By comparison, a typical personal computer may use around 400 W; over four hundred times less. {{Ref harvard|kempf1961|Kempf 1961|a}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, computers can be made small enough to fit into a [[w:Watch|wrist watch]] and be powered from a [[w:watch battery|watch battery]].

Society has come to recognize [[w:personal computer|personal computer]]s and their portable equivalent, the [[w:laptop computer|laptop computer]], as icons of the [[w:information age|information age]]; they are what most people think of as &quot;a computer&quot;. However, the most common form of computer in use today is by far the [[w:embedded computer|embedded computer]]. Embedded computers are small, simple devices that are often used to control other devices&amp;mdash;for example, they may be found in machines ranging from [[w:fighter aircraft|fighter aircraft]] to [[w:industrial robot|industrial robot]]s, [[w:digital camera|digital camera]]s, and even [[w:toy|children's toys]].

The ability to store and execute programs makes computers extremely versatile and distinguishes them from [[w:calculator|calculator]]s. The [[w:Church–Turing thesis|Church–Turing thesis]] is a mathematical statement of this versatility: Any computer with a certain minimum capability is, in principle, capable of performing the same tasks that any other computer can perform. Therefore, computers with capability and complexity ranging from that of a [[w:personal digital assistant|personal digital assistant]] to a [[w:supercomputer|supercomputer]] are all able to perform the same computational tasks as long as time and storage capacity are not considerations.

*[[User:Millosh/Internet and Programming for Linguists/The Big Picture/Computer/History of computing|History of computing]]

&lt;!--
==Computer components==
{{main|Computer hardware}}
A minimal setup of a typical contemporary computer would be:
*[[Computer case]] with power supply (usually sold together)
*[[Motherboard]]
*[[cpu|Processor]] with fan (usually sold together)
*At least one [[computer memory|memory card]]
*[[Mass storage]]
*[[computer keyboard|Keyboard]] and [[computer mouse|mouse]] for input
*[[Monitor]] for output
The motherboard connects everything together. The graphics card and processor are mounted directly onto the motherboard (the processor in a [[cpu socket|socket]]) and the graphics card in an [[expansion slot]]). The mass storage is connected to it with cables. Same for keyboard and mouse, except that they are external and conenct to the [[back plate]]. The monitor is also connected to the back plate, except not (usually) directly to the motherboard, but to a connector in the graphics card.
:The mass storage can be:
:*[[Hard disk]]
:*[[Floppy drive]] of [[zip drive]] (both with media)
:*[[Optical drive]] ([[CD]] or [[DVD]])
:The [[operating system]] (eg [[Linux]] of [[msWindows]]) can be located on either of these, but typically it's on one of the hard disks. A [[live cd]] is also possible, but very slow and used for either installation of the OS or problem solving.

On top of these, a typical computer also has:
*[[Sound card]]
*[[Speaker]]s
*[[Network card]]
*[[Modem]] and possibly [[router]]
*[[Printer]]
*[[Scanner]]
Common additions are:
*[[Webcam]]
*[[Microphone]]
*[[Headset]]
*[[Card reader]]
*Gaming devices such as a [[joystick]]
Several functions (implemented by [[chipset]]s) can be integrated into the motherboard, such as typically [[USB]] and network, but also graphics and sound. But even if these are present, a separate card can be added if what is available present isn't sufficient.

The graphics and sound card can have a [[break out box]] to keep the analog parts away from the [[electromagnetic radiation]] inside the computer case. For really large amounts of data, a [[tape drive]] can be used or (extra) hard disks can be put together in an external case.

These components can usually be put together with little knowledge, to build a computer. If something shouldn't go somewhere, it usually doesn't fit (this used to not always be the case in the past) and if it ''does'' fit it can usually do little harm.

==Stored program architecture==
{{main|Computer program|Computer programming}}

The defining feature of modern computers which distinguishes them from all other machines is that they can be [[computer programming|programmed]]. That is to say that a list of [[Instruction (computer science)|instructions]] (the [[Computer program|program]]) can be given to the computer and it will store them and carry them out at some time in the future.

In most cases, computer instructions are simple: add one number to another, move some data from one location to another, send a message to some external device, etc. These instructions are read from the computer's [[Computer storage|memory]] and are generally carried out ([[Execution (computers)|executed]]) in the order they were given. However, there are usually specialized instructions to tell the computer to jump ahead or backwards to some other place in the program and to carry on executing from there. These are called &quot;jump&quot; instructions (or [[Branch (computer science)|branches]]). Furthermore, jump instructions may be made to happen [[Conditional statement|conditionally]] so that different sequences of instructions may be used depending on the result of some previous calculation or some external event.  Many computers directly support [[subroutine]]s by providing a type of jump that &quot;remembers&quot; the location it jumped from and another instruction to return to that point.

Program execution might be likened to reading a book. While a person will normally read each word and line in sequence, they may at times jump back to an earlier place in the text or skip sections that are not of interest. Similarly, a computer may sometimes go back and repeat the instructions in some section of the program over and over again until some internal condition is met. This is called the [[control flow|flow of control]] within the program and it is what allows the computer to perform tasks repeatedly without human intervention.

Comparatively, a person using a [[calculator|pocket calculator]] can perform a basic arithmetic operation such as adding two numbers with just a few button presses. But to add together all of the numbers from 1 to 1,000 would take thousands of button presses and a lot of time&amp;mdash;with a near certainty of making a mistake. On the other hand, a computer may be programmed to do this with just a few simple instructions. For example:

         mov      #0,sum     ; set sum to 0
         mov      #1,num     ; set num to 1
 loop:   add      num,sum    ; add num to sum
         add      #1,num     ; add 1 to num
         cmp      num,#1000  ; compare num to 1000
         ble      loop       ; if num &lt;= 1000, go back to 'loop'
         halt                ; end of program. stop running

Once told to run this program, the computer will perform the repetitive addition task without further human intervention. It will almost never make a mistake and a modern PC can complete the task in about a millionth of a second.&lt;ref&gt;This program was designed for the [[PDP-11]] [[minicomputer]] and shows some typical things a computer can do. All the text after the semicolons are [[Comment (computer programming)|comment]]s for the benefit of human readers. These have no significance to the computer and are ignored. {{Ref harvard|digital1972|Digital Equipment Corporation 1972|a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, computers cannot &quot;think&quot; for themselves in the sense that they only solve problems in exactly the way they are programmed to. An intelligent human faced with the above addition task might soon realize that instead of actually adding up all the numbers one can simply use the equation

: &lt;math&gt;1+2+3+...+n = {{n(n+1)} \over 2}&lt;/math&gt;

and arrive at the correct answer (500,500) with little work.  &lt;ref&gt;Attempts are often made to create programs that can overcome this fundamental limitation of computers. Software that mimics learning and adaptation is part of [[artificial intelligence]].&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, a computer programmed to add up the numbers one by one as in the example above would do exactly that without regard to efficiency or alternative solutions.

===Programs===
[[Image:FortranCardPROJ039.agr.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A 1970s [[punched card]] containing one line from a [[FORTRAN]] program. The card reads: &quot;Z(1) = Y + W(1)&quot; and is labelled &quot;PROJ039&quot; for identification purposes.]]

In practical terms, a '''[[computer program]]''' might include anywhere from a dozen instructions to many millions of instructions for something like a [[word processor]] or a [[web browser]]. A typical modern computer can execute billions of instructions every second and nearly never make a mistake over years of operation.

Large computer programs may take teams of [[computer programmer]]s years to write and the probability of the entire program having been written completely in the manner intended is unlikely. Errors in computer programs are called [[Software bug|bugs]]. Sometimes bugs are benign and do not affect the usefulness of the program, in other cases they might cause the program to completely fail ([[Crash (computing)|crash]]), in yet other cases there may be subtle problems.  Sometimes otherwise benign bugs may be used for malicious intent, creating a [[Exploit (computer security)|security exploit]].  Bugs are usually not the fault of the computer. Since computers merely execute the instructions they are given, bugs are nearly always the result of programmer error or an oversight made in the program's design. &lt;ref&gt;It is not universally true that bugs are solely due to programmer oversight. Computer hardware may fail or may itself have a fundamental problem that produces unexpected results in certain situations. For instance, the [[Pentium FDIV bug]] caused some [[Intel]] [[microprocessor]]s in the early 1990s to produce inaccurate results for certain [[floating point]] division operations. This was caused by a flaw in the microprocessor design and resulted in a partial recall of the affected devices.&lt;/ref&gt;

In most computers, individual instructions are stored as [[machine code]] with each instruction being given a unique number (its operation code or [[opcode]] for short). The command to add two numbers together would have one opcode, the command to multiply them would have a different opcode and so on. The simplest computers are able to perform any of a handful of different instructions, the more complex computers have several hundred to choose from&amp;mdash;each with a unique numerical code. Since the computer's memory is able to store numbers, it can also store the instruction codes. This leads to the important fact that entire programs (which are just lists of instructions) can be represented as lists of numbers and can themselves be manipulated inside the computer just as if they were numeric data. The fundamental concept of storing programs in the computer's memory alongside the data they operate on is the crux of the von Neumann, or stored program, architecture. In some cases, a computer might store some or all of its program in memory that is kept separate from the data it operates on. This is called the [[Harvard architecture]] after the [[Harvard Mark I]] computer. Modern von Neumann computers display some traits of the Harvard architecture in their designs, such as in [[CPU cache]]s.

While it is possible to write computer programs as long lists of numbers ([[machine language]]) and this technique was used with many early computers,&lt;ref&gt;Even some later computers were commonly programmed directly in machine code. Some [[minicomputer]]s like the [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[PDP-8]] could be programmed directly from a panel of switches. However, this method was usually used only as part of the [[booting]] process. Most modern computers boot entirely automatically by reading a boot program from some [[non-volatile memory]].&lt;/ref&gt; it is extremely tedious to do so in practice, especially for complicated programs. Instead, each basic instruction can be given a short name that is indicative of its function and easy to remember&amp;mdash;a [[mnemonic]] such as ADD, SUB, MULT or JUMP. These mnemonics are collectively known as a computer's [[assembly language]]. Converting programs written in assembly language into something the computer can actually understand (machine language) is usually done by a computer program called an assembler. Machine languages and the assembly languages that represent them (collectively termed [[low-level programming language]]s) tend to be unique to a particular type of computer. This means that an [[ARM architecture]] computer (such as may be found in a [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]] or a [[Handheld console game|hand-held videogame]]) cannot understand the machine language of an [[Pentium|Intel Pentium]] or the [[Athlon 64|AMD Athlon 64]] computer that might be in a [[Personal computer|PC]].&lt;ref&gt;However, there is sometimes some form of machine language compatibility between different computers. An [[x86-64]] compatible microprocessor like the [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]] [[Athlon 64]] is able to run most of the same programs that an [[Intel Core 2]] microprocessor can, as well as programs designed for earlier microprocessors like the Intel [[Pentium]]s and [[Intel 80486]]. This contrasts with very early commercial computers, which were often one-of-a-kind and totally incompatible with other computers.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though considerably easier than in machine language, writing long programs in assembly language is often difficult and error prone. Therefore, most complicated programs are written in more abstract [[high-level programming language]]s that are able to express the needs of the [[computer programmer]] more conveniently (and thereby help reduce programmer error). High level languages are usually &quot;compiled&quot; into machine language (or sometimes into assembly language and then into machine language) using another computer program called a [[compiler]].&lt;ref&gt;High level languages are also often [[interpreted language|interpreted]] rather than compiled. Interpreted languages are translated into machine code on the fly by another program called an [[interpreter (computing)|interpreter]].&lt;/ref&gt; Since high level languages are more abstract than assembly language, it is possible to use different compilers to translate the same high level language program into the machine language of many different types of computer. This is part of the means by which software like video games may be made available for different computer architectures such as personal computers and various [[video game console]]s.

The task of developing large software systems is an immense intellectual effort.  It has proven, historically, to be very difficult to produce software with an acceptably high reliability, on a predictable schedule and budget.  The academic and professional discipline of [[software engineering]] concentrates specifically on this problem.

===Example===
[[Image:StoplightMexico.jpg|right|thumb|A traffic light showing red.]]
Suppose a computer is being employed to drive a [[traffic light]]. A simple stored program might say:

# Turn off all of the lights
# Turn on the red light
# Wait for sixty seconds
# Turn off the red light
# Turn on the green light
# Wait for sixty seconds
# Turn off the green light
# Turn on the yellow light
# Wait for two seconds
# Turn off the yellow light
# Jump to instruction number (2)

With this set of instructions, the computer would cycle the light continually through red, green, yellow and back to red again until told to stop running the program.

However, suppose there is a simple on/off [[switch]] connected to the computer that is intended be used to make the light flash red while some maintenance operation is being performed. The program might then instruct the computer to:

# Turn off all of the lights
# Turn on the red light
# Wait for sixty seconds
# Turn off the red light
# Turn on the green light
# Wait for sixty seconds
# Turn off the green light
# Turn on the yellow light
# Wait for two seconds
# Turn off the yellow light
# If the maintenance switch is NOT turned on then jump to instruction number 2
# Turn on the red light
# Wait for one second
# Turn off the red light
# Wait for one second
# Jump to instruction number 11

In this manner, the computer is either running the instructions from number (2) to (11) over and over or it's running the instructions from (11) down to (16) over and over, depending on the position of the switch.&lt;ref&gt;Although this is a simple program, it contains a ''[[software bug]]''. If the traffic signal is showing red when someone switches the &quot;flash red&quot; switch, it will cycle through green once more before starting to flash red as instructed. This bug is quite easy to fix by changing the program to repeatedly test the switch throughout each &quot;wait&quot; period&amp;mdash;but writing large programs that have no bugs is exceedingly difficult.&lt;/ref&gt;

==How computers work==
{{main|Central processing unit|Microprocessor}}
A general purpose computer has four main sections: the [[arithmetic and logic unit]] (ALU), the [[control unit]], the [[computer storage|memory]], and the input and output devices (collectively termed I/O). These parts are interconnected by [[computer bus|busses]], often made of groups of [[wire]]s.

The control unit, ALU, registers, and basic I/O (and often other hardware closely linked with these) are collectively known as a [[central processing unit]] (CPU). Early CPUs were comprised of many separate components but since the mid-1970s CPUs have typically been constructed on a single [[integrated circuit]] called a ''[[microprocessor]]''.

===Control unit===
{{main|CPU design|Control unit}}

The control unit (often called a control system or central controller) directs the various components of a computer. It reads and interprets (decodes) instructions in the program one by one. The control system decodes each instruction and turns it into a series of control signals that operate the other parts of the computer.&lt;ref&gt;The control unit's rule in interpreting instructions has varied somewhat in the past. While the control unit is solely responsible for instruction interpretation in most modern computers, this is not always the case. Many computers include some instructions that may only be partially interpreted by the control system and partially interpreted by another device. This is especially the case with specialized computing hardware that may be partially self-contained. For example, [[EDVAC]], the first modern stored program computer to be designed, used a central control unit that only interpreted four instructions. All of the arithmetic-related instructions were passed on to its arithmetic unit and further decoded there.&lt;/ref&gt; Control systems in advanced computers may change the order of some instructions so as to improve performance.

A key component common to all CPUs is the [[program counter]], a special memory cell (a [[register]]) that keeps track of which location in memory the next instruction is to be read from.&lt;ref&gt;Instructions often occupy more than one memory address, so the program counters usually increases by the number of memory locations required to store one instruction.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Mips32 addi.svg|thumb|300px|right|Diagram showing how a particular [[MIPS architecture]] instruction would be decoded by the control system.]]

The control system's function is as follows&amp;mdash;note that this is a simplified description and some of these steps may be performed concurrently or in a different order depending on the type of CPU:

# Read the code for the next instruction from the cell indicated by the program counter.
# Decode the numerical code for the instruction into a set of commands or signals for each of the other systems.
# Increment the program counter so it points to the next instruction.
# Read whatever data the instruction requires from cells in memory (or perhaps from an input device). The location of this required data is typically stored within the instruction code.
# Provide the necessary data to an ALU or register.
# If the instruction requires an ALU or specialized hardware to complete, instruct the hardware to perform the requested operation.
# Write the result from the ALU back to a memory location or to a register or perhaps an output device.
# Jump back to step (1).

Since the program counter is (conceptually) just another set of memory cells, it can be changed by calculations done in the ALU. Adding 100 to the program counter would cause the next instruction to be read from a place 100 locations further down the program. Instructions that modify the program counter are often known as &quot;jumps&quot; and allow for loops (instructions that are repeated by the computer) and often conditional instruction execution (both examples of [[control flow]]).

It is noticeable that the sequence of operations that the control unit goes through to process an instruction is in itself like a short computer program - and indeed, in some more complex CPU designs, there is another yet smaller computer called a [[microsequencer]] that runs a [[microcode]] program that causes all of these events to happen.

===Arithmetic/logic unit (ALU)===
{{main|Arithmetic logic unit}}

The ALU is capable of performing two classes of operations: arithmetic and logic.

The set of arithmetic operations that a particular ALU supports may be limited to adding and subtracting or might include multiplying or dividing, [[trigonometry]] functions (sine, cosine, etc) and [[square root]]s. Some can only operate on whole numbers ([[integer]]s) whilst others use [[floating point]] to represent [[real number]]s&amp;mdash;albeit with limited precision. However, any computer that is capable of performing just the simplest operations can be programmed to break down the more complex operations into simple steps that it can perform. Therefore, any computer can be programmed to perform any arithmetic operation&amp;mdash;although it will take more time to do so if its ALU does not directly support the operation. An ALU may also compare numbers and return [[Logical value|boolean truth values]] (true or false) depending on whether one is equal to, greater than or less than the other (&quot;is 64 greater than 65?&quot;).

Logic operations involve [[Boolean algebra|boolean]] logic: [[logical conjunction|AND]], [[logical disjunction|OR]], [[Exclusive disjunction|XOR]] and [[logical negation|NOT]]. These can be useful both for creating complicated [[conditional statement]]s and processing [[boolean logic]].

[[Superscalar]] computers contain multiple ALUs so that they can process several instructions at the same time. [[Graphics processing unit|Graphics processors]] and computers with [[SIMD]] and [[MIMD]] features often provide ALUs that can perform arithmetic on [[vector (spatial)|vectors]] and [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]].

===Memory===
{{main|Computer storage}}
[[Image:Magnetic core.jpg|thumb|right|[[Magnetic core memory]] was popular main memory for computers through the 1960s until it was completely replaced by semiconductor memory.]]

A computer's memory can be viewed as a list of cells into which numbers can be placed or read. Each cell has a numbered &quot;address&quot; and can store a single number. The computer can be instructed to &quot;put the number 123 into the cell numbered 1357&quot; or to &quot;add the number that is in cell 1357 to the number that is in cell 2468 and put the answer into cell 1595&quot;. The information stored in memory may represent practically anything. Letters, numbers, even computer instructions can be placed into memory with equal ease. Since the CPU does not differentiate between different types of information, it is up to the software to give significance to what the memory sees as nothing but a series of numbers.

In almost all modern computers, each memory cell is set up to store [[binary number]]s in groups of eight [[bit]]s (called a [[byte]]). Each byte is able to represent 256 different numbers; either from 0 to 255 or -128 to +127. To store larger numbers, several consecutive bytes may be used (typically, two, four or eight). When negative numbers are required, they are usually stored in [[two's complement]] notation. Other arrangements are possible, but are usually not seen outside of specialized applications or historical contexts. A computer can store any kind of information in memory as long as it can be somehow represented in numerical form. Modern computers have billions or even trillions of bytes of memory.

The CPU contains a special set of memory cells called [[Processor register|register]]s that can be read and written to much more rapidly than the main memory area. There are typically between two and one hundred registers depending on the type of CPU. Registers are used for the most frequently needed data items to avoid having to access main memory every time data is needed. Since data is constantly being worked on, reducing the need to access main memory (which is often slow compared to the ALU and control units) greatly increases the computer's speed.

Computer main memory comes in two principal varieties: [[random access memory]] or RAM and [[read-only memory]] or ROM. RAM can be read and written to anytime the CPU commands it, but ROM is pre-loaded with data and software that never changes, so the CPU can only read from it. ROM is typically used to store the computer's initial start-up instructions. In general, the contents of RAM is erased when the power to the computer is turned off while ROM retains its data indefinitely. In a PC, the ROM contains a specialized program called the [[BIOS]] that orchestrates loading the computer's [[operating system]] from the hard disk drive into RAM whenever the computer is turned on or reset. In [[embedded computer]]s, which frequently do not have disk drives, all of the software required to perform the task may be stored in ROM. Software that is stored in ROM is often called [[firmware]] because it is notionally more like hardware than software. [[Flash memory]] blurs the distinction between ROM and RAM by retaining data when turned off but being rewritable like RAM. However, flash memory is typically much slower than conventional ROM and RAM so its use is restricted to applications where high speeds are not required. &lt;ref&gt;Flash memory also may only be rewritten a limited number of times before wearing out, making it less useful for heavy random access usage. {{Ref harvard|verma1988|Verma 1988|a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In more sophisticated computers there may be one or more RAM [[CPU cache|cache memories]] which are slower than registers but faster than main memory. Generally computers with this sort of cache are designed to move frequently needed data into the cache automatically, often without the need for any intervention on the programmer's part.

===Input/output (I/O)===
{{main|Input/output}}
[[Image:HDDspin.JPG|thumb|right|[[Hard disk]]s are common I/O devices used with computers.]]
I/O is the means by which a computer receives information from the outside world and sends results back. Devices that provide input or output to the computer are called [[peripheral]]s. On a typical [[personal computer]], peripherals include inputs like the keyboard and [[computer mouse|mouse]], and outputs such as the [[computer monitor|display]] and [[Computer printer|printer]]. [[Hard disk]]s, [[floppy disk]]s and [[optical disc]]s serve as both inputs and outputs. [[Computer networking]] is another form of I/O.

Practically any device that can be made to interface digitally may be used as I/O. The computer in the [[Engine Control Unit]] of a modern [[automobile]] might read the position of the pedals and steering wheel, the output of the [[oxygen sensor]] and devices that monitor the speed of each wheel. The output devices include the various lights and gauges that the driver sees as well as the engine controls such as the spark ignition circuits and fuel injection systems. In a digital wristwatch, the computer reads the buttons and causes numbers and symbols to be shown on the [[liquid crystal display]].

Often, I/O devices are complex computers in their own right with their own CPU and memory. A [[graphics processing unit]] might contain fifty or more tiny computers that perform the calculations necessary to display [[3D computer graphics|3D graphics]]. Modern [[desktop computer]]s contain many smaller computers that assist the main CPU in performing I/O.

===Multitasking===
{{main|Computer multitasking}}
While a computer may be viewed as running one gigantic program stored in its main memory, in some systems it is necessary to give the appearance of running several programs simultaneously. This is achieved by having the computer switch rapidly between running each program in turn. One means by which this is done is with a special signal called an [[interrupt]] which can periodically cause the computer to stop executing instructions where it was and do something else instead. By remembering where it was executing prior to the interrupt, the computer can return to that task later. If several programs are running &quot;at the same time&quot;, then the interrupt generator might be causing several hundred interrupts per second, causing a program switch each time. Since modern computers typically execute instructions several orders of magnitude faster than human perception, it may appear that many programs are running at the same time even though only one is ever executing in any given instant. This method of multitasking is sometimes termed &quot;time-sharing&quot; since each program is allocated a &quot;slice&quot; of time in turn.

Before the era of cheap computers, the principle use for multitasking was to allow many people to share the same computer.

Seemingly, multitasking would cause a computer that is switching between several programs to run more slowly - in direct proportion to the number of programs it is running. However, most programs spend much of their time waiting for slow input/output devices to complete their tasks. If a program is waiting for the user to click on the mouse or press a key on the keyboard, then it will not take a &quot;time slice&quot; until the event it is waiting for has occurred. This frees up time for other programs to execute so that many programs may be run at the same time without unacceptable speed loss.

===Multiprocessing===
{{main|Multiprocessing}}
[[Image:Cray 2 Arts et Metiers dsc03940.jpg|thumb|[[Cray]] designed many supercomputers that used multiprocessing heavily.]]
Some computers may divide their work between one or more separate CPUs, creating a multiprocessing configuration. Traditionally, this technique was utilized only in large and powerful computers such as [[supercomputer]]s, [[mainframe computer]]s and [[server (computing)|servers]]. However, multiprocessor and [[Multi-core (computing)|multi-core]] (multiple CPUs on a single integrated circuit) personal and laptop computers have become widely available and are beginning to see increased usage in lower-end markets as a result.

Supercomputers in particular often have highly unique architectures that differ significantly from the basic stored-program architecture and from general purpose computers.&lt;ref&gt;However, it is also very common to construct supercomputers out of many pieces of cheap commodity hardware; usually individual computers connected by networks.  These so-called [[computer cluster]]s can often provide supercomputer performance at a much lower cost than customized designs.  While custom architectures are still used for most of the most powerful supercomputers, there has been a proliferation of cluster computers in recent years. {{Ref harvard|top5002006|TOP500 2006|a}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They often feature thousands of CPUs, customized high-speed interconnects, and specialized computing hardware. Such designs tend to be useful only for specialized tasks due to the large scale of program organization required to successfully utilize most of a the available resources at once. Supercomputers usually see usage in large-scale [[Computer simulation|simulation]], [[Rendering (computer graphics)|graphics rendering]], and [[cryptography]] applications, as well as with other so-called &quot;[[embarrassingly parallel]]&quot; tasks.

===Networking and the Internet===
{{main|Computer networking|Internet}}
[[Image:Internet map 1024.jpg|thumb|Visualization of a portion of the [[Routing|routes]] on the Internet.]]
Computers have been used to coordinate information in multiple locations since the 1950s, with the US military's [[Semi Automatic Ground Environment|SAGE]] system the first large-scale example of such a system, which led to a number of special-purpose commercial systems like [[Sabre (computer system)|Sabre]].

In the 1970s, computer engineers at research institutions throughout the US began to link their computers together using telecommunications technology. This effort was funded by ARPA (now [[DARPA]]), and the [[computer network]] that it produced was called the [[Advanced Research Projects Agency Network|ARPANET]]. The technologies that made the Arpanet possible spread and evolved. In time, the network spread beyond academic and military institutions and became known as the [[Internet]]. The emergence of networking involved a redefinition of the nature and boundaries of the computer. Computer operating systems and applications were modified to include the ability to define and access the resources of other computers on the network, such as peripheral devices, stored information, and the like, as extensions of the resources of an individual computer. Initially these facilities were available primarily to people working in high-tech environments, but in the 1990s the spread of applications like [[e-mail]] and the [[World Wide Web]], combined with the development of cheap, fast networking technologies like [[Ethernet]] and [[ADSL]] saw computer networking become almost ubiquitous. In fact, the number of computers that are networked is growing phenomenally. A very large proportion of [[personal computers]] regularly connect to the [[Internet]] to communicate and receive information. &quot;Wireless&quot; networking, often utilizing [[mobile phone]] networks, has meant networking is becoming increasingly ubiquitous even in mobile computing environments.

===Software===
'''Software''' refers to parts of the computer that have no material form; programs, data, protocols, etc are all software. When software is stored in hardware that cannot easily be modified (such as [[BIOS]] [[Read-only memory|ROM]] in an [[IBM PC compatible]]), it is sometimes termed firmware to indicate that it falls into an area of uncertainty between hardware and software.

===Programming languages===
Programming languages provide various ways of specifying programs for computers to run. Unlike [[natural language]]s, programming languages are designed to permit no ambiguity and to be concise. They are purely written languages and are often difficult to read aloud. They are generally either translated into [[machine language]] by a [[compiler]] or an [[Assembly language#Assembler|assembler]] before being run, or translated directly at run time by an [[interpreter]]. Sometimes programs are executed by a hybrid method of the two techniques. There are thousands of different programming languages&amp;mdash;some intended to be general purpose, others useful only for highly specialized applications.

===Professions and organizations===

==Lesson==
It is difficult to define any one device as the earliest computer&lt;ref&gt;This article contains text from [[w:|English Wikipedia]] article [[w:Computer|Computer]] adopted under the terms of [[w:GNU Free Documentation License|GNU Free Documentation License version 1.2 or any later]]: Wikipedia contributors, &quot;Computer,&quot; ''Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia'', http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Computer&amp;oldid=139003746 (accessed June 18, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;. The very definition of a computer has changed and it is therefore impossible to identify the first computer.  Many devices once called &quot;computers&quot; would no longer qualify as such by today's standards.

===Pre-computer age===
[[w:Image:Jacquard.loom.full.view.jpg|thumb|right|The [[w:Jacquard loom|Jacquard loom]] was one of the first programmable devices.]]

Originally, the term &quot;computer&quot; referred to a person who performed numerical calculations (a [[w:human computer|human computer]]), often with the aid of a [[w:mechanical calculating device|mechanical calculating device]]. Examples of early mechanical computing devices included the [[w:abacus|abacus]], the [[w:slide rule|slide rule]] and arguably the [[w:astrolabe|astrolabe]] and the [[w:Antikythera mechanism|Antikythera mechanism]] (which dates from about 150-100 BC). The end of the [[w:Middle Ages|Middle Ages]] saw a re-invigoration of European mathematics and engineering, and [[w:Wilhelm Schickard|Wilhelm Schickard]]'s 1623 device was the first of a number of mechanical calculators constructed by European engineers.

However, none of those devices fit the modern definition of a computer because they could not be programmed. In 1801, [[w:Joseph Marie Jacquard|Joseph Marie Jacquard]] made an improvement to the [[w:loom|textile loom]] that used a series of [[w:punch card|punched paper cards]] as a template to allow his loom to weave intricate patterns automatically.  The resulting Jacquard loom was an important step in the development of computers because the use of punched cards to define woven patterns can be viewed as an early, albeit limited, form of programmability.

In 1837, [[w:Charles Babbage|Charles Babbage]] was the first to conceptualize and design a fully programmable mechanical computer that he called &quot;The [[w:Analytical engine|Analytical Engine]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;The Analytical Engine should not be confused with Babbage's [[w:difference engine|difference engine]] which was a non-programmable mechanical calculator.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to limited finance, and an inability to resist tinkering with the design, Babbage never actually built his analytical engine.

Large-scale automated data processing of punched cards was performed for the [[w:United States Census, 1890|US Census in 1890]] by [[w:tabulating machine|tabulating machine]]s designed by [[w:Herman Hollerith|Herman Hollerith]] and manufactured by the [[w:Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation|Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation]], which later became [[w:IBM|IBM]]. By the end of the 19th century a number of technologies that would later prove useful in the realization of practical computers had begun to appear: the [[w:punch card|punched card]], [[w:boolean algebra|boolean algebra]], the [[w:vacuum tube|vacuum tube]] (thermionic valve) and the [[w:teleprinter|teleprinter]].

During the first half of the 20th century, many scientific computing needs were met by increasingly sophisticated [[w:analog computer|analog computer]]s, which used a direct mechanical or [[w:electricity|electrical]] model of the problem as a basis for [[w:computation|computation]]. However, these were not programmable and generally lacked the versatility and accuracy of modern digital computers.

===Early computers===

A succession of steadily more powerful and flexible computing devices were constructed in the 1930s and 1940s, gradually adding the key features that are seen in modern computers. The use of digital electronics (largely invented by [[w:Claude Shannon|Claude Shannon]] in 1937) and more flexible programmability were vitally important steps, but defining one point along this road as &quot;the first digital electronic computer&quot; is difficult {{Ref harvard|shannon1940|Shannon 1940|a}}. Notable achievements include:

[[w:Image:EDSAC (10).jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[w:EDSAC|EDSAC]] was one of the first computers to implement the stored program ([[w:von Neumann architecture|von Neumann]]) architecture.]]
* [[w:Konrad Zuse|Konrad Zuse]]'s [[w:Electromechanics|electromechanical]] &quot;Z machines&quot;. The [[w:Z3|Z3]] (1941) was the first working machine featuring [[w:Binary numeral system|binary]] arithmetic, including floating point arithmetic and a measure of programmability. In 1998 the Z3 was proved to be [[w:Turing completeness|Turing complete]], therefore being the world's first operational computer.
* The [[w:Atanasoff-Berry Computer|Atanasoff-Berry Computer]] (1941) which used vacuum tube based [[w:computation|computation]], binary numbers, and [[w:regenerative capacitor memory|regenerative capacitor memory]].
* The secret British [[w:Colossus computer|Colossus computer]] (1944), which had limited programmability but demonstrated that a device using thousands of tubes could be reasonably reliable and electronically reprogrammable. It was used for [[w:cryptanalysis|breaking]] German wartime codes.
* The [[w:Harvard Mark I|Harvard Mark I]] (1944), a large-scale electromechanical computer with limited programmability.
* The US Army's [[w:Ballistics Research Laboratory|Ballistics Research Laboratory]] [[w:ENIAC|ENIAC]] (1946), which used [[w:decimal|decimal]] arithmetic and was the first general purpose electronic computer, although it initially had an inflexible architecture which essentially required rewiring to change its programming.

Several developers of ENIAC, recognizing its flaws, came up with a far more flexible and elegant design, which came to be known as the '''stored program architecture''' or [[w:von Neumann architecture|von Neumann architecture]]. This design was first formally described by [[w:John von Neumann|John von Neumann]] in the paper &quot;[[w:First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC|First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC]]&quot;, published in 1945. A number of projects to develop computers based on the stored program architecture commenced around this time, the first of these being completed in [[w:Great Britain|Great Britain]]. The first to be demonstrated working was the [[w:Manchester Small-Scale Experimental Machine|Manchester Small-Scale Experimental Machine]] (SSEM) or &quot;Baby&quot;. However, the [[w:EDSAC|EDSAC]], completed a year after SSEM, was perhaps the first practical implementation of the stored program design. Shortly thereafter, the machine originally described by von Neumann's paper&amp;mdash;[[w:EDVAC|EDVAC]]&amp;mdash;was completed but didn't see full-time use for an additional two years.

Nearly all modern computers implement some form of the stored program architecture, making it the single trait by which the word &quot;computer&quot; is now defined. By this standard, many earlier devices would no longer be called computers by today's definition, but are usually referred to as such in their historical context. While the technologies used in computers have changed dramatically since the first electronic, general-purpose computers of the 1940s, most still use the [[w:von Neumann architecture|von Neumann architecture]]. The design made the universal computer a practical reality.

[[w:Image:80486dx2-large.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[w:Microprocessors|Microprocessors]] are miniaturized devices that often implement stored program [[w:CPU|CPU]]s.]]

===Toward modern computers===
[[w:Vacuum tube|Vacuum tube]]-based computers were in use throughout the 1950s, but were largely replaced in the 1960s by [[w:transistor|transistor]]-based devices, which were smaller, faster, cheaper, used less power and were more reliable. These factors allowed computers to be produced on an unprecedented commercial scale. By the 1970s, the adoption of [[w:integrated circuit|integrated circuit]] technology and the subsequent creation of [[w:microprocessor|microprocessor]]s such as the [[w:Intel 4004|Intel 4004]] caused another leap in size, speed, cost and reliability. By the 1980s, computers had become sufficiently small and cheap to replace simple mechanical controls in domestic appliances such as [[w:washing machines|washing machines]]. Around the same time, computers became widely accessible for personal use by individuals in the form of [[w:home computer|home computer]]s and the now ubiquitous [[w:personal computer|personal computer]]. In conjunction with the widespread growth of the [[w:Internet|Internet]] since the 1990s, personal computers are becoming as common as the [[w:television|television]] and the [[w:telephone|telephone]] and almost all modern electronic devices contain a computer of some kind.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{moed from [[w:Rumba (dance)]]}

The basic move in American Style Rumba is known as a [[Box Step]].  It is similar in basic structure to [[Waltz]] and other box-step dances in step position, but uses a [[Time signature|4/4 timing]] versus the [[Time signature|3/4 timing]] found in Waltz.  Assuming an eight count step (two measures of 4/4), steps occur on one, three, four, five, seven, and eight.  This leaves a &quot;slow--quick-quick-slow--quick-quick&quot; pattern to the dance in its most basic form.

|'''Step 0''', Starting position.  Lead (represented in blue) and Follow (represented in pink) face each other, feet closed, roughly squarely in front of each other.
|[[Image:Rumba0.png]]
|- align=&quot;left&quot;
|'''Step 1'''.  Beginning of movement.  Lead steps forward with the left foot while Follow steps backward with the right foot.  This begins slightly before the first count in the music, so that the foot comes down on the first count.  Dancers hold this position through the second count.  This is the first ''slow'' in the ''slow--quick-quick'' pattern described above.
|[[Image:Rumba1.png]]
|- align=&quot;left&quot;
|'''Step 2'''.  Lead brings the right foot forward and then to the right, while Follow brings left foot back and to the left.  This occurs for the third count.  This is the first ''quick'' in the ''slow--quick-quick'' pattern.
|[[Image:Rumba2.png]]
|- align=&quot;left&quot;
|'''Step 3'''.  Lead's left foot steps to the right to meet the right foot while Follow's right foot steps left to meet the left foot.  This occurs for the fourth count of music.  This is the second ''quick'' in the ''slow--quick-quick'' pattern.
|[[Image:Rumba3.png]]
|- align=&quot;left&quot;
|'''Step 4'''.  Lead steps backward with the right foot while Follow steps forward with the left foot.  This move is basically the reverse of Step 1, and occurs with the fifth count of music in the same manner that Step 1 occurred with the first count.  Dancers hold this position through the sixth count of music.  This is the first ''slow'' in the second part of the ''slow--quick-quick'' pattern.
|[[Image:Rumba4.png]]
|- align=&quot;left&quot;
|'''Step 5'''.  Lead brings the left foot backward and then to the left, while Follow brings right foot forward and to the right.  This occurs on the seventh count.  This is the first ''quick'' in the second part of the ''slow--quick-quick'' pattern.
|[[Image:Rumba5.png]]
|- align=&quot;left&quot;
|'''Step 6'''.  Lead's right foot steps to the left, meeting the left foot, while Follow's right foot steps to the right, meeting the left foot.  This occurs on the eighth count of music.  This is the second ''quick'' in the second part of the ''slow--quick-quick'' pattern, and leaves the Dancers in the position in Step 0, to begin again at Step 1 on the next count of music and with the next ''slow--quick-quick'' pattern.

The basic is only to provide a framework for the rest of the dance.  Mastering the dance requires learning additional steps that fall within this framework.

==Why have a Wikibook on X-Plane==
X-Plane is an incredible flight simulator. Without a doubt it takes a lot of effort to maintain it and add new features. Now consider that it is the work of one person. Given the state of the manual, clearly the focus is on the code. We can't help with the code. What we can do is create a good reference for both new and experienced users. In a perfect world X-Plane would come with a really nice manual. Well the world ain't perfect. We can continue to gripe about how hard it is to find detailed information on X-Plane or we can do something about it. This is something.

==Rules of the Road==
#Note the license information on any edit page. Do not add copyrighted material without the original author's express permission. Get permission to add someone else's work even if you think it is in the public domain. 
#If you find material that you authored and didn't give permission to add it here, please remove it. Also, please let us know via the 'talk' page what you did and why.
#Consider opening a discussion on the 'talk' page before undertaking radical and major changes.
#Use the subpage structure. The Parts are arbitrary and are on the same level as Chapters. Sections should be subpages of Chapters and Sub-sections should be sub-pages of Sections.
#Consider adding a link to both the previous and next page for logical book order reading.
#Please sign and date stamp your entries in the discussions by adding &lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt; at the end.

==Discussion==
I'm guessing you have a watch on. The only way this project has value for me is for it to become the &quot;book.&quot; The basic verses advanced nature of topics is why there is two parts. Anyway, the intent of Part One is to cover the basic user manual stuff though maybe in a slightly different order than the manual and certainly in more detail where it's called for. I was going for an analog of real world flight training. The 'Part One' page kinda introduces those chapters. I'm open to more chapters or adding in sections if that makes sense. WE (emphasis intended) certainly should flesh out the structure as you say. I look forward to working with you on this project.
[[User:Mawilson|Mawilson]] 21:35, 9 November 2007 (UTC)

Agreed. But if this is to be the &quot;book of X-Plane Flight Simulator&quot; we should flesh out the organization early on. Your Part Two is very advanced stuff for a majority of the audience. The PD manual's organization from Austin is worth expanding upon and adjusting as needed.[[User:Man-hi|Man-hi]] 19:33, 9 November 2007 (UTC)

The manual needs work in the organization area and this book should go beyond the basic user manual to address all aspects of operation and customization. To that end I've put in a structure and will start fleshing it out. According to the web page Austin has released the manual to Public Domain (&quot;You may copy, modify, quote, use, distribute (or anything else you can imagine) the X-Plane instruction manual freely.&quot; &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.x-plane.com/policies.html&lt;/nowiki&gt;) so we can use manual content here. I just think there is a better way to present it. 
[[User:Mawilson|Mawilson]] 19:17, 9 November 2007 (UTC)

Why was the content here deleted?  We had some basic framework going.
[[User:Man-hi|Man-hi]] 00:48, 19 June 2007 (UTC)

Here is the X-Plane Operation Manual TOC. I suggest we add this verbatim and let end-users mash it up to make sense and tune out Austin's style.

==Help for Editors of this Book==
This is a worthy but very complex project. X-Plane is a fast moving development, many people are involved and not all are fully acquainted with the various sources of information about it. As a first step, and to help editors (who need not be X-Plane addicts), there should be a list of links to sources already extant and an indication of their copyright status. Some of these have been updated regularly, others not. If every editor has to ask every publisher of all the material on X-Plane, everyone is going to be very busy but there will be very little written in the book. 
Editors should have blanket clearance to lift chunks of stuff and post it here; so the enthusiasts for this book would be wise to obtain permission for all future editors from the owners of relevant copyrights and post this info here in the Talk page.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=='''1.)	Moving up the Food Chain: Become comfortable with questioning our own / the system’s assumptions and traditions about the way education should work.'''==

A teacher has the potential to become a powerful agent of change in the classroom.  Unfortunately not all teachers are comfortable being a risk taker.  That is not to suggest that an educator needs to question everything all the time.  But to meet the growing needs of students in this day and age a teacher will likely need to try different methods of instruction to serve all of their students.  In an ideal world administrators would be/are supportive of their teachers asking questions and trying new things.  In my experience if you aren’t able to “sell” your administrator on a new idea, repackaging the idea and being prepared to defend its exploration can often be effective.  In general it seems that a teacher can question as long as it falls within the confines of the established curriculum.  State standards have gone a long way toward establishing required educational content.  Most questioning and creativity now seems to be in the presentation and what learning experiences are provided in the classroom.


=='''2.)	What Teachers Need to Know about Social Software: How do we know what to use? How do we find it? How do we use it effectively? +tech integration'''==

We live in a technology driven society.  Teachers need to be comfortable and confident with technology integration in the classroom.  Many veteran educators are digital immigrants who unfortunately do not push themselves very hard to immigrate across the digital divide.  Probably a big factor in this lack of technology integration/understanding is the ever changing nature of technology.  It is relatively impossible to have total mastery of all technologies.  If educators are uncomfortable using even the basic components of technology how can they be expected to readily adopt and promote newer technologies?  Teachers who need the support should have regular technology training sessions.  (Once mastery is shown the sessions should be optional.)  Without school support it will fall entirely on the educator to explore new technologies on their own time with their own resources.  Incentives or mandates need to be in place to give teachers that push they need to explore and understand new technologies.  Many forms of social software can be utilized by educators that can be used to effectively communicate with students, parents, and fellow educators.  (see #3)  Basically I think teachers need to know what technology is out there and how to use it.


=='''3.)	Making Connections Through Web 2.0: Between Parents and Teachers, Teachers and Teachers, Teachers and Students, etc.'''==

Web 2.0 technologies have the potential to be extremely powerful communication tools.  Properly used, teachers could foster a new level of parent/teacher communication and understanding.  Teachers could go so far as to broadcast (podcast) their entire school day with the children.  This would allow parents to see what material was addressed and the method the teacher used.  A driven and involved parent would then have the ability to reinforce at home what was taught and even add to the experience through further study and exploration.  Web 2.0 parents could even post or send the home experiences back to the teacher to use to strengthen their current and future lessons.  This would be just one example of how the parent could become a valuable member of the learning community that is their child’s classroom.  Another easy example would be for absent students really being able to see what they missed and “make it up”.  Teacher communication with the student could be improved as well.  With a posting setup (such as wiki) teachers could lay the framework of lessons taught during the day and students could fill in their understanding or lack thereof for peers, teachers, and parents to benefit from and address.  Assuming lessons were digitally recorded/transmitted, teachers (and even future teachers) could benefit from viewing successful lessons (or even what pitfalls to avoid with unsuccessful ones).  A concern about digitally broadcasting class every day might be teachers becoming even more afraid to take chances/risks or on occasion even be wrong.  A malicious viewer could potentially create a greatest hits volume of just how unprepared, wrong, and unfit the teacher is over the course of a full year(s).  Elements taken out of context could cost people their jobs!  Used properly and with mutual understanding and goodwill the integration of Web 2.0 technologies into the classroom could have a profoundly positive impact on education.


=='''4.)	The Future of Accountability? -- Dumbing down the test? Incentives for Passing?'''==

Barring the tests “dying” and going away efforts need to be made to make tests into a more meaningful and authentic assessment (see #5).  I feel testing is a huge issue as I have been an educator during the dawn of testing era.  Not that tests were never given, or in place, but state standard tests have greatly altered education in a public school setting.  The “passing fad” seems to have taken root and twisted up our tree of knowledge.  Test scores are now the primary measure of a teacher’s worth and the overall worth of the school.  Schools are now held accountable through the No Child Left Behind Act so essentially if the scores aren’t good enough people lose jobs, doors close, or both.  Administrators are literally telling their teachers to teach to the test.  I repeat teach to the test!  This has now become the face of modern education.  As “valuable” as these tests have now become to a school’s survival there are no real incentives for students to perform any better than the minimum requirements.  70% is the new ceiling for student knowledge.  As long as the student can answer 70% of what a multiple choice test asks they are ready to progress and their teacher has done their job.  So what about the students who haven’t hit that 70% mark and never will?  Do we just lower the standards?  Do we just wink and slide them on through?  Knowledge can be demonstrated in a variety of ways and hard as we may try not everyone expresses themselves in exactly the same way.  I’m still waiting for the creativity standards to be added to the curriculum.  Quantifying one’s ability to draw, sing, etc. should be quite interesting to see.  People learn and express their knowledge and understanding in a variety of ways.  It is up our government both national and state to see that knowledge is being assessed in an appropriate and “fair” manner.


=='''5.)	Tests may be expedient, but they might not be authentic.'''==

So here’s the million or even billion dollar question how do we test everyone in an authentic manner?  Will a multiple choice test tell you what a person knows?  Yes and no.  A multiple choice can tell you many aspects of a person’s understanding but not all.  You will be able to find out if they can read (unless they just guess and fill in bubbles randomly).  You will be able to see their ability to analyze and make decisions based on the situations given (again if not guessing not to mention cheating – oh I just did).  You can a bare bones view of their understanding of the factual situation presented.  Also the hand-eye coordination of filling in the correct bubble that corresponds to the correct letter is heavily assessed (a skill now developed in the first grade).  So yes you can find out a bit about a student’s ability to recall facts and to analyze basic situations.  I say basic because in a multiple choice test the answer is there.  The path is already set all they need to do is some basic analysis of the situation.  The true power of testing lies in authentic assessment.  Basically present students with open-end questions or scenarios and have them show you how they would deal with it.  It’s a true assessment of what they really know and can do but will it ever be the mainstay?  Probably not until software has evolved to the point that it will be able to analyze and assess unique responses will authentic assessment be conducted on anything beyond a small scale only.

}}
{{B3D:N2P/ForVersion|2.57}}

== Creating the Canyon ==
=== Forming from Textures ===
* Open up a new Blender file and erase the default cube with {{B3D:N2P/Do|X}}
* Create a plane ({{B3D:N2P/Do|Shift}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|A}} -&gt; Mesh -&gt; Plane)
* Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|WKEY}} and then specify 100 cuts in the Tool Properties panel (immediately below the Tool Shelf on the left).
** You could also do this by subdividing the plane twice with the number of cuts both set to 10.
* Scale the canyon up to 5 times its current size
** Do this by either hitting {{B3D:N2P/Do|SKEY}} and typing in 5, or hitting {{B3D:N2P/Do|SKEY}} while holding {{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL}} to snap and scale your mesh 5 times.&lt;br /&gt;
At this point your mesh should look like something like the picture below.

{{Template:B3D:N2P/VTT1
|image=blender-2.5_flying_through_canyon_subdivided_plane.png
|imageWidth=800px
}}

=== Texturing, Shading, and Deforming Your Mesh ===
* Go to the Materials tab on the Properties Panel, and click ''New''.
* Go to the Texture tab next to the Materials, and click ''New''.
** This texture will be used to create our canyon, so give it an appropriate name. In this tutorial, &quot;Canyon&quot; was used.
* Select the Texture Type to be Wood
  '''User Note:''' ''I found that the 'cloud' texture works nicely for creating a canyon, with size 0.45 and depth 2.''
* Go back into the Texture tab and uncheck ''Canyon''.&lt;br /&gt;
We will now displace the vertices based on the texture.

* Click on the Modifiers tab on the Properties panel (spanner icon).
* Click the ''Add Modifier'' pop-up menu and select &quot;Displace&quot;.
* Select your &quot;Canyon&quot; texture for the displacement.
** Go into Object Mode. Notice that the vertices have been displaced! (To see the results better, make sure you're in Solid Mode) However, the material is very jagged. This is because Blender is preserving the original faces on the underlying material, and the original faces don't run in the same direction as the grooves the wood material has created.

'''User Note:''' ''Also works with image textures, i.e. using an image as a texture. Tested using NASA's Blue marble topographic pictures. Go to the end of this tutorial for additional projects.''&lt;br /&gt;

Your Mesh should now look something like the picture below.

{{Template:B3D:N2P/VTT1
|image=blender-2.5_flying_through_canyon_displaced_plane.png
|imageWidth=800px
}}

=== Improving the Look ===
Now to make the canyon more interesting:
* Go back to the textures tab, under the Wood tab deselect Bands and select RingNoise.  Keep the default options for the moment.
* You will now see a &quot;rippling&quot; texture. But it isn't a canyon yet. For this we need to pack the ripples closer together to get more detail per ripple.
* Go into Edit mode (Tab), and make sure all vertices are selected (select one and press L or press A until all are highlighted). Now scale them to 0.2 of the original size. Do this pressing {{B3D:N2P/Do|SKEY}} and the minus sign (-) and ''.2''.
* Leave Edit Mode into Object Mode, and scale the Object (as a whole) up to 10.0 of the size; this time by pressing {{B3D:N2P/Do|SKEY}} and then ''10''.
** What just occurred is that you packed the vertices closer to each other, but not the texture. Then, you took the object as a whole (including the Texture) and up-scaled it. This is the difference between Scale in Edit Mode and Scale in Object Mode
* You should now have a semi-boring canyon, but it does have circuits which the camera can float around in.
* To make the Canyon more interesting, play around with the Texture values for Wood. I chose the values Noise Size: 1.0 and Turbulence: 15.00 as they produced a somewhat interesting outer ring.
* You may also want to play around the Deform modifier settings, especially ''Strength'' which changes the strength of the deformations.
* When you are happy with your mesh, press the ''Apply'' button under the Deform modifier.
** The displacements are now permanently baked into the Mesh, and the result should be something like the picture below.

{{Template:B3D:N2P/VTT1
|image=blender-2.5_flying_through_canyon_applied_displace.png
|imageWidth=800px
}}

=== Eliminating the Unneeded ===
* We will now reduce the number of vertices. Go into Modifiers, and add Decimate. The mesh will appear to change slightly, but it hasn't, except that 4-vertices faces have been triangulated
* Add another Modifer, Sub Surf, and make sure that the Levels is just 1
* Under the Decimate, slowly reduce the ratio and watch the Mesh. Very tiny mesh details will be changed but the Decimate modifier will keep the shape while reducing vertices.
* I got to 0.07 on my mesh before I decided the detail was getting too low. Remember you will be flying through the canyon, not over it, so the detail on the walls of the canyon is more important.
* Hit apply to bake the reduced vertice count into the Mesh. Smaller vertice counts will make rendering faster.
* Increase the number of levels on your Sub Surf modifer and take a good look, you have just created a canyon! You may reduce the levels or remove the Sub Surf entirely afterwards.

{{Template:B3D:N2P/VTT1
|image=blender-2.5_flying_through_canyon_finished_model.png
|imageWidth=800px
}}

== Coloring the Canyon ==
=== A Rocky Material ===
Method 1:
This is one method to create a rocky wall. The result isn't particularly realistic but it is easy to make.  Creating materials is a difficult practice, and the first step is to know what you're trying to recreate, perhaps by using actual photographs.
* Create a new material for the cliff
* In the Specular panel under the Materials tab, set the Intensity value to 0.132 (our cliff isn't particularly shiny) and Hardness to 20.
* Under the Textures tab, add a new texture in the first slot. 
** Give this texture the Marble texture type. Under the Marble options, select Hard and set the Noise Depth to 1 and Turbulence to 1.7.
** Under the Colors tab, activate ''Ramp''. The first colorstop should be white with a full alpha of 0.
** This is meant to give our primitive rock a textured appearance
* In the second texture slot, add another texture.
** Set this type to Clouds, under the ''Mapping'' options set the X, Y, and Z sizes to .025, under the cloud options select a noise depth of 2 and activate Hard Noise.
** This one will recreate some bumpiness and small inconsistencies in the rock
* In the third slot, add another texture
** Set the type to Clouds
** In the Colors tab, modify the colors to go from Black, 0 Alpha, to a Brown of your choosing, 0.750 Alpha. Reposition the second color to Pos 0.820
** This Texture will simulate dirt on the Canyon
* You will definitely want to do a render now. Reposition the camera and lights, and adjust render options to make for a fast render
* Go into Materials, then the textures tab and select the first Clouds texture you entered (should be 3rd on the list if you did not delete the Wood texture used earlier).
* With that selected, under the Map To tab, uncheck the Col, and check the Nor buttons. Set the Nor value to 2.0
** What we have just done is set the second texture not to affect color, but to affect the angle of the normal in a render. This can be used to reproduce jagged edges on flat surfaces, or waves in water
* Now, select the Marble texture again. Under the Map Input, adjust the sizeX, sizeY, and sizeZ values to 5.0. Do the same for the second texture.
** You will want to render here, adjust the values as desired. For more layers vertically, increase the sizeZ value
* You should now have an unrealistic, but sort of rocky Canyon wall.

Method 2:
This will produce a slightly more realistic texture. Instead of using marble, use clouds. Also, lighten the dark parts of the texture and darken the lightest parts. Make the dark brown parts a slightly lighter shade of brown. This will make your rock wall more realistic.

=== Lighting the cliff ===
* Remove all existing lights
* Creating a new light with the type of &quot;Hemi&quot;. Center it over our cliffs, and use Scale (s) to scale it down.
* Create another light, with the type of &quot;Sun&quot;. Position it where you want (position doesn't matter with Sun), and use Rotate (r) to position its Ray at the Angle you desire.
** In this example, the Sun was more of an evening Sun. Its light is at a 45 degree angle on one side. This creates some Canyon walls light, some dark.
* Position your camera and adjust the Energy values of your Hemi and your Sun. The Hemi will light up everything, its an easy way to give light to canyon walls that would otherwise be completely black. As a starting point, set your Hemi value at 0.4 and your Sun value at 1.5 and observe how that looks from a few angles. Make adjustments if you desire.

== Additional projects ==
# Using NASA's topographic image map at http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/BlueMarble/BlueMarble_monthlies.php

You have the option of selecting a small portion of your selected topographic map or you can map the entire 360x180 degree panoramic map onto a sphere. Refer to UV Mapping tutorial.

If you just select a small portion of the map of the world(cropping), note the resolution of your cropped image. Create a basic plane and do not scale it yet. Sub divide as many as required to match the resolution of your image. This is in order to get the most out of the topographic image. If you don't bother, this is not essential. The largest subdivision in Blender 2.49b is 120. If you want more than 120 splits, you need to redo the sub divide but the calculation is not straight forward. If you split 2, you get 4 pixels. If you split 3, you get 5 pixels. 

Then apply the texture. Choose texture of type &quot;image&quot; and do not disable this texture. NASA's topographic pictures also come in a colourful form but shaded to indicate heights. The reason why you leave the scaling to the last is that the texture is set to map onto the basic plane size of 2x2 units. If you increase this, the textures will be repeated. Adjust the strength level to a suitable level. The default 1 is too large.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
One problem that keeps popping up when creating forms with XForms is the lack of sorting. This is an example for how it is possible to sort an instance using a XSLT stylesheet in Firefox.

== Firefox XForms Example ==
The following model contains two instances. The first instance is the one we will sort and the second instance contains the XSLT stylesheet we will use to perform the sort.
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;xf:model&gt;
  &lt;xf:instance id=&quot;default-instance&quot;&gt;
    &lt;data xmlns=&quot;&quot;&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;B-item&lt;/name&gt;
        &lt;date&gt;2001-05-03&lt;/date&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;A-item&lt;/name&gt;
        &lt;date&gt;2005-05-03&lt;/date&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;Z-item&lt;/name&gt;
        &lt;date&gt;2003-05-03&lt;/date&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;D-item&lt;/name&gt;
        &lt;date&gt;2002-05-03&lt;/date&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/data&gt;
  &lt;/xf:instance&gt;

  &lt;xf:instance id=&quot;stylesheet&quot;&gt;
    &lt;xsl:stylesheet
      xmlns=&quot;&quot; 
      xmlns:xsl=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform&quot; 
      version=&quot;1.0&quot;&gt;
      &lt;xsl:template match=&quot;/&quot;&gt;
        &lt;data&gt;
          &lt;xsl:apply-templates select=&quot;data/item&quot;&gt;
            &lt;xsl:sort type=&quot;string&quot; select=&quot;name&quot;/&gt;
          &lt;/xsl:apply-templates&gt;
        &lt;/data&gt;
      &lt;/xsl:template&gt;
      &lt;xsl:template match=&quot;*|@*|text()&quot;&gt;
        &lt;xsl:copy&gt;
          &lt;xsl:apply-templates select=&quot;*|text()|@*&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;/xsl:copy&gt;
      &lt;/xsl:template&gt;
    &lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;
  &lt;/xf:instance&gt;
&lt;/xf:model&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

To perform the sort we will use the following JavaScript which will load the second instance into the Firefox stylesheet engine, then take the first instance make the transformation which will produce the sorted instance. Then the transformed instance is inserted into the model and a rebuild, recalculate, revalidate and refresh is performed.

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
function sort_instance(id) {
  // We get the instance element
  var instanceElement = document.getElementById(id);
  if (instanceElement!=null) {

   // XForms exposes the retrival of the instance document from the model element which *should*
   // be the parent for the instance element.
   var instance = instanceElement.parentNode.getInstanceDocument(id);

   if (instance!=null) {
      // Now creating the stylesheet, for this example the stylesheet document is also an instance
      // by it can be loaded from many difference sources
      var xslDom = instanceElement.parentNode.getInstanceDocument('stylesheet');

      // create an XSLTProcessor and attach the stylesheet
      var processor = new XSLTProcessor()
      processor.importStylesheet(xslDom);

      // now we do the sorting transformation
      var resultDom = processor.transformToDocument(instance, instance);

      // we then move the result info the instance dom
      instance.removeChild(instance.documentElement);
      instance.appendChild(resultDom.documentElement);

      // and performs the updates for XForms
      instanceElement.parentNode.rebuild();
      instanceElement.parentNode.recalculate();
      instanceElement.parentNode.revalidate();
      instanceElement.parentNode.refresh();
    }
  }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

== Discussion ==
The idea of having the stylesheet in an instance makes it possible to change the behavior of the sorting by binding controls to it and change stuff like XPath expressions and other XSLT syntax.

== References ==
This example is based upon the sample on [[http://landwehr.dk/blog/]http://landwehr.dk/blog/]

Specifically I'd like to know how this page should relate to the Calculus/Integration page? Should it just be a summary of the equations for each technique? Thanks [[User:W3asal|W3asal]] ([[User talk:W3asal|talk]]) 17:20, 18 September 2008 (UTC)

Should we justify each technique? Not a proof, but how one would develop the technique, including pictures explaining the techniques. I think these would be especially helpful for the more abstract approximations, such as the trapezoidal rule and Simpson's rule. [[User:W3asal|W3asal]] ([[User talk:W3asal|talk]]) 18:13, 18 September 2008 (UTC)

== Merging and other things. ==

I just suggested [[Calculus/Integration techniques/Infinite Sums]] and [[Calculus/Integration techniques/Recognizing Derivatives and the Substitution Rule]] be merged with [[Calculus/Indefinite integral]] since they are the already in that article and that is the proper place for them any way.  I also suggested [[Calculus/Integration techniques/Rational Functions Using Trig]] and [[Calculus/Integration techniques/Tangent Half Angle]] be merged as they are the same article, one copied from the other, and then 1 example added into one.  So, I feel the best name should be chosen.  Then, the 1 example should be moved if necessary.  Any opinions?

Also, I think this page in general is sort of pointless.  These should just be sections underneath Integration techniques in the main page of [[Calculus]].  It's dumb to have a &quot;chapter&quot; with basically 1 main section, and that 1 main section has 10 different major subsections.  It should be 1 chapter with 10 sections.

Also, any thoughts on [[Calculus/Integration techniques/Integration by Complexifying]]?  No one taking basic calculus is going to know the calculus of complex variables beforehand, which they would need to know to understand what is going on in that section.  That section seems more like a section that should be in a complex analysis book, not a basic calculus book. [[User:NumberTheorist|NumberTheorist]] ([[User talk:NumberTheorist|talk]]) 04:19, 27 February 2010 (UTC)

:I agree as far as the complexifying section is concerned.  I'm inclined to remove that material completely from this book and merge it into another book, but for now I'm just going to put it under the &quot;Extensions&quot; section of this book.  --[[User:Greenbreen|Greenbreen]] ([[User talk:Greenbreen|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Greenbreen|contribs]]) 18:02, 12 June 2011 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==question about vectors==
Shouldn't vector stuff be in a Higher Algebra section? If anyone doesn't mind, I'll move it in there and add to it later... [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 08:34 5 Aug 2003 (UTC)

Sure....  I encourage people to modify the Calculus textbook extensively, as I will be rather busy until around May when summer vacation starts and I have some free time :).  I have some stuff intended for the limits page that I haven't gotten around to proof-reading and submitting.  -- [[User:IntMan|IntMan]]

== Calculus Book ==

Has anyone thought of doing an anti-Calculus book (one using non-standard analysis and infinitesimals)? I think the approach is more natural and can be made rigorous.

If want to do a non-standard analysis, I would suggest doing P-Adic analysis.

You can do non-standard analysis along side any regular calculus book.  Really the only difference would be on the formal section on the definition of a limit.  It would be easy to write a &quot;drop in&quot; replacement of that section. -- julius

== Formatting standards ==
=== Environments ===

This books needs a uniform method for presenting
# theorems
# definitions
# examples
# solutions
# others?

For definitions and theorems we really need per-page css.  Maybe this will appear in a future version of wikipedia. 

The following are some alternatives none of which seem great

==== Just use section headings? ====
One way is just to use section headings.  Advantage: you can edit a smaller portion of the page.  Disadvantage: the contents page gets a little cluttered.

====  Blockquote ====

I now think this is a bad idea as the wiki formatting does not behave well with blockquote usage [[User:Juliusross|Juliusross]] 15:34, 22 October 2005 (UTC)

Using the nonwiki ''blockquote'' presents theorems and definitions well:

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
====== Theorem: Fundamental Theorem of Algebra ======
Every non constant polynomial defined over the complex numbers has at least one root.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*Disadvantage: 
**Line breaks, math and wiki markup can become a total mess.
**bad breaking when printing (we really want the whole box to remain on a single page)
**Editing the &quot;theorem&quot; above does not show the 'blocktext'' markup.  So the &quot;preview&quot; does not give the correct result.

==== Templates ====

One option is to use templates.
For instance &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Calculus/example|Find 2+4+5}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; gives
{{Calculus/example|Find 2+4+5}}.  This seems to be a bad idea as they are not numbered and cannot be refered or linked to.  Also it is not clear how large the parameter can be.


=== Presenting math ===
A suggestion:  Displayed equations should done as follows to get the alignment correct (hopefully this will not be necessary in some future version of wiki software). 

# Inline equations should be done using &lt;math&gt;blah&lt;/math&gt; (rationalle: it looks better and more consistent, and maybe if blahtex or some similar becomes used it will look better).
# Displayed equations
&lt;nowiki&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; blah &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
#Multilines to be presented at

&lt;nowiki&gt;{| &lt;math&gt;line 1M&lt;math&gt; \\ 

|&lt;math&gt;line 1M&lt;math&gt; \\ 

|&lt;math&gt;line 1M&lt;math&gt; \\ 

}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

=== Misc ===

# Do we say limits &quot;diverge&quot; or &quot;equal infinity&quot;.  Probably the second
# Formulae which end sentences should end with a period.
# Prefer sin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; x rather than (sin x)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;  (I know the latter is more precise, but the former really is standard).
# No math markup should appear in headings (they look terrible in the contents page)

:Wouldn't it be more appropriate to say limits &quot;approach infinity&quot; since infinity is more of a concept than an idea? Both terms should be used interchangeably as it increases the fluency of the student.
[[User:ChaoticLlama|ChaoticLlama]] 17:57, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

=== Graphs ===

1. For graphs. There is a site, wikisophia, that generates gnuplots graphs; http://wikisophia.org/wiki/Wikitex_Plot No reason on earth not to use it, especially as the code may be integrated into wikimedia at some point. This means code to generate the plot should be a comment next to the actual graph, especially for easy re-writes and changes.

== Calculus of variations ==

I'd like to have something on the calculus of variations somewhere. Do you think it would be appropiate for this book, or would better belong somewhere else?

: No, go ahead. Sounds great :) [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 04:44, 5 Jun 2004 (UTC)

: I disagree.  Calculus of variations is not usually considered in the same vein as regular calculus (e.g. to do it properly requires some functional analysis).  [[User:juliusross|juliusross]]

==Solved Examples and Problem Sets==

I was thinking about adding a few solved examples and problem sets. If I suddenly forgot calculus, I don't think I could simply read a few of the pages within and be ready to differentiate or integrate. I believe adding solved examples and practice problems would benefit anyone attempting to study calculus. I realize that some of the explanations given will not be adequate for solving an example problem, and I would not have any problem updating the explanations to do just that.

[[User:Spammy|Spammy]]

*Please do. I've added dead links on the section pages to pages of exercises on each section page. I used the naming convention 'Calculus:[section name]:Exercises' for consitency it would seem natural to use 'Calculus:[section name]:Solutions' for the corresponding pages of solutions.[[User:The Grimm Ripper|Grimm]] 01:07, 1 May 2005 (UTC)


There do exist some large collection of exercises (e.g. webworks).  I do not know what license they are under though.   It would be far easier to integrate these then to write new ones.
[[User:Juliusross|Juliusross]]

Someone should put some excersises in Further integration techniques

== Table of Contents vs. Outline ==

Hey folks, great to see this wikibook. It looks like it will be a great help once I start my calc classes this summer. On the front page, it is very easy to skip over the line that tells the user to go to the outline page. I missed that line the first time I looked at the book, and only saw it when I came back a couple of hours later. Originally I was a bit disappointed - thinking the book had almost no content yet (b/c TOC links are dead). Perhaps the TOC could be replaced by the outline? at least until a new updated TOC is developed... David March 30, 2005

* I would agree. The outline, as it stands, makes a better main page than the main page does. [[User:The Grimm Ripper|Grimm]]

* ...and unless someone comes along and disagrees I'm going to start moving things. [[User:The Grimm Ripper|Grimm]] 01:19, 30 Apr 2005 (UTC)


* what is the difference between this page and the &quot;development outline&quot; page?

== New Main Page ==

I've begun reworking the main page from the [[Calculus/Outline|outline]]. I've changed Template:Calculus:TOC to a navigation template with links to the main pages of the major sections. Thus far the section pages only have links to articles but they should have introductions to / brief discussions of the subject matter eventually.

I've added dead links to section pages of exercises on each section page. I used the naming convention 'Calculus:[section name]:Exercises' for consitency it would seem natural to use 'Calculus:[section name]:Solutions' for the corresponding pages of solutions.[[User:The Grimm Ripper|Grimm]] 01:03, 1 May 2005 (UTC)

:Pages orphaned by the reorginization (struck out where useful information has already been removed):
:*Chapter 1 - [[Calculus/Limits_and_their_Properties/Contents|Limits and their Properties]]
:*&lt;s&gt;Chapter 2 - [[Calculus/Differentiation/Contents|Differentiation]]&lt;/s&gt;

== Just a note of thanks ==

Thanks to all those who worked on creating this Wikibook.  I'm finding it quite useful for refreshing my memory of calculus.  It's great to have this available, and editable, and of such good presentation and apparent quality.  Thanks! [[w:en:User:JesseW]] 07:37, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== A-level Mathematics ==

What are the restrictions on this section? Am I allowed to copy parts out of here and change it slighty to fit in with the [[A-level Mathematics]] module that I'm contributing to? -- [[User:Krackpipe|Krackpipe]]

== Downloadable books ==

Perhaps we should get this in a downloadable form and attach extra chapters for optional homework. Having it downloadable into pdf or pd form would increase the usefulness alot


It is a good idea but is not yet possible on wikibooks.

== Just saying hello ==

hello everyone I thought I'd say hi to everyone.  I'm going to add some stuff that seems to be missing like implicit Differentiation and some of the applications of integration. --[[User:Stranger104|Stranger104]] 14:51, 22 August 2005 (UTC)

== any prequist? ==

i dunno any calculus but i really want to learn it because all so many math stuff use it and gives amazing formulas i can understand, except i dunno how it is proved. so is this a introduction to beginners or intermiate stage? 

thanks -protecter

:It will probably work as an introduction for people who have not seen any calculus before.  Prerequisite would  be  algebra and maybe some trigonometry.

::There are many prerequisites to Calculus that you must have a firm grasp of before you may continue. Algebra must be perfect, you must also be comfortable with trig, logs, exponentials, systems of linear equation, polynomial division, functions/funcational notation and their analysis and time and patience enough to being actually learning math.

== Little More explanation? ==

I find it impossible to self teach yourself calculus from this book since whenever it comes up with an equation it doesn't explain how to come up with the equation in the first place. (for example: the first paragraph of the second precalculus chapter, 'x is an element of' notation also needs some more explanation. I think as i go on i'll just find more stuff that needs more explanation to be understandable.) --[[User:V2os|V2os]] 21:48, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</text>

*'''Keep'''. &quot;Just keep it anyway&quot; doesnt strike me as being particularly persuasive, but I think these materials serve as a valuable historical record that could be used in the upcoming [[History of Wikibooks]] book.

:*'''Comment''' Why would voting pages have any historical value? If the historical use of BOTM and COM on this project are recorded in the History of Wikibooks book, then why would there be any need to keep them around for determining precedent? What prevents featured books from being used in determining precedent and as a foundation for future decision-making? Featured books replaces both BOTM and COM, so is unlikely to be restarted in the future, and even if they were started again, I don't see past votes needing to be kept around for that to happen. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 11:56, 20 April 2007 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' - I think this is a terrible idea.  To begin with, what real harm is done by keeping these pages?  They certainly are a part of the history of Wikibooks, and there is no need to free up hard drive space on the servers keeping Wikibooks content.  The historical value is to see just where the BOTM and COM have been useful and perhaps why they failed to succeed in terms of what the original goals of those two projects were for Wikibooks.  Certainly patterns of usage by those who participated in the votes is something that would be useful to look over if anything like this is suggested in the future.  It will be important to see the original pages if this is to happen.  Instead, I would strongly recommend that the pages are hard protected (sysop only) against changes precisely because of the historical value as opposed to any sort of normal content pages.  And they should be kept in the Wikibooks namespace as they are project related pages and not something content related as well.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 07:24, 22 April 2007 (UTC)

I've been looking at this book because a merger has been proposed between this and the [[Calculus]] book. This book contains absolutely no instructional material, consisting of little more then learning objectives, redirects to various algebra books, and tests of comprehension (which are mostly on the subject of algebra, not calculus). I would suggest a transwiki to wikiversity, except I dont think there is anything here of value enough to be worth the effort. Plus, I think wikiversity has a better page on calculus anyway. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] ([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) 20:30, 14 May 2007 (UTC)

I want to start out here that I defended the original author of this book, arguing that he should be given the chance to try and develop this, so far as when it was originally marked for speedy deletion he had only just started writing it.  This author did give it a strong attempt, but I have some serious problems with keeping it on Wikibooks.

The primary problem with this book is that it can be seen as a sort of advertisement for some software that the primary author of this page is trying to get people to use, and that this can also be seen as original research.  I also have expressed huge doubts about the claims of this author that you can make any profit off of his investing methods... well, read the talk page to see the discussion.

This author has had plenty of time to try and make something coherent and more &quot;textbook like&quot;, and the last edit that wasn't maintenance or vandalism was back in February 2006.  This together with the soapbox-like flavor to the content, and even broken external links make me think the time has come to delete this book.  I'll leave a comment on the author's talk page, but he doesn't seem to be active any more with Wikibooks either.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 12:41, 22 May 2007 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' This page was previously nominated for VfD back in January 2006, but the discussion was not archived (it was moved to the discussion page of the book). I voted to delete then, and I will vote to delete again now. I have no problem with keeping a controversial book around with the hopes that it will become acceptable, but as Rob pointed out in the nomination, this book has simply not become acceptable (and is unlikely to ever become so). --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] ([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) 13:45, 22 May 2007 (UTC)
*:By way of historical information, the reason I objected to the deletion earlier was mainly because it was a brand new book by a new contributor.  That is no longer the case and is not a rationale to keep this sort of material.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 07:08, 27 May 2007 (UTC)

I found this book while cruising around on the &quot;Random Book&quot; link. This book has essentially no content, and appears to have been that way for over a year and a half now. There have been a number of edits to this page from multiple users, but most of those edits are: vandalism, removing vandalism, adding and removing the {{tl|stub}} template, categorizing, etc. I think it's a good idea, after a year and a half, to just delete small stubs like this and offer future options a fresh start. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] ([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) 19:59, 22 May 2007 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' - If there was anything substantial here, and I mean anything at all.... even suggested &quot;titles&quot; for people in different positions; such as a Senator, Member of Parliment, The Queen of England, etc.; I would be encouraging this to remain a stub.  As it is, there is nothing here at all that isn't painfully obvious to anybody who has ever written a letter before, and Microsoft Word or Open Office in their letter templates do a better job of explaining these details than this Wikibook.&lt;p&gt;I do have mixed feelings about deletion of book stubs, as I'm not convinced that unlike Wikipedia a book stub of just a single thought will ever be expanded into something more substantial.  A single sentence Wikipedia article ''will be'' expanded into a more complete article eventually.  I can't say that about a &quot;book&quot; that is just a single sentence or two.  The question is how far do you go to call something a stub.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:30, 30 May 2007 (UTC)
*:I'm thinking that perhaps this is an issue that is worth some serious and dedicated discussion, and not just a passing mention in an uneventful VfD. I agree with you that this issue isn't as cut-and-dry as it is on wikipedia, and that stubs that have no content are not likely to ever be expanded. Previous VfD's have shown that the community is pretty divided on the issue of stubs, although i think there is some prevaling opinion that &quot;really bad stubs&quot; or &quot;hopeless stubs&quot; or &quot;eternal stubs&quot; should be deleted. Precisely where those lines are drawn is open to much debate, and i'm sure several users will protest the deletion of ''any stub'' regardless of how hopeless they may be. We should bring this up on staff lounge, or maybe even start drafting some kind of stub guideline. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 17:57, 30 May 2007 (UTC)

I propose that [[Classical_Mechanics/Introduction]] be deleted and some (emphasis on ''some'') of its content be moved to the opening page of the Classical Mechanics book.  The reason for this is that I feel that the introduction is much too long to be useful in introducing anyone to the topic of classical mechanics.  Mostly this is because the number of examples given is unnecessarily extensive.  I think its too much to ask of a reader to go through that much reading without learning any actual content of classical mechanics.

Finally, I think Amicus has intentionally or unintentionally &quot;adopted&quot; the book in his (her?) own right, writing in first person and signing each page with his own name. Without any intention of slighting Amicus and his contributions to the Classical Mechanics book, is this really appropriate?  Wikibooks are a community effort, at least in principle (I certainly look forward to contributing where I can in the future).--[[User:Snowsand|Snowsand]] 08:15, 13 May 2007 (UTC)

:{{comment}} First off, content pages should not be signed. Authors are recorded in the contribution history pages, and authors can list their names on the talk pages if they really want some additional publicity. Second, books generally need introduction pages, so I dont think that we need to delete this page outright. If you want to change this page, '''be bold''' and make changes! Remove information that does not belong, move material that should be moved, and make this page a proper introduction.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==1.  Reform in Reality: How can educators' good ideas actually be implemented in the real world?==

All one has to do to know that educators have good ideas is to sit in on one class meeting of ECI 841.  We have wonderful ideas about how to making learning interesting for children and relevant to their lives, about how to devise authentic assessments that will truly reflect the level of students' knowledge, and about reforming policy so that teacher and student alike will find fulfillment in the educational process.  The question is, Just how good are these ideas if they do not go behond the classroom walls of ECI 841?  The answer to this question is, Not much, and for this reason I've chosen&quot;reform in reality&quot; as my most important change issue.  The first discussion question in the wiki I wrote with Frank Stonier on the topic Curriculum and Instruction Reform:  Making America Competitive in a Flat World deals with this issue.  In my answer to this question, I insist that teachers must work at all levels to acquire more power over their professions and their lives—in their classrooms, institutions, communities, and the political arena.  To do this, teachers must insist on better working conditions, become politically active on behalf of their own and their students' interests, cooperate and collaborate with their colleagues, promote curricular reform within their schools, reach out to their communities, and instill a sense of social justice in our students, empowering them to take charge of their learning and improve their lives.  Unless we do these things, all our brilliant ideas become empty talk. 


==2.  Moving up the Food Chain: Become comfortable with questioning our own / the system’s assumptions and traditions about the way education should work (Previously ranked as #1 by Frank Stonier)==

The first step in the process of effecting any reform is self-examination, and for this reason, I've chosen questioning our own assumptions about the educational system as my second most important change issue.  No matter how well-educated we are or how rich our life experience is, we all come to education with a relatively rigid, narrow set of expectations about how the system should work and how we as educators should function.  Especially because we are in the business of teaching, we must attempt to broaden our limited notions of the possibilities of education and to take advantage of the many opportunities for change and improvement that come our way.  A recent example of one of these opportunties is the chance to use technology to enhance both our teaching and our students' learning.  Web 2.0 affords us vast resources for exploring new content and using new methods of acquiring and increasing knowledge; we owe it to ourselves and to our students to explore and become adept at employing these new resources.  In so many ways, our educational system has become obsolete; its methods were perhaps effective in the previous two centuries, but they are ineffectual in the twenty-first.  Most of us have been conditioned to accept and to conform to traditional educational standards, and questioning them tends to make us uncomfortable.  However, we need to examine our prejudices and expand our perspective so that we can envision an educational system consonant with a world that is constantly being reshaped by the forces of globalism, multimodalism, and multiculturalism.


==3.  Professionalizing the Teaching Profession: Teacher and Administrator Accountability and Effective Motivation==

In recent years, standards, training, and certification for teachers have become increasingly demanding and rigorous.  Public school teachers must have degrees in their content areas and take the education courses necessary to be certified to teach in those areas.  They must pass the Praxis exams and pursue coursework throughout their careers in order to remain certified.  As far as I know, no such requirements exist either for school administrators or for university professors.  Why then, despite all of the training and credentials they must acquire, are public school teachers often neither regarded nor treated as professionals?  Because I think this question needs to be addressed pointedly at at many levels, I've chosen it as my third most important change issue.  One part of the answer to it has to do with image.  Until recently, most teachers were not expected to have many qualifications beyond a bachelor's degree; the public perception simply has not yet caught up with the reality of the many new and often rigorous demands of teachers in terms of their academic qualifications and professional activities.  Another reason for their relatively low status has to do with political power.  When students do not perform well academically, the first person to be held accountable is the teacher.  However, teachers actually have relatively little power over their own working conditions and over many of the policies that determine their practices.  The final piece of this puzzle concerns the lack of motivation for teachers.  Teachers are generally not rewarded for asserting themselves as professionals or demanding changes within their profession; rather they are more likely to be praised by administrators for helping the system to run smoothly if not effectively.  Without monetary or other extrinsic incentives, teachers have little motivation to  promote their professionalization.  If this situation is to change, teachers must make major changes in their own attitudes and in their relationships with the systems of which they are a part.


==4.  The Digital Divide: The various issues that surround access to technology have a major impact on the extent to which and ways in which technology can be effectively employed in today’s educational system in American and beyond.==

It is generally ackowledged that technology can be a great boon to education, but we must be careful to avoid situations in which it contributes to rather than bridges the already large divide between haves and have-nots in this country.  For this reason, I've chosen the digital divide as my fourth most important change issue.  Access to technology remains a problem for our economically disadvantaged students, and they must not be further penalized as a result of this handicap.  The only way to begin leveling the playing field is to ensure that students have full access to technology in schools, but we still  have a long way to go in this respect.  In the public high school where I taught last year, there was only one computer per classroom—for the teacher's use; and students were not encouraged to use the few computers in the library before and after school.  Meanwhile, the well-to-do students went home to their large houses, flipped open their laptops, and proceeded to take full advantage of the educational resources at their fingertips.  In a capitalist society, the bottom line invariably divides the upper socioeconomic class from the lower.  If we can find a way to ensure ample technology access to economically deprived students, we can begin to use technology to bridge this gap rather than to widen it.  Through the Internet, these students can tap into the same resources available to their economically privileged counterparts.  However, technology costs money that schools in poorer neighborhoods do not have to spend.  Only reforms in school governance that make substantial funds available for technological improvements in these schools can fully address the current inequities in our educational system.


==5.  Individuality's Relationship to Isolation: Does the &quot;American way&quot; set us up for isolation?==

As a result of the cult of the individual and the related ideals of competition and economic success, a culture of isolation has become increasingly pervasive in our society.  A recent study revealed that a large percent of the population lack close friends, and within the last year the number of households occupied by single persons exceeded those with two or more.  The culture within our public school systems and universities mirrors this isolationism and alienation, and because I see this culture as not just counterproductive but downright harmful, I've chosen it as my fifth most important change issue.  Interestingly, a sort of primitive territoriality seems to dominate the practices of many teachers.  They close their classroom doors and regard any administrators, colleagues, or parents who might enter as a threat to their authority.  Of course, this is not entirely without cause; as a result of the way the system usually runs, visitors in the class rarely come to help and support—but they should.  Teachers and their students have so much to gain by communicating, cooperating, and collaborating with others in their community.  Moreover, they owe it to their students to help them reach out to and make contact with the wider world, and technology affords them the means to do this with relative ease.  Unfortunately, the system does little to encourage this practice; for example, the evaluation of teachers by administrators is often an empty and even alienating exercise rather than a true attempt by administration to support the teacher's efforts.  However, if teachers could collaborate with administrators and colleagues and invite parents to participate in the education of their children, everyone would benefit.  It should, in fact, be a mission of education to break down the barriers constructed as a result of the apathy, prejudice, and corruption of society.

The following was removed as a dubious claim, especially considering that ILCOR's paper claims that O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; isn't proven to be effective.
&lt;pre&gt;A patient whose lungs are full of pure oxygen can stay in apnea for nearly ''30 minutes'' (half an hour).
Thus, pure oxygen is a great help which will allow you to perform urgent duty and leave the patient for a few
minutes if necessary.&lt;/pre&gt;

== proposed chapter for advanced topics ==

I really like using D for Deadly Bleeding, as it reinforces that there needs to be a &quot;wet check&quot; (aka &quot;gross blood check&quot; or &quot;Rapid Body Survey&quot;). How do we feel about using D for that, and finding another way to integrate AED in another section. We could have a chapter on more advanced aspects of first aid, such as AED and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (which is currently included in [[First Aid/B for Breathing|B for Breathing]], which I don't like)?? So AED and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (and possibly some other stuff) would get moved to a chapter called &quot;Advanced First Aid Topics&quot; or something, and D would turn into a section on deadly bleeding, which would remove that section from [[First Aid/External Bleeding|External Bleeding]]. Comments? [[User:Mike.lifeguard|Mike.lifeguard]] 01:33, 24 June 2007 (UTC)

:ILCOR's protocol is clearly to use D for defibrillation as part of BLS, so we should use this, as we are keeping the entire book based on their procedures. [[User:Owain.davies|Owain.davies]] 20:35, 13 July 2007 (UTC)

::(Copied from MLs talk page) As for D for defibrillation, they do advocate further training, but they also clearly give ABCD with the D as defibrillation : See [http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/112/22_suppl/III-1 Part I: Introduction] of the ILCOR protocol, under &quot;The Universal Algorithm&quot;.   Even the title suggests that they are trying to get this adopted by everyone.  As we are following ILCOR so far as possible, there really is no option but to use this variant!

== B for breathing ==


I've been back and checked, and the protocols i added there are definitely correct.  The two rescue breaths were dropped in the last revision, as there is no clinical requirement for them - once cardio-respiratory arrest had taken place, the gases are stuck where they are (because no respiration can take place whilst there is no blood or pulmonary movement! - i.e. the blood is still full of oxygen until circulation and breathing start again.)

Rescue breaths are only appropriate for trauma and paeds.  In children, they are more likely to enter respiratory arrest only, making the use of breaths first to stimulate them to breathe on their own appropriate.  For trauma, due to the mechanism, the gases are likely to be used up as the body struggles to keep going.  For this reason, the number was upped to five.

As for the hand on the chest, i find that to be the most reliable of the indicators for breathing when in a stressful situation.

On that basis, i have reverted back to my edits (although fixed the spelling!)

As I noted on your talk page, [http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/vol112/22_suppl/ ILCOR] [http://lifesavingsociety.com/PDF/98CPR-Insert-Lifeliner2006.pdf LSS] and [http://www.americanheart.org/downloadable/heart/1132621842912Winter2005.pdf AHA] disagree with the protocols you've put here.

== ILCOR/AHA only, or include regional standards? ==

[[User:Owain.davies|Owain.davies]], let's finish discussing this issue before making changes. I reverted to the previous version, which is correct - it includes ERC and ILCOR/AHA protocols. The issue here is whether we're going to go strictly by what ILCOR says or whether we're going to include notes about regional differences. I think it's entirely appropriate to include regional differences from ILCOR's protocols. However, you seem to be misinterpreting the CoSTR. As you know, the AHA hosted the conference in Dallas; they also interpreted the standards. Instead of a dense technical paper aimed at the resuscitation community, the AHA published a concise interpretation aimed at those implementing the changes.

The only citation you gave for ILCOR wanting EMS to be called after checking breathing is the diagram for the universal algorithm. Unfortunately, the text of the document contradicts the algorithm on that exact issue. Luckily for us, we don't have to guess at whether the diagram is correct or whether it's an oversimplification and instead we're supposed to implement what's in the text of the paper. The AHA has already done that for us, and it turns out that the universal algorithm you cited was an oversimplification.

It should be noted that the CoSTR is not technically a set of protocols - the ERC went in a different direction on several major points, which is their right. And those differences are highlighted for people in those areas. So far as I know, the rest of the ILCOR member councils followed ILCOR's lead though. It makes sense that the modules should reflect the consensus (from ILCOR, as interpreted by AHA if need be) and any deviation from that (ERC standards) should be highlighted in boxes as is done currently. I don't see how that's a problem.

:I can't find anywhere in the text that contradicts it (except for paeds where summon ems comes after a round of CPR).  The AHA, ERC and the others all make their own decision based on ILCORs consenus.  I think that including regional variations is confusing for any potential rescuers as it intimates that you should do things differently in different places (and also weakens the rationale for any given procedure).  For that reason, i think you were right in the first place, and we should undertake to follow the original ILCOR text (regardless of whether adopted by all or any of the member councils), as these guidelines will be good, understandable and based on sound science, without confusing any potential reader.

:On this basis we should:
*Change to D for defibrillation
*Move to Call for help after unconscious and call for ems after breathing (except paeds)
*Keep the 2 initial breaths in for adults

:If we keep within one set of protocols, we can manage a clear document, based on the outputs of the highest authority (rather than regional variations). [[User:Owain.davies|Owain.davies]] 06:39, 17 July 2007 (UTC)

::Here's one contradiction, on the same page:
{{TextBox|The links in the [adult] Chain of Survival are early recognition of the emergency and activation of the emergency medical services (EMS) system, early CPR, early defibrillation, and early advanced life support, including postresuscitation care. The links in the infant and child Chain of Survival are prevention of conditions leading to cardiopulmonary arrest, early CPR, early activation of the EMS system, and early advanced life support.}}
::You'll notice that EMS comes before CPR for adults and after CPR for children and infants.
::They also noted on the same page that the Universal Algorithm diagram is not to be taken literally:
{{TextBox|Inevitably modification will be required in some situations, and these exceptions are highlighted elsewhere in this document.}}
::They also require training for AED use by lay responders, which would require keeping in Advanced Topics:
{{TextBox|Use of AEDs by trained lay ... responders is recommended to increase survival rates in patients with cardiac arrest. Use of AEDs in public settings (airports, casinos, sports facilities, etc) where witnessed cardiac arrest is likely to occur can be useful if an effective response plan is in place. The response plan should include equipment maintenance, training of likely responders, coordination with local EMS systems, and program monitoring.}}

::If you want to follow what ILCOR's paper recommends, I suggest you read it in-depth, since you've already made several errors of fact.
:*&lt;s&gt;Change to D for defibrillation&lt;/s&gt; Not supported by ILCOR
:*&lt;s&gt;Move to Call for help after unconscious and call for ems after breathing (except paeds)&lt;/s&gt; Also not supported by ILCOR
:*Keep the 2 initial breaths in for adults {{Done}}
::That's what we have already. If you want to keep ERC protocols, go ahead - I think it's a good idea. &lt;sarcasm&gt;But now that you've pushed so hard to accept only what ILCOR's paper says, I'm sure you'll want to throw those out the window, right??&lt;/sarcasm&gt; ''' &amp;ndash; [[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]''' | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:26, 17 July 2007 (UTC)

:::&lt;irony&gt; my errors of fact? &lt;/irony&gt; let me point you in the correct direction.  
:::*Change to D for defibrillation - Supported by ILCOR where is says &quot;Defibrillation is both a BLS and ALS skill&quot;
:::*Move to call for help after unconscious and ems after breathing - in black and white on the text.  You're saying that EMS comes before CPR - exactly right and what i've been saying.  Before CPR, not before breathing checks. The only 'variation' it points to in the whole document is for paeds, where is CPR before calling.  The important first step to the chain of survival is 'recognition of the emergency' - i.e. you must recognise that they are not breathing before moving to stage two.  Elementary my dear Mike.
:::*Keep to 2 breaths - all fine, we can agree (it's called compromise - i can see that ILCOR varies to the ERC protocol and therefore will accept it.  Now if you'd just accept that ILCOR varies to your AHA protocol in some places too, we could get on with it)

:::They do intend the universal algorithm to be taken literally, with an exception for paeds.  We should teach one system to avoid confusion, and keep with the ILCOR guidelines.  Stop trying to force your regional variation on it! [[User:Owain.davies|Owain.davies]] 17:18, 17 July 2007 (UTC)

::::'''EMS:''' I think we're using the same words to mean different things. CPR is open airway-check breathing-2 breaths-30 compressions-repeat. You're using CPR to mean 30 compressions-2 breaths-repeat. I'm pretty sure that they want EMS to come before the BLS sequence of ABC. AHA standards ''don't'' vary from ILCOR. If you're interested, I checked in ''Critical Care and Resuscitation'' for the standards from the ANZCR, I checked the RCSA standards, I checked HSFC standards, and I checked the standards for IAHF, and they have all disagreed with your interpretation on this point. Everyone else seems to think that ILCOR's paper says to activate EMS before even starting ABCs for adults. If the founding members of ILCOR agreeing on a single interpretation (with one exception - ERC, but they didn't follow ILCOR on several major points) isn't clear enough for you to accept it, I'm not sure what would be. ''The only regional variation from call first is from the ERC.'' Since you're so committed to ''not'' including regional variations, you should delete those regional notes highlighting ERC protocols.
::::'''AED:''' AED may be part of BLS, and I think that's great. But the treatment recommendations from the CoSTR ''specifically'' say that additional training is required and go on to outline how PAD programs should be set up... which includes training of responders (''Circulation'' Volume 112, Issue 22 Supplement; November 29, 2005; Page 18; 1st column; under ''Treatment Recommendations''). Perhaps in light of that, we should rename the chapter to Primary Assessment &amp; CPR for clarity. But certainly we need to recognize that specific additional training is required, and reflect that in the text.
::::'''2 breaths:''' Keep to 2 breaths - of course. Please delete the ERC variations.

:I've had a busy couple of weeks, so i've not been here, but i'm back and i've been doing some checking.  I have to say i think you are slightly misguided.  CPR is simply the process of compressions and ventilations - it doesn't include the checking.  The ILCOR guidelines are clear (and these respected doctors and scientists don't make it up for fun).  As for the other societies, i'm having real difficulties finding their guidelines on the internet (so if you have links that would be appreciated), but i'm sceptical - ILCOR is clear and made up of the opinion of its members.  You can't reach that sort of consensus with just 1 member agreeing!  Until you can present actual evidence, the call for ambulance must stay after the breathing check.

::::*AHA:
{{TextBox|For the unresponsive adult, the lay rescuer sequence of action is as follows:

* The lone rescuer should telephone the emergency response system and retrieve an AED (if available). The rescuer should then return to the victim to begin CPR and use the AED when appropriate.
* The lay rescuer should open the airway and check for normal breathing. If no normal breathing is detected, the rescuer should give 2 rescue breaths.
* Immediately after delivery of the rescue breaths, the rescuer should begin cycles of 30 chest compressions and 2 ventilations and use an AED as soon as it is available.

For the unresponsive infant or child, the lay rescuer sequence for action is as follows:

* The rescuer will open the airway and check for breathing; if no breathing is detected, the rescuer should give 2 breaths that make the chest rise.
* The rescuer should provide 5 cycles (a cycle is 30 compressions and 2 breaths) of CPR (about 2 minutes) before leaving the pediatric victim to phone 911 and get an AED for the child if available. The reasons for immediate provision of CPR are that asphyxial arrest (including primary respiratory arrest) is more common than sudden cardiac arrest in children, and the child is more likely to respond to, or benefit from, the initial CPR.}}
::::*HSFC and IAHF collaborated with AHA on those standards, and simply reference the paper in ''Circulation''. HSFC publishes their standards in print; IAHF standards are in Spanish, but are identical to the AHA standards, because... they ''are'' the AHA standards.

I agree that the ANZCR and RCSA standards give to call the ambulance before checking breathing.  However, that first ILCOR quote and the AHA one do not lead to believe that.  It says to call before commencing CPR, not before checking breathing.  CPR is ONLY the performance of breaths of compressions.  This therefore backs up the universal algorithm diagram given.  As for the AHA, i think they mean the same thing because you wouldn't see that the patient was unresponsive and then immediately leave to get an AED - that verges on criminal negligence.  If they were able to breathe on their own and just needed their airway opened, then you've effectively just killed them by going away to get something you didn't need, where the recovery position would have been adequate.

In conclusion the ILCOR text matches the diagram perfectly, and the AHA guidance is either poorly written (because it causes confusion) or just negligent.  [[User:Owain.davies|Owain.davies]] 17:36, 30 July 2007 (UTC)

:Your concern about leaving a victim with a closed airway to get an AED and activate EMS is appropriate - first aiders should move the victim into the semi-prone position so that the airway is protected while they're gone. This applies whether they're breathing or not, so checking ''before'' activating EMS is an unnecessary delay.
:The reason I think that ILCOR meant CPR to mean what I said is that they go on to describe it that way. They say, in essence, &quot;If your victim isn't responsive, call 911&quot; and then go on to describe CPR as &quot;Open the airway, check breathing...&quot; The AHA does the same thing (including in the quote you though wasn't clear on that issue), and makes it abundantly clear in their candidate- and instructor-level resources (for example, the ones posted in [[First Aid/Appendix C: Sources]]) The quote I gave from the AHA above says &quot;The lone rescuer should telephone the emergency response system and retrieve an AED (if available). The rescuer should then return to the victim... The lay rescuer should open the airway and check for normal breathing. If no normal breathing is detected, the rescuer should give 2 rescue breaths. Immediately after delivery of the rescue breaths, the rescuer should begin cycles of 30 chest compressions and 2 ventilations.&quot; Does that not ''clearly'' mean that they want rescuers to call EMS, then open the airway, check for breathing and (if the victim isn't breathing normally) give 2 rescue breaths?? I think it does mean that.
:The ILCOR text only matches their diagram because you're misreading it that way. Similarly, you've misread the AHA's position; they've endorsed all the programs which have produced the resources I'm going from - resources which make this issue abundantly clear. Again, all the founding members except ERC thought that the CoSTR wanted EMS to be activated before starting ABCs, so the most of the experts responsible for interpreting the document agree with what I've been saying here.

::Without meaning to be flippant, do you think it is more likely that the highly learned doctors and scientists of ILCOR released this paper with the consistent message which i am reading out of this document (and you still haven't come up with any repudiation of from the ILCOR document itself) or do you think its more likely that this respected, pier reviewed group decided to give two different sets of instructions in their paper!  Even less likely is that this is an oversight (as it would have been picked up and ammended as one of the published erratum).  I'm sorry Mike, but the ILCOR document follows my interpretation only.  If some of the member societies chose to ignore this part (as they chose to ignore other parts) then so be it, but the ILCOR guideline is unequivocal.

__FORCETOC__
== Early Life ==
Elizabeth Cady was born in 1815 to Daniel and Mary Livingston Cady, a prestigious family of Johnstown, NY. One of Elizabeth's early memories was that her parents didn't seem to want girl children, especially after Elizabeth's sister was born. This probably had something to do with Stanton's ideas later in life. 


== Education ==
Cady attended Johnstown Academy and while there studied Greek and Mathematics. Her other achievements were learning to ride a horse and quickly showed her father that she could debate. In 1830, after graduating from the academy, she attended Troy Female Seminary, which was the only school to offer an education equivalent to a boy's school.

Elizabeth frequently went to court with her father, who was a distinguished lawyer. Elizabeth was quite unnerved to see the law function, since it was very unfair to women. During these observations she met Henry Stanton and in 1840 they were married.

I think the explanation of why foldr can work on infinite lists and why foldl can't should be re-worded.  As a beginner, it took me *forever* to figure out what this was talking about,and the whole time I thought that the reverse of what was being said was actually true.  For example, in the foldl example, it's not obvious what is meant by &quot;going to the end of the list&quot;.  What a beginner (e.g. myself) is going to think is that it's not going to the end of the list at all.  Furthermore, the part about combining the initial value with the final element of the list is completely counterintuitive, because the derivation proceeds from (((1 - 4) - 8) - 5) to (((-3) - 8) - 5) which is combining the initial value with the first value of the list. The only way i was finally able to see what this explanation was talking about is by writing the entire derivation in pre-fix notation. (-) ((-) ((-) 1 4) 8) 5.  When it's written like this, it's much clearer that foldl would have to evaluate an infinite list before having a concrete value for the first argument.

I also think the foldr vs foldl efficiency note is very confusing.  I'm very much a haskell newbie, but I've pondered over it forever, and the only case where I can figure it might make a bit of difference is when your fold is outputting a list.  If your fold is outputting a single value, I don't think it matters what kind of fold you use—if your list argument is infinite, you're doomed.  Personally I would leave this whole note out, but it could also be clarified.  --Jonah

== Compatibility issue - GHC ==

On GHCi 7.4.1 (on Ubuntu 12.10) Char.toUpper is not in scope.  One must use Data.Char.toUpper instead.  To run GHCi in Haskell 98 (and force Char.toUpper into scope) compatibility mode, use:
    $ ghci -package haskell98 -hide-package base
Maybe this is noted elsewhere and I missed it.

Magnus,

Yes the University suddenly stopped allowing me to have the pages there.
I sitll have the originals.    Someone recently asked me, and is putting up
the site again (I think in Australia).

I have the images and you are free to use them under any license you
would like. 

I also sent the protein-transport, Na-K-Pump, and protein-gates.  I also have ER,
cholesterol, golgi images.

I hope that helps.
