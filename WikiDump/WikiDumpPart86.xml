      <text xml:space="preserve">It could be a good idea to mention http://forlong.blogage.de/entries/pages/Compiz-Switch as a simple way to enable and disable compiz.

== Ubuntu/Compiz ==

The issue described in the text seems not to be there anymore. I've never had any problems though compiz was enabled.

: I’ve added a note about applicable versions, based on the date of your comment. Anybody with more accurate info is free to correct it :). [[User:Ldo|Ldo]] ([[User talk:Ldo|talk]]) 02:14, 5 September 2010 (UTC)

== Microsoft Windows/Two Ways to Launch Blender ==

Using Win7 with the &quot;Classic&quot; GUI, two distinct buttons appear in the Quick Launch Bar when opening Blender from its icon. The first is &quot;(drive):\blender&quot; and the second is simply &quot;Blender. Accordingly, the Blender console appears first and remains open upon initializing the program, then the GUI window opens.
[[User:Mtjlt|Mtjlt]] ([[User talk:Mtjlt|talk]]) 16:04, 20 October 2010 (UTC)
:It's not clear to me how the two buttons differ, if at all.  Can you clarify? --[[User:Stepheng3|Stepheng3]] ([[User talk:Stepheng3|talk]]) 21:03, 20 October 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is me, Nigel.  I'm a retired teacher/lecturer.

Did an honours degree in Maths at London University in the early 60's.  Started teaching maths in 1965.  After a few years as HoD in a large comprehensive, left teaching for a spell, but went back in 1987, into FE this time, teaching maths and computing, where I ended up as Course Team Leader for HND/C Computing.  Partly retired from teaching in 2003, and finished altogether in 2007. (Phew!)

I've developed a fair bit of teaching material over the years at all levels from GCSE/First Diploma to HND.  Mostly Maths, but also odd computing topics.  Hope to make a useful contribution to Wikibooks, especially in the first instance to Discrete Mathematics.</text>

Corned beef pie is a traditional British pie. It can be eaten hot or cold, making it good for picnics and also as a 'winter warmer'.

Allegedly in Australia, corned beef pie (generally made with potato and tinned corned beef) is one of the few exclusively and iconic British foods consumed at picnics and similar events, being almost unknown to any group except British ex patriots, being especially favoured by Scots!


==Ingredients==
To serve between six and eight:

* 12oz (340g) self raising [[Cookbook:flour|flour]]
* 3oz (85g) [[Cookbook:lard|lard]]
* 3oz (85g) [[Cookbook:margarine|margarine]]
* 1 large tin of corned [[Cookbook:beef|beef]]
* 1 large [[Cookbook:onion|onion]]
* 1lb (450g) [[Cookbook:potato|potato]]
* Knob of [[Cookbook:butter|butter]]
* [[Cookbook:milk|Milk]]
==Procedure==
# Pre-heat the oven to 200°C (400°F, GM 6)
# Sift the flour into a bowl
# Rub in the lard and margarine
# Add enough water to bind the mixture
# Roll out &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; the mixture and use it to line a large flan or quiche dish
# Chop the onion
# Boil the Potatoes
# Drain, add the butter and mash
# Add the chopped onion and corned beef
# Spoon corned beef mixture into the lined dish
# Roll the other &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of the pastry mixture
# Lay it over the dish sealing at the edges, forming a lid to the pie
# Cut some slits in the top of the lid
# Brush with a little milk
# Cook until golden brown (about 35/40 minutes)

Serve with vegetables, gravy, chips, peeled plum tomatoes, waffles, anything you like really.

Enjoy.

'''Betty's Salad''' is a regional, Midwest salad created by Betty Timko and featured as a menu item at her restaurant, Timko's Soup and Such, in Toledo, Ohio.  The restaurant was located in a brick building at the northwest corner of Sylvania and Douglas Roads of the Devaux Village strip mall in West Toledo [http://www.toledotalk.com/cgi-bin/tt.pl/article/3620/Timkos_Soup__Such].  After Betty died, the restaurant closed, and her signature salad dressing is still produced and distributed at regional grocery stores. &lt;br /&gt;


== Salad and Salad Dressing Ingredients ==

'''Salad Ingredients'''
''Layer salad ingredients in order listed below.''
# Half package spinach
# 6 hard boiled eggs, sliced
# 1 can bean sprouts, drained
# 1-2 cans water chestnuts, drained and sliced (optional, depending on the recipe you follow)
# 1 pound fried bacon, crumbled
   
'''Salad Dressing'''
* 1 cup salad oil
* 3/4 cup sugar
* Salt to taste, or 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 1/3 cup catsup
* 1/4 cup white vinegar
* 1 tablespoon Worcestershire Sauce
* 1 small to medium sized onion

Mix dressing in blender and pour over salad.
     
Keep all ingredients refrigerated.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|How can mobile devices enable citizen journalism?}}

Mobile devices are part of the emergent media technologies that challenged the mass media principles and changed the face of professional journalism. Such mobile devices as cell phones were the most popular media in 2007, according to McGill Professor of Communication Studies J. Sterne.&lt;ref&gt;Professor Jonathan Sterne. Lecture Sept. 5, 2007. McGill University.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the widespread of cell phones and their popular use in journalism raises two important issues: ethical and political. While the mobile devices open the whole new world of possibilities for the majority of people, the users of the mobile devices often do not know what responsibilities they have if any when contributing to citizen journalism.

==Ethical Issues==
One of the challenges “cell phone journalists” face is the fact that there is no common ethics for everyone to follow. Consider two examples from picturephoning.com. A student used a cell phone to capture his teacher beating another student in front of his classmates in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;The news from March 3, 2007. http://www.textually.org/picturephoning/archives/cat_happy_slappingviolence.htm &lt;/ref&gt; Or, a rape video of eleven-year-old girl has been circulated around her neighbourhood in Detroit until her parents heard about it and reported it to the police.&lt;ref&gt;The news from February 16, 2007, http://www.textually.org/picturephoning/archives/cat_happy_slappingviolence.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In the first case, a cell phone video was shown on TV to hold the teacher accountable for her actions. In the second case, the video has been used as degrading pornography and has been deleted by one of the rapists before the police could see it. When it comes to record and see a cell phone video of a crime, citizens have to make a moral choice: to record or not to record, to watch or not to watch. Because the moral standards vary in different individuals and different societies, there is no simple way of regulating the use of mobile devices in citizen journalism.

==Political Issues==
Moreover, if one restricts the ways in which people can use their cell phones, it will be no longer possible for the citizen activists to have any significant impact on the politics. The current advantage of the mobile devices is that they allow questioning the one-way, producer-to-consumer, communication of the mass media. Because cell phones are multifunctional and relatively cheap, people can pass the news, be it in a video or a sound format, across their networks of friends and the whole community in a twinkle of an eye. In his article “Will the Revolution be Cybercast?”, T. V. Reed describes how the human rights activists from all over the world used cell phones not only to record the behavior by the police during the Battle of Seattle, but also to coordinate the blockades. However, by the end of the article, the author questions the minorities’ lack of access to the same technologies as well as the reasons behind the non-local activists’ amateur journalism.&lt;ref&gt;T. V. Reed. “Will the Revolution be Cybercast? New Media, the Battle of Seattle and Global Justice”. Ch.9, The Art of Protest: Culture and Activism from Civil Rights Movement to the Streets of Seattle. University of Minnesota Press: Mineapolis MN, 2005. Pp. 240-285&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, if cell phones were as powerful as to hold the police and the governments accountable, we would already have a law restricting the use of these mobile devices.

==Future Implications==
As the tendency for the cell phones is to become fancier and fancier, the politics of the states and the phone companies are clearly in distracting citizens from the actual mobilization and grassroots activism. The smart phones with huge extra fees for special features like the GPS are a good example of how the rich and powerful privilege the access to “better citizen journalism devices” to white middle-class men with disposable income. Finally, aren’t we just being distracted by these “toys&quot; from the real politics and the moral choices we have to make as a society?&lt;ref&gt;Jodi Dean, “Communicative capitalism: the ideological matrix,” and “Neo-democracy” in Publicity’s Secret: How Technoculture Capitalizes on Democracy, 1-14; 151-175.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">DNA  Mircoarrays is a collection of genes that allows the study of gene expression in the biological response to further studies of the genome. Examples of the usage in mircoarrays are pathogen response to genetic  materials, mutant development in the genes, and the drug discovery. Mircoarrays can be used to study the gene expression of a certain disease and that analysis and data acquired from this method can be used to develop a complementary drug that can cure or suppress the disease. Although the development of DNA microarrays has facilitated many studies in the biology and chemistry, the analysis of microarrays can be difficult. Because there are so many genes in a cell the analysis of such large gene expression presented in the microarrays can be rather time consuming and difficult to analyze.

==History==

The history of microarrays is rather recent. The first array was created in the mid 1980s. It was first called Macro arrays. It was only used to spot DNA probes, but more of it was used for studies of DNA clones, PCR products and oligonucleotides. They were all used with radioactively labeled targets. After further studies, Micro arrays were developed; it was created by pin spotters. Pin spotters were pin based robotic system that can accurately dispense a certain amount of DNA solution into the spots on a glass slide. By the mid 1990s, the technology of the microarrays was used to mainly investigate  gene expressions. Some of the studies involved the gene expression profiles for tissues to study the life cycles of a bacteria. Also the study of cell division and which gene was responsible the different stages of cell division. Lastly, another application of microarrays is drug dosing, which can be effectively used to find the correct amount of drugs to use for a certain disease by examining the disease's gene expressions.

==Theory==

[[Image:Microarray.jpg|right|thumb|A simplified version of the microarray process]]

DNA microarrays can be used to explore thousand of sequence of gene in a single run. The fundamental basis of DNA microarray is based on the process of hybridization. The level of hybridization can be detected by the level of detectable chemical level, which is used to mark the target or the probe sequence in the experiment.
DAN micrarrays or gene chip, which is high-density array of oligonucleotides, can be built either with light directed chemical synthesis conducted by the photolitographic microfabrication technique used by the semiconductor industry or by putting very small dots of oligonucleotides or cDNA on a solid support such as microscope slide. The expression of the gene level is revealed by the fluorescence level of the cDNA which is hybridized to the chip, which can be identified by the known location on the chip. The extent of the transcription of a particular gene can be seen by the intensity of the fluorescent spot on the chip.
This method can be used to detect the variation in expression level shown by specific genes under different growth conditions

A somewhat simpler picture of gene chip theory begins with the goal. The purpose of this technique is to be able to qualitatively determine the amount of a certain mRNA fragment expressed by a gene. First, the mRNA is extracted from cells. The mRNA can then be turned into cDNA via reverse transcriptase, which is tagged with a fluorescent marker. That fluorescent cDNA is then added to a silicon (or glass) chip studded with lots of  DNA fragments (oligonucleotides). The gene chip, with all of its DNA fragments, contains one particular fragment which base-pairs perfectly to your desired cDNA (or hybridizes). The RNA/cDNA that don't match the gene chip are washed off (aww), and the gene chip is seen under a special light that allows the fluorescent cDNA to glow. If your mRNA was present in the cell, it can now be seen on the chip in pretty colors. If not, then that part of the chip is blank.  It is easy to see now how gene chips can be used to study gene expression by exploring its mRNA.  

An example of how one can use microarray testing in order to analyze RNA is in the case of cancerous skin cells. A microarray test can be done to see what genes in the cancerous skin cells are similar to healthy skin cells and which ones are different. This is done by taking a sample of mRNA from healthy skin cells and a sample of mRNA from cancerous skin cells. Both of the mRNA of these skin cells are converted into cDNA. The healthy cDNA can then be labeled with a green fluorescent marker. The cancerous cDNA can then be labeled with a red fluorescent marker. Then a microarray containing all of the DNA in a skin cell is made. The fluorescent cDNAs are then both put onto the microarray. The specific cDNA sequences then hybridize to the corresponding DNA on the microarray. The excess cDNA is then washed off. Then a laser is used to analyze where the fluorescent cDNA hybrizided. A computer takes this information and analyzes it giving several dots of color on a sheet indicating which genes are expressed by the healthy skin cell (which would show up as a green dot) and which are expressed by the cancerous skin cell (which would show up as a red dot). The yellow dots would indicate that the healthy and cancerous skin cell both express that certain gene. A black dot indicates that neither the healthy cell nor the cancerous skin cell expressed that gene. Thus by analyzing this data, one can find out what genes are expressed in cancerous skin cells that are not expressed in healthy ones.

=Applications=
Microarrays can be used for a variety of applications including analysis of genomic DNA, however, mRNA gene expression profiling dominates because of the amount of information we can get about the function of genes in cells and tissues using these two applications.

==Gene Expression Profiling==

[[Image:DNA microarray.svg|thumb|A microarray.]]

Expression profiling using microarrays identifies genes whose expression depends on a specific biological state. For example, the amount of gene mRNAs can be more abundant during a disease state biological condition than in a normal state. Genes expressed in the disease state can then be identified using microarrays. Drugs can then be made to specifically inhibit these genes. Microarrays can also be tack gene expression during cell development, during which genes are grouped according to their pattern of expression over different phases of development. This then helps to identify a gene of unknown function by associating it to a functional role of a known gene whose expression pattern is similar to the unknown gene. 

Pathway analysis can also be useful in identifying coordinated changes in expression affecting many genes at a time, which then helps us know the characterizing behavior of these genes that makes them act together to carry out a specific function. The detection of consistent changes in expression of a group of genes that have related function allows us to know the biological aspects that would otherwise not be known from gene expression analysis. 

Reconstruction of functional, regulatory networks from gene expression by reverse engineering techniques can also be used to characterize the relationship among genes starting from their expression values in different conditions. 

Another way we can use expression profiles is to use them as a fingerprint of a certain biological state by using the analysis of other hybridization experiments to identify common patterns of gene expression among samples with similar biological characteristics. This is useful in finding correlations between gene expression behavior and a phenotype.

==Analysis of Genomic DNA==
Analysis of genomic DNA is the other dominant microarray application. DNA microarrays can be used to directly measure the concentration of genomic DNA fragments from particular genomic regions. For example, microarrays can be applied in this way to scan changes in the gene copy number associated to cancer. 
	Another way microarrays can be used for genomic DNA analysis is to identify the complement of regulatory DNA sequences that are bound by transcriptional regulators. DNA microarrays can be used for a genome-wide identification of in vivo transcription factor binding sites by chromatin immunopercipitation (ChIP) coupled with array hybridization. The overlapping probes on the array yields complete genomic coverage and allows for the identification of all DNA binding regions for a specific transcription factor. 
	Analysis of genomic DNA using Microarrays can also be applied to characterize the presence of specific genetic sequences that can be used for parallel interrogation of pathogen genomes. This can then help us detect the presence of pathogens that cause infective diseases and we can monitor if they are in biological samples, for example, or food/water.
	Finally, analysis of genomic DNA using microarrays can be applied to genotyping. Microarrays can be designed for the genome-wide identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Microarray usage for this has contributed greatly to the human genome project regarding human SNPs data.  If one is interested in a particular list of known polymorphisms scattered throughout the genome, then probe sets can be designed just for them and chips can be used as a tool for rapid screening of biological samples. Chips were designed for this reason of detecting mutations in genes of interest to human health. 

==Data Analysis==

It can be difficult to interpret the data that comes out on the microarray analyzer because there are many factors that can effect the accuracy of the data. The difficulty about getting clear results on the microarray is due to the fact that there are many different methods for normalizing the data of a microarray chip. Another factor to take into consideration is that the genes can produce false positives or false negatives because there are thousands of tests being run at the same time, which cause these errors. A false positive in this case would be concluding that a certain gene is expressed on the microarray when it really is not. A false negative would be concluding that the gene is not expressed on the microarray when it really is.

The statistical p-value is used in microarrays since there are these factors that effect the accuracy of the data. The p-value is the probability that the microarray results for a specific gene being hybridized to the DNA or not hybridized happened by chance alone. It is not accurate to treat the p-value as a statistic for an individual test when you are running a microarray since thousands of tests are being performed simultaneously. That is why one must adjust the p-value in order to account for this error. The Bonferroni correction is a statistical device that corrects the p-value making it more accurate.

Two additional statistical analysis that are useful for microarrays are

1. SAM (statistical analysis of microarrays)
This test helps determine which data acquired from the microarray is useful and which is not. It does this by running a bunch of t-tests and then calculates a value for each gene. This value represents the correlation between the strength of the gene expression and its response variable.

2. ANOVA (analysis of variance) 
This is a statistical test used for analyzing experiments when two or more variables are present.

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

Hey Raichu2,

Glad to see your edits on the Japanese wikibook and your note on the talk page. Feel free to ask if you have any more questions or requests for clarification. By the way, how did you come across the project, and do you have any particular areas that you'd like to work on? --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 12:37, 9 November 2008 (UTC)

[[User:Retropunk|Retropunk]] invited me on [http://lang-8.com Lang-8]. BTW how will you know that I have replied to you? [[User:Raichu2|Raichu2]] ([[User talk:Raichu2|talk]]) 19:38, 13 November 2008 (UTC)

: I have your talk page on my watchlist. You have [[Special:Watchlist|one too]]. On the default skin it's in the upper-right-hand-corner. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 04:39, 14 November 2008 (UTC)</text>

Hi. I'm currently teaching myself discrete mathematics, and have used several free resources so far. Of those, I think your writing on Wikibooks has made the most sense to me. You lay the material out so simply and eloquently, a grade school student could learn it. I just wanted to thank you for putting forth the effort. So, thanks.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Basics of Transcription==

Traewf
Transcription is similar to DNA replication in that DNA is used as a template to make a new nucleotide strand (RNA).  The newly synthesized RNA strands are complementary to the DNA template strand.

RNA polymerase uses ribonuceloside triphosphate (rNTP) to synthesize mRNA strands (rATP, rUTP, rCTP, and rGTP) in the 5'-&gt;3' direction.

Transcription can be broken down into 3 steps:

1. Initiation.  Transcription begins when RNA polymerase binds to a DNA region known as a promoter.  Additional transcription factors are required to hold the RNA polymerase to the correct region of the DNA.  After RNA polymerase binds to the promoter region, it melts 10-15 nucleotide base pairs around the transcription start site, allowing for rNTPs to bind to the template strand.  Initiation ends when the first rNTP is linked to RNA polymerase by a phosphodiester bond.  (Unlike DNA replication, no primer is needed)

2. Elongation: RNA polymerase leaves the start site and travels down the template in the 3'-&gt;5' direction.  The DNA helix opens ahead of RNA polymerase during this process due to helicase.

3. Termination: Rna polymerase releases from the DNA template strand and leaves DNA.

==Prokaryotic Transcription: Operons==

Transcription is very similar in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes in that there is an intiation step, elongation step, and termination step.  However, they also have their differences.

Prokaryotes contain operons while eukaryotes do not.  Operons are clusters of related genes involved in a similar function and are often found in a contiguous array.  Operons are controlled by a single promoter, and as a result, transcription produces 1 mRNA that can be translated into multiple proteins.  If there were no operons, there would have to be separate promoters for each gene.  Operons help make transcription more efficient; for example:

With Operon:

   |Promoter|Gene A|Gene B|Gene C|  ---transcription---&gt; mRNA ---translation---&gt; protein A + protein B + protein C

Without Operon:

   |Promoter|Gene A| ---transcription---&gt; mRNA A ---translation---&gt; protein A

   |Promoter|Gene B| ---transcription---&gt; mRNA B ---translation---&gt; protein B

   |Promoter|Gene C| ---transcription---&gt; mRNA C ---translation---&gt; protein C

While an operon provides the advantage of being able to initiate transcription at one point and transcribe many genes, it has its disadvantages as well.  One disadvantage is that if the promoter for the operon sequence is mutated, all the genes in the operon cannot be transcribed.

An operon consists of 3 parts:

 1. Structural Genes
 2. Promoter region
 3. Operator region

The structural gene encodes for proteins.  All structural genes will turn into a single mRNA that encodes for multiple proteins.

The promoter region is where RNA polymerase binds to DNA to initiate transcription.  Not all promoters will have the same sequence.  Strong promoters will have a similar nucleotide sequence as a known consensus sequence.  Weak promoters will have a different sequence.

The operator region is located next to, and overlaps with the promoter region.  It is the site where a repressor can bind.  When a represson binds to an operator, RNA polymerase will not be able to bind to the promoter, and as a result transcription will not occur.

'''Inducible Operons'''

An inducible operon is an operon where a substance is required to be bound before transcription will occur, it is normally &quot;off&quot; but when a substance binds it is turned &quot;on.&quot; The lac operon is an example of an inducible operon.  It encodes 3 enzymes involved in the metabolism of lactose.  The lac operon has 4 regions:

 1. CAP binding site: important to increase the rate of transcription of an operon
 2. Promoter: location where RNA polymerase binds
 3. Operator: location where a repressor binds
 4. Genes (ZYA): 
   Gene Z encodes for Beta-galactosidase, which breaks down lactose
   Gene Y encodes for galactosidase primase, a transporter protein that allows lactose to get into the cell
   Gene A encodes for galactosidase transacetylase

Bacteria prefer to metabolize glucose over lactose.  Given this fact, we can see three different scenarios:

1. No Lactose, High Glucose

If there is no lactose, the lac operon will not be turned on.  A repressor will bind to the operator which overlaps the transcription start site, preventing RNA polymerase from binding at the promoter, and thus preventing transcription of the lac operon.  This is important for bacteria to save energy.  Because they prefer to metabolize glucose, there is no need to turn on the lac operon in the presence of no lactose and high glucose.

2. High Lactose, High Glucose

Lactose will bind to the repressor, causing a conformational change that forces the repressor to unbind from the operator.  As a result, RNA polymerase can bind to the promoter and allows for transcription to occur, however, it is a weak transcription.

3. High Lactose, Low Glucose

Lactose will still bind to the repressor and force it to unbind from the operator (due to the high amount of lactose present).  However, the low glucose levels will cause an increase in cyclic AMP.  The increase in cAMP will bind to the CAP binding site.  This then increases RNA polymerase's binding to the promoter, resulting in high amounts of transcription.

'''Repressible Operon'''

A repressible operon is an operon that where transcription is normally &quot;on,&quot; but when a substance binds it turns &quot;off.&quot;  It is the opposite of an inducible operon.

The Trp Operon is an example of a repressible operon, and is involved in the synthesis of the essential amino acid tryptophan.  Tryptophan is either made, or obtained from the environment.  The Trp Operon is normally on, transcribing the RNA needed to synthesize tryptophan, however, in the presence of tryptophan (obtained from the environment), the operon is turned off in order to save energy.

==Prokaryotic Transcription: Transcription Factors (Sigma)==

The function of a transcription factor is to bring RNA polymerase and the promoter together.  It will bind to RNA polymerase and at the same time, associate with the DNA promoter.  Transcription factors exist in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.

An example of a prokaryotic transcription factor is the &quot;Sigma Factor.&quot;  The sigma factor is involved in locating RNA polymerase to the correct location.

==Eukaryotic Transcription: RNA Polymerase==

There are three different types of RNA Polymerase in eukaryotes:

 1. RNA polymerase I: makes rRNA
 2. RNA polymerase II: makes mRNA, miRNA, and splicing RNA
 3. RNA polymerase III: makes tRNA, rRNA, and splicing RNA

The structures of all three RNA polymerases are very similar and highly conserved.  The components include a site for rNTP to enter, and a site for phosphodiester bond formation.  RNA polymerase II contains an area known as the carboxy terminal domain (CTD), which is RNA pol II specific.  CTD is a string of seven amino acid repeats, which is found to repeat 52 times in vertebrates.  It is essential for viability, and RNA polymerase II cannot function without it.  Before transcription, CTD is non-phosphorylated, and after the initiation step of transcription, CTD becomes phosphorylated.

==Eukaryotic Transcription: Promoter, Proximal Promoters, and Enhancers==

The promoter tells the cell where to start transcription.  Transcription factors identify and bind to promoter regions, and also help to recruit RNA polymerases.

Proximal promoters and enhancers are both sites for transcription factors to bind as well.  Proximal promoters are about 200 base pairs upstream of the start site.  Enhancers are further away from the start site, and can be found up to 50,000 base pairs up or downstream of the site.

Promoter regions were identified through two different experiments: 5' deletion analysis and linker scanning analysis.

==Prokaryotic vs. Eukaryotic Transcription==

A few differences between Eukaryotic and Prokaryotic transcription include: Eukaryotes have multiple general transcription factors, lack operons, and have a genome packed into chromatin.  Prokaryotes on the other hand, have one general transcription factor, have operons, and have a genome located in plasmids.

Looking at and comparing the three steps of transcription between Prokaryotes and Eukaryotes:

1. Initiation: the binding of RNA polymerase to double-stranded DNA. 

For prokaryotes: RNA polymerase, in its complexity, contains a core that has to bind to the promoter region of the DNA template. Another subunit, known as sigma, is what makes this possible by finding and binding to the promoter region using lots of weak H-bonds with the base pairs (with the culmination of many weak H-bonding, a strong net force is seen). So, the RNA polymerase simply slides along the DNA, and it either finds a promoter, or dissolves and starts somewhere else. If it finds a promoter, it proceeds to unwind the DNA, which leads to elongation. Prokaryotes have two promotors sites located upstream of the first nucleotide to be transcribed. They are the Pribnow box, which is located 10 nucleotides upstream and has the sequence TATAAT and the -35 region which has the sequence TTGACA. 

For Eukaryotes: Eukaryotes are more complicated in their initiation phase. Firstly, the RNA polymerase doesn't randomly scale a DNA for promoter regions. Rather, transcription factors are used to create specific instances in the promoter regions for the RNA polymerase to bind to. In eukaryotic cells, there are also 3 different kinds of RNA polymerase, each that transcribes a different type of RNA. Once a RNA polymerase binds to its respective promoter region (equipped with transcription factors), it creates a transcription initiation complex, which traverses the DNA. Eukaryotes also have two promotor sites, one is called the TATA or Hogness box which is at location -25 and has the sequence TATAAA, and the CAAT box, which is located at -75 and has the sequence GGNCAATCT. Transcription is initated by stimulation by the enhancer sequence.

2. Elongation: the covalent addition of nucleotides to the 3' end of the growing polynucleotide chain. 

For prokaryotes: As the DNA is unwound, its base pairs are now available for binding. The first ribonucleoside triphospate (RNA building blocks) binds to it. The RNA polymerase loses its sigma subunit, leaving only the core. The unwound DNA sites provide sites for the RNA building blocks to H-bond to (in their correct base pair). Also, the triphosphates are used like train links, that covalently form phosphodiester bonds with each new RNA block.  

For Eukaryotes: As the complex moves across the DNA, it unzips it and allows for Watson-Crick base-pairing to occur with transient RNA building blocks, linking them together using phosphodiester bonds. 

3. Termination: the recognition of the transcription termination sequence and the release of RNA polymerase.

For prokaryotes: Elongation continues until it reaches a stop signal found on the DNA. The RNA polymerase core dissolves, and the DNA rewinds. The termination signal in E. Coli is a base-paired hairpin which is rich in guanine and cytosine. These two nucleotides binds complementary to one another creating a hair-pin turn which is then followed by several uracil nucleotides. That hairpin acts like a knot to the RNA strand that is being made, so the RNA detaches from the DNA template. The polymerase leaves shortly after, and the DNA is rewound. Transcription can also be stopped by a rho protein which causes the mRNA to fall of the template DNA strand.  

For Eukaryotes: When the RNA complex reaches a termination signal on the DNA, the RNA polymerase is simply detached from the DNA allowing it to rewind. The resulting RNA is then processed. The newly-transcribed mRNA is future processed by adding a cap to the 5' end and a poly(A) tail to the 3' in a process called polyadenylation. It adds several adenine residues to the 3' end of the mRNA. The cap and poly(A) tail act to stabilize the mRNA molecule and prevent it from degrading.

==Chromatin Modification==

DNA and proteins make up complex chromatin, and is can be found as either enchromatin or heterochromatin. Enchromatin is loosely condensed while heterochromatin is tightly condensed. Chromatin condensation is important because it determines transcription activity: if chromatin is too tightly condensed (heterochromatin), then the transcription factors and RNA polymerase are not able to get in; however, if chromatin is loosely condensed like in enchromatin, then transcription factors and RNA polymerase can more easily access the chromatin and start transcription. This means that genes containing enchromatin are highly likely to be transcribed, whereas heterochromatin genes are less likely to be transcribed.

 [[File:30nm Chromatin Structures.png|thumb|30nm Chromatin Structures]]

Chromatin compaction and relaxation is regulated by modifying histone tails. When histone is attached to the acetyl group, due to the neutralization of the positive charge on the histone,  the interaction between the negative charge on the DNA and the positive charge on the histone becomes weaker. As a result, RNA polymerase can easily access to the DNA, and thus, this process facilitates the transcriptional activity in vivo.  In contrast, when histone is deacetylated, meaning that acetyl group is removed from the histone tail, the chromatin structure becomes more compacted, and accordingly, transcription is repressed.

hi , is it posible to add a unfold index webpage design in wiki page ?

############# NOW ###############

Index
1. a
2. b
3. cde
4. hel       // now is click to link to pages


############ SUGGESTION ############
Index
1. a + -     // +  - is a small button to fold or unfold index
2. b +
   1. I    + -
   2. II   + -
   3. III  + -     // so that we can unfold a index in the same page
3. cde
   1. I    + -
   2. II   + -
      1. Category 1
          # TXT
          # TXT
          # TXT
      2. Category 2
          # TXT
          # TXT
          # [ Image ]       
          # TXT              // is it posible to design a page that can be showing all the index &amp; contents ＆ image in a embed box ?
                          // i suggest just make it like a frame , when user click it [+] button , then show the context in the frame..
   3. III  + -     // so that we can unfold a index in the same page

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Data types===
A type in Pascal, and in several other popular programming languages, defines a variable in such a way that it defines a range of values which the variable is capable of storing, and it also defines a set of operations that are permissible to be performed on variables of that type. The types and a very brief description follows;

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
! Data type
! Range of values which the variable is capable of storing
|-
| [[integer (computer science)|integer]]
| Whole numbers from -32768 to 32767
|-
| [[byte]]
| The integers from 0 to 255
|-
| [[word]]
| The integers from 0 to 65,535
|-
| [[floating point|real]]
| Floating point numbers from 1E-38 to 1E+38
|-
| [[boolean type|boolean]]
| Can only have the value TRUE or FALSE
|-
| [[character (computing)|char]]
| Any character in the ASCII character set
|-
| [[string]]
| A collection of characters which form a word
|}

Custom Data types?

== &quot;whole number&quot; ==

By definition, a whole number is a positive integer... Could someone fix the description? Thanks. [[Special:Contributions/64.231.100.159|64.231.100.159]] ([[User talk:64.231.100.159|talk]]) 17:07, 22 January 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <comment>/* Formal Math approximations */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Approximations are deliberate misrepresentations of physical or mathematical things, e.g., Π is approximately 3, an atom is spherical, the drag force on a moving tank is zero. The question is not why do we need them. The most accurate mathematical description of reality is [[:w:Precision_tests_of_QED|Quantum electrodynamics]] (QED). Everything else, every physics formula, all engineering [[:w:Empirical|empirical]] formulas work with around three decimal place accuracy. [[:w:Kurt_Gödel|Gödel]] proved that it will always be possible that unknown truths exist outside of human knowledge. Nothing is absolute. 

==General approximations==
:*[[:w:Guesstimate|guesstimation]]
:*[[:w:ballpark_estimate|ballpark estimate]]
:*scientific wild ass guess (SWAG) .. an air force term

==Mental Calculation==
Before calculators there were slide rulers which required [[:w:Order_of_magnitude|estimating the power of 10]]. This prevented a lot of mistakes. The term calculator actually referred to a person not a machine. Hundreds of human calculators were employed during WWII. Calculations were split up into small tasks that could be checked. It was not a solitary job. A majority were women.

Today there are [[:w:Mental_calculator#Champion_Mental_Calculators|competitions]] and [http://www.doitinyourhead.com training software]. There are books and [[:w:Mental_math|wiki pages]] written about how to do this. There are tricks such as .. when multplying by 9, subtract one from the other number and then subtract it from 9. So 9*7 ... 7-1='''6''' .. 9-6 = '''3''' ... answer '''63''' or instead of 9*7 round up to 10*7 then subtract a 7: (70-7= 63).

==Engineering and Science approximations==
Introduction ([https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B7M108_TO5HQS1ltYm1mVFpjSkU 4 minute audio]) from the podcast '''[[:w:Engines_of_our_ingenuity|Engines of our ingenuity]]'''.

The scientific method is carried out with a constant interaction between scientific laws (theory) and empirical measurements. Theory and measurements are constantly compared to one another.

Approximation also refers to using a simpler process. This model is used to make predictions easier. The most common versions of philosophy of science accept that empirical measurements are always approximations — they do not perfectly represent what is being measured. 

The history of science indicates that the scientific laws commonly felt to be true at any time in history are only approximations to some deeper set of laws. 

Each time a newer set of laws is proposed, the old law and proposed must correspond with the same predicts at the margins or limits. This is the [[w:Correspondence_principle|correspondence principle]].

Between the old and the new laws, there is approximation confusion, empirical doubt, and a theory competition. The theory competition does not hold previous theories sacred. Here is a small sampling of these related topics:

==Assumptions, preditions, and simplifications==
Approximation is a big part of engineering. All short cuts are approximations. General solutions are often not possible. Approximations are sometimes the only practical solution. New short cuts are being discovered every day.

==Examples==

Engineering starts with estimating things. Estimating the number of steps, stairs, lamp posts, or people that could be fired without anyone noticing. Every moment of life can be turned into an estimation hypothesis and can be rewarded with a fact. Engineers can entertain themselves very easily. 

Here is a [https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B7M108_TO5HQS1ltYm1mVFpjSkU 4 minute audio] with a debate describing how to estimate the gas consumed by sport team flags attached to car windows. It comes from the podcast &quot;[[:w:The_Naked_Scientists|Naked Scientist]].&quot; 

=== How many babies are born in the world every second? ===
Let's get to solving our first problem. Let's think, from common knowledge what we have as input data:
* World population: 6,000,000,000
* Average person's lifespan: ~ 60 years
60 years have 60 &amp;times; 365 days, 60 &amp;times; 365 &amp;times; 24 hours, 60 &amp;times; 365 &amp;times; 24 &amp;times; 60 minutes or 60 &amp;times; 365 &amp;times; 24 &amp;times; 60 &amp;times; 60=1892160000 seconds. So assuming that the whole world's population is renewed over the course of 60 years, that means that the number of babies born per second are:
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{6000000000}{1892160000}=3.2&lt;/math&gt;
According to Wikipedia in 2007 about 134 million babies were born, which amounts to 4.2 babies per second. So our guesstimate was not so bad at all!

All the zeros in the numbers above can certainly cause some confusion, so using scientific format turns out to be much more convenient.
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{6.0\times 10^9}{1.89216\times 10^9}=3.2\,\textrm{babies/sec}&lt;/math&gt;

=== What is the bandwidth of a Boeing 747? ===

: ''Never underestimate the bandwidth of a station wagon full of tapes hurtling down the highway. —Tanenbaum, Andrew S.''

Imagine we didn't have Internet and satellite communication, and the only way to transfer data between Europe and USA was to burn the data on DVDs, pack them on board of an airplane and ship them overseas. What would be the bandwidth of a 747 full of DVDs?

According to technical specs, the length of a 747 is 70m, and the internal diameter of the cabin is about 6 m. This gives a total usable volume of:
: &lt;math&gt;V_{plane}=\frac{\pi}{4}d^2 L\approx\frac{3}{4}\times 3^2\times 70 \approx 473\,\textrm{m}^3&lt;/math&gt;
Assuming we have the DVDs in thin cases, with dimensions 12 cm &amp;times; 12 cm &amp;times; 0.5 cm, with a volume of:
: &lt;math&gt; V_{DVD}= 12 \times 12 \times 0.5 = 72\,\textrm{cm}^3 = 72\times 10^{-6}\,\textrm{m}^3,&lt;/math&gt;
the total number of DVDs that we could fit in the plane would be given by:
: &lt;math&gt; N=\frac{V_{plane}}{V_{DVD}}=\frac{473}{72\times 10^{-6}}\approx 6.6\times 10^6\,\textrm{DVDs}&lt;/math&gt;
In terms of data this is 28 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; GB, or estimating the average flight duration about 7 hours, the data transfer rate is:
: &lt;math&gt; \frac{28 \times 10^6}{7\times 3600}=1.1\,\textrm{TB/s}&lt;/math&gt;
Now we have to stop for a moment, and think if the assumptions we did in this problem are realistic. One thing we did not take into account, is the weight of all the disks. Will the airplane be actually able to take off with all that weight. Let's check! Assuming that about 50 % of the DVD case is empty space, and the density of the plastic comprising the DVD is comparable to the density of water, we estimate the total weight of the cargo to be about 240 tons. The empty airplane weighs 162 tons, while the maximum take-off weight is 333 tons. This gives maximum of 171 tons of useful cargo, or 70 % of what we calculated we could pack inside. This new factor reduces the bandwidth of the plane down to 0.8 TB/s. This is about 4% of the bandwidth of a single strand optical fibre (20 TB/s). Added to this the 15 hour round trip of the plane (a 54000 second latency, about a million times what you expect on an ADSL connection), and the infrastructure required to read that information off the 747 and distribute it, this is probably not an effective way to communicate.

GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2, August 2008 Copyright © 2008 http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/User_talk:Jerusalem2020., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.[This is the first released version of the library GPL. It is numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.], This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU Library General Public License for more details.



Preamble The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any other libraries whose authors decide to use it. You can use it for your libraries, too. When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things. To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it. For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link a program with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library. Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free library. If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations. Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect transforming the program into proprietary software. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all. Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs. This license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries. This license is quite different from the ordinary one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is the same as in the ordinary license. The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a program and simply using it. Linking a program with a library, without changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is analogous to running a utility program or application program. However, in a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License treats it as such. Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries. We concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better. However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the libraries themselves. This Library General Public License is intended to permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free libraries that are incorporated in them. (We have not seen how to achieve this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards changes in the actual functions of the Library.) The hope is that this will lead to faster development of free libraries. The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a &quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;. The former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only works together with the library. Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary General Public License rather than by this special one. TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION 0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;). Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;. A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables. The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A &quot;work based on the Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.) &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library. Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does. 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library. You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: a) The modified work must itself be a software library. b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change. c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License. d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful. (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.) These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library. In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License. 3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices. Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy. This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library. 4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange. If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code. 5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;. Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License. However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;. The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables. When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law. If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.) Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself. 6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications. You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things: a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.) b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution. c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place. d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy. For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable. It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute. 7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things: a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above. b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work. 8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. 9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it. 10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License. 11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library. If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice. This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License. 12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License. 13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Library General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. 14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally. NO WARRANTY 15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public License). To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. one line to give the library's name and an idea of what it does.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Good sportsmanship means having good conduct and attitude by sports participants, especially fair play, courtesy, striving spirit, and grace in losing.  A good sport will not gloat when he wins, nor will he sulk when he loses.  He will offer help to his opponent, even if doing so may cost him a win.  He will understand that his opponent is more important than the contest.

OpenBSD has an easy (although non-graphical) installation procedure. 

==Starting Installation==
 erase ^?, werase ^W, kill ^U, intr ^C, status ^T
 (I)nstall, (U)pgrade or (S)hell? '''i'''
 
 Welcome to the OpenBSD/i386 4.4 install program.
 
 This program will help you install OpenBSD. At any prompt except password
 prompts you can escape to a shell by typing '!'. Default answers are shown
 in []'s and are selected by pressing RETURN.  At any time you can exit this
 program by pressing Control-C, but exiting during an install can leave your
 system in an inconsistent state.
 
 Terminal type: [vt220] '''&lt;enter&gt;'''
 kbd(8) mapping? ('L' for list) [none] '''&lt;enter&gt;'''
 
 IS YOUR DATA BACKED UP? As with anything that modifies disk contents, this
 program can cause SIGNIFICANT data loss.
 
 It is often helpful to have the installation notes handy. For complex disk
 configurations, relevant disk hardware manuals and a calculator are useful.
 
 Proceed with install? [no] '''yes'''
 Cool!  Let's get to it.
 
 You will now initialize the disk(s) that OpenBSD will use. To enable all
 available security features you should configure the disk(s) to allow the
 creation of separate filesystems for /, /tmp, /var, /usr, and /home.
 
 Available disks are: wd0.
 Which one is the root disk? (or done) [wd0] '''&lt;enter&gt;'''
 Do you want to use *all* of wd0 for OpenBSD? [no] '''yes'''
 Putting all of wd0 into an active OpenBSD MBR partion (type 'A6')...done.
 
 You will now create an OpenBSD disklabel inside the OpenBSD MBR
 partition. The disklabel defines how OpenBSD splits up the MBR partition
 into OpenBSD partitions in which filesystems and swap space are created.
 
 The offsets used in the disklabel are ABSOLUTE, i.e. relative to the
 start of the disk, NOT the start of the OpenBSD MBR partition.
 
 # Inside MBR partition 3: type A6 start 63 size 80292807
 
 Treating sectors 63-80292870 as the OpenBSD portion of the disk.
 You can use the 'b' command to change this.

==Partitioning==
 Initial label editor (enter '?' for help at any prompt)
 &gt; '''p g'''
 device: /dev/rwd0c
 type: ESDI
 disk: ESDI/IDE disk
 label: Maxtor 2F040L0  
 bytes/sector: 512
 sectors/track: 63
 tracks/cylinder: 16
 sectors/cylinder: 1008
 cylinders: 16383
 total bytes: 38.3G
 free bytes: 0.2G

 16 partitions:

   a:          5.0G          0.0G  4.2BSD   2048 16384  328 
   b:          0.2G          5.0G    swap                   
   c:         38.3G          0.0G  unused      0     0      
   d:          5.0G          5.2G  4.2BSD   2048 16384  328
 &gt; '''d *'''
 &gt; '''a a'''
 offset: [63] '''&lt;enter&gt;'''
 size: [80292807] '''10g'''&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;This controls how much memory is in the root partition. I would not recomend using 10g as the example used. 5g would be plenty.&lt;/ref&gt;
 Rounding to nearest cylinder: 20971377
 FS type: [4.2BSD] '''&lt;enter&gt;'''
 mount point: [none] '''/'''
 &gt; '''a b'''
 offset: [20971440] '''&lt;enter&gt;'''
 size: [59321430] '''1.1g'''&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;This controls how much memory the swap partition has. The standard is twice your RAM.&lt;/ref&gt;
 Rounding to nearest cylinder: 2307312
 FS type: [swap] '''&lt;enter&gt;'''
 &gt; '''a d'''
 offset: [23278752] '''&lt;enter&gt;'''

 Rounding to nearest cylinder: 4194288
 FS type: [4.2BSD] '''&lt;enter&gt;'''
 mount point: [none] '''/tmp'''
 &gt; '''a e'''
 offset: [27473040] '''&lt;enter&gt;'''
 size: [52819830] '''6g'''&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;This controls how much memory the var partition has.&lt;/ref&gt;
 Rounding to nearest cylinder: 12582864
 FS type: [4.2BSD] '''&lt;enter&gt;'''
 mount point: [none] '''/var'''
 &gt; '''a g'''
 offset: [40055904] '''&lt;enter&gt;'''
 size: [40236966] '''10g'''&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;This controls how much memory the usr partition has. The usr partition is where you store all of your program. Vary the size depending on how many applications you want. 10g is good for a workstation. 3g is enough for a server.&lt;/ref&gt;
 Rounding to nearest cylinder: 20971440
 FS type: [4.2BSD] '''&lt;enter&gt;'''  
 mount point: [none] '''/usr'''
 &gt; '''a h'''
 offset: [61027344] '''&lt;enter&gt;'''
 size: [19265526] '''&lt;enter&gt;'''&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;This controls how much memory the home partition has.&lt;/ref&gt;
 Rounding to nearest cylinder: 18874800
 FS type: [4.2BSD] '''&lt;enter&gt;'''
 mount point: [none] '''/home'''
 &gt; '''w'''
 &gt; '''q'''
 No label changes.
 Mount point for wd0d (size=2097144k)? (or 'none' or 'done') [/tmp] '''&lt;enter&gt;'''
 Mount point for wd0e (size=6291432k)? (or 'none' or 'done') [/var] '''&lt;enter&gt;'''

 Mount point for wd0d (size=2097144k)? (or 'none' or 'done') [/tmp] '''done'''
 No more disks to initialize.
 
 OpenBSD filesystems:
 wd0a /
 wd0d /tmp
 wd0e /var
 wd0g /usr
 wd0h /home
 
 The next step *DESTROYS* all existing data on these partitions!
 Are you really sure that you're ready to proceed? [no] '''yes'''

&lt;big&gt;'''Randomized Evidence in Proton Therapy'''&lt;/big&gt;


==Ocular melanoma==
*'''MGH; 2000''' (1989-1998) PMID 10865313 -- &quot;A randomized controlled trial of varying radiation doses in the treatment of choroidal melanoma.&quot; (Gragoudas ES, Arch Ophthalmol. 2000 Jun;118(6):773-8.)
**Randomized. 188 patients with small/medium choroidal melanoma (&lt;15mm diameter, &lt;5mm height), within 4 disc diameters of optic disc or macula. Arm 1) 50 CGE vs. Arm 2) 70 CGE
**5-year outcome: visual acuity &gt;20/200 similar at 55%; tumor regrowth similar at ~3%; mets similar at ~8%
**Toxicity: 50 CGE significantly less visual loss; no difference in radiation papillopathy or maculopathy
**Conclusion: Lower dose resulted in similar outcome, similar visual acuity loss, but improved visual field loss


==Prostate==
*'''PROG 95-09''' (1996-1999) -- Proton/photon 70.2 Gy vs. proton/photon 79.2 Gy
**Randomized. 2 institutions (Harvard and Loma Linda). 392 patients, stage T1b-T2b, PSA &lt;15 ng/mL (median PSA 6.3). Arm 1) proton boost 19.8/11 GyE followed by photons 50.4/28 vs. Arm 2) proton boost 28.8/16 followed by photons 50.4/28. Proton CTV = prostate + 5 mm margin. PTV = CTV + 7-10 mm. Loma Linda used opposed lateral beams, 250 MeV protons; Harvard used perineal boost, 160 MeV protons. Rectal Lucite probe, inflated with 25-50 mL saline. Photons were 4F plan, photon CTV = prostate/SV + 10 mm margin. 
**'''5-years; 2005''' PMID 16160131 -- &quot;Comparison of conventional-dose vs high-dose conformal radiation therapy in clinically localized adenocarcinoma of the prostate: a randomized controlled trial.&quot; (Zietman AL, JAMA. 2005 Sep 14;294(10):1233-9.) Median F/U 5.5 years
***Outcome: 5-year bNED 70.2 Gy 61% vs. 79.2 Gy 80% (SS), 50% reduction in risk of failure. LC (defined as PSA &lt;1.0) 48% vs. 67% (SS) No difference in OS 97% vs 96% (NS)
***Risk stratification: low risk (PSA &lt;10, stage &lt;=T2a, GS &lt;7) 60% vs. 80% (SS); high risk 63% vs. 79% (SS). Contemporary intermediate risk 63% vs. 81% (SS), but contemporary high risk (NS, but small number) 
***Late toxicity: Grade 3+ 70.2 Gy 1% vs. 79.2 2%; GU Grade 2 18% vs. 20% (NS), GI Grade 2 8% vs. 17% (SS). Most GI toxicity by 3 years; GU toxicity continuous
***Conclusion: Men with clinically localized PCA have better bNED with high dose, without worse severe toxicity
**'''10-years; 2010''' PMID 20124169 -- &quot;Randomized Trial Comparing Conventional-Dose With High-Dose Conformal Radiation Therapy in Early-Stage Adenocarcinoma of the Prostate: Long-Term Results From Proton Radiation Oncology Group/American College of Radiology 95-09.&quot; (Zietman AL, J Clin Oncol. 2010 Mar 1;28(7):1106-11.) Median F/U 8.9 years
***Outcome: 10-year ASTRO (backdating) bPFS low-dose 68% vs. high-dose 83% (SS). For low-risk disease 72% vs 93% (SS); for intermediate-risk 58% vs. 70% (p=0.06). No difference in OS (78% vs 83%)
***Toxicity: Late Grade 2+ low-dose 29% vs. high-dose 39% (SS); Grade 3+ 2% in both arms (NS)
***Conclusion: Long-term advantage for high dose in low/intermediate risk PCA patients, with comparable Grade 3 toxicity


*'''Harvard''' (1982-1992) -- Proton (dose escalated) vs. photon boost
**Randomized. 202 patients, Stage T3-T4Nx,0-2. Standard photons 50.4 Gy four-field, then Arm 1) Conformal protons 25.2 CGE (total 75.6 CGE) vs. Arm 2) Photons 16.8 Gy (total 67.2 Gy). Median F/U 5.1 years
**'''5-years; 1995''' PMID 7721636 -- &quot;Advanced prostate cancer: the results of a randomized comparative trial of high dose irradiation boosting with conformal protons compared with conventional dose irradiation using photons alone.&quot; (Shipley WU, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1995 Apr 30;32(1):3-12.)
***Outcome: 5-year LC photon+proton 92% vs. photons 80% (NS), no difference in OS, DSS, TRFS. GS 4/5 patients 94% vs. 64% (SS)
***Toxicity: Rectal bleeding photon+proton 32% vs. photons 12% (SS), urethral stricture 19% vs. 8% (p=0.07)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Tools needed: 
tire patch kit (patch, cement, sandpaper/roughening tool) 
pen (ballpoint or marker) 
tire-iron 


=== Remove wheel with flat tire===

It is assumed you have the skills and tools necessary to do this.  I will not describe this process here.  (A flat tire can be repaired without removing the wheel.  However that is an Advanced Procedure, and is not covered here.)

=== Identify where the hole/leak is===

NOTE: If you can do this BEFORE removing the tire from the rim you can save yourself much effort and time later.  

Holding wheel with flat tire (&amp; tube) closely examine exterior of tire to find what has punctured it.  Include a tactile examination -- run your fingers over the tire surface.  97% of the time you will find something, a small piece of (metal) wire, a small piece of glass (oftentimes glass is below the surface of the tire, in which case you are looking for glints of light reflecting off one surface of a shard of glass in your tire), or a biological object (splinter of wood or thorn), or a screw or a nail. 

BEFORE removing object from your tire MARK THE LOCATION of the puncture.  Also mark the location on the tire that corresponds to where the valve of your innertube is located.  (Note: I've just told you to mark two (2) locations on your tire.  This will save you time.  You don't have to do it, though.)   

If you do NOT find the location of the puncture mark the location of the innertube valve. 

=== Remove the tire===

If possible do not use any tools.  (This does require some muscling on your part.)  If your tire is a very tight fit over your rim use a tire-iron carefully.  (In an &quot;extreme situation&quot; a flat-bladed screwdriver can be used.  It is WAY-EASY to pinch-flat an innertube using a screwdriver.)  
Do NOT pinch your innertube between your tire-removing tool and the rim, or the tire.  (If you are new to fixing flats you will probably do this once.  We all do.  It's part of the learning curve involved in wrenching on your bike.  Learning to not pinch an innertube is best done with a wheel and tool in hand.  Take your time.  Good luck.)  

=== Inspect the inside of your tire for punctures===

Yes, you've inspected the outside, and now you are inspecting the inside.  This is NECESSARY if you did not find the puncture yet.  It is VERY RECOMMENDED even if you have found something already.  The idea is to leave your tire, after all this is done, with NOTHING that will put more punctures in your innertube.  
Include a tactile inspection.  
Mark the location of any (additional) punctures you find.  
REMOVE all foreign objects from your tire after marking their location.  

=== Find holes in innertube===
(This is why you marked all those puncture locations and the valve location on your tire.) 
Align the innertube valve with the valve-location mark you made earlier on the tire.  
Inspect the innertube in the vicinity of all the tire-puncture marks for innertube punctures.  MARK all innertube punctures.  

Maybe you were unable to find any punctures in your tire.  So now you have nothing to help you find the punctures in your innertube.  You may have a pinch-flat.  These can be anywhere on the surface of your innertube.  (Punctures from objects generally happen to the surface of the innertube that is on the outside of the &quot;donut surface&quot; that the innertube describes.)  

Fill your innertube with air &amp; listen/feel for escaping air.  MARK location(s) of puncture(s).  Maybe you haven't found anything yet.  In this case get a container with water (bucket, washbasin, whatever) and run your innertube through the water completely submerging the innertube a section at a time.  Hold each section stationary under water (fill the innertube with air just before putting innertube into water) looking for small bubbles escaping from the innertube.  If you do not have a basin available, mix some soap with water and apply the solution to the tire.  As the air escapes it will make bubbles in the soap.  When pumping air in to the innertube for this test don't be afraid to pump lots of air in.  (Stop pumping when innertube is twice original size.  This does not mean you need to pump it up this much.  I'm saying if you have no other way of determining when enough air is in the innertube, stop at twice the original size.)    

Assuming you have located all the punctures in your innertube, you are ready to begin the repair.

=== Repair innertube punctures===
Roughen/clean a patch on the innertube, centered around (each) puncture.  The roughened area must be larger than the patch you are going to apply.  (Examine patch from your patch kit to determine this size.)  You will use whatever tool your patch kit provides you with -- either a (small) piece of sandpaper or a metal grater.  

Apply the patch cement.  Apply a very thin coating to the entire area you roughened/cleaned.  
Allow the cement to get sticky.  Test for stickiness by using a fingernail -- lightly touch one fingernail surface to a surface on the area of cement you previously applied.  If it doesn't stick yet, wait.  If it sticks some it's about right.  If you wait too long it won't stick at all, in which case you get to clean it off and re-apply.  

Assuming the cement is just sticky peel off the backing from the underside of your patch and apply patch to the innertube puncture, centered on the puncture.  Leave the backing that is on the top-side of your patch on.  (I generally make my puncture-location marks so big that when I roughen/clean the innertube the marks are visible outside that roughened/cleaned area.  This makes the centering of the patch here a lot easier.)  

Press the patch onto the surface of the innertube.  Use the broad part of your thumb.  Use the broad part of you tire iron.  You are assisting the cement to establish a complete bond between the innertube and the patch.  Take a minute or two and press!  You are also pressing all air out of the patch-innertube bond.  (Yeah, this is the part of this process that is best taught by example/demonstration.  Sorry)  

As you are pressing the patch onto your innertube you may notice the top-side backing on the patch begin to come loose.  This is a Good Thing.  If it doesn't, you get to figure out how to remove the top-side backing without removing the patch.  (The top-side and bottom-side backing are there to keep the patch clean.  A clean patch adheres best!  Clean is Good.)  &quot;Better quality&quot; patches have this top-side backing pre-slit making it easier to remove the top-side backing from the patch.  (Most patch kits I've found recently are not &quot;better quality&quot;.)  
After pressing patch onto the innertube remove top-side backing.  

Repeat for all punctures.

=== Set innertube aside when all punctures have been patched to allow a few minutes for the cement to set and your patch to adhere.===

Start cleaning up your work area.  (You're almost done!)

=== Reassemble tire &amp; innertube onto rim===
Put just enough air into your innertube so it's barely round.  Put innertube into tire.  Fit one edge of tire over one side of wheel rim starting with the valve area.  With your thumbs (and your tire iron IF NECESSARY) get all of one edge of tire over one rim.  
Starting at valve location push second edge of tire over wheel rim.  Now you probably will have to use your tire irons.  (This is why they come in sets.)  If you have burley thumbs you may not need to use tire irons.  (Yay!)  
Do everything you can to AVOID giving your (newly patched) innertube a pinch-flat.  Take your time, working the tire over your wheel rim while keeping the innertube away from the rim edge.  (This is why there is some air in the innertube.  To avoid getting the innertube stuck between the tire and the rim edge.)  

With tire completely mounted into wheel, between rims, adjust position of tire and innertube with respect to the rim so the innertube valve is sticking straight out of the valve hole.  This is VERY IMPORTANT!  A maladjusted innertube can put a lot of stress on one side of the innertube at the valve and rip the innertube away from the valve.  Which will necessitate you replacing the innertube.  (Holes at the innertube-valve junction are almost impossible to repair -- I've never been able to repair 'em anyway.)  

Put 10-20 lbs of air into tire/innertube.  Check valve for proper innertube-rim orientation.  If the valve is sticking out of the valve hole at any angle (other than straight) let some air out and re-adjust innertube/tire and rim orientation.  The rim and innertube are made to fit together so the valve sticks straight out.  Any other angle on the valve indicates the need for readjustment.  

When the valve has the correct angle (straight out) inspect rim-tire orientation.  You are looking to make sure the tire bead is completely seated all around the rim.  Look at where the tire goes into the rim.  The tire should appear about &quot;even&quot; all the way around the edge of the rim.  Tires usually have several concentric &quot;rings&quot; cast into the surface of the tire near the bead just to make this check easy.  If you see the tire bead coming out of the rim in any one location do NOT put any more air into the tire.  Seat the tire bead.  You may have to let some air out of the tire.  

When the tire bead is uniformly seated inflate the tire to full pressure.  This is nearly always defined on a place on the tire.  &quot;Max pressure = ## lbs.&quot; should appear somewhere on the outside of your tire.  


Hey!  You're done!  
Clean up your work area.  
Put your wheel back onto your cycle.  Go for a ride!  

Check your tire the next day!  
If you had a patch that did not completely adhere you may have a slow leak.  If this happens :-((  you get to find it (step 5) above) and repair it (step 6) above.)  Remember to COMPLETELY remove the leaking patch before applying the new one.  
(Again, if you're new to this, you MAY have this happen once.  It is frustrating.  Somehow your patch did not completely adhere to the innertube.  Dirty patch?  Dirty innertube?  Cement too dry?  Patch not completely pressed on?  These, and more, can result in a patch that does not completely adhere.  I hope this does NOT happen to you.)  

Happy riding!

This book, while useful, isn't a textbook. It is a source text, specifically the South African National Curriculum for grades 10-12. Unlike [[South African Curriculum]] or [[Special:Prefixindex/FHSST]], which have ''content'', this isn't educational. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:24, 30 September 2008 (UTC)

:{{comment}} I have a conundrum. On one hand, what we ''want'' is to have access to free curriculums so that we can write books to match them. No matter how great our books become, if they don't meet the requirements of a school, they won't be used by one. For our long-term success, not only should we keep this, but we should also secure access to more standard curricula like it. On the other hand, you're right that this blatantly isn't a book like what we normally require, and the [[WB:WIW|letter of the law]] says we delete it.
:In order to become a great educational resource, one day we will want two books about this (at least): a book that teaches these subjects according to this standard, and a book about this standard to help teachers teach it. This material here could conceivably be an appendix to the later. Of course, this is speculation, such a book doesnt exist and it's not prudent to vote that this should stay as part of a book we don't have.
:As a potential compromise, Howabout we save this outside the main namespace, someplace safe like [[Wikibooks:South Africa National Curriculum]]? It would set a good precident for obtaining and keeping other such curricula that we could use as a local reference. We could even create a nice template like {{tlx|curriculum}} to mark all such pages. Would this be satisfactory? --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 01:04, 1 October 2008 (UTC)

::I see a few problems with that - textbooks will need to conform to an ''authoritative'' version of any standards. Since that's the case, we should use the official version. This also eliminates the need to keep our copy up-to-date, which would be an unnecessary drain on our resources, even keeping only one curriculum up-to-date. If the curriculum is freely-licensed (It [http://www.fhsst.org/?q=node/81 seems] to be GFDL), it should be made available on Wikisource, not here.
::Incorporating it into a textbook for teachers would be fine, however the number of curricula we would have to incorporate as appendices would easily overshadow the content of the textbook proper, violating the spirit (if not the letter) of our inclusion policy. I don't think teaching in South Africa is so different from teaching here - we'd want only one text on that subject, but with hundreds if not thousands of curricula to include as an appendix...)
::I think the best solution here is to host this on Wikisource and/or use the official curriculum as hosted on the official website. Perhaps we should have an ''index'' of curricula (not the curricula themselves) in the project namespace - ''that'' would be a great idea, I think (along with an index of [[User:Whiteknight/Friends|potential collaborators]] and a [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Mike.lifeguard&amp;diff=1293509&amp;oldid=1292826 guide to content licensing] and other such materials). &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:36, 1 October 2008 (UTC)

:::I agree with you that maintenance is a problem, and [http://www.jesandco.org/AboutUs/Default.asp some organizations are better equipped to handle the task then we are]. Curricula like this are going to play a fundamental role in the future of this project, and it would be bad for us to delete it without ensuring there is a good home for it (and &quot;good&quot; means that it stays GFDL and we can continue to make use of it) first.
:::The textbook for teachers idea that I mentioned would be specific to this curriculum, like [[South Africa Teachers Guide]] or something, not a monolithic tome for teachers from all countries. Keeping a single curriculum with a book that prepares teachers to use it is in the spirit of our inclusion policy. We could even to to th far fringe where we could call a modicum of explanatory notes &quot;annotations&quot; and the whole source+comments becomes an &quot;annotated text&quot;. There are a lot of ways we could swing it, but I think you're right that we shouldn't keep this here. Let's get on the line with people from WV and WS, and see if anybody else wants it. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 14:40, 1 October 2008 (UTC)
::::I have trouble seeing how a curriculum would work on a wiki at all.  I agree with Mike's thoughts on needing an &quot;authoritative version&quot;.  Surely a curriculum needs to be agreed by some sort of official body (I think?).  What I am thinking is on a wiki anyone could add or remove what ever they wanted to the curriculum and who is anyone to say what should or shouldn't be taught in South Africa?  --[[User:AdRiley|AdRiley]] ([[User talk:AdRiley|talk]]) 08:02, 3 October 2008 (UTC)

We can better understand where to fish by examining the different areas within a river.  These areas are created by the current eroding the valley floor.  Because these are features are characteristics of the water flow in a river we call these hydrological features.

== General hydrological features ==
First we begin with a River that is spreading out onto a shallow section, called a '''flat'''.  Past floods has created a bed of sand and the rivers spreads widely over the sandy bottom.  At some point, the gradient (the fall of the river valley over distance), forces the water to cut into that downstream section of the sand bed.  As sand is washed away the river flows through the gravel forming a '''riffle'''.  The downward motion of the river gives the river greater eroding power and downstream of this current is bent into a focused powerful flow against a group of large boulders, forming a '''rapid'''.  The river now flows hard into the left bank creating a hole of maximal depth called a '''pool'''. Having eroded the left bank, the water has lost much of its energy and will deposit some of the eroded material in a long tail of light current.  This is sometimes called a '''run'''. Often this progression will repeat itself with the tail of run, spreading out into a shallow '''flat'''.

We can understand fishing In a river better when we consider what kinds of habitat each of these areas offers.

== Flat ==
The flat offers a habitat best suited to invertebrates that flourish in a silty to muddy bottom.  With minimal current and a minimum depth, small invertebrates dominate the ecology.  These kinds of animals often burrow in the mud, or offer flat profiles as to avoid being swept into deeper water.  Occasionally small fish and crawfish will make forays into these areas but exposure to the thin water can be dangerous; birds patrol the shallow flats.  Bigger waters offer deeper flats (which encourage greater use by the minnows) but even in these habitats the lack of hiding places limits the population of animals utilizing this habitat.  
Game fish are rarely successfully targeted on flats.  Here there ability to detect the fishermen is greatest.  Also there is normally a lack of cover and current that makes it more difficult to target likely places.

== Riffle ==
Once the gradient has picked up water velocity and starts to erode the silt and sand.  The river falls into a riffle.  As both oxygenation and current increase, Vertebrates such as small fish and fry utilize small resting places in the rubble.  Getting around can be tough (For a small fish), but frequently food is near a maximum between the nymphs that live in the rubble and others drifting in the current.  Fishing is problematic in riffles as well.  Many game fish only make short forays into riffles, and the insect life is insufficient calories for the effort a predator would need to hunt in them.

== Rapids ==
If gradient is sufficient and the river narrows, the river may fall into bouts of large turbulent flow over boulders and other large sections of bedrock.  Rapids offer few homes to small invertebrates.  They also usually are a less hospitable home to small minnows, with turbulent deep currents.  They do make good homes however for the several large groups of fish.  Those fish that feed on drifting insects will take position themselves in front of or behind large boulders to take advantage of the current break while being able to dart in heavy currents around them.  

While many game fish only occasionally venture into the turbulent rapids; Bass and Trout are well known to use rapids.  Both have a opportunistic diet that adapts well to drift feeding behind large boulders.  Fishing in rapids means utilizing the heavy current to sweep an attractive imitation through many possible feeding stations.  Mobility can be difficult; with wading approaches being difficult and approaches by a boat impossible.

== Pool ==
As the water velocity increases due to rapids and riffles, The river will erode a deep spot. This deep spot is known as a pool.  With both depth and water velocity the pool is an attractive place for fish of all kinds.  There are four different habitats within a pool and are used differently by forage and game fish.

=== The upper lip ===
The uppermost riffle or rapid will usually end in an abrupt deepening called an upper lip.    The upper lip offers a small area of reduced flow immediately below the current and therefore with the most concentrated amount of drifting invertebrates.  Forage fish will often hunt in the area, concealed by air-born predators.  At times active game fish will then also roam this area for minnows.

=== The depths ===
The deepest part of the hole is generally rather poor in nutrients and drift.  Often times game fish lie here when Inactive.  Rarely do minnows and other fish use this area.  Fish also use the area during the winter season.  

=== Deep edges ===
Rarely does a river flow strait.  Normally it meanders across the landscape.  In the course of this back and forth motion; pools are usually located into elongated patches near one bank.  The outside edge of the river often rapidly falls towards the depths.  Over Time, erosion has occurred above and below the waterline, uncovering large boulders and toppling trees into the water.  With the security of depth and cover the outside bend has abundant forage fish and offers a prime location for game fish.

=== current seams ===
Once the river current flows to one side of the riverbed, a seam between the faster current and the back current develops.  Sometimes large eddies develop funneling water from the tail of the pool towards its head.  Current seams and particularly eddies can concentrate drifting food.  small forage fish will use the current seam to pick through the drift.  if the inside seam is shallow, game fish will only make occasional forays into the inside seam (or use it during night).  In other rivers, high water will straiten currents and lead to considerable erosion on the inside seams.  Eddying currents and depth can make inside seams prime locations for many game fish.

==Runs==
As the river erodes the depth of a pool, it pushes this material further downstream.  The character of this area greatly depends on the gradient and bedrock of the river.  Most small rivers offer moderate gradient yet abundant boulders; creating a large field of boulders and basketball sized rocks just downstream of the pools.  This area would be considered a run; a relatively shallow but diverse area of boulders.  The shallow water encourages insects and minnows, and The boulders create current breaks and turbulence for predatory game fish.  These locations are prime, but often fish are more spread than upstream in the hole.

== Sonic Supercharging of 2 Stroke Engines ==
This page of the Engineering Acoustics Wikibook discusses the merits and design of Tuned Pipes for 2 Stroke Engines. For introductory material on 2 Stroke Engines please see the following links:

[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2_stroke_engine Wikipedia 2 Stroke Engines]]

[[http://science.howstuffworks.com/two-stroke1.htm HowStuffWorks 2 Stroke Engines]]

== Introduction ==
For a 2 stroke engine the tuned pipe is the section of the exhaust system that begins at the exhaust port and ends at the end of the converging section. A tuned pipe is made of between 3 and 4 characteristic sections depending on the desired effect. The figure below depicts cross sections for 3 typical configurations of tuned pipes as well as a straight pipe:

[[Image:Tune_pipe_cross_sections.JPG|center|Typical pipes]]

The purpose of straight and tuned pipes is to utilize the pressure waves originating from the exhaust port to assist the breathing of the engine. This is achieved by designing the pipe in such a way that positive and negative reflected waves arrive back at the exhaust port at an instant when a low or high pressure is desired. This is beneficial for two stroke engines because unlike four stroke engines, they do not have dedicated intake and exhaust strokes and valves.

The following picture labels the various elements of a two-stroke engine which are referred to in this Wikibook page.

[[Image:Two-stroke_engine_schematic.JPG|center|Two-stroke engine elements]]

Furthermore; abbreviations will help as well:
*In order of accensding crank angle
**TDC - Top Dead Center, 0 deg
**EPO - Exhaust Port Open
**TPO - Transfer Port Open
**BDC - Bottom Dead Ceneter, 180 deg
**TPC - Transfer Port Close
**EPC - Exhaust Port Close

[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2_stroke_engine Wikipedia 2 Stroke Engines]]

[[http://science.howstuffworks.com/two-stroke1.htm HowStuffWorks 2 Stroke Engines]]

== Straight Pipe: ==
The goal of a tuned straight pipe in this application is to use the reflected negative pressure waves from the open end of the pipe to help draw out the exhaust gases. By selecting the appropriate length of the pipe, the reflected rarefaction wave arrives at the exhaust port just as the transfer port opens thus assisting the flow of fresh mixture into the cylinder, and exhaust gases out of the cylinder. The figure below illustrates this action. In the figure, even though the piston has reached bottom dead center (BDC), fresh mixture continues to enter the cylinder because the rarefaction wave causes P2 to be smaller than P1. A key point to note is that the velocity with which the pressure and rarefaction waves travel down and up the exhaust pipe is for the most part independent of the engine operating frequency (RPM). Due to this fact, the conclusion must be made that for a given pipe length there is an optimal RPM for which the waves will arrive producing the greatest benefit for the breathing of the engine. At this optimal RPM, the engine breathes significantly better and hence produces a noticeable increase in output power. This effect is quantified by calculating the ratio of fresh mixture to exhaust gases within the cylinder as the compression stage begins at EPC. If the rarefaction wave is very large, it is possible that fresh mixture is pulled into the exhaust pipe while both transfer and exhaust ports are open. This phenomenon is known as short circuiting the engine and produces undesired effects such as a decrease in fuel economy and an increase in release of volatile organic compounds. These negative effects can be mitigated by designing the exhaust system such that either no fresh mixture is pulled into the exhaust pipe (i.e. perfectly tuned straight pipe) or further utilizing the exhaust pressure wave to inhibit short circuiting. For performance two-stroke engines, the second solution is most often employed by means of a tuned exhaust pipe known as a tune pipe.

[[Image:engine_straight_pipe.JPG|center|Schematic of two-stroke engine with straight pipe]]

== Tune Pipe: ==
With a converging-belly section-diverging type tune pipe the goal is to have the diverging section create a returning rarefaction wave and the converging section create a returning pressure wave. The belly section acts as an appropriate time delay between the returning waves such that the pressure wave arrives at the exhaust port after the transfer port has closed. This pressure wave pushes the excess fresh mixture in the exhaust pipe from a short circuit, back into the cylinder. Here the short circuited fresh mixture is actually desired since this allows the returning pressure wave to &quot;super charge&quot; the cylinder giving it more fresh mixture than if the cylinder were filled at ambient pressure. This is a similar result to turbo-charging or super-charging a four-stroke engine. If the mixture contained within the cylinder before combustion occurs were allowed to expand to ambient pressure, its volume would be larger than the displacement of the engine. This phenomenon is quantified as volumetric efficiency; it is calculated as the ratio of the ambient pressure volume of the fresh charge, divided by the displacement volume of the engine. The operation of a two-stroke engine equipped with a properly tuned pipe is shown in the animation below, for a step by step description of the process, please follow the link below the animation. 

There are exhaust manufacturers now that are mating up tuned pipes to tuned (ported) engines to get the best possible 'supercharging effect' at given rpm's. In the past a tuned pipe would have been tested on a stock engine but the length and shape of the pipe will differ on a 'tuned' engine because of the way it is able to rev higher .

== Tune Pipe Design Geometry: ==
The most basic form of a tune pipe is shown in the figure below with corresponding wave equations.

[[Image:Simple_pipe_equations.png|center|geometry and equations for simple pipe]]

This pipe consists of an expansion chamber which serves to create both the returning rarefaction and pressure waves. From reference [1], we know that wave speed in the pipe is effectively independent of engine RPM and largely dependent on temperature of the gases in the pipe. This means that a tune pipe with basic geometry operates optimally for only one specific RPM, as the engine RPM deviates from this optimal value the timing of the arrival of the returning waves is less optimal for the volumetric efficiency. The relation between the volumetric efficiency and the engine RPM is characterized qualitatively by the following graph:

[[Image:Veff_to_RPM.JPG|center|Qualitative relation of volumetric efficiency to RPM]]

Although the basic tune pipe performs the desired task of increasing the volumetric efficiency, the narrow RPM band width for which increased power is available reduces the practicality of the basic pipe since engines are typically required to operate within a wide range of RPM. One way to broaden the effective RPM band width of a pipe is to taper the pipe at sections of increasing and decreasing cross section. To understand how this works, we can represent a tapered section as many small step increases/decreases in cross section. Each step will produce transmitted and reflected waves in the same way as the basic geometry; however, the overall effect is weaker waves with longer wave lengths arriving back at the exhaust port. Although the waves have smaller peak amplitudes, the effect on volumetric efficiency is greater due to the longer interaction times of the waves with the cylinder and crankcase. If the number of steps increased to n diverging steps and m converging steps, the equations shown represent the plane waves as well as the transmission and reflection factors for each change in cross section.

[[Image:Pipe_eqtns_step.PNG|center|geometry and equations for stepped pipe]]

[[Image:Boundaries2.PNG|center|reflection and transmission coefficients for step]]

The graph below shows qualitatively how pressure at the exhaust port varies with crank angle for both basic and tapered pipe geometry.

[[Image:Qualitative_EPP.PNG|center|qualitative different between EPP for basic and tapered pipes]]

The important differences to notice in the graph are the relative magnitudes and durations of the positive and negative pressure waves arriving back at the exhaust port at TPO and EPC. In this graph, if we pin down the waves with respect to time along the horizontal axis and then we increase or decrease the RPM, the effect will be that the positions of the port timing will no longer match up with the same positions of the waves. This is due to the fact that, as mentioned above, the wave speed is independent of RPM. In more detail if we increase the RPM it would have the effect of shrinking the port timing scale while keeping EPO in the same position. If we increase the RPM, the port timing scale expands with EPO remaining in the same position.

Looking at things the other way around, if we change some aspects of the pipe geometry we can see how they change wave propagation in the pipe and hence operation of the pipe with respect to the engine.
*Length of the pipe between the exhaust port and the diverging section (L1) - this length set by the difference in crank angle between EPO and TPO and the desired effective RPM range of the pipe. Making the section longer would fit a lower RPM range or a greater difference between the crank angle of EPO and TPO.
*Length of the belly section - this length is set by the difference in crank angle between TPO and EPC and the desired effective RPM range of the engine. This length and L1 are interdependent since the crank angles are also interdependent, (e.g. EPC=(0-EPO)).
*The angle of the diverging/converging sections - changing this angle from steep angled cone (interior angle &gt; 90 degrees) to a shallow angle cone (interior angle &lt; 90 degrees) has the effect of broadening out the wave length. This increases the effective band RPM band width of the pipe since there greater flexibility of crank angle for which an appropriate pressure will at the exhaust port. This also has the effect of decreasing the maximum attainable volumetric efficiency of the pipe since the peak pressure amplitude is diminished by spreading out the waves energy over a longer wavelength. Note that if the diameter of section L1 and the belly section are kept constant, changing the angle and changing the length of the diverging/converging section is geometrically the same.
*The ratio of the cross section of section L1 and the belly section - the ratio is largely dependent on the desired angle and length of the diverging/converging sections and the minimum diameter desired to avoid impeding the flow of the exhaust gases.
== Further Investigation ==
For further investigate of the operation of two-stroke engines with tuned exhaust pipes it is most appropriate to analyze actual test data. For this we can go to the TFX website where they demonstrate their testing and data analysis software, or read the paper referenced below titled &quot;Exhaust Gas Flow Behavior in a Two-Stroke Engine.

For the class presentation I would like to do both given sufficient time.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Single units of carbohydrates called [[Structural Biochemistry/Carbohydrates/Monosaccharides|'''monosaccharides''']] may undergo various reactions to form '''carbohydrate derivatives'''. Derivatives in case of carbohydrates often means modification of sugar molecules by addition substituents other than hydroxyl group.  Amino sugars, acidic sugars, deoxy sugars, sugar alcohols, glycosylamines, and sugar phosphates are examples of carbohydrate derivatives. After modification, a transformed molecule of sugar resembles structure of a sugar and an added substituent; however, it is not considered as sugar anymore because its function and characteristics has changed. For instance, sugar alcohols are still have sweet taste, but not completely absorbed by the human body and, therefore, the blood sugar impact of sugar alcohols is less and they provide fewer calories per gram. Thus, some sugar alcohols are widely used as sugar replacement in diet and health-oriented foods especially for individuals with diabetes.   
Most sugar derivatives occur naturally and have important biological functions. For instance, amino sugar heparin occurs in intracellular granules of mast cells that line arterial walls and, when released, inhibits blood clotting. Glycosylamine adenosine is an important part of DNA and RNA structure. Also, due to wide application of sugar derivatives in different areas many of them are commercially synthesized.

== Glucose Family ==

'''&lt;big&gt;The Glucose Family&lt;/big&gt;''' are [[Structural Biochemistry/Carbohydrates/Monosaccharides|monosaccharides]] with functional groups replacing the hydroxyl group at the C-2 carbon or the C-6 group. Each sugar modification has a prominent effect in metabolism.

'''β-D-Glucose'''- This carbohydrate derivative plays a crucial role in metabolism. It is the main source of energy which is starts the process of cellular respiration. It is produced through photosynthesis and is often used in food products. It’s the most common carbohydrate and also circulates through the blood. It is known as blood sugar and can be converted into starch by the body. It is also used in blood tests for diabetes. 

'''β-D-Glucose 6 Phosphate'''-  Plays an important role in glycolysis. It is the final product after glucose is broken down and converted into the energy. The addition of the phosphate group gives the sugar a negative charge which prevents sugars from easily crossing lipid membranes. At elevated levels,  it can inhibit brain hexokinase. It can be converted into starch or glycogen where it is stored in the liver and muscles. It plays an important role in blood glucose levels. Low levels can lead to Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, but the disease is hereditary.  The disease leads to breakdown of red blood cells when exposed to certain environments.

'''β-D-Glucosamine'''- This is also an amino sugar that is very important in the formation of lipids and proteins. This can also form chitin in exoskeletons of insects as well as cell walls of plants. One of its common uses is for osteoarthritis. It helps rebuild cartilage and is used in veterinary medicine. Another of its uses is in helping with joint function and connective tissue. It also helps in body regulation and functions with β-D-Glucose 6 Phosphate in the body.

'''N-Acetyl- β-D-Glucosamine'''- This sugar is essential for optimal health and function in the body. It aids in cell communication. It also plays a role in how the immune system reacts with HIV and tumors. This also plays a role in osteoarthritis and helps in cartilage formation.  It has been shown to play a role in nerve functioning for learning in mammals. This molecule has multiple uses such as limiting cholesterol absorption and decreases insulin secretion. Some receptors have been found in the thyroid to transport iodine proteins.  It is found in multiple glands of the body and plays some role in the organ’s function.
Muramic Acid-This sugar is a main component of bacteria cell walls and it is a derivative of peptidoglycan. It is used in gas chromatography for laboratory experiments. 

'''N-Acetylmuramic Acid'''- This is also found in peptidoglycans of bacterial cell walls. It is a the product after N-acetylglucosamine that has been condensed with lactic acid. In bacteria, phosphophoenolpyruvate adds the lactyl group to C3 of N-acetylglucosamine. Beta-lactams compete for binding with transpeptidases, enzymes that catalyze the formation bonds between N-acetylmuramic acid-based peptide chains. Chlamydia lacks N-acetylmuramic acid in its cell walls which is the reason why penicillin does not treat the disease.

'''β-D-Glucuronate'''-This molecule is a highly polar molecule. It is used to increase solubility of some drugs. It is incorporated into proteoglycans and then combined with steroid hormones. This molecule forms to help make compounds more soluble for excretion. Bilirubin is one of the main molecules that this molecule makes soluble. This compound is very useful in clearing drugs from the body and making them soluble so that drugs can be processed through the body.

'''β-D-Gluconate''' – This is used as an alkalinizing agent for fluid therapy. It can be used in cleaning products because it dissolves mineral deposits. An alkaline solution will aid in dissolving the minerals faster. It can slowly be metabolized into bicarbonate, but the effects are longer lasting. It is an acidic sugar that occurs naturally in plants, honey, and fruits. It can be prepared through fermentation of glucose as well. When combined with calcium, it can form a gel to treat burns that are caused by hydrofluoric acid.

'''&lt;big&gt;Amino sugars&lt;/big&gt;''' are generally known as [[Structural Biochemistry/Carbohydrates/Monosaccharides|monosaccharide]] carbohydrate sugars that have replaced an -NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; amine group with the 2'-carbon hydroxyl substituent. The most abundant amino sugar is one of the oldest and most abundant organic compounds on Earth. More than 60 amino sugars are known, many of them having been isolated and identified only recently as components of antibiotics. Examples of amino sugars include:

*[[N-Acetylglucosamine|''N''-Acetylglucosamine]]
*[[Galactosamine]]
*[[Glucosamine]]
*[[Sialic acid]]
*[[L-Daunosamine]]

'''Galactosamine''', for example, is one of eight essential amino acids that function in cell to cell interaction. Though research on galactosamine has just begun, research has shown that it may help those with joint inflammations. Lacking in galactosamine may even be one of the factors related to heart disease. Also, it may also function as a toxin leading to liver failure. In addition, galactosamine may also function as one of the sugars composing the follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and the luteinizing hormone (LH), both of which are needed in the reproductive processes of the human body. Sources of galactosamine include bovine (which includes both cattle and oxen), red algae and shark meat.

'''Glucosamine''', contrary to galactosamine is a very popular and relatively well-known amino sugar that our bodies use to produce glycoconjugates like glycosylated lipids and proteins. Glucosamine has a structural role in composing the hard exoskeleton of chitins, such as a variety of arachnids, crustaceans, and insects. Our bodies can obtain glucosamine from external sources such as the fermentation of different grains, like wheat and rice and barley, and like galactosamine, from bovine and shark. As far as its effect on bodily functions, glucosamine's precursor, glucosaminoglycans are major segments involved in joint cartilage, and thus can help in the treatment of osteoporosis, or osteoarthritis.

'''Sialic Acid''' is a very important sugar amine necessary to our bodies' mental and physical well being. Without sialic acid, our bodies would deteriorate in both aspects. For example, children found lacking in this particular sugar amine have been known to be adversely affected in their development, growth and in the pigmentation of their hair and skin. In a study done by Bing Wang et al., improved sialic acid concentrations in infants proved to improve their synaptogenesis and their neurological development. However,  although sialic acid may serve to help us, it may also be the culprit that allows different viruses to enter. Sialic acid is normally found on the surfaces of cell membranes, it is not only responsible for fluid uptake to its negatively charged regions, but it also has the ability to recognize and bind to proteins on certain viruses, such as ''Hemagglutinin'' which is found on the cell surface of the Influenza virus. Thus, once the two bind together, it opens a door for the virus to enter into the cell and spread to other parts of the body, causing injurious repercussions.

''''N-Acetyl-d-glucosamine'''' is the main component of the polysaccharide in chitin, the substance that makes up the tough outer skeleton of arthropods and insects.

== Deoxy Sugars ==
[[Image:Deoxyribose structure.svg|thumb|Deoxyribose|150px]]
[[Image:Beta L-fucose.svg‎‎‎|thumb|Fucose|150px]]
[[Image:Beta-L-Rhamnopyranose.svg|thumb|Rhamnose|150px]]

'''&lt;big&gt;Deoxy sugars&lt;/big&gt;''' are carbohydrate derivatives that are lacking an -OH hydroxyl group at the 2'-Carbon of the sugar cyclic ring, hence &quot;deoxy,&quot; de- being a prefix meaning &quot;to remove,&quot; and &quot;oxy&quot; representing &quot;oxygen.&quot;

'''Deoxyribose''' is the most commonly known deoxy sugar because it is the exact sugar used in the backbone of our DNA double helices. Scientists speculate that the deoxyribose sugar derivative was used as opposed to ribose because of its more stable structure. Unlike ribose, it doesn't contain a hydroxyl group at its 2'-Carbon, which would otherwise make it susceptible to hydrogen bonding with other species or molecules, thus disrupting the kind of stable matrix that our DNA needs to have. In the DNA backbone, deoxyribose sugars are bound to phosphate groups via phosphodiester linkages, and are each covalently attached to one of the four DNA nitrogenous bases. They therefore play very important roles in in the flexibility of the DNA backbone and in ensuring that the polar nitrogenous bases are facing into the double helix rather than outwards where they would be unstably exposed to hydrophobic media.

'''Fucose''', although less talked about in our science books, is also an essential sugar derivative needed to maintain our bodies' overall well-being and proper development. Fucose is known to be excreted by nursing mothers, and in recent studies has shown to have a significant role in the fetal development of newborns, as well as to the advancement of their immune systems. Fucose and its derivatives also ensure the proper transmission of nerve signals or cell to cell communication, improve the brain's long-term memory and even play an important role in inhibiting the spread of tumor and cancerous cells.

'''Rhamnose''' is not as well known, and for a while scientists had trouble studying this sugar and understanding what it's purpose was in the body. In fact, it used to be thought of as an inert deoxy sugar. It is also unusual in the sense that unlike most other sugars, it's natural occurring form is its L configuration (i.e. L-Rhamnose as opposed to D-Rhamnose). Interestingly enough, Rhamnose sugar can be extracted from poison sumac. Generally, rhamnose is found mostly in the cells of plants and bacteria rather than animals. Rhamnose may participate in the body in cell proliferation, collagen synthesis and in the degradation of free radicals.

'''&lt;big&gt;'''Dideoxy and Trideoxy Sugars'''&lt;/big&gt;'''

Dideoxy sugars and trideoxy sugars are sugars where two or three of the hydroxyl groups, respectively, are replaced with hydrogen atoms.  These sugars are most commonly made by plants, fungi and bacteria.  Over one hundred different sugars of these types have been isolated from prokaryotic sources alone.&lt;br&gt;
Di and trideoxy sugars are found attached to the lipopolysaccharides that are embedded in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, as well as in other areas of these bacteria’s S-layer.  They are also found on the S-layer of Gram-positive bacteria, which is the outer peptidoglycan membrane which is thicker in Gram-positive bacteria than in Gram-negative bacteria.  In medicine, these rare sugars are used in antibiotic, antifungal, anthelminitic and antitumor agents, and are therefore quite valuable to science.

''''''Their Synthesis''''''

The enzymes concerned with their production are largely unknown, mainly because these unusual dideoxy and trideoxy sugars are not commercially available, so not much study has gone on concerning them thus far.  However, the overall method of their synthesis has been observed.  In the biosynthesis of these dideoxysugars and trideoxysugars, one of the most important intermediates to form is NDP-4-keto-6-deoxyglucose (where NDP stands for nucleotidyl diphosphate).  This molecule serves as the branching point for hundreds of different di and trideoxy sugars.  Its synthesis undergoes two basic steps (illustrated in Steps 1 and 2).

# In Step 1, α-D-glucose-1-phosphate is attached to an NMP moiety using a nucleotidyltransferase type enzyme.  Which particular enzyme depends on which nucleotide is included in the reaction, as each nucleotide has a unique shape.
# In Step 2, the carbon number 6 is reduced, removing the hydroxyl to give a CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; instead of the original CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH.  Also, the carbon number 4 hydroxyl group is oxidized, leaving one double-bonded oxygen in its place.  This step is catalyzed by another enzyme given the name NDP-glucose-4,6-dehydratase.
# Step 3 shows seven enzymatic reaction types commonly utilized to form the plethora of possible di and trideoxy sugars (see illustration).  These are the reactions where many of the enzymes involved still remain unknown.  Their discovery and determinations of their structures and more detailed function is the next step for biochemists in the field of dideoxy and trideoxysugars.

== Acidic Sugars ==
[[File:Beta D-Glucuronic acid.svg|thumb|150px|Glucuronic acid]] 
[[File:L-Ascorbic acid.svg|thumb|150px|Vitamin C or ascorbic acid]]

'''&lt;big&gt;Acidic Sugars&lt;/big&gt;'''- According to Brønsted and Lowry, an acid is defined as any molecule that has the ability to donate one of its hydrogens (protons).  It is this losing of a proton that makes a molecule acidic.  As far as sugars go, a sugar's simplest structure is called a [[Structural Biochemistry/Carbohydrates/Monosaccharides|monosaccharide]] (if you think of it in SAT terms: atom is to element as monosaccharide is to sugar),  and what makes a sugar acidic is the oxidation of one of its -OH groups after a hydrogen (proton) has been &quot;lost&quot; turning the carbon into a carbonyl carbon (carboxyl group) making an acid out of the molecule.
=== Some Of The Most Commonly Found Acidic Sugars ===
'''Glucuronic Acid''':  Glucuronic acid derives from Alpha D-glucose by means of oxidation.  Mechanism can be found here [http://i228.photobucket.com/albums/ee31/Callipygians/glucuronicacid-1.jpg](image drawn by author using a chemistry drawing program from https://scifinder.cas.org).  The most common function of glucuronic acid is in the metabolism of foreign compounds (i.e. medication or poisons) in an organism.  This molecule is extremely important to the chemists who make and design drugs as it is pertinent to know if and how a medication will be metabolized in the body. Glucuronic acid in Greek is called &quot;sweet urine&quot; which is a sugar that exists in urine. The acid functions to bind together toxins, such as drugs, hormones and steroids, found in the liver, helping them flush out from the body. Glucuronic acid is often used as a detoxicating agent which can help with drug overdosing and minimizing drug interaction within the body. Recent studies also show how Glucuronic Acid prevents prostate cancer in men by detoxing chemicals within the body.
'''Ascorbic Acid''':  Ascorbic acid is most commonly known by the name Vitamin C (the L-enantiomer of ascorbic acid).  Because of its ease in being able to oxidize, vitamin C has been used for such things as a preservative.  It is also known as a cure for scurvy (a lack of vitamin C in the body).  This was most common back in the day when sailors or pirates would go out on long trips on the ocean, their supply of fruit would expire and they would have no source of vitamin C and thus get scurvy.  Since human bodies cannot produce vitamin C on their own, we must be able to get our vitamin C from the food and fruits that we eat. Ascorbic Acid also has antioxidant properties which can help protect nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, and other cell organelles from free radicals such as hydroxyl radicals (reactive oxygen molecules) that could else wise be damaging and tumor-inducing. The oxidized version of ascorbic acid is relatively safe, unreactive, and can be metabolized without any problems. However, an excess amount of ascorbate, which is an oxidized ascorbic acid molecule, could potentially promote and initiate instead of limiting free radical reactions within a living system.

==Artificial Sweeteners==
Artificial sweeteners provide the same, if not more, sweetness of the sugar without the high calories or subsequent tooth decay that accompanies sugar consumption. 

===Aspartame===
[[File:Aspartame-residues.png|thumb|Chemical structure of aspartame. Red is the aspartic acid residue, blue is the phenylalanine residue, pink is the methoxy end-group]]This sugar substitute, known on the market as NutraSweet (for baking purposes) or Equal, was discovered in 1965, but not approved by the FDA until 1981. It is 180 times as sweet as sucrose and contains 4 calories per gram, which is considered negligible. It is unstable in heat and decomposes in liquid during prolonged storage. However, although the aspartame may decompose in liquid, it is not hazardous for consumption. The break-down of aspartame only affects the quality of the beverage. Aspartame is a dipeptide consisting of two amino acids in an ester bond with methanol. Aspartic acid is at the N-terminus and phenylalanine is at the C-terminus where it bonds with methanol. Aspartame is metabolized in the gastrointestinal tract, where the peptide and ester bonds are broken, separating the amino acids and the methanol. The effects of the increase in methanol concentration from the breakdown of aspartame in the body was studied by Soffritti, et al. in Italy. This group studied rats and the effect of high dosages of aspartame in linkage to lymphomas and leukemia. It was found that lymphomas and leukemia increased in the female rats at dosages around the acceptable daily intake (ADI). And the levels increased in male rats only at the highest dosage which was 100 times the ADI. They also noticed that increasing the methanol intake through water increased the leukemia, as did the addition of methyl-ter-butyl ether (MTBE) which metabolizes to produce methanol. Methanol in the body turns into formaldehyde which can turn into formic acid. The study also showed that increasing the amount of formaldehyde increased the leukemia and lymphomas. While this study seems to indicate that aspartame consumption is a risky health hazard, there is much criticism for the study. For one, the group did not allow another group to examine their samples which goes against the customary procedure of verification. In addition, the FDA has criticized this lab in the past for conducting unreliable work.
&lt;br /&gt;
While the validity of aspartame being a health hazard is being questioned, it is known for a fact that aspartame is quite hazardous to individuals with [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Enzyme Phenylalanine Hydrozylase (PAH)|Phenylketonuria (PKU)]]. Those with PKU cannot metabolize phenylalanine which causes a toxic amount of phenylalanine to accumulate in the body if substances that contain phenylalanine, like aspartame, are consumed.

===Saccharin===
[[File:Saccharin-2D-skeletal.png|thumb|Saccharin]]
Also known as Sweet-N-Low, saccharin is one of the oldest artificial sweeteners. It is 300 times as sweet as sucrose. Saccharin was discovered at Johns Hopkins University in 1879 in the course of research on coal-tar derivatives. Its name, which comes from the Latin word for sugar, saccharin, has no structural relationship to any sugar. Saccharin itself isn't very soluble in water. However, the proton bonded to nitrogen is fairly acidic and saccharin is normally marketed as its water-soluble sodium or calcium salt. Its earliest applications were in as a replacement for sugar in the diet of diabetics before insulin became widely available. The enhanced sweetness permits less to be used and therefore reducing the cost of production. Using less carbohydrate-based sweetener also reduces the number of calories.

===Sucralose===
[[File:Sucrose.svg|thumb|left|Sucrose. Orange color indicates where molecule differs from sucralose]][[File:Sucralose.svg|thumb|left|Sucralose. Orange color indicates where molecule differs from sucrose]]

&lt;br /&gt;
More popularly known as Splenda, sucralose is 600 times sweeter than sucrose. It is very similar to the disaccharide structure of sucrose. Three of the hydroxyl groups are simply replaced by chloride atoms. Although this change does make the molecule more likely to react with nucleophiles and could present as a danger due to the addition of chlorine, it is not a cause for concern. The levels of chlorine are no different than in comparison to consumption of table salt which is made of sodium chloride, and is harmless in moderation. Sucralose is considered calorie-free because the body does not to recognize the molecule as sugar, so it does not get broken down for energy.

What is a fishery?  A fishery is a population of a species of fish.  Fishermen need to go to the river with an approach that is suited for the fish that they are trying to catch.  Normally there is considerable diversity in the different species of fish.  Some fish however are commonly targeted and they are called game fish.  These fish are normally edible, widespread, and are exciting to catch.  In the Eastern United states common game fish include Musky, Northern Pike, Walleye, Sauger, Smallmouth Bass, Brown Trout, Flathead and Channel Catfish.

==Ecological Niche==
While a good angler can correctly identify and knows the general preferences of the kind of fish he is pursuing; an good angler uses an approach best suited for this type of fish.  This approach is not based on species (kind) so much on the ecological niche that the fish occupies. 

Sometimes one kind of fish might occupy more than one ecological niche. For example, small to medium trout are normally drift eaters that eat insects.  However, Large trout overtime switch to a diet of minnows and small fish and utilize different water features to maximize caloric intake.  An angler whom is targeting large trophy trout fish different waters, use different bait(lures), and approach a waterway completely different.

It is also normal for an angler to catch different species whom occupy the same ecological niche.  For example, Northern Pike and Muskies are both top level predators in many rivers through the Northeast.  It is very possible while fishing for them to catch a northern pike and one cast and a musky on another. 

Generally you could summarize most game fish as belonging to the following ecological niches:
*Top level predator.  Large predatory fish that attack large minnows and other game fish.  They are generally not particularly wary but sometimes are picky;  only striking at the most vulnerable target.  Northern Pike, Musky and flathead catfish.
*Mid level predator.  Predatory fish that get get most of there food in the form of minnows and other living creatures.  However, Its smaller size makes it more wary. Smaller Pike, Large trout, bass and walleye.
*Small Food eaters.  The last group of predatory fish eats primarily invertebrates (insects) or heavily feed upon fry, small minnows and/or crustaceans.  Many immature game fish are in this category but generally only the trout focuses on insects through much of its life.  Some kinds of panfish such as crappies are heavily targeted by anglers and are in this category.  

*Diverse Eaters.  This category is a catch all for those fish that don't easily fall into one of the other category.  Fishing for these fish requires a specific focus on the fish and its feeding habits.  Feeding habits can be very diverse; examples include channel catfish (that scavenge for dead organisms), fish that might have strong vegetarian tendencies (common carp) or fish that are in a waterway mainly to spawn that might strike a lure out of reflex (steelhead or river-run salmon).

==Important common characteristics==
When we target a fish, we first seek a broad understanding of its ecological niche.  Many approaches target an entire ecological niche and we may need no more specific understanding to be effective.  Its important to keep in mind common characteristics of the fish in a given ecological niche.  Generally, its feeding behavior is the most important common characteristic to keep in mind; as it helps us understand the location, and gives us insight into effective approaches.  Anglers might want to even more specifically target a species.  Each species in a given ecological niche will have minor differences.  Being aware of these differences and tailoring out approach to them, can allow one to be a little more successful.

==Specialization or Generalization==
thus one might think this advice is at odds.  Should an angler carefully target a given species, even perhaps with a given technique, or should he be more general?  Of course part of this depends on whether you are seeking a trophy, an experience or a meal... but I think the answer is that an angler should have a broad knowledge, experience with many techniques, and constantly experiment as he fishes. A fishermen will learn in time, what works and what doesn't.  Common characteristics merely provide the beginning of his education.  Once he starts catching fish we can vary his approach noticing what he is catching; given slightly different approaches, locations, and time.  As he slowly builds his skills he can alter his approach for conditions and minimize fishless hours.  This perspective, it seems is the best for those (such as myself) that value the experience, more than just fish in the freezer or just trophies on the wall.

Transportation systems are subject to constraints and face questions of resource allocation. The topics of supply and demand, as well as of equilibrium and disequilibrium, arise and give shape to the use and capability of the transportation system.

== What is Transportation Economics?  ==
[[File:TE-Venn-1.png|thumb|right|250px|Traditionally, transport economics has been thought of as the intersection of microeconomics and civil engineering.]]
[[File:TE-Venn-2.png|thumb|right|250px|Alternatively, traditional microeconomics is just a special case of transport economics, with fixed space and time, or where the good being moved is money.]]

'''Transport Economics''' is the study of the movement of people and goods over space and time. It is a branch of [[w:economics|economics]] that deals with the allocation of resources within the transport sector. Historically, it has been thought of as the intersection of microeconomics and civil engineering, as shown on the right.

However, if we think about it, traditional microeconomics is just a special case of transport economics, with fixed space and time, and where the good being moved is money, as illustrated on the right.

Topics traditionally associated with Transport Economics include Privatization, Nationalization, Regulation, Pricing, Economic Stimulus, Financing, Funding, Expenditures, Demand, Production, and Externalities.

== Demand Curve ==

How much would people pay for an &quot;A&quot; in a transportation class?

* How many people would pay $5000 for an A?
* How many people would pay $500 for an A?
* How many people would pay $50 for an A?
* How many people would pay $5 for an A?

If we draw out these numbers, with the price on the Y-axis, and the number of people willing to pay it on the X-axis, we trace out a usually nonlinear demand curve. With the exception of unusually ethical or ridiculous groups, the lower the price, the greater the number of people who are willing to pay. This rule applies to any good or service, such as the price of gasoline, which would get a similar, but not identical, curve.

== Demand and Budgets in Transportation ==

It is often said, &quot;Travel is a derived demand.&quot; There would be no travel without the activities being undertaken at the trip ends.  Travel is seldom consumed for its own sake, except the occasional &quot;Sunday Drive&quot; or nature walk. On the other hand, there is always a need for people to leave home: a 20-30 minute separation between the home and workplace is common, and 60-90 minutes of travel per day total is common, even for nonworkers. We know that the more expensive something is, the lesser the quantity that will be consumed. For example, if gas prices doubled, there would be less travel. Similarly, the longer it takes to get from A to B, the less likely it is that people will go from A to B.

In short, we are dealing with a downward sloping demand curve, where the curve itself depends not only on the characteristics of the good in question, but also on its complements or substitutes.

[[Image:DemandForTravel.png|thumb|A graph of travel demand, against costs.]]

== The Shape of Demand ==

When working with demand, we need to estimate two things. First, the shape of demand (is it linear or curved, convex or concave, what function best describes it). Second, the sensitivity of demand for a particular thing (a mode, an origin destination pair, a link, a time of day) to price and time in the short run and the long run—in other words, its elasticity.
* Are the choices continuous (the number of miles driven) or discrete (car vs. bus)?
* Are we treating demand as an absolute or a probability?  
* Does the probability apply to individuals (disaggregate) or the population as a whole (aggregate)?  
* What is the trade-off between money and time? 
* What are the effects on demand as a function of the time and money costs of competitive or complementary choices (cross elasticity)?

== Supply Curve ==

How much would a person need to pay you to write an &quot;A&quot;-worthy 20 page term paper for a given transportation class?

* How many would write it for $100,000?
* How many would write it for $10,000?
* How many would write it for $1,000?
* How many would write it for $100?
* How many would write it for $10?

If we draw out these numbers for all the potential entrepreneurial people available, we trace out a supply curve. The lower the price, the lesser the number of people who are willing to supply the paper.

== Supply and Demand Equilibrium ==
[[Image:TransportationSupplyAndDemand.png|thumb|right|300px|An illustration of equilibrium between supply and demand.]]

As with earning grades, transportation is not free; it costs both time and money. In transportation economics, costs are represented by a supply curve, which rises with the amount of travel demanded. As described above, demand (for example, the number of vehicles which want to use a facility) depends on the price: the lower the price, the higher the demand. These two curves intersect at a point of equilibrium. In the example figure, they intersect at a toll of $0.50 per km, and flow of 3000 vehicles per hour. Time is usually converted to money to simplify analysis.

Costs may be ''variable'', and can include users' time and out-of-pockets costs. Out-of-pocket costs can be paid on a per trip or per distance basis, for example, tolls and gasoline, or ''fixed'', for example, insurance or buying an automobile, which are only borne once in a while and are independent an individual trip's cost.

== Equilibrium in a Negative Feedback System ==
[[Image:NegativeFeedback.png|thumb|Negative feedback loop]]

Supply and Demand comprise the economists' view of transportation systems. They are equilibrium systems. This means a system subject to a negative feedback process:

An increase in ''A'' causes a decrease in ''B''. An increase in ''B'' causes an increase in ''A''. In math terminology, ''A'' is inversely proportional to ''B'', while ''B'' is directly proportional to ''A'', thus indirectly causing itself to decrease.

Example: If ''A'' is Traffic Congestion and ''B'' is Traffic Demand, then increased congestion reduces demand, but increased demand increases congestion.

== Disequilibrium ==

Many elements of the transportation system, however, do not necessarily result in equilibrium. Take the case where an increase in ''A'' causes an increase in ''B''. An increase in ''B'' causes an increase in ''A''. An example where an increase in ''A'', Traffic Demand, causes an increase in ''B'', Gas Tax Revenue, which causes an increase in Road Building, which in turn causes an increase in traffic demand. This example assumes that the gas tax generates more demand from the resultant road building than it costs in sensitivity to demand and the price, in other words, that the investment is worthwhile. This is dubbed a positive feedback system, and in some contexts a &quot;Virtuous Circle&quot;, where the &quot;virtue&quot; is the value judgment (though this &quot;virtue&quot; may not necessarily be positive).

Similarly, there is an opposing &quot;Vicious Circle&quot;, where a decrease in ''A'' causes a decrease in ''B'', and a decrease in ''B'' causes a decrease in ''A''. A classic example of this is where ''A'' is Transit Service and ''B'' is Transit Demand. Again &quot;vicious&quot; is a value judgment. A decrease in service results causes a decrease in the number of transit riders, and a decrease in transit riders reduces claims on transportation resources, leading to more service cutbacks.

These systems interact, for example, an increase in road building may attract transit riders to cars, while the additional drivers pay gas taxes, which generate more roads.

[[Image:PositiveFeedbackVirtuous.png|thumb|Positive feedback loop (virtuous circle).]]
[[Image:PositiveFeedbackVicious.png|thumb|Positive feedback loop (vicious circle).]]

One might ask whether positive feedback systems converge or diverge. The answer is that it depends on the system, and, in particular, when or where the system is observed. There might be some point where, no matter how many additional roads are built, there will be no more traffic demand, as all the drivers already consume the maximum amount of travel that can be attained. We have yet to reach that point for roads, but on the other hand, we have done so for many goods. In most parts of the United States, the price of water probably does not affect how much water used, and a lower price for tap water would not increase the rate of consumption. Substitutes (bottled water, water delivery services, rainwater collection) might be used if their prices were lower, or tap water were costlier. Price would probably affect behaviors such as lawn watering and car washing more than behaviors such as drinking.

== Provision ==

The business of providing transportation services spans both public and private sectors.

* Roads are generally publicly owned in the United States, though the same is not true of highways in other countries. Furthermore, public ownership has not always been the norm; many countries had a long history of privately owned turnpikes, for example, in the United States private roads were common from the beginning of its history through the early 1900s.

* Railroads are generally private.

* Carriers (Airplane, Bus, Truck, and Train Operators) are often private firms.

* Formerly private urban transit operators have been taken over by local government since the 1950s in a process called [[w:municipalization|municipalization]]. With the rise of the automobile, transit systems steadily lost passengers and money.

The situation is complicated by the idea of contracting or franchising. Often private firms operate &quot;public transit&quot; routes, either under a contract, a fixed price, or an agreement where the private firm collects the revenue on the route (a franchise agreement). Franchises may be subsidized if the route is losing money, or may require bidding if the route is profitable. Private provision of public transportation is common in the United Kingdom.

== Principles ==

Specific principles of highway transportation include:

* Users commit a significant amount of their own time to the consumption of the final good. In other words, they spend time traveling. You can think of it as part of the &quot;cost&quot; of using the service. While the contribution of user time is found in all sectors to some extent, this fact is a dominant feature of highway travel.
* Links are routes of transportation. They are collected into large bundles which comprise a route. Individual links may be only a small share of the bundle. If we begin by assuming each link is &quot;autonomous&quot;, then the final consumption bundle includes a large number of imperfect complements.
* Highway networks have very specialized geometries. Competition, in the form of alternative routes between the point of origin and destination, is almost always present. Nevertheless there are large degrees of spatial monopoly; each link occupies a unique space, and spatial location affects the user's contribution, time.
* There are significant congestion effects which occur both with and without pricing.
* Users choose not only a route for a trip, but whether to make that trip in the first place, to change the destination, or to delay travel on the highway network. These choices are determined by user's previous experiences. See [[w:Reward_(psychology)|reward systems]].
* Individual links may serve multiple markets (origin-destination pairs). There are economies achieved by using the same links on routes serving different markets. This is one factor leading to a hierarchy of roads.
* Quantity cannot be controlled in the short term. Once a road is deployed, it is in the network, with its entire capacity available for use. However, roads are difficult to deploy, responses to demand are slow, and for practical purposes, deployment is irrevocable.

== Thought questions ==

# Should the government subsidize public transportation? Why or why not?
# Should the government operate public transportation systems?
# Is building roads a good idea even if it results in more travel demand?

Using a plural pronoun is confusing.  For example, in

it's not clear when the leader is sending the follower back

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You have a sequence of items and you would like to perform several sequential operations on each of the items in the sequence.

== Method ==
You would like to use a single function where you pass a series of functions as parameters to that function.

== Background on Functional Languages ==
Functional languages are languages that treat functions as first-order data types.  They frequently have a function that you pass a list of items and tell it what function to perform on each of those items.  Just like XML transformations, functional languages are ideal when you have many small tasks to perform on a large number of items.  Functional languages are excellent for these tasks since the actual order that the functions get executed on items does not have to be guaranteed.  The developer does not have to be concerned about waiting for a transformation on item 1 to finish before the system starts on item 2.

The Google [[w:MapReduce|MapReduce]] algorithm is an example of functional systems.  MapReduce allows a data set such as &quot;all web sites&quot; to be treated as a sequence of items.  MapReduce then has different processors each receive small items of work that can be processes independently.

For more on functional languages see [[w:Functional programming|Functional programming on Wikipedia]] and [[Computer programming/Functional programming|Functional Programming on Wikibooks]].

Because XQuery is also a functional language, you can also have the confidence that a large list of items passed off to an XQuery function can run independently on many processors without the concern of incorrect results if the items are processed out of order.

== Simple example ==
In the following example we will declare two functions.  We will then process a list of words by applying these functions to each of the items in the sequence.  We will do this by passing the function name as an argument to another function.

NOTE: This only appears to work in eXist 1.3.  eXist versions 1.2.X have the wrong data type associated with the QName() function.

The eXist system needs to turn each function into a function identifier.  To do this it needs to call '''util:function()'''.  util:function takes two arguments, the qualified name of the function (the prefix and the function name) as well as the arity of the function.  In this case the [[w:Arity|arity]] of a function is the number of arguments that the function takes.  The data type of the first argument must be of type QName.  The data type of the arity, the second parameter, is an integer.


&lt;code&gt;util:function($function as xs:QName, $arity as xs:integer) as function&lt;/code&gt;


&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare namespace fw = &quot;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/fw&quot;;

declare function fw:apply($words as xs:string*, $my-function as function)  {
   for $word in $words
   return util:call($my-function,$word)
};

declare function fw:f1($string) {
   string-length($string)
};

declare function fw:f2($string) {
    substring($string,1,1)
};

let $f1 := util:function(QName(&quot;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/fw&quot;,&quot;fw:f1&quot;),1)

let $mywords := (&quot;red&quot;,&quot;green&quot;,&quot;purple&quot;)
return 
  &lt;hofs&gt;
     &lt;data&gt;{$mywords}&lt;/data&gt;
     &lt;hof&gt;
         &lt;task&gt;length of each string&lt;/task&gt;
         &lt;result&gt;{fw:apply($mywords,$f1)}&lt;/result&gt;
      &lt;/hof&gt;
      &lt;hof&gt;
        &lt;task&gt;Initial letter of each string&lt;/task&gt;
        &lt;result&gt;{ fw:apply($mywords, util:function(QName(&quot;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/fw&quot;,&quot;fw:f2&quot;),1) ) }&lt;/result&gt;
      &lt;/hof&gt;
       
  &lt;/hofs&gt;
  

&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|How is GPS leaving its mark on mobile society?}}

We will explore how Geographic Information Systems, the Global Positioning System, and mapping are being used together and how this merging of technology is leaving its mark on our mobile society.

==Geographic Information Systems==
Imagine you could represent on a map of an area being considered for development the number of people in every home as well as the age, gender and income of those same people living near by?  This would no doubt be a powerful tool to help the government and urban planners make educated decisions regarding how to develop the area in question.  This is one example of Geographic Information Systems (GIS).  GIS technologies were predominantly used at first by governments and planners for this very purpose.  A common example of how GIS technology is being used today would be entering an address as a point of origin and another one for a destination on MapQuest or Google Maps.  You can then request directions from the first point to the second.  “GIS technology allows users to use a digital map, combined with statistical or other featured information about that area, and conduct spatial analyses (Stone, 1998).”

==Global Positioning System==
In the early 1970s the US government developed Global Positioning System (GPS) as a way to deliver weapons to their targets with more precision.  This technology consists of a network of satellites that send out radio waves.  Devices on earth can use these signals to triangulate a location.  Today, standard civilian GPS technology is used to triangulate to an accuracy of about 10 feet (Mcginn, 2007). 

==GIS and GPS Together==
“By 2004, Garmin’s StreetPilot series offered touch-screen controls and preloaded maps.  Reviewers loved it, and the market took off (Mcginn, 2007).”  Most GPS units today, have software on them that compiles the triangulated coordinates and displays the unit’s location on some kind of map, making them a kind of GIS in their own right.  Drivers, cyclists and joggers alike, have the ability to enter addresses such as in our example above and get verbal, turn by turn directions to get them where they are going.

==Applications==
Today, GPS technology is being used for five primary applications:

'''Navigation:'''  As well as turn by turn directions, GPS technology today offers points of interest, such as restaurants or pet friendly hotels (Mcginn, 2007).  This requires extensive GIS systems running in the background.

'''Emergency location:''' GPS technology is being used as emergency locator beacons by boaters who may fall overboard, downed airplanes, hikers and mountain climbers.

'''Data Logging:''' When live tracking isn’t necessary, a less expensive option is for a unit to log its location every few minutes.  This data can later be downloaded to a computer for analyses.  This way the routs, average speeds of travel and length of stops can be ascertained.

'''Tracking:'''  Real time tracking can be used for various applications such as asset management or security.  High value assets can be tracked in real time in this way.

'''Asset management:''' A fleet manager overseeing a number of service vehicles can more effectively manage routes or identify the closest truck for new service calls using GPS technology (Sheinberg, 2008).

This technology is becoming more and more mainstream as it becomes more accessible and more affordable.  Today, many cellular phones are being equipped with GPS technology.    GPS manufacturers are offering more and more services on their personal navigational devices in hopes of turning them into a daily information portal that will compete with what is being offered on cell phones (Mcginn, 2007).

==Advances==
Some recent advances in this technology include Assisted GPS (AGPS) and Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) GPS.  AGPS is assisted by cellular signals to maintain tracking abilities even when there is no line of site with the GPS satellites (Sheinberg, 2008).  RTK GPS allows a surveyed GPS base station to be used to make real-time corrections to GPS data, raising the GPS accuracy to the centimeter level, within a defined area.  The regional manager of one construction equipment manufacturer says that GPS technology has increased productivity by 40% or more in construction projects (Hildreth, 2007).

Some other applications of personal GPS units include things such as chaperone services, buddy lists overlaid on a map or geocaching.  The chaperone service allows parents to track their kids and receive messages when they arrive at their destination.  The buddy list will send an alarm to users when they are within a certain distance of someone on their buddy list facilitating spur-of-the-moment encounters.  Geocaching is a GPS game best described as a global treasure hunt using web posted coordinates (Hesseldahl, 2007).

==Conclusion==
GPS and GIS technologies have made their marks on today’s mobile society.  Users can obtain navigational and point of interest data on the fly and nearly instantaneously.  They can better track, secure and manage assets.  As these technologies become more commonplace and it becomes more and more accepted to allow commercial entities to track our every move through our GPS enabled personal devices, we should however ask ourselves one question.  Are we getting closer and closer to George Orwell’s representation of our world of the future?

      <text xml:space="preserve">==History==

Determination of the DNA structure would not have been possible if it was not for the work of Erwin Chargaff, an American biochemist. Originally a scientist who did his first work in lipids and lipoproteins, after reading about an experiment of Oswald Avery which showed that DNA was material encoding the genetic information, he turned his work onto DNA.
  
Tetranucleotide hypothesis was the mainstream theory on Chargaff’s time which was proposed by  Phoebus Levene. The theory suggested “that DNA was made up of equal amounts of four bases – adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine – but that it was organized in a way that was too simple to enable it to carry genetic information.” The four bases are held together by hydrogen bonds and they are located inside the DNA helical structure. However, the sugar and phosphate backbone are on the outside of the DNA structure. The two strands are complentary to each other and thus one strand depends on the other. Despite the results of Avery’s experiments that DNA encodes life the scientific community was convinced DNA was relatively too simple to carry genetic information.  Chargaff was not satisfied with the tetranucleotide postulation because of the minimal data that supported it.

==Experiment==

Chargaff and his students collected numerous DNA samples for various organisms.  Using the fairly new technique of paper chromatography, Chargaff and his associates proceeded to separate DNA. The DNA that they collected was subjected to acid.  The acid would then hydrolyze the phospodiester bonds as it would cause a nucleophilic attack on the bond and result in the backbone breaking up.  Once the phosphodiester bonds were broken then the individual nucleotides would then be separated and be free to analyze.  Ultraviolet spectrophotometry was used to analyze the exact amounts of bases that were present in the DNA sample.

UV spectrophotometry showed that there was not an equal amount of purine bases (Adenine and Guanine) and pyrimidine bases (Cytosine and Thymine). Chargaff and his partners showed that the tetranucleotide hypothesis was in fact wrong in assuming that all four bases were in equal amounts.  In other words, the concentration of GC equals to the concentration of AT. However, in mRNA, Thymine is replaced with Uracil. What Chargaff noticed however was that although not all were in equal amounts certain bases were equal to each other.  The base Guanine was equivalent to the amount of cytosine present; and the same held true for Adenine and Thymine.  The ratio of A/T and C/G bases held true for all organisms and for both of the strands that were separated. The noticeable proportionality between one purine base to another pyrimidine base as well as it being true for both strands would be crucial in determining the helical structure of DNA although Chargaff was unable to see it. 

 
The experiment gave two discoveries which is now summarized as Chargaff’s Rule:


1.	The number of Adenine bases is equal to the number of Thymine bases, and number of Cytosine bases is equal to Guanine bases.
Ratio of A=T
Ratio of C=G
Ratio of A + T +C +G = 100%


2.	The proportion of A:T and C:G holds true for both strands.

For example: in human DNA, the four bases Adenine (A), Thymine (T), Cytosine (C), and Guanine (G) are present in these percentages: A= 30.9% and T= 29.4%; G=19.9% and C=19.8%. The A=T and G=C equalities, displays Chargaff's Rule, which actually remained unexplained until the discovery of the double helix by Watson and Crick.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==History==

In 1984, Kary Mullis invented a method to amplify DNA sequences. In previous attempts, DNA polymerase cannot withstand the temperature change. However, Mullis used polymerase from Thermus aquaticus, a bacteria that lives in hot springs in his method, which allowed PCR to be performed at high temperature conditions.

==Overview==
[[File:PCR.jpg|right|700px]]

Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) is a very effective technique of obtaining multiple identical copies of a certain DNA strand (amplifying DNA). PCR can be used for amplifying DNA, mutation DNA, delete DNA, and introduce restriction endonuclease site. PCR is performed by repeating a cycle that consist of several steps. These process is performed after region of target DNA to be amplified (Target Sequence) has been specified. ''Target Sequence'', as its name implies, is a specific part of DNA that is needed for further study. In short, one cycle of PCR consist of these steps:

#'''''Preparation before repetition of PCR cycle:'''''
#* '''Addition of PCR components to solution containing DNA to be amplified'''
#** This step is only performed before the first PCR cycle. Addition of components after the first cycle is not advised because PCR reaction is temperature sensitive (slight change in temperature can greatly affect the reaction)
#** Components to be added are as followed:
#*** '''DNA template''' to be amplify during this process.
#*** '''A pair of primers''' (usually between 10 - 30 nucleotides long) that is complementary to the Flanking Sequence (several bases directly left or right of the target sequence). These two different primers will be referred as primer F (for the forward primer) and primer R (for the reverse primer).
#*** The four '''dNTPs''' (deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates); they are: dATP, dGTP, dCTP, and TTP
#*** '''Magnesium Chloride (MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)''' in order to stabilize the charge of phosphate group and activate the replication process.
#*** '''Heat stable DNA Polymerase'''; heat stability is very important because PCR reaction is performed at various temperatures. This heat stable DNA polymerase is obtained from a thermophilic bacteria ''Thermus aquaticus'', the inhabitant of hot springs. Hence, this DNA polymerase is termed as ''Taq'' DNA Polymerase. Other polymerases with different properties can be used depending on the purpose and requirements of the PCR; Some polymerases, such as Pfu Turbo, for example, have higher fidelity rates but are much more sensitive.
#*** '''Buffer solution''' to stabilize the DNA sample.
#*** To maximize the efficiency of this process, a master mix is made and contained of the primer, MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, buffer, and Taq polymerase.
#** These component must be added in excess to ensure that when the two DNA strands are separated in the second step, the chance of the two DNA to re-hybridize is minimized.

#'''''PCR cycle (perform about 20-30 cycles):'''''
## '''Strand Separation'''
##* Strand separation is performed to expose target sequence and flanking sequence to primer. This step is done by heating the solution, causing the hydrogen bonds maintaining the double helix structure to break.
##* Parameter:
##** Temperature: about 95&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C
##** Time: 15 to 30 seconds (to separate the DNA to 2 single strands)
## '''Hybridization of Primers''' (Also known as the annealing step)
##* At this step, the solution is cooled to around 54&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C. By cooling down the solution, primers are allowed to hybridize with the flanking sequences via hydrogen bonding.
##* It is very possible that the two main strand will re-hybridize because both strands are complimentary to each other. Fortunately, as explained earlier, it can be easily avoided by having excess primers in solution. Excess primers are expected to hybridize with the flanking sequence ''before'' any two complimentary DNA can hybridize.
## '''DNA Synthesis''' (aka elongation step)
##* Solution heated to 72&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C. At this optimal temperature, the ''Taq polymerase'' will start elongates both primers.
##* There are two types of primer; each is the complimentary oligonucleotides of the flanking sequence.
##* Elongation happens not unlike the regular polymerization of DNA. The primers are elongated from the 5' to the 3' ends (which is the opposite direction of the actual DNA strand; strand that have target sequence, flanking sequence, and un-amplified sequence).

#*'''''Note''''':
#** By the end of first cycle, we obtain 2 types of new strand in addition to the original DNA strands. These strands are the elongation of each type of primer. They contain:
#***One of the primer (exp: primer A)
#***The target sequence
#***A complementary of a flanking sequence (the one that is not hybridized to the primer contained in this strand; e.g.: complementary of flanking sequence of primer B)
#***The rest of the non-target sequence after this complimentary of flanking sequence.
#** On the second cycle, some of the primers will hybridize with the new type of sequence obtained on first cycle (exp: on the shorter strand elongated from primer A, primer B will attach to its flanking sequence and start elongates the cycle until it reaches the end of the shorter strand, the flanking sequence of primer A).
#** On the second cycle, the new type of strand formed, ''Short Strand'' consist of:
#***One of the primer (exp: Primer B)
#***The target sequence
#***The flanking sequence that can hybridize with Primer A
#** On the second cycle, besides forming the short strand, the same strands as the one formed on the first cycle can also form.
#** On the second to the n&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; cycle, the short strand is amplified ''exponentially'' while the slightly longer strand (the only strand that form on the first cycle) is amplified  ''arithmetically''.
#**This cycle is repeated ''n'' times. At the ''n&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;'' repetition, there will be 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; of desired sequence.
[[Image:PCR Steps.jpg|thumb|PCR process with detailed steps.Can be repeated in multiple cycle to amplify original DNA structure]]

Finally, the reaction is usually held at 4 degrees Celsius after completion to stabilize the DNA, which is temperature sensitive.

==Additional Steps==

A final elongation step is performed at 70-74°C for at least 5 minutes after the last PCR cycle has been done. This step will guarantee that any remaining DNA strand is fully extended. In addition, a hold step at 4°C for an indefinite time can be utilized for storage of the DNA product. 

==Thermal Cyclers==

[[Image:PCR machine.jpg|thumb|PCR machine that can change temperature constantly. In addition, this machine also has an heated lid to prevent evaporation of DNA sample during the whole process]]
[[Image:New PCR machine.jpg|thumb|PCR machine with a temperature gradient]]
[[Image:PCR tubes.jpg|thumb|PCR tubes]]

The thermal cycler can perform different steps of PCR process by cooling and heating the tubes constantly. They use of the Peltier effect which allows both heating and cooling of the block holding the PCR tubes simply by reversing the electric current. Thin-walled reaction tubes with no RNAase and DNAase are suitable for PCR. Due to their thickness, they can create thermal conductivity to allow for rapid thermal equilibration. As showed in the next picture, most modern thermal cyclers will have heated lids to prevent condensation at the top of the reaction tube and evaporation in the bottom of each tube.
==Results Interpretation==

To ensure the quality of PCR amplification, a gel-electrophoresis is performed. To prepare for this step, a series of steps need to be done before hands

1. '''Preparation 1% agarose gel''': Weight out 1&amp;nbsp;gram of purified agarose and dissolve to 100 ml with TAE (Tris-Acetate) buffer solution. (Figure A)

[[Image:agarose.jpg|thumb|'''Figure A''': Agarose powder (right) and ethidium bromide (left, brown bottle)]]

2. '''Heat up'''. The solution is heated up in microwave until all of agarose particles dissolved completely.

3. '''Addition of ethidium bromide'''. After the solution is cooled down, 5 microliters of ethidium bromide are added to the solution. Ethidium Bromide will attached to DNA molecules and make the strand stand out in UV light background (used as a nucleic acid stain).

4. '''Polymerization of agarose'''. Wait for the agarose to completely polymerize after inserting a well plate to load the samples into. This process can take up to 30 minutes.
[[Image:Agarosepolymerization.jpg|thumb|'''Figure B:''' Polymerization of agarose. The process can take up to 30 minutes. During this process, the tray cannot be moved]]
[[Image:Closeupofdnaaddition.jpg|thumb|'''Figure C''']]
5. '''Addition of buffer solution.''' Fill up the chamber with TAE solution to create a barrier between the outside environment and the DNA sample.

6. '''Addition of DNA sample.''' Loading dye should be added to the DNA samples, and an appropriate DNA ladder run in order to determine the approximate molecular weight of the sample in kilobases.
[[Image:DNA Addition.jpg|thumb|'''Figure D:''' DNA sample is added into the well. Notice that the entire chamber is filled up with TAE buffer solution]]

7. '''Apply electrical current.'''The DNA must be located so it will near the negative charged node and away from the from the positive node.[[Image:Applyelectriccurrent.jpg|thumb|The electric current is applied to the chamber. The top node is connected to the negative node while the bottom part is connected to the positive node.]][[Image:Voltagemachine.jpg|thumb|'''Figure E:''' A voltage machine is in process]]

8. '''Visualize the results using UV light.'''[[Image:UVVisualization.jpg|thumb|'''Figure F:''' UV Visualization of gel]]

== Advantages ==

PCR is a popular method in amplifying DNA because it brings various benefit. Some of those benefits are:
* Researcher does not need to elucidate the sequence of the target sequence. They only need to know the sequence of the flanking sequence.
* Target that are much larger than the primer can still be synthesized.
* Primers prepared does not have to be an exact match of the flanking sequence.
* PCR is very specific.
* PCR is very sensitive to the point that it is able to amplify a single DNA molecule.
* The resultant DNA can be processed further more such as mutation, deletion, or cloning process

== Mechanism ==

In this example, the following convention is used: 
*&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;'''BOLD'''&lt;/font&gt; = flanking sequence and its complimentary sequence
*&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;''ITALICS''&lt;/font&gt; = target sequence and its complimentary sequence
*NORMAL = the remaining sequence (the non amplified part of DNA strand)
*&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''''BOLD/ITALICS'''''&lt;/font&gt;= primers

Sequences formed at various stages of PCR: 
*Original DNA molecule:
...CGCG &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;'''TTG'''&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;''CAGCTACTGACTC''&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;'''CCC'''&lt;/font&gt; CGCG...&lt;br&gt;

*After separation and attacment of primer (beginning of first cycle):
...CGCG &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;'''TTG'''&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;''CAGCTACTGACTC''&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;'''CCC'''&lt;/font&gt; CGCG...&lt;br&gt;

*After first sequence elongation (end of first cycle):
...CGCG &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;'''TTG'''&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;''CAGCTACTGACTC''&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;'''CCC'''&lt;/font&gt; CGCG...&lt;br&gt;

== Practical Applications of PCR ==

Polymerase chain reaction has become an important tool for medical diagnosis. PCR can detect and identify bacteria and viruses that cause infections such as Tuberculosis, Chlamydia, viral meningitis, viral hepatitis, HIV and many others. Once primers are designed for the DNA of a specific organism, using PCR to detect the presence or absence of a pathogen in a patient’s blood or tissue is a simple experiment. Because PCR can easily distinguish among the tiny variations in DNA that each of us posses and that make each of us genetically unique, the method is also leading to new kinds of genetic testing. These tests diagnose not only people with inherited disorders but also people who carry deleterious variations (mutations) that could be passed on to their children. These carriers are usually not themselves affected by the mutant gene but they can lead to a disease in the next generations (e.g. mutations that cause cystic fibrosis). Many of the new genetic tests are the result of the Human Genome Project, the huge international effort to identify and study all human genes. The project is progressing rapidly towards its ultimate goal which is to sequence the entire DNA in typical human cells. Sequencing DNA means to determine the precise order of the four different nucleotides that make up any strand of DNA. DNA sequencing reveals crucial variations in the nucleotides that constitute genes. These mutational changes produce diseases and even death by forcing the genes to produce abnormal proteins or sometimes no protein at all. DNA sequencing involves first isolating and duplicating DNA segment for nucleotide analysis. Thus PCR is an essential tool for the Human Genome Project because it can quickly and easily generate an unlimited amount of any piece of DNA for this kind of study. PCR is a direct way of distinguishing among the confusion of different mutations in a single gene, each of which can lead to a disorder such as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. It also helps doctors track the presence or absence of DNA abnormalities characteristic of a particular cancer so that they can start and stop drug treatment and radiation therapy as soon as possible. PCR promises to greatly improve the genetic matching of donors and recipients for bone marrow transplantation. The technique incomparable ability to identify and copy the smallest amount of even old and damaged DNA has proved exceptionally valuable in the law, especially the criminal law. PCR is an indispensable adjunct to forensic DNA typing- commonly called DNA fingerprinting. Traces of DNA found at a crime scene can also be amplified by using PCR, thereby providing sufficient amount of DNA to match with the suspect’s DNA. DNA is extremely stable molecule, especially when protected from air, light, and water. Under these circumstances, large pieces of DNA can be preserved for thousands of years or longer. Thus PCR provides an excellent method for amplifying such ancient DNA molecules, so that they can be subjected for analysis. This technique can also be used in amplifying DNA from microorganisms that have not yet been isolated and cultured. Sequences from these PCR products can be sources of considerable insight into evolutionary relationships between organisms.

== Variations of PCR ==

Because of the high adaptability of PCR, many new biochemical techniques based on the original PCR method have been invented. Some of the more commonly seen ones are listed below in alphabetical order.

'''Allele-specific PCR ''' is a cloning technique based on single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs). This requires a DNA sequence that has differences between alleles and uses primers whose 3' end encompass the SNP. 

'''Assembly PCR''', more formally known as '''Polymerase Cycling Assembly (PCA)''', is a method of synthesizing long strands of DNA oligonucleotides by applying PCR to small oligonucleotides and then hybridizing them together. The entire process consists of two sets of PCR reactions. The first reaction utilizes forward and reverse primers to anneal together oligonucleotide fragments with complementary sequences. The second reaction uses another set of primers to perform a regular PCR reaction, which amplifies the results of the first reaction. Only the larger oligonucleotide strands are amplified, distinguishing them from the other incomplete shorter fragments. Once the entire reaction is performed, gel electrophoresis may be performed to isolate and identify the completed strands.

'''Asymmetric PCR''' is a biochemical technique that focuses on the amplification of one strand of DNA over the other. To do so, a normal PCR reaction is performed but with either an excess of primers that react to the target strand or absence of primers that react to the complementary strand. This method is utilized in certain types of forensic sequencing and probing, where having only one of the two DNA strands is preferred.

'''Colony PCR''' is a biochemical technique of amplifying DNA in a vector, such as E. Coli bacterial colonies, to identify the target DNA. The first step in the process involves removing a sample of the vector from the growth plate by a sterile toothpick or pipette tip. The sample is transferred to either a PCR master mix or autoclaved water, where a normal PCR reaction is performed to determine whether or not the colony contains the DNA fragment or plasmid of interest.

'''Digital PCR''' simultaneously amplifies thousands of samples.

'''Helicase-dependent amplification''' uses constant temperature instead of cycling through denaturation, annealing, and elongation cycles. DNA helicase, an enzyme, unwinds DNA and used to replace thermal denaturation.

'''Hot-start PCR''' is a form of PCR that focuses on the maximization of product yield. To reach this goal, chemical modifications are used to limit polymerase activity prior to the reaction. This limitation reduces non-specific polymerase amplification. Next, the reaction, itself, is performed at extremely high temperatures using polymerase obtained from thermophilic organisms, such as Achaea bacteria from ocean vents. These elevated temperatures further prevent non-specific polymerase amplification, resulting in a larger yield of the target product.

'''Intersequence-specific PCR''' a method for DNA fingerprinting. this amplify regions to produce a unique fingerprint of amplified fragments.

'''Inverse PCR''' is a method engineered to bypass the limitations of regular PCR, which requires prior knowledge of the flanking sequences around the target sequence. Inverse PCR is aptly named because it can be performed to determine the flanking sequences of a target strand. However, this method has its own limitation: one internal sequence must be known for it to be performed.

'''Ligation-mediated PCR''' is a method used for DNA sequencing, genome walking, DNA footprinting. This uses small DNA linkers ligated to desired DNA and multiple primers annealing to the linkers.

'''Methylation-specific PCR (MSP)''' detects methylation of CpG islands in genomic DNA. DNA is treated with sodium bisulfate and is recognized by PCR primers. Two PCRs are used to modify the DNA. One primer recognizes DNA with cytosines to amplify methylated DNA, and the other primer recognizes DNA with uracil/thymine to amplify unmethylated DNA.  

'''Miniprimer PCR''' allows PCR targeting to smaller primer (smalligos) (consists of 9-10 nucleotides) binding regions and  used to amplify conserved DNA sequences.

'''Multiplex PCR''' is a biochemical technique that focuses on simultaneous amplification of multiple target DNA products through the addition of multiple primers into a single PCR reaction. Multiplex PCR is a preferred method for DNA testing because it allows for the analysis of deletions, mutations, and polymorphisms in a sample.

'''Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA)''' amplifies multiple targets with only a single pair of primer.

'''Nested PCR''' is a form of PCR that maximizes accuracy in the amplification of a target DNA fragment. Nested PCR consists of two separate reactions. The first is a normal PCR reaction where a pair of primers is used to amplify a target fragment. The second reaction adds a second pair of primers called “nested primers” that bind to the products of the first reaction and amplify them. By performing two sets of PCR reactions, this method maximizes accuracy since it is very unlikely that two pairs of primers would both bind to the wrong target fragment. 

'''Overlap-extension PCR''' allows the construction of DNA sequence with an alteration inserted beyond the limit of the primer length.

'''PAN-AC''' uses isothermal conditions for amplification.

'''Quantitative PCR (Q-PCR)''' measures the quantity of a PCR product. It measures the starting amount of DNA, cDNA, and RNA. this is commonly used to determine if a dNA sequence is present and the number of its copies in the sample. This uses fluorescent dyes, for example TaqMan, to measure the amount of amplified product. 

'''Reverse Transcription PCR (RT-PCR)''' is a biochemical technique engineered to make good use of our knowledge of how reverse transcription can form complementary DNA from RNA. RT-PCR is performed in two major steps. In the first step, reverse transcription of a target RNA strand into its complementary DNA is performed using oligo-DT, which substitutes for the role of primers. In the second step, a regular PCR reaction is performed by adding primers specific to the DNA to help amplify the target sequence. RT-PCR is a highly sensitive technique that takes advantage of the smaller size of RNA strands (when compared to their DNA counterparts). RT-PCR is a highly applicable technique. In addition to the aforementioned material, this technique can be used for the mass production of target RNA through the synthesis of complementary DNA, which can be subsequently cloned through a vector.

'''Touchdown PCR''' is a PCR technique that focuses on maximizing target product yield. In such a way, it can considered an alternative to the Hot-start PCR method. To achieve its goal, this method performs PCR reactions at high annealing temperatures, which reduces non-specific polymerase amplification. In other words, only the fragments containing the sequences of interest will be amplified by the primers. As the fragments are amplified over and over again, the temperature is gradually lowered until it is certain that only target fragments have remained.

'''Universal Fast Walking''' is used for genome walking and genetic fingerprinting. This is a more specific two sided PCR than the normal one sided PCR approach.

'''Variable Number of Tandem Repeats (VNTR) PCR''' target areas of the genome that exhibit length variation. The analysis of the genotypes involves sizing of the amplification products by gel electrophoresis. Analyzing smaller VNTR segments (short Tandem Repeats, STRs) is the base for DNA Fingerprinting.

== DNA Polymerases ==

'''Klenow fragment''' is originally derived from the DNA Polymerase I from E. coli (first enzyme to be used in PCR). This polymerase needs to be replenished every cycle due to its lack of stability at high temperature. This is not commonly used in PCR.

'''Bacteriophage T4 DNA polymerase''' was initially used in PCR but is also destroyed by heat and has a higher fidelity replication than the Klenow fragment.

'''Thermus aquaticus (Taq)''' is commonly used and is the first thermostable (heat-stable) polymerase used in PCR. This enzyme is isolated from a native source or from its cloned gene expressed in E. coli.

'''Stoffel fragment''' is made of a truncated gene for Taq polymerase and expressed in E. coli. This enzyme lacks a 5’-3’ exonuclease activity and is able to amplify targets longer than its native enzyme.

'''Faststart polymerase''' is a variant of Taq polymerase that requires a strong heat activation. This should be avoid from non-specific amplification because of its low temperature polymerase activity.

'''Pfu DNA polymerase''' is isolated from an archean Pyrococcus furiosus. This has a proofreading activity. Since errors increase as PCR progresses, Pfu is preferred when the products are individually cloned for sequencing or expression.

'''Vent polymerase''' is extremely thermostable and is isolated from Thermococcus litoralis.

'''Tth polymerase''' is a thermostable polymerase from Thermus thermophilus. This polymerase has a reverse transcriptase activity when in presence of Mn2+ ion that allows PCR amplification from RNA targets.

== Review ==
* Each verb in Welsh has a stem. Adding an ending to this stem changes the tense of the verb.
* Usually, the stem of a verb is everything minus the last vowel. However, there are exceptions to this rule. Learn the exceptions one-by-one as you come across them. 
* Remember, any object after a short form verb takes a soft mutation.

I come here to see new commands, but unfortunately with all the examples few of them specify what environment you need to be in or what packages you need installed.  I find that none of these new commands I learned here today are usable for me since I dont know how to call their packages.  Why do sites and pages such as these always fail to point out the most fundamental and the most necessary points?  You dont tell a ten year old how to bake bread and leave out the fact that the ingredients call for flour. Why do (so-called) &quot;educational&quot; sites and pages always treat you like you already know what youre doing?

I find this wikibook useful but since yesterday something happened to make this site much less useful! Could you pleae return it to where it was yesterday?

(different person here)
There used to be a very good discussion of the various equation numbering options equation, flalign, flalign* etc, with examples around here ... somewhere. I found that extremely useful. It seems to
have vanished. Has it been moved somewhere?  &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:131.172.99.15|131.172.99.15]] ([[User talk:131.172.99.15|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/131.172.99.15|contribs]]) 00:25, 26 October 2009.&lt;/small&gt;

:The old version of the page you are referring to is [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=LaTeX/Mathematics&amp;oldid=1324479#Showing_formulas here]. I tried to make it more succinct, as I thought it was needlessly complicated (also it uses &lt;code&gt;flalign&lt;/code&gt; instead of the more common &lt;code&gt;align&lt;/code&gt; environment). In your opinion, is there anything from the old page you think would be valuable (I noticed the &lt;code&gt;subequation&lt;/code&gt; environment is no longer mentioned)? Would it be worth creating an article focused on equation numbering?–[[User:3mta3|3mta3]] ([[User talk:3mta3|talk]]) 13:55, 26 October 2009 (UTC)

== Incorrect syntax - fix me please! ==

copy-pasting the code does NOT work and results in a parse error; one has to edit the page and grab the &quot;real code&quot; (which is not the same as the displayed code)

&lt;math&gt;

\left.\begin{align}
        B'&amp;=-\partial \times E,\\
        E'&amp;=\partial \times B - 4\pi j,
\end{align}\right\}\quad\text{Maxwell}'\text{s equations}\qquad\mathrm{(1.1)}
&lt;/math&gt;


:The displayed code text fine for me.  Here is the whole syntax of my latex document:

&lt;source lang=latex&gt;
\documentclass{amsart}

\begin{document}
\begin{equation}
 \left.\begin{aligned}
        B'&amp;=-\partial \times E,\\
        E'&amp;=\partial \times B - 4\pi j,
       \end{aligned}
 \right\}
 \qquad \text{Maxwell's equations}
\end{equation}
\end{document}
&lt;/source&gt;

:The difficulty with grabbing the using the &quot;real code&quot; is that the implementation in wikibooks of latex does not automatically number anything, so that code always produces a label of (1.1), it is hard coded in there.  If I recall correctly align, aligned, etc. are AMS routines, so if you have a document class of something like &quot;article&quot; or &quot;book&quot; then you need to use the correct package.  If you don't load the correct package you'll get a parser error.  My example above uses &quot;amsart&quot; so all the necessary AMS packages get loaded. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub]][[Special:Contributions/Thenub314|314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 19:28, 21 October 2010 (UTC)

(different person) For accuracy: Can we put vector arrows on Maxwell's equations? The equations don't make physical or mathematical sense without them.

== Align vs. Split ==

Many of the uses of the &lt;tt&gt;align&lt;/tt&gt; environment documented on this page (namely, a single equation split over multiple lines) should use the &lt;tt&gt;split&lt;/tt&gt; (or &lt;tt&gt;split*&lt;/tt&gt; if appropriate) environment instead, which is also provided by the &lt;tt&gt;amsmath&lt;/tt&gt; package.  The &lt;tt&gt;split&lt;/tt&gt; environment is designed for a single equation that must be split over multiple lines; its syntax is identical to that of align, except that it assigns a single number to the entire equation (so there is no need for &lt;tt&gt;\nonumber&lt;/tt&gt; and the number is aligned vertically).  According to the &lt;tt&gt;amsmath&lt;/tt&gt; documentation, &lt;tt&gt;align&lt;/tt&gt; (and &lt;tt&gt;align*&lt;/tt&gt;) are meant for arranging &lt;em&gt;multiple&lt;/em&gt; different equations, not one.&amp;mdash;[[User:Kbolino|Kbolino]] ([[User talk:Kbolino|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kbolino|contribs]]) 08:09, 22 April 2011 (UTC)

== spacing around signs of relation ==

in some of the examples, in particular those which create &quot;compound&quot; signs of relation with {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\stackrel}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\overset}} (in the section on &quot;vertically aligning displayed mathematics&quot;), the spacing is too tight.  compare the space around an &quot;unadorned&quot; equals sign.  this can be fixed by declaring the compound to be {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\mathrel}} but that's not entirely trivial, and would require explanation so that it's not confusing to a novice.  as i'm not at all well versed in updating wiki code, i hesitate to try to make any revisions, but hope that someone with the requisite knowledge will do so.

== How to number with the same number an equation that occurs twice in a document? ==

Hello everybody,

I had the problem described in the title of this topic and I would find great if s.o. can add a solution to solve this problem. I found a solution here: http://compgroups.net/comp.text.tex/how-to-reuse-the-equation-number/268199

Thanks in advance.

== Overlapping under/over braces ==

I was thinking this article should mention a way to do overlapping under/over braces. Here are a couple of examples. Albeit they are ugly examples:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\[
0+\lefteqn{\overbrace{\phantom{1+2+3}}}1+\underbrace{2+3+\overbrace{x+y+z}+
\lefteqn{\overbrace{\phantom{4+5}}}4}+5
\]

\[
\underbrace{a + \lefteqn{\underbrace{\phantom{b+c+d}}_{\textrm{blah}}}b}_{\textrm{blarg}} +
c + d = e
\]

\[
\lefteqn{\underbrace{ \phantom{a + b}}_{\textrm{blarg}}}a+
\underbrace{\lefteqn{\phantom{\underbrace{b}_{\textrm{blarg}}}}b+c+d}_{blah}=e
\]
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

I am not sure if there is a way to make zero-space expressions work on wikis. \lefteqn{} works with the appropriate package (I think amsmath). 

Does anyone know if there are any packages to make this easier? It would be great if there were a way to say something like:

\start{underbrace{depth=1}} a + \start{underbrace{depth=2}} b \end{underbrace{depth=1}} + c + d \end{underbrace{depth=2}}


== Adding AMSLaTeX commands ==
I tried to add a new example to the section about environments like \align, \gather etc. It was
&lt;source lang=latex&gt;
\begin{gather*}
a_0=\frac{1}{\pi}\int\limits_{-\pi}^{\pi}f(x)\,\mathrm{d}x\\[6pt]
\begin{split}
a_n=\frac{1}{\pi}\int\limits_{-\pi}^{\pi}f(x)\cos nx\,\mathrm{d}x=\\
=\frac{1}{\pi}\int\limits_{-\pi}^{\pi}x^2\cos nx\,\mathrm{d}x
\end{split}\\[6pt]
\begin{split}
b_n=\frac{1}{\pi}\int\limits_{-\pi}^{\pi}f(x)\sin nx\,\mathrm{d}x=\\
=\frac{1}{\pi}\int\limits_{-\pi}^{\pi}x^2\sin nx\,\mathrm{d}x
\end{split}\\[6pt]
\end{gather*}
&lt;/source&gt;
It was impossible to render it. It tried many changes to the source, but I gave up. Any idea about the problem? My guess is that gather requires amsmath, which might be the problem. Anyway, I would be happy if somebody added this example, because I find the combination of gather and split pretty useful.
:This wouldn't be the first time an image has had to be uploaded to use as an example.  You can upload it to wikimedia commons and insert it into the text quite easily.  I have it rendering in my installation without explicitly saying \usepackage{amsmath} but I suspect one of the other packages in the test file I used calls it.  It would be best for you to upload it - you know what it's meant to look like!

:::I've inserted it (I actually rerendered it for - slightly - higher resolution and being honest in the creation info on commons).

== \underbracket and \overbracket aren't a part of the amsmath package ==

The \underbracket and \overbracket macros aren't a part of the amsmath package. Which package do I have to Include. I've tried &lt;code lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;\usepackage{underbracket}&lt;/code&gt; but that works only for underbracket and only without a text underneath it.
A dirty workaround for putting text underneath the underbracket is to use this method:
 &lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;\mathop{\underbracket{a + b}}\limits_{\text{a text}}&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
I think that somebody should mention, which package you have to include.

== The Plan ==
To created a tutorial and reference text book on how to create SSG files for SpoilerAL.

Pre-requisits: knowledge of Hex arithmetic/addressing (does a book exist already?), how to ''use'' SpoilerAL (separate book), and how to discover memory addresses for editing (separate book)

Categories:
* Computing
* Domain-specific languages

== Introduction ==
SpoilerAL is a freeware general purpose memory editor for the [[wikipedia:Microsoft Windows|Microsoft Windows]] platform.  &quot;Trainers&quot; for various computer games are often distributed as script files with .ssg (''Spoiler Scripts Goup'') extension that the SpoilerAL program loads and executes.  This book provides coverage on how to create (or edit) SSG files.

Readers of this book should already be familiar with the concepts of hexadecimal arithmetic and addressing.  Readers should also need to know how to locate memory addresses desired for editing (either via SpoilerAL or other tools) and as well as how to use SSG files with SpoilerAL.  A brief treatise of each of these topics is available through the appendix.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Animal cell NIH.jpg‎|thumb|Pictorial representation of organelles in a typical animal cell]]
[[File:Nucleus Nucleolus and chromatin of animal cell.png|thumb|Cell]]

Structural biochemistry plays a vital role in the functions of an organism's cell through various means, one of them being the organelles in a cell. It is through the structure and functions of living molecules (and some non-living), such as [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid|nucleic acids]], [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Amino Acids|amino acids]], [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid/Nitrogenous Bases/Purines|purine]], and [[Structural Biochemistry/Lipids|lipids]] that life is even possible. 

Some properties of living organisms include high degree of chemical complexity and microscopic organization, systems to extract, transform and use energy from the environment, self-replication and self-assembly, sensing and responding to changes in the environment, define functions for each component and regulation among them, and history of evolutionary change.

Organelles are the components of the cell that synthesize new materials, recycle old materials, transport molecules, and anything else that is essential to ensure the proper survival of the cell and its propagation. Organelles incorporate all broad ranges of organic molecules including nucleic acids, amino acids, carbohydrates, and lipids to produce a viable cell. 

As discussed before, the [[Structural Biochemistry/Lipids/Lipid Bilayer|&quot;lipid bilayer&quot;]] that forms the cell membrane contains membrane [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins|protein]] and [[Structural Biochemistry/Lipids/Cholesterol|cholesterol]]. The membrane protein plays a vital role in the membrane functions while the cholesterol performs the structural role within the membrane. 

There are two types of protein membranes:
*Integral membrane protein: lies within the membrane
*Peripheral membrane protein: bound to membrane
The cell membrane is often referred to as a mosaic. Proteins in the membrane determine most of the membranes specific function. These proteins are categorized as integral and peripheral proteins. Integral proteins can perform a number of functions such as being transport proteins that provide a hydrophilic channel across the membrane. Integral proteins can also act a receptor sites for chemical messengers like hormones. [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme|Enzymes]] can also be found in the lipid bilayer with its active site exposed to substances in adjacent solutions. Elements of the cytoskeleton may also be bonded to the membrane proteins; a function that helps maintain cell structure.
The structure of these membrane protein can also be either alpha helices or beta sheets. Due to the [[Structural Biochemistry/Chemical Bonding/Hydrophobic interaction|hydrophobic interactions]], the hydrophobic residues of the alpha helices will not exposed to the aqueous environment. The beta sheet forms a hollow cylindrical configuration where the inside is hydrophilic. The cylindrical structure is driven by the unsatisfied [[Structural Biochemistry/Chemical Bonding/Hydrogen bonds|hydrogen bonding]] at the ends of the beta sheet. Wrapping around itself, the beta sheet is able to satisfy all hydrogen bonding. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The major functions performed by proteins of the plasma membrane are:

# 	'''Transport''': Some membrane proteins provide selective hydrophilic channels for exchange of substances.   
# 	'''Enzymatic activity''': Membrane proteins may also be enzymes with their active sites exposed to the surrounding solutions.   
# 	'''Signal transduction''': Membrane proteins may act as receptors with specific binding sites that allows perfect fit with chemical messengers, which can cause the protein to change shape and allow it to relay the message to the inside of the cell.   
# 	'''Cell-cell recognition:''' Some glycoproteins allow specific identification by membrane protein of other cells.   
# 	'''Intercellular joining''': Membrane proteins of adjacent cells may join together in different junctions.   
# 	'''Attachment to the cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix (ECM)''': Membrane proteins can be non-covalently bound with elements of the cytoskeleton in order to maintain cell shape and stabilize the location of certain membrane proteins.


Cholesterol regulates the fluidity of the membrane in eukaryotic cells. The ability to incorporate cholesterol into the cell membrane with hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions allows the cholesterol to disrupt the phospholipid interaction within the bi-layer. Since prokaryotic cells do not have cholesterol to regulate fluidity, these cells depend on the variation in the saturation level and length of the fatty acid chain. The shorter and more saturated the chain the more rigid the membrane will become (due to the fact that the longer and saturated chains can interact more closely with one another)

=====Fluid Mosaic Model=====
This claims that the lipid layer has an important role in cell membrane. The cell membrane serves as the solvent for the integral membrane proteins, and it also serves as a barrier that separates the cellular activities within the cell from the extracellular space. The permeable barrier regulates what enters the cell. This Fluid Mosaic Model is regulated by the concentration of cholesterol and fatty acid chain mentioned above.

====The Properties of Membrane====
*Sheet-like structure
*Formed by lipid bilayers and proteins
*The different ratio of lipids to proteins will correspond to the different cell types and organelles which gives it the      amphiphatic properties
*Non-covalent assemblies include van deer Waals, hydrogen bonding, and hydrophobic interactions
*Asymmetric
*The orientation of the proteins are fixed and will not interchange between the inner or outer layers
*Fluid Structures
*Electrically polarized because of the charged head groups

==Major Organelles==
====1. Ribosome====
[[Structural Biochemistry/Cell Organelles/Ribosome|Ribosomes]] are the sites by which 
[[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid|nucleic acids]] are translated and [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins|proteins]] are synthesized. Ribosomes are about 20&amp;nbsp;nm in diameter and are composed of ribosomal RNA and proteins. They can be found freely floating in the cytosol and not attached to any organelles in prokaryote cells. In eukaryote, ribosomes may be found on the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The rough [[Structural Biochemistry/Cell Organelles/Endoplasmic Reticulum|ER]] earns its name because of ribosomes on its surface, giving a studding appearance. The proteins produced by the ribosomes of the rough ER are sent through the lumen of the ER, where they are modified. The protein is then transported in a vesicle to the [[Structural Biochemistry/Cell Organelles/Golgi Apparatus|Golgi Apparatus]], where the protein undergoes further modification.

First, the genetic code from DNA is transcribed into a complementary strand called messenger RNA (mRNA) ([[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid/RNA/Messenger RNA (mRNA)|mRNA]]) by [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid/DNA/Replication Process/DNA Polymerase|DNA polymerase]]. In prokaryotes, the mRNA moves away from the nucleoid and is bounded to free-floating ribosomes in the cytosol. However, in eukaryotes, mRNA is made in the nucleus and transported across the nuclear membrane and into the cytoplasm. This is called translocation. In the next step, known as translation, the mRNA is attached to the ribosome, and codons on the mRNA are matched with the complementary nucleotide bases (anticodons) located on a transfer RNA ([[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid/RNA/Transfer RNA (tRNA)|tRNA]]) molecule. The enzyme aminoacyl tRNA synthetase matches the tRNA codons with the appropriate amino acids through a series of esterification reactions. Ribosomal RNA synthesizes the protein through use of RNA polymerase. This elongates the protein until a stop codon terminates the protein synthesis chain. The synthesis of proteins always moves in the direction of the N-terminus to the C-terminus. DNA replication is also go from the 5' to 3' direction. 

====2. Cell Membrane====
The cell[[Structural Biochemistry/Lipids/Biological Membranes|membrane]], as explained above, is a selectively permeable barrier of ions and molecules that move into and out of the cell. In other words, not all molecules are able to pass through the cell membrane. During the division of the cell, none of the membrane integrity is lost. As the cell grows, new lipid and protein molecules are placed into the cell’s plasma membrane.

==Prokaryotes Organelles==
Prokaryotes typically have no compartmentalized organelles. The cell's DNA and ribosomes are free-floating with the cytosol, which is surrounded by a cell membrane. A prokaryotic cell is generally one hundred times smaller than a eukaryotic cell.

====1. Nucleoid====
In the nucleoid, the chromosomal DNA is wrapped around binding proteins. &quot;Replication by DNA polymerase and transcription by RNA polymerase occur at the same time within the nucleoid.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Microbiology&lt;/ref&gt;

====2. Pili====
Pili (Fimbriae)is a thin structure that stick out from the surface. They are made out of a single protein called pilin. Pili's functions include DNA transfer, binding to surfaces, and motility. Pili has the ability to attach to a substrate. One type of pili called sex pili, it attaches a &quot;male&quot; donor cell to a &quot;female&quot; recipient cell for transfer of DNA. This process is called conjugation.

==Eukaryotes Organelles==
Eukaryotes include animals, plants, fungi, and protists. They are typically more complex than prokaryotic cells. There are many compartmentalized organelles enclosed in membranes within the cell which allow for various reactions to take place. The eukaryotic cell is typically much larger than the prokaryotic cell, usually by a factor of around 100. Each organelle in Eukaryotes has their own function in the cell. 

====1. Nucleus====
The nucleus is one of the primary organelles that distinguish eukaryotic cells from prokaryotic cells. It is an organelle that enclosed compartment with a specific function. It contains chromatin. Nuclei contains nucleolus (where ribosome assembly is). Ribosomal [[/RNA/]] get together with ribosomal proteins to form the ribosomal subunits. The nucleus contains DNA that house the genes coding for the synthesis of proteins, antibodies and molecules that perform the basic functions of the cell. The nuclear membrane contains nuclear pore conplexes that allow for transport of material into and out of membrane. They also export mRNAs out of the nucleus. &lt;ref&gt;Microbiology&lt;/ref&gt;

====2. Endoplasmic Reticulum====
There are two types of endoplasmic reticulum: smooth ER and rough ER. The smooth ER is the site of lipid synthesis and some detoxification of noxious compounds. The rough ER is the site where transmembrane proteins or secreted proteins are translocated. Ribosomes are located in the rough ER instead of smooth ER because the protein has a hydrophobic signal sequence on its amino terminus. Endoplasmic Reticulum is where proteins can be modified too. 

====3. Mitochondrion====
Mitochondria involved in cellular energy production. It has a function in perfoming oxidative respiration and are found in nearly all eukaryotes. Mitochondria also produces ATP by oxidative respiration. It also has an outer and an inner membrane. Both DNA and ribosomes of mitochondria show similarities with DNA and ribosomes of bacteria. 

====4. Golgi Apparatus====
Proteins that are not part of ER now move to the Golgi. Golgi complex has membrane stacks (cisternae) that each contain unique enzymes. Carbohydrates may be modified as proteins pass through the cisternae. Vesciles leaving the Golgi complex may fuse with the cell membrane. 

====5. Centriole====
Centrioles are involved in a process called nuclear division. They are small, self-replicating, and are located in the cytoplasm near the nucleus.
organelles present near nucleus of animal cells.

====6. Cell Wall====
The cell wall, located outside the cell membrane, is a tough layer that provides the rest of the cell with structure support and protection. Cell walls are present in plants, fungi, algae, some archaea, and bacteria cells, but not in animal cells. The cell wall confers the shape and rigidity to bacterial cell and helps it withstand the intracellular turgor pressure that can build up as a result of osmotic pressure. 

====7. Chloroplasts====
Chloroplasts are only found in photosynthetic eukaryotes. They convert light energy from Sun to ATP and also reduced NADPH. Ancient cyanobacteria gave rise to chloroplasts. In other words, cyanobacteria are the ancestor of chloroplasts. Chloroplasts have an outer membrane, an inner membrane, and the thylakoid membrane. Some algal chloroplasts have more membranes outside these. Chloroplasts are typically found within the mesophyll cells, or the inner tissues of a leaf. Chloroplasts are discs that are typically somewhere between 2-7 micrometers in diameter and 1 micrometer thick. Chlorophylls ''a'' and ''b'', which are the green pigments located within plant chloroplasts, give plants their typical green color. During photosynthesis, carbon dioxide enters the leaf through microscopic pores known as the stomata, and oxygen leaves as a byproduct through the stomata. The dense fluid found within the chloroplast is known as the stroma, and amongst this are several interconnected membranous sacs shaped in flat discs with their own compartments, known as the thylakoids. In plants, thylakoids are arranged in a stacked conformation known as grana. Most other photosynthetic organisms and some C{{sub|4}} plant chloroplasts have unstacked thylakoids. The space within these compartments are called the thylakoid space. The membranes of the thylakoids hold the cell's chlorophyll.

====8. Vacuole====
Vacuoles serve as the cell's storage centers of food and other necessary materials. The vacuole further functions in the removal of unwanted structural materials, the containing of several waste products and small molecules (which could involve the isolation of potentially harmful products in the cell), the exportation of unwanted materials from the cell, and the maintenance of an acidic internal pH and constant internal pressure. In plants, the central vacuole is typically the largest compartment of all the cell's organelles, occupying in itself the majority of the cell volume. This large compartment is enclosed by a membrane called the tonoplast, which is selectively permeable to certain solutes within the cytosol. The solution inside the vacuole is referred to as cell sap, which is of different composition from the cytosol. Some plant vacuoles contain pigments that color the cells, such as during pollination season by which the plant must attract different organisms to carry out its fertilization. Plants maintain its structure through the maintenance of internal pressure through the manipulation of water into and out of the vacuole. Through water osmosis, water diffuses into the vacuole, which places pressure onto the cell wall. If too much water were to be lost, this pressure against the cell wall would be lacking, and the cell would collapse onto itself. Thus, cells also serve to maintain the cell's size. Another important feature of the vacuole in plants is that an enlarged central vacuole may add a specific amount of pressure against the other compartments in the cell and push them towards the cell membrane, thereby giving a type of conformation that permits the absorbance of more solar energy. 

====9. Lysosome====
Lysosomes are membrane enclosed organelles that help eukaryotic cells obtain nourishment from macromolecular nutrients. They contain hydrolytic enzymes. Lysosomal and phagocytosis digestion help the eukaryotic cell because they increase the membrane surface area. In eukaryotes, lysosomes allow intracellular digestion crosses the lysosomal membrane into cytoplasm. 


====10. Peroxisome====
Peroxisomes are the centers by which the cell may be rid of potential toxins. The peroxisomes are in itself a receptacle of oxidative enzymes that remove hydrogen atoms from certain organic substances to produce peroxides, which in itself is harmful. This peroxide serves to oxidate the potentially harmful substances, such as alcohol.

== Cell Compartment ==
=== 1. Evolution ===
During evolution, cells start to develop into two compartments: the outer and inner aqueous compartment. The advantage of having an inner aqueous compartment allows the better segregation of cellular organelles from the external environment. Thus, each organelle is able to develop and refine its structural and functional distinction inside this aqueous compartment throughout the course of evolution. The [[Structural Biochemistry/Lipids/Lipid Bilayer|&quot;lipid bilayer&quot;]] (further discussed) existed as a protective wall that allows hydrophilic interaction in the external and internal compartment of the cells while maintain proficient rigidity with its hydrophobic interior structure. The inner aqueous compartment ultimately becomes the cytoplasm which serves the same purpose as it has been during evolution.  

====2. Liposomes====
Liposomes are essentially lipid vesicles that are surrounded by a circular phospholipid [[Structural Biochemistry/Lipids/Lipid Bilayer|bilayer]]. They form identical structure as other phospholipids vesicles: interior hydrophobic tails away from the aqueous solution, and external hydrophilic heads towards the aqueous solution. Liposomes are formed through the process called sonification that results in ions and solutes inside the enclosed compartments. They can be used to study the permeability of certain membranes and transportation of ions or solutes found in different cells. 

====3. Lipid Bilayer====
Lipid bilayers form in a spontaneous and self-assembled manner in aqueous environment. Its unique properties allow the formation of enclosed compartments. The sheet-like bimolecular structure called lipid bilayers or energetically favored because of the [[Structural Biochemistry/Chemical Bonding/Hydrophobic interaction|hydrophobic interactions]]. As mentioned previously, phospholipids, an amphiphlic moiety as a major class of membrane lipids, exist in an aqueous solution. The hydrophobic tails from two phospholipid bilayers interact with each other to form a hydrophobic center. Meanwhile, the hydrophilic heads line up with each other, form a hydrophilic coating on each side of the bilayer, and isolate the inner compartment from the outer environment. 

===Membrane Movement===
==== A. Lateral Diffusion ====
The lateral diffusion, or the motion of moving laterally, of the biological membranes illustrates the fact that the membranes are not rigid and static. In fact, the membrane is not stable. There is a technique known as ''Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching'' (FRAP)assists to visualize the lateral diffusion of membrane proteins. An example of the experiment is as follow:
1) Label a specific cell component with fluorescence.
2) Use a intense beam of laser light to bleach, or destroy, the small part of the florescence labeled cell surface.
3) The intensity of bleaching recovers as the lateral diffusion of unbleached membrane proteins move into the region that has been bleached.

==== B. Transverse Diffusion ====
Transverse Diffusion describes the movement of molecules from one side the membrane to the opposite side. In comparison to the rapid movement of lateral diffusion, the speed of transverse diffusion is rather slow. The reason for the preservation of membrane structural asymmetry is due to the greater energy barriers formed in order to travel across membrane from one side to the other.

== The Cycling Process of Cells==
                                                                                                                                 
===1. Cells Division===
Cell division is a process that a cell gets divided and then duplicated. In prokaryotes, cells are divided by binary fission. In eukaryotes, the process becomes more complicated that there are three steps or periods for division. The cell grows during the period of inter-phase, when it absorbs nutrients for mitosis and duplication of DNA. Then the cells comes to mitosis phase. During this mitosis, the cell splits into two different daughter cells. Moreover, the chromosomes in its nucleus will also be divided into two equivalent parts, each into separate nuclei. Finally, the cell finishes division during cytokinesis.

===2. Cells Aging===
Aging is due to continuous damage to various molecules in our cells, including proteins, lipids and nucleic acids. There are internal and external reasons for the damage to happen. The example for external reasons is oxygen, which is regarded as the necessity for human beings. However, when the oxygen absorbs only one or two electrons, making itself reactive, this kind of oxygen molecules will damage lipids, mutate genes, and destroy proteins, all leading to cellular injury.
On the other hand, the internal reasons are related to cell retiring. According to the data, cells stop working when they divide about fifty times. This phenomenon might be traced to the period when a cell copies its chromosomes to its daughters. However, the very ends of the chromosomes will not be copied, so daughters’ chromosomes are shorter, compared to their maternal cell. Telomere, at the ends of cells’ chromosomes, supplies the genetic information, which is the same as that on the parts of maternal chromosomes left. Nonetheless, when a cell’s telomeres get shrunk to a minimum size, the cell will stop dividing and lose its function. The picture to the right shows the telomeres in 46 human chromosomes.                                         


===3. Cells Death===
There are two kinds of cell death: apoptosis and necrosis. 
Apoptosis is programmed cell death that cells that undergoes self-destruction by regulation. At first, a cell shrinks and escapes from its neighbors. Later on, the surface of the cell breaks into fragments and also the nucleus then collapses. In the end, the whole cell dissembles. There will be some organelles cleaning up the remains. During apoptosis, unneeded cells or retired cells are eliminated efficiently without pain. Apoptosis plays a significant role in our body, which is self-destruction. When some cells in our body become infected, apoptosis can help eliminate them to avoid the virus spreading the whole body. However, viruses have several solutions to prevent apoptosis, such as stop cells’ suicide by confusing them with a similar “off” signal as that sent by apoptosis. Therefore, further research in apoptosis can promote the development of clinical medicine. 
On the other hand, Necrosis is unplanned cell death. It happens when the outer membrane of a cell is unable to control the liquid flowing across it. The cell is then shrink and burst. Finally, contents inside will flow out, blending into the tissues nearby. The reasons causing necrosis might be traumatic injury, infection, chemical poison, etc.

===4. Balance in cells===
Now we understand that some cells are created and some are killed. The truth is that these processes are designed well to keep our body healthy. The unbalance between apoptosis and mitosis will cause cancer.

==Endocytosis==
Endocytosis is the creation of internal membranes from the cell's plasma membrane lipid bilayer. It is a way for plasma membrane lipids and integral proteins to be brought inside the cell. It is thus the opposite of exocytosis. This allows cells to do things like regulate the sensitivity of cells to ligands since receptors can be removed from the cell surface by endocytosis. 
Plasma membrane buds, called caveolae, are on little creices on the surface of many mammalian cells. These can make up almost a third of a cells surface area. Given their structure, they are often involved in endocytic events. 
Another way of internalizing in cells is called phagocytosis. In this method, material can be take in when 'invaginations' are formed around particles to be engulfed while using or not using the growth of surrounding membrane extensions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''ketose''' is a '''ketone''' with two or more hydroxyl groups (-OH), where at least one of the hydroxyl group at each end.  '''Ketoses''' are a type of [[Structural Biochemistry/Carbohydrates/Monosaccharides|'''monosaccharide''']], which are important fuel molecules and nucleic acid building blocks. The simplest example of a ketose is dihydroxyacetone. It is a three-carbon structure containing one keto group and two hydroxyl groups (shown below). If you look closely at the image below you will notice that the keto group is in a slightly different color. The formula for this structure is CO(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Ketoses also play important roles in the Calvin cycle, transaldolase reaction and transketolase reaction. Each of these processes are described in the following sections below.

[[Image:Dihydroxyacetone.png|right|thumb|300px|]]

The simplest  ketose is Dihydroxyacetone. The stereochemical relations between D-ketoses containing three-four, five, and six carbon atoms are shown below in the family tree of ketoses:[[File:Family tree of d-ketoses.svg|left|thumb|500px|D-ketoses containing three, four, five and six carbon atoms]]

[[File:CCF11302011 00000.jpg|thumb|300px||right| The Ketoses: ketotriose, ketotetroses, ketopentoses, and ketohexoses]]

== Furanose Formation ==
=== ''Hemiketal or Hemiacetal'' ===
A Hemiketal is formed when a ketone react with an alcohol. The ‘-OR’ in alcohol attacks the oxygen in ketone, thus breaking the ‘C-O’ double bond. And the ‘H’ in alcohol bonds to the O.
[[File:Hemiketal Formation.jpg|thumb|Hemiketal Formation]]

=== ''Furanose Ring'' ===
Fructose chain cyclize when the -OH on C5 attacks ketone on C2 to form intramolecular hemiketal. It can form both 5 membered furanose ring or 6 membered pyranose ring. the Furanose ring makes the envelope ring form, with either C2 or C3 out of the plane; these are called C-2-endo and C-3-endo.

== Ketoses in Reactions ==
===Transketolase Reaction===
The Transketolase reaction is very similar to the Transaldolase reaction. However, the Transketolase is different because it transfers a two carbon unit instead of Transaldolase's three carbon unit. Thiamine pyrophospate (TPP) ionizes so that it has a carbanion which is a negatively charged carbon. The importance of carbanion is that they can attack carbonyls, so that carbons are added in a sense to the nucleophile. TPP attacks a ketose substrate where it than releases the aldose product to yield an activated glycoaldehyde unit. An activated glycoaldehyde unit is an electron sink because of a positively charged nitrogen atom where a carbonyl of an aldose product is attacked and then separated after some electron movement. The importance of the transketolase reaction is that it is the mechanism that the enzyme TPP uses to change a ketose substrate to a ketose product that has a different group attached to it. 

=== Transaldolase Reaction ===
The transaldolase reaction involves the transfer or a three carbon dihydroxyacetone unit from a ketose donor to an aldose acceptor.  Unlike the transketolase reaction, transaldolase does not contain a prosthetic group; instead the reactions begins with a Schiff base formed between the carbonyl group of the ketose substrate and the amino group of a lysine residue at the active site of the enzyme.  Next the Schiff base is protonated and the bond between C-3 and C-4 break which releases the aldose product.  The leftover negative charge on the Schiff-base carbanion is stabilized by resonance while the positive charge on the nitrogen atom of the protonated Schiff base acts as the electron sink.  The Schiff-base remains stable until a suitable aldose becomes bound which allows the dihydroxyacetone to react with the carbonyl group of the aldose and the ketose product is released from the lysine side chain via hydrolysis of the Schiff-base.       

Transaldolase is a target of autoimmunity in patients with multiple sclerosis which is the selective destruction of oligodendrocytes that selectively expresses transaldolase in the brain.

=== Ketose in the Calvin Cycle ===
The '''Calvin cycle''', or dark reactions, is one of the light-independent reactions. In the third phase of the this reaction, a five-carbon sugar is constructed from six-carbon and three-carbon sugars. A transketolase and an aldolase are the major factors in the rearrangement. The transketolase, which is in the pentose phosphate pathway, requires a coenzyme, thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), to transfer a two-carbon unit from a ketose to an aldose. Whereas the transaldolase transfers a three-carbon unit from a ketose to an aldose. 

In summary, transketolase first converts a six-carbon sugar and a three-carbon sugar into a four-carbon sugar and a five-carbon sugar. Then, aldolase combines the four-carbon product and a three-carbon sugar to form the seven-carbon sugar.  This seven-carbon sugar then finally reacts with another three-carbon sugar to form two additional five-carbon sugars.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Nucleus==

Eukaryotes derive their name from the fact that they contain a nucleus. The nuclus is also often the most prominent feature of eukaryotic cells viewed under a microscope. The nucleus is an organelle, an intracellular membrane-enclosed compartment with a specific function. The nucleus also contains chromatin. Chomatin is a complex of DNA and proteins. The nuclear membrane consists two concentric phospholipid membranes. Nuclei contains a region called the nucleolus, where ribosome assembly begins. Besides, the nuclear membrane contains nuclear pore complexes that allow for transport of material into and out of the nucleus. The metabolites and small proteins can diffuse through the NCPs. Large proteins that need to enter the nucleus are actively transported in through the NPCs. 

The nucleus is a membrane-enclosed organelle found in eukaryotic cells. It contains the genetic material of the cell, organized as multiple long linear DNA molecules that coil around to form chromosomes. The transcription of RNA also takes place in the nucleus.

[[Image:nucleus.png|thumb|Illustration of a human cell nucleus]]
[[File:Nucleus Nucleolus and chromatin of animal cell.png|thumb|Cell]]

==Function==
The eukaryotic nucleus contains the genetic information of the cell, and insulates it from the cytosol. It is in the nucleus where the nucleolus is contained; the site of [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid/RNA|RNA]] synthesis and [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid/DNA|DNA]] replication. During the interphase stage of the cell cycle, the genetic material is found in the form of chromatin. It is during during mitosis and meiosis that the chromatin coil together, using histone proteins, to form tightly packed sister chromatids which then replicate, forming daughter cells.

==Structure==
[[Image:Nucleus&amp;Nucleolus.gif|thumb|Slide of a nucleus and nucleolus (dark spot)]]
The nucleus is known as the information storage organelle. it is enclosed by a double membrane- &quot;nuclear envelope&quot;.  Inside of the nucleus there is DNA.  The DNA is bound by proteins- &quot;chromatin&quot;.  The dark spot of the nucleus is the nucleolus- site or rRNA synthesis.  The nucleus has its own internal skeleton known as the nuclear lamina.  It also has its own transport system called nuclear pores.
===Nuclear Envelope===
The Nuclear Envelope is a double layered [[Structural Biochemistry/Lipids/Biological Membranes|membrane]] that surrounds the nucleus.  It consist of nuclear pores that regulate the transportation of substances such as RNA into and out of the nucleus.  The nuclear envelope consists of an outer nuclear membrane and an inner membrane.  Both nuclear membranes are [[Structural Biochemistry/Lipids/Lipid Bilayer|&quot;lipid bilayers&quot;]].  The outer nuclear membrane is extensive and is connected to the rough endoplasmic reticulum or [[Structural Biochemistry/Cell Organelles/Endoplasmic Reticulum|ER]].  The inner nuclear membrane is continuous with the nuclear lamina consisting of various lamins. The lamina is an attachment site for the chromosomes that also stabilize the structure of the nucleus. The inner nuclear membrane contains different kinds of membrane [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins|proteins]].  The inner and outer nuclear membranes are connected through nuclear pores.
There are some bound 
[[Structural Biochemistry/Cell Organelles/Ribosome|ribosomes]]
attaching to the outside of the nuclear envelope. These bound ribosomes function on inserting protein into and secreting protein out of the membrane.

==Components in a nucleus==
The cell nucleus is an important organelle because it is where genes and their controlling factors are formed. In order to do so, it needs the helps of the stored components:

# '''Chromosomes''': store and organize genes that allow cell division.
# '''Nuclear pores''': transport regulatory factos and gene products. http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Pore_on_nuclear_envelope.JPG
# '''Messenger ribonucleic acid ([[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid/RNA/Messenger RNA (mRNA)|mRNA]])''': produce messages that code for proteins.
# &lt;b&gt;Nucleolus&lt;b&gt;: produce ribosomes that functioning in the expression of gene code into proteins.

[[Image:Mito NIH.gif|thumb|Mitochondria seen through an electron microscope]]
The purpose of the mitochondria in the eukaryote is to provide cellular respiration to the cell. The endosymbiotic theory asserts that the mitochondria came to be part of the eukaryote over time through a symbiotic relationship.  The mitochondria consists of two membranes, the inner membrane and the outer membrane. It is speculated that the outer membrane came about when its ancestor was engulfed by the host celled via endocytosis, giving it a membrane in addition to the one the mitochondria ancestor already had.  This [[Structural Biochemistry/Cell Organelles/Mitochondria/Endosymbiont Theory|endosymbiont theory]] would also explain why the mitochondria had its own DNA and why this [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid/DNA|DNA]] is circular. For some amino acids the genetic code of the mitochondria differ slightly from that of the nucleus (and the rest of the cell). 
The mitochondria's energy from respiration is stored in an ion gradient across the organelle's double membrane, known as the &quot;Mitchell Hypothesis&quot;.

Mitochondrial Biogenesis:
It’s a metabolic adaptation where mitochondrial mass increases which allow for conduction of glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, and ultimately result in higher mitochondrial metabolic capacity. With greater capacity to synthesize and transport fuels to mitochondria, the metabolic response would be faster, which can be beneficial for athletes during exercise. However, this improvement requires exercise and training. 

[[File:Animal mitochondrion diagram en (edit).svg|400px]]

Mitochondria produce ATP by oxidative respiration. A cell may contain tens or hundreds of mitochondria, depending on its energy needs. Mitochondria have two membranes: an outer membrane and an inner membrane. The inner membrane has many infoldings called cristae that increase its surface area. It is thought that as a result of the endocytosis of the bacterium, the inner mitochondrial membrane is derived from the larger eukaryote. Also, the inner membrane has structural characteristics of a prokaryotic cell membrane, while the outer membrane is similar to the host eukaryotic membrane. Mitochondria contains tow distinct compartments: the matrix inside the inner membrane and the intermembrane space between the two membranes. The tricarboxylic acid cycle takes place inside the matrix, the metabolic equivalent of the prokaryotic cytoplasm. Furthermore, the fact that the mitochondria contain their own DNA and ribosomes lends further support to endosymbiosis, since these cell features would be a necessary part of any free-living organism. Both the DNA and ribosomes of mitochondria show similarities with the DNA and ribosomes of bacteria.

==Inner Mitochondria &amp; Matrix==

Inside the deepest compartments of the mitochondria is the mitochondrian matrix. It is in the matrix that cellular respiration occurs, where pyruvate (a product of glycolysis in the cytosol) is converted to Carbon Dioxide and water. The matrix is the site of the citric acid cycle, whereby the electron transport chain is used to setup a proton gradient between the inner and outer membrane of the mitochondria, known as the inter membrane space. The protons in the inter membrane space accumulate to a point that the concentration gradient causes the protons to flow back into the matrix. 

It is the inner membrane that is studded with the proteins necessary for the electron transport chain, such as the cytochrome electron shuttles. Upon reentering the matrix, the H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; go through ATP synthase, which in turns powers the synthase to phosphorylate adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The ATP can be used later on to be coupled with thermodynamically unfavorable reactions to allow those chemical reactions to proceed. The inner membrane is folded and convoluted which allows for a greater surface area to utulize for the electron transport chain. These convolutions are what make up the cristae. 

Interestingly enough the matrix of the mitochondria are one of the few locations outside of the nucleus where genetic information can be found in the cell. Mitochondrial DNA is similar in appearance to that of bacterial DNA due to its circular shape. The matrix is also known to house [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid/RNA/Transfer RNA (tRNA)|tRNA]] and [[Structural Biochemistry/Cell Organelles/Ribosome|ribosomes]], which further solidifies the theory that the mitochondria entered the ancestral eukaryotic cell as single celled organism.

==Outer Membrane==

The outer mitochondria membrane consist of a  phospholipid bilayer], laced throughout with integral proteins. The [[Structural Biochemistry/Lipids/Lipid Bilayer|lipid bilayer]] contains porins which allow the passage of molecules which are 10,000 Daltons or less. This permeability in the outer membrane allows for water, ions, and some proteins to flow freely into the inter membrane space.

==Mitochondria as ATP Consumer==

It is well documented mitochondria produce the ATP necessary for life, and that a proton gradient and membrane potential are required in order for ATP synthesis to occur in the mitochondria. However, mitochondria is very dynamic in that it can reverse its process. Complex V is the enzyme responsible for final ATP synthesis at the end of oxidative phosphorylation. When the trans-membrane potential is insufficient for ATP production, complex V, or F1F0-ATP synthase, can reverse its process, instead hydrolyzing ATP in order to pump protons out of the mitochondrial matrix in order to restore the proper gradient.

In a normal mitochondria performing respiration, ATP is removed through the adenine nucleotide translocase, or ANT. This helps maintain the trans-membrane potential, favoring phosphorylation of ADP. However, ATP hydrolysis is favored when the ANT is reverse, shuttling in ATP from glycolysis. 

The consumption of ATP by mitochondria can clearly be potentially lethal to cells in conditions of extreme proton gradient degradation. It can also serve as a potential mechanism used by pathogens in the case of diseases related to mitochondrial respiration inhibition, (such as lack of oxygen in stroke or heart attack, or in less extreme cases where mitochondria are affected such as Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s). 

This reversal process of complex V is directly affected by IF1, the inhibitory factor of F1F0-ATPase. In response to acidification of the matrix of the mitochondria, the IF1 protein inhibits the activity of complex V as ATPase, usually in conjunction with the halting of respiration in conditions such as hypoxia or ischaemia. There is still much to learn about the mechanisms of IF1, however it is the major factor in protecting cells from ATP depletion in hypoxic conditions. 

The crystal structure of IF1 is known. The protein acts as a homodimer, inhibiting two F1-ATPase units synchronously. There are many residues in the protein complex that form many associations with subunits of the F1-ATPase. It is believed that full association of IF1 with the F1F0-ATPase occurs only during ATP hydrolysis. It is suggested that IF1 may loosely bind to the F1-ATPase even during normal respiration, and that it may also aid in the efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation by serving as a ‘coupling factor.’

==Mitochondria:ROS and Authophagy==

The cite of Reactive Oxygen Species production with in the cell is found in the mitochondria. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are small, highly reactive molecules that are short-lived. An incomplete one-electron reduction of oxygen is how ROS is formed.ROS includes oxygen anions, free radicals, and peroxides. Autophagy is one of the signaling pathways of the redox regulation of proteins by levels of ROS. Stress conditions activate autophagy, but pathological conditions deregulate autophagy. A build up of ROS can lead to oxidative stress that causes cellular constituents to be oxidized and damaged. Non-enzymatic and enzymatic antioxidizing agents have been created by the cell to prevent oxidative stress. Antioxidants are natural downregulators of ROS inducing autophagy. Autophagy is inhibited by TIGAR.

'''&lt;big&gt;Role in Signaling Pathway&lt;/big&gt;'''

In addition to being known for their toxic effects on the mitochondria, ROS are also found to help in cellular signaling pathways. For example, when the brain and body are low on oxygen (hypoxia), mitochondrial generation of ROS to turn on signaling pathways that regulate transcription, maintenance of calcium stores, and overall energy management. At the level of the organism, ROS helps to control and manage fluid absorption and exchange of oxygen in the pulmonary circuit. Studies have shown ROS to help with the level of cellular signaling but more research still needs to be done to determine if whether ROS processes are innate to the mitochondria or if other cellular factors are required.

==Reactive oxygen species==

Although reactive oxygen species (ROS) is commonly viewed as toxic byproducts of mitochondrial synthesis of ATP, ROS are crucial as intermediates of cellular signaling pathways; ROS has essential role in oxidative homeostasis and propagation of signaling pathway. There are certain pathways that affect or depend on the production of ROS. The level/accumulation of ROS also suggests biological outcomes. 

'''How ROS are produced?'''

:*ROS are produced during electron transport chain (ETC) of mitochondrial synthesis of ATP 
:*Through complex I, II, and III of ETC, molecular oxygen is reduced to superoxide anion, which is primary ROS produced by mitochondria. 
::*ROS in the matric are produced through all complex I, II, and III
::*ROS in the intermembrane space are only produced through complex III
:*The rate of production of ROS depends on the concentration of electron carriers that are able to reduce molecular oxygen and type of electron carriers, which have different rate of electron release and supply among different electron carriers. 

'''How level of ROS responses to hypoxia and mediates signaling pathways?'''
:*Under hypoxia, cells are exposed to low oxygen. Consequently, adaptive transcriptional program, reduction of cellular oxygen usage, and decrease in the consumption of ATP are promoted by the activation of signaling pathways due the increase in production of ROS. 
:*In response to hypoxia, the production of ROS is increased through Q-cycle, which is a specific hypoxic generation of ROS through mitochondrial complex III. The increase in ROS then activates the signaling pathways.
::*Increase in production of ROS inhibits the activity of PHD. The inhibition of activity of PHD later enables the stabilization of HIF that eventually leads to the transcriptional regulation, such as erythropoiesis, glycolysis, angiogenesis, cell cycle, and survival
::*Increase in the production of ROS triggers the activity of AMPK that increase the production of ATP and minimize the cellular usage of ATP. The activation of AMPK also inhibits the activity of mTOR so that ATP is conserved by inhibiting protein translations that consumes lots of ATP. Eventually, the increase in the production of ROS also reduces the consumption of oxygen because the accumulation of ATP is maximized by activity of AMPK

'''How level of ROS responses to PI3-kinase pathway?'''
:*The activation of PI3 leads to the activation of Akt that would increase the accumulation of ROS by two ways. 
::#Through metabolic pathway, mTOR is activated by Akt activity, and oxygen consumption and production ATP are increased. As a result, the production of ROS is increased
::#Akt activity inhibits ROS scavenging by inhibiting FOXOs, which are antioxidants that inhibit the activity of ROS

'''Important role of ROS''' 
:*Stem cell population
::*Low level of ROS leads to quiescence, which is a state of inactivity, and maintenance of stem cell population. While the level of ROS increasing, population of stem cell is differentiating and proliferating
:*Oxidative homeostasis
::*ROS regulates activity of phosphatases that oppose the activity of kinases and possess a reactive cysteine, which enables oxidation of cysteine and the reduction of ROS
::*ROS maintains oxidative homoeostasis through regulating phosphatases 
:*TNFα treatment
::*Outcomes of TNFα treatment depends on activity of two TNFR complexes
:::*NF-ĸB → cell survival
:::*JNK → cell death
::*The activity of TNFR complexes depend on cellular level of ROS
:::*Increasing level of ROS → increasing activity of JNK and decreasing activity of NF-ĸB → cell death
:::*Decreasing level of ROS → decreasing activity of JNK and increasing activity of NF-ĸB → cell survival

'''How ROS affects the cellular transformation?'''
:*Cellular transformation is caused by the activation of oncogenes and loss of [[Structural Biochemistry/Tumor suppressor genes|tumor suppressor genes]]. As a result, there are signaling pathways controlling proliferation, survival and metabolism of cancer cells. 
:*In normal cells, high level of ROS triggers the activation of tumor suppressor to enable the apoptosis and senescence
:*[[/High level of ROS/]] → high mutation rate and genomic instability → tumor growth
::*ROS as signaling intermediates: if Ras or Myc is expressed due to certain accumulation of ROS, the cellular transformation will occur. 
::*Vicious cycle
:::#lose of tumor suppressor
:::#sustainability of higher level of ROS
:::#proliferation, angiogenesis, and survival pathway of tumor
:::#more accumulation of ROS
:::#leads to #1
:*High level of ROS not only promote tumor growth but also increases possibility of metastasis, the spread of cancer cells from one part to another non-adjacent part

'''Misconception about ROS'''
:*Misconception #1: ROS are solely damaging agents 
::*It is wrong because only when the accumulation of ROS is really high, the irreversible damages (cellular transformation, tumor growth, etc.) will occur. In fact, certain amount of ROS is required for the cell to proliferate, differentiate, and promote the fitness of the organisms. 
:*Misconception #2: Because ROS contributes to human aging and pathologies, mortality can be increased through scavenging ROS by antioxidants.  
::*It is not true because study has shown there is a correlation between lifespan extension and high oxidative stress. This correlation suggests the association between lifespan extension with increase in mitochondrial metabolism and production of ROS

==Quality control==

Reactive oxygen species (ROS), the byproducts of synthesis of ATP in mitochondria, is harmful; ROS damage molecules in mitochondria; as a result, mitochondria are no longer functional. The accumulation of molecular damage would finally lead to cellular degeneration and death. The solution of the accumulation of ROS in mitochondria is the quality control (QC) mechanisms that keep mitochondria functional. Although different QC pathways minimize the harm of ROS in different ways, each QC pathway has its own capacity of regulating the ROS. Therefore, the mitochondrial QC work into a hierarchical surveillance network. 

''QC at molecular level''

* '''ROS scavenging'''

:*The first defense in a network of QC pathways 
:*Counteract molecular damage when a critical threshold of molecular damage is reached
:*Key components: small molecules and enzymes
:*Decelerate the speed of molecular damaging 
:*Although ROS scavenging pathways are effective in decelerating the space, they are unable to completely prevent molecular damage

* '''Repair and Refolding'''

:*The second defense in a network of QC pathways 
:*Repair specific modifications and restore the function of impaired function after damage has occurred 
:*The homeostasis of mitochondria protein is controlled through protein degradation, de novo protein synthesis, and refolding of misfolded proteins back to their original 3-D structure
:*The repair of damaged mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which encodes essential subsets of proteins, the two RNA subunits of the mitochondrial ribosome and tRNAs needed for mitochondrial protein biosynthesis, is also important
::*Base excision repair
::*Direct reversal 
::*Mismatch repair
::*Proofreading activity of polymerase during mtDNA replication
:*However, majority of proteins are not able to repair or refold efficiently. 

*'''Removal and replacement'''
:*The defense in a network of QC pathways after the repair and refolding of proteins
::*A molecular pathway of removing aberrant protein through protein degradation machinery when a critical threshold of unfolded or damaged protein is reached
:*Due to the limited capacity of repair and refolding of proteins, there is further decline of cellular function, removal and replacement of damaged proteins through proteolysis
::#Degradation of damaged proteins; cleavage of presequences and the maturation of proteins
::#replacement with newly synthesized functional proteins

Even though mitochondrial QC in molecular level can somewhat regulate the damage due to ROS, it is not sufficient enough to keep mitochondria functional and proliferating over time. Since several mitochondrial protein complexes are also encoded by nuclear genome, after the removal of damaged proteins, the coordinated expression of mitochondrial and nuclear genes and correct assembly of the proteins into macromolecular complexes is also essential for keeping mitochondrial functional. This last crucial step is dependent on the import of proteins from cytoplasm and a correct inner-mitochondrial sorting.

''QC at the organellar level'' 

*'''Fission and fusion of mitochondria'''
:*The first QC pathway in organgllar level when the accumulation of damage molecules can not be solved by molecular QC pathways
:*Fission – content separation
::*Separation of larger organelle into multiple smaller organelles 
::*Controlled by three proteins: Dnm1, Fis1 and Mdv1
:*Fusion – content mixing
::*Combination of multiple smaller organelles into larger organelle
::*Controlled by three proteins: Fzo1, Ugo1 and Mgm1 
:*Through fission and fusion, mitochondria are able to maintain their functions due to degradation of damaged mitochondria; each mitochondria wouldn’t have too much damaged components since content are either mixing or separating from each other. 
::*High stress → fission
::*Low stress → fusion

*'''Mitophagy'''
:*The last step of mitochondrial QC pathway
:*The remaining damaged and dysfunctional mitochondria are eventually eliminated from the vital mitochondrial network
:*Mitophagy is a type of autophagy (“self-eating”) that the whole mitochondria are engulfed by autophagic membrane, leading the formation of autophagosomes
:*Works with fission and fusion
::*The mitochondria network is separated into individual mitochondria through fission. The damaged or dysfunctional individual mitochondria is then eliminated (“eaten”) through mitophagy. The remaining vital mitochondria are combined together into a new vital mitochondrial network through fusion. 
:*It is highly selective process that is tightly regulated.
Mitophagy in mammalian cells is regulated via PINK 1 which is a serine/threonine kinase [[Structural Biochemistry/PTEN|PTEN]]-induced putative kinase and the E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin. In a healthy mitochondria PINK 1 is cleaved by PARL in the inner mitochondrial membrane. However, when there is sustained mitochondrial damage PINK 1 is able to accumulate in the outer mitochondrial membrane where it cannot be cleaved by PARL. This accumulation of PINK 1 attracts Parkin which in turn induces mitophagy.

==Endosymbiont Theory==

In 1905, Mereschkowsky, a Russian biologist, published a paper on the theory that photosynthetic bacteria are the ancestors of modern day plant chloroplasts. Though this research was mostly ignored for several years, scientists came to see the similarities between isolated living bacteria and eukaryotic mitochondria. 
It is now largely accepted that mitochondria are descendants of &quot;free-living&quot; bacteria that were engulfed and incorporated as organelles by eukaryotic cells. The endosymbiont theory was further confirmed when mitochondria were discovered to contain their own DNA. It was confirmed even more so with the discovery that the mtDNA made enzymes and proteins that were needed for its own functionalities. The fact that the mitochondria also contains a double membrane also depicts the notion that it was originally a free living organism that was later ingested into another host.&lt;ref name=&quot;endo&quot;&gt;[http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/begin/cells/organelles/ The Evolution of the Cell]&lt;/ref&gt;
Mitochondria are produced by other mitochondria that act as &quot;structural templates&quot;. A cell's two DNA genomes are still not aware of how mitochondrial membranes are assembled, showing that a mitochondria's structure isn't dictated by our DNA but must be passed on to future generations. 

==Mitochondria DNA==

Mitochondria are the energy processing organelle that is found in the cell. Alongside with chloroplast, mitochondria are part endosymbiont theory, as stated above. The endosymbiont theory clearly stated the following about mitochondria and chloroplasts: it is enclosed by a double-membrane, it is about the same size as bacteria, it has its own circular DNA, its ribosomes are bacteria-like, and it has prokaryotic activities such as respiration and photosynthesis (mitochondria and chloroplasts respectively). Focusing on the third point about having its own circular DNA, mitochondria DNA (mtDNA) was found to be able to self-translate and replicate itself.

=== Genetics of mtDNA ===

Unlike nuclear DNA which is inherited from both mother and father, the mammalian mtDNA is only inherited from mother. The mitochondria in mammalian sperm are destroyed in the fertilized oocyte. However, the replication pathway of mtDNA is very similar to nuclear DNA. Before replication, mtDNA becomes unwind by TWINKLE, which is a protein used to undo the double-stranded DNA. After the double-stranded is undone, it is replicated at one end with the help of mtDNA polymerase. mtDNA polymerase starts to form another double-stranded starting at 5' end of the mtDNA. Another protein called mitochondrial single-stranded binding (mtSSB) helps stabilize the unwound conformation and stimulates DNA synthesis by the polymerase holoenzyme.

Unfortunately, mtDNA replication displays no strict phase specificity as in nuclear DNA synthesis. Therefore, segregation of heteroplasmic mtDNA mutation can occur as a cell divides.

=== Mitochondrial transcription ===

The transcription mechanism in mitochondria is likely similar to transcription in nucleus. However, there are some differences between RNA synthesis in mitochondria and in nucleus.
The individual strands of the mtDNA molecules are denoted heavy strand (guanine rich) and light strand (guanine poor). This nucleotide bias explains why some codons are rare or absent in mitochondrial RNA.

The compact mammalian mtDNA genome lacks introns. The entire strand codes for either proteins,  rRNA, or tRNA. Therefore, there is no need for slicing process in mitochondria 

Each of the protein and rRNA genes is immediately flanked by at least one tRNA gene.

==Some Interesting Discoveries about Mitochondria==
1. Albert Claude, who was a Belgian biochemist discovered in the first half of the last century discovered that Mitochondria catalyzed respiration. He did this by isolating them through centrifugation.

2. Scientists started from there and managed to map out the flow of electrons in cellular respiration in the past two decades. 

3. Peter Mitchell then discovers that the key to the flow of free energy in respiration and photosynthesis is stored within the ion gradient across membranes. He receives a Nobel Prize for it in 1978.

4. Mitochondria is bordered by 2 membranes and, and holds one tenth of the cell’s proteins. Mitochondria also converts 10,000 to 50,000 times more energy per second than the sun does. 

5. Mitochondria was also discovered to play a pivotal role in programmed cell death, or apoptosis. This shows mitochondria to thus also be part of the signal transduction network in the cell. For programmed cell death, Mitochondria first releases proteins called cytochromes into the cell’s cytoplasm. It is these signals that could potentially release proteases and nucleases onto the cell and trigger cellular suicide. 

6. Isolated Mitochondria were discovered to produce their own proteins even though the identity of these proteins are yet to be determined. 

7. It is a theory that Mitochondria evolved from bacteria, which explains why it is such an independent organelle and doesn’t seem to depend on other parts of the cell for survival. Another evidence for this rests in the fact that the mechanism for protein synthesis in mitochondria is similar to that in bacteria.

8. Mitochondria spread by growth and division of previously existing mitochondria. Mitochondria are thus able to tell building blocks for new mitochondria where to go and what to do. 

9. Recent discoveries have revealed that mitochondria actually have a lot of extramitochondrial molecules that help regulate the expression of genes that turn into mitochondrial proteins. Peroxisomal-proliferator-actived receptor coactivator 1 (PGC1) plays a major role in this process.

10. The space in between the mitochondria’s membranes was recently discovered to be able to oxidize sulfhydryl groups to disulfide bridges even though that space is surrounded by highly reducing environments.

==Role in Aging==

Scientists believe that there is a strong correlation between mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitochondrial dysfunction is one of mitochondrial diseases and is caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Reactive oxygen species cause oxidative damage that degrades the ability of mitochondria to make ATP. This means that mitochondria fail to carry out their metabolic functions, leading to cell death &lt;ref&gt; http://www.mrc-mbu.cam.ac.uk/research/mitochondrial-dysfunction&lt;/ref&gt;. Since mitochondrial dysfunction is a factor of cell death, it is reasonable to believe that such a correlation between mitochondrial dysfunction and aging exists.
It should be noted before anything that regulation of complex protein-folding environment within the organelle is vital for keeping productive metabolic output. The reason for its necessity is that without efficient metabolic output, chemical wastes and heat produced in metabolic processes, which are potential harms to the cell, cannot be transported out of the cell. Despite the fact the cells do have such complex systems to maintain efficient metabolic output, several factors come into play to prevent this. We note 2 factors here;
1. It is inevitable that over a long period of time, dysregulation of protein homeostatis arises through stress caused by the accumulation of reactive oxygen species.
2. A failure at maintaining efficient metabolic output can also be induced by mutations in the mitochondrial genome introduced during replication. 

These two reasons that deteriorate mitochondria's normal functions are dependent on time; the longer a mitochondrion lives, the magnitude of these time-related effects increases. Therefore, it is believed that damage incurred on mitochondria is deeply involved in aging. 

Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)
Having explained that reactive oxygen species are a crucial factor in aging, it is necessary to figure out what they really are. By definition, they are chemically reactive molecules containing oxygen. &lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_oxygen_species&lt;/ref&gt;
These are examples of some reactive oxygen species;
1. molecules like hydrogen peroxide
2. ions like hipochlorite ion 
3. radials like hydroxyl radial (this is the most reactive of all kinds of reactive oxygen species) 
4. ions like superoxide anion (this is both ion and radical)

Roles of the mitochondrial proteome in aging

The mitochondrial proteome sustains the cell's cellular metabolism. 
Cellular metabolism inside itochondria such as ATP production, apoptosis, and regulation of intracellular calcium. They are all essential elements to sustain life. However, the costs of maintaining such functions are the damaging effects of reactive oxygen species, as mentioned earlier. The mitochondrial proteome comprises mitochondrial and nuclear DNA-encoded proteins that needs folding and assembly within mitochondria. The two genomes that code for the structural requirements are damaged by accumulation of reactive oxygen species over time. The proteome of mammals is made up of between 1000 to 1500 proteins. 
Here is a summary of protein production. The list shows how proteins made in the cell are transported into mitochondria in the cell.
1. proteins are encoded in the nucleus
2. proteins are translated in the cytoplasm
3. the unfolded state of the proteins is maintained and then is imported into mitochondria.
Unfolded proteins are needed to to construct ETC in mitochondria. To assist mitochondrial biogensis and transferring of mtDNA and proteome, mitochondria must go through series of fission and fusion. Just like other organelles do, this organelle fission functions to multiply the number of mitochondria. It also serves to remove defective organelles for autophagic degradation &lt;ref&gt;“Mitochondrial protein quality control during biogenesis and aging” by Brooke M. Baker, Cole M. Haynes&lt;/ref&gt; 

Misfolded and misassembled mitochondrial proteins
Researchers have found that inhibition of mtDNA replication, accumulation of orphaned mitochondrial complex subunits or harmful protein aggregates and ROS all can create an excessive amount of misfolded mitochondrial proteins in yeast and Caenorhabditis elegans. It should be reasonable that accumulation of such misfolded and misassembled proteins generated by those factors lead to destruction of certain mitochondrial metabolic function and its dysfunction ultimately. 
Here is a summary of how aging disease in mitochondria occurs
1. Reactive oxygen species accumulate inside the mitochondrion
2. This follows two possible consequences. One is that reactive oxygen species react with mtDNA and cause mtDNA mutations. It should be emphasized once again that reactive oxygen species are highly reactive agents. The other possible consequence is reactive oxygen species directly attack mitochondrial proteins. The proteins are distorted as a result.
3. mtDNA mutations caused by reactive oxygen species no longer encode for ordinary mitochondrial proteins. What encoded and translated from these mutated mtDNA are, in fact, misfolded proteins. 
4. Keep in mind that proteins are used to build the complicated network of ETC. When misfold proteins are created, as long as they are present in the mitochondria, they will be used as building blocks of ETC. ETCs with misfolded proteins embedded in them no longer function properly. In other words, the mitochondria face ETC dysfunction. 
5. ETCs with misfolded proteins cause to create more reactive oxygen species. As more reactive oxygen species are generated, this vicious cycle continues and misfolded proteins accumulate inside the mitochondria. Over time, the mitochondria die. 

Non-native amino acids that damage the three dimensional structure of proteins are actively generated in the process of cytosolic translation of mitochondrial proteins &lt;ref&gt;“Mitochondrial protein quality control during biogenesis and aging” by Brooke M. Baker, Cole M. Haynes&lt;/ref&gt;. 
Degrees of challenge of non-native amino acids derived from errors in cytosolic translation (under optimal conditions)
- nearly 10% of newly synthesized proteins are mistranslated
- 20-30 % of all nascent polypeptides are quickly denatured permanently due to folding errors

Organelle biogenesis and complex assembly
Complex I of ETC is named as the NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase. Complex I is known to possess about 45 subunits. And mutations or functional failures are known to be potential causes of neurodegenerative diseases. Such diseases include Parkinson's disease. Out of the 45 subunits of ETC, 7 of them are encoded by the genome in mitochondria. They need to be embedded into the mitochondrial inner membrane because that is where they build stoichiometric complexes with nuclear-encoded components. Suppose that one of the subunits was misexpressed due to mutation. Then the entire network of ETC is doomed to collapse. In other words, mutations or deletions of ETC's subunits (even just single mutation or deletion), have a tremendous effect on whole complex formation. This illustrates the significance of the coordination of genome of proper complex assembly and function. 

Mitochondrial compartments
There are four compartments in mitochondria where protein folding and assembly happens. The four compartments are the outer membrane, intermembrane space, inner membrane and matrix &lt;ref&gt;“Mitochondrial protein quality control during biogenesis and aging” by Brooke M. Baker, Cole M. Haynes&lt;/ref&gt;. It should be stressed that misfolded proteins can build up in those compartments. The interesting fact is that there exists a structure in the mitochondria that monitors these levels of accumulation. Compartment-specific QC machinery is the one which is responsible for monitoring the accumulating unfolded proteins. Normal fold proteins have hydrophobic amino acids buried inside them and their heads often stick out. Caperones and QC proteases then come into place to acknowledge these hydrophobic amino acid heads. 
We should divide how the QC monitors the level of unfolded proteins into each compartment. 
Outer Membrane
It seems from recent evidence that cytosolic chaperones and the ubiquitin-proteasome system are involved in the mechanisms that regulated quality control of mitochondrial protein import or outer membrane proteins. Nuclear-encoded proteins which are ordered to form mitochondria are translated in the cytoplasm. The chaprerones are used to sustain precursor proteins that are unfolded or misfolded. They also serve to prevent protein accumulation during delivery to the translocase of the outer membrane channel


Damage done by different types of reactive oxygen species

-reactive oxygen species attack mitochondrial proteins and DNA during cell division
-superoxide anion is derived from dominantly from complexes I and III of the ETC during oxidative phosphorylaiton. Superoxide anion, having a strong negative charge upon it, can deteriorate all four mitochondrial compartments. 
- storing up an excessive amount of reactive oxygen species could totally overwhelm mitochondrial ROS-detoxifying systems. 
-  reactive oxygen species may directly interfere with protein folding by changing its aminoacid sequence, giving its secondary and tertiary structures 
inevitable and irreversible changes
- reactive oxygen species may indirectly interfere with protien folding by introducing mutations in genes encoded by mitochondrial or nuclear DNA.
- note that mtDNA is very vulnerable to oxidative damage because it is located ner the site of reactive oxygen species production and does not have histone protection


Age-associated organelles damage
In the long run, the decrease in mitochondrial function caused by reactive oxygen species and mtDNA and others leads to the onset of progressive age-associated pathologies  &lt;ref&gt;“Mitochondrial protein quality control during biogenesis and aging” by Brooke M. Baker, Cole M. Haynes&lt;/ref&gt;
1. cancer
2. neurodegeneratin
3. hearing loss
It is should be aware that accumulation of destruction caused by free radical is one of the most commonly cited effects of age-related mitochondrial dysfunction.

Researchers have used knockin mouse strains that express error-prone mtDNA polymerases that ignore proof-reading activity. The mous matures normally, but showed properties that are determined to be accelerated aging. These symptoms included;
- apoptosis
- curvature of the spine
- reduced fertility
- weight loss
- early death 
&lt;ref&gt;“Mitochondrial protein quality control during biogenesis and aging” by Brooke M. Baker, Cole M. Haynes. &lt;/ref&gt;.

Recent research into aging has lead scientists to believe that damage done by free radical oxygen may be one reason why organisms die from old age. Reactive Oxygen Species, or ROS, are produced in greatest quantity at the mitochondria, so this organelle is the most likely to be damaged by the free radical oxygen. Increases in ROS damage the mitochondria in several ways. They can modify amino acids and mutate the genes in mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, all affecting proper protein folding. Furthermore, ROS causes oxidative damage to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), especially because mtDNA is near the ROS production area&lt;ref&gt;Brooke M. Baker, Cole M. Haynes, Mitochondrial protein quality control during biogenesis and aging, Trends in Biochemical Sciences, Volume 36, Issue 5, May 2011, Page 255, ISSN 0968-0004, 10.1016/j.tibs.2011.01.004. &lt;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968000411000156&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;. Mutations on the mtDNA could result in reduced ATP production, increased ROS production, and eventual apoptosis. The increased ROS production has the added effect of being potentially harmful to the cell hosting the mitochondria, which could cause mutation in the cell DNA. 

Anti-aging research has shown in some model organisms that by genetically disrupting the function of mitochondria life span has been increased. This is because ROS production was decreased so that less damage was done to the mtDNA. Specifically, a reduction in the mitochondrial function of the electron transport chain (ETC) in c. elegans increased longevity of the organism. 

Scientists hope to be able to apply this to extending human lifespan by somehow incorporating reduced mitochondrial function with a treatment of dietary restriction (DR). By reducing the amount of calories taken in, but not to the point of starvation, cellular processes would change such that emphasis is placed on maintaining existing cellular structures rather than generating new structures to replace old structures. This would cause cells to persist in the body longer and there would be fewer mutations due to gene replication during mitosis.

Recent studies have underscored the importance of mitochondrial quality control (QC) pathways such as chaperones and proteases in solving mitochondrial dysfunctions. The protease complex &quot;Lon&quot; contains a cofactor made of iron-sulfur clusters; it is therefore suspected that Lon plays a role in targeting proteins by making them susceptible to oxidative damage. Findings suggest that a lack of Lon in yeast and mammalian cells results in excess proteins and mtDNA deletions, as well as respiration loss&lt;ref&gt;Brooke M. Baker, Cole M. Haynes, Mitochondrial protein quality control during biogenesis and aging, Trends in Biochemical Sciences, Volume 36, Issue 5, May 2011, Page 258, ISSN 0968-0004, 10.1016/j.tibs.21.01.00014. &lt;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968000411000156&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;. These all suggest that Lon plays a role in quality control systems in the mitochondria. On the other hand, over-expression of Lon in the fungus ''Podospora anserina'' leads to greater cell life span&lt;ref&gt;Brooke M. Baker, Cole M. Haynes, Mitochondrial protein quality control during biogenesis and aging, Trends in Biochemical Sciences, Volume 36, Issue 5, May 2011, Page 259, ISSN 0968-0004, 10.1016/j.tibs.2011.01.004. &lt;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968000411000156&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;. This suggests that there can be ways to artificially enhance the activity of proteases in order to increase cell longevity. Although many studies have strongly implied the importance of chaperones and proteases in anti-aging properties, it is important to note that fewer studies have been done in mammals.

==Mitochondrial protein import==
Although mitochondria have unique genetic and protein synthesis system, majority of mitochondrial proteins are synthesized as precursors in the cytosol and are imported to mitochondria from the cytosol. Now, five different protein import pathways have been distinguished. Since these pathways cooperate with each other and are connected to other systems that function in the respiratory chain, mitochondrial membrane organization, protein quality control and endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria junctions, mitochondrial protein import is highly responsible for major mitochondrial functions.

'''Two classical import routes:'''

Classical import routes include presequence pathway and carrier pathway. Both pathways use the core of TOM (translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane) complex, which is the main protein entry gate of mitochondria including Tom 40, to transport precursor from the cytosol to intermembrane space.

''Presequence pathway'' targets proteins carry cleavable presequences, which are peptide extensions of about 10 to 60 amino acids residues located at the N-terminal end of the protein

# Cleavable precursor proteins are recognized by the receptor Tom20 and Tom22 and are transported across the outer membrane from the cytosol to intermembrane space through Tom40 channel 
#Cleavable precursor proteins are then transferred to Tim23 complex (presequence translocase of the inner mitochondrial membrane) with the help of intermembrane space-exposed proteins, including Tim25 and Tim22. The membrane potential of the inner membrane enables Tim23 channel to translocate the preseqyebces across the inner membrane. The transport of protein into the matrix requires the ATP that powers the PAM (presequence translocase-associated motor).
#Presequences-carrying precursors are inserted into the inner membrane by two different ways. A) Many presequence-containing inner membrane proteins are laterally released from the Tim23 complex as the inner membrane proteins. Some of the hydrophobic sorting signal of some presequences are removed by the inner membrane peptidase complex and released into the intermembrane space as the intermembrane space proteins. B)Other precursor proteins are first transported into the matrix and eventually integrated into the inner membrane through Oxa1 export complex.

''Carrier pathway'' transports non-cleavable precursor proteins into inner membrane.

# Non-cleavable precursors are recognized by the receptor Tom70 and are transported across the outer membrane from the cytosol to intermembrane space through Tom40 channel
#The precursor proteins are then guided by small TIM chaperone, such as Tim9-Tim10 complex, to the Tim22 complex (the carrier translocase of the inner mitochondrial membrane). The membrane potential of the inner membrane enables Tim22 to insert precursor proteins into the inner membrane as the carrier proteins.

'''Two routes of inserting proteins into the outer membrane:'''

The outer membrane of mitochondria contains two classes protein: β-barrel proteins, which are probably derived from the bacterial ancestor of mitochondria, and proteins with α-helical transmembrane segments, which are probably derived from the eukaryotic cell. The two routes of inserting two different proteins are called β-barrel pathway (SAM) and α-helical insertion (Mim1) reprehensively. Although SAM and Mim1 complexes insert precursor proteins independently, they can cooperate with each other to assemble some outer membrane complexes, such as TOM complex, which consists of central beta-barrel protein Tom40 and some α-helical subunits. 

''β-barrel pathway'' inserts β-barrel protein via SAM complexes

#β-barrel precursors are recognized by TOM receptors and are translocated to the intermembrane space by Tom40 channel.
#β-barrel precursors are then guided by small TIM chaperone to the SAM complex, Sam50 and Sam35, and are converted to outer membrane β-barrel proteins, which is also linked to ER-mitochondria junctions due to the dual localization of Mdm10 in SAM and ERMES, ER-mitochondria encounter structure

''α-helical insertion'' inserts most Tom proteins, which have a single α-helical transmembrane segment, and outer membrane proteins with multiple α-helical transmembrane segments via Mim1, which contains one α-helical transmembrane segment.

#α-helical precursors are recognized by Tom and are transferred to Mim1.
#α-helical precursors are then interacted with Mim1 and are inserted into the outer membrane. [The exact function of Mim1 and how Mim1 really inserts precursor proteins is still unknown]

'''Protein import into the intermembrane space:'''

''Mitochondrial intermembrane space assembly pathway (MIA)'' targets the intermembrane space precursors, which are cysteine-rich. 

#The precursors are transferred from cytosol to intermembrane space though TOM complexes in a reduced state. 
#When the precursors are in the intermembrane space, the precursors are oxidized and are immediately bound with Mia40, forming a transient disulfide bond. Then, Mia40 forms the oxidative folding of proteins, Erv1, to function as disulfide relay. Erv1 catalyzed the formation of disulfide bonds in Mia40 that oxidizes cysteines in the precursor proteins. As a result, new disulfide bonds are formed. Electrons flow from Mia40 to Erv1 and eventually to respiratory chain. In other words, Mia40 acts as a receptors that recognizes the precursors and enables the translocation of precursors into intermembrane space.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:T4_DNA_Ligase.jpg|frame|DNA ligase shown linking two strands of DNA.]]

DNA ligase is a special type of ligase that can link two DNA strands that have a break in both complementary strands of DNA together by creating phosphodiester bond. DNA ligase has applications in both DNA repair and DNA In addition. It is used a lot in molecular biology laboratories for genetic recombination experiments. DNA ligases are a useful tool in generating recombinant DNA sequences. For example, DNA fragments are cut with restriction enzymes and then recombined with DNA ligase.
DNA ligases are commonly found in E. Coli.


T4 DNA ligase is an enzyme that is encoded by the bacteriophage known as T4. In a reaction where the DNA molecues are being joined together at the 3'-hydroxy and 5'-phosophate termini, the ligase is used as a catalyst. Given that there are no missing nucelotides in the repare reaction, the ligase can also catalyze the covalent joining of two segments to one uniterrupted strand in a DNA duplex. In order to accomplish this catalytic activity, ATP and Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is required. DNA that lacks the required phosphate residues can still be made to ligate through phosphorylation with T4 polynucleotide kinase. Additionally, an exchange reaction of phosphate between pyrophosphate and ATP can also be catalyzed through use of the ligase.


== Characteristics of T4 DNA Ligase from ''E. coli'' lysogenic NM989 ==
The T4 DNA ligase is a single polypeptide with a molecular weight of 68,000 daltons. In order to obtain the maximum amount of activity from the ligase, a pH of 7.5-8.0 is desired. At pH levels of 6.9 and 8.3, the enzyme exhibits 40% and 65% of its full capabilities, respectively. As previously mentioned, Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is necessary for T4 DNA ligase to be effective, and the optimal concentration of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is 10mM. Sulfhydryl reagents (DTT, 2-mercaptoethanol) is also necessary in order to utilize the enzyme. If there is NaCl present, concentrations over 200 mM will stop all enzymatic reactions from occurring. for intermolecular ligation, especially when the substrate DNA consists of large DNA molecules PEG (concentrations of 1-10%) appears to stimulate the enzymatic activity.

== Application ==
T4 DNA ligase is mostly used in the joining of DNA molecules with compatible cohesive termini, or blunt-ended, double-stranded DNA to one another, or to synthetic linkers. The reaction that involves blund-ended DNA is slower than the other reactions, but the rate of ligation can be accelerated by adding 150 to 200 mM of NaCl along with a low concentration of PEG. If the 5' phosophate is absent in the DNA, then phosphorlation is necessary before ligation can be performed. Phosphorlyation is achieved through utilization T4 polynucleotide kinase with ATP. If the DNA fragments being joined together have protruding 5' termini that are not compatible with one another, it is still able to join the two fragments together by partial filling of the recessed 3' termini in controlled reactions using the Klenow fragment of ''E. Coli DNA'' polymerase I.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Cloning in plasmid vectors==
[[Image:DNAcloning.jpg]]
=== Introduction===

The success and easiness of cloning a DNA fragment into a plasmid vector depends on several factors. Cloning is significantly more successful when there is only one DNA fragment to be ligated into the plasmid vector. Compatibility of the ends of the two molecules is extremely essential. Cohesive complementary ends generate more efficient cloning then blunt ends. However, the highest cloning efficiency is achieved with DNA digested by two different restriction enzymes. Ligating templates prepared by this procedure is called directional cloning, because the insert DNA can only be ligated into the vector in a single orientation. This method dramatically decreases background level of non-recombinants. Another popular application is the cloning of PCR products produced by Taq polymerase. This polymerase adds a extra A at the 3'-end of amplified DNA, which assists the cloning of PCR products into a special vector.

===Preparation of the DNA insert===

The DNA is digested with suitable restriction enzymes to produce compatible ends for cloning. To guarantee that the correct restriction fragment is cloned, the DNA insert should be purified on an appropriate percentage agarose gel by gel electrophoresis. The DNA is then extracted and purified from the agarose gel to enhance ligation efficiency.

DNA inserts can be prepared from genomic DNA through PCR amplification. Designing appropriate forward and reverse primers is an critical step in this process. By designing appropriate flanking primers, a target sequence can be amplified from genomic DNA. Once the PCR reaction has been completed and the target sequence amplified, as stated above, the products can be run through a 1-2% agarose gel and then run through a gel purification kit to purify the specific sized fragments in question. The DNA eluate can then be sequenced for further confirmation of the correct DNA sequence to be cloned. Then the amplified DNA product can  be subjected to restriction digests or ligation.

===Preparing the vector for cloning===

The strategies for preparing the DNA inserts for cloning can be applied to the vector also, with the exception of introducing a restriction enzyme site by PCR.

Cloning vectors can also be prepared for cloning by making sure that the vector is in correct concentrations for the highest efficiency yield. Also, it is important to be sure that the vector is appropriate for ligation with the DNA fragment to be cloned. Similar restriction enzyme sites or digests should be applied to be sure that the fragment can &quot;fit in&quot; to the vector appropriately. Also, specific vectors can be chosen based on certain characteristics of the DNA fragment to be inserted such as A-overhangs or blunt-end cloning.

===Ligation of plasmid vector and insert DNA===

After the insert DNA and vector have been prepared for ligation, estimate the concentration of each by agarose gel electrophoresis along with molecular weight standards of a known concentration. Different vector:insert DNA ratios can be tested to find the optimal ratio for ligation. Generally, a 1:1 or 1:3 molar ratio works pretty well. Addition of DNA ligase (generally T4 DNA ligase) and ligase buffer containing ATP is required for this ligation step. 

Specifically designed vectors can also be purchased where specific polymerase enzymes are already on the entry sites of the vector for easier more efficient cloning of fragments into entry vectors, but at a higher price.

===Transformation of DNA into bacteria===

Usually this step is subsequent to ligation, transforming the vector-DNA insert into competent cells. The transformed cells are plated on LB plates with selective antibiotics and grown overnight. The vectors with the inserts are screened by various methods: blue/white color screening, antibiotic screening, etc. The correct clones are selected and grown, producing huge amounts of vector with the DNA insert. Plasmid DNA minipreps are then done to obtain these correct vectors of interest from the bacteria.

Transformation methods:

Cells can be transformed with the cloned vectors through electroporating competent cells or through chemically competent heat sensitive cells. Electroporating involves mixing electrocompetent cells with the cloned vectors and then running an electric current through the cells allowing them to take up the DNA. Cells are then shaken at an appropriate growth temperature in growth media to stimulate growth and then plated on antibiotic-selective LB plates to select for successfully transformed cells that took up the antibiotic resistant cloned vectors. Chemically competent cells are similar to electro-competent cells except they take up the cloned vectors through heat shock rather than electrical current.

      <text xml:space="preserve">T4 RNA Ligase catalyzes the ligation of a 5' phosphoryl-terminated nucleic acid donor to a 3' hydroxyl-terminated nucleic acid acceptor through the formation of a 3'→5' phosphodiester bond, with hydrolysis of ATP to AMP and PPi. Substrates include single-stranded RNA and DNA as well as dinucleoside pyrophosphates.
This ligase can be formed from Purified E. coli strain ER2497 which contains the plasmid pRF-E35. This enzyme is used for the labeling the 3’-terminus of RNA with a 5’-[32P].  It functions as the inter- and intramolecular joining of the RNA and DNA molecules.  It can also be used to synthesize single stranded oligodeoxyribo-nucleotides as well as incorporating additional amino acids into proteins.

[[Image:Bacterial Plate SH.png|thumb|Bacterial cells being cultivated in an agar plate]]

Some general considerations in the process of cloning can enhance the efficiency of cloning. The following are some tips:

1. The DNA insert/PCR product and vector digested by appropriate restriction enzymes should be purified directly, or from an agarose gel. This gets rid of the primers or the restriction fragments that are not of interest.

2. When performing ligation, the insert:vector ratio should be tested for the optimal conditions. Generally, a 1:1 or 3:1 ratio works well.

3. Screening for correct clones containing the vector with the DNA of interest inserted is very important. Common methods such as blue/white screening for B-Galactosidase activity and antibiotic screening are applied.   

4.Calf Intestinal Alkaline Phosphatase is a hydrolase  enzyme that is responsible for removing phosphate groups from nucleotides, proteins, etc. This enzyme can be used after digestion with restriction enzymes.

5.ATP is required for ligation. 

6.Enzymes are used to synthesize, degrade, join or remove portions of nucleic acids in a controlled and generally defined manner. 

7.Cloning Enzymes, are those important in nucleic acid cloning procedures.  Some cloning enzymes are used as ligases, kinases and phosphatases, and RecA proteins.

8. When using vectors with antibiotic resistance characteristics for selection, after transforming the cells allowing the cells to grow in appropriate growth medium and growth temperatures for several hours increases growth efficiency as well as antibiotic-resistance. This will allow for cells that successfully took up the cloned vectors to be better collected once plated onto antibiotic treated growth plates. The preliminary growth period in solution will stimulate cell activity in producing the antibiotic resistance characteristics.

9. Cross contamination when working with multiple cloned DNA vectors with similar antibiotic selections is a concerning issue. Washing, ethanol-treating, and flaming instruments is an important anti-cross-contamination measure to be taken seriously.

10. Sterile technique.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Description==
The T4 Polynucleotide Kinase (T4 PNK) catalyzes the transfer of the phosphate from ATP to the 5'-OH group of single- and double-stranded DNAs and RNAs as well as oligonucleotides. The reaction can be reversed. The enzyme is also a 3'-phosphatase and a homotetramer. It consists of four identical subunits of 28.9 kDa. The T4 polynucleotide kinase can be used in a buffer for restriction enzymes in techniques such as PCR.  It can be found in E. coli with a duplicated gene of the bacteriophage T4.  It can also be used for labeling 5’-terminus of nucleic acids which can be used as probes for hybridization, transcript mapping; markers for gel electrophoresis.  They can also be used as primers for DNA sequencing and PCR technique as well as an enzyme that removes the 3’-phosphate groups.

==Storage==
T4 Polynucleotide Kinase should be stored in -20°C

==Applications==
The T4 polynucleotide kinase is used for labeling the 5'-termini of nucleic acids, and the labeled products can be used int he following ways:
- markers for gel-electrophoresis
- primers for DNA sequencing
- primers for PCR
- probes for hybridization
- substrates for DNA and RNA ligases
- probes for transcrip mapping
5'-phosphorlation of oligonucleotide linkers and DNA or RNA is required before ligation can be performed. using the &lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;P-postlabeling assay, DNA modification can be detected.

==Miscellaneous==
The 5'-termini of nucleic acids can be labeled either through the forward or the exchange reaction. When the forward reaction is carried out, the phosphate from [&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;P or &lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt;P]-ATP is transferred to the 5'-hydroxyl end of DNA or RNA. If the nucleic acid already contains a 5'phosphate, though, that portion is removed either through the use of calf intestine alkaline phosphatase or bacterial alkaline phosphatase. When the exchange reaction is carried out, the nucleic acid 5'-phosphate is transferred to ADP and the radiolabeled phosphate from [&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;P or &lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt;P]-ATP is then transferred to the nucleic acid that does not contain a 5'-hhydroxyl group. The ideal buffer to use for the exchange reaction is Imidazole-HCl buffer, which has a pH of 6.4.
PEG is used to improve the rate and efficiency of the kinase reaction and should be added to the exchange reaction.
When phosphate and ammonium ions are present, the T4 polynucleotide kinase is inhibited. Prior to phosphorylation reaction, DNA should not be precipitate if ammonium ions are present.

'''Alkaline phosphatase''' is the enzyme that catalyzes a dephosphorylation of DNA, RNA, ribo-, and deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates.  It can also remove phosphates from nucleotides and proteins. They are most active at a basic pH. This enzyme has become very useful in molecular biology because this allows us to cleave the 5' end of DNA and prevent any further ligation thus keeping the DNA molecules linear until they are prepared for analysis. We can then use radiolabeling to easily track a certain section of a DNA through the various processes of DNA replicaton.

This has its uses in vector recombination and cloning genes. After restrictive enzymes cleave a plasmid we have to make sure that this circular DNA doesn't reconnect
and form the original circular DNA. So before we can actually insert our gene of interest to allow for its cloning, alkaline phosphatase can remove any phosphate group that might
be susceptible to attack by the other end of the DNA or even by an external nucleophile. It's also very valuable for its high rate of activity even in
harsh conditions. 

There are several main sources of alkaline phosphatase, these are: bacterial alkaline phosphatase(BAP), calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase(CIP), and shrimp alkaline phosphatase. Not to mention it is also present in human tissues and most concentrated at organs such as the kidneys and liver. BAP is the most active of all these enzymes but also is hard to get rid of after the dephosphorylation reaction. CIP is of great interest and is extracted from bovine intestine. It can easily be denatured and destroyed by protease digestion. It has been shown that CIP can be used as antiflammatory agents in human bodies and have been tested on mice.

Alkaline phosphtase must be monitored in the human body because it if the concentration goes too low or too high, health problems may arise. Elevated levels caused by factors that are still not completely clear can cause liver damage and bone disease. However, it is normal for levels to spike during puberty when bone growth is occurring rapidly. Lowered levels of alkaline phosphatase is characterized by different kinds of anemia and leukemia. Potmenopausal women are also more likely to have higher levels. 

ALP is associated with cell membranes and present in many tissues in animals and humans. ALP is connected to the membranes
by glycoproteins. When these are cleaved, phosphate groups are recycled throughout the cells and the amount of ALP levels
increases in the plasma. Glucocorticoids can significantly raise the amoutns of ALP present in the body while anticonvulsants secrete less
but still a significant amount. Glucocorticoids generate ALp in the C isomer while anticonvulsants generate ALP in an L isomer. Alkaline phosphtase is essential for the mineral deposition in teeth and bones, Bone can become weak and deficient if alkaline phosphatase
is not present, a disease called hypophosphatasia. ALP is nonspecific and mainly cleaves phosphate esters.

      <text xml:space="preserve">RecA can be found in E. Coli and it is needed in order to repair and maintain DNA.  A structural and functional homolog for Rec A can be found in every species and as a result, it is used as a method to exchange genetic information by homologous recombination through sexual reproduction. RecA has multiple functions, all of which are related to DNA repair. Its main function which has been most widely studied is that it facilitates DNA recombination in order to repair DNA double strand breaks.  The RecA protein can catalyze one directional branch migration. This function makes it possible to complete recombination. Bacterial strains such as E. Coli that are lacking RecA are useful for cloning procedures.

'''Endoplasmic Reticulum''' is an extensive membranous network in the eukaryotic cells that is continuous with the outer nuclear membrane and composed of ribosome-studded (rough) and ribosome-free (smooth regions.

The '''ER''' is responsible for the manufactures of the membranes and performs many other biosynethic functions.

The endoplasmic reticulum (also known as the ER) is made up of a wide system of membranes that make up over fifty percent of the total membrane in numerous eukaryotic cells, and consists of two sections that have different functions: the smooth endoplasmic reticulum and the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The endoplasmic reticulum consist of a system of membranous tubules and pouches called cisternae, which is held together by the cytoskeleton. The membrane segregates the inside section of the endoplasmic reticulum from the outside section (cytosol) . The internal section is called the lumen cavity, but is also known as the cisternal space. The name “endoplasmic” is defined as “within the cytoplasm,” and the Latin definition for the word “reticulum” is “little net.” The membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum is continuous throughout the nuclear envelope. Because of this, the area between the two membranes of the envelope is also continuous to the cisternal space.

The Endoplasmic Reticulum contains a quality control mechanism called chaperones.  These special proteins attach themselves to newly synthesized proteins and assist them in folding into their native conformations.  Charperones also keep mis-folded proteins in the ER to be broken down.  These incorrectly folded proteins are degraded through the process of ER Associated Degradation (ERAD).  These Chaperones can be affected by genetic diseases such as Cystic fibrosis.  Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disease that causes the buildup of chaperones and their incorrectly folded proteins in the ER.  This disease leads to mucus clogging the lungs and digestive track, which can lead to early death.

== The ER Under Stress ==
Under stress conditions, the normal function of the ER is impaired, causing the alteration of protein homoestasis and the corresponding accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER lumen. This condition is known as ''''ER stress''''. The aglomeration of misfolded and/or unfolded proteins, detonates a dynamic response process called ''''unfolded protein response' (UPR)''', which is the combination of several intracellular signaling pathways that have as a main purpose to reduce the load of misfolded proteins in order to re-establish protein homoestasis, adjusting to the current need in a dynamic fashion. In addition, the UPR carries out the transcriptional induction of genes expressing chaperones, ER-associated degradation (ERAD) components and autophagy regulators to the cytosol and the nucleus. If the upregulation of proteins involved in folding, quality control and trafficking is not enough to balance ER homoestasis, the UPR eliminates the damaged cell by apoptosis.

===UPR Sensors===
The UPR (mentioned above) is activated by three stress sensors, that detect the accumulation of misfolded or unfolded proteins in the ER. These sensors are:
*Inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α): It's a type I transmembrane protein with an N-terminal luminal region, a cytosolic kinase and RNase domains. Its activation has been explained by two different proposed models. The first one explains that immunoglobulin-binding protein (BiP), an ER-resident chaperone, inhibits oligomerization of IRE1α by binding to it. However, the aggregation of misfolded proteins causes BiP to dissociate from IRE1α, allowing it to interact with unfolded proteins and thus, to oligomerize. The second model affirms that unfolded proteins interact directly with IRE1α's luminal domain, inducing its oligomerization. These mechanisms are still under debate, although recent research data leads to the idea that both of them operate together in the regulation of IRE1α. The oligomerization process undergone by IRE1α leads to to trans-autophosphorylation of its kinase region which in turn engages its RNase activity. Activated IRE1α launches alternative splicing of the mRNA that encodes the transcription factor X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1), leading to the translation of a more stable spliced form of XBP1 (XBP1s), which in turn upregulates certain UPR-related genes associated with folding, ERAD and quality control.
*Protein kinase RNA-activated (PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK): It's a type I transmembrane protein that contains both a cytosolic kinase domain and an N-terminal luminal stress sensing domain. Its activation is carried out by similar mechanisms to those of IRE1α. Activated PERK contributes to reducing overload synthesis of proteins in the ER.
*Activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6): It's is a type II transmembrane protein, which under basal conditions associates with BiP. The accumulation of unfolded proteins initiates the dissociation of ATF6 from BiP, leading to the translocation of monomeric ATF6 to the Golgi and finally to the nucleus, where it upregulates the transcription of ER chaperones and ERAD-related genes.


=== Four Steps: Adaptation to Apoptosis ===
The activation of the '''UPR Sensors''' is followed by a '''Four Step''' process in which the cell first attempts to repair the stressed ER. If this fails the cell will set itself on a path to apoptosis. 
==== Step One ====
The '''First Step''' of the process attempts to decrease the amount of unfolded proteins on the ER. This is done by activating the previously introduced Protein kinase RNA-activated (PKR)-like ER kinase, or PERK. PERK directly decreases the amount of all protein synthesis in an effort to halt the production of proteins that are difficult to fold. Additionally Inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α) plays a role in this stage by initiating '''macroautophagy''', a process to destroy misfolded proteins to relieve stress on the ER.

==== Step Two ====
The '''Second Step''' consists of a focus on the increase in quality of proteins being produced and restoring homeostasis to the ER. This is accomplished by two methods in no particular order. First, transcription factors XBP1s, ATF6f, ATF4, AXP1s, and ATF6f collectively work to folding and degradation capacity by upregulating chaperone activity,protein modification enzymes and the size of both the ER and Golgi. The second part of this step is ATF4 upregulating genes that change the redox state of the ER to provide a better environment for the folding of proteins. Both of these steps work to reduce the amount of misfolding proteins and increasing the precision with which new protiens are constructed to avoid producing more misfolded and unfolded proteins.

==== Step Three ====
The '''Third Step''' begins to transition the cell to a state where apoptosis is more likely. This step has two contributing factors, both influenced by a protein called C/EBP homologous protein or CHOP. CHOP, acting downstream of AFT4 changes the redox state of the entire cell so that the cell is out of its natural state and therefore has trouble functioning. Additionally, again after attempts to slow protein synthesis, CHOP increases the protein synthesis of the cell further stressing it. Both of these factors will sensitize the cell to apoptosis. 

==== Step Four ====
The '''Fourth Step''' is the apoptosis of the cell. When ER stress results in apoptosis, the BCL2 protein family acts to bring the cell to apoptosis; all pro-apoptotic members of this family contain BH1, BH2, and BH3. Specifically, BH3 acts to trigger the activation of BAX and BAK. These then permeablilize the membrane of the cells mitrochonira and release cytochrome c and apoptosome. This moves the cell into a stage of apoptosis.

=== ER Stress and Illness ===
When discussing ER stress and human disease, it is important to recognize that nearly all data that suggests a linkage between ER stress is either correlative or based on ''in vitro'' evidence. Correlative evidence is flawed as it is unwise to assume that correlation always implies causation, and ''in vitro'' data is flawed as it is an isolated study rather than a comprehensive view of the organism in question. 
====Tumors and Cancer====
Tumors often cause hypoxia in the tissues they affect. When this occurs, the ER begins a stress response to adapt to the new conditions. Under normal conditions the efforts of the ER stress response would be beneficial to the body, however, the result of the adaptation is that the tumorous cells are allowed to replicate, driving tumor growth rather than the death that would have occurred had ER stress not took place. Scientists believe that the IRE1α-XBP1 pathway involved in this process is a promising target for cancer treatment. 
====Diabetes====
When glucose levels become excessive, an ER stress response is initiated. This response is thought to suppress insulin gene expression via IRE1α degradation of insulin mRNA. This downregulation of insulin is characteristic in type two diabetes.

&lt;br/&gt;
The article &quot;Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress and Type 2 Diabetes&quot; by Sung Hoon Back and Randal J. Kaufman, they discuss how, due to certain lifestyles now, type 2 diabetes has vastly increased over the years.  Type 2 diabetes is &quot;characterized by increased levels of blood glucose owing to insulin resistance in adipose tissue, muscle, and liver and/or to impaired insulin secretion from pancreatic [beta]-cells.&quot;  They discuss how beta-cells increase in response to obesity and insulin resistance, but it doesn't last forever and normally begins to fail.  It is possible that beta-cell loss could be due to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Pancreatic beta-cells secrete insulin, which is a &quot;blood glucose-lowering hormone.&quot;  Proinsulin is synthesized in the ER and then stored in beta-cells until glucose levels increase and then insulin is released.  The ER is in charge of many things and requires a certain environment, so when the environment changes, there are several stress responses that occur to try to keep the ER functioning properly.  The main stress response is called the unfolded protein response (UPR).  UPR includes &quot;expansion of ER size, enhanced folding capacity, reduced protein synthesis through transcriptional and translational controls, and increased clearance of unfolded or misfolded proteins.&quot;  IF this does not work and the ER does not return to homeostasis, then cell death is normally activated.  It is believed that the ER sends signals for apoptosis is the stress is severe and unresolved by UPR.  IRE1α can also mediate cell death pathways. ER stress can increase activation of IRE1α which leads to increased splicing of genes leading to cellular dysfunction and beta-cell death.

====Neurodegenerative Diseases====
Correlative evidence shows that ER stress markers are present in deceased persons that suffered from Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, ALS, Huntington's, and Creutzfedt-Jabob disease. Scientists recognize however, that the role of ER response will be neurodegenerative diseases will be very difficult to determine. 
====Final Remarks====
The detailed study of persistent ER stress and the UPR is essential for the complete understanding of certain diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases (including AAlzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) and inflammation-related diseases. What such diseases have in common is the accumulation of abnormal intracellular and/or extracellular protein aggregations and inclusions. Therefore, by the meticulous study of the enzymatic pathways followed by the UPR stress sensors, new pharmachological interventions could be developed for the mentioned illnesses.

==Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum (RER)==
[[Image:ER NIH.jpg‎|thumb]]
The description of '''endoplasmic reticulum (ER)''' being &quot;rough&quot; comes from the organelle being studded with ribosomes. These ribosomes on the '''rough ER''', are used to synthesize proteins which are destined to either be inserted into the membrane of the cell or transported out of the cell. Differences between ribosomes lying on the ER and those lying in the cytosol stem mainly from the destination the protein that is synthesized by the ribosome. With protein synthesis via ER ribosomes, proteins are synthesized as they normally would through translation of mRNA. After the protein is synthesized, called &quot;posttranslation&quot;, it then enters the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, the inner compartment of the organelle. Although the secondary structure (i.e. beta sheets and alpha helixes) of the newly-synthesized peptide forms almost instantaneously as it is translated,its tertiary structure does not begin to form until it is in the lumen, where it will begin to fold into its specific 3-D conformation with the aid of chaperone proteins [1]. It is inside the lumen of the '''rough endoplasmic reticulum''' that N- and O- linked glycosidic bonds are formed between amino acids and sugars, thus this process is called &quot;[[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Protein Glycosylation|glycosylation]]&quot; and the newly formed protein is called &quot;[[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Protein Glycosylation|glycoprotein]]&quot;.

==Vesicle Transport==

The endoplasmic reticulum transports the proteins through the use of vesicles. Vesicles are membrane enclosed packages that contain protein. On the surface of the vesicles, there are coating proteins called COPI and COPII. The protein COPII allows the vesicles to be sent the Golgi and the COPII protein allow the vesicles to come back to the Rough ER. From inside the Golgi, proteins are again packaged into vesicles and transported to the cell membrane. Once at the membrane, the vesicle itself merges with and become part of the membrane as it is composed of the same lipid bi-layer. Its protein content either will remain on the membrane if it is to function as a membrane protein or be secreted outside of the cell [1].

==Smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum (SER)==

The '''smooth endoplasmic reticulum''', unlike its &quot;rough&quot; counterpart, does not package protein. Instead it carries out various metabolic reactions within the confines of its membrane. Functions range from carbohydrate metabolism, lipid synthesis, and even drug detoxification.  Drug detoxification is usually accomplished by adding hydroxyl groups to drug molecules.  This makes them more soluble in water and therefore easier to be flushed from the body.  Another important function of the '''smooth endoplasmic reticulum''' is the storage of calcium ions. This is imperative for muscle contraction.  When a muscle cell is stimulated by a nerve impulse, the calcium ions rush into the cytosol and trigger muscle contraction.

Structurally the '''smooth ER''' is not continuous with the cell's nuclear envelope.  The smooth ER is involved in phospholipid synthesis.

==Interesting Facts about the Endoplasmic Reticulum==

1. Proteins are folded and modified in this organelle of the cell.

2. The internal volume of lumen in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is almost equal to the outside of the cell. This supports the idea that the ER evolved from the cellular membrane.

3.The ER contains an environment that is distinctly different from that of the cytosol in terms of solute and protein composition. This is because this environment is conducive to the ER’s role as a “staging post”; proteins stop at the this organelle to be packaged and modified before exiting the cell. The ER is also used as a checkpoint before the proteins are secreted, checking the protein quality and accuracy in terms of folding and modification before the protein is allowed to exit the cell.

4. How proteins are folded and modified within the ER:
When a protein first enters the ER, it is recognized by a signal sequence typically found at the N terminus of the protein. This sequence is recognized by a receptor located on the surface of the ER membrane called signal recognition particular (SPR). The molecule is then direted towards a pore, called the Sec61 translocon, in the membrane of the ER where it is allowed to pass through and into the ER. One interesting fact about protein folding is that when some proteins are passed through the ER, before entering the ER lumen, they are mere polypeptide chains. The folding of the protein actually sometimes happens entirely within the ER lumen! It is therefore important to note that when the polypeptide sequence enters the lumen of the ER and are subject to the modifications of the sidechains of its amino acids, this can alter the way the protein would fold. Thus, these modifications influence folding, and folding sometimes also influences modifications too.  There are some exceptions to this, such as transmembrane proteins that have large cytosolic domains. These proteins fold within the lumen and within the cytosol of the cell. Once the protein is fully translocated into the ER lumen, it was finish the folding and modification that it needs. If the protein is part of a multisubunit complex, then the ER will assemble the protein into its native oligomeric structure. Modifications catalyzed by enzymes in the lumen of the ER greatly aid the maturation of the protein and bring it closer to its final desired outcome. Once this is complete, the finished protein is then put into a transport vesicle, which buds off from the ER and continues on its journey to either the golgi apparatus or for secretion. Some proteins, which do not end up being modified correctly can be consequently targeted for destruction and may leave the ER to be degraded by enzymes in the cytosol.

5. The UPR (mentioned above) is activated by three stress sensors, that detect the accumulation of misfolded or unfolded proteins in the ER. These sensors are:
*Inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α): It's a type I transmembrane protein with an N-terminal luminal region, a cytosolic kinase and RNase domains. Its activation has been explained by two different proposed models. The first one explains that immunoglobulin-binding protein (BiP), an ER-resident chaperone, inhibits oligomerization of IRE1α by binding to it. However, the aggregation of misfolded proteins causes BiP to dissociate from IRE1α, allowing it to interact with unfolded proteins and thus, to oligomerize. The second model affirms that unfolded proteins interact directly with IRE1α's luminal domain, inducing its oligomerization. These mechanisms are still under debate, although recent research data leads to the idea that both of them operate together in the regulation of IRE1α. The oligomerization process undergone by IRE1α leads to to trans-autophosphorylation of its kinase region which in turn engages its RNase activity. Activated IRE1α launches alternative splicing of the mRNA that encodes the transcription factor X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1), leading to the translation of a more stable spliced form of XBP1 (XBP1s), which in turn upregulates certain UPR-related genes associated with folding, ERAD and quality control.
*Protein kinase RNA-activated (PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK): It's a type I transmembrane protein that contains both a cytosolic kinase domain and an N-terminal luminal stress sensing domain. Its activation is carried out by similar mechanisms to those of IRE1α. Activated PERK contributes to reducing overload synthesis of proteins in the ER.
*Activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6): It's is a type II transmembrane protein, which under basal conditions associates with BiP. The accumulation of unfolded proteins initiates the dissociation of ATF6 from BiP, leading to the translocation of monomeric ATF6 to the Golgi and finally to the nucleus, where it upregulates the transcription of ER chaperones and ERAD-related genes.

==Overview==
The purpose of the ribosome is to translate messenger RNA ([[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid/RNA/Messenger RNA (mRNA)|mRNA]]) to proteins with the aid of [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid/RNA/Transfer RNA (tRNA)|tRNA]]. In eukaryotes, ribosomes can commonly be found in the cytosol of a cell, the endoplasmic reticulum or [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid/RNA/Messenger RNA (mRNA)|mRNA]], as well as the matrix of the [[Structural Biochemistry/Cell Organelles/Mitochondria|mitochondria]]. [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins|Proteins]] synthesized in each of these locations serve a different role in the cell. In prokaryotes ribosomes can be found in the cytosol as well. This protein-synthesizing organelle is the only organelle found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, asserting that the ribosome was a trait that evolved early on, most likely present in the common ancestor of eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Ribosomes are not [[Structural Biochemistry/Lipids/Biological Membranes|membrane]] bound.

Ribosomes are also play a key role in the catalysis of two important and crucial biological processes. They are responsible for peptidyl transfer, in which they form peptide bonds during protein synthesis as well as peptidyl hydrolysis; in this process, the ribosome releases the completely formed protein from the peptidyl transfer RNA after completion of translation. Translation is the process of converting mRNA (from transcription) to functional proteins; The three steps involved are initiation, elongation, and termination. Proteins are translated one amino acid (three base pairs) at a time. During this process, tRNA assists the ribosome by bringing the complementary bases to the ribosome as translation proceeds.

Because ribosome synthesis is a major metabolic activity that involves hundreds of individual reactions in eukaryotes, errors will occur eventually during these processes. To deal with the error in ribosome synthesis if it occurs, eukaryotes will degrade the erroreous ribosomes. In addition, not only the erroneous ribosomes will be degraded but also the excess ribosomes. Recent researches show that eukaryote cells enhanced many strategies to recognize specific dysfunctional or functionally deficit ribosomes for degradation&lt;ref&gt;Lafontaine, Denis. &quot;Elsevier: Article Locator.&quot; ScienceDirect.com | Search through over 10 million science, health, medical journal full text articles and books.. N.p., n.d. Web. 20 Nov. 2012. &lt;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096800040900245X&gt;. &lt;/ref&gt;.

==Translation: Eukaryotic and Bacterial==
Along with having more complicated assembly regulations than bacterial ribosomes, eukaryotic ribosomes are triggered differently then bacterial ribosomes in translation initiation. Eukaryotic ribosomes use a scanning mechanism and require at least nine initiation factors.
&lt;ref&gt;Sebastian Klinge, Felix Voigts-Hoffmann, Marc Leibundgut and Nenad Ban. &quot;Atomic structures of the eukaryotic ribosome.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;
In bacteria, ribosomes can identify the right reading frame and know where to attach to a mRNA stran, by finding the Shine Dalgarno sequence on the mRNA. This ribosome binding site is upstream from the AUG start codon on the mRNA. In the bacterium E. Coli, the Shine Dalgarno site is a purine-rich nucleotide sequence—5’ AGGAGGU 3’, on the mRNA that is located four to eight bases ahead of the start codon. This Shine-Dalgarno sequence is complementary to the sequence 5’ ACCUCCU 3’ on the 16S rRNA, which is found in the 30S subunit of the ribosome.

==Structure==
Ribosomes usually comprise 2 protein subunits and some component of [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid/RNA/Ribosomal RNA (rRNA)|rRNA]]. The [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins|protein]] componenet of the ribosomes is first synthesized in the cytosol much like any other protein. The newly synthesized protein subunits are then transported from the nucleus into the nucleolus, the center of ribosomal RNA transcription. [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid/RNA/RNA Polymerase|RNA polymerase]] are then used to polymerize the rRNA needed for the synthesis of the ribosome. Cells that have a high rate of protein synthesis have many ribosomes.

In the past, scientists studied ribosome to get a better understanding about its components, which is consists of 30S, 50S, 70S, and 100S. All are made of by the same particles but different concentration of Mg ions. 30S and 50S are small and large subunits of 70S while 100S is a collection of 70S. 
Ribosomal structure varies between eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Eukaryotes have 40S (small) and 60S (large) subunits, together the subunits form the 80S ribosome.&lt;ref&gt;Sebastian Klinge, Felix Voigts-Hoffmann, Marc Leibundgut and Nenad Ban. &quot;Atomic structures of the eukaryotic ribosome.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Prokarytoes have 30S (small) and 50S (large) subunits. These subunits work together during translation to synthesize proteins.

[[Image:Ribosome_shape.png |thumb|EColi 70S Ribosome. The red is the 50S large subunit and the blue is the 30S small subunit]]

In prokaryotes, the small subunit (30S) and the large subunit (50S) together make the 70S ribosome. The 30S subunit is composed of 21 ribosomal proteins and 16S rRNA. Its function is to decode and decipher mRNA to determine the corresponding amino acid to the three bases in codons. The small subunit consists of the body (5’), the platform region (central domain), and the head (3’). Each component can be formed separately of each other. The small subunit also contains a 3’-minor domain consisting of the last two helices (44 and 45) and the end of the 3’ end of the rRNA. The structural components of the small subunit have been shown to be structurally independent from each other suggesting that during protein synthesis they move and conform relative to one another. The long 44 helix stretches across the small subunit from the body to the head functioning as a potential relay for information across the entire subunit. Unlike the small subunit, the large subunit is mostly rigid with mobility restricted its peripheral regions. The 50S subunit consists of 33 proteins and the 23S and 5S rRNA.

The mRNA binding site is located along the neck of the small subunit while the large subunit contains the peptidyl transferase center (PTC) where aminoacyl and peptidyl-tRNA attach. The three binding sites are A, P, and E. Binding site A attracts aminoacyl-tRNA, binding site P attracts peptidyl-tRNA, and binding site E, the exit site, attracts deacylated tRNA. The anticodon stem loop is attached to its complementary codon on the mRNA binding site of the small subunit while the amino acid end of the tRNA attaches to A and P sites both located in the PTC.  The GTPase-associated center and the sarcin/ricin loop are located on the large subunit and help to stimulate GTP hydrolysis needed for elongation of the protein.

Ribosome assembly consists of transcription, translation, the folding of rRNA and ribosomal proteins, the binding of ribosomal proteins, and the binding and release of the assembly components to make the ribosome. There are two intermediates in ribosome assembly, in vitro and in vivo. One method of in vitro assembly of the 30S is to only use free rRNA and ribosomal proteins. Another is to combine 16S rRNA with purified and recombinant proteins and precursor 16S rRNA. With the different ways to assemble proteins, the assembly of ribosomes also varies with different temperatures. At low temperature of 0°C -15°C, the reconstitution intermediate (RI) particle, composed of 16S rRNA and 15 ribosomal proteins, is formed and settled to 21S-22S. Then the RI particle is rearranged after getting heated to 40°C and settled to 25S-26S. After completing these two processes, the RI particle together with the remaining proteins can form the 30S subunit. 

In contrast, the in vitro assembly of the 50S subunit requires more steps and harsher conditions compared to the assembly mechanism of the 30S. There are three reconstitution intermediates each dependent on different temperatures and ionic conditions. RI50 (1), the first intermediate, yields the 33S particle. As RI50 (1) is heated, RI50 (2) forms and sediments at the 41S-43S. The remaining proteins form the RI50 (3) which create the inactive 48S particle. In order for the 48S particle to become the active 50S subunit, the temperature and concentration of magnesium needs to be increased along with the involvement of the 5S rRNA.

[[Image:Ribosomal_assembly_mechanisms.jpg |thumb|In Vitro and In Vivo Ribosomal Assembly Mechanisms]]

Like the in vitro assembly mechanism, the in vivo assembly of the 30S subunit has two intermediates (p130S and p230S) and the 50S subunit has three intermediates (p150S, p250S, and p350S). However, the reconstitution intermediates are not the same as in vitro. The intermediates of the 30S subunit yield 21S and 30S particles while the intermediates of the 50S subunit yield 32S, 43S, and 50S particles. The intermediates in the in vivo assembly are precursor rRNA which is different from in vitro which uses matured rRNA. To complete the mechanism of ribosome assembly, these precursor rRNA gets transformed in the polysomes.

===Ekaryotic Ribsome===
A eukaryotic ribosome is composed of a 40S and 60S subunits, they both have a solvent exposed side and a subunit interface. The solvent exposed side contains a higher concentration of protein and RNA elements that are only in eukaryotes compared to the subunit interface. 

The eukaryotic specific proteins are responsible for 40S structure being stabilized by tertiary contacts. The majority of the eukaryotic specific proteins and extensions are to interconnect other proteins in the 40S and 60S subunit. The 40S subunit has 14 of these interconnected proteins located in the head. eukaryotic specific proteins and extensions play a bigger role in 60S subunits because their protein mediated connections are more extensive and reach across the subunit. The 60S specific extensions consist of beta sheets and long alpha helices which are crucial in long distance tertierary interaction, meaning they have the ability to interact across the subunit. This trait is unique for eukaryotes because protein-protein contact is very rare in the prokaryote ribosome.

The 40S and 60S subunits are joined by eukaryote specific inter-subunit bridges that connects them thus forming 80s. This is done by eukaryotic specific bridges forming at the 40S and the RPL19 interacts with ES6E and RPL24 intracts with rpS6. The other two eukaryotic specific bridges connect by 60S segment ES31 that connects to rpSA and another 60S segment, ES41 that connects with rp58 from the 40S subunit. &lt;ref&gt;Sebastian Klinge, Felix Voigts-Hoffmann, Marc Leibundgut and Nenad Ban. &quot;Atomic structures of the eukaryotic ribosome.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ribosomal Cofactors==
Ribosomal cofactors help facilitate with improper folding during in vitro. The improper folding during in vitro is a cause which results in vitro being much slower than in vivo. Ribosomal factors can be used as a “check point” to make sure the assembly is correct. Examples of ribosomal cofactors are DEAD-box proteins, chaperones, and GTPases. DEAD-box proteins are factors which help with proper folding of the RNA. An over expression of DEAD-box proteins can suppress the deletion of another strain. DEAD-box proteins (DBPs) are characterized by a core of approximately 350 amino acids, each containing at least 9 conserved amino acid motifs. Studies have shown that these proteins use the energy from ATP hydrolysis to rearrange inter- or intra-molecular RNA structures or dissociate RNA-proteins interactions. In eukaryotes, DEAD-box proteins are fundamental in the life of a ribosome, but in E. coli, they are often unnecessary. To date, five different genes encoding DEAD-box proteins have been identified in E.coli –  SrmB, CsdA, DbpA, RhlE, and RhIB – which are versatile cofactors that have helped further the understanding of cellular processes in many cells because of their roles in protein biosynthesis and ribosome assembly. For instance, CsdA and SrmB are essential for proper cellular growth; cells deficient in these proteins exhibit severe ribosomal effects.

==Brief History==
Ribosomes played a big role in our evolution. The origin of ribosomes are said to have roots in the RNA world, preceding the existence of proteins. Ribosomes evolved in structure and function, alongside the formation of complex and versatile peptides. A huge breakthrough in the scientific study of ribosomes began when Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and his group determined the crystal structure of the ribosome, and described it in atomic detail. Uncovering the structure of the ribosome allowed scientists a closer look at the mechanisms involved with ribosome function. More specifically for example, according to &quot;The ribosome goes Nobel&quot; article by Rodnina and Wintermeyer, in the &quot;Trends in Biochemical Sciences&quot; journal, knowledge of the structure of the ribosome revealed details of the translation process like &quot;how the ribosome checks for proper codon–anticodon interaction by establishing specific contacts in the decoding site&quot;. More recently, ribosomes prove to have huge clinical potential as targets for antibiotic products. With the overuse of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance constantly on the rise, ribosomes could be the basis of new antimicrobials that would retaliate against the infamous antibiotic resistance. 

==Free Ribosomes==
Ribosomes found in the cytosol that are not bound to any other organelle are known as free ribosomes. These ribosomes are known to produce non-hydrophobic proteins that ultimately function in the cytosol.  An example would be the catalysts for the first steps of sugar breakdown.

==Endoplasmic Reticulum Ribosomes==
Ribosomes which are attached to the endoplasmic reticulum or [[Structural Biochemistry/Cell Organelles/Endoplasmic Reticulum|ER]]are known as ER Ribosomes. These ribosomes are what give rough endoplasmic reticulum its &quot;rough&quot; appearance. Proteins that are produced from the ribosomes of the rough ER are sent through the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, modified within the ER, and then is exported in a vesicle to the cis face of the golgi apparatus, where the protein undergoes further modification.

==The Peptidyl-Transfer Reaction Catalyzed by the Ribosome==

[[File:Peptidyl Transfer.jpg|thumb|The mechanism of peptidyl transfer catalysis ]]

Enzymes transform their substrates through the active site residues. This transformation can allow for the direct participation in chemical catalysis, such as facilitation of proton transfer reactions and covalent chemistry. These active-site residues can form the covalent bond acting as general acid-base or as nucleophiles. The ribosomes undergo general acid-base or nucleophilic catalysis. The residues can also be structural complement to the transition state (TS), dissolve or reorganize water molecules, and decrease the delta S (entropy) by using the binding energy. 
In the elongation process, the ribosome PTC catalyzes the aminolysis of the ester bond: the alpha amino group of the A-site aminoacul tRNA acts as nucleophile and attacks the P-site peptidyl tRNA at the carbonyl carbon of the ester bond that connects the tRNA and the peptide. In order to efficiently form peptide bonds amines react with esters. This reaction is fast with the help of the ribosome because it makes the reaction rate increase by approximately 106 - 107 folds. Before the peptide bond is formed, the aminoacyl tRNA connects to the A site at a rate of 10 s-1 which is much slower than the rate of the tertiary complex forming a peptide bond. The slow rate of reaction allows for the minimal use of substrate analog which is short RNA fragments that is similar to the tRNA CCA 3’ end or the alpha amine substituted with a hydroxyl group. The minimal substrates consisted of puromycin (Pmn), C-puromycin (C-Pmn), and CC-puromycin (CC-Pmn). These substrates bind to the ribosome fast to react with the P-site substrate in order to allow for the direct analysis of their chemistry relationship. 
Recently, methods of analysis using kinetic, biochemical, genetic, and computation allow for more progress in ribosome crystallography. However, there are still many questions regarding the proton transfer mechanism. Peptidyl transfer by the ribosome accompanies a decrease in the entropy activation, which provides more understanding of ribosome catalysis involves defining the molecular mechanism that make entropy of activation lower by taking into consideration the substrate, position of the active site, desolvation, and electrostatic shielding.

==Degradation of erroneous and excess ribosomes in eukaryotes==

When cells are in stress, disease condition, and normal condition, RNA damage occurs. Exposing to ultraviolet light, oxidation, chlorination, nitration and alkylation result in chemical modifications to nucleobases, generating the potential of triggering ribosome degradation pathways.

===Types of error in ribosomes synthesis===

There are several sources of errors in ribosome synthesis such as the alternation in rRNA sequences (occur in cis) and the failure to bind to or loss of an assembly factor or ribosomal protein (occur in trans). Beside these main sources, specific growth conditions can also cause certain effects in ribosome synthesis. For example, starvation requires excess ribosomes which are turned over efficiently&lt;ref&gt;Lafontaine, Denis. &quot;Elsevier: Article Locator.&quot; ScienceDirect.com | Search through over 10 million science, health, medical journal full text articles and books.. N.p., n.d. Web. 20 Nov. 2012. &lt;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096800040900245X&gt;. &lt;/ref&gt;.

===Potential error-occurring process in Ribosome synthesis===

mRNA decoding and peptidyl-transfer reaction are two subunites that have specialized function in ribosome translation&lt;ref&gt; Steitz, T.A. (2008) A structural understanding of the dynamic ribosome machine. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 9, 242–253&lt;/ref&gt;. Each eukaryote ribosome is composed of 4 rRNAs and ~80 ribosomal proteins. The processes of synthesizing, maturizing, transporting individual ribosomes and assembling into ribosomal subunits requires the contribution of ~200 proteins trans-acting cofactors and a large amount of small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs). These processes engage in hundreds of individual error-causing reactions&lt;ref&gt;Henras, A.K. et al. (2008) The post-transcriptional steps of eukaryotic ribosome biogenesis. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 65, 2334–2359&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Strunk, B.S. and Karbstein, K. (2009) Powering through ribosome assembly. RNA 15, 2083–2104&lt;/ref&gt;.In addition, many ribosomal proteins also perform non-ribosomal functions, so the functions in these processes which are not directly connected to ribosome biogenesis are currently being assigned to ribosome synthesis factors (RSFs). RSFs include connections to cell cycle progression, pre-mRNA splicing, DNA damage response, nuclear organizing and telomere maintanance. Due to the large number of reactions that occur in ribosome assembling pathway, the possibility of  error occurring is very high such as the potential harms for cell viability and human health. For example, inability to bind correctly to or loss of a synthesis factor can cause the production of erroneous ribosomes such as lacking part of ribosomal proteins or carrying misfolded rRNA which will affect on translation. As a result, cells develop control mechanism to avoid such problems. For example,  instead of participating in later steps, synthetic factors that involved in late cytoplasmic ribosome assembly steps can first bind with pre-rRNAs at ealy stages, bringing pre-ribosomes to productive synthesis pathways&lt;ref&gt; Lafontaine, D. et al.  (1995) The 18S rRNA dimethylase Dim1p is required for pre-ribosomal RNA processing in yeast. Genes Dev. 9, 2470–2481&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Mutation in cis: non-funtional ribosomal RNA decay===

There are many pathways that have been known to control the structural integrity of mature RNA molecules&lt;ref&gt;Doma, M.K. and Parker, R. (2007) RNA quality control in eukaryotes. Cell 131, 660–668&lt;/ref&gt;. One of the pathways that control the decay of mRNAs is the &quot;no-go&quot; decay (NGD), which the mRNAs that cause the degradation of specific ribosomes&lt;ref&gt;Doma, M.K. and Parker, R. (2006) Endonucleolytic cleavage of eukaryotic mRNAs with stalls in translation elongation. Nature 440, 561–564&lt;/ref&gt;.
LaRivie`re et al. introduced the way to test whether or not mutations in functional and non-functional ribosomal sites affect rRNA stability which is performing substitutions in the decoding site and peptidyl transferase centre at the position that are essential for ribosomal function in bacteria. This experiment gave result in the identification of non-functional rRNA decay, a pathway that detects and eliminates dysfunctional parts of mature ribosomes&lt;ref&gt;LaRiviere, F.J. et al. (2006) A late-acting quality control process for mature eukaryotic rRNAs. Mol. Cell 24, 619–626&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Mutations in ''trans'': The TRAMP-exosome pathway and nucleolar surveillance===

Aberrant nucleolar and nulear pre-rRNAs are found to be degraded actively by a nuclear surveillance mechanism that involves the addition of unstructured oligoadenylate tails at the 3’-end of flawed pre-rRNAs. This is done with the TRAMP complexes’ polymerase activity, and after with their degradation by the RNA exosome. TRAMP conplexes consist of a poly(A) polymerase, a zonc-knuckle-containing and putative RNA-binding protein, and the DEVH helicase Mtr4. The pathway goes from having the addition of short poly(A) tails with the actual binding between TRAMP complex and RNA, and these two commit deviated molecules to degradation. This is done by separating them from the normal RNA and by stirring exosomal activity&lt;ref&gt;Lafontaine, Denis. &quot;Elsevier: Article Locator.&quot; ScienceDirect.com | Search through over 10 million science, health, medical journal full text articles and books.. N.p., n.d. Web. 20 Nov. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;.

===The decay of bulk ribosome and pre-ribosome by ribophagy and PMN===

Growth-inhibiting conditions cause ribosome synthesis to shut down. The synthesis of complex molecules from simple molecules such as amino acids and sugars is obstructed and existing pre-ribosomes and mature ribosomes are directed towards bulk degradative pathways. To manage stress, and to adapt to a new environment, pre-ribosomes and mature ribosomes are passed on to be recycled for important cellular components. Ubiquitin, a small regulatory protein essential to 25S NRD (Nonfunctional RRNA Decay), is also responsible for bulk ribosome degradation.&lt;ref&gt;Lafontaine, Denis L.J. &quot;A ‘garbage Can’ for Ribosomes: How Eukaryotes Degrade Their Ribosomes.&quot; Trends in Biochemical Sciences 35.5 (2010): 267-77.&lt;/ref&gt;

Autophagy is a catabolic mechanism that takes unnecessary or dysfunctional cellular components and performs cellular degradation through the lysosome, or the vacuole in yeast and plants.&lt;ref&gt;Lin NY, Beyer C, Gießl A, et al. (September 2012). &quot;Autophagy regulates TNFα-mediated joint destruction in experimental arthritis&quot;. Ann. Rheum. Dis.. doi:10.1136/annrheumdis-2012-201671. PMID 22975756&lt;/ref&gt; Starvation conditions cause large portions of the cytosol, along with protein, to assemble and whole organelles, such as ribosomes and mitochondria, are recycled through two major types of autophagy: microautophagy and macroautophagy. Macroautophagy involves the development of a double membrane around the organelle, this together known as an autophagosome. &lt;ref&gt;Česen MH, Pegan K, Spes A, Turk B (July 2012). &quot;Lysosomal pathways to cell death and their therapeutic applications&quot;. Exp. Cell Res. 318 (11): 1245–51. doi:10.1016/j.yexcr.2012.03.005. PMID 22465226.&lt;/ref&gt; This isolates the organelle and delivers it to the lysosome, which engulfs the organelle through endocytosis for its breakdown and recycling. &lt;ref&gt;Mizushima N, Ohsumi Y, Yoshimori T (December 2002). &quot;Autophagosome formation in mammalian cells&quot;. Cell Struct. Funct. 27 (6): 421–9. PMID 12576635.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, during microautophagy, the lysosome directly engulfs the cytoplasmic material, through the inward folding of the lysosomal membrane. &lt;ref&gt;Česen MH, Pegan K, Spes A, Turk B (July 2012). &quot;Lysosomal pathways to cell death and their therapeutic applications&quot;. Exp. Cell Res. 318 (11): 1245–51. doi:10.1016/j.yexcr.2012.03.005. PMID 22465226.&lt;/ref&gt; Because lysosomes and vacuoles contain non-specific enzymes for hydrolysis, autophagy can essentially degrade any biomolecule. Macroautophagy and microautophagy are both crucial to a cell's survival during starvation. Both mechanisms associate common ''trans''-acting factors, and both are essentially bulk degradative processes. However, studies show that selective types of both channels exist. &lt;ref&gt;Lafontaine, Denis L.J. &quot;A ‘garbage Can’ for Ribosomes: How Eukaryotes Degrade Their Ribosomes.&quot; Trends in Biochemical Sciences 35.5 (2010): 267-77.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ribophagy is the process in yeasts in which both small and large ribosomal subunits are are delivered to the vacuole through selective macroautophagy. This process is caused by prolonged nitrogen starvation and specific only to ribosomal subunits. &lt;ref&gt;Kraft, Claudine, Anna Deplazes, Marc Sohrmann, and Matthias Peter. &quot;Mature Ribosomes Are Selectively Degraded upon Starvation by an Autophagy Pathway Requiring the Ubp3p/Bre5p Ubiquitin Protease.&quot; Nature Cell Biology 10.5 (2008): 602-10.&lt;/ref&gt; Small and large ribosomal subunit ribophagy depends on different and distinct pathways. The increased turnover kinetics of large subunits are dependent upon the Ubp3 ubiquitin protease and its activator Bre5. Increased turnover rates of small subunit are scantly affected when mutations arise in UBE3 or BRE5, indicating independent pathways of ribophagy. However, for small ribosomal subunit ribophagy, the effector remains unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Lafontaine, Denis L.J. &quot;A ‘garbage Can’ for Ribosomes: How Eukaryotes Degrade Their Ribosomes.&quot; Trends in Biochemical Sciences 35.5 (2010): 267-77.&lt;/ref&gt; As Upb3 deubiquitylation necessary for 60S ribophagy, cells deficient of Upb3 have an increased ubiquitylation level of many ribosome-associated proteins which have yet to be identified. It is believed that the deubiquitylation of Upb3-Bre5 targets aids autophagosomes with the packing of ribosomes, or allows the maturation of autophagosomes and/or its merging with the vacuole. &lt;ref&gt;Kraft, Claudine, Anna Deplazes, Marc Sohrmann, and Matthias Peter. &quot;Mature Ribosomes Are Selectively Degraded upon Starvation by an Autophagy Pathway Requiring the Ubp3p/Bre5p Ubiquitin Protease.&quot; Nature Cell Biology 10.5 (2008): 602-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ribosome surveillance in human health===

Alterations in RNA can cause ribosome degradation, some of which can lead to serious diseases. RNA damage are not only results of stress and disease situations, as they occur during normal cell growth as well. Exposure to ultraviolet light, chlorination, oxidation, alkylation and nitration can all result in the introduction of chemical modifications to nucleobases, as well as RNA-RNA and RNA-protein crosslinks, into RNA and RNPs. &lt;ref&gt;Wurtmann, Elisabeth J., and Sandra L. Wolin. &quot;RNA under Attack: Cellular Handling of RNA Damage.&quot; Critical Reviews in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology 44.1 (2009): 34-49.&lt;/ref&gt; Many believe that RNA oxidation could be associated with disease progression, and that many factors, including the extent of association with proteins or iron, may be causes to leaving RNA susceptible to oxidative damage. Some cases of ribosomal RNA damage inflicted by UV radiation and oxidation have lead to human neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and atherosclerotic plaques. &lt;ref&gt;Nunomura, Akihiko, Tim Hofer, Paula I. Moreira, Rudy J. Castellani, Mark A. Smith, and George Perry. &quot;RNA Oxidation in Alzheimer Disease and Related Neurodegenerative Disorders.&quot; Acta Neuropathologica 118.1 (2009): 151-66. &lt;/ref&gt; Reactive oxygen species (ROS) is developed by chronological aging, oxidative stress and other apoptotic stimuli. Yeast cells that are exposed to high levels of ROS fragment Mature 5.8S and 25S rRNA considerably. &lt;ref&gt;Mroczek, S., and J. Kufel. &quot;Apoptotic Signals Induce Specific Degradation of Ribosomal RNA in Yeast.&quot; Nucleic Acids Research 36.9 (2008): 2874-888.&lt;/ref&gt; Yeast cells that are given anti-metabolites and the chemotherapeutic agent 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) accrue polyadenylated pre-rRNAs. In exosome complexes that are hypersensitive to the drug, these accumulations are distressed, proposing that nucleolar surveillance is what is responsible for the degradation of 5-FU. Many nucleolar stresses, such as drug-based interference of pre-RNA processing and rRNA synthesis, have lead to nucleolar breakdown, p53 stabilization and cell cycle advancement defects and/or apoptosis. &lt;ref&gt;Lafontaine, Denis L.J. &quot;A ‘garbage Can’ for Ribosomes: How Eukaryotes Degrade Their Ribosomes.&quot; Trends in Biochemical Sciences 35.5 (2010): 267-77.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ribosomal Functional Specialization==
In the core of every ribosome, which is the protein factory, there are ribosomal proteins.  Recent research indicates that these core proteins can differ between ribosomes under different growth conditions and that these differences confer the ability to more efficiently translate specific subpopulations of mRNA. Ribosomes exist in every living organism for the same purpose, to synthesize proteins from mRNA. Previously, it was thought that ribosomes were homogenous and lacked any structural diversity.  Because function follows structure, these differences should be expected to alter a given ribosome’s affinity for more complementary mRNA strands. In addition to core variants, post-transcriptional modification of the ribosomal RNAs leads to additional structural differentiation, and therefore functional specialization.  For ribosomes to be functionally specialized it requires that the producing cell be sensitive to changing environmental conditions such that the ribosomes being synthesized exhibit biochemical differences that affect translation.

I don't know whether this book should be merged into [[Arithmetic]] or not, but maybe it would make good sense to move this book into [[Wikijunior]] since the target audience is children. Maybe the two books could be complimentary, with this book focusing on children 4-8, and [[Arithmetic]] focusing on children 9-11? --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 14:27, 11 November 2008 (UTC)

== Shwd v Sut ==

I noticed someone went back through and converted everything from '''Shwd''' to '''Sut''' which are both correct ways to say '''how''' in Welsh. I plan on going back to address all the dialects, and even for Mynediad - make a North and South version of the course, but we should stick to making the dialects consistent for right now. And '''yw''' isn't Northern, so mixing '''sut''' and '''yw''' wouldn't be the best way to do this. I'll go back and add both dialects soon. [[User:Brenin yr elyrch|Brenin yr elyrch]] ([[User talk:Brenin yr elyrch|talk]]) 15:58, 11 November 2008 (UTC)
:Oh wonderful. I just read through and noticed how decidedly northern everything was and thought this was unacceptable because dialects should be presented on an equal basis. Glad someone else is planning on taking care of this. &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;[[User:Cathfolant|Cath]][[User talk:Cathfolant|folant]]&lt;/font&gt; 19:12, 25 April 2013 (UTC)</text>

You can fry or grill sausages quickly, but in this recipe we cook them slowly (as recommended by Nigel Slater, no less) so as to really bring out the flavour.

Some people like baked beans with their sausage+mash, some people like gravy, some people don't need either...

Your timeline for this recipe is:
* 30 mins before, start the sausages cooking
* 25 mins before, peel+slice the potatoes and start them boiling
* 20 mins before, start the onion gravy
* 5 mins before, mash the potatoes
* 0 mins before, serve up!

==Ingredients==

* 2 or 3 good British butcher's sausages per person
* Potatoes - maris piper potatoes are good. 2 medium-to-large potatoes per person
* A little veg oil
* Some butter or marge
* A splash of milk

==Method==

===Bangers===

''Note: you do not need to prick the sausages, that only lets tasty juices escape! Similarly you don't necessarily need to separate them one from another until after they've cooked.''

Put a large heavy frying pan on a hob, on a medium heat, put a little veg oil in (if desired) and let it warm up. Then place the sausages in a single layer in the frying pan. Let them fry a minute or so, then turn them over, fry another minute, turn them around again, to try and get a bit of colour all over.

Once they've been in the hot pan for 5 minutes or so, turn the heat right down and let them fry very gently for the next 25 minutes, turning them over every 5 or 10 minutes so they get cooked evenly.

You can cook them for longer than this (up to about an hour even! on a ''reeeeaaallly'' low heat). Always make sure the sausages are cooked all the way through (no pinkness should remain).

===Mash===

Peel the potatoes and chop them roughly into pieces around 1 or 2 cm thick. Add them to a large pan of boiling water and boil vigorously for 15 minutes.

When they're done (they'll be soft enough that you can easily put a knife/fork into one of the pieces), drain them in a colander and return them to the big pan (not on the heat any more). Add a generous knob of butter and a splash of milk, and mash them all up with a potato masher.

'''Introduction''' &lt;br&gt;
-'''What is Rohingya Language?'''&lt;br&gt;

Rohingya Language is the written and spoken language of Rohingya Muslim people who are the aboriginals of Arakan State of Myanmar (formerly known as Burma) in South East Asia. 

Arakan is one of the larger States of Myanmar and is a place of two sister communities, namely Rohingya of Islamic faith, and Rakhine of Buddhist faith, each speaking a totally different language. Myanmar is comprised of seven states and seven divisions. Seven States are homes for seven major minority-ethnic groups and seven divisions for a single majority-ethnic group known as Burman.  &lt;br&gt; 

-'''Language Type'''&lt;br&gt;

Rohingya language family can be traced back to Indo-Aryan, Indo-Iranian, Indo-European. A some what similar language, known as Chittagoni, is also spoken in the south-most region of Bangladesh bordering Arakan State of Myanmar. Rohingya's second language is either Urdu for studying at religious schools or Burmese for studying at government schools. The study of English is also very much encouraged. You can find many words from Urdu, Hindi, Burmese and English assimilated into Rohingya language. 
 
-'''Script Types'''&lt;br&gt;

The first Rohingya language written was in Arabic Script more than 300 years ago. The first person who revived the Arabic Script again is Master Sultan in Mid 1970s which is about 40 years ago. His great effort was much appreciated and he wrote a number of books that reached to many Rohingyas. However, due to lack of some sounds in Arabic script to fulfill Rohingya tongue, many ordinary Rohingyas find much difficulties in reading. 

In early 1980s another scholar known as Maulana Hanif invented new characters mostly similar to Arabic script and a couple of other characters borrowed from Latin and Burmese. He managed to solve the reading problems significantly and his effort too was appreciated by many. But implementation of his characters in today's electronic media is not that simple because its writing system is right to left orientation and the shapes of characters changes by position within a word.    

By the year 2000 a new intuitive, logical and revolutionary concept has been used by Eng. Mohammed Siddique to write Rohingya Language using Latin characters only. He made Rohingya language extremely easy enabling you to read and write within few minutes by just following seven simple rules. This new writing system is known as Rohingyalish or Rohingyalic and it has been recognized by ISO ('''I'''nternational '''O'''rganization for '''S'''tandardization) on July 18, 2007 by assigning an International language code &quot;ISO 639-3 rhg&quot;.

-'''Number of Alphabets'''&lt;br&gt;

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; width=&quot;200&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; Aa &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; Bb &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; Cc &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; Çç &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; Dd &lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt; Ee &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; Ff &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; Gg &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; Hh &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; Ii &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; Jj &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; Kk &lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt; Ll &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; Mm &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; Nn &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; Ññ &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; Oo &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; Pp &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; Qq &lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt; Rr &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; Ss &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; Tt &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; Uu &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; Vv &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; Ww &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; Xx &lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt; Yy&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; Zz &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
Rohingya alphabets consist of all 26 English alphabets plus two Latin characters -Çç and Ññ - making a total of 28 alphabets. Out of these, five are used for forming three different types of vowels namely ''normal'', ''stressed'' and two types of ''circular'' vowels. 

There are six normal vowels - ''a'', ''e'', ''i'', ''o'', ''u'', ''ou'' - where the sixth one is formed by joining two alphabets ''o'' and ''u''. Stressed vowels are formed by using accented vowels - ''á'', ''é'', ''í'', ''ó'', ''ú'', ''óu'' - where the sixth one being accented ''ó'' and normal ''u'' joined. 

There are four circular vowels - ''ai'', ''ei'', ''oi'', ''ui'' which are formed by just adding ''i'' next to the four normal vowels. And there are also stressed circular vowels - ''ái'', ''éi'', ''ói'', ''úi'' - that are formed by adding the same ''i'' to each of the four accented vowels.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A primary source (also called original source) is a document, recording or other source of information (paper, picture,....etc.) that was created at the time being studied, by an authoritative source, usually one with direct personal knowledge of the events being described. It serves as an original source of information about the topic. Primary sources are distinguished from secondary sources, which often cite, comment on, or build upon primary sources.

Examples would include:
* Birth, Marriage, and Death certificates
* Family Bibles (if recorded by someone witnessing the event shortly after it occurred. 
* Letters describing the events as they are taking place by a person involved.

A secondary source is a document or recording that relates or discusses information originally presented elsewhere. A secondary source contrasts with a primary source, which is an original source of the information being discussed. Secondary sources involve generalization, analysis, synthesis, interpretation, or evaluation of the original information. Primary and secondary are relative terms, and some sources may be classified as primary or secondary, depending on how it is used. 

Examples include:
* History books
* Encyclopedias
* Letters written well after the event
* Oral histories as told by someone without first-hand knowledge of the event.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Overview==
The nucleolus, or plural nucleoli, is normally a circular structure composed of [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins|proteins]] and [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid|nucleic acids]]. Nucleoli are not typical organelles for the reason that they have no lipid [[Structural Biochemistry/Lipids/Biological Membranes|membrane]], making it with of the few non-membrane bound organelles in the cell. The nucleolus is located within the nucleus of eukaryote cells and is in charge of producing ribosomal RNA and the arrangement of ribosomes. The structure of the nucleoli can be seen using [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Cryo-Electron Microscopy|electron microsopy]] and [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Fluorescent Marker|fluorescent]] protein tagging can be used to view the dynamics of the nucleoli.

==Structure==
The nucleolus has three components:
# Fibrillar Centers (FC): FC is the place where ribosomal proteins are made.
# Dense Fibrillar Components (DFC): It has new transcribed RNA which binds to ribosomal proteins.
# Granular Components (GC): Before ribosomes are formed, GC has rRNA that binds to ribosomal proteins.

==Function==
The nucleolus is the nuclear subdomain that assembles ribosomal subunits in eukaryotic cells. The nucleolar organiser regions of chromosomes, which contain the genes for pre-ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA), serve as the foundation for nucleolar structure. The nucleolus disassembles at the beginning of mitosis, its components disperse in various parts of the cell and reassembly occurs during telophase and early G1 phase. Ribosome assembly begins with transcription of pre-rRNA. During transcription ribosomal and nonribosomal proteins attach to the RNA. Subsequently, there is modification and cleavage of pre-rRNA and incorporation of more ribosomal proteins and 5S rRNA into maturing pre-ribosomal complexes. The nucleolus also contains proteins and RNAs that are not related to ribosome assembly and a number of new functions for the nucleolus have been identified. These include assembly of signal recognition particles, sensing cellular stress and transport of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) messenger RNA.

      <comment>/* Origin of Golgi Apparatus */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Golgi apparatus, also known as the Golgi complex, golgi body, or simply golgi, is an organelle found in most eukaryotic cells. The golgi can be thought of as the &quot;packaging, modifying and shipping warehouse&quot; of the cell. 
==Overview==

[[File:Human leukocyte, showing golgi - TEM.jpg|right|thumb|Micrograph of Golgi Apparatus.]]
[[File:Golgi secretions.png]]

The Golgi apparatus, also called the Golgi complex, is commonly found in eukaryotic cells. The Golgi complex can be identified by its unique structure which some say looks like a maze, but in fact the structure is made of stacks of flattened membranous sacs, or cisternae. Unlike the cisternae of the endoplasmic reticulum or [[Structural Biochemistry/Cell Organelles/Endoplasmic Reticulum|ER]], these [[Structural Biochemistry/Lipids/Biological Membranes|membranes]] are not connected. The Golgi apparatus is responsible for the processing and packaging of [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins|protein]] and [[Structural Biochemistry/Lipids|lipids]], as well as processing proteins for secretion. The Golgi apparatus is often thought of as a post office; through the process of protein [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Protein Glycosylation|glycosylation]], sugars are added to the protein which dictate to where the protein should travel. N-linked glycosylation is begun in the endoplasmic reticulum but is continued in the golgi complex. O-linked glycosylation is solely done in the golgi complex. After proteins have been modified in the golgi apparatus, they are usually sent to either the lysosomes, secretory granules, or plasma membrane depending on the signals encoded within the protein sequence and structure. For this reason, Golgo complex is recognized as &quot;'''the major sorting center'''&quot; of the cell.


==Golgi Apparatus as an Independent Organelle==

Researchers in Yale show that the Golgi Apparatus is not just an outgrowth of another organelle, the endoplasmic reticulum, but an independent organelle on its own. The Golgi Apparatus is an organelle within a cell that has its own autonomy and so must grow and divide to keep pace with the growth and division that the cell inhibits. It has been found that even without the stacks of [[Structural Biochemistry/Lipids/Biological Membranes|membrane]] compartments where secretory proteins pass, the Golgi Apparatus still functions.
Proteins referred to as matrix proteins that form a scaffold have been found to be responsible for its growth, division and partitioning.

The Golgi Apparatus has been observed to grow, divide and be inherited like other organelles as has been observed in the regrowth of the mother Golgi Apparatus in daughter cells with the use of matrix proteins.

==History==

The Golgi was discovered by Italian physician Camillo Golgi in 1898 during an investigation of the nervous system. &lt;ref name=&quot;pmid9865849&quot;/&gt; Although the the discoverer denoted the structure as the &quot;internal reticular appartus,&quot; scientists changed it to the &quot;golgi complex&quot; in 1910. 
Few doubted the discovery, claiming that the organelle was a mere illusion created by the optical instruments used that discovered them. Yet, soon after the advent of modern microscopes circa 1900's, scientists alike confirmed the presence of the Golgi.

==Structure==

The Golgi complex is made several flattened membranes sacs, but can be ultimately divided into two sections: the Cis golgi and the Trans Golgi Network (TGN). The Cis golgi functions as the receiving end for newly synthesized proteins from the lumen of the Endoplasmic Reticulum ([[Structural Biochemistry/Cell Organelles/Endoplasmic Reticulum|ER]]). Vesicles containing proteins from the ER merge with the Cis golgi allowing the proteins to enter the Golgi complex. As the Cis golgi received proteins from the ER, the proteins then begin their modification moving along membrane to membrane towards the TGN. At the other end of the golgi complex, the newly modified protein arrives at the TGB where it is then send off to different parts of the cell via a transport vesicle.

==Origin of Golgi Apparatus==

There are two prevailing theories as to the formation of the Golgi apparatus. The vesicular shuttle model postulates that Golgi cannot be made from scratch and that the vesicles of the endoplasmic reticulum are sent to the pre-existing Golgi. On the other hand, the cisternae maturation model suggests that vesicles from the ER fuse together to form the Golgi and as proteins are processed and mature they create the next Golgi compartment.  New data suggest that perhaps neither model is completely correct. This will likely lead to yet another model. &lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.  Inside the Cell. September 2005.&lt;http://www.nigms.nih.gov&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cisternae Maturation Model===

[[File:Model for Golgi Formation.jpg|thumb|left|Cisternae Maturation Model shows that proteins from the ER join to make parts of the Golgi, so the Golgi can be made.]]

On the other side of the debate is Jennifer Lippincott-Schwartz of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (part of the National Institutes of Health) in Bethesda, Maryland. She says that the Golgi makes itself from scratch. According to her theory, packages of processing enzymes and newly made proteins that originate in the ER fuse together to form the Golgi. As the proteins are processed and mature, they create the next Golgi compartment. This is called the cisternae maturation model.  

In this model, the cisternae of the Golgi apparatus move by being built at the cis face and destroyed at the trans face. The vesicles from the endoplasmic reticulum fuse together to form a cisterna at the cis face and this cisternae would appear to move through the Golgi stack when a new cisterna is formed at the cis face. This model is supported by the fact that structures larger than the transport vesicles were observed microscopically to progress through the Golgi apparatus. In summary, packages of processing enzymes and new proteins originating in the ER fuse together to form the Golgi and as the proteins are processed and mature, the next Golgi compartment is created. Vesicular transport is one of models of Golgi apparatus that says that Golgi cannot make from scratch and that vesicles in the ER are sent to pre-existing Golgi. &lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.  Inside the Cell. September 2005.&lt;http://www.nigms.nih.gov&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vesicular Shuttle Model===

On one side of the debate is Graham Warren of Yale University School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut, who argues that the Golgi is an architectural structure that cannot be made from scratch. He believes that newly made proteins are packaged in the rough ER and are sent for further processing to a pre-existing structure (the Golgi) that is made up of different compartments.  This is called the vesicular shuttle model.  

This model views the Golgi apparatus as a very stable organelle that is divided into compartments in the cis to trans direction. Membrane bound carriers transport material between the endoplasmic reticulum and the different compartments of the Golgi. Experimental evidence shows the abundance of small vesicles in close proximity to the Golgi apparatus. Actin filaments direct the vesicles by connecting packaging proteins to the membrane to ensure that they fuse with the correct compartment. To summarize, newly made proteins are packaged in the rough ER and are sent for processing to a pre-existing structure known as the Golgi which is made up of different compartments.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.  Inside the Cell. September 2005.&lt;http://www.nigms.nih.gov&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vesicle Transport==

As soon as modified proteins reach the Trans Golgi Network (TGN), the proteins are separated into several different transport vesicles for different areas of the cell.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Vesicle Type!! Description
|-
| '''Exocytotic vesicles'''|| These vesicles contain protein that are to be sent outside the cell membrane. These vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane, releasing their contents outside the cell. This process is called constitutive secretion.
|-
| '''Secretory vesicles'''|| These vesicles are also to be sent outside the cell membrane. However what differs these from exocytotic vesicles is that secretory vesicles need a signal before they are released. When the signal is given, they will fuse with the plasma membrane to release the contents. This process is called regulated secretion.
|-
| '''Lysosomal vesicles'''|| These vesicles contain protein that are sent to the lysosome to be digested.
|}

==Transport Mechanism==

The transport mechanism that proteins use to progress through the Golgi apparatus is still not clear yet, but there are a number of hypotheses that currently exist. Up until recently, the vesicular transport mechanism had been the favored mechanism for transport but there is now more evidence that supports the cisternal maturation. The two models may work in conjunction with one another rather than being mutually exclusive. This is sometimes referred to as the combined ''model''.

==Glycosylation==

This is the process of adding sugar to a molecule. Glycosylation happens in the golgi apparatus and in the endoplasmic reticulum.  Glycosylation can only happen when an amino acid group with a hydroxyl (-OH) attaches to a sugar molecule.  Through a condensation reaction (water leaving) a sugar is added to the amino acid.

[[File:Centriole3D.png|thumb|3D view of a centriole]]
Every animal cell has two small organells called centrioles. Centrioles help the cell when it comes time to divide. Mitosis and meiosis both have centrioles involved in. A centriole is a small set of microtubules arranged in a specific way. Also, there are nine groups of microtubles. The centrioles are found in pairs and move towards the poles of the nucleus when it is time for cell division. During interphase, the cell is at rest. The centrioles move to opposite ends of the nucleus and a mitotic spindle of threads begins to appear during prophase. 

&lt;p&gt;Centrioles are cylindrical structures that composed of groupings of microtubules arranged in 9+3 pattern. They are usually exist in pairs that form '''centrosomes'''. Centrioles are found in animal cells and play a big role in cell division. While cell division, the centrosome divides and the centrioles replicate (make new copies). The result is two centrosomes, each with its own pair of centrioles. The two centrosomes move to opposite ends of the nucleus, and from each centrosome, microtubules grow into a &quot;spindle&quot; which is responsible for separating replicated chromosomes into the two daughter cells. 
Centrioles contain delta-tubulin, a protein which is part of the structure of tubulin.
Centrioles are barrel-shaped organelles that are found in most eukaryotic cells, with the exception of vascular plants and fungi. Centrioles consist of nine triplets of microtubules and are involved in the mitotic spindling, as well as when the cytoplasm of a eukaryotic cell split to form two daughter cells.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The immune system destroys foreign invaders to the body. It also destroys some non-foreign cells that are no longer performing their functions, such as cancer cells.

==Introduction==

The immune system is a biological system inside an organism which is supposed to fight against diseases. In vertebrates, the immune system is considered the last line of defense against foreign invaders.It fights by destroying pathogens and tumor cells using mechanisms that constantly adapt to recognize and rid these disease causing cells. This mechanism is needed so that the immune system does not attack itself or the organisms healthy cells. Unfortunately, pathogens can evolve rapidly which would allow it to avoid the immune system and attack the host. 

There are many mechanisms that have evolved that allow for the immune system to recognize and even neutralize pathogens. Every living organism even the most basic unicellular organisms, bacteria, contain some enzyme systems that are used to protect from viral infections. Similarly, there are many ancient eukaryotes in which basic immune mechanisms that been evolved and have been passed down to their modern descendants. Some of these evolved mechanisms are the complement system, phagocytosis, and defensins which are antimicrobial peptides. The immune system of vertebrates, like humans, is an elaborate network that consists of many types of tissues, cells, organs, and proteins. Due to this advanced immune system, it can more efficiently recognize specific pathogens over time. This adaptation is known as “acquired immunity” and results in an immunological memory that can be compared to a textbook full of information. This immunological memory, formed from direct encounter to a specific pathogen, results in a well-prepared response to the same specific pathogen the second time around. A vaccination serves this purpose. 

However, a disease can result in the immune system when it begins to properly operate. One such disease is called immunodeficiency in which the immune system performs at a much lower level than its suppose to and thus results in infections that are constantly recurring and may be life-threatening. This disease can be a result of either genetic disease or an infection such as AIDS which is caused by HIV. On the other extreme end is the disease known as autoimmune disease in which the immune system is so active that is begins to attack its own tissues as if they were foreign invaders. 

The immune system has many layers of defenses, to protect against infections, each with increasing specificity. The most basic defense is physical barriers that prevent pathogens from being able to enter the organism. However, if the pathogen is able to get through these physical barriers, the innate immune system takes over and provides a non-specific immediate response. Second line of the defense is the internal defense in the innate immunity. Internal defenses in innate immunity include phyagocytic cells, antimicrobial proteins, inflammatory response, natural killer cells. If the pathogens are able to get through this second line of defense, then the third layer of defense is the adaptive immune system. In order to improve its ability to recognize the pathogen during an infection, the immune system will adapt its response. After the pathogen has been nullified, the improved response is retained forming an immunological memory allowing the adaptive immune system to attack the same pathogen faster and stronger the next time it is encountered. 

Both the adaptive and innate immunity require that the immune system is able to differentiate between which molecules are self and non-self. Self molecules are parts of the organism’s body that are distinct and distinguished from outside foreign substances while non-self molecules are often known as antigens that specific immune receptors bind to.

Organisms protect themselves through various barriers. The first line of defense against infection are surface barriers including membranes and exoskeletons. Other bodily systems also protect the body by naturally repelling foreign agents. Tears, urine, mucus, coughing and sneezing are all examples of ways the body expels foreign agents. Another barrier to fight against infection is the chemical barrier which uses enzymes, also known as antibacterials, to kill pathogens.

==Innate Immunity==
===Cellular Barriers===
Certain cells of the mucous membranes produce mucus, a viscous fluid that enhances defenses by trapping microbes and other particles. Saliva, tears, and mucous secretions that bathe various exposed epithelia provide a washing action that also inhibits colonization by microbes. 
Pathogens that make their way into the body are subject to detection by leukocytes. These cells recognize microbes using Toll-like receptor. Toll-Like Receptor recognizes fragments of molecules characteristic of a set of pathogens. Similarly, on the inner surface of vesicles formed by endocytosis, is the sensor for double-stranded RNA a form of nucleic acid characteristic of certain viruses.

There are four types of internal defenses in the innate immunity:

===Phagocytosis===

Phagocytosis is the ingestion and digestion of bacteria and other foreign substances. It is triggered by hemocytes that circulate within the hemolymph. Six steps of ingestion and destruction of a microbe by a typical phagocytic cell are shown below. &lt;br&gt;(1) Pseudopodia surround microbes.&lt;br&gt; (2) Microbes are engulfed into cell.&lt;br&gt; (3) Vacuole containing microbes forms inside the cell.&lt;br&gt; (4) Vacuole and lysosome fuse. &lt;br&gt;(5) Toxic compounds and lysosomal enzymes destroy microbes. &lt;br&gt;(6) Microbial debris is released by exocytosis 

There are four types of phagocytic leukocytes that play a different role in the innate immune system.&lt;br&gt;
(1) &lt;b&gt;Neutrophils&lt;b&gt; are the most abundant phagocytic cells in the mammalian body. neutrophils represent 50-60% of the total leukocytes that circulate in the bloodstream.Signals from infected tissues attract neutrophils, which then engulf and destroy microbes. &lt;br&gt;
(2) &lt;b&gt;Macrophages&lt;b&gt; provide a more effective phagocytic defense than neutrophiles. Some of macrophages migrate throughout the body, while others reside permanently in various organs and tissues. Macrophages in the spleen, lymph nodes, and other tissues of the lymphatic system are particularly well positioned to combat pathoogens. Microbes in the blood become trapped in the spleen, whereas microbes in the interstitial fluid flow into lymph and are trapped in lymph nodes. &lt;br&gt;
(3) &lt;b&gt;Eosinohpis&lt;b&gt; have low phagocytic activity but are important in defending against multicellular invaders such as parsitic worms. Rather than engulfing such parasites, eosinophils position themselves against the parasite's body and then discharge destructive enzymes that damage the invaders.&lt;br&gt;
(4) &lt;b&gt;Dendritic cells&lt;b&gt; populate tissues that are in contact with the environment. They mainly stimulate development of adapative immunity against microbes they encounter. Dendritic cells are also phagocytes in the tissue but have contact with the external environment and thus exiss mainly in the intestines, stomach, nose, lungs, and skin. They are similar to neuronal dendrites as both have spine-like projections. Dendritic cells link both the bodily tissues and the adaptive and innate immune systems as they present antigens to T-cells.

===Antimicrobial Proteins===

&lt;b&gt;Interferons&lt;b&gt; are proteins that provide innate defense against viral infections. Virus-infected body cells secrete interferons, inducing neraby uninfected cells to produce substances that inhibit viral reproduction. Interferons limit the cell-to-cell spread of viruses in the body, helping control viral infections such as colds and influenza. Some white blood cells secrete a different type of interferon that helps activate macrophages, enhacing their phagocytic ability. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Complement System&lt;b&gt; consists of roughly 30 proteins in blood plasma that function together to fight infections. These proteins circulate in an inactive state and are activated in a cascade of biochemical reactions leading to bursting of invading cells.

===Inflammatory Response===
Inflmmatory response is the pain and swelling that alert you to a splinter under your skin. One important inflammatory signaling molecule is histamine, which is stored in the mast cells. Mast cells, which exist in both mucous membranes and connective tissues, regulate the inflammatory response. They secrete chemical mediators that are often found in the defense against parasites and sometimes also are found in allergic reactions like asthma. Natural killer cells are a type of leukocyte that attack tumor cells and cells that have been virus-infected. Histamine released by mast cells at sites of tissue damage triggers nearby blood vessels to dilate and beomce more permeable. &lt;br&gt; 
Steps of major events in a local inflammatory response are shown below.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;(1)&lt;b&gt; Activated macrophages and mast cells at the injury site release signaling molecules that act on nearby capillaries.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;(2)&lt;b&gt; The capillaries widen and become more permeable, allowing fluid containing antimicrobial peptides to enter the tissue. Signaling molecules released by immune cells attract additional phagocytic cells.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;(3)&lt;b&gt; Phagocytic cells digest pathogens and cell debris at the site, and the tissue heals.

===Natural Killer Cells===
Natural Killer (NK) cells help recognize and eliminate certain diseased cells in vertebrates. With the exception of red blood cells, all cels in the body normally have on their surface a protein called class I MHC molecule. Following viral infection or conversion to a cancerous state, cells sometimes stop expressing this protein. The NK cells that patrol the body attach to such stricken cells and release chemicals that lead to a cell death, inhibiting further spread of the virus or cancer.

==Adaptive Immunity==

There are two types of immunity in the adaptive immunity:

===Cellular immunity===

Cellular immunity is also known as cell-mediated immunity (CMI). This type of immunity act as the second arm of the immune responses. There are different functions of immune cells. For example, this type of cell-mediated immunity includes the killing of intracellular pathogens and direct cell killing by cytotoxic T cells, natural killer cells, and killer cells  (T-cells work by scanning the surface of a cell for anything that appears foreign.) In CMI, the T cells or the lymphocytes would attach to the surface of other cells, then it would display an antigen and trigger a response. This type of immune response may also include white blood cells (leukocytes).

===Humoral immunity===

This type of immunity guards against infections caused by bacteria and extracellular phases of viral infections. The immunity is mediated by a big, diverse collection of proteins which are related termed antibodies or immunoglobins; in mammals, these are produced by the B cells in bone marrow. B cells play a major role in humoral immunity. B cells like T cells also have surface receptors, which allows them to recognize certain antigen. The variable portion in the B cells accepts specific antigens. Once a B cell recognizes this antigen it has the ability to perform two functions. One is to generate plasma B cells that can reproduce more cells with the specific binding site. The other is to form memory B cells, which acts as an immunity to the antibody whenever it is encountered again.

In the immune system inflammation is often one of the first responses. This can be typically seen through swelling and redness which are a result of increased blood flow to a tissue. The injured or infected cells release cytokines and eicosanoids which results in inflammation. The dilation of the blood vessels and the fever are produced by the prostaglandins while the white blood cells are attracted by leukotrienes both of which are part of the eicosanoids. The common cytokines are interferons which can shut down protein synthesis and interleukins which communicate between white blood cells. Cytokines as well as other chemicals, attract immune cells to where the infection is and remove the pathogens followed by healing of the damaged tissue.

==Adaptive Immune System==

The adaptive immune system allows for a strong immune response and is the basis of the immunological memory as each pathogen the body encounters is now remembered by a specific antigen. The adaptive immune response requires that the body recognizes specific non-self antigens during antigen presentation. This antigen specificity allows the body to generate responses that are meant to fight that specific pathogen and the pathogen-infected cells. The ability to generate the correct responses specific to that pathogen is maintained by memory cells in the body. If a pathogen infects the body more than one time, the specific memory cells will quickly eliminate the pathogen.

The adaptive immune system cells are called lymphocytes which are a special type of leukocyte. Major types of lymphocytes include B cells and T cells derived from bone hematopoietic stem cells found in the bone marrow. While T cells are involved in cell-mediated immune response, B cells are involved in the humoral immune response. 

Both T cells and B cells contain receptor molecules that are used to recognize specific targets. T cells can recognize a non-self target like a pathogen only after antigens (small part of the pathogen) has been processed together in combination with a self receptor referred to as a major histomcompatbility complex (MHC) molecule. There includes two major types of T cells which are the helper T cells and the killer T cells. While Killer T cells can only recognize antigens coupled with a Class I MHC molecule, helper T cells only can recognize antigens that are coupled with Class II MHC molecules. 

On the other hand, B cell antigen-specific receptors are an antibody molecule that exists on the surface of the B cell and recognize pathogens without needing any antigen processing. Different B cells express a different antibody, thus the complete set of B cell antigen receptors is the representation of all the antibodies that the body can make. 

Killer T cells kill cells that are infected with viruses and/or other pathogens or cells that are damaged or dysfunctional. Similar to B cells, the different types of T cells recognize a different antigen. Killer T cells are then activated when their respective T cell receptor (TCR) binds to the specific antigen which is in a MHC Class I complex receptor of another cell. CD8, a co-receptor on the T cell helps recognition of this MHC antigen complex. T cells travel throughout the body searching for cells in which the MHC I receptors contain this antigen. When an activated T cell comes in contacts with these cells, it releases cytotoxins which results in the formation of pores in the target cell’s plasma membrane which allows water, toxins, and ions to enter. The entry of granulysin which is another toxin causes the target cell to undergo apoptosis which is basically the self-destruction of the cell. The T cells that kill hosts cells are extremely important in preventing viruses from replicating. T cell activation is controlled extremely tightly and usually requires a really strong MHC/antigen activation signal provided by helper T cells.

==Immunological Memory==

When B and T cells begin to replicate, some of the offspring that they produce will end up becoming long-lived memory cells. These memory cells will remember all specific pathogens encountered during the animal’s lifetime and can thus call forth a strong response if the pathogen ever invades the body again. This is called “adaptive immune system” since it is a result of an adaptation to an infection with the pathogen during the individual’s lifetime and continues to prepare the immune system for potential future pathogens. Immunological memory can either be in active long-term memory or passive short-term memory.

==Passive Memory==

Newborn infants are particularly vulnerable to infections since they have no prior exposure to pathogens. Thus, the mother protects the infant through several layers of passive protection. During pregnancy, TgG, which is a certain type of antibody, is transported to the baby from the mother through the placenta so even babies have high levels of antibodies that have similar antigen specificities as the mother. Even breast milk contains antibodies that are transferred to the infant’s gut and protect against bacterial infections until the baby is capable of making its own antibodies. Since the fetus isn’t making any memory cells or antibodies, it is called passive immunity. The passive immunity is short-lived, ranging from a couple days to a couple months. 

==Active Memory and Immunization==

Following an infection, long-term active memory is acquired by activation of B and T cells. Vaccinations take advantage of this by artificially generating active immunity. During a vaccination, the antigen of a pathogen is introduced into the body and stimulates the immune system to develop a specific immunity against that pathogen without actually causing the disease that the pathogen brings. This deliberate introduction of the pathogen is successful since it exploits the immune system’s natural specificity and its inducibility. Vaccination is an extremely effective manipulation of the immune system that helps fight diseases. 

Many bacterial vaccinations are the acellular components of the microorganisms while viral vaccinations are the live attenuated viruses as well as harmless toxin components. Since bacterial vaccines derived from acellular components do not induce a strongly adaptive response, most of the bacterial vaccines are thus provided in addition with adjuvants that activate the antigen-presenting cells that are existent in the innate immune system to maximize the immunogenicity. 

==Immunodeficiencies==

Immunodeficiencies occurs in a human when parts of the immune system are inactive. Since a component is inactive, its ability to respond to pathogens is reduced . Common causes of poor immune function are obesity, drugs, and alcohol. The most common cause of immunodeficiency is malnutrition in developing countries. The lack of sufficient proteins often result in impaired complement activity, cell-mediated immunity, cytokine production, and phagocyte function. Deficiency of single nutrients also reduces the immune responses. Also the loss of the thymus either through a genetic mutation of removal through surgery also results in severe immunodeficiency as the animal becomes high susceptible to infection.

Immunodeficiency can also be acquired or inherited. An example of inherited immunodeficiency is the chronic granulomatous disease in which the phagocytes’ ability to destroy pathogens have been reduced. An example of an acquired immunodeficiency is AIDS and some types of cancer.

==Autoimmunity==

Autoimmunity occurs when there is an overactive immune response resulting in autoimmune disorders. In these disorders, the immune system is unable to properly distinguish between itself and non-self and as a result, attacks its own body. Usually, the antibodies and T cells react with self peptides. To prevent autoimmunity, one of the functions of specialized cells, often found in the thymus and bone marrow, is to have young lymphocytes that have self antigens produced throughout the body and to get rid of the cells that recognize self-antigens.

==Hypersensitivity==

Hypersensitivity happens when the immune response damages the body’s own tissues. There are four classes of hypersensitivity (Type I-IV). Type I hypersensitivity is an anaphylactice reaction often associated with allergies. The symptoms have a huge range anywhere from just mild discomfort to death. Type I hypersensitivity is often mediated by IgE which is released from basophils and mast cells. Type II hypersensitivity occurs when the antibodies bind to the antigens on the animal’s own cells marking them for destruction often referred to as antibody-dependent hypersensitivity. Type III hypersensitivity reactions are often triggered by immune complexes that are deposited in various tissues. Delayed type hypersensitivity or Type IV hypersensitivity, involve many autoimmune and infectious diseases and often take two to three days to develop. These are often mediated by macrophages, monocytes, and T cells.

==Immunology of Tumors==

An important role that the immune system serves is to identify and eliminate tumors. The tumor’s transformed cells express antigens that aren’t normally found on normal cells. These antigens appear foreign to the immune system and when near tumors, the immune cells attack the transformed tumor cells. The antigens that are expressed by the tumors come from various sources including papillomavirus which is derived from an oncogenic virus which often results in cervical cancer while other sources are the organism’s own proteins that normally only have low levels in normal cells but reach unusually high levels in tumor cells. An example of this is the enzyme tyrosinase that can transform certain skin cells into tumor cells called melanomas when expressed at really high levels. Another source of tumor antigens are the mutation of proteins that are normally important for survival regulating cell growth into cancer inducing molecules.

The main response that the immune system uses for tumors is to use killer T cells to with the assistance of helper T cells to destroy the abnormal cells. The tumor antigens that are present on MHC class I molecules are really similar to viral antigens. This similarity allows the killer T cells to recognize tumor cells as abnormal. NK cells kill tumor cells as well in similar ways especially if on their surface, there are fewer than normal MHC class I molecules; this is a common trait with tumors. Sometimes there are antibodies that are generated against tumor cells to destroy them.

However, some tumors evade the immune system and end up causing cancer. Since the tumor cells often have only a reduced MHC class I molecule count on their surface, they often avoid detection by the killer T cells. Some of the tumor cells release products that inhibit the immune response as well like when they secrete the cytokine TGF-B which is known to suppress the activity of lymphocytes and macrophages. Also sometimes the immune system doesn’t attack the tumor cells anymore when immunological tolerance is developed against tumor antigens. 

Macrophages can promote the growth of tumors and thus tumor cells release cytokines that can attract macrophages that release cytokines and growth factors that end up nurturing the tumors for development. Both the combination of hypoxia in the tumor and the cytokines that are released by the macrophages induce tumor cells that decrease the production of a protein that often blocks metastasis that help the spread of cancer cells.

==Pathogen’s Evade the Immune System==

The pathogen’s success is depends on its ability to evade the host’s immune responses. Thus, pathogens have evolved several methods allowing them to infect a host successfully by evading detection and destruction by the immune system. Bacteria usually overcome the physical barriers by secreting enzymes to digest the barrier like type II secretion system. They also use a type III secretion system that allows them to insert a hallow tube providing a direct route for the proteins to enter the host cell. These proteins often shutdown the defenses of the host.

Some pathogens avoid the innate immune system by hiding within the cells of the host also referred to as intracellular pathogenesis. The pathogen hides inside the host cell where it is protected from direct contact with the complement, antibodies, and immune cells. A lot of pathogens release compounds that misdirect of diminish the host’s immune response. Some bacteria even form biofilms which protects them from the proteins and cells of the immune system. Many successful infections often involve biofilms. Some bacteria create surface proteins that will bind to antibodies making them ineffective such as Streptococcus.

Other pathogens invade the body by changing the non-eseential epitopes on their surface rapidly while keeping the essential epitopes hidden. This is referred to as antigenic variation. HIV rapidly mutates so the proteins that are on its viral envelope which are essential for its entry into the host’s target cell are consistently changing. Since these antigens are changing so much, this is why vaccines have not been invented.  Another common strategy that is used is asking the antigens with host molecules thus evading detection by the immune system. With HIV, the envelope covering the viron is created from the host cell’s outmost membrane making it hard for the immune system to identify it as a non-self structure.

==Medicine Manipulation==

The immune response system can be manipulated so that the unwanted responses that occur from allergy and autoimmunity can be suppressed. It can also be manipulated to heighten the protective responses against pathogens that evade the immune system. Autoimmune disorders, inflammation due to excessive tissue damage, and prevention of transplant rejection after donation of an organ transplant are controlled by immunosuppressive drugs. Anti-inflammatory drugs are used to control effects of inflammation, however with undesirable side effects such as osteoporosis. Thus anti-inflammatory drugs are often used with immunosuppressive drugs. Cytotoxic drugs can inhibit the immune system by destroying dividing cells like activated T cells. However, the negative part is that it is indiscriminate killing and other constantly dividing cells are also affected resulting in toxic side effects. 

Larger drugs can promote a neutralizing immune response especially if it is repeatedly administered or in large doses. This thus limits its effectiveness based on larger proteins and peptides. Methods have been made to predict the immunogenicity of proteins and peptides which is particular useful when designing therapeutic antibodies. Earlier techniques often relied on the observation that hydrophilic amino acids are often more represented in epitope regions than hydrophobic amino acids. 

==Mechanism==

An immune response is triggered by the presence of a foreign macromolecule, often a protein or carbohydrate; these are known as an antigen. For example, immunoglobins exist on the surface of B cells. 

An innate immune system response is usually triggered by microbes identified by pattern recognition receptors. These defenses are non-specific and does not have long-lasting immunity against a foreign agent, but it is the most dynamic way a defense system responds in most organisms.The innate immune system functions to recruit immune cells to the infection site by producing cytokines, activate complement cascade to identify pathogen, assist white blood cells in identification, and activation of the adaptive immune system through antigen presentation.

The complement system attacks the surface of pathogens. Containing over 20 proteins, the complement system is the biggest humoral component of the innate immune response. This response is triggered by complement binding to antibodies attached to carbohydrates on the surface of microbes triggering the rapid killing response. The complement proteins are initially bound to microbes and activate their protease activity which activates other complement proteases producing a catalytic cascade that amplifies the inial signal using positive feedback. This results in the production of peptides attracting immune cells and increasing the cascular permeability while marking the surface of the pathogen for destruction. 

Another quick response to infection is inflammation. Usually marked by redness and swelling caused by increased blood flow to the tissue, inflammation is produce by eicosanoids and cytokins that are released by attacked cells. Eicosanoids induce fever and dilation of blood vessels while leukotrienes attract white blood cells. Cytokins recruit immune cells to the infection site to promote healing of damaged tissue after removing the pathogens.

The adaptive immune system proves to eliminate and prevent pathogens by recognizing and remembering specific pathogens and creating stronger attacks for each encounter of the pathogen. This adaptive property helps prepare the body for future challenges. 

When an antigen binds to this immunoglobin, the B cell engulfs the anibody-antigen complex and degrades it. Following this process, the T cells stimulate the B cells to proliferate and the process is repeated for additional antigens. B cells may live for several days; some B cells live for years and are called memory B cells. These can stimulate a more rapid response to an antigen they have encountered in the past.

[[:Image:newImmuneSystemOverview.gif]]

==Structure==

Antibody structures form a related and big group of proteins. All immunoglobins contain four subunits at the least: 2 identical heavy chains (weighing 53-75 kD) and 2 identical light chains (weighing approximately 23 kD). The subunits are attached by disulfide bonds as well as non-covalent interactions to form a Y shaped structure which is symmetric. There are five different classes of immunoglobins (IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, IgM) differing mostly in the type of heavy chain they contain and sometimes in their subunit structure. As a result, different immunoglobins have different functions. For example, IgE bids to allergens and protects against parasitic worms while IgA is found in mucus and prevents colonization. The most common of th immunoglobins by far is IgG.

[[Image:Antibody svg.svg|{left}|{thumb}|An antibody has 2 heavy chains and 2 light chains used to recognize the cooresponding antigen.]]

An immunoglobin consists of homology units which all have the same characteristic fold. This fold, which is in the light chain, consists of a 'sandwich'-like structure composed of three and four stranded anti-parallel beta-sheets that are linked by a disulfide bond. This structure can accommodate an enormous variety of antigens. The light chain recognizes antigens through three loops in its variable domain (which is an area part of the light chain). This domain includes the most amino acid variation among antibodies in the whole immunoglobin; these are called hybervariable sequences. 

The forces and bonding involved between an antibody and antigen include van der waals, hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic, and ionic interactions. The two are structurally complementary to each other; therefore, strong bonds are formed. Dissociation constants between an antigen and an antibody range from 10^-4 - 10^-10, which is greater than or equal to the dissociation constant associated with an enzyme and its substrate.

For the most part, immunoglobins are divalent molecules capable of binding to two different antigens at the same time. A foreign organism or substance usually has many antigens on its surface. Thus, a typical immune response consists of a mixture of antibodies with different specificities divalently binding to the antigens. This binding allows the cross-linking of the antigens to form an extended lattice formation, which assists and decreases the time in which it takes to remove the antigen. This also triggers further B cell formation and proliferation.
[[Media:[[Media:Example.ogg]]]]

==Antibody generation==

An antigen does not influence a B cell to produce new immunoglobin to bind to. Instead, an antigen stimulates the proliferation of a pre-existing B cell antibodies that recognize the antigen. Thus, the immune system has the ability to generate a plethora of different antibodies. Most of these are sufficient for a person to respond through his or her immune system to respond to almost any antigen he or she may encounter. The diversity in antibody sequences arises from genetic changes during B lymphocyte development not only from the number of immunoglobin genes.

The immune system is unique in that it only responds to foreign substances and not to the high and diverse amount of endogenous molecules.Because most macromolecules are virtually antigenic, transferring tissues, organs, or blood samples among individuals and within species presents great challenges and is being researched continuously.

The immune system may lose tolerance to some of its self-antigens, causing an autoimmune disease, which at its worst, could be deadly. Autoimmune diseases include: Addison's disease, Crohn's disease, Multiple sclerosis, Psoriasis, and Graves' disease.

Addison's disease is caused when the adrenal glands do not produce enough steroid hormones known as cortisol. This rare genetic disease may develop in children, adults, and even some species of animals. The treatment involves the replacement of hormones.

Crohn's disease is the autoimmune, inflammatory disease of the intestines. The body's immune system attacks the gastrointestinal tract causing inflammation. Commonly believed to be a primary T cell autoimmune disorder, new studies believe it to be an impaired innate immunity due to impaired cytokine secretion by macrophages causing microbial-induced inflammatory response.

Multiple sclerosis is when the body's immune system attacks the central nervous system leading to demyelination. Affecting the communication between the spinal cord and the brain, nerve cells communicate by sending electrical signals (action potentials) down axons which are wrapped in myelin. Myelin is attacked and is damaged resulting in MS.

Psoriasis is a chronic, mostly hereditary, non-contagious auntoimmune disease affecting the skin and joins as it becomes red and scaly patches appear on the skin. These areas of inflammation and excess skin production have a silvery-white appearance. In this special case, inflammation isn't caused by pathogens as T cells move from the dermis to the epidermis.

Graves' disease is an autoimmune disease affecting the thyroid causing it to enlarge its size twice and become overactive. This also affects the eyes and other systems of the body. The body produces antibodies to the receptor for the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) causing hyperthyroidism as the TSH receptor and antibodies bind. There becomes an abnormally high production of T3 and T4 which causes hyperthyroidism and enlargement of the thyroid gland.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==History==
Early signs of branching evolutionary trees or phylogenetic trees are paleontological charts. This kind of chart was illustrated in Edward Hitchcock's book called the Elementary Geology, which showed the geological relationships between that of plants and animals. However, going way back in time, the whole idea of tree life first started from the ancient notions of a ladder-like progression from the lower to the higher forms of life. An example of a ladder-like progression would be that of the Great Chain of Being. 

In addition, a well-known man named Charles Darwin from the 1850s produced one of the first drawings of evolutionary tree in his seminal book called &quot;The Origin of Species&quot;. Basically in this book, he showed the importance of evolutionary trees. After many years later, many evolutionary biologists studied the forms of life through the use of tree diagrams to depict evolution. The reason for this is that these types of diagrams prove to be very effective at explaining the concept of how speciation happens through the random splitting of lineages and the idea of adaptive. Overall, for many centuries, many biologists used the tool evolutionary trees as a way to study the idea of life. 

==Phylogeny==
[[File:Phylogenic tree.png|thumb|Phylogenic Tree of Life]]

Evolutionary trees, or Phylogeny, is the formal study of organisms and their evolutionary history with respect to each other. Phylogenetic trees are most commonly used to depict the relationships that exist between species. In particular, they clarify whether certain traits are homologous (found in the common ancestor as a result of divergent evolution) or homoplasy (or sometimes referred to as analogous, a character that is not found in a common ancestor but whose function developed independently in two or more organisms, known as convergent evolution). Evolution Trees are diagrams that show various biological species and their evolutionary relationships. They consist of branches that flow from lower forms of life to the higher forms of life. 

Evolutionary trees differ from taxonomy.  Whereas taxonomy is an ordered division of organisms into categories based on a set of characteristics used to assess similarities and differences, evolutionary trees involve biological classification and use morphology to show relationships.  Phylogeny  is shown by evolutionary history using the relationships found by comparing polymeric molecules such as RNA, DNA, or protein of various organisms. The evolutionary pathway is analyzed by the sequence similarity of these polymeric molecules. This is based on the assumption that the similarities of sequence result from having fewer evolutionary divergence than others. The evolutionary tree is constructed by aligning the sequences. The length of the branch is proportional to the amount of amino acid differences between the sequences.

Phylogenetic systematics informs the construction of phylogenetic trees based on shared characters. Comparing nucleic acids or other molecules to infer relationships is a valuable tool for tracing an organism's evolutionary history. The ability of molecular trees to encompass both short and long periods of the time is hinges on the ability of genes to evolve at different rates, even in the same evolutionary lineage. 
For example, the DNA that codes for rRNA changes relatively slowly, so comparisons of DNA sequences in these genes are useful for investigating relationships between taxa that diverged a long time ago. 
Interestingly, 99% of the genes in humans and mice are detectably orthologous, and 50% of our genes are orthologous with those of yeast. The hemoglobin B genes in humans and in mice are orthologous. These genes serve similar functions, but their sequences have diverged since the time that humans and mice had a common ancestor. 

Evolutionary pathways relating the members of a family of proteins may be deduced by examination of sequence similarity. This approach is based on the notion that sequences that are more similar to one another have had less evolutionary time to diverge than have sequences that are less similar.

Evolutionary trees are used today for DNA hybridization. They are used to determine the percentage difference of genetic material between two similar species. If there is a high resemblance of DNA between the two species, then the species are closely related. If only a small percentage is identical, then they are distant in relationship.

==Construction of a Evolutionary Tree==
Each point at which a line in a evolutionary tree branches off is known as a node. A node is a common ancestor to the species that come off that branch. Relationships between species in an evolutionary tree include monophyletic, paraphyletic, and polyphyletic. A monophyletic group is a branch of species which contain a common ancestor and all descendants. Paraphyletic groups consist of a common ancestor but not all its descendants. Polyphyletic groups consist of organisms that do not have a (recent) common ancestor and are usually compared to study similar characters among relatively unrelated organisms. 

These nodes are calculated by using a computational phylogenetic program that calculates the genetic distance from multiple sequence alignments.  However, there are limitations, primarily not being able to account the actual evolutionary history.  While the sequence alignment shows comparatively how related two species are, there is no indication as to how they evolved. Therefore for these the origins of the three domains came from the same ancestor and then branches out to the two distinct groups Eukarya and Prokarya. However, the Archaea branches out of the Eukarya domain, even though they are single-celled. 

[[Image:clade.png|frame|Framework for phylogenetic tree.  The entire region in white represents a monophyletic group.  The region in yellow, excluding the green region, would represent a paraphyletic group; a group with a common ancestor but not its descendants.]]

Evidence for Phylogeny construction:
1.	By looking at the fossil record. The problem is that the record is incomplete and only hard structures were preserved. 
2.	By studying recent species, looking at the shared characters, both homologous and analogous characters, give evidence of evolutionary past. 


[[Image:Tree_of_life_SVG.svg|thumb|right|500px|Tree of Life]]

==Types of Evolutionary Tree==
There are many different types of evolutionary trees and each one represents something different. One type of evolutionary tree is called the rooted phylogenetic tree. This tree is a direct type of tree that contains a special node corresponding to the most recent common ancestor of all the entities at the leaves of the tree. The use of an uncontroversial outgroup is one of the most common techniques used for rooting trees. In other words, rooted trees typically illustrate the sequence or trait data of a particular outgroup. 

Another type of evolutionary tree is called the unrooted tree. Unrooted trees often illustrate the relationship between different leaf nodes. This is done without making any assumptions about the ancestry. Unlike that of the rooted trees where a sign of ancestry identify is needed, unrooted trees can always be created from rooted ones by omitting the root. Basically, an unrooted tree is generated by introducing assumptions about the relative rates of evolution on each branch or including an outgroup in the input data. An application that is often used in this process is called the molecular clock hypothesis. 

Last but not least, bifurcating tree is also a type of evolutionary tree. In bifurcating tree, both rooted and unrooted phylogenetic trees can be multifurcating or bifurcating, and can be shown as labeled or unlabeled. For example, a rooted tree that has been multifurcated may have more than two children at the nodes, unlike that of the unrooted multifurcating tree where more than three neighbors can appear at the nodes. 

Furthermore a rooted tree that has been bifurcated has exactly two descendants arising from each interior node that typically forms a binary tree. On the other hand, an unrooted bifurcating tree is similar to that of an unrooted binary tree. An unrooted binary tree often has a free tree with exactly three neighbors at each internal node. In terms of labeled and unlabeled trees, labeled trees has unique values assigned to its leaves, while an unlabeled tree also known as a tree shape is define as a topology only. 

Overall, the number of possible trees for a given number of leaf nodes depends on the specific type of tree one is looking at. However, there are always less bifurcating trees than multifurcating trees. Similarly, there are less unlabeled than labeled trees and less unrooted than rooted trees. In terms of labeling the tree, it is always important to know that the letter &quot;n&quot; represents the number of leaf nodes.

==Sequence Alignment in Evolutionary Trees==
Evolutionary trees can be made by the determination of sequence information of similar genes in different organisms.  Sequences that are similar to each other frequently are considered to have less time to diverge.  Whereas, less similar sequences have more evolutionary time to diverge.  The evolutionary tree is created by aligning sequences and having each branch length proportional to the amino acid differences of the sequences. Furthermore, by assigning a constant mutation rate to a sequence and performing a sequence alignment, it is possible to calculate the approximate time when the sequence of interest diverged into monophyletic groups.

DNA can be amplified and sequences with the development of PCR methods. Mitochondrial DNA from a Neanderthal fossil was identified to contain 379 bases of sequence. When compared to the Homo sapiens, only 22 to 36 substitutions in the sequence was found as opposed to 55 differences between homo sapiens and chimpanzees over common base in the same region. Further analysis suggests that the Homo sapiens and Neanderthals shared common ancestry 600,000 years ago. This reveals that Neanderthals were not intermediate between chimpanzees and humans, but rather an evolutionary dead end, which became extinct.

Sequence alignments can be performed on a variety of sequences.  For constructing an evolutionary tree for proteins, for example, the sequences are aligned and then compared via likeness to construct a tree.  In the globin tree above, it is then possible to see which protein diverged first.  Another example typically uses rRNA(ribosomal RNA) to compare organisms, since rRNA has a slower mutation rate, and is a better source for evolutionary tree construction.

This is best supported by Dr. Carl Woese's study that was conducted in the late 1970s. Since the ribosomes were critical to the function of how living things operate, they are not easily changed through the process of evolution. Significant changes could allow the ribosomes to not do its role, therefore having the gene sequence of it is conserved. Taking advantage of this, Dr. Woese compared the minuscule differences in the sequences of ribosomes amongst a great array of bacteria and showed how they were not all related. Looking at extreme bacteria such as methanogens, was not able to connect them to eukaryote or proselytes because they fell within their own category of archaea.

==Example of Phylogeny Tree for the Domain Eukarya==
Constructing the phylogeny tree requires systematists to search for synapomorphies (shared derived characters) and symplesiomorphies (shared ancestral characters) characteristics. 


[[File:Three Domain.JPG|360px|Three Domain]]
Reading the Phylogeny tree: The numbers in the diagram indicate the synapomorphies or shared derived characters unique only for those group or groups . The diagram shows that there are three domains: Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya. The domain Eukarya and Archaea possess (1) have introns, histones,  and RNA polymerase similar to eukaryotic RNA polymerase. Furthermore, the domain Archaea possesses (2) unique lipid content in membranes and unique cell wall composition.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The purpose of genomics research has been the sequencing and analysis of the human genome. The human genome is made up of about 3 billion base pairs of DNA, which are distributed among 24 chromosomes. This poses the difficulty of producing a complete sequence. By going through the process of an organized international effort of academic labs and private companies, though, the human genome has now progressed from a draft sequence which was first reported in 2001 to a finished sequence in 2004.

The human genome contains a plethora of information about the different characteristics of humanity, including biochemistry and evolution. Analysis of the human genome will continue to grow and expand in order to better understand humans. One of the first tasks in accomplishing this is to develop an inventory of protein-encoding genes. When the genome-sequencing project first began, about 100,000 genes were estimated to exist. When the completed, but unfinished, genome was first made available, this estimate actually dropped down to about 30,000 to 35,000 genes. It dropped again to 20,000 to 25,000 when the sequence was finished. Because there are a relatively large number of pseudogenes, many of which are formerly functional genes that have mutated and are no longer expressed, the estimate of genes dropped by 75%. More than half of the genomic regions for olfactory receptors, the molecules responsible for the human sense of smell, are pseudogenes. The surprisingly small number of genes still belies the complexity of the human proteome, though. Many genes encode more than one protein through mechanisms such as alternative splicing of mRNA and posttranslational modifications of proteins. Important variations in functional properties are shown in the different proteins encoded by a single gene.

A large amount of DNA is contained in the human genome that does not participate in the coding of proteins. Modern-day biochemists and genetic researchers are attempting to elucidate the roles of this noncoding DNA, as a lot of this DNA shows due to the existence of mobile genetic elements. These elements have inserted themselves throughout the genome over the course of time. Most of these elements, though, have gone through mutations and, therefore, are no longer functional. More than 1 million ''Alu'' sequences, each sequence consisting of about 300 bases, are present in the human genome. ''Alu'' sequences are examples of SINES, short interspersed elements. Additionally, the human genome includes nearly 1 million LINES, long interspersed elements, which are DNA sequences that are 10 kilobase pairs in length. The roles of these elements as neutral parasites or instruments of genome evolution are still being studied.

The exploration of genes relies on key tools
1. Restriction-enzyme analysis
2. Blotting techniques
3. DNA sequencing
4. Solid-phase synthesis of nucleic acids
5. The Polymerase chain reaction

===Comparative Genomics===
Insight into the human genome can be discovered by comparing it with the genomes of other organisms. For example, the sequencing of the genome of chimpanzees, the closest living relative to humans, is almost complete. Genomic comparisons with other mammals used in biological research, such as mice and rats, have already been completed. The results of these comparisons show that 99% of human genes have counterparts in these rodent genomes. These genes, however, have been greatly reassorted among chromosomes in the estimated 75 million years of evolution since humans and rodents have had a common ancestor. The genomes of other organisms has been determined specifically for the purpose of comparative genomics. When comparing the genomes of various other organisms with human genomes, more than 1000 formerly unrecognized human genes are revealed. Furthermore, comparative genomics is a powerful tool for both interpreting the human genome as well as understand major events in the origin of genera and species.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Nomenclature==
===Origin===
[[Image:D-glyceraldehyde-2D-Fischer.png|100px|thumb|D-Glyceraldehyde]]

Glyceraldehyde serves as the basis in naming [[Structural Biochemistry/Carbohydrates/Monosaccharides|monosaccharides]] since it is the simplest monosaccharide, having only one asymmetric carbon.  (+)-Glyceraldehyde was arbitrarily named the D-enantiomer (the hydroxy group is on the right when drawn as a Fischer Projection).  Proof that the structure matched the optical rotation was not obtained until many years later.

===(+) and (-) enantiomers===
(+) enantiomers rotate plane-polarized light clockwise (also called dextrorotary, abbreviated ''d''), while (-) enantiomers rotate it counter-clockwise (levorotary, or ''l'').  This must be determined empirically.

===D and L enantiomers===
D and L enantiomers refer to the configurational stereochemistry of the molecule.  L isomers have the hydroxy group attached to the left side of the asymmetric carbon furthest from the carbonyl, while D isomers have the hydroxy group on the right side.  Naturally occurring sugars are D isomers.  This system of nomenclature is NOT necessarily the same as optical rotation (D and L are not the same as ''d'' and ''l''). In other words, D and L configurations do not fully designate absolute stereochemistry, rather they are determined on the basis of the anomeric carbon center and how its orientation compares to glyceraldehyde, the most basic and simple chiral sugar molecule.

===R and S enantiomers===
[[Image:Glucose stereochemistry.jpg|thumb|D-Glucose|100px]]

Like naming sugars based on D and L, the asymmetric carbon furthest the carbonyl is the one that determines the name.

All D sugars are R isomers because they all have the hydroxy group attached to the right of the last asymmetric carbon.  By the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules for naming stereochemistry, the hydroxy group will always be priority 1, the carbon of the primary alcohol (the terminal carbon) will always be priority 3, the rest of the carbon chain will be priority 2, leaving hydrogen as priority 4 (as shown below).  With the hydroxy on the right, the carbon of interest will always be an R isomer.

The example on the right shows D-Glucose with priorities of each substituent numbered.  When rotated to view down the C-H bond, the priorities decrease in a clockwise fashion, hence that stereocenter is designated R. However, the enantiomer of D-glucose, the priorities decrease in a counterclockwise fashtion indicating that the stereocenter is designated S.

==Fischer Stereochemistry Proof==
 
	Herman Emil Fischer presented the stereochemical configuration relationship in sugar through a series of experiments with ribose. At the time when this experiment was conducted, all they had was optical rotation to determine stereochemistry. Optical rotation assigns (+) for one enantiomer and (-) for the opposite one. However there were no direct correlations with (+/-) and (R/S) for all chiral sugars. For example, for a particular sugar, the R form may be (+) and the S form (-), but in another sugar, the R may be (-) and the S form (+). Fischer was able to manipulate a series of reactions to assign stereochemistry among sugars.
	At first he just assumed the penultimate position of the experimental arabinose was in R-configuration. He had a 50/50 chance of picking the correct conformation and if, in the future, the experimental arabinose turn out to be in L form, all his data is still relatively correct, just inverted. Luckily, the arabinose was later proved to be in D-conformation.

[[Image:Fischer1.JPG|500px]] 

Under the Kiliani-Fischer synthesis condition, arabinose will produce two epimeric sugars, mannose and glucose. Although it remained unknown which one was glucose and which one was mannose.

[[Image:Fischers2.JPG|500px]]

	By adding the HNO¬¬3 to arabinose, arabinose will be oxidized into an optically active aldaric acid. Out of the four possible aldaric acid derivatives from a set R penultimate configuration, two were eliminated because they were not optically active. The two remaining candidates’ C2 have the same S stereocenter configuration.

[[Image:Fischer3.JPG|500px]]

Possible aldaric acid

[[Image:Fischer4.JPG|500px]]

Next, mannose and glucose were oxidized by HCO3. Mannaric acid and glucaric acid were also optically active. With only one unknown stereocenter, there are two possible forms of aldaric acid for each sugar. Out of the four total predictions of glucose and mannose, one of the aldaric acids is meson and therefore cannot be either Mannaric or glucaric acid. Mannaric acid and glucaric acid should have the same stereocenters except for the inverted C2 stereocenter. When one of the models below was rejected, the other model whose C4 is in an S configuration was also rejected. Below, the two circled aldaric acids are mannaric acid and glucaric acid.

[[Image:Fischer5.JPG|500px]]

[[Image:Fischer6.JPG|500px]]

	The last part of the Fischer proof was to figure out which one is actually glucose. The last clue to Fischer’s proof was that, while glucaric acid can be derived from two sugars, mannaric acid can only be derived from the oxidation of mannose, because mannaric acid is rotationally symmetrical.

==Haworth projection==
Haworth projection is used to present cyclic hemiacetals.
These followings are steps to convert monosacharides to cyclic hemiacetals:
#Choose the position for the oxygen
##The oxygen is in the back right-hand corner of the ring (for six-membered ring.)
##The oxygen is away from the viewer (for five-membered ring.)
#The left of the oxygen is C5 with the hydroxymethyl group drawn up.
#The right of the oxygen is C1 with hydroxyl group drawn up or down depending on the α or β structure.
#–OH groups on the right side of the Fischer projection is drawn down.
#–OH groups on the left side of the Fischer projection is drawn up.

==D&amp;L enantiomers==

If these positions are switched, you will instead have the L (-) enantiomer of glyceraldehdye. For [[Structural Biochemistry/Carbohydrates/Monosaccharides|monosaccharides]], D and L will be used as prefixes instead of R and S, respectively, in regards to stereochemistry.
The stereochemistry of all other monosaccharides can be determined by comparing their Fischer projections to that of D-(+)-Glyceraldehyde. This can be done by examining the stereocenter in the monosaccharide closest to the terminal carbon (the highest-numbered stereocenter)and comparing its configuration to that of glygeraldehyde. That is, if the hydroxy group is on the right, it will be named D- and if the hydroxy group is on the left it will be named L-. It is important to note that for all monosaccharides other than glyceraldehyde, the labels D and L do not necessarily say anything about its optical rotation. For instance, D-Glucose and D-Gulose have both been assigned the stereochemical label D due to their highest-numbered stereocenter (the chiral center furthest from the carbonyl group) having a hydroxy group on the right in their Fischer projections despite Glucose having a positive (dextro-) optical rotation and Gulose having a negative (levo-) optical rotation.

==Alpha vs Beta Anomers==
[http://chem.pdx.edu/~wamserc/CH332S96/14gifs/14f.gif]

Hexoses and pentoses can convert to cyclic pyranoses or furanoses. As these monosaccharides convert between their linear and cyclic formations, the hydroxyl group on the anomeric carbon can attack on either side of the carbonyl of C1(as shown in image above). If the hydroxyl group is pointed in the opposite direction of the CH2OH group, the ring is in its alpha form. However if it is pointed in the same direction, the ring is in its beta form.

==Diastereomers and Epimers==

Two non-identical monosaccharides are said to be '''diastereomers''' if they are of the same type (either both aldoses or both ketoses), have the same stereochemistry at their highest-numbered stereocenter, and have the same number of carbons (i.e. are both tetroses). This is because having the same stereochemistry at their highest-numbered asymmetric carbon ensures that the two non-identical monosachharides will not be mirror images of each other and are therefore not enantiomers. Two monosaccharides that are diastereomers that have differing stereochemistry at only 1 asymmetric carbon (this carbon cannot be the highest-numbered asymmetric carbon) are called '''epimers'''. For instance, D-Glucose and D-Mannose are both epimers and diastereomers, while D-Glucose and D-Galactose are only diastereomers.

==Conformational Isomers==

Hexoses and pentoses that have converted into pyranoses or furanoses take on either chair, boat, or envelope conformations due to the tetrahedral geometry of their carbons. Pyranose rings can form either '''chair''' or '''boat''' conformational isomers (conformers) while furanose rings take on the '''envelope''' (also called half-boat) conformation. Substituents on the carbons in the monosaccharides are now either in axial or equatorial positions. The favored conformational isomer will be that which is the least sterically hindered, often containing the majority of its bulkier substituents in equatorial positions, since substituents in axial positions on the same side of the ring create steric hindrance. The chair conformation of pyranose rings can also undergo a '''ring flip''', which switches the orientation of substituents from axial to equatorial and vice-versa, to produce an additional conformational isomer. Chair conformation of six-membered rings is most favorable as it reduces steric interference between two carbon substituents. Boat and Envelope conformations do not exist, but are theorized to act as an intermediate structure existing briefly between a ring flip transition in which axial substituents become equatorial and vice versa.

      <text xml:space="preserve">''''''Waltz'''''', or ''valse'' from the German term, is a piece of music in triple meter, most often 3/4 but sometimes 3/8 or 6/4. A waltz has a 1.2.3. - 1.2.3. count and (generally) a slow tempo. Waltzes typically have one chord per measure, with the root of the chord as the first note.

Classical composers traditionally supplied music for dancing when required, and Schubert's waltzes were written for household dancing, without any pretense at being art music. However, Chopin's 19 waltzes (five he wrote as a child), along with his mazurkas and polonaises, were clearly not intended to be danced to. They marked the adoption of the waltz and other dance forms as serious composition genres.

Other notable contributions to the waltz genre in classical music include 16 by Brahms (originally for piano duet), and Ravel's Valses nobles et sentimentales for piano and La Valse for orchestra.

The waltz style is found in nearly every kind of European and Euro-American folk music and also in classical music. Although waltzes are often associated with the dance of the same name, not all waltzes were composed as dances: some were written for concert performance.

The waltz had once held so much importance in European music circles that great waltz composers received the honorary title of “Waltz King”. The title came with an accompanying “royal staff”, a decorated silver baton which was passed from musician to musician. Johann Strauss Junior, the most famous “Waltz King”, received the title frequently.

Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]], a collection of open-content textbooks!

You should consider [[Special:Userlogin|creating an account or logging in]]. Here are some advantages:

* The use of a username of your choice.
* Greater security and privacy, as your IP address will be hidden from most users.
* You get your own personal user page and talk page, instead of having to share it.
* [[Special:Contributions/{{PAGENAME}}|Your contributions]] will be recognized as your own, and not confused with anyone else's.
* The use of your own watchlist which shows when pages you are interested in have been edited.
* Your opinions carry greater weight in the [[Wikibooks:Decision making|decision making process]].
* You become a recognized member of the Wikibooks community.
* Creating an account is easy and only takes a few minutes of your time, especially given the benefits.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikibookian and [[Special:Userlogin|create an account]].&lt;br/&gt;
Feel free to ask any questions on my talk page or in the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading room]].&lt;br/&gt;
Be sure to sign your posts and comments on talk pages with four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;),
this will let other editors know you said it.&lt;br/&gt;

| &lt;!-- this is so if anyone tries to use it where it doesn't go they will know. --&gt;

== Correction to original work cited ==

I have just edited the article to which you have contributed to show that the origin of the content was from Millennium Relativity and not Special Relativity.  I have no objection to the findings being presented in Wikibooks as long as the credit is properly given the millennium relativity papers in which they were originally introduced.  I remind you, these are copyrighted works.  Joseph A. Rybczyk [[User:Rybczyk|Rybczyk]] ([[User talk:Rybczyk|talk]]) 14:13, 19 October 2008 (UTC)

To Mike,
The whole reason for the Millennium Relativity web site is to publish the papers that make up the millennium theory of relativity because peer-review journals refused to publish the initial works.  This is also the reason that all of the millennium papers are on file (registered) with the US Copyright Office.  I.e. to protect my rights since the science journals refused to do it by way of publishing the works.  Moreover, the paper, Time and Energy, in which the relativistic acceleration treatment was first introduced in 2001, forms the basis of one of five proposals I have on file with the US National Science Foundation.  My point is that the findings presented in these papers including the dates of the discoveries are well protected by several other means.

As you most likely know, the special theory of relativity has been around for over 100 years.  It is well known that Special Relativity does not deal with acceleration.  That in fact was the ultimate purpose of General Relativity.  If Einstein developed the treatment being contested, let the poster, Carandol, cite it specifically.  I.e. where in special relativity or other Einstein paper?  If the treatment was developed by some other author prior to my findings being published in 2001, including by Carandol himself, let him cite the paper and produce poof of when it was published.

In summary, I don’t object to my original findings being cited in the works of others as long as it is done in a proper and legal manner and not as a ploy to attribute the credit to themselves or anyone else including Einstein himself.

==The request for help addressing content/organization problems in the book &quot;US history&quot;==
seemed to be deleted from the bulletin board.  Did I post the request in the right place?  I am trying to avert any incivil feelings from happening when our WV project &quot;United we stand&quot; is submitted to wikibooks.

The course instructor is thinks the current &quot;US history&quot; book is quite inadequate for the job.  I'm take a NPOV on that.  I'll just observe that it is wikimedia way to Build on previous efforts not replace them.  

the best way to do this, is to find someone willing to speak for the project and the project.  I've already posted information on my talk page and in the talk page of the book.--[[User:JoliePA|JoliePA]] ([[User talk:JoliePA|talk]]) 19:54, 21 October 2008 (UTC)

:::*AP is a stub, US History is a developed book
:::*Since our purpose is Carefully defined by the college board, we feel it our duty to be ruthlessly exact with our discussion and not get caught up in tangents and to have a very careful NPOV
:::*Whatever we adopt, the first chapter+ will completely go
::::*thats the key then, we're not ''adding'' or merely ''modifying'', we're gutting whats there! it doesn't meet our purpose

:::Geo, I think is worried about getting rid of past WB contributions that might hold some value to people that worked research and describe US history (however falling short on the college board requirement)
:::However, I think that since both books fail to meet the objective we have an ethical right to do whatever modifications neccesary to meet that value.

My writings might not be inspired but I can keep on topic, and try to keep sensational material out of a textbook.

Well, ''trying'' to take a wikibreak might be more accurate &lt;tt&gt;:D&lt;/tt&gt; I think making massive changes to [[US History]] is probably the best choice here. (And if a rename is in order, so be it) As I said, that text has received lots of criticism; I don't think anyone will be upset to see someone bring it up to standard (in fact, rather the opposite). So, your plan to adopt [[US History]] sounds great! Again, I don't know the subject matter, but I do know Wikibooks, so I'll be happy to help out with &quot;operational&quot; stuff as required. I look forward to working with you both; it's always great to see authors with a plan of action. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:23, 24 October 2008 (UTC)

== Procedure and clarity ==
I saw the notice to vote on the bot policy (top of the window). I ask you to fallow the normal procedure [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines/Vote]], and present a locked version for approval (changes can continue to be added but the proposed text will be fixed and reversible if a mid discussion alteration is made that changes the tone of the text in any way), this way is clearer, cleaner and less prone to confusion. 
I also state that I strongly object making this text a policy on the same grounds I presented. There is no clear motive to impart on it the enforcible/no challenge characteristic of a policy seems to be present. Even by what I read from WK last post on the topic he seems not to object to the spirit but places some doubts on the procedure (who does what), in my view rushing the text to a vote at present will not be productive .  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 06:42, 23 October 2008 (UTC)
:If you think we need to use a /Vote subpage for the sake of using one, you can do so yourself. However I don't see a problem with the location of the current discussion, and I've explained already why I chose that location - it's not random.
:I'll add a permalink to the version we're considering shortly, though I don't see the need. Nobody has made sweeping changes to the proposal, and if they did, it wouldn't be the end of the world - we would simply note the changes and decide whether we like them. Since it's not a straight-up vote (but rather a discussion) we're not so constrained as you imply.
:I'm not rushing anything - if discussion determines that clarification is needed (ie clarifying the procedural aspects, which I view as advisory in any case - which I could explain if you'd like) then we will make those changes. If you have objections they should be made in the discussion (as you've done already), where everyone will see them, and we can take those into account - perhaps we will change the proposal to fix some problem you found with it, or perhaps everyone else will think it is a trivial issue not worth spending further time considering, or maybe something in between.

::I don't particularly think fragmenting discussions on a topic on several pages is useful and will indubitably prevent keeping a historical background on all that was said about the topic. In this case I'm not talking about the discussion but the vote part, there are established procedures to run that, I don't see any reason for you to be redefining that, when you are calling for the approval of a police you are moving for a vote. What I said is that if you think the text is ready for the vote part please use the way it has been done in the past. The location is important, it uses a consistent structure, establishes a clear timetable for the approval, it promotes participation (having it run on an administrative area will turn some people off) and permits the procedure to be archived.

== Still culling the draft ==
I've noticed some parts of only historical significance but that serve no useful purpose on the text, useful information to redefine old uses but that probably shouldn't be kept in the text. One example [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Bots/Unstable#Flood_flag_or_bot_flag.3F here].  I think I removed another one.&lt;br&gt;
The first lines of the text even if important, could be removed.  The one dealing with bot is not replicated on the bot section (it should be moved there) and the others simply restate something that is said on the specific location (flood and bot flag section).  I would remove these last two also and use something like what is stated on the key features on the vote section as an introduction.&lt;br&gt;
Taking in consideration Darklamas last post, reordering the sections may reduce restatements that now exist. As an example, [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Bots/Unstable#Common_problems this] should come after defining all bots since it applies to all and can probably merge parts that are common on each of the full and semi automatically definitions...&lt;br&gt;
I also noticed that you never define the bot operator on its own section (a minimum experience level/edits could be set, since this would be an addition to the text it should be discussed on the vote page) and every enforcement stipulated only affects the bot account not the operator (or at least I didn't notice it). A bot can do unwanted things by accident but also by intention the first is covered by the bot block (mentioned on the draft) but it should mention also that malicious use of the a bot (with flag or not would  get enforced action also on the operators account, if not declared by the IP information, something on those lines.&lt;br&gt;
It would be also useful to block access to bots (all) to specific sections (userspaces if not the operator and without consent and probably other special pages).&lt;br&gt;
Not revolutionary changes but something that would probably improve the overall quality, take a look if you have the time.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 04:09, 26 October 2008 (UTC)

Can you please confirm I have done everything correctly?  This is part of a class project, so I really want to make sure I have satisifed all requirements.  Thanks!  Tish [[User:Ehawk008|Ehawk008]] ([[User talk:Ehawk008|talk]]) 03:03, 28 October 2008 (UTC)

Hi, I tagged [[Bad Science]] with &quot;query&quot; as it appeared to be in a pretty bad shape and then removed my tag in reply to [[User:Ewen]]'s request. I guess we should keep a watch on the page looking for improvement.

By the way, I don't wish to use IRC right now as I haven't used it earlier and I am not sure how I can mask my IP.

== losethegame.com blacklisting ==

hey :) i'm having trouble unifying my account as it says that there is a Jessi1989 account on de.wikipedia.org although when i look at http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benutzer:Jessi1989... &quot;Diese Benutzerseite existiert noch nicht&quot;! anyway, i'd like to discuss with you your decline of the recent unblacklisting request for losethegame.com. the only other contributor to the discussion, ohnoitsjamie, claimed that the site was blacklisted because of a spamming campaign by the site's owner over the past 3 years. you apparently took his word for this because you declined it with the reason &quot;per ohnoitsjamie&quot;. however, i can't find any evidence of this spamming campaign, which isn't mentioned in the blacklisting reason, so i asked ohnoitsjamie to provide some diffs to support his statement. the only evidence he could provide were the contributions of user:jonty303 who added the site to 14 pages in feb 2006 and hasn't made any edits since, over 18 months prior to when the blacklisting took place. he also stated that the site has been blacklisted &quot;for several years&quot;, which is not true. it was blacklisted [http://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Spam_blacklist&amp;diff=694521&amp;oldid=694374 here], in october 2007. do you think you could look into this issue further? i only wanted to use something hosted on this site as a reference, but after reading the guidelines for blacklisting, i'm inclined to believe it should not have been blacklisted in the first place. i'm not sure why ohnoitsjamie seems so keen for it to remain blacklisted. please see our recent discussion [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Ohnoitsjamie#losethegame.com_spamming here] for more details. thanks Jessi1989 [[Special:Contributions/61.5.149.187|61.5.149.187]] ([[User talk:61.5.149.187|talk]]) 19:18, 13 November 2008 (UTC)

A lot of the original contents are specific to the Berlingo Electrique and not even the Berlingo petrol/diesel. I cant see how it is related to the XM at all.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|What is a mobile worker?}}

Today corporations of all sizes are undergoing a significant transformation, and we are witnessing the emergence and integration of a truly global mobile network. With the recent ‘incorporation of unified communications and advances in wireless technology’, opportunities for companies to integrate mobile workers into the organization has arisen (Kerravala, 2). 
A mobile worker is “anyone who performs their work in multiple locations such as customer sites, company offices, their homes, vendor offices, planes and hotels” (Richman, Noble &amp; Johnson, 9). Whether the employee is working from home or across the globe they have the ability to remotely access all of the information, tools and communication capabilities of the corporate office instantaneously. A recent study issued by Cisco Systems Inc. projected figures showing that by 2009 one-quarter of the world’s working population will be a mobile worker. (Hakala, 1)

Mainly ‘the proliferation of high-speed networks, widespread public Wi-FI and fixed mobile convergence’ has made telecommuting, the ability to work from anywhere and at anytime, a possible reality (Williams, 1). However, the phenomenon has also spurred from employees demands of work-family balance plans (allowing more flexibility), and concerns over the lack of opportunities for those with disabilities and women. In addition, companies want to take advantage of the progressions in society to capitalize on their main resources, their employees, in order to maximize productivity and generate higher profits. 

==Issues That May Arise==
No matter what type of mobile worker you are classified as, working from different locations brings similar concerns and problems. With the ability for the office to communicate with you at any time and in any location there is a tendency for workers to become on-call “twenty-four seven”. Stress levels increase as workloads rise and employers hold higher standards and expectations for their employees. Those employees who spend larger portions of time out of the office may start to feel isolated, as the social aspect of their job has significantly decreased. As well, less face-time with superiors may result in lower pay, slower promotions and loss of fringe benefits. 

Another issue that arises when dealing with mobile workers is security. Working with an array of technologically advanced devices and programs brings with it problems of data loss, fraud and other security breaches. Today the majority of business employees carry laptop computers and mobile handhelds with them at all time. With a drastic increase of communication taking place through e-mails or instant messaging, users must be aware of the potential for hackers as well as messages or attachments from unverified sources that may contain viruses. In addition, the wireless network can also be a threat when logging on to unknown sources of wireless Internet access (Hines, 1). 

These two issues become interrelated when employee health can be affected by the use of computer devices. Recently, concern has been raised because as mobile workers spend a larger percentage of time using mobile devices, they are more susceptible to radiation affects and nerve or joint problems such as carpel tunnel syndrome. These issues which accompany mobile working are only amplified by employees becoming engrossed in the task at hand, and focusing on getting their work done as quickly as possible. In both cases it is the company’s responsibility to make sure that their employees are following standard health and safety guidelines as well as complying with strict policies to protect company information contained on technology devices. Since supervision of remote employees is more difficult, it may add costs. The proper measures must be taken by the company, however, in order to reap the benefits. 

== Future ==
When mobile workers are used to their potential the advantages for any business far out way the problems they may encounter. “The cycle of mobile technology is self-perpetuation. As tools mature the number of employees in each of these mobile classes will continue to increase” (Chickowski, 6). With the mobile population already at 650 million worldwide in 2004 projections show that by next year the mobile work force will constitute more than 850 million. (International Data Corp., 1) It is apparent that the mobile worker is starting to become the norm, and as technology continues to evolve and connectivity becomes ubiquitous, mobility will only flourish.

{{fsharpTitle|Control Flow}}

In all programming languages, '''control flow''' refers to the decisions made in code that affect the order in which statements are executed in an application. F#'s imperative control flow elements are similar to those encountered in other languages.

== Imperative Programming in a Nutshell ==

Most programmers coming from a C#, Java, or C++ background are familiar with an imperative style of programming which uses loops, mutable data, and functions with side-effects in applications. While F# primarily encourages the use of a functional programming style, it has constructs which allow programmers to write code in a more imperative style as well. Imperative programming can be useful in the following situations:

* Interacting with many objects in the .NET Framework, most of which are inherently imperative.
* Interacting with components that depend heavily on side-effects, such as GUIs, I/O, and sockets.
* Scripting and prototyping snippets of code.
* Initializing complex data structures.
* Optimizing blocks of code where an imperative version of an algorithm is more efficient than the functional version.

== &lt;code&gt;if/then&lt;/code&gt; Decisions ==
F#'s &lt;code&gt;if/then/elif/else&lt;/code&gt; construct has already been seen earlier in this book, but to introduce it more formally, the &lt;code&gt;if/then&lt;/code&gt; construct has the following syntaxes:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
(* simple if *)
if expr then
    expr

(* binary if *)
if expr then
    expr
else
    expr

(* multiple else branches *)
if expr then
    expr
elif expr then
    expr
elif expr then
    expr
...
else
    expr&lt;/source&gt;

Like all F# blocks, the scope of an &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statement extends to any code indented under it. For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
open System

let printMessage condition =
    if condition then
        printfn &quot;condition = true: inside the 'if'&quot;
    printfn &quot;outside the 'if' block&quot;

let main() =
    printMessage true
    printfn &quot;--------&quot;
    printMessage false
    Console.ReadKey(true) |&gt; ignore
 
main()&lt;/source&gt;

This program prints:
&lt;pre&gt;condition = true: inside the 'if'
outside the 'if' block
--------
outside the 'if' block&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Working With Conditions ===
F# has three boolean operators:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Symbol
! Description
! Example
|-
| &lt;code&gt;&amp;&amp;&lt;/code&gt;
| Logical AND (infix, short-circuited)
| &lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;true &amp;&amp; false (* returns false *)&lt;/source&gt;
|-
| &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;||&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
| Logical OR (infix, short-circuited)
| &lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;true || false (* returns true *)&lt;/source&gt;
|-
| &lt;code&gt;not&lt;/code&gt;
| Logical NOT
| &lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;not false (* returns true *)&lt;/source&gt;
|}

The &lt;code&gt;&amp;&amp;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;||&lt;/code&gt; operators are short-circuited, meaning the CLR will perform the minimum evaluation necessary to determine whether the condition will succeed or fail. For example, if the left side of an &lt;code&gt;&amp;&amp;&lt;/code&gt; evaluates to &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;, then there is no need to evaluate the right side; likewise, if the left side of a &lt;code&gt;||&lt;/code&gt; evaluates to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;, then there is no need to evaluate the right side of the expression.

Here is a demonstration of short-circuiting in F#:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
open System

let alwaysTrue() =
    printfn &quot;Always true&quot;
    true
    
let alwaysFalse() =
    printfn &quot;Always false&quot;
    false

let main() =
    let testCases = 
        [&quot;alwaysTrue &amp;&amp; alwaysFalse&quot;, fun() -&gt; alwaysTrue() &amp;&amp; alwaysFalse();
         &quot;alwaysFalse &amp;&amp; alwaysTrue&quot;, fun() -&gt; alwaysFalse() &amp;&amp; alwaysTrue();
         &quot;alwaysTrue || alwaysFalse&quot;, fun() -&gt; alwaysTrue() || alwaysFalse();
         &quot;alwaysFalse || alwaysTrue&quot;, fun() -&gt; alwaysFalse() || alwaysTrue();]
    
    testCases |&gt; List.iter (fun (msg, res) -&gt;
        printfn &quot;%s: %b&quot; msg (res())
        printfn &quot;-------&quot;)
    
    Console.ReadKey(true) |&gt; ignore
 
main()&lt;/source&gt;
The &lt;code&gt;alwaysTrue&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;alwaysFalse&lt;/code&gt; methods return &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; respectively, but they also have a side-effect of printing a message to the console whenever the functions are evaluated.

This program outputs the following:
&lt;pre&gt;Always true
Always false
alwaysTrue &amp;&amp; alwaysFalse: false
-------
Always false
alwaysFalse &amp;&amp; alwaysTrue: false
-------
Always true
alwaysTrue || alwaysFalse: true
-------
Always false
Always true
alwaysFalse || alwaysTrue: true
-------&lt;/pre&gt;

As you can see above, the expression &lt;code&gt;alwaysTrue &amp;&amp; alwaysFalse&lt;/code&gt; evaluates both sides of the expression. &lt;code&gt;alwaysFalse &amp;&amp; alwaysTrue&lt;/code&gt; only evaluates the left side of the expression; since the left side returns &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;, its unnecessary to evaluate the right side.

== &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; Loops Over Ranges ==
&lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loops are traditionally used to iterate over a well-defined integer range. The syntax of a &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loop is defined as:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
for var = start-expr to end-expr do
    ... // loop body&lt;/source&gt;

Here's a trivial program which prints out the numbers 1 - 10:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
let main() =
    for i = 1 to 10 do
        printfn &quot;i: %i&quot; i
main()&lt;/source&gt;

This program outputs:
&lt;pre&gt;i: 1
i: 2
i: 3
i: 4
i: 5
i: 6
i: 7
i: 8
i: 9
i: 10&lt;/pre&gt;

This code takes input from the user to compute an average:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
open System

let main() =
    Console.WriteLine(&quot;This program averages numbers input by the user.&quot;)
    Console.Write(&quot;How many numbers do you want to add? &quot;)
    
    let mutable sum = 0
    let numbersToAdd = Console.ReadLine() |&gt; int
    
    for i = 1 to numbersToAdd do
        Console.Write(&quot;Input #{0}: &quot;, i)
        let input = Console.ReadLine() |&gt; int
        sum &lt;- sum + input
    
    let average = sum / numbersToAdd
    Console.WriteLine(&quot;Average: {0}&quot;, average)
        
main()&lt;/source&gt;

This program outputs:
 This program averages numbers input by the user.
 How many numbers do you want to add? &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
 Input #1: &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;
 Input #2: &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;90&lt;/span&gt;
 Input #3: &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;50&lt;/span&gt;
 Average: 80

== &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; Loops Over Collections and Sequences ==
Its often convenient to iterate over collections of items using the syntax:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
for pattern in expr do
    ... // loop body
&lt;/source&gt;

For example, we can print out a shopping list in fsi:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
&gt; let shoppingList =
    [&quot;Tofu&quot;, 2, 1.99;
    &quot;Seitan&quot;, 2, 3.99;
    &quot;Tempeh&quot;, 3, 2.69;
    &quot;Rice milk&quot;, 1, 2.95;];;

val shoppingList : (string * int * float) list

&gt; for (food, quantity, price) in shoppingList do
    printfn &quot;food: %s, quantity: %i, price: %g&quot; food quantity price;;
food: Tofu, quantity: 2, price: 1.99
food: Seitan, quantity: 2, price: 3.99
food: Tempeh, quantity: 3, price: 2.69
food: Rice milk, quantity: 1, price: 2.95&lt;/source&gt;

== &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; Loops ==
As the name suggests, &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; loops will repeat a block of code indefinitely while a particular condition is true. The syntax of a &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; loop is defined as follows:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
while expr do
    ... // loop body&lt;/source&gt;

We use a while loop when we don't know how many times to execute a block of code. For example, lets say we wanted the user to guess a password to a secret area; the user could get the password right on the first try, or the user could try millions of passwords, we just don't know. Here is a short program that requires a user to guess a password correctly in at least 3 attempts:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
open System

let main() =
    let password = &quot;monkey&quot;
    let mutable guess = String.Empty
    let mutable attempts = 0
    
    while password &lt;&gt; guess &amp;&amp; attempts &lt; 3 do
        Console.Write(&quot;What's the password? &quot;)
        attempts &lt;- attempts + 1
        guess &lt;- Console.ReadLine()
        
    if password = guess then
        Console.WriteLine(&quot;You got the password right!&quot;)
    else
        Console.WriteLine(&quot;You didn't guess the password&quot;)
        
    Console.ReadKey(true) |&gt; ignore
    
        
main()&lt;/source&gt;

This program outputs the following:
 What's the password? &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;kitty&lt;/span&gt;
 What's the password? &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;monkey&lt;/span&gt;
 You got the password right!

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[../Parts of the cell/]] The cell membrane is very important, because it works as a selective filter that allows only certain things to come inside or go outside the cell, it act as a body guard for our body.It can maintain a stable and healthy environment for cell in order to keep people healthy.  

plant cell membranes are rigid walls, and animal cell membranes are lipid bilayers.

[[image:bilayer.png|thumb|400px|Plasma membrane bilayer]]

The phospholipid bilayer which the cell membrane is an example of, is composed of various cholesterol, [[Wikipedia:Phospholipid|phospholipids]], glycolipids, blagoscony and proteins. Below is an example of a simple [[Wikipedia:Phospholipid bilayer|phospholipid bilayer]].

[[image:small_bilayer.png]]

The smaller molecules shown between the [[Wikipedia:Phospholipid|phospholipids]] are [[Wikipedia:Cholesterol|Cholesterol]] molecules. They help to provide rigidity or stability to the membrane. The two main components of [[Wikipedia:Phospholipid|phospholipids]] are shown in these figures by blue circles representing the hydrophilic head groups and by long thin lines representing the hydrophobic fatty acid tails. 

Both the interior of the cell and the area surrounding the cell is made up of water or similar aqueous solution.  Consequently, phospholipids orient themselves with respect to the water and with each other so that the hydrophilic (&quot;water loving&quot;) head groups are grouped together and face the water, and the hydrophobic (&quot;water fearing&quot;) tails turn away from the water and toward each other.  This self-organization of [[Wikipedia:Phospholipid|phospholipids]] results in one of just a few easily recognizable structures. Cell membranes are constructed of a [[Wikipedia:Phospholipid bilayer|phospholipid bilayer]] as shown above.  

Smaller structures can also form, known as 'micelles' in which there is no ''inner'' layer of phospholipid. Instead, the interior of a micell is wholly hydrophobic, filled with the fatty acid chains of the phospholipids and any other hydrophobic molecule they enclose.  Micelles are not so important for the understanding of cellular structure, but are useful for demonstrating the principles of hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity, and for contrasting with lipid bilayers.  

At least 10 different types of lipids are commonly found in cell membranes. Each type of cell or organelle will have a different percentage of each lipid, protein and carbohydrate. The main types of lipids are:

* Cholesterol 
* Glycolipids 
* Phosphatidylcholine 
* Sphingomyelin 
* Phosphatidylethnolamine 
* Phosphatydilinositol 
* Phosphatidylserine 
* Phosphatidylglycerol 
* Diphosphatidylglycerol (Cardiolipin) 
* Phosphatidic acid

==The Cell Membrane is Asymmetric==
The cell membrane tends to have different composition on one side of the membrane than on the other side of the membrane. The differences can be caused by the different ratios or types of amphipathic lipid-based molecules, the different positioning of the proteins (facing in or facing out), or the fixed orientations of proteins spanning the membrane. Additionally, there are different enzymatic activities in the outer and inner membrane surfaces.

The reason the cell membrane is asymmetric is because when the proteins are synthesized by the preexisting membranes, they are inserted into the membrane in an asymmetric manner. The asymmetry of the cell membrane allows the membrane to be rigid and allows the cell to have a different intracellular environment from the existing extracellular environment.  Additionally, the cell membrane's phospholipids are distributed asymmetrically across the lipid bilayer, in a phenomenon called membrane phospholipid asymmetry. There are three mechanisms for transmembrane movement of phospholipids: 1) spontaneous diffusion, 2) facilitated diffusion, 3) ATP-dependent active translocation. 

The spontaneous diffusion is a form of passive transport. Because passive transport does not require energy to transport non-polar substances through the membrane, this can happen spontaneously. Facilitated diffusion, like spontaneous diffusion, is a form of passive transport. The molecules or ions in this diffusion pass through the membrane by using specific transmembrane transport proteins.

'''Membrane transport of small molecules''' 
Because animal membrane proteins are lipid bilayer which are inner hydrophobic, this character prohibits polar molecules. Transport proteins can provide help for this situation. It can transport polar molecules across the membrane. There are several types of membrane transport proteins. They are uniports and cotransport. Uniports can move solutes from one side to another, change the position of the proteins. Cotransport systems can simultaneously sending two solutes across the lipid bilayer. Solutes are sent in the same direction or opposite directions Transport proteins does not need to be acts natural direction.
 

'''Membrane Transport of Macromolecules'''
Membrane transport of Macromolecules can divide into two parts, they are exocytosis and endocytosis. In exocytosis, the contents of vesicles are released when the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane. There are five steps involved, which are vesicle trafficking, vesicke tethering, vesicle docking, vesicle priming and vesicle fusion. In endocytosis the membrane depresses and pinches off, enclosing the molecule. In receptor-mediated endocytosis, coated pits and vesicles bind to specific receptors on the cell surface, allowing the cell to select what molecules to take and what to reject.

The Ploughman's Lunch is traditional British pub fare, a hearty cold meal featuring bread, cheese and pickle. Its history is not actually that old, and doesn't really date back to actual ploughmen - see [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ploughman%27s_lunch Wikipedia on Ploughman's lunch].

Arrange the following on a plate:

* A big chunk of good English cheese (e.g. Cheshire, Stilton, Lancashire), or a selection of two or three types of cheese if available
* A big doorstop of granary bread
* Butter
* Pickle (e.g. Branston pickle, or a good chunky local pickle)
* Lettuce leaves

Optionally you could also add half an apple, maybe some pickled onions too. A cocktail Pork Pie or a slice from a full sized one is often served. Sausage rolls are too.

= Slav accepted  4. ... dxc4 =
Moves: 1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. Nc3 dxc4

Black finally takes the sacrificial pawn with dxc4. This move has about half the popularity of the main line e6.  It threatens a pawn advance onto White's queenside. White usually plays 5. a4  to defend against 5 .. b5 which cements Black's hold on this side of the board and threatens a pawn advance onto White's queenside.

Using just a file with the &quot;.js&quot; extension in Windows, it's possible to run JScript code. Of course within this environment many of the commonly known HTML, DOM and DHTML elements are not available.
Instead, you have access to a different set of default tools, for system administrative tasks.

== Missing close brace ==
{{tlx|Editprotected}}
The last, i.e. second, time FULLCHAPTERNAME appears in the code, it is followed by only '''four''' close braces, but to match all the open braces, there should be '''five'''.  I found this because I was trying to figure out why pages categorized using &lt;nowiki&gt;{{BookCat}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; are listed on the category pages as being alphabetically under &quot;'''{'''&quot; &amp;mdash; for example, [[:Category:Conlang|here]].

(I also couldn't help noticing that the noinclude text says &quot;its&quot; where it means contraction &quot;it's&quot;.)

== Subcategories ==
A &quot;nice-to-have&quot; woud be, to extend the template with some sub-categories.
;example
:&lt;nowiki&gt;{{BookCat|Irish-Folk|Songs in English|Folk Songs}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
That would create in the [[Songbook]]:
:&lt;nowiki&gt;[[categorie:Songbook]] [[categorie:Songbook/Irish-Folk]] [[categorie:Songbook/Irish-Folk]] [[categorie:Songbook/Irish-Folk]] &lt;/nowiki&gt;
:Maybe a single parameter would be sufficient
:&lt;nowiki&gt;{{BookCat|Subcategory=Irish-Folk}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
the rest could be completed by an outer template
:&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Subcategory|Irish-Folk|Songs in English|Folk Songs}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
each parameter expand the output with &quot;/parameter value&quot;

 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{BookCat|{{{1}}}}}}{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;#if: {{{2|}}}|{{BookCat|{{{2}}}}}}}{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;#if: {{{3|}}}|{{BookCat|{{{3}}}}}}}{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Fluid Mosaic Model ==

The '''fluid mosaic model''' was originally proposed by S. Jonathan Singer and Garth Nicolson in  1972.  Their idea of this model was to show and describe the general structure of a biological membrane.  Biological membrane is composed of a '''lipid bilayer'''&quot; that is essentially a two-dimensional solution composed of lipids and proteins.  The lipid bilayer functions as both a solvent for integral proteins as well as a permeability barrier.

To break down each part of the name of the model: 
The fluidity of the model is based on the hydrophobic components like proteins and lipids.  These two components allow for the membrane to have a fluid motion since it is not solid; it is not made of only one type of macromolecule.  
The mosaic part of the name of the model is based on the fact that mosaics are created by using different pieces to obtain an overall picture.  The mosaic model consists of not just one type of integral component but rather multiple (such as glycoproteins or phospholipids).  Because of the model being made of different pieces, it creates a mosaic, hence the name.

== Proving the Fluid Mosaic Model==

=== Freeze Fracture &amp; Electron Micrographs ===

One aspect of the Fluid Mosaic Model is that membrane proteins are randomly distributed throughout the plane of the membrane due to their mobility (lateral diffusion). This was verified using electron microscopy to view lipid bilayers cleaved by freeze fracture.

The general outline of the technique is this:

'''1.''' Cells are frozen in liquid nitrogen.

'''2.''' Frozen cells are fractured using a knife. The fracture occurs on lines of weakness like between the lipid bilayer of the plasma membrane.

'''3.''' Freeze Etching uses a vacuum to remove surface ice.

'''4.''' The first part of making a replica is shadowing with platinum vapor at a 45-degree angle to the surface.

'''5.''' The next part of making a replica is evaporating a very thin layer of Carbon onto the surface at a 90-degree angle.

'''6.''' The final replica is revealed by degrading the organic cell material away with an acid or base.

'''7.''' The Carbon-Platinum replica is then studied under an electron microscope, and the pattern of membrane proteins is shown by the shadowed craters and bumps.


'''Freeze Fracture''' (along with metal shadowing and imaging via electron microscopy) is a technique that can be used to visualize membrane structure and protein distribution. First, a cell is rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen. Then it is cleaved along the fracture plane that splits the lipid bilayer. Separation along this plane exposes the proteins embedded in the membrane. After fracture, the two sections are coated/shadowed with a heavy metal like platinum. Acid is used next to dissolve the organic material, resulting in a replica of the surfaces of the sample. The replicas are then viewed with an electron microscope. The micrographs show bumps on the surface of the sample, which actually are transmembrane proteins since the surfaces of the sample's halves correspond to the inner faces of the phospholipid bilayer. This confirmed that membrane proteins are randomly dispersed throughout the phospholipid bilayer, and that there are integral transmembrane proteins that span the entire membrane.

== Lateral Diffusion ==

'''Lateral diffusion''' refers to the lateral movement of lipids and proteins found in the membrane.  Membrane lipids and proteins are generally free to move laterally if they are not restricted by certain interactions.  Lateral diffusion is a fairly quick and spontaneous process.


[[Image:Lateral Diffusion.JPG]]


Lateral diffusion can be tracked by a process called fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP).  This process is available because the use of fluorescence labeling allows the tracking of the molecules.  The cell surface will be labeled first with a chromophore, then analyzed under a fluorescence microscope on one section (illuminated area).  On this specific site, the fluoresced molecules are destroyed by bleaching them (use of laser) and watching if they leave or enter the illuminated area.  If the molecules are mobile, it has two different states, bleached or unbleached.
If the molecule is leaving the illuminated area, this means that the molecule is bleached.  If the molecule is entering the illuminated area, this means that the molecules is unbleached.  The unbleached molecules help to increase the fluorescence intensity.

Lateral diffusion can also be measured by a complementary strategy know as fluorescence loss in photo-bleaching (FLIP). In this technique, a small area is continuously bleached and the fluorescent proteins are bleached as they diffuse into it. Eventually, the number of fluorescent proteins will decrease and will result in all bleached proteins. From both FRAP and FLIP, we can calculate the diffusion coefficient from the bleached proteins.

Although these two techniques seem promising, it has some drawbacks. One problem is that individual movement of each protein cannot be observed because there are too many bleached/fluorescent proteins. For example, one cannot tell whether each individual protein is immobile or if it's only restricted to a small area, perhaps by cytoskeleton impediment. 
In order to circumvent this problem, a technique known as Single-particle tracking can be used. In this technique, an individual protein is labeled by antibodies and are colored by fluorescent dye or small gold specks. The movement of these proteins are then recorded by video microscopy. Using this technique allows one to observe the diffusion pathway of a protein periodically.

== Transverse Diffusion ==

'''Transverse diffusion''' or '''flip-flop''' involves the movement of a lipid or protein from one membrane surface to the other.  Unlike lateral diffusion, transverse diffusion is a fairly slow process due to the fact that a relatively significant amount of energy is required for flip-flopping to occur.  Most large proteins do not flip-flop due to their extensive polar regions, which are unfavorable in the hydrophobic core of a membrane bilayer.  This allows the asymmetry of membranes to be retained for long periods, which is an important aspect of cell regulation.

In many cells, there will be protein constituents that help with the &quot;flip-flop&quot; process. This can be seen through comparing the flip-flop rate of a man-made lipid bilayer&quot; versus a natural bilayer. The flip-flop rate of the man-made lipid bilayer is so slow that it can be considered to be idle as compared to the natural bilayer, indicating the existence of something in the natural bilayer that helps with process of &quot;flipping&quot;. The flip-flop rate of phospholipids in the biological membranes is far greater than that in the artificial lipid membranes because biological membranes have protein constituents such as flipase and phospholipid translocases that accelerate the rate at which phospholipids move from one side of the bilayer to the other one.     


[[Image:Tranverse Diffusion.JPG]]

== Control of Fluidity ==

The fluidity of membranes determines the extent to which molecules can be transported and signals can be transducted through the membrane.  Membrane fluidity is a function of its '''fatty acid''' and '''cholesterol''' content.  Fatty acid chains may be ordered and rigid or disordered and fluid which affects the fluidity of the membrane in which they are contained.  Long fatty acid chains are able to form stronger intermolecular interactions which restrict fluidity.  Bends and kinks in the fatty acid chains formed as a result of unsaturated ''cis'' and ''trans'' double bonds may interfere with intermolecular interactions which promotes fluidity.  Membrane fluidity can therefore be controlled by varying the number of double bonds and the length of fatty acid chains.  Meanwhile, the presence of bulky cholesterol molecules within the membrane restrict fluidity.

Cholesterol is the key regulator of membrane fluidity in animals.  It is able to interact with and form specific complexes with phospholipids that are called lipid rafts that concentrate in specific regions of the membranes.  Lipid rafts result in moderation of membrane fluidity which causes the membranes to be less fluid while also making them less vulnerable to phase transitions.  Cholesterol is comprised of a steroid with an -OH hydroxy group conjugated at one end and a hydrocarbon chain at the other.  The rings of the steroid and the hydrocarbon chain are able to insert themselves into the phospholipid bilayer of the membrane and participate in hydrophobic interactions while the polar hydroxy group interacts with the polar head groups of the surrounding phospholipids.

== Melting Temperature ==

The extent of fluidity can be determined by the membrane's '''melting temperature'''.  As heat is increased, the membrane makes a sharp transition from a rigid state to a more fluid state.  A low melting temperature indicates the presence of fatty acids that promote fluidity while a high melting temperature indicates the presence of fatty acids and cholesterol that restrict fluidity. 

[[Image:Membrane_Fluidity_1.JPG‎ ]]

The melting temperature can also be affected by the ability of the molecule to pack themselves.  Characteristics such as saturation, double bonds (''cis'' or ''trans''), and length of the fatty acid chain will affect the melting temperature.  When comparing saturation versus unsaturation, the saturated fatty acid will have a higher melting temperature because the residues will react with each other causing the fatty acid to be in a more rigid state. The specific type of double bonds also affect the melting temperature.  ''Cis'' double bonds will have a lower melting point compared to ''trans'' double bonds because they cannot pack themselves into a crystal as well as ''trans'' double bonds; as a result, fats with cis double bonds more readily exit the solid phase and enter the liquid phase. Longer chains of fatty acids will have high melting point because compared to shorter chains, there are more bonds to break.  The more bonds present, the higher the melting point.

== Other Experiments ==

When the fluid mosaic model was being developed, the idea that proteins could exhibit lateral movement in a membrane was a relatively new one. One of the earliest experiments to test this was performed by L. Frye and M. Edidin. Human cells and mouse cells were fused together and fluorescent labeled antibodies were used to visualize whether integral membrane proteins of each type could move among the membranes of both types in the fused cell. Rhodamine, a red fluorescent marker was used to label the antibodies specific for human proteins and the green marker fluorescin was used to label antibodies specific for mouse cell proteins. The newly fused mouse/human cells were exposed to both antibodies, and the resulting binding pattern revealed that the fused cells were not split into half red sides and half green sides, but had a intermixed content of green and red labeled proteins/antibodies. This showed that in a short amount of time, the integral proteins in fused cells were dispersed and therefore that membrane proteins have rapid lateral mobility.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Cases where sequence alignments result in less than 25% of identical amino acids usually rule out homology.  However, even if the sequences do not demonstrate homology, comparisons of their structures may.  A protein’s '''three-dimensional structure''' is more related to its function than is its primary sequence.  As a result, the tertiary structure is generally more conserved than the sequence.  Though proteins in a family group may differ in amino acid sequence, they are characterized by similar structure.  An example of this can be seen in the proteins hemoglobin and myoglobin.  Though the two proteins differ in sequence, there are both characterized by a similar heme group that allows for the binding and transport of oxygen.

== Paralogs ==

It may also be the case that proteins have structural similarities, but play different biochemical roles and have different amino acid sequences.  This is indicative of a '''common ancestor''' that evolved into different pathways through what is termed '''divergent evolution'''.  The proteins are then considered '''paralogs''', which often have different functions within one species.  An example of this can be seen in actin and Hsp-70.  Though both resemble each other in structure, actin plays a role in muscle contraction and cell motility while Hsp-70 plays a role in preventing stress and heat shock. Another easier example is  between our hands and the legs of frogs. Same ancestor and same origin, but came to divert and have different function.
[[Image:Humanevolutionchart.jpg|thumb|Humans diverged from common ancestor|300px]]

== Evaluating Sequence Alignments ==

The method of sequence alignment can be used to detect the similarity of homology. Two sequences of proteins can be compared by sliding one sequence past the other and record the number of matched residues. 

Upon analysis of similar structures, the sequence alignments can be re-evaluated for a better fit.  '''Gaps''' can be inserted to compensate for amino acids that have been inserted or deleted through evolution in order to obtain a better sequence alignment score between structurally similar proteins.  Despite overall sequence differences that can be observed between proteins, those in the same family generally contain regions that play crucial roles in function and are therefore more strongly conserved.  From this, a '''sequence template''' can be created which maps out the conserved amino acid residues that are critical to structure and function.The method of scoring include penalties for gaps to prevent the insertion of an unreasonable number of gaps. 

By using substitution matrices, we can detect distant evolutionary relationships. Some substitutions are structurally conservative substitutions. They have similar size and chemical properties. They do not have major effects on protein structure. Other substitutions are amino acids that are not similar to each other. In the substitution matrices, &quot;a large positive score corresponds to a substitution that occurs relatively frequently, whereas a large negative score corresponds to a substitution that occurs only rarely&quot; (Berg 169).

Also, we can use database to identify evolutionary relationships. For example, the National Center of Biotechnology Information (www. ncbi.nih.gov)

== Detecting Repeats ==

In some cases a gene may be duplicated and developed into a new gene after mutations are accumulated.  However, because the new gene originated from the original gene, it still retains similar domains.  Similar domains can be detected by sequence and structural alignments of the repeats by aligning a protein with itself.

== Convergent Evolution ==

[[Image:Convergent evolution 12.JPG|thumb|Hummingbirds that converged during evolution|200px]]

Some proteins may contain similar structures but originate from different ancestors. This is known as '''convergent evolution''', where separate proteins evolve through separate pathways and converge on a similar structure and function. In this case, proteins may share similar structures/sequences in regions that prove significant to their function. These proteins often have similar binding sites/active sites. Homology is ruled out due to differences in the overall structures. An example of convergent evolution between our eyes and the eyes of flies. The eyes of flies are from a totally different origin, but has the same function as our eyes.

== RNA Sequences ==

Structural alignments of homologous RNA sequences can dictate its structure. The comparison of RNA can be a source of studying evolutionary relationships.  Though two RNA strands may differ in its base sequences, a similar structure may be obtained through the '''conservation of base pairing'''.  Though different bases may be involved, base pairing still occurs in the same general locations allowing for similar secondary structures.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Welcome ===

If you are new to computers, what you will learn in this manual will be a heavenly &quot;dream come true&quot; introduction to cutting edge computing technology.

If your school teachers told you &quot;Using computers involves cleaning up viruses all the time &quot;, or if you heard from your friends that &quot;Computers would crash every now and then and are so difficult to maintain.&quot;, just take it with a bucket full of mud.
All the problems mentioned above don't apply with what you will learn in this manual.

Ubuntu is a GNU/Linux based operating system and is also a derivative of the Debian GNU/Linux operating system. Essentially what this means is:
*Ubuntu will be constantly developed by thousands of voluntary contributors as well as paid developers
*Ubuntu will always be free (unless Canonical, the makers, do not receive sufficient funding)
*Ubuntu will receive numerous updates on a daily basis
*The Ubuntu community will always offer free support
*You are welcome to contribute to Ubuntu in any way you feel you can help

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Publishing SCORM exams to Ecampus or WebCT==

Learning Management Systems (LMS) allow authenticated student access to exam and other materials under a variety of protocols.  This section describes release of published Question Writer SCORM exams under Blackboard learning Systems Ecampus, one of a number of current LMS systems in use in academia.  

===Setting up QW SCORM exams in Ecampus===
SCORM modules may be published and released under Ecampus.  This requires four main steps

====1. Upload the Question Writer SCORM export to Ecampus====

You do this by using the Ecampus '''File Manager''' package to upload the Question Writer files from the local computer to your Ecampus storage area for the specific class in question.  You can keep the original filename of the SCORM module created by Question Writer, or you can rename it at this stage.

====2. Create a SCORM====

You do this in the Ecampus '''SCORM''' package, by hitting the &quot;Create SCORM module&quot; radio button and giving the module a title (i.e. &quot;Exam #1&quot;, etc), specifying the file location of the uploaded Question Writer SCORM, and setting navigation control/table of contents options. This is the SCORM that is linked to from the Course Content area, and is the Question Writer SCORM with a wrapper.

====3. Link to the SCORM from the Course Content area====

Navigate to the '''Course Content''' area, and specifically to the folder where the exam will be placed.  Then &quot;Add Content Link...SCORM Module&quot; allows browsing of the SCORM created in step (2).

====4. Selective release of the SCORM link====

The SCORM created in (3) can, by default, be executed by any class member (including students) if no selective release criteria are specified, as may be done in the '''Selective Release''' package.  Here, editing the selective release criteria may be done by Ecampus member (individual), group (a number of members), or by date/time interval.  If no criteria are added, then Ecampus will release unconditionally.  

In addition to selective release, the folders in the course area as well as the links themselves may all be individually &quot;HIDDEN&quot; or &quot;SHOWN&quot;.  This is also controlled in the selective release area.  

This means that if an exam link named &quot;bar&quot; lies within a folder named &quot;foo&quot;, then one can HIDE foo and, even if bar has no selective release criteria set, no student will be able to see the link or execute the exam.  HIDE is not member or group specific and is in effect a quick way to make the folder inaccessible to all (even the course designer).

Limitations of selective release: as of this writing (11/2008), there is no selective release of SCORMs by IP address.  This is in contrast to the selective release allowed for Ecampus's own assessment modules.  If you want to have selective release by IP address (i.e., to accommodate exam administration only in a proctored lab), then the instructor must create a &quot;check in&quot; group and release the exam to students by adding their names to this group after they have admitted the students to the lab.  This is a serious drawback of using SCORM modules within Ecampus for this type of exam administration, and hopefully will be amenmded in future versions of the LMS.

===Nature of Question Writer exam execution in Ecampus===
Question Writer SCORM exams will run very similarly to how they do as an html.  They run in their own applet window, which is initially minimized by default and must be maximized manually by the student if a full-sized window is desired.  But in all other ways, Question Writer exams will look and feel just as they did while being viewed in Question Writer itself.

===Reporting of results===
Question Writer transfers exam results as a final average (expressed as a percent of 100%, only) truncated at the integer percent below the grade.  Thus, 78.9% will report as &quot;78&quot;.  It will report to the SCORM gradebook, using the Title of the Question Writer exam entered under &quot;Quiz Details&quot; in Question Writer, e.g. &quot;Exam 2&quot;, etc.  If the same exam is run multiple times, only the most recent grade is retained.  If a 2nd SCORM exam is uploaded with the same Title, then the grade listing is saved as a new field in the SCORM gradebook, such as &quot;Exam 2(1)&quot;.  

Somewhat frustratingly, SCORM gradebook fields may only be added by a SCORM module being run, and once created may not be edited or deleted by the Instructor.  They may, however, be used to calculate user-created fields in the regular gradebook (non-SCORM) for the course.

Of course, grades may be submitted externally to a results server outside Ecampus, as for other environments.  This may require that a current version of Java is installed on the exam computers and that no firewall or local network restrictions are applied to prevent this.  

===Summary===
SCORM module execution of Question Writer exams under Ecampus is reasonably robust and produces exams that are very close facsimiles of what one sees in Question Writer itself.  Execution in a LAN environment of suitable speed is clean, fast, and robust.  Potential drawbacks do (as of 11/2008) exist:

a) SCORM results are limited in quantity in Ecampus; external results service is virtually required

b) no IP address filtering may be performed to allow secure lab exam administration

c) exams terminated prematurely/unintentionally may not be restarted with retention of completed questions

d) exams &lt;may&gt; be restarted without retention of earlier questions, and may be done so multiple times (Ecampus does not limit re-execution)

Item (d) may be addressed by modifying the index.html within the /Publishing/SCORM folder of Question Writer.  A modified index.html may prevent re-taking of the exam or require password override to retake.

Despite the shortcomings, Question Writer exams are still generally higher in quality than those available in most LMS assessment packages, and all of the shortcomings above may be worked around.

Question Writer SCORM exams in Ecampus are a viable alternative to LMS-based testing.

      <comment>/* Using Option Types */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{prognav|F Sharp|Higher Order Functions|Tuples and Records}}

{{fsharpTitle|Option Types}}
An '''option type''' can hold two possible values: &lt;code&gt;Some(x)&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;None&lt;/code&gt;. Option types are frequently used to represent optional values in calculations, or to indicate whether a particular computation has succeeded or failed.

== Using Option Types ==
Let's say we have a function that divides two integers. Normally, we'd write the function as follows:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;let div x y = x / y&lt;/source&gt;
This function works just fine, but it's not safe: it's possible to pass an invalid value into this function which results in a runtime error. Here is a demonstration in fsi:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; let div x y = x / y;;

val div : int -&gt; int -&gt; int

&gt; div 10 5;;
val it : int = 2

&gt; div 10 0;;
System.DivideByZeroException: Attempted to divide by zero.
   at &lt;StartupCode$FSI_0035&gt;.$FSI_0035._main()
stopped due to error&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;code&gt;div 10 5&lt;/code&gt; executes just fine, but &lt;code&gt;div 10 0&lt;/code&gt; throws a division by zero exception.

Using option types, we can return &lt;code&gt;Some(value)&lt;/code&gt; on a successful calculation, or &lt;code&gt;None&lt;/code&gt; if the calculation fails:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; let safediv x y =
    match y with
    | 0 -&gt; None
    | _ -&gt; Some(x/y);;

val safediv : int -&gt; int -&gt; int option

&gt; safediv 10 5;;
val it : int option = Some 2

&gt; safediv 10 0;;
val it : int option = None&lt;/source&gt;

Notice an important difference between our &lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;safediv&lt;/code&gt; functions:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;val div : int -&gt; int -&gt; int
val safediv : int -&gt; int -&gt; int option&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt; returns an &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;, while &lt;code&gt;safediv&lt;/code&gt; returns an &lt;code&gt;int option&lt;/code&gt;. Since our &lt;code&gt;safediv&lt;/code&gt; function returns a different data type, it informs clients of our function that the application has entered an invalid state.

Option types are conceptually similar to nullable types in languages like C#, however F# option types do not use the CLR &lt;code&gt;System.Nullable&lt;T&gt;&lt;/code&gt; representation in IL due to differences in semantics.

== Pattern Matching Option Types ==
Pattern matching option types is as easy as creating them: the same syntax used to declare an option type is used to match option types:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; let isFortyTwo = function
    | Some(42) -&gt; true
    | Some(_) | None -&gt; false;;

val isFortyTwo : int option -&gt; bool

&gt; isFortyTwo (Some(43));;
val it : bool = false

&gt; isFortyTwo (Some(42));;
val it : bool = true

&gt; isFortyTwo None;;
val it : bool = false&lt;/source&gt;

== Other Functions in the &lt;code&gt;Option&lt;/code&gt; Module ==

'''&lt;code&gt;val get : 'a option -&gt; 'a&lt;/code&gt;'''
: Returns the value of a &lt;code&gt;Some&lt;/code&gt; option.
'''&lt;code&gt;val isNone : 'a option -&gt; bool&lt;/code&gt;'''
: Returns &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; for a &lt;code&gt;None&lt;/code&gt; option, &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; otherwise.
'''&lt;code&gt;val isSome : 'a option -&gt; bool&lt;/code&gt;'''
: Returns &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; for a &lt;code&gt;Some&lt;/code&gt; option, &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; otherwise.
'''&lt;code&gt;val map : ('a -&gt; 'b) -&gt; 'a option -&gt; 'b option&lt;/code&gt;'''
: Given &lt;code&gt;None&lt;/code&gt;, returns &lt;code&gt;None&lt;/code&gt;. Given &lt;code&gt;Some(x)&lt;/code&gt;, returns &lt;code&gt;Some(f x)&lt;/code&gt;, where &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; is the given mapping function.
'''&lt;code&gt;val iter : ('a -&gt; unit) -&gt; 'a option -&gt; unit&lt;/code&gt;'''
: Applies the given function to the value of a &lt;code&gt;Some&lt;/code&gt; option, does nothing otherwise.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The genomes of various organisms from bacteria to multi-cellular eukaryotes and even the human genome have already been completely sequenced due to the development of DNA sequencing techniques such as fluorescent dideoxynucleotide chain terminators, high-volume, rapid DNA sequencing.  In the shotgun approach in sequencing, the genomic DNA was sheared into random fragments that were then completely sequenced by computers that matched overlapping regions between the fragments.  The top-down method requires detailed initial physical map of thousands of clones.  The first eukaryotic genome that was sequenced completely was baker's yeast.

The human genome progressed from a draft sequence from 2001 to a finished sequence in 2004.  The human genome has over three billion base pairs of DNA distributed among 24 chromosomes.  The human genome contains approximately 25,000 genes and 10,000 pseudogenes which are DNA encoding mutated genes that are no longer functional.  Many genes encode more than one protein due to alternative splicing of mRNA and modifications to proteins after translation occurs.  There are also millions of non-coding regions due to mobile genetic elements such as SINES (short interspersed elements) and LINES (long interspersed elements)

Sequencing projects require both rapid sequencing techniques and efficient methods for assembling many short stretches of 300 to 500 base pairs into a complete sequence. 

== '''The Sanger Dideoxy Method''' ==

Frederick Sanger and his coworkers developed a method in which fragments of DNA are isolated by controlled termination of replication. This technique was preferred over all other methods because of its sheer simplicity. There are four mixtures which each consist of the template strand, DNA primers, DNA polymerase, 4 types of nucleotides, and then each reaction mixture contains a small amount of the 2',3'-dideoxy analog of one of the nucleotides, a different analog for each mixture. The 2',3'-dideoxy analog lacks a 3'-hydroxyl group which is needed in order for DNA polymerase to form a phosphodiester bond; because the concentrations of each of the dideoxy analogs is low, the chain termination only occasionally occurs. In other words, most of the time DNA polymerase creates the phosphodiester bond which elongates the replicated strand, but only sometimes does it stop it. At some point, all DNA fragments are stopped due to the dideoxy analogs, however they are all various lengths. There are for sets of these chain-terminated fragments, so they can each undergo electrophoresis and the base sequence of the DNA can be read.  Because each type of dideoxy analog can be labeled with a fluorescent marker, this makes it easy for to produce a chromatographic trace at four different wavelengths. Fluorescence detection is the preferred method because it eliminates the use of radioactive reagents and can be automated. This method can sequence up to one million bases per day.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Zone 1 Food Garden =
Principle that Guides this Process: Bring food production back to the cities.

= The Design Process =
* What are your needs? ~ base what you grow on what you like to eat and what can be grown in the area.
* What other needs do you have of this area? ~ some elements to consider are, recreation/play, outdoor cooking, pond, worm farm, sitting/contemplative area, glasshouse, propagation/potting shed/area.
* How will it relate to other zones e.g. 0 (house) &amp; 2 (Fruit Forest)? Think about the needs &amp; yields of all 3 zones
* Think about what materials you will need. This often comes when the design is done but if you look at what is available either on your land or close by you may be inspired by the resources you have &amp; come up with some ingenuous ideas.
* You may actually decide to limit what you do to what you can glean/recycle/gather rather than what you can buy. This can lead to becoming quite skilled at finding what you need &amp; seeing resources everywhere!

= Characteristics of Zone 1 =

* It is good to place zone 1 as close as possible to your dwelling &amp; especially the kitchen. It is also good to place it on a well-traveled route so that you are in touch with it i.e. seeing that something needs harvesting or care.
* Although annuals are planted in this zone many perennials are also ~ asparagus, artichoke, chives, NZ spinach, rhubarb, scarlet runner beans &amp; various herbs as companion plants &amp; pest predator attracters. Let some plants self seed. 
* Zone 1 is sheet mulched traditionally using Lucerne or pea straw. However a mix of grass clippings, well-rotted manure, non-invasive weeds without seeds seaweed &amp; leaves can all be used instead. After laying the newspaper/cardboard out put the manure on followed by a mix of equal parts of the other materials. This is best done in early autumn &amp; left to breakdown over winter. When you go to plant make a depression about the size of half a soccer ball in the mulch &amp; fill with good compost &amp; plant!
* Zone 1 is intensively cultivated which basically means it has a lot growing in it &amp; needs lots of attention! No- dig gardens can be planted much more intensively as the nutrient sources are high.
* Curved paths ~ to create more edge &amp; made small to allow more space for growing
* Uses renewable &amp; completely biodegradable materials
* Conserves water
* The plantings are very diverse. Diversity is a high priority when you practice Permaculture. Herbs, flowers, fruits &amp; vegetables all grow together in carefully designed relationships. You also aim for a diversity of microclimates which enables the growing of a diversity of plants! 

= Methods Used =

* Vertical Space ~ go up rather than out make use of fences, trellis’, walls &amp; even roofs. There are many productive roof gardens in cities all over the world. Fruit trees can be espaliered or cordoned. A pumpkin can be planted next to a wall &amp; trained to grow over a low roof of a shed for example. The less space we take up for the growing of our food the more space we have to return to indigenous species.
* Stacking ~ this echoes the way a forest grows. In a vege garden we can have ground covers such as thyme, followed by lower growing plants such as lettuce &amp; the “trees” could be broccoli or brussel sprouts. 
* Guilds ~ this is a planting where each plant benefits the others. A useful guild for this climate would be peas interplanted with lettuce, carrots &amp; radish. Peas supply nitrogen for the lettuce &amp; shade, the radish aids the carrots as they grow fast &amp; open up the soil &amp; the carrots send roots to aerate the deeper soil. The lettuce also makes radish tender. Planting in guilds also means that you get a diversity of food at the same time rather than a glut of one or two varieties.
* There are certain planting patterns which make care &amp; harvesting easier. 
:*Clipping plants ~ leaf by leaf or cut &amp; come again are planted by the path within easy reach.
:*Raised narrow beds ~ for carrots, parsnips, peas &amp; beans
:*Broad beds ~ for long-term crops such as potatoes, cabbage, cauliflower.
:*If keyhole beds are used, long-term crops are planted in the middle of the beds.

* Small animals can play a part in the maintenance of a Zone 1 garden. Guinea pigs in hutches can be moved about a grassy area &amp; will keep it mowed &amp; give manure for the compost, hens can be let in when crops are at an end to clean up, fertilise &amp; cultivate or use the chook dome method &amp; get them to do all the work! Ducks can clean slugs up before you put in the beds &amp; then let in occasionally for follow-ups once the plants are large enough to not be walked on! 
* Zone 1 needs a diversity of micro climates as previously mentioned &amp; so contain suntraps which create warm sheltered areas &amp; paths made of brick, stone or gravel all act as thermal mass giving out the heat they collect during the day. Even small ponds will create humidity, soil moisture &amp; warmth around them.

So a pond will create a warmer area for frost sensitive crops


= Some other Structures Found in Zone 1 =

* Herb spirals are best placed as close as possible to the house. They provide various growing conditions &amp; thermal mass if made with rocks or bricks. They also make good use of vertical space.
* Worm farms can be incorporated into your zone 1 design providing vermicast &amp; liquid fertiliser for both garden &amp; glasshouse.
* Cold frames for raising seedlings can be placed in Zone 1 close to the area where propagation mix ingredients are &amp; for easy transplanting &amp; fertilising with the worm juice.
* Compost areas. These can provide various microclimates too &amp; extra nutrients &amp; moisture leach into the soil around them.
* Glasshouse. Extends your growing season &amp; creates a micro climate around it 

Deciding on what you want at the start is essential to being able to design a system which has many supportive relationships.

Remember that Zone 1 can be not only a productive area but a beautiful one too!

Originally from: http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/User:Splarka/randbook.js
Based roughly on http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=MediaWiki:RandomBook.js&amp;oldid=1209572 by Darklama.

Grabs 10 random pages from the API, checks if any are books. Repeats until it finds a book.

Notes:
* Don't grab more than 10 random pages. Logged in users can get more, but anon users cannot. 
** Since this uses callback, all users are limited to 10 anyway.
* Automatically re-queries until it finds a page in one of the 38 Category:Alphabetical\ categories.
** As 10.5% of pages are in this category, most queries should take only 1 or 2 iterations.
* Setting window.location.href eats history in some browsers.
** To show a link instead use: var randBookAsLink = true; (users can set this in their monobook individually too);
* Uses curid links, I usually trust these more than trying to generate /wiki links.

A user asked whether this page was created by accident and recommended it for speedy deletion. This is a legitimate page and I've been assembling content for it throughout the day, so it definitely should not be deleted.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is a good start - thanks Andrew. :-) I think the first thing I'd like to clear up is the broad scope of the book - without needing to specify a title, what is the book about? An overview of/introduction to the Open Educational Resources movement? Open Education: past, present, and future? I'm presuming we're making links between theory and practice - and not simply describing what's out there? The second thing I'd like to discuss is my feeling that we should be critical of the OER world/movement, as well as singing its praises. For example, there are many tensions in making content available to the world - do people have some sort of 'ownership' over materials they have created? What are the conflicting implications of making content openly editable? By encouraging students to participate to OER sites, are we expecting them to say in public what they would prefer to keep within a closed or smaller group? These are all issues I would like to see addressed in such a book - and I feel that &quot;challenges and opportunities&quot; should be a running theme within the book. Or would there be a benefit to having a chapter devoted to challenges? (Would that absolve other chapters from discussing challenges, or create redundancy?) Thoughts? [[User:Cormaggio|Cormaggio]] ([[User talk:Cormaggio|talk]]) 09:43, 13 November 2008 (UTC)


Excellent points, I think, Cormaggio!  I feel that we are onto something really powerful with some serious practical and theoretical implications for all sorts of educators.  As you mention, the notion of challenges and opportunities is a very important central theme.  Rather than including these in one chapter, I would make this a standard section within each chapter.  

As for the focus of the book, I know that (given sufficient research) my colleagues and I could survey the landscape and describe the past and present.  The future, though, is something of which I would imagine Wikibooks admins like you and Andrew have special knowledge.  It would be nice to capitalize on this special knowledge in a meaningful way--to prepare educators for &quot;the next big thing(s)&quot;.

==Bad science...== 
===What is bad science?===

This book is based on articles from the Bad Science column written by Dr. Ben Goldacre. A British doctor and journalist, author of the [http://www.guardian.co.uk/life/badscience/ &quot;Bad Science&quot; column] in the Guardian Saturdays newspaper. Most of his writing is focused in telling just how the media sometimes gets it wrong reporting on &quot;pseudoscience&quot; (false science) as true science, this subject is also covered on his website/blog, [http://www.badscience.net www.badscience.net].

{{SAMPLE|sampletext=
&quot;Science is all about taking someone's idea, their hypothesis, and then looking at the experimental evidence for that. For example, the genius of Aqua Detox is, they claim the toxins come out of your feet, and the water goes brown: but we can test why the water goes brown for ourselves, with our own experiment. And I reckon your own home-made &quot;detox&quot; equipment will be an awful lot cheaper than their £1000 machine...&quot;|caption=—[[w:Ben Goldacre|Ben Goldacre]]}}

&quot;Bad Science&quot; for the classroom, created by Planet Science and Dr. Goldacre with the help of teachers:  brings fun activities to do with students as a way to demonstrate that not everything you read as science is in reality &quot;proper&quot; science. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

===Activities===
The following activities are available, but if you have ideas for other Bad Science activities, feel free to add them.

*Scientific Claims in Advertising:[[/Detox|Let’s Get Detoxed!]]
*Do you believe your teacher?  [[/Placebo|The Placebo Effect!]]
*Scary Medical Statistics: [[/Intepretation|Lost in interpretation!]]
*[[/Bug|Got the Bad Science bug?]]

Share Your Own Discoveries &amp; Find Out More

These activities are aimed at 14-16 year olds, but there’s nothing to say you can’t try these with any age group… it’s all in the name of scientific literacy… let’s not all get hypnotised by pseudoscience!

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Cleanup ==

I feel that the page is more relevant for Wikipedia than Wikibooks. Well, it appears more like a advocacy of something and one-sided. It needs cleanup for sure.-&lt;font color=&quot;maroon&quot; size=&quot;4&quot; face=&quot;Monotype Corsiva&quot;&gt;[[User:Ravichandar84|Ravichandar]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;aqua&quot; face=&quot;Monotype Corsiva&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Ravichandar84|My coffee shop]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; 11:47, 13 November 2008 (UTC)

:Wikipedia is not an option, nor should it be. This is a book about examples of mis-reporting and mis-selling based on scientific, or apparently scientific, principles. It is written for teachers to use with their students to raise issues, explore the evidence and reach their own conclusions. If it's one-sided it's on the side of facts which can be, or have been, established; it's against people who deliberately, or through ignorance, mis-use science to write sensational stories, sell their product, etc.

:What 'clean-up' do you think is necessary?

:: The newspaper item reproduced and the views expressed gave the impression that it was an [[WB:SOAP|advocacy]] of some kind.

::I share the feeling that the current format seems to be [[WB:SOAP]] even if the argumentation is valid a rewrite to exclude (validate by references) personal affirmations or interpretations should be done, titles of sources if not validated in someway are meaningless in the Wiki context. There is a need to cover [[WB:NPOV]] problems. I was inclined to start a [[WB:VFD]] on the work not because of the content itself but because of the format it has.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 00:05, 14 November 2008 (UTC)

:::The 'personal affirmations' are all validated by references and/or logical argument, I feel. What examples do you think are problematic?

:::I'm not sure what you mean about 'titles of sources if not validated'? For example?

:::What's the problem with the format?

:::[[User:Ewen|Ewen]] ([[User talk:Ewen|talk]]) 06:29, 14 November 2008 (UTC)

::::I have rewritten the main page so to reduce some of the SOAP feeling. It should also contain some information explaining why media get it wrong (lack of credible participants, commentators; time constrains; target consumer lacking the basis to understand complex issues; false advertising; need for impact; etc...).
::::Try to invert the structure, center it on the real content and then relate it to the articles in place of starting on the articles (that most people don't know, may not be interested in), the articles shouldn't have such relevancy if the book is to be of any use, since they can't be included and there is no guarantee they will be available for reading in the long run.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 18:43, 14 November 2008 (UTC)
::::Is &quot;Bad Science&quot; for the classroom this book project (you can request a rename) or is the book mimicking some already existing project?
::::If it is this project then mentioning the contributors as it is will quickly become futile as contributions on Wikibooks can't be restricted to a group. I'm referring to &quot;created by Planet Science and Dr. Goldacre with the help of teachers&quot; if the idea is to evolve it here, and gather community participation, this should be reworded from created to initiated and a mention to it being a Wikibook project would look nice.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 21:49, 14 November 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Bad science... let's get detoxed!==
===Scientific claims in advertising===
In this day and age, everyone's after a quick fix to make them feel good.

Forget diets, sweaty gym shorts, or a milkshake for breakfast, lunch and dinner…let's start detoxing ourselves.

OK, so here’s the deal: Let's stick our feet in some water, stick an electric current through it, and no, we don't get fried, instead we’ll find we've removed toxins from the trillions of pores in our feet. All this icky brown stuff spews out. And we’re shiny clean on the inside? Good Science? Nah…Bad Science!

Aqua Detox claims to be an amazing treatment that removes toxins from the pores in your feet. Dialysis for the feet? Surely this is a major breakthrough then? Hmm….we need a course of five to ten sessions, at 30 minutes a session, and how much hard-earned cash should we part with, exactly?


===What the students had to say about this activity:===

* &quot;I liked working on real-life examples.&quot;
* &quot;I enjoyed testing the advertising claims.&quot;
* &quot;I liked the real examples rather than things which seem to come from nowhere.&quot;
* &quot;When we put the nails in the salty water and it started to bubble and go brown. But when we didn’t put any salt in nothing happened so it’s just the salt.&quot;
* &quot;The aqua detox thing is a con and they are trying to grab your money.&quot;

How about a hair shampoo advert claiming to make hair 10% stronger! See UPD8 resources on [http://www.upd8.org.uk/activity.php?actid=137 Interpreting and Evaluating Evidence].

What does the [http://www.asa.org.uk/ Advertising Standards Authority] do? Do they keep an eye on whether science is misrepresented in the media? There are rules concerning the promotion of many health-related products in the media. For instance a claim that a brand of toothpaste helps reduce decay must be backed up by clinical evidence if it is to be used in an advertisement.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Scientific Claims in Advertising: Let’s Get Detoxed!==
===Teacher's Notes===
Since we can’t get students to put their feet into an electric current, try using a doll
as the subject (Barbie perhaps?), with the punch line that “even a doll can be
successfully detoxed!” Actually, even without anyone’s feet being in the bowl,
something’s getting detoxed…or is it?

====Aim:====
To show that not everything that appears to use science is trustworthy and that it’s
important to look at scientific claims carefully.

====Learning objectives and outcomes:====
* To critically read a piece of literature and analyse the use of science and
scientific evidence.
* To recognise the process of electrolysis.
* To motivate students to apply the scientific literacy gained in the classroom
into their lives.

====Resources required:====
Two iron electrodes, two electrical leads, crocodile clips and a battery, large bowl,
sodium chloride (salt) solution, plastic doll.

====Safety:====

DO NOT put hands in the bowl while the battery is connected. There is the risk of an
electric shock.

====Starter activities:====
A quick pre-starter activity is to get the students to write down what they
understand by the word “detox”. Discussion of their responses leads to the starter
activity.

Start with a body outline and get students to place and identify the organs which are
involved in removing unwanted substances from the body. This can be done using
whatever resources are available: interactive whiteboard drag and drop, stick on a
flipchart, or use a student as the body outline and ask others to point out or stick on
the relevant organs.

Tell the students about the product and about the advertised “explanation” for what
happens – without giving the game away up front. Read the claims from one of the
Aqua Detox websites. Identify any scientific claims or use of scientific words. Also
look at the list of celebrity endorsements (10 minutes).

====Core level main activity:====

1. Ask students to discuss whether they would use and trust Aqua Detox and if
yes, for what conditions. Ask students to identify which points on the website
gave them confidence. Is a very professional, eye-catching website enough of
a reason for believing an advertising claim? (5 minutes)

2. The teacher should then make the claim that they could conduct Aqua Detox
on the doll. Does the class believe you? Find out. They should give reasons
for their answers (3 minutes).

3. Demonstrate the Aqua Detox process using salt water, two iron electrodes,
two electrical leads, crocodile clips and a battery (simple electrolysis circuit).
Place the doll (the doll’s feet, that is) in the bowl. Turn on and wait for a few
minutes. While waiting discuss the article written by Ben Goldacre.

4. View the mucky brown water. Could this really have been inside a doll? What
other suggestions could there be? What else could cause the brown solid?

5. Students are now asked if they believe the website? Go back to the article
and highlight the use of scientific terms. Are they telling lies or bending the
truth? What clues are there to the reader? Why are the case studies so
enthusiastic?

6. Students should discuss in small groups the impact of treatments like this.
Are the companies causing harm or should they be allowed to get away with
this, especially if people are silly enough to part with their money? What, if
anything, should be done?

7. Students could create their own pseudoscience product, with pseudo
evidence.

====Plenary:====
Discuss what the students should do as consumers to avoid hoaxers and how some
advertisers just lie, and talk about the need for general scientific literacy.

====Extension:====

Carry out further experiments e.g. using different metals for the electrodes. Write a
letter to Aqua Detox suggesting an experiment they could carry out to try to
convince people their equipment really does what it says it does (it’s up to you if you
actually want to send it!)

====Adaptations and Other ideas:====
* Could get students to role play being the Trading Standards
Officer/Advertising Standards Authority Watchdog and the dodgy advertiser.
* If you can’t get hold of the advert, or you want to do this differently, you
could pretend this is a brand new invention.
* Give the students information about Trading Standards and the Advertising
Standards Authority.
* Could team up with English or Media Studies department to write adverts etc.

====ICT:====
Looking at websites where there has been a misrepresentation of science in
advertising.

====Keywords:====

Detox, electrolysis, electrodes, iron, sodium chloride.

====Citizenship:====
Significance of the media in society.

====Assessment opportunities:====

Scientific literacy skills, recording observations, finding evidence to support claims.

====Curriculum links:====
This activity could be incorporated into lessons where you may be looking into the
importance of testing explanations, the need for scientific literacy, answering
scientific questions of different kinds, and considering the strength of the
evidence/quality of the product. This activity can serve as an introduction to the
topics of physiology and excretion.

====Homework task:====
What other advertising claims have lead to society getting the wrong idea about
science? Did any of your friends or relatives believe the claims? Write a letter to BBC
Watchdog raising your concerns about a misleading advert. (Once again, it’s totally
up to you as to whether you post it or not!)

====The Aqua Detox Investigation:====

Feedback from teachers who trialled and designed the experiments

Teacher 1:

This was really simple and really effective. I introduced the topic of Aqua Detox, and
we looked through the website. We then discussed whether they would go for it or
not. The students were convinced by the company blurb and we analysed the
company claims looking for scientific words. The students were particularly convinced
by the celebrity clientele and the pictures of the water turning from colourless to
brown. I then asked them for scientific reasons why the brown colour appeared and
the students duly repeated the blurb from the website. I then claimed that I could
detox Barbie. We all then gathered around one orange bowl and explained the
analogies from the site and particularly focussed on Ben’s article, which I copied out.
I asked if students believed that Barbie could be Aqua Detox-ed, still the reception
was mixed. Barbie was detoxified in ten minutes. The product was impressively
disgusting and the students were horrified, “How can people lie like that?” they said.
“Why would people part with that much cash?”

We then went back and looked at the company claims and identified the
pseudoscience claims. It was very useful to do this after the placebo experiment as
they could then use this knowledge to explain why people might feel better after a
fake procedure.

We even have a nail bar next to the school offering Aqua Detox, so it was all very
relevant. The activities were well received by the students and impacted how they
saw the use of science in society.

Teacher 2:

I tried a practical activity based on Aqua Detox and supported it with the Aqua Detox
website and Ben’s article projected on the whiteboard. The practical showed it was
blindingly obvious where the brown stuff in the water was coming from.
The practical work was trialled with a group of lower ability Year 10 students. It was
clear that the concentration of sodium chloride was not important – the students
poured fairly random quantities of salt into their beakers. Every beaker produced a
dirty brown sludge. We used iron nails as electrodes, and ran the lab power packs at
6V.

The activity could be used to support thinking skills based lessons as well as science
objectives. I think in the longer term this kind of work could be very useful for case
study type coursework exercises in the new GCSEs

===Student Worksheet===
Write down what you think DETOX means:

What is happening in the Aqua Detox process? Would you have it done?

Pour some distilled water into a beaker/bowl. Put the doll’s feet into this newly
created footspa, and place the electrodes in. Connect the electrodes and switch on
the power supply. Wait for a few minutes. What happens?

Now pour some salt into the water, stir to dissolve and repeat the experiment.
What happens now?

From the results of your experiment, decide what you think is going on in the Aqua Detox
equipment. What is the most likely source of the colouration in the water? Does your
conclusion support Aqua Detox’s claims or Ben Goldacre’s article?

What further experiments would you carry out to confirm your conclusion?

What do you think about this treatment? What do you think about this kind of advertising?

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Scientific Claims in Advertising: Let's Get Detoxed!==
===Background Notes===
====What is real detox?====

Excretion is the process by which our bodies chemically separate waste products
and eliminate them!

Your body is naturally detoxing all the time.

Your excretory system is what removes harmful substances from
your body, allowing it to survive.

When harmful substances are converted into less harmful ones,
this process is called detoxification.

The main organs of excretion are the:
* Lungs

[[Image:Lungs_diagram_simple.svg|250px]]

* Kidneys
[[Image:Lammnieren.jpg|250px]]

[[Image:Gray1121.png|250px]]

* Skin

[[Image:Human_skin_structure.jpg|250px]]

* Intestine

[[Image:DigestiveSystemBlank.jpg|250px]]

====So what’s a “toxin”?====
“Toxin” really refers to the waste products of metabolism, and these shouldn’t build
up in our bodies. An example of a waste product is urea, which we get rid of in our
urine and sweat. Waste gases, such as carbon dioxide, are eliminated when we
breathe out.

====Natural Born Cleaners: Kidney Facts====

Kidneys (which look just like kidney beans, funnily enough) clean the blood. Blood is pumped from the heart through the renal artery to each kidney, and any waste matter and excess water is filtered off. This liquid waste is urine, which as we all know, leaves your body when you go to the toilet.

Filtered blood flows through the renal vein back to the heart. Severe kidney disease requires a treatment known as dialysis. The patient’s blood is pumped through a dialysis machine, which does the work of the kidneys: filters the waste from the blood, and returns the clean blood.

====Did you know?====

Your kidneys are the size of a clenched fist, yet they receive about 20% of the blood
pumped by the heart. Dialysis patients spend nearly 60 hours a week attached to a
dialysis machine. More than 300,000 people in the U.S. suffer from renal failure each
year and are waiting for a kidney transplant. Healthy people can survive perfectly
well with one kidney, and so can donate one to someone with kidney disease as long
as their tissues match.

But did you know, if you need a kidney transplant, your non-functional one would
not be swapped for the donor one, instead it’s added somewhere else in your
abdomen.

The earliest successful kidney transplant in a human was performed by RH Lawler
(USA) at Little Company of Mary Hospital, Chicago, Illinois USA on 17 June 1950.

A specialised excretory organ is your liver:


Its major excretory function is to break down old red blood cells
(ones that have reached their normal life span, a mere 100
days in humans. Parts of the haemoglobin molecule are
transformed by the liver to compounds known as bile
pigments. These are excreted in the bile (important in the
digestive process), discharged into the intestine and finally
out of the body with the faeces!

===Scary medical statistics===

Numbers are everywhere: lottery tickets, prices in the sales, channels on your telly….everywhere! But when numbers get muddled, we all get confused…especially when it happens in the media!

Fractions, percentages, ratios and a simple &quot;not knowing what to do with the data&quot; can lead to worrying conclusions, and the scariest of medical scares!

It’s easy to get scared if you don’t know the full story.

Being scientifically literate i.e. understanding the basic principles in science, allows you to judge whether the scientific data have been interpreted correctly and whether all you hear about in the media is true. What do you mean Brad and Jen aren’t together anymore?

      <text xml:space="preserve">Elasticity of Demand is the term used to describe the difference between the price of a product and the demand. Generally the higher the price of the product the more the demand will fall and vice versa, although there are exceptions to this where a high price is used to make a product appear more &quot;exclusive&quot;. Businesses use the elasticity of demand to determine what price to set in order to maximise profitability. Some businesses operate within markets where the products are considered inelastic. For example, petrol is generally considered to be inelastic as if the price rises the demand is not affected greatly. This is  because vehicle owners need petrol so the increase in sales would be greater than the loss in demand. Over the long term it is elastic as vehicle buyers will be encouraged to buy vehicles using alternative fuels, find different means of transport (e.g., train, bus) or better fuel consumption. Individual petrol stations are elastic as consumers will go where the prices are cheapest. Commodity products are also generally inelastic (e.g., bread). An example of elastic demand might be McDonalds in the fast food market. They are in a highly competitive market and raising their prices too high would lead to a loss in demand greater than the increase in sales. Businesses will raise prices as high as possible if it demand is inelastic until it is so high it becomes elastic, whereas elastic products should be lowered to gain better profits caused by increase in demand.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Entrepreneurship Is... ==
=== A mindset ===
You might have already heard about something called &quot;the entrepreneurial
mindset.&quot; You know it has something to do with entrepreneurs and 
starting your own business, but what is it, really? What does it mean to
be entrepreneurial? What are entrepreneurs like, and what do they do? 

The entrepreneurial mindset is marked by imagination, initiative, and a 
readiness to undertake new projects. It is perseverance and 
determination, risk-taking and daring, integrity and honesty. 
Entrepreneurs change the world in concrete ways through their 
inventions, their businesses, their social and economic impacts. The 
term &quot;entrepreneurial&quot; can apply to individuals, teams, or entire 
organizations.

=== What are entrepreneurs like? ===
While entrepreneurs have widely varying personalities and don't fall into a cookie-cutter mold, most successful entrepreneurs share a set of common characteristics. These include: 
 
* A participatory management style&amp;mdash;they're willing to share power 
* A high need for achievement 
* Supervisory and/or sales experience or skills 
* Persistence&amp;mdash;they're not easily discouraged 
* Willingness to live with uncertainty, particularly financial uncertainty 
* Open-minded&amp;mdash;willing to listen to constructive criticism 
* Flexibility&amp;mdash;they have the ability to change when data shows they're going down the wrong path  
     
Of course, another thing entrepreneurs have in common is the ability to bounce back from failure. Since it is entrepreneurs who are out there pushing the boundaries and changing the world, it's inevitable they will make mistakes. An important characteristic of entrepreneurs is that they are good at failure: the entrepreneur sees failure as a temporary setback, an investment in education, an opportunity to learn and to do better next time. Winston Churchill summed this up best when he said, &quot;Success is the ability to go from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm.&quot; 
           
=== What do they do? ===
Here's a standard definition of what entrepreneurs do:
{| WIDTH=&quot;75%&quot;| style=&quot;background-color: #f2fff2; border: solid 1px #bfffbf; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top|
|
&lt;blockquote&gt;Entrepreneurs habitually create and innovate to build something of recognized value around market opportunities.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
|}
There's a lot to those fourteen words; let's take apart the definition and investigate each term. 
     
* Habitually&amp;mdash; they cannot stop being entrepreneurial 
* Create&amp;mdash; they start from scratch and bring into being something that was not there before 
* Innovate&amp;mdash; they're able to overcome obstacles that would stop most people, turn problems and risks into opportunities, deliver, and see ideas through to final application 
* Build something&amp;mdash; the output of the innovation process 
* Of recognized value&amp;mdash; encompasses economic, commercial, social, or aesthetic value 
* Market opportunities&amp;mdash; to exploit a recognized market need

=== It's all about opportunity ===
Note the one word we keep harping on: opportunity. Entrepreneurs are opportunity-driven. Opportunity comes from changes in the environment, and one central characteristic of entrepreneurs is that they excel at seeing patterns of change. Also, entrepreneurs are not resource-driven; while the manager asks, &quot;Given the resources under my control, what can I achieve?&quot; the entrepreneur asks &quot;Given what I want to achieve, what resources do I need to acquire?&quot; 
 
It is the entrepreneur's drive to acquire resources in order to exploit opportunities that creates the high correlation between entrepreneurship and economic growth.

=== More than one kind of entrepreneur ===
Let's be honest: not everyone reading this book will go on to form their own company. Up to this point we've defined an entrepreneur in just that manner-as someone who starts his or her own business-but in today's rapidly changing world the concept of entrepreneurship has been broadened to include a very important, new kind of entrepreneur: the corporate entrepreneur. '''Corporate entrepreneurship''', also called intrapreneurship, is entrepreneurship practiced by people within established organizations. It is the process that goes on inside companies that leads to new business ventures; the development of new products, services or processes; and the renewal of strategies, leading to increased competitiveness. As such, it can be seen as the sum of a company's innovation, venturing and renewal efforts. 
 
Read this book with the understanding that you can think and act like an entrepreneur whether you start your own business or contribute your skills to an existing business. Being entrepreneurial is the centerpiece.

''The reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man.''

&amp;mdash;George Bernard Shaw

''Develop success from failures. Discouragement and failure are two of the surest stepping stones to success. No other element can do so much for a man if he is willing to study them and make capital out of them.''

&amp;mdash;Dale Carnegie

''As competition intensifies, the need for creative thinking increases. It is no longer enough to do the same thing better... no longer enough to be efficient and solve problems. Far more is needed.  Now business has to keep up with changes... And that requires creativity. That means creativity both at a strategic level and also on the front line, to accompany the shift that competitive business demands... from administration to true entrepreneurship.''

&amp;mdash;Edward de Bono

=== One corporate entrepreneur’s story ===
Chris Consorte had no intention of taking the job. But after launching his own marketing agency a year earlier, he met with a mortgage banking firm to get a foot in the door and, he hoped, to snag a new client. Then, as they say, they made him an offer he couldn’t refuse. “They were willing to pay me my asking price, [which was] more than I was making at my own company,” says Consorte.

But soon enough, the surprise job gave Consorte even more than he ever expected. The boss, “an intuitive guy,” saw that his new hire wanted more out of his job and work life than the average employee and started bouncing ideas off of him for new products and divisions. “Giving people opportunities was a big thing for him,” says Consorte. “They were embracing my salesmanship and entrepreneurial ways.” The best part? His boss made it clear that he wasn’t just giving Consorte the chance to learn a new thing or two (and take on hours and hours more work); he was going to share the wealth if all went well.

Eventually, among other responsibilities, Consorte was made head of the firm’s internal advertising agency, where he was free to take on outside clients so long as they weren’t competitors of the firm and it didn’t interfere with his full-time job. “I’m the type of person that if I have unlimited potential in front of me, I’m going to put in extra hours,” he says. “I’m all in—especially if I can see the results.”

=== Innovate or else ===
While corporate entrepreneurship can be good for the employee’s bottom line, it’s become a must-do for companies that don’t want to get left behind. “I don’t think there are any companies right now who can afford to rest on their laurels,” says Rita Gunther McGrath, associate professor at the Columbia Business School and author of The Entrepreneurial Mindset (Harvard Business School Press). “As the pace of competition gets faster and faster, yesterday’s winner can very easily become tomorrow’s roadkill.”

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Defining the Opportunity ==

=== Finding the intersection of technology and market ===
So where is the next million-dollar idea hiding, just waiting to be discovered? The answer: within you. Truly. In fact, you might believe you've got a million-dollar idea in your head already. But a great idea alone doesn't guarantee success: you also need to be able to recognize when a concept has the potential to become something tangible and hit it big. It all comes down to opportunity recognition (there's that word again). 

How do you recognize an opportunity? What exactly does one look like? It has to do with analyzing both the product and the market and seeing if they intersect. What you're looking for is a product that fulfills (or creates) a need at just the right time, in just the right place. Opportunities are built using a combination of your ideas and entrepreneurial creativity mixed with market need and good situational timing.  

Think about your idea as you read the rest of this chapter&amp;mdash;or, if you don't have an idea yet (which is perfectly fine), let it inform your idea generation process&amp;mdash;and ask yourself these questions:  
 
* Is my idea realistic? Is it technically and financially feasible? 
* Is there a strong need for my potential product?  
* Is this a need I passionately want to address? 
* Does pursuing this opportunity meet my goals as an entrepreneur? 
   
=== Where's the pain? ===
There's an old metaphor about meeting customer needs:.Come up with a product that scratches a customer's itch, and maybe they'll buy it. Come up with a product that relieves a customer's pain, and you've got a winner. &quot;Pain,&quot; of course, is a relative term and could describe just about anything-a toothache, a slow computer, a boring job-but the idea behind the metaphor is that it's the entrepreneur's responsibility to find out what the customer needs most, then fulfill that need. It goes without saying that if your product isn't grounded in reality and serves no need at all-doesn't even scratch an itch-it has no chance. No one buys useless products. 
   
=== On the cutting edge ===
Quite a few products and services out there simply fulfill a pre-existing need. Returning to the previous example, if you have a toothache, you go to the dentist and she fulfills your (painful, immediate) need. Simple. But when you're talking about high-tech products, things get a lot more complex. You may very well come up with an idea so new and innovative that it addresses a need that doesn't even exist yet. This is a difficult spot to be in as your product may have a hard time gaining traction. 

When you're on the cutting edge: 
 
* Get into your customers' heads as much as possible 
* Develop cheap, easy-to-test prototypes 
* Put the prototypes into people's hands and listen to what they say 
* Be open to your product perhaps being useful in a market you never originally imagined 
   
The last point is particularly instructive. When 3-M chemist Spence Silver invented a new adhesive that would not dry or permanently bond to things, he had no idea what to do with it. When another 3-M chemist, Arthur Fry, needed a bookmark for his choir book the idea for applying the glue to small pieces of paper emerged, and Post-It Notes were born. 
   
=== What you know ===
Understandably, the majority of entrepreneurs found businesses based on ideas gathered from jobs and activities and lifestyles they're familiar with. For one thing, the entrepreneur understands what target customers want because she's part of the group. Two, because the entrepreneur is familiar with the products currently on the market, she can usually introduce a product that trumps the competition. And finally, when selling the product to customers, the entrepreneur appears not as a salesperson, but rather as &quot;one of us.&quot; It's a powerful situation that doesn't guarantee success, but definitely gives you a good chance. 
   
=== Levels of need ===
But now let's reverse the situation and talk about what you don't know, what you aren't familiar with. It can be a very good thing to actually go beyond what you know-to keep an open mind about opportunity and think broadly about the needs of the world beyond your comfort zone. Undoubtedly a new mp3 player or a new snowboard boot addresses the needs of a certain population and has a chance at success. But UV water purification systems for villages in the developing world address the needs of an entirely different population, and have just as good a chance at success, whether measured in terms of profits or lives saved, or both.  What we're talking about are levels of need. If you haven't already, what you need to do is figure out your priorities as an entrepreneur. Whose needs to do you want meet? Those of the US market, or the basic human needs of the developing world, people with disabilities, the elderly? How about products designed with the environment in mind? Your answers to these questions will shape your business from the very beginning. Weigh them carefully. 

=== When is an idea an opportunity? ===
An idea is an opportunity when it is attractive, durable and timely and is anchored in a product or service that creates or adds value for its end buyer or user. The most successful entrepreneurs are opportunity-focused; that is, they start with what customers and the marketplace want and do not lose sight of this. 

=== You have a chance ===
Don't think you can't possibly compete with large, multibillion dollar players. The high-tech industry welcomes small business like no other. The performance of smaller firms in technological innovation is remarkable: 95% of the radical innovations since WWII have come from new small firms. A National Science Foundation study found that smaller firms generated 24 times more innovations per research and development dollar than firms with 10,000 or more employees. 

=== New venture realities ===
 
* Success is highly situational 
* Starting a company is a lot harder than it looks, or you think it will be. 
* Most new ventures are works in process. 
* Speed, adroitness of reflex, and adaptability are crucial. 
* The key to succeeding is failing quickly and recouping quickly. 
* The best entrepreneurs specialize in making &quot;new mistakes&quot; only.

Quotes from &quot;New Venture Creation,&quot; 2004, by Timmons and Spinelli

=== Newton’s recipe for failure: Ignoring customer needs ===
For a high-tech product to succeed it must be polished and refined until its technological capabilities and features meet the needs of the market. Two examples from the dawn of the Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) era in the late 90s illus-trate how—and how not—to bring a high-tech product to market.

Apple’s Newton belongs in the “how not” category. Despite a high-quality handwriting recognition system, the Newton was large and cumbersome, expensive, and prone to problems. Larry Tesler, a former member of the Newton develop-ment group, says that although Apple had learned about key customer needs during market research, it ignored these needs when it came to developing the product, opting instead to push ahead and beat its competitors to launch. Tesler says, “In the end, we cut corners and ignored problems to try to meet a price range and a ship date that we had prema-turely announced to gain an edge in a reckless public relations battle.” (from “Why the Apple Newton Failed,” by Larry Tesler, CEO and chief scientist, Stagecast Software) 
With promotional materials boasting that “Newton can read your handwriting,” Apple launched its product on a plat-form of unsubstantiated claims and inflated expectations, dooming the product to consumer disappointment, ridicule, and elimination from the Apple product line in 1998.

The other side of the story is the PalmPilot. Introduced in 1996, the PalmPilot 1000 won PC Computing’s MVP Usabil-ity Achievement of the Year Award and led to a revolution in handheld computing. Jeff Hawkins, one of the original creators of the PalmPilot, suggests that the device’s commercial success has a lot to do with responding to consumers’ needs, since the major market for handhelds was and is the individual purchase. He maintains that it’s important to make tradeoffs on “what to put in and what not to put in,” so that the product maintains the correct balance of techno-logical features, usability, and affordability.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Social Entrepreneurship ==

=== Making a difference through business ===
If you’re one of those entrepreneurs who wants to help solve some of the world’s problems, this section is for you. And you’re making a wise choice: more and more entrepreneurs are finding that business ventures can make money and improve the world at the same time. 

As discussed in the previous section, a traditional entrepreneur sees an opportunity to make money by fulfilling a consumer or business need, usually in an area they’re familiar with. A social entrepreneur sees an additional opportunity to improve quality of life by fulfilling a social need.  
 
=== What does it mean? ===
The term “social entrepreneur” is used in many different ways. Ashoka’s and The Schwab Foundation’s definitions (see below) aim high. Others define social entrepreneurs as leaders of non-profit organizations that use best business practices to create social change. In for-profit social ventures, a social entrepreneur typically garners the title by simultaneously seeking financial and social returns. 
  
According to J. Gregory Dees, adjunct professor of social entrepreneurship and nonprofit management in Duke University’s Fuqua School of Business, what distinguishes social entrepreneurs is their “explicit and central” mission. They are driven not only by the bottom line, but by a distinct social goal. To quote Dees, “Social entrepreneurs play the role of change agents by:

* Adopting a mission to create and sustain social value (not just private, financial value), 
* Recognizing and relentlessly pursuing new opportunities to serve that mission, 
* Engaging in a process of continuous innovation, adaptation, and learning, 
* Acting boldly without being limited by resources currently in hand, and 
* Exhibiting a heightened sense of accountability to the constituencies served and for the outcomes created.”&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; 

Simply put, social entrepreneurs find innovative ways to create better outcomes for society.

=== Focus on impact ===
Success in a social venture is achieved by maximizing financial returns and impact to the cause, known as Social Return on Investment (SROI). SROI can come in the form of improving people’s lives or reducing environmental harm. Just as any competitive business must create a product to best satisfy its customer’s needs, a social venture must focus on superior quality for both its customers and its cause (and these may be the same). A worthwhile social venture opportunity should include a marketable idea that also provides non-financial returns to the community you intend to serve. 
Idealism will help you construct a vision of what you want to achieve, but to create social value you must find viable ways to produce results.  This involves a mix of passion and practicality. As an entrepreneur, you need to shape your plan around what’s realistically possible, even if you continually redefine what is possible. Entrepreneurship is challenging.  Adding social aims increases the complexity, but also increases the rewards.

=== The triple bottom line ===
No matter what your goals are for your business—to accomplish social change, earn high profits, improve the environment, or all three—it’s useful to think about how you will reach them.  To that end, corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices can be integrated throughout your business’ operations. The Business for Social Responsibility defines CSR as, “achieving commercial success in ways that honor ethical values and respect people, communities, and the natural environment.”&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

This is what’s called the '''triple bottom line''': expanding the spectrum of values and criteria for measuring organizational success to include not only economic, but also environmental and social concerns. For some, a commitment to CSR brings with it a need to institute triple bottom line reporting.

=== A good beginning ===
It can be helpful to incorporate your values from the start. Evidence shows that CSR can help maximize bottom line financial and social benefits. Incorporating your values into the process during the product development stage of your business will help you think of better ideas and evaluate your options more carefully. A philosophy that incorporates respecting people and the environment can be useful in guiding your venture’s growth. Good corporate citizenship will not only give you personal satisfaction, but can resound with employees, funders, customers, suppliers, and your community.

=== Case studies ===
==== Integrating values ====
Seth Goldman founded Honest Tea to fill the gap between the too sweet and the tasteless bottled drinks on the market. He also sought to improve society. Goldman designed a business that completely integrated his philosophy of social responsibility, from the product he sells to the ways it's produced.
 
Goldman believes that Honest Tea has many social benefits. &quot;Every time someone picks up our product instead of one of the sweet teas out there, they are cutting back on the sugar and calories they put into their bodies. Plus, almost all of our line is organic. Every time a tea state or garden switches to organic production from conventional it means there are less toxins being put into the water, land and consumer's bodies. We are also creating relationships with our supplier and partners that enable us to create wealth with them. Tea is one of the few products enjoyed in some of the wealthiest nations but produced by some of the poorest. The disparity really enables you to create wealth through this business.&quot;

&quot;Define why your venture is important to you and what is important about it,&quot; Goldman recommends. &quot;Once you get out there it's kind of easy to lose your way or lose your purpose. I think that's something we have always been very clear about and it's helped us stay disciplined in our approach.&quot;

==== Aiming high ====
Ashoka and the Schwab Foundation, organizations committed to supporting major social change around the world, see social entrepreneurs as revolutionaries.

Ashoka’s definition: The job of a social entrepreneur is to recognize when a part of society is stuck and to provide new ways to get it unstuck. He or she finds what is not working and solves the problem by changing the system, spreading the solution and persuading entire societies to take new leaps. Social entrepreneurs are not content just to give a fish or teach how to fish. They will not rest until they have revolutionized the fishing industry. 

Identifying and solving large-scale social problems requires social entrepreneurs because only they have the committed vision and inexhaustible determination to persist until they have transformed an entire system. The scholar comes to rest when he expresses an idea. The professional succeeds when she solves a client’s problem. The manager calls it quits when he has enabled his organization to succeed. Social entrepreneurs go beyond the immediate problem to fundamentally change communities, societies, the world.

The Schwab Foundation’s definition: A social entrepreneur is a different kind of social leader who identifies and ap-plies practical solutions to social problems by combining innovation, resourcefulness and opportunity; innovates by finding a new product, a new service, or a new approach to a social problem; focuses first and foremost on social value creation and in that spirit, is willing to share openly the innovations and insights of the initiative with a view to its wider replication; doesn’t wait to secure the resources before undertaking the catalytic innovation; is fully accountable to the constituencies s/he serves; resists being trapped by the constraints of ideology or discipline; continuously refines and adapts approaches in response to feedback; has a vision, but also a well-thought out roadmap as to how to attain the goal.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Why Be a Social Entrepreneur? ==
 
=== Look inside ===
What might drive you to social entrepreneurship? While there's no question you can create positive social results simply by participating in the market and being your entrepreneurial self, you need to look inside and see if you want to go further than that. Do you feel a fundamental desire to help people? Do you want to improve the lives of others-give them better chances? Do you want to change the human condition? If so, today's global environment puts you in a unique position to do just that.  
 
=== Opportunity ===
Now more than ever, the world needs your help. Through pollution, overpopulation and abuse of natural resources we're threatening to undercut our own survival. While a small percentage of the world's population lives better than ever before, the majority of people struggle to live through the day. As a student living in America you have an unprecedented opportunity to end the inequity. You can apply your skills -design, technical, business, entrepreneurial-to any number of areas in need: the developing world, the environment, the disabled, the poor, etc. Now is your time. 
 
=== The developing world ===
It has been estimated that 80% (five billion people) of the world's population live in poverty. Statistics show that we're living off our support systems in an unhealthy, degrading, inequitable, and unsustainable manner. Examples of worldwide problems include: 
 
* 20% of the world's population lack clean water
* 40% lack adequate sanitation 
* 20% lack adequate housing 
* 70% unable to read 
* 20% earn less than one dollar a day 
* 20% underfed and 20% overfed 
* 20% suffer from malnutrition (35% under age five) 
* 35,000 people die every day from hunger-related causes 
* 250,000 children die each week of malnutrition and preventable diseases 
* 40% of population are at risk of malaria 
* Deaths from AIDS increased more than six times over the 1990s 
   
Communities facing these challenges include developing countries, indigenous groups, the handicapped and the elderly. Stakeholders and non-governmental organizations can articulate these community needs but often lack the technical expertise and facilities to solve them. Local entrepreneurs with innovative solutions often lack the expertise to implement solutions and commercialize them on a large scale.

This is where you come in. You are a member of a privileged community of thousands of students-a group with the skills and ability to make a difference, but who often aren't aware of their capacity to create change in underserved communities. Be aware! 
 
=== The environment ===
As documented in Al Gore's film, &quot;An Inconvenient Truth,&quot; human activity is contributing to a steady increase in the average temperature of the Earth's atmosphere through the buildup of heat-trapping greenhouse gases. Over time, this increase may be sufficient to cause climatic change. According to the National Academy of Sciences, the Earth's surface temperature has risen by about one degree Fahrenheit in the past century, with accelerated warming during the past two decades.  

Rising global temperatures are expected to raise sea level, change precipitation, and other local climate conditions. Changing regional climate could alter forests, crop yields, and water supplies. It could also affect human health, animals, and many types of ecosystems.  

What can you do to stop this phenomenon with potentially disastrous effects? You can become a social entrepreneur specializing in sustainable development. Sustainable development is meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Sustainable development implies economic growth together with the protection of environmental quality, each reinforcing the other. The essence of this form of development is a stable relationship between human activities and the natural world, which does not diminish the prospects for future generations to enjoy a quality of life at least as good as our own. 
   
=== High-tech help ===
What role can you play as a technological innovator in this struggle? You may have ideas for new technologies that can meet basic needs. You may pursue technology for developing countries (water purification, sanitation, power production, shelter, site planning, infrastructure, food production and distribution, communication), assistive technology for the disabled/elderly (improved wheelchairs, crutches, prosthetics, pharmaceuticals), or technology for the environment (alternative energy and quite a lot more). There are many opportunities to make a difference and make a good living doing it.  
 
=== How big is your footprint? ===
A person's &quot;ecological footprint&quot; is a measurement of  their impact on nature. The average American uses thirty acres to support his or her current lifestyle-that's thirty football fields put together. In comparison, the average Canadian lives on a footprint one-third smaller, and the average Italian on 55% less.
 
How much can nature provide? With a global population of over six billion, nature provides an average of five acres of bioproductive space for every person in the world. When the population grows to ten billion, the available space will be reduced to three acres. This should also give room for at least twenty-five million other species. Already, humanity's footprint may be over 30% larger than our fair share. 

What can we do? We can become part of the sustainability movement and make it possible for everybody to secure their quality of life within the means of nature. 

=== Case Studies ===
==== Loan man ====
Muhammad Yunus is the world's best-known social entrepreneur. Thirty-some years ago, he was a young professor of economics in his native Bangladesh. He was driven to find a way to convince banks to give loans to the poorest people in his country. He was thought to be mad. The poor have no collateral, he was told. Loaning them money is folly. They will never be able to pay you back. So Yunus decided to start a bank for the poor. The first loan was for about 30 US dollars. Today millions, women in particular, have been able to pull themselves out of poverty thanks to the Grameen Bank. The Grameen Bank was the first micro-lending institution in the world. Today, microcredit is mainstreamed even into the most conservative institutions. Yunus changed forever the myth that being poor was synonymous with being a high-risk investment. Grameen's repayment rate over the years has been between 95 and 98%. Other micro-finance institutions across the world that emulated Grameen report the same returns. 

==== Land man ====
Roy Prosterman had a rising career with one of the oldest and most prestigious law firms in New York City. Initially, he found the work fascinating. But, increasingly disheartened by the expenditure of vast sums of money by corporations on legal fees to defend their interests against consumers, he left the firm, and at the invitation of the University of Washington, started teaching. Soon thereafter, Prosterman came upon a law review article about land reform in Latin America that changed his life forever. Inspired by a new life mission, Prosterman founded the Rural Development Institute (RDI) on a shoestring. Its objective was to reform the rural land policies of the world's poorest countries so that farmers could gain land ownership.
 
Today, Prosterman, a true social entrepreneur, is 65 years old. He has been working in land reform for 35 years, focused on building legal capacity in the 35 countries that have sought his help. Because of RDI, 70 million farmers have received land ownership to about 62 million acres, close to 2% of the world's arable land.

=== Brainstorming ===
The starting point of any entrepreneurial venture, social or otherwise, is the idea. In many ways, the quality of your idea determines the success of your venture. So how do you come up with a good one? One way to jumpstart your mind and get thinking creatively is by brainstorming. 

Brainstorming is probably the best-known creative tool. When you brainstorm, you focus on a particular problem and try to come up with many solutions, pushing the outer limits of what is possible. When brainstorming, it's essential for the critics in your group (or in your head) to keep quiet. They can speak up later. 
   
=== Rules for group brainstorming ===
Assuming that you're working as part of a team, we start you off here with a how-to guide on brainstorming together. Sit down with your group, follow these rules and see if you come up with a couple of ideas worth pursuing. 

# Choose a leader who defines the problem and keeps the session on course, discouraging evaluation of the ideas and limiting the time used.
# Make sure the participants are diverse.
# Make the session fun, welcoming wildly impractical ideas along with practical ones.
# Spark off one another's ideas with new ideas.
# Keep some record of the session.
         
Brainstorming has its limitations: it should only be used for generating new ideas and solutions, not for decision-making. It should be targeted to a specific &quot;probortunity&quot; (problem/opportunity). Don't bother brainstorming if you already have several solutions to the problem and are just trying to choose between them. 
   
=== Creating the right environment for brainstorming ===
Most of us have hundreds of good ideas waiting to come out. The challenge is creating an environment where those ideas can come out without fear of making mistakes. This requires the group to actively decide not to judge what anyone puts forward. Here, making &quot;mistakes&quot; and putting forward ideas that don't work is not only acceptable but encouraged. Your ideas are never criticized because they can be used either as a solution or a stimulus for other ideas. 

Brainstorming should remove, or at least reduce, the fear of making mistakes. The professionalism and attitude of the participants is the key to how much inhibitions are reduced. Sticking to the rules is vital to the success of the session. 
 
=== More tools ===
Brainstorming isn't the only way to get those juices flowing. Creative thinking guru Edward de Bono offers a myriad of creative &quot;attention-directing tools.&quot; A few of them include:
 
'''The PMI''' Working intensely for two or three minutes, examine the Pluses (good points), Minuses (bad points) and Interesting points of a given option. Don't evaluate the options, but scan them objectively, challenging your initial reactions. 

'''The CAF''' For this exercise, Consider All the Factors in a given situation, without evaluating them. For example, when buying a used car, consider price, previous history, previous owner, condition of the car, mileage, resale value, gas consumption, serviceability, etc. 

'''Mind-mapping''' This is a technique in which you begin with a central word or concept. Write it on a piece of paper, and around it draw the five to ten main ideas that relate. From each of those, again draw five to ten ideas that relate.
 
=== Don't fall for the first good-lookin' idea that comes along ===
The success or failure of your project does not depend on your team generating the perfect solution on the first try. On the contrary, falling in love with your first idea can get you into big trouble and cause you to miss out on the seemingly dumb idea that might follow immediately in its path. 

Edward de Bono writes that it's important to explore alternatives, because alternatives prevent the mind from settling too quickly on a solution. Working with alternatives certainly doesn't simplify the creative process. Rather, having a lot of alternatives creates confusion and opens the door for brilliant things to happen. 
 
=== Techniques for idea generation ===
The &quot;Classical Invention&quot; approach helps you discover connections by asking questions about your idea. Ask yourself questions about:
   
* A physical object: what are its physical characteristics? What sort of structure does it have? 
* Events: exactly what happened? What was the cause? The consequences? 
* Abstract concepts: how do others define the concept or term? How do you define the term? 
* Propositions: what must be established before people believe the proposition? What counter-arguments must be refuted?   

=== Even more techniques ===
* The journalistic six (who, what, when, where, why, how?) 
* Historical examination 
* Block busting 
* Uses for 
* Improvements to 
* What-iffing 
* Reversal 
* Analogy and metaphor 
* Trigger concepts 
* Checklists 
  
and many more!

=== Brainstorming tips from Ideo ===
Silicon Valley-based Ideo has sparked some of the most innovative products of the past decade - the Apple mouse, the Polaroid I-Zone Pocket Camera, and the Palm V, among others. But Ideo staffers don't just sit around waiting for good ideas to pop into their heads. The company has institutionalized a process whereby ideas are coaxed to the surface through regular, structured brainstorming sessions. At Ideo, idea-generation exercises are &quot;practically a religion,&quot; product development manager Tom Kelley says. Here's a short list of tips from the pros:
  
1. Sharpen the focus&lt;br&gt; 
Start with a well-honed statement of the problem at hand. The best topic statements focus outward on a specific customer need or service enhancement rather than inward on some organizational goal. 

2. Write playful rules&lt;br&gt; 
Ideo's primary brainstorming rules are simple: &quot;Defer judgment&quot; and &quot;One conversation at a time.&quot; The firm believes in its rules so strongly that they're stenciled in eight-inch letters on conference-room walls. &quot;If I'm the facilitator and somebody starts a critique or people start talking, I can enforce the rules without making it feel personal,&quot; Kelley says. Other rules include, &quot;Go for quantity,&quot; &quot;Be visual,&quot; and &quot;Encourage wild ideas.&quot; 

3. Build and jump&lt;br&gt;
Most brainstorming sessions follow a power curve: they start out slowly, build to a crescendo, and then start to plateau. The best facilitators nurture the conversation in its early stages, step out of the way as the ideas start to flow, and then jump in again when energy starts to peter out. 

4. Get physical&lt;br&gt; 
At Ideo, brainstorming sessions are often occasions for show-and-tell. Participants bring examples of competitors' products, objects that relate to the problem, or elegant solutions from other fields as springboards for ideas. Ideo also keeps materials on hand&amp;mdash;blocks, foam core, tubing&amp;mdash;to build crude models of a concept.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Evaluating Your Idea''' ==
 
'''Who's gonna buy this?'''&lt;br&gt;  
In the business world, good ideas must pass one test: can they generate a profit? No idea is good, ultimately, if it can't pass this test. This means that someone, somewhere has to pay you more money for your product or service than it costs to produce it. Really, it's that simple-and that challenging. Perhaps the most important part of any business plan is an articulation of the customer. Why will they buy it? When? Where? For how much? 
 
Of course other characteristics are important too: does the idea have a social good or at least do no harm? How challenging is it to make? Is it within the capabilities of the team? Sometimes student teams have great ideas but no way in the world of executing them. You may want to save your great idea until you've had a little more experience with something that's more manageable. Can you raise enough money to finance your idea? Often great ideas fail this test: simply put, they require too much capital to prove themselves.  
   
'''You're not the only genius out there'''&lt;br&gt; 
So you've got a great, and maybe realistic, idea. You know what? Somebody else is probably working on a solution to the same problem. That's not necessarily a bad thing. A problem is only worth solving if it's a real problem that affects a real population. And you're probably not the only one who's noticed this problem. If you are, your product might be ahead of its time and have a hard time gaining acceptance in the marketplace. The best ideas don't happen in isolation; they're the result of a shared need. The need is what creates the market for your idea. The fact that others may have worked on addressing the same need heightens the importance of finding your own unique slant on the idea.  
   
'''Talk about it'''&lt;br&gt; 
Talk about your idea with a lot of people, especially people with varied perspectives. But talk with people you trust. (And if you have any concerns about protecting your idea, talk to an intellectual property attorney-see the section &quot;Your Intellectual Property.&quot;) It's good to surround yourself with positive people who will give you a lot of encouragement, but don't limit your conversations to people already on your side: talk with people who will challenge your ideas and give you creative suggestions. Talk with people with very different backgrounds from yours. Investigate companies that are doing work similar to yours, and visit some who are doing things that are totally different, and doing them well. See what you can learn from them. Listen to everyone responding to your idea. You may not agree with them, and you definitely don't have to take their advice, but there may be a gem hidden in even the most mundane or unpleasant piece of feedback.  
   
'''Try it out'''&lt;br&gt; 
Experiment with your ideas while they're still in the raw stage. Don't wait until you've come up with a perfect plan. Depending on the nature of your enterprise, your experimentation can take the form of actually making the product over and over until it comes out the way you want it, or running your ideas by a test audience to gauge its reaction.  
   
'''Equip yourself'''&lt;br&gt; 
Take advantage of all the tools and resources available to you. Spend time in your school's library or entrepreneurial research center. Read books and magazines, watch videos (visit eclips.cornell.edu for a wealth of entrepreneurship-related video clips), and find out what experienced entrepreneurs have to say. Subscribe to an entrepreneurship magazine (Entrepreneur, Fast Company, Inc.), and spend time reading online articles. Find out what other resources they recommend, and if your school library doesn't have them, try inter-library loan. Join an entrepreneurship club or a similar community-based organization. Most importantly, get to know experienced entrepreneurs face-to-face, and listen to their stories.  
   
'''Check in with yourself'''&lt;br&gt; 
Now why are you doing this again? Review your purpose in this project-what you hope to achieve, and what problem you hope to solve. It's okay if your purpose has changed since the project's outset. It will probably change many more times before you're through.  
   
'''The validation phase'''&lt;br&gt;  
Once you've tested your idea with constituents, colleagues and mentors, and adjusted the idea to the point where you feel ready to take it to the public, seek external validation to get the funding and other support necessary to move ahead. Validation is the main purpose of a business plan. A business plan lays out your idea in a holistic manner so that prospective funders can enter into a partnership with confidence. See section 4, The Plan, for much more information on business plans.

'''Trial and error'''&lt;br&gt; 
Thomas Edison wasn't interested in theory, using instead a painstaking method of trial and error. An example is his perfection of the light bulb. Numerous individuals had worked on the light bulb in the past, but the major stumbling block had been the short lifespan of the filaments. Over the course of 1878-79 Edison and his staff tested literally thousands of different substances as filaments and sent men all over the world to try to find better materials. On October 21-22, 1879, he carbonized a piece of sewing thread to form a filament. It burnt 13.5 hours - a huge breakthrough. Changing the shape of the filament to a horseshoe increased the life span to over 100 hours. Through trial and error Edison and his colleagues had invented a practical light bulb, paving the way for the establishment of the electrical power system. 


'''Great ideas have three key elements'''&lt;br&gt; 
All big ideas share at least one of three business objectives: improved efficiency, greater effectiveness, or innovations in products or processes. In a way, it's an exhaustive set of possibilities. You do things right, you do the right thing, or you do something new.

'''A drive to fly'''&lt;br&gt; 
In perfecting a heavier-than-air flying aircraft and revolutionizing transport in the process the Wright brothers, Wilbur and Orville, made numerous errors and created hundreds of failed prototypes. Yet they kept pushing and innovating and eventually made history on Kitty Hawk beach December 17, 1903. Here's how they did it.
 
Research&lt;br&gt; 
First, the Wright brothers performed a literature search to find out the state of aeronautical knowledge at the time. They wrote to the Smithsonian and obtained technical papers regarding aerodynamics. They read about the works of Cayley and Langley and the hang-gliding flights of Otto Lilienthal. 

Idea generation&lt;br&gt; 
Soon they (correctly) realized that control of the flying aircraft would be the most crucial and hardest problem to solve. They observed large gliding birds and started putting down some ideas about roll, pitch, and yaw. 

Testing&lt;br&gt; 
They tested their ideas on a series of unpowered aircraft between 1900 and 1902, but these early kite and glider experiments failed to meet the brothers' performance goals. So they built a wind tunnel and tested over two hundred different wings and airfoil models to improve performance. Their very successful 1902 aircraft was based on the new data and led directly to the historical 1903 run at Kitty Hawk.  

Nonstop improvements&lt;br&gt; 
While the design of the airframe of the Wright aircraft remained nearly the same for years, the brothers continually improved and upgraded their engine design. Between 1903 and 1913 the engine power increased from 12 horsepower to nearly 75 horsepower.  

They moved their flight testing from Kitty Hawk to their home town of Dayton, Ohio, and flew their new aircraft at Huffman's Field on the edge of town. With new, more powerful aircraft, they were able to stay aloft for up to a half hour, fly figure eights, and even take passengers up for a ride. The age of the airplane had arrived.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Your Intellectual Property''' ==
 
'''Intellectual property defined'''&lt;br&gt;  
Once you and your team have a great, well-evaluated idea, you need to make sure no one steals it before you can get it to market. Unfortunately, the only way to keep your idea totally safe is to keep it locked up inside your brain. Probably the best approach is somewhere between total secrecy and publicly broadcasting your idea. As ex-Apple evangelist Guy Kawasaki puts it, if it's really a good idea, lots of people have probably already thought of it. To turn your idea into a commercially viable product, you'll need to judiciously share it with others. 
 
'''A note on lawyers'''&lt;br&gt; 
Intellectual property lawyers are specialists. If you're serious about patenting an idea, you probably need one. They're generally not cheap, but they do focus on particular scientific disciplines, making it worth your while to find a good one. You also need a general business lawyer or corporate counsel who can advise you on everything from incorporation to sales contracts 
 
'''Knowledge is power'''&lt;br&gt;  
Naturally, you want to take whatever steps you can to protect your ideas. The following definitions will help you understand the differences between various types of intellectual property protection. 
 
'''The patent'''&lt;br&gt; 
When you patent a product or an idea in the US, the government prohibits others from making your invention for up to twenty years. To get a patent, you have to file an application that describes your invention thoroughly, and explains why it should be considered novel. If the patent is granted, your invention is made public, so only the law prevents others from copying it. Patents can only be granted to inventors (not companies), so companies usually require their employees to sign over patent rights when they take up employment. 

Patenting isn't the ideal solution for every product-it can be complicated and expensive. Sometimes it's a better decision just to keep your idea or formula as secret as possible. An intellectual property attorney can advise you on whether filing for a patent is the best approach for protecting your idea. 
 
'''Copyrights'''&lt;br&gt;  
Copyrights protect written materials of all kinds, including software. They don't protect trade secrets. For example, if you publish information about your product, and the information that you publish is copyrighted, only the expression of the information, or the particular phrasing you choose, is protected-not the information itself. Once again, seek the advice of an intellectual property attorney regarding the correct procedure for copyrighting your work under federal law. 
 
'''Trademarks'''&lt;br&gt;  
Trademarks are words or design elements, registered with the US Patent and Trademark Office, that represent a company or product. They must be registered to be protected. Usually before you can register a trademark, you need to conduct a search-both through the USPTO and among unregistered usage-to see if any other company is already using it. Talk to your intellectual property attorney! 
 
'''Trade secrets'''&lt;br&gt;  
Coca-Cola is an example of a company that uses trade secrets rather than a patent to protect its secret formula. If the Coke formula had been patented, the information would have been made public, and the patent would have protected the product for only twenty years. A company that uses trade secret protection has to make efforts to prevent disclosure of its important ideas-once ideas have leaked, nothing will prevent other companies from using them. Companies keeping trade secrets require employees and investors to sign confidentiality agreements. Trade secret laws and protections vary from state to state. You need to know the limits of trade secret law within your state-again, an intellectual property lawyer can help. 
 
'''Keep a journal'''&lt;br&gt;  
The major patent systems in use worldwide include those of the US, the EU, and now China and India. Although the systems are getting closer, there is still one key difference between the US system and the others: the US awards a patent to the &quot;first to invent&quot; while the others award it to the &quot;first to file.&quot; &quot;First to invent&quot; means that even if someone files with the USPTO before you do, you can still be granted the patent if you can prove that you came up with the idea first. Thus, in the US you need to  keep bound notebooks recording the substance and date/time of your daily work, and make sure the pages are signed and kept in a safe place. A number of other things to remember: don't publish a paper and forget to file a patent application within a year; don't talk about the specifics of your invention in a meeting without having the attendees sign confidential disclosure agreements; don't show the embodiment of the invention (e.g., a prototype) at a trade show before filing a patent application. A discussion with an IP attorney, a mentor or faculty member, or with the technology transfer office at your university can provide additional details.

'''Adventures in IP'''&lt;br&gt; 
Professional inventor Bob Shomo knows IP troubles. In the 1970s, Shomo developed and patented a vibration-free tennis racket. Wilson, the largest US manufacturer of tennis rackets, was interested. Shomo met with Wilson representatives in Chicago, giving them full know-how, engineering and test data, and a dozen rackets. They settled on a royalty rate, and scheduled a final meeting. 

Then the meeting was cancelled. Wilson went through a major management shakeup, and when things settled down, Shomo got back in touch with his only contact left. &quot;Yes, Wilson's still interested. Yes, they still have his data and his rackets.&quot; 

After several months of trying to prod Wilson into action, they said, &quot;Well, our patent attorney thinks you have a weak patent-we're going to go ahead and do our own version.&quot; That version came on the market as the Wilson Air-Shell. Wilson's design was identical, except that they used one piece for the handle, whereas Shomo's racket used two pieces. Technically, they weren't infringing his patent.

'''Protecting your intellectual property'''&lt;br&gt; 
Protecting your intellectual property can get complex-and expensive. You probably don't want to spend endless hours sorting through legalisms with attorneys and paying huge fees to do so. On the other hand, you certainly don't want to leave yourself legally exposed or squander a competitive advantage because you didn't do what was legally necessary. So here are some tips for maximizing your protection at the lowest possible cost. 

&lt;i&gt;Patent only what is important&lt;/i&gt;. If patent office examiners or competing individuals or companies challenge your patent, the legal fees can soar. You must conclude first that you need the protection, and second that you will recover much more than your expenditure in additional long-term sales. 

&lt;i&gt;Get the best trademark protection as early as possible&lt;/i&gt;. Registering a trademark is a much simpler procedure than getting a patent. A trademark search can usually be done for a few hundred dollars. 

&lt;i&gt;Choose the right form of protection&lt;/i&gt;. Don't assume that because copyright protection is cheaper to obtain than patent protection you should automatically go the less expensive route. Spend the $200 or $300 it might cost to get sound legal advice. 

&lt;i&gt;Warn potential violators that you are serious&lt;/i&gt;. You should warn everyone who has access to important information that the nondisclosure and other agreements they sign are not just a formality. If someone does violate your IP, be prepared to take legal action to set an example that will become known to others. 

&lt;i&gt;Plan for information protection&lt;/i&gt;. In the start-up phase, be prepared to make various disclosures of important information. That information may be contained in a business plan, lists of prospects, supplier names, production specifications, and various other data essential to starting your business.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''A sense of success: John Osher''' ==

What do Hasbro, Gerber, and Proctor &amp; Gamble have in common? They all bought businesses started by John Osher. Toys, baby products, and the bestselling SpinBrush toothbrush are only some of the concepts that Osher has launched into successful ventures. He's been starting businesses since the age of eight, and believes he possesses a unique worldview-just as a comedian sees humor in the everyday, Osher sees opportunity. 

People have caught on, and now Osher is surrounded by great ideas-aspiring inventors send him their plans and he mentors student teams.  However, Osher is quick to point out that it's the opportunity that matters, not the idea. There are tons of good ideas, Osher says, that shouldn't be pursued.  

Osher has developed a long list of criteria to distinguish a worthwhile opportunity, but the essence is captured in three points: (1) there must be a need which will be satisfied; (2) there must be a way to satisfy the need; and (3) there must be a way to communicate the product's value.  

These three criteria guided him in the development of the SpinBrush.  

According to Osher, the electronic toothbrush was a superior innovation, but one that only rich people could afford; he realized there was a need for an inexpensive version for ordinary consumers. But such an innovation would only be accepted if it could sell for just a few dollars more than a manual brush, and there had to be an easy way to connect the product with customers. After his design team came up with a model that could retail for five dollars or less, they developed &quot;try me&quot; packaging, enabling shoppers to observe the spinning action in the store. The product took off, and the two separate elements were crucial in that success: if the cost had been higher, or expensive advertising was needed to promote it, Osher is convinced that the opportunity would have been lost.  

Along with an idea, an entrepreneur must have guts and skills (and a skilled team) to execute it. According to Osher, people driven to start new ventures are born with a personality that makes them inclined to say, &quot;I'm going to do it, and lead, and find a way.&quot; They are natural leaders who organize others and garner the resources to make things happen. However, it's ultimately not drive that matters the most. Osher believes that a flawed product, rather than poor execution, is the demise of most failed businesses. Paradoxically, one can make mistakes only if the idea is truly feasible.  

This notion of viability is the pinnacle of Osher's product development philosophy. Too often, inventors rush to commercialize an idea. More time and energy should be focused on understanding the market and adapting the product until it is a perfect fit. This process involves examining current products and testing the atmosphere in the industry and the retail environment. The inventor must be open to criticism and be willing to continually shift and make changes in response to better information. 

Although Osher has sold many of his businesses, he doesn't focus on creating good acquisition targets. His advice is to build value. &quot;Don't build a one-shot wonder product. A valuable business will have a good product, a proprietary position, and will be profitable, with staying products. Once this is achieved, the owner can choose how to proceed.&quot;   If the choice is to sell, Osher advises to &quot;do your homework to find the right match.&quot; In the case of SpinBrush, Osher examined the industry and discovered that Crest, one of Proctor &amp; Gamble's most prominent brands, had fallen behind its competitor, Colgate. This made SpinBrush a good strategic fit for P&amp;G, who paid handsomely for the opportunity to revive its brand with the popular product. 

The SpinBrush journey was unique for Osher because it was almost flawless. His experience makes him an expert in business creation; but he expects future ventures will run less smoothly. Despite that reality, you can look for Osher's next product on the shelf soon...when the opportunity is just right.

      <comment>/* Ideals on wheels: Ross Evans and Xtracycle */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Ideals on wheels: Ross Evans and Xtracycle''' ==
 
As a college student, Ross Evans was a reluctant to become an entrepreneur because he believed idealism and business didn't mix.  Years later his innovations haven't made him rich, but they have promoted his ideals by creating economic prosperity in the developing world and changing attitudes in the US. 

As an undergraduate with a passion for bicycles and their potential role in economic development, Evans went to Nicaragua after his freshman year at Stanford to teach local people how to build cargo bikes. His experience there as well as his prior research convinced him there were better alternatives to the cargo bike designs used in the developing world. 

Evans noted that cargo bikes, with two front wheels and big baskets, were not ideal for the average user. He compares the cargo bike to a UHaul truck in the US: most people don't drive them on a regular basis and instead opt for SUVs, station wagons, and minivans to carry things on a daily basis. In the same way, Evans determined that an intermediate form of bicycle was missing from the developing world. He began designing prototypes of a bike extension kit that would enable users to modify their existing two-wheel bikes to carry cargo. &quot;The idea was to look at the available resources, adapt them to make this concept of a longer bike that could carry cargo, and make it as cheap as possible, really maneuverable, easy to load, and able to carry the loads that people needed to carry.&quot; Evans began with a welded-on attachment and developed it into a bolt-on design during a Hampshire College entrepreneurship fellowship. 

It was the faculty mentors at Hampshire College that first pushed Evans to turn his product into a company. Evans says that one advisor &quot;opened my mind to the possibility of business as a mechanism or tool, and using the market to figure my ideas out. Up until this time I was really an idealist about how I wanted to get this out there. I was more into the non-profit mentality and thought that the bad guys were out there in business and we were trying to find ways to get around that.&quot;  

Evans was also tired of applying for grants. He decided to create a business that would sell the bike attachments to those who could afford them in developing countries and use the proceeds to fund his developing world distribution. 

The venture has been a success. Over time, the business split into two arms-Xtracycle is the for-profit company selling to US customers, and Worldbike is the nonprofit selling in the developing world. Evans is involved in the day-to-day management of Xtracycle, and is a board member of Worldbike. The product concept for each company is similar, although the developing world product costs $25 while the US counterpart, with a more sophisticated design, costs around $300. The for-profit side has not reached the point of financially supporting the other, but it has helped by leveraging contacts.  

In the US, sales are strong for a niche product, but Evans isn't satisfied with that status. &quot;Our whole intention is to go big,&quot; he says. Just as Worldbike has a mission to improve transportation options in poor countries, Xtracycle has a mission to improve transportation options in the US. However, this requires fundamentally changing American culture to embrace more sustainable ways of getting around. It's a formidable task, as most  Americans don't even consider a bicycle as an alternative to a car.  

Xtracycle is trying to accomplish the task not by selling a better bicycle, but selling a better lifestyle. Evans and his team believe that &quot;most people would like to get back to a simpler life. They would like to be healthier. They would like to interact with people more, look thinner, be more adventurous. These are intangible but real values that people have lost.&quot; Evans admits it would have been much easier to start a business with a product people know they need. The process of educating potential customers and convincing them of the product's life-changing impact is challenging.  

With limited resources, Xtracycle relies on a core of volunteers who &quot;believe deeply in the vision and want to see it happen.&quot; They are continually thinking of innovative ways to create awareness. Evans believes the acceptance of his product may one day exceed that of the mountain bike, which seemed novel when most bikes had skinny tires. &quot;It took about ten years to catch on, but now most people have mountain bikes. Mountain bikes aren't even inherently useful.&quot;

      <comment>/* Identifying Your Customers */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Identifying Your Customers''' ==
 
'''Know who you’re selling to'''&lt;br&gt; 
Every entrepreneur has, in the back of her mind, a mental picture of the prototypical customer. The question is whether this image is based in reality. Does this ideal customer exist? What if she does, but it turns out that she doesn’t want to buy your product? 

As you learn more about your market,you may need to be flexible and willing to change your image of both the customer and the product itself. Professor Kathleen Siders of Babson College says, “Entrepreneurs think they have divine intuition, which is fine if you’re part of the audience you are trying to reach. But when you move outside that market, your gut instinct can let you down.” 
 
'''Basic market identification'''&lt;br&gt; 
Identifying your customer begins with formulating a value proposition. It’s from here that the most important work starts. You have to be able to answer the question “To whom is this proposition of value?” The end user might be consumers, operations, or development. The proposition might be valuable to industry, education, or government. Companies intending to make a profit need to ask themselves,  
 
* Will the proposition reduce costs?  
* Will it improve efficiency?  
* Will it add value to what’s already out there?  
* Will it eliminate waste?  
* Will it serve as a replacement technology, or eliminate the need for something?  
* What is the potential market value of the proposition to investors?  
   
This line of questioning also has to address the scale of the market. Will it be a family-owned business or a lifestyle business with limited growth? Or does the team have an appetite to think bigger—regional, national or global?  
 
'''Make it simple'''&lt;br&gt; 
Your value proposition should be easy to understand. If you have a hard time describing the benefits of your product to potential users, they probably won’t figure it out for themselves.  
 
'''Market segmentation'''&lt;br&gt; 
When trying to answer the question “To whom is this proposition of value?” it helps to simplify things by breaking the market down into components. There are three broad categories of customers who could buy your product: individuals, channels (covered later), and organizations. Each of these categories can be further broken down into smaller segments. This is called market segmentation—picking out the particular groups of people/organizations that benefit from your product, and selling to them. Individuals can be segmented by: 
 
* Geography 
* Income 
* Age 
* Interests 
* Gender 
* Nationality/ethnicity 
   
Whereas organizations can be segmented by: 
 
* Industry 
* Size 
* Function 
* Level and type of individuals within the organization 
   
Many segmentation schemes are combinations of the above lists. For example, let’s say a venture developing an innovative digital storage product decides to sell only to organizations, not individuals. It segments its potential market by size of organization, size of data storage requirements, and need for speed of retrieval. That leads to a focus on large financial institutions and large medical centers. Within those targeted organizations, the importance and cost of the purchase dictates that the venture focuses on selling only to “C-level” executives: the CIO, CFO, etc. Finally, as the technology is very new, the venture team chooses to target the executives that are technology enthusiasts—people who love new technology for its own sake, and are often willing to look at it in preliminary form. 
 
'''Distribution'''&lt;br&gt; 
Inexperienced teams often neglect the question of distribution: How will the product get to the end user? We cover this in more detail in section 2.3, but for now, in order to develop a complete marketing plan your team must determine what the revenue scale and cost structure will be over a five-year period.  

The second part of distribution is secondary expenses, or selling costs. What will it cost you to get the product to the end user? Relevant questions include: What distribution channels will you use? What threats or opportunities does this proposition offer to the industry? Will the product use a technology similar to one already in existence, or will it replace current technologies? 

Awareness of the market is crucial to new businesses that want to convince investors that they have an opportunity worth funding. The only way to gather this information is through thorough market research.

'''Failure to research customers can be costly'''&lt;br&gt;  
Darlene Mann, serial entrepreneur and General Partner of Onset Ventures, has some wisdom to share with new entrepreneurs.
 
“In 1990, I was a director of product marketing at Verity, Inc., which made sophisticated software for document search and retrieval. We made the assumption that our product would be managed by high-caliber technicians at the companies that used it, but because of our software’s complexity, it was difficult to set up and maintain. We thought the product was important enough to our customers for them to justify using highly-skilled personnel to run it, but actually our customers felt they had scarce resources and that it was difficult to get people with the skills needed to use it. In fact, we had only one customer that successfully installed the software on their own: NASA’s Jet Propulsion Labs. A clear sign to us that maybe you did have to be a rocket scientist to use it. 

Our solution was to reengineer the software to make it simpler to install and use. We did that, and the product was very successful, but the delay cost us a year and we lost significant repeat sales early on because we didn’t do our homework. Had we simply started by asking ourselves and our customers the questions we should have, we wouldn’t have wasted all that time and money.” 


'''Marketing for the social entrepreneur'''&lt;br&gt; 
Social marketing generates awareness of a social entrepreneur’s venture by using concepts borrowed from commercial marketing. 

Here are some key points:
    
* The ultimate objective of social marketing is to influence action 
* People take action when they believe benefits outweigh costs 
* Effective social marketers base their message on an understanding of the target audience’s perceptions 
* Target audiences are seldom uniform in their responses to marketing efforts, and should be partitioned into segments 
* Social marketers must be aware of the constantly changing marketplace and rapidly adjust their marketing strategies and tactics accordingly 
* Marketing efforts must incorporate the 4 Ps:  
	 
&amp;mdash;Create an enticing Product (the outcome of the program);&lt;br&gt;  
&amp;mdash;Minimize the Price the target audience pays in the exchange;&lt;br&gt;  
&amp;mdash;Advertise in Places that reach the audience and fit its lifestyles;&lt;br&gt;  
&amp;mdash;Promote the exchange creatively and through channels and tactics that maximize desired responses  
	 
To summarize: 
   
* Action is the objective 
* The target audience is the focus 
* The exchange is critical  
* Segment markets  
* Use the four Ps  
* Analyze and beware of competition  
* Monitor and be flexible

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Evaluating the Market''' ==
 
'''It only sounds scary'''&lt;br&gt; 
Market research sounds like something reserved for the Coca-Colas of the world—corporate giants trying to learn whether a new product will make them millions overnight. In fact, good market research is not only accessible to you, but critical to your product’s success. So what is it? Market research takes on many different forms, but a standard, broad definition is the following: market research is the systematic collection, analysis, and reporting of data about the market and its preferences, opinions, trends, and plans. 

There are a wide variety of affordable market research techniques for you to choose from. 
 
'''Secondary research'''&lt;br&gt; 
Although the name might lead you to think otherwise, most people begin with secondary research. Secondary research involves consulting published reports to find out: 
 
* Who makes up your target market 
* The needs of your market 
* The size of the potential market 
 
The information needed to perform secondary research is easily available, and it’s often free. The most accessible sources include: 
 
* Web-based directories and resources 
* Nonprofit agencies 
* Government agencies 
* Back issues of magazines and newspapers 
   
Secondary research can sometimes lead you to contradictory or inaccurate conclusions. It can be helpful, however, in forming a preliminary research strategy. 
 
'''Primary research'''&lt;br&gt; 
Primary research is more expensive than secondary research, but the results are more accurate and conclusive. Primary research helps you get up close with your customers, finding out who they are and what they want. There are two broad categories of primary research: qualitative and quantitative. 

Using small groups of people, qualitative research helps answer a specific question about your product or your customers, and may include one-on-one interviews or focus groups. Focus groups typically gather about ten people together to discuss or react to a product. The session may be moderated by a professional facilitator who can ask probing questions and help stimulate rich data. Holding more than one session is useful; focus group participants are usually paid. 

While qualitative research isn’t particularly useful for predicting sales, it is a very effective tool in getting to know your customer. 

Quantitative research involves surveys of large numbers of people, and can be statistically validated. It makes a better tool than qualitative research for predicting sales. 

A survey targets customers or potential customers, and can be administered via phone, mail, e-mail, or the Web. Surveys get the best response when there is some kind of reward for participating. It may be worthwhile to hire a professional firm to both administer the survey and  analyze the data. Phone and mail surveys are expensive and are not cost-effective unless a significant number of people are motivated to respond. E-mail and online surveys are much cheaper, but they limit the target population to computer users (which may or may not be problematic, depending on the nature of your product). 
 
'''Beyond tradition'''&lt;br&gt; 
Sometimes traditional market research doesn’t meet the mark. Some of the most successful companies opt for creative market research methods that bring them face-to-face with consumers on their own turf. Focus groups and surveys create a laboratory-like environment where people may have trouble expressing their true feelings (for example, says Growing Healthy baby food founder Julia Knight, “What mother, especially in front of other mothers, would really tell you that she spent more on cat food than on baby food?”); using newer methods, companies watch customers in stores and in their homes to observe how they purchase and use products.  
 
'''Data and more data'''&lt;br&gt; 
No matter how you go about it, performing market research is not a one-time activity. There will be a back-and-forth between modes of research: you’ll do a bit of secondary research so you can talk to people, then do primary, then go back to secondary. The primary helps orient you and allows you to pick up key concepts and words for searching.  

Above all, you need to keep a steady flow of data coming in to help you make decisions about next steps. The type of data you collect depends on exactly what you need to learn about the market. Market research is a worthwhile investment which, if you do it right, will enable you to avoid fatal missteps.

'''I can’t afford formal market research'''&lt;br&gt; 
Looking for a cheap and easy way to do market research? Contact would-be customers for advice. 

When Karen Scott got started in the mail-order baby products business, she put together her own focus group -- using the local newspaper. After clipping 250 birth announcements, Scott contacted the new moms. She sent them surveys and conducted phone interviews, asking what products they would find interesting or useful. Based on the responses, Scott added more travel products at her company, Chelsea &amp; Scott, in Lake Bluff, Ill. Ten years later, travel products are top sellers at the $28 million business.
 

'''Research tips'''&lt;br&gt; 
For good secondary research resources, visit your school library. There you can access online fee-for-service data sets, including referred literature, trade literature, and large data bases of newspapers from around the globe. Government sites like the Census, USDA (for food and agriculture), DoE (energy), EPA (environment), and CDC and NIH (medical) are all very helpful as well. 

Also, try http://www.fedstats.gov for a catalog of sites with government research statistics. 


'''Innovative market research techniques'''&lt;br&gt; 
The following are examples of ways that companies are breaking away from traditional market research techniques by getting out of the laboratory and into the space where people live. 

No babies in frozen foods&lt;br&gt; 
Julia Knight, founder of frozen baby food company Growing Healthy, dressed like a shopper and cruised the frozen food aisle to watch parents at work. She discovered that children didn’t like that cold area of the store, and pressured their parents to move on before the parents had a chance to carefully observe and consider the product. Knight lobbied supermarkets to place cutaway freezers in the baby food section, thus creating a more hospitable market for her product. 

The truth about toys&lt;br&gt; 
Brendan Boyle and Fern Mandelbaum of Skyline Products, Inc. set up focus play groups for 6-8 children. With the kids, they got down on the ground and learned firsthand what was appealing or not appealing about the toys they planned to market. Although they found that the children were pretty frank in their responses, the pair learned even more by asking parents what the children said in the car on the ride home. In some cases, the children revealed more about their true likes and dislikes to their parents than they would to strangers. 

Creating a native habitat&lt;br&gt;
Judy George, CEO and founder of furniture chain Domain Stores, placed a video camera in one of her stores to observe customer behavior. Her tapes revealed that nearly all of the customers arrived in pairs. The male partners seemed uncomfortable in the environment, creating pressure on the females to leave the store before they had an opportunity to make purchasing decisions. George was able to combat this situation by creating comfortable spaces for men to sit and watch sports on television while the women explored. 

From “The New Market Research,” by Joshua D. Macht, Inc. Magazine, July 1, 1998.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Reaching the Customer''' ==
'''Where to sell'''&lt;br&gt; 
You may have figured out who your customers are and what they like, but now you have to figure out how your product will get into their hands.  That means determining where your customers buy items like yours, or how they would buy them if they could. Some of the options are: 
 
* On the shelf of a store 
* Online 
* Through a distributor 
* In a catalog 
* Directly from a salesperson 
   
In deciding among your options, consider how your customers will recognize the value of your product, whether the conditions will be favorable for purchasing, and what it will cost you. Direct sales methods enable you (or a salesperson working for you) to tailor the message to the individual customer and allow you to answer questions and get feedback during the sales process. But be aware: using one-on-one techniques are expensive. Catalogs and websites might be cheaper options, but they make connecting with individual customers more difficult. Your sales methods should be appropriate for the complexity of the product and the message you are trying to convey. 

Products are easier to sell when consumers clearly recognize their benefits. Buyers may resist buying your product if you try to make them alter their habits. Greater convenience, lower cost, or higher quality can convince customers to change their buying behavior. In fact, some businesses are successful simply because they sell something in a different way (like Amazon.com and eBay). You should weigh the tradeoffs when you consider any distribution choice that requires the customer to think differently or take a risk.  
 
'''Links in the chain'''&lt;br&gt;
There might be many links between you and the ultimate customer.  This means you will have more than one type of customer—such as a distributor or salesperson—that you have to think about. Your product has to create value for them, too.
 
Examples of these links in the chain include distributors, Value Added Resellers (VARs) and Value Added Distributors (VADs), Systems Integrators (SIs), Manufacturer’s representatives, Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), and strategic partners. See the glossary at the back of the book for more information on each of these middle men.
  
Every one of the above will want its own profits, so consider the benefits your products will gain from intermediaries. Understanding their incentives is the key to building the right relationships. You don’t want the layers to make it harder to connect with your customer. Offer intermediaries a compelling value so they will be as aggressive selling your product as you would be. Find out how you can benefit from their customer relationships and market knowledge in return. 
 
'''What to charge'''&lt;br&gt; 
The price of your product is, of course, extremely important. Price too high and few will buy, price too low and you lose money. Pricing is also a form of communication between you and your customer; price it wrong, and the customer might come away with a bad impression of you and your product. Consider the following factors in pricing your product: 
 
'''Willingness to pay'''  Think about how many customers you will gain if you lower the price, or how many you will lose if you raise the price. Be careful about the distinction between “worth” and “willingness to pay.” Just because people tell you that they think the product is worth $50 doesn’t mean they’ll actually buy it at that price.  

'''Cost'''  To make a profit, you must charge the customer more than it costs you to make the product. That’s obvious. But also consider all of the mark-ups through the chain before the product gets to your customer.  Salespeople, distributors, retail outlets, and all the other links in the chain need to make a profit too. 

'''Competing products'''  Consider what alternatives the customer has and how your price will influence his buying decision. 

'''Sticker shock''' This is when someone looks at the price of a product and says, “No way I’d buy at that price!” Different markets have different sticker shock points (writing utensils vs. cars, for instance). Know your market’s sticker shock point. 

'''Perfect for you or the customer?'''&lt;br&gt; 
The product is supposed to satisfy the customer. That means if the cost of making the product exceeds the price that your customers will pay for it, you must rework it. You may have to find alternative solutions to the problems you solved in the design phase. If that doesn’t work, consider what features are least important to the customer and cut costs by weakening or eliminating them. This process may be frustrating, but for a product to be viable in the market, the design and the price have to be desirable to the customer.

'''A low-risk distribution model for a start-up'''&lt;br&gt; 
Fluent Systems found an effective model for product distribution. The Fluent E-Team, originally formed at the University of Madison Wisconsin, devised the Wireless NH3 Monitor to help farmers apply ammonia nitrate fertilizer more efficiently to fields. The team relied on free product publicity provided by trade journal articles to pique the interest of end users. They then made the product available to consumers through a network of distributors. In the end, after less than a year of product sales, Fluent sold to Raven Industries for $1 million. 

Fluent president Chad Sorenson says that in the product’s first season, a handful of fertilizer dealers were offered exclusive regional distributorship of the NH3 Monitor. In exchange, these distributors were required to purchase a minimum inventory of monitors. Sorenson says, “We had the luxury of selling a product not available anywhere else. If you create a product of value and you’re convinced that distributors will make money, you have some bargaining power, even though you’re a small producer. We wanted our distributors to have a vested interest in moving the product like we did. If we had distributed the units on a consignment basis, our distributors wouldn’t have had any stake, and we would have had to finance our own inventory. 

'''Diversification = survival'''&lt;br&gt;
In 1999, former economics professor and entrepreneur Dick Sabot co-founded eZiba, an e-commerce company selling handcrafted products made by individuals in the developing world. After the dotcom bubble burst, eZiba was listed by Forrester Research as one of the companies that would not only survive but benefit from the Darwinian shakeout (along with amazon.com, Wal-Mart and e-Bay). Why the success? Sabot points to the fact that eZiba didn’t remain exclusively an e-commerce business for long. As soon as possible, the company diversified its channels, reaching the customer through an award-winning catalog and retail stores on top of the website. Says Sabot: 

“EZiba was one of the first e-commerce businesses to recognize it needed to go multi-channel. We had to find ways to generate traffic, and the portal sites just weren’t doing the job. So we experimented with a catalog that would arouse people’s interest in eZiba and bring them to the website; the catalog worked well and became increasingly cost-effective. Then the opportunity to expand into brick and mortar stores presented itself, and we jumped on it. So we now view ourselves as a multi-channel retailer. There is an online side to the business, but there’s also the catalog—millions of copies of which are distributed every year to households all over the country. The catalog is the biggest driver of eyeballs to the website and the biggest driver of business overall, so we’re very much a multi-channel retailer.” 

Having a company with social goals also went a long way in ensuring eZiba’s durability. “Our customers are very aware that not only are they are buying beautiful products at good prices, but when they buy one of these products they’re also having a positive impact on a low-income community,” says Sabot.  “One of the reasons eZiba has been so successful is because it’s offering a positive and potentially quite large social rate of return on investment.” 

Sabot says the future is bright for other companies with social aims. “I believe that as the buying public becomes more sophisticated, social responsibility will increase profitability because the public will vote with its dollars for products they view as socially responsible. So in terms of generating demand and a marketing message, I think being socially responsible as we move ahead is going to be a big plus.”

'''Advertising and promotions'''&lt;br&gt; 
It’s very simple: for people to buy your product, they have to know it exists. There are a number of ways to go about getting the word out, but most of them can be classified either as an advertising strategy or promotional technique. 

Advertising is bringing a product to the attention of potential and current customers. This is typically done through signs, brochures, commercials, direct mailings or e-mail messages, personal contact, etc. 

Promotions keep the product in the customer’s mind and help stimulate demand for the product. This involves publicity (free mention in the press), rewards programs, community involvement and public relations. 
 
'''Marketing on the cheap'''&lt;br&gt; 
In all likelihood you won’t have a huge marketing budget right at the start. So here’s a list of things you can do to sell your product without breaking the bank. 

'''Your website''' is the easiest and most widely accessed form of marketing. It’s where people come to find out who you are, what you’re about, and what you sell. Websites can range from extremely cheap to very expensive; all you need, though, is a clear, clean, professional site that gets across the right message. 

'''Fliers and brochures''' are not only affordable, they offer you more budget flexibility and greater selectivity in choosing prospects than most other kinds of advertising. Make sure the flier or brochure starts with straightforward, no-nonsense copy. Be specific and accurate. A clever, catchy phrase can help customers remember your business, but a clumsy slogan will deter them quickly. 

'''Direct marketing''' is a cost-effective way to attract customers. It involves sending hand-picked individuals mail containing, for example, a brochure and letter. 

'''Business cards''' are one of the most effective (and cheapest) ways of promoting your business. It tells customers a great deal. You are only limited by your imagination when it comes to creating business cards: more and more businesses are straying from the traditional small rectangle-style card and are shooting instead for something a little more individual.  

'''Testimonials''' from satisfied customers show how you can do a better job than your competitor. Testimonials are powerful. Show the person’s photo if you can. Use the most important sentence or phrase (i.e., the one most flattering to your business), plus the customer’s name. Use multiple testimonials if you can. 

'''Trade shows and conferences''' are great places to make contacts and advertise your product—that’s what they’re all about. Keep in mind, your first foray into a trade show is your introduction to the business community. During the show, project a professional image and demeanor. And remember, while you’re there to sell your invention, trade shows are essentially about making human connections. Ask questions, collect quality information, and find out as much as possible about your prospects. 

'''Networking''' is a powerful and indispensable tool for marketing your business. In fact, it’s so essential we dedicated a separate chapter to it. See “Networking” (3.5). 

'''Word-of-mouth''' is an extremely important promotional tool. Customers talking about you with friends, family, and acquaintances have much more influence and credibility than any other kind of advertisement.  

Bad word-of-mouth travels at least four times faster than good word-of-mouth, so make sure your customer service is spot-on right from the start. Many small businesses have survived without a huge advertising budget due to good word-of-mouth. 

'''Promotional teasers''' such as freebies or give-aways are a great way to catch the attention of a potential customer. Use this tool to attract customers through coupons, vouchers, frequency rewards, competitions, and samples. 

'''Set clear goals and objectives'''&lt;br&gt; 
No matter which of the above tactics you use, make sure you set goals and expectations for what you want to accomplish before you get started. For example, do you want to drive qualified traffic to your site, increase sales by 5%, sign up X-number of new customers, or just generate awareness? You can think big, but with a small budget you have to be realistic. Setting goals from the onset will help you determine what and how much you need to do.

'''Get out of the cave'''&lt;br&gt; 
Networking expert Ivan Misner on how to spark good word-of-mouth buzz surrounding your business:  

“I believe that most business professionals are cave dwellers. They get up each morning in a large cave with a big-screen TV called their home. They go out to their garage and get into a little cave with four wheels called their car. They go to another cave with plenty of computers called their office. At the end of the day, they get back into their little cave with four wheels and drive back to the large cave with the big-screen TV, and they can’t figure out why no one is referring them. If you want to build your business through word-of-mouth, you have to be visible and active in the community by participating in various networking groups and/or professional associations.&quot;
 
From “Word of Mouth: The World’s Best-Known Marketing Secret”  
 

'''Visit customers where they live'''&lt;br&gt; 
Advertising doesn’t have to cost a fortune. Ad expert Roy H. Williams talks about the strategies of a few of his clients:
 
“I have a young mechanic friend who specializes in older model BMW automobiles. In his glove box are several dozen five-by-seven flyers that say “I specialize in fixing BMWs just like this one. Is it running like it should?” Whenever work is slow, he drives through big parking lots where there are hundreds of cars and looks for older BMWs. When he finds one, he slips the flier under the windshield wiper after scribbling a personalized note to the owner, such as “Arctic blue has always been my favorite color on this model. You should be proud of it.” He usually gets calls on his cell phone while he’s still out distributing fliers. Another friend specializes in replacing old picture windows with fancy bay windows. Guess where he puts his fliers? You guessed it: on the front doors of old houses with big picture windows. Works like a charm.” 


'''Give it away'''&lt;br&gt; 
Williams continues: 

“A few years ago, I began working with a client in the frozen custard business who said he’d be happy to invest $10,000 in advertising if he were guaranteed 500 new customers. When I pointed out that this was twenty dollars per new customer, he reminded me that anytime a new customer tried his product, they were usually hooked for life and he would soon make back his investment. It was the middle of winter, and his two custard stands had no inside dining. I told him to prepare all the custard mix he could use if he kept his machines running nonstop from nine a.m. until midnight and to get a good night’s sleep. The next day, I began airing a sixty-second radio ad twice every hour on a midsized station in his town. I offered a free, full-sized cone to everyone in town—all they had to do was get there before midnight. We gave away more than 11,000 cones that day at a total cost of $1,900 for custard mix and $1,200 for advertising. His business literally exploded after that, and now he’s franchising nationally.”

'''It’s time for a reality check'''&lt;br&gt; 
Once you’ve identified your market, figured out the range of possible customers you might pursue, how to reach them and how to sell to them, it’s time to find out if your plans match up with reality. As we’ve already discussed, you can discover this, at least to a certain extent, via market research. Consider hiring a market research expert to help you through this important validation phase. Or get someone with market research experience to serve as a mentor or adviser to your team. 
 
'''Establishing market size'''&lt;br&gt; 
If you’re counting on venture capitalists to finance your business, be aware that some potential funders won’t be interested until you reach a certain market scale. Sometimes the total market is impossible to guess (IBM first predicted it would sell about two computers), but once again good market research will help you get a realistic idea of the actual size of the market you’re hoping to reach. 

According to marketing expert Jeff Dobkin, you can’t establish the market size simply by quoting the total revenue of the industry. “To me,” says Dobkin, “establishing market size isn’t the amount of money spent. For example, to say the motorcycle industry is a four billion dollar industry doesn’t tell me very much. This figure is meaningless to small businesses—and it’s especially harmful to say, ‘This market does four billion a year, if we can just get a 1% share…’ As far as I know, no effective marketing plan correctly takes the industry figure and figures a percentage of what they will receive in revenue. When I look at a market I need to know how easy or difficult it is to introduce a product or service to that industry. I need to see how entrenched the competition is, what the entrance barriers are, etc.”&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; 
 
'''Market research on the cheap'''&lt;br&gt; 
Dobkin reveals an inexpensive way to effectively gauge market size: visit your local library. “When trying to figure out market size,” says Dobkin, “the first place I check is the magazine directories such as Bacon’s Magazine Directory, Burrelle’s Media Directory, Oxbridge Communications Directory of Periodicals, and SRDS Magazine Media Source, to name a few. You can find out in a few minutes just how many different magazines serve this market. The number of magazines is a good indication of market size. Remember, the advertising revenue supports the magazines and the industry buyers support the advertisers.” 

“Note how expensive the ad space is in the magazines. A good way to see the comparative figures for magazines is to look in Oxbridge Communications Magazine Directory—they give you a CPM or Cost Per Thousand for each magazine. This shows you the cost to reach a thousand people with a full-page black and white ad in that magazine. It makes comparing magazine advertising costs much easier. Hmm…thanks, Oxbridge!”  
 
“Next check the circulation of each magazine: how large is their circulation? This is probably the single best method of assessing market size. There will be some pretty consistent figures showing how many copies are distributed to industry personnel. If you really want to see just where all those magazines are being sent, call the publisher and ask for a ‘media kit.’ This free package is how the publishers themselves market their own magazines to advertisers. In the package will be a copy of an independent audit showing who qualifies to receive the magazine, how they are qualified, and shows the circulation breakdown of exactly where all the copies are sent.”&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 
 
'''What does it cost you to get a customer?'''&lt;br&gt; 
Knowing precisely how much it costs you to get a customer in comparison to how much you expect that customer to spend is crucial to your company’s survival. If you spend $40 to get a customer who goes on to spend $15, you’re in trouble. How, then, can you know with certainty how much your customers spend? And how much, therefore, you should spend to get them? As usual, market research. 

Tom Bergman, an associate professor of management at the University of Central Oklahoma, suggests: “What you need to know is how many [repeat customers] you have among all the anonymous customers who bought from you in the past twelve months. Here is how you can find out: ask them. No, you do not have to ask all of your customers. You can ask just a few, and you get a surprisingly good idea of the makeup of your customer base. You can ask as many questions as you like, but I suggest that you ask at least the following two: 
  
* During the past year, approximately how many purchases have you or any members of your family made from this company? 
* On average, what did you spend on each purchase you or your family members made from this company? 
   
When you have this information about customer behavior, you can develop a promotional plan that recognizes these limits. Every promotional tactic you adopt that is designed to bring in new customers ought to be analyzed carefully to determine what that tactic will cost you for each new customer it brought in.”&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;

'''Refining dot.com metrics'''&lt;br&gt; 
During the initial stages of irrational exuberance about the dot.com phenomenon, number of “clicks” changed to attracting “eyeballs,” which changed to “page view.” Many investors got caught up in the false metrics. Those who survived the NASDAQ crash of 2000-01 understood that dot.com survivors would be the ones who executed transactions. Number of customers, amount of the transaction and repeat transactions became the recognized standards. 

From New Venture Creation, 2004, by Timmons and Spinelli, page 91. 

'''Counting customers'''&lt;br&gt; 
Sometimes the market may be plenty deep, but not broad enough. Researchers at Hampshire College in Massachusetts developed a corn oiler to protect corn against destructive pests without the use of harmful pesticides. Preliminary market research indicated that New England farmers were willing to pay about $1000 for such a device. $1000 was an adequate selling price to make production of the corn oiler profitable for the manufacturers. The problem came in the breadth of the market: New England doesn’t have an infinite number of organic corn farmers. Once every organic corn farmer in the region bought the corn oiler, sales would screech to a halt. 

'''Tapping a new market'''&lt;br&gt; 
Here’s the story of how a small, niche market, high-tech company made it big by identifying market needs and molding the product around them. 

The company is Silver Lake Research, a fifteen-person biotech firm based in Monrovia, California. They developed Watersafe, an at-home tap water testing kit sold in 3,000 retail stores nationwide. The science behind the product was brand new, but even more revolutionary than the product itself was how the company took a specialty store product and transformed it into a lowest-common-denominator supermarket product.  

The technical challenges that Silver Lake had to tackle to bring about the identity shift bordered on the existential. For starters, US geography dictates that a mass-market product be multi-functional. “A person in Manhattan might worry about lead in their water, while a person in Omaha worries about agricultural pesticides,” explains Tom Round, Silver Lake’s vice-president. “We designed our product so it would have equal appeal in urban and rural areas.” At the same time, Watersafe had to be fast-acting, because consumers demand quick results. It had to be compact enough to fit in the tight shelf space reserved for impulse buys at the supermarket. And it had to be simple and easy to use. 

Watersafe met all those requirements. It can detect seven types of contaminants, from chlorine to traces of bacteria like E. coli. Yet the box it comes in is unintimidatingly small—about the size of a DVD. All the tests can be conducted in ten minutes, and all render their results in an obvious, color-coded way reminiscent of a standard at-home pregnancy test. 

Silver Lake plans to take advantage of the growing mainstream acceptance of what was once a niche trend: consumer interest in the purity of consumables.

      <comment>/* The Competition */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''The Competition''' ==
 
Competition is a good thing. It forces you to perform at a high level, and sometimes it can even legitimize your product or technology, like when IBM entered the PC market and made computers specifically for individual use. But you still want to beat the competition, and that becomes much easier when your product is significantly better along an important performance characteristic—and you can demonstrate it—or if you can solve a problem that the competition cannot. When you’re clearly the best, you make it harder for the naysayers not to choose you, and easier for supporters to promote your product. The challenge is to be clearly the best. 
 
'''Who are your competitors?'''&lt;br&gt; 
For some types of products, this question is relatively easy to answer. Maybe you’re planning to do what someone else is already doing, but you’re going to do it better. In some cases, however, it can be harder to name the competition, or to figure out what, specifically, will differentiate your business. 
 
'''The danger of complacency'''&lt;br&gt; 
Never believe that you have no competitors. Even if your product is one of a kind, you have competition. Your competition (not to be taken lightly) is the status quo, or the belief that your product is not especially necessary to people’s lives. 

'''Keeping tabs on the competition: Lessons from a retail giant'''&lt;br&gt; 
Tom Stemberg, founder of office supply superstore Staples, made weekly, unannounced visits to his own stores, competitors’ stores, and others to get ideas of ways to improve what Staples does. Some of the lessons can be transferred to any new product or venture. 

Says Stemberg: “I’ve never visited a store where I didn’t learn something.” When Stemberg visited a store, he looked for what the store was doing right. “You’ve got to see what they do better and learn from them. You must never take your competition for granted, because that can come back and hurt you.” In 1987, Office Depot was for sale. After visiting numerous stores, two Staples representatives declared that the business was on its way out and not worth buying. “Well,” Stemberg says, “Office Depot went on to become the biggest company in the industry, and we were still playing catch-up with them ten years later.” 
 
'''Seeing through a customer’s eyes'''&lt;br&gt; 
When visiting a store, Stemberg says, “You try to see exactly what the customer sees. I carried a little pad and I wrote notes. Then I e-mailed them around to our management team.” 

'''Know the competition, focus on the consumer'''&lt;br&gt; 
Stemberg maintains that you have to pay attention to the competition’s successes without forgetting that it’s the customer you’re aiming to please. “One of my great fears always was that our people would try to rationalize why we did things better, smarter, whatever, and stop the learning experience. One of the things you can do is lose sight of the customer. Lots of times I find companies overly focused on one another and ignoring what the customer wants, and therefore losing the market to some new entrant who truly focuses on the customer. Barnes &amp; Noble spent all its time looking at Borders and Borders spent all its time looking at Barnes and Noble, when both of them should have paid attention to Amazon.com.” 
 
'''Some ethical guidelines'''&lt;br&gt; 
When you’re sizing up the competition, act with integrity. It might be tempting to get a leg up by doing something unethical, but the truth will come out sooner or later. Fuld &amp; Company offers the following Ten Commandments of Legal and Ethical Intelligence Gathering. 
 
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thou shalt not lie when representing thyself.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;li&gt;Thou shalt observe thy company’s legal guidelines as set forth by the legal department.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;li&gt;Thou shalt not tape record a conversation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thou shalt not bribe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thou shalt not plant eavesdropping devices.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;li&gt;Thou shalt not deliberately mislead anyone into an interview.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;li&gt;Thou shalt neither obtain from nor give price information to thy competitor.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;li&gt;Thou shalt not swap misinformation.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;li&gt;Thou shalt not steal a trade secret (or steal employees away in hopes of learning a trade secret).&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;li&gt;Thou shalt not knowingly press someone for information if it may jeopardize that person’s job or reputation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt; 
   
Hopefully most of these “thou shalt nots” are far from your consideration. If you have any legal or ethical questions about your methods of gathering competitive intelligence, however, consult with your lawyer.

'''Know thy competition'''&lt;br&gt; 
First, Direct Competitors&lt;br&gt; 
Check the Yellow Pages or call the Chamber of Commerce to uncover local competition. Visit a library and try Gale Research’s Encyclopedia of Associations, Ulrich’s Guide to International Periodicals, and the Thomas Register of Manufacturers guides that can put you in touch with professionals in related industries. 

Indirect Competition&lt;br&gt; 
Find the businesses with missions unrelated to yours that are competing for the dollars you want. Find out what else your potential customers spend their money on, and learn how you can woo them to spend it on your product. 


'''More Resources'''&lt;br&gt;
* Business publications, directories and databases at the library 
* Back issues of community newspapers—competitor ads, employment ads, executives’ participation in community associations 
* Annual reports 
* Online databases 
* The competitors themselves  
    

'''Competitive intelligence'''&lt;br&gt; 
Gathering information on the competition is not about spying or stealing secrets. Rather, it’s about carefully analyzing and learning from what the competition is doing. 

In its Competitive Intelligence Guide, Fuld &amp; Company states that “wherever money is exchanged, so is information.” Any company that deals with the outside world “inadvertently throws down informational bridges over the moat, allowing outsiders to peek into its operations…The world’s mightiest multinationals hire and fire, open facilities, deal with suppliers, negotiate with national, state and local governments, attend scientific conferences and present papers.” Electronic databases, CD-roms and other new information vehicles give everyone virtually equal access to corporate intelligence. 

Some guidelines:
    
* You must find information; it does not find you. You can’t wait until the last minute to seek out the information you need. 
* Intelligence is constant. You must track your competition constantly, otherwise you may misinterpret what you find. 
* Competitive assessment is a 3-D picture. Just as competitors change, so does their competitive environment.

'''Needs and competition'''&lt;br&gt; 
Phyl Speser of Foresight Science &amp; Technology agrees that there are always competitors out there. “If there is a need, the odds are people are doing something to meet it already. There is always a competing technology or product or way. It may just be hand labor—hiring immigrants as an alternative to mechanized picking.  

The point is, if there is no need, there is no market and the product doesn’t stand a chance. If there is a need, people are usually try to address it, and you just have to hope they are doing so poorly. Then people are open to change.

      <comment>/* Cleaning up: Sun &amp; Earth */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Cleaning up: Sun &amp; Earth''' ==
 
Art Rogers is trying to make the supermarket cleaning aisle a little cleaner. According to Rogers, most of the household products we use contain “elements that you would not want to have in your personal environment or the environment in general.” After assuming the CEO position at Sun &amp; Earth, a natural cleaning products company, his objective was to convince retailers to move the company’s detergents and spray bottles out of the organic section and into the cleaning aisle.  

To do this, Rogers tailored his pitch to his audience, and didn’t try to stand on a soapbox (no pun intended). “The product worked,” said Rogers, “and I sold it to retailers based on that. The other things are in the background. Most consumers are concerned only with products that work.”  

He admits that people are skeptical about Sun &amp; Earth products’ performance because environmentally friendly cleaners introduced in the 1980s didn’t work very well and were more expensive. Sun &amp; Earth is different: all products are 3-5% better to 97% as good as the name brands on the market, and cost only 10% more.  

Sun &amp; Earth began in a Pennsylvania garage where its founders developed cleaners without harmful chemicals as alternatives to existing products. They convinced local stores to carry their products, then bigger stores in New York, Boston, and Washington DC. This strategy allowed them to successfully grab “highly enlightened” consumers who were strongly environmentally and health conscious. As the company grew and was partially acquired by Ben Cohen’s Barred Rock investment fund (his first investment after the sale of Ben &amp; Jerry’s), it strove to gain a wider consumer base.  

Rogers believes that the key to reaching this objective was understanding the “ripple effect.” A pebble thrown into a pond creates a splash—this splash represents core customers who understand the product’s value and currently buy it (the “highly enlightened”). But the pebble also creates ripples. The ripples closest to the splash represent customers who are predisposed to buy the product (such as those with chemical sensitivities in the case of Sun &amp; Earth). The further the ripple from the splash, the further the customer group is from understanding and relating to the product’s message. 

Sun &amp; Earth tries to reach the ripples closest to the splash and continue moving out to spread its message. While grocery store coupons and promotions yield higher sales, they do not necessarily create repeat customers because they entice bargain hunters rather than groups that identify with the Sun &amp; Earth’s values. Rogers tries to focus on marketing at events, like Race for the Cure, a breast cancer research fundraiser, that draw people who are more likely to be health conscious or environmentally concerned.  

Although his objective is to mainstream Sun &amp; Earth’s products, the company itself is anything but mainstream. Their sense of social good extends far beyond the ingredients in their products. Located in a transformed argyle sock factory, the company employs workers from the surrounding low-income community and promotes community building through volunteer projects. Consistent with the company’s environmental focus, its plant is the first in Pennsylvania to be run completely on wind power. 

Rogers notes that while 99.8% of for-profit companies measure themselves with one P (profit) Sun &amp; Earth uses 3 P’s: profit, people, planet. His investors, all social venture funds, demand returns in each of the three areas. Besides sharing similar values, an advantage of being funded this way is the network that Sun &amp; Earth has built. The company has used its connections to reach important players and gain accounts from companies that are also committed to sustainable and socially responsible business, such as Starbucks.  

With his experience boosting sales at major companies like Saucony and Proctor &amp; Gamble as well as Sun &amp; Earth, Rogers has simple advice for aspiring entrepreneurs. “Make sure your product has a unique selling proposition. And make sure it works.”

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Marketing to the poor: International Development Enterprises (IDE)''' ==

Paul Polak didn’t have to do any of this. At age forty-seven, Polak was a successful Colorado psychiatrist with a wife, three daughters and $3 million in real estate. But in his extensive world travels Polak witnessed more and more the debilitating effects of extreme poverty on the world’s rural poor—who often make less than one dollar a day—and became curious about ways to help. Gradually it became clear to Polak that in order to improve the lives of hundreds of millions of subsistence farmers, there was only one place to start: water.

“You could see how essential water was to alleviating poverty,” says Polak. “If you wanted to do anything, you had to start with these small farmers and irrigation. The power to control water is absolutely crucial to them. That fact should shape all development policy.”

Inspired to help however he could, in 1981 Polak formed International Development Enterprises (IDE), a nonprofit that develops and facilitates the sale of affordable, simple, income-enhancing products to the poor, with a special expertise in water technologies for small-scale irrigation and safe drinking water. Over the years IDE has helped millions of rural farmers in the world’s poorest countries increase their agricultural productivity, providing them with a basis for food security, income generation, integration with markets, and the beginnings of an upward spiral out of poverty.

Needless to say, IDE would be nowhere if they couldn’t sell their products. But how do you sell to the world’s poorest people? How do you design products for them, and then get them to buy them? As with any business, marketing is essential to IDE’s success and at the same time comes fraught with challenges.

The first challenge, according to Polak, is molding IDE’s products around customer need—that is, making them so cheap that the world’s poorest people can afford them. Says Polak, “We focus on people who make less than one dollar a day. If things aren’t extremely cheap, they can’t afford them. Affordability is the key issue; it’s the absolute bottom line. In just about every product we sell to the poor there seems to be a threshold point of about one-fifth the conventional price; when we reach that threshold, sales take off.”

To reach that threshold, IDE develops products that can be made inexpensively by using locally available materials. An example is the IDE treadle pump, two million of which have been installed worldwide since its introduction in 1985. The pump consists of two metal cylinders with pistons operated by a natural walking motion on two treadles, like a stairmaster; the individual walks up and down on the treadles and in the process brings water up to the surface. The pump is manufactured locally in simple metalworking shops, and the treadles and support structure are made of bamboo or other inexpensive, locally available material. The unit sells for $25-50, and enables farmers to generate more than $100 a year in extra income.

A second challenge has to do with the attitudes and inclinations of the poor themselves. Many poor people aren’t willing to cough up what is to them a large sum of money for devices they’re not sure will work. Says Polak, “We feel that the best way for poor farmers to prosper is by growing labor-intensive, high-cash crops. But if the farmers grow rice like they usually do, they’ll have enough to eat; they’re averse to risk because they want to avoid going hungry. Poor farmers are very risk averse. So we have to lower the risk—find ways to show them that moving to a high-income crop is a good thing.”

IDE goes about this in a variety of ways. “First, we don’t ask them to give up rice and move straight to high-value crops right away. We start off by helping them improve their yield on staple crops through procedures like the use of urea granules planted in the ground between rice plants, which give them bigger yields and cost less than fertilizer because they don’t wash away. Once they’ve seen that we can help them grow enough rice to feed their family, they’re much more open to growing higher-value crops.”

Another IDE risk-mitigation strategy involves the marketplace itself. Because a poor farmer can never predict the market price of any crop she grows, IDE doesn’t promote just one high-value crop, instead promoting packages of four or five. “That way,” says Polak, “even though you can’t predict the final value at market, farmers can play the odds. Maybe on one crop they’ll make out like bandits, three will do OK, and one they’ll feed to the pigs.”

And what about getting the word out? How do you make poor rural farmers aware of your product? When it comes to promotional techniques and advertising, IDE takes the only route available to them: they get out in the village streets and push the product. “Let’s say that we want to sell treadle pumps,” says Polak. “We’ll put on a demonstration in a village fair that draws a lot of people. We’ll have a three-rickshaw procession: I’ll be on the first rickshaw, and I’ll have a microphone and will shout, ‘Come see this demonstration!’ The second rickshaw will have someone demonstrating how to work a treadle pump, and a third rickshaw has somebody handing out leaflets.”

“In Bangladesh we sometimes use a troubadour group. It’s a little three-person orchestra that plays a song about a treadle pump. And also in Bangladesh, because there’s a very big market there, we made a ninety-minute movie with the treadle pump as the main part of the story. We played that movie to an audience of over one million in a year.”

Indeed, numbers in the millions frequently come up when talking about Polak and IDE. IDE’s efforts around the world are estimated to create more than $200 million of additional income each year for the rural poor, and the number of lives touched reaches the tens of millions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Teams Make It Happen''' ==
 
'''First, some context'''&lt;br&gt; 
Let’s start by explaining why we think teamwork is essential—especially when it comes to technology entrepreneurship. It has to do with adopting what works in the corporate world, all with the notion of preparing you to do as well as possible. 
 
Within the last ten to fifteen years, teamwork has become an omnipresent phenomenon in corporate America. Companies have transitioned to teamwork as a vehicle to increase effectiveness, competitiveness, and productivity (read: working in teams improves performance). The Center for the Study of Work Teams reports that in the year 2000, 80% of all Fortune 500 companies are expected to have fully half of their employees working in teams.
 
This increased need for employees to function in teams has forced engineering colleges and universities to change the way they teach. In a study conducted by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), teamwork was ranked as the single most important skill for undergraduate engineering students. Schools now need to provide their graduates not only with intellectual development and superb technical capabilities, but also the ability to work as part of teams, communicate well, and understand the economic, social, environmental and international context of their professional activity.1Promoting and developing teamwork is a big reason why the NCIIA exists; whether you start a company or go work for one, it’s important for you to get experience working in teams.  
 
'''Where it all starts'''&lt;br&gt; 
Your team is the lifeblood of your venture. The strength of your team determines how thoroughly you analyze the problem, how many different angles you see, and how complete and competent your solution will be. As a student, you may not have a lot of background in building teams; college tends to be a solo experience. While some of your professors may have given you group assignments, you may still feel like a team-building beginner. With student entrepreneurial projects, determining who’s responsible for can be a big challenge. Sit down early with your team make sure everyone is fairly clear about her or his role(s). 
 
'''Be strong. Be diverse.'''&lt;br&gt; 
An excellent team is diverse. If you’re an idea person with an eye on the big picture, fill out your team with detail-oriented people. If you’re an expert on the technical aspects of your idea, find teammates with business experience. If you know a lot about the business end, but aren’t sure how machines work, look for teammates with technical training. A creative guru, a numbers-cruncher, a people-person with loads of natural charm…all of these personalities add strength and dimension to your team, and enhance your chances for success. And working with people who are different from you, in terms of gender, race, ethnicity, background and personal traits, will broaden your scope and help your team prepare for the real world. 
 
'''Starting solo'''&lt;br&gt;
Are you a team of one? Your situation may not be ideal, but it may also not be impossible. Maybe the nature of your project lends itself better to working alone in the initial planning and production stages. Just don’t limit yourself. Build a network of mentors and advisors, keeping in mind the skills and knowledge that they, and possibly future team members, might bring to your new venture. Get to know faculty members who might be interested in your work. Contact your college’s innovation incubator, technology development office, or entrepreneurship club. Reach out beyond your college and find out who else is working on the same type of project as you. Beat the streets for people whose interests are similar, or complementary, to yours. 
 
'''Leadership'''&lt;br&gt; 
Your team may come together in a very democratic way, and for some teams relationships necessitate keeping that democratic feeling intact. But leadership is also critical—someone has to make sure that the team keeps its momentum going and that the work stays on track. Figure out whether you’re the best person for that role, or whether someone else needs to take charge. 
 
'''Clarify your purpose'''&lt;br&gt; 
Know why you’re creating a team and begin with a vision of how you want the team to work. Jon Katzenberg, Senior Partner in Katzenberg Partners, LCC says, “Teams work when they are created for the right reasons, and when they are created in the right way…The critical decision for any manager or leader who wants to get higher performance from a small group of people is determining whether the group should try to work as a team, or whether they should be satisfied with what I call ‘single-leader unit’ discipline…Most organizations proliferate with groups that call themselves teams but aren’t…it’s disturbing how many managers and leaders assume that being a team is what a group effort is all about. If a group tries to become a team when the performance challenge requires a single-leader approach, performance and morale suffer. The opposite is equally true.”

'''On diverse teams'''&lt;br&gt; 
“Divergent thinking is an essential ingredient of creativity. Diverse groups produce diverse thinking. Ergo, diversity promotes creativity. This logic applies to corporations, research teams, think tanks, and other groups of creators. Those who rely on diverse people are more likely to innovate than those who rely on platoons of similar people.” 

From “Mighty is the Mongrel,” by Gregg Pascal Zachary. ''Fast Company'', July 2000.
 

“If I could solve all the problems myself, I would.”&lt;br&gt;  
&amp;mdash;Thomas Edison, on why he had twenty-one assistants 

“Ideally, your team should have seven to nine people. If you have more than fifteen or twenty, you’re dead: the connections are too hard to make.”&lt;br&gt;  
&amp;mdash;Ray Oglethorpe, President, AOL Technologies 

From “What Makes Teams Work,” by Regina Fazio, Maruca, ''Fast Company'', November 2000.
 

'''The myth of the lone ranger'''&lt;br&gt; 
“Great groups have shaped our world, from the gathering of young geniuses at Los Alamos who unleashed the atom to the youthful scientists and hackers who invented a computer that was personal as well as powerful. That should hardly surprise us. In a society as complex and technologically sophisticated as ours, the most urgent projects require the coordinated contributions of many talented people. Whether the task is building a global business or discovering the mysteries of the human brain, one person can’t hope to accomplish it, however gifted or energetic he or she may be. And yet, even as we make the case for collaboration, we resist the idea of collective creativity. Our mythology refuses to catch up with our reality. And so we cling to the myth of the Lone Ranger, the romantic idea that great things are usually accomplished by a larger-than-life individual working alone… 

We must turn to great groups if we hope to begin to understand how that rarest of precious resources—genius—can be successfully combined with great effort to achieve results that enhance all our lives. It is in such groups that we may also discover why some organizations seem to breed greatness, freeing members to be better than anyone imagined they could be.” 

From “The Secrets of Creative Collaboration,” by Warren Bennis and Patricia Ward Biederman, ''Inc. Magazine'', December 1, 1996. 



'''Be real'''&lt;br&gt; 
Find at least one ally who is also a helpful critic—someone who will react honestly to your work and give you realistic, constructive advice. The last thing you want is to pour huge amounts of time, money, and passion into an idea with flaws that are obvious to everyone in the world but you.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''The Layers of a Team''' ==
 
Teams, though they may not be hierarchical in structure, have a natural layering of levels of involvement among their various players. You can think of a team as a series of concentric circles, with the most central players at the core, and those with more fleeting or peripheral involvement in the outer layers. As needs and roles shift through the life of a venture, so do individuals’ location in the concentric layers of the team. 
 
'''The core: you and other major stakeholders'''&lt;br&gt; 
The core of the team might consist of you alone, or you and several other people who have been central to the project from its outset. You are the ones with the most at stake. You’ve invested a lot in this venture, and your investment is not necessarily financial. In fact, you’re more likely earning sweat equity: the energy and hours you invest in a venture that give you a personal stake in its success. You are the ones who care most whether or not this venture succeeds. 
 
'''The outer layers'''&lt;br&gt; 
These are the people who have less of a stake in the project’s success but will contribute to make it work. They might include advisors, mentors, and people who will perform concrete tasks for you along the way without taking a central role in the planning. As your project progresses, you may want to draw some of the more peripheral people closer to the project’s core. It may become more important for them to be stakeholders and to benefit directly from the project’s success. Likewise, some of the original stakeholders may draw away from the project’s core, and take more peripheral roles. A team is dynamic, constantly in flux. 
 
'''Defining roles'''&lt;br&gt; 
To be effective, team members need clear roles and responsibilities. It is important to hash out the details of what needs to be done and who is responsible for each task. Early in your team’s formation, discuss how individual team members’ talents will best be put to use and the kinds of people you want to bring in to fill leadership roles. This discussion is an important part of clarifying your shared organizational vision. 
Here are a few typical roles in a company, briefly defined.1 (See section 5, The Company, for a more detailed discussion of company structures.) 

The Board of Directors is a group elected by a company’s shareholders to oversee management of the corporation. Directors may work voluntarily, or they may be paid in cash and/or stock. They assume legal responsibility for the corporation. 

The Board of Advisors is a less formal working alternative to a board of directors, often used by smaller companies that want to bring in senior people but aren’t yet ready to ask them for a commitment. The board of advisors usually has 3-7 members and meets periodically, but doesn’t have legal responsibility for the company. Legally, a board of directors is still required. 

The CEO (Chief Executive Officer) is the highest level executive, other than the board Chair. Typically, a company brings in a CEO after it has achieved financing or some other level of success. At this point, the CEO lends experience to the management team, and helps provide broad strategic direction. 

The President runs the company day-to-day, and understands both the details and the big picture. The President is often the company’s founder, and sometimes also serves as the CEO, particularly in smaller companies. 

The VP Sales and the VP Marketing fill critical roles in any company, but particularly in early stage companies. Well-connected people dedicated to sales and marketing make all the difference, especially if they can influence the product people. 

The CFO (Chief Financial Officer) is responsible for the company’s financial planning and record-keeping. Many CFOs supervise people like the controller and bookkeeper, and set the company’s strategic financial direction. 

The COO (Chief Operating Officer) is responsible for the day-to-day management of a company. 

The CTO (Chief Technical Officer), in a technology company, is usually a founder, in charge of the core product. The CTO and COO develop the company’s product offering. 
 
'''Whose company is this, anyway?'''&lt;br&gt; 
It’s never too early to begin talking about ownership. The issue of who owns the venture and how much of it each person owns can lead you to disastrous conflict when things change (e.g., someone leaves the company). Work together to devise a model of ownership that everyone is comfortable with. 

You can choose from several possible models, including vested ownership, where people gain a certain percentage of financial interest with each passing year, and milestone-driven ownership, where milestones in the company’s development dictate who owns what percentage of the company’s shares. When you devise your ownership plan, allow for changes in the company structure. Set up a system for treatment of new people at different levels. When you bring someone new on board, will she have ownership? How will you transfer shares from one person to another, should the need arise?

'''Tapping talent'''&lt;br&gt; 
British Design firm Imagination Ltd. has a unique approach to teamwork. In their company, representatives from all twenty-six catalogued disciplines meet weekly. All of the firm’s employees are invited to these meetings, where they raise new ideas, look at problems, and assess progress. Production people and client-contact people are considered as much a part of the planning team as the creative-type people. In such an egalitarian environment, disbursement of power means equal disbursement of responsibility. 

From “Total Teamwork—Imagination, Ltd.” by Charles Fishman. Fast Company, April 2000. 


'''On setting norms'''&lt;br&gt; 
“What are the norms of a team? It includes everything from how do we select a leader or do we need a formal leader? Is the leader better, equal, less than the rest of us? What are the roles of respective team members? Effective teams talk about setting up norms and how we as a team will maximize contributions of individual members…They also develop norms about how to deal with conflict.”
 
&amp;mdash;Joseph Weintraub, Professor, Babson College and President, Organizational Dimensions 


'''The importance of mentoring'''&lt;br&gt; 
The people in the outer layer of your team can go a long way in helping your venture succeed. Experienced mentors have been there before. A good mentor uses that experience to guide you away from pitfalls, help you make crucial decisions, and even show you how best to run your business. Here are some examples of entrepreneurs who were helped along the path to success by good mentors.  
	
Tom Stemberg, founder, chairman, and CEO of Staples, a $5.2 billion chain of office supply superstores 
	 
* Mentor: Harvard Business School professor Walter Salmon 
* Best advice given: “Apply your supermarket efficiency skills in a new business that’s underserved by modern distribution channels.” 
	 
Lynn Frydryk, founder of $1-million-plus J&amp;L Peaberry’s Coffee &amp; Tea Co., in Oakland, Calif. 
     
* Mentor: Alfred Peet, specialty coffee guru 
* How they met: Frydryk worked for Peet at a company he founded, called Peet’s Coffee and Tea. She never solicited him as a mentor. She says he adopted her. 
* How often they meet: Frydryk and Peet used to visit about once a month. Now they meet irregularly. 
* Best advice given: Peet told Frydryk, “Before starting your own business, you really would be wise to make your mistakes on the payroll of someone else’s business. It’s a very sound theory.” 
	 
Steve Leveen, cofounder and president of Levenger, a catalog business in Delray Beach, Fla. 
     
* Mentor: Stanley Marcus, chairman emeritus of Neiman Marcus 
* How they met: Leveen read Marcus’s book, Minding the Store, and wrote him a fan letter. Marcus wrote back. 
* Best advice given: “No sale is a good sale unless it’s a good value for the customer.”

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Building a Healthy Team''' ==
 
'''Embrace those differences'''&lt;br&gt; 
As we’ve mentioned, a healthy team is a diverse team. And in a diverse team, not everyone thinks alike. This is a good thing, and the whole reason for having a diverse team in the first place. You really want the varied points of view brought in by people with different backgrounds and talents. The flip side of this, of course, is that diversity brings its own set of challenges. Don’t expect, or even hope, for your team to work together smoothly all the time. Instead, establish a set of norms for communication and team operations that will equip your team well for managing conflict when it arises. 
 
'''Setting team goals'''&lt;br&gt; 
Early in your team’s formation, discuss the following issues: What is your vision for this project? What are your most important goals? Making a lot of money? Learning new skills? Helping people? Building your résumés? Do any individual goals conflict with team goals? How will you deal with that? 
 
'''Communication practices'''&lt;br&gt; 
In addition, you should decide how (and how often) you’ll interact: 
 
* How often will you hold regularly scheduled meetings? 
* Who will lead the meetings? 
* What will the agenda look like, and how will team members control meeting topics? 
* How will the team make decisions on controversial issues—by consensus, hierarchically, or using some method in-between? 
* What procedures will team members follow for disseminating information from the meetings? 
* Who will get the information?  
   
Be sure that your team has all the people it needs to make decisions and take action quickly once the decisions are made. Ray Oglethorpe, President of AOL Technologies, recommends that teams have “no delegates. You don’t want people who have to take the team’s ideas back to someone else to get authorization. You want the decision makers.”  
 
'''Healthy relationships'''&lt;br&gt; 
A team can only function in an atmosphere of trust and respect. Build it from the start, by working toward common ground and a shared vision. Look for honest and enthusiastic people who are assertive, yet humble—people with both a sense of humor and a driving work ethic. Balance Type A and Type B personalities—people who want to get the job done, and people who value the process. 
 
'''When conflict erupts'''&lt;br&gt; 
What will you do when team members start to have problems with each other? (this is inevitable—it happens to everyone!) Will you talk about it in a group meeting, or talk individually among the people concerned? Will you go so far as to ask someone to leave the group? How will the team decide issues like that? 
 
'''When someone new comes on board'''&lt;br&gt; 
You’ve balanced work styles and communication styles to perfection, and everyone is getting along fabulously, and moving the project ahead. Then the team realizes that it needs someone new with a particular skill set. How will team members cope with this shift in the balance? Will you be taken off guard when everything changes in your perfect world? 

Tony DiCicco, coach of the gold medal-winning US Women’s Olympic Soccer Team says, “The natural inclination is to protect what you have and not allow a new star to rise to the top. Team members have to fight against that. The bottom line is that new talent can force everyone to play at a higher level.”
 
And common corporate wisdom dictates that a good leader always hires people who are smarter than herself. 
 
'''Get help'''&lt;br&gt; 
Support is never far away. Human resource units at some schools will facilitate team building workshops. You may also be able to hire an outside team-building facilitator for a minimal cost through a local chamber of commerce. Your college may have a mediation team to assist with conflict resolution. Another alternative is to invite a wise, neutral, mentor-type person with experience in team dynamics to sit in on a meeting and help assess what is going wrong in team communications. 

Every team encounters unexpected conflicts or dysfunction. Catch it and do something about it before it disrupts the achievement of your goals.

'''Key ingredients for building a successful team'''&lt;br&gt;
* The mission must be clearly defined and articulated, and everyone must understand it. 
* All team members must be positive thinkers. 
* Each team member must have enough self-confidence and self-respect to respect other team members. 
* The team leader must always be on the lookout for distractions, tangents, and unproductive or ancillary issues. 
* Each member must trust the motives of the other members. 
* The team has to be as small as possible.  

&amp;mdash;H. David Aycock, former Chairman of Nucor
 

“If everyone on the team is able to say ‘I can work with this person’ about everyone else on the team, then you’ve got a good thing going. Generally, a good fit starts with shared values…If everyone on the team isn’t clear about the product (whatever it is that you’re trying to create) and the process (how you’re going to get where you need to be, who drives what, who is the ultimate decision maker), then there are going to be people problems.”
 
&amp;mdash;Jonathan Roberts, Managing Director and Partner, Ignition Corp. 

From “What Makes Teams Work? Unit of One,” by Regina Maruca, Fast Company, November 2000. 


'''The stages of team development'''&lt;br&gt; 
The Tuckman Model, created in 1965 by Bob Tuckman, lists the classic four stages of team development: forming, storming, norming, and performing. 
	 
Forming&amp;mdash;Team members are introduced. They state why they’re a part of the team and what they hope to accomplish within it. Members cautiously explore the boundaries of acceptable group behavior. This is a stage of transition from individual to member status, and of testing the leader’s guidance both formally and informally.  

Storming&amp;mdash;Storming is the most difficult stage for the team.  Members begin to have their own ideas as to how the process should look; personal agendas are rampant. They begin to realize the tasks ahead are more difficult than they imagined. Impatient about the lack of progress, members argue about what actions the team should take. They try to rely solely on their personal and professional experience, and resist collaborating with most of the other team members. 

Norming&amp;mdash;Members reconcile competing loyalties and responsibilities and find a focus. Everyone wants to share the newly found focus. Enthusiasm is high, and the team is tempted to go beyond the original scope of the process. They accept the team, team ground rules, their roles in the team, and the individuality of fellow members. Emotional conflict is reduced as previously competitive relationships become cooperative.  

Performing&amp;mdash;The team settles its relationships and expectations. They begin performing by diagnosing, solving problems, and choosing and implementing changes.   

From “Forming, Norming, Storming, Performing,” by Ingrid Bergner.

      <comment>/* Networking */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Networking''' ==
 
Now let’s move on to talk about an activity that’s absolutely central to your team’s commercial success: networking. Networking consists of exchanging information and establishing personal connections. People network in many different settings: on the telephone, in hallways, in company lunchrooms, at professional conferences, at trade shows, company meetings, classrooms, lounges, hallways, elevators, airplanes, trains, buses, hotel lobbies, and waiting rooms. Some networking is carefully planned and some just happens. Networking is friendly, low-key—and essential. 

'''Why network?'''&lt;br&gt; 
You network because it opens doors for you. When you know a lot of people, you can turn to them when you need help with anything and everything related to your venture: hiring new staff, marketing, supplies, getting funding. It’s nearly impossible to succeed in business without a good network. 
 
'''Get out there'''&lt;br&gt; 
The only way to network is to get out there and talk to people. According to networking guru Joan Gillman, a lot of entrepreneurs “get very involved in their businesses and their ideas and don’t get out of their shop. They’re very busy doing what they do well, and I applaud them for that, but they need to get out into the community. Those community contacts through Rotary, through the Elks, through the Chamber of Commerce, through other non-profit organizations, are really important for success in business.” 

You may be wondering, “Where do I start?” It’s OK if you don’t personally know any CEOs, lawyers, or business executives. Chances are someone close to you does, or perhaps someone close to someone close to you. “Every person has a network they can hook into,” says Gillman. “We’re all born with networks, a set of contacts.” She recommends first delving into your F &amp; R (Friends and Relatives) network to connect with people who can help you.
 
Opportunities to network exist outside of friends and family as well. Your college or university keeps detailed alumni information. Feel free to get in touch with these invaluable contacts by writing letters and making telephone calls. Many alumni are more than happy to help out students of their alma mater. Also, seek out trade organizations and conventions that link people in your field of interest. Your competitors are likely to participate in these associations; by networking with them, you can gain priceless information. 
 
'''Sell yourself'''&lt;br&gt;  
Every time you meet a new person, you are essentially pitching yourself. If you are shy or intimidated by meeting strangers, ask an extraverted friend to help introduce you to others until you gain more confidence. The only way to overcome introversion is through practice. Exercise your networking skills by engaging strangers and starting simple conversations in ordinary places like the park or supermarket.
 
When you are ready to network for business do not underestimate what you have to offer as a new, ambitious entrepreneur. More experienced individuals may even take you under their wing. The closer you are to your mentor, the more that person will want to see you succeed. Your best asset is your freshness; by confidently and sincerely approaching people you will make contacts with ease. 

As a budding entrepreneur, you’re also offering others the unique opportunity to share in your vision at the beginning. Everyone is interested in new and innovative ideas. Even if you’re reaching out to friends and family, talk about your vision with conviction and explain why it’s important. Buzz spreads quickly, and if the people you speak with aren’t interested in becoming involved in your business, perhaps they know people who would be. 
 
'''Keep in touch'''&lt;br&gt; 
As you build up a network, says Gillman, be careful not to overextend yourself. Says Gillman, “You have to be selective. When I go to a meeting, I try to meet two people who are going to be influential and whom I want to stay in contact with. Not fifty, because you can’t manage fifty relationships.” Keep in touch with the contacts you make. Gillman keeps a calendar with birthdays on it. “My most important contacts and I go out for lunch about once a month, once every six weeks. We never leave that lunch without scheduling the next one.” 
 
'''Use your network'''&lt;br&gt;  
Getting help from your network is as easy as making a phone call or writing a letter. All you have to do is ask in order to raise capital, discover opportunities, and connect with people that can help you with your business venture. But don’t forget that networking involves reciprocal relationships to which you are also expected to contribute. Do your part by lending a hand to others where you can—share your contacts, make yourself available for informal meetings or lunches, and always nurture your relationships. “You just never know where your contacts are going to take you,” says Gillman.

'''Mind your manners'''&lt;br&gt; 
The contacts you make while networking might be colleagues, friends of colleagues, relatives, friends or just acquaintances. Regardless, always maintain proper etiquette when interacting with people. If you offend someone, word may travel. Also, remember that your actions reflect on the person who introduces you. Keep that person in mind when dealing with the contacts he or she gives you. Here are some etiquette tips: 
   
* Make eye contact and shake hands with every person you meet 
* Present yourself professionally 
* Send handwritten thank you cards whenever someone helps you in any way 
* Always pay for the meal if you invite someone to lunch or dinner  


'''Networking stories'''&lt;br&gt; 
Networking guru Joan Gillman shares the following personal experiences that reinforce the basic tenets of networking.  

Network to get what you want&lt;br&gt;
When Joan’s daughter wanted to break into Hollywood, she took her mother’s advice and made the rounds at a party asking friends of the family and even strangers if they knew anyone working in film or television. She ended up with a long list of contacts, including her mother’s friend’s brother, who was executive producer of a popular prime time sitcom. 

Befriend the competition&lt;br&gt; 
One of Joan’s clients, a husband and wife team, were worried about a competing business, also ran by a husband and wife team. Joan suggested the concerned couple take the competition out to dinner, their treat. The other couple had such a good time, they shared everything about their business, including their financial position. 

Ask and ye shall receive&lt;br&gt; 
Joan met a young woman at a meeting in Strasbourg, France, who loved her unique dangling cow earrings and asked where she got them. As they were a gift from her daughter, Joan didn’t know what shop they came from. She promised, however, to get the woman the earrings if she promised to remember that you don’t get anything unless you ask for it. After looking in eighteen different jewelry stores, Joan finally found the cow earrings, and sent them to the young woman.

      <comment>/* Incubators */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Incubators''' ==
 
'''Think chickens'''&lt;br&gt; 
A good way to get to the heart of what incubators are and what they do is to tease out the metaphor behind the word “incubator.” Incubators are self-contained environments that regulate the lives of chicks so they only need worry about eating and growing. Business incubators are exactly the same: they provide fledgling ventures with office space, basic equipment, access to various professionals (accountants, lawyers, marketing experts, mentors), and in some cases seed money so the businesses can focus on getting the venture off the ground. 

Why bother incubating? Why can’t young businesses just go at it alone, like they used to (and for the most part, in fact, still do)? The answer has three parts. 

'''Making the local scene vibrant''' Stimulating the local economy is a prime reason for the existence of most incubators. These programs want to produce mature, successful businesses&amp;mdash;“graduates” of the program&amp;mdash;that will go on to create jobs and offer products and services that enhance the local economy. 

'''The “new” economy''' The world is changing in terms of how business is conducted. In the past, traditional economic transactions consisted of an exchange of money for goods, materials, or services, but more and more often the important economic transactions of today involve knowledge. Incubators—particularly technology business incubators—facilitate these academic, government and business collaborations that produce leading-edge, next-generation systems and in the process get a leg-up in a hypercompetitive, knowledge-based marketplace. 

'''High-tech help''' While there has been a rapid and spontaneous burgeoning of technology-based start-up companies in recent years, quite a few of the entrepreneurs behind them have negligible experience in managing and growing a small enterprise. Assisting emerging high-tech entrepreneurs with this process is a fundamental motivation driving incubators. 
 
'''What incubators look like'''&lt;br&gt;  
Incubators can be private or public, for-profit or non-profit. They can focus on high-tech, life sciences, manufacturing, service, or niche markets. Some charge a fee for their services, while others require an equity share in the company. A typical incubator, like Baltimore-area InfoAge, has wired space for rent on a monthly or hourly basis, and offers fundamental business support services such as fax/copy machines, networking seminars and forums, voice mail, a mailbox and address, Website space, and conference and multimedia presentation room use. 
 
'''Finding the right match'''&lt;br&gt; 
Before committing to an incubator, ask yourself these questions: 
 
Does the incubator offer the services and contacts you need?&lt;br&gt; 
What services do you need to make your venture successful? Business plan development, legal/accounting advice, marketing, laboratory space, manufacturing facilities? Be sure the incubator offers what you need or can connect you to service providers who can meet those needs. 
 
Do you meet the incubator’s criteria?&lt;br&gt; 
Find out the incubator’s qualifications for accepting clients before applying—some incubators expect prospective clients to have fully developed business plans, whereas others require a less developed idea and offer business plan development assistance. 

Is the fee structure right for you?&lt;br&gt; 
Most for-profit incubators exchange space and services for an equity share in their client companies, whereas most non-profits charge fees for space and services. If a large cash infusion and speed to market are essential for your success, then giving up equity in your company in order to secure quick cash might be the way to go. But if you don’t want to give up equity and are willing to build your company more slowly, then paying fees for services and space may be a better choice. 
   
'''Ups and downs'''&lt;br&gt; 
As with just about everything, there are advantages and disadvantages to incubating your business. Some advantages are: 
 
* Reduced rent (on average, business incubators charge 25-50% less than normal rents) 
* Access to business and entrepreneurial wisdom 
* Ease of networking  
* Sharing ideas and a culture of innovation with peers  
* Legitimacy, which can go a long way toward luring investors 
   
Some disadvantages: 

* Some business incubators are more successful at accomplishing their goals than others 
* Subsidized rent, camaraderie, expert advice, and free help are hard to beat. Some companies graduating from incubators aren’t sufficiently battle tested. 
* You may not need to incubate at all. Why give away equity to get services you can seek independently? In many instances, it is not clear what value the incubator adds.

'''Innovating the incubator'''&lt;br&gt; 
Institutions like the University of Maryland are finding new ways to incubate businesses. One example is the Hinman Campus Entrepreneurship Opportunities (CEOs) program at UM, the nation’s first “living-learning” entrepreneurship initiative, which brings students from diverse majors together under one roof to learn how to start their own businesses. A specialized, high-tech “e-Dorm,” seminars and workshops from venture capitalists and successful businesspeople, industry-student mentoring, and unique entrepreneurship education courses give students a stimulating “living incubator” environment in which to realize their ideas. 

'''Business Incubation Center at CBP'''&lt;br&gt; 
Is a non profit based incubator which offers not only office space but the innovative &quot;virtual&quot; services, allowing clients to look and communicate professionally to their clients.  The resident incubees have unlimited access to free one on one counseling and have hours of professional services from an accountant, lawyer, marketing expert and others.  Home based businesses can rent an office for a day, a week or even a month.  There are also hourly meeting room rental facilities to conduct meetings in a professional environment.  The clients are able to enjoy a variety of training workshops, specifically designed for small businesses.

'''Incubation at Rensselaer'''&lt;br&gt; 
The Rensselaer Incubator Program at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute has nurtured technology start-ups for twenty-three years, graduating a number of successful student-run companies. Simon Balint, the Interim Director of the RPI incubator, told us how university relationships and the incubator network benefit fledgling companies. 

The Rensselaer Incubator Program is university-run, as are one-third of the incubators in the US. “That is a large draw,” said Balint,  “because universities provide access to talented workforces (students and faculty), access to sophisticated equipment and expertise, and the potential for joint research and grant funding.” Balint coordinates student projects in which MBAs write business plans, engineers produce CAD drawings, and computer science majors build Websites, assistising incubator clients for credit. 

The program is great at helping students find advisors and build  their networks. The on-site incubator staff is always available to provide advice and help clients resolve issues on an informal basis. More formally, area consultants volunteer to hold one-on-one mentoring sessions weekly at the incubator. Finally, clients can benefit from the wider community. The incubator has “deep relationships with the campus and the external community and can help the companies build advisory boards. “We draw on graduate incubator entrepreneurs and executives, civic leaders, and business leaders and pull them together to act as mentors and advisors to the companies,” says Balint.

      <comment>/* Choosing team players over superstars: SolemteX */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Choosing team players over superstars: SolemteX''' ==
 
As Owen Boyd grew his business, he picked the most impressive résumés from the pile to build his management team. 

This, he says, was his biggest mistake.  

“I wish I had known at the time how important building a team was rather than building a company,” said Boyd. “I hired everyone based on their resume rather than how they would fit together.”  

Boyd’s hiring strategy gave him a very intelligent group of people, each with their own big ego. The ability to work well together is critical for a small start-up team, and Boyd found that all the egotism stifled collaboration, prompted managers to exaggerate their progress, and caused them to make the same mistakes again and again.  

Boyd now knows that mutual respect, honesty, and the ability to learn from mistakes are crucial traits for a team. It took five years and a complete staff turnover for Boyd to find the right people, but the current staff has been in place for three years and the company has doubled revenues each year.  

Boyd thought of the idea for SolmeteX, which develops and manufactures specialized technology for the safe and economic removal of heavy metal contaminants, while he was working with his father in power plant development. He noticed that industrial water treatment systems, like those in power plants, used 100 year old technology. He had recently read an article about a new technology for drug separations and believed that its principles could be applied to modernize water purification.  

Beginning with money from family and friends, Boyd rented a basement and began to test chemical separation techniques. He warned his funders that they had little chance of getting their money back. After the early stage, he wrote a business plan and secured venture capital money to continue. Although using venture capital meant ceding some power (as Boyd explains, no matter how much stock share they have, “they have the cash, which means they have control”) he became more comfortable with them over time, realizing that they were also relying on him.  

His initial strategy was to market the chemical separation technology for large projects. Holding lunches at engineering firms brought in sales, but not profits. Boyd notes that to succeed in unprofitable times, “you have to have the idea that you will be successful and understand why you are not making money.” 

Boyd responded by shifting his focus to smaller applications in markets with dominant distributors, including a device he developed to trap mercury during dental procedures. The large dental supply distributors pushed SolmeteX products to dentists. Demand was mostly driven by regulatory standards for pollutants, so SolmeteX concentrates on educating regulators about the need for and availability of better technology. In regulated markets, SolmeteX has achieved 50-70% of the market share. 

This will be the first profitable year for SolmeteX, a feat that can be enjoyed by the current management of the company. Now that the egos are gone, SolmeteX has a team that feels like a family and demonstrates mutual respect. Boyd says “people really have to enjoy what they are doing. It’s like sports: they want to be on a winning team.”

      <comment>/* The right team at the right time: Keen Mobility */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''The right team at the right time: Keen Mobility''' ==
 
Often, the best teams don’t form as a result of careful planning: good teams synthesize when the right people work on the right project at the right time. Such is the story of Vail Horton and the Keen Mobility E-Team. 

Born without legs, Horton learned determination and perseverance at a young age. At four he pleaded with his parents for prosthetic legs, and got his wish when a team of biomedical engineers at the Rusk Institute of New York University designed a pair of custom titanium legs for use with ordinary wooden crutches.  

While glad to be free of a wheelchair, over the years the jolting of the crutches caused tremendous discomfort in Horton’s back, shoulders, and arms. In college he was diagnosed with osteoarthritis in his shoulders, and when the incessant pain became severe his doctors prescribed a wheelchair. Horton refused; he had experienced an independent lifestyle, and for him, going back to a wheelchair wasn’t an option. 

One day, Horton, then a business student at the University of Portland, walked into the engineering department and asked if someone could build him a crutch with a shock absorber. A professor who happened to be in her office at the time spoke with him about it. “A few days later,” said Horton, “three engineering students called me and said, ‘We’ve been assigned to build your crutch for our senior year project.’ I said, ‘Oh, cool’.”  

Just like that, the team was formed.  

The group was soon accepted into UP’s E-Scholar program, in which students form teams and pursue a business venture funded partly by the university and partly by themselves. Horton and his team began a venture based around a new, improved crutch—one that wouldn’t be detrimental to long-term users. 

But the team wasn’t complete. Horton soon realized they needed more information about how the crutch would affect the human body, and took steps to add a life sciences major to the ranks. Horton, the three engineers and the life sciences major met once a week over the course of their senior year and, aided by NCIIA Advanced E-Team funding, eventually came up with a product: the Keen Krutch. The improved crutch featured underarm cushioning that conformed to the curvature of the body; a contour shape to redistribute pressure; adjustable, mobile handgrips to prevent carpal tunnel; shock absorbers, and a pivoting ankle joint for increased mobility. 

Then everyone graduated. Horton decided to try and commercialize the Keen Krutch, but the engineers didn’t join him. Says Horton, “They didn’t see entrepreneurship in the same light as myself. I gave them every opportunity to stay and form part of the company, but I didn’t have the resources to offer and they weren’t willing to accept the risk associated with running a startup.” 

Horton decided to call on an old friend and former roommate, Jerry Carleton. Carleton had already accepted a job in northern California, but jumped at the chance to join Horton. Says Carleton, “Just knowing Vail, I was already caught up in the vision and I knew he was going to take the company as far as it could go. I knew he was the kind of guy that would never say die—that he was putting his mind to this company and was going to make it a huge success. So when the moment came and I was sitting there at lunch and he offered me the job, I didn’t hesitate.” 

Together the two founded a small startup company, Keen Mobility. Five years and a grueling, exhausting, and ultimately rewarding startup process later, the company is on its feet and growing rapidly. Alongside the Keen Krutch, the company manufactures a wide array of technologically advanced, safe ambulatory aids and other progressive products that allow the disabled greater mobility, safety and independence.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Recreational fishing might be one of the most popular widely intensively studied learning experiences that Americans (and indeed many other nationalities) participate in.  According to the American Sportfishing Association nearly 40 million angler generate 45 billion dollars in sales with perhaps an total contribution of 125 billion dollars to the US economy.

A definite portion of this is funneled into guides, magazines, and other learning experiences for the many Americans that seek improvement in the activity of catching a fish on a hook (angling.)

It is then with pleasure that I begin the process of defining one of my most intensive learning effort.  I look forward to and hope for collaboration from the many Americans whom have superior knowledge in the recreational activity.  

Fishing has so many different forms, waters and specialties.  Many I am unfamiliar with.  I do though have some knowledge and experience angling for many different kinds of fish in Eastern (US) rivers.  Despite the apparent ease of not needing expanisive water craft, or the complexities of fly casting and downrigger trolling; river fishing has its own mystique and difficulty.  I hope to document some of what I have learned.

If there is any urgent needs for this project, it is definitely for experience in larger waters.  Having defined a river, as 'big enough to support a diverse gamefish population', my experiences definitely are with smaller waters than the major rivers of the United States.

Thank you for your curiosity and invite you to ask questions and post comments, questions and content as much as you are able.

      <comment>/* Business Plans and Why You Need One */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Business Plans and Why You Need One''' ==
 
'''What is a business plan?'''&lt;br&gt; 
A business plan is a twenty- to forty-page document that serves the dual role of being an internal road map for your team and an external sales tool for potential investors, customers, and partners. Your business plan describes the entirety of your venture: the problem you’re solving, your solution, the technology behind it, the size of your target market, the customers, the competition, your business model, team, financial needs, and exit strategy.  

A business plan forces you to think things through early; it ensures you have well-defined venture goals. Clear goals help generate a clear path for you and your team to follow as you begin to implement your venture.  

'''The elements of a business plan'''&lt;br&gt; 
Business plans vary widely, but most consist of: 
 
* The executive summary 
* The problem you’re solving or the need you’re filling 
* Your solution 
* Technology and IP 
* Size of opportunity/market 
* Customers and how you will reach them 
* Competition 
* Business model 
* Team 
* Financial needs 
* Exit strategy 
   
The '''executive summary''' is a 2- to 5-page section that summarizes the plan’s main points. In a few pages, the executive summary conveys the essence of the venture. It should contain only the key points from the important sections of the full plan.  

'''The problem you’re solving or the need you’re filling''' is stated in an introductory section. Don’t shy away from aggressive terms and phrases in this section—you want to grab the reader’s attention. 

'''Your solution''', or how you will alleviate the pain, is stated in general terms.  

'''Your technology and IP''' are described in more detail in the next section. Explain specifically how the technology works, but don’t overdo it; the explanation should be comprehensible to an intelligent layperson with some knowledge of the field. State whether the technology is yours or licensed, and, if so, from whom and under what conditions. Describe the status of your IP protection. What patents have been granted, applied for, will be applied for? Supply the patent numbers or the application numbers if you have them. State if you’re protected by other forms of IP. 

'''Size of opportunity/market''' If you’re creating a new market it can be difficult to gauge its potential size, whereas if you’re introducing a better technology into an existing market, the estimate can be more accurate. Regardless, you and your potential investors need to feel comfortable that the potential market is large enough to sustain a profitable business. 

'''Customers and how you will reach them''' Points to discuss include who your target customers are, your strategy for selling to them, what channels you will use, and when. Demonstrate an understanding of your target customers.  

'''Competition''' Demonstrate knowledge of your competitors. Who are they? Are they selling the same or different technology? Who are the likely new entrants? Are they both domestic and foreign? What are their strengths and weaknesses? 

'''Business model''' is a general outline of the way your company will make a profit. We go into more detail on business models later in this section. 

'''Team''' This section should convince potential investors that they can trust your team with their money. Does your team: 
 
* Have the knowledge, experience, diverse skill sets, integrity, drive, persistence, and passion required to make it happen, in spite of the adversity and obstacles that are likely to arise along the way? 
* Understand its limitations? Are you willing to seek help and listen? 
* Work with solid, experienced directors and advisors? 
   
Although important, this section of the plan is only the first step in the convincing process. Personal interactions with investors and the due diligence process also play an important role. 

'''Financial needs''' including the amount of money the venture is seeking and over what time frame; how the money will be used; the major assumptions involved; and when you will achieve cash flow break-even and profitability. 

'''Exit strategy''' details how investors will get their money back (hopefully with a healthy return) and exit your company. Some exit strategies are Initial Public Offering (IPO), merger/acquisition, and buyout by a strategic partner

|

'''Nine questions every business plan should answer'''&lt;br&gt;
   
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Who is the customer?&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;li&gt;How does the customer make decisions about buying this product or service?&lt;/li&gt;  
&lt;li&gt;To what degree is the product or service a compelling purchase for the customer?&lt;/li&gt;  
&lt;li&gt;How will the product or service be priced?&lt;/li&gt;  
&lt;li&gt;How will the product reach all the identified customer segments?&lt;/li&gt;  
&lt;li&gt;How much does it cost (in time and resources) to acquire a customer?&lt;/li&gt;  
&lt;li&gt;How much does it cost to produce and deliver the product or service?&lt;/li&gt;  
&lt;li&gt;How much does it cost to support a customer?&lt;/li&gt;  
&lt;li&gt;How easy is it to retain a customer?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;   

From “How to Write a Great Business Plan” by William A. Sahlman. Harvard Business Review, July-August, 1997.

 
'''The real benefits of a business plan'''&lt;br&gt; 
Jeremie Spitzer and Paul G. Silva talked to us about their experience creating a business plan for Zform, a software entertainment company that creates fully accessible games for both blind and sighted communities. 

Spitzer says that before actually sitting down to write the business plan for Zform, he hadn’t thought at all about marketing. He soon realized that he needed to do some research and identify the competition. 

“Don’t just jump into a new venture [without planning] because you will drown in the small details and won’t even realize that you’re way off base. A business plan forces you to think of all the details that you wouldn’t normally think about. When you write your plans down on paper, you have to be clear. The process of writing forces you to work out the details.” 

Spitzer emphasizes that there is no such thing as a final plan. “You need to accept and be comfortable with the fact that your business plan is a live document that will always be changing.” 

Silva suggests looking to others for advice. “Planning is essentially answering questions that have already been laid out for you by people that are experienced and know exactly what will hurt your venture if you don’t plan. The process of planning was ten times more valuable than the actual business plan itself.” 

Silva believes in learning from others’ mistakes. He regularly reads the “Postmortem” section of Game Developer magazine, which talks about games that have failed and why they have failed. 

Silva advises new venture seekers, “Talk to an industry veteran who has experienced failure, and ask why.“ 

Another viewpoint on business plans comes from Phyl Speser of Foresight Science &amp; Technology. “Most folks will disagree with me, but I think [business plans] are highly overrated. Boeing never had a business plan until late in the last century. They knew what they did: they built airplanes. If you’re going out for venture capital money, you need a twenty+ page plan. If you’re not, you usually need a much smaller one. Essentially, you need as much of a plan as is necessary for your team or your investors. Otherwise, don’t waste the time.”

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Business Models''' ==
A business model is a general outline of the transactions needed for your idea to make a profit. The most basic business model involves simply producing a product or service and selling it directly to customers. The company makes a profit if revenues are greater than production and business costs. 
 
'''Business models are goal-driven'''&lt;br&gt; 
When developing your business model, clearly define the type of business you are pursuing and your goals for your business venture. Once you have a well-defined business idea and specific goals, you can establish the method by which you are going to make your profit. 

First, identify your venture type. Is it a product, a service, or a business? If it’s a business, is it a service business or a product business? Is it a lifestyle business or a high growth business? A lifestyle business prioritizes lifestyle issues such as independence, location, and hours. A high-growth business gives priority to growth, expansion, and money back to investors. 

If you have an idea for a product, do you have the means to produce and sell this product or do you plan to license it to another company? Ask yourself if your team is capable of getting the product or service to market. If not, who will help you, and how will you make money using their help? 
 
'''Some model models'''&lt;br&gt; 
Your business model generically defines the product or business you are proposing, your customers, and the transaction mechanism(s) that will allow you to make money. This is an important step before you begin creating your formal business plan. Your business plan will describe your model in more detail. 

Subscription-based and advertisement-based models are examples of business models found both on- and off-line. Many companies combine two or more business models or create their own unique model. 

In a subscription-based business model, the provider charges a fee for access to the service. An example of this is Consumer Reports magazine. Consumer Reports relies solely on its subscription sales. It can do this because it carries a well-known brand name, and provides high quality print and online content, for which people are willing to pay. 

An exclusively advertisement-based model provides free content to attract users, and is financially supported by advertisers. Network television is the most obvious model. The more successful a show is at attracting eyes, the more advertisers are willing to pay. Another example of an advertising-based business model, Yahoo!, provides free access to useful online resources. Users accept the presence of advertisements throughout the Yahoo! site. (Note: Yahoo! is gradually incorporating more subscription-based services.) 

A licensing model is used by most software companies and some specialty product companies to create products, then license them to other companies. The Bagel Biter in Northampton, MA manufactures a bagel-slicing machine, and gets others to sell it in their catalogs and stores. This model works for companies that have a narrow product line and can sell a limited number of units.  
 
'''What happened to the dotcoms?'''&lt;br&gt; 
The most talked about business models in recent memory are based in e-commerce. Dotcoms held the promise of unlimited wealth production with minimal overhead. Most businesses today offer a way for consumers to access their product or service online, but the surge of exclusively online businesses has faded. Many sites that thrived in the late 90s are now defunct. What happened? 

Paul A. Greenberg writes, “Many of the young dot-commers rejected traditional business models in favor of rampant spending, over-extension of debt and high-risk ventures backed by adventurous investors.”1 Colin Duguid and Caroline Tresman add, “A solid business is not maintained just by its shop front or by its product, but by basic business skills through its management and staff. If the management has little or no skills but ‘a great idea,’ how long would it last and could they see what would otherwise be simple business problems?” 

To survive, plan your venture and evaluate your team’s financial capabilities as well as your business management experience. Also, analyze the market to determine if your model can make a profit. Lastly make sure that you are aware of your competitors and your possible risks (more on these issues in the section 2, “The Market”).

'''About business models'''&lt;br&gt; 
“Business models themselves do not offer solutions; rather, how each business is run determines its success. So the success of e-commerce businesses will hinge largely on the art of management even as it is enabled by science and technology.”  

From “The Truth about Internet Business Models,” by Jeffrey F. Rayport. 
 

“A business model is quite simple: it is a brief statement of how an idea actually becomes a business that makes money. It tells who pays, how much, and how often. The same product or service may be brought to market with several business models..” 

From “Anatomy of a Business Model” by Steve Robbins. 


'''Differentiating your business: A real life example'''&lt;br&gt; 
Frank Hertz, Co-founder of Newmediary.com, founded in 1999, says that unlike many of its fellow dotcoms his business is surviving. Hertz, Newmediary’s vice president of operations, told us about his company’s business model and what makes it different. 

“We build, host, and manage private-label online directories for leading publishers and portals. We sell companies enhanced subscriptions (listings in the directories), and access to sales leads, or RFPs (Requests for Proposals) on behalf of those directories, and return a portion of that revenue to the partner. 

The partner gets a no-cost revenue stream; we get to sell a product with an established brand name on it, and keep a large portion of that revenue, as opposed to having to build our own brand. 

So, this is how we’ve differentiated ourselves in the market: essentially, by not caring if people (other than partners) know who we are. It’s worked up to this point. And all those dotcom companies that raised, in some cases, hundreds of millions, to establish a brand name, are now out of business. So we’re happy we embarked on the ego-less business model of what’s termed Application Service Provider (ASP).”

“In the most basic sense, a business model is the method of doing business by which a company can sustain itself—that is, generate revenue. The business model spells out how a company makes money by specifying where it is positioned in the value chain.” 

From “Business Models on the Web” by Michael Rappa.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Measuring Your Success''' ==
 
'''When is this going to make money?'''&lt;br&gt; 
In the typical business world, profits are the ultimate measure of success.  Investors look to the financial statements to find the story of how the company performed. Projected financials are also important. If you don’t know how to create financial statements, ask a business major or accountant to help you.  
 
'''Cash is king'''&lt;br&gt; 
For a start-up business, or any business, having cash when you need it is crucial. In fact, many profitable businesses fail because they grow too quickly and run out of cash along the way. You could face this problem too if the payments to your suppliers are due before you get paid by your customers. Predict the timing of your cash inflow and outflow, and make sure you have the cash to cover yourself when you make decisions. 

In operating your company, keep close track of your cash position. While you’re working to make your venture viable, you should probably estimate your cash flow on a daily basis. The term burn rate refers to how quickly a company is using up its available cash. If you don’t have a perfect picture of how you are using money, estimate your burn rate to determine how many days you have until you need more funding or have to cease operations.  

Your original business plan might include a rough cash flow estimation.  Your financiers will use it to determine when they will begin getting a return on their investment, and how high the return will be. 

The balance sheet reports the position of the company at a point in time. It is divided into three parts: assets, liabilities, and owner’s equity. Assets represent everything of value in the firm, such as property, inventory, cash, and payments owed by customers. Typically the assets are listed in order of decreasing liquidity, meaning that the ones easiest to convert cash are first. Liabilities represent debts owed to customers, employees, and banks. These are listed roughly in order of when they come due. Owner’s equity is what’s left over when liabilities are subtracted from assets. It’s the value of the owner’s (or stockholder’s) share of the company if it were to cease operations. The actual value of the company is based on its future potential (and should be higher than owner’s equity on the balance sheet).  

The income statement reports the revenues and expenses of the company over a specified time period, culminating in a profit or loss. Income is reported based on accounting rules and often does not reflect cash changing hands. Revenues can be reported when a product is sold and delivered to the buyer even if they have not paid (but will pay in the future). The income statement also follows the “matching principle,” which requires expenses to be matched to revenues and reported at the same time. This means that expenses incurred to produce a product are not reported in the income statement until that product is sold. 

The cash flow statement documents the sources and uses of cash over a specified time period. Each activity where cash is gained or lost is listed, along with the amount. The activities are typically divided into operations, investment, and financing. Positive cash flow from operations is a sign that the business is making money from the goods and services it’s selling. The investment section documents cash used to purchase assets or gained in the sale of assets. The financing section represents cash borrowed from banks or gained through the sale of stock, and cash used to pay back loans or repurchase stock.  
 
'''More than one bottom line'''&lt;br&gt; 
You and your investors may want to achieve other returns on your venture. Again, we’re referring to the triple bottom line. While the first bottom line, profit, is shown in your financial statements, you must create metrics to report your other bottom lines (see the sidebar on the bottom left). Committing to goals that improve the environment or the human condition should be coupled with establishing a system to track your progress. It’s difficult to see how far you have come if you don’t have consistent ways to measure your impact. 

The National Social Venture Competition recommends two different options for quantifying social impact in dollar terms. One, based on project valuation techniques at the International Finance Corporation, involves thinking of the best alternative solution that exists to meeting the social need you are tackling. To find the monetary benefit of your method, subtract your expenses to meet this need from the expenses that would be incurred if the alternative solution was used instead.  The second is based on the approach used by Roberts Enterprise Development Fund to value its social venture returns. The monetary return is calculated by adding the savings to society (in governmental program costs that do not have to be spent) and the gains to society (in tax revenues) from your work, and subtracting your business expenses that are related to implementing the social purpose (and would not be otherwise incurred).

'''The Inexact Science of Social Return on Investment (SROI)'''&lt;br&gt; 
How do you know that your social venture is achieving its goals? It’s important not only that your venture promote a “good cause,” but also that its social returns argue for increasing investments. 

Social Return on Investment (SROI) measures social impact in dollar terms. Whereas financial return is relatively straightforward, differences in personal values and definitions of “social impact” require varying measures of social return. In fact, many social returns are impossible to quantify, making this a necessarily inexact science.  

SROI can be thought of in terms of jobs created, houses built, or lives saved. But to start a social venture, you need to come up with a model to measure your particular social impact. A working SROI model helps investors determine the attractiveness of a potential investment. Documenting meaningful social returns is crucial; without an understanding of the tangible and measurable effect created through an investor’s activity, the reasons to engage in this critical work are merely anecdotal. 


'''Developing a cash flow budget'''&lt;br&gt; 
Your cash flow budget is one of the most important financial statements you have. Done correctly, it provides your business with the necessary checks, balances, and financial controls to guide performance, win bankers’ hearts, and keep spending and investment impulses in check. Developing a budget is simple, and when created with solid sales and expense forecasts in mind, you can ensure that your budget will stand up to the daily demands of your business. 

Here are some steps you can take to create a cash flow budget you can rely on:
	
* Set business guidelines and goals. 
* Review current economic and business conditions; consider how they will affect your business. 
* Forecast sales for the budget period. 
* Forecast expenses for the budget period. 
* Prepare a profit-and-loss projection. 
* Run a reality check on the numbers. Compare them to your goals, trade figures, and historical figures. 
* Project monthly cash inflows for the budget period. 
* Project monthly cash disbursements (outflows) for the budget period. 
* Project operating data. Move controllable items around to achieve the best positive cash flow possible. 
* Prepare your cash flow budget: the “finished”cash flow projection. Look for periods of negative cash flow, as well as unusually positive periods. 
* Compare budgeted with actual performance monthly. 
* Review performance and recast forecasts (both P&amp;L and cash flow) annually or as needed.

      <comment>/* Presenting Your Plan */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Presenting Your Plan''' ==
 
If everything goes right, at some point you’ll find yourself presenting your plan to potential investors. This can be nerve-wracking for anyone, especially first-timers, but you can do a number of things to ensure your presentation comes off well. 
 
'''Your objective: inspiration and distillation'''&lt;br&gt; 
When you present your plan, be enthusiastic, be confident and clearly illustrate the need for the product or service you plan to provide. Quickly evoke substantial interest in your venture. Once you’ve captured attention and interest, the audience will ask questions that allow you to expand on your ideas. 
 
'''Think about your audience'''&lt;br&gt; 
How you present your business plan depends both on your audience and your situation. You really have two pitches: one for end-users (customers) and one for investors. The first focuses on price, performance, and ease of use that provides a sustainable competitive advantage. The second explains why the first one generates substantial return on investment (ROI) for investors or licensees.  

And, although you may be formally presenting your plan to venture capitalists, don’t overlook the opportunity to present your ideas to the people you meet every day. In both cases it’s important to be socially astute and to recognize the needs and interests of the people with whom you are speaking. 
 
'''Elevator pitch'''&lt;br&gt; 
Regardless of the situation, you have about thirty seconds to get the audience’s attention. One of the most important skills you need is to be able to explain your plan, out loud or in writing, in 30 seconds or less (the amount of time you might have riding an elevator with a prospective funder). Your elevator pitch is a clear, articulate, and concise description of your purpose that should also relay your passion for your venture. When you use the elevator pitch in a written document, the audience should immediately understand what your venture is about.  
 
'''Brevity is key'''&lt;br&gt; 
Thoughtfully prepare your elevator pitch. You have about thirty seconds to grab the attention of your audience regardless of the situation. Bill Joos from Garage Technology Ventures1 (www.garage.com) recommends that you begin your pitch with an engaging tag line that incorporates your business’s product or service and purpose. A clever tag line can directly and simply convey your idea, and when you have a captive audience you can elaborate on your business. Your ability to clearly, concisely and passionately state your purpose establishes that you have well-defined goals and are adequately prepared to promote your ideas. This also allows you to get your point across before your listener has time to get bored. 
 
'''Rules of public speaking'''&lt;br&gt;  
Make sure that you tell your audience what you are going to tell them, tell them what you want them to know and then tell them what you told them. Emphasize a few key points throughout your presentation and do not overwhelm your audience with too much information. Help the audience retain what you’ve said by strategically repeating the most important information. If you’ve covered a few main points, you’ve probably given your audience enough information—again, if members of the audience are interested in learning more, they will ask questions. 

'''Main points of a presentation'''&lt;br&gt; 
Bill Joos recommends using the following outline for your business plan presentation:  
 
'''Summary'''&amp;mdash;a modified version of your elevator pitch. Tell your audience your mission, quickly describe the product and, if appropriate, tell them how much funding you need.&lt;br&gt;  
'''Market'''&amp;mdash;Establish your market by introducing the problem that you will solve with your product or service.&lt;br&gt;  
'''Solution'''&amp;mdash;Explain your proposed venture and how it will solve the problem. Include a description of your idea, a brief description of how you are going to implement this idea, your awareness of major competitors, how you will market this service or product and how you plan to profit from this venture.&lt;br&gt; 
'''Team'''&amp;mdash;Establish that you have a competent team with past experience that makes them ideal for your business venture.&lt;br&gt; 
'''Use of Funds'''&amp;mdash;Explain how you plan to use acquired funds to implement your venture.&lt;br&gt; 
'''Recap'''&amp;mdash;Briefly summarize the main points of what you just finished telling your audience, leaving key points of your presentation fresh in their minds as you ask them to invest in your venture. 
   
'''End with action'''&lt;br&gt; 
At the end of your presentation, tell your audience what you want them to do. Directly invite your listeners to become a part of your venture and let them know how to go about getting involved.

'''Example of a great pitch'''&lt;br&gt; 
Here’s an example of a solid elevator pitch that proposes selling construction boots over the Internet. Read the pitch out loud and time yourself—you’ll see that it can be done in 60 seconds or less. 
 
“ConstructionBoots.com is an e-commerce website that sells construction boots on a b2c and a b2b basis. Our primary  market consists of construction workers, with secondary markets including other individuals and companies in the construction trade. We offer the highest quality products and drive traffic to the site by linking to other websites related to the construction industry. We believe the customer would find purchasing and direct delivery of construction  boots through our website easier than purchasing via traditional retail outlets. 

We believe we will be the only pure e-commerce construction boot site, but will face indirect competition from traditional brick and  mortar b2b retailers who target the trade as well as traditional mass merchandisers. If all goes as planned, we would look to sell ConstructionBoots.com to an industry retailer who sells construction gear.” 


'''Tips for your elevator pitch'''&lt;br&gt;
Betsy Komjathy recommends these five tips for presenting your plan to potential customers:
	 
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Never open with “What do you do?” It’s a lazy question, and it leads to a dead-end conversation.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;li&gt;Listen for clues that tell you how the person looks at the world. The better you understand a potential customer’s experience and values, the better you can customize your pitch.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;li&gt;Don’t carry on about yourself. Top business developers are succinct, natural, and compelling: Whatever they say about themselves is relevant to the listener.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;li&gt;Don’t be too quick to direct the conversation to business. Chat about a general business topic—perhaps something in the day’s news—before making a segue into your agenda.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;li&gt;If someone is disinclined to chat, act accordingly. It’s better to show restraint, to exchange business cards, and to leave a good impression.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;  

From “How to Deliver the Big Pitch,” by Todd Balf. Fast Company, June, 1999. 


“Prepare what you’re going to say—don’t wing it! Once you get the material down, and say it out loud, try it in front of your co-workers—but make sure they are able to give (and that you are able to take) criticism.” 

&amp;mdash;Steven Bruner 


“I didn’t have time to write you a short letter, so I wrote you a long one.” 

&amp;mdash;Mark Twain

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Licensing as Part of the Plan''' ==
 
'''Consider licensing'''&lt;br&gt;  
Let’s say you have a promising venture idea but find yourself without the funds or experience to produce and commercialize the product or service. You have the option of licensing the patent rights for your intellectual property to a company rather than starting your own business. A license is a formal agreement made between an inventor (the licensor) and a company (the licensee). The inventor gives a company certain rights to produce, market, sell and/or use his or her invention or idea in exchange for either royalties from product sales or a fixed payment. 

Sometimes it makes more sense to license a product to a company that already makes similar products. Let’s say, for example, you’ve perfected the design for a dusting apparatus that can reach into tight spaces without knocking things over. If you can market your idea to a well-known company that already makes small household cleaning devices, you might do better than if you launch a whole new enterprise revolving around your duster. If the invention succeeds in the marketplace, and if you have a well-structured licensing agreement, licensing can be very profitable.  

If you think licensing is right for you, include your licensing strategy in your business plan. 
 
'''Advantages of licensing'''&lt;br&gt; 
Both starting a company and manufacturing a product involve a great deal of time, money, responsibility, and risk. By licensing your venture idea you transfer all of those responsibilities and risks to someone else. Licensing is ideal for the person or team that wants to keep inventing rather than starting and running a company. By choosing to license, you also have the advantage of presenting your venture ideas to well-established companies that are set up to manufacture and market products similar to yours; such compatibility can increase your chances for success in the market. 
 
'''What a license looks like'''&lt;br&gt; 
A license agreement usually describes in detail what is being licensed and the circumstances in which the licensee can use the technology. The latter includes the kind of license it will be. In exclusive licenses, only one licensee can use the technology under a specific set of conditions (this also excludes the owner of the technology from using it within the specific conditions of the license). In partially exclusive licenses, either the total number of permitted licensees is spelled out or the exclusivity ends after a certain specified time period. A non-exclusive license means you may license your technology to an unlimited number of licensees at any time. Exclusive licenses are generally more expensive than the other types (higher up front payments, royalty rates, minimums, etc.).  

Aside from deciding the exclusivity of the license, you can also spell out the specific activities the licensee may engage in. They may only be licensed to manufacture or sell the product, or both; perhaps the licensee may only conduct additional product development. Also, you can construct the license for specific circumstances; for example, the licensee may only distribute the product in three distinct geographic regions, may only use it for medical purposes, may only use it in certain industries or in certain products, etc. The license agreement should spell out whether or not the licensee has the right to sub-license the technology to others, and if so, under what circumstances. 

Negotiate the terms of your license carefully. Don’t “give away the store” by granting an exclusive worldwide license for all uses with low minimum payments, rather than a number of non-exclusive licenses for individual uses at reasonable minimums for each. At the same time, don’t place undue limits on the licensee, as it could become impossible for your product to be profitable. 
 
'''Finding the right company or companies'''&lt;br&gt; 
Do some research to determine what companies can best produce, market and sell your product or service. First, identify companies that have products similar to those you are proposing. Eliminate companies where your product would compete with any of the products the company is already producing. Go to the library and consult the Thomas Registrar of American Manufacturers, trade journals, Standard Rates and Data, and/or the Dun &amp; Bradstreet Million Dollar Database. 

Now figure out which companies would be most interested in your product and can produce and sell it most efficiently. Check the company’s position on the Fortune 500 list of the most successful businesses in the United States and check its ranking on the Standard and Poors listing. This type of research is essential for finding reputable companies that have the technology to both produce and sell your product. 
 
'''Defining your property''' &lt;br&gt;
Before you can negotiate the terms of your licensing contract, precisely define the intellectual property you are licensing. See the sidebar on the right for important questions to ask when laying out your definitions.

'''It’s all about relationships'''&lt;br&gt; 
The best approach to licensing by a novice inventor is for the parties (licensor and licensee) to discuss the agreement and come to an understanding of what they want and need, without attorneys. Work toward building a stronger relationship as you discuss licensing objectives. Remember that your licensees will be your partners for years to come. Your goal is to have mutually attainable goals. 

From “From Patent to Profit,” by Bob DeMatteis, page 252. 


'''Timing matters'''&lt;br&gt; 
Virtually any type of product can be licensed. What varies is the stage at which a company will license the product. You may be able to strike an agreement quickly if you are already successfully producing and selling the product. You may be able to license a product with just a prototype if it meets a clear market need in a convincing way. In some cases, you may even be able to license an idea in the concept stage if the product has breakthrough potential in a major market.

'''Defining your IP'''&lt;br&gt; 
In The Portable MBA in Entrepreneurship, William D. Bygrave recommends that you ask the following questions when defining your intellectual property:
	 
* Is it more than one patent, just one patent, or only a part of one patent? 
* Is it just the trademark, or the entire corporate image—names, advertising, and promotional scheme and graphics? 
* If it concerns copyright, does it cover just the right to copy a book or other printed material in the same print form, or does it include any of the following rights? 
   
&amp;mdash;Translation into another language&lt;br&gt; 
&amp;mdash;Adaptation for stage, screen, or video&lt;br&gt; 
&amp;mdash;Creation of derivative works&lt;br&gt; 
&amp;mdash;Merchandising characters and events on T-shirts and toys?&lt;br&gt;
  
* If it involves know-how or trade secrets, where are they defined?

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Innovation in the bag: Bob DeMatteis''' ==
 

Whether you know it or not, you’re connected to Bob DeMatteis. This leading packaging systems innovator holds the patent and license on the self-opening plastic bags used in supermarkets and national giants like Wal-Mart, Sears, and Kroger. Nearly everyone has likely used his product. 

We spoke with DeMatteis about inventing, the reasons for his success, and the advice he has for inventors looking to license their technology. 

'''When inventing, look to increase productivity'''&lt;br&gt; 
Before I developed the self-opening plastic bag, paper bags were the standard because they were very easy to use and could carry a lot. I was in the plastics packaging industry at the time, and I knew that plastic bags were more cost effective than paper. But there were issues with plastic: at that point plastic bags came in boxes, and you’d have to reach into the box to pull out a bag—sometimes you’d pull out three or four because they would stick together—and then you’d have to stick your finger inside the bag and swab it around to open it up, and only then start loading it. It was very inefficient, very unproductive. I knew that if plastic bags weren’t made easier to use, they would never replace paper.  

I got to thinking about it, and one day when I was driving down the highway it struck me: a self-opening bag. You mount the bags on a hook and swipe your finger across the bag and it automatically opens. It’s faster and cheaper than paper—more efficient, more productive. That’s why plastic has replaced paper, by and large, as the bag of choice. 

'''Make it “people friendly”'''&lt;br&gt; 
A lot of innovations are more pure science than anything else: new plastics, new medical breakthroughs, etc. Those are great and needed, but they aren’t products in themselves. They only give you the opportunity to use them in new products. For instance, one of my new products is a plastic valve bag for the concrete industry. We needed a very strong plastic for this application, and we found out that Exxon had developed a durable resin that was perfect for us. Exxon had spent $800 million developing it, but essentially had no market for it. When they found out about our plastic cement bags they were very, very interested in helping us out. 

But the key thing is that there were already a lot of plastic bag systems being used in the concrete industry, and many of them tried to emulate paper, which made them expensive to use. And, more importantly, many of the employees in the actual concrete filling plants had difficulty using the bags. So using Exxon’s resin we designed a bag that’s very easy for employees to use, and we’re now licensing the technology all across North America. And that’s what I mean by “people friendly”: develop the technology with the user in mind; make it simple, easy, intuitive. 

'''Licensing is a team effort'''&lt;br&gt; 
The teamwork concept is paramount in licensing. If an invention is going to be licensed successfully, it has to be a team effort. It has to be manufactured cost effectively, it has to have the “Wow” factor, it has to be protected with patents, and most importantly, it has to be marketed. Nothing happens until your invention gets sold.  

You have four partners on your team: the inventor, the lawyer, the manufacturing partner, and the marketing expert. The most important member of the team is your marketing expert. And almost invariably your marketing expert is your licensee. You really want your licensee to embrace your product. As long as that licensee embraces your invention, you know that you’ve got something—that you’re a team. 

'''Two things to look for in licensees'''&lt;br&gt; 
The first thing you look for in a licensee is whether or not the company is established in the field of your invention. They have to have experience. They have to be at a point where they can start marketing your innovation right away.  

The second thing to look at is the quality of product the company puts out. Your licensee has to be a company that sells and markets the same level of quality that you’re offering. In other words, if your licensee makes Timex watches, and your invention is a Rolex, they won’t understand how to reap benefit from the value you add. And most innovations are added quality, added value, making something more workable. That’s the essence of innovation—these small layers of improvements. Make sure your licensee can appreciate that. 

'''Knowing when your invention is licensable'''&lt;br&gt; 
To me, it comes down to what I call the Four Magic Words. You know you’ve got something special when your licensee tells you, “I can sell it.”

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Open to learn: Evan Edwards and EpiCard''' ==
 
'''EpiPlan'''&lt;br&gt; 
Evan Edwards knows a thing or two about business plans. The recipient of an NCIIA Advanced E-Team grant in 2000, Edwards has been working toward commercializing his invention—a credit-card-sized epinephrine injector for people with severe allergies, dubbed the “EpiCard”—for the past few years. We spoke with Edwards about what goes into a business plan, the lessons he’s learned about writing them, and his advice for nascent inventors looking to build a company around a new technology. 

'''You can do it'''&lt;br&gt; 
The fact is that if you’re smart enough to come up with a worthy invention or a worthy product, you’re smart enough to write a business plan. All you have to do is take advantage of the resources out there, and there are a ton of them. The first and best resource is people you know: mentors, professors, entrepreneurs, people who have been there before. Beyond personal help, there’s a multitude of online help sites, books, etc. When Eric [Evan’s twin brother, who is vice president of EpiCard] and I were looking to polish up our plan for the Darden Business Plan competition at the University of Virginia, we went to Barnes &amp; Noble, and ended up finding several books on writing effective business plans that really helped us out. We were the only student engineering entry, and undergrads at that, and we finished in the top four and won a period of incubation with Darden. 

'''It’s gonna change—a lot'''&lt;br&gt; 
Business plans are ever-changing. The first business plan we wrote for EpiCard was about ten pages. But as the scope of the company expanded we included more and more in the plan; for instance, we started looking to find ways to tap into the military market, so we included more of a military bent into it. And then we realized we didn’t have to stick to injecting epinephrine alone, and incorporated into the business plan our research into other drugs and pharmaceuticals that could be used in EpiCard—insulin, and nerve gas, smallpox, and anthrax antidotes. And we’ve continually revised and updated the market analysis and financial projection sections, refining, adding content. It’s a constant process. 

'''You’ll learn more than you think'''&lt;br&gt; 
When we started writing the business plan for the Darden competition we found competitors we never even knew existed. Knowing those competitors were out there was critical for us, and it’s critical for a lot of NCIIA E-Teams. Many E-Team inventions are an improvement to what’s already out there; you say, “I like this device, and I know a way I can make it better.” And you assume that one device is your only competition. But as you start researching you find other patents, other companies that are looking into the same things you’re looking into. These might be global companies, so that even if you have a patent in the US you might have to worry about international companies entering into the market. So it’s important to understand that while you’re developing the business plan you’re also finding out about things that are extremely important to your venture’s chances of success. 

'''Act on the feedback you get'''&lt;br&gt; 
You’ll learn a lot about your company’s strengths and weaknesses when you go to present your business plan to venture capitalists and angel investors. We’ve made the rounds and presented our plan, and the feedback we received from the angels and VCs was very specific and very helpful. We’ve been a family-run business, but the VCs pointed out that it looks bad if your entire board consists of family members, and recommended we look into that and reformulate the company. So we went out and talked to key people in the pharmaceutical industry, some doctors, and got them on board, and that’s definitely helped solidify our credibility. 

As you’re developing your business plan, and you start presenting it to these certain groups, you realize the areas of your business you need to focus on the most. 

'''Lean on others'''&lt;br&gt; 
I come from an engineering background, and my brother from biology, so we knew we had a good product and knew the market, but we had no idea when it came to the financial data. If you go to investors with data that’s questionable or inaccurate, they’ll call you out. They’ll say, “Where did you get that number from?” You need to know your information; you need to know your sources. When we incubated with Darden they provided us with a panel of experts that really helped us with the financial side.  

And that brings me to the real piece of advice I want to give: you have to interact with people. Talk with local businesses, join a venture group, join an on-campus entrepreneurship club. By going to their meetings and attending their seminars you’ll gain an understanding of how to write a business plan, or how to valuate your company, or how to do the financials. Whatever you need. You’ll make your strengths even stronger and you’ll shore up your weaknesses. By being in the company of businesspeople at Darden, by being around entrepreneurs, I was able to feed off them and really learned a lot about how to run a business.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Getting Started in the US of A''' ==

So you’ve got a great new idea and want to put it into action? Here’s some good news to get you started: a combination of unique characteristics make the United States an ideal place for innovators and entrepreneurs to launch their ventures. The advantages reach a spectrum of business models, so no matter what your ambitions, you’re starting out in a great place.

'''Risk is rewarded'''&lt;br&gt;
The United States’ business environment fosters and nurtures the growth of new businesses. Many elements of this environment are encouraging to entrepreneurs like you who are considering starting a company.

For example, legal structures in the US provide a range of options for different sizes and types of businesses, allowing their owners to take on varying levels of liability. This flexibility also creates a distinction between the individual and the corporation, further encouraging you to take business risks without fear of getting into too much serious trouble. Unless you do something illegal, or fail to make payroll taxes, you as an individual will not be held personally liable for the failure of a business.

And it’s not just US laws that reward you for taking risks. Our culture and society also reward the adventurous entrepreneur. We see it as acceptable, even courageous, to give a new venture your best shot and make lots of beginner’s mistakes, even if your business fails because of it.

The entrepreneur-friendly culture of the US tells us that making mistakes is just part of the process, and that success is all about taking the risk, and learning from your mistakes.

'''It’s who you know'''&lt;br&gt;
US business culture puts a heavy emphasis on networking—making interpersonal connections and using them to your advantage. As we’ve already said, getting to know people in your field and beyond can help you immeasurably; in fact, you can’t get far without that kind of help. Establishing a relationship with a mentor can help you avoid some painful and damaging mistakes. Additionally, a person with an established reputation can open doors for you. Take every opportunity to get to know people who might have the tools to help you out.

'''Calculated debt is OK...mostly'''&lt;br&gt;
Unlike many countries around the world, US culture approves the decision to borrow money to fund a new business. Getting a loan is okay, and being in debt is just fine. A few stories circulate about successful companies that launch themselves entirely on credit card debt (which, as you hopefully know, is about the worst loan deal around). Some credit card companies are even setting up special plans and incentives for the small business owner, further propagating the notion that debt carries no shame.

Of course, we hear a lot less about the failures in this approach, which are proportionally much, much greater. Be very careful about personally guaranteeing any kind of loan. You could be personally obligated for a long time to come. And remember: use full disclosure when you get any kind of financing. You don’t want to get money based on false pretenses, no matter how desperate you or your company are at the time.

Your team is ultimately responsible for the business decisions you make, for borrowing wisely, and for doing what it takes to help your company succeed. Every decision you make along the way has risks and consequences. It’s up to you to educate yourself thoroughly and decide whether they are smart and worthy risks.

'''A rich history of failure'''&lt;br&gt;
Many of America’s most successful businessmen failed in early business endeavors at least once, including ketchup magnate John Henry Heinz, Henry Ford of Ford Motor Company, and Phineas Barnum, founder of the American circus. All of them eventually became very rich, in part because they were given a chance to try a business, fail, and start over.

The philosophy behind this tolerant regulatory structure is to encourage people to create businesses, with the hope that they will succeed, hire employees, pay taxes, and improve the economy as a whole. These ideas are not new. As a society, Americans have always encouraged economic activity through the extensive use of credit. As early as the 1700s, when the US economy was competing with much more developed European economies, it grew faster than anyone could have imagined, partly through extensive use of credit, with some people being paid for goods and supplies months and even years after the credit was granted. This allowed people to start businesses without much money in their pockets. The availability of credit caused economic activity to soar, and a strong credit-based economy was born.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

'''A kinder, gentler bankruptcy'''&lt;br&gt;
Business failure in the United States, unlike in many other countries, is not regarded negatively. In fact, US bankruptcy laws are structured so that those who fail in business are encouraged to continue entrepreneurial pursuits. “If a business in the United States fails, the individual can move on with his or her life without living in shame or total poverty,” says Nathalie Martin, Dickason Professor of Law at the University of New Mexico. “The ability to start over is what makes some Americans willing to take risks in business, which can be good for the overall economy.”

There are two main types of bankruptcy for businesses. Some can stay in business under Chapter 11 while they reorganize their debts. Thus, unlike most bankruptcy systems around the world, US laws allow a bankrupt company to continue in operation, with the same management, while it tries to restructure its debts. In other words, typically, no trustee or custodian is appointed. Some people think this system, known as a debtor-in-possession system, promotes economic and job growth because more companies remain in business and their assets are protected. Businesses can also simply liquidate their assets under Chapter 7 and use the sale proceeds to pay creditors.

From http://usinfo.state.gov/journals/ites/0106/ijee/martin.htm


'''One confident risk-taker'''&lt;br&gt;
“Looking back at some of the earlier times I can’t believe we stayed in business. There have been several moments when we looked at each other and said is enough enough?...We have failed 5 million times! We have made many mistakes such as having inventory stolen, using the wrong glass for packaging, incorrect inventory counts, delivery trucks stolen, delivery trucks vandalized, and even our product formulas stolen from our offices.”

“We did not have any capital or a business plan. We did not have a marketing strategy. We did not have one damn thing. All I did was get on the phone and convince people that we were going to be a huge beverage company one day so why don’t you sell me the resources I need. Give two guys that have absolutely no credit, the credit to buy 200,000 cases of glass—and I did it. Nobody in their right mind would think they could do that.”

Tom First, Co-founder of Nantucket Nectars. From “Keynote Entrepreneurs – Nantucket Nectars,” http://www.benlore.com.


'''The entrepreneurial passion'''&lt;br&gt;
“My first real job was at a business that I started at boarding school when I was 16. At that time, the Vietnam War was going on and the Paris student uprising had just occurred. I felt that school was a place where grown-ups were just trying to keep us busy. I decided to start a magazine that would address some of those issues. I didn’t even have a phone, so I used a public telephone at school to sell advertising for my magazine. Over a six-month period, I managed to raise about $6,000, which was enough to cover the cost of printing and paper, so I decided to leave school to start the magazine. Being a precocious, overly enthusiastic young boy, I managed to get a lot of big celebrities—James Baldwin, Vanessa Redgrave, Jean-Paul Sartre—to write or be interviewed for the magazine....

I started the magazine because I had a passion for what I was doing. That’s also why I went into the airline business, even though everybody I talked to told me that there was no money to be made there. I felt that I could make a difference. That’s the best reason to go into business—because you feel strongly that you can change things.”

Richard Branson, Chairman of the Virgin Group. From “Training to Work: Unit of One,” by Jill Rosenfeld. Fast Company, August, 2000.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''What Makes It a Company?''' ==
 
Building a company is an experience that varies widely, depending on the nature of the product or service. If you’re a student, your company may share some of the challenges encountered by other student organizations. This section describes some coming-together experiences of companies, both student and non-student. 
 
'''Two E-Teams'''&lt;br&gt;
The NCIIA supports the development of E-Teams—teams of faculty and students working to move an invention or innovation from creative idea to commercial venture. To illustrate some of the key factors in creating a successful business from a bare-bones idea, and how a company’s attributes can change as the company grows, we’ll look at two E-Team-based companies: the 2Cam Rock Anchor team, led by Seth Murray, and the Guardian 2000 team, led by Steven Rhodes. 

These teams each originated in a class or program at their universities. Once the initial framework for the product was set for the class exercises, the teams began to evolve into serious, revenue-seeking ventures. 

'''Being a student'''&lt;br&gt; 
“Being students has really helped us through the project,” claims Seth Murray. Both Murray and Guardian 2000’s Steven Rhodes said that access to campus facilities was key to their success. Both teams worked with specially trained faculty, used campus labs and machines, and could choose from a field of students with a broad range of backgrounds and talents. (Note: intellectual property rights vary from school to school, so make sure you’re clear on your school’s policies before you get started.) 
 
'''Transition can be tough'''&lt;br&gt;
The two teams agree that the transition from a student-run activity to a real-world business is difficult. Some institutions, like the University of Colorado at Boulder, have an entrepreneurship program that helps students find angel investors—affluent individuals who provide capital for a start-up, usually in exchange for ownership equity. But Rhodes points out that one of the more realistic challenges of the transition is that some of the students working on the project need paying, full-time jobs, and although the experience of working in an E-Team is unmatched, not everyone can afford to dedicate themselves full-time. 

'''Team effort'''&lt;br&gt;
A startup is a team effort. Hopefully you’re working with a group of people of diverse backgrounds and training. Initially, it’s likely that people on your team will share responsibilities. Starting out is a great time for team members to get familiar with all aspects of the business, and manage it together. 
 
'''Lonely at the top'''&lt;br&gt; 
At some point—and you’ll know it when you reach it—the one-big-happy-team won’t be the best organizational model for your company. Someone needs to take charge and lead the pack. Steven Rhodes looked for a natural leader with motivating qualities, someone who wasn’t afraid to take on responsibility. Sometimes, leaders are chosen from the original team, but sometimes the right match comes from the outside. 

The best leader may just need strong business experience. Or she may need to both reflect and complement the skills of the rest of the team. It’s crucial for the team to carefully determine what it needs in a leader. 
 
'''Communication'''&lt;br&gt; 
Another essential component of your startup days is communication. This may seem obvious, but it can’t be overemphasized. The idea people and the action people need to work consistently to keep communication lines open. Rhodes encourages everyone on his team to remain in contact through email so that problems get immediate solutions, and don’t build up until they’re unmanageable. 
 
'''Advisors and mentors'''&lt;br&gt; 
Mentoring plays a huge role in any young company. Faculty advisors or outside mentors can speak from experience on manufacturing, marketing, and other key issues. Rhodes says of his advisor, “He has allowed the group to remain independent and learn from our mistakes. If he senses anything catastrophic is going to happen, he’ll step in, but it has been a big plus to have someone who lets the group learn and grow on their own.”

'''So what makes an innovative company?'''&lt;br&gt; 
In summer of 2006, Boston Consulting Group released its annual Innovation study, in which they determined that innovation remains a top strategic focus for many companies: 72% of the 1,070 executives in sixty-three countries ranked it a top-three strategic priority. Furthermore, they demonstrated that innovation translates into superior long-term stock market performance: the twenty-five most innovative companies had a median annualized return of 14.3% from 1996 through 2005, a full 300 basis points better than that the S&amp;P Global 1200 median. 

How do they do it? All of the innovative companies (Apple, Google, and Toyota among them) share one trait: they focus on their employees, their customers, and the people who constitute the market in which they operate. They realize that innovation comes from people, that these people need to be supported, and that everyone with an idea should be heard. They encourage creativity and free-thinking, even if it means that company employees will wander down the wrong path now and again. After all, the harsh reality is that experience is the greatest teacher, and learning from mistakes is a heck of a lot better than not learning at all. 


'''The entrepreneurial passion'''&lt;br&gt; 
“My first real job was at a business that I started at boarding school when I was 16. At that time, the Vietnam War was going on and the Paris student uprising had just occurred. I felt that school was a place where grown-ups were just trying to keep us busy. I decided to start a magazine that would address some of those issues. I didn’t even have a phone, so I used a public telephone at school to sell advertising for my magazine. Over a six-month period, I managed to raise about $6,000, which was enough to cover the cost of printing and paper, so I decided to leave school to start the magazine. Being a precocious, overly enthusiastic young boy, I managed to get a lot of big celebrities—James Baldwin, Vanessa Redgrave, Jean-Paul Sartre—to write or be interviewed for the magazine.... 

I started the magazine because I had a passion for what I was doing. That’s also why I went into the airline business, even though everybody I talked to told me that there was no money to be made there. I felt that I could make a difference. That’s the best reason to go into business—because you feel strongly that you can change things.” 

Richard Branson, Chairman of the Virgin Group. From “Training to Work: Unit of One,” by Jill Rosenfeld. Fast Company, August, 2000.  


'''Comfortable work cultures'''&lt;br&gt; 
“I think it’s incumbent upon business leaders to honor such [emotional and relational] needs by creating work cultures that are caring and frank, and that encourage people to grow both emotionally and socially—if only because such cultures create employee loyalty and increase productivity. Work should be a place of community, where people can be honest and genuine in their interactions. If you want people to care about carrying out your company’s mission, create a workplace that cares about them through policies as well as through relationships.” 

Nathan Baxter, Dean, Chief Priest, CEO of Washington National Cathedral. From “Training to Work: Unit of One,” by Jill Rosenfeld. Fast Company, August, 2000.

'''Be frugal'''&lt;br&gt; 
One of the hardest-hitting errors of startups is that when people get overconfident, they spend their capital on luxuries that they could have done without. When your company is young and there is no revenue coming in, the burn rate of your capital can break you. Even seemingly essential expenses like office space and advertising can suck your funds into a black hole. After working hard to raise your capital, don’t blow it on unnecessary stuff. 

Keeping your company lean is one of the hardest, but wisest, things you can do. Plan for long-term success. Stay focused on your initial product or service. Almost anyone who has made the mistake of growing a company too fast will tell you that it can be an expensive lesson to learn. 
 
'''Hire wisely'''&lt;br&gt; 
Running your business frugally also means hiring just the right number (and just the right kind) of people to do the work at hand. Analyze your product or service and where it’s going, and decide who the key people are. You may need engineers, you may need customer service reps, or you may need finance managers. 

When hiring anyone who will hold a position of leadership in your company, analyze how well they know the culture of your business, their connections to funding, and whether they have the personal chemistry to attract other employees to work with them. It’s also important to find someone with the entrepreneurial passion that will keep them loyal from a bare-bones startup to a successful company. 

Another thing to realize is that, as an entrepreneur, you are essentially a jack of all trades: you take part in every aspect of the business, but are the master of no single aspect of the business. As your company grows, you want to professionalize and enhance company expertise by finding people who are better at certain tasks than you are: a marketing expert, perhaps, or a financial manager, office manager, etc. 
 
'''Hire higher'''&lt;br&gt; 
Many times, entrepreneurs who bring an idea to life stay on as the company’s president or CEO, and hire to fill in other roles. But there are occasions when the entrepreneur either doesn’t want to or admittedly can’t handle the responsibilities of being an officer. It’s good to know your limits. 

Hiring your boss can be a great experience. How often do you get to be responsible for hand-selecting who you’re going to work for? You get to decide what qualities make a great officer, and better yet, who has those qualities. Consider a person’s attitude, their experience in a related field or market, what kind of business philosophy they have, and any other special skills or qualities they can bring to the table. 

Frank Hertz, VP of Operations at Massachusetts-based Newmediary, Inc., talks about hiring your own boss: 

“First things first, you have to recognize that you do indeed need a boss. Many entrepreneurs think they can be a CEO right away, and, while some can, others need to realize the combination of honed and practiced skill and years of experience in a CEO goes a long way. Whether it’s raising funding, making tough staffing and strategic decisions, or dealing with a Board of Directors, an experienced CEO is an extraordinarily huge factor in a successful business venture. Your product could be best-of-breed, but if you don’t have someone who knows how to grow and run a business, you could fail, and fail quickly.”

“We’re huge believers in $38 folding tables from Wal-Mart. If you’re working on a $38 table, that frugality tends to pervade every decision you make. That’s a lot different from some of the flashier dotcoms that bought billboards on buses. We’re focused on making every dollar count…&quot;
 
One positive we’ve learned from the dotcom era is the importance of partnerships—and of choosing your partners well. In a small business, the most important decisions you make are the things you decide not to do. So find what you’re good at, and recognize where your weaknesses are. Then bring on an appropriate partner who can fill in the gap.”
  
Laura Rippy, CEO, Handango. From “Dots Dashed: Unit of One,” by Lucy McCauley and Christine Canabou. Fast Company, February, 2001.


'''Hiring your boss'''&lt;br&gt; 
Like most entrepreneurs, Bobby John and Aziz Hurzook wore many hats when they launched their venture, Caught in the Web, Inc. John was president, VP of technology and VP of sales at the Toronto-based web design firm, while Hurzook was CEO, CFO and creative director. Although they had grown the firm to seventy employees and sold their services to a who’s who of corporate Canada, they wanted their company to reach the next level—and figured they weren’t the right people to take it there. Solution: they replaced themselves, stepping into smaller roles and hiring their own boss.  

Enter Pete Jones, then forty-seven, and who had just spent seven years as president of Apple Canada. A member of Caught’s advisory board knew Jones and suggested him for the job. So began the key step in hiring your boss: ensuring the candidate is right for your company—and for you. 

Despite Jones’ track record, the founders had many concerns. “I was very apprehensive,” says John. “I was going to give up my baby to him.” Caught in the Web would soon have 100 staff—could Jones manage a company that size? Could he execute an initial public offering? How would he handle things if business went sour? “I was really trying to figure out if Pete got it,” says John. 

To make sure of the fit, John and Jones met every day for a week. It was part interview, part courtship. They discussed each other’s lives, interests, and values. “Because it was a referral at both ends, you started off with a lot of trust,” says John. Hurzook joined in after a few days. In late March 2000, he was appointed Caught in the Web’s president and CEO. As the new heads of marketing and Web creation, respectively, John and Hurzook were reporting to somebody for the first time. 

Jones moved quickly. He wandered around, making sure he was visible. “It would be the kiss of death to just stay in your office and send out memos,” he says. He implemented a dedicated space plan that, while better suited to an organization of Caught’s size, clashed with the established disorder that let staff work where they liked. He even tackled layoffs in the deflating Net bubble of 2000. The founders were relieved they could just watch.

      <comment>/* For Profit or Not? */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''For Profit or Not?''' ==
 
As you learned earlier, a social entrepreneur is an innovator seeking social benefits. But the story doesn’t end there. Social entrepreneurs can be found in the for-profit and non-profit sectors. Non-profits have traditionally been tasked, along with government, with providing public benefit. But an increasing number of for-profit companies are also tackling social and environmental issues. If your innovative spirit, business skills and social values align, you may wonder whether you should run a non-profit or for-profit organization.  
 
'''Non-profit doesn’t mean “no profit”'''&lt;br&gt; 
If your business serves a cause or does a public good, it can earn a profit and still be a non-profit organization. The US government rewards some organizations that perform services to the community by letting them operate tax-free. This is to recognize the fact that the government itself would have to spend more money to tackle social problems without the help of these groups. Many charitable groups rely solely on donations for funding, and pay no taxes on the money they take in. However, groups that want to fund their cause by selling items or providing services for a fee can make profits (i.e., “earned income”), benefit from this tax status, and call themselves non-profits, too. Non-profit groups with earned income strategies often refer to their money-making activities as “social ventures” and to their founders as “social entrepreneurs.” 
 
'''Money to the mission'''&lt;br&gt; 
“Non-profit” is short for “not-for-profit,” meaning that money earned (through any means) is reinvested towards a mission. This contrasts with for-profit companies which divide income, after expenses, among owners or shareholders. In a good year, the owners of a for-profit company get richer, while a non-profit has more resources to devote to its cause. Non-profits are considered to be owned by the public, and cannot be used for the personal gain of individuals. 

The most common type of charitable organization is a “501(c)3,” as identified by the IRS. Companies that meet this classification are exempt from state and federal income, sales, and property taxes. However, they must have a clearly defined mission from which they operate. All income must be generated in a way that relates to the mission, and after expenses, must be devoted to that mission. This prevents charities from using their tax-free status to compete with other merchants who have higher expenses due to taxes.  501(c)3 organizations cannot support political causes as part of their operation.  

A non-profit must have a board of directors. As with for-profit companies, which maintain boards to insure that management acts according to shareholder interests, non-profit boards insure that management works in the best interest of the targeted community. 
 
'''Profit and mission'''&lt;br&gt; 
You can incorporate socially beneficial elements into your company, but still run it as a for-profit. This allows you to use profits to motivate owners, financers, and employees (through stock options) and have market discipline while keeping a strong focus on mission-related results. You can consider yourself a for-profit, socially responsible business, or a for-profit social venture. If you want to focus on your ideals, articulate them in your corporate mission statement and find ways to measure progress beyond financial statements. See the Plan section for ideas.  
 
'''Other considerations'''&lt;br&gt; 
Now that you know how  the IRS defines for-profit and non-profit companies, consider other factors besides tax benefits to decide where your company fits. In their paper “Blurring Sector Boundaries: Serving Social Purposes through For-Profit Structures,” J. Gregory Dees and Beth B. Anderson at The Fuqua School of Business of Duke University consider the following: 
 
* Public view of organization/mission 
* Availability of financing 
* Incentives for employees and owners 
* Ability to stick with mission 
* Market discipline 
   
The non-profit sector has a reputation for being mission-oriented—having this status makes the organizational focus more believable to the public. Their inability to reward owners, employees, and financiers with financial returns tied to performance may restrict sources of money and people, but removes the temptation to sacrifice the cause for higher profits. 

Economists believe that a well-functioning market is the best way to determine the value of an entity. For-profit companies issue stocks that are publicly traded, which enables their worth to be determined by the stock price. The stock price represents the investors’ appraisal of the future value of the company’s profits. Fluctuations send a signal to managers that the market thinks they’re making good or bad decisions. This feedback is termed market discipline. Arguably because investments in for-profit entities can be publicly traded, they must be more attentive to their owners and the signals in the market. Some see a disadvantage in the fact that non-profits cannot get these signals as efficiently from the stakeholders that “own” them.

'''Board basics: Overview of a nonprofit board'''&lt;br&gt;  
The function of your board of directors depends on the size and goals of the organization. The larger your organization and the greater your support staff, the less “hands-on” the board will be. On the other hand, directors or trustees of smaller organizations may, by necessity, find themselves more involved in day-to-day operations. Basic board responsibilities include:
   
* Determining the organization’s mission and purpose 
* Selecting the chief executive 
* Supporting the chief executive and assessing his or her performance 
* Ensuring effective organizational planning 
* Ensuring adequate resources 
* Managing resources effectively 
* Determining and monitoring the organization’s programs and services 
* Enhancing the organization’s public image 
* Ensuring legal and ethical integrity and maintaining accountability 
* Recruiting new board members and assessing the board’s own performance

'''Starting a non-profit'''&lt;br&gt; 
Here are three major areas of concern when starting a non-profit: 

Staff&lt;br&gt; 
Someone has to do the work. Do you need a staff? Can you pay a staff? Can you retain volunteers? You need workers for two general responsibilities: administrative and service. Administrative workers run the organization, raise funds, manage budgets, and handle business operations. Service workers are responsible for the mission of the organization, for accomplishing the purpose for which the nonprofit was formed. In small nonprofits, one staff member may do it all. This is where volunteers become critical to the success of the nonprofit.  

Budget&lt;br&gt; 
Do you have a budget? Where will funding come from? Nonprofits can earn income through program and service fees, but raising funds is usually an essential activity. Fundraising is simply the result of matching a compelling cause or need with a philanthropically minded individual, organization, or company. Philanthropy is a massive industry in the United States. The key to successful fundraising is, quite simply, asking. It may seem strange, but most people fear talking about or asking for money. Do not wait for donors to come to you. Ask and ye shall receive.  

Partnering&lt;br&gt;
If you don’t receive enough funding to provide for all of your operational and service needs, consider partnering with a similar organization. A trend in the nonprofit industry is sharing resources that many nonprofits need: office space, administrative tasks, fundraising and other tasks that do not require a full-time employee. You may be able to partner with an organization that could use the services you provide within the scope of their larger mission. Research your local nonprofit community to determine if a similar organization exists and if your services would complement their mission.

      <comment>/* Legal Structures */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Legal Structures''' ==
 
'''Know your options'''&lt;br&gt; 
Before you start your own company, consider legal variables, like how many shareholders you will have, or what kind of taxes you will pay. Companies in the US have a variety of legal, financial, and ownership attributes. The US legal structure encourages company ownership, and knowing what kind of company is best suited to your needs is crucial to both short and long-term success. 
 
'''Finding a good lawyer'''&lt;br&gt; 
What makes a lawyer “good”? No, this isn’t a lawyer joke. Any lawyer can incorporate your company, but you want someone who is both seasoned and well-versed in business law, and has a good track record when it comes to dealing with business issues. So ask around, do your research, and take the time to sort through your options. 
 
'''Why do I need a lawyer, anyway?'''&lt;br&gt; 
Lawyers know what paperwork to file, when to file it, and how. They know how to negotiate and draft business agreements. They know how to protect your company so all your hard work won’t be lost. It’s worth the money to appoint a good corporate counsel. A lawyer can also help you decide what type of business to form. 
 
'''Types of corporation'''&lt;br&gt; 
Corporations come in four main categories: Sole Proprietorship, Partnership, Corporation, and Limited Liability. Ownership, liability, management, tax treatment, and source of capital are all factors to consider when choosing your structure. 
 
'''Sole Proprietorship'''&lt;br&gt;  
In a Sole Proprietorship company, you and you alone are the owner. This makes you responsible for providing all capital, and also makes you personally liable for any of the company’s debts. Income and losses are passed from the company to you, so you are taxed, not the company. You have full control of all management decisions and responsibilities. 
 
'''Partnerships'''&lt;br&gt; 
General Partnership companies are owned by two or more partners. Like proprietorships, the owners are responsible for the entire company. Partners are personally liable for the company’s finances, credit, and debts. The company is not taxed because profits and losses are passed through and claimed by the partners, not the company. The partners share management equally, unless otherwise stated. The capital is contributed by the partners. 

Limited Partnership works like General Partnership except that some members become limited partners. Unless you’re in real estate or another limited lifespan business, this model probably won’t apply to you. An example of a limited partnership is a venture capital fund, which typically has a seven to ten year lifespan. 
 
'''Corporations'''&lt;br&gt; 
S Corporations have many of the advantages of partnerships. They can have many shareholders, but generally don’t expect to make a lot of money. They can’t accept institutional investments—only money from individuals, such as friends and family. Income and losses are passed through to the shareholders, so the corporate entity is not taxed. This special tax status limits the number of shareholders to seventy-five, and restricts the class of stock. 

C Corporation is the model used by nearly all big companies. A C corp exists separately from its owners. While the shareholders are the primary financial contributors, they are not liable for the corporation’s debts. The corporation, rather than the shareholders, is taxed. The shareholders elect a board of directors to manage the company, and officers to oversee day-to-day decisions. A C corps’ profits are taxed twice—to the company and to the individual shareholders. 
 
'''Limited Liability Companies'''&lt;br&gt; 
Limited Liability Companies (LLCs) are neither partnerships nor corporations. Members are not personally liable for the company’s finances, credits, or debt. The company is not taxed because profits and losses are passed through and claimed by the members, not the company. An operating agreement outlines management structure. Members generally contribute capital. 

The LLC model is complex and relatively costly. It’s often used for consulting companies, and is increasingly used by entrepreneurial companies. Angel investors may prefer an LLC. More sophisticated and institutional investors are likely to favor a C Corp, because of its straightforward, transparent structure.

| 

'''Choose a lawyer carefully'''&lt;br&gt; 
Get a personal reference from someone you trust before you retain a lawyer. Many websites offer help finding lawyers, but use caution when trusting a website. Make sure the source is reputable. 

It’s also important for you to know what to look for. You want a lawyer who:
  
* Is ethical 
* Knows the field and is familiar with related patents 
* Is accomplished with a good track record 
* Knows and understands what the Patent Examiner wants and needs to approve your application 
* Understands the language of the field to give you the most complete and broad protection you deserve  
  
Many colleges and universities have some sort of legal services program for students. See if your school does, and start there. They can give you some tips and likely some names of local lawyers who specialize in business or intellectual property law. 


'''Questions for a prospective lawyer'''&lt;br&gt; 
Once you get a list of candidates, consider putting these questions to your potential lawyers when you have them on the phone:
	 
* How long have you been in practice? 
* How much experience do you have? 
* Is this a standard issue with a basic fee or more complex with an hourly fee? 
* Is there a fee for the initial consultation?   

Review the answers from each phone interview. Make an appointment with a lawyer who can deal with your legal issue in a timely matter, has an interest in your business, and makes you feel comfortable. 

   
'''Patent agent vs. patent lawyer'''&lt;br&gt; 
The US Patent and Trademark Office sets forth requirements for individuals who will represent it. However, because of these requirements in legal, scientific, and technical fields, there is a shortage of lawyers who are qualified to represent. To make up for this gap in the demand of representatives, the office allows “any citizen of the United States, who is not an attorney, and who fulfills the requirements…to be registered as a patent agent to practice before the office.” However, patent agents are limited in their roles—they are not allowed to practice law, but they are perfect for helping an applicant through the process. 

“Academic institutions are sending work to patent agents in solo practice. The sole practitioner, on average, charges lower fees than a larger firm and provides more personalized service. For the startup Corporation or an institution on a tight budget, using the services of a patent agent in solo practice may be a plausible solution.” 
  
From “The Role of the Patent Agent in the Patent Process” by Joy Bryant. Cafezine, January 1, 1999.

      <comment>/* A Failure Success Story: John Fabel */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''A Failure Success Story: John Fabel''' ==
 
The story of John Fabel teaches us that when it comes to entrepreneurial endeavors, failure isn’t always a bad thing: new opportunities arise, lessons are learned, people move forward. In this profile we take you through John’s story, from invention to incorporation to bankruptcy to eventual success, and find out what he learned along the way. 

'''Suspension bridges and backpacks'''&lt;br&gt; 
After long hours of cross-country skiing, Fabel, an outdoor enthusiast, noticed that his backpack bruised his shoulders. A lifelong designer and inventor with a knack for looking at things differently, Fabel began to wonder if he could create a better, less taxing backpack. 

While marveling at the suspension bridges on a trip to New York City, he found the answer. 

“When I used a hip belt to transfer the backpack’s weight to my hips, I still got sore shoulders. So the problem wasn’t the shoulder straps. The problem was how the weight wanted to fall back, away from your body. So I started thinking, ‘What if I could design a backpack that would get the weight to pull toward your back rather than away from it?’”  

“After I saw the Brooklyn Bridge, I started thinking about how to build a hip pack that would distribute the weight evenly, like a suspension bridge.” 
 
In a suspension bridge, huge main cables extending from one end to the other hold up the roadway. The cables rest on top of towers and are secured at each end by anchorages. Instead of relying on shoulder straps to carry the load, Fabel designed a backpack that transfers much of the weight to the hips. When wearing it, your hips act like a tower on a suspension bridge, the backpack is similar to the roadway, and the triangular flap between the backpack and the hip belt—like the cables on the bridge—distributes the weight evenly. 

Fabel called the invention BioSpan, patented it, and in 1993 began work in earnest on a company built around the technology, EcoTrek. 

'''I don’t care if it’s made from uranium, I want one'''&lt;br&gt; 
Fabel went through the standard steps in creating EcoTrek: he performed a feasibility study, formed a management team, put together a business plan, did research and development, created a core line of products, found a manufacturing partner, and secured seed financing. By the time he was starting EcoTrek, Fabel had for years been interested in environmental sustainability, and he designed EcoTrek’s product line accordingly: the equipment was made from 85% recycled materials (the fabric was made from soda bottles, the buckles from recycled industrial nylon, etc.), and the products were made to be recycled themselves, designed for disassembly in such a way that everything could be broken down into individual parts in about three steps. This “green” approach, Fabel reasoned, would surely resonate with backpackers and outdoor enthusiasts. “The products were designed for use in the environment by people who love being in the environment,” said Fabel.  “So our idea was, ‘Let’s make our products both fun and coherent within that larger notion.’”

Fabel received plenty of positive feedback. EcoTrek was featured in several prominent publications, environmentalists were happy there was a green alternative in outdoor equipment, and people truly enjoyed wearing the BioSpan backpack. Once, when Fabel was hiking with Everest IMAX film creator David Breashears, he asked David how he liked the backpack and if he appreciated that it was made from 85% recycled materials. “I don’t care if it’s made from uranium,” Breashears said. “I want one.” 

Because Fabel put the green aspect of EcoTrek first, he decided to go forward with an unusual marketing strategy for outdoor equipment: direct marketing. “It’s very difficult to market green products in that, in the retail environment where most outdoor equipment is sold, it’s very hard to communicate the green attributes,” said Fabel. “More customer education than usual needs to take place, and the retail environment doesn’t lend itself very well to that. So we made the decision to concentrate on direct marketing because we thought we would be able to much more powerfully communicate our green values to our target customers.” 

“But unless you hit your target, it’s very expensive.” 
 
'''Misfire'''&lt;br&gt; 
EcoTrek’s sales flopped the first time out. According to Fabel, this happened for several reasons: “Number one, people don’t buy backpacks through the mail. Oops! Second, we misjudged the greenness of the outdoor market. It’s no greener than any other market. Although they may appreciate the green values more, it’s still a tertiary value: performance comes first. We had our message exactly wrong.”  

The team shifted to a retail strategy and immediately started gaining traction, going through three rounds of manufacturing with still more orders to fill. “We couldn’t make them fast enough,” said Fabel. But by that time they were out of money. “We had so much debt load, we didn’t have the resources to adequately pull off the retail marketing strategy even though we were getting signs that everything was turning around. We were constantly scrabbling behind. Combined with insufficient startup capital, our failed initial marketing strategy cost us the company. The initial marketing strategy was fundamentally flawed because when you put on the BioSpan backpack, you ‘get it’ in a very visceral way: people almost inevitably smile when they put it on. Yet we initially had a marketing strategy that took that experience totally out of the loop.” 

“When we closed the company down we had orders we couldn’t fill because we didn’t have the money to manufacture them.” 

'''The quick rebound'''&lt;br&gt; 
Despite EcoTrek’s failure it was clear Fabel had something in BioSpan. About a month after he put the company down Fabel got a phone call from Marmot, a leader in the outdoor equipment industry. Said Fabel, “Every time Marmot introduces a new product line they want a flagship innovation that strengthens their brand image of being innovators. They saw BioSpan as a technology that fit within their brand image.” Marmot hired Fabel to build a backpack line around BioSpan, and because he had developed the technology and still owned the patent rights, he licensed the patent to the company. The line of products exceeded Marmot’s expectations, with one of the backpacks earnings the highest ratings in its category.
  
So EcoTrek certainly wasn’t a total loss. “A lot of the value of the BioSpan product concept was developed through the work of EcoTrek,” said Fabel. “Even though EcoTrek itself wasn’t successful, the idea was. It had some very successful outcomes.”

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Chemical Attraction: Griffin Analytical''' ==
 
'''Griffin’s success'''&lt;br&gt;
How do you take a high-tech prototype developed in a university lab and build a successful company around it? What are the steps? If experience is a teacher, we can take the story of Garth Patterson and his company, Griffin Analytical Technologies, as a rough blueprint. 

'''Beginnings'''&lt;br&gt; 
In 2001, Patterson was enrolled at Purdue University, working toward his PhD in analytical chemistry with a specialization in mass spectrometry (a method of identifying the chemical makeup of a substance by means of the separation of gaseous ions according to their differing mass and charge). Purdue researchers, Patterson among them, were developing a prototype of an improved mass spectrometer that was smaller, cheaper, and better than the existing systems. By using cylinders as the chemical analyzer, the device was made easy to miniaturize, thereby taking up less lab space, costing less, and making the device more sensitive and more accurate. 

With the market for chemical detection instrumentation estimated at $1-1.5 billion—and growing, due to homeland security concerns—Patterson knew there was an opportunity. To take advantage of it, he and a colleague, Dennis Barket, enrolled in Purdue’s Innovation Realization Lab, whose main task, according to Patterson, is “linking technology students with MBAs to affect a hands-on learning experience for both sides.” Two graduate MBAs joined Patterson and Barket, and then two advisors from analytical chemistry and business came on board—and suddenly the E-Team was formed.  

Success followed. The team won NCIIA Advanced E-Team funding to continue developing a prototype, wrote a business plan, and won three of the four major business plan competitions they entered, earning $35,000 in funding. The team was successful in the competitions because, Patterson said, “Firstly, our product and our business idea were robust. Secondly, the plan itself was thorough and thoughtful. Everyone intends to be thoughtful, but we put a lot of effort into backing up our claims and putting as much legitimate research into it as we could get.” 

More money came in: the team was awarded funding from the Purdue Research Foundation’s Trask Fund; they completed one Phase I SBIR contract with the Army and started an EPA Phase I SBIR contract; they acquired private funding, and negotiated an exclusive license from Purdue for the mass spectrometry technology.  

In November 2001, Patterson and Barket defended their PhDs, and later that month they incorporated, calling the company Griffin Analytical Technologies. Their work had just begun. 

'''Making the company work'''&lt;br&gt;
First the E-Team changed: they lost the MBAs, Enrique Vazquez and Jeff Scott. “Enrique and Jeff didn’t come along with us for personal reasons—primarily geographic,” said Patterson. “Neither of them was from the Midwest. Had we started the company on the west coast I think things would’ve been different, but Dennis and I wanted to stay in Purdue, as the university has one of the world’s best analytical chemistry departments.” 

'''Human resources'''&lt;br&gt; 
Hiring decisions suddenly came to the forefront. Who would they go after now? “One of the hardest parts of going from an E-Team to a company, said Patterson, “was knowing what resources we needed to bring in early on—do we need an engineer first? A finance person? It was hard to know what resources to use where, and when.” 

Patterson and Barket decided to hire two chemists from Purdue, people they knew and got along with. But then the company was too “chemist-heavy,” and they still needed technical work done before they could have a sellable product. “We needed to get past the remaining technical hurdles,” said Patterson, “so the next thing we decided to do was concentrate our efforts on the technology, and put together a product development team: electrical engineers, software developers, mechanical engineers, manufacturing specialists, etc. The instrument we were developing is relatively complex; we knew we needed people who had insight into all those aspects of design.”  

Then there was the matter of deciding who would be president. In the case of Griffin, this wasn’t a hard decision: it would be Dennis Barket, with Patterson taking on the title of VP of Research and Development. Why Barket and not Patterson? Back when they were students, the two enrolled in an intensive, two-week mini-MBA for science and technology PhDs, called Applied Management Principles (AMP), at Purdue’s business school. According to Patterson, “Coming out of the program Dennis had a pretty good understanding of the vocabulary involved in business and leadership: he gravitated toward it. And I certainly had an understanding of the technology because it’s based on my PhD research, so making Dennis president and myself vice president of R&amp;D came about naturally.” 

'''Steps toward success'''&lt;br&gt; 
They must have gotten something right, as the good news kept rolling in: they won a Phase II SBIR contract from the Army; their innovative technology was featured in several prominent science journals; they won a Phase III contract from the Marines, and in late 2003 they closed on a round of funding that brought in $2.4 million.  

What’s the key to Griffin’s future? According to Patterson, communication. “There’s more work than could possibly be done. What we’re doing is working as a group, communicating effectively, identifying what to work on, what’s most important. It’s absolutely necessary to be on the same page with everyone so that we can divide and conquer, focus on the goals, simply so that we can get through the sheer mass of work and end up producing quality work, a quality product. That’s our aim.”

      <comment>/* Bootstrapping */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Bootstrapping''' ==
 
'''What is it?'''&lt;br&gt; 
Bootstrapping is funding a new business with a minimum of outside investment. Ideally, everyone would like to start their new venture with a solid and reliable supply of money, preferably obtained by winning the lottery or inheriting a vast sum from a previously unknown relative. The reality is that many people (if not the majority of people) start their businesses with nothing. No savings, no big gifts from relatives, and no lucky breaks. This is bootstrapping. 

By definition, bootstrapping involves running your start-up as cheaply and efficiently as possible, constantly finding ways to minimize your expenditures and squeezing the most out of what you have. Bootstrapping is hard work, but it’s good for your business. It teaches you valuable lessons about how to run the business on a shoestring budget, preparing you to make good financial decisions in the future. 
 
'''Bootstrapping tips that work'''&lt;br&gt; 
University of Maryland business professor Andrew J. Sherman offers ten proven tips for bootstrapping a business: 
 
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wear multiple hats in managing your business to save personnel costs.&lt;/li&gt;  
&lt;li&gt;Buy or lease used furniture and equipment, and don’t overpay for unnecessary service warranties.&lt;/li&gt;  
&lt;li&gt;Share office space with (or sublease from) a large company that will offer you access to conference rooms, office equipment, reception, or administrative services.&lt;/li&gt;  
&lt;li&gt;Apply for several credit cards at once, and use the available portions as your operating line of credit.&lt;/li&gt;  
&lt;li&gt;Hire student interns willing to forego a salary in exchange for work experience. Better yet, hire a retired executive or family member who may be willing to help out just to stay busy or serve as a mentor. A wonderful resource for this is the Small Business Administration’s SCORE (Service Core of Retired Executives) program.&lt;/li&gt;  
&lt;li&gt;Work hard to maintain excellent customer relationships to encourage or require early payment.&lt;/li&gt;  
&lt;li&gt;Commit only to short-term leases and other obligations to maintain maximum flexibility and cost controls.&lt;/li&gt;  
&lt;li&gt;Ask major clients to purchase the key equipment that you’ll need to service their account and then lease it back from them.&lt;/li&gt;  
&lt;li&gt;Offer shares in your company to vendors, landlords and key employees in lieu of cash, subject to federal and state securities law and acceptable dilution ratios. (Sam Walton used this tactic when starting Wal-Mart, and his former secretaries and office workers are now multi-millionaires!)&lt;/li&gt;  
&lt;li&gt;Join a commercial barter exchange and use it to acquire key products and services. In some cities, even alternative currencies have emerged as a type of barter exchange and bootstrapping technique. These local currencies have stimulated economic development in small towns and rural areas that haven’t yet been affected by the regional gluts of 	venture capital or where commercial lending dollars aren’t flowing freely.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt; 
 
'''Stay focused'''&lt;br&gt; 
Bootstrapping isn’t easy. It requires discipline, diligence, and hard work. It’s unreasonable to expect everything to fall effortlessly into place. Be prepared for bumps in the road. No matter how tough things get, stay focused on the mission at hand: successfully starting your business. 
  
'''Find a mentor'''&lt;br&gt; 
Experience counts. As Sherman points out in tip number six, having a good, experienced mentor can be a boon to you and your venture. Entrepreneurship expert Jerry Mitchell says, “So much depends on the industry and your contacts in it. I believe very strongly in mentors. Mentors can advise you on the nontraditional methods in order to be successful within your targeted industry.” 

That’s just what happened to Luke Pinkerton and his Advanced E-Team, Polytorx. Pinkerton was looking to commercialize his product—a twisted fiber that, when mixed with concrete, creates extraordinarily strong, shock-resistant blocks—and attended an event hosted by a local non-profit organization supporting entrepreneurship. There he met veteran businessman Bill Orabone, who would not only become his angel investor and primary source of funding, but also an invaluable mentor. “Bill has been absolutely instrumental in showing me how to run a business,” says Pinkerton. He cites Orabone’s guidance in creating a focused business plan, ordering machinery for a low-cost manufacturing line, and securing raw materials for a sound supply strategy as essential to Polytorx’ success.

'''Bootstrap origins'''&lt;br&gt; 
The term &quot;bootstrapping&quot; comes from the German legend of Baron Munchhausen, in which he pulled himself out of the sea by pulling on his own bootstraps. The term has generally come to mean the use of a special process to perform a task that one would be unable to do otherwise. 

For this and other interesting boostrapping content, visit Guy Kawasaki's blog, How to Change the World at http://blog.guykawasaki.com/. 


'''Incremental growth'''&lt;br&gt; 
Small business expert Peter Hupalo defines bootstrapping as using whatever resources you have available to gradually build your company and reach your goal. He offers the following allegory: 

&quot;Imagine trying to get a whiffle ball out of a tree. You cannot reach it, so you toss another ball up there to knock it down. But now, the second ball is trapped up there also. You look around for something to stand on, and see a picnic table and benches. You bring one of the benches over. But it's not high enough. So you bring over the table. It's not high enough, either. Then you stack the bench on top of the table, and, voila, you can reach the balls. That's bootstrapping in a nutshell.&quot; 

From &quot;Thinking Like an Entrepreneur,&quot; by Peter Hupalo, 1999, http://www.thinkinglike.com 


'''It's good for you'''&lt;br&gt; 
When discussing his philosophy on bootstrapping, Greg Gianforte (who retired at the age of 33 after he and his partners sold their software business, Brightwork Development Inc., to McAfee Associates for more than $10 million) stated, &quot;A lot of entrepreneurs think they need money...when actually they haven't figured out the business equation.&quot; According to Gianforte, lack of money, employees, equipment, even lack of product, is actually a huge advantage because it forces the bootstrapper to concentrate on selling to bring cash into the business.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Finding the Money''' ==
 
'''Where do I find money?'''&lt;br&gt; 
As your parents have helpfully pointed out, it doesn’t grow on trees. But here are a few leaves you can turn over to find potential investors. 
 
'''Business plan competitions'''&lt;br&gt; 
Numerous colleges, universities and companies offer business plan competitions open to students from all institutions. Browse the Internet and check out entrepreneurship web sites for more resources. If your school runs a business plan competition, get involved. Not only do you get a chance to win some hard cash for your business, you have a motive to get your business plan written, and probably some guidelines to help you make it work. 
 
'''Venture forums'''&lt;br&gt; 
A venture forum is an educational program designed to help entrepreneurs at various stages of business development. One of the best-known examples is the MIT Enterprise Forum. The Forum has twenty-three chapters nationally and internationally and offers seminars and online publications. 

Search the Internet for more venture forums, or call your local Chamber of Commerce to find out what’s happening in your area. 
 
'''Venture fairs'''&lt;br&gt; 
Venture fairs have been around for years, but, according to David Freschman, President of the Delaware Innovation Fund and chairman of a venture fair known as Early Stage East, an increasing number of venture capital fairs are catering to early-stage businesses. These fairs are attended by individual angel investors, and early-stage venture capitalists. They help entrepreneurs increase the number of investors exposed to their companies, and compress the time frame for raising critical early-stage financing. 

Venues for pitching to investors at venture fairs include social receptions, display booths, meals where tables are clearly marked as “owned” by entrepreneurs (investors get to choose who they sit with), and formal presentations. 
 
'''Talk to your professors'''&lt;br&gt; 
Although academics aren’t known for having access to a boatload of cash, try talking to your professors. Some professors are in fact interested in investing in student projects. Others may have contacts in the business world and may be able to introduce you to potentially interested funders. 
 
'''Talk with alumni'''&lt;br&gt; 
Ask the alumni relations office for help in contacting people in your field. If your school has an entrepreneurship club, some of these contacts may already have been made. Even if you don’t find immediate funding through alumni, the contacts you make may lay fertile ground for the future. 
 
'''Your friends, your parents, your friends’ parents'''&lt;br&gt; 
Tell everyone what you’re up to. Getting the word out is key to getting what you need for funding. Let people know that you’re looking for funding resources, and make it clear what you’re expecting to give in return. People like to help people, and many people are natural connection-makers. The more you talk about your work and your funding needs, the greater the chances that you’ll stumble upon the right person. 

'''Grants'''&lt;br&gt; 
Grants are inexpensive: there is no interest charged, no need to pay it back, and you don’t give up any equity (more on equity in the next section). There are two popular government programs that give grants to high-tech companies: SBIR (Small Business Innovation Research Program) and STTR (Small Business Technology Transfer Program). These grants are distributed in two major phases, with the first providing up to $100K to pay for a proof of concept, and the second up to $1 million for prototype development. Solicitations are usually twice a year; many workshops around the country provide information on applying for the grants. (For a good explanation and more information on SBIR/STTR, visit their website.) 

A Cooperative Research &amp; Development Agreement (CRADA) is a grant in which a government lab works with a company to develop or test a particular technology/product. The government doesn’t provide any money to the company, but CRADAs can be an excellent way to obtain skills and equipment, and to test a product. For more information on CRADAs, see their website. 

And then of course there is the world of private grants. There are numerous foundations and other organizations around the country (including the NCIIA) that provide funds to technology entrepreneurs. Several websites are devoted to this topic—The Foundation Center  is a good starting place. Also, see below to start learning about what an NCIIA grant can do for you.

'''How one E-Team found the money'''&lt;br&gt; 
A recent E-Team success story comes from Huntington, West Virginia. Vandalia Research, Inc., founded by two Marshall University undergraduates and funded in part by NCIIA, is in the process of successfully commercializing technology for the mass production of DNA sequences. Team leader Derek Gregg on how they got through their initial seed round: 

&quot;We got all of our funding from local investors in Huntington. We worked on a business plan with a Marshall alum for about nine months, then took the plan to a community forum of about fifty angel investors. We were able to secure all of our funding in that one three-hour meeting! We were shooting for 500k in funding, actually, and ended up oversubscribing substantially.&quot; 

&quot;The first round money is going to be used primarily for renovations and equipment purchases to get the manufacturing facility up and running. We also hired our first full-time employee, a lab technician who will also head up the research end. We've started discussions with some local regional venture capital firms for our next round of funding. As far as long-term goals go, our business model is to use our technology to do custom, in-house DNA manufacturing for anyone who needs it.&quot;


'''About NCIIA Advanced E-Team grants'''&lt;br&gt;  
Advanced E-Team grants provide student teams with the support they need to bring an innovative product or technology from idea to prototype, and eventually to market. Successful E-Team grant proposals demonstrate an idea's technical feasibility, social value, and potential for commercialization. Advanced E-Team grants range in size from $1,000 to $20,000; the grant period is twelve to eighteen months. Annual application deadlines are in December and May. 

We favor Advanced E-Team grant proposals that:
 
* Show a strong likelihood of developing innovations with realistic, well-documented technological and commercial promise 
* Lead to the development of a product or technology designed for affordability, that directly benefits human health or the environment, or that follows a sustainable, socially motivated business model 
* Demonstrate knowledge of the market and evidence of consumer interest 
* Involve a balanced, multidisciplinary E-Team, including students, faculty, and advisors from technical, business, and humanities disciplines 
* Reflect the diversity of the home institution, and actively engage faculty and students from groups traditionally underrepresented in invention, innovation, and entrepreneurship, including women and minorities 
* Create opportunities for high-quality group learning experiences 
* Create viable collaborative opportunities for participants from both academe and industry 
* Incorporate a plan and a budget that are reasonable, achievable, and sustainable 
* Demonstrate strong team commitment and faculty and institutional support

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Debt and Equity''' ==
 
'''What’s the difference?'''&lt;br&gt; 
Let’s start by making the distinction between debt and equity. It’s pretty simple. Debt is an obligation, on the part of the company, the entrepreneur, or both. Over a certain period of time, the company is obligated to repay the debt, at a specified interest rate. 

Equity financing is the purchase of shares of stock in a company in return for money invested in the company. A company typically has no formal obligation to repay equity. You give your investor a piece of paper called a stock certificate. They give you money.  
Of course there’s a catch: the investor expects that at some point there will be a liquidation event. This means that at some point your company will be sold or go public. The investors will sell their stock, either to the new owners, or on the public stock exchanges—hopefully at a big profit either way. 

So, not only do you need to understand your company’s appetite for financing and the type of financing you need to get where you’re going, you also need to understand that the type of financing you secure will determine your business’ growth direction. 

Because equity investors are taking such a risk with no specific obligation of repayment, they are also going to expect—or perhaps demand—that the company take a route that will lead it to fast growth and a significant increase in its value over a relatively short period of time. Debt-holders on the other hand, be they banks or individuals, will pretty much stay out of the affairs of your business, as long as you’re making your loan payments and your periodic financial reports seem to be on target. 
 
'''Which does your company need?'''&lt;br&gt; 
Types and sources of debt vary widely, from simple loans from friends and family to complicated transactions dreamed up by Wall Street wizards. But it basically comes down to one thing—they give you the money, you pay it back. Of course, the miracle of compound interest is on their side. To feed this miracle, you need cash flow. You need some kind of revenue stream so you can repay the loan. Sometimes a lending source will get creative and give you a grace period during which no payments are required and interest accrues. But a rule of thumb—that certainly has a fair share of real life exceptions—is that a technology company that needs development time, and is expecting to grow rapidly, will neither be able to fulfill debt obligations nor secure enough money in the early stages from debt sources to fuel the company. 

Another rule: It’s when you don’t need the money that banks are happy to lend it to you. If your need is great, your ability to pay back probably isn’t so good, and then they’re less likely to lend to you. Technology growth companies typically have a different appetite. They’re hungry for equity. 
 
'''Some debt and equity pros and cons'''&lt;br&gt; 
Equity Pros&lt;br&gt; 
Investors share your viewpoint because they take the risk with you. They get their reward when you do—usually when the company is sold or goes public. If you need additional equity to grow, investors often have extensive contacts and can help. Investor cash can help attract top-notch management teams. 
 
Equity Cons&lt;br&gt; 
Founders give up a percentage of their companies’ ownership. Owners lose some control of their companies, and the outsiders even have a say over the founders’ salary. (Although this is not always bad, as giving up control can help keep you on your toes!) Companies can get into the “more where that came from” syndrome, always looking for investors but never making a profit. 
 
Debt Pros&lt;br&gt; 
There’s no dilution of ownership; original owners keep it all. As long as the debt payments are made, the original owners give up no operational control. The company turns a profit sooner because owners must make cash to serve the debt and have access to additional credit. 
 
Debt Cons&lt;br&gt; 
Not all companies have access to debt financing; lenders want collateral in land, equipment, or a patent. If the company doesn’t make payments, it loses everything. Growth is limited to internally generated cash flow, or additional credit based on the company’s profitability. Lenders want equity and convertible debt dilutes ownership.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Your Equity Circle''' ==
 
'''The fabulous Fs'''&lt;br&gt; 
Your first taste of equity will likely come from your family and friends and maybe some fools. In a university environment, faculty frequently add to the mix, though some argue that they fit into one of the first three categories. When these people invest money in the early stages of your company, it’s called a seed round of investment. Seed money helps pay for the business plan and the prototype, and supports you while you find additional management talent and secure the next round of financing. 
 
'''Angel investors'''&lt;br&gt; 
In the wake of friends and family come angel investors. As we mentioned previously, angel investors are affluent individuals who provide capital for a start-up, usually in exchange for ownership equity. The friends and family round of financing comes from your own personal relationships with people. But angel investors are typically not people you know. They’re people who are judging you based on the business concept, the team and the opportunity for their capital to propel the company to the next level. 
 
'''Building your credibility'''&lt;br&gt; 
To secure angel financing, you need to make a credible case for your business. You may not have tremendous successes under your belt, but if your business concept is worth anything, and if your entrepreneurial skills are up to the task, you’ll find a way to assemble a team of advisors who have more experience and credibility than you do, and will let you borrow a piece of their reputation as currency when you present your business to the angels. 

Typically, a group of angel investors contribute less than $1 million. Often that amount is significantly less with an unproven team and an early stage concept. Your task is to make that money work. You need to hit such significant milestones with that capital that you can use your accomplishments to secure the next round of money. 
 
'''Venture capital'''&lt;br&gt; 
How do I apply? People often assume that venture capital funding is akin to a bank loan process. Recently, online firms have made moves to democratize the venture capital process, but a fair number of these have failed. In reality, securing venture capital remains a complicated process without a specific formula for success.Venture capital access is a networking game. It is not democratic, and because of several factors, it is inherently elitist. If you live in a major metropolitan area, you have better access to VC resources (though www.villageventures.com) is aiming to change that. Unfortunately, if you look like the VCs you’re targeting (who are frequently white, male, Ivy Leaguers), that may also up your chances of success. 

That said, VCs are also hungry. Once you’re in the door, your presentation will stand or fall on its own merits. Alternative VC sources and investor networks are a good resource if you don’t fit the above profile. A source for venture capital for women is www.springboard2000.org. Entrepreneurs from the Indian-American community should investigate www.indianceo.com. If you’re affiliated with a college or university, visit www.universityangels.com. 

Here’s a general framework for thinking about your business, the type of capital that is appropriate, and some of the key criteria that may help secure the jet fuel of a high growth business. (Of course you have to do something productive with the money and provide a return to your investor.) Here are some basic questions that an investor asks to assess a business. 

Is the management team proven? Does its experience reflect its competence? If it’s not proven, what are its attributes? How can the missing elements be filled with additional seasoned managers? How committed is this team to the business? 

How big is the market for this product or service? Typically, an equity investor wants to see a market for a technology product that is, in total, greater than $1 billion. A good market is one in which customers feel real pain, where they will readily adopt your product because of an immediate and urgent need. 

What does the competition look like? Is this company the first to market? Is it defining the market? Will it be able to quickly gain market share? 

Is the product/technology difficult to replicate? Does it have some proprietary position (meaning patents or other intellectual property protection)? Will it take the competition a long time to replicate what the company does? 

Does the business plan present a credible story that suggests that the company can forecast results? The financial plan is a financial expression of your business strategy. It shows the interrelation of timelines, functions, and hires, and reflects a detailed understanding of the business. 

Capital intensity. Is the business appropriately scaled to the money that might be available? Your business can’t require too much money to be successful.

'''Playing the money game'''&lt;br&gt; 
Bo Peabody, who founded Tripod, one of the first dotcoms, when he was a 19-year-old Williams College student, says that raising money is like a video game. In order to get from one level to the next you have to accumulate power and weapons, and in the money-raising game the analogous power and weapons are the milestones of success and credibility. 


'''The father of venture capital: J.H. Whitney'''&lt;br&gt; 
Venture capital is a post-World War II phenomena. The idea is credited to J.H. Whitney, founder of Whitney &amp; Co., the first venture capital firm, now headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut. Prior to Whitney, new ventures were typically funded by wealthy private individuals. The development of a more formal, institutionalized investment process, embodied in professional venture capital firms, has played a major role in an expansion of access to growth capital for innovators and entrepreneurs with good ideas and the creative means to execute a successful business. 


'''Advice for before you go to the VC'''&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Choose the appropriate audience. If you're looking for financing under, say, $5 million, don't go to a professionally managed venture-capital fund. Find angel investors instead.&lt;/li&gt;  
&lt;li&gt;No NDAs. Never ask professional investors to sign a nondisclosure agreement (NDA) up front. They won't do it. VCs will immediately view you as a rookie. Don't provide sensitive information in your business plan. Once you've garnered investors' interest, you can start to let them in on the secret.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;li&gt;Forget cold calling. Find a contact who knows the investor to introduce the opportunity. Unsolicited business plans are returned just as quickly as first-time novels.&lt;/li&gt;  
&lt;li&gt;Keep it short. The longer the plan, the more likely it will be put aside for later reading that often never occurs. Never submit a full business plan. A three-page executive summary is the outer limit that they will read.&lt;/li&gt;  
&lt;li&gt;VC money is nervous money. VCs look for a low burn rate, a solid revenue model, grizzled management, and partnerships with genuine strategic value.&lt;/li&gt;  
&lt;li&gt;Follow through. Don't count on the VCs to get back to you.&lt;/li&gt;  
&lt;li&gt;Don't stop looking.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt; 
 
From &quot;What to Know Before You Go to the VCs&quot; by Joseph Bartlett, Fast Company, November, 2000.
 

'''The oyster and the pearl'''&lt;br&gt; 
In a poetic metaphor, Ray Smilor of the Ewing Marion Kauffmann Foundation compares an entrepreneur's persistent interactions with a venture capitalist to the formation of a pearl inside an oyster. The entrepreneur can be an irritant in the body of an established VC firm. Though a gem does not always form, it takes an entrepreneur to be the catalyst that helps a venture capitalist form a pearl of great value.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Pieces of the Pie''' ==

'''Funding pitfalls'''&lt;br /&gt; 
What the heck is valuation and dilution? How much equity should you give up? What are the different kinds of equity? How does all this affect the pie? Watch out! This is where budding entrepreneurs often trip up. 
 
'''The company pie'''&lt;br /&gt; 
A company has shareholders, and those shareholders collectively own 100 percent of the pie. Each shareholder has a slice of the pie. These slices may be the same size or they may be very different. When you start your company, you start it with several partners who each take a certain number of shares. This is what’s called common stock. Here’s an example of how it works: 

Let’s assume you’re ready to get started. Your attorney helps you file the paperwork to incorporate your company. In this process, maybe you authorize 200,000 shares. This means that the company has the authority to issue up to 200,000 shares (you can always go back and re-authorize additional shares). But you don’t issue all of those shares. Instead, you issue, say, 50,000, dividing them up equally among the four founders. The founders all get stock certificates saying they each hold 12,500 shares in the company. At the beginning therefore, these founders own 100% of the company, as defined by the 50,000 shares issued. Got it so far? 

Now, you want to raise some money. You find an investor who wants a third of your company and is willing to pay you $250,000 for that stake—seed money. You issue that investor a stock certificate for 25,000 shares. Now your total pool of issued shares is 75,000. Your company is valued at $750,000, since $250,000 will buy one-third of the company. This is what’s called a post-money valuation, meaning that it’s calculated after the investment. Your pre-money valuation would be $500,000. So far so good. 

You slog along, building your company. You don’t sleep for weeks, months. You make progress. Oops—you need more money. You’ve done well with the first investor’s money. You’ve reached critical milestones. You have a working demo of your product. Now you want some big money to really take this to the moon. 

You do the circuit with the venture capitalists. After some heart-wrenching meetings, you’ve found one willing to put in first round money. You’ve hit the big time. You celebrate. And then they fax you a term sheet. Can you believe it? They want fifty percent of your company! Damn. But you need the $3 million they’re offering. So, after some quick consultation with your seed investors and the four founders you decide to take the deal. 

Let’s assume that they’re talking common stock (they’re not, but we’ll get to that in a minute). If they’re buying fifty percent of your company for $3 million, that means that you’ll give them a stock certificate for 75,000 shares. Now you’ve issued 150,000 shares. The founders have 50,000 shares, so their stake, in the seed round, got diluted from 100% to 66% and in the first round, from 66% to 33%. Ah, but now (at least on paper) the company is worth $6 million, since $3 million bought 50%. Therefore, the founders’ share, which at 100% wasn’t worth much of anything, is now (at 33%) worth $2 million. In this case, a smaller piece of a bigger pie is better than a bigger piece of nothing. 
 
'''The catch'''&lt;br /&gt; 
But, and here’s the rub, sophisticated investors, venture capitalists, never invest by purchasing common stock. No, they want what’s called preferred stock. This means they have a preference upon liquidation. In other words, if the company has to be sold at fire sale prices, the investors will get the first money out. So, let’s say your product bombs—you and your investors decide that you can’t continue to run the company, and you need to sell it quickly. You get an offer, which you accept, to sell the company for $3.1 million. 

If your first round investors have preferred stock, they’ll take $3 million (what they originally paid) of that $3.1 million, even though they only own 50% of the company. The remaining $100,000 will be split among the common stockholders. In this case, your seed round investor, who put in $250,000, will only get back $33,000, as represented by that investor’s 33% of common stock. 

On the other hand, if your company does well, common and preferred stock investors will benefit on an equal basis…assuming you didn’t accept participating preferred stock. But that’s enough for now.

'''Reserving stock for stock options'''&lt;br /&gt; 
When you raise money, you reserve some pool of stock to be issued to additional employees, and also to founders as incentives and bonuses. So there is a way that you can get some additional shares of the company as a founder, if your Board of Directors agrees that you deserve some additional stock compensation. However, you won't actually get stock. You'll get stock options, or the right to buy stock, rather than the stock itself. Hopefully you'll get the right to buy stock at a price that is lower than the price the stock is selling for when you exercise the stock option. 

For example, if you got options to buy 1,000 shares of stock at $1 per share, and after a few years the stock was worth $10 per share, you'd then be able to pocket $9,000—you'd exercise your options for $1,000 total and immediately turn around and sell the stock at $10,000. You're issued stock options (and not stock) for tax reasons. If you were just issued $1,000 in stock, from the IRS' perspective that would be as good as getting $1,000 in cash, and you would be taxed accordingly, even though you didn't have the actual money. A stock option is not taxable as income until you exercise it.
 

'''Who should get what?'''&lt;br /&gt; 
What percentage of the company should each partner in a new venture receive? This is a tough question with no easy answer. In terms of percentage points, what's an idea (or invention or patent) worth? What's five years of low salary, sweat and intense commitment worth? What is experience and know-how worth? &quot;Who should get what&quot; is best determined by considering who brings what to the table.  

Suppose Bill Gates said he'd serve on your Board or give you some help. What share of the company should he get? Just think about the value that his name would bring to your company! If a venture capitalist thought your company was worth $1 million without Gates, that value would increase several-fold with Gates' involvement. Yet, what has he &quot;done&quot; for you?  

Often, company founders give little thought to this question. In many cases, the numbers are determined by what &quot;feels good,&quot; i.e., gut feeling. For example, in the case of a brand-new venture started from scratch by four engineers, the tendency might be to share equally in the new deal at 25% each. In the case of a single founder, that person may choose to keep 100% of the shares and build by bootstrapping in order to maintain total ownership and control. It may be possible to defer dealing in new partners until later, at which point the business has some inherent value, thus allowing the founder to maintain a substantial ownership position.  

So in general, the answer to the question &quot;Who should get what?&quot; is this: it depends on the relative contributions and commitments made to the company by the partners at that moment in time. Take your time in your decision.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Social Money''' ==
 
'''It’s out there'''&lt;br&gt; 
Let’s assume for a minute you’ve decided to become a social entrepreneur. Getting money for your socially beneficial startup isn’t so different from the standard process, save one thing: there are many organizations that exist primarily to give social entrepreneurs money. They’re part of a vast and fast-growing network of people dedicated to change through Socially Responsible Investing (SRI). 
 
'''Investing for the cause'''&lt;br&gt; 
At a basic level, SRI is the marriage of social responsibility and environmental sustainability to investment. It includes all the financial decision-making processes that go into a prudent investment management approach, but also includes the selection and management of investments based on issues of sustainability and social responsibility.1 There are three general investment strategies at work in SRI: 
 
'''Screening'''&lt;br&gt;  
Screening means investing in companies that do good and avoiding ones that do bad. Socially responsible investors ask their investment advisors to overlay a qualitative analysis of corporate policies, practices, attitudes and environmental impacts on top of the traditional quantitative analysis of profit potential. This means investing in enterprises with outstanding employee and environmental policies that make and sell safe, useful products and demonstrate respect for human rights worldwide. Companies on the outs typically include child labor law violators, tobacco, manufacturers of environmentally damaging products, and other who potentially inflict social harm. 
 
'''Community investing'''&lt;br&gt; 
Community investing provides capital to people in low-income, at-risk communities who have difficulty getting money through conventional channels. Many social investors earmark a percentage of their investments to community development financial institutions (CDFIs) that work to alleviate poverty, create jobs, and provide affordable housing and small business development financing in disadvantaged communities. 
 
'''Shareholder advocacy'''&lt;br&gt; 
Also called shareholder activism, this means engaging in dialogue with companies and submitting and voting on shareholder resolutions. Action is focused on positively influencing corporate behavior. Socially conscious investors often work to steer management on a course they believe will improve financial performance over time and enhance the well-being of all of the company’s stakeholders—customers, employees, vendors, communities, the environment and stockholders. 
 
'''One serious growth industry'''&lt;br&gt; 
SRI is hot. In 2003, the Social Investment Forum, in its bi-annual Report on Socially Responsible Investing Trends in the US, cited $2.16 trillion involved in one or more of the three primary socially responsible investment strategies—nearly four times the $639 billion the Forum identified in 1995. 

Assets under professional management involved in social screening, shareholder advocacy, and community investing have grown nearly 40% faster than all professionally managed investment assets in the US. Between 1995 and 2003, SRI experienced 240% growth versus 174% general market growth. 

The growth of socially screened portfolios is even more dramatic: from $165 billion in 1995 to over $2 trillion in 2003. In 2003, socially responsible portfolios accounted for 11.3% of the investment assets under professional management in the US. 
 
'''Fellows programs, venture philanthropy'''&lt;br&gt; 
Many people want to invest in good causes, but SRI funds invest in established companies. How do you, as a fledgling social entrepreneur, get funded? Check out the following organizations: 
 
Acumen Fund is a non-profit enterprise focused on improving the lives of the poor around the world. They operate like a venture capital firm—investing philanthropic resources in innovative social entrepreneurs with a goal of social change rather than financial return. 

Investors’ Circle (IC) is a non-profit national network of angel and institutional investors, foundation officers and entrepreneurs who seek to achieve financial, social and environmental returns. 

Ashoka is a global organization that searches the world for social entrepreneurs—extraordinary individuals with unprecedented ideas for change in their communities. 

Echoing Green’s mission is to spark social change by identifying, investing in and supporting the world’s most exceptional emerging leaders and the organizations they launch. Through a two-year fellowship program, they help develop new solutions to society’s most difficult problems.

'''High tech social entrepreneurship'''&lt;br&gt; 
Jim Fruchterman, an electrical engineer-turned-entrepreneur, has made a living adapting cutting-edge technologies into affordable devices for the visually impaired and other underserved populations. As a student, Fruchterman designed a reading machine for the blind originally intended for military purposes. He was determined to keep the cost of his reading machine within reach of the largest number of users, however, and eventually founded a non-profit, Arkenstone, to develop and manufacture the system. The reading tool has now been used sixty countries, and Fruchterman has created a steady stream of other inventions for the visually impaired, including Open Book, Atlas Speaks map software, and Strider, a talking GPS locator. In 2000, Fruchterman founded another non-profit, Benetech, as an incubator for socially oriented technology applications.

'''Useful links'''&lt;br&gt; 
The Social Investment Forum offers comprehensive information and contacts related to socially responsible investing at http://www.socialfunds.com. 


'''Non-profit boom'''&lt;br&gt; 
Though no exact estimate exists on the size of the field, tax records indicate that the number of non-profits grew by 60% between 1989 and 1998. About 250 colleges and universities offer courses or degree programs for students interested in jobs with a social focus. Most major MBA programs now offer courses or concentrations on social entrepreneurship. And there are forty-two funds or foundations that invest primarily in social entrepreneurs, according to a 2002 study by Venture Philanthropy Partners.

It's a real career 
David Bornstein, author of How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas, speaks on the bright future of the social entrepreneurship industry: 

&quot;One thing for individuals to think about is that this field has become a legitimate career path. For those who are still in school, or considering a career change, the field of social entrepreneurship is rapidly growing to encompass all sorts of jobs with all sorts of job descriptions. As an individual, you have plenty of opportunities to work in a way that is challenging, impactful, and deeply meaningful.&quot;

'''High-tech bootstrapping'''&lt;br&gt; 
Imagine trying to bootstrap a company that makes industrial positioning and measuring systems with nanoscale resolution. Sound tough? It’s exactly what Shane and Bethany Woody, co-founders of Charlotte-based InsituTec, Inc., have been doing since incorporating in 2001.
 
Shane, a University of North Carolina at Charlotte mechanical engineering PhD candidate, first started working on industrial measuring systems to meet a need articulated by Boeing. Shane studies and works at the Center for Precision Metrology at UNCC, which brings in corporations that have specific needs they want addressed by university researchers. Boeing’s military and commercial aircraft have millions of small rivet holes; at the time they contacted Shane they measured the holes by transferring samples to a metrology laboratory: a slow, expensive, and time-consuming process. Boeing needed a faster, cheaper way to measure the size and form of the holes in real time. Shane met the challenge, designing a prototype of a vector-based probe that would allow the measuring to take place within the manufacturing process itself, with comparable accuracy and at a lower cost. Timing was bad, however, as the economy went on a downswing—Boeing pulled out.  

But the technology was too promising to leave behind. In 2001 Shane won Advanced E-Team funding from the NCIIA to optimize the probe and move toward commercialization, and the team officially incorporated as InsituTec, Inc. Bootstrapping began.  

How have they done it?  According to Shane, the most important factor in InsituTec’s high-tech bootstrapping success has been their incubator. The Office of Technology Transfer at UNCC provides high-tech startups with office space and access to laboratory equipment based on a fixed-fee agreement in which they pay based on what facilities and office space they use. Since both Bethany and Shane are graduate students they receive free office space; they’re charged only for InsituTec-related use of university equipment. And that equipment is extremely expensive.  

“One of the instruments we use to test our devices costs about sixty to eighty thousand dollars,” says Shane. “That’s why without the incubator InsituTec wouldn’t really be possible.” 

“If it wasn’t for the university incubator program we would have no hope of even having this company right now,” adds Bethany. “That we pay for the equipment on an hourly basis instead of having to buy it is absolutely invaluable.” 

The second major factor in their bootstrapping success is salary. That is, the big salaries they don’t pay themselves. Shane pays himself far less than what the typical engineering graduate makes. “I make a tiny fraction of what I could be paying myself,” he says. “But we just have to do that right now.” 

Bethany works for no pay. She has a second job that pays the bills and offers her services to InsituTec at no cost. “My time is free to the company,” she says. “I get paid at my regular job and then I spend my afternoons, evenings, and weekends working on InsituTec. We’re in this to build the company and be successful, so a little sacrifice now for success later is worth it to us.” 

Another source of savings comes in the form of materials used in making the devices themselves. Says Bethany, “We spend every penny wisely. When we put together systems and devices we pinch every penny and do it cheaper and leaner than bigger companies. We watch everything we order. We look for the best deals. If we can get something two dollars cheaper elsewhere, we take it.” 

If all goes well, they’ll be out of bootstrapping mode in a year. “Four months ago we received a Phase I SBIR grant,” says Shane. “We’re writing several proposals for other grants. We’re working on a development contract with a large industrial equipment company. We’re getting there.” 

In the meantime Bethany offers some advice to young student inventors who may be facing years of tough bootstrapping: “If you have a company and you have a stake in it you should be willing to sacrifice early on. Don’t expect to pay yourself top dollar and succeed. If everything works out, you’ll get a big payoff later.”

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Student-run, their way: EcoTech Marine''' ==
 
Amid all the talk in this section about elevator pitches and equity, burn rate and liquidation, preferred stock and venture fairs, we present to you one simple and reassuring fact: you don’t have to get fancy angel or VC funding to succeed. In fact, in certain situations you might be better off without it. Such is the story of EcoTech Marine: a team of students with enough entrepreneurial spirit and drive to take a product all the way to market themselves, with a minimum of private investment. This profile follows EcoTech’s story from idea to prototype to successful company, detailing exactly how they got the money at each step along the way. 

'''Humble beginnings'''&lt;br&gt; 
But first we need to back up—way up, to when EcoTech co-founder Tim Marks was in eighth grade. After getting “fish fever” and maintaining freshwater aquariums for several years, Marks set up a ten-gallon “reef” aquarium, nurturing live corals and other organisms in a saltwater environment. But Marks soon discovered that maintaining a reef aquarium is a complex task that practically requires a chemistry degree, to say nothing of time and effort invested. When the demands of the tank overwhelmed his eighth-grade education, Marks dismantled it and quit the hobby altogether. 

Fast-forward to his senior year in high school, when, thanks in part to the Internet, Marks caught fish fever again. He was mentored online by Rick Dickens, webmaster of reefs.org, a popular online resource for reef keepers. The following year, as a freshman at Lehigh University, Marks met Justin Lawyer, a physics student at Oklahoma State University, in a chat room for reef enthusiasts. The two students realized they shared a vision of equipment that would automate the difficult task of reef aquarium maintenance, and they traded ideas and 3-D models of potential products. Before Marks finished his freshman year, using nothing but small amounts of their own personal funding he and Lawyer launched a full-fledged company, calling it EcoTech Marine.2 Their goal? Become a provider of innovative, high-end, automated equipment for serious aqua hobbyists. 

'''Hard work and grant writing'''&lt;br&gt; 
There was much work to be done, however. Doing most of the prototyping in the basement workshop of Marks’ home, the team built a prototype of its first product: the Kalkwasser Reactor, a device that automatically replenishes and maintains an aquarium’s calcium and alkalinity levels, vital to the health of corals.3 It was a rough alpha version, though: they needed several thousand more dollars to develop the device fully.  “We’d been funding the venture ourselves for several years,” said Patrick Clasen, a fellow student entrepreneur at Lehigh who quickly caught reef fever and joined EcoTech. “But that was no longer cutting it.”  

The team decided to submit the reactor in the Invitation to Innovate contest sponsored by the Integrated Product Development (IPD) program at Lehigh. IPD is a comprehensive entrepreneurship training program in which teams of engineering, arts, and business students collaborate for one year to make and market products. EcoTech won the contest, getting $2,000 and the chance to work with business and engineering students for two semesters, all in preparation to submit an NCIIA Advanced E-Team grant proposal. 

They did submit, and received $8,380 in NCIIA funding, mostly for prototyping. By the end of his sophomore year at Lehigh, Marks and his team had sold twenty reactors and seemed well on their way. But at the same time Marks knew that EcoTech needed more than just one product to be a viable business. “As it turned out,” says Marks, “the reactor project didn’t go as far as we hoped. But it did get our foot in the door in terms of business, manufacturing, and design experience. And, most importantly, it was the stepping-stone in terms of the next product we developed, which has been very successful.” 

'''VorTech™ to the fore'''&lt;br&gt; 
Like so many other entrepreneurial successes, the turning point for EcoTech came when it made contact with an industry player. At a local reef club meeting Marks met Andy Howard, President of IceCap, Inc., a well known name in the reef aquarium hobby. Marks and Howard connected, and Marks mentioned an idea for what he called the VorTech, a new circulating pump for aquariums that would mimic a natural wave-like water flow and minimize the intrusion of heat and bulky equipment inside the tank. Howard, it turned out, was working on an idea for a battery-powered backup circulating system for aquariums, which would require a pump. The two ideas meshed: as a new company, EcoTech needed industry support to launch the product successfully, and IceCap wanted a discrete, high-end pump for their backup system. Marks and Howard arranged a formal meeting, signed nondisclosure agreements, and Marks brought to the table two different pump ideas. Says Marks, “IceCap immediately gravitated toward the VorTech, saying, ‘We want that, build us that!’ That’s when we really turned it into high gear and started product development.” 

'''Meanwhile'''&lt;br&gt; 
In the meantime the EcoTech team members had completed their undergraduate degrees. But the project was far from over: they both stayed at Lehigh and continued to work on EcoTech, with Marks enrolled in the master of engineering in mechanical engineering program with a focus in IPD, while Clasen pursued a master’s in materials science and engineering. Their tuition was paid for, and they received stipends. Marks even became an IPD teaching assistant, helping undergraduates with their entrepreneurial projects.  

More news came in on the money front: EcoTech received another Advanced E-Team grant from the NCIIA, this time for $18,738; through Lehigh they won a $9,000 “Agile Manufacturing” grant to help with tooling and production; they won $15,000 from the State of Pennsylvania as part of the Keystone Innovation Zone (KIZ) program, designed to prevent brain-drain and keep Pennsylvania-based ideas within state boundaries; and lastly, they secured a line of credit from a local bank. The line of credit, Marks says, is especially nice as a fall-back plan. “Because of the line of credit, we’re assured that if we need more money, we can get it. If we need to increase production quantities, or if things slow down, the line of credit gives us that insurance. It’s a good thing to have.” 

And while not every team at Lehigh receives free office space and lab equipment, EcoTech did. According to Marks, EcoTech secured the space and equipment “just based on the fact that we had been doing this so long and were so dedicated.” 

'''The ramp-up'''&lt;br&gt;
In partnership with IceCap, EcoTech developed a polished prototype of the VorTech pump and debuted it on the market successfully in 2005. The specialized pump is now sold through a variety of online reef equipment companies, and the future of the product and the company is bright. “We’re getting our first product out the door now,” says Marks. “Product has shipped and more product will ship soon.” 

And EcoTech isn’t stopping at the VorTech. “We’re developing a remote control for the VorTech right now,” says Marks, “and we have a number of other products in mind. Eventually we want to launch a complete line of products for advanced aquarists, a line of products that will completely automate the reef-keeping experience.” 

Using a mish-mash of funding sources—NCIIA grants, personal money, Lehigh prize money, State of Pennsylvania money, bank money, and finally corporate partner money—EcoTech grew their venture from the ground up, their way.

ANTFARM is a passive network mapping application that utilizes output from existing network examination tools to populate its OSI-modeled database. This data can then be used to form a ‘picture’ of the network being analyzed.  ANTFARM is a data fusion tool that does not directly interact with the network. The analyst can use a variety of passive or active data gathering techniques, the outputs of which are loaded into ANTFARM and incorporated into the network map. Data gathering can be limited to completely passive techniques when minimizing the risk of disrupting the operational network is a concern.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;b&gt;Elliot C. Jones&lt;/b&gt; (born 1951) is an Associate Professor of Art at Old Dominion University (ODU) with thirty years experience in higher education, teaching a variety of courses including two dimensional design; color; basic, intermediate and advanced drawing and painting; basic art appreciation; and graduate level studio and seminar courses.  Jones' paintings and drawings have been exhibited across the country as far south as Jackson, Mississippi, as far north as Albany, New York, and as far west as Minot, North Dakota. &lt;/br&gt;

====Biography====
Currently serving as an Associate Professor of Art, Jones has served as head of the Drawing and Design Program at Old Dominion since 1992 and recently took on the role as head of the Painting Program as well.  He was also the Graduate Program Director for the University’s Art Department from 2000-2001.  

Prior to his current position, Jones was an Assistant Professor at ODU from 1992 to 1997.  Before coming to Old Dominion, he worked as an Assistant Professor of Art at Norfolk State University from 1977 till 1992.  In the spring of 1977 he held the position of Artist in Residence at the Prince Edward County Public Schools through the ESAA Project, Virginia Commission of the Arts and Humanities.

Jones has contributed to the formation of the ODU Art Department in many ways including assisting curriculum development, introducing the concept of an art class focused solely on sources in art making which received funding support, and with coordinating foundation courses.  During his year as Grad Program Director, he helped advance the non-media specific joint art program with Norfolk State University.  He has twelve years of combined administrative experience as Co-Director of the joint graduate program in Visual Studies offered by Norfolk State University and Old Dominion University.  Jones also has extensive experience serving on councils and committees that deal with student performance, program review, and policymaking.

A great resource for students, Jones has been nominated for faculty recognition in Old Dominion’s yearbook as someone who is viewed to be a great service to students.  He was also nominated as Teacher of the Year (the Stern Award), a prestigious University-wide honor where only one faculty member from each department is nominated.  Jones has worked very closely with the ODU Student Art League (ODU SAL) for over ten years.  Due to much of his efforts, SAL is very active in the community and has completed numerous extracurricular projects over the years.  Jones has impacted many young people, and some of his former students have gone on to do great things, such as Heather Bryant who is now an adjunct faculty member at the university and the faculty advisor for SAL.

====Education====
Jones graduated Magna Cum Laude from Norfolk State College in Norfolk, VA with a BA in Fine Arts in 1974, and was a member of the Alpha Kappa Mu Honor Society.  He went on to earn his Master of Fine Arts from Ohio State University in Columbus, OH in 1976.  In 1969, Jones also studied at the Tyler School of Art, Temple University in Philadelphia, PA.

====Works of Arts====
EXHIBITIONS&lt;/br&gt;
Most of Jones’ art is exhibited at the national and regional level, with some local showings as well.  He has shown in galleries and exhibits across the country in many states such as Pennsylvania, Mississippi, Texas, Ohio, Georgia, Washington and others.  His work has been in well over 20 exhibitions including “Successions: African-American Art by Contemporary Artists”, Contemporary Art Center of Virginia, Virginia Beach, VA; “The Alliance of Queens Artists present ‘Today’s American Artists’”, the Federal Hall National Memorial Rotunda, New York, NY; “The 24th (and 27th) Irene Leache Memorial Biennial Exhibition”, Chrysler Museum, Norfolk, VA; and “The Printmaking and Drawing Biennial”, Virginia Museum, Richmond, VA.  Jones also chosen as one of only seventeen artists invited to exhibit in “The Art of Prominent African American Artists 2007” in the Selden Gallery in Norfolk, VA. 

COMMISSIONS&lt;/br&gt;
Some example of Jones’ commissioned work is a portrait of Reverent Melvin Boone, retired pastor of the Metropolitan Baptist Church if Suffolk, VA which was hung in his honor at the Virginia Seminary and College in Lynchburg, VA.  He completed and installed a triptych oil painting entitled The Way displayed in East End Baptist Church in Suffolk, VA.  He completed a pastel portrait of Hugo A. Owens, former Rector of the ODU Board of Visitors for placement in the Hugo A. Owens African American Culture Center in Norfolk, VA.

PROFESSIONAL HONORS AND RECOGNITIONS&lt;/br&gt;
Jones has received many awards, honors, and recognitions through the years.  Some of these include winning first place prize in the two-dimensional art category in “Our Cultural Diversity” at the Chesapeake Museum.  He was featured in a newspaper article entitled “Memorial Portrait Captures Essence of Suffolk Educator” in the Hampton Roads section of the Virginian-Pilot in 1998 for his portrait painting of Mack Benn Jr., a former Educator and Administrator for the Suffolk Public Schools.  He won first place in drawing at the South Cobb Arts Alliance’s 10th National Juried Art Exhibition in Mableton, GA.  Jones also received the Award of Excellence for his work in the Tidewater Artists Association minority artists exhibition in Norfolk, VA.  He also serves in the community and in 1995 Jones received the Outstanding Achievement in the Arts Award by the United Concerned Citizens League of Virginia Beach, a group that sponsors activities to further the social, economic, and educational needs of the African-American community.

= Business Communication =

Professional business communication is essential to the success of any corporation. This could include writing memos, reports, or proposals. Small businesses all the way up to corporations can benefit from professional and technical communication.   

There are many different forms and aspects of business communication. Every document must be reviewed for legal implications, because any and all written documents in a business environment can and will be used in court. For all documents, use professional language and tone. When writing any document, it is important to pay attention to your audience and consider their background when writing. Two criteria for solid communication involves the ability to persuade and to be usable in business writing.

When writing business documents such as memos, reports, or workplace e-mails, it is important to consider these points. Efficiency in the business setting is of extreme importance and it all begins with communication. Wasting time in communicating is ultimately wasting money in today's society.

== Accuracy ==

The accuracy of any work is extremely important, especially if it is something that is intended to be truthful or obtain a position of interest; like a resume. If an employer or anyone associated with the employer (audience) finds out that you lied or exaggerated on anything you severely risk not obtaining or even losing your job. It is in everyone’s best interest to be completely truthful when compiling any form of business document. Not only can your job be tainted, but the loss of respect from others can be even more damaging. 

== Audience: Intended vs. Unintended ==

Every document that is created is normally crafted to someone specifically. This someone would be your intended audience. Your writing style and content will be tailored to them because they are the ones you must impress. In many situations, however, an unintended audience could come into play. This could be anyone that you never expected to see your document, such as a boss or co-worker. For example, if you send an email to a co-worker talking about the company that you work for, or even your peers, the co-worker is your intended audience. Although, if your boss were to come across this document, he or she would be the unintended audience and there could be severe repercussions if the email was not crafted with other people in mind.

All aspects of your business documents should take into consideration everyone that could potentially read it. By ensuring this, you will save yourself and possibly even save your job. The worst case scenario could be that your document's untended audience is the people in a court of law.

Overall, one must always consider who will be reading or witnessing their documents. With the business world becoming more and more global, it is increasingly important to understand how to communicate with a foreign audience as well. Something that might not be offensive to you, could easily be offensive to someone from another culture. No one will make decisions in your favor if they feel that you deliberately offended them. This could all be caused because your communication was lacking, and you weren't properly considering your audience.

== Different Types of Business Communication ==

Communication in business varies from task to task. Here is a list of just some of the different documents that can come up in the business setting:

-Memorandums (Memos)

-Presentations

-Proposals

-Reports

-Feasibility studies

== Ending a Communication ==
After getting your main point across you should properly end communication. Ending a communication is as important as getting your point across. Research has shown that the reader is able to remember things said at the end of communication more than in any other part of communication. The ending is an important place to influence the readers' impressions of the subject you are presenting. In order to properly end communication, it is important to follow the guidelines presented below.
             ''' Guideline One:''' After you've made your last point, stop. Try to use a pattern of organization that allows you to stop at a
                                    natural place.
             '''Guideline Two:''' Repeat your main point. Make sure to emphasis your main point in your conclusion. It allows the reader to 
                                    think about the main point one last time.
             '''Guideline Three:''' Summarize your key points. Although this guideline is similar to the one above, when you ''summarize'', 
                                    you are ensuring that your audience understands your entire communication.
             '''Guideline Four:''' Refer to a goal stated earlier in your communication. It is common to state a goal in the beginning of 
                                    communication. Referring to your goal at the end of communication sharpens the focus of your communication.
             '''Guideline Five:''' Focus on a key feeling. In some communications, it may be important to encourage your reader. Therefore,
                                    focusing on a feeling will help focus your reader.
             '''Guideline Six:'''  Tell your readers how to get more information. Giving future communication assistant will encourage your
                                    reader.
             '''Guideline Seven:''' Tell your readers what to do next. Giving guidance will help lead your reader in the direction you want.
             '''Guideline Eight:''' Identify any further study that is needed.
             '''Guideline Nine:''' Follow applicable social conventions. Examples of this are letters ending with an expression of thanks,
                                    and a statement that it has been enjoyable working with the reader.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Ron Snapp===

Ron Snapp (born Feb 3, 1943) is a retired faculty. He taught both drawing and painting at Old Dominion University during his 35 year tenure, from 1973 to 2008.

====Education====

Snapp attended Pueblo Junior College in Pueblo, Colorado which then became a 4 year college called Southern Colorado State College, which is where he earned his Bachelor’s degree. He then took a break from higher education and taught Junior High. Snapp taught Art, English and Science at Eaton Junior High School. After 4 years of that, he went on to receive his Master of Fine Arts degree from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. While he was working on his master’s degree there, he taught an assistantship. He also taught a printmaking class at Duke University.

====Old Dominion University====

After receiving his Master’s degree, he was hired to teach drawing at Old Dominion University. He eventually phased out of the drawing program and taught painting almost exclusively. At ODU, he served as the Graduate Program Director for 6 years. He also ran the University Gallery: first in conjunction with Ken Daley, then with Dave Johnson and lastly by himself. He was highly involved with the University Gallery throughout his 35 year tenure at ODU.

Snapp was reluctant to discuss his awards and accomplishments. He did state, however, that his goal as a teacher was to take people who were interested in art to the point that they were intelligent about it. Also he sought to push students past a point they would have gone themselves.

He was particularly proud of a conversation he had with Betsy Batten, daughter of Frank Batten the Chairman and CEO of Landmark Communications. He helped her to set up a $100,000 grant to the art department at Old Dominion University. This grant is specifically for hosting visiting artists and is still in use today.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Scary Medical Statistics: Lost In Interpretation!==

===Teacher's Notes===

Scientists don’t often like to talk about their research to journalists, as they’re really
paranoid it will be misrepresented…and in some cases they’re right! Often it’s
because data is wrongly interpreted. Medical scare stories, are usually just
that….stories! Some stories could even give Stephen King a run for his money!
This set of activities is slightly different from the rest, since it’s all to do with
underlying mathematics in science stories and the problems associated with data
interpretation.

There are several ways this lesson could be run: it could be a follow on from a
practical where you collected some data, so you could use this lesson to look at ways
of interpreting the data. Students could also work out ways to “invent” data
especially for this lesson, and then analyse and interpret it. Ideas are given below.
This needn’t be just one lesson, perhaps a couple, or joint with maths teachers (as
mentioned in the “Adaptations” below).

===Aim:===

To show that not all the statistics and medical data we read about in newspapers are
as trustworthy as they might first seem.

===Learning objectives and outcomes:===

• To critically read a piece of literature and analyse the use of science and
statistics.
• To recognise that medical scare stories are often blown out of proportion and
why.
• All students will understand that data can be interpreted in lots of ways.
• Most students will understand the impact of this misinterpretation on society.
• Some students will be able to apply what they’ve learnt in their maths lessons
to this lesson.

===Resources required:===

Examples of statistics in the media, i.e. recent news footage where numbers have
been used (e.g. percentages of patients suffering from a particular disease), student
worksheet, different coloured beads or packets of sweets (e.g. Smarties – “Only
Smarties have the answer!”), packs of playing cards, calculators (is mental
arithmetic no longer fashionable?).

===Safety:===

If using the sweets to generate data, and you are in a lab, make sure the students
aren’t tempted to eat them! Otherwise this activity should take place in a classroom.

===Starter activities:===

Why not start with “Interactive Odds”. This will get the students thinking about risk
and probabilities. Initially the students will be using their intuition as to the likelihood
of each event, but then they’ll see the numerical probabilities for each event. This
could be done as a whole class activity, followed by a short discussion on why they
decided something was more likely than another, and whether they were right?
Would it have been easier had the numbers been there from the start?
Introduce the idea that statistics can often be interpreted, and conveyed, in more
than one way…some of them are misleading.

A student worksheet is provided, so the students could work through this in the
lesson and for homework. The number generator could also be used as a whole class
participation activity.

===Core level main activity:===

1. Start with a quote from Dr Ben’s Bad Science article to illustrate different
ways of looking at one set of figures:

“Let’s say the risk of having a heart attack in your 50s is 50% higher if you have
high cholesterol: that sounds pretty bad. Let’s say the extra risk of having a
heart attack if you have high cholesterol is only 2%. That sounds OK to me. But
they’re both talking about the same (hypothetical) figures. Out of a hundred men
in their 50s with normal cholesterol, four will be expected to have a heart attack;
whereas out of 100 men with high cholesterol, six will be expected to have a
heart attack. That’s two extra heart attacks. Those are natural frequencies.
Easy.”

Explain to the students that it is often this conversion of natural frequencies
into percentages, ratios or probabilities, which makes the original scientific
data either more confusing, or completely wrong.

Mention the examples given in the article, and how natural frequencies easily
communicate risk. What do the students think about this? Do percentages,
probabilities and ratios help them understand a news story better?

2. As mentioned in the worksheet, ask the students to work in pairs or in small
groups. Give them either a pack of cards or a packet of sweets (sweets of
many different colours are best). And ask the students to generate some
data. They can do this by using simple probabilities e.g. on average, how
many blue sweets are there in a packet (a good example if they’re using the
sweets, not the pack of cards!)? They will need to know total numbers of
sweets in packets, take averages, and also look at how many blue sweets
there are per packet on average. And so encourage the scientific process
within this short data collection exercise.

3. They would also show an example of bad data collection i.e. just look in one
packet, how many blue sweets there are out of a total; so for example if they
have four blue sweets in a packet of twenty, they could state: “For every
packet of sweets, you will have four blue ones” or “20% of sweets in each
packet are blue” etc. You can highlight the importance of survey size and
random sampling at this stage.

4. Alternatively you can provide some data (from a real scientific paper, if
possible, e.g. from http://www.pubmed.gov, or see data on blood glucose
levels provided with this activity and “Adaptations” section below), and ask
the students to analyse the figures in a way that it is accurate and a way in
which it no longer says what the researcher said.

5. The way the students present their data (good science style and bad science
style) can be in the form of a table, graph, pie-chart – any suitable method.

6. Then ask the students (either within the class or for homework) to write a
short newspaper article either “sensationalising” the science statistics, or
being a really good, trustworthy scientific journalist! Or how about a
PowerPoint presentation? The students could even take the badly interpreted
data from another pair/group and pretend that they are Dr Ben Goldacre
writing about some newly discovered Bad Science!

===Plenary:===

Find out what the students thought about data collection and interpretation. Discuss
whether the press deliberately or accidentally manipulate the data: is it a matter of
inaccuracy, incorrect simplification (“dumbing down”), not fully understanding the
data or just wanting to get the best story?

Take-home message: If you’re reading a medical/health scare story, you should be
asking: am I being given the actual evidence and who is at risk?

===Extension:===

As mentioned in the Bad Science Article, even the legal profession gets in a muddle
over numbers and probabilities.

For those of you feeling brave, and wanting to tackle a “crime scene investigation”-
type maths problem, look no further than the prosecutor’s fallacy (or even the
defendant’s, interrogator’s, or jury observation fallacies). DNA evidence has been
used for many years to help convict the guilty and free the innocent. However there
are examples where a simple misunderstanding of conditional probabilities leads to
innocent people being locked up! Be warned, bringing this up in a discussion with a
class is not for the faint-hearted. There is still much debate over these fallacies and
how to prevent mathematics getting in the way of proving someone’s innocence. The
same misunderstanding has also led to investigations where there has been more
than one cot death in a family (why should more than one cot death automatically
mean that it’s suddenly a suspicious case, rather than thinking that the probability is
the same each time?). If you’re feeling really, really brave, how about adding a dash
of Bayesian probability…

Some useful websites on the topic include:
* Prosecutor’s Fallacy: http://www.colchsfc.ac.uk/maths/dna/discuss.htm
* Evaluating Legal Evidence (DNA samples):
http://www.dcs.qmul.ac.uk/researchgp/spotlight/legal.html
* The “Jury Observation Fallacy”:
http://www.dcs.qmul.ac.uk/researchgp/spotlight/jury_fallacy.pdf

For those of you who would rather just talk about conditional probability (who
wouldn’t?) and a way in which data is misinterpreted, how’s this for a close-to-home
example?:

Maths and Biology: Who’s studying what?

There are 35 students in the year group (yes, it’s a small school!). The number of
students studying maths (M) is 26, taking biology (B) is 15, and six students study
both. Students can visualise this better through a simple Venn diagram (as shown
below).

The question to ask: So, if you were to walk into the biology classroom and pick a
student at random, what is the probability that they also study maths?

The common mistake here is that people assume that the conditional probability of
students doing maths given that they do biology is the same as the conditional
probability of students doing biology given that they do maths. Not the case, at all.
So how do we explain this?

Using the Venn diagram above, if we went into the biology classroom there is a total
of 15 students (6 + 9). Six of these students also study maths. Therefore the
probability of picking a student doing maths given that they study biology is 6/15. If
you were to walk into the maths classroom, there is a total of 26 students (6 + 20).
Six of these students also study biology. So the probability of picking a student doing
biology given that they study maths is 6/26.

So we can conclude that there is a higher probability of a biology student also
studying maths than there is of a maths student also studying biology.

===Adaptations and Other ideas:===

* Since there is a limited amount of mathematics you can cover during a
science lesson, perhaps this could be a joint lesson with the maths teacher (or
run the activities in both maths and science lessons in the same week)
* Get the students to act out a radio/television interview (and actually record it)
where the interviewer introduces the scientist having got the research
completely wrong. The scientist then comes out, and the discussion continues
with the scientist making his/her case about the real findings of the research.
* The background information sheet provided with this activity could be a useful
starting point to have other discussions…especially on the topic of gambling
(how people are attracted into playing the lottery even though there is a 1 in
14,000,000 chance of winning (a six number lottery)!
* If you feel limited by time, or wish to set homework or an extension activity,
why not incorporate a real medical situation into the lesson, such as diabetes,
and the need to monitor blood glucose levels. The data provided (blood
glucose levels) can be analysed by the students, instead of getting the
students to generate their own data! The actual data was used to look at
homeostasis, the mechanisms that regulate blood glucose levels in the body.

Information to provide with blood glucose data:

Your blood glucose level is measured in millimoles per litre (mmol/l). During
the day your blood glucose level is between 4 and 8 mmol/l, but they are
higher after meals and usually at their lowest level when you wake up in the
morning (which is why breakfast is so important!). In diabetes, the blood
glucose levels move outside of this normal range.

Ideal blood glucose levels should be:
- 4 to 8 mmol/l before meals
- Less than 10 mmol/l one and half hours after a meal
- Approximately 8 mmol/l at bedtime

===ICT:===

Looking at websites where there has been misrepresentation of statistics and
frequencies in science topics in the media.

===Keywords:===

Statistics, probability, frequency, fallacy, data, mathematics.

===Citizenship:===

Significance of the media in society.

===Assessment opportunities:===

Scientific literacy skills, critical thinking, mathematics in science, data collation and
interpretation, data presentation methods (graphs, pie-charts).

===Curriculum links:===

This can be incorporated into lessons where you may be looking into the importance
of testing explanations, the need for scientific literacy and numeracy, and
considering the strength of the evidence.

===Homework tasks:===

Did you ever believe the media over a health story and then find out it was flawed
research, or the data had been misinterpreted? What was it, and what made you
believe them? Was there ever a case where it seemed obvious that the media had
glossed over the facts and made assumptions on very little data?

===Medical Scares!===

Everyone would like to think that drinking and eating what you like is good for
you…but aren’t we just manipulating scientific results to fit our lifestyles, and make
us all feel happy? If a scientist manipulated their data, technically known as “fiddling
the figures”, they’d be shunned by the rest of their community! One of the reasons
scientists continually communicate their work through conferences and journals is so
that others working in their field can point out any mistakes and assumptions they’ve
made with their data.

Here are some other examples of Dr Ben Goldacre’s Bad Science articles which could
be used as a basis for other useful discussions:

* A wee dram cuts obesity risk? It's not that simple.
(http://www.guardian.co.uk/life/badscience/story/0,,1669542,00.html). In
time for Christmas, a bunch of stories were published about chocolate and
alcohol being good for you. Typical! And also how people who drink alcohol in
moderation have lower levels of obesity than heavy drinkers and those who
don’t drink at all…Now, now before we get carried away, is this really what
the research showed? Quite a few variables weren’t taken into consideration
at all.

* After feeding the scare he’ll sell you the solution.
(http://www.guardian.co.uk/life/badscience/story/0,12980,1604200,00.html)

* What happens when someone claiming to be a good scientist, but not really
doing proper research, is the one everyone believes? Dr Chris Malyszewicz
claims that all hospitals are unclean, letting MRSA flourish in each and every
corner! But can we trust his data

Student Worksheet

What’s the likelihood of that!?

On the scale below, write down some events…just anything you think that would
definitely happen, could happen, or would never be seen in a million years!

Why is it so important that we get numbers and probabilities right?

Using the Number Generator on the website, were you able to predict the number:

a) when guessing a number between 1 and 10?

b) when guessing a number between 1 and 1,000,000?

How easy or difficult did you find this and why?

Now, working in pairs or in groups, using materials supplied by your teacher, invent
some data! Write a short paragraph of what you did, and what you used, in the
space below:

Record your results in a table/graph/pie-chart in the space below:

How can you interpret this data (as if you are a newspaper journalist) so that you’re:

a) telling the truth and informing readers of what you were trying to investigate,

or

b) telling the scariest story ever i.e. manipulating the data so that it doesn’t really say what you set out to investigate?

What’s your snappy headline going to be?

===Background Notes===

====Probabilities, Statistics, Percentages and Numbers====
Numbers are everywhere, and it seems obvious
that if you have two pounds and you add two
pounds to them, you have four pounds. But did
you know it may have taken man millions of years
to be able to think in numbers? To this day, it’s the
hardest concept to teach children.

In ancient times, if a man wanted to tell someone
how many animals he had, he would put a stone or
pebble into a bag for each animal. The more
animals, the more stones. Which could explain
where the word “calculate” comes from: the Latin
word calculus means “stone”!

We live in a world of uncertainty, saying things like, “I’ll be back around 3pm” or “I
might be able to do that.” To express uncertainty in maths, we use numbers. A scale
of 0 to 1 is usually used to describe the likelihood of something happening, i.e. 0
representing something impossible, and 1 representing something certain!

To find out the probability of something happening, we divide the number of
successful outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes. So when you flip a
coin, you have a total of two possible outcomes: heads or tails. The probability of the
coin landing “heads up” (your favourable outcome), is 1/2. This fraction can be
placed on the probability scale, as mentioned above, at 0.5.

A basic understanding of probability helps us understand everything from cricket
scores to “predicting” the weather or even the possibility that you could win the
lottery!

====Weather Forecasting====

If the weatherman on the telly says that the chance of rain is 70%, what does he
mean? Where does he get a percentage like that? Well, a bunch of clever
meteorologists at the MET Office (http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/) calculate these
probabilities based on all days from the past which occurred at a similar time in the
year and with similar characteristics (temperature, humidity, air pressure etc.). If
they have data for 100 days, and it rained on 70 days, the probability that it will rain
on the next similar day is 70/100 i.e. 70%!

So that’s how they do it! And since 70% is more than 50% (a probability where an
event is just as likely to occur as not), it means we’re more likely to get rained on!

====Did You Know?====

The only man in the world to be struck by lightning seven times was ex-park ranger
Roy Sullivan, who is now known as the ‘human lightning conductor’ of Virginia, USA.
A single lightning strike is made up of several 100 million volts with a peak current of
approximately 20,000 amps.

====Is Lady Luck On Your Side?====

Probability is our way of expressing the fact we’re not able to predict….unless you’re
psychic, but let’s not get into the pseudoscience of that one!

Gamblers expect the laws of probability in a large population to be represented in
much smaller populations, but others throw out the
mathematics of probability completely and associate
the times they won with a coincidental event (e.g. the
day I wore those shorts I won £1000 on the lottery!).
Professor Mark Griffiths (International Gaming
Research Unit, Nottingham Trent University) has
consistently shown that slot machine players have
their favourite machine. He says, “In North America,
casino operators commonly complain that hard core
slot machine players urinate into the plastic coin cups
or onto the floor rather than leave a machine they are
convinced is about to pay out a jackpot!”

The Gambler's fallacy: Just say you wanted to flip a coin 10 times. You’ve flipped it 8
times, and each time it lands heads up. Ask people to guess what will happen on
your ninth go. You’re likely to find that more people will bet that it will land tails up.
Why? There’s still only a 50/50 chance of it being either heads or tails.

=== Code:Interpreted ===
This is a rather more complex code template, intended to present code that can be typed in to an interpreter, rather than compiled. It is expected that this sort of code will be copied and pasted directly into an interactive shell-like environment.  The same template can also be used for a variety of formats, such as basic input, or input plus output. This is achieved by using a template that accepts a variable number of arguments.

If a language is specified, then syntax highlighting of code is automatically included, using the &amp;lt;source&amp;gt; tag (courtesy of [http://qbnz.com/highlighter/ GeSHi]). This also allows line numbering, or (with a few [[Special:MyPage/skin.css|user CSS]] lines, as described below), displays a cursor character which will not be copied and pasted. This allows readers to copy and paste example code directly into the interpreter.

==== Named arguments ====
Called with 4 unnamed arguments, the output generated looks something like Template:Code:Output
{{Code:Interpreted
|The 1st argument is for the initial explanation. The entire box is contained in a div of class &quot;code&quot;.
|The 2nd argument is the text typed into the interpreter.
It will be enclosed in either &amp;lt;source&amp;gt; or &amp;lt;pre&amp;gt; tags, 
depending on if an input language has been specified 
which themselves are contained in a div of class &quot;input&quot;.
(N. B. If this parameter is blank, then the whole thing is omitted
|The 3rd argument is the output. This should be in &amp;lt;pre&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt; tags: you probably don't want to use &amp;lt;source&amp;gt;, because syntax-highlighting the output would be silly e.g.
&lt;pre&gt;&gt;cd /bin&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&gt;ls
bash            df              ln              rm
cat             echo            ls              rmdir
chmod           ed              mkdir           sh
cp              expr            mv              sleep
csh             hostname        ps              stty
date            kill            pwd             sync
dd              ksh             rcp             tcsh
&lt;/pre&gt;
|and the 4th argument is the continuation of the explanation. 
The main use of this template is to produce input text with an auto-generated prompt character, using the :before pseudo-element available in [[CSS]]. This has one major advantage, and another possible benefit
*When copying and pasting the text, the prompt character is not copied in most browsers. This allows the user to copy the text and paste it in to the interpreter verbatim, without removing the prompt
*The prompt character is user-defined, so can be set to the user's personal prompt character, if desired. This is of dubious benefit.
To see this in action, you need to add something like the following to your [[Special:MyPage/skin.css|user CSS]] file (usually located at [[Special:Mypage/monobook.css]])&lt;pre&gt;.code .input pre{padding:0; border: none;}
.code .input pre:before {content: &quot;\003E \0020&quot;;}&lt;/pre&gt;
This will put a &quot;&gt; &quot; prompt in front of each &amp;lt;pre&amp;gt; tag in the input box.
}}

Called with three unnamed arguments, the Results box vanishes, as does the (now unneeded) &quot;Input&quot; heading
{{Code:Interpreted
|This is a script in Python. If you wish to format Python scripts differently from other scripts, add the following to your user CSS file&lt;pre&gt;.code * pre.source-python:before, .code .source-python pre:before {content: &quot;\003E \003E \003E \0020&quot;;}&lt;/pre&gt;
|&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;hello = &quot;Hello, World!&quot;&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;print hello #does what it says&lt;/source&gt;
|See?
}}

However, you might want an Input/Results box with no end explanation. If so, just use a blank 4th argument
{{Code:Interpreted
|You might want to provide a Python-specific prompt in the output too. If so, just call &amp;lt;pre&amp;gt; with the appropriate class
|&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;hello = &quot;Hello, World!&quot;&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;print hello #does what it says&lt;/source&gt;
|&lt;pre class=&quot;source-python&quot;&gt;hello = &quot;Hello, World!&quot;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;source-python&quot;&gt;print hello #does what it says
Hello, World!&lt;/pre&gt;
|
}}

Now it gets simpler. With two unnamed arguments: 
{{Code:Interpreted
|There is no &quot;after&quot; text.
|&lt;pre&gt;cd /bin&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;ls&lt;/pre&gt;
}}

With one unnamed argument
{{Code:Interpreted
|there is no before text. The first argument is the code&lt;pre&gt;cd /bin&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;ls&lt;/pre&gt;
}}

==== Named arguments ====
There are 2 named arguments: &quot;title&quot;, &quot;lang&quot;. (Note it would be nice to have a 3rd, whether or not to apply an output prompt)

The effect of the &quot;title&quot; argument should be obvious:
{{Code:Interpreted
|title=Title example
|A simple example with 2 unnamed arguments and a &quot;title&quot; argument set to &quot;Title example&quot;.
|&lt;pre&gt;cd /bin&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;ls&lt;/pre&gt;
}}

The named argument &quot;lang&quot; is a shortcut, so that you don't need to put the class=&quot;source-python&quot; or equivalent in every &amp;lt;pre&amp;gt; tag. 
{{Code:Interpreted
|title=A title
|lang=python
|An example with all 6 possible arguments. The &quot;lang&quot; argument adds another class to the input div, called source-&quot;lang&quot;
|&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;hello = &quot;Hello, World!&quot; #syntax highlighted&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;print hello #not syntax highlighted&lt;/pre&gt;
|&lt;pre&gt;hello = &quot;Hello, World!&quot;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;print hello #does what it says&lt;/pre&gt;
|much easier, if you don't want to use &amp;lt;source&amp;gt;.
}}

==== Wiki Code ====

The code for all the above codeboxes is
&lt;pre&gt;Called with 4 unnamed arguments, the output generated looks something like Template:Code:Output

|The 1st argument is for the initial explanation. The entire box is contained in a div of class &quot;code&quot;.
|The 2nd argument is the text typed into the interpreter. It is contained in a div of class &quot;input&quot;. Normally the contents should be enclosed in one or more &amp;lt;pre&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt; or &amp;lt;source&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/source&amp;gt; tags, like so
&amp;lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&amp;gt;cd /bin #a comment&amp;lt;/source&amp;gt;&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;ls&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;
|The 3rd argument is the output. This should be in &amp;lt;pre&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt; tags: you probably don't want to use &amp;lt;source&amp;gt;, because syntax-highlighting the output would be silly e.g.
&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&amp;gt;cd /bin&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&amp;gt;ls
bash            df              ln              rm
cat             echo            ls              rmdir

      <text xml:space="preserve">==== Constructing vectors ====
{{Code:Interpreted
|lang={{:Statistical_Analysis:_an_Introduction_using_R/R/Syntax}}
|One of the most fundamental objects in R is the ''vector''. This is a collection of multiple measurements of the same type, so can be used to store data variables. R provides several ways to create a vector
* For a simple sequence of numbers from ''a'' to ''b'', the easiest way is to use the notation a:b. 
* Many functions return vectors. Two of the most useful are &quot;seq()&quot; and &quot;c()&quot;. The function &quot;seq()&quot; produces &lt;u&gt;seq&lt;/u&gt;uences of numbers, similar to a:b, but with more flexibility. The function &quot;c&quot;  &lt;u&gt;c&lt;/u&gt;oncatenates objects together into a vector, and so can be used to construct an arbitrary vector.

|0:10            #Creates a vector of 10 numbers consisting of the integers 0 to 10
seq(0,10)            #Creates a vector of 10 numbers consisting of the integers 0 to 10
my.data &lt;- 0:10 
c(2,3,6,6,6)      #Creates a vector of 5 numbers
c(2,3,6,6,6) + 1  #N.B. you can do all the normal calculations on vectors

{{fsharpTitle|Mutable Data}}

All of the data types and values in F# seen so far have been immutable, meaning the values cannot be reassigned another value after they've been declared. However, F# allows programmers to create variables in the true sense of the word: variables whose values can change throughout the lifetime of the application.

== &lt;code&gt;mutable&lt;/code&gt; Keyword ==
The simplest mutable variables in F# are declared using the &lt;code&gt;mutable&lt;/code&gt; keyword. Here is a sample using fsi:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; let mutable x = 5;;

val mutable x : int

&gt; x;;
val it : int = 5

&gt; x &lt;- 10;;
val it : unit = ()

&gt; x;;
val it : int = 10&lt;/source&gt;
As shown above, the &lt;code&gt;&lt;-&lt;/code&gt; operator is used to assign a mutable variable a new value. Notice that variable assignment actually returns &lt;code&gt;unit&lt;/code&gt; as a value.

The mutable keyword is frequently used with record types to create mutable records:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
open System
    
type transactionItem =
    { ID : int;
        mutable IsProcessed : bool;
        mutable ProcessedText : string; }
        
let getItem id =
    { ID = id;
        IsProcessed = false;
        ProcessedText = null; }
        
let processItems (items : transactionItem list) =
    items |&gt; List.iter(fun item -&gt;
        item.IsProcessed &lt;- true
        item.ProcessedText &lt;- sprintf &quot;Processed %s&quot; (DateTime.Now.ToString(&quot;hh:mm:ss&quot;))
        
        Threading.Thread.Sleep(1000) (* Putting thread to sleep for 1 second to simulate
                                        processing overhead. *)
        )

let printItems (items : transactionItem list) =
        items |&gt; List.iter (fun x -&gt; printfn &quot;%A&quot; x)

let main() =
    let items = List.init 5 getItem
    
    printfn &quot;Before Process:&quot;
    printItems items
    
    printfn &quot;After process:&quot;
    processItems items
    printItems items
    
    Console.ReadKey(true) |&gt; ignore
 
main()&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;Before Process:
{ID = 0;
 IsProcessed = false;
 ProcessedText = null;}
{ID = 1;
 IsProcessed = false;
 ProcessedText = null;}
{ID = 2;
 IsProcessed = false;
 ProcessedText = null;}
{ID = 3;
 IsProcessed = false;
 ProcessedText = null;}
{ID = 4;
 IsProcessed = false;
 ProcessedText = null;}
After process:
{ID = 0;
 IsProcessed = true;
 ProcessedText = &quot;Processed 10:00:31&quot;;}
{ID = 1;
 IsProcessed = true;
 ProcessedText = &quot;Processed 10:00:32&quot;;}
{ID = 2;
 IsProcessed = true;
 ProcessedText = &quot;Processed 10:00:33&quot;;}
{ID = 3;
 IsProcessed = true;
 ProcessedText = &quot;Processed 10:00:34&quot;;}
{ID = 4;
 IsProcessed = true;
 ProcessedText = &quot;Processed 10:00:35&quot;;}&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Limitations of Mutable Variables ===
Mutable variables are somewhat limited: mutables are inaccessible outside of the scope of the function where they are defined. Specifically, this means its not possible to reference a mutable in a subfunction of another function. Here's a demonstration in fsi:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; let testMutable() =
    let mutable msg = &quot;hello&quot;
    printfn &quot;%s&quot; msg
    
    let setMsg() =
        msg &lt;- &quot;world&quot;
    
    setMsg()
    printfn &quot;%s&quot; msg;;

          msg &lt;- &quot;world&quot;
  --------^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

stdin(18,9): error FS0191: The mutable variable 'msg' is used in an invalid way. Mutable
variables may not be captured by closures. Consider eliminating this use of mutation or
using a heap-allocated mutable reference cell via 'ref' and '!'.&lt;/source&gt;

== Ref cells ==
Ref cells get around some of the limitations of mutables. In fact, ref cells are very simple datatypes which wrap up a mutable field in a record type. Ref cells are defined by F# as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;type 'a ref = { mutable contents : 'a }&lt;/source&gt;

The F# library contains several built-in functions and operators for working with ref cells:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
let ref v = { contents = v }      (* val ref  : 'a -&gt; 'a ref *)
let (!) r = r.contents            (* val (!)  : 'a ref -&gt; 'a *)
let (:=) r v = r.contents &lt;- v    (* val (:=) : 'a ref -&gt; 'a -&gt; unit *)
&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;ref&lt;/code&gt; function is used to create a ref cell, the &lt;code&gt;!&lt;/code&gt; operator is used to read the contents of a ref cell, and the &lt;code&gt;:=&lt;/code&gt; operator is used to assign a ref cell a new value. Here is a sample in fsi:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; let x = ref &quot;hello&quot;;;

val x : string ref

&gt; x;; (* returns ref instance *)
val it : string ref = {contents = &quot;hello&quot;;}

&gt; !x;; (* returns x.contents *)
val it : string = &quot;hello&quot;

&gt; x := &quot;world&quot;;; (* updates x.contents with a new value *)
val it : unit = ()

&gt; !x;; (* returns x.contents *)
val it : string = &quot;world&quot;&lt;/source&gt;

Since ref cells are allocated on the heap, they can be shared across multiple functions:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
open System

let withSideEffects x =
    x := &quot;assigned from withSideEffects function&quot;
   
let refTest() =
    let msg = ref &quot;hello&quot;
    printfn &quot;%s&quot; !msg
    
    let setMsg() =
        msg := &quot;world&quot;
    
    setMsg()
    printfn &quot;%s&quot; !msg
    
    withSideEffects msg
    printfn &quot;%s&quot; !msg

let main() =
    refTest()
    Console.ReadKey(true) |&gt; ignore
 
main()&lt;/source&gt;
The &lt;code&gt;withSideEffects&lt;/code&gt; function has the type &lt;code&gt;val withSideEffects : string ref -&gt; unit&lt;/code&gt;.

This program outputs the following:
&lt;pre&gt;hello
world
assigned from withSideEffects function&lt;/pre&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;withSideEffects&lt;/code&gt; function is named as such because it has a ''side-effect'', meaning it can change the state of a variable in other functions. Ref Cells should be treated like fire. Use it cautiously when it is absolutely necessary but avoid it in general. If you find yourself using Ref Cells while translating code from C/C++, then ignore efficiency for a while and see if you can get away without Ref Cells or at worst using mutable. You would often stumble upon a more elegant and more maintanable algorithm 

=== Aliasing Ref Cells ===
: '''Note:''' While imperative programming uses aliasing extensively, this practice has a number of problems. In particular it makes programs hard to follow since the state of any variable can be modified at any point elsewhere in an application. Additionally, multithreaded applications sharing mutable state are difficult to reason about since one thread can potentially change the state of a variable in another thread, which can result in a number of subtle errors related to race conditions and dead locks.

A ref cell is very similar to a C or C++ pointer. Its possible to point to two or more ref cells to the same memory address; changes at that memory address will change the state of all ref cells pointing to it. Conceptually, this process looks like this:

Let's say we have 3 ref cells looking at the same address in memory:
&lt;pre&gt;
  Memory
   ____
  |____|    cell1
  |____|   /
  |__7_| - cell2
  |____|   \
  |____|    cell3&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;code&gt;cell1&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;cell2&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;cell3&lt;/code&gt; are all pointing to the same address in memory. The &lt;code&gt;.contents&lt;/code&gt; property of each cell is &lt;code&gt;7&lt;/code&gt;. Let's say, at some point in our program, we execute the code &lt;code&gt;cell1 := 10&lt;/code&gt;, this changes the value in memory to the following:

&lt;pre&gt;
  Memory
   ____
  |____|    cell1
  |____|   /
  |_10_| - cell2
  |____|   \
  |____|    cell3&lt;/pre&gt;

By assigning &lt;code&gt;cell1.contents&lt;/code&gt; a new value, the variables &lt;code&gt;cell2&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;cell3&lt;/code&gt; were changed as well. This can be demonstrated using fsi as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
&gt; let cell1 = ref 7;;
val cell1 : int ref

&gt; let cell2 = cell1;;
val cell2 : int ref

&gt; let cell3 = cell2;;
val cell3 : int ref

&gt; !cell1;;
val it : int = 7

&gt; !cell2;;
val it : int = 7

&gt; !cell3;;
val it : int = 7

&gt; cell1 := 10;;
val it : unit = ()

&gt; !cell1;;
val it : int = 10

&gt; !cell2;;
val it : int = 10

&gt; !cell3;;
val it : int = 10&lt;/source&gt;

== Encapsulating Mutable State ==
F# discourages the practice of passing mutable data between functions. Functions that rely on mutation should generally hide its implementation details behind a private function, such as the following example in FSI:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; let incr =
    let counter = ref 0
    fun () -&gt;
        counter := !counter + 1
        !counter;;

val incr : (unit -&gt; int)

&gt; incr();;
val it : int = 1

&gt; incr();;
val it : int = 2

&gt; incr();;
val it : int = 3&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|How does cloud computing enable greater mobility?}}

Imagine not having to mow the lawn, take the garbage out or do the dishes, being able to spend more time doing what we’re really interested in. That’s one man's dream. Add to this not having to own a lawnmower or  dishwasher and it gets even better. Now transpose this to a business context and you get a fair idea of what cloud computing is. 

Cloud computing is less about what than how we’re doing things. In fact, it’s intention is to allow users to do exactly what they’ve always been doing but in a greener, more effective, less costly, easily scalable and self-healing way. The picture looks perfect. But is it, really? Leaving all the rasping chores and responsibilities in one another’s hands and focussing on more critical tasks seems to be. In short, all this implies that those secondary services you need will be executed somewhere, any time you want, on another’s physical infrastructure (about which you don’t have to care) and in some unknown way, provided the result will be the same. That’s great indeed and those are assumed strengths of cloud computing but they might easily turn into concerns as well, and fast.

==Issues==
There are obvious downsides to this approach. There’s the privacy issue, the security of data transactions and the possibility of being locked-out of it’s own data altogether (that as happened to many Gmail users) due to tenants-set rules or simply client-made mistakes.

===Loss of Control===
A broader problem related to the cloud paradigm is the total loss of control over both data and the treatment applied to it. Some think that cloud computing is just a trap designed to force people into buying more proprietary web-based software hidden behind a “flavour of the day” hype. &quot;One reason you should not use web applications to do your computing is that you lose control.&quot; said Richard Stallman, founder of GNU and advocate of free, open-source software. &quot;It's just as bad as using a proprietary program. Do your own computing on your own computer with your copy of a freedom-respecting program. If you use a proprietary program or somebody else's web server, you're defenceless”. 

===Reliability===
Talking about control, you’re better hope that somebody somewhere has some sort of it over what happens in the “cloud”. After all, you’re putting a great deal of your operations between the hands of those who actually manage these fragmented databases and develop that software. Reliability, in theory, is a major asset of cloud computing but because it also constitutes a single point of failure, when it messes, it may mess in a very bad way. And it showed in July 2008 when Amazon’s S3 failed for more than 8 hours on a nice Sunday. “Images began to wink out on the micro-blogging service Twitter. The photo-sharing site SmugMug flashed up &quot;Service unavailable&quot;. Jungle Disk, which advertises &quot;Reliable online storage&quot;, stopped working”. Indeed, all those online providers rely heavily on S3. According to Lukas Biewald, &quot;Using Amazon's S3 (…) we had thought that the reliability of Amazon would be significantly higher. But that now seems wrong&quot;.

==Future==
In brief, the idea puts an enormous burden on developers in and out of the cloud in order to address the many shortages of  the cloud infrastructure and keeping and improving it’s similarly numerous advantages. Even programming according to this new platform has to be learned. Legislators will have vote new laws making providers liable for loss of business for example and application tenants will eventually have to comply with it. New ideas already emerge to fix high profile agreed problems. Google has put out “gears”, a tool that allows users of most of its online applications to run offline (if properly designed) and keep a copy of  sensible data or a print of it “at home”. And the concept of  interoperability between clouds (utilization of clouds by clouds) is also coming. That should help reduce important downtimes and alleviate deceiving backups problems just to name a few. But for that, competitors will have to grow up and learn to become allies and agree on standards while not stepping on each other’s playground.

==Conclusion==
Cloud computing is a form of specialization and humanity has evolved vastly through specialization of individuals. For instance, you don’t really need to know what’s the plumber’s doing under the sink and you might not even be there when he does it. You just don’t want to fix your pipes yourself. And not because apparently plumbers screw up on rare occasions should we stop hiring them completely.

== Calculus: Maxima and Minima ==

Hullo! I found out you modified the terms &quot;maxima&quot; and &quot;minima&quot; in a book on Calculus to &quot;maximum&quot; and &quot;minimum&quot; under the wrong assumption that they might be mistakes. However, this is not the case. It is, in fact, &quot;maxima&quot; and &quot;minima&quot; not &quot;maximum&quot; and &quot;minimum&quot;. See [[w:Maxima and minima|here]].

:Thank you for the welcome. I know what maxima and minima are. They are plurals of the words &quot;maximum&quot; and &quot;minimum&quot;. I changed the words because they were used as plurals, when they should not have been. &quot;...that it is a maxima or minima&quot; does not make grammatical sense, as &quot;it&quot;, which is singular, is not a maxima, which is plural. That would be the same as saying &quot;it is an inflection points&quot;. As a side note, I note you reverted my edit with Twinkle, calling it vandalism. Labeling good-faith edits as vandalism is poor form, and you would do well to not do so. [[User:Seresin|Seresin]] ([[User talk:Seresin|talk]]) 06:19, 14 November 2008 (UTC)
:: I am sorry about that. Rather, I should have worded it as &quot;unintentional vandalism&quot; or should've left the field blank. Nevertheless, I don't regard that edit as disruptive, else, I would've sent a warning. I am really sorry about that. Well, I guess a maxima includes a local as well as global maximum and that the same is for minima too. Feel free to revert my edit if you feel that I had been wrong here. :-) Cheers-&lt;font color=&quot;maroon&quot; size=&quot;4&quot; face=&quot;Monotype Corsiva&quot;&gt;[[User:Ravichandar84|Ravichandar]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;aqua&quot; face=&quot;Monotype Corsiva&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Ravichandar84|My coffee shop]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; 07:00, 14 November 2008 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==HISTORICAL OVERVIEW OF THE PERIOD==

===Relation to the English Literature===

The British claimed most of the Atlantic seaboard north of Florida as belonging to Britain soon after Columbus discovered land across the Atlantic Ocean. Henry VII sent John Cabot to chart out the &quot;regions or provinces of the heathen and infidel, whatsoever they may be&quot; as early as 1497. However, circumstances never arose for England to make good on her claims until late during Elizabeth's reign. When England finally did establish her first permanent settlement in 1607 in Jamestown, Virginia, and a few years later in Massachusetts, her primary motives were:
   1) the monarchical desire to expand the empire, 
   2) the people's longing for land to cultivate, 
   3) treasure and adventure, 
   4) a nation's desire to be rid of excess populations, such as debtors, prisoners, and unemployed youths,
   5) expand commerce through trade, and 
   6) freedom of religious practice.
The literature produced in the part of America known as the United States did not begin as an independent literature. England bestowed on the earliest settlers the English language, books, and modes of thought. England had an established literature long before the first permanent settlement across the Atlantic was considered. Shakespeare, for example, had died only four years before the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth. 

For nearly two hundred years after the first English settlements in America, the majority of the works read there were written by English authors. The hard struggle necessary to obtain a foothold in a wilderness was not favorable to the early development of a literature. Those who remained in England could not clear away the forest, till the soil, and contend with Indians, but they could write the books and send them across the ocean. The early settlers were for the most part content to allow English authors to do this. For these reasons it is unsurprising that early American literature does not match in quality that produced in England during the same period.

When Americans began to write in larger numbers, there was at first close adherence to English models. For a while it seemed as if American literature would be only a feeble imitation of these models. Beginning in the eighteenth century, that started to change and some colonial writing was considered to have merit in its own right. The literature of England gained something from America as well. As early as the nineteenth century, English critics, like John Addington Symonds, Robert Louis Stevenson, and Edward Dowden, have testified to the power of the democratic element in American literature and willingly admitted that without a study of Cooper, Poe, and Hawthorne no one could give an adequate account of the landmarks of achievement in fiction written in English. French critics too have always admired Poe. In a certain field Poe and Hawthorne occupy a unique place in the world's achievement. Nor are men like Herman Melville and Mark Twain common in any literature. 

Some of the reasons why American literature developed along original lines and thus conveyed a message of its own to the world are to be found in the changed environment and the varying problems and ideals of American life. Even more important than the changed ways of earning a living and the difference in climate, animals, and scenery were the struggles leading to the Revolutionary War, the formation and guidance of the Republic, and the Civil War. All these combined to give individuality to American thought and literature.

===The Virginia Colony===

In 1607 the first permanent English colony within the present limits of the United States was planted at Jamestown in Virginia. The colony was founded for commercial reasons by the London Company, an organization formed to secure profits from colonization. The colonists and the company that furnished their ship and outfit expected large profits from the gold mines and the precious stones which were believed to await discovery. Of course, the adventurers were also influenced by the honor and the romantic interest which they thought would result from a successful settlement.

When the expedition sailed from England in December, 1606, Michael Drayton, an Elizabethan poet, wrote verses dedicated &quot;To the Virginian Voyage.&quot; These stanzas show the reason for sending the colonizers to Virginia:
   You brave heroic minds,
   Worthy your country's name,
   That honor still pursue,
   Whilst loit'ring hinds
   Lurk here at home with shame,
   Go and subdue.
       *       *       *       *       *
   And cheerfully at sea,
   Success you still entice,
   To get the pearl and gold;
   And ours to hold
   Virginia,
   Earth's only paradise.
The majority of the early Virginian colonists, however, were unfit for their task. Contemporary accounts tell of the &quot;many unruly gallants, packed hither by their friends to escape ill destinies.&quot; Beggars, vagabonds, indentured servants, kidnapped girls, even convicts, were sent to Jamestown. After the execution of Charles I in 1649, and the setting up of the Puritan Commonwealth, many of the royalists, or Cavaliers, as they were called, came to Virginia to escape oppressive Puritan rule. They became the ancestors of Presidents and statesmen, and of many of the aristocratic families of the South.

The ideals expressed by Captain John Smith, the leader and preserver of the Jamestown colony, are worthy to rank beside those of the colonizers of New England. Looking back at his achievement in Virginia, he wrote, &quot;Then seeing we are not born for ourselves but each to help other ... Seeing honor is our lives' ambition ... and seeing by no means would we be abated
of the dignities and glories of our predecessors; let us imitate their virtues to be worthily their successors.

===The Puritans Colonize New England===

During the period from 1620 to 1640, large numbers of English people migrated to that part of America now known as New England. These emigrants were not impelled by hope of wealth, or ease, or pleasure. They were called Puritans because they wished to purify the Church of England from what seemed to them great abuses; and the purpose of these men in emigrating to America was to lay the foundations of a state built upon their religious principles. These people came for an intangible something--liberty of conscience, a fuller life of the spirit--which has never commanded a price on any stock exchange in the world. They looked beyond 

  Things done that took the eye and had the price;
     O'er which, from level stand,
     The low world laid its hand,
   Found straightway to its mind, could value in a trice.

These Puritans had been more than one century in the making. We hear of them in the time of Wycliffe (1324-1384). Henry VIII formed the Church of England in 1534. Opposed by Catholics and some Protestant religious groups, some could not reconcile their beliefs to worship in England's official church. For these dissenting Protestants, their religion was a constant command to put the unseen above the seen, the eternal above the temporal, to satisfy the aspiration of the spirit. They would not accommodate the perceived &quot;Romishe taint&quot; that remained in the Church of England. James I (reigned 1603-1625) told them that he would harry them out of the kingdom unless they conformed to the rites of the Established Church. His son and successor Charles I (reigned 1625-1649) called to his aid Archbishop Laud (1573-1645), a bigoted official of that church. Laud hunted the dissenting clergy like wild beasts, threw them into prison, whipped them in the pillory, branded them, slit their nostrils, and mutilated their ears. John Cotton, pastor of the church of Boston, England, was told that if he had been guilty only of an infraction of certain of the Ten Commandments, he might have been pardoned, but since his crime was Puritanism, he must suffer. He had great trouble in escaping on a ship bound for the New England Boston.

Professor Tyler says: &quot;New England has perhaps never quite appreciated its great obligations to Archbishop Laud. It was his overmastering hate of nonconformity, it was the vigilance and vigor and consecrated cruelty with which he scoured his own diocese and afterward all England, and hunted down and hunted out the ministers who were committing the unpardonable sin of
dissent, that conferred upon the principal colonies of New England their ablest and noblest men.&quot;

It should be noted that the Puritan colonization of New England took place in a comparatively brief space of time, during the twenty years from 1620 to 1640. Until 1640 persecution drove the Puritans to New England in multitudes, but in that year they suddenly stopped coming. &quot;During the one hundred and twenty-five years following that date, more persons, it is supposed, went back from the New to the Old England than came from the Old England to the New,&quot; says Professor Tyler. The year 1640 marks the
assembling of the Long Parliament, which finally brought to the block both Archbishop Laud (1645) and King Charles I (1649), and chose the great Puritan, Oliver Cromwell, to lead the Commonwealth.

===Elizabethan Traits===

The leading men in the colonization of Virginia and New England were born in the reign of Queen Elizabeth (1558-1603), and they
and their descendants showed on this side of the Atlantic those characteristics which made the Elizabethan age preeminent.

In the first place, the Elizabethans possessed initiative. This power consists, first, in having ideas, and secondly, in passing from the ideas to the suggested action. Some people merely dream. The Elizabethans dreamed glorious dreams, which they translated into action. They defeated the Spanish Armada; they circumnavigated the globe; they made it possible for
Shakespeare's pen to mold the thought and to influence the actions of the world.

If we except those indentured servants and apprentices who came to America merely because others brought them, we shall find not only that the first colonists were born in an age distinguished for its initiative, but also that they came because they possessed this characteristic in a greater degree than those who remained behind. It was easier for the majority to stay with their friends; hence England was not depopulated. The few came, those who had sufficient initiative to cross three thousand miles of unknown sea, who had the power to dream dreams of a new commonwealth, and the will to embody those dreams in action.

In the second place, the Elizabethans were ingenious, that is, they were imaginative and resourceful. Impelled by the mighty forces of the Reformation and the Revival of Learning which the England of Elizabeth alone felt at one and the same time, the Elizabethans craved and obtained variety of experience, which kept the fountainhead of ingenuity filled. It is instructive to follow the lives of Elizabethans as different as Sir Philip Sidney, William Shakespeare, Sir Walter Raleigh, Captain John Smith, and John Winthrop, and to note the varied experiences of each. Yankee ingenuity had an Elizabethan ancestry. The hard conditions of the New World merely gave an opportunity to exercise to the utmost an ingenuity which the colonists brought with them.

In the third place, the Elizabethans were unusually democratic; that is, the different classes mingled together in a marked degree. This intermingling was due in part to increased travel, to the desire born of the New Learning, to live as varied and as complete a life as possible, and to the absence of overspecialization among individuals. This chance for varied experience with all sorts and conditions of men enabled Shakespeare to speak to all humanity. All England was represented in his plays. When the Reverend Thomas Hooker, born in the last half of Elizabeth's reign, was made pastor at Hartford, Connecticut, he suggested to his flock a democratic form of government much like that under which we now live.

Let us remember that American life and literature owe their most interesting traits to these three Elizabethan qualities: initiative, ingenuity, and democracy. Let us not forget that the Cambridge University graduate, the cooper, cloth-maker, printer, and blacksmith had the initiative to set out for the New World, the ingenuity to deal with its varied exigencies, and the democratic spirit that enabled them to work side by side, no matter how diverse their former trades, modes of life, and
social condition.

==Captain John Smith (1579-1631)==

The hero of the Jamestown colony, and its savior during the first two years, was Captain John Smith, born in Willoughby, Lincolnshire, in 1579, twenty-four years before the death of Elizabeth and thirty-seven before the death of Shakespeare. Smith was a man of Elizabethan stamp: active, ingenious, imaginative, craving new experiences. While a mere boy, he could not stand the tediousness of ordinary life, and so betook himself to the forest where he could hunt and play knight.

In the first part of his young manhood he crossed the Channel, voyaged in the Mediterranean, fought the Turks, killing three of them in single combat, was taken prisoner and enslaved by the Tartars, killed his inhuman master, escaped into Russia, went thence through Europe to Africa, was in desperate naval battles, returned to England, sailing thence for Virginia, which he reached at the age of twenty-eight.

He soon became president of the Jamestown colony and labored strenuously for its preservation. The first product of his pen in America was ''A True Relation of Virginia'', written in 1608, the year in which John Milton was born. The last work written by Smith in America is entitled: ''A Map of Virginia, with a Description of the Country, the Commodities, People, Government, and Religion''. His description of the Indians shows his capacity for quickly noting their traits:
  They are inconstant in everything, but what fear constraineth them to
  keep. Crafty, timorous, quick of apprehension and very ingenious. Some
  are of disposition fearful, some bold, most cautious, all savage.
  Generally covetous of copper, beads, and such like trash. They are soon
  moved to anger, and so malicious that they seldom forget an injury: they
  seldom steal one from another, lest their conjurors should reveal it, and
  so they be pursued and punished. That they are thus feared is certain,
  but that any can reveal their offences by conjuration I am doubtful.
Smith has often been accused of boasting, and some have said that he was guilty of great exaggeration or something worse, but it is certain that he repeatedly braved hardships, extreme dangers, and captivity among the Indians to provide food for the colony and to survey Virginia. After carefully editing ''Captain John Smith's Works'' in a volume of 983 pages, Professor Edwin Arber says: &quot;For [our] own part, beginning with doubtfulness and wariness we have gradually come to the unhesitating conviction, not only of Smith's truthfulness, but also that, in regard to all personal matters, he systematically understates rather than exaggerates anything he did.&quot;

Although by far the greater part of Smith's literary work was done after he returned to England, yet his two booklets written in America entitle him to a place in colonial literature. He had the Elizabethan love of achievement, and he records his admiration for those whose 'pens writ what their swords did.' He was not an artist with his pen, but our early colonial literature is the richer for his rough narrative and for the description of Virginia and the Indians.

In one sense he gave the Indian to literature, and that is his greatest achievement in literary history. Who has not heard the story of his capture by the Indians, of his rescue from torture and death, by the beautiful Indian maiden, Pocahontas, of her risking her life to save him a second time from Indian treachery, of her bringing corn and preserving the colony from famine, of her visit to England in 1616, a few weeks after the death of Shakespeare, of her royal reception as a princess, the daughter of an Indian king, of Smith's meeting her again in London, where their romantic story aroused the admiration of the court and the citizens for the brown-eyed princess? It would be difficult to say how many tales of Indian adventure this romantic story of Pocahontas has suggested. It has the honor of being the first of its kind written in the English tongue.

Did Pocahontas actually rescue Captain Smith? In his account of his adventures, written in Virginia in 1608, he does not mention this rescue, but in his later writings he relates it as an actual occurrence. When Pocahontas visited London, this story was current, and there is no evidence that she denied it. Professor Arber says, &quot;To deny the truth of the Pocahontas incident is to create more difficulties than are involved in its acceptance.&quot; But literature does not need to ask whether the story of Hamlet or of Pocahontas is true. If this unique story of American adventure is a product of Captain Smith's creative imagination, the literary critic must admit the captain's superior ability in producing a tale of such vitality. If the story is true, then our literature does well to remember whose pen made this truth one of the most persistent of our early romantic heritages. He is as well known for the story of Pocahontas as for all of his other achievements. The man who saved the Virginia colony and who first suggested a new field to the writer of American romance is rightly considered one of the most striking figures in our early history, even if he did return to England in less than three years and end his days there in 1631.

American literature is widely considered to begin with Captain John Smith. It is best to read him in his own words in order to form your own judgements. Fortunatley, his works are available for free on the Internet.

==WILLIAM STRACHEY (1572-1621)==

Captain James Smith was not the only Englishman writing in the colonies in the early seventeenth century. William Strachey, a contemporary of Shakespeare and secretary of the Virginian colony, wrote at Jamestown and sent to London in 1610 the manuscript of ''A True Repertory of the Wrack and Redemption of Sir Thomas Gates, Kt., upon and from the Islands of the Bermudas''. This is a story of shipwreck on the Bermudas and of escape in small boats. The book is memorable for the description of a storm at sea, and it is possible that it may even have furnished suggestions to Shakespeare for ''The Tempest''. If so, it is interesting to compare these with what they produced in Shakespeare's mind. Strachey tells how &quot;the sea swelled above the clouds and gave battle unto heaven.&quot; He speaks of &quot;an apparition of a little round light, like a faint star, trembling and streaming along with a sparkling blaze, half the height upon the main mast, and shooting sometimes from shroud to shroud.&quot; Ariel says to Prospero:

  &quot;I boarded the king's ship; now on the beak,
   Now in the waist, the deck, in every cabin,
   I flam'd amazement: Sometimes I'ld divide,
   And burn in many places; on the topmast,
   The yards, and bowsprit, would I flame distinctly,
   Then meet and join.&quot;

Strachey voices the current belief that the Bermudas were harassed by tempests, devils, wicked spirits, and other fearful objects. Shakespeare as Ferdinand with fewer words intensify Strachey's picture:

  &quot;Hell is empty,
   And all the devils are here.&quot;

The possibility that incidents arising out of Virginian colonization may have turned Shakespeare's attention to &quot;the still vex'd Bermoothes&quot; and given him suggestions for one of his great plays lends added interest to Strachey's True Repertory. But, aside from Shakespeare, this has an interest of its own. It has the Anglo-Saxon touch in depicting the wrath of the sea, and it shows the character of the early American colonists who braved a wrath like this.

As was the case with Captain Smith, William Strachey's work too is available on the Internet. Enjoy reading your fill and we'll see you upon your return.

==POETRY IN THE VIRGINIA COLONY==

===George Sandys (1577-1644)=== 
During his stay in the colony as its treasurer, he translated ten books of Ovid's ''Metamorphoses'', sometimes working by the light of a pine knot. This work is rescued from the class of mere translation by its literary art and imaginative interpretation, and it possesses for us an additional interest because of its nativity amid such surroundings. Two lines telling how Philemon

  &quot;Took down a flitch of bacon with a prung,
   That long had in the smoky chimney hung,&quot;

show that his environment aided him somewhat in the translation. He himself says of this version that it was &quot;bred in the new world, whereof it cannot but participate, especially having wars and tumults to bring it to light, instead of the muses.&quot; He was read by both Dryden and Pope in their boyhood, and the form of their verse shows his influence.

The only original poem which merits our attention in the early Virginian colony was found soon after the Revolutionary War in a collection of manuscripts, known as the ''Burwell Papers''. This poem is an elegy on the death of Nathaniel Bacon (1676), a young Virginian patriot and military hero, who resisted the despotic governor, Sir William Berkeley. It was popularly believed that Bacon's mysterious death was due to poison. An unknown friend wrote the elegy in defense of Bacon and his rebellion. These
lines from that elegy show a strength unusual in colonial poetry:

                             &quot;Virginia's foes,
  To whom, for secret crimes, just vengeance owes
  Deserved plagues, dreading their just desert,
  Corrupted death by Paracelsian art,
  Him to destroy . . .
  Our arms, though ne'er so strong,
  Will want the aid of his commanding tongue,
  Which conquered more than Caesar.&quot;

==DESCRIPTIONS OF VIRGINIA==
===Robert Beverly=== 
Clerk of the Council of Virginia, he published in London in 1705 a ''History and Present State of Virginia''. This is today a readable account of the colony and its people in the first part of the eighteenth century. This selection shows that in those early days Virginians were noted for what has come to be known as southern hospitality:

  &quot;The inhabitants are very courteous to travellers, who need no other
  recommendation, but the being human creatures. A stranger has no more to
  do, but to inquire upon the road where any gentleman or good housekeeper
  lives, and there he may depend upon being received with hospitality. This
  good nature is so general among their people, that the gentry, when they
  go abroad, order their principal servant to entertain all visitors with
  everything the plantation affords. And the poor planters who have but one
  bed, will very often sit up, or lie upon a form or couch all night, to
  make room for a weary traveller to repose himself after his journey.&quot;

===Colonel William Byrd (1674-1744)=== 
A wealthy Virginian, he was commissioned by the Virginian colony to run a line between it and North Carolina. He then wrote a ''History of the Dividing Line run in the Year 1728''. This book is a record of personal experiences, and is as interesting as its title is forbidding. This selection describes the Dismal Swamp, through which the line ran:

  &quot;Since the surveyors had entered the Dismal they had laid eyes on no
  living creature; neither bird nor beast, insect nor reptile came in view.
  Doubtless the eternal shade that broods over this mighty bog and hinders
  the sunbeams from blessing the ground, makes it an uncomfortable
  habitation for anything that has life. Not so much as a Zealand frog
  could endure so aguish a situation. It had one beauty, however, that
  delighted the eye, though at the expense of all the other senses: the
  moisture of the soil preserves a continual verdure, and makes every plant
  an evergreen, but at the same time the foul damps ascend without ceasing,
  corrupt the air, and render it unfit for respiration. Not even a turkey
  buzzard will venture to fly over it, no more than the Italian vultures
  will fly over the filthy lake Avernus or the birds in the Holy Land over
  the salt sea where Sodom and Gomorrah formerly stood.

  &quot;In these sad circumstances the kindest thing we could do for our
  suffering friends was to give them a place in the Litany. Our chaplain
  for his part did his office and rubbed us up with a seasonable sermon.
  This was quite a new thing to our brethren of North Carolina, who live in
  a climate where no clergyman can breathe, any more than spiders in
  Ireland.&quot;

These two selections show that American literature, even before the Revolution, came to be something more than an imitation of English literature. No critic could say that they might as well have been written in London as in Virginia. They also show how much eighteenth-century prose had improved in form. Even in England, modern prose may almost be said to begin with John Dryden, who died at the beginning of the eighteenth century. In addition to improvement in form, we may note the appearance of a new quality: humor. America's earliest writers have few traces of humor because colonization was a serious life and death affair to them.

==DIFFERENT LINES OF DEVELOPMENT OF VIRGINIA AND NEW ENGLAND==

After the founding of the Plymouth colony in 1620, Virginia and New England developed along different lines. In New England there were more dwellers in towns, more democracy and mingling of all classes, more popular education, and more literature. The ruling classes of Virginia were mostly descendants of the Cavaliers who had sympathized with monarchy, while the Puritans had fought the Stuart kings and had approved a Commonwealth. In Virginia a wealthy class of landed gentry came to be an increasing power in the political history of the country. The ancestors of George Washington and many others who did inestimable service to the nation were among this class. It was long the fashion for this aristocracy to send their children to England to be educated, while the Puritans trained theirs at home.

New England started a printing press, and was printing books by 1640. In 1671 Sir William Berkeley, governor of Virginia, wrote, &quot;I thank God there are no free schools, nor printing, and I hope we shall not have these hundred years; for learning has brought disobedience and heresy and sects into the world, and printing has developed them.&quot;

Producers of literature need the stimulus of town life. The South was chiefly agricultural. The plantations were large, and the people lived in far greater isolation than in New England, where not only the town, but more especially the church, developed a close social unit.

One other reason served to make it difficult for a poet of the plowman type, like Robert Burns, or for an author from the general working class, like Benjamin Franklin, to arise in the South. Labor was thought degrading, and the laborer did not find the same chance as at the North to learn from close association with the intelligent class.

The reason for this is given by Colonel William Byrd, from whom we have quoted in the preceding section. He wrote in 1736 of the leading men of the South:

  &quot;They import so many negroes hither, that I fear this Colony will some
  time or other be confirmed by the name of New Guinea. I am sensible of
  many bad consequences of multiplying these Ethiopians amongst us. They
  blow up the pride and ruin the industry of our white people, who seeing a
  rank of poor creatures below them, detest work, for fear it should make
  them look like slaves.&quot;

==WILLIAM BRADFORD (1590-1657)==

William Bradford was born in 1590 in the Pilgrim district of England, in the Yorkshire village of Austerfield, two miles north of Scrooby. While a child, he attended the religious meetings of the Puritans. At the age of eighteen he gave up a good position in the post service of England, and crossed to Holland to escape religious persecution. His ''History of
Plymouth Plantation'' is not a record of the Puritans as a whole, but only of that branch known as the Pilgrims, who left England for Holland in 1607 and 1608, and who, after remaining there for nearly twelve years, had the initiative to be the first of their band to come to the New World, and to settle at Plymouth in 1620.

For more than thirty years he was governor of the Plymouth colony, and he managed its affairs with the discretion of a Washington and the zeal of a Cromwell. His ''History'' tells the story of the Pilgrim Fathers from the time of the formation of their two congregations in England, until 1647.

In 1897 the United States for the first time came into possession of the manuscript of this famous ''History of Plymouth Plantation'', which had in some mysterious manner been taken from Boston in colonial times and had found its way into the library of the Lord Bishop of London. Few of the English seem to have read it. Even its custodian miscalled it The Log of
the Mayflower, although after the ship finally cleared from England, only five incidents of the voyage are briefly mentioned: the death of a young seaman who cursed the Pilgrims on the voyage and made sport of their misery; the cracking of one of the main beams of the ship; the washing overboard in a storm of a good young man who was providentially saved; the death of a servant; and the sight of Cape Cod. On petition, the Lord Bishop of London generously gave this manuscript of 270 pages to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. In a speech at the time of its formal reception, Senator Hoar eloquently summed up the subject matter of the volume as follows:

  &quot;I do not think many Americans will gaze upon it without a little
  trembling of the lips and a little gathering of mist in the eyes, as they
  think of the story of suffering, of sorrow, of peril, of exile, of death,
  and of lofty triumph which that book tells,--which the hand of the great
  leader and founder of America has traced on those pages. There is nothing
  like it in human annals since the story of Bethlehem. These Englishmen
  and English women going out from their homes in beautiful Lincoln and
  York, wife separated from husband and mother from child in that hurried
  embarkation for Holland, pursued to the beach by English horsemen; the
  thirteen years of exile; the life at Amsterdam, 'in alley foul and lane
  obscure'; the dwelling at Leyden; the embarkation at Delfthaven; the
  farewell of Robinson; the terrible voyage across the Atlantic; the
  compact in the harbor; the landing on the rock; the dreadful first
  winter; the death roll of more than half the number; the days of
  suffering and of famine; the wakeful night, listening for the yell of
  wild beast and the war whoop of the savage; the building of the State on
  those sure foundations which no wave or tempest has ever shaken; the
  breaking of the new light; the dawning of the new day; the beginning of
  the new life; the enjoyment of peace with liberty,--of all these things
  this is the original record by the hand of our beloved father and
  founder.&quot;

In addition to giving matter of unique historical importance, Bradford entertains his readers with an account of Squanto, the Pilgrims' tame Indian, of Miles Standish capturing the &quot;lord of misrule&quot; at Merrymount, and of the failure of an experiment in tilling the soil in common. Bradford says that there was immediate improvement when each family received the full returns from working its own individual plot of ground. He thus philosophizes about this social experiment of the Pilgrims:

  &quot;The experience that was had in this common course and condition, tried
  sundry years, and that amongst godly and sober men, may well evince the
  vanity of that conceit of Plato's and other ancients, applauded by some
  of later times;----that the taking away of property and bringing in
  community into a common wealth would make them happy and flourishing....
  Let none object this is men's corruption, and nothing to the course
  itself. I answer, seeing all men have this corruption in them, God in his
  wisdom saw another course fitter for them.&quot;

Both the subject matter of the early colonial prose in this manuscript compare favirably with that produced in England at the same time.

==JOHN WINTHROP (1588-1649)==

On March 29, 1630, John Winthrop made the first entry in his ''Journal'' on board the ship Arbella, before she left the Isle of Wight for Massachusetts Bay. This ''Journal'' was to continue until a few months before his death in 1649, and was in after times to receive the dignified name of ''History of New England'', although it might more properly still be called his
''Journal'', as its latest editor does indeed style it.

John Winthrop was born in the County of Suffolk, England, in 1588, the year of the defeat of the Spanish Armada. He was a wealthy, well-educated Puritan, the owner of broad estates. As he paced the deck of the ''Arbella'', the night before he sailed for Massachusetts, he knew that he was leaving comfort, home, friends, position, all for liberty of conscience. Few men
have ever voluntarily abandoned more than Winthrop, or clung more tenaciously to their ideals.

After a voyage lasting more than two months, he settled with a large number of Puritans on the site of modern Boston. For the principal part of the time from his arrival in 1630 until his death in 1649, he served as governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Not many civil leaders of any age have shown more sagacity, patriotism, and tireless devotion to duty than
John Winthrop.

His ''Journal'' is a record of contemporaneous events from 1630 to 1648. The early part of this work might with some justice have been called the ''Log of the Arbella''.

TRANSLITERATION OF FACSIMILE OF WINTHROP'S &quot;JOURNAL&quot;
ANNO DOMINI 1630, MARCH 29, MONDAY. EASTER MONDAY.

  &quot;Riding at the Cowes, near the Isle of Wight, in the _Arbella_,
  a ship of 350 tons, whereof Capt. Peter Milborne was master, being
  manned with 52 seamen, and 28 pieces of ordnance, (the wind coming to
  the N. by W. the evening before,) in the morning there came aboard us
  Mr. Cradock, the late governor, and the masters of his 2 ships, Capt.
  John Lowe, master of the _Ambrose_, and Mr. Nicholas Hurlston,
  master of the _Jewel_, and Mr. Thomas Beecher, master of the
  ''Talbot''.&quot;

The entry for Monday, April 12, 1630, is:

  &quot;The wind more large to the N. a stiff gale, with fair weather. In the
  afternoon less wind, and our people began to grow well again. Our
  children and others, that were sick and lay groaning in the cabins, we
  fetched out, and having stretched a rope from the steerage to the
  main-mast, we made them stand, some of one side and some of the other,
  and sway it up and down till they were warm, and by this means they soon
  grew well and merry.&quot;

The following entry for June 5, 1644, reflects an interesting side light on the government of Harvard, our first American college:

  &quot;Two of our ministers' sons, being students in the college, robbed two
  dwelling houses in the night of some fifteen pounds. Being found out,
  they were ordered by the governors of the college to be there whipped,
  which was performed by the president himself--yet they were about twenty
  years of age; and after they were brought into the court and ordered to
  twofold satisfaction, or to serve so long for it. We had yet no
  particular punishment for burglary.&quot;

Another entry for 1644 tells of one William Franklin, condemned for causing the death of his apprentice:

  &quot;The case was this. He had taken to apprentice one Nathaniel Sewell, one
  of those children sent over the last year for the country; the boy had
  the scurvy and was withal very noisome, and otherwise ill disposed. His
  master used him with continual rigour and unmerciful correction, and
  exposed him many times to much cold and wet in the winter season, and
  used divers acts of rigour towards him, as hanging him in the chimney,
  etc., and the boy being very poor and weak, he tied him upon an horse and
  so brought him (sometimes sitting and sometimes hanging down) to Boston,
  being five miles off, to the magistrates, and by the way the boy calling
  much for water, would give him none, though he came close by it, so as
  the boy was near dead when he came to Boston, and died within a few hours
  after.&quot;

Winthrop relates how Franklin appealed the case when he was found guilty, and how the Puritans inflicted the death penalty on him after searching the ''Bible'' for a rule on which to base their decision. The most noticeable qualities of this terrible story are its simplicity, its repression, its lack of striving after effect. Winthrop, Bradford, and Bunyan had learned
from the 1611 version of the ''Bible'' to be content to present any situation as simply as possible and to rely on the facts themselves to secure the effect.

Winthrop's finest piece of prose, ''Concerning Liberty'', appears in an entry for the year 1645. He defines liberty as the power &quot;to do that which is good, just, and honest. This liberty you are to stand for, with the hazard, not only of your goods, but of your lives, if need be.&quot; Winthrop saw clearly what many since his day have failed to see, that a government conducted by the people could not endure, if liberty meant more than this.

Winthrop's ''Journal'' records almost anything which seemed important to the colonists. Thus, he tells about storms, fires, peculiar deaths of animals, crimes, trials, Indians, labor troubles, arrival of ships, trading expeditions, troubles with England about the charter, politics, church matters, events that would point a moral, like the selfish refusal of the
authorities to loan a quantity of gunpowder to the Plymouth colony and the subsequent destruction of that same powder by an explosion, or the drowning of a child in the well while the parents were visiting on Sunday. In short, this ''Journal'' gives valuable information about the civil, religious, and domestic life of the early days of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. The art of modern prose writing was known neither in England nor in America in Winthrop's time. The wonder is that he told the story of this colony in such good form and that he still holds the interest of the reader so well.

==THE RELIGIOUS IDEAL==

William Bradford and John Winthrop were governors of two religious commonwealths. We must not forget that the Puritans came to America to secure a higher form of spiritual life. In the reign of Elizabeth, it was thought that the Revival of Learning would cure all ills and unlock the gates of happiness. This hope had met with disappointment. Then Puritanism came, and ushered in a new era of spiritual aspiration for something better, nobler, and more satisfying than mere intellectual attainments or wealth or earthly power had been able to secure.

The Puritans chose the ''Bible'' as the guidebook to their Promised Land. The long sermons to which they listened were chiefly biblical expositions. The Puritans considered the saving of the soul the most important matter, and they neglected whatever form of culture did not directly tend toward that result. They thought that entertaining reading and other forms of amusement
were contrivances of the devil to turn the soul's attention away from the ''Bible''. Even beauty and art were considered handmaids of the Evil One. The ''Bible'' was read, reread, and constantly studied, and it took the place of secular poetry and prose.

The New England Puritan believed in the theology of John Calvin, who died in 1564. His creed, known as Calvinism, emphasized the importance of the individual, of life's continuous moral struggle, which would land each soul in heaven or hell for all eternity. In the ''New England Primer'', the children were taught the first article of belief, as they learned the letter A:

  &quot;In Adam's fall,
   We sinned all.&quot;

Calvinism stressed the doctrine of foreordination, that certain ones, &quot;the elect,&quot; had been foreordained to be saved. Thomas Shephard (1605-1649), one of the great Puritan clergy, fixed the mathematical ratio of the damned to the elect as &quot;a thousand to one.&quot; On the physical side, scientists have pointed out a close correspondence between Calvin's creed and the theory of
evolution, which emphasizes the desperate struggle resulting from the survival of the fittest. The &quot;fittest&quot; are the &quot;elect&quot;; those who perish in the contest, the &quot;damned.&quot; In the evolutionary struggle, only the few survive, while untold numbers of the unfit, no matter whether seeds of plants, eggs of fish, human beings, or any other form of life, go to the wall.

In spite of the apparent contradiction between free will and foreordination, each individual felt himself fully responsible for the saving of his soul. A firm belief in this tremendous responsibility made each one rise the stronger to meet the other responsibilities of life. Civil responsibility seemed easier to one reared in this school. The initiative bequeathed by Elizabethan times was increased by the Puritans' religion.

Although there were probably as many university men in proportion to the population in early colonial Massachusetts as in England, the strength and direction of their religious ideals helped to turn their energy into activities outside the field of pure literature. In course of time, however, Nathaniel Hawthorne appeared to give lasting literary expression to this life.

==THE NEW ENGLAND CLERGY==

The clergy occupied a leading place in both the civil and religious life of New England. They were men of energy and ability, who could lead their congregations to Holland or to the wilds of New England. For the purpose in hand the world has never seen superior leaders. Many of them were graduates of Cambridge University, England. Their great authority was based on character, education, and natural ability. A contemporary historian said of John Cotton, who came as pastor from the old to the new Boston in 1633, that whatever he &quot;delivered in the pulpit was soon put into an order of court ... or set up as a practice in
the church.&quot;

The sermons, from two to four hours long, took the place of magazines, newspapers, and modern musical and theatrical entertainments. The church members were accustomed to hard thinking and they enjoyed it as a mental exercise. Their minds had not been rendered flabby by such a diet of miscellaneous trash or sensational matter as confronts modern readers. Many
of the congregation went with notebooks to record the different heads and the most striking thoughts in the sermon, such, for instance, as the following on the dangers of idleness:

  &quot;Whilst the stream keeps running, it keeps clear; but let it stand still,
  it breeds frogs and toads and all manner of filth. So while you keep
  going, you keep clear.&quot;

The sermons were often doctrinal, metaphysical, and extremely dry, but it is a mistake to conclude that the clergy did not speak on topics of current interest. Winthrop in his ''Journal'' for 1639 relates how the Rev. John Cotton discussed whether a certain shopkeeper, who had been arraigned before the court for extortion, for having taken &quot;in some small things, above two for one,&quot; was guilty of sin and should be excommunicated from the church, or only publicly admonished. Cotton prescribed admonition and he laid down a code of ethics for the guidance of sellers.

With the exception of Roger Williams (1604?-1683), who had the modern point of view in insisting on complete &quot;soul liberty,&quot; on the right of every man to think as he pleased on matters of religion, the Puritan clergy were not tolerant of other forms of worship. They said that they came to New England in order to worship God as they pleased. They never made the slightest
pretense of establishing a commonwealth where another could worship as he pleased, because they feared that such a privilege might lead to a return of the persecution from which they had fled. If those came who thought differently about religion, they were told that there was sufficient room elsewhere, in Rhode Island, for instance, whither Roger Williams went after
he was banished from Salem. The history of the Puritan clergy would have been more pleasing had they been more tolerant, less narrow, more modern, like Roger Williams. Yet perhaps it is best not to complain overmuch of the strange and somewhat repellent architecture of the bridge which bore us over the stream dividing the desert of royal and ecclesiastical tyranny
from the Promised Land of our Republic. Let us not forget that the clergy insisted on popular education; that wherever there was a clergyman, there was almost certain to be a school, even if he had to teach it himself, and that the clergy generally spoke and acted as if they would rather be &quot;free among the dead than slaves among the living.&quot;

==POETRY==

The trend of Puritan theology and the hard conditions of life did not encourage the production of poetry. The Puritans even wondered if singing in church was not an exercise which turned the mind from God. The Reverend John Cotton investigated the question carefully under four main heads and six subheads, and he cited scriptural authority to show that Paul and Silas
(''Acts'', xvi., 25) had sung a ''Psalm'' in the prison. Cotton therefore concluded that the ''Psalms'' might be sung in church.

BAY PSALM BOOK

&quot;The divines in the country&quot; joined to translate &quot;into English metre&quot; the whole book of ''Psalms'' from the original Hebrew, and they probably made the worst metrical translation in existence. In their preface to this work, known as the ''Bay Psalm Book'' (1640), the first book of verse printed in the British American colonies, they explained that they did not strive for a more poetic translation because &quot;God's altar needs not our polishings.&quot; The following verses from Psalm 87 are a sample of the so-called metrical translation which the Puritans sang:

  &quot;1. The rivers on of Babilon
        there-when wee did sit downe:
      yea even then wee mourned, when
        wee remembred Sion.

  &quot;2. Our Harps wee did it hang amid,
        upon the willow tree.

  &quot;3. Because there they that us away
        led in captivitee,
      Requir'd of us a song, &amp; thus
        askt mirth: us waste who laid,
      sing us among a Sion's song,
        unto us then they said.&quot;

==MICHAEL WIGGLESWORTH (1631-1705)==

This Harvard graduate and Puritan preacher published in 1662 a poem setting forth some of the tenets of Calvinistic theology. This poem, entitled ''The Day of Doom, or a Poetical Description of the Great and Last Judgment'', had the largest circulation of any colonial poem. The following lines represent a throng of infants at the left hand of the final Judge, pleading against the sentence of infant damnation:

  &quot;'Not we, but he ate of the tree,
      whose fruit was interdicted;
    Yet on us all of his sad fall
      the punishment's inflicted.
    How could we sin that had not been,
      or how is his sin our,
    Without consent, which to prevent
      we never had the pow'r?'&quot;

Wigglesworth represents the Almighty as replying:

  &quot;'You sinners are, and such a share
      as sinners may expect;
    Such you shall have, for I do save
      none but mine own Elect.
    Yet to compare your sin with their
      who liv'd a longer time,
    I do confess yours is much less,
      though every sin's a crime.

  &quot;'A crime it is, therefore in bliss
      you may not hope to dwell;
    But unto you I shall allow
      the easiest room in Hell.'&quot;

When we read verse like this, we realize how fortunate the Puritanism of Old England was to have one great poet schooled in the love of both morality and beauty. John Milton's poetry shows not only his sublimity and high ideals, but also his admiration for beauty, music, and art. Wigglesworth's verse is inferior to much of the ballad doggerel, but it has a swing and a directness fitted to catch the popular ear and to lodge in the memory. While some of his work seems humorous to us, it would not have made that impression on the early Puritans. At the same time, we must not rely on verse like this for our understanding of their outlook on life and death. Beside Wigglesworth's lines we should place the epitaph, &quot;Reserved for a Glorious Resurrection,&quot; composed by the great orthodox Puritan clergyman, Cotton Mather (p. 46), for his own infant, which died unbaptized when four days old. It is well to remember that both the Puritans and their clergy had a quiet way of believing that God had reserved to himself the final interpretation of his own word.

==ANNE BRADSTREET (1612-1672)==

Colonial New England's best poet, or &quot;The Tenth Muse,&quot; as she was called by her friends, was a daughter of the Puritan governor, Thomas Dudley, and became the wife of another Puritan governor, Simon Bradstreet, with whom she came to New England in 1630. Although she was born before the death of Shakespeare, she seems never to have studied the works of that great dramatist. Her models were what Milton called the &quot;fantastics,&quot; a school of poets who mistook for manifestations of poetic power, far-fetched and strained metaphors, oddities of expression, remote comparisons, conceits, and strange groupings of thought. She had especially studied Sylvester's paraphrase of ''The Divine Weeks and Works'' of the French poet Du Bartas, and probably also the works of poets like George Herbert (1593-1633), of the English fantastic school. This paraphrase of Du Bartas was published in a folio of 1215 pages, a few years before Mrs. Bradstreet came to America. This book shows the taste which prevailed in England in the latter part of the first third of the seventeenth century, before Milton came into the ascendancy. The fantastic comparison between the &quot;Spirit Eternal,&quot; brooding upon chaos, and a hen, is shown in these lines from Du Bartas:

  &quot;Or as a Hen that fain would hatch a brood
   (Some of her own, some of adoptive blood)
   Sits close thereon, and with her lively heat,
   Of yellow-white balls, doth live birds beget:
   Even in such sort seemed the Spirit Eternal
   To brood upon this Gulf with care paternal.&quot;

A contemporary critic thought that he was giving her early work high praise when he called her &quot;a right Du Bartas girl.&quot; One of her early poems is ''The Four Elements'', where Fire, Air, Earth, and Water

     &quot;... did contest
  Which was the strongest, noblest, and the best,
  Who was of greatest use and mightiest force.&quot;

Such a debate could never be decided, but the subject was well suited to he fantastic school of poets because it afforded an opportunity for much ingenuity of argument and for far-fetched comparisons, which led nowhere.

Late in life, in her poem, ''Contemplations'', she wrote some genuine poetry, little marred by imitation of the fantastic school. Spenser seems to have become her master in later years. No one without genuine poetic ability could have written such lines as:

  &quot;I heard the merry grasshopper then sing,
     The black-clad cricket bear a second part,
   They kept one tune, and played on the same string,
     Seeming to glory in their little art.&quot;

These lines show both poetic ease and power:

  &quot;The mariner that on smooth waves doth glide
     Sings merrily, and steers his bark with ease,
   As if he had command of wind and tide,
     And now become great master of the seas.&quot;

The comparative excellence of her work in such an atmosphere and amid the domestic cares incident to rearing eight children is remarkable.

==NATHANIEL WARD (c.1578-1652)==

In 1647, Nathaniel Ward, who had been educated for the law, but who afterward became a clergyman, published a strange work known as ''The Simple Cobbler of Agawam, in America'' &quot;willing,&quot; as the sub-title continues, &quot;to help mend his native country, lamentably tattered, both in the upper leather and sole, with all the honest stitches he can take.&quot; He had been assistant pastor at Agawam (Ipswich) until ill health caused him to resign. He then busied himself in compiling a code of laws and in other writing before he returned to England in 1647. The following two sentences from his unique book show two points of the religious faith of the Puritans: (1) the belief in a personal devil always actively seeking the destruction of mankind, and (2) the assumption that the vitals of the &quot;elect&quot; are safe from the mortal sting of sin.

  &quot;Satan is now in his passions, he feels his passion approaching, he loves
  to fish in roiled waters. Though that dragon cannot sting the vitals of
  the elect mortally, yet that Beelzebub can fly-blow their intellectuals
  miserably.&quot;

He is often a bitter satirist, a sort of colonial Carlyle, as this attack on woman shows:

  &quot;I honor the woman that can honor herself with her attire; a good text
  always deserves a fair margent; I am not much offended if I see a trim
  far trimmer than she that wears it. In a word, whatever Christianity or
  civility will allow, I can afford with London measure: but when I hear a
  nugiperous gentledame inquire what dress the Queen is in this week: what
  the nudiustertian fashion of the Court; I mean the very newest; with egg
  to be in it in all haste, whatever it be; I look at her as the very
  gizzard of a trifle, the product of a quarter of a cipher, the epitome of
  nothing, fitter to be kicked, if she were of a kickable substance, than
  either honored or humored.&quot;

He does not hesitate to coin a word. The preceding short selection introduces us to &quot;nugiperous&quot; and &quot;nudiustertian.&quot; Next, he calls the women's tailor-made gowns &quot;the very pettitoes of infirmity, the giblets of perquisquilian toys.&quot;
 
The spirit of a reformer always sees work to be done, and Ward emphasized three remedies for mid-seventeenth-century ills: (1) Stop toleration of departure from religious truth; (2) banish the frivolities of women and men; and (3) bring the civil war in England to a just end. In proportion to the population, his ''Simple Cobbler'', designed to mend human ways, was probably as widely read as Carlyle's ''Sartor Resartus'' in later days.

In criticism, Ward deserves to be remembered for these two lines:

  &quot;Poetry's a gift wherein but few excel;
   He doth very ill that doth not passing well.&quot;

==SAMUEL SEWALL (1652-1730)==

There was born in 1652 at Bishopstoke, Hampshire, England, a boy who sailed for New England when he was nine years old, and who became our greatest colonial diarist. This was Samuel Sewall, who graduated from Harvard in 1671 and finally became chief justice of Massachusetts.

His ''Diary'' runs with some breaks from 1673 to 1729, the year before his death. Good diaries are scarce in any literature. Those who keep them seldom commit to writing many of the most interesting events and secrets of their lives. This failing makes the majority of diaries and memoirs very dry, but this fault cannot be found with Samuel Sewall. His ''Diary'' will
more and more prove a mine of wealth to the future writers of our literature, to our dramatists, novelists, poets, as well as to our historians. The early chronicles and stories on which Shakespeare founded many of his plays were no more serviceable to him than this ''Diary'' may prove to a coming American writer with a genius like Hawthorne's.

In Sewall's ''Diary'' we at once feel that we are close to life. The following entry brings us face to face with the children in a Puritan household:

  &quot;Nov. 6, 1692. Joseph threw a knop of brass and hit his sister Betty on
  the forehead so as to make it bleed and swell; upon which, and for his
  playing at Prayer-time, and eating when Return Thanks, I whipped him
  pretty smartly. When I first went in (called by his Grandmother) he
  sought to shadow and hide himself from me behind the head of the cradle:
  which gave me the sorrowful remembrance of Adam's carriage.&quot;

Sewall was one of the seven judges who sentenced nineteen persons to be put to death for witchcraft at Salem. After this terrible delusion had passed, he had the manliness to rise in church before all the members, and after acknowledging &quot;the blame and shame of his decision,&quot; call for &quot;prayers that God who has an unlimited authority would pardon that sin.&quot;

Sewall's ''Diary'' is best known for its faithful chronicle of his courtship of Mrs. Catharine Winthrop. Both had been married twice before, and both had grown children. He was sixty-nine and she fifty-six. No record of any other Puritan courtship so unique as this has been given to the world. He began his formal courtship of Mrs. Winthrop, October 1, 1720. His ''Diary''
contains records of each visit, of what they said to each other, of the Sermons, cake, and gingerbread that he gave her, of the healths that he drank to her, the lump of sugar that she gave him, of how they &quot;went into the best room, and clos'd the shutters.&quot;

  &quot;Nov. 2. Gave her about 1/2 pound of sugar almonds, cost 3 shillings per
  [pound]. Carried them on Monday. She seem'd pleas'd with them, ask'd what
  they cost. Spake of giving her a hundred pounds per annum if I died
  before her. Ask'd her what sum she would give me, if she should die
  first?&quot;

  &quot;Monday, Nov. 7. I went to Mad. Winthrop; found her rocking her little
  Katy in the cradle. I excused my coming so late (near eight). She set me
  an arm'd chair and cushion; and so the cradle was between her arm'd chair
  and mine. Gave her the remnant of my almonds. She did not eat of them as
  before.... The fire was come to one short brand besides the block, which
  brand was set up in end; at last it fell to pieces and no recruit was
  made.... Took leave of her.... Her dress was not so clean as sometime it
  had been. Jehovah jireh!&quot;

Acute men have written essays to account for the aristocratic Mrs. Winthrop's refusal of Chief-Justice Sewall. Some have said that it was due to his aversion to slavery and to his refusal to allow her to keep her slaves. This episode is only a small part of a rich storehouse. The greater part of the ''Diary'' contains only the raw materials of literature, yet some of it is real literature, and it ranks among the great diaries of the world.

==COTTON MATHER (1663-1728)==

LIFE AND PERSONALITY

Cotton Mather, grandson of the Reverend John Cotton (p. 14), and the most distinguished of the old type of Puritan clergymen, was born in Boston and died in his native city, without ever having traveled a hundred miles from it. He entered Harvard at the age of eleven, and took the bachelor's degree at fifteen. His life shows such an overemphasis of certain Puritan traits as almost to presage the coming decline of clerical influence. He says that at the age of only seven or eight he not only composed forms of prayer for his schoolmates, but also obliged them to pray, although some of them cuffed him for his pains. At fourteen he began a series of fasts to crucify the flesh, increase his holiness, and bring him nearer to God.

He endeavored never to waste a minute. In his study, where he often worked sixteen hours a day, he had in large letters the sign, &quot;BE SHORT,&quot; to greet the eyes of visitors. The amount of writing which he did almost baffles belief. His published works, numbering about four hundred, include sermons, essays, and books. During all of his adult life, he also preached in the
North Church of Boston.

He was a religious &quot;fantastic&quot;, that is, he made far-fetched applications of religious truth. A tall man suggested to him high attainments in Christianity; washing his hands, the desirability of a clean heart.

Although Cotton Mather became the most famous clergyman of colonial New England, he was disappointed in two of his life's ambitions. He failed to become president of Harvard and to bring New England back in religious matters to the first halcyon days of the colony. On the contrary, he lived to see Puritan theocracy suffer a great decline. His fantastic and strained
application of religious truth, his overemphasis of many things, and especially his conduct in zealously aiding and abetting the Salem witchcraft murders, were no mean factors in causing that decline.

His intentions were certainly good. He was an apostle of altruism, and he tried to improve each opportunity for doing good in everyday life. He trained his children to do acts of kindness for other children. His ''Essays to Do Good'' were a powerful influence on the life of Benjamin Franklin. Cotton Mather would not have lived in vain if he had done nothing else except to help mold Franklin for the service of his country; but this is only one of Mather's achievements. We must next pass to his great work in literature.

THE MAGNALIA

This &quot;prose epic of New England Puritanism,&quot; the most famous of Mather's many works, is a large folio volume entitled ''Magnalia Christi Americana: or the Ecclesiastical History of New England''. It was published in London in 1702, two years after Dryden's death.

The book is a remarkable compound of whatever seemed to the author most striking in early New England history. His point of view was of course religious. The work contains a rich store of biography of the early clergy, magistrates, and governors, of the lives of eleven of the clerical graduates of Harvard, of the faith, discipline, and government of the New England churches, of remarkable manifestations of the divine providence, and of the &quot;Way of the Lord&quot; among the churches and the Indians.

We may today turn to the ''Magnalia'' for vivid accounts of early New England life. Mather has a way of selecting and expressing facts in such a way as to cause them to lodge in the memory. These two facts about John Cotton give us a vivid impression of the influence of the early clergy:

  &quot;The keeper of the inn where he did use to lodge, when he came to Derby,
  would profanely say to his companions, that he wished Mr. Cotton were
  gone out of his house, for he was not able to swear while that man was
  under his roof....

  &quot;The Sabbath he began the evening before, for which keeping of the
  Sabbath from evening to evening he wrote arguments before his coming to
  New England; and I suppose 'twas from his reason and practice that the
  Christians of New England have generally done so too.&quot;

We read that the daily vocation of Thomas Shepard, the first pastor at Cambridge, Massachusetts, was, to quote Mather's noble phrase, &quot;A Trembling Walk with God&quot;. He speaks of the choleric disposition of Thomas Hooker, the great Hartford clergyman, and says it was &quot;useful unto him,&quot; because &quot;he had ordinarily as much government of his choler as a man has of a mastiff dog in a chain; he 'could let out his dog, and pull in his dog, as he pleased.'&quot; Some of Mather's prose causes modern readers to wonder if he was not a humorist. He says that a fire in the college buildings in some mysterious way influenced the President of Harvard to shorten one of his long prayers, and gravely adds, &quot;that if the devotions had held three minutes longer, the Colledge had been irrecoverably laid in ashes.&quot; One does not feel sure that Mather saw the humor in this demonstration of
practical religion. It is also doubtful whether he is intentionally humorous in his most fantastic prose, such, for instance, as his likening the Reverend Mr. Partridge to the bird of that name, who, because he &quot;had no defence neither of beak nor claw,&quot; took &quot;a flight over the ocean&quot; to escape his ecclesiastical hunters, and finally &quot;took wing to become a bird of paradise, along with the winged seraphim of heaven.&quot;

Such fantastic conceits, which for a period blighted the literature of the leading European nations, had their last great exponent in Cotton Mather. Minor writers still indulge in these conceits, and find willing readers among the uneducated, the tired, and those who are bored when they are required to do more than skim the surface of things. John Seccomb, a Harvard graduate of 1728, the year in which Mather died, then gained fame from such lines as:

  &quot;A furrowed brow,
   Where corn might grow,&quot;

but the best prose and poetry have for a long time won their readers for other qualities. Even the taste of the next generation showed a change, for Cotton Mather's son, Samuel, noted as a blemish his father's &quot;straining for far-fetched and dear-bought hints.&quot; Cotton Mather's most repellent habit to modern readers is his overloading his pages with quotations in foreign languages, especially in Latin. He thus makes a pedantic display of his wide reading.

He is not always accurate in his presentation of historical or biographical matter, but in spite of all that can be said against the ''Magnalia'', it is a vigorous presentation of much that we should not willingly let die. In fact, when we read the early history of New England, we are frequently getting from the ''Magnalia'' many things in changed form without ever
suspecting the source.

==JONATHAN EDWARDS (1703-1758)==

LIFE AND WRITINGS

Jonathan Edwards, who ranks among the world's greatest theologians and metaphysicians, was born in 1703 in East Windsor,
Connecticut. Like Cotton Mather, Edwards was precocious, entering Yale before he was thirteen. The year previous to his going to college, he wrote a paper on spiders, showing careful scientific observation and argument. This paper has been called &quot;one of the rarest specimens of precocious scientific genius on record.&quot; At fourteen, he read Locke's ''Essay on the Human Understanding'', receiving from it, he says, higher pleasure &quot;than the most greedy miser finds when gathering up handfuls of silver and gold from some newly discovered treasure.&quot; Before he was seventeen, he had graduated from Yale, and he had become a tutor there before he was twenty-one.

Like Dante, he had a Beatrice. Thinking of her, he wrote this prose hymn of a maiden's love for the Divine Power:

  &quot;They say there is a young lady in New Haven who is beloved of that great
  Being who made and rules the world, and there are certain seasons in
  which this great Being, in some way or other invisible, comes to her and
  fills her mind with exceeding sweet delight, and that she hardly cares
  for anything except to meditate on Him, that she expects after a while to
  be received up where He is, to be raised up out of the world and caught
  up into heaven, being assured that He loves her too well to let her
  remain at a distance from Him always. She will sometimes go about from
  place to place singing sweetly, and seems to be always full of joy and
  pleasure, and no one knows for what. She loves to be alone, walking in
  the fields and groves, and seems to have some one invisible always
  conversing with her&quot;

Jonathan Edwards thus places before us Sarah Pierrepont, a New England Puritan maiden. To note the similarity of thought between the Old Puritan England and the New, let us turn to the maiden in Milton's Comus:

  &quot;A thousand liveried angels lackey her,
   Driving far off each thing of sin and guilt,
   And in clear dream and solemn vision,
   Tell her of things that no gross ear can hear,
   Till oft converse with heav'nly habitants
   Begin to cast a beam on th'outward shape,
   The unpolluted temple of the mind,
   And turns it by degrees to the soul's essence,
   Till all be made immortal.&quot;

Unlike Dante, Edwards married his Beatrice at the age of seventeen. In 1727, the year of his marriage, he became pastor of the church in Northampton, Massachusetts. With the aid of his wife, he inaugurated the greatest religious revival of the century, known as the &quot;Great Awakening,&quot; which spread to other colonial churches, crossed the ocean, and stimulated Wesley to call sinners to repentance.

Early in life, Edwards formed a series of resolutions, three of which are:

&quot;To live with all my might, while I do live.&quot;

&quot;Never to do anything, which, if I should see in another, I should count a just occasion to despise him for, or to think any way the more meanly of him.&quot;

&quot;Never, henceforward, till I die, to act as if I were any way my own, but entirely and altogether God's.&quot;

He earnestly tried to keep these resolutions until the end. After a successful pastorate of twenty-three years at Northampton, the church dismissed him for no fault of his own.

Like Dante, he was driven into exile, and he went from Northampton to the frontier town of Stockbridge, where he remained for seven years as a missionary to the Indians. His wife and daughters did their utmost to add to the family income, and some contributions were sent him from Scotland, but he was so poor that he wrote his books on the backs of letters and on the blank margins cut from newspapers. His fame was not swallowed up in the wilderness. Princeton College called him to its presidency in 1757. He died in that office in 1758, after less than three months' service in his new position. His wife was still in Stockbridge when he passed away. &quot;Tell her,&quot; he said to his daughter, &quot;that the uncommon union which has so long subsisted between us has been of such a nature as I trust is spiritual, and therefore will continue forever.&quot; In September of the same year she came to lie beside him in the graveyard at Princeton.

In 1900, the church that had dismissed him one hundred and fifty years before placed on its walls a bronze tablet in his memory, with the noble inscription from ''Malachi'' ii, 6.

As a writer, Jonathan Edwards won fame in three fields. He is (1) America's greatest metaphysician, (2) her greatest theologian, and (3) a unique poetic interpreter of the universe as a manifestation of the divine love.

His best known metaphysical work is ''The Freedom of the Will'' (1754). The central point of this work is that the will is determined by the strongest motive, that it is &quot;repugnant to reason that one act of the will should come into existence without a cause.&quot; He boldly says that God is free to do only what is right. Edwards emphasizes the higher freedom, gained through repeated acts of the right kind, until both the inclination and the power to do wrong disappear.

As a theologian, America has not yet produced his superior. His ''Treatise concerning the Religious Affections'', his account of the Great Awakening, called ''Faithful Narrative of the Surprising Work of God'', and ''Thoughts on the Revival'', as well as his more distinctly technical theological works, show his ability in this field. Unfortunately, he did not rise superior to
the Puritan custom of preaching about hellfire. He delivered on that subject a sermon which causes modern readers to shudder; but this, although the most often quoted, is the least typical of the man and his writings. Those in search of really typical statements of his theology will find them in such specimens as, &quot;God and real existence is the same. God is and there is nothing else.&quot; He was a theological idealist, believing that all the varied phenomena of the universe are &quot;constantly proceeding from God, as light from the sun.&quot; Such statements suggest Shelley's lines, which tell how

  &quot;... the one Spirit's plastic stress
   Sweeps through the dull dense world compelling there
   All new successions to the forms they wear.&quot;

Dr. Allen, Edwards's biographer and critic, and a careful student of his unpublished, as well as of his published, writings, says, &quot;He was at his best and greatest, most original and creative, when he described the divine love.&quot; Such passages as the following show this quality:

  &quot;When we behold the fragrant rose and lily, we see His love and purity.
  So the green trees and fields and singing of birds are the emanations of
  His infinite joy and benignity. The easiness and naturalness of trees and
  vines are shadows of His beauty and loveliness.&quot;

His favorite text was, &quot;I am the Rose of Sharon and the Lily of the valleys,&quot; and his favorite words were &quot;sweet and bright.&quot;

==ENGLISH LITERATURE OF THE PERIOD==

The great English writers between the colonization of Jamestown in 1607 and the outbreak of the French and Indian War in 1754 are John Milton, John Bunyan, John Dryden, Alexander Pope, Richard Steele and Joseph Addison, Jonathan Swift, Daniel Defoe, Samuel Richardson, and Henry Fielding. The colonial literature of this period was influenced only in a very minor degree by the work of these men, for a generation usually passed before the influence of contemporary English authors appeared in American literature. In the next section, we shall see evidences of the influence of Pope. Benjamin Franklin will tell us how Bunyan and Addison were his teachers, and the early fiction will show its indebtedness to the work of Samuel Richardson.

==LEADING HISTORICAL FACTS==

Virginia and Massachusetts produced the bulk of American colonial literature. There were, however, thirteen colonies stretched along the seaboard from Georgia (1733), the last to be founded, to Canada. Although these colonies were established under different grants or charters, and although some had more liberty and suffered less from the interference of England than
others, it is nevertheless true that every colony was a school for a self-governing democracy. No colonies elsewhere in the world had the same amount of liberty. 

We must not suppose that there was complete liberty in those days. The early government of Virginia was largely aristocratic; that of Massachusetts, theocratic. Virginia persecuted the Puritans. The early settlers of Massachusetts drove out Roger Williams and hanged Quakers. New York persecuted those who did not join the Church of England. However, it is still nevertheless true that these thirteen colonies were making the greatest of all world experiments in democracy and liberty.

The important colony of New Netherland (New York) was settled by the Dutch early in the seventeenth century. They established an aristocracy with great landed estates along the Hudson. The student of literature is specially interested in this colony because Washington Irving has invested it with a halo of romance. He shows us the sturdy Knickerbockers, the Van Cortlands, the Van Dycks, the Van Wycks, and other chivalrous Dutch burghers, sitting in perfect silence, puffing their pipes, and thinking of nothing for hours together in those &quot;days of simplicity and sunshine.&quot; For literary reasons it is well that this was not made an English colony until the Duke of York took possession of it in 1664.

At the beginning of the eighteenth century, the colonists in the middle and northern part of the country divided their energies almost equally between trade and agriculture. At the South, agriculture was the chief occupation and tobacco and rice were the two leading staples. These were produced principally by the labor of negro slaves. There were also many indentured
servants at the South, where the dividing lines between the different classes were most strongly marked.

Up to 1700 the history of each colony is practically that of a separate unit. Almost all the colonies had trouble with Indians and royal governors. Pirates, rapacious politicians, religious matters, or witchcraft were sometimes sources of disturbance. All knew the hard labor and the privations involved in subduing the wilderness and making permanent settlements in a new land. History tells of the abandonment of many other colonies and of the subjugation of many other races, but no difficulty and
no foe daunted this Anglo-Saxon stock.

In 1700 the population of New England was estimated at about one hundred and ten thousand. In 1754, the beginning of the French and Indian War, Connecticut alone had that number, while all New England probably had at this time nearly four hundred thousand. The middle colonies began the eighteenth century with about fifty-nine thousand and grew by the middle of
the century to about three hundred and fifty-five thousand. During the same period, the southern group increased from about ninety thousand to six hundred thousand. By 1750 the thirteen colonies probably had a total population of nearly fourteen hundred thousand. Since no census was taken until 1790, these figures are only approximately correct.

Such development serves to show the trend of coming events. This remarkable increase in population soon caused numbers to go farther west. This movement resulted in collision with the French, who were at this time holding the central part of the country, from the Gulf into Canada. One other result followed. The colonies began to seem valuable to England because they furnished a market for English manufactures and a carrying trade for English ships. The previous comparative insignificance of the colonies and the trouble in England had served to protect them, but their trade had now assumed a proportion that made the mother country realize what a valuable commercial asset she would have if she regulated the colonies in her own interest.

==SUMMARY==

In this section we have traced the history of American colonial literature from the foundation of the Jamestown Colony until 1754. Before 1607 Chaucer, Spenser, and Shakespeare had written, and before 1620 the King James version of the ''Bible'' had been produced. England had, therefore, a wonderful literature before her colonies came to America. They were the heirs of all that the English race had previously accomplished; and they brought to these shores an Elizabethan initiative, ingenuity, and
democratic spirit.

The Virginia colony was founded, as colonies usually are, for a commercial reason. The Virginians and the other southern colonists lived more by agriculture, were more widely scattered, had fewer schools, more slaves, and less town life than the New Englanders. Under the influence of a commanding clergy, common schools, and the stimulus of town life, the New
England colony produced more literature.

The chief early writers of Virginia are: 
(1) Captain John Smith, who described the country and the Indians, and gave to literature the story of Pocahontas, thereby disclosing a new world to the imagination of writers; 
(2) William Strachey, who outranks contemporary colonial writers in describing the wrath of the sea, and who may even have furnished a suggestion to Shakespeare for ''The Tempest''; 
(3) two poets, (a) George Sandys, who translated part of Ovid, and (b) the unknown author of the elegy on Nathaniel Bacon; and (4) Robert Beverly and William Byrd, who gave interesting descriptions of early Virginia.

The chief colonial writers of New England are: 
(1) William Bradford, whose ''History of Plymouth Plantation'' tells the story of the first Pilgrim colony; 
(2) John Winthrop, who wrote in his ''Journal'' the early history of the Massachusetts Bay Colony; 
(3) the poets, including (a) the translators of the ''Bay Psalm Book'', the first volume of so-called verse printed in the British American colonies, (b) Wigglesworth, whose ''Day of Doom'', was a poetic exposition of Calvinistic theology, (c) Anne Bradstreet, who wrote a small amount of genuine poetry, after she had passed from the influence of the &quot;fantastic&quot; school of poets; 
(4) Nathaniel Ward, the author of ''The Simple Cobbler of Agawam'', an attempt to mend human ways; 
(5) Samuel Sewall, New England's greatest colonial diarist; 
(6) Cotton Mather, the most famous clerical writer, whose ''Magnalia'' is a compound of early colonial history and biography, sometimes written in a &quot;fantastic&quot; style; 
(7) Jonathan Edwards, America's greatest metaphysician and theologian, who maintained that the action of the human will is determined by the strongest motive, that the substance of this universe is nothing but &quot;the divine Idea,&quot; communicated to human consciousness, and who could invest spiritual truth with the beauty of the Rose of Sharon and the Lily of the valleys.

The New England colonist came to America because of religious feeling. His religion was to him a matter of eternal life or eternal death. From the modern point of view, this religion may seem too inflexibly stern, too little illumined by the spirit of love, too much darkened by the shadow of eternal punishment, but unless that religion had communicated something of
its own dominating inflexibility to the colonist, he would never have braved the ocean, the wilderness, the Indians; he would never have flung the gauntlet down to tyranny at Lexington and Concord.

The greatest lesson taught by colonial literature, by men like Bradford, Winthrop, Edwards, and the New England clergy in general, is moral heroism, the determination to follow the shining path of the Eternal over the wave and through the forest to a new temple of human liberty. Their aspiration, endeavor, suffering, accomplishment, should strengthen our faith in the
worth of those spiritual realities which are not quoted in the markets of the world, but which alone possess imperishable value.

==QUESTIONS AND SUGGESTIONS==

1. Is Captain John Smith more remarkable for chronicling what passed before his senses or for explaining what he saw? How does his account of the Indians compare with modern understanding? Is Smith apparently a novice, or somewhat skilled in writing prose? Does he seem to you to be a romancer or a narrator of a plain unvarnished tale?

2. Compare Strachey's storm at sea with Act I of Shakespeare's ''Tempest''. In what part of this Act and under what circumstances does he mention &quot;the still-vex'd Bermoothes&quot;?

3. Compare the ability of the three great early colonizers, Smith, Bradford, and Winthrop, in writing narrative prose. Smith's story of Pocahontas is easily accessible. Those who can find the complete works of Bradford and Winthrop may select from Bradford for comparison his story of Squanto, the Pilgrims' tame Indian. Winthrop's ''Journal'' contains many specimens of
brief narrative, such as the story of the voyage across the Atlantic from March 29 to June 14, 1630; of Winthrop's losing himself in the wood, October 11, 1631; of shipwreck on the Isle of Shoals, August 16, 1635; of an indentured servant, March 8, 1636; of an adventure with Indians, July 20-30, August 24, and October 8, 1636. Those without opportunity to consult the works of Bradford and Winthrop will find in the books of selections sufficient material for comparison.

4. Is brevity or prolixity a quality of these early narrators? Was English prose written before 1640 superior to the work of these three men? What advance in prose narrative do you find in Beverly and Byrd? 

5. What characteristic of a famous English prose writer of the nineteenth century is noticeable in Ward's essay on fashions?

6. Why could fine poetry not be reasonably expected in early Virginia and New England? What are some of the Calvinistic tenets expounded in Wigglesworth's ''Day of Doom''? Choose the best two short selections of colonial poetry.

7. What are some of the qualifications of a good diarist? Which of these do you find in the ''Diary'' of Samuel Sewall?

8. Point out some of the fantastic prose expressions of Cotton Mather. Compare his narrative of Captain Phips with the work of Smith, Bradford, and Winthrop, on the one hand, and of Beverly and Byrd, on the other.

9. Compare the theology in Edwards's &quot;Rose of Sharon&quot; selection with that in Wigglesworth's ''Day of Doom''. Why may this selection from Edwards be called a &quot;poetic exposition of the divine love&quot;? What is his view of the freedom of the will?

Rather than write this page from scratch, I took a work already written and safely out of copyright (History of American Literature, by Reuben Post Halleck) in order to update and transform it over time into a good textbook for us. I have gone ahead and placed the section here with very few changes, but in the coming days plan to alter formatting, information, and to supplement it with hyperlinks to the texts referred to in the text. Feel free to beat me to the punch. There is much I do not know about Wiki-text, so I hope this will become a collaboration.[[User:DanQuigley|DanQuigley]] ([[User talk:DanQuigley|talk]]) 06:23, 14 November 2008 (UTC)

== First Draft Done ==

Okay, I have cleaned up much of the borrowed text, deleted or corrected items I knew to be wrong, or that would have particularly grated on a modern ear. I think this is a good base on Colonial literature upon which a more modern text can eventually be constructed. I hope others find it as enjoyable and useful a read as I have.

The next tasks:
1) Update the sections with better, more modern information. Continue to revise the text for smoother flow.
2) Begin to put in links to Wikipedia and works that are discussed in the text and available online.[[User:DanQuigley|DanQuigley]] ([[User talk:DanQuigley|talk]]) 04:23, 15 November 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Bad science... the placebo effect!==

Do you believe your teacher?

From healing to sugar-coated capsules with no &quot;active&quot; ingredients, and from health food stores supplying various ointments and potions to maintain &quot;well being&quot; to a plethora of crushed up grasses and vines that really do make you feel on top of the world!

Perhaps this is a real scientific breakthrough, no more need for the pharmaceutical industry, but perhaps some of these claims are just a matter of what’s in our minds….

What the students had to say about this activity:

* &quot;I found it interesting how your mind can trick you!&quot;
* &quot;I could tell it was decaffeinated coke by the taste!&quot; (From a pupil in the caffeinated cola group!)
* &quot;The reaction time tests were good fun&quot;
* &quot;It was funny that I speeded up just because I thought I had to&quot;

The following are a selection of PDF documents for teachers and students.

*[[/Article|Ben's Article: What's Wrong With The Placebo Effect?]]
*[[Bad_Science/Detox/Public|Aqua Detox Meets The Public]]

===Further links===

* Real research on the placebo effect by Professor Irving Kirsch (now at the University of Plymouth) can be seen in one of his scientific papers [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve%26db=pubmed%26dopt=Abstract%26list_uids=3365327%26query_hl=3%26itool=pubmed_docsum here].
* Another point for discussion is the [[w:Nocebo effect|Nocebo effect]]. Nocebo is Latin for &quot;I will harm&quot;, and is an ill effect caused by the belief that something is harmful.
* For example, &quot;…more than two-thirds of 34 college students developed headaches when told that a non-existent electrical current passing through their heads could produce a headache.&quot; See: [http://skepdic.com/nocebo.html The Skeptics Dictionary].

In one episode of the popular U.S. hospital drama, ER, the drug &quot;Obecalp&quot; was prescribed. This was none other than &quot;placebo&quot; spelt backwards… obviously the patient didn’t have a clue!

Come introduce yourself at the [[WB:SLN|new users]] page.  If you have any questions, you can ask there or contact me personally.

Thank you for starting the [[ANTFARM]] wikibook. I'm starting to think that all good software should have documentation posted on a wiki somewhere.

Is ANTFARM the kind of complex piece of software that requires an entire book to explain (like, say, Emacs)? Then a Wikibook of its own makes a lot of sense.

Or is ANTFARM the simpler, &quot;do one thing really well&quot; tool that I prefer?
One that could be covered in a few pages?
If so, would you mind if I moved those few pages into a section of the [[Computer Networks]] Wikibook?

Tests To Do!

===Testing Your Reaction Times===

How fast do your nerves send and receive messages? Involuntary
reflexes are very fast, travelling in milliseconds. The nerve impulses in
the neurons that control these reflexes act without even bothering to
be processed by the brain! In fact, the fastest impulses reach 520
kilometres (320 miles) per hour! Our conscious muscular response to a
stimulus takes a much longer route. See just how fast your brain and
nerves respond to stimuli in this experiment.

====Method====

This activity is designed to measure your reaction time in catching a dropped metre ruler.

1. Sit with your forearm on a table surface so the hand extends over the edge.

2. Have your partner hold the metre stick with the zero end just above, but not touching,
your thumb and fingers.

3. Ask your partner to release the metre stick without warning.

4. Catch the stick as quickly as you can between your thumb and fingers.

5. Record the centimetre mark where you caught the stick.

6. Repeat steps 3, 4 and 5 ten times. Have your partner vary the waiting time before each
drop. Record the results on a chart.

7. Cross out the highest and lowest numbers on your chart, so only eight numbers are left.
Find the mean (average) of these numbers and record it.

8. Repeat this experiment with your partner catching the stick. Record the results.

9. Convert the distance into your reaction time with the chart below.

Here is a table to convert the distance on the ruler to the reaction time. For example, if you
caught the ruler at the 20 cm mark, then your reaction time is equal to 0.20 seconds (200
ms). Remember that there are 1,000 milliseconds (ms) in 1 second.
{|
!Distance on ruler!!Time
|-
|5 cm ||0.10 s (100 ms)
|-
|10 cm ||0.14 s (140 ms)
|-
|15 cm ||0.17 s (170 ms)
|-
|20 cm ||0.20 s (200 ms)
|-
|25.5 cm ||0.23 s (230 ms)
|-
|30.5 cm ||0.25 sc (250 ms)
|-

|61 cm ||0.35 s (350 ms)
|-
|79 cm ||0.40 s (400 ms)
|-
|99 cm ||0.45 s (450 ms)
|}

Testing Your Memory

See if you can remember all the objects after memorising the objects for one minute.

Remember, no peeking!

'''Data Sheet'''

70 patients took part in this study. Half of them had a snack of bread and jam, and the others a high glucose drink.	
	
Their blood samples were taken at various intervals after their	snack or drink (0, 30, 60 and 90 minutes). 	

Results for blood glucose levels are given in the tables shown here.	
	
Blood glucose levels are expressed in millimoles per litre (mmol/l).	
	
How can you analyse these results?	
	
What would you expect the results to show?	
	
How could these results be manipulated to give a different conclusion?

If you want, each table can be copied and pasted into a spreadsheet (such as Microsoft Excel).

===share your own discoveries===

Ever wondered &quot;where’s the science in that?&quot; when you’ve been reading a magazine article, or advert, and you’ve wanted to share this with your students?

How about designing an activity like the ones you’ve seen on this website? Feel free to send comments on the activities you’ve already seen on this site (or even tried out with your class!)

Feedback: Each page has a 'discussion' section where you can add comments. Adding &lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt; to your comment will record your username and the date and time.

New activities: To create a new page you can add a link to any existing page. Edit the existing page, add text like this: &lt;nowiki&gt;[[/New Activity]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, and save your changes. Now the page has a link to your New Activity. At first it will be a 'red link' which means that the link is to a non-existent page. Click on the red link and get writing! 

===what’s your favourite piece of pseudoscience?===

Those fans of the Planet Science weekly newsletter will know Ian Francis has asked many lovely science people what their favourite piece of pseudoscience is. We’ve even asked for a few detailed responses:

''&quot;Non-scientific thinking is normal thinking. Scientific thinking is an abnormal way of thinking and quite difficult to learn. All it really means is a group of methods for distinguishing belief from evidence-based fact. What irritates me about pseudoscience is that this is non-scientific thinking which is pretending to be scientific - in effect trying to borrow scientific credibility to dress up whatever the subject is, often for dubious purposes. What worries me is that so many people will buy the result, which is often fairly transparent nonsense. What this demonstrates is widespread lack of understanding of the difference between science and non-science. Both are fine, but it's important that people know which is which, even if they're not so good at scientific thinking themselves. This should be a key area for public education programmes on science.”''

Professor John A Lee
Consultant Pathologist, Rotherham General Hospital 

Best known as: the pathologist on Gunther von Hagens’ recent Autopsy shows on Channel 4


''“As for pseudoscience, at one level it makes me laugh, but at another, it is profoundly depressing and sometimes downright dangerous.  It also has an extraordinary grip on people.  For instance, take the idea that you can overload your immune system.  Two minutes thought should tell people that it can’t be true.  After all, walk down Oxford Street or travel hugger mugger with the world on the Piccadilly line and you are exposed to more microbes than you could shake a stick at, yet we remain largely healthy despite this constant assault.  Our bodies aren’t handing out numbered tickets insisting on one germ at a time – they just have to deal with whatever we’re exposed to - all at once and this has always been the case.  But pseudoscience has caused and resulted in such persistent belief that parents have taken flight from the perceived ‘dangers’ of multiple vaccinations such as MMR, and in doing so have exposed their children and those of other people to a very real danger.  It’s really alarming.”''

Vivienne Parry
Freelance writer and broadcaster

Best known as: presenter on Tomorrow’s World


''“I don’t have a favourite piece of pseudo science because that would imply I liked pseudoscience. I hate it all with a vengeance.”''

Alom Shaha
NESTA awardee and science filmmaker extraordinaire


''“Products which I hate: anything which is contrary to the 1st or 2nd Law of Thermodynamics as applied to people i.e. drinks supplements etc. which their proponents say will make you faster, stronger, slimmer or more muscle-y in a few weeks. And Jane Clark who says &quot;Pomegranate juice could prevent a heart attack - FACT&quot; and &quot;Beetroot can pep up your sex life - FACT&quot;. No human trials, it’s all been done in vitro!”''

Professor Michael J Rennie
Professor of Clinical Physiology, University of Nottingham


''“Funnily enough, I don't hate it because it's not science - there are many 'not science' things that rather please me. No, I'm frustrated by pseudoscience because it's fundamentally irrational to believe in it. Other fields of endeavour appeal to the emotions, or a sense of aesthetics - but pseudoscience strikes me as fundamentally value- free. I find it baffling and even dangerous that so many people believe in it, and attempt to justify it. That said, I did used to wear a copper bracelet, and thought at the time that it did some good. However, that's a demonstration either of the placebo effect, or that anecdotal evidence is unscientific in its own right.”''

Jonathan Sanderson
Science TV Producer


''&quot;Pseudoscience like homeopathy and intelligent design would be laughable if it was kept out of schools and hospitals. But the existence of homeopathic hospitals and city academies teaching creationism suggests that some politicians (and members of the royal family) could do with retaking their chemistry and biology O-levels.&quot;''
Dr Ian Brown
Department of Computer Science, University College London

Best known as: not the lead singer of the Stone Roses

=Downloading from 3rd party Trainz fansites=
&lt;/noinclude&gt;&lt;!-- the body of this page is included in an in-line tutorial page, so don't mess up the nesting of &lt;noinclude&gt;...&lt;/noinclude&gt; pairings.
---&gt;
'''Downloading 3rd party content''' from strange websites has it's risks, but the tight knit Trainz community provides a measure of protection for if {{wp|mal-ware}} or {{wp|spy-ware}} resides in any of these links, the community would be messaging about it on the forum as soon as suspicions arose and warning others of the possibility. Consequently, even hackers find hijacking a Trainz based site difficult as they get a fair amount of traffic from older experienced computer savvy Trainzers who sniff out such hacks.
 
Some of these sites are funded by the new download 'utilities' looking to have you also install 5-6 other items, so verify the url of the link and the meaning of each stage of installing--the Decline Offer button tends to be a minimal hyper link well off the main sight-line.

This list is not comprehensive and it is recommended to all that when browsing unknown sites to keep your machine free from possible malware ''you should only access them from a Windows user account '''which is not''' a Window administrator account'' on a machine that has automatic windows update enabled. This is the opposite setup of how you want to Run Trainz, so plan your browsing accordingly.
 
Google Chrome or the latest Firefox with the'' 'noscript addon' and 'add block' ''offer better protection than IE. 

{{Text-box|'''''See also: [[Trainz/External Links]]''', which contains some other links to 3rd party sites.''}}
==Process ==
# Find something you want browsing non-Auran websites. 
## Some sites will require a login and validation cycle like TPR and Jointed-Rail.
## Do their sign-up dance two step and where necessary use a shopping cart if necessary. (These are security measures, so be glad!)
# 3rd Party sites will bundle offerings by zip, RAR, and cdp files as a rule. Some will offer a FTP download managed link. 
# If the site is payware, we're sure you'll figure it out. If freeware, some will nonetheless suggest a donation. 
## Given that a simple house asset likely represents 2-3 hours work to develop, a speedtree model upwards of a couple days as have many assets and a well modeled locomotive or passenger car with animated actions and interiors likely over six months, a modest donation is a reasonable request. 
## The above times are one reason to not be upset when an asset shows up with errors in a newly changed data model. Upgrading hundreds of assets when N3V does a poor job of conveying what has changed so a CC can plan updates ahead of a sudden flurry of inquiries and complaints is a daunting task, and only rarely a possible one.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Just when you thought you were beginning to understand IP networking the rules get changed! IPv6 is the shorthand notation for version 6 of the Internet Protocol. The main driver of the design of [[w:IPv6|IPv6]], was the [[w:Ipv4_address_exhaustion|IPv4 address exhaustion]]. Also the number of devices that require IP addressing has grown, especially [[w:Mobile_devices|mobile devices]] with the explosion of the &quot;mobile Internet&quot;. It is expected that in future there will be much more connected devices (with new trends in [[w:Home_automation|home automation]] and connectivity in cars). IPv6 addresses are 16 bytes long (128 bits). IPv6 incorporates a number of other changes, mostly simplifications, that will make IPv6 networks more manageable than IPv4 networks.

Linux already has a working, but not complete, IPv6 implementation in the 2.2.* series kernels.

The [[w:IPv6|IPv6]] addresses are normally written as eight groups of four hexadecimal digits, where each group is separated by a semi colon (:). 

Syntax: XXXX: XXXX: XXXX: XXXX: XXXX: XXXX: XXXX: XXXX

For example: 2001:0 DB8: 85A3: 08D3: 1319:8 A2E: 0370:7334

==Main Features==
*Larger address space
*Address scopes
*Stateless address configuration
*Multicast
*Mandatory network layer security
*Simplified processing by routers

==DHCPv6==
[[w:DHCPv6|DHCPv6]] is a protocol for dynamic host configuration for [[w:IPv6|IPv6]]. The server is responsible for assigning IP addresses and maintaining the states of the client nodes. 
It maintains a database of the addresses that were assigned to the hosts, thus the name &quot;statefull,&quot; as it maintains the status of allocations. 

===Operation=== 
The client host sends a request to the [[w:IPv6|IPv6]] network, all servers that are connected to the network, receives the request. But only the server assigns an IP to the client host. 

==Implementations of IPv6 in XO==
Three of the main possible implementations of [[w:IPv6|IPv6]] in the XO are described below:

===Manual Allocation===
All the hosts should be awarded an IP within the same network. To do this, the command is:

&lt;pre&gt;ip -6 addr add &lt;IP Global&gt;/&lt;prefix&gt; dev &lt;interface&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

To run this command on the XO, the user must have root permissions.

===Automatic Allocation===
To achieve this, a [[w:DHCPv6|DHCPv6]] server must be configured (in any host) and each node of the network must be configured for the [[w:DHCPv6|DHCPv6]] client.

The [[w:DHCPv6|DHCPv6]] server must be configured with the range of IPs that will be available in the pool of address and prefix of the network.
On the client, the server that it will “listen” must be configured as well as the network interface that it will use to connect to the [[w:DHCPv6|DHCPv6]] server.

To perform this configuration, both the client and the server, the user must have root permissions.

===Local IP Allocation===
Two or more XO connected together, set up an ad-hoc network, which is automatically configured. The IP that is assigned in each node is known as: local link. 

==Validation==
To validate these implementations, this command must be executed:

&lt;pre&gt;ping6 –I &lt;interface&gt; &lt;ipDestiny&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

A broadcast ping can be done to test the network:
&lt;pre&gt;ping6 –I &lt;interface&gt;  ff02::1&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''&lt;big&gt;'''What is driving Mobile Society''&lt;/big&gt;''''                                                 By: Cynthia Sibanda 

Mobile Society is the wireless communication technology era which has been growing at an amazingly rapid rate over the past few years especially since the introduction of the internet.

The mobile society is being driven by the increased mobility by organizations and individuals as a result of the search for the best value added activities or processes at minimal cost, maximum speed and at the best quality  as evidenced by the rise in the following :

'''&lt;u&gt;Globalization&lt;/u&gt;'''
Doing Business in multiple countries has meant  a lot of travel for some people as well as an increased need for quick, efficient and cost effective communication tools. The different organization branches need to communicate and send information securely from branch to branch and staff members traveling need to be in contact with the home branch and the branch they are visiting as well as with their families. With all traveling, people want to work, communicate and access resources as they travel and this has encouraged more and more innovation in wireless technology.

'''&lt;u&gt;Outsourcing&lt;/u&gt;'''
A lot of business processes are now being broken up into many pieces, where different processes or departments are transferred to external providers to be coordinated and managed externally and some of these external providers are in a different country or city and businesses need to keep in constant touch with these external processes to maintain the organization operating efficiently 

'''&lt;u&gt;Changes in Workforce&lt;/u&gt;'''
In the competitive workforce market that exists now, businesses have to be innovative in benefits that they offer their employees in an effort to retain workers one of the ways they have done that is with a work life and family life balance with the introduction of Telecommuting.-allowing employees to work from home.For this to be effective, the organization needs to have an efficient and secure network from which the staff members to work from and a lot of organizations e.g IBM are equipping employees with Laptops instead of desktop computers to enable them to work from almost anywhere

&lt;u&gt;'''Innovation'''&lt;/u&gt;
There are more resources available for wireless technology research and more and more people are graduating in the field, increasing the available researchers and as a result there are more people coming up with new software, hardware, engineering etc.… and hence the competition is increasing and driving the direction of society.With innovation over the years,the once heavy,bulky and expensive cellphones and laptops are now extremely light, more portable and affordable and thus more convenient and accessible to more people and thus encouraging the production of wireless devices .

Businesses have also come up with mobile ways of doing business in the form of self serve services, such as online banking. Services like these, which allow consumers to carry out transactions without going to the business establishment increase mobility in that, it increases the need and use of devices that enable one to access anything, anytime, anywhere.

==Organizational Patterns==
There are seven different patterns that are commonly used to organize documents: Formal classification, informal classification, comparison, partitioning, segmenting, cause/effect, and problem/solution. Which organizational pattern is used will depend on the type of document that is being composed; however, the goal of effective organizing is to make the document easier to use, and several organizational patterns are often used in a single document.

===Formal Classification===
Formal classification is simply grouping facts together based on their common attributes. Each group is often divided into subgroups enabling the facts to be precisely classified. Formal classification requires that each fact can only be present in one grouping, and each grouping must follow the same principle. For example, to classify three animals, each animal should only fit into one group. A tiger, wolf, and zebra could be grouped into categories such as feline, canine, and equine. Each grouping follows the same principle of grouping the animals according to their biological family. A faulty classification would be feline, canine, and mammal because feline and canine are biological families and mammal refers to a biological class. Still further, each species can be broken up into subgroups and divisions like in cattle, Herefords and Jerseys are both cattle, but one is a beef animal and the other is a dairy animal. 
===Informal Classification===

Informal classification can help you create a reader-centered communication when you need to organize  information about a large number of items but find it impossible or undesirable to classify them according to the kind of objective characteristic that is necessary for formal classification.

Informal classification differs from formal classification because the groupings need not follow a consistent principle of classification; however, like formal classification, each fact should still only fit into one grouping. For example, a tiger, wolf, and zebra could be classified into canines and African mammals. The groupings do not follow a consistent principle, but each animal can only be grouped into one category. Informal classification is a valid organizational pattern and can be very useful to readers when properly used.

===Comparison===
Comparisons are used in business documents to help readers make a decision and to help readers understand research findings. Two alternatives are compared to each other based on the same criteria. For example, two building sites may be compared to decide which site to build a warehouse. Site A and Site B could both be compared based on development cost, road access, property taxes, distance to customers, and so on. Comparisons are useful when readers must evaluate several options.

In some ways, comparison is like classification. You begin with a large set of facts about the things you are comparing, and you group the facts around points of comparison that enable your readers to see how the things are like and unlike one another. In comparisons written to support decision-making, points of comparison are called criteria. When writing a comparison, you can choose either of two organizational patterns. Both include the same contents but arrange the contents differently.

Consider, for example, Tiffany's situation. Tiffany's employer has decided to replace the aging machines it uses to stamp out metal parts for the bodies of large trucks. Tiffany has been assigned to investigate the two machines the company is considering. Having amassed hundreds of pages of information, she must now decide how to organize her report to the company's executives. For organizing her comparison, Tiffany can choose to use the divided pattern or the alternating pattern.

{|align=&quot;center&quot;

|+&lt;u&gt;'''Divided Pattern'''&lt;/u&gt;

!'''Machine A'''
|-
|Cost
|-
|Efficiency
|-
|Construction Time
|-
|Air Pollution
|-
|Et cetera
|-
!'''Machine B'''
|-
|Cost
|-
|Efficiency
|-
|Construction Time
|-
|Air Pollution
|-
|Et cetera
|}

{|align=&quot;center&quot;

|+&lt;u&gt;'''Alternating Pattern'''&lt;/u&gt;

!'''Cost'''
|-
|Machine A
|-
|Machine B
|-
!'''Efficiency'''
|-
|Machine A
|-
|Machine B
|-
!'''Construction Time'''
|-
|Machine A
|-
|Machine B
|-
!'''Air Pollution'''
|-
|Machine A
|-
|Machine B
|-
!'''Et Cetera'''
|-
|Machine A
|-
|Machine B
|}

===Partitioning===
Partitioning refers to describing an object. If a document must be written about a bicycle, a writer may divide the description into the smaller parts of the bicycle. A writer may first describe the braking system, then the gear system, then the frame, seat, and tires. By dividing the document into smaller parts, information becomes easier to locate and the document becomes more useful to the reader.

====Guidelines for Describing an Object====
# '''Choose a principle of classification suited to your readers and purpose.'''
# '''Use only one basis for partitioning at a time.'''
# '''Arrange the parts of your description in a way your readers will find useful.'''
# '''When describing each part, provide details that your readers will find useful.'''
# '''Include graphics if they will help your readers understand and use your information about the object.'''

===Segmenting===
Segmenting is similar to partitioning, except segmenting refers to describing a process. Typically, a writer will use segmenting when the goal of the document is for the reader to perform the process. Cookbook recipes are often segmented. When describing how to prepare a cake, the process to make the cake must be described first. Then, the process of making the frosting is described. After this, the recipe might explain how to frost the cake. By segmenting the document, the recipe is broken down into smaller, manageable steps.  This makes the process easier to perform for the reader.

A general description of a process explains the relationship of events over time. You may have either of two purposes in describing a process:

* To enable your readers to perform the process. For example, you may be writing instructions that will enable your readers to analyze the chemicals in a sample of live tissue, make a photovoltaic cell, apply for a loan, or run a computer program.
* To enable your readers to understand the process, For example, you might want your readers to understand the following:
** How something is done. For instance, how coal is transformed into synthetic diamonds.
** How something works. For instance, how the lungs provide oxygen to the bloodstream.
** How something happened. For instance, how the United States developed the space programs that eventually landed astronauts on the moon.

====Principles of Classification for Segmenting====
To determine where to segment the process, you need a principle of classification. Commonly used principles include the time when the steps are performed (first day, second day; spring, summer, fall), the purpose of the steps (to prepare the equipment, to examine the results), and the tools used to perform the steps(for example, table saw, drill press, and so on). Processes can be segmented by a variety of classification principles. Pick the principle that best supports your readers' goals.

====Guidelines For Segmenting====

# Choose a principle for segmenting suited to your readers and your purpose.
# Make your smallest groupings manageable.
# Describe clearly the relationships among the steps and groups of steps.
# Provide enough detail about each step to meet your readers' needs.
# Include graphics if they will help your readers understand and use your information about the process.

===Cause and Effect===
Documents organized by cause and effect help readers understand how one event is caused by another. Cause and effect documents often attempt to persuade readers that a cause and effect relationship actually exists. Cause and effect can be difficult to link. Evidence of the relationship must be chosen carefully. If used correctly, a document organized by cause and effect can be very persuasive and useful to a reader.

At work, you are likely to write about cause and effect for one of two distinct purposes.
* to help your readers understand a cause-and-effect relationship.
* to persuade your readers that a certain cause-and-effect relationship exists.
The strategies for organizing for these two purposes are somewhat different.

===Problem and Solution===
Problems and their solutions will be one of the most frequent topics of your on-the-job writing. The problems you discuss may arise from dissatisfaction with some strategy, product, process, or policy. Alternatively, they may arise from an aspiration to achieve a new goal, such as great efficiency, or take advantage of a new opportunity, such as the potential to do business in another country.

The goal of a document organized by problem and solution is to propose a future action. Like cause and effect documents, problem and solution documents need to be persuasive. The writer must first show that a problem exists, and then show that the proposed solution is the best method to solve the problem. Problem and solution documents are very common in business writing and often take the form of a [[Professional_and_Technical_Writing/Proposals|business proposal]].

====Guidelines For Persuading Readers To Accept Your Proposed Solution====
# Describe the problem in a way that make it seem significant to your readers.
# Describe your method.
# When describing your method, explain how it will solve the problem. Show them that your method is the best option for them given their circumstances. 
# Anticipate and respond to objections.
# Specify the benefits.
# Acknowledge the weaknesses of your solution. Your audience is going to find weaknesses whether you present them or not. Your ideas will look more credible if you acknowledge the weaknesses of your solution, and then show how they can be overcome.
# Include graphics if they will help your readers understand and approve your proposed solution.
# Avoid sounding confrontational. This will deter your readers. You need them to open to your ideas, not defensive of their ideas.
# Keep in mind that you won't be able to persuade all of your readers, all of the time. Sometimes, you have to accept that they acknowledge your suggestions. In time, they might still change their minds.
# Get straight to the point. Business people don't want to waste time listening to you beat around the bush; just give them what they need.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Different techniques are commonly used to determine or alter DNA sequences. The most important ones include:
#DNA sequencing: It provides us a lot of information about gene architecture, the control of gene expression, and protein structure.
#solid state synthesis of nucleic acids: The desired sequences of nucleic acids can be synthesized precisely de novo and used to identify or amplify other nucleic acids.
#restriction enzyme analysis: These Restriction Endonucleases provides an investigator to manipulate DNA segments by cutting them from the recognized sites.
#polymerase chain reaction (PCR) : This is one of the most useful methods to amplify DNA sequence billion fold. This technique requires denaturing of DNA and hybridizing primers complementary to strand forward and reverse and the DNA is synthesized on both strands in the 5' to 3' direction. This technique is used to recognize pathogens and genetic diseases, to determine the source of a hair left at the scene of a crime, and to resurrect genes from fossils.
#Blotting techniques: Southern and Northern Blots are used to separate DNA and RNA, respectively.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">=RNA Splicing=
RNA splicing is a modification of an RNA that takes place during the transcription of the primary transcript to the mRNA. Splicing refers to introns being cut out or removed, and the remaining sequence (called exons) being attached. This modification occurs in the nucleus, before the RNA is moved to the cytoplasm. 

Splicing happens in all the domains of life, but types of splicing differ immensely between the major divisions. Eukaryotes splice many protein-coding messenger RNAs and some non-coding RNAs. Prokaryotes, on the other hand, splice rarely, and when they do, it is mostly non-coding RNAs.
[[File:RNA SPLICING.gif|thumb|noncoding sequences, introns, are removed in transcript, and stich coding sequences, exons, together to exit nucleus and allow DNA sequences to be expressed.]]

==Discovery of RNA Splicing==
RNA splicing was discovered by two scientists Phillp Allen Sharp and Richard J. Roberts and they were awarded the 1993 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their achievement. The initial discovery of RNA splicing led to the resolution of an earlier paradox in which scientists had discovered RNA in the nucleus that was unusually long compared to the mRNA found in the cytoplasm of the cell. The strange nuclear RNA had a 5’ end containing a cap structure and a 3’ end that contained a polyadenosine [poly(A)] tract and these were similar structures found in the shorter mRNA found in the cytoplasm.  The subsequent discovery of splicing explained how the small mRNA could have the same termini as the longer nuclear RNA.  While the termini were the same, the lengths were different because introns had been removed from the middle of the strand.  These introns, it was discovered, proved to be a problem for the cell because, for example, a nearly a quarter of all mutations in globin genes responsible for beta-thalassemia came from problems in splicing. 

It became apparent through development of reactions that replicated RNA splicing that the splicing is done by a branch-shaped section of a lariat RNA and that such RNAs were integral to splicing.  Later it was found that these small snRNAs compiled particles found in spliceosomes. Via an intermediatemade up of lariatRNA and the 5’ exon-RNA, the spliceosome was able to remove the intron.  


==Spliceosome==
[[File:Minor spliceosome.jpg|thumb|Minor spliceosome]]

In eukaryotes, genes are transcribed to messenger RNAs comprising both introns and exons. For the production of validated mRNAs, the introns are to be trimmed off and the exons attached back together by the spliceosome, the molecular tailor of the cell. The spliceosome has the ability to alter its snipping and stitching process in order to generate variation  in mRNAs based on a single coil of pre-mRNA cloth. Alternative splicing is the process by which the spliceosome can develop  multiple mRNA isoforms from a single bolt of pre-mRNA. Such alternative splicing has enhanced evolutionary possibilities in complex multicellular organisms without the addition of gene number.

The spliceosome is considered as one of the most complicated macromolecular machine in the eukaryotic cell. It is involved with hundreds of RNA and protein mechanisms, specifically with assembly and disassembling pathways. The main role for a spliceosome in eukaryotes is to develop messenger RNAs. Genes are transcribed as precursors to mRNAs, called pre-mRNA, and then the RNAs are generated by the snipping and stitching of intron and exon components. Introns are regions of the pre-mRNA that are cut by spliceosomes to serve as a suorce of non-coding RNAs. Exons code for proteins so they are usually wanted. Furthermore, a spliceosome can uniquely snip and stitch in ways that will create different types of mRNA, which as  allowed evolution to allow organisms to increase in gene number and complexity. The reason why Spliceosome are considered one of the most complicated macromolecule machines in a cell is because they have the responsibility of properly recognizing and processing a large amount of sequences. For example, spliceosomes end up processing five small RNAs and up to 100 different polypeptides in budding yeast. To make things more complicated, humans even need to use a second splicing apparatus,  the minor spliceosome. In studying these complex machinery, many barriers were in the way because of the limitations in vivo. However, novel approaches to researching splicing have developed, such as in vitro assembly and purification of active spliceosomes, microscopic visualizations of single spliceosomes, and more. The advantages of these methods are that they are more specific and allow the wider boundary of studying either hundreds or a single RNA molecule. One of the new methods involves using microarrays. 

Using splicing-dependent microarrays allows researches to distinguish which features of the splicing cycle are universal or specific to pre-mRNAs. Groups of developed DNA arrays differentiate between spliced and unspliced RNAs and then are probed with cellular RNA to isolate even further. Analysis of the splicing response allowed the observation of how loss of activity in specific protein directly affected the splicing of individual pre-mRNA. Overall, the microarray has proved its importance of pre-mRNA identity by efficiently isolating the desired-protein. [[File:Microarray-schema.gif|thumb|Microarray-schema]]

Spliceosome analysis  have often times brought up significant obstacles in gaining understanding of more detailed mechanisms. To overcome such difficulties, laboratory techniques have employed methods like in vitro, which involves observing single pre-mRNA molecules, and active spliceosome purification, which includes well- characterized enzymes and controlled conditions. Although each chemical approach are relatively distinct, each contribute a complementary and synergistic view that heighten the knowledge of splicing machinery.

The spliceosome is a complex macromolecular machine consisting of small nuclear riobonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs): U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6, as well as roughly 100 separate splicing factors. The snRNAs range in length from 107-210 nucleotides; the snRNAs link with proteins to make small ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs). The snRNP contains a single snRNA and multiple proteins.

Splicing is carried out in multi-megadalton complexes. This means that the spliceosome is made of several components in an ordered manner. First, U1 snRNP binds to the 5’ splice site (SS). At the same time, branchpoint bridgeing protein (BBP) and Mud 2 binds to the branch site. Then, U2 snRNP will displace the BBP/Mud 2 and bind to the branch site. Next, U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP will also binds to the complex. Before splicing the RNA U1 and U4 will leave the complex and Prp19 will bind. After the splicing is completed, the spliceosome will undergo conformational change for the ligation process. After the ligation process, the components of the Spliceosome will degrade and be recycled. Therefore, each spliceosome is a single turnover enzyme

From all the new and developed techniques, it is not for certain that the spliceosome cycle in the body is far from simple, but rather an &quot;extraordinary dynamic and flexible machine&quot; The new technologies constantly bring new evidence of the detailed reversible, irreversible, kinetic, and mechanism interactions of the pre-mRNA substrate. There are still many things unknown about the spliceosome and its process. There is still limited structural information, which means many of its functional details are unavailable. Same with unknown kinetic understanding. However, the research of this dynamic machinery is still developing and continuing to discover new methods and information on its purpose.

==Pre-mRNA Slicing Process==
Splicing requires there to be three sequences in the introns. One end of the intron is the 5' splice site and the other end is the 3' splice site. At these sites are short consensus sequences. The sequence that exons are ordered in the mRNA usually correlates with the sequence in the corresponding DNA. The process is aided by spliceosomes, which are small RNA molecules that recognize the beginning of introns (usually GU) and the end (usually AG) and catalyze splicing at these sites. Changing a single nucleotide at these sites may prevent splicing to occur. There are also self-splicing introns. The third sequence important to splicing is located at the branch point. The branch point is where an adenine nucleotide lies from 18 to 40 nucleotides before the 3' splice site. The deletion or mutation of the adenine nucleotide at the branch point would prevent splicing. Splicing occurs in large structures called spliceosomes. 

Before splicing takes place, an intron between exon 1 and exon 2. Pre-mRNA splices in two steps. In step one, the pre-mRNA is spliced at the 5' splice site, separating exon 1 from the intron. The 5' end of the intron then attaches to the branch point folding back on itself and forming a structure called a lariat. The folding back occurs by the guanine nucleotide in the 5' consensus sequence bonding with the adenine nucleotide at the branch point through transesterification. In step two a splice is made at the 3' splice site and the 3' end of exon 1 is attached to the 5' end of exon 2. The intron is separated as a lariat and becomes linear when the bond breaks at the branch point and is then degraded by nuclear enzymes. And finally, the mature mRNA consisting of only the exons spliced together are moved to the cytoplasm and translated.

It is important to note that the 5' cap greatly affects pre-mRNA processing and mRNA export and if it were ever to be removed, then it would be known as the first irreversible step in mRNA decay which will affect the entire gene expression.

==Pre-mRNA Splicing: Constitutive vs Alternative==
Constitutive splicing pertains to the way mRNA is spliced in exactly the same way, every time with the splicesome

Alternative splicing allows for different expression of genes through SR proteins, which select alternative sites for splicing, using different exons or expressing them in a different order. By choosing combinations of alternative splice sites, protein isoforms can be created that are structurally and functionally distinct. It is estimated that at least 75% of human genes undergo this mechanism.

Another alternative splicing uses multiple 3' cleavage sites. There are 2 or more potential site for cleavage in a pre-mRNA sequence. However, this may or may not produce different proteins.

==Alternative splicing can occur under cellular Stress==
Because alternative splicing can control gene expression, it is an important mechanism that a cell can use in response to certain stressful environmental and pathological cellular conditions such as heat, cold, UV-light, oxygen, ion balance, infections, inflammation, fever, etc. 

Splicing factors can be enhancing (recognizing positive sequence elements) or silencing (recognizing negative sequence elements). These sequence elements can by exonic or intronic which determines whether they are included (exonic) or left out (intronic). The splicing enhancers are typically bound and activated by SR proteins. SR proteins are ‘serine/arginine-rich;’ they are a group of proteins that have been highly conserved throughout evolution that participate in both alternative and constitutive splicing. They are involved in regulating and selecting the splice sites.

'''Examples:''' 

Alternative or unconventional mRNA splicing can be part of adaptive stress responses in certain cell organelles, such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Moreover, abnormal mRNA splicing could also be related to cell apoptosis. Under stress conditions, unfolded proteins accumulate in the ER and form aggregates. These abnormal aglomerations engage a response process called unfolded protein response (UPR), which is triggered thanks to a few different stress sensors that reside in the ER. One of those sensors is inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α), a type I transmembrane protein, which once activated, initiates the abnormal splicing of the mRNA that encodes the transcription factor X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1), leading to the translation of a more stable spliced form of XBP1 (XBP1s).  XBP1s translocates to the nucleus, where it controls the upregulation of a subset of UPR-related genes linked to protein folding, quality control, ERAD and ER/Golgi biogenesis. Furthermore, prolonged ER stress leads to the inactivation of IRE1α signaling, which in turn is associated with the attenuation of XBP1 mRNA splicing, process that could sensitize cells to apoptosis.

In the heat-shock protein 47 (HSP47), the selection of the 5’ splice-site in the non-coding region of the pre-mRNA is performed more efficiently. In cold shock, alternative pre-mRNA splicing is induced in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) which brings about a cryptic exon. Stress induced long-term neuronal hypersensitivity is associated with stress-induced alternative splicing of the pre-mRNA of neuronal acetylcholinesterase (ACHE).



===Impact of Heat Shock Stress===
Many types of stress, including heat shock, can immediately block many crucial metabolic processes such as DNA replication until recovery. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) help protect cells from injury and aid cell recovery and after heat shock conditions subside. The blocking of pre-mRNA splicing in heat-shocked proteins is well characterized. HSPs are not affected in their expression, however, because they do not contain any introns.

SRp38 is an SR protein, that when overexpressed, antagonizes the activity of SR protein SF2/ASF (splicing factor 2/alternative splicing factor). SRp38 is unique in that, when phosphorylated, it activates sequence-specific splicing that requires an as of yet unidentified cofactor. This activity stems from SRp38’s entry into a complex with U1 and pre-mRNA which strengthens the interaction of U1 and U2 with pre-mRNA. SRp38 is a strong splicing repressor when dephosphorylated after heat shock; after mild heat shock it is rephosphorylated, accompanying the return of splicing activity. 

Nuclear stress bodies (nSBs) are proposed to control splicing activity under stress by bringing a set of splicing factors to the region where they bind to SATIII transcripts. The nSBs are the sites of accumulation of heat-shock factor 1 (HSF1) in human cells, and appear fleetingly after mild heat shock, chemical and hypertonic stresses. They are also the site of accumulation of pre-mRNA splicing factors (SF2/ASF, 9G8, SRp30c for the adenoviral E1A gene). The nSBs are assembled on regions of chromatin that consist of long satellite III (SatIII) DNA. After heat shock, chromatin reorganization occurs along with HSF1 transcription of SatIII RNAs. Recruitment of the SF2/ASF and SRp30c proteins requires the stress-induced SATIII transcripts. Reducing the transcription blocks the SR protein splicing factor recruitment.

===Structural Insights into RNA Splicing===
The study of introns and alternative splicing has lead to the additional classification for introns in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes.  Two groups of introns have been discovered.  The first group of introns, Group I, were the first self-splicing ribozymes to be discovered.  Group II introns were later reported.  The Group II intros have highly complex RNA structures and they also possess a unique diverse range of chemical reactivity.  The Group II intros possess the capability to catalyze the 2'-5' bond formation, and the ability to retrotranspose onto DNA.  Retrotranspositions onto DNA requires the help of intron-encoded proteins.  Specific analysis of Group II's secondary structure revealed six structural domains.  Domain V is the mos conserved phylogenetically (closely related among various groups of organisms).  The lower helix of Domain V possess a catalytic triad that consists of nucleotides that is very similar to that of a spliceosome called U6 spliceosomal RNA.  This has led to the belief that Group II introns share acommon ancestor with nuclear introns and the eukaryotic splliceosome.  This has led to further meticulous study of Group II introns.  

===Study of Group II Introns===
Group II introns have been further classified into thre main structural elements based on their RNA secondary sturcture.  The three groups are IIA, IIB, and IIC.  Analysis by reverse transcriptases have shown that group IIC introns are the most primal and simplistic lineage of the Group II introns.  The secondary structure of lineage IIC is much simple than that of IIA and IIB.  Beucase the Group IIC are much smaller and simplistic, they are much more preferred by study of crystallization.  Oceanobacillus iheyensis was the first organism to have its Group II intron successfully crystallized and examined via x-ray diffraction.  Group IIC is also significantly different from Group IIA and IIB by the fact that the nucleophile used during the first step of the splicing is a water molecule.  Group IIA and IIB use a 2'-OH nucleophile from the adenosine in Domain VI.  Because Group IIC uses a water molecule the introns released are linear molecules, while Groups IIA and IIB introns will be released as a lariat branched species.  The use of the Group IIC intron has further suggest that the active site is composed of the bulge and catalytic triad of Domain V, mentioned above.  It has been shown that these regions are influenced by the binding of catalytic metal ions, i.e. magnesium.  This meatal ion interaction is very common in protein in order to influence shape, i.e. Fe hemoglobin.  The ion helps modulate the eclectrostatic environment at the core of the intron or protein.  The metal ion interaction can also make or breack the phosphodiester linkages in the DNA and RNA polymerases.

===Possible Splicing Errors===
Although the rate of splicing errors is very low, it does happen occasionally due to several distinct possibilities.  A splicing error will most likely result in a mutation of a splice site and could compound into losing the function of the particular site.  An exposure of a premature stop codon or a misplace/misinserted exon or intron could all lead to a mutation.  A mutation from variations in the splice location which could cause a wrong amino acid to be interpreted.  A misinterpreted amino acid could result in reducing specificity.  All mutations could result in wrongly constructed proteins, which can be life threatening, i.e. cickle cell anemia or cystic fombrosis.  Fortunately many splicing errors can be safeguarded by Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay.

===Nonsense-Mediated Decay===
Nonsense mediated decay is the cellular mechanism of mRNA that exists to detect incorrectly spliced information, and to prevent the expression of incorrect proteins.  After transcription the mRNA will reassemble with ribonucleoprotein.  Nonsense mediated decay is initiated by exon junction comples that are cut out from the genetic information during the mRNA processing.  Exon junction complexes located past a nonsense codon act as tags for the mRNA ribonucleoprotein, RNP.  The RNP is able to recognize disorganizantion and wrong splicing from the pressence of these exons that were supposed to be cut out.The nonsense mediated decay will transport the excon tagged misinformation set out the nucleus and into the cytosol where the misinformation RNA is degraded.

You have already learnt the Gurmukhi script for writing Punjabi, 
the Muharni for speaking Punjabi and some Punjabi vocabulary. 
In this Module you will learn to use Punjabi for communicating with people.

'''''If you have not mastered the Gurmukhi script and Muharni you are strongly advised to go back to the [[Punjabi/Gurmukhi|Gurmukhi]] script and [[Punjabi/Muharni|Muharni]] modules and practise there thoughly before returning. In this module you will be expected to have basic skill of reading and writing the Punjabi words.'''''

This module contains eight lessons each containing a number of parts and sub parts. 
Each part along with its sub parts will be learnt in one session of approximately one hour.

==Horn Repertoire revert==

The edit you just reverted at http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Horn/Repertoire/Solos_and_Concertos was a completely purposeful one, and not an accident. I appreciate your willingness to contribute to the Wikibook, but please actually read an edit before you assume it's spam. If you think that the edit is incorrect or in bad faith, please bring it up on my IP talk page or the talk page of the wikibook. Thanks. [[Special:Contributions/128.120.172.74|128.120.172.74]] ([[User talk:128.120.172.74|talk]])
:To the contrary, Daniel Bickerton is not anywhere near as notable as other composers mentioned on this page, and the piece is not a standard part of the repertoire. A google search of his name in quotes brings up roughly two hundred entries, many of which are about an 11 year old soccer player in Britain. As a Horn Performance major in college, I have never even heard of Mr. Bickerton, much less the individual pieces mentioned. None of them have ever been recorded or released on a major label. In fact, a google search for &quot; &quot;Daniel bickerton&quot; horn&quot; brings up only five links, one of which is this page on wikibooks, two more of which are from wikipedia, one of which leads to a page which lists Daniel bickerton in the metatext, and the last which lists Daniel Bickerton as a pianist in a recital at his college. I have found absolutely no mention of either of Mr. Bickerton's horn pieces except on this wikibook and on wikipedia; the related content was added to both wikis by the same IP address around the same time. Please, if you have something substantial to defend this claim that Mr. Bickerton has made a notable contribution to Horn literature, let me know. Otherwise please do not revert it again.

__NOTOC__

When two people of equal status like friends, relatives of equal age etc. meet an informal dialog takes place. However when two people of unequal status like an officer and a subordinate or an uncle and a nephew meet a formal dialog takes place. Formal and informal dialogs differ in terminology usage. In this lesson you will learn how people meet, formally and informally. Various types of meeting and parting greetings will introduced in the lesson.

=== Meeting known people - Formal meeting ===

Rajesh (ਰਾਜੇਸ਼), the pupil meets his teacher Sohan Singh (ਸੋਹਣ ਸਿੰਘ). 
The meeting being among two people of unequal status is formal in nature.

'''Explanations'''
*Rajesh (ਰਾਜੇਸ਼), the student on seeing his teacher, Sohan Singh (ਸੋਹਣ ਸਿੰਘ), adresses him as 'ਮਾਸਟਰ ਜੀ - masterji' and follows up with the greeting 'ਸਤਿ ਸ੍ਰੀ ਅਕਾਲ - Sat Sri Akal'. ਮਾਸਟਰ is used here to mean a ''school teacher''. The addage ਜੀ is used as a mark of respect for elders here the school teacher. It is also used with a name or any word used as an address in polite and formal conversation. ਸਤਿ ਸ੍ਰੀ ਅਕਾਲ is a greeting, literally meaning ''God is truth''. It is used both as a meeting as well as a parting greeting. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
*The greeting by Rajesh evokes a similar greeting from Sohan Singh (ਸੋਹਣ ਸਿੰਘ), the teacher, who reponds with same greeting 'ਸਤਿ ਸ੍ਰੀ ਅਕਾਲ'. He follows it up by enquiring about his pupil's well being by asking 'ਰਾਜੇਸ਼, ਤੁਹਾਡਾ ਕੀ ਹਾਲ ਹੈ? - Rajesh, how are you?'. ਤੁਹਾਡਾ means ''your'', ਹਾਲ means ''state'' (of well being or health), ਕੀ means ''what'' and ਹੈ means ''is''. So ਸੋਹਣ ਸਿੰਘ is asking ਰਾਜੇਸ਼ as to ''what is his state of well being'' or ''how his health is'' or ''how he is'' i.e. ''how does he do''?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
*Rajesh (ਰਾਜੇਸ਼) responds by telling the teacher 'ਮੈਂ ਠੀਕ ਹਾਂ, ਮਾਸਟਰ ਜੀ। - I am alright, masterji.' ਮੈਂ means ''I'', ਹਾਂ means ''am'' and ਠੀਕ  means ''O.K.'' or ''alright''. He also enquires about the health of his teacher by asking 'Is your health alright? - ਕੀ ਤੁਹਾਡੀ ਸਿਹਤ ਠੀਕ ਹੈ?'. Here ਤੁਹਾਡੀ means ''your'' and ਸਿਹਤ means ''health''.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
*Sohan Singh (ਸੋਹਣ ਸਿੰਘ) tells Rajesh(ਰਾਜੇਸ਼) that 'ਮੈਂ ਤੰਦਰੁਸਤ ਹਾਂ। - I am in good health.' The word ਤੰਦਰੁਸਤ means ''good health''. He continues the conversation by asking Rajesh (ਰਾਜੇਸ਼) 'ਕੀ ਤੇਰੇ ਮਾਤਾ ਪਿਤਾ ਵੀ ਠੀਕ ਹਨ? - Are your parents alright?' Word ਮਾਤਾ means ''mother'' and ਪਿਤਾ means ''father'' and the combined phrase ਮਾਤਾ ਪਿਤਾ means ''parents''.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
*Finally Rajesh (ਰਾਜੇਸ਼) tells the teacher 'ਹਾਂ, ਮਾਸਟਰ ਜੀ ਉਹ ਵੀ ਠੀਕ ਹਨ। - Yes masterji, they are alright.)' The word ਠੀਕ literally means ''correct'' or ''right''. Here it is used to mean that a person has right health i.e. he is in right state of health.

==== Other variants of greetings ====

Greetings have many religio-cultural variants. Sat Sri Akal (ਸਤਿ ਸ੍ਰੀ ਅਕਾਲ) is used by followers of Sikhism. 
Hindus use Namaste or Namaskar (ਨਮਸਤੇ or ਨਮਸਕਾਰ) whereas the followers of Islam use Aslama Lekim (ਅਸਲਾਮਾ ਲੇਕਿਮ). 
In this dialog Sohan Singh responds to the greeting Sat Sri Akal (ਸਤਿ ਸ੍ਰੀ ਅਕਾਲ) with 
same greeting Sat Sri Akal (ਸਤਿ ਸ੍ਰੀ ਅਕਾਲ). Namaste or Namaskar (ਨਮਸਤੇ or ਨਮਸਕਾਰ) evokes either of 
these two greetings. However Aslama Lekim (ਅਸਲਾਮਾ ਲੇਕਿਮ) evokes Va Lekim Islam (ਵਾ ਲੇਕਿਮ ਇਸਲਾਮ).

=== Meeting known people - Informal meeting ===

Now suppose the persons Sunil (ਸੁਨੀਲ) and Sanjeev (ਸੰਜੀਵ) are friends. The dialog that takes place between the two, when they meet, will be informal and may look like this.

{| class=wikitable width=100%
|-
! Dialog
! Romanisation
! English translation
|-
|'''ਸੁਨੀਲ''' : ਹੈਲੋ ਸੰਜੀਵ।ki haal hai
|'''Sunil''' : Hello Sanjeev.
|'''Sunil''' : Hello Sanjeev.
|-
|'''ਸੰਜੀਵ''' : ਹੈਲੋ ਸੁਨੀਲ, ਤੂੰ ਕਿਵੇਂ ਹੈਂ ?
|'''Sanjeev''' : Hello Sunil, tu kiven hein?
|'''Sanjeev''' : Hello Sunil, how are you?
|-
|'''ਸੁਨੀਲ''' : ਮੈਂ ਠੀਕ ਹਾਂ, ਤੂੰ ਕਿਵੇਂ ਹੈਂ?
|'''Sunil''' : Mein theek haan, tu kiven he?
|'''Sunil''' : I am alright, how are you?
|-
|'''ਸੰਜੀਵ''' : ਮੈਂ ਵੀ ਠੀਕ ਹਾਂ, ਤੇਰੇ ਮਾਤਾ ਪਿਤਾ ਠੀਕ ਹਨ?
|'''Sanjeev''' : Mein vi theek haan, tere maata pita theek han?
|'''Sanjeev''' : I am also alright, are your parents alright?
|-
|'''ਸੁਨੀਲ''' : ਹਾਂ, ਉਹ ਵੀ ਠੀਕ ਹਨ।
|'''Sunil''' : Haan, oh vi theek han.
|'''Sunil''' : Yes, they are also alright.
|-
|}

'''Please note here that:'''&lt;br&gt;
*When Sunil spots Sanjeev he adresses him with an informal 'Hello Sanjeev - ਹੈਲੋ ਸੰਜੀਵ' instead of the expected formal 'Namaste'.
*In the same fashion Sanjeev responds informally with a similar 'Hello Sunil - ਹੈਲੋ ਸੁਨੀਲ'.
*The manner of enquiry of well being by both from the other is also informal 'ਤੂੰ ਕਿਵੇਂ ਹੈਂ? - how are you?' In a formal conversation this could be 'ਕੀ ਤੁਸੀਂ ਠੀਕ ਹੋ? - are you alright?'

:Hi there Robdurbar. [[WB:ADMIN|Administrators]] are experienced users who have been entrusted by the communities to perform some extra maintenance tasks. Since you've only just arrived, I don't think you're ready for those tools. However there's plenty you can do to help out aside from contributing content. There [[Template:Backlog|a list]] of tasks which are generally backlogged - anyone can help with those. As well, [[Wikibooks:Maintenance]] lists some additional useful things you can help with. And, of course, you can help us by contributing content - find a textbook you're interested in and try to improve it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Oligonucleotide mutagenesis is a process in which a specific DNA sequence is incorporated into a vector (such as a plasmid or lambda phage) to introduce a new function into that molecule. Mutagenesis allows the insight into how proteins fold, catalyze reactions, act as substrates and process information. Cloned gene proteins can be used medically in a number of ways. For instance, insulin and interferon can be obtained from production of bacteria. DNA probes may be manufactured for discovery of genetic diseases, cancer, and bacterial infections. Two main forms are used to produce these modified proteins, Site directed mutagenesis and oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. The later is used if restriction sites are absent.

Mutagenesis is the process of changing or creating genetic information. This process can occur naturally or made by using different methods. There are more approaches involving mutagenesis methods. One method is a method of site-directed mutagenesis using mismatched oligunucleotides. Second method is cassette mutagenesis by annealing complimentary oligonucleotides. Third method is PCR by generating a mutant fragment starting from a double-stranded DNA template using mismatched oligonucleotides. Mutagenesis is also used by experimenters to analyze DNA. Site mediated mutagenesis mutates one sequence of amino acids to determine that specific sequences overall purpose once it stops working. This is an example of experimenters using Mutagenesis.

==Site-Directed Mutagenesis==
[[Image:SiteMuta.gif|thumb|300px|Site-Directed Mutagenesis]]In site-directed mutagenesis, individual amino acids in the primary structure of a protein are replaced by changing the DNA sequence of a cloned gene. The process involves removal of a DNA segment and replacement of that segment with a chemically synthesized segment identical to the original but with the desired change. The steps are as follows: A recombinant plasmid containing the gene of interest is treated with a restriction endonuclease to cleave the sequence of interest. The synthetic DNA fragment with the specific base pair change is inserted into the plasmid. This is done using a DNA ligase. The plasmid then contains the gene with the desired nucleotide base pair change.

Site directed mutagenesis is also useful for testing the validity of an enzymatic mechanism.

==Oligonucleotide-Directed Mutagenesis==
[[Image:Oligo Muta.gif|thumb|Oligonucleotide-Directed Mutagenesis|left]]This form of mutagenesis creates a specific DNA sequence change. This method makes point mutations, differing in a single nucleotide. In this process, a DNA strand is synthesized with the specific nucleotide base pair change and annealed to the copy of the gene in a plasmid. Increasing the temperature allows for the mismatched base pair to be substituted in order for this reaction to occur. This annealed strand acts as a primer for the complementary strand to be synthesized in the plasmid. Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis uses DNA polymerase, dNTPs and DNA ligase. The result are two types of progeny: one with the original sequence and another with the new sequence.

==Cassette Mutagenesis==
[[Image:Cassette mutagenesis.jpg|thumb|Cassette Mutagenesis]]
Cassette Mutagenesis is the replacement a region of DNA with new sequences. Any length and sequence can be replaced by this method. Therefore, more variations of proteins can be made. By taking advantage of this, new mutant sequences can be made.
The Cassette Mutagenesis uses the original gene containing restriction sites. This site allows cleavage of the gene and produce the region where the new DNA is inserted. After appropriate restriction sites are identified in a vector, the vector is cleaved at the two sites by using a endonucleotide. The new sequence is inserted and ligated in the region produced. The new sequence allows a variety of studies on protein structures or nucleic acid sequences that have not been explored before.

==Polymerase Chain Reaction==
[[Image:Pcr.gif|thumb|Polymerase Chain Reactions|350px]]Polymerase chain reaction is used for recombination of sequences and mutagenesis. This method is very useful because it is a fast reaction and it is not limited by any restriction sites. In the PCR, oligonucleotide primers are incorporated into the ends of the product DNA. The 5' ends of these primers can contain any desired sequence. two PCR products are added by PCR. They are mixed, denatured, and reannealed. There are two different sequences produced. One is 5' overlapping strands which is not productive. 3' overllapping strand is produced and reactive. The polymerase extends the 3'strand. In this process, the 3' strand acts as primers. The whole process are repeated by producing synthetic sequences. This overlapping by joining two DNA fragments together can produce mutatation in PCR fragment.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Placebo Effect: Do You Believe Your Teacher?==
===Teacher's Notes===
Although the placebo effect isn’t mentioned much in the classroom, it’s a fascinating
subject delving deep into the human mind. It also gives students an idea of factors
to be taken into consideration when working as a scientific researcher….or even in
clinical trials!

This lesson will introduce students to the placebo effect and how it can influence
scientific experiments. The experiment will involve measuring the reaction times of a
control group, a group who believe they have taken a stimulant and a group who
have taken a stimulant. The activity could last between 30-60 minutes, depending
on how many experiments are carried out.

You may not want to mention the word “placebo” right at the beginning, so as to not
give the game away up front.

===Aim:===

To uncover the placebo effect in your classroom

===Learning objectives:===
* To understand that measuring the physical effect of a drug can be influenced by psychological factors.
* That scientists need to take this into account when collecting evidence on the effectiveness of a drug.
* To understand the need to collect accurate measurements and to analyse data and present it in a graphical form and identify patterns.
* To describe the placebo effect.
* To consider the other factors that might limit the reliability of the results.
* To work effectively as a team.
* To model the job of a medical researcher.
* To evaluate an experiment and suggest improvements.

===Learning outcomes:===

* All students will learn that stimulants such as caffeine can speed up reactions.
* All students will be able to measure pulse rate accurately.
* All students will be able to carry out an experiment that will mimic a doubleblind trial.
* All students will work well as a team.
* All students will be able to draw graphs.
* Most students will believe taking a drug can influence your body.
* Most students will be able to identify dependent and independent variables.
* Most students should be able to identify patterns in results and identify when these results do not follow the expected pattern of scientific results.
* Most students will know what researchers do to minimise the placebo effect.
* Some students will see the link between the classroom experiment and the real world of medical research.

===Resources:===

* Orange juice/Lemonade/Water (control)
* Decaffeinated cola*
* Caffeinated cola*
* Clean drinking cups
* 1 metre rulers
* Stopwatches

(*can use Diet versions of the drinks, so as to not promote unhealthy lifestyles!)

Depending on how many lessons are run on this topic, students may need to be
supplied with results collected from the previous lesson, resources on the placebo
effect, and sheets to record their results on (or access to a computer to input their
results directly into a spreadsheet). Examples of student sheets are provided with
this activity.

===Tests to monitor the effect of caffeine on the students:===

Simple tests (see “Tests to Do” sheet) include a reaction test (metre-rule drop) and
a memory test or by a selection of objects presented to the class (as in Kim’s game).
Students have a set time (one minute or less) to memorise as many objects as
possible. After one minute they have to recall as many as possible.

Other tests are the following online ones, totally up to you which ones to do, and
how to monitor the results (before and after drinking caffeinated drinks!)

====Reaction time tests:====

* http://www.exploratorium.edu/baseball/reactiontime.html : a baseball-themed reaction tester. You’re given a reaction time in milliseconds based on how quickly you swing your bat.
* http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/java/dottime.html : click on the dot as it moves around the grid, as many times as possible in 30 seconds. The number of “hits” can be used to measure reactions. Just a simple version of the “whack-a-mole” game.
* http://www.sciencenetlinks.com/interactives/zap.html : “zap” the fly, good for low ability/SEN groups to test reaction times.
* http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/humanbody/sleep/sheep/ ...and the most fun: shoot tranquilliser darts at sheep as they try to escape! No, we’re really not that mean, but it is addictive.

====Memory tests:====

* http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/stm0.html : a basic short memory test where six groups of letters flash up to be memorised (this would suit a mid to low ability set). Requires a projector/whiteboard.
* http://www.jcu.edu.au/studying/services/studyskills/studysmart/memory.html : a memory test which displays words to be memorised and students enter them into the space provided. This one would need an ICT lab, so each student has access to a computer.
* http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/humanbody/mind/interactives/intelligenceandmemory/memorytest/ : memorise the words on the screen in the correct order, then drag and drop into sequence. Requires a projector/whiteboard.
* http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/humanbody/sleep/tmt/ : this one tests facial recognition. Forty-eight faces are displayed to be memorised in two groups. Students are then asked to decide if a displayed face was in group 1, 2 or neither. This one would need an ICT lab, and takes a bit of time (there are a few seconds' delay between each face!)
* http://www.funbrain.com/match/ and http://www.oddtodd.com/concentration/memory.htm are two “SNAP”-like games, you pick two cards or pictures until you match them into pairs. Who said games weren’t educational?

Since you’ll be choosing different tests to do with the class, you may need to alter
the way in which the results are recorded.

===Safety:===

Caffeine allergy is a recognised medical occurrence. Students should be consulted.
If any suffer from this condition or would rather not take caffeine they can be part of
the control group. Drinking should not happen in the lab. It would be better if this
was done in a classroom. The cups should be clean and students should be told that
they will be drinking cola. Normal laboratory safety procedures apply.

===Adaptations and other ideas:===

* For those of you wanting to make a “shaky hand tester” (MadLab’s Wonky Wire activity) to study the steadiness of hand, see: http://www.madlab.org/kits/wonky.html (this would add a dash of physics and electronics to the lesson!)
* BBC News story: Coffee Makes You Forgetful: http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3909085.stm
* Caffeine is a diuretic, so students may want to go to the toilet more. Fancy recording how many toilet breaks are requested?
* Reaction test partnered up with general knowledge: try a “Who Wants To Be A Millionaire”-type “Fastest Finger First” quiz (best done with interactive keypads, or an ICT lab).
* Force meters can be used to test your muscle strength (weakens with caffeine ingestion).
* Caffeine also causes bronchodilation. Try using a handheld peak flow meter (used for asthmatics, these are cheap and available from chemists) to get an indication of airways’ resistance.

===ICT:===

Online reaction or memory tests, looking at websites for information on the placebo
effect, other research, using spreadsheets to calculate values and order data.

Keywords: Placebo effect, double-blind trial, ethics, heart rate, pulse rate, caffeine, research.

===Citizenship:===

Work-related learning, learning to work in teams, making informed choices and
interacting with the media, significance of the media in society, being informed about
the world of medical research.

===Assessment opportunities:===

To plan investigating correctly identifying variables, collect and record results
accurately, testing a hypothesis and taking other factors into account, analyse data
to find patterns, planning skills, recording observations, measuring, ICT skills
(optional), graph drawing skills and making conclusions.

===Curriculum links:===

Considering anomalies in observations or measurements and trying to explain them;
the ways in which diet, exercise, smoking and drugs affect health (consistent with
PSHE programme); does evidence match the predictions? What effects do drugs
have on how the body works physically and mentally?
===Lesson 1===

====Starter activity:====
Introduction to caffeine (see background notes sheet). Show the video taken through
a microscope of a daphnia flea. Get the students to count the heart beat of the flea
before and after the addition of a small amount of caffeine. Students should note
that the heart beat increases. Students could discuss the reasons for this. (8 minutes
total).

====Core level main activity:====

1. Students then plan how to conduct the same experiment on themselves.
Students should consider the independent variable, the dependent variable,
the level of accuracy of the readings and a suitable source of caffeine.
Planning sheets can be used to save time and students will need help in
learning how to measure their pulse. They should also pay particular attention
to other external factors that could affect their pulse during the experiment
and so affect the results. (10 -15 minutes).

2. Students take their resting heart beat for 15 seconds then multiply by 4.
These results are then entered into a spreadsheet (on a computer or on a
prepared transparency). Students may have opted for a second reading to
ensure that their results were accurate. (3 minutes).

3. Students are asked to drink cola (note safety information). They must not
know that half of the cups contain a caffeinated drink and the other half a
non-caffeinated drink. Students should note down the number of the cup they
drank from. The teacher will reveal the actual nature of the drink at a latter
point in the lesson. (5 minutes).

4. While the students are waiting (about 10-15 minutes) for the caffeine to take
effect they should consider reliability. How many of the students’ results are
needed to increase to be sure that caffeine has an effect? (10 minutes).
5. Then students take their pulse again. Results are then collected on the
spreadsheet as before.

6. Reveal to the students that only half students actually had caffeine. Can they
work out which students had caffeine from the results? Highlight on the sheet
the students who had caffeine. What does that do to the results?

7. Discussion on the fact that students who did not have caffeine still saw a rise
in heart rate. Why did this happen? Was it because they believed the teacher?

====Plenary:====

Sum up what has been found out, or not found out. What problems might there be
when doctors are trying to find out if a drug is effective? Explain the placebo effect.

====Alternative way to run the lesson:====

Another option would be to distribute the cups in three batches. Batch A contains a
non-caffeinated beverage such as orange juice or lemonade (check the ingredients)
and will be used as a control group. Batch B and C should contain decaffeinated and
caffeinated cola respectively. Students should be told that both are caffeinated. And
they should be made clear from onset that the effects of drinking caffeine include: an
increased pulse/heart rate, faster reaction times, improved alertness, reduced
memory and shakier hands!

Explain to the students that they will be testing the effects of caffeine on reaction
speeds, the method for testing reflexes and demonstrate. There are two main
methods, using an online reaction speed test or catching a dropped metre rule (see
the attached worksheet or the online instructions for details of each experiment).
Students can at this point make a hypothesis and practice the experiment until 10-
15 minutes have passed since drinking. Try to encourage students to consider why
it is important to wait for this period.

When students have experimented to test their reaction times and repeated this
several times, each group should get together and record all of their times. These
can then be put either into a spreadsheet or onto a whiteboard for the class to
consider. Once all results are on the board it can be revealed that Group B had a
decaffeinated cola and C had a caffeinated cola. Highlight that an increase in
reactions due to the belief that you have taken a stimulant is because of the ‘Placebo
Effect’. A placebo effect occurs when something which cannot have any effect, does
in fact have the same or similar effect as the drug or experiment being tested. This
is usually due to the person being tested believing that they are receiving a drug.

Discuss the differences between results. Hopefully Group A will have slightly longer
reaction times compared to Groups B and C. Ask why there is any difference at all
between Groups A and B as neither took caffeine.

====Homework tasks:====

* To research the placebo effect.
* Practise measuring other people’s pulses.
* Do you believe in the effects of homeopathy/herbal medicine? Why?
* Create your own advert for an imaginary product which has amazing health benefits? Do you think you could successfully market it?

===Lesson 2===

====Starter activity:====

Look at results on sugar pills killing pain and the curious effect of the placebo
operation (sham operations). Students may have found other examples of data
showing the placebo effect from their homework. (5 to 10 minutes).

====Core level main activity:====

1. Students are given a table of the results that they collected last lesson.
They have been collected into caffeinated and decaffeinated cola drinkers.
The difference between the before and after pulse rates (or reaction
times). Students can as a class or in groups discuss where there is
sufficient evidence here to see the placebo effect. Students should then
summarise their findings in a conclusion and explain their findings with
scientific theory. (10 minutes).

2. Then students could evaluate the effectiveness of the method that they
used. Was it right that they were tricked into believing that they were
drinking caffeinated cola? Was there a control in their experiment? How
could they add a control (if one wasn’t used) - class discussion? (10
minutes).

3. Planning of the experiment conducted on another class. With their new
found knowledge they are now in a position to conduct the experiment
with one or even two classes. The class could be split into two groups and
conduct the experiment on two other classes. They will need to set out a
common method. It is suggested that they split the subjects into three
categories, caffeinated, decaffeinated and water (the suggested control
group). The students will have to mock up the double-blind model so that
the person pouring the cola is separated from the person serving the cola.
The teacher could discuss the subliminal signals the server could give if
they knew what was in the drink. It is also a useful exercise to get the
students to write a consent form (a sample is provided) so the subjects
will allow the results to be used and published (well, presented in the
classroom!). It is advisable to split the large research group up in the
following roles (20 minutes):

:a. The research leader: to coordinate the team and present results.

:b. The explainers: two students will prepare a statement which they will read to the class being experimented upon. This will invite the students to take part in the experiment, inform them of the theory that is being investigated and explain what will happen to them. They will have to make sure that not too much information is given away.

:c. Researcher to organise the subjects in the “waiting room” ensuring that there is calm so heart beats are not raised.

:d. Administration staff to collect permission signatures and interview students as to what they had consumed earlier.

:e. Pulse readers: they may want to prepare for this at home or if available pulse meters could be used.

:f. Cola server: to note down the number of the cup given to the student and to guard the cola.

:g. Cola pourer: this student needs to be isolated in the corner of the room.

4. In this lesson the students will only plan the operation and organise the
logistics, they will present their plan and employee list at the end of the
lesson. (5 minutes).

For those who may need a hand, it may be useful to provide details of what a
double-blind trial entails: Sometimes doctors and scientists don’t know which way is
best to treat patients, so comparisons are made between treatments. Patients are
put into groups and each group is given a different treatment and the results are
compared. To make sure the groups start off the same, each one is put into a group
randomly. So this is known as a randomised trial. In a blind trial, the patient won’t
know which treatment group they’re in. In a double-blind trial, the patients and the
doctors don’t know which group the patients are in (but if they need to know, they
have a way of finding out!) The reason for such testing is to prevent any bias in
scientific research.

====Plenary:====

Bring the lesson together by discussing the students’ expectations for the
next lesson. It will be useful to discuss professionalism and ethics and perhaps
discuss a set of rules which they will all keep to until the next lesson.

===Lesson 3===

====Starter activity:====

Put up a list of experiments and students are asked to identify which ones might
suffer from the placebo effect. (Or perhaps a video clip on the topic, video
introduction perhaps from a doctor talking about the placebo effect with their
patients and the effect they can have - 2 minutes).

====Core level main activity:====
1. Review the plans created last lesson. (5 minutes).

2. Students get “into role” – as devised in previous lesson (5 minutes).

3. Organise classroom furniture to allow a conveyor belt of activities, i.e. read
information sheet, sign consent form, have pulse taken, drink cola, wait, have
pulse taken again. (5 minutes).

4. Conduct experiment (40 minutes). Students also collect results together on a
shared spreadsheet or collect them all and hand in to the teacher.

5. Review class discussion on the experiment. What were their successes, what
went well?

Depending on time constraints, this next part could be done in a following lesson:

1. Students are given a table of the results that they collected last lesson. It
should be possible to compare the results collected by the two groups. Which
results are reliable, are there any differences? What should they do to the
results to see if the placebo effect happened? (15 minutes).

2. Students can then analyse the results and present them in the form of a
graph (15 minutes).

3. Students are to draw general conclusions to the experiment as a whole. (15
minutes).

====Plenary:====

How has this lesson influenced how they view taking medical drugs and
receiving advice from their doctor?

===Extension:===

Discuss how powerful the placebo effect is. Certain drugs claim to “buzz you up” so
that you can concentrate better, whereas others claim to “calm you down” so that
you can concentrate better? Is this possible? But with the placebo effect in place,
who knows…

And for those of you interested in sports science:

Caffeine was never banned in training, but was controlled in competition, and the
urine concentration had to be below 12 ng/ml. The World Anti-Doping Agency
(WADA; http://www.ada-ama.org/en/) sets the list of banned substances in sport,
and caffeine was removed from the list in 2004, but is now on the monitoring list i.e.
they look at the concentrations, but take no action. So not to worry if you have a cup
of coffee on your way to the gym, then!

The Placebo Effect: Feedback from teachers who trialled and designed the
experiment

The placebo experiment was trialled with a top set Year 8 class. The majority of
them (all but two) had heard of the term “placebo effect” but only a few of them
knew what it meant and could describe it accurately. One student understood the
concept of a double-blind trial.

It would be better to say less at the start, and have more of a discussion around the
results. In the first trial of the experiment, I found that I did too much talking, and
the students tried to force the effect onto the results.

We collected a vast range of results in the first trial of the experiment. A great deal
of the discussion afterwards was on the statistical significance of the results, which
would have to be handled carefully with most Year 8 classes.

The same class conducted the experiment on two other Year 8 classes, having
planned the experiment themselves. They also measured the pulse rate of the other
students. This caused more discussions as they questioned the accuracy of each
others’ methods of taking accurate pulse readings. We mimicked a true clinical trial
process by even getting students to give their written consent. Students particularly
enjoyed this part of the lesson and paid particular attention the logistics of the
activity.

These activities came at the end of an extensive investigation on the effect of
caffeine and aspirin on daphnia heart beats under a microscope. The students were
fully aware that caffeine did speed up the effect of the heart beat.

===Student Worksheets===

'''Do you believe your teacher?'''

What happens when you drink a caffeinated drink (either coffee or cola)?

Try out all or some of the following tests before you have a caffeinated drink:
* Reaction test (how fast are your reflexes?)
* Take your pulse (how many heartbeats per minute?)
* Memory test (how good is your memory/concentration?)
* Steadiness of hand (how shaky are your hands?)

Make a note of your measurements, then have your caffeinated drink, wait 10-15
minutes, and then do the tests again. Have your measurements changed?

Before drink After drink
Reaction time
Pulse measurement
Memory test
Steadiness of hand

What drink did you have? Are you surprised at what happened?

Clinical Trials in the Classroom: Do your friends believe you?

In this activity, you are the scientists and administrative staff conducting research on your
friends…. What were your results? Do your friends believe everything they hear from you?

==1. Describe the national, state or provincial, AY, Pathfinder, and Christian flags.==

The flag is divided through the center both vertically and horizontally making four equal parts. The background colors are royal blue and white alternately sewed together with the upper left hand comer being royal blue. The Pathfinder emblem is centered in the heart of the background. The colors are descriptive of the purposes and ideals of Pathfindering. White means purity, blue means loyalty, red reminds us of the shed blood of Christ (sacrifice), and gold means excellence. The symbols also have meanings. The shield is the protection of God, the sword is his word, the Bible, and the triangle represents completeness. Completeness of the Godhead (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit), and completeness of the three parts of education (Mental, Physical, and Spiritual).]]

===Current state/provincial flags===
&lt;!-- Find images of all the provincial flags of your country and put them here.  --&gt;
&lt;gallery&gt;




&lt;/gallery&gt;

==2. Know how to display the national flag with two other flags under the following situations: a. Camp out/camporee b. Fair c. Pathfinder Day program d. Parade==
==3. Demonstrate how to fold and salute your national flag. Mention when and how it should be displayed. ==
===Folding===
===Flag Protocol===
==4. Explain the meaning of and reason for the National Anthem, and recite the words from memory. ==
==5. Give the rights and responsibilities of a citizen of your country. ==
===Rights===
===Responsibilities===
==6. Have an interview with a local, regional, or national official of your country, and learn about his duties. ==
It is generally easier to get a local official to agree to an interview, though it is often more exciting to interview a more prominent person.  The interview can be accomplished during a club meeting, and multiple Pathfinders can ask questions.  Invite your guest well ahead of time, and make sure everyone in the club is on time.  A visit by an official would be a very good reason to have everyone in the club wear their class A uniforms.  If desired, you can make up several questions ahead of time, writing them on index cards, and distributing them to the members of your club.  But do not be so rigid as to not allow them to ask spontaneous questions.  Having questions prepared ahead of time on index cards are a good way to get things rolling.  Here are some suggested questions:
* Could you describe a typical day at work?
* What is the most difficult part of your job?
* What is the most satisfying aspect of your job?
* To whom do you report?
* How did you get your position?  Were you elected, appointed, or hired?
* How should a young person prepare for a life of public service?

==7. Write a one-page essay or give a two-minute oral report about a famous person in your country. Mention what he has done to gain his recognition. ==
This would be an excellent opportunity to present a worship during the opening exercises of a regular club meeting.  Encourage your Pathfinder to choose a person they are personally interested in.  If they cannot think of anyone themselves, have a list of suggested persons at hand and encourage them to choose from the list.  Famous people might be historical figures, politicians, actors, sports stars, or anyone else.  It would be preferable to choose a person who has been a positive influence on the country.

Although the requirement asks that you &quot;mention what ''he'' has done to gain ''his'' recognition,&quot; this should not be interpreted as excluding women.  Men are not the ''only'' famous people in a country.

==8. Do one of the following ==
===a. Make a list of ten famous quotations from leaders of your country.===
===b. Make a list of ten famous historic places in your country. ===
===c. Make a list of ten famous historic events in your country.===
==9. Describe what you can do as a citizen to help your church and country. ==
The best way to help either your church or your country is by ''getting involved''.  Edmund Burke, an English philosopher summed this up when he said ''&quot;The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.&quot;''

In your church, this means that you will show up for services on a regular basis.  It also means you will support it with your tithes and offering, show up for business meetings, and not wait to be asked before you volunteer your services.  If you see something that needs done, ''do it.''  If you do not have the skill to do it, or you think that you need permission first, talk to your pastor, an elder, deacon, or deaconess.  Find your ministry!

For your country, it is much the same.  Show up for public meetings, stay informed about the issues of the day, vote if you are eligible, and pay your taxes fairly and promptly.

==10. Go through the steps of an individual acquiring citizenship in the country and learn how this is done. ==
==11. Know how to explain the process of government in your country. ==
==12. Explain the meaning of this statement Jesus made in Matthew 22:21: &quot;Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's. ==
This verse teaches that governmental authority is to be respected, as long as it does not conflict with the moral obligations of being a Christian.  Government serves a holy purpose; preserving social order, promoting the well-being of its citizens, and protecting their safety.  If you believe that this does not apply today because you see the government as corrupt, you are urged to research the Roman government of the first century A.D. when these words were spoken by Jesus.  Was Herod corrupt?  Was Pilate just?

==13. Explain why laws are established in your country. ==

Black signals his intention to reach a KID setup. White can choose to seize central space and transpose into a standard KID by playing 3.d4 or to stay in the English opening by playing 3.g3. This refusal to seize central space by white does give white some flexibility and tactical subtleties in return. As the usual idea in the KID is to undermine the white center the apparently dimmer 3.g3 signals that white will develop first and get some strong control over the center before actually advancing his central pawns, which will make it much harder for black to destroy them through a conventional KID strategy.

===2...e6===

A flexible second move by black reaching a Nimzo-Indian or Queen`s Indian defence setup is a possibility for black with good prospects as pinning the white knight at c3 weakens white´s grip over the d5 square and threatens doubled pawns, not to mention that since white has not yet moved his d-pawn black might as well get a lead in development.

Black should be careful about this move however as white has the option of playing 3.e4 a move that leads to the ultra sharp Mikenas Carls variation where black will require very accurate play in order to stay alive.

And last but not least 3.Nf3 will lead to the more tactical lines of the symmetrical English after 3...c5 and a fight over the d4 and d5 squares will develop

= English Opening =
===2...Nf6===

This position, also reachable through the move orders 1...e5/2.Nc3 Nf6, can lead to two important variations of the English opening depending on how white chooses to develop. 3.Nf3 is the natural developing move and more often than not it leads to the English four knights variation simply because black must defend his pawn and the most practical way to do it is with 3...Nc6. After this white will usually develop his bishop to g2 and castle kingside. Black has a variety of options against this variation including the pinning of the knight on c3 with the dual idea of advancing the pawn on e5 and inflicting doubled pawns.

The other option for white is to get the bishop to g2 first and then choosing how to develop the knight, this idea is known as the Bremen system. The Bremen System has the advantage of maintaining flexibility in the development of the knight while also increasing control of the d5 square and putting extra pressure on black´s q-side. Black on the other hand might choose to counter this pressure by advancing his pawn to c6, the Keres variation, with the idea of creating a sturdy pawn formation which white must either undermine with his own pawns or fall to.

I am going to move this page to [[Guide to Unix/BSD/Historical]]. I believe that the last released version of Quasijarus was in 2004. No one has edited this page since February 2006. Almost nobody uses VAX systems anymore they have not even been in production since 2005. --[[User:CFeyecare|&lt;font face=&quot;Kristen ITC&quot; size=&quot;3.5&quot; color=&quot;crimson&quot;&gt;''''' CFeyecare '''''&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;font color = &quot;black&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;'''''[[User talk:CFeyecare| Talk!]]'''''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/font&gt;[[User:CFeyecare/templates/signature-tracker| ]] 00:17, 16 November 2008 (UTC)</text>

Hoping to end the war in the Pacific and to save American lives by not invading Japan, the United States decided to use the &quot;Atomic Bomb&quot;. On August 6 and 9, 1945 the US president, Harry Truman, ordered that the air force dropped atomic bombs on the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Though these killed over 200,000 people, they probably saved the lives of more American and Japanese soldiers as more were likely to have been killed if the allies had invaded Japan. Six days after the bombs were dropped, the Japanese surrendered, ending the war.

      <comment>/* Colony Hybridization Experiment */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Overview==
A genomic library is a collection of all the genes of an organism. After creation of a genomic library, a particular gene usually needs to screened from the genomic library just created. A method to do this is to carry out a colony hybridization experiment. 

==Colony Hybridization Experiment==
This technique is used to screen for a plasmid based genomic library. Bacteriophage plaques are screened. First, bacteria is transformed with a plasmid by using a bacteriophage to infect the colony. These are plated on a petri dish and incubated so that phage plaques are allowed to form. A plague with an identical phage will develop on the petri dish wherever the phage is located and infected by the bacterium. Next, replication of the original plate is made by placing a nitrocellulose sheet on top of the original plate. This allows the plaques to be transferred in a certain array. Both infected bacteria and phage DNA will be release from the lysed cells to attach to the nitrocellulose sheet to form spots. This is then treated with 2M NaOH to lyse the phages and separate the strands of DNA. When the DNA is denatured by the 2M NaOH treatment, the DNA strand is more accessible to be hybridize with the 32P probe. One must next neutralize the dish and then allowed to dry to immobilize the DNA. This is then mixed with a 32P probe and allowed to anneal to target any DNA sequence present on the nitrocellulose sheet. This is then subject to autoradiography by placing it on an x-ray film. The spots show where the probe has hybridized with the DNA and this is used to locate the genomic clone from the plaques on the original petri dish.

== Apologies ==

HYanWong,

I am just writing to apologise for the vandalism that your user talk page has just received. This kind of behaviour is not common here at wikibooks and to hopefully prevent the user doing such things again (s)he has been temporarily blocked. I hope this does not put you off editing here in the future.

Regards
[[User:Reece|&lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reece&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] [[User talk:Reece|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Talk)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] [[Special:Contributions/Reece|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Contributions)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] 22:32, 17 November 2008 (UTC)

==Your HoverImage Template==
Hi, I like your template for making mouse-over images.   I have updated the page [[Editing_Wikitext/Templates_Ready_to_Use#Image_Templates|Templates_Ready_to_Use]], and hope that I have got it right; just let me know if there is something wrong in my description.

With the two examples on the referenced page side by side, I notice that the images shift when the mouse is not on the image.  It seems to happen when the mouse reaches certain places on the page; at times changing the right image, changes the left in antiphase - weird, any ideas about it?  

By the way, can hover be used with tables? 

Regards, [[User:Armchair|Armchair]] ([[User talk:Armchair|talk]]) 22:26, 1 March 2009 (UTC)

== To HYanWong ==

Wondering if you are still active on Wikibooks. It is now July 2013.  Hope you return to at least read this. 

I came across your wikibook Statistical Analysis: an Introduction using R. As I progress, realize this is not a completed work. Just want to say, impressed with what you were doing, your approach, and (from my fishing around) even your inspiration, to assist partner in statistics who was planning to do medicine.  Hope the relationship continued well. 

It would seem also that part of your work was vandalised. Such people exist, both online and off line.    

For what it is worth to you, Intro and Chapter 1 were helpful to me as someone completely knew to R, and with a basic knowledge of statistics.  I hope to work through the rest of the book as it stands, even in its current form, as one of the sources of learning for myself.  

Clearly you have put a lot of time and thought and energy into this book.   Thanks, it has helped at least one person. 

Thanks for your efforts.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Overview==
Genomic libraries are a catalog of genes of a particular organism. They are also commonly referred to as gene banks. To create a genomic library, the complete genome of an organism is cleaved into fragments and inserted into a cloning vector.  It can also refer to the collection of vector molecules.

==How to Create a Genomic Library==
First, a variety of restriction endonucleases are used to cleave at certain base pairs to create the necessary fragments of the DNA. These restriction endonucleases are chosen in such a way that the cohesive ends are compatible with a cloning vector and that the complete genome is represented by these fragments. This also means that the cloning vector is cleaved with the same restriction endonucleases and the original fragments are combined with the cloning vector using a ligase. This mixture is then inserted into a bacterial cell to produce a library. Each cell will have a different DNA molecule. Ordering of individual clones is archived by identifying overlapping sequences. This set of overlapping sequences of the catalog is defined as a contig.
[[Image:Genomic Library.png|center|Creating a Genomic Library]]

==Roles of Genomic Library==
With complete information in the library for a specific organism, researchers can perform a variety of experiments on the DNA. By doing so, they can determine the actions and interaction of separated genes along the strand. Also, they can compare the genomic library of healthy and unhealthy individuals of the same species to see where differences in genetic coding may be led to unexpected mutations.

In physical reality, a genomic library for humans is a collection of bacteria, the most common one is E. coli. The usable sequence of DNA from the human genome gets transferred and carried through the E. coli. The DNA is prepared by digesting it with a restriction enzyme. Then the target segments are inserted into the bacteria by using lamba phage.This creates a basic unamplified library, where the bacteria have been allowed to multiply and create additional copies of each section of the DNA.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Heredity and Related Experiments==
==Gregor Mendel’s Experiment==

Gregor Mendel was a geneticist who discovered the basic principles of heredity through breeding garden peas. He chose to work with peas because of two reason. First, they were readily available in many varieties during his time, and second, he is able to control  which plants mated with which. Mendel controlled their reproductive cycle by altering the biological structure of the pea plant. The reproductive system of pea plants consist of carpels and stamens. Stamens consist of pollen, which is used to fertilize the eggs found in the carpel. Since the stamen is placed right next to the carpel, a mature flower is able to self-fertilize. In his experiment, he has two varieties of flowers: purple flowers and white flowers. Mendel wanted to achieve cross-pollination in order to see if the blending model of inheritance were correct. If it were correct, then Mendel would expect to see two two varieties produce a flower that had a pale purple color, which is a mix between purple and white. To achieve cross-pollination, Mendel removed all of the immature stamens of a purple plant before they produced pollen. Then, Mendel dusted pollen from a white plant onto the altered purple flower. 

The purple and white flower, which are known as the P generation (parental generation), hybridized purple flowers, which is known as the F1 generation (first initial generation). This result shows that the blending model is incorrect. Mendel allowed the F1 plants to self-pollinate to see if the white trait had somehow been removed by the purple trait. However, he discovered that the F2 generation, the offspring of the F1 generation, produced both purple and white flowers. Mendel kept records of how many of each flower there were, and he found out that the purple flowers outnumbered the white flowers by a 3 to 1 ratio. Mendel theorized that the white trait never disappeared; it was just dominated by the purple trait. He then concluded that being purple was a dominant trait while being white was a recessive trait.

His experiments lead Mendel to formulate what is now known as the Law of Independent Assortment, which states that different traits are spread to the 
offspring separately. Today however, we know that this only applies to certain traits while other linked traits do not assort independently. Another important formulation from Mendel's experiments is known as the Law of Segregation, which states that alleles separate during gamete formation and join again when the offspring is created. What is amazing about Mendel's experiments and conclusions is that he had no knowledge of DNA or how the genes are actually passed on, yet he was still able to form the basis of the study of genetics with his laws.

==Mendelian Inheritance Model==
===Important Vocabulary===

'''Character''': a specific heritable feature, e.g. hair color

'''Trait''': a variation of a character, i.e. brown hair, or black hair, etc.

'''Gene''': called “heritable factors” by Mendel, a gene is a piece of hereditary genetic 
information that corresponds to a specific character, and is represented in DNA by a specific nucleotide sequence.

'''Phenotype''': an organism’s traits, as determined by its genes

'''Genotype''': an organism’s genetic makeup that determines its phenotype

'''Alleles''': alternate versions of a single gene, e.g. the different colors of Mendel’s pea-flowers

'''“Wild Type”''': the naturally occurring phenotype in a population (i.e. red eyes and functional wings in Drosophila)

Gregor Mendel’s theory for inheritance was comprised of four principal concepts. He developed his theory by growing pea plants in an abbey garden and performing controlled crosses between these pea plants. His observations during his experiments led to the following points:

1. Differences in inherited characters are caused by different alleles for the gene that represents that character.

2. All organisms get two alleles for each inherited character, one coming from each parent organism.

3. Varying alleles are either dominant (deciding an organism’s phenotype) or recessive (not visible in an organism’s phenotype, but present in its genotype)

4. In meiosis, two alleles are segregated, or separated and are located in different gametes. (The Law of Segregation)

==Thomas Morgan’s Early Experiments==

Thomas Morgan was an embryologist at Columbia University who studied fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) due to their simple maintenance and short reproductive cycle. Additionally, fruit fly chromosomes are easily spotted with a light microscope, making the technological demand on experiments relatively low for modern standards. Also, a fruit fly only has four chromosomes in each sex cell, one of which is a sex chromosome. The female fruit fly has two “X” chromosomes, while the male fruit fly has one “X” and one “Y” chromosome. This fact played an important part in Morgan’s early experiments. 

One early problem with Morgan’s choice of experimental subject was the fact that variation in fruit fly population is relatively limited; the wild type fruit fly has red eyes and functional wings. Morgan was forced to breed fruit flies for generation after generation (one fruit fly generation equals two weeks) for years before observing a variation in phenotype; this new trait was white eyes. The white-eyed fruit fly was a male. This is where Morgan’s experimentation truly began.

Morgan took a wild type female and crossed (mated) it with the white-eyed (mutant) male. This was considered the parental generation (P). The resulting offspring made up the first filial generation (F1). All of the flies in this generation were red-eyed, and there was an even distribution of male flies to female flies. From this cross, Morgan hypothesized that the white-eyed trait was recessive to the wild type. Morgan, and his students developed a notation for labeling dominant and recessive traits. The wild type allele was annotated with a (+) superscript (i.e. X+), where X is the first letter of the trait being studied (e.g. “w” for white-eyes in this first experiment). Recessive alleles were labeled only by the letter, without the (+) superscript. 

Following the first cross, Morgan decided to mate a F1 male with a F1 female. The resultant offspring were 75% red-eyed, and 25% white-eyed, as predicted in Mendel’s archetypal 3:1 offspring phenotype ratio. However, the 25% white-eyed offspring were all males. Fifty percent of the offspring were females with red eyes, 25% were males with red eyes, and 25% were males displaying the recessive phenotype. This led Morgan to conclude that the trait for white eyes is a sex-linked trait (traits that are linked to an organisms gender), and that the allele for eye-color was absent on the Y chromosome, and carried exclusively on the X chromosomes. In this situation, females cannot display the recessive phenotype, but can carry the allele for it. Males that receive the X chromosome containing the recessive allele do not have a second X chromosome carrying the dominant allele to mask the recessive phenotype. This is analogous to color blindness in humans, where women can carry the recessive allele for color-blindness, but only males display the recessive phenotype. If the trait for white eyes was not sex linked, the F2 generation would have been comprised of 75% red-eyed flies (half of which are male, half of which are female) and 25% white-eyed flies (half of which are male, half of which are female). See Figures Below:

==Conclusion==

Morgan’s experiment led him to conclude that trait for white-eyes is sex linked. Additionally, Morgan’s experiment verified Mendel’s hypothesis that genes are carried a specific loci on specific chromosomes. Additionally, Morgan observed that sex-linked traits are found in predictable patterns in subsequent generations.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
We will show later that the propagation of acoustic waves (small amplitude fluctuations) in fluids is basically governed by the celebrated Wave equation. Therefore, in this chapter we will review some mathematical aspects of the wave equation which will help us to understand the physics in later chapters. '''It must be noted that we consider the wave propagation is happening in a three dimensional space, unless otherwise stated.'''
== Wave Equation ==
Wave equation is the simplest, linear, hyperbolic partial differential equation [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equation] which governs the linear propagation of waves, with finite speed, in media. Consider ''p(x,t)'' to be physical quantity (like pressure disturbance) which is propagating in space as a linear wave. Formally, the wave equation can be written as 

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial t^2}-c_0^2\nabla^2 p = 0\, ,&lt;/math&gt; 

where &lt;math&gt;c_0&lt;/math&gt; is the speed of wave propagation. This is the homogeneous wave equation which governs the propagation of a wave in a quiescent medium. If there is a source or a distribution of sources in the field which produce the wave, the wave equation will take the nonhomogeneous form 

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial t^2}-c_0^2\nabla^2 p = f(x,t)\, ,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''f(x,t)'' represents the existence of the sources. To solve a nonhomogenous PDE like the one above, we need to utilize a mathematical tool called the '''Green's function'''.
== Green's Function ==
Green's function[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green%27s_function] is named after the British mathematician George Green[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Green], who first developed the concept in the 1830s. The concept of Green's function is one of the most powerful mathematical tools to solve boundary value problems.

Suppose, we have a linear differential equation given by:

&lt;math&gt;L\, u = f,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''L'' is the differential operator. The main idea is to find a function ''G'', called Green's function, such that the solution of the above differential equation can be determined from 


&lt;math&gt;u(x) = \int G(x,s) f(s) ds &lt;/math&gt;

To find the appropriate green function for a given differential equation, one should solve 


&lt;math&gt;L \,G(x,s) = \delta(x-s) &lt;/math&gt;

with the same boundary condition as the original problem. For example, the free-space Green's function of the wave equation, is the solution of the wave equation with an impulsive point source &lt;math&gt;\delta(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y})\delta(t-\tau)&lt;/math&gt; (which is located at point &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}&lt;/math&gt; and generates an impulse at time &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;). Therefore,

&lt;math&gt;\Box^2 G(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y},t,\tau) = \delta(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y})\delta(t-\tau) &lt;/math&gt; 

where

&lt;math&gt;\Box^2 =\frac{\partial^2 }{\partial\, t^2}-c_0^2\frac{\partial^2
}{\partial\, x^2} &lt;/math&gt;.

The solution of the above equation is

&lt;math&gt;G(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y},t,\tau)=\frac{1}{4\pi\,r}\delta\left(t-\tau-\frac{r}{c_0}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where

&lt;math&gt;r=|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}|&lt;/math&gt;

The above relation represents an impulsive, spherically symmetric wave which is expanding from source &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}&lt;/math&gt;. It is also important to mention that the argument of the delta function,

&lt;math&gt;\tau+\frac{r}{c_0}&lt;/math&gt;

is called the retorted time and is equal to the time required for a wave, generated by source &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}&lt;/math&gt; at time &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\tau}&lt;/math&gt;, to arrive at point &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; at time &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{t}&lt;/math&gt;. 

Therefore, if we have a general problem (let's say noise generated by a turbulent jet),  which is governed by

&lt;math&gt;\Box^2 p = Q(x,t) &lt;/math&gt;

the instantaneous solution at any point in space is given by


&lt;math&gt;p(x,t) = \frac{1}{4\pi}\int\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} Q(\mathbf{y},\tau) G(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}, t, \tau) d^3\,\mathbf{y}d\tau &lt;/math&gt;

In the case of radiation in free-space,

&lt;math&gt;p(x,t) = \frac{1}{4\pi}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}  \int \frac{Q(\mathbf{y},\tau)}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}|}\delta\left(t-\tau-\frac{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}|}{c_0}\right)  d^3\,\mathbf{y}d\tau =\frac{1}{4\pi}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{Q(\mathbf{y},t-|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}|/c_0)}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}|} d^3\,\mathbf{y}&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Aeroacoustics is a branch of science which deals with aerodynamically generated noise. This is a relatively new branch of science which is known to be born by a celebrated paper of Sir James Lighhill[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Lighthill] in 1952. This paper, titled &quot;On Sound Generated Aerodynamically. I. General Theory&quot;  was later proceeded by another Lighthill's original and ingenious paper , &quot;On Sound Generated Aerodynamically. II. Turbulence as a Source of Sound&quot; in 1954. These papers have been perhaps the most cited and well known papers among the aeroacoustic community.

When did thermodynamics begin?  Possibly with Fahrenheit (1724) and his puzzling discovery that liquids boil at constant temperatures.  Or maybe with Benjamin Thompson's cannon-boring experiments (1798) and his presentation to the Royal Society in London proclaiming that heat is not a substance but produced by motion of particles.  But what has become known as the Three Laws of Thermodynamics probably started with the Carnot Principle.

Sadi Carnot, French engineer interested in designing an efficient steam engine, is considered the founder of thermodynamics.  In 1824 he published Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire.  In the book, less than a 120 pages, he founded the Carnot Principle or what we call today the Second Law of Thermodynamics.  Carnot showed that the work produced by a steam engine is proportional to the heat transferred from the boiler to the condenser, and work could only be gained from heat by a transfer from a warmer to a colder body.  The principle was never applied during Carnot's lifetime; he died of cholera at the age of 36.  The absolute temperature scale proposed by Lord Kelvin (1848) was based on Carnot's theory of heat.  Lazare Carnot, the father of Sadi, was a noted mathematician as well as Napoleon's Minister of War.

Émile Clapeyron, another French engineer, restated Carnot's principle in mathematical form (1834).  He also devised the Clapeyron equation, a formula for the heat of vaporization of a liquid based on temperature and volume change. Gustave Eiffel listed prominent French scientists, including Clapeyron, on plaques around the first stage of Eiffel Tower.

==First Law==
'''In a nutshell:''' ''Total energy of universe constant''

===James Prescott (1818-1889)  Joule Hermann von Helmholtz (1821-1894)===
                 
Joule is considered the founder of experimental thermodynamics although his lack of advanced mathematical training compelled him to leave the development of thermodynamic derivations to others like Helmholtz, Kelvin, Clausius, and Gibbs.  Joule's skillful and accurate experimental work made significant contributions and he shares in discovering the law of the conservation of energy with Helmholtz.   Joule established that the various types of energy--mechanical, electrical, and heat--are basically the same and can be changed from one form into another.  He also formulated what has become known as Joule's Law: the heat produced in a wire by an electric current is proportional to the product of the resistance of the wire and the square of the current.  On his honeymoon, Joule just had to compare temperatures of water at top and bottom of waterfall (he predicted the temperature would be greater at the bottom). The unit of work or energy, the joule, is named in his honor.

Helmholtz presented a mathematical proof for his law of conservation of force (1847).  Helmholtz's use of the word &quot;force&quot; corresponds to what later became known as energy.  This application led to his classic 1847 paper, &quot;On the Conservation of Energy,&quot;  in which he outlined the philosophical and physical basis of the law of the conservation of energy.  It was von Helmholtz  who first informed us in 1856 that &quot;the universe is dying!&quot;

==Entropy and Second Law==

'''In a nutshell:''' ''Total entropy of universe always increasing''

===Rudolf Clausius (1822-1888)===
Clausius restated Carnot's principle as: Work produced by heat is not only proportional to the heat transferred from the warmer to the colder body, but is also proportional to the temperature difference of the two bodies.  Clausius formulated the second law and coined the term &quot;entropy&quot; after the Greek word meaning transformation.  According to Clausius, entropy was the amount of thermal energy not available to do work (opposite of energy).  In a closed system, available energy can  never increase, so its opposite, entropy, can never decrease.   In an 1865 paper Clausius restated the first law as the energy of the universe is constant and the second law as the entropy of the universe tends to a maximum.

The physical meaning of entropy (disorder) was interpreted in the 1890's by Ludwig Boltzmann.

Boltzmann used molecules of gas as a model, along with the laws of probability, to show that heat, no matter how it was introduced, would soon become evenly diffused throughout the gas.  He formulated the equation S = k logW, where S is entropy, k is now called the Boltzmann constant, and W represents the number of ways particles can be arranged in a given state while keeping the total energy constant.  If there are only a few ways to arrange atoms or molecules, the entropy is low; the entropy is high when there are many possible arrangements.  Boltzmann's proposal was met with skepticism and not accepted in his lifetime.  Suffering from poor health and despondent over the rejection of his work, Boltzmann committed suicide.  The famous equation is engraved at the top of his tombstone .

==Free Energy==

===Josiah Willard Gibbs (1839-1903)===
Gibbs, one of the founders of modern thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, wrote the first authoritative book on the subject in 1902 (Elementary Principles in Statistical Mechanics).  Gibbs developed the concept of free energy (G), where DG is the compromise between enthalpy changes (DH) and entropy changes (DS): DG = DH - TDS

Although General Chemistry texts always detail the work of Gibbs, the texts rarely tell about the scientist.  So who was Gibbs? At the time of his death, Europeans considered Gibbs the greatest born American scientist. Entering Yale at age 15 and receiving a Ph.D. in engineering (1863), Gibbs returned to Yale in 1869 as professor of mathematical physics.  Gibbs held the position without salary (living on the inheritance left by his father) until 1880--Yale initiated a salary only when Johns Hopkins University invited Gibbs to join the faculty.

Gibbs published only reluctantly on the subjects of thermodynamics, electromagnetic theory, and statistical mechanics.  In all, he published 25 papers and the book on statistical mechanics. Gibbs never made an effort to popularize his results and would not get involved in disputes.  When Boltzmann's views were under attack--Gibbs had been working on the same problem and came to the same conclusions as Boltzmann--Gibbs never wrote Boltzmann to offer encouragement.

==Third Law==

'''In a nutshell:''' ''Perfect crystal has zero entropy at absolute zero''

===Walther Nernst (1864-1941)===
Nernst applied the principles of thermodynamics to the electrochemistry and formulated what has become known as the Nernst equation (relates voltage of a cell to its properties).  He showed that charged ions dissociate because they have difficulty attracting each other through insulating water. Nernst was awarded the 1920 Nobel Prize in chemistry for his discovery of the third law: Entropy approaches a minimum as temperature approaches absolute zero.  During his visit to Yale in 1906, Nernst donated a bronze memorial to honor Gibbs.

==1.1 ==

Find the union &lt;math&gt;A_1\cup A_2&lt;/math&gt; and the intersection &lt;math&gt;A_1\cap A_2&lt;/math&gt; of the two sets &lt;math&gt;A_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A_2&lt;/math&gt; where
 
(a) &lt;math&gt;A_1=\{0,1,2\},A_2=\{2,3,4\} \,&lt;/math&gt;

(b) &lt;math&gt;A_1=\{x:0&lt;x&lt;2\},A_2=\{x:1\le x &lt;3\}&lt;/math&gt;

(c) &lt;math&gt;A_1=\{(x,y):0&lt;x&lt;2,0&lt;y&lt;2\},A_2=\{(x,y):1&lt;x&lt;3,1&lt;y&lt;3\} \,&lt;/math&gt;

Solution (c): 

&lt;math&gt;A_1\cup A_2=\{(x,y):0&lt;x&lt;3, 0&lt;y&lt;2 \or 1&lt;x&lt;3,2&lt;y&lt;3\}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;math&gt;A_1\cap A_2=\{(x,y):1&lt;x&lt;2, 0&lt;y&lt;2\}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Rest are similar.


==1.3==

List all the possible arrangements of the four letters m,a,r and y. Let &lt;math&gt;A_1&lt;/math&gt; be the collection of the arrangements in which y is in the last position. Let &lt;math&gt;A_2&lt;/math&gt; be the collection of the arrangements in which m is in the first position. Find the union and intersection of &lt;math&gt;A_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A_2&lt;/math&gt;.

Solution: The arrangements are: mary, mayr, mray, mrya, myra, myar, amry, amyr, aymr, ayrm, arym, army, ryma, ryam, ramy, raym, rmya, rmay, yrma, yram, yamr, yarm, ymra, ymar. 

&lt;math&gt;A_1=\{mary,mray,amry,army,ramy,rmay\}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;A_2=\{mary, mayr, mray, mrya, myra, myar\}&lt;/math&gt;. The rest is obvious.


==1.5==

If a sequence of sets &lt;math&gt;A_1,A_2,A_3\cdots &lt;/math&gt; is such that &lt;math&gt;A_k\subset A_{k+1}, k=1,2,3,\cdots &lt;/math&gt; the sequence is said to be a nondecreasing sequence. Give an example of this kind of sequence of sets.

Solution: Let &lt;math&gt;A_n=(0,n)&lt;/math&gt; where n = 1, 2, 3...


==1.6==

If a sequence of sets &lt;math&gt;A_1,A_2,A_3\cdots &lt;/math&gt; is such that &lt;math&gt;A_k\supset A_{k+1}, k=1,2,3,\cdots &lt;/math&gt; the sequence is said to be a nonincreasing sequence. Give an example of this kind of sequence of sets.

Solution: Let &lt;math&gt;A_n=(0,\frac{1}{n})&lt;/math&gt; where n=1,2,3...


==1.7==

If &lt;math&gt;A_1,A_2,A_3\cdots &lt;/math&gt; are sets such that &lt;math&gt;A_k\subset A_{k+1} k=1,2,3,\cdots, \lim_{k \to \infty}A_k &lt;/math&gt; is defined as the union &lt;math&gt;A_1\cup A_2\cup A_3\cup\cdots &lt;/math&gt;. Find &lt;math&gt;\lim_{k \to \infty}A_k&lt;/math&gt; if 

(a) &lt;math&gt;A_k=\{x:1/k\le x\le 3-1/k\}, k=1,2,3\cdots &lt;/math&gt;

(b) &lt;math&gt;A_k=\{(x,y):1/k\le x^2+y^2\le 4-1/k\}, k=1,2,3\cdots &lt;/math&gt;

Solution: (b) &lt;math&gt;\lim_{k \to \infty}A_k=\{(x,y):1&lt; x^2+y^2&lt;4\}&lt;/math&gt;


==1.8== 

If &lt;math&gt;A_1,A_2,A_3\cdots &lt;/math&gt; are sets such that &lt;math&gt;A_k\supset A_{k+1} k=1,2,3,\cdots, \lim_{k \to \infty}A_k &lt;/math&gt; is defined as the intersection &lt;math&gt;A_1\cap A_2\cap A_3\cup\cdots &lt;/math&gt;. Find &lt;math&gt;\lim_{k \to \infty}A_k&lt;/math&gt; if 

(a) &lt;math&gt;A_k=\{x:2-1/k&lt; x\le 2\}, k=1,2,3\cdots &lt;/math&gt;

(b) &lt;math&gt;A_k=\{x:2&lt;x\le 2+1/k\}, k=1,2,3\cdots &lt;/math&gt;

(c) &lt;math&gt;A_k=\{(x,y):0\le x^2+y^2\le 1/k\}, k=1,2,3\cdots &lt;/math&gt;

Solution: (c) &lt;math&gt;\lim_{k \to \infty}A_k=\{(0,0)\}&lt;/math&gt;


==1.9== 

For every one dimensional set A let &lt;math&gt;Q(A)=\sum_A f(x)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;f(x)=\begin{cases}\frac{2}{3}(\frac{1}{3})^x,  &amp; x=0,1,2,\cdots \\ 0, &amp; otherwise \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;A_1=\{x:x=0,1,2,3\} \,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A_2=\{x:x=0,1,2,\cdots\}&lt;/math&gt;, find &lt;math&gt;Q(A_1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q(A_2)&lt;/math&gt;.

Solution: &lt;math&gt;Q(A_1)=\frac{80}{81}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q(A_2)=1&lt;/math&gt; using the formulae of sum of a [[w:Geometric_series#Formula|geometric series]].


==1.10==

For every one dimensional set A for which the integral exists, let &lt;math&gt;Q(A)=\int_A f(x)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;f(x)=\begin{cases}6x(1-x),  &amp; 0&lt;x&lt;1 \\ 0, &amp; elsewhere \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;, otherwise let &lt;math&gt;Q(A)&lt;/math&gt; be undefined. If &lt;math&gt;A_1=\{x:\frac{1}{4}&lt;x&lt;\frac{3}{4}\}, A_2=\{\frac{1}{2}\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A_3=\{x:0&lt;x&lt;10\}&lt;/math&gt;, find &lt;math&gt;Q(A_1), Q(A_2)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q(A_3)&lt;/math&gt;.

Solution: &lt;math&gt;Q(A_1)&lt;/math&gt; can be found by integrating f(x) from &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{4}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\frac{3}{4}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;Q(A_2)=0 &lt;/math&gt; as [[w:Lebesgue_integration#Basic_theorems_of_the_Lebesgue_integral|integral over a set of measure zero is 0]] and &lt;math&gt;Q(A_3)&lt;/math&gt; can be found by integrating f(x) from 0 to 1.


==1.11==

Let &lt;math&gt;Q(A)=\int_A\int(x^2+y^2)dxdy&lt;/math&gt; for every two dimensional set A for which the integral exists; otherwise let &lt;math&gt;Q(A)&lt;/math&gt; be undefined. If &lt;math&gt;A_1=\{(x,y):-1\le x\le 1, -1\le y\le 1\}, A_2=\{(x,y):-1\le x=y\le 1\},&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A_3=\{(x,y):x^2+y^2\le 1\}&lt;/math&gt;, find &lt;math&gt;Q(A_1), Q(A_2)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q(A_3)&lt;/math&gt;.

Solution: &lt;math&gt;Q(A_1)= \int_{-1}^1\int_{-1}^1(x^2+y^2)dxdy=\frac{8}{3}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;Q(A_2)&lt;/math&gt; is zero since it [[w:Double_integral#Introduction|represents volume]] of a sheet and &lt;math&gt;Q(A_3)=\int_{0}^{2\pi}\int_{0}^1(r^2)rdrd\theta&lt;/math&gt; if we introduce [[w:Double_integral#Polar_coordinates|polar coordinates]]. This evaluates to &lt;math&gt;\frac{\pi}{2}&lt;/math&gt;.


==1.15==

To join a certain club, a person must be either a statistician or a mathematician or both. Of the 25 members in this club, 19 are statisticians and 16 are mathematicians. How many persons in the club are both a statistician and a mathematician?

Soluion: The number of persons which are statisticians or mathematicians = number of statisticians + number of mathematicians - number of persons which are both statisticians and mathematicians. This can be proved directly using properties of the [[w:Counting_measure|counting measure]]. The general proof is as follows: Let A and B be two finite sets. Endow the natural numbers with the counting measure which we shall denote by n. We shall denote union by + and intersection by . and the context will make it clear whether we mean actual addition, multiplication or union, intersection. Now A-B (Here - represents the [[w:Complement_(set_theory)#Relative_complement|relative complement]], AB and B-A are disjoint and as n is [[w:Sigma additivity|sigma additive]] so
#n(A+B)=n(A-B)+n(B-A)+n(AB)
#n(A)=n(A-B)+n(AB) which implies n(A-B)=n(A)-n(AB)
#n(B)=n(B-A)+n(AB) which implies n(B-A)=n(B)-n(AB)

Substituting n(A-B) and n(B-A) from (2) and (3) into (1) gives us n(A+B)=n(A)+n(B)-n(AB).  
So the answer is 10.


==1.16==

After a hard fought football game, it was reported that of the 11 starting players, 8 hurt a hip, 6 hurt an arm, 5 hurt a knee, 3 hurt both a hip and an arm, 2 hurt both a hip and a knee, 1 hurt both an arm and a knee, and no one hurt all three. Comment on the accuracy of the report.

Solution: We shall first establish that in the language of the previous problem:


&lt;math&gt;n(A+B+C)=n(A)+n(B)+n(C)-n(AB)-n(BC)-n(CA)+n(ABC) \,&lt;/math&gt;. 


Now, 


&lt;math&gt;n(A+B+C)=n(A+B)+n(C)-n((A+B)C)\,&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;=n(A)+n(B)+n(C)-n(AB)-n(AC+BC)\,&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;=n(A)+n(B)+n(C)-n(AB)-{n(AC)+n(BC)-n(ACBC)}\,&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;=n(A)+n(B)+n(C)-n(AB)-n(BC)-n(CA)+n(ABC)\,&lt;/math&gt;


Now if we let A, B and C to be the set of players with injured hips, knees and arms respectively, we would find the contradiction on substituting the appropriate terms in the above formula. Hence the report is not accurate.

I've also noted your post about losing track of your contributions if you have one of the default skins for the site enabled you can see on the (right) side of this page an option called &quot;My contributions&quot;, if it is not there it may signify that the contribution was deleted by some, we expect, valid reason. Taking your post naming a page on the English Wikibooks in Spanish doesn't seem a very humm good indicator...

I'm not specialist, but there are two Polish words:
- &quot;zaprzęgać&quot; - meaning 'to put (horses) to (a coach), to harness'
- &quot;sprężać&quot; - 'to compress air'

but these two words seems so different to me, so I find it surprising being discussed in the same article...</text>

==Usage==
'''{{tl|Vquote}}''' is a variant of the {{tl|Rquote}} and {{tl|Cquote}} [[:Category:Quotation templates|quotation templates]]. Where Cquote passages are set to use 100% of of a page's width, and Rquote to 33%, Vquote allows the individual editor to set the percentage of the page width the quotation will occupy, similar to {{tl|Quote_box}}. Rquote is intended for passages of 50 words or less, and Cquote for longer [[w:pull quote|pull quote]]s. Vquote is intended to provide a middle ground between the two.

With the freedom to size the quotation, the editor takes responsibility for the aesthetics of the contribution. For instance, rather than setting Vquote at 50% or above, a page would probably be more readable using Cquote.

For long quotations in the text, the [[Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style#Quotations|Manual of Style]] recommends using the HTML &amp;lt;[[w:blockquote|blockquote]]&gt; element or the {{tl|quote}} template (which produces the blockquote tag).

==Parameters==
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Vquote|alignment|width= |quote text|source|citation}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
; '''alignment''' : ''left'' or ''right''.
; '''width''' : The width of the box, either a relative percentage of the screen such as ''45%'', or the user can set an absolute width such as ''300px''. If undefined, the template will assume 100%.
; '''quote text''' : Text to be quoted, without quotation marks around it.
:: '''Note:''' If the quote text contains one or more &quot;=&quot; (equal signs), then the quote text must resemble &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Vquote|&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''&lt;span style=&quot;color:red;&quot;&gt;1=&lt;/span&gt;'''&lt;nowiki&gt;quote text}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; (see [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:Templates#Equals_sign_in_parameter_value &quot;Equals sign in parameter value&quot;])
; '''source''' : Individual or other party responsible for the quotation.
; '''citation''' : Information on where the quotation was published.

==Examples==

===45% aligned right &amp;rarr;===
====Code====
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Vquote|right|width=45%|

This is a list of projects that have been either unmaintained or completely abandoned.

==Quasijarus==
Quasijarus is a fork of 4.3BSD-Tahoe. In turn, 4.3BSD-Tahoe was one of the releases by the [[Wikipedia:Computer Systems Research Group|Computer Systems Research Group]] at Berkeley. This fork from a version of BSD earlier than 4.4 is possible because Caldera had freely licensed the original Unix code in BSD (originally requiring a license from AT&amp;T).

The &quot;International Free Computing Task Force&quot;, which develops Quasijarus, describes it at their [http://ifctfvax.harhan.org/Quasijarus/ home page]:
{{Vquote|left|width=90%|
''They carried this mission successfully until around the time of the 4.3BSD and 4.3BSD-Tahoe releases (the summer of 1988). However, starting with the 4.3BSD-Reno release (1990) and even more in the following Net/2 and 4.4BSD releases, UCB deviated from the True UNIX mission in a number of ways.''

''Quasijarus Project has picked classic Berkeley UNIX up from where CSRG effectively dropped it and distributes the once-again-maintained code as 4.3BSD-Quasijarus.''
}}

There is a guide to installing and running 4.3BSD-Quasijarus on [http://www.retrocomputinggeek.com/retrowiki/Install4.3BSDQuasijarus/ the retrocompupting wiki]

      <comment>added section on sustainability</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Definition ==

The International Energy Agency's ''Renewable Energy Working Party'' defines renewable energy as follows.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Renewable energy is derived from natural processes that are replenished constantly. In its various forms, it derives directly from the sun, or from heat generated deep within the earth. Included in the definition is electricity and heat generated from solar, wind, ocean, hydropower, biomass, geothermal resources, and biofuels and hydrogen derived from renewable resources.&quot;&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.iea.org/textbase/nppdf/free/2000/Renew_main2003.pdf Renewable energy... into the mainstream] p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To further detail this definition it is possible to divide renewable energy sources into two categories:

* Direct solar energy
* Indirect solar energy
* Non-solar renewables

The majority of renewable energy sources derive that energy from solar radiation. Direct solar energy refers to solar thermal energy conversion and solar photovoltaics. Indirect solar energy includes wind power, wave power and biofuels.

Non-solar renewables are those that do not depend on solar radiation. There are two sources of non-solar renewable energy - tidal and geothermal.

It is ''very'' important to highlight the difference between a primary energy source and an energy storage medium.

== Importance of renewable energy ==

As fossil fuel resources have depleted and environmental concern has increased, renewable energy has become a very important engineering sector. It is undoubtable that in the future a large proportion of energy used by the human race will be derived from a diverse range of renewable sources.

== Renewable energy and sustainability ==

Renewable energy can be regarded as one of the fundamental premises for building a sustainable global society.

A truely sustainable energy source should accordingly not only be renewable, but also apply the prinsiples of sustainability.

That is, to look at the energy production and use in light of endured maintainance of our biosphere, the biodiversity and the social stability of the human culture.

===Using System Preferences===
[[Image:Leopard System Preferences.png|400px|thumb|right|Fig. 1 - The main screen of System Preferences.]]
When you open System Preferences, you see the System Preferences main screen. This screen is full of icons, each representing a &quot;pane&quot;, or group of controls. System Preferences grouped into '''Personal''', '''Hardware''', '''Internet &amp; Network''', and '''System''' rows, and if you have applications that install preference panes, the '''Other''' row. As with all other aspects of Leopard, Spotlight is built into the top right corner of the System Preferences menu.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Telomeres''' (from the Greek ''telos'', &quot;an end&quot;) are long stretches of repeating non-coding DNA sequences at the ends of the DNA strand.  They protect the ends of DNA and prevent DNA strands from shortening or attaching to other molecules by masking the chromosome. Russian Alexei Olonikov was the first to postulate the problem of chromosomes replicating at the tip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | year = 1999 | title = Telomeres, telomerase, and aging: Origin of the theory  | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6T6J-3W0NVRX-1&amp;_user=4429&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_searchStrId=1101860464&amp;_rerunOrigin=google&amp;_acct=C000059602&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=4429&amp;md5=10161c08abe8a14577eabe1433ab0623 | publisher=[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=HomePageURL&amp;_method=userHomePage&amp;_lg=Y&amp;_acct=C000059602&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=4429&amp;md5=e942b49e1fa053a4a0f27c46de3385ba Alexey M.

==Telomerase==
[[Image:Telomerase.JPG|thumb|Telomerase adding Telomere extension]]
'''Telomerase''' is an enzyme that creates the Telomeres. Telomerase adds specific repeating sequences (&quot;TTAGGG&quot; in all vertebrates) to the ends of four DNA strands.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | year = 2007 | title = Repeat Expansion–Detection Analysis of Telomeric Uninterrupted (TTAGGG)n Arrays  | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B8JDD-4R29JC3-1D&amp;_user=4429&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_searchStrId=1101905510&amp;_rerunOrigin=google&amp;_acct=C000059602&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=4429&amp;md5=8d0cd5cdd15014b7cd0df0e52bf06d41 | publisher=[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=HomePageURL&amp;_method=userHomePage&amp;_lg=Y&amp;_acct=C000059602&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=4429&amp;md5=e942b49e1fa053a4a0f27c46de3385ba] | accessdate = 2009-11-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The telomerase enzyme has an RNA template that partially attaches to the shortened end of the DNA strand. New nucleic acids then attach to the template, extending the DNA strand. Once the telomerase leaves, the double stranded DNA is completed with the DNA polymerase. Telomerase was discovered in 1985 by [[Wikipedia:Carol W. Greider|Carol W. Greider]] and [[Wikipedia:Elizabeth Blackburn|Elizabeth Blackburn]]. For this discovery, they were awarded the 2009 [[Wikipedia:Nobel Prize|Nobel Prize]] in [[Wikipedia:Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Physiology or Medicine]] along with Jack W. Szostak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | year = 2009 | title = The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2009 | url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2009/index.html | publisher=[http://nobelprize.org/index.html] | accessdate = 2009-11-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Szostak and Blackburn first discovered telomeres in ciliates. They chose ciliates because at one stage of their life cycle, they make a million new telomeres. The model created includes a telomere-dedicated DNA polymerase, which adds telomeric repeats onto chromosome ends. Thereofre, telomeres are represented as a motif in DNA sequences.

Telomerase's presence in humans is somewhat strange.  It is located in the nucleus which is unsurprising because that is where DNA replication takes place.  However, Telomerase activity is not present in all cells.  It was found to be almost absent in the majority of normal adult tissues, including cardiac and skeletal muscle, lung, liver, and kidney.  Because of this curious lack of telomerase activity, a theory arose connecting telomere length to aging and cell senescence.  According to this theory, human somatic cells are born with a full number of telomeric repeats, but the telomerase enzyme is not present in some tissues.  The cells of those tissues would lose about 50 to 100 nucleotides from each chromosome end each time they underwent replication and division.  Eventually, the telomeres would cease to exist and the chromosomes themselves would start losing nucleotides, carrying genetic defects into their next division so that neither daughter cell would be viable.  Thus after a certain number of divisions a cell will not have enough nucleotides and die.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = What are telomeres and telomerase? | url = http://www4.utsouthwestern.edu/cellbio/shay-wright/intro/facts/sw_facts.html | publisher=[http://www.swmed.edu/] | accessdate = 2009-11-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Telomere.png|thumb|Telomeres at the end of a chromosome.]]
The function of Telomerase is to allow for short replacements of Telomeres which are gradually lost during cell division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Telomerase: regulation, function and transformation. | url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15843091 | publisher=[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed] | accessdate = 2009-11-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In normal conditions without Telomerase, a cell would divide until it would hit a critical point known as the Hayflick limit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Hayflick Limit Theory  | url = http://www.prolongyouth.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=66%3AHayflick+Limit+Theory&amp;Itemid=61 | publisher=[http://www.prolongyouth.com/index.php] | accessdate = 2009-11-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the presence of Telomerase, however, the cell has the ability to replace lost DNA and divide without limit. But this continuous growth comes with a consequence as this growth may lead eventually to cancerous cells.

While the details are not fully known, it would seem that that shortened Telomeres play a role in aging due to the erosion of the DNA over time. The questions arises whether or not Telomerase has the ability to greatly extend the lifespan of a human due to its importance in the maintenance of the Telomeres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Extension of Life-Span by Introduction of Telomerase into Normal Human Cells  | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/feature/data/telomerase/telomerase.dtl | publisher=[http://www.sciencemag.org/] | accessdate = 2009-11-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Wikipedia:Michael Fossel|Dr. Michael Fossel]], a professor of clinical medicine at Michigan State University, has expressed his views on Telomerase as a viable treatment for cell senescence. 

However, several experiments have raised doubts on the ability of Telomerase as an effective anti-aging treatment. An experiment was done with mice having higher levels of Telomerase and it was discovered that they also had a higher rate of cancer which therefore led to a shorter lifespan. In addition, Telomerase favors tumorogenesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | year = 2008 | title = Anti-Aging Medicine | url = http://www.senescence.info/antiaging.html | publisher=[http://www.senescence.info/ João Pedro de Magalhães] | accessdate = 2009-11-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Telomerase fosters cancer development by allowing uncontrolled cell growth which eventually proliferates into tumors. In fact, Telomerase activity has been observed in approximately 90% of all human tumors which suggests that the uncontrolled growth of a cell as conveyed by Telomerase has a key role in cancer.

In addition to using Telomerase as an anti-aging treatment, Telomerase has potential as a drug target against cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Foreman, Judy | title=Telomerase - a Promising Cancer Drug Stuck in Patent Hell? | publisher=myhealthsense.com  | url=http://www.myhealthsense.com/F030325_Telomerase.html | accessdate = 2009-11-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since it is necessary for the immortality of many cancer cell types, it is believed that if a drug is able to deactivate Telomerase activity in a cell, Telomeres would shorten, mutations would happen, cell stability would decrease and cancer would be, in essence, effectively treated. Experimental drugs have been tested in mouse models and some drugs have moved onto clinical testing.

==Cancer Biology==
The significance of studying telomeres can be found in telomerase, which rebuilds the telomere so that the cells can keep dividing. The telomerase, however, eventually shortens the telomere, causing the cell to die. In the case of cancer cells, this enzyme builds telomeres long past the cell's average lifetime. These cells then are called to be &quot;immortaled&quot;, since they can divide endlessly. This results in a tumor. Many researchers believe that telomere maintenance activity is characterized in most human cancer cells. Though the mechanism by which such phenomena happen has not been well understood, the discovery may reveal key elements of telomere function.
Telomerase, on the other hand, is the natural enzyme used for telomerase repair, highly abundant in stem cells, germ cells, hair follicles, and most cancers cells, but its expression is low or in some cases absent in somatic cells. Telomerase functions by adding bases to the ends of the telomeres. Cells with sufficient telomerase activity are considered immortal in the sense that they can divide past the Hayflick limit without entering senescence or apoptosis. For this reason, telomerase is viewed as a potential target for anti-cancer drugs such as telomestatin.

==2009 Nobel Prize==
The Nobel Prize 2009 in Physiology and Medicine was awarded to three scientists who have discovered how the chromosomes can be copied in a complete way during cell divisions and how they are protected against degradation. By showing that the ends of the chromosomes, telomeres, and their enzyme, telomerase, are significant in protecting the chromosomes from degradation, they identified telomerase and explained how the telomeres protect the ends of the chromosomes and built by telomerase. 
On the other hand, if the telomeres become shortened, cells can duplicate damaged as cancer cells.  If telomerase is well maintained, conversely, telomere length is maintained and the cell does not become cancerous.  In the case of cancer cells, telomerase allows the cell to divide without any limit. Certain genetic disease are caused by a defective telomerase. This discovery can thus be used to stimulate the development of new therapeutic strategies. Understanding such fundamental mechanism is an important first step toward opening new doors for cures for cancer and other related diseases, as well as anti-aging.

==Hayflick Limit==

The Hayflick limit is the number of times a normal cell may divide until it reaches a critical limit and stops dividing based on the idea that Telomeres reach a critical length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | year = 2008 | title = Cellular Senescence | url = http://www.senescence.info/cells.html | publisher=[http://www.senescence.info/ João Pedro de Magalhães] | accessdate = 2009-11-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This limit was discovered by [[Wikipedia:Leonard Hayflick|Leonard Hayflick]] in the 1960s who demonstrated that the cells in a normal fetus divided around 40 to 60 times before entering into cell senescence. Due to repeated mitosis, the Telomere shortening occurred which inhibited cell division which is analogous to aging. The discovery of this limit, a pillar of Biology, refuted the early contention by [[Wikipedia: Alexis Carrel|Alexis Carrel]] who, along with the majority of scientists during that time period, believed cells were &quot;immortal&quot;.

==Role of Telomere==

Telomeres account for the lost bits of DNA at the ends of chromosomes during DNA replication. Since DNA polymerase moves along the template strand in the 5'--&gt; 3' direction, some of the 5' end of the template strand will not be replicated. This results in the incomplete ends as shown in the diagram below. However, telomeres are usually very long, ranging from 400 to 600 base pairs in yeast to many kilobases in humans. They are made of six to eight base pair long repeats which are usually rich with guanine bases. With long stretches of telomeres at the ends of DNA strands, the incomplete strands of DNA will still contain the genetic code.

The shortening of telomeres in humans induces cell senescence in humans. This mechanism appears to cause the formation of cancerous cells. Telomere length has been theorized in recent publications to account for the aging in humans. Since cells replicate identically, there must be a reason why cells within a body lose function and viability with time. Telomeres may have some influence over the aging process since every consequent DNA replication results in the shortening of telomeres. Two aspects to this question are: (i) whether telomere length, as measured in specific cell populations in the body, correlates with longevity or disease; and (ii) whether telomere shortening in any cell population causes functional impairment of that cell population. However, some may argue telomeres do not correlate to longevity as mice contain long strands of telomeres, but contrarily live much shorter lives than humans who do not have as long telomeres as do mice.  And some may argue that telomere length does correlate to longevity as it determines the number of times that a cell can divide before it dies or reaches senescence.

==Recent Publications==

Recently it has been found that telomerase activity is inversely related to length of the telomeres. In other words, telomere elongation happens more often on short telomeres rather than long ones. The research showed a deficiency in telomerase activity in telomeres greater than 125 base pairs,and there was 2 to 3 times more telomerase activity in telomeres shorter than 125 base pairs. This preferential elongation has been demonstrated in yeast and mice, and now human somatic cells. Kinetic data indicates that elongation in yeast cells in a single event in which elongates the telomeres to a certain length, whereas in human cells the elongation seems to be a gradual process. The researchers showed that telomerase adds a regulated length of telomere in each cell division. The researchers showed that human cells expressed telomerase, however long telomeres were maintained and not elongated where as the cells with shorter telomeres elongated, which goes to show that telomeres can not be infinitely extended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Britt-Compton |first1=Bethan |last2=Capper |first2=Rebecca | last3=Rowson | first3=Jan | last4=Baird | first4=Duncan M. |year=2009 |journal=FEBS Letters |issue=583 |pages=3076–3080 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another interesting paper was focused on the role of DNA damage response (DDR) proteins in the role of telomere maintenance. The review says that early stage DNA repair proteins have a significant role in telomere maintenance where as late stage proteins usually do not take part in telomere repair. The interplay with these proteins and the proteins that cap the telomeres to protect the telomeres is very important too. Many of stronger DDR proteins inhibit cell replication, because of this fact, it would be harmful to the organism for these proteins to be a part of telomere repair. These protein caps on the telomeres inhibit full DNA damage response which keeps the stronger protein from &quot;repairing&quot; the telomere ends. It still isn't clear why some of the DDR proteins participate in telomere maintenance and others do not, but it is clear that the cellular process in repairing a DNA break and repairing telomeres are two different process, with the former halting cellular division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lyndall |first1=David  |year=2009 |journal=The EMBO Journal |issue=28 |pages=2174–2187 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What is the Human Genome Project ==

The human genome project was a 13 year long project run by the US Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health.  The task of sequencing the estimated 3 billion DNA base pairs was intimidating and it took an international effort to complete, the UK’s Wellcome Trust was a partner in the effort and many other countries such as Japan, Germany, France, China and Japan also made great contributions.  The goals of the project included: sequencing the 3 billion human DNA base pairs, identifying the estimated 20,000-25,000 genes found in human DNA, to store all this information in an accessible databases and improve the tools for data analysis.

The DNA of a set of model organisms was also sequenced and studied to provide comparative information so that scientists could understand how the human genome functioned. The primary reason for this project was to use the sequenced genome to understand and eventually treat the ~4000 genetic diseases that afflict humans, as well as the many multi-factorial diseases in which genetic predisposition plays an important role. Currently the human genome project research and the technologies developed are being used in: molecular medicine, energy sources/environmental applications, risk assessment, Bioarchaeology, anthropology, evolution, human migration, DNA forensics (for identification purposes), agriculture, livestock breeding, bioprocessing and many other fields.

The Human Genome Project (HGP) was a world wide collaboration initiated to discover and create a database for the entire human genome.  A genome is the entire DNA of an organism (including its genes). DNA is made up of sequences of four different bases Adenine, Guanine, Thymine and Cytosine.  Knowing the specific sequence of these backbone bases allows us to compare and determine certain diseases.  For example sickle-cell anemia is caused from the alteration of a single base from A to T.  The identification of these differences makes it possible to research and seek medical advances on diseases and DNA disorders. To further understand the importance and significance of the sequence of the human genome studies were carried out on non human species such as the fruit fly, mice, and e-coli. 
	
Creating a means to store the information obtained by the Human Genome Project was a challenge in itself.   The human genome contains approximately 3 billion different sequences which alone would take up about 3 gigabytes of memory additional memory would be required for the ongoing advances on these sequences.  Bioinformatics Morey Parang, Richard Mural and Mark Adams were the main contributors to designing a means to store this massive amount of information.   
	
Other goals of the HGP include: identifying all 20 to 25 thousand genes in the human DNA, improve tools for data analysis, transfer technologies to private sectors, and address the ethical, legal, and social (ELSI) that might come from the HGP.  

The three billion dollar project was supposed to take 15 years to complete, as a combined world wide effort, including scientists from China, Japan, UK, Germany, and France. Strangely enough, the project was finished in 13 years rather than the expected 15. Some believe that the reason behind this anomaly is because of a privately funded only around three hundred million dollar project by Celera Genomics. Because an Celera Genomics declared that they were going to finish sequencing the human genome before the three billion dollar effort put forth by the cooperative effort from scientists around the world. They used a slightly more risky approach called the &quot;shotgun sequencing&quot;, instead of sequencing the genome in a linear manner, they &quot;shot&quot; the seqeuences into small segments and found where they overlapped. The competition between the two groups helped fuel the project, as larger efforts were put forth from both parties to finish before the other. Thus, both shared equal amounts of work towards the finished project of the sequencing of the entire human genome.

The project started in 1990 and was completed in the year 2003.  Although the goals established by this project were completed the information obtained is still being analyzed and researched in order to make advances in life sciences.  The HGP has benefited many areas of science such as molecular medicine, energy sources and environmental applications, risk assessments, bioarchaeology, anthropology, evolution, human migration, DNA forensics, and bioprocessing.  Although the human genome is now considered &quot;complete&quot;, there are still many sections of the genome that haven't been sequenced as of yet. Many gaps still exist, but the sequences are put onto world wide data bases such as BLAST as the small tadbits are sequenced by different groups around the world.

== Why the Human Genome Project? ==

The human genome project was developed in order to open the eyes of mankind. 

For instance, through sequencing the human genome, scientists can now study genetic diseases in more detail and depth. The human genome project has helped identify genes associated with different genetic conditions such as myotonic dystrophy, fragile X syndrome, Alzheimer's disease, familial breast cancer and more. This will help researchers develop better ways to treat the root of the conditions rather than just the symptoms of the diseases. In traditional medicine, it will also allow earlier identification of diseases and treatment options customized to individuals. Research is also underway to improve gene therapy—in the future, scientists may be able to fix or replace faulty genes.  Another area of research involves the variation in individual response to environment.   As researchers determine which genes code for sensitivity to environmental pressures, like carcinogens and irritants, they will be able to better predict the risks involved for an individual exposed to a risky environment. One of the most important results of this area of study is an increased understanding on how low-level exposure to radiation effects cancer risc.

This project also helped boost forensics; scientists can now create DNA fingerprints of small areas of DNA regions that vary between individuals, allowing for accurate identification techniques. Fluids, tissue, and hair at crime scenes have greatly increased in utility as a direct result of genetic research. The importance of the Human Genome Project to forensics extends beyond the criminal sphere. The &quot;DNA fingerprints&quot; can also be used match organ donors, establish familial relationships, and identify microorganisms that might be polluting an environment. 

Because of the expansion of the general knowledge related to sequencing genomes, smaller projects such as the microbial genome program were developed to sequence the genomes of bacteria. The goal of this is to find ways to produce energy, reduce toxic wastes, and industrial processing through the use of microbes and microbial enzymes. It can be used to analyze in greater depth the influence of even the tiniest forms of life on an ecosystem.  Also, sequencing certain microbial genomes allows scientists valuable insight into the ways pathogenic microbes infect the human body.   Because of the dependence humans have on the microbial world, the relationship between human world and the microbial world is also worth researching. This will benefit both human health and the environment.

The human genome project has also helped people understand the road humankind took in the process of evolution. It gives scientists a glimpse of history as it helps connect the three kingdoms of life: determine a complete lack of ethnic divisions Archaebacteria, Prokaryotes, and Eukaryotes.   Comparative genomics aid scientists in determining what specific segments of human DNA code for by comparing them to the equivalent segments in other organisms.   

As for more recent history, DNA studies have been used to on an ethnic level, proving that ethnicities are the product of society, not different DNA.  That said, specific markers on the Y chromosome can be used to trace the migrations of a man's paternal line throughout human history.
The field of behavioral genetics has also been aided by the completion of the Human Genome Project. For years, scientists recognized evidence that many behaviors have biological foundations. For example, within a species certain behaviors consistently crop up, and such specific behaviors can be passed along to later generations (like the herding instincts of an Australian Shepherd).  Further support for this theory includes cross-species parallels in behavior, particularly with closely related species.  While traditionally the area of behavioral genetics has been centered around the study of twins and adoptees in an attempt to clarify the nature vs. nurture debate—that is, how much of our behavior is actually coded into our DNA, and how much has resulted from environmental influences.  Behavioral genetics is complicated by both the difficulty of quantifying certain abstract concepts (i.e. intelligence) and by the fact that any behaviors are coded by multiple genes and affected by other factors.  In addition, any results from research regarding behavioral genetics will likely be hot-button issues and thus will require greater care before drawing conclusions. 

Finally, the human genome project has developed many techniques for genetic engineering, resulting in genetically modified plants and animals for better food and energy production. Examples include crops engineered to require less pesticide use or less water.  The human genome project has also allowed the development of plants that break down certain types of waste. This has led to many disputes over the right of man to alter &quot;natural&quot; organisms and concern over the long-term effect of genetically modified organisms—particularly those intended for human consumption.

== Tools Used To Sequence The Genome ==

The DNA sequence of humans if first broken into smaller projects called a cosmid, BAC, PAC, or P1 clone. These projects can be assigned to private labs all across the world. The following phases are the order in which private or government labs sequence these portions or contigs of the main genome.

'''The Random Phase'''
For many labs this means using the shotgun approach to sequencing DNA and it utilizes DNA restriction enzyme to cut the project DNA into varying sizes of base pair regions. 

'''Gap Closure Phase'''
Connecting the fragments of DNA caused by restriction enzyme is a bottleneck in the process of DNA sequencing and it has been greatly sped up through gold standard computer programs such as phredPhrap. As these programs become better less overlap is needed to find matching strands, but at the same time the higher the overlap of these strands the higher the accuracy. 

'''Ambiguity Resolution Phase'''
Through the use of programs such as confed, the low quality regions of the sequenced DNA can be analyzed for anomalies such as deletions or contaminant reads. This step is mostly a finishing or spell check function that acts to increase the accuracy of the raw sequenced DNA. 

'''Analysis Phase'''
This portion of the sequencing finds known patterns that are common to DNA. Patterns are found by programs such as BLAST, XGRAIL, and REPBASE. The commonalities looked for by XGRAIL include exons, introns, poly-a sites, promoter regions (TATA boxes, etc.), and repetitive bases. REPBASE will find repetitive sequences that are known to exist in families and subfamilies. BLAST has a large community of scientists who input DNA sequences of a wide range of species and allows the DNA in question to find its nearest evolutionary relative.

== Viewing the Genome through DNA Maps ==

There are many different ways of mapping the human Genome. One of the most common ways is in units of Centimorgans. Every centimorgan represents a one percent chance that two genes will separate during meiosis. One example is a gene that is inherited with Huntington’s disease 96 percent of the time. The remaining 4 percent of the time it does not travel with Hunington’s disease and thus it has a 4cM from that gene. 

Of the maps that are used to view DNA there are two kinds of maps, genetic-linkage and physical maps. Genetic Linkage maps view DNA in reference to another DNA group and how often they are inherited together. These genetic maps include Cytogenetic maps, Restriction Maps, Cosmid maps, and Sequence Maps. 

'''The Cytogenetic map''' was created by Victr McKusick, and it utilizes chromosomal staining in order to view groups. This method is limited in resolution as the target gene a scientist may be seeking could be in a stain containing ten million base pairs. That is why this method is useful for broad analysis and narrowing a sequence down to certain regions of the chromosome. 

'''The Restriction map''' was created by Dr. Raymond White, and it utilizes restriction enzymes. This process takes the genome of a family or generation of people and finds the percentage of genes that are close together between these related people. By using restriction enzymes the same specific sequence of DNA is cut from the genomes of the family and can be analyzed. The resolution of this methods is ten times greater than Cytogenetic mapping and can focus in on a genetic marking within one million base pairs. 

'''Cosmid maps''' are used from the actual overlapping sequence of base pairs derived from shotgun methods of sequencing. This methods takes bases of roughly 40,000 base pair lengths and overlaps them. The resolution of this method is highly accurate and can find a gene within 10,000 – 100,000 base pairs. 

'''The Sequence Map''' is the actual culmination of all sequencing and lists the entire order of the known genome of all 46 chromosomes. IT consists of over 3 billion base pairs and has 20,000 - 25,000 protein encoding genes.

== Ethical Dilemas ==

'''&quot;If scientists don't play God, who will?&quot; James Watson, former head of the Human Genome Project.''' 

The Human Genome Project raised many ethical concerns, with knowledge of the entire human DNA sequence and genes they code, people could alter their genes, (for a price) leading to possible genetic discrimination and other moral ramifications from “playing God”.  While the intentions may be noble, trying to better understand and help treat the many genetic diseases and defects that afflict mankind, many believe genetic manipulation/alteration is a slippery slope. While now most research is targeted at identifying or treating birth defects that are caused by a single gene, such as cystic fibrosis and Tay-Sachs disease, as well as more daunting ventures such as preventing diabetes, heart disease and other big killers, many worry what will come next. Will the mind will be targeted for improvement—preventing alcohol addiction and mental illness, and enhancing visual acuity or intelligence trying to improve the human design?  Even genetic testing of fetuses raises questions about the ethical ramifications of ever more accurate genetic screening.  Where should the line be drawn in eliminating perceived defects? On a more mundane note, the completion of the Human Genome Project raised concerns about genetic discrimination by employers and health insurance companies based on individual predisposition to current diseases. As of May 2008, GINA (Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act) protects individuals from such discrimination, and precludes employers from demanding such tests.    

Dr. Marvin Frazier, who fields human genome questions as director of the Life Sciences Division of the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Biological and Environmental Research, says it will take decades for scientists to figure out how to manipulate human intelligence or athletic ability, because of the complexity of the traits (they rely on a lot of genes) and the unknown role the environment plays on these abilities. To achieve desired goals the costs would be tremendous, not only in fiscal capital but human capital as well due to the large amount of risky experimentation that would be involved. &quot;It is my opinion that this would be wrong,&quot; he added, &quot;but that will not stop some people from wanting to try. The key question is not whether human (genetic) manipulation will occur, but how and when it will.”

==Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA): Major Impacts==

On May 21, 2008, President George W. Bush made into law the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA). The law prevents U.S. insurance companies as well as employers from pre-screening potential prospects based on the information of their genetic tests. The bill finally passed both chambers of Congress after certain disagreements were worked out, but not until a few months have passed.

GINA was put into effect to prevent prejudiced situations such as when an arbitrary employer uses a future employee’s genetic information to determine performance level, proneness to tardiness, health risk, etc. It is also illegal to request or demand a genetic test under the law.

Without the fear of affecting their jobs or insurance rates, Americans would be more willing to go through genetic testing for diseases. This is encouraging because it could open doors to new medical discoveries and cures. It also allows early detection of health problems, leading to cost effective preventive solutions.

You may want to customize your installation if: 
*you want to install a new set of packages during the OpenBSD installation.
*if you want to report an installation problem.
*If you want to change the default configuration files. 

==Inside the iso==

Mount the iso and cd into it. See the Guide to Unix [[Guide_to_Unix/Explanations/Filesystems_and_Swap#Disk_Images|Explanation]] section on how to mount an iso file.
Then the &lt;your OpenBSD release&gt;, and then &lt;your processor&gt; directory.
 cd /&lt;where the mounted iso is located&gt;/&lt;your OpenBSD release&gt;/&lt;your processor&gt;

For me it is:
 cd /Volumes/OpenBSD:i386_4.4_Install_CD/4.4/i386
&lt;font size=0&gt;''(My auto-mount system gives the files that it mounts long names).''&lt;/font&gt;

===Layout===
For OpenBSD 4.4 i386 it is:
 '''4.4'''
    '''i386'''
       &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 9.3pt;&quot; id=&quot;fn_BASE44.tgz_back&quot;&gt;[[#fn_BASE44.tgz|BASE44.tgz]]&lt;/span&gt;

==Customize==
Take the packages out of the iso and edit them as described below. Then take all of the files and make a new iso.
===Install additional packages===
Cd into the iso as directed before. Now change the file permissions. If you want another package installed as an option. Take the package and rename it (do not put a period):
 site&lt;your version&gt;-&lt;the package name&gt;.tgz

For abiword on OpenBSD 4.4, it is:
 site44-abiword.tgz

You will also have to find its dependencies and include them as well.

===Change configuration files===
Untar etc44.tgz. You will find all of the default configuration files in etc. inside of the package. Edit them and retar them.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Modern Approach to Gene Design ==

A typical gene design cycle starts with defining a desired target protein.  From there  the scientist, using a gene composer computer program, inputs information such as functional characterization data, sequence alignments or knowledge of related 3D structural information from various sources that pertain to the desired protein.  Secondary structural information is annotated and amino acids in the active domains (i.e. - participate in ligand binding sites, are water exposed, or form crystal contacts) are labeled, and multiple amino acid sequence variants are generated. The next step is back-translating designed amino acid sequences into nucleic acid sequences.  The program will generate optimized nucleic acid sequences based on defined criteria input by the user, such as codon optimization for highly expressed proteins, suppressing strong mRNA structure forming elements and avoiding undesired restriction sites.  Finally, sequences for complete genes are output. The adoption of this new method of protein design allows heterologous expression of proteins to be tested more quickly and minimizes failure rates.


== Benefits/Uses of Gene Design ==

Gene/Protein design is currently being utilized for a number of important applications including: 

1.Immunotoxins- chimeric protein made from a gene for an antibody and a gene for a toxin, which can be used to kill cells that are recognized by the antibody

2.Synthetic vaccines- recombining DNA to create noninfectious coat proteins of viruses 

3.Completely new genes and proteins with functions not found in nature

4.New enzymes

5.New drugs 

6.Disease research for Malaria, Anthrax, HIV, Alzheimer's and Various Cancers

As for lessons, I've had a look at [http://www.jlptstudy.com www.jlptstudy.com] and I think it will do for the time being. The lessons should start off at the beginning though and assume no knowledge of Japanese. They should teach hiragana, pronunciation and kanji as the course progresses. 

[[User:Raichu2|Raichu2]] ([[User talk:Raichu2|talk]]) 07:09, 15 November 2008 (UTC)

:I think the [[Japanese | front]] page is pretty good for the categorization.. albeit the color scheme could be spruced up.  We can add bits/topics as we see fit.  Most topics to these categories will rarely change. I moved the reference down just to explicitly make clear that this should be more of an appendix.  I'm not sure how to work an appendix here, but maybe [[User:Swift]] has some ideas using wiki categories or something. 

:I'm not sure if the hiragana needs to be reworked into another lesson format.  Swift has worked pretty hard on getting the [[Japanese/Kana | kana]] pages worked out.  The first lesson plan can merely link right to the current Kana page. What I'm looking for is more of a framework for the lessons as more and more of these will hopefully pop up, something like the following is what I had in mind:

:* Dialogue (by posters, conversations, or whatever.)
:* Discussion of Vocabulary in Dialogue
:** Discuss various uses of vocabulary if necessary (e.g., politeness)
:** Optional links to dialogues for previously learned vocabulary
:* Grammar
:** Discuss grammar points, giving more examples if necessary.
:** Link to previous grammar points (maybe by categories)
:* Optional Quick Review
:* Optional link to Wikiversity for practice work.

:We could probably use wiki categories for different grammar points.  However, this would generate a ton of wiki categories, but it would get rid of the load of dependencies for a Reference page.  The problem with this is that it's a very traditional setup, and probably requires a lesson-by-lesson approach.   Let me know what you think.  --[[User:Retropunk|Retropunk]] ([[User talk:Retropunk|talk]]) 08:56, 15 November 2008 (UTC)

::IMHO I think the front page layout is pretty darn good. My main point is that the lesson link should come immediately before the introduction. The reference links should come after that.

::I'm looking at it from the point of view of someone coming to the wikibook. People come wanting something, and for the project to be successful, the layout and content has to deliver with the minimum of effort. The more people end up following needless or incorrect links, the greater chance they will leave. If they find themselves fumbling around having to search for the right material, they will definitely leave. I know it might sound corny, but for the project to be worthwhile, we need to provide a good user experience. That means both relevant and quality content, and a good layout so people can find that content with near-zero effort.

::Now people will come for one of two main reasons.

::(1) They come to learn Japanese. They will want to see straight up what the site offers. A ''small'' number of links to introductory topics of immediate relevance (like &quot;how to use this book&quot;) and immediately following, a link to the lessons, is what will give them that.

::The lessons, like I said earlier, should cater for all levels, but the link to each lesson should clearly indicate the content, so people ''immediately'' know which lesson to try first.

::To cater for absolute beginners, the lessons have to start off assuming no knowledge. That means teaching enough of the writing system to be able to start teaching the language, which basically means starting off with hiragana. Katakana can be introduced later and kanji gradually. (There is [http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/ a school of thought] that recommends learning to recognize the 常用漢字 before anything else, but I think that's too radical for most potential readers.)

::Is that a problem? If we have some material for teaching kana, can't we convert it into lessons at the start of the lesson plan?

::(2) They come to look something up in the reference section. I think that people might be prepared to make a click or two more to find what they want, but even so, the arrangement of material should be as obvious as possible. That's one think I like about the front page layout as is stands. A flatter structure is better, so I now agree more with the current structure rather than the variation I proposed above.

::As for your lesson outline, you're presenting a sample passage/dialogue, a vocab list so they understand what the words mean, an explanation of the grammar so they understand how they're put together (with more examples), and some exercises to consolidate their understanding. Is that what you mean?

::That's certainly a commonly used method. One thing that bugs me, though. Shouldn't people need to be able to take in what they read without having to backtrack? With your idea, the reader comes across some incomprehensible sentences, then gets told how they work, and then would have to go back and read them again to see if they understand them now.

::So what about an arrangement that does not require backtracking? For example,
::* heading: grammar point 1
::** sample sentence(s) illustrating grammar point 1
::** vocab for this sentence
::** explanation
::** further examples
::* heading: grammar point 2
::** sample sentence(s) etc. ...
::* heading: grammar point 3
::** sample sentence(s) etc. ...
::* example passage/dialogue
::* exercises

::In fact, Tae Kim's ''[http://www.guidetojapanese.org/ Guide to Japanese Grammar]'' dispenses with the introductory sample sentence altogether. He just explains a point and gives some examples. Given that there seem to be many people out there who learn by following an example, however, it's probably better to start off with sample sentences. (I am not one of them--I prefer learning the rules first, then seeing examples second.)

::What do you think? In the mean time, I'm going to try to get hold of McCormick's Italian book. I learned a fair amount of Italian from it and I have no recollection of ever having to backtrack. I'll see what arrangement he used.

::[[User:Raichu2|Raichu2]] ([[User talk:Raichu2|talk]]) 04:56, 16 November 2008 (UTC)

:::I don't think we need a kana lesson because there's already a good amount of material developed to act as the lesson, not that a lesson shouldn't be made.  The material is quite basic in that, you can't really go into a lot of details about the kana.  As a native speaker of English, I would have no idea how to go into details about our alphabet.  Only, here it is, the pronunciation (including variations), and some sample words.  I'm an advocate to teach the kana first or that the reader should know kana before trying to understand / learn the language.  It's not that difficult to learn the material... to me at least.  This is why I think the current Kana page should be linked as the first lesson.  Swift and others may disagree, and I would advise them to chirp in.
::: As for learning the 常用漢字, I would agree that it would be impratical to learn this before studying grammar.  There's too many that are similar, and regardless of what Heisig thinks, it's difficult to learn that much without getting some more substance.  The average reader will get bored... quickly.  I do not think we should go down this avenue.  If the reader believes this is a suitable path, they can learn the kanji via the JLPT Kanji pages.
::: As for rewriting/restructing the lessons, we may need to restructure the front page to point to separate pages for each division (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, and Near Native.)  I think the JLPT is the perfect divider for judging competency in each division/level. For separating the actual lesson information, I've only suggested my plan because that's the way I'm used to it. If we're goign to push the dialogue to the bottom, we're going to need to put another introduction to the material and the material needed before studying the lesson.  This isn't a bad idea and putting the material at the end is fine idea, but I would think if the reader doesn't understand the dialogue, he would still be reverting back to the lesson.  Regardless, I'm not a stickler on putting the material at the end or the beginning.  --[[User:Retropunk|Retropunk]] ([[User talk:Retropunk|talk]]) 10:26, 16 November 2008 (UTC)

: Thanks for your hard work on the outline, Raichu2. One note, though: While it's your first go at an outline for this wikibook, it isn't the first one proposed. I count [[Japanese/Practical Lessons|1]], [[Japanese/Material to be Re-organised|2]], [[User:Retropunk/Japanese_Curriculum|3]] detailed syllabi. If we add lesson plans/pages, we get [[Japanese/Elementary Japanese|4.1]], [[Japanese/Basic Japanese|4.2]], [[Japanese/Intermediate Japanese|4.3]], [[Japanese/Grammar Lessons|5]], [[User:Helpfulstuffnz/Japanese|6]] pages with an outline for this book. That would make yours at least the fourth or seventh depending on how you define it. In the day you were poking around before posting this outline you may have noticed that this book has been in development for five years.
: I'd suggest that discussions on outlines take place elsewhere. I don't think this talk page is a terribly productive place to develop such material. There is, after all, a reason why each page has a corresponding talk page. I'd suggest you create a page for it (e.g. on a subpage to your userpage such as [[User:Raichu2/Japanese outline]]). It can then be discussed on its talk page and modified accordingly.
: If feel the outline is the highest priority for this book, I'd suggest you continue poking around. There are layers upon layers of ideas out there. I think Retropunk's work may prove very useful. You might want to collaborate with him, but I think we can allow parallel outlines for now. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 11:44, 16 November 2008 (UTC)

::Well I think it makes no sense working on detail unless you know where it fits into the scheme of things. Especially on a wiki project. You need a ''very'' good structure in which contributors can work towards filling it in as they get the time. If everyone works without regard for the whole, then no matter how great the details are, how is it going to develop into a cohesive and useful whole?

::When I visited the main page, I could not find out what the plan is or how material is arranged or anything. If someone's done the work, that's great. However, please make it available from an obvious link on the home page. If I can see there's a plan for the work, then I'll see what's been done, what needs to be done, and try to help out. If there is no plan, or no plan that is accessible, then we need to start on one. To write a book, you need to
::* identify your audience, scope, resources, etc.
::* develop requirements that the work must satisfy in accordance with audience/scope
::* make appropriate design decisions accordingly about the nature of the work
::* develop an outline that satisfies the requirements in accordance with design decisions
::* work on the text
::* proofread the text
::* beta test
::* publish
::(In a wikibook, the proofreading/beta testing can happen piecemeal as soon as parts are written.) Notice that writing the material is only a single line in this process. It may be the majority of the work, but it only makes sense if the rest of the process has been followed. It is not obvious to me how much of it has been followed, and I'm just trying as quickly as possible trying to get my head around where everything stands.

== Placement of the lesson plans ==

OK, while not completely trivial, this issue is hardly the most important. Furthermore, I'm a little afraid to touch it since it fits all the criteria to evolve into a [[w:Parkinson's Law of Triviality|bike-shed discussion]]. I've flipped a few times since I saw Retropunk's change and might still change my view again. I thought I'd leave you some of my thoughts.

Initially, I placed the lesson plans at the bottom since my aim was to first gather what intelligeable material was out there into the categories. These could later be added to and massaged into a string of lessons, slowly evolving into a consistent book. Since I didn't see that happen for a while, the most interesting stuff would be in the introduction and four categories; so the lessons ended up at the bottom.

But if there really isn't so much to be found in the lesson plans, then these might just as well be placed higher up. They don't take much room and as they grow their weight will justify their prominence.

Placing the lesson plans in the middle of the four categories seems a bit odd, but then one could argue that it shouldn't precede the kana lessons. Well, that depends on what we want these lesson plans to look like. If they will assume knowledge of the kana, then those lessons should come first. If they are going to refererence the kana pages, then we might as well place the lesson plans even higher, right below the introduction. The categories would then follow as the reference that Retropunk made them to be.

Whatever the decision, I doubt it will make or break this book. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 16:14, 17 November 2008 (UTC)

:Maybe not. However, I feel it is a symptom of a more general problem. Perhaps that's because various people have dabbled with this site over time and maybe it has lacked a clear direction.

:My main point is that when someone comes to a web site, it needs to be ''blindingly obvious at first glance'' what the site offers them, how to navigate it and how to use it. If you fail on any of those, you are very likely to lose most prospective readers. You have a few square inches at the very top of the home page where you must instantly grab your reader's attention and tell them what the site can do for them. The most important links need to be clearly visible without having to scroll, and what they offer must be self-explanatory. [[User:Raichu2|Raichu2]] ([[User talk:Raichu2|talk]]) 02:34, 22 November 2008 (UTC)

== Difference between &quot;How to use this book&quot; and &quot;Study methods&quot; ==

It may be a bit premature to ask, but how do you see the split between these two? It seems to me that study methods are closely linked with how one uses the book. Other aspects of how to use the book might serve well in the current [[Japanese/Introduction]] page which, at times, sounds perhaps a bit too encyclopaedic. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 17:48, 17 November 2008 (UTC)

:From what I understand, &quot;Study Methods&quot; is are recommended methodologies for studying a foreign language - aka, tips.  &quot;How to use this book&quot; should be a small discussion on how we (or the community) think the book should be used.  I guess we can see it as a precautionary attempt to help the reader, and not have the reader wander aimlessly or whatever, &quot;What's this doohickey for?&quot;   I'm not against removing it.  It's only a suggestion by [[User:Raichu2 | Raichu]].  --[[User:Retropunk|Retropunk]] ([[User talk:Retropunk|talk]]) 07:01, 20 November 2008 (UTC)

::Yeah, it's only a suggestion. I'm looking at it from a visitor's point of view. Ideally a site should be arranged so that how to use it is self-explanatory. If there is anything a reader will need to know to get maximum value from the site, the information should be clearly and directly accessible.

::As for study methods, when I read a title like that, I think that's do to with techniques for studying generally, as well as tips for learning Japanese. For example, you might suggest someone use an SRS in addition to using this site, or include references to dictionaries and the like.

::Obviously the two are related and perhaps they should be combined. But the link label should reflect exactly what a visitor from this site will need to do about it. If it's a must-read, then call it &quot;How to use this wikibook&quot;. If it's helpful suggestions, then call it &quot;How to get the most out of this wikibook&quot;. If this site is completely self-explanatory and you just want to offer general information about study, then call it &quot;study methods&quot; by all means.

== Writing Styles ==

While interesting, this might be further into the scope of a book on calligraphy. [[East Asian Orthography]] might be a more suitable home for this. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 17:50, 17 November 2008 (UTC)

:This was not an attempt to categorize orthography, but rather literary styles. I guess I can change it to Literary Styles as Writing Styles may be too ambiguous. We'll have to see what Raichu had in mind for introducing different literary styles. --[[User:Retropunk|Retropunk]] ([[User talk:Retropunk|talk]]) 07:08, 20 November 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <comment>/* What is gene therapy? */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== What is gene therapy? ==

Gene therapy is an experimental technique that uses genes to treat or prevent diseases. Genes are specific sequences of bases that encode instructions on how to make proteins. When genes are altered so that the encoded proteins are unable to carry out their normal functions, genetic disorders can result. Gene therapy is used for correcting defective genes responsible for disease development. 
Researchers may use one of several approaches for correcting faulty genes.
Although gene therapy is a promising treatment which helps successfully treat and prevent various diseases including inherited disorders, some types of cancer, and certain viral infections, it is still at experimental stage. Gene therapy is currently only being tested for the treatment of diseases that have no other cures.
Mackenzie Meyers was here

== Methods ==

There are many methods utilized to try and correct these altered genes:

•	A normal gene can be inserted into a nonspecific location within the genome to replace a nonfunctional gene. This is the most common method.

•	An abnormal gene could be swapped for a normal gene through homologous recombination.

•	The abnormal gene could be repaired through selective reverse mutation, which returns the gene to its normal function.

•	The regulation (act of turning the gene on or off) of a particular gene could be altered.

Using the method of inserting a normal gene to replace the disease-causing gene, a vector is used to deliver the new gene to the target cells. The most commonly used vector is a genetically altered virus that can carry normal human DNA. Target cells are then infected with the viral vector as the vector unload the genetic information into the target cell. This restores the target cell to the normal state.

EX VIVO method: cells are genetically-altered outside of the body and then reintroduced.

IN VIVO method: cells are genetically-altered inside the body after a genetically-altered vector containing therapeutic DNA is injected into the body.

[[File:ExVivoGeneTherapy.jpg]]

[[File:In vivo gene therapy.jpg]]

== Vectors ==

In order to insert a “normal” gene to replace the abnormal/defective one, a carrier molecule called a vector must be used to deliver the new gene to the target cells. The most common vector used is a virus that has been genetically altered to carry normal human DNA. Because viruses have evolved a way of encapsulating and delivering their genes to human cells in a pathogenic manner, they make excellent vectors, provided they are manipulated to remove disease-causing genes and instead insert therapeutic genes.  Target cells are infected with the viral vector and the vector unloads its genetic material containing the “normal” gene into the target cell. The main types of viruses used as gene therapy vectors include: Retroviruses, Adenoviruses, Adeno-associated viruses and Herpes simplex viruses. Retroviruses are a unique class of viruses that make double-stranded DNA copies of their RNA genomes which are integrated into the chromosomes of host cells. Adenoviruses is another class of viruses with the double-stranded DNA genome property that causes respiratory, intestinal, and eye inflections. Adeno-association viruses is a class of viruses that use single-stranded DNA to insert their genetic material at a specific sit. Herpes simplex viruses is a class of double-stranded DNA viruses that infect neurons.


There are also several non-viral options for gene delivery, the simplest being direct introduction of therapeutic DNA into target cells. However, this approach is limited in its application because it can be used only with certain tissues and requires large amounts of DNA. Another non-viral approach is the creation of an artificial lipid sphere with an aqueous core, (i.e. - a liposome), which is capable of carrying the DNA and then passing it through the target cell's membrane.  Another way to get the DNA inside target cells is by chemically linking it to a molecule that will bind to special cell receptors. Once the molecule is bound to the receptors, the DNA is engulfed by the cell membrane and passed into the interior of the target cell. However, this delivery system tends to be less effective than other options.


Many of the challenges that make non-viral techniques ineffective is the challenge of getting genetic material past the plasma membrane without the help of viruses and avoiding the host's immune response.  Methods using liposomes and plasmids are usually coupled with techniques to help facilitate the process of delivering genetic material past the plasma membrane. Electroporation is the use of electric shock from a high-voltage source to induce the formation of pores along the cell membrane to allow genetic material to enter.  Sonoporation is similar, but uses acoustic sound waves to create these openings.  While these techniques are used to make the delivery of genetic material by liposomes and plasmids more effective, they run the risk of causing cell death by rupturing the membrane.


In the future scientists hope to apply particle bombardment which has been successfully used to introduce genetic material in plants in the form of a gene gun.  The concept would involve using small particles of gold along with liposomes/plasmids in &quot;bullets&quot; to punch pores in the cell membrane and deliver the genes to the interior.  Although this is commonly used in the laboratory for research, it is a technique limited to be used ex vitro.

== Short-comings of Gene Therapy: ==


•'''Short-lived nature of gene therapy''' – There are many problems with integrating the new DNA into the genome, the new DNA introduced into target cells must remain functional and the cells must live long and remain stable. However, rapidly dividing nature of many cells prevents gene therapy from achieving any long-term benefits; patients would have to undergo multiple rounds of gene therapy. 

•'''Immune response''' - Anytime a foreign object is introduced into human tissues, the immune system is designed to attack the invader, making it difficult to deliver the “normal” gene effectively. Furthermore, the immune system's enhanced response to invaders it has seen before makes it difficult for gene therapy to be repeated in patients.

•'''Problems with viral vectors''' – While viral vectors are the carrier of choice in most gene therapy studies, they also present a variety of potential problems: toxicity, immune and inflammatory responses, gene control and targeting issues and the possibility that the virus may recover its ability to cause disease while inside the patient. 

•'''Multi-gene disorders'''- Conditions or disorders that arise from mutations in a single gene are the best/most effectively treated using gene therapy. Unfortunately, many of most common disorders, such as heart disease, high blood pressure, Alzheimer's disease, arthritis, and diabetes, are caused by the combined effects of variations in multiple genes. These disorders would be especially difficult to treat effectively using gene therapy.


However there have been many recent developments/advancements in gene therapy research, making it safer, and more effective, the field of gene therapy holds great potential for the future of medicine.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Maps ==

The workhorse data structure of script languages is the map, also called &quot;dictionary&quot; (Python), &quot;table&quot; (Lua), &quot;associative array&quot;, &quot;hash&quot; or even &quot;object&quot; (ECMAScript), as set of key-value pairs. The underlying implementation most often uses hashing, which has the side effect that iterating through a dictionary follows no order.

The syntax for accessing one item in a map is universially &lt;tt&gt;a [x]&lt;/tt&gt;, the languages differ whether accesses using a key not in the map returns some null value or raise an exception.

In most cases maps also implement records and objects, so that &lt;tt&gt;a.foo&lt;/tt&gt; essentially is the same as &lt;tt&gt;a [&quot;foo&quot;]&lt;/tt&gt;. This identity may be exposed as in ECMAScript and Lua or hidden from the surface.

Some languages even implement sequences just as maps which happen to have integer indices, so that the map is the only fundamental data structure in them.


== Sequences ==

Also called &quot;arrays&quot;, &quot;vectors&quot; and &quot;tuples&quot;.


=== Lua ===

Lua internally optimize access to map (&quot;table&quot;) elements having consecutive integer keys. The only exposed special casing for sequences, which are otherwise normal tables (and so can additionally hold entries with noninteger keys) are a special constructur syntax and the length operator &quot;#&quot;.</text>

'''Background Notes'''

=== Caffeine ===

What’s another name for 3,7-dihydro-1,3,7-trimethyl-1H-purine-2,6,-dione? Yep,
CAFFEINE. Caffeine is the most popular drug in the world, and we’ve all been
known to try it at least once: in coffee, tea, cocoa, some soft drinks, some
drugs… …and in the popular treat, chocolate!

The actual source of caffeine is the coffee bean, tealeaf, kola nut and cacao pod.
Pure caffeine is odourless and has a bitter taste.

Caffeine is a central nervous system stimulant. In moderate doses, caffeine can:
* increase alertness and speed of reactions
* reduce memory
* reduce fine motor coordination (giving you shaky hands!)
* cause insomnia (sleepless nights!)
* cause headaches, nervousness and dizziness

Caffeine enters the bloodstream through the stomach and small intestine and starts
to have its effects within fifteen minutes of ingestion. Once in the body, it takes
about six hours for one half of the caffeine to be eliminated.

Why is caffeine said to be addictive? One way to tell if someone &quot;can’t live without&quot;
that mocha latte or two shots of espresso is to take it away from them and see what
happens.

Typical withdrawal symptoms associated with caffeine include throbbing headaches
and aching muscles. These symptoms can occur within 24 hours after your last
“dose” of coffee.

One study has said that the minimum consumption of caffeine for you to be labelled
a coffee-addict is four cups of coffee per day. But it really depends on you! Some
people, if they don’t get that one cup in the morning, just can’t function at all!
In massive doses, caffeine is lethal. A fatal dose of caffeine has been calculated to be
more than 10g. To get this dose, you’d need to drink 80-100 cups of coffee in one
sitting - good news for coffee houses everywhere, but extremely difficult to do!
Did you know?

=== How Coffee was discovered… ===

“Legend has it that coffee was &quot;discovered&quot; around 850 AD in upper
Egypt by a goat herded named Khaldi. One night, Khaldi's goats did not
return home. When he found his goats, Khaldi saw them dancing
around a shrub with red berries (coffee beans). After Khaldi tried some
of the berries, he started to dance too. Khaldi spoke with some monks who
used the berries to make a drink and....coffee was born!”
(For further information see: http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/caff.html)

=== How to take a pulse ===

“The easiest place to take a pulse is at the wrist, whether it is your own or someone
else’s. The fingers – not the thumb because the ball of the thumb has too strong a
pulse of its own – should be lightly but firmly pressed over the radial artery. You’ll
find it about 1 cm in from the thumb side of the wrist. Move your fingers around a
little if you can’t find it right away; you will soon feel the gentle throbbing. Count the
number of beats in 30 seconds, using a watch with a second hand to make sure you
time it exactly, then multiply by two. A healthy pulse can be very variable. The
average resting adult’s rate is 70 per minute but can range from 60-80; children
have a higher rate and a baby’s may be 140. If active or excited, the pulse rate will
increase.”

(From the book, How to Hold a Crocodile by the Diagram Group)

==== Longest time survived without a pulse ====

“The longest time a human has survived without a pulse in their vascular system is
three days. Julie Mills (UK) was at the point of death from severe heart failure and
myocarditis when, on 14 August 1998, cardiac surgeons at the John Radcliffe
Hospital, Oxford, UK, used a non pulsatile blood pump (AB180) to support her for
one week. Her heart recovered in this time and the pump was removed.”

==== Slowest heartbeat in a mammal ====

“The mammal that is presumed to have the slowest heartbeat of any warm–blooded
animal is the blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus), with between four and eight beats
per minute dependent on whether or not the whale is diving. By comparison the
average adult human heart beats at 70 beats per minute. Blue whales also have the
largest heart of any animal and their heartbeat can be heard up to 32 km (20 miles)
away underwater.”

(From the Guinness World Records 2005: 50th Anniversary Edition

'''Consent Form'''

===INFORMATION SHEET===

Ask us if there is anything that is not clear or if you would like more information.

Take time to decide whether or not you wish to take part.

Date:

====Study title====

The effects of a caffeinated cola drink.

====Invitation paragraph====

We are asking if you would agree to take part in a research project to find the
answer to the question “what are the effects of drinking caffeine?”

Before you decide if you want to join in it’s important to understand why the
research is being done and what it will involve for you. So please read this sheet
carefully.

====Why are we doing this research?====

We are looking into the effects of caffeine on how people perform in reaction time
tests, memory tests and to check heart rates.

What is the medicine, drug, device or procedure that is being tested?

No medicine, drug, device or procedure! Just a drink of cool, refreshing caffeinated
cola. But please let us know if you have an allergy to caffeine. It may be that you will
be in the control group, in which case you may not have any caffeine at all. This is
the placebo: a “dummy treatment”, looks like the real thing, but contains no active
ingredient.

====Why have I been asked to take part?====

You have been chosen because we want to see the results of this experiment on our
friends in other classes. The decision to take part is up to you.

====What will I have to do?====

During the course of the research you will be expected to have a drink. Before and
after this drink you will be required to do a selection of tests to measure your pulse
rate, reaction times, to test your memory and perhaps to look into how shaky your
hands are!

We may wish to interview you, and video/photograph you, so for this we will need
your permission, and these materials will all be kept confidential. All information on
you will be kept confidential.

The results of this study will be collated and presented within our science lesson.

====Who is organising and funding the research?====

Class is organising the research. Our science teacher is funding it!

====What are the possible benefits of taking part?====

The chance for us to conduct an experiment like real clinical scientists!

====Contact Details====

For further information please contact:

If you are worried about anything in this study, you should ask to speak with the
researchers who will do their best to answer your questions. If you’re still unhappy
and wish to make a formal complaint, you can do this through your science teacher.
But why would you want to do that? Hmm?

Thank you for taking the time to read this, and for your help. To show that you’ve
agreed, please sign the consent form now.

=English Opening=
===2.Nc3===
An instant way of reinforcing the attack on d5, Nc3 is the standard second move of the independent lines of the English opening. This move is also useful because it allows 3.Nf3, although some players prefer to play the Bremen System with 3.g3 preparing for 4.Bg2, and thus increasing control over d5 and keeping two good options for the development of the king's knight(a standard Nf3 or Ne2, which keeps the long diagonal open and offers some protection against the pinning and possible exchange of the other knight).

The flexibility of the English opening also applies for the black side which must choose how to develop after this move. While 2...Nf6 is flexible and provides some control over d5, 2...Nc6 is also possible, leading to sharp variations where white will have the initiative on the q-side with moves such as e3, Nge2, d4,Rb1 and b4, while black will have some counterplay on the opposite wing by advancing his k-side pawns, threatening to put the safety of the white king in some serious jeopardy.

No, I am not the same person as the other wknight, just a strange coincidence. Please don't post messages at [[User talk:Wknight8111]], it's just a redirect page.

==The First==
Obama won the office of the President on the 4th of November, 2008. He was sworn into office on January 20, 2009. He is the first African-American  in the United States to be elected to the office. He was elected after serving part of his first term as a United States Senator.

== Biography ==

[[w:Obama|Barack Hussein Obama]] II (b.August 4, 1961) is the President of the United States. He is the first African-American to serve as president. He was the junior senator of Illinois in 2005. He resigned on November 16, 2008, following his election to the presidency. He is a graduate of University of Columbia and Harvard, where he was president of the Harvard Law Review.
Ten years after the terrorist attack that took place on September 11th, Pakistan officials gave President Obama a lead that Osama Bin Laden was hiding in a densely populated city in their country. On May 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; President Obama authorized a covert operation to terminate Osama Bin Laden and was successful.

== Teaching constitutional law ==

Obama taught the constitutional law at the University of Chicago from 1992 to 2004. He announced his candidacy for the senate of the United States in January 2003, gained a primary victory in March 2004, and was elected in November 2004. Obama provided orientation with national convention Democratic in July 2004. As a member of the Democratic minority in the 109th congress, he helped to create the legislation to order the conventional armaments and to support a greater public responsibility in use of the Funds Federal. He also made official trips in Europe, the Middle East, and in Africa. During the 110th congress, he helped to create the legislation relating to incentive and electoral fraud, climate change, nuclear terrorism, and the care for turned over military manpower of the United States.

== Citizenship ==

There are allegations that Barack Obama was not born in the United States.  His certificate of live birth lists his birthplace as Hawaii&lt;ref&gt;[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/.a/6a00d8341c630a53ef0134803281ac970c-600wi Hawaii Certificate of Live Birth, Barack Obama]&lt;/ref&gt;, but the refusal of the State of Hawaii to release his long form birth certificate has contributed to continued allegations of foreign birth.

== Hobbies ==

It's no secret that Barack Obama is a very passionate sports fan and roots for the Chicago Bears, Bulls, Blackhawks, and White Sox. Being the president Obama has the privilege of congratulating and welcoming nearly all sports teams who win championships to the White House. Obama is also a strong advocate of changing the current college football BCS system to a traditional playoff format.

Obama is also a very avid basketball player and frequently plays competitive pickup games with his closest friends and advisors. Obama has a tradition on election day that he plays pickup games in whatever city he happens to be in. Reggie Love who is a member of Obama's staff and former football and basketball player at Duke University is almost always on Obama's team for a competitive advantage. Obama shoots the basketball left handed and wears pants because of his religious traditions.

:::: Non-anglo does not mean the same thing as black.  Asians and Native Americans fall into that category, as do South Pacific Islanders and the aborigines of Australia.  Obama is most definitely the first non-white to be elected to this position.  But I do agree with all Mike's other points!  This will most certainly be a part of history, but it is not possible to get a historical perspective when the event is still in the news.  That's the difference between current events and history.  Perhaps we should fork this into [[Current Events]] and move all the bits on W there as well? --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 04:15, 18 November 2008 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''John Roth''' is an art sculpture professor at Old Dominion University. 
Roth received his Bachelor of Science at Northern Michigan University and teaching certification in both Art Education and Industrial Art Education. He attended the University of Wisconsin-Madison from 1987-1990 and earned a Master of Fine Arts in painting and sculpture. Roth has an active exhibition record including shows in New York, London, Chicago, Philadelphia, and Minneapolis. He has won numerous grants and awards including fellowships from the Wisconsin Arts Board and the Dane County (Madison Wis) Cultural Affairs Commission as well as a faculty summer research grant from ODU.  Before graduate study, Roth was employed on dairy farms, in construction, and as a maintenance mechanic in a foundry, a chemical plant and a furniture factory. He also worked in a research and development lab making models, prototypes, lab apparatuses, and performing destructive testing. Before coming to ODU in 2005, Professor Roth was employed as a technician/instructor at Ohio University.



'''Interview'''

Q: What do you do to give to your undergraduate students an accurate understanding of the difficulties of an art career?
&lt;br&gt;A: I tell them my story.  Nothing was ever handed to me.  I persevered and and kept at it.  I took the non prestigious shows to build my resume.  It took me a long time to launch a successful academic career.

Q: What do you think about the current sculpture movement (changes)? (Note: we talked about time-based sculpture, altering object sculpture).
&lt;br&gt;A: Being a pluralist, I find validity in most sculpture born of rigor.  I look forward to having my comfortable notions of sculpture being tested and enjoy the challenges to these notions.

Q:  You told me you are more into &quot;object making&quot; art.
&lt;br&gt;A: Yes, I define myself as an object maker.  My challenge is to bring together concept/feeling with an object that meets my vision.  This suits my personality and disposition.

Q: What made you change from painting to sculpture?
&lt;br&gt;A: I made the switch midway through graduate school.  I had some training and ability manipulating materials as an industrial education major in undergraduate studies.  Branching out into 3-D was very enabling in that it opened many possibilities for my ideas which became unfettered by the 2-D format.

Q: Which artist got you into art?
&lt;br&gt;A: My mother who is a painter was the first working artist I became aware of. As a kid I was fascinated by the Hudson River school of landscape painting.  Early influential sculpture was those done by H C Westermann.

Q: Who is your favorite artist? You mentioned Los Carpinteros, Martin Puryear, H.C. Westermann. 
&lt;br&gt;A: I loved Los Carpinteros’ works, Tim Hawkinson as well.

I don't think the contributors to the [[Structural Biochemistry]] book pages you blanked appreciate that. You then delinked them from the table of contents. I also assume it was you doing this logged out. I had to ban the IP address for a week for doing that. Removing content wholesale without merging it or justification or a vote for deletion is uncalled for. Please stop. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:53, 10 July 2009 (UTC)


== I erased question to exams that have little to do with the content of wikibook and hinder students from getting a broad knowledge of the topic. thanks.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Defining a Shock-Wave==

In the general case of mechanical wave propagation it is assumed that the intensive properties of the medium can be described by continuous functions of space and time.  In the limit where pressure amplitudes become very large, the wave propagation can evolve such that the wave front becomes discontinuous and must be described in terms of a jump from the undisturbed thermodynamic states in front of the wave to the final thermodynamic states behind the wave.

A propagating disturbance of this type,  which generates a discontinuous change in pressure, temperature, enthalpy, internal energy, density and particle velocity is referred to as a shock wave.  A shock-wave is depicted schematically in the following figure:

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Basic_Shock_Sketch.png|350px]]&lt;/center&gt;

A shock-wave can ultimately be interpreted as a transverse mechanical wave with an undefinable pulse wavelength that discontinuously changes the state of the medium at a propagation velocity greatly exceeding the sound speed of the medium.

==Shock Formation and Attenuation==

===&quot;Shocking Up&quot;===
It is most intuitive to consider how a shock wave is formed by considering the process in an elastic solid as the behaviour can then be extended in principle to fluids.  For a linear-elastic material, behaviour under compressive loading can be broadly described by two regimes.  In the elastic regime the deformation (strain) is directly proportional to the stress applied to it.  Above a certain critical stress level (termed the yield stress) the strain is no longer directly proportional to the stress and the material begins to behave nonlinearly - this is the plastic regime.


If we define the sound speed in the material as:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;C^2=\frac{\partial P}{\partial \rho}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


It is clear that in the elastic regime pressure and density are linearly related and thus the speed of propagation of a wave is constant if their pressure amplitudes are below the yield stress of the material.  However, consider a wave whose amplitude is in the regime of pressure beyond the yield strength as depicted in the following figure:


&lt;center&gt;[[Image:stressstrainVSwave.png|550px]]&lt;/center&gt;


Since the pressure amplitudes are past the regime of linear proportionality between stress and strain the wave speed is no longer constant.  By consulting the stress-strain curve it is apparent that wave velocity increases with increasing pressure beyond the elastic limit.  Consequently, point C of the waveform will have the lowest local wave speed while points B and A will have consecutively increasing wave speeds.  As a result the highest pressure parts of the waveform travel faster than the lower parts and must eventually overtake them.  A time lapse of this process is depicted as follows:


&lt;center&gt;[[Image:ShockingUp.png|550px]]&lt;/center&gt;

As the smooth wave pulse propagates through the material the instantaneously faster parts of the wave overtake the slower ones and the pulse itself becomes increasingly steep until it adopts the familiar, discontinuous profile associated with a shock-wave.  Consequently any wave with pressure amplitudes greater than the yield strength of the material will eventually &quot;shock-up&quot; and become discontinuous due to the non-linear increase in wave speed with increasing pressure.

It is tempting to assume that if we were to play the evolution of the shock-wave even further in time, the top of the vertical line would continue to outpace the bottom and the shock wave front would become sloped.  This does not happen in reality due to a competing wave process that serves to attenuate the shock.

===Shock Rarefaction===

Once a shock-wave has established itself in a material it cannot propagate indefinitely unless it is either driven mechanically via a piston or self supported via coupled chemical reaction in a detonation wave.  It will be shown that the attenuation and eventual dissipation of a shock wave is also the natural result of the non-linear relation between pressure, density and wave speed above the elastic limit.

Consider the following square pulse shock wave:


&lt;center&gt;[[Image:ShockPulse.png|350px]]&lt;/center&gt;

Examine point A':  It is moving into un-shocked material with wave speed &lt;math&gt;C_{0}&lt;/math&gt; and associated particle speed &lt;math&gt;\nu_{0}&lt;/math&gt;.  In contrast, point A is moving into already shocked material at significantly higher pressure and density and thus with higher particle velocity, &lt;math&gt;\nu_{A'}&lt;/math&gt; and wave speeds &lt;math&gt;C_{A'}&lt;/math&gt;.  Consequently, point A will be moving significantly faster than point A' and will soon overtake the front.  Now examine point C.  It has been relieved down to ambient conditions and thus has a low associated wave speed.  It will thus lag progressively further and further behind point A.  As the shock-wave wave propagates, the line A-C will stretch out and thus angle down.  This can be see as an averaging out of the shock pulse amplitude over a larger and large front thickness. This averaging serves to attenuate the pulse until the pressure decays below the elastic limit and the shock-wave devolves into an acoustic wave.  The line A-C is in fact a wave process with a propagation velocity faster than that of the shock front.  Such a wave is known as a rarefaction and it is a fundamental characteristic of shock-wave processes.  The rarefaction attenuation process is depicted in the following figure:

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:ShockAttenuation.png|350]]&lt;/center&gt;

==Shock Description via the Method of Characteristics==

While the previous discussion is extremely intuitive in understanding shock behaviour, all of these results can be obtained directly via mathematical solution of the non-linear wave equations through the [[w:method of characteristics|method of characteristics]] and Riemann Invariants.  The method of characteristics is a technique for solving [[w:partial differential equations|partial differential equations]] by reducing the PDE to a set of ordinary differential equations through the parametrization of the existing coordinate system into a new system where properties of the PDE remain constant over curves in the new system.  The contours revealed during this method are called characteristics.

Consider the basic set of nonlinear-elastic wave equations:

:&lt;math&gt;\ \epsilon = \frac{\rho_0}{\rho}&lt;/math&gt;   strain-density relation

:&lt;math&gt;\ \sigma = \sigma (\epsilon)&lt;/math&gt;       constitutive equation

:&lt;math&gt;\ \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nu \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial x} +\rho \frac{\partial \nu}{\partial t} = 0 &lt;/math&gt; conservation of mass

:&lt;math&gt;\ \rho \left(\frac{\partial \nu}{\partial t} + \nu \frac{\partial \nu}{\partial x}\right) = \frac{\partial \sigma}{\partial x}&lt;/math&gt;    conservation of momentum


And characteristic coordinates:

:&lt;math&gt;\ \xi = \xi(x,t)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\ \zeta = \zeta(x,t)&lt;/math&gt;


Subject to the constraints where &lt;math&gt;\ x = x(X,t)&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\ \frac{\partial \zeta}{\partial t} = C\frac{\partial \zeta}{\partial X}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\ \frac{\partial \xi}{\partial t} = -C\frac{\partial \xi}{\partial X}&lt;/math&gt;


Where we define:

:&lt;math&gt;\ C = \left( \frac{1}{\rho_{0}} \frac {d \sigma}{d \epsilon} \right)^{ \frac{1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that here we have effectively employed the expression for wave speed as a function of pressure and density!



Yielding the constraint equations:

:&lt;math&gt;\ \frac{\partial \zeta}{\partial t} = (C \epsilon - \nu)\frac{\partial \zeta}{\partial x}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\ \frac{\partial \xi}{\partial t} = -(C\epsilon + \nu)\frac{\partial \xi}{\partial x}&lt;/math&gt;

Combining the constraint equations with the differentials &lt;math&gt;d \zeta = \frac{\partial \zeta}{\partial x}dx + \frac{\partial \zeta} {\partial t}d t &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d \xi = \frac{\partial \xi}{\partial x}dx + \frac{\partial \xi}{\partial t}  d t&lt;/math&gt; yields :

:&lt;math&gt;d \zeta = \frac{\partial \zeta}{\partial x} [dx - (\nu - C \epsilon)dt]&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;d \xi = \frac{\partial \xi}{\partial x} [dx - (\nu + C \epsilon)dt]&lt;/math&gt;

These equations then yield the slopes of the contours of the new coordinate system:

:&lt;math&gt; \ \frac{d x}{d t} = \nu + C\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;\ d \xi = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \ \frac{d x}{d t} = \nu - C\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;\ d \zeta = 0&lt;/math&gt;

We must now apply these relations to transform the expression of the wave equations from &lt;math&gt;\ (x , t)&lt;/math&gt;  space into &lt;math&gt;\ (\zeta , \xi)&lt;/math&gt; space.  Take the time derivative of constitutive equation and substitute the slope of the characteristic lines to obtain:

:&lt;math&gt;\ \frac{\partial \sigma}{\partial x} = - (C \epsilon)^{2}\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial x}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ \frac{\partial \sigma}{\partial t} = - (C \epsilon)^{2}\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial y}&lt;/math&gt;

For simplicity make the substitution &lt;math&gt;\ c = C \epsilon &lt;/math&gt;

Substitution into the conservation of mass and momentum equations yields:
:&lt;math&gt;\ \frac{\partial \sigma}{\partial t} +\nu \frac{\partial \sigma}{\partial x} = \rho c^{2} \frac{\partial \nu}{\partial x}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial \nu}{\partial t} + \nu \frac{\partial \nu}{\partial x} = \frac{1}{\rho} \frac{\partial \sigma}{\partial x}&lt;/math&gt;

These can be combined and solved via partial derivative chain rule expansion to yield:

:&lt;math&gt;\ \frac{\partial \nu '}{\partial \zeta} = \frac{1}{\rho c}\frac{\partial \sigma '}{\partial \zeta '}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ \frac{\partial \nu '}{\partial \xi} = -\frac{1}{\rho c}\frac{\partial \sigma '}{\partial \xi '}&lt;/math&gt;

These are the characteristic equations in &lt;math&gt;\zeta &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; space.

In order to solve for the characteristic contours we must integrate from some reference to a final state with reference to the invariants, thus:

:&lt;math&gt;\ J_{+}(\xi) = \nu - \nu^{0} - \int_1^\epsilon{C(\epsilon)\,d\epsilon}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ J_{-}(\zeta)= \nu - \nu^{0} + \int_1^\epsilon{C(\epsilon)\,d\epsilon}&lt;/math&gt;

These two equations represent the Riemann invariants for the wave system.  They can be combined to yield the characteristic equations for which the combination of stress and particle velocity does not change as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\ \nu - \nu^{0} = \frac{1}{2}(J_{+}(\xi) +J_{-}(\zeta))&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ \int_1^\epsilon{C(\epsilon)\,d\epsilon} = \frac{1}{2}(-J_{+}(\xi) + J_{-}(\zeta))&lt;/math&gt;



===Simple Wave Solution===

A simple wave is a solution to the wave equations in characteristic space for which one of the invariants is constant.  Consider a non-linear wave where we set:

:&lt;math&gt;\ J_{-}(\zeta) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

This yields stress, strain, particle velocity, and sound speeds that are solely a function of &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt;.  From the slopes of the coordinate contours derived previously we obtain:

:&lt;math&gt;\ \frac{d X}{dt} = \nu(\xi^{i})+c(\xi^{i})&lt;/math&gt;

Integration of these contours directly yields :

:&lt;math&gt;\ \xi = t - \frac{x}{\nu(\xi)+c(\xi)}&lt;/math&gt;

Consequently the simple wave solution of the non linear equations in characteristic space can described as a transformation of a specified transversely moving pulse into a collection of straight line characteristics with differing slopes.  Each line can be interpreted as the x-t history of one specific point on the pulse.

If we compute the Riemann integrals:

:&lt;math&gt;\ \nu - \nu^{0} = \frac{1}{2}J_{+}\left[ t-\frac{x}{\nu+c}\right]&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ \int_1^\epsilon{C(\epsilon)\,d\epsilon} = -\frac{1}{2}J_{+}\left[ t-\frac{x}{\nu+c}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

We obtain the important result:

:&lt;math&gt;\ \frac{d(v+c)}{d\epsilon} \le 0 &lt;/math&gt;


This inequality mathematically substantiates our previous statement that wave speed increases with increasing pressure in the non-linear (plastic) regime and illustrates an important concept: the wave speed is equal to the sum of the particle velocity and the sound speed.  

The relation between simple wave solutions in characteristic space can be linked to the formation of shock waves through the concept that characteristics with varying slopes must eventually intersect at some point in time.

===Shocks From Waves===

It can be shown mathematically that the point of intersection of the contours of a non-linear wave is a mathematical discontinuity, thereby recovering our concept that shock-waves are state discontinuities

For simplicity sake consider a wave that is a ramp of particle velocity with respect to position - this is analogous our previous qualitative example from the first section but with particle velocity plotted instead of pressure (where the two are related).  The equation describing this ramp is:

&lt;math&gt;\ \nu = -mx&lt;/math&gt;

Applying our solution for the characteristics of a simple wave we obtain:

&lt;math&gt;\ \nu = m[(\nu+c)t -x]&lt;/math&gt;

In order to make this solution tractable we must employ an equation of state to mathematically link the wave velocity and particle speeds.  Since we have not specified the material in question it is expedient to simply assume that the relationship is linear, thus:

:&lt;math&gt;\ c = \lambda u + c_{0}&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting this into our relationship we obtain for velocity:

:&lt;math&gt; \nu = \frac{m(c_{0}t-x)}{1-\lambda m t}&lt;/math&gt;

Clearly when &lt;math&gt; t = \frac{1}{\lambda m}&lt;/math&gt;, the value for the particle velocity is undefined and the simple wave solution breaks down and we have a shock-wave formed.  However, when &lt;math&gt;m &lt;/math&gt; is negative, the value of &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; never tends to infinity and we have a rarefaction wave.  If we plot the position history of one point at the bottom of the ramp (corresponding to the point C in our previous discussion) and one point at the top of our ramp (corresponding to point A) on an x-t diagram we can visualize how these characteristics behave:

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:XTShockvsRare.png|700px]]&lt;/center&gt;

It is important to note that our mathematical and conceptual discussions have ultimately yielded analogous descriptions of shock-wave formation and behaviour.  In the mathematical discussion we can see that each characteristic corresponds to trajectory of a specific point on the waveform depicted in either &lt;math&gt;(P,x)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;(P,t)&lt;/math&gt; space.  The history of these characteristics tracks how specific portions of the waveform overtake or lag behind the others.  In the case of a set of converging characteristics the point of intersection corresponds to a mathematical singularity and the formation of a shockwave.  In the case of diverging characteristics we can see that the waveform points begin smearing out in space - this is clearly analogous to the description of rarefaction waves.

===Strong and Weak Shocks===

In the context of the method of characteristics a shock-wave is any discontinuity produced by the convergence of characteristic lines.  A distinction is made between two types of shock solutions depending on how they affect the locus of thermodynamic states.  A weak shock is define as the case when the change between final and reference states is nearly identical to that of the equivalent simple, characteristically convergent wave.  In this case the process by which the change in states is effected is isentropic and the path through which the material is loaded from the reference state to the final state is described by the isentrope.

Conversely a strong shock is the discontinuous solution for which the locus of all possible states does not coincide with the isentrope but rather a different loading path.

This discussion of state loci will become more clear with the introduction of the Hugoniot.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Conservation Equations and Derivation==

For the purpose of performing engineering calculations, equations linking the pre- and post- shock states are required.  One of the most fundamental expressions relating states is the &lt;math&gt;(P,\rho)&lt;/math&gt; Hugoniot which relates pressure and density as:

&lt;math&gt;\ P = f(\rho)&lt;/math&gt;

This expression can be derived via simplification of the canonical conservation equations:

Conservation of mass:
:&lt;math&gt;\rho_1 \nu_1=\rho_o \nu_o\,&lt;/math&gt;

Conservation of momentum:
:&lt;math&gt;p_1+\rho_1\nu_1^2=p_o+\rho_o \nu_o^2&lt;/math&gt;

Conservation of energy:
:&lt;math&gt;e_1+\frac{p_1}{\rho_1}+\frac{1}{2}\nu_{1}^2=e_o+\frac{p_o}{\rho_o}+\frac{1}{2}\nu_{o}^2&lt;/math&gt;

The parameters of a shock required to completely solve for the jump conditions are pressure, particle velocity,specific internal energy,density and shock speed.  With 4 state variables and only 3 equations an additional equation is required to relate some of the states and make the problem tractable.  This equation is referred to as an equation of state (EOS) - of which many exist for a variety of applications.  The most common EOS is the ideal gas law and can be used to reduce the system of equations to the familiar Hugoniot expression for fluids with constant specific heats in steady flow:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{p_1}{p_2}=
\frac{(\gamma+1)-(\gamma-1)\frac{\rho_2}{\rho_1}}
{(\gamma+1)\frac{\rho_2}{\rho_1}-(\gamma-1)}
&lt;/math&gt;

For general, non-linear elastic materials there exists no equation of state that can be derived from first principles.  However, a huge database of experimental data has revealed that virtually all materials display a linear relationship between particle velocity and shock speed (the voracity of the linear assumption in the method of characteristics example is now even more clear!):


:&lt;math&gt;\ U = C_{o} + s\nu&lt;/math&gt;

This equation is also known as the shock Hugoniot in the &lt;math&gt; U-\nu&lt;/math&gt; plane.

Combination of this linear relation with the momentum and mass equations yields the desired expression for the Hugoniot in the &lt;math&gt; P-\rho&lt;/math&gt; plane for virtually all solid materials:

&lt;math&gt;\ P = C_{o}^2\frac{\frac{1}{\rho_{0}}-\frac{1}{\rho}}{\left(\frac{1}{\rho_{0}}-\frac{s}{\rho}\right)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

==Paths and Jump Conditions==

The Hugoniot describes the locus of all possible thermodynamic states a material can exist in behind a shock, projected onto a two dimensional state-state plane.  It is therefore a set of equilibrium states and does not specifically represent the path through which a material undergoes transformation.

Consider again our discussion of strong and weak shocks.  It was said that weak shocks are isentropic and that the isentrope represents the path through which the material is loaded from the initial to final states by an equivalent wave with converging characteristics (termed a compression wave).  In the case of weak shocks, the Hugoniot will therefore fall directly on the isentrope and can be used directly as the equivalent path.

In the case of a strong shock we can no longer make that simplification directly, howevewer for engineering calculations it is deemed that the isentrope is close enough to the Hugoniot that the same assumption can be made.

If the Hugoniot is approximately the loading path between states for an &quot;equivalent&quot; compression wave, then the jump conditions for the shock loading path can be determined by drawing a straight line between the initial and final states.  This line is called the Rayleigh line and has the following equation:

&lt;math&gt;\ P_1 - P_0 = U^2\left(\rho_0 - \frac{\rho_0^2}{\rho_1}\right)&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;center&gt;[[Image:HugoniotRaleigh.png|350px]]&lt;/center&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|What are the standards for mobile technology?}}

When Motorola and Bell operated the first commercial mobile telephone service MTS in the US in 1946, nobody had expected that the mobile technology would boom so rapidly during the past 60 years. Nowadays, people would rather carry one simple fancy device during travel, such as iPhone, for talking, web surfing, business meeting, and mobile working than carrying a laptop, a PDA, a phone, and a pager.

What happened in the mobile society? The key technology improvement is the communication standard. Mobile technology has experienced five generations since it was first introduced. The overall trend of the technical standard is to make it faster, have more bandwidth, and to be more unified. 

==Historical Development==
'''Pre cellular system''' is the predecessor to the first generation of cellular telephones, hence it is sometimes referred to as 0G. Technologies used in pre cellular systems included the Push to Talk (PTT or manual), Mobile Telephone System (MTS), Improved Mobile Telephone Service (IMTS), and Advanced Mobile Telephone System (AMTS) systems.

'''First generation''' system was first introduced in US during 1980’s. It was implemented through analog signal and was considered as luxury goods for seldom people at that time.  The standards of 1G includes NMT (Nordic Mobile Telephone), AMPS (Advanced Mobile Phone System), TACS (Total Access Communications System), C-450, Radiocom 2000, and RTMI. Theses standards were launched and used by different countries in Europe and North American. In Asia, the most advanced standards were launched in Japan, such as TZ-801, TZ-802, TZ-803, and JTACS standard.

'''Second generation''' standard was first commercially launched on GSM by Radiolinja in Finland in 1991. It was the first digitally encrypted standard, and was significantly more efficient on the spectrum allowing for far greater mobile phone penetration levels. Furthermore, 2G introduced data services for mobile, starting with SMS text messages. 2G technologies can be divided into TDMA-based and CDMA-based standards depending on the type of multiplexing used. The main TDMA-based 2G standards include GSM, mainly in Europe; PDC, exclusively in Japan; and iDEN, proprietary network used in North American. The CDMA-based standard IS-95, used in the Americas and parts of Asia. 

'''Second and half generation''' mobile system is a standard between 2G and 3G mobile technology. It improves from circuit switched domain to packet switched domain. It is not necessarily faster then 2G because bundling of timeslots is used for circuit switched data services (HSCSD) as well. The 2G standard includes GPRS,  HSCSD, and WiDEN.

'''2.75 generation''' mobile technology, usually known as Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE), Enhanced GPRS (EGPRS), or IMT Single Carrier (IMT-SC), is an extension of GSM standard. It allows improved data transmission rates by switching to more sophisticated methods of coding, within existing GSM timeslots. It is very close to the 3G technology. 

'''Third generation''' technology has been discussed for many years. It is first introduced by ITU (International Telecommunication Union) in 1985 and was first launched in 2001. 3G standard enable wider range of more advanced services with greater network capacity through improved spectral efficiency. Services include wide-area wireless voice telephony, audio and video signals all in a mobile environment. The data transmission rate in 3G is up to 14.4Mbit/s on the downlink and 5.8Mbit/s on the uplink. The most accepted standards of 3G are W-CDMA, CDMA2000, and TD-SCDMA. 

'''Three and half generation''' refers to the mobile standard of High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA). It provides variable spreading factor and fast power control. Instead, it delivers the improved downlink performance using adaptive modulation and coding (AMC), fast packet scheduling at the base station, and fast retransmissions from the base station, known as hybrid automatic repeat-request (HARQ).

'''3.75 generation''' extended the mobile technology from 3.5G by improving the High Speed Uplink Packet Access (HSUPA). It allows up-link speeds up to 5.76Mbps. HSUPA uses a packet scheduler, but operates on a request-grant principle where the users request a permission to send data and the scheduler decides when and how many users will be allowed to do so. However, HSUPA also allows a self-initiated transmission mode from the users, denoted non-scheduled mode. The non-scheduled mode can, for example, be used for VoIP services which can provides the very short delay time and constant bandwidth requirement.

The '''fourth generation''' mobile technology is supposed to provide such a comprehensive solution with higher data rates than any of the previous generations. Although there is no formal definition for 4G yet, the objectives of 4G is quite clear. It includes a fully IP-based integrated system, so that it can support up to 100Mbps and 1Gbps speeds as ADLS network, for both indoors and outdoors, stable and highly mobile environment. Many companies have launched their pre-4G standards such as WiMAX, Flash-OFDM, 3GPP Long Term Evolution, UMB, and IEEE 802.20.

:I wanted to inform you, that I tagged [[Special:ListFiles/Calibuon|all files you uploaded]] since a) you never provided a source, b) although the template {{tl|PD-user}} says that you created them, I highly doubt this since there are simply too many different kind of file formats used, too many different 'styles', some images look like stolen from a book and others are simply paint images: simply too many quality differences that I can believe that you created all images.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Glycoproteins==
[[File:Glicoprotein.svg|right|thumb|Glycoprotein or Oligosaccharide attached protein]]
After post translation, [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins|proteins]] can be further modified by being attached to [[Structural Biochemistry/Carbohydrates|carbohydrate]] groups (sugars) by glycosidic bonds via the process called &quot;'''glycosylation'''&quot;, and the newly formed molecule is called a &quot;'''glycoprotein'''&quot;. There are two types of glycosidic bonds that can occur in this process, called N-linkage and O-linkage.  
'''''N-linkage''':'' The nitrogen atom in the side chain of Asparagine is attached to the sugar. The sequence can be Asn-X-Ser or Asn-X-Thr, where X is any kind of animo acid except prolin. 
'''''O-linkage''''': The oxygen atom in the side chain of serine or threonine amino acids is attached to the sugar.
Most cells secrete proteins, and this makes the protein glycosylated. The glycosylated proteins are mostly found in the blood serum. Being one of the components in the cell [[Structural Biochemistry/Lipids/Biological Membranes|membrane]], they are responsible for combining cells or even combining sperm and eggs.[[File:N-linked glycosidic bond.png|left|250px]][[File:O-linked glycosidic bond.png|center|250px]]

==Protein Glycosylation==
Protein glycosylation is an enzyme-directed chemical reaction that takes place in the [[Structural Biochemistry/Cell Organelles/Endoplasmic Reticulum|ER]](Endoplasmic Reticulum) and in the [[Structural Biochemistry/Cell Organelles/Golgi Apparatus|Golgi Apparatus]] body of the cell.{{ref|Biochemistry}} General glycosylation within the ER helps with folding, and glycosylation in the Golgi body tells a protein where to go. The ribosomes sticking on the cytoplasmic surface of the ER membrane synthesize the protein. The peptide chain is then sent into the lumen of the ER. There are N-linked and O-linked glycosylation processes. This is determined by whether the sugars in glycoproteins are attached to the amide nitrogen on the amino acid asparagine, or to the oxygen on the side chains of either serine or threonine. The N-linkage glycosylations happens in both ER and in the Golgi complex while the O-linked glycosylation only occurs in the Golgi complex. In the Golgi complex, the glycosylated proteins derive the carbohydrates out, which change their shape to keep working in the Golgi complex. Proteins derived from the glycoproteins diffuse into vesicles and are transported into different places according to the signals instructed by the [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Amino Acids|amino acid]] sequence and the three-dimensional structures. 

N-linked glycosylation mostly takes place in eukaryotes and archaea, but rarely in bacteria. When a 14-sugar chain, including 2 N-acetylglucosamine molecules, 3 glucose, and 9 mannose, is attached to the asparagine amino acid in the target protein, dolichol molecle is carried by reaction and sent into the ER lumen. There are two kinds of N-linked oligosaccarides: High-mannose oligosaccharides, and complex oligosaccharides. High-mannose oligosaccharides is a combination of the 2 N-acetylglucosamine molecules and many numbers of mannose residues attached. This is the most common chain. The complex oligosaccharides is the combination of any number and of any kinds of saccharides attaching together. The modification of both two types depends on the accessibility of the modified proteins in the Golgi complex. If the oligosaccharides are not accessible, then the high-mannose will not be cleaved for further modification. 

The cytoplasm is not a place for protein glycosylation, because sugars and complex enzymes are stored in the lumenal side of the ER, so the proteins are not glycosylated as they are above.

===Significance of Protein Glycosylation===
Glycosylation can avoid the incorrect folding of the original proteins. Many proteins do not fold correctly unless they undergo glycosylation. It also increases the stability of the protein structures in blood so that they will not degrade as quickly as those unglycosylated proteins. For example, glycoproteins linked at the amide nitrogen in asparagine in the protein have increased stability. N-linked glycosylation of this sort occurs when the protein sequence Asp-X-Thr or Asp-X-Ser is reached. X, in this case can be any amino acid except for proline. Glycosylation helps to adhere between cells. This mechanism of cell to cell adhesion is especially vital in cells of the immune system. {{ref|Glycosylation}}

===Disease Caused by Incorrect Glycosylation===
Congenital disorders of Glycosylation is a type of disease caused by incorrect glycosylation. I-cell disease is an example of such congenital disorders. The lysosomes include undigested glycosaminoglycans and glycolipids because the responsible enzymes containing a mannose residue are missed to degrade them. In other words, the mannose residues are not being modified in the enzymes so that they cannot degrade the glycosaminoglycan and glycolipids. Urine and blood also contain high level of such enzymes. Because of this mistake, the carbohydrates and the glycosaminoglycans will accumulate more and more and finally cause patients in a pathological condition.

==Glycosylation Influences on Protein Folding==

Glycosylation is a posttranslational modification to proteins which influences the tertiary structure based on the placement of glycols on the protein and the timing in the folding process when the glycols get introduced. &quot;The magnitude of thermodynamic protein stabilization by glycosylation depends on the properties of both the carbohydrate and the protein moieties.&quot;{{ref|Sciencedirect}} Glycosylation stabilization is dependent on the position of the glycol in the protein. Also, it is shown that the size of the oligosaccharide is not as important of a factor on the outcome in the protein structure as the properties of the oligosaccharide attached to the protein. In highly structured regions of proteins glycolysation destabilizes the section and in highly flexible regions the glycol stabilizes the region. Furthermore the glycols either keep areas expanded if they are added before protein folding commences or compact the size of the overall protein if added at a later time int he protein folding sequence. Glycolysation often results in reduced flexibility of the folded protein. The stabilization conferred by glycolysation is similar to that of molecular crowding and confinement yet has little influence on the folding transition temperature when compared to these other effects. However, it is hypothesized that the stabilization by glycolysation increases in crowded molecular environments, but this has yet to be tested. {{ref|Sciencedirect}}

==Erythropoietin (EPO)==

An example of a glycoprotein that has provided much effect in the medical field is Erythropoietin also known as EPO. This glycoprotein has improved the treatment for anemia particularly induced by cancer chemotherapy. It is secreted by the kidneys and stimulates the production of red blood cells. EPO is made of 165 amino acid. It is N-glycoslyated at the asparagine residue and O-glycosylated on a serine residue. It is 40% carbohydrate by weight. The glycoslyation enhances stability of the protein in the blood as compared to the unglycoslyated protein which only carries about 10% of the bioactivity. This is because protein is rapidly removed from the blood by the kidney. Although recombinant human EPO has aided the treatment of anemia it has also been misused by athletes to increase their red blood cell count and their oxygen carrying capacity. However modern drug testing can usually distinguish between this and natural EPO.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==General Information==
Artificial chromosomes are synthetic chromosomes consisting of fragments of DNA integrated into a host chromosome. These artificial chromosomes are introduced into host cells to propagate and can be used to transfect other cells, introducing new DNA. Artificial chromosomes are useful in cloning larger fragments of DNA, as plasmids can only contain up to 10,000 base pairs and phages are hard to work with. Artificial chromosomes can contain anywhere from 300,000(BAC) to 1,000,000(YAC) base pairs, effectively reducing the amount of runs needed for a large fragment to be analyzed. Because these chromosomes are more useful in cloning larger fragments of DNA, it is easier and quicker to clone and transform genes. Artificial chromosome vectors also make it easier to store through bacterial cells rather than mammalian cells.

There are two types of artificial chromosomes: Bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) and yeast artificial chromosomes (YAC). Although yeast artificial chromosomes can contain more base pairs (over one million) than bacterial artificial chromosomes, bacterial artificial chromosomes are more common than yeast artificial chromosomes because they are more stable, making them easier to work with a smaller risk of rearrangement due to the circular shape  of a plasmid. Yeast artificial chromosomes also may produce chimeric effects, while bacteria artificial chromosomes will not.

The usage of artificial chromosomes is mainly for studying DNA fragments. This is done by integrating a non-viral/non-bacterial DNA into a bacterial chromosome and having it express the DNA fragment within the host. Once expressed, the host cell undergoes replication and thus the host chromosome containing the integrated DNA fragment will be replicated. The result is a huge colony of bacteria containing the fragmented DNA. In other words the DNA is cloned into millions of copies. The use of artificial chromosomes has revolutionized every aspect of biological studies.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Yeast Artificial Chromosomes (YAC)==
Similar to bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs), yeast chromosomes can used as host chromosomes in the process of DNA cloning Like BACs, YACs (yeast artificial chromosomes) are synthetic chromosomes with integrated DNA fragments from a foreign source. The difference between YACs and BACs is that YACs does not use a plasmid such as the F factor in E.Coli. Instead YACs use specific regions of the yeast chromosome. The yeast chromsomes contain all the necessary parts for replication which includes the following: a centromere, telomere ends, DNA site markers, restriction enzymes EcoRI and BamHI and the origin of replication. With the mentioned components, a foreign fragment of DNA can be spliced into any regions between the telomeres and centromeres. A DNA fragment is spliced by using restriction enzyme EcoRI.The cleaved DNA fragment can range from 100 to 1000kb, thus YACs allow for the insertion of larger DNA sequences which can result in greater efficiency. After the DNA fragment is cleaved, the yeast artificial chromosomes are also digested by the two restriction enzymes; EcoRI and BamHI. The fragments are then recombined at the EcoRI sites and are joined together by DNA ligase resulting in a new chromosome with the inserted DNA fragment.Once the foreign DNA fragment is spliced into the yeast chromosome, replication of DNA begins as DNA polymerase begin to elongate the DNA strand at the origin of replication site during cell division/replication by mitosis. When the host chromosome is elongated, the foreign DNA fragments get elongated along with the host chromosome. The result of this method is similar to using BACs, which is a huge colony of yeast cells with the fragmented DNA. The cloned fragments of DNA in the yeast chromosomes can then be used for genetic research such as gene mapping or simply put into a gene library for further use.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Fluid Mosaic Model ==
The fluid mosaic model is used to describe the interactions of lipids and proteins in biological membranes.  This model essentially proclaims the concept of lateral diffusion, stating that proteins can freely move about within a membrane and that such membranes are considered to effectively be two-dimensional.  The fluid mosaic model of biological membranes are always fluctuating and adjusting.
In 1972, the fluid mosaic model was introduced by S. Jonathan Singer and Garth Nicholson.&lt;ref name=&quot;References-Lehninger&quot;&gt;Nelson, David L, Michael M. Cox. Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry ''Fourth Edition''. New York: W.H. Freeman, and Company 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fluid mosaic model of membranes states that membrane components are free to diffuse in the plane of the membrane. Some of the membrane proteins are restricted to specific regions of the membrane by interactions with cytoskeletal proteins. Also, although many phospholipids and membrane proteins can move laterally within a leaflet, they do not flip-flop from one leaflet of the bilayer to the other. Flip-flop of the phospholipids is very rare. The inner and the outer leaflets of the membrane may be made up of different phospholipids. Anyways, the membrane fluidity refers to the movement of membrane phospholipids within the plane of the membrane. A decrease in fluidity is associated with decreased transport rates. The length of the fatty acid side chains also affects fluidity. The phospholipids with long hydrocarbon chains have increased hydrophobic interactions with neighboring lipids and thus decreased membrane fluidity. [Microbiology]

Some organisms can alter membrane fluidity in response to temperature stress by changing the length and degree of saturation of fatty acids present in membrane phospholipids. Cholesterol also influence membrane fluidity. The effects of cholesterol on membrane fluidity are complicated and depend on factors such as the ratio of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids in the membrane. The cholesterol also prevents packing of saturated fatty acids, thus increasing fluidity. 

Proposed by S.J. Singer and Garth L. Nicholson in 1972, the fluid mosaic model provides a reasonable structure and image of the biological membranes in general. One of the most important features of this model is the idea that the phospholipid bilayer is fluid. The phospholipid molecule are free to move laterally. Relative to the lateral movement of the phospholipid molecules, there is very little exchange between the two halves of the bilayer. This minimal exchange, or flip flop action, allows asymmetric distribution of phospholipids. This asymmetry is an important feature of membranes. Membrane surfaces exhibit asymmetry. In other words, they have different characteristics on the two sides. These structural differences support the functional differences of the inner and outer sides of the membrane. For example, one of the most important functions of the outer surface of the membrane lies in its interaction and communication with other cells. This is often achieved by sugar molecules almost exclusively found on the outer surface that acts as distinguishing markers for the cell. The interior, on the other hand, serves different functions, and therefore has a different composition. In this model, the membrane is a mosaic of proteins embedded in a fluid phospholipid bilayer. The hydrophilic portions of the phospholipid and proteins are maximally exposed to aqueous interface. This feature ensures membrane stability. The fluidity of the molecule is affected by several factors. These include the type of lipid found in the membrane and the degree of unsaturation in the [[Structural Biochemistry/Lipids/Fatty Acids|fatty acid]] chains of [[Structural Biochemistry/Lipids/Membrane Lipids|membrane lipids]]. The presence of a ''cis'' double bond introduces a kink into the fatty acid chain, which affects the packing of the phospholipid bilayer. The kink prevents the phospholipid molecules from being packed together too tightly, and thus contributes to the [[Structural Biochemistry/Lipids/Membrane Fluidity|membrane fluidity]]. It is important to understand that in this model, both the membrane lipids and the embedded proteins are free to move. They may be mobile or fluid.

==Proof of Fluidity==
The fluid mosaic model obviously states that the lipid bilayer that surrounds the cell is fluid, flexible and always moving. In order to prove that an iconic experiment was done by taking a cell and saturating the lipid bilayer with fluorescence. After the cell was completed saturated with a green fluorescense, the cell was bleached in a single spot in the cell membrane. This created a very white spot among the green fluorescence coated cell membrane. After a short while, the bleach spot began to diminish in color and before you knew it, the area seem to be recoated with green fluorescence. The phenomenon behind this was the aspect of the cell membrane diffusing the bleached hydrophilic heads amongst the rest of the cell membrane. This diffusion allowed for the white bleach to diminish in color by being substituted by green fluorescenced hydrophilic heads. There was found to be two types of diffusion in the cell membrane, lateral diffusion and transverse diffusion. Lateral diffusion is the switching of positions in a side by side manner without any sort of flipping. This is the fastest mode of diffusion found in the cell. the second diffusion method transverse diffusion, is the flipping of the phospholipid heads to either side of the cell membrane. This method of diffusion however is less likely and happens significantly slower then lateral diffusion.

== History &amp; Development ==

Singer's studies of membranes started in the 1950s when scientists noticed that many water-soluble proteins (like those in cells) were also able to dissolve in nonpolar, nonaqueous solvents and that proteins adopted different shapes in hydrophilic vs. hydrophobic environments. Many proteins are found in environments also high in lipid content, and this prompted Singer to look into the relationship between proteins and lipid membranes.

Before Singer and Nicolson's fluid mosaic model of membranes, a triple-layered membrane model was proposed, the Davson-Danielli-Roberston (DDR) model. This model proposed a triple-layered membrane, with a lipid layer between two flat protein layers. However, when studied with respect to energetics of hydrophobic/hydrophilic interactions, this model is not feasible. Due to hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions between amino acid residues of a protein, Singer therefore proposed that membrane proteins would assume folded conformations, not remain in a flat layer like the DDR model proposed. Also in contrast to the DDR model, Singer also proposed that logically and for maximum stability membrane proteins would not be separated from the lipid bilayer but rather incorporated as part of the membrane. &lt;ref name=&quot;References&quot;&gt;Martin, Laura. The Fluid Mosaic Model of the Cell Membrane - The Mosaic. Connexions. 15 Oct. 2007 &lt;http://cnx.org/content/m15255/1.2/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; These conclusions all came together in the fluid mosaic model, where the phospholipid bilayer is a fluid matrix and both lipids and proteins are capable of lateral and rotational movement (see [[Structural Biochemistry/Lipids/Membrane Fluidity|membrane fluidity]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is a work in progress as of 12/3/08.

Assuming that the user is implementing the latest version of Antfarm, which uses postgresql database.  If you are using Antfarm that does not use postgresql database, you can use the following [[/Instructions|instructions]] to get started.

Now that you are using Antfarm with postgresql database, use the following [[/Commands|Commands]] to set up your database to be filled with good information!

'''Parsing a traceroute file using Antfarm:'''

For your traceroute file:
     1. Save your traceroute file as a .txt file (this will be referred to as &lt;traceroute filename&gt;)

NOTE: Your customized script will be automatically saved in the following location:
     .antfarm/scripts
When you run the following command at the prompt ($):
     $ antfarm
you will see the name of your customized script under &quot;custom&quot;.

Run Antfarm traceroute script on your traceroute file (do not include brackets in filenames):
     2. Run the following command at the prompt:
     $ antfarm -e &lt;[[/Commands/Environment name|environment name]]&gt; custom &lt;traceroute script filename&gt; &lt;traceroute filename&gt;

At this point, you have parsed your traceroute file (&lt;traceroute filename&gt;)using the custom traceroute script in Antfarm (&lt;traceroute script filename&gt;) and the parsed information is saved in your environment (&lt;environment name&gt;).

You can view the output on Antfarm by running the following command (3. For traffic view, 4. For network view):

     3. $ antfarm -e &lt;[[/Commands/Environment name|environment name]]&gt; viz display-traffic
     4. $ antfarm -e &lt;[[/Commands/Environment name|environment name]]&gt; viz display-networks

When displaying the traffic flow from a larger traceroute file, the visual becomes harder to read on the screen.  Luckily there is an option that will help minimize this.  The &quot;collapse-ports&quot; option allows you to only include one node for each port number discovered in the traceroute file.

     5. $ antfarm -e &lt;[[/Commands/Environment name|environment name]]&gt; viz display-traffic --collapse-ports

The latest version of Antfarm the display is static, using the command above.  If you wish to see an animated version of the display, use the following command (using display networks as an example):

     6. $ antfarm viz display-networks --active

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello, I am a bureaucrat at the English Wikibooks. You had registered the username Beano, but have made
*0 edits, and
*0 log entries.

Since you are inactive at Wikibooks, we are considering giving your username to someone else who uses that username on other wikis. To do this, we will change your username to Beano (usurped). If you return to Wikibooks you are of course welcome to change your username again to just about anything you like. We do this to allow active users to have the same username on all the wikis we operate.

If you do not want us to change your username, please respond within 7 days of this email, and we will discuss possible compromises.

Thanks

      <text xml:space="preserve">The environment name in Antfarm refers to the environment (database session) you are currently using with Antfarm.  The default environment for Antfarm is named &quot;antfarm&quot;.  However, if you want to have various environments (database sessions) that contain different information in them, you must edit the defaults.yml file.

The default defaults.yml file contains the following information initially:

     environment: antfarm
     log level: warn

To add more environments to the defaults.yml file using postgresql, add the following to the file (leaving the 1st two lines there):

     environment1 name:
       adapter: postgresql
     environment2 name:
       adapter: postgresql

and so on.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Please follow the [[WB:NC|WIkibooks naming convention]]. Specifically, chapters should be sub-pages of books.  You have been creating pages at the top-level of the Wikibooks hierarchy.  They need to be prefixed with the book name followed by a slash, a la ANTFARM/Subpage rather than just Subpage.  I have moved a few chapters already, but please don't create more work for me.  If you have questions, ask me or post in the [[Reading room]]. 

It would also help tremendously if you would register and use an account here.  Your IP address keeps changing making it difficult for me to contact you about this problem.  I already left this note on a previous talk page associated with your previous IP address.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|The demographics of mobility: are there generation and gender gaps?}}

“Laptops, cell phones, iPods and other devices have put work, socialization and entertainment on the move. In essence, our work and personal lives are increasingly characterized by mobility and intertwined with the technologies that enable it.”  With this recent ‘information era’ comes a significant amount of studies that have been conducted around the world to better understand the gender and generation gaps when concerned with the wireless world.  Upon further examination, a number of distinct gender and generation patterns came forth which persuades one to buy and make use of a particular mobile technology. 

With staggering facts such as “By the year of 2009, mobile phones annual sales will reach one billion, and 40% of the world’s population will be mobile phone users”  it is incredibly important for a technology company to understand key shopping tendencies, interests and attitudes of their target market when developing and selling a new communications device. 

==Age Differences==
In a recent survey, it was clear that young people  have different experiences with their mobile devices than do older people.   For example, 33% of young Americans post photos to websites via mobile phones and use today’s ‘information era’ as a way to make new friends and experience more social interactions whereas less than 21% of older Americans engage in such wireless experiences. “Particularly for young people, texting on mobile devices has become as natural as putting on jeans in the morning.”    The use of and interest in different mobile functions (internet/webcam/cell phone/text messaging etc…) are directly associated with the age of the user.  Studies are showing that young users are comfortable with the more simplistic features of a device (narrower scope of functions) whereas aged adults (particularly males) are reported to be quite interested in the modern technology and more complex options (contacts/blue tooth/scheduling meetings etc…) 

==Gender Differences==
In addition to age making a difference in the decisions made and usage in a mobile society, gender also plays a big role.  “Adolescent females as well as adult women are more active in sending SMS messages while the males are emitting and receiving more audio calls.”   Psychologically, it’s been said that “men seem to be faster technology adopters and have more incentive to try different new features provided.  This might be due to a difference in attitudes of men and women towards new technology.  Women tend to view technology as a tool, whereas men view it as entertainment.”  

==Conclusion==
For these reasons, it is imperative for a marketing campaign to advertise the perfect product to the right buyer.  Understanding the data that’s been collected and analyzed, the old, the young, the men and the women have very different needs and desires for their mobile devices.  Utilizing this information, technology-led markets can implement a strong, well-defined and viable marketing strategy for today’s consumer.  Keeping in mind that mobile studies will have to be on a continuous basis as there are “more than 177 million users of mobile phones, 205 million PC users and 211 million internet users in the USA alone”  and from classrooms to workplaces, future uses of mobile will play out in ways none of us would ever image!

      <comment>/* Method 2 - XQuery function */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want an easy way to format numbers by specifying the picture format of the number.  So for example if you want to format numbers with a leading dollar sign, commas and two decimal places you would use the following &quot;picture format&quot;:

&lt;pre&gt;   format-number($my-decimal, &quot;$,000.00&quot;)
&lt;/pre&gt;

If the input number was '''1234''' the output would be '''$1,234.00'''

== Method 1 - XSLT Wrapper ==
The format-number is a standard function in XSLT 1.0 and XPath 2.0.  It is also included in the draft [http://www.w3.org/TR/xquery-11-requirements/#numeric-formatting XQuery 1.1 Requirements] To use this with eXist we will just write a wrapper to the Saxon XSLT format-number() function.  To do this you will need to do the following:

# download a copy of the Saxon9B XSLT program from http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/saxon/saxonb9-1-0-2j.zip
# unzip the package and copy three jar files (saxon9.jar, saxon9-dom.jar and saxon9-xpath.jar) into your your eXist lib/endorsed folder
# comment out the following line in your eXist conf.xml file &lt;transformer class=&quot;org.apache.xalan.processor.TransformerFactoryImpl&quot;/&gt;
# un-comment the three lines that enable Saxon to be used as the default XSLT
# restart your eXist server
# add a function that will wrap a simple XSLT.  See the example code below.

=== Source Code ===
We will create an XQuery function that takes two arguments.  One decimal number and the second a string that specifies the picture format.  We will pass these both to a small XSLT stylesheet.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
(: the numeric picture format function from XPath 2.0.  To work with eXist we must enable Saxon as the default XSLT engine.  See the conf.xml file in the eXist folder for details. :)

declare function local:format-number($n as xs:decimal ,$s as xs:string) as xs:string {
    string(transform:transform(
      &lt;any/&gt;,
      &lt;xsl:stylesheet xmlns:xsl=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform&quot; version=&quot;2.0&quot;&gt;
         &lt;xsl:template match='/'&gt;
            &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;format-number({$n},'{$s}')&quot;/&gt;
         &lt;/xsl:template&gt;
      &lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;,
      ()
    ))
};
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Usage ===
The [http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt#format-number XSLT 1.0  format-number()] function takes two arguments.  The first is a decimal number and the second is a string that represents a picture of the output you desire.  The format string is defined in the Java class [http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/text/DecimalFormat.html DecimalFormat] 

If you want comma-separated values:
local:format-number($my-decimal, ',000')

If you want leading dollar signs:
local:format-number($my-decimal, '$,000')

The format of negative numbers is specified in a second picture format followed by a comma.

If you want negative numbers to have a minus sign:
local:format-number($my-decimal, '0,000.00;-0,000.00')

=== Run tests ===
[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/Test/formatnumber-xslt.xq Run]

==Method 2 - XQuery function ==

[external links broken]
Minollo posted an XQuery function in his  blog. His code passed a suite of tests.

== Test ==

[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/Test/formatnumber-xquery.xq Run tests]

== Discussion ==
It is our sincere hope that a future version of XQuery includes the functions to allow the developer to easily format both numeric and date formats.

== Reference ==
[http://www.xml-connection.com/2007/08/formatting-numbers-in-xquery-10.html Blog posting on XML Connections blog on format-number() written in XQuery]

      <text xml:space="preserve">Recently[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=JavaScript/Best_Practices&amp;curid=24776&amp;diff=1337757&amp;oldid=1274515] someone changed an example from
  &lt;a href=&quot;resumePlainVersion.html&quot; onclick=&quot;return !resumeFancyVersion()&quot;&gt;See my résumé!&lt;/a&gt;
to
  &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot; onclick=&quot;resumeFancyVersion()&quot;&gt;See my résumé!&lt;/a&gt;
.
I certainly don't deny that many web pages do, in fact, use that second form.
However, I'm reverting back to the first form.
Mainly because Matt Kruse specifically lists it[http://www.mattkruse.com/javascript/bestpractices/] as an example of &quot;What Not To Do&quot;: ''&quot;Often, links will just contain href=&quot;#&quot; ... This practice is discouraged.&quot;''

I don't know of any good reason to use that second form.
But since many web pages use it, I suppose it is possible there is such a good reason -- please tell me what it is.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|How is mobile work and life affecting office space and facilities design and management?}}

The “Next Generation Workplace” is one of the upshots of the evolution of IT, Globalization and developments in the organizational structure.  “Telecommuting” is becoming increasingly common to businesses as organizations realize the many benefits reaped from this new trend, major among them are increased productivity and huge cuts on office space expenditures.  Where IT plays a significant role in the new and increasing trend of mobile work, it has to deal with the cost of infrastructure vis-à-vis its ROI, obsolescence inherent to IT environment and continuing changes in the corporate culture resulting to the changes in the physical environment of the organization.  

==Space Reductions==
Organizational changes happen over time and in this era of globalization and IT-dominated world, the work structure; process and scope have drastically changed.  The shift to the service-oriented environment from the traditional in-house serviced companies coupled with the development of information technology initiated the “mobile work” culture.  More are adopting mobile work as it proves to be beneficial to the employer, employees and the society as well.  At the outset of this trend, huge office spaces were left unoccupied and needs to be redesigned to adapt to the new structure. Jim Brodie, IBM Canada's Toronto-based program manager of national mobility, made this discovery last year when faced with the task of reassigning 250 IBM workers into the downtown spaces — which on paper were nearing full capacity — when the lease on a third space wasn't renewed. &quot;On an average day, we've found that anywhere from 30% to 60% of our office space isn't being utilized,&quot; says Brodie. (Maureen Halushak).   As more spaces in the office become unnecessary, management’s first initiative is to reduce office space occupancy.  When this happens, significant cuts on real estate costs or leasing costs would bring favorable financial results to the company.  More so, utilities and other related maintenance costs would be positive for the company’s results of operations. A case study conducted by InnoVissions Canada cites that “AT&amp;T was able to reduce its office-space costs by 50% and has since 1995, saved $500 million in office lease costs by promoting telecommuting. (InnoVissions Canada).  

==Design Considerations==
Along with space, management goes the design of facilities to fit the organization’s overall view.  Here, the totality of the organization, its structure, focus, culture, values, vision and mission have to be taken into consideration in deciding the appropriate space and design of the facilities. However, the predicament lies on the envisioning the physical structure and infrastructure.  In many cases, organizations who attempted to reorganize their office environments failed due to lack of foresight of the company’s needs based on the organization’s overall picture.  Implementation failures do not anticipate the unique support needs of a mobile workforce relative to the organization’s structure.  As a result, administration costs related to the mobile deployment may drain the organization’s resources and may surmount the cost savings gained from trimming down space occupancy.  However, with proper matching of facility and design strategies with the overall business structure and purposes, these issues can be cleared out.  Designs and structures should support, rather than obstruct, companies in their quest to gain competitive advantage.

==Conclusion==
Despite the downside, mobile work would sure play a big role in the business world technology as survey results demonstrate that advantages surpass its disadvantages. The only impediment this move is facing is management’s resistance.  However, equipped with proper implementation approach and due diligence on the conduct of office space planning and design in line with the corporate long-term plans, telecommuting would earn more support from the global economy.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Using Wikibooks/Page}}

== The Flaggedrevs Extension ==

Wikibooks has a special software feature called '''Flagged revisions''', or '''flaggedrevs''' for short. Flaggedrevs allows users to review pages and grade them based on their quality. Readers and editors make some of the best reviewers because they see a large number of pages here on Wikibooks, while authors may tend to only see the books they are writing.

Flaggedrevs allows users with special permissions called &quot;Editor&quot; and &quot;Reviewer&quot; to review and grade pages. Editor permissions are automatically given to Wikibooks users after a certain amount of time, and after a certain amount of edits have been made. To get editor permissions earlier, or to get them if you aren't an active contributor, write a request at [[WB:RFP]]. 

There are three judging criteria in flaggedrevs: Composition, Accuracy, and Coverage. Content is the quality of the writing, Accuracy is the verifiable truth value of a page, and Coverage is the breadth and depth of the material. In each criterion there are 5 levels of quality: Poor, acceptable, good, great, featured. &quot;Featured&quot; is typically reserved for pages that are so good that other pages should use them as an example. Users with editor permissions can mark a page poor, acceptable, or good. Reviewers can mark a page as being great or featured. Because of this difference, Reviewers need to have a discerning eye for quality writing, and should probably be familiar with some of the content discussions at Wikibooks. See [[WB:FB]] and [[WB:RFD]] for examples of places where we discuss the quality of books.

== Reviewing a Page ==

Reviewing a page is easy, once you have the permissions. At the bottom of a reviewable page is a box with several controls and a {{key|name=Submit}} button in it. To review the page, set the appropriate level options in the box, and then click {{key|name=Submit}} to save it. In some situations, you may be asked to enter a comment describing why you marked a page in the way that you did.

Note that you cannot mix a &quot;poor&quot; review level with the &quot;acceptable&quot; level.  For a page to be considered stable, it must at least have an acceptable level of composition, accuracy, and coverage.   Paged that do not meet this level of criteria should be treated as drafts, where users that do not yet have editor privileges will expect their changes to be applied immediately. 

== Page Criteria ==
When reviewing a page, there are four levels describing the quality of the page. Knowing how to review a page means knowing how to judge a book using the criteria for each of the levels. The levels are more than just grades for the page, they are also a checklist that editors can follow to bring a page up to the quality seen in a featured book. If all the pages in a book are basically featured quality, the book could easily be nominated for the honor at [[WB:FB]]. Of course, having individual pages be featured book quality doesn't mean that the book itself is also featured quality. There needs to be an emergent quality to the book where pages build on each other in a logical and consistent way for the book to become featured. If the pages don't work together, the book is probably more of a macropedia than a textbook and needs additional work.

===Examining Quality===
When reviewing the basic quality of a page ask yourself, &quot;How well is it written?&quot; Wikibooks is a text-based content website, so everything we do here revolves around the quality of our writing. The Wiki process does not demand that everything be written perfectly, but that successive editors and authors can improve a page incrementally by fixing errors and omissions as they are found. Pages should aspire to be technically correct in terms of spelling and grammar, but must also have flow, consistency, and structure. Readers hate to be presented with a bland wall of text, so things like headings, lists, templates, tables, and images should be employed to break the page up into bits that a reader can easily absorb.

Well-presented information is also only as good as its accuracy. If a page is well-written and has good coverage, it's still worthless if it's untrue or misleading. Wikibooks is an educational resource, and should aspire to teach accurate information to readers. 

Even then, if the amount of material that a page actually covers, as compared to the amount of material that it ''should'' cover, is lacking, its quality may suffer. Good coverage means that a page covers all the topics that it intends to cover, and covers all of them well. Consider a page called &quot;Arithmetic&quot; that only covers addition, or a page called &quot;Animals&quot; that only covers mammals. Or, consider a stub page which only has a few short sentences about a large number of topics, without actually providing any interesting information about any of them.

The composition, accuracy, and coverage of content all need to be taken into account when reviewing.  There are four levels that [[Wikibooks:Reviewers|reviewers]] can make use of to indicate where a page stands.

===Poor/Unrated Quality===
This page either hasn't ever been reviewed, or else it has been reviewed and is ''terrible''. Spelling and grammar is off, the page has no flow and makes no sense. Accuracy of content may be poor, with the page nothing short of absurd, talking about pseudoscience, nonsense, or other garbage.  The content is untrue, misleading, and may even be dangerous to readers.  These pages are also typically incomplete stubs, that provide only a brief overview, or only contain a lot of empty sections.

===Minimal Quality===
This page uses proper spelling and grammar and is written so that other people can read and understand it.  Spelling and grammar don't need to be perfect, but it should be reasonable and easy enough for an experienced editor to clean up quickly.  Accuracy of the content may be lacking with important details missing and certain aspects  incorrect. The page will be short on examples, and short on discussion to explain things in an understandable way.  It includes the bare amount of information on the topic, and doesn't include background information, references to other topics, examples, or in-depth discussions. This page needs an author to sit down and start drafting more content as soon as possible.

===Average Quality===
Once the words are spelled correctly and the sentences are constructed properly, it's time to focus on the overall structure of the page. Ideas should flow logically from one paragraph to the next. Later topics should build on earlier topics without going on tangents or requiring prerequisite knowledge that has never been discussed. The page should be broken down into sections and subsections, and maybe use some templates and tables to include additional information.  The information it presents is not obviously incorrect, and maybe only suffers in certain details and lacks references. The page should probably include a high-level overview, some examples, some background information, and other pieces of information that readers will want.

===Good Quality===
Consistent style is the next step in page development. The page should not just be technically correct in spelling and grammar, or written with good paragraph and section structure. The page must be written in a consistent voice that properly accounts for the target audience. Wikijunior books for children should be written with high-energy and child-friendly vocabulary. Books for students, adults or professionals should all be written accordingly. To achieve this, the authors of a page should probably be familiar with pages like [[Wikibooks:Reading Levels]].  The page presents correct information, but also provides the tools to prove that the information is true. This proof can come in many ways including references to primary sources, do-it-yourself verification, or building logically on topics covered in other pages from the same book. Some books may require a certain amount of prerequisite knowledge in readers, and will take certain facts to be self-evident, so this should be considered when reviewing.  Readers should be able to read this page and get all the information that they need on the topic. The page should have lots of good examples, in-depth discussions, overviews, and background. The page should set the reader up with all the information they need on this topic throughout the rest of the book, and maybe more than that.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Guide to Unix/Commands}}

This is my own summary of useful Linux abbreviations, directories, files, and commands. I use my own annotations to recall useful options and arguments that are not necessarily documented in easy-to-find places. I quite often call up this file when I can't remember the syntax of a command that I use often (but not often enough to remember the syntax!). I also editorialize on the relative usefulness of different types of programs.

This document is work in progress. Send suggested changes and corrections to &lt;tt&gt;[mailto:ambler.steven@uqam.ca ambler.steven@uqam.ca]&lt;/tt&gt;

O'Reilly has just published online an alphabetical list of commands from ''Linux in a Nutshell''. It is available &lt;tt&gt;[http://www.onlamp.com/linux/cmd/ here]&lt;/tt&gt;. It contains more detailed explanations of many of the commands listed here.

==Shorthand at the Command Prompt ==

&lt;nowiki&gt; Some of these are specific to the bash shell. I have not experimented enough with other shells to know which are common to all shells. See also the ``Bash Reference Card'', SSC (2000), available online. &lt;/nowiki&gt;

* / - root directory
* ./ - current directory
* ./command_name - run a command in the current directory when the current directory is not on the path
* ../ - parent directory
* &lt;tt&gt;~&lt;/tt&gt; - home directory
* $ - typical prompt when logged in as ordinary user
* # - typical prompt when logged in as root or superuser
* ![string] - repeat command starting with [string]
* !?[string] - repeat command ending with [string]
* !?[string] - repeat command containing [string]
* ![number] - repeat specified command x
* !-[number] - repeat specified command x commands ago
* !! - repeat previous command
* ^[string]^[string2]^ - repeat previous command with [string2] substituted for [string] (equiv. to !!:s/string1/string2/)
* &amp; - run a program in background mode
* &lt;tt&gt;[Tab][Tab]&lt;/tt&gt; - prints a list of all available commands. This is just an example of autocomplete with no restriction on the first letter.
* &lt;nowiki&gt; x[Tab][Tab] - prints a list of all available completions for a command, where the beginning is ``x'' &lt;/nowiki&gt;
* &lt;tt&gt;[Alt][Ctrl][F1]&lt;/tt&gt; - switch to the first virtual text console from X.
* &lt;tt&gt;[Alt][Ctrl][Fn]&lt;/tt&gt; - switch to the n&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; virtual text console from X. 
* &lt;tt&gt;[Alt][Ctrl][F7]&lt;/tt&gt; - switch to the first GUI console, if there is one running, assuming that there are 6 virtual text consoles. If the graphical console freezes, one can switch to a nongraphical console, kill the process that is giving problems, and switch back to the graphical console using this shortcut.
* &lt;tt&gt;[ArrowUp]&lt;/tt&gt; - scroll through the command history (in bash)
* &lt;tt&gt;[Shift][PageUp]&lt;/tt&gt; - scroll terminal output up. This also works at the login prompt, so you can scroll through your boot messages.
* &lt;tt&gt;[Shift][PageDown]&lt;/tt&gt; - scroll terminal output down
* &lt;tt&gt;[Ctrl][Alt][+]&lt;/tt&gt; - switch to next X server resolution (if the server is set up for more than one resolution)
* &lt;tt&gt;[Ctrl][Alt][-]&lt;/tt&gt; - change to previous X server resolution
* &lt;tt&gt;[Ctrl][Alt][BkSpc]&lt;/tt&gt; - kill the current X server. Used when normal exit is not possible.
* &lt;tt&gt;[Ctrl][Alt][Del]&lt;/tt&gt; - shut down the system and reboot
* &lt;tt&gt;[Ctrl]a&lt;/tt&gt; - move cursor to beginning of line
* &lt;tt&gt;[Ctrl]c&lt;/tt&gt; - kill the current process
* &lt;tt&gt;[Ctrl]d&lt;/tt&gt; - logout from the current terminal
* &lt;tt&gt;[Ctrl]e&lt;/tt&gt; - move cursor to end of line
* &lt;tt&gt;[Ctrl]l&lt;/tt&gt; - clear screen
* &lt;tt&gt;[Ctrl]n&lt;/tt&gt; - next in history (same as down arrow)
* &lt;tt&gt;[Ctrl]p&lt;/tt&gt; - previous in history (same as up arrow)
* &lt;tt&gt;[Ctrl]q&lt;/tt&gt; - resume transfer to current terminal. This should be tried if the terminal stops responding.
* &lt;tt&gt;[Ctrl]s&lt;/tt&gt; - stop transfer to current terminal
* &lt;tt&gt;[Ctrl]u&lt;/tt&gt; - clear from cursor to beginning of line
* &lt;tt&gt;[Ctrl]y&lt;/tt&gt; - send current process to the background when it asks for input. (delayed background)
* &lt;tt&gt;[Ctrl]z&lt;/tt&gt; - send current process to the background
* reset - restore a terminal to its default settings
* &lt;tt&gt;[Leftmousebutton]&lt;/tt&gt; - Hold down left mouse button and drag to highlight text. Releasing the button copies the region to the text buffer under X and (if gpm is installed) in console mode.
* &lt;tt&gt;[Middlemousebutton]&lt;/tt&gt; - Copies text from the text buffer and inserts it at the cursor location. With a two-button mouse, click on both buttons simultaneously. It is necessary for three-button emulation to be enabled, either under gpm or in XF86Config.

==Important Daemons and Startup Services ==

These are programs or processes which are run at boot time. Some remain in memory to execute various tasks when required (daemons). Most are started and stopped with scripts in the /etc/rc.d/init.d directory (see above). The exact contents of this directory will depend on which packages from a particular distribution are installed. For example, installing the Apache package will cause an httpd script to be placed in /etc/rc.d/init.d.

There are man pages on most of these. The Red Hat program tksysv (ntsysv is the non graphical version) allows root to automatically configure which of these are started automatically at boot time. The linuxconf program does the same thing, although I haven't tried it. The utility chkconfig is also designed to query and configure runtime services for different runlevels. The &lt;tt&gt;www.mandrakeuser.org&lt;/tt&gt; site has a good page on common services/daemons, especially those included in recent versions of the Mandrake distribution.

&lt;nowiki&gt; A good source of information on daemons and services is the ``Linux Devices, Daemons, Services'' chapter of the CTDP (2000a) document. &lt;/nowiki&gt;

* amd - runs the automount daemon for remote filesystem mounting such as nfs
* anacron - checks delayed `cron' tasks (see below) at boot time and executes them. Useful if you have cron jobs scheduled but don't run your machine all the time.
* apmd - Advanced Power Management BIOS daemon. For use on machines, especially laptops, that support apm. Monitors battery status and can shut down the system if power is too low.
* arpwatch - keeps watch for ethernet IP address pairings that are resolved using the ARP protocol.
* atd - runs jobs queued by `at'
* autofs - control the operation of automount daemons, used to mount and unmount devices on demand
* bootparamd - allows computers to boot from a Linux machine using the BOOTP network protocol. A server process that provides information to diskless clients necessary for booting
* crond - automatic task scheduler. Manages the execution of tasks that are executed at regular but infrequent intervals, such as rotating log files, cleaning up /tmp directories, etc.
* cups - daemon for print services under the Common Unix Printer System, a replacement for lpd
* dhcpd - implements the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) and the Internet Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP). Used to lease out IP addresses to remote machines.
* drakfont - font server in Mandrake
* fetchmail - daemon to fetch mail at regular intervals from mail servers
* ftpd - ftp server daemon
* gated - routing daemon that handles multiple routing protocols and replaces routed and egpup
* gpm - useful mouse server for applications running on the Linux console.
* httpd - the Apache webserver hypertext transfer protocol daemon
* identd - The identd server provides a means to determine the identity of a user of a particular TCP connection. Given a TCP port number pair, it returns a character string which identifies the owner of that connection on the server's system.
* inetd - listens for service requests on network connections, particularly ''dial-in'' services. This daemon can automatically load and unload other daemons (ftpd, telnetd, etc.), thereby economizing on system resources. In the latest version of Red Hat (7.0 at the time of writing), it has been replaced by xinetd. A partial list of services controlled by inetd is listed below. Under many distributions, inetd will execute scripts in the file /etc/inetd.conf.
* innd - Usenet news server daemon
* ipchains - daemon for packet forwarding. Used for configuring a gateway/firewall.
* isdn provides ISDN network interfacing services
* isdn4linux - for users of ISDN cards
* kerneld - automatically loads and unloads kernel modules
* keytable - loads the appropriate keyboard map from /etc/sysconfig/ keyboard
* kheader -
* kudzu - detects and configures new or changed hardware during boot
* &lt;nowiki&gt; linuxconf - ``startup hook'' needed for the linuxconf system configuration tool &lt;/nowiki&gt;
* lpd - line printer and print spooler daemon
* mcserv - server program for the Midnight Commander networking file system. It provides access to the host file system to clients running the Midnight file system (currently, only the Midnight Commander file manager). If the program is run as root the program will try to get a reserved port otherwise it will use 9876 as the port. If the system has a portmapper running, then the port will be registered with the portmapper and thus clients will automatically connect to the right port. If the system does not have a portmapper, then a port should be manually specified with the -p option (see below).
* mysql - database server daemon
* named - provides DNS services
* netfs - network filesystem mounter. Used for mounting nfs, smb and ncp shares on boot.
* network -activates all network interfaces at boot time by calling scripts in /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts
* nfsd - used for exporting nfs shares when requested by remote systems
* nfslock - starts and stops nfs file locking service
* numlock - locks numlock key at init runlevel change
* pcmcia - generic services for pcmcia cards in laptops
* portmap - needed for Remote Procedure Calls
* postfix - mail transport agent which is a replacement for sendmail. Now the default on desktop installations of Mandrake.
* postgresql - database server daemon
* random - random number generating daemon, related to security and encryption
* routed - manages routing tables
* rstatd - kernel statistics server. Allows users on a network to get performance statistics for any connected machine.
* rusersd - provides services that allow users to find one another over the network
* rwalld - allows users to use rwall to write messages on remote terminals
* rwhod - server which maintains the database used by the rwho(1) and ruptime(1) programs. Its operation is predicated on the ability to broadcast messages on a network.
* sendmail - mail transfer agent. This is the agent that comes with Red Hat. Others, such as smtpd, are not included.
* smb - needed for running SAMBA
* snmpd - provides Simple Network Management Protocol support
* sound - daemon for managing sound
* squid - web page proxy server daemon
* syslogd - manages system log files
* smtpd - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, designed for the exchange of electronic mail messages. Several daemons that support SMTP are available, including sendmail, smtpd, rsmtpd, qmail, zmail, etc.
* tcpd - from the tcp_wrappers package. Intercepts requests normally handled by inetd and filters them through the files hosts.allow and hosts.deny files, which can restrict access to services based on type of service, origin of request, destination, etc. Requests are intercepted because calls to particular services are replaced with calls to tcpd in /etc/inetd.conf.
* telnetd - telnet server daemon
* usb - daemon for devices on Universal Serial Bus
* xfs - X font server
* xinetd - more modern replacement for inetd. It apparently allows for similar kinds of access filters to the ones used by tcpd in conjunction with inetd. xinetd replaces inetd as the default network services daemon in Red Hat 7.0.
* xntpd - Network Time Protocol daemon. Provides a means to synchronize time over the network.
* webmin - daemon for webmin web-based system administration program
* ypbind - NIS binder. Needed if computer is part of Network Information Service domain.

==Notes on Applications==

===Mail Transfer Agents (MTAs)===

The Linux distributions I know come with sendmail, except for Mandrake, which as of version 7.1 uses Postfix as its default MTA. There are several competing programs available. Even the simplest don't seem to be that easy to configure.

* Exim -
* Fetchmail - seemingly one of the few ways (Pine is able to do this as well) to download mail automatically from a POP or IMAP server and pass it to local mail handling agents. Use the following line in  /.fetchmailrc:
** poll pop.uqam.ca proto pop3 user USERNAME pass PASSWORD
Use the following to have fetchmail loaded as a daemon that will download mail at regular intervals:
** fetchmail -d 6000
The interval is specified in seconds. Fetchmail will poll all of the pop servers listed in  /.fetchmailrc.
* Getmail - Designed as a replacement for Fetchmail.
* MMDF -
* Postfix - a mail transport agent and potential replacement for sendmail. Mandrake 7.1 and up uses this as its default MTA.
* &lt;nowiki&gt; Qmail - a ``modern'' replacement for sendmail. It is reputed to be more secure than sendmail. Since it doesn't have a GPL license, it is not the default MTA of any Linux distributions that I know of. &lt;/nowiki&gt;
* Sendmail - this one gets my vote for the most complicated and obscure configuration file, /etc/sendmail.cf. Most individual Linux users will be using machines connected to the Internet via an ISP or on networks (such as university networks) with centralized mail processing and access to the net. I have to change the following lines in sendmail.cf to be able to send mail with emacs.
** DMuqam.ca &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;#&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; masquerade the domain name
** DNambler.steven &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;#&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; masquerade username
** DSnobel.si.uqam.ca &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;#&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; relay all mail through nobel server
&lt;nowiki&gt; The problem comes from the fact that, as a user on a local network, I don't have my own domain name. I want return mail to be routed to UQAM's mail server and I want the server to handle all my mail for me, even mail to other UQAM users. If I send mail to UQAM users using their normalized usernames, the net does not know who or where they are. I have managed to get a configuration that works by writing a sendmail.mc file and processing it with the m4 macro interpreter, following the Address-Rewriting mini-HOWTO. I now have something that works, but which mysteriously complains about ``dangerous write permissions'' every time the system boots up. &lt;/nowiki&gt;
* Smail - seems to be a popular choice on smaller systems. It would appear that at one point in its history, Red Hat shipped with smail, but this has been replaced with sendmail.
* Zmailer - apparently designed for mail servers with a large number of users.

===Mail User Agents (MUAs)===

* Acmemail - Web-based mail agent. Allows you to access your mail with any browser. Involves setting up a Perl CGI script on the server side.
* Archimedes - A successor program to XFmail (see below)
* Arrow -
* Balsa - the default Gnome mail program
* Blitzmail -
* Elm -
* Emumail - Web-based mail agent. Allows you to use any browser to check your POP mail account. The Web site of the company that makes this one can be used to check your mail on a Unix system without setting up any CGI script on the server side.
* Evolution - mail reader and contact manager/calendar designed for use under Gnome
* Exmh - graphical front end for Mh
* Kmail - mail reading program included with KDE
* &lt;nowiki&gt; M - for ``Mahogany''. Seems similar to XFmail (see below). I haven't been able to figure out from the description whether it runs independently of or in conjunction with sendmail and procmail. &lt;/nowiki&gt;
* Mh -
* Mumail -
* Mutt - text based mail program, which is highly configurable.
* Nmh - mail handling system. This system includes a ''large'' number of binary commands that are kept in /usr/bin. See the man page for nmh for details. Red Hat 5.1 and 5.2 come with exmh and xmh, which are graphical front ends for nmh. The exmh front end is a separate package, while xmh is owned by XFree86.
* Pine - text based mail and news utility. Features now include:
** MIME support
** ability to read and post network news
** maintenance of an address book of mail recipients
** spell checking during message composition
** mouse support when using xterm on an X Window system
** a highly configurable environment
Pine can be used to download mail from one or more POP3 mail servers. See Tip of the Week ([http://tipoftheweek.darkelf.net &lt;tt&gt;http://tipoftheweek.darkelf.net&lt;/tt&gt;]) for the fourth week of February 1999. First, set up multiple configuration files (pine -p localmail, pine -p popserver 1, pine -p popserver 2, etc.). Then, to configure Pine to use a POP3 server, use the Setup Config command. Set something like this in the inbox-path:
** {pop.server.com/pop3/user=myid}INBOX
When Pine is restarted, it should ask for your password, connect to the remote server, and use it is if it were accessing local mail. The article is unclear on whether there is the option of leaving copies of the downloaded mail on the server.
* Sylpheed -
* XCmail -
* XFmail - This one seems very promising. It's a GUI-based mail tool that seems to offer most of the features of Netscape's mail module. It runs without using sendmail and procmail, which is a major advantage.

===Editors ===

* cooledit - a pretty powerful GUI text editor
* emacs - powerful text editor that includes modules for reading and sending mail and postings to newsgroups, and a browser module. For editing T&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;X and L&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;X files, the AucT&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;X addon package is invaluable, and makes emacs pretty hard to beat as an editor with L&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;X.
* jed - has pretty good emacs emulation (it can even read mail like emacs!). It does simple syntax highlighting for TeX files, including giving positioning of parentheses. It would seem to be pretty configurable and takes up much less disk space than emacs, although more than joe and muemacs. It works well in console mode, and still manages to use colors for menu bars and syntax highlighting. The program xjed which comes with some versions starts up its own X terminal when invoked.
* joe - &quot;Joe's Own Editor&quot;, a fairly powerful editor with a compact binary and an ability to emulate Wordstar, Emacs, Pico, and a few other editors.
* jove - &quot;Joe's Own Version of Emacs&quot;. I tried this out a couple of times and managed to crash it when making some minor errors in command syntax.
* microemacs (JASSPA) - spinoff of muemacs. Pretty powerful and configurable, while not taking up too much disk space or memory.
* muemacs - a fairly powerful emacs clone whose binary is actually smaller than that of the Joe editor.
* nedit - an X Window based text editor. Of all text editors for Linux that I've seen, it has commands which are closest to Windows text editors, for cursor movement, highlighting, marking text, etc. It has very good syntax highlighting for both L&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;X and HTML.
* pico - simple text editor. It often comes packaged with the Pine mail user agent.
* vi - included with most Linux distributions. If you're not used to the syntax, it can be pretty hard to understand.
* vim - improved version of vi
* xedit - simple text editor included with many Linux distributions

===Other===

* dfm - Desktop File Manager. Allows the user to place program icons on the desktop.
* gmc - Gnome Midnight Commander. Gnome version of Midnight Commander. Includes a graphical interface and allows the user to place icons on the desktop.
* mc - Midnight Commander file manager. Runs in console mode and in an xterm.
* scilab - a free matrix programming language. May be a good substitute for GAUSS and/or MATLAB.

|[[Image:Flag of Canada.svg|thumb|300px|'''Canada:''' The Canadian Flag a red flag. It has a white square in the middle with a red maple leaf. Red and white are the official colours of Canada. They were chosen by King George V, the red to represent Saint George's Cross, and the white to represent the French royal emblem. These colours indicate the British and French settlement of Canada. The Maple Leaf indicates the nature and environment of Canada. There are ten species of maple trees native to Canada, and at least one of them grows in each province.]]
|[[Image:Pathfinderflag.jpg|thumb|300px|'''Pathfinder Flag:''' The Pathfinder flag is made from one of several materials,   cotton bunting, rayon, or nylon. The flag is divided through the center both vertically and horizontally making four equal parts. The background colors are royal blue and white alternately sewed together with the upper left hand comer being royal blue. The Pathfinder emblem is centered in the heart of the background. The colors are descriptive of the purposes and ideals of Pathfindering. White means purity, blue means loyalty, red reminds us of the shed blood of Christ (sacrifice), and gold means excellence. The symbols also have meanings. The shield is the protection of God, the sword is his word, the Bible, and the triangle represents completeness. Completeness of the Godhead (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit), and completeness of the three parts of education (Mental, Physical, and Spiritual).]]

|[[Image:Ayflag.jpg|thumb|300px|'''AY Flag:''' The background is red and white, red symbolizing the blood of Christ and white representing purity. In the center, there is a logo that has AY which means Adventist Youth and it has three angels meaning the 3 angels message.]]

===a. Camp out/camporee.===
If your camp has three flag poles to fly flags from, the National flag should be at the centre. When facing the flags, the second-ranking flag should be on the left, and the third on the right. A common way to fly the flags at camporee is with the Canadian flag in the centre, the Provincial flag to the left, and the Pathfinder flag on the right. (Left and right from the point of view when facing the flag display)&lt;BR&gt;

When there are only two flag poles, the position of honour is furthest to the left, and the National flag should be flown there. This also applies if there are four or more flags flown.&lt;BR&gt;

The order of precedence for flags is:&lt;BR&gt;
1. The National Flag of Canada *&lt;BR&gt;
2. The flags of other sovereign nations in alphabetical order&lt;BR&gt;
3. The flags of the provinces of Canada&lt;BR&gt;
4. The flags of municipalities/cities&lt;BR&gt;
5. Banners of organizations&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

* Her Majesty's Personal Canadian Flag, the standards of members of the Royal Family as well as the standard of the Governor General and the standard of the Lieutenant Governor (in his/her province of jurisdiction and when assuming the duties of the representative of The Queen) take precedence over the National Flag of Canada on the buildings where these dignitaries are in residence or where they are attending a function.&lt;BR&gt;

===b. c. Fair / Pathfinder day program===

When in an auditorium or place of worship, the flag should be placed to the left of the audience (right of the speaker) if placed on the stage or platform. If placed on the floor in front of the platform (called &quot;in the body&quot;), it should be to the right of the audience. &lt;BR&gt;
It can also be displayed against the wall behind the speaker. When hanging the flag against a wall, make sure it is right side up (leaf up - stem down). If hanging the flag vertically, the leaf should be to the left, and the stem to the right from the point of view of the audience.

===d. When carried in a procession, (On Parade), The following guidelines should be followed.===
Single File - the National Flag of Canada should always lead.&lt;BR&gt;
In a rank - it is best to have the Canadian flag on each end of the rank. If only one flag is available, it should be placed in the centre of a rank (if the rank has an odd number of people), or on the right hand end (if the rank has an even number of people).&lt;BR&gt;
Pole or Pike - the pole used to carry the flags should be 7 or 8 feet in length. (2.1 to 2.4m)&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt;

See the following link for more details and illustrations.&lt;BR&gt;
[http://www.pch.gc.ca/progs/cpsc-ccsp/etiquette/2_e.cfm Canadian Government rules for flying the flag.]

==3. Demonstrate how to fold and salute your national flag. Mention when and how it should be displayed. ==

===Folding===
There is no official way to fold the Canadian flag, but there are two methods commonly used when the flag is lowered.

1: Prepare the flag for breaking.&lt;BR&gt;

Fold the flag two times lengthwise. &lt;BR&gt; 
Fold it now 3/4 way from end to end. (fly end over hoist end)&lt;BR&gt;
Roll from the fold and tie with light cotton string, so the string can be broken to let the flag fly once hoisted.&lt;BR&gt;

2: Fold so that a portion of the colours and the maple leaf are visible.&lt;BR&gt;

Fold the flag two times lengthwise. &lt;BR&gt;
Fold it now from end to end. (fly end over hoist end)&lt;BR&gt;
Fold it a second time from end to end. (this time fly end goes under hoist end so part of the leaf remains visible)&lt;BR&gt;

===Flag Protocol===
There is no law in Canada that tells you about flag etiquette, but there are established traditions. These practices have been in use by the government and citizens of Canada for many years.&lt;BR&gt;

The National Flag of Canada should always be treated and displayed with dignity. It should be given precedence over all other national flags when flown in Canada. (Except certain times for Royal Family flags, or the representatives)&lt;BR&gt;
The flag should always be flown on its own mast. It is not proper to fly flags below each other on one flag pole. It is allowed to fly the Canadian flag at night, as well as day.&lt;BR&gt;
You should never:
* use the flag as a cover for a table or seat. Or for hiding items behind, or as a separating barrier.
* use the flag cover for a statue or plaque unveiling. (while not technically incorrect, this use is discouraged).
* pin or sew something onto the Canadian flag.
* sign or make markings on the flag.&lt;BR&gt;

When the flag is tattered and worn, it should be destroyed by burning it privately in a dignified way.&lt;BR&gt;

When the National Flag of Canada is raised or lowered, or when it is carried past in a parade or review, all present should face the flag, men should remove their hats, and all should remain silent. Those in uniform should salute.

==4. Explain the meaning of and reason for the National Anthem, and recite the words from memory. ==
&quot;O Canada&quot; is the national anthem of Canada. The melody was composed by Calixa Lavallée in 1880, who was commissioned by the Lieutenant Governor of Quebec, the Honourable Théodore Robitaille. He was asked to compose a melody to a poem written by Judge Adolphe-Basile Routhier.&lt;BR&gt;

The lyric &quot;The True North strong and free&quot; is based on a line from a poem by Alfred Tennyson. He describes Canada as &quot;That True North whereof we lately heard&quot;. In his poem, &quot;true&quot; means &quot;loyal&quot; or &quot;faithful&quot;.&lt;BR&gt; 

&quot;O Canada&quot; was not officially proclaimed to be the national anthem of Canada until 1980. On July 1 (Canada Day) 1980 the Governor General, His Excellency the Right Honourable Edward Schreyer, proclaimed the Act respecting the National Anthem of Canada.&lt;BR&gt;

Canada has two official languages, English and French. &quot;O Canada&quot; has official lyrics in each language.&lt;BR&gt;

;O Canada - English:
:''O Canada!''
:''Our home and native land!''
:''True patriot love in all thy sons command.''
:''With glowing hearts we see thee rise,''
:''The True North strong and free!''
:''From far and wide, O Canada,''
:''We stand on guard for thee.''
:''God keep our land glorious and free!''
:''O Canada, we stand on guard for thee.''
:''O Canada, we stand on guard for thee.''

;O Canada - French:
:''Ô Canada!''
:''Terre de nos aïeux,''
:''Ton front est ceint de fleurons glorieux!''
:''Car ton bras sait porter l'épée,''
:''Il sait porter la croix!''
:''Ton histoire est une épopée''
:''Des plus brillants exploits.''
:''Et ta valeur, de foi trempée,''
:''Protégera nos foyers et nos droits''
:''Protégera nos foyers et nos droits.''

==5. Give the rights and responsibilities of a citizen of your country. ==

The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms is a bill of rights, and part of the Constitution of Canada. It forms the first part of the Constitution Act, 1982. The Charter guarantees certain political and civil rights of people in Canada.

[[W:Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]

List of freedoms:
*freedom of conscience
*freedom of religion
*freedom of thought
*freedom of belief
*freedom of expression
*freedom of the press
*freedom of peaceful assembly
*freedom of association.
 
List of rights:

*Democratic rights: the right to vote and participate in government.
*Mobility rights: the right to come and go from or within Canada, and to live wherever a person chooses.
*Legal rights: rights of people in dealing with the justice system and law enforcement.
*Equality rights: equal treatment before and under the law, and equal protection and benefit of the law without discrimination.
*Language rights: generally, the right to use either the English or French language in communications with Canada's federal government and certain provincial governments.
*Minority language education rights: some rights to be educated in English or French even in minority situations.

Citizens are responsible for:

*Serving on jury when reaching the age of majority, and if selected.
*Obeying Canada's laws.
*Respecting the rights and freedoms of others.
*Helping others in the community.
*Caring for and protecting the Canadian heritage and environment.
*Eliminating discrimination and injustice.

==6. Have an interview with a local, regional, or national official of your country, and learn about his duties. ==
It is generally easier to get a local official to agree to an interview, though it is often more exciting to interview a more prominent person.  The interview can be accomplished during a club meeting, and multiple Pathfinders can ask questions.  Invite your guest well ahead of time, and make sure everyone in the club is on time.  A visit by an official would be a very good reason to have everyone in the club wear their class A uniforms.  If desired, you can make up several questions ahead of time, writing them on index cards, and distributing them to the members of your club.  But do not be so rigid as to not allow them to ask spontaneous questions.  Having questions prepared ahead of time on index cards are a good way to get things rolling.  Here are some suggested questions:
* Could you describe a typical day at work?
* What is the most difficult part of your job?
* What is the most satisfying aspect of your job?
* To whom do you report?
* How did you get your position?  Were you elected, appointed, or hired?
* How should a young person prepare for a life of public service?

==7. Write a one-page essay or give a two-minute oral report about a famous person in your country. Mention what he has done to gain his recognition. ==
This would be an excellent opportunity to present a worship during the opening exercises of a regular club meeting.  Encourage your Pathfinder to choose a person they are personally interested in.  If they cannot think of anyone themselves, have a list of suggested persons at hand and encourage them to choose from the list.  Famous people might be historical figures, politicians, actors, sports stars, or anyone else.  It would be preferable to choose a person who has been a positive influence on the country.

Although the requirement asks that you &quot;mention what ''he'' has done to gain ''his'' recognition,&quot; this should not be interpreted as excluding women.  Men are not the ''only'' famous people in a country.

Here are some names that may be considered.

*[[W:Frederick Banting|Frederick Banting - Co-discoverer of insulin]]
*[[W:Robert Bateman (naturalist)|Robert Bateman - Naturalist - Painter]]
*[[W:Alexander Graham Bell|Alexander Graham Bell - Scientist - Inventor of Telephone]]
*[[W:Roberta Bondar|Roberta Bondar - First Canadian woman astronaut]]
*[[W:Tommy Douglas|Tommy Douglas - Father of Medicare]]
*[[W:Terry Fox|Terry Fox - Marathon of Hope]]
*[[W:Rick Hansen|Rick Hansen - Paraplegic athlete - activist for people with spinal cord injuries]]
*[[W:John A. Macdonald|John A. Macdonald - First Canadian Prime Minister]]
*[[W:John McCrae|John McCrae - Poet - Soldier - In Flanders Fields]]
*[[W:James Naismith|James Naismith - Inventor of Basketball]]
*[[W:David Suzuki|David Suzuki - Environmental activist]]
*[[W:Pierre Trudeau|Pierre Trudeau - Canadian Prime Minister]]

*[[W:List of Prime Ministers of Canada|List of Prime Ministers of Canada]]
*[[W:List of Canadian sports personalities|List of Canadian sports personalities]]
*[[W:List of Canadian musicians|List of Canadian musicians]]

==8. Do one of the following: ==
===a. Make a list of ten famous quotations from leaders of your country.===

Some Canadian quotes can be found on the WikiQuote article.
*[[wikiquote:Canada|Canada Quotes]]&lt;BR&gt;
These lists of Canadian political leaders will help you find quotes.

*[[W:List of current Canadian first ministers|List of current Canadian first ministers]]
*[[W:List of House members of the 39th Parliament of Canada|List of House members of the 39th Parliament of Canada]]

===b. Make a list of ten famous historic places in your country. ===

In Canada, the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada, maintains a list of historic sites.

*[http://www.pc.gc.ca/progs/lhn-nhs/index_E.asp National Historic Sites of Canada]
*[[W:List of National Historic Sites of Canada|List of National Historic Sites of Canada]]

===c. Make a list of ten famous historic events in your country.===
A time line of Canadian events are found in the site below.

*[http://www.tceplus.com/Timeline/100Events_frame.html The 100 Great Events in Canadian History]

==9. Describe what you can do as a citizen to help your church and country. ==
The best way to help either your church or your country is by ''getting involved''.  Edmund Burke, an English philosopher summed this up when he said ''&quot;The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.&quot;''

In your church, this means that you will show up for services on a regular basis.  It also means you will support it with your tithes and offering, show up for business meetings, and not wait to be asked before you volunteer your services.  If you see something that needs done, ''do it.''  If you do not have the skill to do it, or you think that you need permission first, talk to your pastor, an elder, deacon, or deaconess.  Find your ministry!

For your country, it is much the same.  Show up for public meetings, stay informed about the issues of the day, vote if you are eligible, and pay your taxes fairly and promptly.

==10. Go through the steps of an individual acquiring citizenship in the country and learn how this is done. ==

A person becomes a Citizen of Canada in one of four ways.

1. Is born in Canada.

2. Is born outside Canada, to Canadian parents.

3. Applies to become a Citizen of Canada. Applicants must meet a number of requirements.
* must be a permanent resident (a person with permission to live and work in Canada with no end date)
* must be 18 (under 18 must apply with their parents who are applying)
* must have lived in Canada for 3 out of 4 years
* must know about Canada (there is a test)
* must know about the rights and responsibilities of Canadian citizenship
* must be of good character
* must not be a war criminal
* must be able to speak English or French well enough to communicate.&lt;BR&gt;

The final step to applying for is to attend a citizenship ceremony to recite and sign The Oath of Citizenship.

You can read the [[W:Oath of citizenship (Canada)|Oath of citizenship]] yourself. 

4. Be adopted by Canadian parents. Since 2006 children adopted by Canadian citizens can apply for immediate citizenship.&lt;BR&gt;
For more details read the following pages.

*[[W:Permanent resident (Canada)|Permanent resident (Canada)]]
*[[W:Oath of citizenship (Canada)|Oath of citizenship (Canada)]]
*[[W:Immigration to Canada|Immigration to Canada]]&lt;BR&gt;

The Government of Canada maintains a web site called [http://www.goingtocanada.gc.ca/CIC/display-afficher.do?id=0000000000096&amp;lang=eng Going to Canada] with even more information.

==11. Know how to explain the process of government in your country. ==

==12. Explain the meaning of this statement Jesus made in Matthew 22:21: &quot;Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's. ==
This verse teaches that governmental authority is to be respected, as long as it does not conflict with the moral obligations of being a Christian.  Government serves a holy purpose; preserving social order, promoting the well-being of its citizens, and protecting their safety.  If you believe that this does not apply today because you see the government as corrupt, you are urged to research the Roman government of the first century A.D. when these words were spoken by Jesus.  Was Herod corrupt?  Was Pilate just?

==13. Explain why laws are established in your country. ==

==Introduction==

This tutorial will explain step by step how to deploy an extension for Firefox 3. In this way the reader could implement in a easy way extensions that let personalize their version of Firefox, taking care about the compatibilities with Firefox 3.0*.

The first chapter gives a brief introduction to the extensions for Firefox. Then it will discuss some items that the developer must have considered about the compatibilities.

The second chapter starts to describe step by step how to deploy the extension and then, the last chapter will explain hoy to make the install file and how to install it.

 
==Extensions for Firefox 3.0.*==

This chapter will introduce the topic of what are the extensions and what functionalities they give. And for last the topic of compatibility.


===What are the extensions?===

An extension is a new functionality that is integrated to Firefox. These one can be deployed independent from the browser and from the platform. So we can say that extensions let users to bring new features, functionalities and behaviors to the browser.

 
The extensions are not the same as plug-ins. A plug-in allows for the viewing of web content that the browser cannot show by itself, for example: pdf, flash, sounds and videos.


===Compatibility with Firefox 3.0.*===

Some functions of JavaScript are not longer supported in the new releases of Firefox, especially over versions 3.p.*. Also the structures of the manifest files and the reference to the browes.xul have been changed. It is important to know about that changes, if not the extension could be incompatible with the last versions of Firefox. Other items to consider are the Managers that Firefox implements (ex, loginManager). These have been suffered changes too. For more information: Updating....

 

==Start creating an extension.==

The next chapter describes step by step how to develop simple extensions. It’ll specify the folders that must be created, the structure that must follow the type of files and the root folder.

 
===Structure of folders===

There is an obligatory structure that the folders must carry out. This structure defines the names of the folders, the hierarchical structure, the type of files of each folder and the place where these folders and files should be stored for bean recognized for Firefox.



===Root folder===

Al the beginning we must create a folder with the name of the extension. This name must be unique and match the name defined in the installation file. There are two ways of naming the root folder of an extension.

As mentioned, this name must be unique, so the first alternative is to generate a GUID identifier for it. In windows you can use the guidgen command and in Linux the uuidgen command. For example, you can generate this {1ca6f699-f8f3-479b-983b-20775f09f755}.
The second alternative is to create a name with e-mail format. Is not recommendable to use a personal e-mail, only should have the same format. For example, we can call our extension like myextension@somedomain.

Inside the root folder we'll create the structure corresponding to the extension.

 

===Chrome Folder===

Having a look on some network filesystems commonly used you will notice restrictions regarding subnet topologies or distribution of meta and real data distribution.

Maybe you have heard about OpenAFS, Coda, Intermezzo and/or Distributed Filesystem.

In this book you will get a detailed view inside OpenAFS and important services provided by Kerberos.

Often you find HOWTOs teaching you on ''how'' you can solve a problem. It is a goal of this book to teach you why that specific problem exists. Understanding causale and action is much more effective than &quot;googling&quot; for the specific error as it enables you to save time. So let us see this book as WHYTO.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|How have mobile devices unified communications?}}

Modern communications has come a long way from the invention of the telephone in the 1880's to the introduction of data communications in the 1960's. Modern communications have evolved to the point where communication is automated and immediate. The immediacy or as Philip Howard of Bloor Research puts it: is the reduction of human 'latency' to improve the processes of communication (Elliot, 2008). The improvement in communication and the technologies behind these improvements falls under one concept: Unified Communication. This article will discuss the benefits and challenges of Unified Communications. But before we begin, let us define Unified Communication.

==Unified Communication Defined==
Unified Communications (UC) encompasses many modern methods of communications: from instant messaging, email, voice mail, to VOIP (voice-over-internet-protocol). Unified communication is the merging of multiple messages types across multiple communication points (Evans, 2004). It is also with the purpose to improve communication; to be able to reach out and receive information; to collaborate (Presence Management) with business partners, associates, clients and personal, any time, anywhere. Since consumers and business individuals can be reached 24 hours a day 7 days a week; UC is often associated with boosting productivity (Evans, 2004). There are several benefits that businesses can enjoy under Unified Communications:

==Simplifying Communication Management==
Regardless of the type of message received; business users can access these messages from anywhere or from one central location. Keeping inline with the definition of UC, messages can be received and sent using any method: be it email, instant messages, video conferencing, or voice mail; businesses can retrieve important information from any of these mediums. UC also provides users effective ways in differentiating personal and business messages, by providing them with means for “broadcasting messages” using classified contact lists (Evans 2004). By having the messages automatically filter by categorization, business users can benefit by accessing important and/or relevant information immediately.

==Enhancing the Business Experience==
“Rich Internet Applications” (RIA) with embedded streaming-video and/or streaming content provides users a vivid “experience” to businesses products or services (Doyle, 2008). Since these applications are loaded on continuously running web-serves, businesses are made available to customers 24 hours a day. In addition to these applications, other UC methods like chat-rooms, instant messaging and forums that are embedded in businesses online assets provides users a rich environment where both consumers and businesses can reach out to each other in real-time. Despite the many benefits that UC provides for both users and businesses, there are many pitfalls in the implication, usage and adoption of Unified Communications. We will now focus our attention in discussing these challenges in Unified Communications.

==UC Technology Maturity==
According to Dagny Evan’s (2004) article on Unified Communications, the technology and its applications are not “mature enough” for quick adoption. The problem lies within the existing IT infrastructure of the business. Since many UC technologies are proprietary based, businesses are force to adopt their standards of communication instead of blending (or customizing) it within their existing IT infrastructure (Evans 2004).  In addition to implementing UC many users “find that the categorization, search, and retrieval functions are often cumbersome.” Businesses may find that implementing UC technologies; from training employees in their usage of UC applications and technologies to purchasing UC equipment may find it too corrosive in capital expenditures (Evans 2004). Since UC is co-dependent on the internet to transmit data and messages, UC may be susceptible to “IP-network attacks” such as “eavesdropping, altering conversations and fraud” (Greene, 2008).

==Conclusion==
Despite these setbacks in UC, UC is finding itself in many aspects of business life: from providing technical support to customers within online chat-rooms to addressing supplier concerns over an email, Unified communication provides its users a single-point of instantaneous access and availability to businesses and consumers.

I copied and pasted the implementation section of our tech plan to start with. 
Miguel, do you still have that blue book that you got the implementation schedule from? Could you add that chart?
Paige

Hi Paige and Miguel,
I tried to get the chart to look like a chart but could not figure out how to do it.  Check out what I did and see if you'd like me to try changing it in any way.  I'm going to try adding a little more to is tomorrow.  I think it looks good so far.
Thanks,
Stacy

Hey guy,

Timeline wasn't part of Implementation, it was supposed to be it's own chapter and part of group #3. Alex is supposed to be working on that section tonight. I need to restore TImeline as its own entity in the Contents - Michael</text>

:: While there seems to be some copyediting to the book, the potential copyvios are still there.  A translation is probably a derivative work, and while you can put a derivative work into the public-domain if the original work is in the public domain, you can not put a derivative work into the public domain while having the original work copyrighted.  The work-around for this is to cite/reference the material.  However, you're going to have huge blocks of citations for portions of the book, which is not the original thought of citation.  I'm not sure what the copyright laws are in Colombia, so someone else would need to speak for this.  If you can provide a link from the Luis Angel Arango Library that states the material is copyright/public-domain, or otherwise free resource, then you can copy it/translate it directly.  However, to me, there's a lot more than the &quot;Orinoquian Region&quot; section that just screams &quot;I've been copied from another source.&quot; --[[User:Retropunk|Retropunk]] ([[User talk:Retropunk|talk]]) 21:47, 26 October 2008 (UTC)

: [[Image:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px]] '''Delete''' While I think this topic can fit within the scope of Wikibooks, I find there are great problems with how the import of material has been handled. The material seems to come largely from third party sources rather than being original works of the editors. While some text is being modified, it is still derivative work. I think that at this point we are faced with two alternatives.
:# The editors go through the entire edit history, and identify the source for every text import.
:# Delete the book and start over.
: Since there are layers of edits and text has been split up and altered, were there any copyright violations, they would be very painstaking to remove. For that reason, I recommend that the book contributors save whatever original work they have to their user (sub-)page(s) and we delete this book. Since much of it is from external sources, the material shouldn't be too difficult to re-import.
: This may sound harsh and like a lot of work, but I think that at this point it may be less work. Unless we see a detailed description of where the material is from and how it is permitted to be published at Wikibooks, we have to delete this book. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 02:52, 28 October 2008 (UTC)

'''Coffee concentrate''' is produced through the '''cold brew''' method, in which ground [[cookbook:Coffee|coffee]] is soaked in water for several hours, then strained, leaving a strong coffee liquid. Coffee made from coffee concentrate is generally less acidic than regularly brewed coffee and can be prepared stronger or weaker per the individual drinker's taste. It can be kept refrigerated for two to three weeks. 

==Ingredients==
* 1 pound ground coffee OR coffee and [[cookbook:chicory|chicory]] blend
* 3.5 quarts mineral water 
* 2 1 gallon jars
* sieve
* cheese cloth 

==Procedure==
# Add coffee grounds to jar. 
# Pour mineral water over grounds, stirring only to ensure all coffee is wet. 
# Let mixture stand for 10-12 hours (best to let it sit over night). 
# Line sieve with cheesecloth and place or hold over other jar. Pour coffee mixture into sieve, allowing grounds to collect. 
# Discard coffee grinds and store coffee concentrate in the refrigerator. It will keep for two to three weeks. 
# To prepare coffee from concentrate, use a ratio of concentrate:water of 1:2 or 1:3 depending on taste.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Bacterial Artificial Chromosomes (BAC)==
Bacterial Artificial Chromosome also known as BAC is a vector used to clone a target DNA piece and planted in bacterial content.  Vectors are carriers that are also made of DNA.  The vector acts as a parent host, which much acts like a guide to carry out the gene from cloning.  Bacterial artificial chromosomes can be as large as insects.  In order to amplify a gene, DNA sequence must be extracted from a desired source using restriction enzymes to cleave the vector and the target DNA and attach into a host bacterium.  Plasmids of bacteria usually play a vital role in the cloning process since they are also made of DNA and they can be compatible with experimental gene.   Vectors also contain the origin of replication where replication begins at the vector site and proceed with the attached sample.

==Common Gene Components==
&lt;b&gt;''oriS, repE•F''&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
* replicates plasmid replication and regulates copy number&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;''parA and parB''&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
* partitions F plasmid DNA into daughter cells during division and ensures stable maintenance of the BAC&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;''A'' selectable markers&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
*because some BACs also have lacZ at the cloning site for blue/white selection, this is used to resist antibiotics&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;''T7 and Sp6''&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
*phage promoters for transcription of inserted genes&lt;br&gt;

==Contribution to Models of Disease==
===Inherited disease===
BACs are being greatly used in modeling genetic diseases in order to study their effects in the experimentation on transgenic mice. Because complex genes often have many regulatory sequences upstream of the encoding sequence, including many promoter sequences that will control a gene's express level, BACs have been found very useful in this area of study. When tested with mice, BAC has been able to help with the study of neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease or Down syndrome. BAC has also been recently used to study specific oncogenes, which are associated with various different cancers. BAC is transferred over to these genetic disease models through the use of electroporation/transformation, which is essentially transfection with a compatible virus or micro injection. BACs have also been used to detect genes or large sequences of interest, and then used to map them onto the human chromosome using BAC arrays. Because this process is able to accommodate much larger sequences without the risk of rearrangement, it is the preferred method of these types of genetic studies and also more stable than other types of cloning vectors.
===Infection disease===
BACs can also act as clones of large DNA viruses as well as RNA viruses. These clones are known as &quot;infections clones,&quot; as transfection of the BAC construct into host cells is enough to initiate the viral infection in the host. The infectious property that the BACs contain has aided in the study of viruses such as herpesviruses, poxviruses, and coronaviruses. Using genetic approaches to mutate and transform the BAC while it resides in bacteria, molecular studies of these viruses can be performed.

      <comment>/* a couple of recommended tweaks */ new section</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Toward the end of this tutuorial, this line:

&quot;Next we'll want to steal the Hobbit startup script and use it to start Hobbit upon entering run level 3.&quot;

 scp root@essex.imaginenetworksllc.com:/etc/init.d/hobbit /etc/init.d/hobbit

It asks for the password for root. Without the password, one cannot &quot;steal&quot; that script.

== a couple of recommended tweaks ==

There are two tweaks I had to find my way to as I was following this book:

- on CentOS 6.2 and compiling Xymon 4.3.7, I noted that starting /home/xymon/server/bin/xymonlaunch.sh --debug showed output looking for tasks.cfg in the top-level /etc/ for some reason. I had chosen nothing unusual as I ran ./configure.server before compiling, and the makefile showed no indication of a bad variable being set. I could not find a way around this, so I used the workaround of creating symlink /etc/tasks.cfg pointed at /home/xymon/server/etc/tasks.cfg. This allowed the server to start normally.

- also, for the Apache less-initiated, it was not clear that /home/xymon/ would need to be 755 in order for /home/xymon/server/www/ to be accessible. That kept me puzzled for several hours.</text>

      <comment>/* Defining New Operators */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{prognav|F Sharp Programming|Exception Handling|Classes}}

{{fsharpTitle|Operator Overloading}}
Operator overloading allows programmers to provide new behavior for the default operators in F#. In practice, programmers overload operators to provide a simplified syntax for objects which can be combined mathematically.

== Using Operators ==
You've already used operators:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;let sum = x + y&lt;/source&gt;
Here &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; is example of using a mathematical addition operator.

== Operator Overloading ==
Operators are functions with special names, enclosed in brackets. They must be defined as static class members. Here's an example on declaring &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; operator on complex numbers:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;type Complex =
    {   Re: double
        Im: double }
    static member ( + ) (left: Complex, right: Complex) =
        { Re = left.Re + right.Re; Im = left.Im + right.Im }
&lt;/source&gt;

In FSI, we can add two complex numbers as follows:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; let first = { Re = 1.0; Im = 7.0 };;
val first : Complex

&gt; let second = { Re = 2.0; Im = -10.5 };;
val second : Complex

&gt; first + second;;
val it : Complex = {Re = 3.0;
                    Im = -3.5;}&lt;/source&gt;

== Defining New Operators ==
In addition to overloading existing operators, its possible to define new operators. The names of custom operators can only be one or more of the following characters:
: &lt;code&gt;!%&amp;*+-./&lt;=&gt;?@^|~&lt;/code&gt;

F# supports two types of operators: infix operators and prefix operators.

=== Infix operators ===
An infix operator takes two arguments, with the operator appearing in between both arguments (i.e. &lt;code&gt;arg1 {op} arg2&lt;/code&gt;). We can define our own infix operators using the syntax:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;let (op) arg1 arg2 = ...&lt;/source&gt;

In addition to mathematical operators, F# has a variety of infix operators defined as part of its library, for example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
let inline (|&gt;) x f = f x
let inline (::) hd tl = Cons(hd, tl)
let inline (:=) (x : 'a ref) value = x.contents &lt;- value&lt;/source&gt;

Let's say we're writing an application which performs a lot of regex matching and replacing. We can match text using Perl-style operators by defining our own operators as follows:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
open System.Text.RegularExpressions

let (=~) input pattern =
    Regex.IsMatch(input, pattern)

let main() =
    printfn &quot;cat =~ dog: %b&quot; (&quot;cat&quot; =~ &quot;dog&quot;)
    printfn &quot;cat =~ cat|dog: %b&quot; (&quot;cat&quot; =~ &quot;cat|dog&quot;)
    printfn &quot;monkey =~ monk*: %b&quot; (&quot;monkey&quot; =~ &quot;monk*&quot;)
 
main()&lt;/source&gt;

This program outputs the following:
&lt;pre&gt;cat =~ dog: false
cat =~ cat|dog: true
monkey =~ monk*: true&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Prefix Operators ===
Prefix operators take a single argument which appears to the right side of the operator (&lt;code&gt;{op}argument&lt;/code&gt;). You've already seen how the &lt;code&gt;!&lt;/code&gt; operator is defined for ref cells:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;type 'a ref = { mutable contents : 'a }
let (!) (x : 'a ref) = x.contents&lt;/source&gt;

Let's say we're writing a number crunching application, and we wanted to define some operators that work on lists of numbers. We might define some prefix operators in fsi as follows:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; let ( !+ ) l = List.reduce ( + ) l
let ( !- ) l = List.reduce ( - ) l
let ( !* ) l = List.reduce ( * ) l
let ( !/ ) l = List.reduce ( / ) l;;

val ( !+ ) : int list -&gt; int
val ( !- ) : int list -&gt; int
val ( !* ) : int list -&gt; int
val ( !/ ) : int list -&gt; int

&gt; !* [2; 3; 5];;
val it : int = 30

&gt; !+ [2; 3; 5];;
val it : int = 10

&gt; !- [2; 3; 7];;
val it : int = -8

&gt; !/ [100; 10; 2];;
val it : int = 5&lt;/source&gt;

*Thank you, somehow I didn't notice that on the userpage; he's also Doug on Wikiversity, which I had noticed and had planned to contact him about; unfortunately on that project he already has both names and I don't believe there is yet a way to merge them.  For clarity, as I state on my user page, I am Doug ''practically'' everywhere else.  It is my global account and the home wiki for the ID is enwiki where I'm an admin.  I'm also Doug on wiktionary, commons, and meta and several foreign wikis where I either created it myself or the account was auto created when I dropped in to message someone; I recently usurped unused usernames on wikisource, wikinews, de.wikipedia, pt.wikipedia, species, etc. and I also have pending usurps on mediawiki&lt;u&gt;,&lt;/u&gt; &lt;s&gt;and &lt;/s&gt;wikiquote&lt;u&gt;, jawiki, and kowiki&lt;/u&gt;. There is a fairly active user:Doug on it.wikipedia but since I don't speak Italian I'm not going to worry about that one I don't think, though I might ping him at some point about changing so he can have an SUL account, and there are a few other foreign wikis &lt;s&gt;(ja and ko I remember) where there are unused that I haven't caught up with yet and a few others&lt;/s&gt; - eswiki, esbooks, and frwiki where there are a few edits like here, maybe those belong to Reswik too.  --[[User:BewareofDoug|BewareofDoug]] ([[User talk:BewareofDoug|talk]]) 02:15, 21 November 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">A [[w:beowulf_(computing)|beowulf cluster]] is a [[w:cluster_(computing)|cluster]] of computers designed to run computing jobs in parallel. This provides an up-to date example of assembled hardware and installed programs (plus configuration). There will be explanations of how to run processes in parallel with computing languages such as [[w:Matlab|matlab]] and [[w:R_(programming_language)|R]]. After the computers are setup we may want to transfer the configuration to other computers, a process called cloning. In the last chapter, we will deal with benchmarking and profiling.

      <text xml:space="preserve">You need to run big simulations or experiments with many repetitions (e.g. [[w:Bootstrapping_(computing)|bootstrapping]])? Then you need big computational power. You don't want to spend huge money on one big and expensive computer? 

There are many computations, called [[w:embarrassingly parallel|embarrassingly parallel]], because each run or iteration is independent from others and in principle all could run in parallel. Therefore, instead of spending huge bucks on a huge machine, you could rather decide on many cheap computers and have them compute in parallel. The computers are connected in a network and run Linux. This is called a beowulf. 

In the next chapters we will see an example of some hardware with actual prices (in euros). In subsequent chapters, we will deal with issues of installation and configuration. In the end we come to running processes in parallel using matlab and R.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Argumentation'''

When teaching argumentation, it is important to show practical methods, as this is often an area that confuses students.  By showing pragmatic approaches to structuring an argument, students can better articulate their thoughts.  Moreover, the skill of argumentation can be applied to other assignments as well, such as the research paper, cause and effect, and compare and contrast.

''The Toulmin method:''

1. Claim

This is the statement the arguer wants the audience to believe.  Claims such as “abortion should be protected by the constitution,” “marijuana should be legal for medicinal purposes,” and “the drinking age should be lowered,” are examples of often over-used freshmen argument claims.  The claim can serve as a thesis, and it is an essential starting point for any argument paper.

2. Grounds

The grounds, or data, of an argument emphasizes the arguer’s ethos (or credibility).  It is imperative to an argument that the grounds be well founded, noncontroversial, and supportive.  Claims supported with solid grounds become much stronger.  For example, in an argument about lowering the drinking age, saying “my parents told me drinking is bad for you,” is much less effective than saying, “scientists predict .5% of one’s brain cells are lost every time he/she binge drinks.”

3. Warrant

This links the two previous steps.  It creates the bridge between the claim and the grounds.  Sometimes the warrant is implicit, unstated, or combined with the grounds.

4. Qualifier

This modifies the strength of an argument.  Based on what kind of qualifier you choose, your argument becomes more or less believable.  For example, the qualifier, “all people who drink become alcoholics,” is so strong of a claim that it becomes unbelievable.  Here, if the qualifier is toned-down, the statement becomes more believable: “Some people who drink become alcoholics.”

5. Rebuttal

It is often important to include and possibly debunk rebuttal arguments.  For example, saying “despite scientists claim about the effects of drinking on the brain, it has been shown to be no less damaging than using a cell phone,” shows that you can anticipate your critics.

== Topic Ideas ==

Hello! I was thinking about using the Rogerian argument, as well as the Burkean argument as supplements to this page. Additionally, there are several different types of argumentation that students can use. Thus, there are multiple in-class exercises that students can do; they can also try their hand at using the various argumentative techniques for their major writing assignments. If it is acceptable to everyone paying attention to this discussion forum, I would like to make those additions to this page.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A lot of attention should be focused on the hardware assembly. There are many tradeoffs and considerations of speed bottlenecks. You should be careful to settle on a vendor with experience, where they can give you good recommendations. 

Here is a list of hardware, which we assembled at the artificial olfaction lab at the [http://www.ibecbarcelona.eu/ Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia]. Prices are as of May 2008 and do not include taxes. 

[[Image:Howtobeowulf_rackmounted.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[w:19-inch_rack|rack]] containing a 8 computers, a [[w:KVM switch|KVM]], and a [[w:network_switch|switch]] (behind KVM).]]
We bought 8 computers with these parameters:
* [[w:Intel Core 2|Intel Core 2]] Duo Quad Q6600 2.4 GHz FSB1066 8MB 
* Chipset Intel X38 / [[w:List of Marvell Technology Group chipsets|Intel ICH9R]]
* 4 GB RAM [[w:DDR3 SDRAM|DDR3]] 1066 (in 2x2Gb). 
* 2 x PCI Express x16, 1 x PCI Express x1, 2 x PCI-X y 1 PCI
* Marvell88E8056 Dual [[w:Gigabit Ethernet|Gigabit LAN]] controller
* Realtek ALC882M 7.1 chanels (sound
* 6 USB 2.0 ports y 1 IEEE1394 
* VGA 512MB [[w:GeForce|Gforce]]8400GS PCI-e
* 160 GB de Disco Duro [[w:Serial ATA|SATA II]] 3 Gb.
* DVD R/W, Multicard reader/writer
* 19&quot; rack computer case, 4U, with frontal lock.
* 550W Server Guru 

They cost 923 euros each. 

In order to operate 8 computers efficiently you need a monitor that you can connect to all machines. Better even a [[w:KVM switch|KVM]] (keyboard video mouse). A KVM with 8 ports cost us 850 euros. The KVM, as the name says, serves as keyboard, monitor, and mouse, and did great service during configuration because it allows fast switching between different computers. 

We also need to connect all the computers among themselves: A [[w:network_switch|switch]] with 16 ports, 10/100/1000, comes at 162 euros.

We want to put all the hardware somewhere, where it is save and where it has good conditions of cooling and safety: a [[w:19-inch_rack|rack]] (see picture). The rack on the picture can take up 42 units of 19'' and cost us 500 euros.

Don't be surprised to be charged extra for cables, screws, and multi-outlet power strips. Rails allow you to stack in and take out your computers like drawers. Additional cost: about 700 euros. 

Also on top, the VAT, in Spain 18%, which makes about 1500 euros.  

Total cost of the beowulf: about 11,090 euros.

In order to connect your computers, you need power lines that can support them. The configuration above needs about 4.5kWatt and we had to wait about 2 months for technicians to fix the capacity (that's Spain). 
 
On the photo you can see the computer hardware mounted into the rack. You can see the 8 computers flanking from two sides the KVM which is in the middle, behind it the switch.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In this chapter, you will find basics of installation, configuration, and administration. Most important here: 1. network setup with DHCP, 2. sharing files over the network with the network file system (NFS). After we cover this, we will come to some more general ideas of administration. 

Most beowulfs use a network structure of master (also network head) and slaves, so that computing jobs are going to be distributed from the master to the slaves. All machines of the cluster are connected to the switch. The head will additionally interface with an external network. Master and slaves will share user data over the network. It is easiest to only install the master and one slave (called ''golden slave'') in a first step. In a later chapter we will come to cloning, which is the process of creating machines that are identical to the golden slave. Alternatively to cloning, one may choose to do a diskless boot.

Practically this means, that the master (or head node) has two network interfaces (say eth0, eth1), one connected to the outside world and one connected to the cluster intranet over a network switch. All other computers (the slaves or nodes) are connected to the switch. In order to start processes on the cluster a user logs in on the master and spawns the processes from there to the slaves.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are linux distributions specialized on beowulf clusters, such as [http://www.rocksclusters.org Rocks Clusters], which can facilitate the installation and administration of clusters. Unfortunately, rocks clusters (v. 5) didn't recognize the network cards of our computers. We tried the Ubuntu Server Edition (Hardy), which didn't recognize the CD-ROM. [[w:Fedora (operating system)|Fedora 9]] recognized all hardware at once, so this was our distribution of choice. 

Linux isn't the only choice, Solaris, AIX, DragonflyBSD, and many more systems have and can be used in clusters. The basic method is the same, often only with minor changes (e.g. Sun Studio instead of GCC).

For master and slaves, we started from vanilla installations.

* basic gnu toolchain
* editors: [[w:Vim (text editor)|vim]], [[w:Emacs|emacs]], [[w:Ed (text editor)|ed]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">We want the computers to work in a local network. 

The easiest way to setup the network is by DHCP. For practical purposes it is easiest to set up dynamic addresses (DHCP) handled by the master on the basis of physical addresses of slaves' network interfaces. DHCP simplifies the installation of new nodes, because the mac address and hostname is the only thing that is different among the nodes and the DHCP server on the master can manage a new node by a new entry into the configuration file. 

In this example we will set up the network IPs to 192.168.1.1 until 192.168.1.8, where 8 is the master. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
slave(s):/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0

DEVICE=eth0
ONBOOT=yes
BOOTPROTO=dhcp
&lt;/source&gt; 

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
master:/etc/dhcpd.conf

option subnet-mask 255.255.255.0;
option broadcast-address 192.168.1.255;
option routers 10.5.170.254;
# define individual nodes
subnet 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
group { 
# define all slaves, the master (head node) is has a static ip address
host node0{
hardware ethernet 00:1E:8C:30:AC:2A;
fixed-address 192.168.1.250;
}
host node1{
hardware ethernet 00:1E:8C:30:B0:A1;
fixed-address 192.168.1.1;
}
#... Here you can put more nodes. Make a list of the mac addresses of all your machines and enter them in the list. 
}
}
# ignore petitions from second network interface
subnet 10.5.170.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 { not authoritative; }
&lt;/source&gt; 


The idea is to give to slaves the names nodei corresponding to their ip address 192.168.1.i. 

Note that the DHCP server provides IP addresses for the other machines not for itself. The master you give a static ip address (192.168.1.250 here). In red hat based distributions this is configured in /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0 or /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth1. 

I configured eth0 for the organization network and eth1 for the cluster intranet. Example files: 
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0 corresponds to your organization network settings. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
DEVICE=eth0
ONBOOT=yes
...
&lt;/source&gt; 

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth1

DEVICE=eth1
ONBOOT=yes
BOOTPROTO=static
NETWORK=192.168.1.0
IPADDR=192.168.1.250
TYPE=Ethernet
&lt;/source&gt; 

For the slaves, the interface to the cluster intranet is as follows: 

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
DEVICE=eth0
ONBOOT=yes
BOOTPROTO=dhcp
NETMASK=255.255.255.0
NETWORK=192.168.1.0
BROADCAST=192.168.1.255
DNS1=...
DNS2=...
&lt;/source&gt; 

If you don't use a DNS service on your head you use the DNS service of the network of your organization. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
/etc/hosts

127.0.0.1 localhost.localdomain localhost
::1 localhost6.localdomain6 localhost6
192.168.1.250 node0
192.168.1.1 node1
# ... add more names of machines here
&lt;/source&gt; 

Note in /etc/hosts that in the loopback line (first line) the hostname is not given in order to avoid problems with message protocols (PVM, MPI). 

You need to activate ip forwarding on the head in order to have internet access on all machines. You enable the firewall and include masquerading on the network interface to you cluster. This you do by changing the /etc/sysconfig/iptables file or using some user interface, e.g. system-config-firewall on red hat based systems. Be careful not to make your firewall too restrictive as this can cause problems. 

In the /etc/sysconfig/network you need to have: 
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
NETWORKING=YES
IPFORWARD=YES
HOSTNAME=nodei
&lt;/source&gt; 

You have to reinitiate the network services and startup the dhcp server daemon (dhcpd). To have dhcpd startup at boot, in fedora you the ntsysv program allows you to search a list and mark the corresponding entry. 

You may want to setup your printers on master and slave (you can copy an existing printer configuration recursively from /etc/cups e.g. from your local office desktop computer).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Now we want to share data among computers. [[w:Network_file_system|NFS]] configuration is remarkably simple (see the linux nfs faq for help). You basically have to install the package, start the nfs services, and change two files. 

Let's see the example files: 

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
on the master:/etc/export

/home/ 192.168.1.0/255.255.255.0(rw,sync,no_root_squash)
/root 192.168.1.0/255.255.255.0(rw,sync,no_root_squash)
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
on the slave(s):/etc/fstab

192.168.1.250:/home /home nfs rw,hard,intr 0 0
192.168.1.250:/root /root nfs rw,hard,intr 0 0
&lt;/source&gt;

Sharing /home and /root directories password-less ssh login is simplified. For every user that need access to slaves the following achieves the goal: 
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
&gt; ssh-keygen -t rsa
confirm choices and leave password empty. 
&gt; cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub ~/.ssh/authorized_keys 
&lt;/source&gt;

The ~/.ssh/known_host file needs entries for each computer (e.g. by logging in to each machine once). 
I used option -v with the ssh command to speed up ssh changing parameters in /etc/ssh/ssh_config and /etc/ssh/sshd_config. Options that you might want to specify include protocol 2, port 22, PreferredAuthentications PublicKey, IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa. You might want to turn off checking of .ssh/known_hosts, and on the slaves you might want to ignore the host ip (CheckHostIP no), and turn off any authentication method except for public key and password. One of the fastest cipher methods is RC4 (arcfour in ssh config file)&lt;ref&gt;[http://stateless.geek.nz/2004/10/13/scp-performance/ speed comparison of cypher methods with ssh]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">As the principal goal of having the cluster is to run programs in parallel on different machines, I  installed protocols for message-passing for distributed-memory applications. There are two common ones: the [[w:Parallel Virtual Machine|Parallel Virtual Machine]] (PVM) and [[w:Message_Passing_Interface|Message Parsing Interface]] (MPI). 

For scientific computing we can use high-level computing platforms or languages such as C/C++ and fortran. Here we will see GNU R and matlab. R can spawn parallel jobs using either PVM or MPI. Matlab comes with an implementation of MPI (more precisely mpich2). 

Note that for PVM you need to enable password-less ssh access (see previous section) from the server to all clients. Also, for PVM, MPI (includes matlab's mdce), the network configuration you have to remove the host names from the loop-back line (where it says 127.0.0.1) of the /etc/hosts file. Just put localhost instead. Then you need a text file with a list of all machines you wish to use for computing and call it pvmhosts and mpihosts.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The [[w:Parallel Virtual Machine|Parallel Virtual Machine]] (PVM) allows computers which are connected over a network to be used as a single distributed parallel computer. 

Installation of PVM is straightforward from packages, for configuration environment variables need to be set up:  

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
add to /etc/profile: 

export PVM_ROOT=/usr/share/pvm3
export PVM_TMP=/tmp
export PVM_RSH=/usr/bin/ssh
export PVM_ARCH=LINUXX86_64
export PATH=/usr/local/bin/:$PATH
&lt;/source&gt;

In the pvm environment (which you enter typing 'pvm') after adding your machines you can then try the following and see if you can get a list of your machines. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
spawn -&gt; -10 /bin/hostname
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">As for MPI, you can install different implementations. 

Compiling and installing [[w:Mpich2|Mpich2]] was very straightforward. The test again as for PVM should be spawning of /bin/hostname. The install guide is a great help in setting up MPICH2. 

On the master (node0) you type: 
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
mpd &amp;
mpdtrace -l
&lt;/source&gt;

And you should get back the node name (say node0) and port number (say 51227). Then you connect each node to by typing: 
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
mpd -h node0 -p 51227
&lt;/source&gt;

After this, you can spawn processes with mpiexec: 
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
mpiexec -n 10 /bin/hostname. 
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">In this section we see an examples of parallelization from within the R computing platform (statistical computing similar to Matlab) using the snow package, which can distribute jobs using either MPI or PVM. In this subsection we will only see usage of R+PVM. 

Note, that for installation of packages within R the development packages of R are needed. Anyways,  I just installed all R packages that were available in the R repository (something like this: http://cran.es.r-project.org/bin/linux/redhat/fedora9/x86_64, needless to say this may differ for your distribution, machine architecture, and country code). 

You need to install R libraries snow and rpvm on master and slave(s). If you don't, R lets you create the PVM cluster object but then freezes when you try to execute a job.

in R: 
&lt;source lang=&quot;matlab&quot;&gt;
&gt; library('snow')
&gt; library('rpvm')
&gt; cl&lt;-makePVMcluster(count=2,names=c('node0','node1'))
&gt; clusterCall(cl, function() Sys.info()[c(&quot;nodename&quot;,&quot;machine&quot;)])
[[1]]
nodename machine 
&quot;node1&quot; &quot;x86_64&quot; 

[[2]]
nodename machine 
&quot;node0&quot; &quot;x86_64&quot; 
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">As for matlab, note that in order to run it on a 64bit system you need shared libraries (on Fedora the package is called libXp, on ubuntu ia32) and some java packages. 

Matlab comes with the parallel computing toolbox, the distributed computing server, and an implementation of mpich2. You can find manuals in pdf format on the corresponding mathworks site. You start the mpich2 server as root: 

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
$MATLAB/toolbox/distcomp/bin/mdce start
&lt;/source&gt;

$MATLAB is the directory of your matlab installation. 

(Note: Here holds the same as for PVM. For mdce to work, you need to remove from /etc/hosts the loopback line with your host name in it, i.e. 127.0.1.1 node0 becomes your_network_ip node0. )

We start the job manager: 
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
$MATLAB/toolbox/distcomp/bin/startjobmanager -name MyJobManager
&lt;/source&gt;

Connect one worker: 
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
$MATLAB/toolbox/distcomp/bin/startworker -jobmanager MyJobManager -jobmanagerhost node0
&lt;/source&gt;

where node0 is the machine where your jobmanager is running (obviously). 


...and a second worker on a different machine. From node0: 

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
$MATLAB/toolbox/distcomp/bin/startworker -jobmanager MyJobManager -jobmanagerhost node0 -name worker2 -remotehost node1
&lt;/source&gt;

Use the option remotehost to start a worker on a different machine. 

Make sure that job manager and workers are running: 
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
$MATLAB/toolbox/distcomp/bin/nodestatus
&lt;/source&gt;

Starting matlab in desktop mode (we need jvm), parallel-&gt;configure and parallel-&gt;administrate, we choose MyJobManager basically and start the &quot;matlabpool&quot;: 

&lt;source lang=&quot;matlab&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt; matlabpool open
&lt;/source&gt;
You should see the confirmation&quot; Connected to a matlabpool session with 2 labs (or more).&quot;

The simple proof of concept: 
&lt;source lang=&quot;matlab&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt; parfor i=1:5
unix('hostname');
end
&lt;/source&gt;

      <comment>replace &quot;node1&quot;, &quot;node2&quot; with more descriptive names.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">When master and one slave (the '''golden slave''') are installed and configured and now we want to scale up this configuration to more slaves by replicating the exact configuration of the golden slave.  

Installing and configuring the OS on each machine manually is cumbersome and prone to error. However, nodes are identical, so why not just copy everything we need? This process is called cloning. We first setup a so-called golden node or model node and then transfer the system to other slave machines. Each new node will come with one new entry in the head node's DHCP server file (/etc/dhcpd.conf) and /etc/hosts file.

For preparation, make sure that in /etc/fstab and in the /boot/grub/menu.lst, there are no physical addresses of hardware (e.g. a hard disk), as they will be different among the nodes. All hardware should be addressed by their subdirectory in /dev which you can see in the output when you type mount.

I used low level R/W with dd and piping to and from netcat, respectively on machine to clone from and machine to clone to, as described in a howto. We clone using convert and copy (dd) and netcat (nc). 

On the golden slave (or an identical clone) you run:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
node1# dd if=/dev/hda conv=sync,noerror bs=64k | nc -l 5000
&lt;/source&gt;

On the completely blank soon-to-be-slave you run:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
node2# nc 192.168.1.1 5000 | dd of=/dev/hda bs=64k
&lt;/source&gt;

where 192.168.1.1 is the ip of the golden slave. This presupposes the disk of soon-to-be slave is at least as big as the disk in the golden slave. 

This took several hours time (it said 158GB read/written), but it worked.

GNU Screen can help you speed up the configuration. On a side note, using screen the above two scripts could be already used for parallelization of computing tasks, however there are dedicated protocols for more advanced usage, you might want to have resource balancing, for example. 

To create more users, create them on node0 and node1. Then from node1 you copy /etc/passwd and /etc/group to the other slaves.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

The general concept of ‘searching’ is about looking for something. For example, we want to drive to some destination and we need to find the car key. Locating the car key is a simple search problem. In computer science, searching techniques are strategies that look for solutions to a problem in a search space. The solutions or ‘goal states’ could sometimes be an object, a goal, a sub-goal or a path to the searched item. In the car key example, the search goal is the car key and the search space is confined to the owner’s home. The car key can be located anywhere in the owner’s house.

In general, a computer search problem has the following characteristics:

*	A goal state – the definition of a need
*	An initial state – a current position or a set of conditions
*	A set of actions -  strategies and actions to select and evaluate an option in the search space
*	Goal test criteria – criteria used to test if an option is a solution
*	A path cost - the cost of the actions in a search path

== Search Space ==

The search space can be represented by a ‘graph’ which is based on graph theory. The ‘graph’ structure is not to be confused with the graphs that the readers might have learned from their regular mathematics courses. A computer ‘tree’ data structure is a special kind of graph. A tree has a root node on the top of the structure and it has at most one path to each node. Each node may be connected to a lower level of neighbors which are called child nodes (successors). Nodes that have no children are called leaf nodes.

Using the car key example, the owner’s home is defined as the search space. It has the ‘home’ node as the root of a tree. The home node has three child nodes (the room nodes) and other child nodes such as desks and drawer in the rooms.
The set of possible permutations that can be examined by a search method in order to find a solution.

&lt;!-- Write a note here about the goal and intentions of this book --&gt;

== The Plan ==

The [[Embedded Systems]] book is sprawling and contains a lot of stubs on various topics, some of which are only tangentially related to the topic. I am thinking (but am not yet self-convinced) that this book could be better served if it was broken up into a series of smaller books on more focused topics.

== Books ==

=== [[Programming C and x86 Assembly]] ===

=== [[Embedded Hardware Design]] ===

=== [[Time-Critical Software]] ===

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Pathfinder Flag==
I wonder about the description of the Pathfinder flag ? I believe the sword = bible. I've listed the meanings as I understand them here.

*Sword = Bible

*Three sides to triangle = Completeness - Godhead and Tripod of Education Mental, Physical, and Spiritual

*Shield = protection of God, and by faith

*Red = Sacrifice
*White = Purity
*Blue = Loyalty
*Gold = Excellence

:Well, it looks like you've got a solid reference, so it should probably change.  I don't know where the meanings that are currently listed came from. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 00:11, 21 November 2008 (UTC)
:: OK - I made a minor edit to the symbol meanings. Of course I forgot to logon, so it only has my IP there :-( [[User:Jazzmanian|Gerald]] ([[User talk:Jazzmanian|talk]]) 16:02, 21 November 2008 (UTC)

==Sicilian==
==3. Nc3==

Most of the time in the Sicilian, White puts his Knight on c3. White may yet play d4, but for the moment the question is yet to be answered. White's second move suggests the possibility of NOT playing d4 (avoiding the exchange), and playing a closed position instead of the slashing, attacking types of position, that are more common to the Sicilian Defence. Leads to 
3.g3 g6 4.Bg2 Bg7 5.d3 d6

3...d6 
This is the main line and is a non-committal move.  Black retains flexibility to wait and see if white opens up the game with d4 or opts to keep it closed such as d3 and maybe c3 to prepare the hallmark d4 push and locking up the center.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hey! I'm Annalicious, as you can see from my name. I recentley joined Wikibooks (which I think is great, BTW), so I'm kinda like a newborn baby, just starting to see the wonders of the world (or in my case, the wonders of Wikibooks). If you coulds please help me to understans Wikibooks, I'm sure I'll get the hang of it super quick! This is my ''temporary'' page until I figure out how to work some things around here. Then it'll be bigger and better than ever! But, even if it is temporary, I figure I should tell you a bit about me anyway.

&lt;big&gt;My Hobbies&lt;/big&gt;

*Baking and Cooking
*Soccer
*Writing
*Music (listening, not playing or singing)
*Shopping
*Volleyball
*Checking e-mail :)


I hope I can dazzle you all with my stupendous textbooks I'll start making soon! And remember, please just help me with nice reminders and go easy on the critizing, as I ''am'' new.

Thanks! I hope you'll find me, and my articles, stupedious and delicous, hence the name!

      <comment>/* Propositions */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Overheard on the bus…

: &quot;I’ve heard it said that wearing a hat leads to baldness.&quot;

: &quot;Oh really?  I’ve heard that bald men are generally good tempered.&quot;

: &quot;In that case, I’m glad to see that Jones has started wearing a hat.  His temper has been rather short lately!&quot;


In conventional algebra, letters and symbols are used to represent numbers and the operations associated with them: +, -, &amp;times;, &amp;divide;, etc. Doing so can help simplify and solve complex problems.  In ''Logic'', we seek to express statements, and the connections between them in algebraic symbols - again with the object of simplifying complicated ideas.  Unfortunately, like ordinary algebra, the opposite seems true initially.  This is probably because simple examples always seem easier to solve by common-sense methods!
== Propositions ==

A '''''proposition''''' is a statement which has ''truth value'':  it is either ''true'' (T) or ''false'' (F).

''Example 1''

Which of the following are propositions?

: (a) 17 + 25 = 42

: (b) July 4 occurs in the winter in the Northern Hemisphere.

: (c) The population of the United States is less than 250 million.

: (d) Is the moon round?

: (e) 7 is greater than 12.

: (f) ''x'' is greater than ''y''.


''Answers''

: (a) is a proposition; and of course it has the 'truth value' ''true''.

: (b) is a proposition. Of course, it's ''false'', but it's still a proposition.

: (c) is a proposition, but we may not actually ''know'' whether it's ''true'' or ''false''. Nevertheless, the fact is that the statement itself ''is'' a proposition, because it is definitely either ''true'' or ''false''.

: (d) is not a proposition. It's a question.

: (e) is a proposition.  It's ''false'' again, of course 7&gt;12.

: (f) is a bit more debatable!  It's certainly a ''potential'' proposition, but until we know the values of ''x'' and ''y'', we can't actually say whether it is ''true'' or ''false''. Note that this isn't quite the same as (c), where we may not know the truth value because we aren't well-enough informed.  See the next paragraph.


=== Propositional Functions ===

A ''function'' is, loosely defined, an operation that takes as input one or more ''parameter values'', and produces a single, well-defined output.


You're probably familiar with the sine and cosine functions in trigonometry, for example.  These are examples of functions that take a single number (the size of an angle) as an input and produce a decimal number (which in fact will lie between +1 and -1) as output.


If we want to, we can define a function of our own, say ''RectangleArea'', which could take ''two'' numbers (the length and width of a rectangle) as input, and produce a single number as output (formed by multiplying the two input numbers together).


In (f) above, we have an example of a '''''Propositional Function'''''.  This is a function that produces as output not a number like sine, cosine or ''RectangleArea'', but a ''truth value''.  It's a statement, then, that becomes a proposition when it is supplied with one or more parameter values.  In (f), the parameters are ''x'' and ''y''.  So if ''x'' = 2 and ''y'' = 7, its output is ''False''; if ''x'' = 4 and ''y'' = -10, its output is ''True''.

=== Notation ===

We shall often represent propositions by lower-case letters ''p'', ''q'', ...

== Compound Propositions ==

Propositions may be modified by means of one or more ''logical operators'' to form what are called '''''compound propositions'''''.

There are three logical operators:

*: conjunction: &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; meaning AND

*: disjunction: &amp;or; meaning OR

*: negation: &amp;not; meaning NOT


''Example 2''

: ''p'' represents the proposition &quot;Henry VIII had six wives&quot;.

: ''q'' represents the proposition &quot;The English Civil War took place in the nineteenth century&quot;.

:(a) Connect these two propositions with OR.  Is the resulting compound proposition true or false?

: (b) Now connect them with AND.  Is this compound proposition true or false?

: (c) Is the 'opposite' of ''p'' true or false?


''Answers''

:(a) ''p'' &amp;or; ''q'' is &quot;Henry VIII had six wives or the English Civil War took place in the  nineteenth century&quot;

: This is ''true''. The first part of the compound proposition is true, and this is sufficient to make the whole statement true – if a little odd-sounding!


If you think that this example seems very artificial, imagine that you're taking part in a History Quiz; there are two questions left, and you need to get at least one right to win the quiz.  You make the two statements above about Henry VIII and the Civil War.  Do you win the quiz?  Yes, because it is true that either Henry VIII had six wives or the English Civil War took place in the nineteenth century.


Note that this is an ''inclusive'' OR: in other words, we don't rule out ''both'' parts being true.  So ''p'' &amp;or; ''q'' means &quot;Either ''p'' is true, or ''q'' is true, or both&quot;.


:(b)  ''p'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; ''q'' is &quot;Henry VIII had six wives and the English Civil War took place in the  nineteenth century&quot;

: This is ''false''.


To be true, both parts would have to be true.  This is equivalent to your needing ''both'' questions right to win the quiz.  You fail, because you got the second one wrong.


: (c) The opposite of ''p'', which we write as &amp;not;''p'', is &quot;Henry VIII did not have six wives&quot;.  This is clearly false.  And in general, if ''p'' is true, then &amp;not;''p'' is false, and vice versa.


''Example 3''

:''p'' is &quot;The printer is off-line&quot;

:''q'' is &quot;The printer is out of paper&quot;

:&quot;r&quot; is &quot;The document has finished printing&quot;

:Write as English sentences, in as natural a way as you can:

:(a) ''p'' &amp;or; ''q''

: (b) ''r'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; ''q''

: (c) ''q'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; &amp;not;''r''

: (d) &amp;not;(''p'' &amp;or; ''q'')


''Answers''

:(a) The printer is off-line or out of paper.


Notice how we often leave words out when we're writing or speaking English.  This sounds much more natural than &quot;The printer is off-line or the printer is out of paper&quot;.


:(b) The document has finished printing and the printer is out of paper.


The subject of each part of the sentence is different now, so no words are missing this time.


:(c) The printer is out of paper and the document has not finished printing.


''But'' and ''And''

The statement in (c) could be someone reporting a problem, and they might equally well say:

: (c) The printer is out of paper ''but'' the document has not finished printing.


So note that, in logic, ''but'' and ''and'' mean the ''same thing''.  It's just that we use ''but'' to introduce a note of contrast or surprise.  For example, we might well say:

*: The sun is shining brightly, ''but'' it's freezing cold outside.

Logically, we could use ''and'' to connect both parts of this sentence, but(!) it's more natural to use ''but''.


In (d) what does &amp;not;(''p'' &amp;or; ''q'') mean? Well, ''p'' &amp;or; ''q'' means either ''p'' is true or ''q'' is true (or both).  When we place &amp;not; in front, we negate this.  So it means (literally):

*: It is not true that either the printer is off-line or the printer is out of paper.


In other words:

: (d) The printer is neither off-line nor out of paper.


Notice that it's often convenient to translate &amp;not; using the phrase 'It is not true that …'.

== Truth Tables ==

Consider the possible values of the compound proposition ''p'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; ''q'' for various combinations of values of ''p'' and ''q''.  The only combination of values that makes ''p'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; ''q'' true is where ''p'' and ''q'' are ''both true''; any other combination will include a ''false'' and this will render the whole compound proposition false. On the other hand, the compound proposition ''p'' &amp;or; ''q'' will be true if ''either p'' or ''q'' (or both) is true; the only time ''p'' &amp;or; ''q'' is false is when both ''p'' and ''q'' are false.


We summarise conclusions like these in what is called a '''''Truth Table''''', the truth table for AND being:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;left&quot;
| ''p''
| ''q''
| ''p'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; ''q''
|-

|-
| T
| F
| F
|-
| F
| T
| F
|-
| F
| F
| F
|}
&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;&gt;


The truth table for OR is:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;left&quot;
| ''p''
| ''q''
| ''p'' &amp;or; ''q''
|-

&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;&gt;


=== The order of the Rows in a Truth Table ===

Notice the pattern of T's and F's in the first two columns of each of the truth tables above. In the first column (the truth values of ''p''), there are 2 T's followed by 2 F's; in the second (the values of ''q''), the T's and F's change on ''each row''. We shall adopt this order of the rows throughout this text. Adopting a convention for the order of the rows in a Truth Table has two advantages:

*: It ensures that all combinations of T and F are included.  (That may be easy enough with just two propositions and only four rows in the Truth Table; it's not so easy with, say, 4 propositions where there will be 16 rows in the table.)

*: It produces a standard, recognisable output pattern of T's and F's.  So, for example, T, F, F, F is the output pattern (or 'footprint' if you like) of AND (&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt;), and T, T, T, F is the footprint of OR (&amp;or;).

=== The truth table for NOT ===

Each of the two truth tables above had two 'input' columns (one for the values of ''p'' and one for ''q''), and one 'output' column. They each needed four rows, of course, because there are four possible combinations of T's and F's when two propositions are combined.  The truth table for NOT (&amp;not;) will be simpler, since &amp;not; is a ''unary'' operation – one that requires a single proposition as input.  So it just two columns – an input and an output – and two rows.

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;left&quot;
| ''p''
| &amp;not;''p''
|-
| T
| F
|-
| F
| T
|}
&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;&gt;

=== Drawing up Truth Tables ===

The method for drawing up a truth table for any compound expression is described below, and four examples then follow. It is important to adopt a rigorous approach and to keep your work neat: there are plenty of opportunities for mistakes to creep in, but with care this is a very straightforward process, no matter how complicated the expression is. So:

*: ''Step 1: Rows''
*: Decide how many rows the table will require. One input requires only two rows; two inputs require 4 rows; three require 8, and so on. If there are ''n'' propositions in the expression, 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; rows will be needed.  

*:''Step 2: Blank Table''
*: Draw up a blank table, with the appropriate number of input columns and rows, and a single output column wide enough to accommodate comfortably the output expression. If 8 or more rows are needed, you'll probably find it helps to rule a horizontal line across the table every ''four'' rows, in order to keep your rows straight.

*: ''Step 3: Input Values''
*: Fill in all the input values, using the convention above for the Order of Rows in a Truth Table; that is to say, begin with the ''right-most'' input column and fill in the values T and F, alternating on ''every'' row. Then move to the next column to the left, and fill in T's and F's changing on ''every second'' row. And so on for all the remaining columns. The left-most column will then contain T's in the first half of all the rows in the table, and F's in the second half.

*:''Step 4: Plan your strategy''
*: Study carefully the ''order'' in which the operations involved in evaluating the expression are carried out, taking note of any brackets there may be. As in conventional algebra, you don't necessarily work from left to right.  For example, the expression ''p'' &amp;or; &amp;not;''q'' will involve working out &amp;not;''q'' first, then combining the result with ''p'' using &amp;or;. When you've worked out the order in which you need to carry out each of the operations, rule additional columns under the ''output'' expression - one for each stage in the evaluation process.  Then number each of the columns (at its foot) in the order in which it will be evaluated.  The column representing the '''final output''' will be the last stage in the evaluation process, and will therefore have the highest number at its foot.

*: ''Step 5: Work down the columns''
*: The final stage is to work '''down each column''' in the order that you've written down in ''Step 4''.  To do this, you'll use the truth tables for AND, OR and NOT above using values from the input columns and any other columns that have already been completed. Remember: work ''down the columns'', not across the rows. That way, you'll only need to think about one operation at a time.


You're probably thinking that this all sounds incredibly complicated, but a few examples should make the method clear.


=== Worked examples ===

''Example 4''

Produce truth tables for:

: (a) &amp;not;(&amp;not;''p'')

: (b) ''p'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; (&amp;not;''q'')

: (c) (''p'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; ''q'') &amp;or; (&amp;not;''p'' &amp;or; &amp;not;''q'')

: (d) ''q'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; (''p'' &amp;or; ''r'')


''Solutions''

(a) &amp;not;(&amp;not;''p'') is pretty obviously the same as ''p'' itself, but we'll still use the above method in this simple case, to show how it works, before moving on to more complicated examples.  So:

*: ''Step 1: Rows''

There's just one input variable here, so we shall need two rows.


*:''Step 2: Blank Table''

So the table is: 
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;left&quot;
| ''p''
| &amp;not;(&amp;not;''p'')
|-
|.
| 
|-
|.
| 
|}
&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;&gt;


*: ''Step 3: Input Values''

Next, we fill in the input values: just one T and one F in this case:
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;left&quot;
| ''p''
| &amp;not;(&amp;not;''p'')
|-
| T
| 
|-
| F
| 
|}
&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;&gt;


*:''Step 4: Plan your strategy''

As in 'ordinary' algebra we evaluate whatever's in brackets first, so we shall first (1) complete the (&amp;not;''p'') values, followed (2) by the left-hand &amp;not; symbol, which gives us the final output values of the whole expression.  We rule an extra column to separate these two processes, and write the (1) and (2) at the foot of these two columns.  Thus:
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;left&quot;
| ''p''
| &amp;not;
| (&amp;not;''p'')
|-
| T
| 
|
|-
| F
| 
| 
|-
|
| (2)
Output
| (1)
|}
&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;&gt;


*: ''Step 5: Work down the columns''

Finally we insert the values in column (1) – F followed by T – and then use ''these'' values to insert the values in column (2).  So the completed truth table is:
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;left&quot;
| ''p''
| &amp;not;
| (&amp;not;''p'')
|-
| T
| T 
| F
|-
| F
| F
| T
|-
|
| (2)
Output
| (1)
|}
&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;&gt;


As we said at the beginning of this example, &amp;not;(&amp;not;''p'') is clearly the same as ''p'', so the pattern of the output values, T followed by F, is identical to the pattern of the input values.  Although this may seem trivial, the same technique works in much more complex examples, where the results are far from obvious!


(b) ''p'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; (&amp;not;''q'')

*: ''Step 1''

There are two input variables, ''p'' and ''q'', so we shall need four rows in the table.


*:''Steps 2 &amp; 3''

In the ''q'' column write T's and F's alternating on every row; in the ''p'' column alternate every two rows.  At this stage, the table looks like this:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;left&quot;
| ''p''
| ''q''
| ''p'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; (&amp;not;''q'')
|-
| T
| T
| 
|-
| T
|  F
| 
|-
| F
| T
| 
|-
| F
| F
| 
|}
&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;&gt;


*:''Steps 4 &amp; 5''

As ''Example (a)'', we begin (1) by evaluating the expression in brackets, (&amp;not;''q''), and then (2) we combine these results with ''p'' using the &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; operator.  So we divide the output section of the table into two columns; then work down column (1) and finally column (2).  The completed table is:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;left&quot;
| ''p''
| ''q''
| ''p'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt;
| (&amp;not;''q'')
|-
| T
| T
| F
| F

| T

|-
| F
| F
| F
| T
|-
|
|
| (2)
output
| (1)
|}
&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;&gt;


(c) (''p'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; ''q'') &amp;or; (&amp;not;''p'' &amp;or; &amp;not;''q'')

*: ''Steps 1 to 3''

As in ''Example (b)''.


*:''Steps 4 &amp; 5''

There will be 5 stages in evaluating the expression (''p'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; ''q'') &amp;or; (&amp;not;''p'' &amp;or; &amp;not;''q''). In order, they are:

: (1) The first bracket: (''p'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; ''q'')

: (2) The &amp;not;''p'' in the second bracket

: (3) The &amp;not;''q'' in the second bracket

: (4) The &amp;or; in the second bracket

: (5) The &amp;or; between the two brackets.  This final stage, then, represents the output of the complete expression.


''Reminder:'' Don't work '''across''' the rows; work '''down''' the columns in order (1) to (5). That way, you'll only have to deal with a single operation at a time.

The completed table is:
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;left&quot;
| ''p''
| ''q''
| (''p'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; ''q'')

Notice that the output consist solely of T's.  This means that (''p'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; ''q'') &amp;or; (&amp;not;''p'' &amp;or; &amp;not;''q'') is always ''true'' whatever the values of ''p'' and ''q''.  It is therefore a ''tautology'' ([[#Tautology|see below]]).


(d) ''q'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; (''p'' &amp;or; ''r'')

This simple expression involves 3 input variables, and therefore requires 2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 8 rows in its truth table.  When drawing this truth table by hand, rule a line below row 4 as an aid to keeping your working neat. It is shown as a double line in this table.  The completed table is shown below.

=== Tautology ===

An expression which always has the value ''true'' is called a '''''tautology'''''.

In addition, any statement which is redundant, or idempotent, is also referred to as a tautology, and for the same reason previously mentioned.  If '''P''' is True then we can be sure that '''P &amp;or; P''' is true, and '''P &amp;and; P''' is also true.

== Logic Exercise 2 ==

Click link for [[/Exercises#Logic Exercise 2|Logic Exercise 2]].

== Order of Precedence ==

In 'ordinary' algebra, the order of precedence in carrying out operations is:

: 1 brackets

: 2 exponents (powers)

: 3 &amp;times; and &amp;divide;

: 4 + and - 


In the algebra of logic, brackets will often be inserted to make clear the order in which operations are to be carried out.  To avoid possible ambiguity, the agreed rules of precedence are:

: 1 brackets
: 2 NOT (&amp;not;)
: 3 AND (&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt;)
: 4 OR (&amp;or;)


So, for example, ''p'' &amp;or; ''q'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; ''r'' means:

: Evaluate ''q'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; ''r'' first.

: Then combine the result with ''p'' &amp;or;.

Since it would be easy to misinterpret this, it is recommended that brackets are included, even if they are not strictly necessary.  So ''p'' &amp;or; ''q'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; ''r'' will often be written ''p'' &amp;or; (''q'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; ''r'').

== Logically Equivalent Propositions ==

Look back to your answers to questions 2 and 3 in [[/Exercises#Logic Exercise 2|''Exercise 2'']].  In each question, you should have found that the last columns of the truth tables for each pair of propositions were the same. 

Whenever the final columns of the truth tables for two propositions ''p'' and ''q'' are the same, we say that ''p'' and ''q'' are '''''logically equivalent''''', and we write:

: ''p'' &amp;equiv; ''q''


''Example 5''

Construct truth tables for 

: (i) ''p'' &amp;or; (''q'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; ''r''), and

: (ii) (''p'' &amp;or; ''q'') &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; (''p'' &amp;or; ''r''),

and hence show that these propositions are logically equivalent.

We recognise the output: T, F, F, F as the 'footprint' of the [[#Truth Tables|AND]] operation.  So we can simplify &amp;not;(&amp;not;''p'' &amp;or; &amp;not;''q'') to

: ''p'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; ''q''

== Laws of Logic ==

Like sets, logical propositions form what is called a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra Boolean Algebra]: the [[../Set_theory/Page_2#The_Laws_of_Sets|laws that apply to sets]] have corresponding laws that apply to propositions also.  Namely:


''Commutative Laws''

: ''p'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; ''q'' &amp;equiv; ''q'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; ''p''

: ''p'' &amp;or; ''q'' &amp;equiv; ''q'' &amp;or; ''p''


''Associative Laws''

:(''p'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; ''q'') &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; ''r'' &amp;equiv; ''p'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; (''q'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; ''r'')

: (''p'' &amp;or; ''q'') &amp;or; ''r'' &amp;equiv; ''p'' &amp;or; (''q'' &amp;or; ''r'')


''Distributive Laws''

:''p'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; (''q'' &amp;or; ''r'') &amp;equiv; (''p'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; ''q'') &amp;or; (''p'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; ''r'')

: ''p'' &amp;or; (''q'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; ''r'') &amp;equiv; (''p'' &amp;or; ''q'') &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; ( ''p'' &amp;or; ''r'')


''Idempotent Laws''

: ''p'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; ''p'' &amp;equiv; ''p''

: ''p'' &amp;or; ''p'' &amp;equiv; ''p''


''Identity Laws''

: ''p'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; F &amp;equiv; F

: ''p'' &amp;or; F &amp;equiv; ''p''

: ''p'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; T &amp;equiv; ''p''

: ''p'' &amp;or; T &amp;equiv; T


''Involution Law''

: &amp;not;(&amp;not;''p'') &amp;equiv; ''p'' 


''De Morgan’s Laws''

: &amp;not;(''p'' &amp;or; ''q'') &amp;equiv; (&amp;not;''p'') &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; (&amp;not;''q'') 
: (sometimes written ''p'' NOR ''q'')

: &amp;not;(''p'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; ''q'') &amp;equiv; (&amp;not;''p'') &amp;or; (&amp;not;''q'') 
: (sometimes written ''p'' NAND ''q'')


''Complement Laws''

:''p'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; &amp;not;''p'' &amp;equiv; F

: ''p'' &amp;or; &amp;not;''p'' &amp;equiv; T

:&amp;not;T &amp;equiv; F

: &amp;not;F &amp;equiv; T


=== Worked Examples ===

''Example 7''

Propositional functions ''p'', ''q'' and ''r'' are defined as follows:

: ''p'' is &quot;''n'' = 7&quot;

: ''q'' is &quot;''a'' &gt; 5&quot;

: ''r'' is &quot;''x'' = 0&quot;

Write the following expressions in terms of ''p'', ''q'' and ''r'', and show that each pair of expressions is logically equivalent. State carefully which of the above laws are used at each stage.

(a)
: ((''n'' = 7) &amp;or; (''a'' &gt; 5)) &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; (''x'' = 0)
: ((''n'' = 7) &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; (''x'' = 0)) &amp;or; ((''a'' &gt; 5) &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; (''x'' = 0))

(b)
: &amp;not;((''n'' = 7) &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; (''a'' &amp;le; 5))
: (''n'' &amp;ne; 7) &amp;or; (''a'' &gt; 5)

(c)
: (''n'' = 7) &amp;or; (&amp;not;((''a'' &amp;le; 5) &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; (''x'' = 0)))
: ((''n'' = 7) &amp;or; (''a'' &gt; 5)) &amp;or; (''x'' &amp;ne; 0)


''Solutions''

(a)
: (''p'' &amp;or; ''q'') &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; ''r''
: (''p'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; ''r'') &amp;or; (''q'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; ''r'')

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;left&quot;
| (''p'' &amp;or; ''q'') &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; ''r''
| = ''r'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; (''p'' &amp;or; ''q'') 
| ''Commutative Law''
|-
|
| = (''r'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; ''p'') &amp;or; ''r'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; ''q'') 
| ''Distributive Law''
|-
| 
| = (''p'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; ''r'') &amp;or; (''q'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; ''r'')
| ''Commutative Law'' (twice)
|}
&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;&gt;

(b)

First, we note that
: &amp;not;''q'' is &quot;''a'' &amp;le; 5&quot;; and
: &amp;not;''p'' is &quot;''n'' &amp;ne; 7&quot;.

So the expressions are:
: &amp;not;(''p'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; &amp;not;''q'')
: &amp;not;''p'' &amp;or; ''q''

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;left&quot;
| &amp;not;(''p'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; &amp;not;''q'')
| = &amp;not;''p'' &amp;or; &amp;not;(&amp;not;''q'')
|''De Morgan's Law''
|-
|
| = &amp;not;''p'' &amp;or; ''q''
|''Involution Law''
|}
&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;&gt;


(c)

First, we note that
: &amp;not;''r'' is &quot;''x'' &amp;ne; 0&quot;.

So the expressions are:
: ''p'' &amp;or; (&amp;not;(&amp;not;''q'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; ''r''))
: (''p'' &amp;or; ''q'') &amp;or; &amp;not;''r''

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;left&quot;
| ''p'' &amp;or; (&amp;not;(&amp;not;''q'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; ''r''))
| = ''p'' &amp;or; (&amp;not;(&amp;not;''q'') &amp;or; &amp;not;''r'')
|''De Morgan's Law''
|-
|
| = ''p'' &amp;or; (''q'' &amp;or; &amp;not;''r'')
|''Involution Law''
|-
|
| = (''p'' &amp;or; ''q'') &amp;or; &amp;not;''r''

Hi George glee,

I just had a look at your work on the Swimming honor.  I added the requirements back in, and then noticed that you had gone through and added a bunch of answers before subtracting them out again.  Well... that's a bit confusing to me.  Did you write those answers, or did you copy them from somewhere else?  If you copied them, was a it from a source that allows copying?  Should I add them back again?  I'm confused! --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 13:31, 21 November 2008 (UTC)</text>

'''Stratosphere'''
This layer of atmosphere is continuing to Troposphere. The range of atmosphere in this layer is 20 – 48 km. The border of Troposphere and Stratosphere we called “Tropopause” and the higher border is connecting to Ozone layer. The temperature at 20 km. is starting at -60 Degree Celsius. The temperature will increase 2 Degree Celsius in every kilometer of height. At 48 km. from ground the air temperature is 0 Deg. Celsius.
The component of the atmosphere in this layer is 19.9 percent of air mass. However, the weather in this layer is well than stratosphere, because the air is dryer than stratosphere. If we are compare the density of air mass in this layer and the lower layer. We will know the density of air mass in this layer is big lighter than the lower layer. Some groups of cirrus clouds will buoyant in this layer. For airplanes, they will cruise in the lower attitude of this layer.

You want a generic tool for testing a REST web service.  You want to be able to put in a URI and an instance document and see what data is returned.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|How is mobile work affecting productivity?}}

Productivity is a multidimensional term and its meaning can vary depending on the context in which it used.  It is widely agreed that mobile work in general have an impact on the output on the company and thus, on productivity.  And today enterprises are moving towards mobility.  Mobile work has evolved from being simple communication devices to a productivity tool for the professionals on the move.  As they have greater functionality enterprise mobile work can perform better and at higher speeds giving professionals the edges, required to survive in the highly competitive market.  They are becoming the lifeline providing them with not just connectivity, 24-7, but also the opportunity to increase productivity and build profit.

==Applications==
More and more applications are being loaded on these mobile devices making them stronger productivity options for the enterprise users.  There have been two kinds of adoption, one where the enterprise goes with planned purchase to integrate mobile applications within the organization, and the other where employees bring their own devices, which is more relevant in India.  Today a professional can hold conferences, transfer data, access updates and information, all on the move through these mobile devices. To study how wireless-enabled mobile technology impact productivity, Intel studied more than 100 Intel employees in different offices around the United States by providing then with the Intel Centrino mobile technology notebook bundles. The pace at which the participants’ work productivity increased during the study.  Intel observed a productivity gain of 37.3 which confirmed its business decision to migrate to mobile work.  

==Mobility==
There has been a significant amount of convergence of application in the mobile devices segment.  Now feature loaded enterprise devices such as smart phones come with in built digital cameras and other features, which provide them with greater functionality and improved efficiency.  Earlier the enterprises believed that most of applications would be data centric but the trend in last couple of years has seen voice as an integral part of applications.  A number of players churned out PDAs in the last year but if we compare the shipments of smart phones to PDAs in last year it's 4:1.  Whether to choose a smart phone or a PDA depends on the requirements of an organization.  However, the enterprise has a clear idea of what is the ideal device to be used and then they bracket it in term of cost, functionality, etc.  Mobility has become a crucial factor for the enterprise today which forms an integral part of its growth strategy.

==Future==
With mobile devices becoming cheaper and services more affordable, the option to go mobile work is not a distant dream in the future.  Mobile smart phones and PDAs are moving towards becoming the perfect solution for all enterprise woes of connectivity and communication.  By adopting mobile works enterprises can better coordinate resources within the enterprise leading to improved asset utilization.  By simultaneously vertically integrating, enterprises overcome haggling and hold-up costs associated with implementing mobile work, which allows them to leverage the productiviy of the technology across the enterprise.  Thus there may create a suggestion that adoption of mobile work improves enterprise performance through improved coordination but requires the enterprise to shift toward an increasingly vertically integrated structure to fully capture the benefits of mobile work.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The coastline is made up of a whole sequence of landforms, that owe their existence to the work of waves.

Waves are caused by the wind's friction over the sea surface.  The wind tugs at the surface, causing the wave shape to move.  The height of a wave depends on the speed of the wind, how long it has been blowing and the [[GCSE_Geography/Glossary#Fetch|fetch]].  Any increase in any of these factors will cause the wave height to increase.

Wave changes shape in shallow coastal waters, which causes it to break.

The table shows how to calculate the ratios by multiplying the row and column headings together. e.g.

&lt;big&gt;''Gross Profit Margin % = ''&lt;/big&gt; &lt;math&gt;\frac{Gross Profit \times 100%}{Sales} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;big&gt;''Earnings per Share = ''&lt;/big&gt; &lt;math&gt;\frac{Profit after Tax}{No. of Ordinary Shares} &lt;/math&gt;

== Also ==


::Sales = Turnover

::Equity = Ordinary Share Capital + Reserves

::Debt = Long Term Liabilities = Non-Current Liabilities

::Capital Employed = Equity + Debt

::Asset Turnover = Sales / (Fixed Assets + Net Current Assets)

::Fixed Assets + Net Current Assets = Equity + Debt (Accounting Equation)

::ROCE = Operating Profit Margin x Asset Turnover

===Physical weathering===
Also known as freeze-thaw or frost action by some textbooks, this process is where water enters a rock cavity and freezes.  As it freezes, it expands, forcing the crack wider.  The ice thaws, leaving a larger gap than previously.  More water enters and freezes, forcing the gap yet wider.  Over time, the process continues until the rock is pried away.  This is common in highland areas where the temperature is above freezing in daytime, but below freezing during the night.

===Chemical Weathering or Carbonation===
As rain falls, it absorbs a small amount of carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and forms weak carbonic acid.  When it reaches the ground and soaks into the soil, it absorbs yet more CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from decomposing plants.  This strong acid easily dissolves any rock which contains more than around 50% calcium carbonate (such as limestone or chalk), leaving very little behind.  The chemical reaction involved is as follows:&lt;br/&gt;CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3(s)&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; → Ca(HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2(aq)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;br/&gt;''&lt;small&gt;Calcium carbonate + Carbonic acid → Calcium hydrogen carbonate&lt;/small&gt;''

===Biological Weathering===
This is the action of animals and plants on the land.  Plant roots grow between rocks and, as they grow, they slowly prise them apart.  Rabbits and other burrowing animals can also be responsible for this rock break-up.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Saying goodbye is not something that most people would want to go through before committing suicide. However most anyone who is considering the idea is probably so far into their own emotions that they probably don't care. So, the easiest thing to do is gather everyone to whom you wish to say goodbye to and tell them with all due honesty about the situation. Telling each person individually is also an option, if you wish to relive the moment again and again. Another option is to leave a suicide note. As for what goes in the note, you won't find that in this section but it's always an option. Lastly if you just wish to not go through the process, you can commit the act and leave your loved ones to handle it themselves. A good idea is to make the last time you were with them a happy and fun experience, because this is most likely the last image they'll hold of you. You can always skip the &quot;formalities&quot; altogether and commit suicide, plain and simple.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The suicide note or death note usually, states the reason(s) for the writer emotional and physical state and reiterates the suicidal tendencies that, if acted upon, will result in an attempt to end the writers life.

As to what actually goes in the note is more of a personal nature. Some only wish to state the reason why they are to destroy their existence from the world and justify their actions. Others may wish to state how they want their body to be disposed of, whether by cremation, coffin burial, or any other form that they may have chosen. Yet others would like to leave their possessions to said individual(s) whom they have addressed by name in the letter. 

Beyond these archetypes the possibilities are limitless. The suicide note could contain anything. Perhaps it is the lyrics of a song the writer liked, maybe its a hate note to an individual, it could even be a blank note with the words 'suicide note' written on it for the sole purpose of comedic affect. No matter the reason, a suicide note, if truly meant, is composed by the writer with all and any emotion, thought, idea, or reason that the writer has chosen to leave behind for whatever reason.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want a script that will display a small thumbnail of all the images in an image collection.  The images may have many file suffixes (jpg, png, gif etc).

== Method ==
We will write an XQuery that finds all the child resources in the collection that have the correct file types.

== Source Code ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;
declare option exist:serialize &quot;method=xhtml media-type=text/html&quot;;

(: look for the collection parameter in the incoming URL.  If not assume a default collection like /db/images. :)
let $collection := request:get-parameter('collection', '/db/images')

(: you can also change the number of images per row :)
let $images-per-row := xs:integer(request:get-parameter('images-per-row', 10))

(: first get all the files in the collection :)
let $all-files := xmldb:get-child-resources($collection)

(: now just get the files with known image file type extensions :)
let $image-files :=
   for $file in $all-files[

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Persuading the Reader ==
 
In order to create persuasive and effective professional documents, it is important to develop a persuasive style. Almost every document you will write will try to persuade or inform the readers. What is important to take into account is that readers have viewpoints on everything they are looking at so sometimes you want to be more or less obvious in your persuasive style. It begins with an initial thought and continues to change throughout the time they are looking at your document. It is important to realize that readers goals, concerns, feelings, and responses are likely to change from situation to situation. '''You may use your persuasive powers to change your readers' attitudes by reversing an attitude that they have, by reinforcing your attitude and by shaping their attitude on a subject which they currently have no opinion.''' The following points are centered around being able to successfully communicate with the readers, so your documents can correctly persuade or inform the readers the way they are suppose to.

-It is important to help your readers locate the valuable information first. In professional documents you often can see that the main idea and purpose is stated in the first paragraph and usually in the first few sentences. This is unlike papers that you may have written in regular writing classes throughout your time in school. Use headings, topic sentences, and lists to guide your readers towards specific points and information that you would like them to comprehend. Then later in the document you can go onto explaining why your points make sense. Your first goal should be to give them a reason to read on. If they don't care to listen to you, you won't be able to persuade them of anything.

-Use easy to read styles to make it readable to all levels. Take away unnecessary or more inter specific wording to make sure that your document can be understood. Put in action words to effectively make your point. Use low impact versions to make it easier to read, and so people can read the document faster. This is especially important in business. Managers and executives are extremely busy, all the time. They want to be able to find the information they need right away, so they don't waste time wading through filler. 

-Highlight persuasive points you are trying to make. Put main points in the beginning to capture the reader’s attention. Show how their actions will enable them to achieve their own goals. When deciding on what elements are persuasive, look at arguments that are credible and compelling to insure they believe what you are trying to say.

-Communicate with your readers. Before you write a document, understand who is going to be reading your documents and what their current beliefs are. This will allow you to write towards the correct set of people. Then when writing your document, ask readers how they will use the presented information and what they are looking for in the communication.

It is believed that if you cannot communicate with your readers, they will not understand the introduced concepts and strategies that are serving as a springboard into you argument. Without having a jumping point into your supportive information, you will not be effectively communicating your document. You also need to be creating an ethical dimension to you documents that are not going against any of you reader’s viewpoints and personal thoughts. It is said that you are suppose to be talking with your readers and not towards them. This is explaining that you are not directing them towards something they are not willing to pursue. Instead, direct them towards something they are considering and offer those ideas and concepts that can pursue them towards a certain idea.

==Advice for Persuading Your Readers==

'''1. Listen to Your Readers'''

Make sure that you listen to the audience's goals, needs, aims, and concerns. Things you hear can help structure your persuasive document successfully, or it may help improve the action or idea that is being advocated.

'''2. Understand Readers' Goals and Values'''

If you know your reader's goals and values, you can structure your communication in a way that produces favorable thoughts about your action or ideas.

'''3. Respond to Readers' Concerns and Counterarguments'''

Address your reader's concerns and counterarguments to show that you understand their points and values. 
#Ask questions such as: &quot;What do other people who have looked into this matter think?&quot;
#Offer a reason for relying on your position rather than the opposing position.

'''4. Reason Soundly'''

Use facts, statistics, and expert testimonies as evidence to show actuality of your idea or action.

'''5. Organize Your Communication'''

Organizing your communication will provide a favorable response from readers. 
#A direct organizational pattern goes directly to the main point and then presents evidence.
#An indirect organizational pattern presents evidence and related information before stating the main point.

'''6. Build a Relationship With the Reader'''

#Present yourself as a credible person by showing expertise, associating yourself as a member of a readers group, or using your position of authority.
#Present yourself as a friend by praising your readers, showing understanding of your readers, or maintaining a positive and helpful position. Avoid sounding confrontational. If you come across as attacking your readers view, your reader will shut down and become unreceptive. This is the easiest way to lose your readers attention.

'''7. Appeal to Readers' Emotions'''

Appealing to reader's emotions is considered inappropriate in scientific research reports, test reports, and many other communications. For some communications, appealing to emotions can be very successful. Emotional appeals are common among government agencies and private health providers advocating healthy lifestyles. Be sure to think carefully about whether emotional appeal is appropriate for a specific situation.

'''8. Adapt to Readers' Cultural Backgrounds'''

If you are writing to readers in a culture other than your own, you will need to cater your persuasive strategies to their values, beliefs, and norms. The best way to do this is to do your homework. You won't be able to completely adapt to your reader by listening to them alone. You will have to do some research to get some background when dealing with other cultures.

'''9. Persuade Ethically'''

You never want to mislead or manipulate your readers. This does not only deprive your readers of their rights, but if they come to find out about false statements you could be negatively affected.

'''10. Keep your goal realistic'''

When most adults make up their minds, that idea is set in their heads and becomes very difficult to change. It is important to keep this in mind. If you know that your reader is set in their ideas, trying to completely change their mind is going to be extremely difficult. Instead, try to get your reader to consider your view. If you can accomplish this, then you never know what might happen. If the reader has time to think on the idea, they might start to agree with you in time.

A soft diet is recommended in many situations, including some types of dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), surgery involving the jaw, mouth or gastrointestinal tract, and pain from newly adjusted dental braces.

A soft diet can include many foods if they are mashed or pureed, covered or placed with in sauces or gravy, or placed in soups, stews, chili, curries.

A soft diet might include:
* Cooked Hot cereals: oatmeal, porridge, Weetabix/Farina/Cream of Wheat, Cream of Rice.
* Breakfast cereals: Cheerios, Cornflakes, Corn Pops, Corn Chex, Rice Krispies), softened/soggy in milk.
* Macaroni &amp; Cheese (cooked soft, pureed in blender if needed.)
* Mashed potatoes and gravy
* Mashed sweet potatoes
* Pasta cooked soft
* Rice and gravy (cooked soft)
* Risotto
* Couscous
* Quinoa
* Baked potatoes (skinless) with sour cream or cream cheese
* Lasagna, chopped up with extra sauce over top.
* Asian fried rice or noodles with tiny bits of meat and soft veggies.
* Potato Salad, smooshed.
* muffin, pancake, or waffle. (if needed soften with syrup/butter and reheat.)

===c. Light===
This diet is culturally diverse, and includes the following:
*Food that is easy to digest.
*Not spicy


===d. Full===
A ''full diet'' is also sometimes referred to as a ''general diet''. It includes all food items, including drinks.

==3. Know the symptoms of a fever. Know how to take person's temperature. Know how to bring a high temperature DOWN.==
===Definition and Symptoms===
Fever is most accurately characterized as a temporary elevation in the body's thermoregulatory set-point, usually by about 1–2 °C.  Fever differs from hyperthermia. Hyperthermia is an increase in body temperature over the body's thermoregulatory set-point, due to excessive heat production or insufficient thermoregulation, or both. The person who is developing the fever has a cold sensation, and an increase in heart rate, muscle tone and shivering attempt to counteract the perceived hypothermia, thereby reaching the new thermoregulatory set-point. A fever is one of the body's mechanisms to try to neutralize the perceived threat inside the body, be it bacteria or a virus.

===Measurement and normal variation===
When a patient has or is suspected of having a fever, that person's body temperature is measured using a thermometer.  

At a first glance, fever is present if: 
* Temperature in the anus (rectum/rectal) or in the ear (otic) is at or over 38.0°C (100.4°F)
* Temperature in the mouth (oral) is at or over 37.5 °C (99.5 °F)
* Temperature under the arm (axillary) is at or over 37.2 °C (99.0 °F)

The common oral measurement of normal human body temperature is 36.8±0.7 °C (98.2±1.3 °F).  This means that any oral temperature between 36.1 and 37.5 °C (96.9 and 99.5 °F) is likely to be normal.

However, there are many variations in normal body temperature, and this needs to be considered when measuring for fever. The values given are for an otherwise healthy, non-fasting adult, dressed comfortably, indoors, in a room that is kept at a normal room temperature (22.7 to 24.4°C or 73 to 76 °F ) , during the morning, but not shortly after arising from sleep.  Furthermore, for oral temperatures, the subject must not have eaten, drunk, or smoked anything in at least the previous fifteen to twenty minutes.

Body temperature normally fluctuates over the day, with the lowest levels around 4 a.m. and the highest around 6 p.m. (assuming the subject follow the prevalent pattern, i.e., sleeping at nighttime and staying awake during daytime). Therefore, an oral temperature of 37.2 °C (99.0 °F) would strictly be a fever in the morning, but not in the afternoon. An oral body temperature reading up to 37.5 °C (99.5 °F) in the early/late afternoon or early/late evening also wouldn't be a fever. Normal body temperature may differ as much as 1.0 °F between individuals or from day to day. In women, temperature differs at various points in the menstrual cycle. Temperature is increased after eating, and psychological factors also influence body temperature.

There are different locations where temperature can be measured, and these differ in temperature variability. Tympanic membrane thermometers measure radiant heat energy from the tympanic membrane (infrared). These may be very convenient, but may also show more variability.

Children develop higher temperatures with activities like playing, but this is not fever because their set-point is normal. Elderly patients may have a decreased ability to generate body heat during a fever, so even a low-grade fever can have serious underlying causes in geriatrics.

===Treatment===
Fever should not necessarily be treated. Fever is an important signal that there's something wrong in the body, and it can be used to govern medical treatment and gauge its effectiveness. Moreover, not all fevers are of infectious origin.

Even when treatment is not indicated, however, febrile patients are generally advised to keep themselves adequately hydrated, as the dehydration produced by a mild fever can be more dangerous than the fever itself. Water is generally used for this purpose, but there is always a small risk of hyponatremia if the patient drinks too much water. For this reason, some patients drink sports drinks or electrolyte-replacing products designed specifically for this purpose.

Most people take medication against fever because the symptoms cause discomfort. Fever increases heart rate and metabolism, thus potentially putting an additional strain on elderly patients, patients with heart disease, etc. This may even cause delirium. Therefore, potential benefits must be weighed against risks in these patients. In any case, fever must be brought under control in instances when fever escalates to hyperpyrexia (temperature about 42°C) and tissue damage is imminent.

Treatment of fever is normally done by lowering the set-point, but facilitating heat loss may also be effective. The former is accomplished with antipyretics such as ibuprofen or acetominophen (aspirin can be given to adults, but can cause Reye's Syndrome in children). Heat removal is generally by wet cloth or pads, usually applied to the forehead, but also through bathing the body in tepid water. This is particularly important for babies, where drugs should be avoided. However, using water that is too cold can induce vasoconstriction, and reduce effective heat loss.

Heat loss may also be accomplished by heat conduction, convection, radiation, or evaporation (sweating, perspiration), or a combination of these.

==4. Know what is a normal pulse rate, respiration rate, and temperature. Practice taking the pulse rate, respiration rate, and temperature of a friend or classmate.==
===Pulse===
A normal pulse rate for a healthy adult, while resting, can range from 60 to 100 beats per minute (BPM), although well conditioned athletes may have a healthy pulse rate lower than 60 BPM. Bradycardia occurs when the pulse rate is below 60 per minute, whereas tachycardia occurs when the rate is above 100 BPM. During sleep, this can drop to as low as 40 BPM; during strenuous exercise, it can rise as high as 150–200 BPM. Generally, pulse rates are higher in infants and young children. The resting heart rate for an infant is usually close to an adult's pulse rate during strenuous exercise (average 110 BPM for an infant).

Pulses are manually palpated with fingers. When palpating the carotid artery, the femoral artery or the brachial artery, the thumb may be used. However, the thumb has its own pulse which can interfere with detecting the patient's pulse at other points, where two or three fingers should be used. Fingers or the thumb must be placed near an artery and pressed gently against a firm structure, usually a bone, in order to feel the pulse.

Make sure the person is calm and has been resting for 5 minutes before reading the pulse. Put the index and middle fingers over the pulse count, and count for 30 seconds, and afterwards multiply by 2, to get the pulse rate. If the person's pulse rate is irregular, count for a full minute, and do not multiply. Averaging multiple readings may give a more representative figure.

Home blood pressure measurement devices also typically give a pulse reading.
===Respiration Rate===
The human respiration rate is usually measured when a person is at rest and simply involves counting the number of breaths for one minute by counting how many times the chest rises. Respiration rates may increase with fever, illness, and with other medical conditions. When checking respiration, it is important to also note whether a person has any difficulty breathing.

Average respiratory rate reported in a healthy adult at rest is usually given as 12 breaths per minute but estimates do vary between sources: e.g. 12–20 breaths per minute, 10–14, and between 16–18, etc. With such a slow rate, more accurate readings are obtained by counting the number of breaths over a full minute.
===Temperature===
See requirement 3 for this information.

==5. What is a communicable disease? How is it transmitted? What precautions should be followed to guard against communicable diseases? List safety measures to be observed when caring for a person with a communicable disease in the home.==
===Definition===
An infectious disease is a clinically evident disease resulting from the presence of pathogenic microbial agents, including pathogenic viruses, pathogenic bacteria, fungi, protozoa, multicellular parasites, and aberrant proteins known as prions. These pathogens are able to cause disease in animals and/or plants.
===Transmission===
Infectious pathologies are usually qualified as contagious diseases (also called communicable diseases) due to their potentiality of transmission from one person or species to another. Transmission of an infectious disease may occur through one or more of diverse pathways including physical contact with infected individuals. These infecting agents may also be transmitted through liquids, food, body fluids, contaminated objects, airborne inhalation, or through vector-borne spread.
===Infection Control===
'''Infection control and health care epidemiology'''
is the discipline concerned with preventing the spread of infections within the health-care setting. 
As such, it is a practical (rather than an academic) sub-discipline of epidemiology.
It is an essential (though often underrecognized and undersupported) part of the infrastructure of health care.
Infection control and hospital epidemiology are akin to public health practice, practiced within the confines of a particular health-care delivery system rather than directed at society as a whole.

Infection control concerns itself both with prevention (hand hygiene/hand washing, cleaning/disinfection/sterilization, vaccination, surveillance) and with investigation and management of demonstrated or suspected spread of infection within a particular health-care setting (e.g. outbreak investigation). It is on this basis that the common title being adopted within health care is '''&quot;Infection Prevention &amp; Control&quot;.

===Infection control in healthcare facilities===
====Hand hygiene====
Independent studies by Ignaz Semmelweis in 1847 in Vienna and Oliver Wendell Holmes in 1843 in Boston established a link between the hands of health care workers and the spread of hospital-acquired disease. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has stated that “It is well-documented that the most important measure for preventing the spread of pathogens is effective handwashing.”  In the United States, hand washing is mandatory in most health care settings and required by many different state and local regulations as well as good sense.


====Cleaning, disinfection and sterilization====

Sterilization is a process intended to kill all microorganisms and is the highest level of microbial kill that is possible. Sterilizers may be heat only, steam, or liquid chemical.  Effectivness of the sterilizer (often called an autoclave&quot;) is determined in three ways.  First by the mechanical indicators and gauges on the machine itself, second the heat sensitive indicators or tape on the sterilizing bag turn color, and thirdly and most importantly is the biological test. With the biological test, a highly heat and chemical resistant microorganism (often the bacterial endospore) is selected as the standard challenge. If the process kills this microorganism, the sterilizer is considered to be effective. It should be noted that in order to be effective, instruments must be cleaned, otherwise the debris may form a protective barrier, shielding the microbes from the lethal process. Similarly care must be taken after sterilization to ensure sterile instruments do not become contaminated prior to use.

Disinfection refers to the use of liquid chemicals on surfaces and at room temperature to kill disease causing microorganisms. Disinfection is a less effective process than sterilization because it does not kill bacterial endospores. 

====Personal protective equipment====
[[Image:Disp-med-ppe.jpg|thumb|120px|Disposable PPE]]
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is specialized clothing or equipment worn by a worker for protection against a hazard. The hazard in a health care setting is exposure to blood, saliva, or other bodily fluids or aerosols that may carry infectious materials such as Hepatitis C, HIV, or other blood borne or bodily fluid pathogen. PPE prevents contact with a potentially infectious material by creating a physical barrier between the potential infectious material and the healthcare worker. 

In the United States, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requires the use of PPE by workers to guard against blood borne pathogens if there is a reasonably anticipated exposure to blood or other potentially infectious materials.

Components of PPE include medical gloves, hospital gowns, bonnets, shoe covers, face shields, CPR masks, goggles, surgical masks, and respirators. How many components are used and how the components are used is often determined by regulations or the infection control protocol of the facility in question. Many or most of these items are disposable to avoid carrying infectious materials from one patient to another patient and to avoid difficult or costly disinfection. In the United States, OSHA requires the immediate removal and disinfection or disposal of worker's PPE prior to leaving the work area where exposure to infectious material took place.

====Vaccination of health care workers====
Health care workers may be exposed to certain infections in the course of their work.   Vaccines are available to provide some protection to workers in a healthcare setting. Depending on regulation, recommendation, the specific work function, or personal preference, healthcare workers or first responders may receive vaccinations for hepatitis B; influenza; measles, mumps and rubella; Tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis; N. meningitidis; and varicella. In general, vaccines do not guarantee complete protection from disease, and there is potential for adverse effects from receiving the vaccine. 

====Post exposure prophylaxis====
In some cases where vaccines do not exist Post Exposure prophylaxis is another method of protecting the health care worker exposed to a life threatening infectious disease. For example, the viral particles for HIV-AIDS can be precipitated out of the blood through the use of an antibody injection if given within 4 hours of a significant exposure.

==6. What symptoms tell you that a person is physically ill?==
A symptom is a departure from normal function or feeling which is noticed by a patient, indicating the presence of disease or abnormality. A symptom is subjective, observed by the patient, and not measured.  A '''sign''' is noticed by the doctor or others. It is not necessarily the nature of the sign or symptom which defines it, but who observes it.

Symptoms include:

==7. Know how to help take care of a newborn and an aged person in your home.==
===Care for a Newborn===
Newborns must have all of their needs met by others.  About the only thing they can do by themselves is breathe (and in the case of premature births, sometimes not even that).  
;Feeding: A healthy newborn must be fed.  Breast milk is best, but formula is a common alternative.  If you do not know what the baby is drinking, ask the mother.  
;Sleep: Babies need a lot of sleep.  Lay an infant on its back, and make sure the temperature is comfortable.  If it's chilly, cover the baby's body (not the head!) with a blanket. 
;Diaper: When the baby soils a diaper, it should be changed.  
;Holding a baby: A newborn does not have strong enough muscles in the neck to support the head, so when the baby is held, the head must be supported at all times.  
;Medical Care: Newborns should see a pediatrician frequently.  The first pediatrician visit almost invariably occurs in the hospital where the baby was born.  A follow-up visit will be scheduled for a week later, and then again as scheduled by the pediatrician.  
;Outdoors: Dress the baby appropriately for the weather.  If it's warm, bundle up.  If it's hot, you will still need to make sure the baby does not get chilled.  Protect the baby from rain, snow, and other forms of precipitation.
;Transporting: If traveling in a vehicle, securely buckle the baby into a car seat approved for newborns.  If carrying the baby, always maintain a firm hold (don't drop the baby!).  In a stroller, buckle the baby in and cover with a blanket.  Do not leave the stroller unattended, and always keep your hands on it (do not let it roll away).


===Care for the Aged===
Caring for the aged can be a complicated endeavor.  Here are a few tips, but they only scratch the surface.  The capabilities of the aged vary greatly, so not all of these tips will apply to all aged persons.
*Help them feel safe and secure.
*Keep a light pitcher of water within easy reach.  Keep it full and remind remind them to drink from it.  Staying well hydrated will ward off many problems including headaches, loss of appetite, and insomnia.
*Provide a TV remote with large, easy-to-see (and easy to press) buttons.  This applies to the telephone as well.
*Regular exercise will improve mobility and help prevent pain caused by arthritis and other ailments.  The aged person does not need to run a marathon, but they can often walk or even lift weights.  Don't overdo it though.
*Keep them mentally engaged.  Board games and hobbies are a must.
*Prepare appetizing meals within the limits of the aged person's diet.  Mealtime is oftne the highlight of the day.  Make the most of it.
*Keep the temperature comfortable.  Seniors are at great risk when the temperature becomes either too hot or too cold.
*Understand the patient's medications.  Know whether the medicine should be taken with food or without.  Many medicines require that the patient avoid sunlight.  Make sure the patient actually takes the medicine you administer, and make sure the dosage is correct.  Read all the labels.  If the prescription says to continue taking the medicine until it is gone, make sure the patient takes it until it is gone.  Watch for allergic reactions and be ready to act.

==8. Know when and how to wash your hands when caring for a sick person.==
Hands should be washed after contact with any patient, and especially before contact is made with another patient.

The purpose of hand washing in the health care setting is to remove or destroy (disinfect) pathogenic microorganisms (&quot;germs&quot;) to avoid transmitting them to a patient. The application of water alone is ineffective for cleaning skin because water is unable to remove fats, oils, and proteins, which are components of organic soil. Therefore, removal of microorganisms from skin requires the addition of soaps or detergents to water. Plain soap does not kill pathogens. However, the addition of antiseptic chemicals to soap (&quot;medicated&quot; or &quot;antimicrobial&quot; soaps) does confer killing action to a hand washing agent. Such killing action may be desired prior to performing surgery or in settings in which antibiotic-resistant organisms are highly prevalent.

The proper washing of hands in a medical setting generally consists of the use of generous amounts of soap and water to lather and rub each part of ones hands systematically for 15 to 20 seconds. Hands should be rubbed together with digits interlocking. If there is debris under fingernails, a bristle brush is often used to remove it. Finally, it is necessary to rinse well and wipe dry with a paper towel. After drying, a dry paper towel should be used to turn off the water (and open any exit door if necessary).

All jewelry should be removed. When rinsing, ensure at all times that you do not allow water to drip from an unwashed area back to the hands.  This is why medical professionals hold their hands above their elbows between washing them and drying them. When done, the hands are dried with a sterile cloth.

==9. Know how to make a bedridden patient comfortable in bed.==

Use a draw sheet or a piece of cloth under the patient if available, so they can be turned and pulled up in bed with more ease, preventing friction on their skin.

Make sure the person is aligned properly, especially when on their back.  

Turn the patient every 2 hours during the day and at least 1 to 2 times during the night if possible.  

Prop the patient up prior to eating and a half hour afterwards if possible.  Otherwise turn the patient on their left side to eat if able.

Using a pillow between the knees while the patient is on his side can help prevent skin break down or creating a twist in the spine.

Have the patient by a window if possible or not contraindicated. 

Have the things a patient can use within reach if applicable.  

Provide an atmosphere conducive to the patient's and families needs if possible.  Example, some people do better being in the middle of the daily activities or they may need a  quiet place.

Provide adequate nutrition and fluids if applicable.

Keep the patient clean.

Be respective of the patient's dignity.

==10. Show how to feed a helpless patient in bed==
Eating is a basic function of life, and people who are unable to perform this task may feel they have lost their dignity.  Therefore, a patient should only be fed if they are unable to feed themselves. It is never appropriate to feed a patient because it is faster than allowing them to do it themselves.

If possible, a patient should be moved to a dining room for mealtimes.  The chair should be comfortable, and positioned so the patient can reach all of his food.  If the patient must be fed in bed, the bed should be inclined by about 30° to facilitate swallowing.

Before the meal, wash the patient's face and hands.

Allow time for feeding.  Do not rush things.  The patient must be given time to taste and enjoy his food.  Check that the food is at the proper temperature.  Cold foods should be cold, and hot foods should be warm (not so hot as to burn the mouth).

Ask the patient what food they would like first, and if they would like to alternate dishes, or eat each to completion before moving to another.  If they patient is not communicative, alternate the foods as you would if you were eating the meal.  Feed the patient his next bite when he is ready for it.  Do not force the patient to eat anything he does not wish to eat.  You may encourage the patient to ''try'' the food, but under no circumstances should he be forced to eat anything.

At the end of the meal, clean the patient's face and hands, and if necessary, his clothing as well.  Clear away the food and remove any crumbs from the bed.  Write down the amount of food that was eaten.  Leave the bed inclined for at least 30 minutes after the meal to aid in proper digestion.

==11. Show how to give liquid medicine and tablets, pills, or capsules to children and adults. Know how to properly apply eye drops.==
===Administering Medicines===
[[File:Pill box with pills.JPG|thumb|Pill box with pills]] Children do not usually take pills or capsules until they are older.  Instead, they should be given liquid medicines.  Be careful not to give your child medicine unnecessarily.  Just because a child is miserable does not mean that she should be given a drug.  Consider this carefully before medicating a child.

Read the warning labels, and understand the proper dosage.  A child under the age of two should never be given ''any'' medicine (even over-the-counter drugs) without consulting a doctor.  

Children who can drink without spilling can use a dosage cup.  This is a small cup with markings on the side showing different volumes.  Fill the cup to the appropriate line and give it to the child.  Watch the child take the medicine so you can be sure it was not poured down the sink, or spilled. 

If the child cannot drink liquids without spilling them, you can use a dosing spoon.  A dosing spoon looks a bit like a test tube, but the open end is shaped like a spoon.  Medicine is poured into the tube which has graduated markings on the side for measuring the dose.  The spoon is then inserted into the patient's mouth, and the medicine is poured in.  Be sure the patient swallows.

For very small children or for helpless adults, you may need to use a medicine dropper or an oral syringe.  Both are marked for measuring the proper dosage.  Most syringes have caps covering the tip, and this cap poses a choking hazard.  ''Be sure to remove the cap from the tip of a syringe before using it!''  Press the plunger so that it is fully engaged in the syringe.  Then insert its tip into the liquid medicine and draw the plunger upward until the proper dose has been drawn into the cylinder.  Remove the syringe from the medicine and point the tip upwards.  Apply slight pressure to the plunger to force the air bubble (if any) out of the tip and recheck the dose level. 

Once the syringe is loaded, place it well within the patient's oral cavity.  Then depress the plunger so that the medicine is discharged in the rear of the patient's mouth.  This will encourage the patient to swallow rather than spit.  If a young child holds the medicine in his mouth, quickly blow air into his face (don't spit!).  This will frequently cause him to swallow.

The aged will sometimes also resist taking medications.  If you are giving them the medicines and expecting them to take it themselves, watch that the patient actually does swallow the pills.  It is not uncommon for an aged person to hide or flush pills he does not think he needs.

===Applying Eye Drops===
Instruct your patient of the procedure as appropriate.  The head of your patient should be tipped back. Gently pull down on the skin below the eye and apply the drop in the pocket formed below the eyeball without touching the dropper on the patient.  Then gently apply pressure at the tear duct area with your finger when the patient closes their eye.  Instruct the patient not the squeeze their eye shut tight.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;

==12. Demonstrate the method of giving fomentations and foot baths. Explain the value of their use and tell the conditions under which such treatments should be given.==
===Fomentations===
Fomentations are given by alternating hot and hold.  Compressions can be either hot or cold, but no alternation takes place.
;Administration:
A thick cotton cloth (such as a diaper or a dish towel) is immersed in 4 liters of hot water (the water may be mixed with a decoction).  The cloth is then wrung out, and the temperature tested by applying it to the inside of the therapist's arm.  If it is too hot, it can be fanned in the air, but it should not be used if it is scalding hot.  It should, however, be as hot as the patient can stand.  The hot cloth is applied to the effected area and then wrapped with dry cloths so that the heat is retained.  The hot compress is them removed, and the area is quickly sponged down with a cold, wet cloth.  Then the heat is reapplied as before.  This is continued for up to 60 minutes.
;Conditions for Use:
Fomentations can increase circulation, aid in relieving congestion, warm achy joints, and draw abscesses.
===Foot baths===
;Administration: 
A small tub (about 8 liters) is filled with hot water.  Epsom salt may be dissolved in the water, but this is not strictly necessary.  Test the water temperature before taking it to the patient.  It should not scald.  The basin is placed on the floor at the feet of the seated patient.  The patient's bare feet are then placed in the water and allowed to soak for up to an hour.  If the water cools, it should be changed.  The patient's feet are then towel dried.
;Conditions for use:
Foot baths may be given to relieve foot pain. This treatment is good for arthritis.  Epsom salt, when used through soaking, can soothe muscle pains and help improve rough patches in the skin.

==13. Demonstrate the application of a heating compress and the use of heat and cold for the treatment of inflammation and bruises.==

=== 13a. Demonstrate the application of a heating compress ===
For a strained muscle or ligament, you should use ice or a cold pack immediately and for the next 36 hours. Do not use heat or a heating pad until swelling and bruising has stopped. Cold is used first to reduce swelling and inflammation. Apply cold (ice or an ice pack) for 20 minutes, remove for 20 minutes. Repeat every 4-6 hours. Put a thin towel to protect the skin. Do not put a cold pack or ice directly on the skin or you may get frostbite. After the bruising that comes along with the inflammation stops (1-3 days), use heat to relieve injury pain. Cold reduces inflammation. Heat improves circulation.

=== 13b. Demonstrate the use of heat and cold for the treatment of inflammation and bruises ===
Many episodes of pain come from muscle exertion or strain, which creates tension in the muscles and soft tissues.  This tension can constrict circulation, sending pain signals to the brain.  Heat application eases pain by:

* dilating the blood vessels surrounding the painful area.  Increased blood flow provides additional oxygen and nutrients to help heal the damaged muscle tissue.

* stimulating sensation in the skin and therefore decreasing the pain signals being transmitted to the brain

* increasing the flexibility (and decreasing painful stiffness) of soft tissues surrounding the injured area, including muscles and connective tissue.

==14. Explain how the following natural remedies help in preventing disease: Note how the first letter of each item spells NEW START.==
;a. Nutrition: That's ''eating''. If you feed your body right, you're off to a good start. Just like you don't put sand into your gas tank, you should put the right fuel into your body.
;b. Exercise: If you don't use it, you lose it. Or someone said that or should have said that. Exercise improves the health of a body, of the mind, and of the spirit. This should include outdoor exercise.
;c. Water: Our body is 70 percent water. We need to drink enough water to keep hydrated. It also flushes out bad stuff.
;d. Sunshine: The sun is a major source of energy in our world. Sunlight is also important for the body's metabolic balance.
;e. Temperance: Too much of one thing is bad. We need to practice using good things in moderation. 
;f. Air: What can one say. We need air. Find the best air you can breathe.  Do not smoke tobacco (or anything else), and avoid second-hand smoke.
;g. Rest: Rest allows the body to renew itself. Rest is important for health.
;h. Trust in God: Trust in God to lead you to the right choices.

{{fsharpTitle|Arrays}}
'''Arrays''' are a ubiquitous, a familiar data structure used to represent a group of related, ordered values. Unlike F# data structures, arrays are mutable, meaning the values in an array can be changed after the array has been created.

== Creating Arrays ==
Arrays are conceptually similar to lists. Naturally, arrays can be created using many of the same techniques as lists:

=== Array literals ===
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
&gt; [| 1; 2; 3; 4; 5 |];;
val it : int array = [|1; 2; 3; 4; 5|]&lt;/source&gt;

=== Array comprehensions ===
F# supports array comprehensions using ranges and generators in the same style and format as [[F_Sharp_Programming/Lists#Using_List_Comprehensions|list comprehensions]]:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; [| 1 .. 10 |];;
val it : int array = [|1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9; 10|]

&gt; [| 1 .. 3 .. 10 |];;
val it : int array = [|1; 4; 7; 10|]

&gt; [| for a in 1 .. 5 do
    yield (a, a*a, a*a*a) |];;
val it : (int * int * int) array
= [|(1, 1, 1); (2, 4, 8); (3, 9, 27); (4, 16, 64); (5, 25, 125)|]&lt;/source&gt;

=== &lt;code&gt;System.Array&lt;/code&gt; Methods ===
There are several methods in the &lt;code&gt;System.Array&lt;/code&gt; module for creating arrays:

----

'''&lt;code&gt;val zeroCreate : int arraySize -&gt; 'T []&lt;/code&gt;'''
: Creates an array with &lt;code&gt;arraySize&lt;/code&gt; elements. Each element in the array holds the default value for the particular data type (&lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; for numbers, &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; for bools, &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; for reference types).

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
&gt; let (x : int array) = Array.zeroCreate 5;;
val x : int array

&gt; x;;
val it : int array = [|0; 0; 0; 0; 0|]&lt;/source&gt;

----

'''&lt;code&gt;val create : int -&gt; 'T value -&gt; 'T []&lt;/code&gt;'''
: Creates an array with &lt;code&gt;arraySize&lt;/code&gt; elements. Initializes each element in the array with &lt;code&gt;value&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
&gt; Array.create 5 &quot;Juliet&quot;;;
val it : string [] = [|&quot;Juliet&quot;; &quot;Juliet&quot;; &quot;Juliet&quot;; &quot;Juliet&quot;; &quot;Juliet&quot;|]&lt;/source&gt;

----

'''&lt;code&gt;val init : int arraySize -&gt; (int index -&gt; 'T) initializer -&gt; 'T []&lt;/code&gt;
: Creates an array with &lt;code&gt;arraySize&lt;/code&gt; elements. Initializes each element in the array with the &lt;code&gt;initializer&lt;/code&gt; function.

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
&gt; Array.init 5 (fun index -&gt; sprintf &quot;index: %i&quot; index);;
val it : string []
= [|&quot;index: 0&quot;; &quot;index: 1&quot;; &quot;index: 2&quot;; &quot;index: 3&quot;; &quot;index: 4&quot;|]&lt;/source&gt;

== Working With Arrays ==
Elements in an array are accessed by their ''index'', or position in an array. Array indexes always start at &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; and end at &lt;code&gt;array.length - 1&lt;/code&gt;. For example, lets take the following array:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
let names = [| &quot;Juliet&quot;; &quot;Monique&quot;; &quot;Rachelle&quot;; &quot;Tara&quot;; &quot;Sophia&quot; |]
(* Indexes:        0         1           2         3        4 *)
&lt;/source&gt;
This list contains 5 items. The first index is &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, and the last index is &lt;code&gt;4&lt;/code&gt;.

We can access items in the list using the &lt;code&gt;.[index]&lt;/code&gt; operator, also called indexer notation. Here is the same list in fsi:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; let names = [| &quot;Juliet&quot;; &quot;Monique&quot;; &quot;Rachelle&quot;; &quot;Tara&quot;; &quot;Sophia&quot; |];;

val names : string array

&gt; names.[2];;
val it : string = &quot;Rachelle&quot;

&gt; names.[0];;
val it : string = &quot;Juliet&quot;&lt;/source&gt;

Instances of arrays have a &lt;code&gt;Length&lt;/code&gt; property which returns the number of elements in the array:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
&gt; names.Length;;
val it : int = 5

&gt; for i = 0 to names.Length - 1 do
    printfn &quot;%s&quot; (names.[i]);;
Juliet
Monique
Rachelle
Tara
Sophia&lt;/source&gt;

Arrays are mutable data structures, meaning we can assign elements in an array new values at any point in our program:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; names;;
val it : string array = [|&quot;Juliet&quot;; &quot;Monique&quot;; &quot;Rachelle&quot;; &quot;Tara&quot;; &quot;Sophia&quot;|]

&gt; names.[4] &lt;- &quot;Kristen&quot;;;
val it : unit = ()

&gt; names;;
val it : string array = [|&quot;Juliet&quot;; &quot;Monique&quot;; &quot;Rachelle&quot;; &quot;Tara&quot;; &quot;Kristen&quot;|]&lt;/source&gt;

If you try to access an element outside the range of an array, you'll get an exception:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; names.[-1];;
System.IndexOutOfRangeException: Index was outside the bounds of the array.
   at &lt;StartupCode$FSI_0029&gt;.$FSI_0029._main()
stopped due to error

&gt; names.[5];;
System.IndexOutOfRangeException: Index was outside the bounds of the array.

=== Array Slicing ===
F# supports a few useful operators which allow programmers to return &quot;slices&quot; or subarrays of an array using the &lt;code&gt;.[start..finish]&lt;/code&gt; operator, where one of the &lt;code&gt;start&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;finish&lt;/code&gt; arguments may be omitted.

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; let names = [|&quot;0: Juliet&quot;; &quot;1: Monique&quot;; &quot;2: Rachelle&quot;; &quot;3: Tara&quot;; &quot;4: Sophia&quot;|];;

val names : string array

&gt; names.[1..3];; (* Grabs items between index 1 and 3 *)
val it : string [] = [|&quot;1: Monique&quot;; &quot;2: Rachelle&quot;; &quot;3: Tara&quot;|]

&gt; names.[2..];; (* Grabs items between index 2 and last element *)
val it : string [] = [|&quot;2: Rachelle&quot;; &quot;3: Tara&quot;; &quot;4: Sophia&quot;|]

&gt; names.[..3];; (* Grabs items between first element and index 3 *)
val it : string [] = [|&quot;0: Juliet&quot;; &quot;1: Monique&quot;; &quot;2: Rachelle&quot;; &quot;3: Tara&quot;|]&lt;/source&gt;

Note that array slices generate a new array, rather than altering the existing array. This requires allocating new memory and copying elements from our source array into our target array. If performance is a high priority, it is generally more efficient to look at parts of an array using a few index adjustments.

=== Multi-dimensional Arrays ===
A multi-dimensional array is literally an array of arrays. Conceptually, its not any harder to work with these types of arrays than single-dimensional arrays (as shown above). Multi-dimensional arrays come in two forms: rectangular and jagged arrays.

==== Rectangular Arrays ====

A rectangular array, which may be called a grid or a matrix, is an array of arrays, where all of the inner arrays have the same length. Here is a simple 2x3 rectangular array in fsi:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; Array2D.zeroCreate&lt;int&gt; 2 3;;
val it : int [,] = [|[|0; 0; 0|]; [|0; 0; 0|]|]&lt;/source&gt;

This array has 2 rows, and each row has 3 columns. To access elements in this array, you use the &lt;code&gt;.[row,col]&lt;/code&gt; operator:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; let grid = Array2D.init&lt;string&gt; 3 3 (fun row col -&gt; sprintf &quot;row: %i, col: %i&quot; row col);;

val grid : string [,]

&gt; grid;;
val it : string [,]
= [|[|&quot;row: 0, col: 0&quot;; &quot;row: 0, col: 1&quot;; &quot;row: 0, col: 2&quot;|];
    [|&quot;row: 1, col: 0&quot;; &quot;row: 1, col: 1&quot;; &quot;row: 1, col: 2&quot;|];
    [|&quot;row: 2, col: 0&quot;; &quot;row: 2, col: 1&quot;; &quot;row: 2, col: 2&quot;|]|]

&gt; grid.[0, 1];;
val it : string = &quot;row: 0, col: 1&quot;

&gt; grid.[1, 2];;
val it : string = &quot;row: 1, col: 2&quot;&lt;/source&gt;

Here's a simple program to demonstrate how to use and iterate through multidimensional arrays:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
open System

let printGrid grid =
    let maxY = (Array2D.length1 grid) - 1
    let maxX = (Array2D.length2 grid) - 1
    
    for row in 0 .. maxY do
        for col in 0 .. maxX do
            if grid.[row, col] = true then Console.Write(&quot;* &quot;)
            else Console.Write(&quot;_ &quot;)
        Console.WriteLine()

let toggleGrid (grid : bool[,]) =
    Console.WriteLine()
    Console.WriteLine(&quot;Toggle grid:&quot;)
    
    let row =
        Console.Write(&quot;Row: &quot;)
        Console.ReadLine() |&gt; int
        
    let col =
        Console.Write(&quot;Col: &quot;)
        Console.ReadLine() |&gt; int
    
    grid.[row, col] &lt;- (not grid.[row, col])

let main() =
    Console.WriteLine(&quot;Create a grid:&quot;)
    let rows =
        Console.Write(&quot;Rows: &quot;)
        Console.ReadLine() |&gt; int
        
    let cols =
        Console.Write(&quot;Cols: &quot;)
        Console.ReadLine() |&gt; int
        
    let grid = Array2D.zeroCreate&lt;bool&gt; rows cols
    printGrid grid
    
    let mutable go = true
    while go do
        toggleGrid grid
        printGrid grid
        Console.Write(&quot;Keep playing (y/n)? &quot;)
        go &lt;- Console.ReadLine() = &quot;y&quot;
    
    Console.WriteLine(&quot;Thanks for playing&quot;)
            
main()&lt;/source&gt;

This program outputs the following:
 Create a grid:
 Rows: &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
 Cols: &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
 _ _ _
 _ _ _
 
 Toggle grid:
 Row: &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
 Col: &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
 _ * _
 _ _ _
 Keep playing (y/n)? &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;
 
 Toggle grid:
 Row: &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
 Col: &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
 _ * _
 _ * _
 Keep playing (y/n)? &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;
 
 Toggle grid:
 Row: &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
 Col: &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
 _ * _
 _ * *
 Keep playing (y/n)? &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;
 
 Thanks for playing

In additional to the &lt;code&gt;Array2D&lt;/code&gt; module, F# has an &lt;code&gt;Array3D&lt;/code&gt; module to support 3-dimensional arrays as well.

: '''Note''' Its possible to create arrays with more than 3 dimensions using the &lt;code&gt;System.Array.CreateInstance&lt;/code&gt; method, but its generally recommended to avoid creating arrays with huge numbers of elements or dimensions, since it can quickly consume all of the available memory on a machine. For comparison, an &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; is 4 bytes, and a 1000x1000x1000 &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; array would consume about 3.7 GB of memory, more than the memory available on 99% of desktop PCs.

==== Jagged arrays ====

A jagged array is an array of arrays, except each row in the array does not necessary need to have the same number of elements:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; [| for a in 1 .. 5 do yield [| 1 .. a |] |];;
val it : int array array
= [|[|1|];
    [|1; 2|];
    [|1; 2; 3|];
    [|1; 2; 3; 4|];
    [|1; 2; 3; 4; 5|]|]&lt;/source&gt;

You use the &lt;code&gt;.[index]&lt;/code&gt; operator to access items in the array. Since each element contains another array, its common to see code that resembles &lt;code&gt;.[row].[col]&lt;/code&gt;:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; let jagged = [| for a in 1 .. 5 do yield [| 1 .. a |] |]
for arr in jagged do
    for col in arr do
        printf &quot;%i &quot; col
    printfn &quot;&quot;;;

val jagged : int array array

1 
1 2 
1 2 3 
1 2 3 4 
1 2 3 4 5

&gt; jagged.[2].[2];;
val it : int = 3

&gt; jagged.[4].[0];;
val it : int = 1&lt;/source&gt;

: '''Note:''' Notice that the data type of a rectangular array is &lt;code&gt;'a[,]&lt;/code&gt;, but the data type of a jagged array is &lt;code&gt;'a array array&lt;/code&gt;. This results because a rectangular array stores data &quot;flat&quot;, whereas a jagged array is literally an array of ''pointers to arrays''. Since these two types of arrays are stored differently in memory, F# treats &lt;code&gt;'a[,]&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;'a array array&lt;/code&gt; as two different, non-interchangeable data types. As a result, rectangular and jagged arrays have slightly different syntax for element access.

: Rectangular arrays are stored in a slightly more efficient manner and generally perform better than jagged arrays, although there may not be a perceptible difference in most applications. However, its worth noting performance differences between the two in [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc163995.aspx#S10 benchmark tests].

=== Using the &lt;code&gt;Array&lt;/code&gt; Module ===
There are two array modules, &lt;code&gt;System.Array&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Microsoft.FSharp.Collections.Array&lt;/code&gt;, developed by the .NET BCL designers and the creators of F# respectively. Many of the methods and functions in the F# Array module are similar to those in the List module.

'''&lt;code&gt;val append : 'T[] first -&gt; 'T[] second -&gt; 'T[]&lt;/code&gt;'''
: Returns a new array with elements consisting of the first array followed by the second array.

'''&lt;code&gt;val choose : ('T item -&gt; 'U option) -&gt; 'T[] input -&gt; 'U[]&lt;/code&gt;'''
: Filters and maps an array, returning a new array consisting of all elements which returned &lt;code&gt;Some&lt;/code&gt;.

'''&lt;code&gt;val copy : 'T[] input -&gt; 'T[]&lt;/code&gt;'''
: Returns a copy of the input array.

'''&lt;code&gt;val fill : 'T[] input -&gt; int start -&gt; int end -&gt; 'T value -&gt; unit&lt;/code&gt;'''
: Assigns &lt;code&gt;value&lt;/code&gt; to all the elements between the start and end indexes.

'''&lt;code&gt;val filter : ('T -&gt; bool) -&gt; 'T[] -&gt; 'T[]&lt;/code&gt;'''
: Returns a new array consisting of items filtered out of the input array.

'''&lt;code&gt;val fold : ('State -&gt; 'T -&gt; 'State) -&gt; 'State -&gt; 'T[] input -&gt; 'State&lt;/code&gt;'''
: Accumulates left to right over an array.

'''&lt;code&gt;val foldBack : ('T -&gt; 'State -&gt; 'State) -&gt; 'T[] input -&gt; 'State -&gt; 'State&lt;/code&gt;'''
: Accumulates right to left over an array.

'''&lt;code&gt;val iter : ('T -&gt; unit) -&gt; 'T[] input -&gt; unit&lt;/code&gt;'''
: Applies a function to all of the elements of the input array.

'''&lt;code&gt;val length : 'T[] -&gt; int&lt;/code&gt;'''
: Returns the number of items in an array.

'''&lt;code&gt;val map : ('T -&gt; 'U) -&gt; 'T[] -&gt; 'U[]&lt;/code&gt;'''
: Applies a mapping function to each element in the input array to return a new array.

'''&lt;code&gt;val rev : 'T[] input -&gt; 'T[]&lt;/code&gt;
: Returns a new array with the items in reverse order.

'''&lt;code&gt;val sort : 'T[] -&gt; 'T[]&lt;/code&gt;'''
: Sorts a copy of an array.

'''&lt;code&gt;val sortInPlace : 'T[] -&gt; unit&lt;/code&gt;'''
: Sorts an array in place. Note that the &lt;code&gt;sortInPlace&lt;/code&gt; method returns &lt;code&gt;unit&lt;/code&gt;, indicating the &lt;code&gt;sortInPlace&lt;/code&gt; mutates the original array.

'''&lt;code&gt;val sortBy : ('T -&gt; 'T -&gt; int) -&gt; 'T[] -&gt; 'T[]&lt;/code&gt;'''
: Sorts a copy of an array based on the sorting function.

'''&lt;code&gt;val sub : 'T[] -&gt; int start -&gt; int end -&gt; 'T[]&lt;/code&gt;
: Returns a sub array based on the given start and end indexes.

== Differences Between Arrays and Lists ==
* Lists
** [[Image:Symbol_thumbs_up.svg‎|15px]] Immutable, allows new lists to share nodes with other lists.
** [[Image:Symbol_thumbs_up.svg‎|15px]] List literals.
** [[Image:Symbol_thumbs_up.svg‎|15px]] Pattern matching.
** [[Image:Symbol_thumbs_up.svg‎|15px]] Supports mapping and folding.
** [[Image:Symbol_thumbs_down.svg‎|15px]] Linear lookup time.
** [[Image:Symbol_thumbs_down.svg‎|15px]] No random access to elements, just &quot;forward-only&quot; traversal.
* Arrays
** [[Image:Symbol_thumbs_up.svg‎|15px]] Array literals.
** [[Image:Symbol_thumbs_up.svg‎|15px]] Constant lookup time.
** [[Image:Symbol_thumbs_up.svg‎|15px]] Good spacial locality of reference ensures efficient lookup time.
** [[Image:Symbol_thumbs_up.svg‎|15px]] Indexes indicate the position of each element relative to others, making arrays ideal for random access.
** [[Image:Symbol_thumbs_up.svg‎|15px]] Supports mapping and folding.
** [[Image:Symbol_thumbs_down.svg‎|15px]] Mutability prevents arrays from sharing nodes with other elements in an array.
** [[Image:Symbol_thumbs_down.svg‎|15px]] Not resizable.

=== Representation in Memory ===
Items in an array are represented in memory as adjacent values in memory. For example, lets say we create the following int array:
: &lt;code&gt;[| 15; 5; 21; 0; 9 |]&lt;/code&gt;

Represented in memory, our array resembles something like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
Memory Location: |  100 |  104 |  108 |  112 |  116
          Value: |   15 |    5 |   21 |    0 |    9
          Index: |    0 |    1 |    2 |    3 |    4&lt;/pre&gt;

Each &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; occupies 4 bytes of memory. Since our array contains 5 elements, the operating systems allocates 20 bytes of memory to hold this array (4 bytes * 5 elements = 20 bytes). The first first element in the array occupies memory 100-103, the second element occupies 104-107, and so on.

We know that each element in the array is identified by its ''index'' or position in the array. Literally, the index is an offset: since the array starts at memory location 100, and each element in the array occupies a fixed amount of memory, the operating system can know the exact address of each element in memory using the formula:
: Start memory address of element at index &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; = StartPosition of array + (&lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; * length of data type)
: End memory address of element at index &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; = Start memory address + length of data type

In laymens terms, this means we can access the ''nth'' element of any array in constant time, or in O(1) operations. This is in contrast to lists, where accessing the ''nth'' element requires O(n) operations.

With the understanding that elements in an array occupy adjacent memory locations, we can deduce two properties of arrays:
# Creating arrays requires programmers to specify the size of the array upfront, otherwise the operating system won't know how many adjacent memory locations to allocate.
# Arrays are not resizable, because memory locations before the first element or beyond the last element may hold data used by other applications. An array is only &quot;resized&quot; by allocating a new block of memory and copying all of the elements from the old array into the new array.

===Implementation Plan===

According to the wiki Directing Technology &quot;Technology implementation starts at the inception of the planning development strategy. There are two distinct types of technology implementation: implementing developed technology and implementing developing technology projects. They are very similar in that the projects need a plan that has a schedule with clear GO/NO-GO decision points and a project team that has well laid out responsibilities. The technology department will be implementing developed technology(2006)&quot;.

Implementation of your technology plan will be the most complicated and time consuming part of the process. It is important to allow yourself at least one year before the actual implementation starting day to make all the necessary arrangements. Your plans will depend on many things including the size of your district, status of your existing technology program, skill set of your teachers and administrators and size of your technology staff. Your plan may need to be implemented all at once or over the course of several years, phasing in different stages.

Your technology plan has been accepted by the district. Its time to plan the implementation. At least six months to a year prior to beginning the implementation, several elements of the plan will be carried out simultaneously by several different groups. 

The progress of the project should be documented in writing and communicated to all persons involved.  A good checklist should be developed to organize the associated details.

A sample checklist:
:*	Describe goals &amp; objectives (as outlined in the Technology Plan)
:*      Identify participant’s roles and responsibilities
:*	Identify impacts
:*	Design methods to deal with impacts
:*	Identify resources needed and available
:*	Identify the completion date desired
:*	Identify the constraints
:*	Break the implementation into steps
:*	Identify milestones / decision points
:*	Design project paths
:*	Design tracking methods
:*	Schedule team meetings
:*	Design communication methods
:*	Design technical support
:*	Design professional development

The technical staff implementing developed technology must not only manage the deployment of the hardware and software, but they must also cope with the daily activities of the school district while they prepare for the transition to the new technology. Project management skills are necessary to provide as smooth a job as possible for all involved. Further information on project management: [[/a sample list of project management organizational tools| Sample list of project management organizational tools]]; 
[[/Project Management Template|Project Management Template]]

At the same time, the administrative team will have researched and decided exactly which laptops will be purchased and from which vendor. They will have determined necessary units and submitted purchase orders. They will include in their orders sufficient quantities of peripheral items like graphic tablets, mouses, headphones with mics, tables, chairs and extension cords.

====Laptops for Students====

The implementation is so important that students will be asked to return to school two days early to be introduced to the laptops. During these two days, students will be involved in induction classes that will take them through the essential concerns of using the new laptops in school. The students will complete two days of formal training with technology specialists and their presence is mandatory. At the end of the induction session, a test will be taken to identify students that can possibly receive further assistance during the start of the year.

The students will be assigned their laptops at before the start of the school year and will be asked to sign an acceptable user policy agreement form and encouraged to personalize their new laptops in case they get assigned laptops for the year. The administrative and professional development teams will assist teachers in introducing the students in understanding how the program will be run and what their responsibilities for using laptops will be.

In addition, parents will also be sent an policy agreement that covers all the necessary information about the consequences of mistreatment of the equipment. This document will also have insurance information. Parents are required to sign this docuemtn and send it back to school.

====Laptop care====

The schools will provide specific features for the school bags that students will use for carrying computer equipment. Those students in the elementary and middle school will be required to use smaller backpacks in comparison to the students in high school. The laptops that students will be using in high school are fully-equipped laptops that need more care that the other robust models used in the lower sections of the school.

In addition, staff and administrators will reinforce the rules of laptop carrying around campus. No computers in high school will be moved without the use of a suitable laptop bag that can safely strap the equipment inside the bag.

====Staff Development====

Teachers and administrators will be the first ones to have a chance to get familiarized with the equipment that will be introduced in their classrooms. It will be necessary to prepare comprehensive tutorials or manuals to allow a quick switch into using the new technology. The professional development group will have finalized their plans for training sessions and will have begun designing the instruction. This instruction will include specific information about the change of school structure as a well as content and grade specific methods for conducting student-centered classes. Teacher responsibilities and technology integration strategies for student-centered project-based units of study will be included.

The administrative team and the professional development team will be carrying out intensive, paid, summer training sessions to prepare teachers for the changes to come in the fall. Teachers will then be given time to restructure their lessons and will have support available when they have problems.

Numerous schools have found ways to adjust schedules and provide one hour of planning and inservice for teachers while maintaining state requirements for students contact time. In some schools teachers have agreed to start earlier and end later each day as well as give up some recess or duty time in order to develop a one-hour block of time per week for inservice and planning. A key is to make sure that at least one early-out per month is devoted to a technology inservice activity.

It is crucial that consideration be given to teacher learning well in advance of the arrival of computers in the classroom. The list that follows is a brief synopsis of beneficial staff development suggestions:

:*	Formulate detailed plans for staff development and implementation.
:*	Decide who will lead staff development programs and evaluate each stage of implementation.
:*	Develop a working schedule for the staff  development program.
:*	Determine appropriate staff development activities for special services and support staff.
:*	Identify who will lead and evaluate staff development for auxiliary staff members.
:*	Identify in-house technical consultants who will help teachers deal quickly with problems that might arise.

====Technical Support====

Maintaining and servicing networked equipment continues to be a challenge for schools' effective use of technology. More states are now requiring that districts and schools have a technology specialist or coordinator who supports teachers in integrating instruction and technology before that district can receive state funding. Schools could also have in-house technical support to deal with all the technical problems that could arise. You should foresee a great number of incident reports that deal with student damaging display screen or damaging equipment because of negligence in carrying them.

The summer before the implementation, the same groups will be working to get things ready for the students in the fall. The goals are to have the technology in place to facilitate as smooth a transition as possible. The technology team will receive the laptops, inventory them and load them with the chosen operating systems and software. They will also check connectivity at each school and important points around the district to ensure that the laptops can work from the first day of school. Finally, they will create a yearly maintenance plan for cleaning and preventative care.

If staff or students need to use equipment like projectors, digital cameras or even cables, they can request the media center to facilitate the equipment and provide operational guidance.

====Flexible Scheduling====

They will also conduct public relations meetings for members of the community to inform them about the specifics of the program, including the change from a seven period isolated subject schedule to a more integrated block schedule that includes math-science-art blocks, history-literature-reading-writing-music blocks, world language-history-art music blocks and physical education-art-music-history blocks. They will explain the benefits of changing the school structure to a more constructivist, student- centered one by explaining the theory of how students learn best and demonstrating some proposed class exercises.

Flexible scheduling provides quality time either in the lounge or in the classroom for specific staff members to get together and share ideas about technology. A bonding often occurs between the mentor-teacher and the staff member needing encouragement. This new-found relationship helps solve technical problems and misunderstandings and opens the way for future inservice opportunities.

====Local Intranet====

Data intranets are becoming commonplace in schools. Intranets give schools an unprecedented ability to manage their budgets, buy supplies, and analyze student data. For example, districts are using the data intranet to provide information on student records, text scores, attendance, and health information, to create student profiles.

===Additional Key Points===

The key to success with technology is allowing teachers to develop a sense of ownership of the school's technology. Once teachers develop a sense of ownership, they will be ready to move on to higher levels of technology use. When all is said and done, it will be teachers who determine the success or failure of a technology plan. They are the people who connect technology with curricular practice in a way that will enhance student achievement. In every class, teachers must contend with a variety of learners, such as the fast-paced learner, the less-motivated learner, students with learning difficulties, and the list could go on. With computers in the classroom, teachers have access to tools that have potential for providing learning experiences relevant to each of these unique learners.

====Infrastructure====

When speaking of infrastructure, one is generally referring to the basic facilities and mechanical and electrical installations found in a school. These facilities and installations form the foundation for proposed technology upgrades. The following points provide a brief outline of things to consider when reviewing infrastructure:

:*	Decide how existing equipment and infrastructure can be integrated into the project.
:*	Visit other schools to evaluate successful programs for structural adaptations that could be copied and, in particular, look for unique ideas to solve local problems.
:*	Make sure that the network wiring satisfies the needs of the teachers.
:*	Make sure to count with the necessary expertise to ready the infrastructure for implementation.
:*	Make sure professionals are brought in order to handle remodeling and other infrastructure needs.
:*	The technology staff will run diagnostics on the district to check for adequate connectivity and electrical resources and take action to fix any inadequacies or to bolster the already existing systems.

====Teaching and Learning====

When considering how technology will be brought into the classroom, both teaching and learning should be considered. Several points to remember when considering the effects of technology on teaching and learning are:

:*	Evaluate hardware purchases and coordinate them to student needs. Consider features like user-friendliness, dependability, and speed.
:*	Evaluate projected software purchases to determine which programs will best complement, support, and expand classroom teaching and learning.
:*	Evaluate planned software purchases for comprehensiveness and user-friendliness. Comprehensiveness is important because ease of use flattens the learning curve and helps ensure that the programs will be used. When checking the software programs, all updates to versions and site licenses will also be completed.
:*	Determine the simplest approach that will effectively bring computers into the teaching and learning environment. Simplicity aids understanding and allows stakeholders to support the process more readily.
:*	Establish dialogues with teachers to evaluate classroom space and decide on computer locations withing each classroom.
:*	Determine the amount of use teachers will make of the new technology.
:*	Regardless of the size of the technology project, standardizing hardware and software are essential to maintaining control of the technology. Having a single configuration for all computers helps simplify maintenance. More time can be spent using the technology.

====Leadership====

Quality leadership must prevail at all stages of the project. Below is a list of important factors to consider when a technology project is being led:

:*	Keep students' and teachers' needs at the forefront during the various stages of the technology planning process.
:*	Consider how students and staff members will be affected by the technology changes and develop appropriate support structures like training, changes in classroom layout, and inclusion into curricula.
:*	Review school programs to determine how course subjects may be adjusted to make use of technologies in the classroom.
:*	Consider the possibility of having to modify school practices or upgrade regulations.
:*	Envision what the completed project will look like and what it will do for teaching and learning.

====Financial Management====

Most determinations about finance, generally dealt with at middle and upper management positions, will have a critical impact to the success of the larger groups. Several points are listed below to provide a general overview of the financial management process:

:*	Itemize equipment resources owned by the school. The goal is to look to reduce unnecessary duplication in new purchases. Create an inventory of all technology related items including desktops, laptops, printers and other peripherals, accessories such as mice, power cords, keyboards, all software programs and furniture used for tech purposes.
:*	Determine if the proposed equipment will be purchased locally or from a national distribution company. Decide who will be responsible for handling the recommended purchases.
:*	Review all costs to make sure the technology project is affordable in all its phases.

====Community Awareness and Support====

Community support is necessary during the planning stages of the technology initiative. It is also true that many parents want to be informed about the development of the project in their children's education. Take into account the following factors in order to provide general information to the parents:

:*	Consider how you will be able to show community members how teachers are adopting this technological direction onto their curriculum.
:*	Address parents' and community members' concerns over how technology in the classroom will enhance student learning and achievement.
:*	Show parents and members of the community how they and their children can benefit from the process of networking technologies in district classrooms.
:*	Develop guidelines for presenting information to the public. Be sure all news releases are verified with the public relations director before they go public.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=&lt;center&gt;Empty Base Optimization&lt;/center&gt;=
=== Intent ===
Optimize storage for data members of empty class types
=== Also Known As ===
* EBCO: Empty Base Class Optimization
* Empty Member Optimization
=== Motivation ===
Empty classes come up from time to time in C++. C++ requires empty classes to have non-zero size to ensure object identity. For instance, an array of &lt;code&gt;EmptyClass&lt;/code&gt; below has to have non-zero size because each object identified by the array subscript must be unique. Pointer arithmetic will fall apart if &lt;code&gt;sizeof(EmptyClass) &lt;/code&gt; is zero. Often the size of such a class is one.
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
class EmptyClass {};
EmptyClass arr[10]; // Size of this array can’t be zero. 
&lt;/source&gt;
When the same empty class shows up as a data member of other classes, it consumes more than a single byte. Compilers often align data on 4-byte boundaries to avoid splitting. The four bytes taken by the empty class object are just placeholders and serve no useful purpose. Avoiding wastage of space is desirable to save memory and help fit more objects in the cpu cache lines.
=== Solution and Sample Code ===
C++ makes special exemption for empty classes when they are inherited from. The compiler is allowed to flatten the inheritance hierarchy in a way that the empty base class does not consume space.  For instance, in the following example, &lt;code&gt;sizeof(AnInt)&lt;/code&gt; is 4 on 32 bit architectures and &lt;code&gt;sizeof(AnotherEmpty)&lt;/code&gt; is 1 byte even though both of them inherit from the &lt;code&gt;EmptyClass&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
class AnInt  : public EmptyClass 
{
   int data;
};   // size = sizeof(int)

class AnotherEmpty : public EmptyClass {};  // size =  1
&lt;/source&gt; 
EBCO makes use of this exemption in a '''systematic''' way. It may not be desirable to naively move the empty classes from member-list to base-class-list because that may expose interfaces that are otherwise hidden from the users. For instance, the following way of applying EBCO will apply the optimization but may have undesirable side-effects: The signatures of  the functions (if any in E1, E2) are now visible to the users of class &lt;code&gt;Foo&lt;/code&gt; (although they can’t call them because of private inheritance).
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
class E1 {};
class E2 {};

// **** before EBCO ****

class Foo {
  E1 e1;
  E2 e2;
  int data;
}; // sizeof(Foo) = 8

// **** after EBCO ****

class Foo : private E1, private E2 {
  int data;
}; // sizeof(Foo) = 4
&lt;/source&gt;
A practical way of using EBCO is to combine the empty members into a single member that flattens the storage. The following template &lt;code&gt;BaseOptimization&lt;/code&gt; applies EBCO on its first two type parameter. The &lt;code&gt;Foo&lt;/code&gt; class above has been rewritten to use it.
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
template &lt;class Base1, class Base2, class Member&gt;
struct BaseOptimization : Base1, Base2 
{
   Member member;
   BaseOptimization() {}
   BaseOptimization(Base1 const&amp; b1, Base2 const &amp; b2, Member const&amp; mem)
       : Base1(b1), Base2(b2), m(mem) { }
   Base1 * first()  { return this; }
   Base2 * second() { return this; }
};

class Foo {
  BaseOptimization&lt;E1, E2, int&gt; data;
}; // sizeof(Foo) = 4
&lt;/source&gt;
With this technique, there is no change in the inheritance relationship of the &lt;code&gt;Foo&lt;/code&gt; class. It is critical to make sure that the base classes do not conflict with each other. I.e., &lt;code&gt;Base1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Base2&lt;/code&gt; are part of independent hierarchies.

'''Caveat'''

Object identity issues do not appear to be consistent across compilers. The addresses of the empty objects may or may not be the same. For instance, the pointer returned by &lt;code&gt;first&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;second&lt;/code&gt; member methods of &lt;code&gt;BaseOptimization&lt;/code&gt; class may be the same on some compilers and different on others. See more discussion on [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7694158/boost-compressed-pair-and-addresses-of-empty-objects StackOverflow]

=== Known Uses ===
* [http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_47_0/libs/utility/compressed_pair.htm boost::compressed_pair] makes use of this technique to optimize the size of the pair.
* A C++03 emulation of [http://home.roadrunner.com/~hinnant/unique_ptr03.html unique_ptr] also uses this idiom.

      <text xml:space="preserve">As seen in boost::ptr_container

Motivation:
allocators have serious problems, because they change the underlying type of the container.



&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
struct user_allocator_nedmalloc
{
	typedef std::size_t size_type;
	typedef std::ptrdiff_t difference_type;
	
	static inline char* malloc(const size_type bytes) {
		return reinterpret_cast&lt;char*&gt;(nedmalloc(bytes));
	}
	
	static inline void free(char* const block) {
		nedfree(block);
	}
};
&lt;/source&gt;

This idiom is wildly superior to the way that std::allocators work
the whole idiom is outlined here:

http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2005/n1850.pdf

{{TODO|someone please distill that whole thing into one short idiom}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">From v1.5, Celestia fully supports internationalization. Celestia i18n is processed using gettext. &lt;br&gt;
All the strings used in the program can be translated. For each language, the list of strings and their translation is saved in a .po file.

==Getting .po files==
The .po files can be downloaded from the [http://celestia.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/celestia/trunk/celestia/po/ Celestia SVN repository] or from the table in the 'Celestia translation overview' section below.

==Editing .po files==
The .po files can be edited using the following software:
* [http://www.poedit.net/ Poedit]: for Linux and Windows. 
* [http://kbabel.kde.org/ KBabel]: for KDE

==Updating existing .po files==
The already existing .po files for a language can easily be updated to latest version by using the  [http://celestia.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/celestia/trunk/celestia/po/celestia.pot celestia.pot].
In poEdit this can be done with the command &quot;Catalog/Update from POT file&quot;. 
This results then in the program showing a list of removed and changed or newly introduced strings.
But be advised that the creation date of the .po file internally is not updated.
KBabel should also have such a mechanism.

==Creating a new .po file==
* Download the [http://celestia.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/celestia/trunk/celestia/po/celestia.pot celestia.pot] file from the [http://celestia.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/celestia/trunk/celestia/po/ Celestia SVN repository].
* Rename it using the [http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.html#Language-Codes ISO 639-1 code] of your language.
* Edit it as described in the above 'Editing .po files'&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; section.

==Sending completed .po files==
Once the translation is completed, .po files can be sent to [mailto:gvince@sfr.fr gvince@sfr.fr].

==Building internationalization files from the source in MS Windows==
* Follow the celestia build for Win 32 platform as described in http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Celestia/Development/Win32_platform. It is assumed that celestia source is in &quot;c:\celestia&quot; and other programs are installed in c drive, too.

* Install perl (e.g. ActivePerl) and POEdit for Windows

* Add path for POEdit (e.g. C:\Program Files\Poedit\bin). This is for msgfmt.

* Open Windows command console (cmd.exe)

* Execute &quot;C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\bin\vcvars32.bat&quot;

* Change directory with &quot;cd C:\celestia\celestia\po&quot; command

* Run &quot;perl translate_resources.pl&quot;. The translate_resources.pl script does: 
** translate resource files from po files -&gt; src/celestia/rc/celestia_LL.rc
** build dll files -&gt; src/celestia/rc/celestia_LL.res -&gt; locale/res_LL.dll 
** compile catalogs -&gt; locale/LL/LC_MESSAGES/celestia[_constellations].mo

==Building .txf font texture files==
Celestia uses its own .txf font textures to display the OpenGL overlay text.
Some non-Latin characters may be missing from the font textures wich are distributed with the standard Celestia package, though.&lt;br&gt;
In that case, please use the following process to build celestia ''.txf'' font textures from standard ''.ttf'' fonts:

* Download the txf utilities from http://www.shatters.net/~claurel/stuff/txfutil.tar.gz
* Generate the ''.txf'' files:
 ttf2txf -w 1048 -h 1048 -f codepoints_LL.txt -s 12 -o sans12_LL.txf font.ttf
 ttf2txf -w 1048 -h 1048 -f codepoints_LL.txt -s 14 -o sans14_LL.txf font.ttf
 ttf2txf -w 1048 -h 1048 -f codepoints_LL.txt -s 20 -o sansbold20_LL.txf font_bold.ttf

This will create the following font textures which should be placed in the ''font/'' dir:
* sans12_LL.txf
* sans14_LL.txf
* sansbold20_LL.txf.&lt;br&gt;

Note for Windows users:
* A pre-compiled version of ttf2txf is available at: http://gvince.perso.sfr.fr/celestia/dev/ttf2txf.zip
* The ''codepoints_LL.txt'' file is generated by running the ''translate_resources.pl'' perl script from the ''po/'' dir. See ''Building internationalization files from the source in MS Windows'' section above.

==Celestia translation overview==
The translation process currently applies to '''Celestia 1.6.1''' (development version).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hey, I sincerely appreciate the tutorials...

I'm wondering if you could post smaller pictures, however.  This page alone has 2,901,486 bytes of images and some of us still use dial-up.  It took me 15 minutes and several refreshes to get this page up in its entirety, and then I had to go to landscape mode to print it because the images were so wide.

I believe if you look more critically at your screenshots, you will agree that the same information can be conveyed by  1.)More selective cropping or 2.) Just plain resizing the CMP window before starting the screencapture process. 

Again, thanks for writing this stuff up.  Thanks for your time!

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Notation ==

I'm using the notation I prefer and am used to, although I realise that there are alternatives, and that we'll never get everyone to agree on a 'best' set of symbols.  This is the notation that was agreed upon across a consortium of Colleges centred on Brighton University from 1990 until (at least) the early 2000's when I finished teaching Discrete Maths on Computing Courses there.


I prefer &amp;rArr; to &amp;rarr; for 'implies'. &amp;rarr; is used for so many other things (limits: ''x'' &amp;rarr; 0, mappings ''a'' &amp;rarr; ''b'', etc) that it's good to draw a distinction sometimes.


And I prefer &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; to &amp;and; for AND; it ties in much more obviously with &amp;cap; in Set Theory. But it's a pain to get it to render correctly: I've had to use LaTeX &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Despite what it says on http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Help:Editing#Mathematical_formulas, if you use &amp;and ; (without the space), it is rendered &amp;and;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
One ordinarily thinks of a sound wave as consisting only of coupled pressure and position oscillations. In fact, temperature oscillations accompany the pressure oscillations and when there are spatial gradients in the temperature oscillations, oscillating heat flow occurs. The combination of these oscillations produces a rich variety of “thermoacoustic” effects. In everyday life, the thermal effects of sound are too small to be easily noticed; for example, the amplitude of the temperature oscillation in conversational levels of sound is only about 0.0001°C. However, in an extremely intense sound wave in a pressurized gas, these thermoacoustic effects can be harnessed to create powerful heat engines and refrigerators. Whereas typical engines and refrigerators rely on crankshaft-coupled pistons or rotating turbines, thermoacoustic engines and refrigerators have no moving parts (or at most only flexing parts without the need for sliding seals). This simplicity, coupled with reliability and relatively low cost, has highlighted the potential of thermoacoustic devices for practical use. As a result, thermoacoustics is maturing quickly from a topic of basic scientific research through the stages of applied research and on to important practical applications[1]. Recently, thermoacoustic phenomena have been employed in the medical field for imaging of tissues.

==History==
The history of thermoacoustic engines is long but sparsely populated. A review of Putnam and Dennis[2] describes experiments of Byron Higgins[3] in 1777 in which acoustic oscillations in a large pipe were excited by suitable placement of a hydrogen flame inside. The Rijke tube[4], an early extension of Higgins' work, is well known to modern acousticians. Higgins' research eventually evolved into the modern science of pulse combustions[5] whose applications have included the German V-I rocket (the &quot;buzz bomb&quot;) used in World War II and the residential pulse combustion furnace introduced by Lennox, Inc., in 1982. The Sondhaus tube is the earliest thermoacoustic engine that is a direct antecedent of the thermoacoustic prime movers. Over 100 years ago, glass blowers noticed that when a hot glass bulb was attached to a cool glass tubular stem, the stem tip sometimes emitted sound, and Sondhauss quantitatively investigated the relation between the pitch of the sound and the dimensions of the apparatus. 

The English physicist, Lord Rayleigh explained the Sondhauss tube qualitatively in 1896: &quot;In almost all cases where heat is communicated to a body, expansion ensues and this expansion may be made to do mechanical work. If the phases of the forces thus operative be favorable, a vibration may be maintained. For the sake of simplicity, a tube, hot at the closed end and getting gradually cooler towards the open end, may be considered. At a quarter of a period before the phase of greatest condensation, the air is moving inwards, i.e., towards the closed end, and therefore is passing from colder to hotter parts of the tube; but in fact the adjustment of temperature takes time, and thus the temperature of the air deviates from that of the neighboring parts of the tube, inclining towards the temperature of that part of the tube from which the air has just come. From this it follows that at the phase of greatest condensation heat is received by the air, and at the phase of greatest rarefaction heat is given up from it, and thus there is a tendency to maintain the vibrations.&quot;
 
The history of imposing acoustic oscillations on a gas to cause heat pumping and refrigeration effects is even briefer and more recent than the history of thermoacoustic prime movers. In a device called a pulse-tube refrigerator, Gifford and Longsworth produced  significant refrigeration by applying a very low-frequency high-amplitude pressure oscillation to the gas in a tube. As they explained the phenomenon, &quot;If any closed chamber is pressurized and depressurized by delivery and exhaustion of gas from one point on its surface and the flow is essentially smooth, heat pumping will occur away from the point on its surface,&quot; because of the temperature changes that accompany the pressure changes in the gas, and their time-phasing relative to the oscillatory gas flow.

==Principle of operation==
When a sound wave is sent down a half-wavelength tube with a vibrating diaphragm or a loudspeaker, the pressure pulsations make the gas inside slosh back and forth. This forms regions where compression and heating take place, plus other areas characterized by gas expansion and cooling.
[[Image:Working_principle.GIF|500px|Working principle]][[Image:Animation12.gif|500px|Working principle]]

A thermoacoustic refrigerator is a resonator cavity that contains a stack of thermal storage elements (connected to hot and cold heat exchangers) positioned so the back-and-forth gas motion occurs within the stack. The oscillating gas parcels pick up heat from the stack and deposit it to the stack at a different location. The device &quot;acts like a bucket brigade&quot; to remove heat from the cold heat exchanger and deposit it at the hot heat exchanger, thus forming the basis of a refrigeration unit. [http://www.memagazine.org/backissues/membersonly/march98/features/sound/coolsoun.html] The governing mathematical equations of the thermoacoustic phenomenon are given below.

[[Image:Thermoeqn1.JPG|700px|Working principle]]

===Standing-wave systems===
The thermoacoustic engine (TAE) is a device that converts heat energy into work in the form of acoustic energy. A thermoacoustic engine is operating using the effects that arise from the resonance of a standing-wave in a gas.  A standing-wave thermoacoustic engine typically has a thermoacoustic element called the “stack”. A stack is a solid component with pores that allow the operating gas fluid to oscillate while in contact with the solid walls. The oscillation of the gas is accompanied with the change of its temperature. Due to the introduction of solid walls into the oscillating gas, the plate modifies the original, unperturbed temperature oscillations in both magnitude and phase for the gas about a thermal penetration depth δ=√(2k/ω) away from the plate,&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; where k is the thermal diffusivity of the gas and ω=2πf is the angular frequency of the wave. Thermal penetration depth is defined as the distance that heat can diffuse though the gas during a time 1/ω. In air oscillating at 1000&amp;nbsp;Hz, the thermal penetration depth is about 0.1&amp;nbsp;mm. Standing-wave TAE must be supplied with the necessary heat to maintain the temperature gradient on the stack. This is done by two heat exchangers on both sides of the stack.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scribd.com/doc/147785416/Experimental-Investigations-on-a-Standing-Wave-Thermoacoustic-Engine#fullscreen M. Emam, Experimental Investigations on a Standing-Wave Thermoacoustic Engine, M.Sc. Thesis, Cairo University, Egypt (2013)].&lt;/ref&gt;

If we put a thin horizontal plate in the sound field the thermal interaction between the oscillating gas and the plate leads to thermoacoustic effects. If the thermal conductivity of the plate material would be zero the temperature in the plate would exactly match the temperature profiles as in Fig. 1b. Consider the blue line in Fig. 1b as the temperature profile of a plate at that position. The temperature gradient in the plate would be equal to the so-called critical temperature gradient. If we would fix the temperature at the left side of the plate at ambient temperature ''T''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; (e.g. using a heat exchanger) then the temperature at the right would be below ''T''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;. In other words: we have produced a cooler. This is the basis of thermoacoustic cooling as shown in Fig. 2b which represents a thermoacoustic refrigerator. It has a loudspeaker at the left. The system corresponds with the left half of Fig. 1b with the stack in the position of the blue line. Cooling is produced at temperature ''T''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;.

It is also possible to fix the temperature of the right side of the plate at ''T''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; and heat up the left side so that the temperature gradient in the plate would be larger than the critical temperature gradient. In that case we have made an engine (prime mover) which can e.g. produce sound as in Fig. 2a. This is a so-called thermoacoustic prime mover. Stacks can be made of stainless steel plates but the device works also very well with loosely packed stainless steel wool or screens. It is heated at the left, e.g., by a propane flame and heat is released to ambient temperature by a heat exchanger. If the temperature at the left side is high enough the system starts to produces a loud sound.

Thermoacoustic engines still suffer from some limitations, including that:
* The device usually has low power to volume ratio.
* Very high densities of operating fluids are required to obtain high power densities
* The commercially-available linear alternators used to convert acoustic energy into electricity currently have low efficiencies compared to rotary electric generators
* Only expensive specially-made alternators can give satisfactory performance.
* TAE uses gases at high pressures to provide reasonable power densities which imposes sealing challenges particularly if the mixture has light gases like helium.

* The heat exchanging process in TAE is critical to maintain the power conversion process. The hot heat exchanger has to transfer heat to the stack and the cold heat exchanger has to sustain the temperature gradient across the stack. Yet, the available space for it is constrained with the small size and the blockage it adds to the path of the wave. The heat exchange process in oscillating media is still under extensive research. 

* The acoustic waves inside a thermoacoustic engines operated at large pressure ratios suffer many kinds of non-linearities such as turbulence which dissipates energy due to viscous effects,  harmonic generation of different frequencies that carries acoustic power in frequencies other than the fundamental frequency. 
The performance of thermoacoustic engines usually is characterized through several indicators as follows:&lt;ref&gt;G.W. Swift, A unifying perspective for someengines and refrigerators, Acoustical Society of America, Melville, (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;
* The first and second law efficiencies.
* The onset temperature difference, defined as the minimum temperature difference across the sides of the stack at which the dynamic pressure is generated.
* The frequency of the resultant pressure wave, since this frequency should match the resonance frequency required by the load device, either a thermoacoustic refrigerator/heat pump or a linear alternator.
* The degree of harmonic distortion, indicating the ratio of higher harmonics to the fundamental mode in the resulting dynamic pressure wave.
* The variation of the resultant wave frequency with the TAE operating temperature

===Travelling-wave systems===
Figure 3 is a schematic drawing of a travelling-wave thermoacoustic engine. It consists of a resonator tube and a loop which contains a regenerator, three heat exchangers, and a bypass loop.  A regenerator is a porous medium with a high heat capacity. As the gas flows back and forth through the regenerator it periodically stores and takes up heat from the regenerator material. In contrast to the stack, the pores in the regenerator are much smaller than the thermal penetration depth, so the thermal contact between gas and material is very good. Ideally the energy flow in the regenerator is zero, so the main energy flow in the loop is from the hot heat exchanger via the pulse tube and the bypass loop to the heat exchanger at the other side of the regenerator (main heat exchanger). The energy in the loop is transported via a travelling wave as in Fig. 1c, hence the name travelling-wave systems. The ratio of the volume flows at the ends of the regenerator is ''T''&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;/''T''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;, so the regenerator acts as a volume-flow amplifier.
Just like in the case of the standing-wave system the machine “spontaneously” produces sound if the temperature ''T''&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; is high enough. The resulting pressure oscillations can be used in a variety of ways such as in producing electricity, cooling, and heat pumping.

==Thermoacoustic machines==
There are two basic kinds of thermoacoustic machines:
# Thermoacoustic prime movers
# Thermoacoustic refrigerator
[[Image:Poese.jpg|right|550px|A standing wave demonstration refrigerator]]

==Basic components of a thermoacoustic system==
A thermoacoustic machine generally consists of:
# Acoustic driver
# Stack or regenerator
# Heat exchanger
# Resonator

==Acoustic driver==

Electrodynamic drivers are used in a class of electrically driven thermoacoustic refrigeration systems. The mechanical and electrical characteristics of the driver, in conjunction with the acoustic load impedance at the driver piston, determine the electroacoustic efficiency of the actuator. The electroacoustic efficiency is, of course, a key factor in the overall efficiency of the cooling system. For this reason, it is useful to develop models that allow the efficiency of any such driver to be predicted for varying operating conditions and loads. A detailed description of linear models of loudspeakers using equivalent electrical circuits is readily available.[2] [[Image:Driver_ckt.jpg|frame|Equivalent electrical circuit of an electroacoustic driver]]
Several methods based on such linear models have been proposed in order to determine the model parameters experimentally.

==Stack==
In the thermoacoustic refrigerator the stack is the main component where the thermoacoustic phenomenon takes place. Below shown are two stacks of different materials used in a standing wave thermoacoustic refrigerator.

[[Image:Ceramic2.JPG|400px|A ceramic stack]]  [[Image:Stack2.JPG|400px|A parallel plate stack]]
==Heat exchanger==
The heat exchangers employed in a thermoacoustic refrigerator influence the acoustic field created in the resonator. There are many design constraints such as porosity of the heat exchanger and high heat transfer coefficient for efficiency. Due to these constraints, special kind of heat exchangers are used. One typical micro channel aluminum heat exchanger is shown below.

[[Image:Hx1.jpg|400px|Heat exchanger]]

==Resonator==
This the part of refrigerator which is only there for maintaining the acoustic wave. Because it is a dead volume which causes heat loss and adds bulk, quarter wavelength resonators are preferred over half wavelength.

Laptops  and the Growth of Wireless Internet

Laptops are more than just a convenience for modern computer buffs. They have become such an integral part of today’s technology that new paradigms have been built around them. Mobile professionals, the military, law enforcement agencies, schools and governments use them in ways that desktop computers could never support. Computers confined to ivory towers are a thing of the past; today’s mobile agencies can access computer technology at the site where it is most needed. Since laptops can be taken virtually anywhere, they can support lab and office technology right in the field. They can be hooked up directly to probes to gather data, evaluate that data, and help determine a course of action on the spot. Immediate access to reference data and the ability to communicate in real time have transformed the way business is done in today’s world. All this is of course related to the spread of the wireless data technology known as Wi-Fi, which has reshaped the way millions of people go online, letting them tap into high-speed Internet connections effortlessly at home and in many public places. 
Mobile professionals are the most visible users of laptop technology. Professionals such as sales representatives, insurance adjusters, and field technicians can use laptops for communication from the field and real-time reporting as well as immediate computing at the remote site. Business executives can much more easily access large bodies of corporate data by laptop than by lugging around hard-copy ledgers. This translates into better business performances, quicker access  to important data, and lets’ not forget the fact that the laptops  give us the opportunity to multitask just as a CPU does on a computer. The typical example is using a laptop anywhere and combining its use with our daily activities in order to save time; during lunch or breakfast, even at the coffee place where you can relax and socialize. Another important detail is that laptops prices have considerably decreased over the years which contributed to their popularity.
However, every convenience has its cost. In the wireless technology one of the down sides is the security and the vulnerability of a Wi-Fi network. Federal and state law enforcement officials say sophisticated criminals have begun to use the unsecured and vulnerable Wi-Fi networks of unsuspecting consumers and businesses to help cover their tracks in cyberspace. In the wired world, it was often difficult for lawbreakers to make themselves untraceable on the Internet. In the wireless world, with scores of open Wi-Fi networks in some neighborhoods, it could hardly be easier.  Experts say most of those households never turn on any of the features, available in almost all Wi-Fi routers. Failure to secure the network in those ways can allow anyone with a Wi-Fi-enabled computer within about 200 feet to tap into the base station's Internet connection, typically a digital subscriber line or a cable modem. 
Another inconvenience that was discovered in recent times is the heath issues associated with the usage of wireless communications. Questions of safety have been raised, citing that long term exposure to electromagnetic radiation of the sort emitted by wireless networks may someday prove to be dangerous. Poor concentration, memory loss, nausea, premature senility and even cancer have been discovered to be caused by the WI-FI technology usage.  This is in part true with cellular phones but how about laptops? Well, laptops are often used extensively in environments which do not have suitable lighting. Additionally, laptops often have screens that are not as clear, stable or bright as normal monitors and it is possible that users may be exposed to a greater risk of developing vision fatigue as a consequence. Furthermore, laptops and their accessories are typically in excess of 5 kilograms of weight. Although this comes within the accepted normal load, often it has to be carried along with other loads for a long time. Laptops are often used on laboratory benches, unsuitable desks and tables at home, on trains or in hotel room with limited legroom, poor seating and incorrect screen positions. Therefore, there is a considerable amount of risk involved of developing a wide range of health problems from poor ergonomic environments.
One solution for the security issues that occur very frequently with the wireless networks and especially when using a laptop is to make sure that the security settings are turned on which means to  change the system's default settings, conceal the connection from others and encrypt the data sent over it. Also setting secure password combinations on the &quot;BIOS&quot; or &quot;boot time&quot; in order to lock the system before Windows even starts and setting a complex administrator password is also a must. As far as the health hazards goes, one has to inform itself on the consequences of using a laptop or any WI-FI technology and how it can affect them if it’s used during long periods of time. This is very important especially to the Mobile professionals as they are more at risk than the casual user.
What the future holds for the laptop technology?  One thing is for sure; it will get more popular every year. Arimasa Naitoh, the father of the ThinkPad and Lenovo's worldwide VP of Development, provided some useful insights into the future of laptop computing. Fuel-cell battery technology isn't mature. Battery life will also be of supreme importance as we move closer towards laptops that can run for a full working day on a single battery. Naitoh promised that, within the next two years, Lenovo will have a notebook that runs for eight hours using Lithium Ion technology as fuel-cell technology still has a long way to go, particularly in terms of longevityy. As far as the design goes, ThinkPad concept designs with innovations such as raising displays and removable keyboards. It will also continue to roll out WWAN support (allowing users to connect their notebooks up to 3G mobile networks for Web surfing on the go) across its notebook range. This is already available on Lenovo's T and X series of products.
Another very improved feature on a laptop will be the storage drive. With traditional magnetic-based hard drives hitting a storage ceiling, the next quantum leap will involve the use of nanotechnology and organic materials. The main advantages: Terabytes of data literally at the tip of your fingers and no more worries about mechanical failure. 
The conclusion will be a citation from an article published on October 2nd, 2008 http://www.digitalhome.ca/content/view/2923/280/   , which reflects the future tendencies of laptop usage:
“Currently, 43% of all online Canadians have a laptop computer in their home. One-third (31%) of current laptop owners plan to upgrade their machines in the next two years. Among those online Canadians who do not currently own a laptop computer, slightly more than one-quarter (27%) plan to purchase one in the next two years. Study author Mark Laver notes: “Laptop price points have been dropping rapidly in the last few years—a basic laptop is currently lower than $550 and some laptops in the sub-notebook category come in under $350. These prices bring a basic model within reach of many online Canadians. Perhaps not surprisingly, a similar percentage (45%) of online Canadians also owns a wireless router. Wireless router ownership in the next two years is predicted to rise by 10%, with 55% of all online Canadians having one in their household”.

Part I - All We Need Is Love


A LOVE STORY

This is a love story.  

I have never written a story before, let alone a love story.

All right, so it is not the typical love story.  It is not Romeo and Juliet, or anything like that.

It is the Three Red Cups love story.  It is how I see God trying to pour his love on us, so that we can in turn pour our love on others, and they can in turn…well, you get the picture.  A constant stream of the purest love.

Picture, if you will, Three Red Cups.









Suppose I am the Red Cup in the middle, 
Feeling insufficient, depleted, aimless, or judged,
Trying so hard to be perfect
And yet always coming up short,
Always wondering what I’m doing wrong.

I simply tilt to the left to receive God’s love
As a pure stream pouring down on me. 

Filled with his grace, I tilt effortlessly to the right 
and fill the cups of others.  
They receive God’s love through me.

Each of us can be that Red Cup in the middle, 
receiving God’s love in such abundance 
that nothing will do but that we share it with others.

 
WHY ME?

Why in the world would you be interested in what I have to say about God’s love?

You would not.  I know that.  Don’t even bother reading my little biography at the back of this book.  You’ll see that I’m an ordinary man without whatever credentials you might expect for taking on one of the most important subjects in the whole world.

But – and this is a huge “but” – God wants me to be a messenger for him.  I know this as well as I know anything.  I still feel a little presumptuous asking you to read it, but I don’t feel embarrassed.  I’m supposed to do this. 

God has this message of love that he wants me to deliver for him.  It’s not about me, and I wish I could write it without using “I” and “me” all the time.  If I could figure out a way of delivering the message without inserting myself, I would do that.  I tried.  But here I am, so you see how that turned out.

Still, I am thrilled to deliver this message at God’s bidding.  In no way do I feel “chosen” or any other kind of special.  I just feel “available”.  Well, a little more than that.  The message of love  he has asked to deliver resonates so profoundly with me that I am more excited—more “in love”—than I have ever been in my whole life.

Why did he pick me to write this book?  I don’t know.   I am not an expert on God’s word.  I am not one of those people who can recall just the right Bible chapter and verse for every occasion, although I love those words and admire those who can.  I am not a theologian.  I am not even much of a writer; I am lucky to know Ann who helped me.  

And I’m certainly not perfect.  I am a businessman, husband, father, friend, and a reasonably conscientious member of my chosen small communities of people, but I have all the flaws and failings of the most ordinary of mortals.

If I do have a talent, it is what a colleague once told me:  “You have made a career out of simplifying.”  I realize he might have been damning with faint praise; maybe I had just said something embarrassingly obvious.  But still it is true.  I believe I bring at least this to the task at hand—the ability to re-simplify today a message that was simple enough when it was first delivered more than 2000 years ago.  Love me; love others as I have loved you.  

That’s all.  That’s completely all.  “For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son…”  And all he asks in return is:  Love me; love others as I have loved you.  

The image of the red cups came to me at a party one day as I stood enjoying myself, holding one of those red cups that were (still are?) standard issue at college keg parties.  I’ve always associated red cups with the carefree feeling of taking pleasure in the company of others.  To me red cups are the icon for “Live Well, Laugh Often, and Love Much.”  Today I don’t act the same way I did back when I first appreciated a few too many red cups, but I am still the same man, and I still love the look and feel of red cups.  They still stand for what they did back then, but now they have so much more significance.  Now I know what “love much” means.

I am writing this book because God is asking me to take this message directly to his people without the being drowned out by society’s competing, undermining messages.  According to a recent survey, only five out of 100 entertainment executives are Christians.  Only 5% of the people who make decide what to make available for children to see, hear, and learn from potentially believes in the simple message of Christ.  

So He is speaking through me, asking me to help start a movement that he intends to take across the world.  Could he have chosen a different mechanism?  Sure.  Could he have sent his son again to restate the message again about what we are to do here on earth?  Of course.  But he chose me – as he has often chosen ordinary or less than ordinary people to carry out his wishes.  I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that this book is written by him through me.  Period.  He desperately wants all of us – Christians, Non-Christians, Jews, Muslims, Sinners, Non-Sinners (oops, there are none) to strip away everything that is not love and open themselves up to the true meaning of his message.

Maybe this book isn’t for you.  Maybe you are fully at peace without it or maybe this subject is too simple or naïve.  In that case, please return it for a full refund.  Otherwise, stick with me here – because He’s with me, and this will be joyful.


WHAT HAPPENED TO CHRIST’S MESSAGE?

What happened to His simple little message of love?  He was pretty clear about it then.  It’s not like the crucifixion of Christ didn’t make a big splash in its time.  He was conveying the love thing all along.  Even on the cross he said, “Forgive them, for they know not what they do.”  

And it’s not like nobody’s been talking about it lately.  His followers have been multiplying all these years, building churches, writing books, singing hymns, saying prayers, and taking the message far and wide.  Christianity is the world’s biggest religion with about 2 billion people, or about 33% of the world’s whole population.  So the word is out there plenty.

But consider how the message is conveyed by so many who profess to believe most ardently in his teachings.  The message gets buried under layers of dogma; THIS  is how God is to be loved, and in no other way.  This formula for worship, these prayers, this hierarchy, those apostates.

Or it arrives loaded with judgment and guilt; you are not good enough, you don’t deserve God’s love.  When he said “everybody’s” sins, you didn’t suppose he meant yours if you’re gay, or on  if you’re gay, or on the other side of the DMZ, or behind bars, or 

It may arrive subordinated to the biases of believers; Love THIS God, and that neighbor – and shun others.  It might be corrupted by the power hungry; Love God, kill those who don’t.

My heart sank when I read about a study recently.  “A decade ago the vast majority of Americans outside the Christian faith, including young people, felt favorably toward Christianity’s role in society.  Currently, however, just 16% of non-Christians in their late teens and twenties said they have a ‘good impression’ of Christianity.” (http://thegreatrealization.wordpress.com/2008/01/17/young-people-rejecting-christianity-view-it-as-homophobic/)

Disheartened, I read further and learned:  Fully 72 percent of “unchurched” Americans see churches as places full of hypocrites.  And 79 percent think that Christianity today is more about organized religion than about loving God and loving people.  (Christian Post Reporter, Jan 8, 2008)

How, I wondered, could so many have come to those conclusions about following a religion named for someone who died for love of us?

Clearly, the pure simplicity of the message has been lost.  In Lord, Save Us from Your Followers, Dan Merchant writes, “Christianity is turning into a bad word with dubious meaning in American society because we (Christians) don’t care how we sound to those who don’t agree with us.  He boils it down to just one question and poses it this way as he pursues the answer in interviews across the country:  Why Is the Gospel of Love Dividing America?  It’s shocking to see how many of Christ’s follows have hijacked his message for their own agenda.

He tells a heart-rending story of apologizing to gays for how they have been reviled by some Christians.  One gay woman responds to him this way. “I want to thank you for speaking this to me.  I appreciate hearing the words.  It does a lot to heal my heart.  I was just thinking the same thing, How could Jesus’ followers hate us so much?  So it’s lovely to hear this from you and know that all of you don’t hate us.”

Lovely to learn that Jesus’ followers don’t hate her!  Do you think the message might have gone awry somewhere?


EARNING LOVE

It’s not just Christians scolding other people who make a mess of the message.  Sometimes it’s the way we talk to ourselves.  

We make ourselves miserable by striving too hard and flailing ourselves for our inevitable failure.  Our pride tells us we must be perfect, and when we are not, we forget the message and indulge in guilt.  Many of us come by that trait honestly, guilt and shame being twin pillars of many Christian groups, where forgiveness is eked out by a stingy God who, they claim keeps score and reserves his love for the “perfect” believer.

It kills me when I see good, decent, striving people, so weighted by guilt, shame, and anxiety that they can hardly remember why they believe in God in the first place.  I want to say, “Look, he’s God, you’re not.  He didn’t say be perfect, and he didn’t say be miserable when you’re not.  Give him your troubles, and let his love flow over you.”  

Being a follower of Christ isn’t supposed to be a free pass to perfection.  It’s supposed to be hard, else we would not value it.  Of course we will be tempted – that’s why we have free will.  We’re expected to make mistakes – that’s how we learn.  It doesn’t change the world or us – it guides us to be in the world.

In Anna Karenina, Levin undergoes a profound and joyous conversion to faith.  Tolstoy writes of Levin moments after his conversion, “It seemed to him that his relations with everyone would now be changed.  “There will be no disputes; with Kitty never any quarrel again; …I shall be amiable and kind; and with the servants, with Ivan, everything will be different.”  And yet three paragraphs later he snaps at Ivan his coachman.  “He immediately felt how wrong had been his conclusion that his spiritual condition could at once alter his manner when confronted with reality.”

We are confronted with the reality of our lives every moment of the day.  Perfection is not only unrealistic.  It wouldn’t even please him.

I picture God saying to us, “Hold on, PEOPLE.  I know it’s more than 2000 years since I sent my son to earth to forgive sin and show each of you the path to me.  But aren’t we a tad off-message here?

“I didn’t send him so that you could see a perfect person in the flesh and strive to be more like him.  That’s impossible.  Really, it is.  You can’t do better for me by striving for perfection.  You need to make your efforts less about you and all about others.

“I sent my only son and what did he do?  He died for your sins.  All of them.  All of you.  So what is all this guilt and anxiety I see?  His was the ultimate sacrifice.  I don’t want sacrifice from you.  I want to love you.  And I want you to love others as I love you.  I want that flow of love to replace all the other bitter flows I see around the world.  Please, just give me your troubles, and let me love you.” 

When I hear him saying those words, the image of the Three Red Cups is vivid.  I see him begging me to tilt my cup his way.  But I know that I had a hard time learning to do that.  Self-sufficient people shouldn’t have to working at turning to God, should they?  Shouldn’t it be easy to just say, “Take my troubles, Lord, and fill my cup.  Your will, not mine.  Your way, not mine.”


 
Part II – Turn to Him.  Tilt Your Cup to the Left


Sometimes I’ll ask a close friend, “What does God look like to you?”  You’d be amazed at some of the answers.  But I think of one friend in particular when I think about why it’s so hard for some of us to tilt our cups to the left. 

Think about that for a second here.  By tilting to the left I mean saying, in effect:  “My own cup is empty, Lord.  I can’t do that loving others thing because I’m too depleted and too weighted down by troubles.  So take my troubles, and pour your love on me.  Fill my cup.  Fill me.”  With perfect assurance that he will indeed do that very thing.

Now why should that be so hard to do?  That doesn’t make sense, does it?  That’s all you have to do to make you so happy that happy doesn’t begin to cover it – to get peace so deep that it’s indescribable, and yet it’s -- excuse me -- too hard to do?  

That’s like hearing a Powerball winner complain, “Now I have to take this lousy piece of paper to a lawyer.  I’ll have to drive to the bank.  I’ll have to tell the family we’re rich.  Oh, it’s just too hard!”

What’s the difference between the lottery and the Lord?  Maybe this:  People know that winning the lottery will fill up their bank account.  But many people – including devout, believing Christians – in their heart of hearts don’t truly believe that God will fill their cup – that there is nothing he desires more than to see that cup tilting over and to fill it with his merciful, infinite, healing love.

Anyway, when I wonder why it’s hard for some people, I think of this one friend and how she answered me when I asked, “What does God look like to you?”

“Well,” she answered, “The hem of his robe is trimmed in gold – how’s that?  Not sure I’ve looked up past that – not sure I need to see one more stern, disapproving look.  I know when I’m not living up to snuff, and it would frankly be a lot easier to self-correct if he weren’t up there glowering.”  She said it with a smile and some irony – but still, she meant it well enough.  For her, raised to be god-fearing, she had – surprise! – learned to fear the all-seeing and all-judging God.  Now, as an adult, she is over the fear but resists the indignity of criticism and judgment.

“My friend!” I wanted say – maybe I did say.  “He is not judging you.  When you are ready to skip the hem and look all the way up to his eyes, they are the warmest, most loving eyes you have ever seen!  I know because I’ve seen them.  That’s the gift I got when I finally learned to tilt my cup to the left.” 

And it’s true.  God is not judging her day in and day out.  She’s judging herself because that is what she learned.  Intellectually, she knows exactly what’s going on, but instinctively, when her cup is low, and she glances to the left and sees that golden hem, the last thing she wants to do is turn her cup to the left and have it filled with judgment.  So she averts her eyes and continues to try to do God’s will without his love.  How sad is that?  

And sadder, how common is that?

In Finding the God Who Is Love, an essay by Fr. Andrew Kimel that moved me almost to tears, we learn how that happens.  First, he writes, there’s a narrative goes something like this:

“God is angry with us, and he’s been angry with us since the day we were born. But if we repent of our sins, he will change his mind, forgive us, and give us eternal life, as long as we continue to believe in him and avoid mortal sins. But we need to be careful, because if we trip up, God will turn on us at a moment’s notice.”

By way of example, he goes on:

Look at the parable of the prodigal son… (who) acknowledges how his sin has altered his relationship to his father: “I am no longer worthy to be called your son; treat me as one of your hired servants.” But what precisely has changed? Has the father ceased to love his son? Has he become the angry patriarch the son now fears him to be? On the contrary, the father has been waiting for his son to return, and upon seeing him in the distance, he jubilantly rushes to greet and welcome him home. No, what has changed is the son. Because of his sin, the prodigal is no longer capable of seeing the father as he really is.
                       
It is hard to tilt your cup to the left when you expect to find only punishment there.


SACRIFICING FOR LOVE

“Try harder.”  So many people, seeking to fill their own cups, try so awfully hard.  It can be heart-breaking to watch them.  They try as though it is all up to them – as though God wants them to go through a lot of misery to earn his love.

And let’s face it, there’s plenty of precedent for that kind striving.  Just look at the Old Testament and all the sacrifices expected of people.  Abraham sacrificing his son Isaac in the mountains of Moriah.  The entire population of Jericho annihilated for the purpose of appeasing an angry God.  

The people in the Old Testament thought they had to make sacrifices to gain God’s love and forgiveness.  That’s a lot of pressure – feeling that you will be in trouble with God if you pick the wrong goat.  That you’ll fall out of favor and be banished to the wilderness if your altar isn’t up to snuff.

Okay, maybe they did have to do that.  There was a lot of smiting and condemning going on back then.  But the last thing I want to do here is get in a scripture war.  I’ll probably lose it, but that’s not why.  It’s because I know, as well as I know I’m supposed to write this book, that I’m not supposed to make a sacrifice of my son or anything of that sort.  

Neither are you.  That was then.  After that, God gave his only son for us, who suffered and died for our sins.  This is now.  This time around, his message is about love.  No more burnt goats, no more beheadings in his name.  This time it’s a message of pure, infinite love for us, asking in return only (I just wanted an excuse to say it again), Love me; love others as I have loved you.

There’s a great phrase out there – “Red Letter Christian.”  It refers, of course, to the words in the Bible that Christ actually spoke which are rendered in red in many Bibles.  I like that.  While the Red Letter Christian movement was actually started by several religious leaders to transcend the partisan political maneuverings that threaten to hijack Christianity, the phrase works equally well in the broadest way.  Being a red letter Christian means letting Christ’s words of love and forgiveness stand on their own, without the agenda-laden interpretations of others or even ourselves.  I’d like to be a red letter Christian.

The rough stuff isn’t confined to the Old Testament.  It seems like the desire to sacrifice and appease harsh gods runs strong in most culture and most religions on all continents.  People try to appease the gods with pain and sacrifice rather than doing good for one another.

Let me tell you about my father.  Andy, maybe we don’t want to use this – or else maybe we make it “a man you were close to”?  Thought of that when I heard Obama expose his grandmother …  He was raised a Catholic in the strictest sense, trained to be a Catholic priest but left the seminary to marry and have a family.  His training, coupled with his own sense of having failed to live up to what had been expected of him, left him almost crippled, it seems to me know.  Unable to express his love – perhaps unable to love himself.  Let’s talk about this before I write any more…

I have another friend, reared attentively, thoughtfully, purposefully by devoted Catholic parents in the close embrace of the Catholic Church.  Went to Daily Mass and weekly Catechism, took the sacraments and observed all the rituals.  Her home life was suffused with daily prayers, regular novenas, nightly rosary, religious music, and almost daily celebrations of saints’ feast days.  Her own “Feast Day” – the special day of the saint for which she was named – was as celebrated as her birthday.

Her parents were loving and no doubt meant to impart a love of the Catholic religion to her.  But the formative part of her childhood religious experience was the anxiety and fear of offending an easily angered and punitive God, not a loving one.  In matters of God, her parents’ loving nature became judging and fearful.  As adolescence dawned her nature resisted the lovelessness of her Catholic experience.  A gulf grew between her and her church, her and her parents.   While kindness, love, beauty, humor, hope graced much of her life, it was for years shadowed and punctuated by guilt, anxiety, shame, punishment.

She withdrew from religion, and in doing so withdrew from God for many years.  Now, only in middle age is she enjoying the peace of seeking out the loving nature of Christ.

Not to remotely suggest that Catholics have a corner on harshness.  I doubt there is a religion in the world that does not have its overzealous interpreters, its sanctimonious practitioners, or those who preach and practice their religion out of fear and guilt, shaming people and leaving them feeling like failures.  My only point is that even among the best-intentioned, like my friends’ parents, when people subordinate God’s message of love and harken back to the days of sacrifice and punishment, they create pain and suffering.


SUFFERING AND THE AMERICAN DREAM

Why do so many people seem to suffer so, even in the middle of doing exactly what they choose to do?  Why is happiness so elusive even while their lives seem to be so good?  

I think I know at least part of the reason.  They feel empty and desire to be filled.  They have been taught that to be filled, they must strive to be like God, to be like Jesus.  &quot;What would Jesus do?&quot; people ask.  That's worth pondering, but to me it's the wrong question, if what you really want to know is &quot;What out I to do?  Not to be rude, but, you're not Jesus.  He was God, and God knew it.  God is perfect today, and he was brilliant when he created heaven and earth.
And when he lived on earth, He was flat awesome!  He spent his life on earth loving and showing us how to love.  Not to be exactly like him!  But to love God and love one another.  I believe he sent his son to die for our sins and to show us that his love of his father and of others is THE message.  The question is not, “What would Jesus do?” but, “How would Jesus love?”
Remember what he did on earth?  He spent time with people, truly with them and not in some Biblical-age headquarters or palace.  He coached those he met.  He taught them.  He loved them.  Even when He got mad, it was tough love-mad, not you're-bad-you're-a-failure-mad.  He walked from town to town pouring out love.  Especially, He loved those who had no one else to love them.  He made disciples to help carry His gospel of love.
And when He was running on empty, he slipped away and restored himself with time alone with his father.  He didn't judge those who judged Him.  He didn't refute what people said He was.  Even sentenced to die on the cross, He didn't fight the sentence.  He knew this was the plan – that by being fully available to His father, His father's love would fill Him and THEN enable him to pour that love on others.  

This is not to say that we should not strive to be like him, but to say that we will always fall short of being like him.  I’m saying it’s time to re-think and re-absorb the main message he left us with after his short time with us on earth.  

Why did he say that the two most important commands are to love God and to love others?  Think of all the other commands he might have made.  Why those two?  Why did he spend all of his adult life as he did?  He could have spent his time with the powerful, teaching them.  He could have – well, why even finish that thought?  He could work miracles so he could have done anything, and yet he chose to walk from town to town, pouring love on ordinary people.
Not that it was easy.  It was hard – even for Him.  But he knew that the plan was for him to die for our sins – all of them.  Not only to free ourselves from sin but to free ourselves from perfection!  All of us!  Each and every person.  Not just Christians.  Not just the virtuous.  Not just the hale and hearty, but the venal, the leper, the unbeliever – every one of us.   Thanks to his sacrifice we can each choose to be free of perfection, free of guilt, free of anxiety.  We are free to do the only thing he wants from us – to love.  For that he suffered a brutal, painful death on the cross.  All for one thing only – for love.
 So, in light of what he did, look how our pitiful strivings for perfection compare.  What heroic act can we conjure to outdo his?  Exactly.  None.  So let us relinquish the guilt and anxiety.  I want to say:  Tilt to the left and allow him to take over your life.  He made each of you in his image, and his love is unconditional.
My friend whose view of God is his golden hem?  The message of Jesus is not about what he would do but rather how would he Love.  A woman fearful of looking in the eyes of the most loving person to walk on this earth is left striving to be like him but without feeling the mercy of his love.

DREAMING SHARED DREAMS

But it’s not just guilt or fear that makes it hard to tilt one’s cup to the left.  We’re hardwired with another kind of striving.  We strive mightily to live up to society’s expectations and to our own dreams of the life we are supposed to have.

I think of that Ecclesiastes passage about the weary man.  “So I hated life, because the work that is done under the sun was grievous to me. All of it is meaningless, a chasing after the wind.” 

If you’re normal, you may have dreamed of a certain kind of life every since you were a child.  That’s the life you’re supposed to have now, isn’t it?  I know I myself spent many years in that dreaming and striving mode.  All my life, society told me what was important – success in school, success in athletics, success in business.  Having certain things.  Living a certain lifestyle.  Playing a certain role.

Is society so wrong?  Is it foolish to follow one’s dream?  I would ask, is it only your dream, or is it also His?  (Yes, He dreams, I think.  He could, after all, make us do whatever he wants, but he doesn’t.  He gives us free will and hopes we choose His way.)  If at some point your strivings seem pointless, maybe your dream and His are different.

We dream of prosperity.  His dream is for us to enjoy and the richness of his love.  We dream of happiness here and now.  He plans on using our pain to show that pain, with Christ, is tolerable.   We dream of a beautiful home.  He plans that we live in a mansion to show that the socio-economic position of some means nothing to who and what they are.  (Andy, I struggled to understand this paragraph…)

(Should we here be debunking the myth of pain and anxiety here?  Not saying that your life should be without them – that you should see to escape them.  But neither are you to embrace them as your desserts – maybe like Mom does?  Pain and anxiety are how we grow…not what we suffer like martyrs…)

How remarkably proud we are – to believe that our position on earth is all up to us.  That we are in control.  That we can just vow to tackle the next adversity in pursuit of OUR dreams.  How barbaric, really, to suppose that He made us, but then left us alone to fight for our position on earth.  As though he would make us and then leave who we become entirely up to us.  He made us but now we have only society to turn to for approbation.

I think of Jason Upton’s poignant lyrics in Dying Star.  With all our striving, if we only turn the light on ourselves, we are missing the point.  If we act for others, they will see Him, shining through me:

Star how beautiful you shine
You shine more beautiful than mine
You shine from sea to shining sea
World-wide is your strategy
But shining star I hope you see
If the whole wide world is staring straight at you
They can't see me...

It’s not like we were leading a life of crime, or doing anything shameful.  We try to be good and do good.   We try to make our parents proud, run a good business, be a good boss, good employee, good parent, good spouse, good friend.

Maybe that’s why at some point, in the lives of so many of us, our strivings seem pointless and our dreams lose their charm.  Such moments can be terrifying for some.  A life suddenly without anchor, without purpose, without satisfaction – full of striving but empty of satisfaction. 

We can react by desperately seizing a new dream.  We can ramp up our expectations.  We can take refuge in nostalgia.  Or sink into despair.  Fight or flight.

Or how about another way?  What if we simply said, “Your turn, God.”  I tried it my way. I have I tried hard, and even in my successes I seem to have failed.  I’ve been driving this life bus hard, whiteknuckled and speeding, and here I am in the ditch.  So it’s your turn.”

That’s hard.  You’ve been “leading” your life and now you’re saying, “You lead, I’ll follow.”  But what does that mean?  What choices are you to make now?  What are you to do?

Makes you pine for the Garden of Eden, doesn’t it?  Back then, when we were perfect and content, we didn’t have choice.  But then that stuff happened and we ended up with choice.  We get to choose how we will live our lives.  Sounds nice on one level, but in reality it’s hard.

God desperately wants us to choose His way, but he leaves it to us.  And when we give up on our own dreams and turn to him, he could not be happier.  When we take him all our failures and all our disappointments – all our sins, he doesn’t exact a price – he welcomes them.  Are you a cheater?  A conniver?  A hypocrite?  He doesn’t care – he’s seen it all.  He’s not judging you, he is welcoming you.  Any little judging voice[[Image:[[Image:Example.jpg]]{{subject|{{subject|User:Three_Red_Cups}}}}]] that you hear is probably the echo of your own old worries.  He wants it all, no exceptions.  He takes it all.  He empties you of your shortcomings.  He’s glad to have you back.   And He rewards you by filling you up with his love.

And that is a feeling like nothing else I have ever experienced, I have to say.  I like to say, “He will wear you out” because that’s exactly how I experience it when I give it all up to him, and his love pours over me.
 
But that doesn’t mean it’s always easy.  I was surprised to discover how much strength it takes to give up.  Sounds perverse, but it’s true.  All our lives, we congratulate ourselves on having things under “control.”  Control is why we’re winning.  Never, ever give up.  We’re tough, that’s why we’re winning.  And so on.

Now suddenly I’m expected to…. GIVE UP?  Explain this to me, I said the first time.  Why precisely should I let go of what has been serving me pretty well, thank you?  Why should I put my faith in something I can’t see?

Good question.  I couldn’t answer it for myself, and I can’t really answer it for you.  But here’s how I did at least satisfy myself on the matter, thanks to my brother.  He said, “It’s the Internet and the ant, Andy.  You could explain the Internet all day long to an ant or a whole farm of ants.  Would they get it?  Nope.  Is the Internet real?  Yep.”

So, it’s not just faith we’re talking about, but a leap of faith.  You wouldn’t take the leap, probably, if your bus weren’t in the ditch or at least swerving down the road.  But when you’re at that point – when your dreams appear to be only yours, when your strivings are not taking you closer to happiness, then the leap is easier, I hope.

Let’s say you don’t.  I’m close to someone who doesn’t – at least so far she hasn’t.  

I’m not saying it will be easy.  And if you’re already doing fine without it – if you already have this thing called “life” figured out and perfected, just give this book away or send it back to me for a refund.  But if you’re like most of us, then let’s get really, really serious for a second.   

GOD wants you to tilt your empty cup to him.  He wants, desperately, to fill up your cup.  In fact, he wants to be a huge part of your life.  He just needs your heartfelt, humble invitation.
 
CHOOSING LOVE, NO MATTER WHAT

I was walking back to my hotel during a business trip to Washington D.C.  I saw a homeless man sitting against a wall.  I felt God pull me over to him.  I sat down, we talked, and this homeless man changed my life.

I asked him where he would spend the night.  He told me hoped to find a bench on 17th Street where there would be enough other homeless people that they could band together, fend off harassers, and feel safe.

He went on to tell me that he was “a normal guy” like me.  He had held a good job until something had happened that he did not describe.  “I have bouts with mental issues.  I’d like to be normal again.”

As sad as his words made me feel, I could not help noticing that he spoke with such peace.  No rancor, bitterness, or anger—or even resignation.  Just a wistful peace.  He desired better, and I felt the glow of that desire when he smiled and laughed.  I felt his love.  Before we parted, we prayed, and he asked to be lifted up by Jesus.

As I left him I marveled, and it hit me when I reached my hotel.  This man had nothing!  Nothing, that is, but the love of Jesus (and the price of a meal from me).  But that was enough.  Jesus’ love sustained him and filled him with peace.

That’s when I felt the strongest call to write this book – to convey that message to those of us who have so much more:  A man stripped to nothing still has love, if he so chooses.  

We human beings, in our continuous quest for perfection, have so overcomplicated that simple fact.  God didn’t make us to be perfect.  He made us to love him and to love others.  In trying too hard to be what we cannot be, we fail to let him pour his love on us, and we fail to pour his love on others.  

What a waste!  With all that we have, all that we’ve been given, and all that we’ve achieved, how many of us have the peace of the homeless man who only had God’s love?

KEEPING IT FRESH AND PURE

Okay, so you have tilted to the left and God has filled your cup.  What an awesome feeling.  Cherish it.  Feel his love overwhelm you.  You’re set now.

Simple, right?  Of course not.  Let me get to my story in a minute, and while it’s not your story, or anybody else’s on the planet, there are bound to be enough similarities to make my point here – my point being that keeping it fresh and pure is not easy.  (It’s not supposed to be easy, but we’ll get to that later.)

We all came into this world, exactly the same as in “made in His image”, but then not so much.  We get born, then our cup starts filling up with stuff.  How we are hard-wired.  How our parents raised us.  The choices we make year after year after year.  Our earthly wins and our earthly failures.  All the stuff of life.  We become what we become, we are what we are, it is what it is.  Your cup gets full of whatever you fill it with.  Some good, some bad.  Maybe it’s working for you just fine.  Maybe it’s not.  But at some point, for most of us, “something happens.”

In my case, my “something” came out of left field.  I really never saw it coming.  Here’s my story.  (Andy’s story here – raised one way, wired a certain way, success in sports, what filled my cup was a W on the scoreboard, had some career success, success should equal happiness, right? Got hit by a 2x4, anxiety/depression, and the rest is history… 

So that’s my story…  (Andy, I’m sure this will need to be re-written after I hear a little more about your story, so what follows here is just to move the narrative forward and make a transition…)  Until that moment, I had never fully got it.  I had never fully understood that the only way to truly open up your life and allow God to pour in is to make yourself available to him at all times.  What I mean by this is that by every morning asking him to do his will through you, and to wear you out for his use.  He will mold you into a vessel of worth for his kingdom.  ……more on this

Not that it was so all fired easy.  Not that it’s easy now.  I’ll be honest.  There were times when I thought, “If this is His way – if this so right – if I’m so sure that this is the path I need to follow, shouldn’t it be a little easier?”  Like when you’re lost on the highway, and you finally get turned around and know you’re going in the right direction, you relax and just drive, don’t you?  

Well that wasn’t happening here.  I still had to….  (Andy, I’m thinking that when we keep saying it’s not easy, we should be specific about the kind of hard it is… at least specific examples.)  I would still find myself slipping back into striving for X, and judging Y, and using the language of _______ instead of the language of love.  I would still find myself looking at other people as ________ and not as precious examples of blessed chances to ____________.

(Is this the place to talk about Andy and Martin, a little club of two, everything black and white, and then starting to think, maybe it’s not so cut and dried?)

Yes, the simple image of the Three Red Cups couldn’t be simpler.  Tilt to the left for God’s love.  Tilt to the right to share it.  Flying is simple.  Shape a wing to deflect airflow and generate more lift than gravity.  Simple, but not easy.  Flying takes rigorous engineering and still is hard and dangerous.

Living the Three Red Cups life isn’t supposed to be easy.  Ever since Eden, freedom from earthly pain has not been an option.  Nobody gets a pass on suffering.  But that’s not the only reason.  It’s not supposed to be easy because that is not how we grow in wisdom.  We grow by enduring tough times that challenge how we think and how we act.  We grow when we change, and we change when we must.

All my striving for success – no, make that all my actual success – shielded me not at all from pain and anxiety.  No matter how hard I battled against them, I only made them stronger.  My only option (and believe me, I tried a lot of other more options that I thought were more “respectable” – that showed me in better light, that didn’t take humility) – my only option was to stop trying to beat back my troubles and instead just offer them to God.  Not just once – not just the day I finally broke and said, “All yours, God – here they come.”  Not just every morning when I recommit (that’s too easy – nothing’s gone wrong at 5:00 a.m. I’ve had no encounters at all, let along ones that try me).  But all day long, every time.  Every time a trouble arises.  Every time I make a mistake.  Every time someone else does what others do….

Every time, God takes my troubles happily.  Every time, he sends a clear stream of love to me.  And every time I am reminded that for me to keep that stream flowing pure and clear, I needed to create my own stream….  All day, every day.
 
Part III – When Your Cup Is Full


Okay, so you have turned it all over to him, and he has filled your cup with pure love.  You are halfway there.  “Love Me.”  You’re doing it.   “Love one another as I love you.”  To keep returning to him and letting his love to wash over you, you must pour yours on to others.  Family, friends, colleagues – all those made, like you, in His image and likeness.  

Love resting still in your own cup is love denied to others.  Like a pristine lake, once fed by one stream and feeding another but now closed off and still, love stagnates if not shared.  When you stream God’s love to you on to others, you are keeping it fresh and pure.  You are emptying your cup in order to fill it again


POURING IT OUT UNJUDGINGLY

(Is this where we should talk about The Five People You Meet in Heaven – mentioning how it’s possible to make such a powerful difference in someone else’s life and not even realize it – by way of pointing out how crucial and huge and unrelenting is our responsibility to keep the flow pure and pour it out all the time on all…. 

Remember the picture of the Three Red Cups?  That’s your cup in the middle – God fills your cup from the left, you pass it on to others on the right.  Sounds like this is all centered on you, doesn’t it?  But I’m afraid that’s mistaken; this is not about you.  It’s about our ability to serve as a direct connection between God’s love for us and the people around us.

And you know, most of us try to do that in many ways.  There are all kinds of societal norms that cause us to be thoughtful, charitable, and generous.  From basic codes of etiquette, to laws of private property, to the Golden Rule, to simply staying in your driving lane, in so many ways are we guided to be good to one another.  You give to charity.  You say something nice to the cashier.  You cover for an overworked colleague.  You go to the funeral.  You say please and thanks and do your best to treat others as you wish to be treated.

Fine.  But still, isn’t most of our striving about self-interest?  Aren’t most of our worries about making sure that bad things don’t happen to us?  When I’ve been smote one way or another by life, it often feels natural to ask, Why me?  Look at all of those cars sailing by my wreck here – Why me?  Look who got the good job in the merger while I got the door – Why me?  This illness, this roof leak, this tax audit – Why me?  

Who hasn’t sat watching the local weather, praying that the advancing storms veer a little more north or a little more south or whatever it takes to spare MY neighborhood?  Why me? 

Why not me?  Why should the storm miss me?  Why should any of life’s painful events miss me?  Where’s my hall pass that let’s me skip the whole class in pain?

A close friend of my brother has cancer so bad – so invasive – that it basically ruptured inside of him.  They had to open him up and have his whole body chemo’d.  Nothing abates his pain – nothing.  He’s young yet, with young children.  Yet he is at peace.  “I don’t ask why, and I don’t ask why me,” he says.  “I just try to bear it well.”

I have a very good friend who had a distant mother and a father who left them when my friend was very young.  Like others deprived of parental love, she went into full perfection mode – constantly seeking the perfect relationship, the perfect job, perfect friends.  A truly good person, she is never comforted because she is never perfect.  It doesn’t take much of a setback in any area of her life to bring her to bitterness or self-pity.  I’ve told her about my relationship with Jesus, and she teases me – calls me Moses sometimes.  

One day when she was at the “why me” point in almost every facet of her life, I suddenly asked her, “Why NOT you?  Who or what ever made you think that you would have a perfect life?  Why shouldn’t woes come to you?  There was only one human who was perfect, and look what pain he went through?”  

I went on to describe my faith to her.  It’s not about the cessation of pain – it’s about turning it over to him.  Give him the steering wheel, slide over to the passenger seat, and see, for a change, how things look from there.  Quit trying to keep pain and trouble at bay.  Quit measuring your life on such harsh measures.  When you make mistakes, when trouble finds you, when you feel pain, hand them over to him, and continue on in peace and love.  

It was like a wall tumbled down for her – or like she let go of something that gave her She is a changed person – not in ways that I can’t tell you enough what has happened in her life.  Not the humanly ‘visible’ stuff, but the peace and love she has.  It’s almost like a wall came tumbling down that day.  To this day she is in a better place…all by giving it all to him.)

In our self-centeredness we not only seek to escape pain, but we also find ourselves passing judgments.  How often do you find yourself sitting there observing something about someone when you could just as easily be looking in the mirror, observing the same thing about yourself?  A colleague’s excessive ambition, perhaps.  A church member’s controlling ways.  Your child’s insistence of having her own way.  Another driver’s aggression.  I’m embarrassed how often I find myself doing that – studying the sawdust in someone else’s eye, oblivious to the plank in my own.

Or I catch myself playing a little game of sin ranking.  Okay, I maybe I have committed this or that sin – but I don’t do what he does!  My sin is minor and harmless, but his – now that’s way up on the sin scale – I’d put it top five, while mine is down in the teens.  I could do mine twice more and still not be as bad as he.  In fact I think I will – but he had better change his ways.  

And so we excuse ourselves blithely, judge others by our own flawed measure, and come out on top.  Imagine that!

So we are neither all bad nor all good.  We do many good things toward other people, but we also value ourselves just a little bit more than we value all those others out there.  That’s why tilting your Red Cup to the right can be tough.  We have to forget about what makes us comfortable or proud or satisfied or admired and give it all away again.  

That’s right – sounds a little crazy, but that’s right.  First you give away all your problems, and now you give away all that makes you happy.  That’s what keeps the stream flowing.  That’s how you will fill your cup again and again – by freely emptying it to the right – by pouring your love on others.

You are indeed in the middle, but it’s never just about you.

When I talk about this to others, I’m often asked, “But, Andy, what do you really mean when you say ‘pour your love out on others’?  Is there something specific you have in mind?  If we do it, will we know it?”

I’m going to disappoint you here, if you’re looking for a specific answer, but my answer is big and general:  Figure it out for yourself, because I only know what I mean for me.  

But here’s one way I’d approach it.  Looking back on your day today, enumerate the opportunities you had to show someone that you loved them and that God loved them.  How many did you seize?  If you’re like most of us, most of those moments sped by unnoticed while you went about your ordinary business.  No, you didn’t bite anybody’s head off, or kick the dog, or raid the petty cash drawer.  But did you give people a chance to see God’s love in you pouring out on them.  Did you do it as often as you could, or just with the people who are really special to you?

I don’t know what day you’re reading this, but I guarantee I didn’t do all those things today, either.  I’m getting better at noticing all the opportunities that come my way every day, and I’m getting better at honoring them, but again, it’s not supposed to be easy, and it is not easy.  Tilting your cup to the left brings many blessings, but cessation of temptation is not one of them.  I’m still as prone to pride as I ever was.  I’m still tempted to value my time more than it’s worth – to stick to my agenda when others’ needs loom in its way.

That’s why we get to make a fresh start at it every day.  “Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.”  

But back to the question, what does pouring it out mean?  Here’s what my son does to pour out God’s love on others.  I only found this out because his teacher told me, and I about lost it when she said, “Your son makes a point of playing with kids who don’t seem to have friends.”  I never asked him to do that.  Neither did his mother.  But that’s what he does, and his teacher noticed and told me.  I don’t know when I’ve ever heard something that made me happier.  He doesn’t know, and I’m not going to tell him, but that’s going to get him off scott-free from a lot of trouble he hasn’t even caused yet.  He’s going to come home with a dent in the car, scared to show it to me, and he’s going to wonder later, “Is the old man getting soft?  He’s not even mad!”  And I’ll be dwelling on those magic words, “Your son makes a point of playing with kids who don’t seem to have friends.”

Here’s what pouring it out doesn’t mean.  It doesn’t mean turning in your resignation and heading for the monastery.  Life as we know it should go on.  I’m in the potato chip business, and potato chips still need to get sold.  Busses need to get driven.  Books need to get written.  He designed a world to need potato chips makers, bus drivers, writers – so he made them.  If that’s what you do, be good at it.  He has a plan for it all.

But through it all – maybe I’m coming up with some answers to the question after – through it all, take the focus off yourself.  Like my “why me” friend, forget about you.  Your life is not yours to order and control.  You are part of his plan – a precious part but not the plan.  You are just the vessel for carrying God’s love to others.  It’s a smooth, constant flow.  Like the perfect tennis serve, no hitches and halts or jerks and jolts – just a sweet, continuous motion, gathering strength as it flows effortlessly, that delivers power beyond belief.

Dan Merchant describes an extraordinary example of “pouring it out” in Lord, Save Us from Your Followers.  He writes about Bridgetown Ministries in Portland gathers volunteer to help the homeless a group of Christians in all kinds of practically ways and then also wash the feet of the homeless.  Remind you of anybody?  What could be more Christ-like?

But most of our opportunities to pour it out are more mundane, taking place right under our noses many times a day, day in and day out.   Just the tone of your voice when you talk to children or subordinates or people who serve you.  The look on your face when you go through a trying day.  The opportunities you take to extend an unexpected mercy.  Just the choice you make to spend a little more time with someone.  Be quick to apologize even when the other guy is wrong, too.  Drive a little more politely.  Befriend somebody.  Keep your word.  Volunterr for   

Especially, I have learned, don’t underestimate the power of surprise.  When people do not feel deserving of God’s love, they don’t expect his follower to be pouring it out on them.  When it happens anyway, it’s doubly powerful.

In his Oscar-winning performance in Horton Foote’s Tender Mercies, Robert Duvall’s character Mac Sledge, says – almost grieves – to his wife, desperate to understand why he has been so blessed, “I don’t know why you took me in when I was drunk and destitute.  I don’t know why you took pity and me and let me stay here with you and little Sonny.  I don’t know why you did that.  But somehow you saw fit to do that, and now…Andy, I need to find those words exactly – they are very moving in how they express the power of tender mercies… ”  

But here’s what’s magic.  When you do it – when you pour out your cup to the right – you are not depleted of love, you are filled again.  An endless, pure stream of love.

 
Andy, this is as far as I got on this draft.  What follows is pretty much still the way you sent it to me.

WHAT AN AWESOME GOD; IT’S NOT EASY

When we started the journey of the flow of love we have talked a lot about the purity and beauty of that love and I hope that you get that this way of living here on earth when brough to its simplest forms is one of motion.  Of getting and giving love where you turn into a vessel or a deliverer.  This motion is truly beautiful.  What an Awesome God to take a very complex human being with ego, emotions, worry’s, anxiety’s and other stuff and to simplify what it is he intended when Jesus walked the earth 2000+ years ago.  The two greatest things we can do on earth is to Love Him and Love Others….thats it.  So why is it so hard….its hard because anything, I repeat anything that is worth anything is never, ever easy.  Like I’ve said early in this story…it wasn’t meant to be easy.  If it was easy and pain free then we wouldn’t have heaven…this would be heaven.  We have been dealt, as humans, a life of choice.  Choices everyday with a force against us that is scary powerful.  This ‘force’ wants us to feel all of the emotional issues that we are faced has humans so we can ‘get out of the flow’ of Gods Love.  Anything that disrupts the flow of his love puts us in a place to be out of his will and calling for each of us and into believeing that the day to day challenges of life are what its all about.  Our society is powerful in that it is set up for us to have to ‘fight’ the flow.  This fight becomes personal and when it becomes ‘personal’ then we, as humans start bowing our chests out and being fighting…and clawing….and trying as hard as we can to win.  And then when we get up to look at the scoreboard of life we hopefully see a score in our favor.  By getting into the flow of love by accepting that you are worthy of his love and pouring that love on others you eliminate the fight.  You literally rip the scoreboard down that shows wins and losses and enter into a continous feeling of peace and joy.  Its not about earthly wins friends…or fighting.  In fact the simplicity of this love  model enables you to exit those feelings and watch the world from a place that is like your most peaceful of moments…continuously.  He is Awesome. He is Incredible…He wants everything for us…as long as we don’t make this life about US.  It will not be easy and you will be challenged every day, every moment of your life to exit this flow.  There will never be a moment that you ‘got it’.  Its like when great athletes  experience  being in the ‘moment’ and that there success was indescribable.. a feeling that they couldn’t explain.  Theres also nights that they just flat stink.  What will happen living the Red Cup way is that you will experience more and more meaning in your life and your will realize that tommorow is not guranteed and yesterday is over and move quickly back into the ‘flow’.  Lets know look at how a practical day in the life would look and feel like…

Chapter 9: 	 A day in the life; speed bump on our way to heaven

(What follows in italics is what you sent me much earlier, Andy – for this chapter.  It’s great stuff, but needs to be tightly written, so I think I won’t tackle it until we improve on the previous 4-5 chapters.)  

Let’s get practical and even drive the simplicity message to its core…Here’s a day in the life of living the Red Cup Way-not that I do it everyday, however I try…

Wake up and thank God for that day and just close your eyes and say “God, yesterday is over and tomorrow is not guaranteed so wear me out today for your Glory.  I am all yours today God…wear me out.  That will set the tone and open up the flow of Love and just sit  or lie with ‘him’ for as long as you can and keep saying those couple of sentences.  I then head to work and sometime I’ll fire out a ‘bullet’ prayer (that’s a quick one liner ☺) about what’s going on that day.  Once I’m at work I get a daily scripture paragraph with a written paragraph explaining he scripture and say another ‘bullet’ prayer of ‘what are you trying to teach me today Lord’ .  

Throughout the day I will try real hard to pray before every big decision.   So in essence I try to ‘hang’ with him most part of the day and on Sundays I really try and get filled up while also filling him up by praising and singing to him.  I believe its all about ‘spending’ timse with him by receiving him and giving it all to him in every conversation.  There are times when I really, really believe he is talking to me…when I am alone and spending time with him and we hit on a huge connection I get a huge shudder down my back that I AM SURE IT’S HIM.  

So that’s the ‘tilt left’ portion of the day.  I would recommend anything that can get you ‘with him’.  Bible School, Small Groups, etc., etc…but I wouldn’t do those if it’s to check a box.  We have too many ‘box checkers’ and there isn’t enough time spent with Him one-one and I’m not talking about a full 60 minutes day and night.  I’m talking about making him they part of everything you do…just hang with him, chat with him, give it all to him, shoot him your sins and move the heck on!

We have multiple times in a given day when we interact with people and while we are interacting with people there are hundreds of people in a given day that see you interact with those people!!!  So, we have hundreds upon hundreds of chances to ‘pour love’ on others.  Here’s what I try to do…EVERY human conncection I make I stare into the eye’s of the individual and acknowledge them, listen to them and leave them with something that will make there day better.  What do I mean;

Acknowledge them-  no human being wakes up and says I want to have a crappy day today and not try at all.  No one wants to be miserable.   By acknowledging them as human beings you are saying ‘I’m open to you and am ready to listen to what you have to say.  By acknowledging others with eye contact or a ‘hello’ you are opening there cup up and showing those around you what it looks and feels like to pour love on others.  After 
You acknowledge them ask them a question or just ‘listen’ to them…and really listen.  I heard something recently that we can learn something from everyone we come into contact with…pretty amazing huh.  Lastly, leave them feeling better about themselves, the critical word is themselves then they did prior to your interaction with them.  So you acknowledged them by name, you listened to there words and leave them with something special that you found about them…and that’s the strangers you interact with.  Tell me what your kids, spouse, significant other, our anyone that is influenced by you will think and learn from one little interaction with a stranger.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|How do viruses and other threats affect mobile devices?}}

In the corporate world’s quest to grant employees greater mobility and freedom, while increasing productivity, mobile devices have become the technological solution. Within businesses, technology not only plays a supportive role, but is also a necessity for business growth. Recently, the development of wireless mobile communication helps businesses to reach new clients and establish new mobile bases (8). The exponential growth of mobile phones and their application in the business setting is mainly due to the rapid technological revolution that has taken place in the past decade from simple cell phones to smart phones with capabilities matching computers. The first quarter of 2008 alone showed an 11.6% growth in the mobile phone industry (1). Mobile phones provide flexibility and convenience, along with increased productivity and efficiency. However, these benefits have come at the cost of a rise in cyber crimes. Hackers are attracted to popular technology as it allows them to victimize large networks, in a shorter period.

==Malware==
Today’s mobile phones, if not secured properly, are a gateway to sensitive information. “Mobile malware” is a relatively new anomaly; the first mobile device virus, the Cabir virus, was released in June 2004 (4). Although mobile malware has been somewhat unsuccessful, it is still in its early stages. Many experts note that attacks will become more frequent and malignant following a PC based trend as smart phones become mainstream (5).  The virulent capabilities of mobile malware were displayed in a recent (February 2008) Trojan called WinCE/InfoJack that was packed into regular files (e.g.: Google maps). Once the Trojan downloads, it disables all other security measures on the device and sends information from the device to a database (7).  In general, the widespread use of mobile devices in both business and private settings makes it a valuable target because it has the potential to cause severe damage relatively quickly. A recent study by McAfee, a provider of IT security solutions, noted that 83% of 200 mobile operators surveyed worldwide said that viruses had previously infected their networks (3). Clearly, cybercriminals are willing to directly attack service providers in order to access mobile devices. 

==Theft of Information==
Mobile devices may compromise the security of a corporation, particularly due to the various pathways they provide cybercriminals to intrude. Firstly, mobile devices are at risk of being easily misplaced, stolen, or carelessly disposed. For example, a former VP of Morgan Stanley sold his personal blackberry that he used for his work on eBay for about $15. However, he did not realize that it contained a sea of information on clients as well as phone numbers of top executives. Often even resetting a device to factory settings does not erase all information on it, as it may retain binary data, which is retrievable by experienced hackers. 

==Lax Security==
Mobile devices have created a predicament for the IT department, as there are no boundaries defining the use of a mobile device between personal and business use. Often employees use personal smart phones for company use and vice versa. Since most of the devices do not usually come equipped with antivirus and anti-spam software, the devices are at a risk of being exposed to viruses swarming the web when employees access personal email and browse the internet (3). Mobile devices often connect to various networks outside the protected corporate network, thus increasing the likelihood of information being intercepted and the subsequent infection (5). Once the mobile device is infected, the whole company network is compromised because the employee is authorized to access the intranet (private network protected with firewall), thereby providing a pathway for the virus.  
	
Viruses can be transmitted by various means as shown in Fig 1; amongst these means is the Bluetooth channel. Most, if not all smart phones are equipped with Bluetooth technology, which allows for data transmission to other Bluetooth enabled devices within 10-20 meters (4). Therefore, Bluetooth not only allows for transmission of malware but also gives rise to the opportunity of intercepting confidential information (5). Moreover, other viruses known as mobile messaging malware have used Short Message Service (SMS) or Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) technologies to spread. Once a device is infected viruses can automatically transfect by sending SMS or MMS to contacts. For example, the Mabir virus, which affects Symbian OS 7.0s, sends itself to other devices via MMS (5). In the business world, this may result in a tarnished reputation amongst business associates.

==Steps to Secure==
The innovation of mobile devices has had both a positive and negative impact. Although, they increase productivity and efficiency, they create a major liability if businesses do not handle them cautiously. Any compromise to sensitive data is of significant cost to an institute in terms of “legal liabilities, brand damage, diminished customer confidence, and financial loss” (5). Therefore, it is of utmost importance for businesses to protect themselves. The first step is to insure that all mobile devices have some sort of authentication such as a password that is locked in with a “data wipe” feature (6). Second, sensitive data encryption will provide protection during data transmission (5). Thirdly, businesses can implement other “on device security” such as antivirus and anti-spam softwares. Finally, businesses can better protect themselves by providing user training on how to use open networks and regulating what type of information is stored on mobile devices (5). 

==Conclusion==
Businesses need to strike a balance between retaining the increased productivity and efficiency of mobile devices and protecting important data (5). Although, malware for mobile devices has not become a major problem yet, it is highly likely that it will follow an example set by the malware evolution on PCs, an initial testing phase in the early 1990s followed by upscale attacks. Cybercriminals are working relentlessly to disrupt businesses via mobile devices. Published proof-of-concept malware, which is malware that expert programmers write to show vulnerabilities in devices, have resulted in multiple offspring variants, as criminals have modified the published codes to make them “better” (5). Therefore, businesses should realize that mobile devices do not come without an antagonistic side. They are prone to virus and security threats and therefore an IT security solution must be in place to adequately deal with such occurrences.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What is &quot;essential syntax&quot;? ==

One of the pages in this book is called &quot;[[F Sharp Programming/Essential Syntax]]&quot;. I'm not sure what &quot;essential syntax&quot; is supposed to refer to. Having looked at the history of the page, it doesn't appear to have changed much at all since 2006, and I really doubt that its going to develop into anything soon. I don't think that page adds anything to this book, and I would personally recommend the &quot;essential syntax&quot; page for deletion. [[User:Awesome Princess|Awesome Princess]] ([[User talk:Awesome Princess|talk]]) 23:40, 22 November 2008 (UTC)

== Split &quot;Arrays and Sequences&quot; into two separate articles ==

There was a link on the front page of this book called &quot;Arrays and Sequences&quot;, where the page contained data describing both F# arrays and sequence expressions. Originally, I thought the two data structures were similar enough to justify lumping them in the same article, but in retrospect they are actually very dissimilar. So, I took the time to break the article two:
# [[F Sharp Programming/Arrays]] 
# [[F Sharp Programming/Sequences]]
I think this organization makes sense and better modularizes the two distinct topics. [[User:Awesome Princess|Awesome Princess]] ([[User talk:Awesome Princess|talk]]) 08:28, 1 December 2008 (UTC)

== Missing chapter or just invalid link? ==

The F# Advanced section of the contents contains as the sixth item &quot;Quotations - Quotations convert arbitrary F# code into an abstract syntax tree.&quot;. The link leads to nowhere.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">A Producer oversees the creation of a film, from pre-production to completion.  They are responsible for making sure that the film is completed on time and within its budget. In motion pictures produced by major studios, the Producer represents the studio's interests in the film, keeping the Director in line with the studio's expectations.  The Producer may also staff key positions based on the script, helping bring the right Director and actors onto the project.
In smaller projects the Producer may also carry out the duties of a Line Producer, handling day-to-day details like budgeting, scheduling, in-depth staffing of the project and securing distribution for the film.

{{fsharpTitle|Preface}}

== How This Book Came To Be ==
: Note to contributors: normally a preface is written by the author of a book. Since this book might have several authors, feel free to write your own preface.

''Written by [[User:Awesome Princess|Awesome Princess]]'': Normally, authors choose to write a preface to a book about the book itself. But, just because I'm an egomaniac, I want to write about myself instead. Not because I'm an especially interesting person, but because my experiences with functional programming are relevant to the creation of this book.

So, in 2006, I was becoming bored with my job. The only kind of software I've ever written has been software that puts a GUI interface on top of a database, and I just became tired with it. I wanted to find an interesting programming job.

Just for fun, I started looking at job openings at different high tech companies (Google, eBay, Microsoft, Amazon, etc.). I noticed that all of the boring jobs -- CRUD apps, simple web development -- wanted programmers with Java, C#, or C++ experience. The interesting jobs -- compiler programming, digital circuit verification, massively parallel computing, biometrics -- sought programmers with experience in weird and unfamiliar languages. In particular:
* I read in Paul Graham's article [http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html Beating the Averages] that the first version of Yahoo! Store was written largely in Lisp
* I came across job postings for Google looking for programmers with Haskell or Python experience in addition to C++.
* I read in an [http://www.erlang.org/faq/faq.html Erlang FAQ] that the Erlang programming language is the tool of choice for telecommunications providers like T-Mobile.
* I've heard for years that Lisp was a niche language during the Golden Age of AI research.
* I ran across numerous Microsoft job postings in the area of driver verification looking for OCaml programmers.

The most remarkable applications in the world aren't written in Java; they're written in these weird, obscure languages. More interestingly, the languages in the highest demand -- Erlang, Haskell, Lisp, OCaml -- were all functional programming languages, a wholly alien programming paradigm from my vantage point deep in C#-Land. I decided to supplement my programming wisdom by learning one of these obscure functional programming languages.

The choice between one language or another wasn't too hard to make. If I'm going to learn a new language, it needs to satisfy a few conditions: it should be practical enough for personal use, relatively speedy, useful to employers, and impress my friends when I tell them I learned a weird new language. Haskell was quite scary to me at the time, and I can't really exploit Erlang's concurrency with the tiny scope of the apps I write for myself. The choice came down to Lisp and OCaml; based on [http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/Software/which_language.html these comparisons of different languages], I decided that OCaml's static-typing, speedy native code, tiny compiled binaries, and established niche in the financial market made it a good choice for me.

I learned OCaml and it completely changed my way of thinking. After using the language and keeping up with OCaml newsgroups, I heard about a .NET port of OCaml called F#. I figured I already knew the .NET BCL inside and out, and I was already familiar with OCaml, I could probably learn this language pretty quickly.

In August 2007, I took the time to get familiar with the F# language. While I picked up most of it fairly well, one thing I noticed about the language was how completely inaccessible it was to people trying to learn the language. The complete dearth of F# material out there just makes it impossible for beginners to learn F# as their first language. Even today, November 2008, there are only a handful of publications, but even as a person with many years of programming experience, I struggled to follow along and comprehend the language.

For a long time, I wanted to write something that would actually be useful to F# neophytes, something that would contain everything anyone needs to know about the language into a single comprehensive resource. This book was originally started by a fellow Wikibookian in 2006, but no one had written any substantial content for it for nearly 2 years. I found this book and decided that, for the sake of people wanting to learn F#, I'd compile everything I knew about the language into a format that would be acceptable for first-time programmers.

I am happy with the way the book has been progressing. Ultimately, I'd like people to link to this book as the preferred, definitive F# tutorial on Internet.

== C Sharp ==

=== Types ===

==== Value Types ====
*Variables that are based on value types directly contain values. Assigning one value type variable to another copies the contained value. This differs from the assignment of reference type variables, which copies a reference to the object but not the object itself.

*All value types are derived implicitly from the System..::.ValueType.

*Unlike with reference types, you cannot derive a new type from a value type. However, like reference types, structs can implement interfaces.

*Unlike reference types, a value type cannot contain the null value. However, the nullable types feature does allow for values types to be assigned to null. 
* All of the simple types -- those integral to the C# language -- are aliases of the .NET Framework System types. For example, int is an alias of System..::.Int32.

==== Reference Type ====
* string is a reference type
*  Variables of reference types, referred to as objects, store references to the actual data. This section introduces the following keywords used to declare reference types: class, interface, delegate. This section also introduces the following built-in reference types: object, string

===== Arrays =====
Arrays are reference types: They can be, Single Dimensional, Multi Dimensional, Jagged. Implicitly typed arrays were introduced later.

====== Jagged Arrays ======
Jagged array example: (array of multidimensional array)

&lt;code lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
int[][,] jaggedArray4 = new int[3][,] 
{
    new int[,] { {1,3}, {5,7} },
    new int[,] { {0,2}, {4,6}, {8,10} },
    new int[,] { {11,22}, {99,88}, {0,9} } 
};
&lt;/code&gt;

Example of Implicitly typed arrays with anonymous types:
&lt;code language=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
var contacts = new[] 
{
    new {
            Name = &quot; Eugene Zabokritski&quot;,
            PhoneNumbers = new[] { &quot;206-555-0108&quot;, &quot;425-555-0001&quot; }
        },
    new {
            Name = &quot; Hanying Feng&quot;,
            PhoneNumbers = new[] { &quot;650-555-0199&quot; }
        }
};
&lt;/code&gt;

==== Strings ====
;Basics
* A string is an object of type String whose value is text. Internally, the text is stored as a readonly collection of Char objects, each of which represents one Unicode character encoded in UTF-16. There is no null-terminating character at the end of a C# string (unlike C and C++); therefore a C# string can contain any number of embedded null characters ('\0'). The length of a string represents the number of characters regardless of whether the characters are formed from Unicode surrogate pairs or not.

* In C#, the string keyword is an alias for String. Therefore, String and string are equivalent, and you can use whichever naming convention you prefer. The String class provides many methods for safely creating, manipulating, and comparing strings. In addition, the C# language overloads some operators to simplify common string operations.

* String objects are immutable: they cannot be changed after they have been created. All of the String methods and C# operators that appear to modify a string actually return the results in a new string object. Ex: &lt;code&gt;str[0] = 't';&lt;/code&gt; results in the compiler error -- &lt;code&gt; Property or indexer 'string.this[int]' cannot be assigned to -- it is read only &lt;/code&gt;

* There can be ''Regular'' and ''Verbatim'' String Literals 

;&lt;code&gt;StringBuilder&lt;/code&gt;
The StringBuilder class creates a string buffer that offers better performance if your program performs many string manipulations. The StringBuilder string also enables you to reassign individual characters, something the built-in string data type does not support.

==== Anonymous Functions ====
 As described elsewhere, a delegate is a type that wraps a method call. A delegate instance can be passed between methods just like a type, and it can be invoked like a method. An anonymous function is an &quot;inline&quot; statement or expression that can be used wherever a delegate type is expected. You can use it to initialize a named delegate or pass it instead of a named delegate type as a method parameter.

There are two kinds of anonymous functions, which are discussed individually in the following topics:
* Lambda Expressions (C# Programming Guide).
* Anonymous Methods (C# Programming Guide) 

''See'':[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb882516.aspx The Evolution of Delegates in C#]
==== Structs====
* A struct type is a value type
* Structs can implement an interface but they cannot inherit from another struct. For that reason, struct members cannot be declared as protected.

*Structs share almost all the same syntax as classes, although structs are more limited than classes:
** Within a struct declaration, fields cannot be initialized unless they are declared as const or static.
** A struct may not declare a default constructor —a constructor with no parameters — or a destructor. (''since they are value types?'')

* Unlike classes, structs can be instantiated without using the new operator. If you do not use new, the fields will remain unassigned and the object cannot be used until all of the fields are initialized.
*when a struct is passed to a method, a copy of the struct is passed, but when a class instance is passed, a reference is passed. The output of the following example shows that only the value of the class field is changed when the class instance is passed to the ClassTaker method. The struct field, however, does not change by passing its instance to the StructTaker method. This is because a copy of the struct is passed to the StructTaker method, while a reference to the class is passed to the ClassTaker method.

==== Enums ====
* Value types
* Two types, simple and flags. To make the enum values as flags, use the [Flags] attribute.

=== readonly and const ===
The readonly keyword is different from the const keyword. A const field can only be initialized at the declaration of the field. A readonly field can be initialized either at the declaration or in a constructor. Therefore, readonly fields can have different values depending on the constructor used. Also, while a const field is a compile-time constant, the readonly field can be used for runtime constants

=== Operators ===
* In C#, there are two different kinds of equality: reference equality and value equality. 
* To check for reference equality, use &lt;code&gt;ReferenceEquals&lt;/code&gt;. To check for value equality, use &lt;code&gt;Equals&lt;/code&gt;.
* By default, the operator == tests for reference equality by determining if two references indicate the same object, so reference types do not need to implement operator == in order to gain this functionality. When a type is immutable, meaning the data contained in the instance cannot be changed, overloading operator == to compare value equality instead of reference equality can be useful because, as immutable objects, they can be considered the same as long as they have the same value. Overriding operator == in non-immutable types is not recommended. 
* Overloaded operator == implementations should not throw exceptions. Any type that overloads operator == should also overload operator !=. For example:

* The comparison operators, if overloaded, must be overloaded in pairs; that is, if == is overloaded, != must also be overloaded. The reverse is also true, and similar for &lt; and &gt;, and for &lt;= and &gt;=.

* Operator [] cannot be overloaded, uses indexers instead.

=== Interface ===
* Interfaces can contain events, indexers, methods and properties.

* ''Explicit Interface Implementation'':If a class implements two interfaces that contain a member with the same signature, then implementing that member on the class will cause both interfaces to use that member as their implementation. If the two interface members do not perform the same function, however, this can lead to an incorrect implementation of one or both of the interfaces. It is possible to implement an interface member explicitly—creating a class member that is only called through the interface, and is specific to that interface. This is accomplished by naming the class member with the name of the interface and a period.

* Example of Indexers in an interface:
&lt;code&gt;
public interface ISomeInterface
{
    //...

    // Indexer declaration:
    string this[int index]
    {
        get;
        set;
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;

=== Polymorphism -- new and override ===
*When a derived class inherits from a base class, it gains all the methods, fields, properties and events of the base class. To change the data and behavior of a base class, you have two choices: you can replace the base member with a new derived member, or you can override a virtual base member.

*Replacing a member of a base class with a new derived member requires the new keyword. If a base class defines a method, field, or property, the new keyword is used to create a new definition of that method, field, or property on a derived class. The new keyword is placed before the return type of a class member that is being replaced. When the new keyword is used, the new class members are called instead of the base class members that have been replaced. Those base class members are called hidden members. Hidden class members can still be called if an instance of the derived class is cast to an instance of the base class.

*In order for an instance of a derived class to completely take over a class member from a base class, the base class has to declare that member as virtual. This is accomplished by adding the virtual keyword before the return type of the member. A derived class then has the option of using the override keyword, instead of new, to replace the base class implementation with its own. 

* fields cannot be used with virtual / override qualifier, but can be used with new keyword. Fields cannot be virtual; only methods, properties, events and indexers can be virtual. When a derived class overrides a virtual member, that member is called even when an instance of that class is being accessed as an instance of the base class.

* A derived class can stop virtual inheritance by declaring an override as sealed. This requires putting the sealed keyword before the override keyword in the class member declaration. Sealed methods can be replaced by derived classes using the new keyword.[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms173152(VS.80).aspx]

*Note : to use the &lt;code&gt;override&lt;/code&gt; keyword, the function must be declared as &lt;code&gt;virtual&lt;/code&gt;. Absence of &lt;code&gt;override&lt;/code&gt; , &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt; keyword, defaults to &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt; and compiler throws a warning.

*By default, C# methods are not virtual — if a method is declared as virtual, any class inheriting the method can implement its own version. To make a method virtual, the virtual modifier is used in the method declaration of the base class. The derived class can then override the base virtual method by using the override keyword or hide the virtual method in the base class by using the new keyword. If neither the override keyword nor the new keyword is specified, the compiler will issue a warning and the method in the derived class will hide the method in the base class.[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/6fawty39(VS.80).aspx#]

=== Events and Delegates ===
* Events are a special kind of multicast delegate that can only be invoked from within the class or struct where they are declared (the publisher class). If other classes or structs subscribe to the event, their event handler methods will be called when the publisher class raises the event.

* If the delegate uses reference parameters, the reference is passed sequentially to each of the three methods in turn, and any changes by one method are visible to the next method. When any of the methods throws an exception that is not caught within the method, that exception is passed to the caller of the delegate and no subsequent methods in the invocation list are called. If the delegate has a return value and/or out parameters, it returns the return value and parameters of the last method invoked.

*  Covariance and contravariance provide a degree of flexibility when matching method signatures with delegate types. Covariance permits a method to have a more derived return type than what is defined in the delegate. Contravariance permits a method with parameter types that are less derived than in the delegate type.

* '''TODO''' - add and remove event accessors.[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ak9w5846(VS.80).aspx] If two or more interfaces supply the events with same name, then we need to explicitly handle this with add and remove event accessors.

* One use for '''accessor-declarations''' is to expose a large number of events without allocating a field for each event, but instead using a Dictionary to store the event instances. This is only useful if you have a very large number of events, but you expect most of the events will not be implemented.[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/z4ka55h8(VS.80).aspx]

=== Nullable Types ===
*Nullable types are instances of the System..::.Nullable&lt;(Of &lt;(T&gt;)&gt;) struct. A nullable type can represent the correct range of values for its underlying value type, plus an additional null value.
*The ability to assign null to numeric and Boolean types is especially useful when you are dealing with databases and other data types that contain elements that may not be assigned a value. For example, a Boolean field in a database can store the values true or false, or it may be undefined. 

*Nullable types represent value-type variables that can be assigned the value of null. You cannot create a nullable type based on a reference type. (Reference types already support the null value.)

*The syntax T? is shorthand for Nullable&lt;(Of &lt;(T&gt;)&gt;), where T is a value type. The two forms are interchangeable.

*Assign a value to a nullable type just as you would for an ordinary value type, for example int? x = 10; or double? d = 4.108. However, a nullable type can also be assigned the value null: int? x = null.

*Use the Nullable&lt;(Of &lt;(T&gt;)&gt;)..::.GetValueOrDefault method to return either the assigned value, or the default value for the underlying type if the value is null, for example int j = x.GetValueOrDefault();

*Use the HasValue and Value read-only properties to test for null and retrieve the value, for example if(x.HasValue) j = x.Value;

* Identifying a nullable type:&lt;code&gt;if (type.IsGenericType &amp;&amp; type.GetGenericTypeDefinition() == typeof(Nullable&lt;&gt;)) {…}&lt;/code&gt;[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms366789(VS.80).aspx]

=== Generic Programming ===

* Constraints on Type Parameters are possible.[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/d5x73970(VS.80).aspx]
* Inheriting from Generic classes.[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/sz6zd40f(VS.80).aspx]
* In Inheritance, there can be two types, Open type constructed, and Closed type constructed. In closed type constructed, the template parameter type is speficied.
* '''Explain''': Generic interfaces can inherit from non-generic interfaces if the generic interface is contra-variant, which means it only uses its type parameter as a return value. In the .NET Framework class library, IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; inherits from IEnumerable because IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; only uses T in the return value of GetEnumerator and in the Current property getter.
* Difference with C++ template: C++ allows code that might not be valid for all type parameters in the template, which is then checked for the specific type used as the type parameter. C# requires code in a class to be written in such a way that it will work with any type that satisfies the constraints. For example, in C++ it is possible to write a function that uses the arithmetic operators + and - on objects of the type parameter, which will produce an error at the time of instantiation of the template with a type that does not support these operators. C# disallows this; the only language constructs allowed are those that can be deduced from the constraints.[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/c6cyy67b(VS.80).aspx]


==== &lt;code&gt;default&lt;/code&gt; keyword ====

In generic classes and methods, one issue that arises is how to assign a default value to a parameterized type T when you do not know the following in advance:

    * Whether T will be a reference type or a value type.
    * If T is a value type, whether it will be a numeric value or a struct.

Given a variable t of a parameterized type T, the statement t = null is only valid if T is a reference type and t = 0 will only work for numeric value types but not for structs. The solution is to use the default keyword, which will return null for reference types and zero for numeric value types. For structs, it will return each member of the struct initialized to zero or null depending on whether they are value or reference types.

=== Iterators ===
:''Overview''--[http://books.google.com/books?id=JZmbD7yeNMMC&amp;pg=PA237&amp;dq=C%23+iterators#PPA237,M1 Pro C# with .NET 3.0]
* Iterators are a new feature in C# 2.0. An iterator is a method, get accessor or operator that enables you to support foreach iteration in a class or struct without having to implement the entire IEnumerable interface. Instead, you provide just an iterator, which simply traverses the data structures in your class. When the compiler detects your iterator, it will automatically generate the Current, MoveNext and Dispose methods of the IEnumerable or IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; interface. 

* An iterator is a section of code that returns an ordered sequence of values of the same type.
* An iterator can be used as the body of a method, an operator, or a get accessor.
* The iterator code uses the yield return statement to return each element in turn. yield break ends the iteration. For more information, see yield.
* Multiple iterators can be implemented on a class. Each iterator must have a unique name just like any class member, and can be invoked by client code in a foreach statement as follows: foreach(int x in SampleClass.Iterator2){}
* The return type of an iterator must be IEnumerable, IEnumerator, IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;, or IEnumerator&lt;T&gt;.
* It is also possible to use '''named iterators''' to support different ways of iterating through the same collection of data. For example, you could provide one iterator which returns elements in ascending order, and one which returns elements in descending order. An iterator can also have parameters to enable clients to control all or part of the iteration behavior.[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/65zzykke(VS.80).aspx]

=== Lambda ===
:''Overview:[http://books.google.com/books?id=VGT1_UJzjM0C&amp;pg=PA374&amp;dq=C%23+troelsen+lambda#PPA376,M1 Pro C# 2008 Troelsen]''
* All lambda expressions use the lambda operator =&gt;, which is read as &quot;goes to&quot;. The left side of the lambda operator specifies the input parameters (if any) and the right side holds the expression or statement block. The lambda expression x =&gt; x * x is read &quot;x goes to x times x.&quot; This expression can be assigned to a delegate type.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb397687.aspx | title = Lambda Expressions (C# Programming Guide) | publisher = msdn }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''lambda''s are a concise way to express ''anonymous methods''.&lt;ref&gt;''C# 3.5'', p.374&lt;/ref&gt;
* They can refer outer variables.&lt;ref name=&quot;lambda_nut&quot;&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=_Y0rWd-Q2xkC&amp;pg=PA118&amp;dq=C%23+lambda#PPA120,M1 C# 3.0 in a Nutshell]&lt;/ref&gt; Also if no args are required, then ''lambda'' expression can be written as, &lt;code&gt;() =&gt; i++&lt;/code&gt;
* Outer variables are ''captured'', that is their lifetime is extended.&lt;ref name=&quot;lambda_nut&quot;/&gt;

=== LINQ ===
*  A query is an expression that retrieves data from a data source. Queries are usually expressed in a specialized query language. Different languages have been developed over time for the various types of data sources, for example SQL for relational databases and XQuery for XML. ''Therefore, developers have had to learn a new query language for each type of data source or data format that they must support. LINQ simplifies this situation by offering a consistent model for working with data across various kinds of data sources and formats''. In a LINQ query, you are always working with objects. You use the same basic coding patterns to query and transform data in ''XML documents, SQL databases, ADO.NET Datasets, .NET collections'', and any other format for which a LINQ provider is available.&lt;ref name=&quot;linq-intro&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Introduction to LINQ Queries | url = http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb397906.aspx }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* All LINQ query operations consist of three distinct actions:&lt;ref name=&quot;linq-intro&quot;/&gt;
** Obtain the data source.
** Create the query.
** Execute the query. 

* Types that support IEnumerable&lt;(Of &lt;(T&gt;)&gt;) or a derived interface such as the generic IQueryable&lt;(Of &lt;(T&gt;)&gt;) are called queryable types.&lt;ref name=&quot;linq-intro&quot;/&gt;

* The query expression contains three clauses: '''from''', '''where''' and '''select'''. (If you are familiar with SQL, you will have noticed that the ordering of the clauses is reversed from the order in SQL.) The '''from''' clause specifies the data source, the '''where''' clause applies the filter, and the '''select''' clause specifies the type of the returned elements.&lt;ref name=&quot;linq-intro&quot;/&gt;

* The query execution can be of two types: ''Deferred Execution'', ''Immediate Execution''. Queries that perform aggregation functions over a range of source elements must first iterate over those elements. Examples of such queries are Count, Max, Average, and First. These execute without an explicit foreach statement because the query itself must use foreach in order to return a result.  You can also force execution by putting the foreach loop immediately after the query expression. However, by calling ToList or ToArray you also cache all the data in a single collection object.&lt;ref name=&quot;linq-intro&quot;/&gt;

* Data Transformations with LINQ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb397914.aspx | title = Data Transformations with LINQ (C#)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The LINQ queries get internally translated to method calls, and these methods are ''extension methods'' on the IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; interface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = LINQ Query Syntax versus Method Syntax (C#) | url = http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb397947.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== C# 3.0 Features ==
:''Overview : [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb397909.aspx C# 3.0 Features That Support LINQ]''

== Unsafe ==
:''See : [http://books.google.com/books?id=_Y0rWd-Q2xkC&amp;pg=PA148&amp;dq=C%23+3.0++unsafe#PPA149,M1 C# 3.0 in a nutshell]''
* a pointer should point to a &lt;code&gt;fixed&lt;/code&gt; variable, since the Garbage collector ''may'' move the object to different location as a part of optimization and de-fragmentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = C# in a nutshell | url = [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb397909.aspx C# 3.0 Features That Support LINQ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Application domains ==
* You can run several application domains in a single process with the same level of isolation that would exist in separate processes, but without incurring the additional overhead of making cross-process calls or switching between processes. The ability to run multiple applications within a single process dramatically increases server scalability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/2bh4z9hs.aspx msdn]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Assembly and GAC ==
:''Overview : [http://books.google.com/books?id=VGT1_UJzjM0C&amp;pg=PA484&amp;dq=.NET+assembly#PPA480,M1 Pro C# 2008 and the .NET 3.5 Platform]
:''Diagram: [http://books.google.com/books?id=VGT1_UJzjM0C&amp;pg=PA484&amp;dq=.NET+assembly#PPA485,M1 Pro C# 2008 and the .NET 3.5 Platform]''

* An assembly is a fundamental building block of any .NET Framework application. For example, when you build a simple C# application, Visual Studio creates an assembly in the form of a single portable executable (PE) file, specifically an EXE or DLL.&lt;ref name=&quot;asm_gac&quot;&gt;[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms173099(VS.80).aspx Assembly and GAC]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Assemblies contain metadata that describe their own internal version number and details of all the data and object types they contain. For more information see Assembly Manifest.&lt;ref name=&quot;asm_gac&quot;/&gt;

* An assembly manifest contains all the metadata needed to specify the assembly's version requirements and security identity, and all metadata needed to define the scope of the assembly and resolve references to resources and classes. The assembly manifest can be stored in either a PE file (an .exe or .dll) with Microsoft intermediate language (MSIL) code or in a standalone PE file that contains only assembly manifest information.&lt;ref name=&quot;asm_manifest&quot;&gt;[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/1w45z383(VS.80).aspx Assembly Manifest]&lt;/ref&gt; 

* An assembly can be single filed, or multi-filed.&lt;ref name=&quot;asm_manifest&quot;/&gt;

* .NET assembly can be of two types, ''private'' and ''shared''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Programming .NET Components | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=m7E4la3JAVcC&amp;pg=PA107&amp;dq=.NET+assembly+strong+name#PPA106,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In order to share an assembly with other applications, it must be placed in the Global Assembly Cache (GAC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = How to: Share an Assembly with Other Applications  | url = http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms173102(VS.80).aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Strong Name'' of an assembly is used to uniquely identify a shared assembly and to over come the drawbacks of COM which used GUID.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Professional C# 2005 with .NET 3.0 | pages = p.500 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=oQ4KTP0nwV0C&amp;pg=PA500&amp;dq=.NET+assembly+strong+name}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Overview on ''Strong Name'', ''digital signature'' : [http://books.google.com/books?id=JZmbD7yeNMMC&amp;pg=PA371&amp;dq=.NET+assembly+troelsen+understanding+shared+assembly C# 3.5 by Troelsen]

== Attributes ==
* Attributes add metadata to your program. Metadata is information embedded in your program such as compiler instructions or descriptions of data.
* Your program can examine its own metadata using Reflection. See Accessing Attributes With Reflection.
* Attributes are commonly used when interacting with COM.
* Example usages: [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/acxa5b99(VS.80).aspx Create Unions], Common usages : [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/4xssyw96(VS.80).aspx Conditional], [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/22kk2b44(VS.80).aspx Obsolete] warnings, [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/284c1c4s(VS.80).aspx Assembly info] like title, author, company and [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/tw5zxet9(VS.80).aspx AttributeUsage].

== Expression Trees ==
*  Expression trees represent language-level code in the form of data. The data is stored in a tree-shaped structure. Each node in the expression tree represents an expression, for example a method call or a binary operation such as x &lt; y.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb397951.aspx | title = Expression Trees | publisher = msdn}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Overview : [http://books.google.com/books?id=A-vzSC3zhqMC&amp;pg=PA449&amp;dq=C%23+expression+trees&amp;ei=2SE1SbXhJpTEzASY9oysAQ#PPA449,M1 Acclerated C# 2008].

== Extension Methods ==
Using extension methods, we can add functionality to pre-compiled types while providing the illusion these methods were there all along.&lt;ref name=&quot;ext-m&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title = Pro C# with .NET 3.0 | pages = p.1080 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=JZmbD7yeNMMC&amp;pg=PA1080&amp;dq=C%23+extension+methods}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* When defining extension methods,&lt;ref name=&quot;ext-m&quot;/&gt;
** First restriction, is that they must be defined within a ''static class''.
** The second point is that all extension methods are marked as such by using the &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; keyword as a modified on the first (and only the first) parameter of the method in question.
** The extension method can be called either from the correct instance in memory or ''statically'' via the defining static class.

==mIRC Sockets==

A '''socket''' is a programming interface for the purpose of handling IP-related connections. Sockets can be very useful depending on what they are used for, and mIRC's socket handler can do quite a number of things from obtaining information or files from a website, connecting to IRC networks or working with other protocols.

__TOC__

===Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)===

The '''Transmission Control Protocol''', otherwise known as '''TCP''' or '''TCP/IP''' is an internet/networking protocol which relies on the existence of servers and clients. In this protocol, connections have to be established before they are considered open. This is done via what is known as a ''3-way handshake''. When a connection is made between a client and a server, information may be freely transferred between the two nodes.

===Servers and clients===

A ''Server'' in this context is a program or script which is responsible for accepting and managing connections, whereas a ''Client'' is a program or script which connects to a server. The most commonly noticed example of servers and clients are the web sites we browse every day. Our browser functions as a client, which connects to a server located at the address you type in, and downloads the information to the screen.

Both servers and clients can be written using mIRC's sockets

==Client scripting in mIRC:==

===Sockopen===

Format: /sockopen [-de] [bindip] &lt;name&gt; &lt;address&gt; &lt;port&gt;
Example: /sockopen Getwebpage www.comcity.com 80

This command attempts to open a connection to a server at the specified IP address or hostname and port. If no server is found running at that location/port, the connection will fail.

'''&lt;name&gt;''' is a name you supply to describe the connection. This name will be used to reference this connection in the future.
'''&lt;address&gt;''' is the IP address or hostname of the computer you wish to connect to.
'''&lt;port&gt;''' is the Port number of the service you wish to connect to on the remote machine.

The -d switch means that you specified an ip address as the bind address.
The -e switch creates an SSL connection.

====On sockopen====

Format: On *:sockopen:&lt;name&gt;:{ [commands] }
Example: On *:sockopen:Getwebpage:{ echo -s Connection to webpage successful! }

This is an event which is triggered when a socket is successfully opened with the /sockopen command.

'''&lt;name&gt;''' can be a wildcard.

===Sockclose===

Format: /sockclose &lt;name&gt;
Example: /sockclose Getwebpage

This command closes an open connection based upon its reference name. If the socket is not open, this command does nothing.

====On sockclose====

Format: On *:sockclose:&lt;name&gt;:{ [commands] }
Example: On *:sockclose:Getwebpage:{ echo -s Remote has closed the connection. }

This is an event which is triggered when a socket-based connection has been closed by the remote node. This event does not trigger when the socket is closed locally using /sockclose.

'''&lt;name&gt;''' can be a wildcard.

==Server scripting in mIRC==

===Socklisten===

Format: /socklisten [-d] [bindip] &lt;name&gt; [port]
Example: /socklisten Webserver 80

This command listens for a connection from a client node on the specified port. If a port isn't specified, one from the range in the DCC options is selected at random.

'''&lt;name&gt;''' is the reference name you would like to give this connection.
'''[port]''' is an optional parameter which sets the port that the server is to run from.

====On socklisten====

Format: On *:socklisten:&lt;name&gt;:{ [commands] }
Example: On *:socklisten:Webserver:{ sockaccept Webcon $+ $rand(1,99999) }

This is an event which is triggered when a node attempts to connect to your server on the port you are running the service on. The main goal with this event is to accept (or reject) incoming connections.

'''&lt;name&gt;''' can be a wildcard.

===Sockaccept===

Format: /sockaccept &lt;name&gt;
Example: /sockaccept Helloworld
Example 2: /sockaccept Webcon $+ $rand(1,99999)

This command accepts a connection attempt from an On socklisten event.

'''&lt;name&gt;''' is the reference name you would like to give this connection.

If accepting multiple connections, it is recommended to use a $rand() identifier to assign a random number so that more than one connection can be made at one time. This requires the use of wildcards in many of the events.

==Reading and Writing information==

===Sockwrite===

Format: /sockwrite [-tnb] &lt;name&gt; [numbytes] &lt;text|%var|&amp;binvar&gt;
Example: /sockwrite -n Getwebpage GET /websiteos/example_of_a_simple_html_page.htm HTTP/1.1
Example 2: /sockwrite Helloworld &amp;sendfile

This command sends either text-based or binary data to a remote connection.

'''&lt;name&gt;''' is the reference name of the connection you plan to send data to.
'''[numbytes]''' is an optional parameter which works in conjunction with the -b switch to indicate you are specifying the amount of bytes to send.
'''&lt;text|%var|&amp;binvar&gt;''' describes the data to be sent to the remote node.

The -t switch forces data contained in a binary variable to be interpereted as normal text rather than binary data.
The -n switch adds a Carriage return/Line feed to the end of the data ($crlf)
The -b switch indicates you are specifying the [numbytes] parameter.

====On sockwrite====

Format: on *:sockwrite:&lt;name&gt;:{ [commands] }
Example: on *:sockwrite:Helloworld:{ echo -s Done sending data to socket }

This event is triggered when mIRC has finished sending the specified data to the specified connection. In the case that more data is added before the previous data is sent, it is added to a [[data queue]].

'''&lt;name&gt;''' can be a wildcard.

===Sockread===

Format: /sockread [-fn] [numbytes] &lt;%var|&amp;binvar&gt;
Example: /sockread %chatline
Example 2: /sockread &amp;filepart

This command reads data that has been recieved over a connection. It is always run inside of an On sockread event.

'''[numbytes]''' is an optional parameter describing the number of bytes to read from a binary variable. It defaults to 4096 if not specified.
'''&lt;%var|&amp;binvar&gt;''' is a variable to contain the data read from the socket.

The -f switch forces mIRC to process data from a sockread event even if it does not end with a $crlf
The -n switch allows you to add a $crlf-terminated line into a binary variable.

====On sockread====

Format: On *:sockread:&lt;name&gt;:{ [commands] }
Example: on *:sockread:Getwebpage:{ sockread %htmllines | echo -s HTML of page: %htmllines }

This event is triggered when data is read from a socket. It almost always encapsulates a sockread command.

'''&lt;name&gt;''' can be a wildcard.</text>

'''Cael + Pronoun + VN + Pronoun'''

* Dwi'n cael fy nhalu i.

* Wyt ti'n cael dy dalu di?

* Mae e'n cael ei dalu e.

* Mae hi'n cael ei thalu hi.

* yn ni'n cael ein talu ni.

* Dych chi'n cael eich talu chi?

* Maen nhw'n cael eu talu nhw.

== Adolygu ==
* The passive voice will use the verb '''cael''' (to get, to receive). The pattern is cael + pronoun and verb-noun. Remember that certain pronouns will mutate the verb noun.
* This pattern can be used with any tense.

{{TODO|Introduce sickness vocabulary|Welsh}}

== Grammar ==
=== Beth sy'n bod? ===
This phrase means ''What's wrong?''

More examples:

- Beth sy'n bod ar John?

- Beth sy'n bod ar Mary?

So you must use the preposition '''ar''' (on) with this phrase to ask about other people. '''Beth sy'n bod ar [someone]?'''

Like the preposition '''i''' (to, for), '''ar''' has several personal forms:
* arna i (on me)
* arnat ti (on you)
* arno fe (on him)
* arni hi (on her)
* arnon ni (on us)
* arnoch chi (on you)
* arnyn nhw (on them)

In use:
* Beth sy'n bod arna i?
* Beth sy'n bod arnat ti?
* Beth sy'n bod arno fe?
* Beth sy'n bod arni hi?
* Beth sy'n bod arnon ni?
* Beth sy'n bod arnoch chi?
* Beth sy'n bod arnyn nhw?

=== Talking about illness ===

Like when talking about possession, we must use the Oes/Mae patterns for talking about illness. Oes is for questions, and Mae is for statements.

Certain illnesses use the '''gyda''' (with) pattern:

: Mae pen tost gyda fi.
: ''I have a headache''

Certain illnesses use the '''ar''' (on) pattern:

: Mae annwyd arno fe.
: ''He has a cold.''

The general rule of thumb is: if the illness mentions a body part, use '''gyda'''. If the illness does not, use '''ar'''.

&lt;small&gt;Important Notes for filling out spreadsheet:&lt;small&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;small&gt;(1)	You must indicate the Project Name and also the main Change Record in the heading of the Implementation Plan.&lt;small&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;small&gt;(2)	Please number your steps in increments of 10 to allow for the insertion of additional steps if needed during revisions.&lt;small&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;small&gt;(3)	Use the TIME column for those activities with critical execution times. It can be left blank for line items that are not time specific within a day&lt;small&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;small&gt;(4)	Please include the Change Record number or response letter for all references.&lt;small&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;small&gt;(5)	All implementation plans must have at least one reference to a 'Go - No Go' decision that would require a backout plan to be run. That plan needs to be included. &lt;small&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;small&gt;(6)	Please include contact info on the 2nd sheet for those people with tasks assigned to them. &lt;small&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;small&gt;(7)	A backout plan is required for all implementations. &lt;small&gt;&lt;p&gt;
