Hello. This page is for Project Participants to introduce themselves and tell a little about their background and interests in bartending and mixology. If you are a Participant, please [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks_talk:WikiProject_Bartending/Participants&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new add a new section] with your WikiBooks name for the topic and describe yourself and your reasons for participating in and goals to achieve through this WikiProject. Thanks!

== Willscrlt ==

Hello. I got involved with the related Wikipedia [[w:WP:MIX|Mixed Drinks WikiProject]] in late November 2006. At the time, the [[w:List of cocktails]] was in very bad shape. A few edits turned into well over a thousand edits in that article and the articles linked from that page. I quickly realized that this was too big of a job for one person, and I worked to revive the WikiProject responsible for overseeing these articles.

Along the way, I encountered the [[Bartending|WikiBooks Bartending Guide]]. I think it holds great potential, but, sadly, it seems to often just be a dumping ground for bits of rejected information from Wikipedia that had nowhere else to go. I hope that this Project can help to change that. Whether or not the Bartending Guide becomes a true text book book for student mixologists or just a great reference for enthusiast home bartenders, I think the Guide, good as it is already, can be improved. And it will help if there is plenty of open communication between Wikipedia and Wikibooks so WikiBooks can cease being Wikipedia's dumping grounds.

I have made several goofs along the way, but all with the best of intentions. :-) Fortunately there are a lot of great people both here and at Wikipedia who offer help when you need it. I have found that even when I think my way is best, there is usually a better way to do things. Therefore, I am a pretty open-minded person, even if I seem a bit hesitant at first. I have invested a lot of time and effort into improving the topics related to these WikiProjects.

This is rather ironic, considering that I rarely drink mixed drinks, alcoholic or otherwise. My knowledge on the subject has increased dramatically, but I am still far from an expert when it comes to details about the various drinks. I am a quick learner, an effective researcher, a decent copy editor, and a good organizer. These are all talents that have been put to the test since getting involved in this WikiProject.

My favorite alcoholic drinks: [[w:Mai Tai|Mai Tai]] (if a blender is available) or a [[w:Cuba Libre|Rum &amp; Coke]] if not. Favorite non-alcoholic drinks: [[w:Water|water]] and [[w:Tea|tea]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Programmable Logic Page}}

== Procedural Code ==

Verilog has a number of high-level control structures that can be used to perform complicted tasks with some level of abstraction. These control structures should be familiar to people who have experience programming in high-level computer software languages, such as C or Java.

It is important to note that not all constructs in verilog are compatible with these high-level control structures. Wires and continuous assignments are not generally compatible with these structures, and trying to combine them may either lead to compiler errors or synthesis errors.

== If-Else ==

IF structures test a particular condition, and execute the following code statement if that condition is true. Following an IF block can be an optional ELSE block, that will be executed if the condition is not true. 

IF-ELSE structures can be expanded to account for more than two possibilities by nesting. The pseudocode example below demonstrates this:

 if (&lt;condition 1&gt;)
   &lt;statement 1&gt;
 else if(&lt;condition 2&gt;)
   &lt;statement 2&gt;
 else if(&lt;condition 3&gt;)
   &lt;statement 3&gt;
 ...
 else 
   &lt;statement n&gt;

It is worth noting that additional resources will be generated to handle conditions that aren't accounted for in the IF-ELSE chain. This means that it is typically more efficient to account for all possibilities than to ignore some.

== For ==
== While ==

A WHILE loop executes repeatedly, so long as the condition is true. The condition is tested before each execution of the loop.

== Switch-Case ==

SWITCH-CASE structures are similar to nested IF-ELSE structures, except they tend to reduce to more efficient hardware structures. 

;SWITCH:
;CASE:
;CASEX:
;CASEZ:

== Code Blocks ==

Code blocks are designated through use of the keywords '''begin''' and '''end'''. Code blocks can be put anywhere that a single statement is valid, but where more than one statement needs to be executed.

Code blocks can be nested.

Variables declared in a code block are lexically scoped to that block.

=== Naming and leaving Code Blocks ===

Above described blocks of code can be named, like
  begin : somename
    &lt;statement 1&gt;
    ....
    &lt;statement n&gt;
  end
In combination with the prior described loop constructs, a superior equivalence of Verilog to the ''break'' command in C is '''disable''', which receives the name of the block to leave as an argument:
  while(1) begin : infiniteLoop
    &lt;... statements ...&gt;
    if (somecondition) disable infiniteLoop;
    &lt;... statements ...&gt;
  end
In testbeds, one may also decide to use $finish or $stop to break from an execution.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Fusion is the energy process in the Sun. Fusion means &quot;putting together&quot; to form something different. In this case it is hydrogen nuclei, which are simply protons, coming together to form a somewhat more complex helium nucleus. The specific process in the Sun is called the '''Proton-proton chain''' because it involves a series of interactions in which protons build up the helium nucleus, leaving additional leftover protons that can start the process over again, hence a &quot;chain.&quot;

This process is sometimes referred to as '''thermonuclear''' fusion. &quot;Thermo&quot; because it occurs only at very high temperatures, and &quot;nuclear&quot; because unlike everyday energy processes such as burning gasoline, it directly involves only the nuclei of atoms.

In order for positively charged protons to come together to form a helium nucleus, they must overcome their natural electrical repulsion of each other. This repulsion is known as the '''Coulomb Barrier.''' The only way this can happen is if the protons are packed tightly together and are moving very rapidly. Basically this means that they must be in a highly compressed and extremely hot gas. In fact, at such high pressures and temperatures, it is too hot and energetic for electrons to stay connected to the protons to form normal atoms. Instead, there is a mixture of free electrons and protons in a kind of particle soup. This kind of particle (rather than molecular) gas is called a '''plasma''' and is the situation in the core of the Sun. Here the protons are moving so fast that -- aided by properties of quantum physics -- they sometimes slam into each other with enough force that they overcome the Coulomb Barrier and touch. At that point, nuclear forces come into play to &quot;glue&quot; the protons together in spite of their electrical repulsion. Through a series of such events, attended by the creation of exotic particles such as the neutrino and positron, a helium nucleus with two protons and two neutrons is produced. Two additional protons are left over and can continue the chain.

Physicists have measured the mass of a helium nucleus such as is produced in the core of the Sun. It turns out that it is a little less than 4 times the mass of the 4 protons that created it. This &quot;mass deficit&quot; is partly due to the positrons and neutrinos produced in the process. But even considering that, there is still a little of the mass that is missing. That mass was converted into energy by Einstein's famous equation, E=MC^2 (&quot;Energy equals mass times the speed of light squared.&quot;). This is how the Sun produces energy.

At the Sun's core roughly 600 million tons of hydrogen (protons) is converted into about 596 million tons of helium each second. The mass deficit of about 4 or 5 million tons is converted directly into energy as per the paragraph above.

All of the Sun's energy is produced in this manner at the core of the Sun. The energy is vibrational (heat) as well as in the form of high energy gamma rays. The energy from the gamma rays slowly works its way out from the core of the Sun, changing many, many times into longer wavelength radiation. By they time it reaches the surface, it consists mostly of visible light photons.

[We should point out that because it involves only atomic nuclei, fusion is fundamentally different from any process normally encountered on Earth. Ordinary chemical reactions do not involve nuclei, but rather the electrons in the outer shells of atoms. Although the production of energy in &quot;ordinary&quot; situations do not involve the nuclei (and so do not change the elemental nature of matter), they still operate via Einstein's equation and there still is a tiny loss of mass when any energy is produced. However, it is much less than in nuclear reactions and is not normally even measurable.]

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Big Bang is a misnomer, as it implies an explosion. In fact, the model describes an expansion of the Universe, not into some pre-existing space, but rather that it created space as it expanded. There is nothing outside the Universe, so there was nothing to expand into. It's just at one time every point in the Universe was incredibly close to every other place (less than the size of an atom), and that at the moment of the Big Bang, they all started getting farther apart at a high rate. This expansion continues today, and in fact appears to be speeding up, possibly due to another force called &quot;dark energy.&quot; By current thinking, this expansion will continue forever, continually cooling.

The basic idea dates back to the 1920s and Georges Lemaitre who, basing his idea on Einstein's general theory of relativity. Soon afterwards Hubble's discovery that all distant galaxies are receding from us served as a confirmation of the basic idea of the Universe having a beginning in time and having since expanded.

By today's measurements -- using the current size and rate of expansion as we understand them -- working backwards in time leads to the conclusion that approximately 13-14 billion years ago, the Universe was compacted into the volume of less than that of an atom. By understanding how the forces of Nature work, we can trace this backwards into earlier times and higher temperatures. As we do so, the nature of the laws of Nature change, such that at 10^-43 of a second after the Big Bang (the &quot;Planck time&quot;), the laws as we know them break down. Hence, we cannot look farther back in time than that -- and in such a situation it is impossible to look to a time before the Big Bang. [Of course, we cannot rule out the possibility that those ideas may someday change.]

At and before Planck time, most astronomers and physicists think that all the forces of the Universe -- electromagnetism, the two nuclear forces and gravity -- were all merged into one force, but we do not know how that force worked. After the Planck time, gravity separated from the &quot;Grand Unified Force,&quot; the latter of which consisted of the strong nuclear force and the electroweak force. As things cooled further, the electroweak force split into electromagnetism and the weak nuclear force, and the regime we have today was born.

During the first three minutes of the expansion, energy cooled and matter in the form of hydrogen and helium &quot;froze&quot; out. After about three minutes, the expansion had cooled the Universe so much that no more elements were created (&quot;nucleogenesis&quot;). In fact, no new elements were formed for hundreds of millions of years until the first stars formed. All the hydrogen in the Universe, including that in you, and most of the helium can be traced back to the first three minutes of the Universe.

After that the Universe expanded for hundreds of millions of years before the first stars and galaxies formed in a highly energetic state (by today's standards). Since then, the stars and galaxies have evolved to what they are today.


There are three major pieces of evidence in favor of the Big Bang:

First and foremost is the expansion itself. This was discovered in the 1920s through the red shifts of distant galaxies. If all the universe is expanding today -- which is certainly what the evidence shows -- then it is reasonably easy to work the process backward in time to deduce that at earlier epochs the Universe was smaller. 

The second piece of evidence was predicted by George Gamow, who is considered by many to be the &quot;father&quot; of the Big Bang, although he was not the first to come up with the idea. In the 1940s he made the calculations that showed how elements were formed at the time of the Big Bang. Basically, he said that if the Big Bang idea was correct, then the Universe should consist of roughly 75 percent hydrogen and 25 percent helium (other elements being very small constituents). This could not be confirmed at the time, but with the advance of technology, has since been confirmed.

The third and very strong piece of evidence also was predicted by Gamow long before it could be confirmed. Basically, he said that the Big Bang would have been very hot, and as it expanded the Universe would cool off. As matter cools off it gives off certain types of radiation. It is like a hot fireplace poker cooling off and changing colors, or the embers of a fire dying and turning dark. Even though they may not give off visible light, they continue to radiate infrared radiation. Although Gamow had a wrong estimate on the age of the Universe, he said that by today it should have cooled to a certain level, and if we had the technology to detect it, we could read the radiation and effectively take the temperature of the Universe. The technology to do this became available in the 1960s, and the radiation predicted by Gamow -- properly adjusted for today's more refined value of the age of the Universe -- has been discovered. It is called the &quot;Cosmic Background Radiation,&quot; or &quot;Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation,&quot; and is often abbreviated as CBR or CMBR. The CBR is especially good evidence in favor of the Big Bang, as there is little if anything else that can adequately explain it.

Historically, the Big Bang has had problems. The three main ones are called:

* The Horizon Problem. You might call this the Mixing Problem. If we look to the edge of the observable universe in any direction, we find that everything seems the same, as if it was well mixed. But material 10 billion light years in one direction cannot mix with material that is 10 billion light years in another direction simply because the age of the Universe is too short. The material on one edge of the observable Universe is over the &quot;horizon&quot; for material at the other edge. They cannot interact. Yet everything is well mixed. How did it get that way?

* The Flatness Problem. The actual density of matter in the Universe is too close to the critical density (that density required to just stop the expansion) to be coincidental. To be as close as it is today, the Universe had to have been &quot;flat&quot; (that is, critical density and observed density exactly the same) to within something like 60 decimal places. This is amazing. How could it possibly be so close?

* The Smoothness Problem. In the original Big Bang scenario, everything is expanding away from everything else in all directions. As such, no two particles of matter would have every gotten close enough to stick together by gravity. Hence, there would be no galaxies, no stars, no planets. Yet these all exist.

About 25 years ago a physicist named Alan Guth came up with an idea now known as Cosmic Inflation. Think of water cooling off and changing into ice. It takes energy (heat) to hold water in a liquid state. When the water cools and changes to ice, it gives up this energy into the environment. This is called a &quot;symmetry breaking.&quot;  Basically, what Guth said was that in the early Universe, just a tiny fraction of a second after the Big Bang, something similar happened as it expanded and cooled. Only here the heat energy solidified into matter (via E=mc^2). The energy released in this symmetry breaking caused the expansion to suddenly speed up for a very short while, much greater than the Big Bang alone.  This super expansion (inflation) helps solve the three problems that previously plagued the Big Bang model. 

* In a short introduction we must leave out detail, but in essence Inflation solves the Horizon Problem because at the very early stages of the Big Bang, everywhere was close enough to every other &quot;where&quot; such that they were well mixed. The sudden inflation essentially locked that well-mixed state in and it remained as the Universe has expanded to today. 

* Inflation solved the Flatness Problem because the inflation naturally ran out of energy just as the density reached the right value. 

* It solved the Smoothness Problem because in the very early Universe, quantum fluctuations caused small irregularities throughout the baby Universe (we know such &quot;irregularities&quot; occur all the time in space today). You can think of these as small density concentrations or &quot;knots&quot; in the fabric of space. Inflation suddenly blew these up to enormous size, trillions of times larger than the originally were. As the Universe expanded, matter collected around these spatial &quot;kinks&quot; and eventually formed galaxies.

Although there have been other theories, most notably the Steady State theory, none have been able to adequately explain all the evidence in at least a semi-consistent and coherent model. Some of the other theories are just variants on the Big Bang model.

We have a reasonable mechanism to explain Cosmic Inflation and the changes in the Universe since the Big Bang itself, but the cause of the original &quot;bang&quot; is unknown. There have been suggestions, but none offer an ultimate solution. One idea is that the Universe arose completely out of nothing, just as we observe (although on vastly smaller scales) in the quantum physics we know today. [Particles come into existence out of nothing all the time, but they do not stay around long enough to be counted. They are called &quot;virtual particles&quot; and there is strong evidence that they exist even though we normally are unaware of them. By the proper application of energy, we can make some of these particles stay around longer so we know they exist.]

What caused the Big Bang? At this point in time there are no satisfying scientific answers. Please realize that this does not necessarily mean that no answers exist or that it necessarily implies that the Universe was created by a deity. It certainly does mean that we have limited knowledge. That may change, but as of now we do not know.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Hotkeys==
One of the great advantages Wings 3d offers its users, is the ability to set User Defined Hotkeys.  There are standard hotkeys which come predefined upon installing Wings, but most of these can be redefined to your liking.

===Assigning Hotkeys===
Any command that appears in a menu can be assigned to a keyboard shortcut.  To assign a hotkey to a command, open the menu containing the command. Highlight the command and press the '''&lt; Insert &gt;''' or  the '''&lt; / &gt;''' key, followed by the key you wish to assign it to.  The hotkey should now appear beside the command.  To delete a hotkey, highlight the command and press the '''&lt; Del &gt;''' or '''&lt; \ &gt;''' key.

These instructions can also be found in '''Help|How to define hotkeys''' 

===What to Know about Hotkeys===

Here are a few facts about hotkeying in Wings, which will help in creating a layout that works for you.

:*The hotkey assigned to a tool or command is displayed beside it in the menu where that command is found.

:*Wings accepts any combination of '''&lt;Ctrl&gt;''', '''&lt;Shift&gt;''' or '''&lt;Alt&gt;''' as a modifier to a hotkey.  For instance, using the '''B''' key, you can assign the following eight command:

::*''B, &lt;Ctrl&gt;+B, &lt;Shift&gt;+B, &lt;Alt&gt;+B, &lt;Ctrl&gt;+&lt;Shift&gt;+B, &lt;Ctrl&gt;+&lt;Alt&gt;+B, &lt;Shift&gt;+&lt;Alt&gt;+B, &lt;Ctrl&gt;+&lt;Shift&gt;+&lt;Alt&gt;+B''

:*Wings uses Context Sensitive hotkeys. Just as with Context Sensative Menus, Wings only allows you access to hotkeys of tools and commands available from within the current Selection Mode.  This means that you can re-use the same hotkey for tools or commands in different Modes.  For instance '''S''' can be assigned to both '''Smooth''' in the Face menu and '''Slide''' in the Edge menu.  If there is a conflict Wings will tell you right away.

:*Hotkeys assigned to tools or commands found in the Menu Bar cannot be re-used.  This is because the commands found in Menu Bar menus will (for the most part) work across all modes, making them global hotkeys.  For example if you assign '''&lt;Ctrl&gt;+T''' to '''Tweak''' in the Tools Menu, you cannot re-use this hotkey because pressing '''&lt;Ctrl&gt;+T''' in any mode will start up '''Tweak Mode'''.

:*Wings does not currently allow hotkeying for Right or Middle mouse button options.

:*For your current hotkey listing, in the Menu Bar go to '''Help|Defined Hotkeys'''.
:*Currently there is no built in facility for printing a list of your hotkeys, however one can use the Erlang Console to produce an .html of all your hotkeys, which you can print.  To do this you must enter some code into the Erlang Console.  Instructions are found on Scorpius's web page http://chronosphere.home.comcast.net/tut-wings-shell.htm

===Hotkey Strategies===

Although everybody eventually comes up with their own system for hotkeys, there are some good basic strategies to get you started.  The primary tools in wings such as Move, Rotate, and Scale have five basic directions along which you can perform an operation.  These are:

:*the three axies '''X''', '''Y''', '''Z'''
:*along the selection's '''Normal'''
:*along the plane created by the camera's point of view, called '''Free'''

The primary tools Move, Rotate, and Scale also share the fact that they are available across all of the selection modes.  Because of this it makes sense to use the same hotkey for Move, say 'M', in all four selection modes and use modifier keys to achieve the five basic directions.  Because the basic directions X, Y, Z, Normal, and Free exist across all modes for a variety of tools, it makes sense to assign a modifier key to each direction. For example if we decide that '''&lt;Alt&gt;''' represents the  X direction, then 'Move along X axis' would be &lt;Alt&gt;+M.  You can then hotkey Move along X axis as &lt;Alt&gt;+M in the Vertex, Edge, Face, Body, and Light selection modes, so no matter what selection mode you are in you can always hit &lt;Alt&gt;+M to move your selection along the X axis.  You could then consider using &lt;Ctrl&gt; for the Z axis, and &lt;Shift&gt; for the Y axis so no matter what tool you use the modifier for the operation's direction is always the same.  Say you decide that 'R' is for rotate.  Rotate around the Z axis can be hotkeyed as &lt;Shift&gt;+R, and around the X axis can be &lt;Alt&gt;+R just like Move along Z axis could be &lt;Shift&gt;+M.  Once you decide what is best for you you can assign the other directions.  Remember that there are eight possible combinations of any key plus its modifiers.  This should be plenty to get the majority of the tools hotkeyed in a way you are going to remember them.

==Directions==
# In a large bowl, combine meat, water chestnuts, onion, eggs, soy sauce, salt, and pepper.
# Mix well and set aside.
# On a clean, dry surface, place one egg roll wrapper with one corner facing you (like a baseball diamond).
# Place about 1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] of the meat mixture in the center of the wrapper.
# Dip your fingers in a glass of water and lightly wet the corner pointing away from you (second base).
# Fold the corner closest to you (home base) over the mixture, then fold the side corners over that and roll away from your body.
# The wet corner should seal the roll.
# Repeat the process with the remaining ingredients.
# Place the rolls in large zip-close plastic bags and freeze overnight.
# In a large [[Cookbook:Saucepan|saucepan]], heat the oil to about 350°F (use an instant cooking thermometer), or until it begins to shimmer and the oil bubbles lightly when a wooden chopstick is inserted.
# Using [[Cookbook:Tongs|tongs]], place each frozen lumpia roll in the hot oil and [[Cookbook:Fry|fry]] until brown, about 3 to 4 minutes.
# Use tongs to turn rolls to ensure even cooking.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This information is intended to be used as a resource for educators to find ways to help English language learners. It is crucial for educators to teach to students' learning styles. Moreover, identifying what is the best learning style to use is critical when teaching English language learners. ELL students, specially the older ones, can be proficient in their own languages, nevertheless it is common for them to experience difficulty when learning a second language. One of the reasons for this phenomenon could be because of the different learning styles the learner is used too.

== Learning Styles ==
There are several different learning styles, but there is not one style that has been proven better than another on its own.  Educators don’t just focus on any learning style specifically; in fact there is a significant overlap in all the different learning styles.  Auditory learners are the type of students who recall everything they hear.  They prefer oral instruction and they learn by listening and speaking best.  This is particularly difficult for ELL learners because their input comprehension is not developed enough to process all the information at once.  ELL students will remember what they were able to comprehend and more than likely will capture some of the context and not all making this a very challenging learning style on its own.

Visual Learners will do best in an environment that they are able to see what they are learning about.  Their comprehension ability is enhanced by presenting the information in a visual manner.  Usually this information is presented by using maps, computer graphics, graphic organizers, charts, cartoons, posters, text with pictures, movies, etc.  Today technology has taken visual aids in the classroom to the next level.  There are so many ways in which you can present a topic to students using technology as a tool to aid a lesson in order to make a visual learning environment.

Kinesthetic learners are the type of learners that captivates new information by touching or manipulating objects.  This type of learner usually involves the student’s whole body in learning or otherwise known as Total Physical Response.  TPR is an excellent method to teach ESL\ELL students because they remember material best if they act it out and are involved in the interaction.  Some examples of this technique is playing games that involve their whole body, movement activities, making models, following instructions to make something or setting up experiments.

== Technology as Intervention Strategies ==

This is an interactive series of activities and games that teachers using McMillan Treasures Curriculum in elementary grades for language arts can access via the Internet.  Students can try at home or they can interact with the website in the classroom during center time if the capabilities of computers will allow it.  These activities are related with the story, vocabulary, and grammar that the students are studying in class.

== Great Resources and Links: ==

1. Just as important to identify the student’s learning style is to identify the stages of language acquisition in the second language.  Here is a great resource link to better understand the stage of language acquisition.
http://www.everythingesl.net/inservices/language_stages.php

2. Once the teacher is able to identify the best combination of learning styles to implement in the classroom, the stage of language development needs to be identified.  Then a series of interventions and strategies are implemented, here is a good resource link on issues of identification and intervention methods.

3. What to do when you have an ESL\ELL student with special needs?  Here is link to a great article on this matter and it is a source for great strategies to implement in the classroom.

      <comment>Changed markup arround firs source code listing.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">In this section you will make a program to display &quot;Hello, World!&quot; on the screen.

==Writing the Program==
Make a new text file in Notepad and type in the following text:
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
.NOLIST
#define   EQU   .equ
#define   equ   .equ
#define   END   .end
#define   end   .end
#include &quot;ti83plus.inc&quot;
.LIST

     .org 9D93h
     .db $BB,$6D
      ld a,0
      ld (CURCOL),a
      ld (CURROW),a
      ld hl,text
      B_CALL(_PutS)
      ret
text:
      .db &quot;Hello, World!&quot;,0

.end
end
&lt;/source&gt;
The tabbed lines need to be tabbed! Save this file as ''myprog.z80'' into your &quot;Programs&quot; subfolder.

==Compiling the Program==
Compiling essentially means translating text code into code that a machine can read.

To compile your program ''myprog.z80'' first open a Command Prompt (''Start &gt; Run... &gt; command'' in Win9x, or ''Start &gt; Run... &gt; cmd'' in WinNT). You should be faced with a black window with some white text saying what folder you are in. The first step is to change the folder to your programs folder. To do this use the following commands:
#cd ''subfoldername'' (This will go to the subfolder that you tell it to.)
#cd .. (This will instantly go to the folder that holds the folder you are in.)
Afterwards, you need to type in:
#compile myprog
This should automatically compile ''myprog.z80'' if you have followed all instructions correctly.
[[Image:Cprompt.gif|frame|none|Screenshot]]
The finished program should be located in your &quot;Programs&quot; folder as ''myprog.8xp''.

==Testing the Program==
On your computer, open up the TI 83 Plus Flash Debugger to make a fake calculator for testing purposes. Click on the white paper icon to make a new fake calculator and choose the 83+ calculator.
Then click on Load... RAM File and open your compiled program (''myprog.8xp''). Finally, click on the triangle-shaped play button to begin emulation. On the fake calculator, press [2nd]+[Catalog] to bring up the catalog and arrow down to Asm(. Press enter to insert the command into the screen and then select your program ([PRGM],[ENTER]). The screen on the calc should say ''Asm(prgmMYPROG)''. Now press enter, and &quot;Hello World&quot; should be displayed on the screen.

Always test your programs on the Flash Debugger before you use them on your real calculator because there is a large chance of your real calculator crashing.

==Commands of the Program==
The only lines of importance now are the middle ones:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;      ld a,0
      ld (CURCOL),a
      ld (CURROW),a
      ld hl,text
      B_CALL(_PutS)
text:
      .db &quot;Hello, World!&quot;,0
     ret
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
When the calculator executes a program, it follows the commands line by line. The first line (ld a,0) loads zero into a, which is a commonly used variable. So now the variable a=0. The next two lines load that number into the cursor row and column. So now the cursor is located at 0,0 and the next text will be displayed at that location. The fourth line (ld hl,text), loads the location of .db &quot;Hello... into hl, another variable. B_Call(_PutS) takes the text that hl has specified and displays it at the current cursor location. Finally, ret tells the calculator to exit out of the program. You should now have a vague understanding of the functions of most of the lines in your first program.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction to John Chapter 5==

'''Key Points to Look For''' 
* Comparison with narrative in the Synoptic Gospels describing the healing of a paralytic.
* The idea that God works on the Sabbath.
* The relationship between equality and subordination in Jesus' words.
* James McGrath's argument (in an article in ''NTS'' and in his book ''John's Apologetic Christology''[http://www.netlibrary.com/Search/SearchResults.aspx?__EVENTTARGET=&amp;__EVENTARGUMENT=&amp;VIEW_STATE_FIELD_NAME=1&amp;__VIEWSTATE=&amp;tt1=FullText&amp;t1=McGrath+Apologetic+Christology&amp;basicEntryButton=Search&amp;ql=ENG]) that in 5:18 the participle should be understood in the following manner: &quot;He was making God his Father, and yet making himself equal to God&quot;, so that there is a tension between a claim to sonship and behaving as an equal, rather than the latter being the implication of  former.
* Is &quot;making himself equal to God&quot; a correct or incorrect assessment of Jesus from the perspective of this author?

'''A controversy between Jesus and the Jews''' In the fifth chapter the Jews are confronting Jesus about breaking the law of Moses.  Jesus instantly healed a man who had been unable to walk for thirty-eight years.  He told the man to pick up his bed and walk.   Because there was a law in the Hebrew religion about working on the Sabbath, the man carrying his bed was accused of breaking the law.   This is a very important point in Jesus' ministry because it marks the first time Jesus directly incites &quot;The Jews.&quot;  Jesus claimed that he was doing exactly what God told and even showed him to do, but because of religious blindness the Jews confronting him did not recognize, approve or understand that God was being revealed through the miracle of Jesus.  Jesus was not putting himself above the laws of the Jews by commanding a man to perform a task on the Sabbath, he was showing them that they had the wrong law.  To further this controversy of the times, the healed man seems to have more less concern for the law than for the man (Jesus) who gave him permission to disobey the law.  In v. 13, the narrator tells the reader that Jesus had “slipped into the crowd,” which shows once again that He keeps His ministry low profile, and for the people.  Jesus later tells the healed man to “Stop sinning,” he did not teach that humans inherited a sin nature or that they could not stop sinning. By saying, “Something worse may happen to you,” Jesus is forewarning the man of a punishment for sins. Later he says whoever sins is a slave of sin and slaves cannot abide in the Father's house.

At the beginning of this chapter, Jesus performs a miracle. He heals an invalid who is trying to make his way to healing waters and is receiving no help from those around him. Jesus tells him to pick up his mat and walk away, and the man is immediately cured. However, a little ways down the road, the man is stopped and chided for carrying his mat on the Sabbath day. However, he tells those who stop him that he was told by the one who healed him to carry the mat. Breaking Sabbath was a serious offense in the ancient world, and this event helped to spark anger against Jesus from the people at the top. 

It is more likely that the sin of which Jesus is talking is a symbolic and thus the punishment that would follow the sin would not be specific to the man or represent actual sickness.  &quot;The misfortune is punishment for  was a common view, which has not died out in modernity,&quot; (Smith 133).  The sickness that may result from human sin could be paralleled to evil and &quot;sickness&quot; among people. 

This passage is the first occurrence in the Gospel of John where someone was healed by their faith in Jesus.  When the man was healed just by Jesus asking him if he wanted to be healed, it is the same occurrence as in the Synoptic Gospels when people are healed by their faith Jesus.  The important part of this passage is the conflict between Jesus and the religious leaders.  Jesus healed a man but was &quot;wrong&quot; according to the Jewish leaders because the healing took place on the Sabbath.  This story is an illustration of someone being blind to faith.  The leaders are so concerned with meaningless laws that they do not see that good is being done through faith. Isn't this what John wrot that the Law came by Moses but grace and truth came by Jesus. 

The Jews seemed quite upset with Jesus claiming to be God's son. The work he did in this chapter, however, is highly appropriate for a father/son relationship. In verse 17, Jesus says, &quot;My Father is still working, and I also am working.&quot; This is consistent with the fact that sons typically learned the family business and became apprentices for their fathers. Fathers also were known to send their eldest sons to do business for them when they were unable to do so. In a sense, then, Jesus is acting as an apprentice to God, his Father. Jesus explains this further in verse 19, when he starts using the phrase &quot;as the Father, so also the Son...&quot;. The only time Jesus says the Son does something without the Father is in verse 22 when he talks about judgment. 

Unlike the Synoptic Gospels, in which all accounts of Jesus' healing miracles take place outside of Jerusalem, John's account of Jesus' healing takes place ''inside'' Jerusalem.  Also, &quot;Bethesda&quot; is a very real and exact location in Jerusalem.  It was probably used as a healing spa for cripples and paralytics.  The man, obviously sick and or paralyzed, came to this place for healing (or at the very least, an ease from pain).
  
'''Jesus' Message to the Jews'''     After it is stated that the Jews are looking to kill Jesus because he was, one, working on the Sabbath, and two, making himself equal to God, he gives them this very long message that starts at verse 19 and ends at the end of the chapter.  Basically what Jesus tells the Jews that confront and see him there is that he does things like the Father in a like manner and  the Father works through him so that others may believe.  He further says that &quot;the hour is coming where the dead will hear the son of God and those who have given heed will live&quot; (John 5:25) (a reference to the Judgment Day when he raises the dead).  What this means then is that those who have believed will be able to go on in the second coming of Jesus, and live once more.  Judgment is soon coming, but is not up to Jesus to judge because he only judges through the will of the one who sent him.  He then further goes on to explain that there is another here on earth that bears witness to him (John the Baptist) and they have taken kindly to him and were willing for awhile to &quot;rejoice greatly in his light&quot;(John 5:35).  Now it is Jesus who has come to bear witness to God.  Furthermore, these are the ways in which the Jews can be saved, by believing in those that come to bear witness to God, through John, and then Jesus. They only have to believe in Jesus and what he says and they can be saved.

'''A Note on Sonship in John Chapter 5'''  In claiming His Sonship (Verse 18), Jesus was completely misunderstood. Later he tells the Jews that their father is the devil and they say no God is our father. So they all claimed sonship. They wanted to kill him for claiming to be the Messiah and because they had really embraced the devil as their father while claiming God as their father. 

'''Verse 5:18'''  There is some controversy over how this verse should translate.  The New Revised Standard Version states this verse as, &quot;For this reason the Jews were seeking all the more to kill him, because he was not only breaking the sabbath, but was also calling God his own Father, thereby making himself equal to God.&quot;  However, one particular scholar, James McGrath, believes the end of this line should read something along the lines of &quot;...he was not only breaking the sabbath, but was calling God his own Father, and also claiming himself equal to God.&quot;

 The charge that he was making himself equal to God is moot since the Jews who wanted to kill him made the same claim that God was their father. The fact is he said &quot;The father is greater than I.&quot; 

 McGrath believes this is the case because in Biblical times, it wasn't assumed that a son calling a man his father made the son equal to his father.  In fact, the relationship between a father and son in these times was definitely not of equals, but involved the son's obedience, and a hierarchal relationship, making the father &quot;above&quot; the son.  Therefore, McGrath's translation makes more sense historically, considering Jesus calling God his Father because he truly believed he was wouldn't necessarily automatically mean, during the times these events occurred, that Jesus believes he is equal to his Father, God.  Either way, verse 5:18 in John, that shows the Jews' dismay with Jesus' claims, is an ideal segue into Jesus' long monologue regarding what he proclaims his relationship to be with God.  

'''Jesus &quot;equal&quot; to God?''' The major question throughout the end of chapter five asks was Jesus really &quot;equal&quot; to God?  This question should be asked because a first glance at verses 19-32 provides a seemingly contradictory picture of a Jesus that is both very submissive to the Father but also taking on some of his tasks. First, one must look to the definition of equal. This word should be researched for us to gain a better understanding of whether or not Jesus was really equal to God. There are several verses that suggest they were not. For instance just a few  verses can be examined. Verse 19, Verse 22 &quot;For not even the Father judges anyone, but He has given all judgment to the Son...&quot; Verse 27 &quot;He gave Him authority to execute judgment, because He is the Son of Man.&quot; Verse 30 &quot;I can do nothing on My own initiative. As I hear, I judge; and My judgment is just, because I do not seek My own will, but the will of Him who sent Me.&quot; (NAS). The words I speak are not mine but the fathers. Of my own self I can do nothing. The miracles are done through me by the father.  

There are also verses that appear to suggest equality. For instance, verse 21 &quot;For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son also gives life to whom He wishes.&quot; verse 26 &quot;For just as the Father has life in Himself, even so He gave to the Son also to have life in Himself.&quot; (NAS). If the father gave him the power he could not be equal to the Father or he would have the power in himself. God cannot give something to God. One must look deep into contextual meanings of this last chapter to really gain an understanding of whether Jesus and God were &quot;equal&quot;.  The main part of this context is the Gospel itself.  It is a mistake  to read John 5  through the lens of the prologue.  If you believe that the first few verses, the author portrays Jesus as &quot;the Word,&quot; saying, &quot;In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God&quot; (John 1:1), you will misread everything to make Jesus God. But if you look carefully at the prologue it says the word was with God. It does not say Jesus was with the father. You cannot add words to scripture. If the word is the Angel of Wisdom, God's architect who inhabited Jesus, then Jesus is the agent of God and given God's power but not equal to God. The son of God but not God the son. The phrase God the son never appears in Scripture. In fact it says God is not a man nor a son of man.  However, if you  read the final statement that the &quot;Word (Jesus) was God&quot; you must force everything to fit your preconceived idea and explain away things like Jesus being tempted to sin. God cannot be tempted. Jesus not knowing the day of his return. Jesus dying. God cannot die. You end up saying Jesus is both fully God and fully human, which of course sounds contradictory and is the orthodox view on the matter. The author of John doesn't give us such contradictions. If you say the man Jesus did have personal and human opinions and wills that were separate from his divinity, and occasionally he had to suppress his own will to allow God's will to be done.You create a schizophrenic hybrid man who at times is divine and at times human and feels abandoned by his divine side on the cross. It's like saying I am poor because in my right pocket I have no money but in my left pocket I have a million dollars.

All of that being said, how do you reconcile  John 10:30 &quot;The Father and I are one.&quot;; John 14:9 &quot;Whoever has seen me has seen the Father.&quot;; John 20:28-29 &quot;Thomas answered him, 'My Lord and my God!' Jesus said to him, 'Have you believed because you have seen me? Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have come to believe.'&quot;; as well as the response that Jesus gives in Chapter 5 that makes it pretty clear that he does everything that the Father does, from raising of the dead, to handing out judgment, and even receiving the praise and glory that God receives (Smith pg. 135).  In all of these passages John is putting Jesus on an even plane with God and when challenged or questioned about his relationship with God Jesus never denies their equality but rather offers explanations that are either affirmations of that claim or at worst ambiguous.  One may not be able to make the case that the New Testament as a whole portrays Jesus as equal to God, but it seems pretty clear that some verses seem to. 

The answer is simple Jerome who translated the scriptures into Latin in the 5th Century and the English translators who came on the scene 1800 years after Jesus were already convinced that Jesus was God and that there was a trinity before they sat down to translate their texts. They force it upon their work. If you look at the confession of Thomas in Hebrew he calls Jesus my adoni and elohim. Moses was an adoni and elohim. The Judge of Israel were adoni and elohim. It means my master and God's appointed agent. 
Jesus prayed that the disciple could share the same oneness with the Father that he had so I can say I and the father are one. That doesn't mean I am claiming to be God.If we had time I could take you through the New Testament and show you all the mistranslations where Jesus was deified. Instead I appeal to 1 Cor 8:6 But to us there is but one God, the Father. Jesus told Mary Magdalene I go to my God and Your God, my father and your father. If he were God he would not have a God.


'''Comparison with the Synoptic Gospels'''  There are a few main similarities between the healing story in John and the healing story in the Synoptics.  There is controversy over Jesus' authority in both Mark 2 and John 5.  Also, there is a failure to observe the Sabbath in both Mark 3 and John 5.  On top of these general similarities, John 5: 8 and Mark 2: 9 and 11 are almost exactly the same.  John 5: 8 states, &quot;Jesus said to him, 'Stand up, take your mat and walk.'&quot;  Mark 2: 9 and 11 state, &quot;Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Stand up and take your mat and walk'?...I say to you, stand up, take your mat, and go to your home.&quot;  While John 5 and Mark 2 are incredibly close, there are some significant differences in the stories.  First of all, John 5 takes place in Jerusalem.  In the Synoptics, there are no healing stories that take place there.  Second of all, in John 5, Jesus has knowledge of how long the man has been ill (38 years...the same time Israel was in the wilderness).  In the Synoptics, there is no proof that Jesus knows such things.  On top of these two differences, it is very John-like to have Jesus approach the man instead of the other way around.  This doesn't really happen in the Synoptics.  In conclusion, while it seems, on the surface, that the healing story in John could be a re-writing of Mark 2, scholars believe the differences are too significant.

John reports events that took place at another feast in Jerusalem and the third sign of Jesus’
ministry. At the pool of Bethesda, there was a man who had been ill for thirty-eight years. He was questioned
by Jesus if he wanted to be well.  The man replied that he had never been the successful one; someone
else had always beaten him to the water. Jesus’ reaction was instant, &quot;Rise, take up your mat and
walk,&quot; (verse 8).  This incident led to controversy with the rulers because it was done on the Sabbath.  First, because the man was carrying his mat, they accused the man of working on the Sabbath and second, the Jews challenged Jesus about his actions on the Sabbath.  Jesus replied, &quot;My Father is working still, and I am
working&quot; (Verse 17).  The Sabbath was to be a holy day used for worship, rest and for doing good deeds.   In
addition, because Jesus referred to God as his Father they accused him of blasphemy, making himself equal to
God. Jesus replied, &quot;The Son can do nothing of his own accord, but only what he sees the Father doing….&quot;.  
Far from claiming to be equal with God, Jesus showed that he learned from the Father and did his works. He claimed the father was greater than he and never claimed equality. He said of myself I can do nothing. The father is in me doing these things. The Jews wanted to kill him because darkness hates the light and tries to extinguish it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Functionality==
3D scanner can scan a three dimensional object into the computer. It create a real- world object which can used many ways such as industrial design, prototyping, movies and video games.  There are many kinds of 3D scaners.scaners.  3D scanner can be fast and easy way to create 3D objects.

==Types of 3D scanners==
There are two types of 3D scanners that will be introduced now, contact and non-contact. As well, non-contact can be divided into active scanners and passive scanners. Let's look more information about the types of 3D scanners.

===Contact===
By physical touching, contact 3D works well. For instance, CMM is a contact 3D scanner. One of the disadvantages of CMM is that it requires contact, and this object is being scanned while people use it. Another disadvantage is that the function of CMM is slower than other kind of scanner

===Active===
Some radiation are emitted by Active scanners, such as light, ultrasound or x-ray.

===Passive===
Passive scanners do not emit any radiation.
As well, passive scanners do not need any particular hardware, so it is normally cheap.

==Desktop 3D Scanner==
Before the most flexible 3D scanners developed, there is one cyberware's Desktop scanner which called model 15 shows up. It allows you to catch the shape well and get the many kinds of objects. This small system suits easily on a desktop. Being a highly integrated Model 15 provide all the 3D scanning resources that people need, however, it only costs you a small amoumt of money.

The features of the Desktop 3D scanners
*scanning unit
*motion subsystem
*software - in an integrated format

With a little bit extra of a graphics workstation, everything are included, and it makes fast, high-quality scans.

==Entertainment==
By creating digital 3D models, 3D scanners can be used to make movies and video games

==Manufacturers==
3D scanners were provided by many measurement systems. Most scanners perform either an open data format for x,y,z coodinate data and save that in an ASCII file.

When you buy a measurement system, you have to consider accuracyk volume, speed, and color. Futhermore, you have to consider your specific application, the size of your project, and the distance of the object from which you will be collection data.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Variables==

The variables in each equation should be identified immediately above it.  Furthermore, any details needed to understand the applicability of an equation should be stated explicity. [[User:D021317c|D021317c]] 05:50, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

==Beginning at the beginning==

Acoustics is the science of sound, isn't it?  What is sound?  I suspect it's a sensation, and that what we sense is acoustic energy, so we should approach the subject from a study of the nature of that energy. By introducing differential equations into the discussion, we lose any readers who haven't reached the second or third years of college, and those who haven't majored in the sciences. I disapprove. On the other hand, a great deal of complexity can be presented without any mathematics, leaving it to those who are familiar with arithmetic, algebra, calculus, or differential equations to infer what they must be, and presenting them separately later (aimed at various levels of education) for those who are interested. In other words, let's have a book which begins with accessibility to the broadest possible audience, and take it as far as readers care to go, but in easy, incremental stages. [[User:D021317c|D021317c]] 06:36, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

== Equations of sound ==
The way the wave equations are written here seems a bit off.  Is their a reason to denote the time variable by ''x'' instead of ''t''? [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 15:46, 10 March 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* If you're a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

Good luck!.

I remember my user name by the mnemonic &quot;Oh, to unfree one's heaven!&quot; recalling that the d prefix and c suffix originally stood for Dade County, though it's been changed to &quot;Miami-Dade County&quot; since &quot;d021317c&quot; was assigned to me by the free public library ISP, sometime around 1994.  That ISP is gone now, and I pay $10/month for dial-up service.</text>

MenuLayoutDelete.zip

Link:&lt;br&gt;
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/dejavu-l/files/DVX/Miscellaneous/

You need to login into yahoogroups to access it.

----

To use the MenuLayoutDelete file for recovering lost windows positions in DVX:

#Download the file to the hard disk.
#Close DVX.
#Double-click on the file and follow the (brief) instructions.
#Reopen DVX. Normally, everything should be back to normal.

Please note that this action will at the same time reset all &quot;customizations&quot; that may have been performed to DVX, as Atril commented when sending the file (I understand that this refers to special fonts for some windows, etc., etc.). Anyway, very few people heavily customize their DVX interface.

I request that you add them in a sub page or on a different page (perhaps at the end of the tutorial), rather than right in line with the text, so that people have a chance to do the program before seeing a solution.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello, welcome to wikibooks!

I see that you've been doing some cleanup work on the [[Control Systems]] book. I've been the lead author on that book for some time now, and it is always nice to have some additional help. As you've already noticed, there are plenty of things to fix in that book, and we need all the help we can get!

If you need anything, of if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask me [[User talk:Whiteknight|on my user talk page]]. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 15:26, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</text>

* 2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Chop|chopped]] fresh [[Cookbook:Chives|chives]]

==Procedure==

# Preheat oven to [[Cookbook:Oven_temperatures|350°F]].
# Butter a 2-[[Cookbook:Quart|quart]] [[Cookbook:Soufflé|soufflé]] dish.
# Add 1 cup cheese, tilting dish to evenly coat the bottom and sides.
# Shake out any excess.
# Set aside in refrigerator.
# Place the sour cream in a large mixing bowl.
# [[Cookbook:Sift|Sift]] the flour into the sour cream, then [[Cookbook:Whisk|whisk]] until well combined.
# Add the egg yolks, one at a time, whisking after each addition.
# Stir in salt, cayenne, chives, and remaining 2 cups cheese.
# In a large clean bowl (copper is ideal), vigorously whisk the egg whites until stiff peaks form.
# Gently fold egg whites into the sour cream mixture.
# Pour the batter into the prepared soufflé dish and [[Cookbook:Bake|bake]] until soufflé has risen 2 to 3 inches above the rim and top is golden brown, 1 to 1½ hours.

It's downright atrocious that this is considered a &quot;finished&quot; book, with all the basic stuff that was wrong right on the first page:  miscapitalized joules, newtons, wrong symbol for seconds, italic unit symbols (and not properly spaced), a ludicrous claim that dynes are SI units, etc.  [[User:Metric1000|Metric1000]] 16:39, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

== Dim definitions ==

I can't recollect all, and I decided to refrain from more corrections.
The last epitome I've noticed was &quot;Parsec&quot;. Yes, good explanation of the abbreviation; but please confer the rest with [http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/parsec the OED article] (though OED's approximation is looser).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Coldfusion can handle the creation, modification, display, and usage of dates.

==Setting a Date==
In order to set a date use the cfset function.
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;cfset mydate = '12/3/2006'&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

==Displaying a Date==
The basic display of a date is simply to output it.
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;cfoutput&gt;#mydate#&lt;/cfoutput&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
This would display: 12/3/2006

There is function that allows you to easily convert a date into another format.
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;cfoutput&gt;#dateformat(mydate, 'yyyy/mm/dd')#&lt;/cfoutput&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

This would display: 2006/12/3

The options to be used here are:
* d: Day of the month as digits, no leading zeros
* dd: Day of the month as digits
* ddd: Day of the week, abbr.
* dddd: Day of the week, name
* m: Month as digits, no leading zero
* mm: Month as digits
* mmm: Month as abbr.
* mmmm: Month as name.
* y: Year - last two digits, no leading zeros
* yy: Year - last two digits
* yyyy: Year - four digits
The options can be separated by - / , or space to create the format that you want.

==Modifying a date==
If we want to add 5 days to today we would use this function.
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;cfset todayplus5 = dateadd('d', 5, now())&gt; 
&lt;/pre&gt;

The options for dateadd are:
* yyyy: Year
* q: Quarter
* m: Month
* y: Day of year
* d: Day
* w: Weekday
* ww: Week
* h: Hour
* n: Minute (remember m is for month not minute)
* s: Second

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Microprocessor Design}}

== Pipelining Introduction ==

Let us break down our microprocessor into 5 distinct activities, which generally correspond to 5 distinct pieces of hardware:

#Instruction fetch (IF)
#Instruction Decode (ID)
#Execution (EX)
#Memory Read/Write (MEM)
#Result Writeback (WB)

Any given instruction will only require one of these modules at a time, generally in this order. The following timing diagram of the multi-cycle processor will show this in more detail:

[[Image:Nopipeline.png|center|500px]]

This is all fine and good, but at any moment, 4 out of 5 units are not active, and could likely be used for other things. 

=== Pipelining Philosophy ===

Pipelining is concerned with the following tasks:
*Use multi-cycle methodologies to reduce the amount of computation in a single cycle.
*Shorter computations per cycle allow for faster clock cycles.
*Overlapping instructions allows all components of a processor to be operating on a different instruction.
*Throughput is increased by having instructions complete more frequently.

We will talk about how to make these things happen in the remainder of the chapter.

== Pipelining Hardware ==

Given our multicycle processor, what if we wanted to overlap our execution, so that up to 5 instructions could be processed at the same time? Let's contract our timing diagram a little bit to show this idea:

[[Image:Fivestagespipeline.png|center|500px]]

As this diagram shows, each element in the processor is active in every cycle, and the instruction rate of the processor has been increased by 5 times! The question now is, what additional hardware do we need in order to perform this task? We need to add storage registers between each pipeline state to store the partial results between cycles, and we also need to reintroduce the redundant hardware from the single-cycle CPU. We can continue to use a single memory module (for instructions and data), so long as we restrict memory read operations to the first half of the cycle, and memory write operations to the second half of the cycle (or vice-versa). We can save time on the memory access by calculating the memory addresses in the previous stage.

[[Image:Pipeline-base.png|center|500px]]

The registers would need to hold the data from the pipeline at that point, and also the necessary control codes to operate the remainder of the pipeline.

Our resultant processor design will look similar to this:

[[Image:Pipeline MIPS.png|center|500px]]

If we have 5 instructions, we can show them in our pipeline using different colors. In the diagram below, white corresponds to a NOP, and the different colors correspond to other instructions in the pipeline. Each stage, the instructions shift forward through the pipeline.

[[Image:Pipeline 3.png|center|600px]]

== Superpipeline ==

Superpipelining is the technique of raising the pipeline depth in order to increase the clock speed and reduce the latency of individual stages. If the ALU takes three times longer than any other module, we can divide the ALU into three separate stages, which will reduce the amount of time wasted on shorter stages. The problem here is that we need to find a way to subdivide our stages into shorter stages, and we also need to construct more complicated control units to operate the pipeline and prevent all the possible '''hazards'''.

It is not uncommon for modern high-end processors to have more than 20 pipeline stages.

{{TextBox|'''Example: Intel Pentium 4'''

The Intel Pentium 4 processor is a recent example of a super-pipelined processor. This diagram shows a Pentium 4 pipeline with 20 stages.

Welcome to the monopoly project page.  This is a book about the best selling board game monopoly.  If you are interested in taking part in this project please sign up under contributors.



==In Scope==

The game's design is clearly based upon images and places located within Atlantic City, New Jersey.  Hence &quot;Boardwalk.&quot;

===Rules===

===Tactics===

===Variants===

==Out of Scope==

===Computer game versions===

===Endless list of different place names from various versions.  (This would be huge)===

Rework Contents Page --[[User:AdRiley|AdRiley]] 21:01, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

==Issues==

===Image Copyrights===
How do we stand with regards to including images of monopoly in our book?  I should imagine monopoly is copyrighted, are photographs I take of my set breach of copyright? --[[User:AdRiley|AdRiley]] 21:01, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

:Yes, unless the company that owns them (Parker Bros.?) releases them under public domain or one of the free-use copyrights. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:34, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

::One thing that you should try is to contact Parker Bros, and ask for permission to use some images for &quot;a book you are writing on monopoly&quot;. They might give you some images, or they might give you permission to use images you already have. This strategy has worked sometimes in the past, but not always. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:28, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

::If you do that, you need to make sure they understand that it's a ''wiki''book though, otherwise they might not understand that you're not asking for personal permission, but rather free licensing.--[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 10:12, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

There are some images on commons for you to use, and so long as they are on commons, you can use them without fear of copyright problems:
*[[Commons:Monopoly]]
*[[Commons:Category:Monopoly]]
There aren't alot of images, but this should get you started. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 01:46, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

===Beyond Boardwalk and Park Place Rules copyright===
Do we have the right to reproduce the rules from the 1986 book Beyond Boardwalk and Park Place Rules?  I suspect not... --[[User:AdRiley|AdRiley]] 21:01, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

:No, for the same reasons that the images are problematic. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:36, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

:Reproducing the rules verbatim is not allowed, but you are likely allowed to paraphrase them, so long as you offer proper citations. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:29, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Plan on one canoe for every two people.  The supplies should be loaded into the center of the canoe, with the heaviest items being placed lowest in the boat, and the lighter items place on top of them.  Remember that the canoe will almost certainly take on a bit of water from wet shoes, dripping paddles, etc., so don't put anything that must stay dry on the bottom of the boat.  Some have reported success in placing a tarp down first, loading equipment on top of it, and then drawing the edges over the top of the gear.  How ever you load the gear into the canoe, make sure you tie everything down.  If the canoe capsizes during the trip, you want the gear to stay with the boat rather than go floating merrily down the stream - or worse - sink to the bottom.  Try to remember that this is a possibility when you are selecting your gear.  Don't bring anything with you that you cannot afford to leave on a river bottom (such as a borrowed tent, an heirloom axe, or a pair of designer sunglasses).  Also try to remember that leaving gear on the bottom of the river is a form of pollution.

Canoe camping has one great advantage over backpacking in that you can pack a lot more gear into a canoe than you can into a backpack.  Just don't overdo it.  You will still have to carry everything during the portage.  

Once the canoe is loaded, check its trim - that is, check that the bow and stern are at the same level.  You don't want to have the either end sticking way out of the water, as that will make a canoe &quot;tippy.&quot;

Before leading a group down a river, you should scout it first.  During your scouting trip, you will be looking for hazards and evaluating river conditions.  The trip should answer these questions:
* Are there rapids? 
* Is the least skilled person with you able to navigate them? 
* Is there an easy way to get off the river upstream from the rapid?  
Another important reason to scout the river before bringing the group with you is so that you'll be able to choose the best camping site along the route.  When you're going down for the first time, you might be tempted to settle for a sub-optimal site if you don't know there's a better place around the next bend.

      <text xml:space="preserve">
The CPU (Central Processing Unit) is the 'brain' of the computer.

It's typically a square ceramic package plugged into the motherboard, with a large heat sink on top (and often a fan on top of that).

All instructions the computer will process are processed by the CPU. There are many &quot;CPU architectures&quot;, each of which has its own characteristics and tradeoffs. The dominant CPU architectures used in personal computing are x86 and PowerPC. x86 is easily the most popular processor for this class of machine (the dominant manufacturers of x86 CPUs are Intel and AMD).

== Introduction ==

Most CPUs divide the tasks of interpreting and carrying out the instructions between:
# A control unit that directs program flow and 
# One or more execution units that perform operations on data.  
Almost always, a CPU includes a collection of registers to hold operands and intermediate results.

When every part of a CPU sits on a single physical integrated circuit, one calls it a microprocessor.  Practically all CPUs manufactured today classify as microprocessors.

The term &quot;CPU&quot; often refers&amp;mdash;imprecisely&amp;mdash;to other centrally important parts of a computer, such as caches and I/O controllers, especially when those functions exist on the same microprocessor chip as the CPU. With the arrival of multi-core chips, the term CPU can either mean the physical chip (see the picture) mounted on the motherboard, or it can mean the core within the chip. 

Manufacturers of desktop computers occasionally erroneously describe the entire personal computer (the ''system unit'' or sometimes ''white box'', including the computer case and the computer hardware it contains) as the CPU. Rather, the CPU, as a functional unit, consists of that part of the computer which actually executes the instructions (add, subtract, shift, fetch, etc.).

CPUs contain a small amount of static RAM (SRAM) called a cache. Some processors have two or three levels of cache, containing as much as several megabytes of memory.

== Types of CPUs ==

There are many types of CPU's.Many processor architectures can also be characterized by their CPU design, like register size. Today most desktop computers and laser printers have 32-bit processors. Some 64-bit processors are rapidly becoming more widespread. Smaller devices like mobile phones, PDAs, or portable video game devices may have 16 or 8 bit processors. Embedded systems such as microwave ovens, calculators, computer keyboards, and infrared remote controls typically have 8 bit or 4 bit processors.

== Intel CPUs ==
Intel is currently the most popular CPU choice in personal computing.

Intel has 10+ types of CPU from which a person may choose.

Classic Pentium 
CPU Package = 
MHz/GHz= 60 to 200 MHz 
Slots/Sockets = 

Celeron - SEP, PPGA, FC-PGA, FC-PGA2
Pentium 4 – OOIA/OLGA and FC-PGA2
Itanium – PAC (uses PAC418)
Itanium 2 – PAC (uses PAC611)

=== Sockets 1-7 and Super Socket 7 ===
There are the Pentium OverDrive Processor Sockets for Pentium Processor-based Systems.

=== Socket 4 ===
When you look at socket 4 you may be wondering what it's used for. This socket is used for putting a CPU in. Just like all sockets a CPU is put into it to help the computer process information. This socket needed a voltage of 5 volts. This socket was a 273 pin system, meaning that it needed 273 pins put into it from a CPU chip. The CPU chips that were put into this socket had 273 pins. Socket 4 is old school, meaning this is a very, very old socket that was used during the days of the Classic Pentium 60/66.

Classic Pentium CPUs could go from 60 to 200 MHz. These chips are in the 125+ MHz range. Just look at them closer and you'll be able to tell.

=== Socket 5 ===
Socket 5

Intel Socket 5 Specification

Designation: Socket 5

Number of Pins: 320

Pin Rows: 5 (staggered)

Voltage: 3.3 volts

Motherboard Class: Pentium

Supported Processors: Pentium 75-133 MHz, Pentium OverDrive

Description: Socket 5 is the first socket designed for the mainstream (second generation) Pentium processors. It supports low-speed Pentiums from 75 to 133 MHz. Higher-speed Pentiums such as the 166 MHz and 200 MHz, and the newer Pentiums with MMX, will not work in a Socket 5 because they have an extra pin. They must be used in a Socket 7. Pentium OverDrives to upgrade Socket 5 Pentiums exist to allow upgrades to these motherboards. Socket 5 is now obsolete, replaced by Socket 7.

=== Socket 6 ===
Intel Socket 6 Specification

Designation: Socket 6

Number of Pins: 235

Pin Rows: 4

Voltage: 3.3 volts

Motherboard Class: 486

Supported Processors: 486DX4, Pentium OverDrive

Description: Socket 6 is the last 486 class socket standard created by Intel. It is a slightly modified Socket 3, and it never caught on in the marketplace. Presumably, with Intel discontinuing the 486 line of processors, motherboard manufacturers did not see any need to incur the cost of changing their designs from the Socket 3 standard. Socket 6 is not used in modern motherboards.

=== Socket 7 ===
Socket 7 is a 321-pin Zero Insertion Force processor socket and is a superset of the previous 320-pin Socket 5. (1)

The ZIF socket was designed so that the average computer user could upgrade the CPU. It supported Pentium and Pentium MMX processors up to 233 MHz.

=== SECC ===
(SECC) Single Edge Contact Cartridge.
The card has a single edge which is put into a slot. This slot could be Slot 1, Slot 2, and even Slot A.

Each card that goes into a slot is different.
SECC card are covered with a plastic black housing. They have a fan and a heatsink that is attached to its housing.

The difference between a SECC card and a SECC-2 (Single Edge Contact Cartridge 2) card is that the SECC-2 card does not use a fan or a heatsink. This is why when you have a SECC-2 card in your computer, you should put in a fan to help it recover from the heat it will generate. The reason the SECC-2 card is called SECC-2 is because it is the second version of SECC. 

The SECC-2 card uses Slot 1. Slot 1, also known as SC242, is a connector with 242 contacts. This Slot-type connector is used to attach SECCs that have Pentium III processors onboard and attached to them.

=== Socket 370 ===
Sometimes the motherboard doesn't allow for the PPGA Processor to be put directly onto the main board. Thus, a slocket is needed to be put into a slot on the mother board and have the PPGA put into its Socket 370 adaptation section. PPGA Processors from Intel fit onto a slocket that goes into Slot 1. 370 is the number of pins on the PPGA Celerons. The PPGA Celerons have 370 pins, this is why it goes into a &quot;Socket 370&quot;. In case you're still stumped, the Socket 370 only allows 370 pins to be inserted into it.

SSA stands for: Slot-to-Socket Adapter

=== FC-PGA ===
FC-PGA (Flip Chip Pin Grid Array) CPUs can be installed onto the slocket just like a PPGA CPU can however they need a specific slocket of their own. FC-PGA CPUs also have 370 pins.

The side about FC-PGAs is that you can put a cooler onto them.

External Links for PPGA and FC-PGA:
http://www.intel.com/design/quality/celeron/ppga/integration.htm

=== Socket PAC418 ===
Is used for Itanium CPU.

=== Socket 423 ===
Is used for Pentium 4 CPU.

=== Socket 478 ===
Is used for Pentium 4 and Celeron CPU.

=== Socket 603 ===
Socket 603 takes PGA CPU.

=== Socket 775 ===
LGA (Land Grid Array) Socket type, not using Pins anymore,
Intel Celeron D, Intel Pentium 4,  Intel EE, Intel Pentium D, Intel Core 2 Duo/Extreme CPUs

== AMD CPUs ==

[[Image:AMDK61.jpg|200px]]  [[Image:AMDK61a.jpg|200px]]

(Note: The above photos are an AMD K6 300MHZ processor similar to the description below however operates at a slightly lower voltage and is prior to the K6-2)

The above is a first version of an earlier processor created by AMD called '''AMD-K6-2'''.
The speeds that clocked from this processor are 166 to 500 MHz.
This Processor has 321 pins and takes from 2.5 V to 3.5 V from the power supply to power itself up. This CPU is comparable to a Pentium II or a Intel Celeron Processor.

The above is a picture of the processor called AMD-K6-III. This CPU would be put into Super Socket 7. The processor compares to a Pentium II with a MHz between 350 and 450. This current processor is a 450 MHz model.

=== Slot A ===
AMD's Slot A CPU's were the first attempt at K7. The difference between Athlon and Duron are core capabilities (Duron less cache) and at the end of the Slot A range their voltage requirements and FSB (Front Side Bus) speed as well as what image was used to create them (Barton, ...). They ranged from 400MHz to 1.6GHz. They were favoured at one point by overclockers because to increase the processing speed all you needed was a pencil(until soft speed options came along) and were always faster than the Intel equivalents. All need fans and a large heatsink (some as many as 4 fans) as they throw out heat. The format was dropped by AMD because when the computer boxes were moved, the weight of the heatsink would shift and on occasion break the motherboard - in favour of Socket A.

Slot A processors are not compatible with Slot 1 or Slot 2 motherboards and vice versa.

=== Socket 462/A ===
Is used for AMD Athlon, Duron and Sempron CPUs.

=== Socket 754 ===
AMD Sempron/Athlon 64 CPUs - single memory channel

=== Socket 939 ===
AMD Athlon 64 CPUs - Dual channel memory - chip has 2 on-board memory controllers that work in parallel

=== Socket 940 ===
AMD Opteron CPUs - Primarily for servers, has dual channel memory with error correction, hence the extra pin

=== AM2 AM2+===
Newest socket from AMD (7-4-06) - Supports DDR2 Memory - Very similar to the Socket 940
AM2+ socket supports AMD Quad Core processor, looks the same visually as AM2

== Chipsets ==

The chipset commonly is divided into two devices, the northbridge, and the southbridge. The northbridge is usually the more powerful of the two, and is the closer chip to the physical CPU.

The northbridge, essentially has a few primary functions. Grabbing/Addressing memory from the RAM, and deploying the contents over the data bus for the CPU to read. The northbridge also controls how much ram can be installed into the system. The other functions is allowing the southbridge and its parts, and the AGP slot to communicate with the CPU. In essence the northbridge acts like sort of a receptionist for the cpu, channeling communication from other parts to communicate directly to the CPU. Today, now that the AGP slot is being phased out, and memory controlers are being implemented directly into CPU cores, the northbridge is becoming marginalized if not completely left out of current designs. One example would be the AMD64 in which the memory functions of the northbridge is now in the CPU core, and there is only a southbridge in the chipset.

The southbridge is another chip in the total chipset. Usually the same size as the northbridge, but further away from the CPU (usually near the BIOS), it controls the communication between various peripheral components. A list of what a common southbridge would control would be, IDE controlers, USB ports, PCI slots, and so on. The southbridge also has many other features, but it depends on the features the board has, since most are embedded into the southbridge.

      <comment>/* SRAM */ Expansion of SDRAM added</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Random Access Memory''' (RAM) is categorized into the following types:

===Types of RAM===
===SRAM===

[[wikipedia:Static_Random_Access_Memory|SRAM]] -- Static Random Access Memory. From the book bag analogy SRAM would mostly relate to a small notepad. One of the major features of SRAM is that it never has to be refreshed so data never changes; also SRAM is faster than DRAM. The major drawback however is price, although chip prices have continued to fall, SRAM is still more expensive than DRAM. The most common area SRAM is implemented in the CPU cache where memory doesn’t need to be refreshed often and speed is a factor, and where small quantities are economical.  Classic Pentiums and 486 CPUs had SRAM on the motherboard.  No memory addresses are assigned in this memory.  The 'S' in [[Wikipedia:SDRAM|SDRAM]] does not mean Static, but Synchronous. SDRAM stands for Synchronous Dynamic RAM.

===DRAM===

[[Wikipedia:Dynamic_random_access_memory|DRAM]] -- Dynamic Random Access Memory.  In the book bag analogy, DRAM would be scratch paper. DRAM is the primary memory used in computers today.  The advantage of DRAM is that it is very dense, more and more memory is being crammed into chips every day, and getting cheaper at the same time. The main disadvantage is that it is slower, and has to be refreshed often. Today the most common found ram is [[Wikipedia:SDRAM|SDRAM]], Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory.  The now more common variant of SDRAM is DDR which allows two times the data to be moved in a single cycle, and has dual channel ability. A less common, and now rarely used type of DRAM is [[Wikipedia:RDRAM|RDRAM]] created by Rambus. Although faster than DDR, the industry decided to use DDR due to licensing issues and overall cost. 

===VRAM===

Video RAM memory is not used as much today as it once was due to the fact that most PC comes with integrated graphics that uses system ram to store display information.  Most high-end 
video graphics cards contain VRAM.  VRAM deals with only the display of the bitmap 
graphics.  It can be read and manipulated at the same time, making it faster than 
ordinary RAM. Because of these enhancements, they are extremely expensive and thus most integrated graphics do not come with VRAM.

===RAM Form Factors===
RAM comes in many forms; the certification test has questions on legacy and current ram form factors. The following list of form factors have been used in the past:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Name || Rate || Description
|-
| FPM (Fast Page Mode) || || A &quot;row&quot; of DRam can be kept open by multiple reads or writes, making bursts of data faster. 
|-
| EDO (Extended Data Out) || || Begins data output on falling edge of /CAS. 
|-
| SDRAM (Synchronous Dynamic RAM) || 
|-
| RDRAM (Rambus Dynamic RAM) || || This type also requires a RAMBUS Continuity-RIMM, a terminator or dummy.
|-
| DDR (Double Data Rate SDRAM) || 100 MHz - 200 MHz (PC-1600 -&gt; PC3200) ||
|-
| DDR2 || 100 MHz - 266 MHz (PC2-3200 -&gt; PC2-8600) ||
|-
| DDR3 || 100 MHz - 200MHz (PC-6400 -&gt; PC3-12800) ||
|}

Graphics card memory is permanently attached to the graphics card.

===Memory Modes===
* [[Wikipedia:Real_mode|Real Mode]] is the main mode that was used in early PCs, it is still used today, during booting on a normal 32-bit pc. When windows starts, protected mode kicks in, and real mode is turned off. Real mode was introduced with the 16-bit 286 processor, in real mode, 1 Megabyte of memory could be addressed at most.

* [[Wikipedia:Protected_mode|Protected Mode]] is another mode that was introduced with the 286, allowing ***, protected mode mostly turned on when the operating system is loaded on the system. Protected mode when introduced was only exploited on windows 3.0 and up, however, other OSes also use protected mode. The main function of this mode is to give the ability to break the 1 MB barrier, and allow more memory to be addressed by the computer. Protected mode has changed sinced its initial introduction on the 286, on the 386 for instance, there was 'standard' and 'enhanced', standard allowed up to 16 bits to be addressed, while enhanced allowed 32 bits to be addressed.

===Memory Area===
* [[Wikipedia:Conventional memory]]
* [[Wikipedia:High memory area]]
* [[Wikipedia:eXtended Memory Specification]] (XMS)

== Buses ==

[[:w:Control Bus|Control Bus]]:
The physical connections that carry control information between the CPU and other devices within the computer. Whereas the data bus carries actual data that is being processed, the control bus carries signals that report the status of various devices. For example, one line of the bus is used to indicate whether the CPU is currently reading from or writing to main memory. (Webopedia.com)

[[Wikipedia:Data_bus|Data bus]]

=== Bus Architecture ===

[[Wikipedia:Industry_Standard_Architecture|Industry Standard Architecture (ISA)]]
This architecture was originally used in the IBM PC/XT and PC/AT used for connecting peripheral devices. It has been made obsolete by PCI.

[[Wikipedia:Peripheral_Component_Interconnect|Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI)]]
Developed by Intel Corporation. It is a standard for local bus. It has a throughput rate of 133MBps.

[[Wikipedia:Accelerated_Graphics_Port|Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP)]]
A standard for 3-D graphic interfaces. Its first incarnation had a bandwidth of 266MBps with 2x, 4x, and 8x versions later following. The x is how many times 266MBps set bandwidth is (2x would be 533MBps, etc.). AGP ports are still common but are quickly being made obsolete by [[PCI Express]].

      <comment>/* IRQ Numbers */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Interrupt Requests (IRQ) are hardware lines which devices can send interrupt signals to the CPU.  When a new device is added to a PC an IRQ number should be set manually by using a [[Wikipedia:DIP_Switch|DIP switch]].  This specifies which interrupt line the device may use.  IRQ conflicts used to be a common problem before Plug-and-Play.

===IRQ Numbers===

*IRQ0: The interrupt reserved interrupt for the internal system timer.  Used exclusively for internal operations this is not available to peripherals or other devices.  A conflict on this interrupt indicates a hardware problem on the system board.
*IRQ1: This interrupt is used only for the keyboard/keyboard controller.  A conflict on this interrupt indicates a hardware problem on the system board.
*IRQ2: This interrupt is a cascade for IRQs 8 to 15 allowing the use of extra IRQs 8 to 15.  When used as a linkage between the two interrupt controllers, this means that IRQ2 is no longer available for typical use. Conflicts on this line come from trying to use a device on IRQ2 and another on IRQ9 at the same time.
*IRQ3: This interrupt is used for COM2 and COM4 (second serial port and fourth serial port). It is a popular option for modems and sound cards. Modems often come pre-configured to use COM2 on IRQ3. Conflicts are common on IRQ3. The two biggest problem areas are:  modems that attempt to use COM2/IRQ3 and clash with the built-in COM2 port, and second systems that attempt to use both COM2 and COM4 simultaneously on the same interrupt line. The problem can be avoided by changing the conflicting device to a different interrupt.
*IRQ4: This interrupt is used for COM1 and COM3 (first and third serial port). This is also an option for modems, sound cards, and other devices. Conflicts are somewhat common on this interrupt, the biggest problems being modems that attempt to use COM3 and clash with COM1 and systems that try to use COM1 and COM3 at the same time on the same interrupt line.
*IRQ5: This interrupt is usually used for LPT2 (second parallel port) or a sound card. This interrupt is commonly the only free interrupt below IRQ9 and is the first choice for devices that would conflict with other IRQs.
*IRQ6: This interrupt is most commonly used by a floppy disk controller. Conflicts arise from an incorrectly configured peripheral card.
*IRQ7: This interrupt is usually used by LPT1 (first parallel port) which is typically used for printers. The most common conflicts arise if you are using two parallel ports and they both try to use IRQ7, but this is unusual.
*IRQ8: This interrupt is a reserved interrupt used only for the real-time clock timer. The timer is used by software programs to manage events that must be calibrated to real-world time. There is rarely a conflict in this interrupt.
*IRQ9: This interrupt is usually an open IRQ and is most often used by peripherals, specifically network cards. If you are trying to use IRQ2 then you cannot use IRQ9.
*IRQ10: This interrupt is typically used by network cards, sound cards, SCSI host adapters, secondary IDE channels, and PCI devices. This is one of the easiest IRQs to use because it is rarely contested by other devices.
*IRQ11: This interrupt can be used by network cards, sound cards, SCSI host adapters, secondary IDE channels, and PCI devices. This line is usually open and is usually not contested by many devices.
*IRQ12: This interrupt is typically used by a PS/2 mouse, but can also be used by network cards, sound cards, SCSI host adapters, VGA video cards, and PCI devices. Not contested by many devices.
*IRQ13: This interrupt is a reserved interrupt for the math coprocessor. It is used only for internal signaling and is not available for use by peripherals. Because it is a dedicated interrupt line there should never be any conflicts.
*IRQ14: This interrupt is used by the primary hard drive controller. Problems with IRQ14 are rare.
*IRQ15: This interrupt is used by the secondary hard drive controller. Problems result from assigning a peripheral to this interrupt while not disabling the secondary hard drive controller.

== 2014-04-29 refactoring ==

The exercises with the for-loop seems baffling and out of place to me. I didn't remove it myself, but my vote is to omit it. I'm not sure what is going on there, but maybe that's because I don't have imperative programming experience.
[[User:Backfromquadrangle|Backfromquadrangle]] ([[User talk:Backfromquadrangle|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Backfromquadrangle|contribs]]) 18:16, 29 April 2014 (UTC)

:It is a borderline case, but I think they have some worth as a hard exercise at the end of the story arc. I enjoyed them back in 2010, when I went through the book having just a little imperative (and no functional) experience, though I'm not sure if I could handle with the &lt;code&gt;sequence&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;mapM&lt;/code&gt; items. Maybe different wording would help? Also, I don't like the first bonus item much (the one that asks you to guess one particular wrong implementation).--[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Duplode|contribs]]) 09:09, 30 April 2014 (UTC)

:P.S.: Good call on increasing the pace of the chapter. Given the many historical accidents this book was subject to, there are parts written for (and by!) different audiences. If we manage to make them somewhat more uniform the book will look much tidier.--[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Duplode|contribs]]) 09:09, 30 April 2014 (UTC)</text>

      <comment>/* Comparisons */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Microprocessor Design}}

For a number of reasons, it can be important to export a number of status codes from the ALU, for detecting errors, and for making decisions. 

== Comparisons ==

Comparisons between two values are typically performed by subtracting them. We can determine the relationship between the two values by examining the difference:
*If the first is larger than the second, the result will be positive
*If the second is larger than the first, the result will be negative
*If the two are equal, the result will be zero.

== Zero Flag ==

Determining whether two values are equal requires the ALU to determine whether the result is zero. This can be accomplished by feeding each bit of the result into a NOR gate. The beauty of this is that a single multi-port NOR gate requires less hardware than an entire array of equivalent 2-port gates.

== Overflow Flag ==

It is good to know when the result of an addition or multiplication is larger than the maximum result size. Likewise, it is also good to know if the result of a subtraction or a division is smaller than possible, and thus creates underflow. Either two separate flags can be used for these conditions, or one flag can be interpreted in different ways, depending on the input operation.

== Carry/Borrow flag ==
This flag indicates when an operation results in a value larger than the accumulator can represent (carry/overflow) or smaller than the accumulator can represent (borrow/underflow).  It can be used by software to implement arbitrary-width arithmetic, such as a &quot;bignum&quot; library.
&lt;!-- note to self: add reference to x86 asm textbook --&gt;

== Comparisons ==

Many ALUs need to compare data items, and determine if a particular value is greater than or less than another value. In these cases, the ALU will also export flags for these values.

A comparison in a processor can typically be performed by a subtraction operation. If the result is a positive number, the first item is greater than the second item. If the result is a negative number, the first item is less than the second. If the numbers being compared are unsigned, the value of the carry flag will serve the same purpose as the greater-than or less-than flag.

== Latch ALU flags or not? ==

Some instruction sets refer to the ALU flags from some previous instruction:
  CMP R1,R2 // compare
  ...
  BEQ equal_routine // branch if equal

Such instruction sets force the CPU designer to latch those ALU flags in some sort of &quot;status register&quot;, and to be very careful to make sure it is possible to preserve those flags during an interrupt routine.

Other instruction sets never refer to previous ALU flags -- they always use the results from the ALU in the same instruction that they are calculated:
  BEQ R1,R2,equal_routine // compare and branch if equal
or
  SKEQ R1,R2 // compare and skip next instruction if equal
    JMP equal_routine

Some CPU designers prefer such instruction sets that never refer to previous ALU flags.
Such instruction sets make out-of-order execution much simpler.
Many of Chuck Moore's CPU designs never refer to the ALU flags from any previous instruction.</text>

== How many people use sign language? ==
Sign languages are primarily used by people who are deaf or hard of hearing.  Many other people learn sign language in order to be able to communicate easily with family members or friends that are deaf or hard of hearing.  Sign languages may also be learned in order to be an official sign language interpreter.

== What writing system(s) does this language use? ==
Sign languages are not written as often as other languages, instead written forms of other languages are used. For example, someone that communicates using American sign language would usually read and write written English. Many sign languages do however, have their own specific written form.
&lt;!--''video, webcam''
''SMS using the spoken language, i.e. French texting from an LSF speaker''
What are these? --&gt;

==What is the history of sign language?==

== Are sign languages really languages? ==

Yes!  Sign languages have all of the important features that other languages have that make them languages.  For example, they have their own grammar, phonemes, and use of inflection.

{{{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/Define|phomeme|one of the basic sounds (or in this case, ''parts'') out of which words are made.}}

{{{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/Define|inflection|the way words change form to show things like singular/plural or past/present/future.}}

== Is sign language universal? ==

Sometimes when communicating with somebody who doesn't speak the same language as you, you can get your point across by acting things out and making signs with your hands.  Does this mean that sign language is universal?  Not quite.  Just as there are many spoken languages, there are many signed languages (for example, American Sign Language and French Sign Language).  Interestingly, signed languages have a different history than spoken ones.  For example, American Sign Language is much closer to French Sign Language than it is to British Sign Language!

Also, since sign languages tend to mix a lot of miming and acting along with the actual language, deaf people often have an easier time making themselves understood with other deaf people, even if they don't &quot;speak&quot; the same language.  This also helps them to learn each other's languages.  So deaf people might have an easier time communicating across the language barrier even if their respective languages are very different.

==Where are sign languages used?==
Sign languages are used all over the world. There are many official sign languages that have significant numbers of speakers.  Even where official sign languages are not known (and even where they are), &quot;home sign&quot; develops where speakers communicate with signs that make sense between the speakers.

== How much does sign language differ from spoken language? ==

What makes sign languages interesting is that they are often very different from spoken languages, even in the same countries or communities.  For example, in American English, we might say, &quot;When are you going to school?&quot;, whereas in French Sign Language, we would instead sign something like &quot;When you school go when?&quot; 

Learning a sign language is really like learning a second language, not just learning signs for the words you already know. In the same way, translating a sign language to a spoken language involves accounting for grammar differences in much the same way that translating from one spoken language to another does.

==Who are some famous authors or poets in this language?==
[[w:Clayton Valli|Clayton Valli]] (1951—2003) was a prominent deaf linguist and American Sign Language (ASL) poet whose work helped further to legitimize ASL and introduce people to the richness of American Sign Language literature.

==What are some basic words in this language that I can learn?==
==What is a simple song/poem/story that I can learn in this language?==

      <text xml:space="preserve">AROS Application Packages are presently only a basis for &quot;per application&quot; management.

It is the AROS Devs intentions to be able to provide a proper package file for installing/updating/distributing software at some time in the future of AROS.

==Environment Variable Settings==

Installed Packages have an Environment variable in ENV:SYS/Packages which points to the location in which they are installed.

i.e.:

AROSTCP's env variable is ENV:SYS/Packages/AROSTCP and contains &quot;SYS:Extras/Networking/Stacks/AROSTCP&quot; by default - the normal install location from the AROS ISO.

Other Packages should use the same convention for their environment variables - ENV:SYS/Packages/&lt;Package Name&gt;

==Package Control Files==

Inside the drawer the package is installed to you will find a script (&quot;s/&quot;) folder.

This contains scripts which are used to perform startup/cleanup functions for packages.

currently there are the following files

;   PackageStartup
:This script is run during boot to perform actions necessary to make the package available for use.
:It may perform normal script operations just as code that gets inserted into startup-sequence/user-startup however it is easier to control its use on a package basis if done using these scripts.
                   
;   PackageShutdown
:This script is used to close down a package completely.  It should undo all things performed in PackageStartup if necessary

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
'''SWF''' is a proprietary software vector graphics file format produced by the Macromedia Flash software from Adobe Systems (formerly Macromedia). Intended to be small enough for publication on the web, SWF files can contain animations or applets of varying degrees of interactivity and function. SWF is also sometimes used for creating animated display graphics and menus for DVD movies, and television commercials. 

The Flash program produces SWF files as a compressed and uneditable final product, whereas it uses the .fla format for its editable working files.

The name is a backronym of sorts, standing for '''Small Web Format''' and '''Shockwave Flash'''. According to Macromedia, SWF is pronounced &quot;S W F&quot; (with each letter being pronounced individually), but some people prefer to pronounce it as &quot;swiff&quot;. A file of this format is called a Shockwave Flash Object.

SWF is currently the dominant format for displaying animated vector graphics on the web, far exceeding the W3C open standard Scalable Vector Graphics, which has met with problems over competing implementations. (Source: Wikipedia)

&lt;h2&gt;Handling SWF files in DVX&lt;/h2&gt;
If you got here, you probably did not get the texts for your Flash animation handed in Word. Instead the client gave you an SWF file, which means that the client wants you to act both as a translator and a web designer. It is important that you realize this.&lt;p&gt;

Also important to realize is that SWF files are actually derived from FLA files. Therefore you should always try to work from the original [[CAT-Tools/DéjàVu X/FLA format|FLA format]] instead. There are two exceptions, which are SWF files which have been specifically prepared for localization (see 'When to localize from SWF' below) and SWF files that are used to feed DVX with the source text (see 'When to decompile SWF back to FLA' below). 

&lt;h3&gt;When to localize from SWF&lt;/h3&gt;
Several websites, amongst which the famous [http://www.necco.ca/dv/ tt4t.net], recommend [http://www.avral.com/tramigo/ Avral's Tramigo] for localizing SWF files. However, this only works if the SWF files actually contain translatable text, which is often not the case.&lt;p&gt;

The problem is that Macromedia Flash, the software in which SWF files are made, allows the user to convert text to non-dynamic (non-editable) formats. As soon as this is done, the actual text itself is not accessible anymore in the generated SWF file - you can then only access it from the original FLA file from which the SWF file was generated. For this you will need the original FLA file and [http://www.adobe.com/products/flash/flashpro/ Macromedia Flash], which comes at a price.&lt;p&gt;

Tramigo can be handy, but only if its usage has been taken into account during the actual development of the SWF files (all translatable text should be dynamic), and not as an afterthought. This means that in the vast majority of the cases, Tramigo won't help you.&lt;p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;When to decompile SWF back to FLA&lt;/h3&gt;
[http://www.sothink.com/product/flashdecompiler/ Sothink's SWF Decompiler] gives much better results. It can extract all texts from the file, because it basically converts SWF files back to their original FLA format, with very good results. SWF Decompiler also has an option for exporting text resources. To import them into DVX, you will need to open hundreds of little text files and manually insert hard enters, but that's still quicker than manually copying and pasting everything to a DVX import document. Unfortunately there's no easy to way to export your translation back. Text in SWF Decompiler cannot be edited, so you will have to open the decompiled FLA files in Macromedia Flash, which only supports old-fashioned copying and pasting.&lt;p&gt;

For a good localization you will need Macromedia Flash anyway, as you will need to resize some of the text boxes to keep the lay-out nice and tight (think Microsoft PowerPoint). For this, you will also need the actual fonts (the price of which can range from several dozens to several thousands of dollars). Which fonts you need depends on the fonts defined in the SWF file. If the used fonts cannot be traced or are too expensive to buy, consult the client about alternative (cheaper) fonts. You could for example opt for Univers if you can't find Lucida Grande (Wikipedia has great information about font families and look-a-likes). Also, some software packages, like CorelDraw, offer many professional fonts for free.&lt;p&gt;

If you want to start localizing SWF files professionally, you should prepare yourself for an extra investment of about 800 USD (for Sothink's SWF Decompiler + Macromedia Flash, excluding fonts). Be prepared to charge at least 150% of your normal rate, as localizing SWF files is a lot of work, no matter which tools you use.

      <text xml:space="preserve">* Never swim alone.  Always swim with a buddy.
* Do not swim unless there are adults present.
* Do not dive into water until you know that it is deep enough and free from debris
* On beaches, rivers, and lakes, wear protective footwear.  This will guard against broken glass, sharp rocks, etc.
* Never pretend to be drowning
* If swimming in an area monitored by a life guard, stay in the life guard's view.
* Do not chew gum or eat food while swimming.
* Stay clear of diving boards.  A diver may not see you.
* Do not engage in horseplay, jump on, or dunk another swimmer.
* Do not run in a pool area.
* Pool areas should be fenced in to keep toddlers out.  Keep the gate closed!
* Obey the rules established for the swimming area.
* Only swim in areas where swimming is allowed.
* If caught in a riptide, swim parallel to shore.  Riptides are narrow, so you should be able to swim out of the current by swimming across it.
* Do not swim out farther than you can swim out.  Remember that you are more tired when you get out there than when you started, so be conservative.  Do not overestimate your abilities.
* Do not swim during stormy weather.
* Do not rely on inflatable toys as life preservers.  If you try to cross a large body of water on an air mattress and it springs a leak, you could be in serious trouble.  Never go farther out on one of these than you can swim back.

You could for example opt for Univers if you can't find Lucida Grande (Wikipedia has great information about font families and look-a-likes). Also, some software packages, like CorelDraw, offer many professional fonts for free.&lt;p&gt;

If you want to start localizing FLA files professionally, you should prepare yourself for an extra investment of about 700 USD (for Macromedia Flash, excluding fonts). Be prepared to charge at least 150% of your normal rate, as localizing FLA files is a lot of work, no matter which tools you use.

Hey, Is there any way that the data could be sent to a webservice or be sent as POST data to a web page? The method right now is really painfull to work with practically.
I want something so that the XML doc will be part of the POST reponse ... the method=&quot;post&quot; doesn't seem to work although the XForms Draft seems to say it should. I did method=&quot;post&quot; and action=&quot;form.php&quot; where form.php iterates over all its post elements. But no elements were found . GET workd fine.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Consistency of units ==

Most values that you'll run across as an engineer will consist of a number and a unit. Some do not have a unit because they are a pure number (like pi, π) or a ratio.  In order to solve a problem effectively, all the types of units should be consistent with each other, or should be in the same ''system''. A system of units defines each of the basic unit types with respect to some measurement that can be easily duplicated, so that, for example, 5 ft. is the same length in Australia as it is in the United States. There are five commonly-used base unit types or ''dimensions'' that one might encounter (shown with their abbreviated forms for the purpose of dimensional analysis):

:'''Length''' (L), or the physical distance between two positions with respect to some standard distance
:'''Time''' (t), or how long something takes with respect to how long some natural phenomenon takes to occur
:'''Mass''' (M), a measure of the inertia of a material relative to that of a standard
:'''Temperature''' (T), a measure of the average kinetic energy of the molecules in a material relative to a standard
:'''Electric Current''' (E), a measure of the total charge that moves in a certain amount of time

'''Note:''' It would make more commonsense to have '''Electric Charge''' as a base unit, since current is charge per time, and you may find it convenient to think of charge as the fundamental unit.  However, current proved easier to measure very accurately and reproducibly, so the physicists decided it would be their reference.

There are several different consistent systems of units.  In most of the world (apart from the US and to some extent the UK) the SI system is standard.  It is also used in refereed scientific and engineering journals in these two countries.  In practice, it is essential for a chemical engineer to be proficient in the SI system, but to be able to use data in units of other systems and to be able to specify designs in the preferred unit system for the job.

=== Units of Common Physical Properties===

Every system of units has a large number of ''derived'' units which are, as the name implies, derived from the base units. These new units are based on the physical definitions of other quantities and involve the combination of different variables. Below is a list of several common derived system properties and the corresponding dimensions (&lt;math&gt;\dot=&lt;/math&gt; denotes unit equivalence). If you don't know what one of these properties is, you will learn it eventually:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

| [[wikipedia:Mass|Mass]] || M || [[wikipedia:Length|Length]] || L
|-
| [[wikipedia:Time|Time]] || t || [[wikipedia:Temperature|Temperature]] || T
|-

|-

|-

|-

|}

=== SI (kg-m-s) System ===

This is the most commonly-used system of units in the world, and is based heavily on factors of 10. It was originally based on the properties of water, though currently there are more precise standards in place. The major dimensions are:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Dimension name !! SI unit !! SI abbreviation
|-
| Length || meter || m
|-
| Time || second || s
|-
| Mass || kilogram || kg
|-
| Temperature || kelvin || K
|-
| Electric Current || ampere || A
|-
| Amount of substance || mole || mol
|}

Note that the kilogram, not the gram, is a base unit.

The close relationship to water is that one m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of water weighs (approximately) 1000 kg.

A base unit that can be difficult to understand is the ''mole''. A mole represents 6.022*10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; particles of ''any substance''. (The number is known as Avogadro's Number, or the [[wikipedia:Avogadro constant|Avogadro constant]].) This usually means the number of atoms or molecules of an element or compound.  Chemical engineers commonly use kilomoles.
The relative molecular mass (= molecular weight) of water H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O is about 18, being made up of 2 H atoms (atomic mass = 1) and one O atom (atomic mass = 16). Thus 18 kilograms of water constitute 1 kilomole of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and contain 2 kilomoles of H atoms and 1 kilomole of O atoms.

Each of these base units can be made smaller or larger in units of ten by adding the appropriate '''metric prefixes'''. The specific meanings are (from the [[w:SI|SI]] page on Wikipedia): 

{{SIUnits}}

If you see a length of 1 km, according to the chart, the prefix &quot;k&quot; means there are 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of something, and the following &quot;m&quot; means that it is meters. So 1 km = 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; meters. There should always be a space between the number and the unit and between different units which are multiplied together.  There must not be a space between the multiplier and the unit.  Thus 13 mA means 13 milliamps, but 13 m A means 13 meter-amps.

As noted above, the kilogram is a base unit, but the multipliers are added to the gram.  1000 kg = 1 Mg; 0.001 kg = 1 g.

In chemical engineering practice, we tend not to use the very large or small ends of the
table, but you should know at least as large as mega (M), and as small as nano (n). The relationship between different sizes of metric units was deliberately made simple because you will have to do it all of the time. You may feel uncomfortable with it at first if you're from the U.S. but trust me, after working with the English system you'll learn to appreciate the simplicity of the Metric system.

==== Derived units in the SI system ==== 

Imagine if every time you calculated a pressure, you would have to write the units in kg/(m s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). This would become cumbersome quickly, so the SI people set up '''derived units''' to use as shorthand for such combinations as these.  Note that units named after a person do not start with a capital letter, but the abbreviation does!  For example &quot;a force of one newton&quot; and &quot; a force of 1.0 N&quot;. The most common ones used by chemical engineers are as follows:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Property name !! Long SI Units !! SI Name !! SI Abbreviation !! Equivalencies
|-
| Force || &lt;math&gt; \frac{kg*m}{s^2} &lt;/math&gt; || newton || N || Mass * acceleration
|-
| Energy || &lt;math&gt; \frac{kg*m^2}{s^2} &lt;/math&gt; || joule || J || &lt;math&gt; N*m &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; Pa*m^3 &lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Power || &lt;math&gt; \frac{kg*m^2}{s^3} &lt;/math&gt; || watt || W || &lt;math&gt; \frac{N*m}{s} &lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt; \frac{J}{s} &lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Pressure || &lt;math&gt; \frac{kg}{m*s^2} &lt;/math&gt; || pascal || Pa || &lt;math&gt; \frac{N}{m^2} &lt;/math&gt;
|}


==== Allowed units in the SI system ==== 

Some units are not simply derived from the base units or regular multiples, but are in common use and are therefore permitted.  Thus, though periods of time can be expressed in kiloseconds or megaseconds, we are allowed to use minutes, hours and days.  The term 'liter' (US) or 'litre' (European) is understood to be the same as 1 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, and the term tonne (not ton) is understood to be the same as 1000 kg.  The bar is a unit of pressure meaning 100 kPa, which is very close to the chemists' standard atmosphere (which is 101.325 kPa). The Celsius scale of temperature is understood to be the number of kelvin above 273.15 K.  Thus we are allowed to write &quot;the chemical reactor has a throughput of 4.3 tonnes per day at 5 bar and 200 °C&quot; and we will be understood.  However, it may be necessary to change to base or derived units in order to carry out calculations.


=== cgs (cm-g-s) system ===

This was the first metric system and may be found old publications (before 1960).  There is no reason why a chemical engineer should work in it today, but you may have to convert data from old books.  The base units of length and mass were the centimeter and gram.  The unit of force was a ''dyne''; the unit of energy was an ''erg''. The value of ''g'', the standard acceleration due to gravity was 981 cm/s/s.  The viscosity units poise (especially centipoise, cP) and stokes (especially centistokes cSt) are a hangover from this system and may be found in relatively recent publications.  You should convert them to SI.

Note that chemists often work with grams and cubic centimeters, but these are part of SI.  Just because you work with cm, g, and s, does not mean you are using the cgs system.
See [[w:cgs]] if you really want to know.

=== British, Imperial or American (gravitational) system ===

This system was established with the authority of the British Empire.  It is known in Britain as the Imperial system, in America as the British (sometimes English) system, and in much of the world as the American system, since the USA is the only major market for chemical engineering which uses it. The engineering version uses a subset of this traditional or customary measure plus the ''pound force'' and the ampere.

Its peculiarity lies in the relationship between force and mass. According to Isaac Newton for a fixed mass accelerating under the influence of a force:

force = mass x acceleration     or    ''f = m a''

In the SI system a force of 1 newton acting on a mass of 1 kilogram produces an acceleration of 1 meter per second.  Simple!

In the Imperial system a force of 1 pound-force acting on a mass of 1 pound produces an acceleration of 32 feet per second per second.  This is because this is the natural acceleration under gravity. Older American books often include a ''g'' in the formula which do not appear in European versions of the same equation.  The ''g'' represents the relationship between force and mass in the unit system (which is 1 in SI): here it is 32.  For a while, American (mainly) engineers used a version of the metric system including the kilogram-force and thus ''g'', which had the value 9.81. Physicists call these both ''gravitational'' systems.

The common units are based on traditional measures which were practical in agriculture and shipping, and do not go in steps of 10, 100, 1000 etc.  Instead of using prefixes you use names for larger units, and can use combinations of units for the same dimension, e.g. 6 yards 2 feet and 8 and a quarter inches ( 6 yd 2 ft 8¼ in)  However, engineers tend to use one unit and a decimal, e.g. 20.7 ft, e.g. 13.47 in.  The foot can also be denoted by a single mark and the inch by a double mark, e.g. 4 feet 7 inches was 4' 7&quot;.  Note that the US gallon is smaller than the Imperial gallon (5/6 in fact), when you are doing conversions to SI.

The temperature scale is that of Fahrenheit, in which the melting point of ice is 32 °F.  Absolute zero is -459.67 °F.  For thermodynamic temperatures, the number of degrees Fahrenheit above absolute zero is the Rankine scale.  Thus the melting point of ice is 459.67 °R.

The following are common units in this system. 

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Dimension name !! Imperial unit !! Imperial abbreviation
|-
| Length || foot, inch || ft, in
|-
| Time || second, minute, or hour || sec, min, and hr, respectively
|-
| Force || pound-force || &lt;math&gt; lb_f &lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Temperature || degree Fahrenheit || °F
|-
| Electric current || ampere|| A
|}

A common derived unit is the pound(-force) per square inch, or psi.  Note that psig or psi(g) means psi above atmospheric pressure. Energy is measured in British Thermal Units, generally BTU, sometimes B.Th U.  Power is horsepower, hp.

===&quot;Parts-per&quot; notation===
The &quot;parts-per&quot; notation is a unit that deals with very small traces of species within a mixture of gases or liquids. Parts-per million (ppm) and parts-per billion (ppb), as well as parts-per trillion (ppt) (American definition of trillion 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;), refer to mass or mole ratios and communicate how many parts of the species are present-per million, billion, or trillion parts of the mixture. Generally mass ratios are used when dealing with liquids and mole ratios are used when dealing with gases, though either kind of ratio can be used for whichever phase a chemical is in (ratios are discussed in a later chapter).

{{example| Let's say the air around us contains 20 ppm He (Helium). 

This means that, if one assumes that a molar basis is being used, for every '''million''' moles of air there are 20 moles of Helium. If the example was in terms of ''ppb'', this would mean that for every '''billion''' moles of air there are 20 moles of Helium.}}

=== A Word About Conversions ===
It is generally safe to convert all data into SI then work your calculations out in that system, converting back if necessary at the end.  If you are skilled enough in the American system, you may be able to carry some calculations within that system. 
It is best to consult a conversion table or program for the necessary changes and especially important to keep good track of the units.  

However, do not make the mistake of just writing down the numbers you get from the calculator or program.

For example, if you have a pressure drop in a pipe of 16 psi, and the conversion factor 1 psi = 6.895 kPa, your calculator will give 16 x 6.895 = 110.32.  However, your answer should be 110 kPa because your starting value was only given to a precision of two figures.  The conversion factor cannot add accuracy!

''If every value is written in terms of the same base units, and the equation that is used is correct, then the units of the answer will be consistent and in terms of the same base units.''

== How to convert between units ==

=== Finding equivalences ===

The first thing you need in order to convert between units is the equivalence between the units you want and the units you have. To do this use a '''conversion table'''. See [[w:Conversion of units]] for a fairly extensive (but not exhaustive) list of common units and their equivalences.

Conversions within the metric system usually are not listed, because it is assumed that one can use the prefixes and the fact that 
&lt;math&gt; 1 \mbox{ mL} = 1 \mbox{ cm}^3 &lt;/math&gt; to convert anything that is desired.

Conversions within the English system and especially between the English and metric system are sometimes (but not on Wikipedia) written in the form:

&lt;math&gt;1 (unit 1) = (number) (unit 2) = (number) (unit 3) = .... &lt;/math&gt;

For example, you might recall the following conversion from chemistry class:

&lt;math&gt; 1 \mbox{ atm} = 760 \mbox{ mmHg} = 1.013*10^5 \mbox{ Pa} = 1.013 \mbox{ bar} = ....&lt;/math&gt;

The table on Wikipedia takes a slightly different approach: the column on the far left side is the unit we have 1 of, the middle is the definition of the unit on the left, and on the far right-hand column we have the metric equivalent. One listing is the conversion from feet to meters:

&lt;math&gt; \mbox{ foot (International)  ft}  = 1/3 \mbox{ yd}  = 0.3048\mbox{ m} &lt;/math&gt;

Both methods are common and one should be able to use either to look up conversions.

=== Using the equivalences ===

Once the equivalences are determined, use the general form: 

{{box|
&lt;math&gt; \mbox{What you want} = \mbox{What you have} * \frac{\mbox{What you want}}{\mbox{What you have}} &lt;/math&gt;}}

The fraction on the right comes directly from the conversion tables. 

{{example|
Convert 800 mmHg into bars

'''Solution''' If you wanted to convert 800 mmHg to bars, using the horizontal list, you could do it directly:

&lt;math&gt; bars = 800\mbox{ mmHg}*\frac{1.013\mbox{ bar}}{760\mbox{ mmHg}} = 1.066\mbox{ bar} &lt;/math&gt;

Using the tables from Wikipedia, you need to convert to an ''intermediate'' (the metric unit) and then convert from the intermediate to the desired unit. We would find that 

&lt;math&gt; 1 \mbox{ mmHg}=133.322\mbox{ Pa} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;1\mbox{ bar}=10^5\mbox{ Pa}&lt;/math&gt;

Again, we have to set it up using the same general form, just we have to do it twice:

&lt;math&gt; bars = 800\mbox{ mmHg}*\frac{133.322\mbox{ Pa}}{1\mbox{ mmHg}}*\frac{1\mbox{ bar}}{10^5\mbox{ Pa}} = 1.066\mbox{ bar}&lt;/math&gt;}}

Setting these up takes practice, there will be some examples at the end of the section on this. It's a '''very important''' skill for any engineer.

One way to keep from avoiding &quot;doing it backwards&quot; is to write everything out and make sure your units cancel out as they should! If you try to do it backwards you'll end up with something like this:

&lt;math&gt; bars = 800\mbox{ mmHg}*\frac{760\mbox{ mmHg}}{1.013\mbox{ bar}} =  6.0*10^5 \frac{{mmHg}^2}{bar}&lt;/math&gt;

If you write everything (even conversions within the metric system!) out, and make sure that everything cancels, you'll help mitigate unit-changing errors. About 30-40% of all mistakes I've seen have been unit-related, which is why there is such a long section in here about it. Remember them well.

== Dimensional analysis as a check on equations ==

Since we know what the units of velocity, pressure, energy, force, and so on should be in terms of the base units
L, M, t, T, and E, we can use this knowledge to check the feasibility of equations that involve these quantities. 

{{example|Analyze the following equation for dimensional consistency:
&lt;math&gt;P = g*h &lt;/math&gt;
where g is the gravitational acceleration and h is the height of the fluid

'''Solution''' We could check this equation by plugging in our units:

&lt;math&gt;P \dot= M/(L*t^2) \mbox{ , } h \dot= L \mbox{ , } g \dot= L/t^2 &lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;g * h \dot= L^2/t^2 \neq M/(L*t^2) &lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt;

Since g*h doesn't have the same units as P, the equation must be wrong ''regardless of the system of units we are using!'' The correct equation, in fact, is:

&lt;math&gt; P = \rho*g*h &lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; \rho &lt;/math&gt; is the density of the fluid. Density has base units of &lt;math&gt; M/L^3&lt;/math&gt; so 

&lt;math&gt; \rho*g*h \dot= M/L^3 * L^2/t^2 \dot= M/(L*t^2)&lt;/math&gt; which are the units of pressure. &lt;br&gt;

This does not tell us the equation is correct but it ''does'' tell us that the units are consistent, which is necessary though not sufficient to obtain a correct equation. ''This is a useful way to detect algebraic mistakes that would otherwise be hard to find.'' The ability to do this with an algebraic equation is a good argument against plugging in numbers too soon! }}

You may well be forced to do dimensional analysis in chemical engineering classes or if you do research.  For much of the rest of the time, you will probably find it easier to check the units, particularly if you are using the SI system.  In the above example, you think:
*Pressure = force / area
*Force = mass x acceleration
*Pressure = mass x acceleration / area
So 1 pascal (unit of pressure) = 1 kg x (m s&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;) / (m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
= 1 kg m&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;

*Now ''g'' is 9.81 m s&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; and ''h'' is in meters
*So ''gh'' is in units m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;
To make ''gh'' match pressure we need to multiply by something having the units kg m&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;, which we recognise as density.

Note dimensional analysis (or unit checking) does not tell you about numerical values that you might have to insert, such as 9.81 or π. Nor does it tell you if you should use the radius or the diameter of a pipe in fluid mechanics!

      <text xml:space="preserve">Apart from external causes of buzzing, such as a button on your clothes
vibrating against the cello or even something in the room vibrating in
sympathy as you play, buzzes can be caused by almost any part of the cello.
Below is a list of the most common buzzes and possible causes.


'''Buzzing on only one string'''

•
There may be a loose string winding – if so replace the string.

•
A stopped string may buzz because of an oversized string groove at the
bridge; an open string buzz that disappears when the string is stopped
suggests an oversized string groove at the nut


'''Buzzing only on certain notes'''

Your fingerboard may be uneven and the strings may catch on the bumps when
you stop certain notes. If so, ask a luthier to smooth (‘true’ or ‘re-shoot’) the
fingerboard for you.


'''Intermittent buzzing'''

Buzzes caused by loose purfling or open seams can disappear in damp weather
and reappear in dryer weather as the glue softens and hardens. If in doubt,
consult a luthier.


'''Other common causes of buzzing'''

•
The end of the tail-gut is buzzing against the tailpiece

•
Fingerboard is coming unglued

•
Loose adjuster – try tightening it down

•
Loose bridge vellums

•
Loose end pin (spike)

•
Loose end of a string buzzing inside the peg box

•
Loose decorations on pegs

•
Loose plastic sleeve bridge protector; either remove it or push it firmly
down over the silk at the bottom of the string

•
Open (unglued or fresh) cracks

•
Poor contact between the bridge feet and cello front

•
Tail-gut vibrating in an over-sized hole in the tailpiece

•
Mute not placed correctly. If you are using a mute, ensure that it is secured.

{{Collaborative Networked Learning: A Guide/TOC}}

Welcome to the [[w:Wiki|wiki]]-based annotated expansion of the  [[Main Page|Wikibook]] for [[w:Collaborative Networked Learning]] approaches developed by  [[w: Findley, Charles A. |C.A. Findley]].  It is organized to provide an overview rationale, guidelines for implementation and facilitation.  

== Where To Start ==

This book is built to handle several different levels of readers who want to understand more about collaborative learning, collaborative networked learning and how to implement collaborative learning in the workplace, ‘’collaborative learning-work.’’ 
Therefore, the book has several pages available that detail suggested reading guides for specific levels of reading:

*[[/Introduction/Beginner|Newcomer]] - Readers who are new to the concept of collaborative learning and the rationale for collaborative networked learning. 
This page should be used by readers who have little knowledge of collaborative learning or or are just interested in a general overview. 
*[[/Introduction/Intermediate|Participant]] - Readers who are actively engaged in collaborative learning and want to improve their practice. 
*[[/Introduction/Advanced|Facilitator and Designer]] - Readers who have studied collaborative learning and are in the process of implementing and designing systems for schools or the workplace.

== Major Sections ==

{{stages}}

*[[/Overview /]] – “CNL Overview and Rationale {{stage short|75%|1 February  2007}}
*[[/Communication Models/]] - ''  Intra-personal and interpersonal communication involves new models of electronic group communication.”

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;h2&gt;Pros&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Superb maintenance of memory/terminology databases&lt;/h3&gt;
Importing/exporting from/to other formats, like CSV files, Excel files, Word files, TMX files, Trados WB files, etc., is an absolute breeze. What makes DVX really different is the fact that you can maintain the databases using SQL. This is for pretty advanced users, but it can be done. [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/CAT-Tools/D%C3%A9j%C3%A0Vu_X/SQL Here] you can read more about using SQL in DVX databases and projects. 
&lt;h3&gt;Support for Windows Vista and Microsoft Office 2007&lt;/h3&gt;
Atril Software says that in February 2007, a new version of DVX will be launched, which will offer full support for Windows Vista and Office 2007.

&lt;h3&gt;Handling hundreds of files at once&lt;/h3&gt;
Contrary to many other tools, DVX was tailored to freelance translators and not project managers. It will actually speed the translation process up, instead of down. A famous example is the fact that in DVX, there is no need to glue and unglue documents using unreliable tools. If you want to import 863 HTML files, 266 Excel files, 287 Word files and 875 txt files in one single project, it can be done. You can then 'switch' between individual files and the whole project with one mouse click. If the text behaves like one project, you can auto-propagate one translation through all 863+266+287+875 files. The same goes for other functions, like sorting, search and replace, etc. Press your mouse button once and you're back at individual file level again. No other TMA can do this, while it is an absolute must for translating larger websites.
&lt;h3&gt;Example Based Machine Translation&lt;/h3&gt;
DéjàVu is probably the only CAT tool offering 
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Example-based_machine_translation Example Based Machine Translation (EBMT)].

Suppose you translated:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
English: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.&lt;br&gt;
Dutch: De snelle vos springt over de luie hond.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
In your Translaton Memory or Dictionary there is an entry for 'very' (Dutch: zeer).

Now you have to translate:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;English: The quick brown fox jumps over the very lazy dog.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;

DéjàVu will note the inserted word 'very' and insert its translation (from the Memory or Dictionary) in the Dutch translation:&lt;br&gt;
 
&lt;i&gt;Dutch: De snelle vos springt over de zeer luie hond.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;AutoAssemble&lt;/h3&gt;
AutoAssemble (AA) is closely related to EBMT. It not only inserts all translations for terms and fragments of text into the target box but also takes care of differences between matching segments stored in the Memory and the segment you are translating.

&lt;h3&gt;Very knowledgeable and helpful user community&lt;/h3&gt;
If you have any problems with or questions about DVX, you can always ask your questions on the main DVX mailing list (http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/dejavu-l/). Before you ask a question, do not forget to check the group’s archive (http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/dejavu-l/msearch_adv) or that other great resource http://www.necco.ca/dv/

&lt;h2&gt;Cons&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Export to RTF for translating Word documents&lt;/h3&gt;
In order to translate documents created in Microsoft Word, these documents have to be converted into the RTF format. This can either be done manually or handled by DéjàVu during import.

Alas the RTF filter that Atril wrote is very slow (compared to e.g. MemoQ's RTF filter) and causes sometimes a lot of trash (codes that break up a word, also known as Rogue Codes).

Another big disadvantage of the RTF conversion is that the position of floating images in (poorly designed) Word documents is lost. The binary Word filter that Transit XV offers, doesn't have this disadvantage (and it is very fast).

First tests with the new docx filter show ... that by handling files with floating images via xml the positions are maintained.

&lt;h3&gt;Alignment&lt;/h3&gt;

Aligning old translations is a tedious and time-consuming process compared with more recent tools such as [[../../Similis|Similis]].

&lt;h3&gt;Mediocre official support&lt;/h3&gt;
The official support for DVX, which used to be among the best in the world (Emilio Benito, the founder of Atril Software, was notorious for answering e-mails sent on Sunday 4:00 AM within 5 minutes), has now unfortunately regressed to be on a par with most other software support services. This is made up, however, by a very knowledgeable user community (this particular website was made by them, too) and actually, for the vast majority of the questions you won't need official support at all.

=Four Knights Game=
This is the classical Four Knights' Game. One of the beginning principles of the opening that the beginners learn is &quot;Knights before bishops&quot;, and thus dogmatic followers of this principle stick to this system. All four knights have been developed (hence the name), leading to a symmetrical position. The classical players like Maroczy, Capablanca, Lasker, Tarrasch, and Rubinstein would play the Symmetrical Variation, 4. Bb5 Bb4 5. O-O O-O 6. d3 d6 7. Bg5, when Black should sever the symmetry with 7...Bxc3 (if 7...Bg4, then 8. Bxf6 Qxf6? (8...gxf6 is better, but leaves White with the better game because of Black's weakened kingside) 9. Nd5 Qd8 10. Bxc6 bxc6 11. Nxb4, when White is up a piece) 8. bxc3, with an even game. However, Rubinstein's 4...Nd4 and Marshall's 4...Bc5 are sharp alternatives. The Scotch Four Knights begins with 4.d4, and can lead to the enterprising Belgrade Gambit after 4...exd4 5.Nd5!?, a highly tactical system which often runs 4...exd4 5. Nd5 Nxe4 6. Bc4 Be7 7. Nxd4 O-O 8. Nb5 Bc5 9. O-O Nxf2 11. Qh5. Black is doing all right, but some careful play is required.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Added:''' --[[User:Loek van Kooten|Loek van Kooten]] 13:10, 9 February 2007 (UTC)&lt;p&gt;
'''Reported by:''' Jorge Gorín&lt;p&gt;
'''Version:''' 7.0.284&lt;p&gt;
'''System:''' Unknown&lt;p&gt;
'''Description:''' I find that whenever a word (appearing in whatever place in the sentence) starts with a capital letter or is fully capitalized, as is common in technical manuals, the blue/underlined translations shown by DVX at assembly time tend to show no more than one or two options, instead of all the translations for the word that are present in the TDB/Lexicon/MDB. This was not so in the past, and started apparently with build 284.&lt;p&gt;

There is no definite pattern for this bug, as in some occasions (but very few) the whole list is shown, and also on some occasions just a couple of translations are shown even when the word neither doesn't start with a capital letter nor is fully capitalized. But in general, I found that this problem tends to appear when a translation for the source word exists also in the MDB, for example in a one-word TU present in the MDB. In that cases, DVX normally stops displaying the rest of the blue/underlined translations as soon as it finds the translated word in the MDB.&lt;p&gt;

On the other hand, all the available translations remain available in the AutoSearch Portions windows, and can be picked from there as usual. (The problem is that I am used to pick from the blue/underlined words in the cell itself.)&lt;p&gt;

I hope that I have been clear, and I also hope that this very annoying bug (at least for me, since it tends to void my efforts in sending terms to the TDB and Lexicon) is finally fixed in the new version to appear soon.&lt;p&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''red giant''' is a terminal stage for most stars. When the star starts to run out of available nuclear fuel, it's core can no longer completely oppose the inward pull of gravity and shrinks. However, the shrinkage adds energy to the core, which results in a temperature rise. Meanwhile the increased temperature of the surface of the core produces such photon pressure that it pushes the outer layers of gas of the star outward and into a large gaseous atmosphere. The outer layers expand and cool and the star's color shifts toward red. The star has now become a red giant. A red giant star has a core that has reached a temperature of 100 million Kelvins, but whose outer layers are much cooler. Red giants are truly enormous. One with the mass of our Sun may expand outward past the orbit of the Earth.

Red giants live perhaps a 100 million years or so, by which time it's core again begins to run out of available nuclear fuel. This is followed by a new core collapse. What happens now is dependent on the mass of the core. If the core is less than 1.44 times the mass of the Sun, the collapse crushes the core further into a white dwarf, and since the white dwarf cannot contract any further due to quantum mechanical reasons, outer layers of the star that are falling onto it rebound and are blown off into space to form a large and often beautiful '''planetary nebula.'''

However, if the star is significantly more massive than our Sun, and its core is more than 1.44 times the mass of the Sun, the final collapse is great enough to crush even the Earth-sized white dwarf, pushing electrons into protons to form neutrons and so liberate vast amounts of space. Thus the core crushes down to about the size of a city and becomes an almost unimaginably compact and dense object known as a neutron star.

A '''pulsar''' is a rapidly spinning neutron star. Other stars spinning this fast would explode, but the pulsar does not because its high gravitational attraction holds it together. Pulsars have a powerful electric field that throws off electrons. These stars get their name from the signal pulses that result from their rotation.

If the original star was much more massive than the Sun and its core more than 3 times the Sun's mass, then the force of gravity crushing it at this stage is so great that not even the neutrons can withstand it, and they too are crushed to become perhaps Nature's strangest creation, a '''black hole.'''

== undelete request ==

Hi. I {{tl|delete}} tagged my user space on Nov 25 and would like it back; all re *over there* — not here. I blanked my talk page, too, and it's been deleted as well. I'm going to add a nbsp character entity to my user page as a non-red place holder until I launch a next gen page. My user space was built with about six subpages and I'd like all the histories back. All seems to be looking up over there and you should see [[w:WP:AC/N]] re legal threats. I've noted your comments re myself and they are much appreciated. Cheers, [[User:Jack Merridew|Jack Merridew]] 07:39, 4 December 2009 (UTC)

: Hi Jack,

:: I've already gotten the en:wp user space undeleted; I think after the above note. I was referring to the pages here; there should be 6 pages: the main one and 5 subpages. They should all show as a batch in my deleted contribs. My above comment only meant that the impetus for all this was over on en:wp. I'll be doing new user pages and that's why I blanked the page.

Hi, do you think this is worth keeping? It's a very undeveloped stub and the WV Topic / project doesn't seem to have ever got going... If you think it's worth keeping I'll try and find a book to link it into (obviously not the Cookbook!). Thanks. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 12:30, 30 December 2009 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">The temperature of a star refers to its surface and that is what determines its color. The lowest temperature stars are red while the hottest stars are blue.

Astronomers are able to measure the temperatures of the surfaces of stars by comparing their spectra to the spectrum of a '''black body'''. A black body is one that entirely absorbs all radiation that strikes it. Astronomers determine the black body spectrum which most closely matches the spectrum of the star in question. Because the temperature of the matching black body is known, astronomers can then calculate the star's surface temperature.

Astronomers classify stars into different types depending on their temperatures. These types are O, B, A, F, G, K, and M, where type O stars are the hottest and type M stars are the coolest. Each of these types is divided further into sub-divisions from 0 to 9 in order to distinguish between slight differences in each star's spectral patterns, which depend on the star's temperature.

Our Sun is a type G star, which are yellow stars with surface temperatures of about 6000°C, or 11,000°F. Type A stars, which are hotter, are white in color and maintain temperatures of around 10,000°C or 18,000°F. The hottest of the types, B and O, are blue stars while the coolest of type M are red in color and have surface temperatures of about 3,000°C or 5,400°F.

Note that we have referred to the surface temperatures of stars thus far. Each star, however, ranges in interior temperature with cores reaching temperatures in the millions of degrees. Although the Sun's surface is only 5800°C, for example, its core achieves a temperature of 15 million Celsius. With the mass of a star and its chemical composition known, astronomers can calculate the temperatures within its core. 

'''Main sequence''' stars have a core temperature of 10 million Kelvins. '''Red giants''' have a core temperature of 100 million Kelvins.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
Electronic collaboration can support the on-going learning need of today's workforce. Many factors are influencing the growth and evolution of the work environment. &lt;BR&gt;
'''The tasks are changing.''' More and more the tasks encountered in the workplace require collaborative work and on-going learning among individuals from many different functions. &lt;BR&gt;
'''The knowledge required to do work is changing.''' As knowledge becomes more specialized and problems become more complex, solutions to problems will require more and more cross functional teams working and learning from each other as part of their jobs. &lt;BR&gt;

'''The technology to support work is changing.’’’
One important technology which is shaping and will continue to shape the work environment of the future is electronic networks for team collaboration. Electronic collaboration tools could create work environments which satisfy many of the on-going learning needs of the 70 plus percent of our work force who engage in knowledge work. These environments could help the worker learn just as easily from a global database as from a friend or co-worker on-line in the next office. 
We are now in a unique position to understand, and develop applications to support the human side of connectivity. We now have the opportunity to create learning products and processes for improved productivity internally, which will serve a models for marketable products and processes.   One of the most critical aspects of improved productivity is supporting the on-going learning that needs to occur among the members of the work force. I have over the last two decades discussed how existing technology and processes for collaborative networked learning might be implemented to respond to educational opportunities.   An important aspect of implementation would be planning for effective facilitation of learning. 
The more understanding we gain about the learning processes that occur in the individual and in conjunction with others, the more we can design systems that support the processes critical to learning. On-going research into electronic communication has advanced our understanding of how to design environments that foster effective individual and group communication. Coupling this knowledge with our understanding of learning processes, we can begin to implement environments that support and facilitate learning in this new age of connectivity. 

==Human value-added learning can be facilitated in today's networked workplace.== 
In an era of smart machines where robots can be programmed to recognize patterns and respond, the human value-added in today's work force is the ability to learn quickly and constantly in the face of rapid change. As part of a team the worker is learning to collaboratively solve new problems and design new products. The human worker is challenged not to apply pre-defined rules in new contexts but to think creatively and learn constantly. Collaborative networked learning is one strategy which can begin to foster the human value-added component in the work environment. 
Human learning is the value-added processes of integration of new knowledge with what one already knows and synthesis of new data to form new concepts and explanations for events. For instance, the salesperson is constantly organizing and reorganizing his/her concepts of ‘’’effectiveness.’’’ S/he draws upon examples from his/her own experience and that of other salespersons. Based upon perceived similarities and differences among all experiences with different customers, the salesperson forms his/her own mental construct of effectiveness in today's market. The salesperson may rework the concept mentally a number of times before testing it out on a client. Perhaps prior to meeting with a customer, if an opportunity for communization presents itself, the salesperson will test out the new concept of (effectiveness) on other members of the sales unit. Or the salesperson may logon to test out the idea with an expert who happens to be in another region, or in another country. Each time the salesperson calls on a client, s/he receives more data which can be used to test and refine his/her mental model of the world and effectiveness. S/he may also share the revised concept with other salespersons either locally or remotely located, who could assist them in learning new personal concepts of effectiveness. In this example, the salesperson is engaging in value-added learning through inductive reasoning. In this example and many others in today's work environment, there are no established answers. The &quot;answers&quot; are just changing too fast, or no one has the answer or the team of workers have to create the knowledge as they go along. More and more often the worker today is defining the concepts and learning the rules as s/he goes alone. For this learning to occur, we need tools and processes to support the communication which make it possible.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Communication Models==
Collaborative Networked, therefore, would occurs in the 
context of a group with a mission or agree-upon-purpose.  
The work involves the structuring and restructuring of
conceptual knowledge.  The final product is a message, an
external artifact of the group knowledge at a particular point
in time,which communicates the knowledge
of the group.  The message might take the form of a program,
a report, a strategy document, a diagram, a drawing etc.
Learning-work involves the cognitive processes 
of assimilation--intake of 
information from the environment, accommodation--restructuring
to fit new into the old, present structure,
and integration--directly fitting information into existing structure.
And most importantly it involves the resolution of conflict 
between old and new structures,which can lead to innovation.
&lt;p&gt;
Two communication processes or type of dialogs
are involved in learning-work: (1) Intra-personal
communication--integration, and accommodation--involves processing 
within the individual. (2) Interpersonal communication
involves assimilation-- the intake of information from the environment--and
representation of one's knowledge structure in a form and medium
that can be shared with another person.
As one person,shares ideas with another person,
the process becomes an on-going loop from assimilation through representation 
of knowledge structures.  
&lt;p&gt;
At any point the learner may represent his/her ideas in order to test out
hypotheses to gain agreement or validation.  When members of a mission oriented
group create shared knowledge structure and produce an artifact such as a 
written report or a software program, for example, they engage in learning to created a product which is their collective knowledge.
&lt;p&gt;
In this chapter, using this model of communication as a guide, I will focus on how to facilitate the communication processes necessary for value-added learning to occur in a collaborative networked setting. I focus attention on the interpersonal communication processes which relate to the creation and sharing of meaning and strategies to support the intra-personal processes. 

===Value-added learning involves purposeful intra-personal comunication.===
A guiding objective is to promote learning through purposeful communication. For instance, the learning that our hypothetical salesperson experienced, involved the intra-personal communication processes going on within the mind of the person and the interpersonal communication occurring among the group of salespersons. 
I use the term '''intra-personal communication''' to talk about the active internal involvement of the individual in symbolic processing of messages. In intra-personal communication, each learner becomes his/her own sender and receiver, providing feedback to him/herself in an on-going internal process. It might be useful to envision intra-personal communication occurring in the mind of the learner in a model which contains a sender, receiver, and feedback loop. 
===Value-added learning involves purposeful interpersonal communication.===
I distinguish intra-personal from the social aspect of learning between people and among groups, which I refer to as '''interpersonal communication.'''
Both processes are intricately linked to each other in on-going learning.

==Support for intra-personal and interpersonal communication involves new models of electronic group communication.==
===New model involves symbolic communication rather than accuracy of signal.===
In order to discuss support strategies for learning, I propose a model of intra-personal and interpersonal communication which is different from the engineering model of electronic communication. In this model, I assume that the signal has been transmitted accurately. The focus is on what learners do with the words and pictures that form the basis of their communication. Unlike the engineer's electronic signal, the words and pictures of the learning theorists are not the real thing, they are symbols. Humans use their symbols to create, re-create, and share meaning and understanding,i.e. to develop new concepts. 
(Intra-personal and Interpersonal Model of Networked Communication)  We might imagine a two-personal interpersonal model with messages passing between two humans  while the  circular intra-personal processes occur within and back to the person. 

===Social dynamics are a critical factor in the new networked group model.===
In the networked group model, I call attention to the social dynamics of knowledge creation and learning. The group model includes the dimension of (context) or environment shared by the members of the group. In the framework of this discussion, I use (context) to talk about the shared psychological climate of the group, e.g. the electronic space and the degree of community or trust that the participants feel, not the physical connection. Learning in the social context of electronic networks involves, not only the communication of messages within and among members of the group, but it also involves (feedback). Feedback is the reactions, confirmations, or acknowledgments which one member shares with another in the networked group. The model also focuses attention on a shared group memory--a (database) of all the group's messages as well as data and information from external sources such as external databases or electronic communication with other networked groups. 
===Facilitation in collaborative learning=== 
In the past when knowledge was resident only in the expert and did not change rapidly, we hired teachers based on their knowledge of the content and their platform skills,i.e. their ability to transmit information to the student. While these criteria are still valuable for success of the individual instructor who is lecturing in front of a live class, they decrease in importance when we move into the electronic on-line environment. 
The communication setting is different and the types of skills, knowledge attitudes, values and beliefs are different in the collaborative networked environment. The role changes to one of facilitator/coordinator of a group rather than primarily a &quot;giver&quot; or transmitter of knowledge. Facilitation (1\I am not focusing on an individual per se but on a set of behaviors that could be provided by one member of a collaborative team or could be shared by a number of members over time. The term (facilitator) as used in this discussion does not imply one specific individual.) involves strategies for encouraging groups of individuals to learn with and from one another to create new levels of understanding and knowledge. In essence the role changes to one of drawing-out and drawing-together to form a community rather than transmitting a pre-defined, structured body of thoughts or knowledge. 
While much of the basic research relating to facilitation and interpersonal communication in in-person groups and many of the skills are relevant in the on-line environment, it is important for even the experienced facilitator to adapt to ( and carefully consider) the differences of the networked environment. For example, the lack of visual or verbal clues increases the demands on the facilitator in the on-line computer mediated collaboration. Furthermore, in audio supported networks, the ability to identify participants and their emotional state from voice tone alone is critical to successful facilitation. Likewise, the lack of physical presence special requirements on the otherwise skillful facilitator in the in-person group. While the many uniquenesses are important and deserve additional research, it is important to focus on essential characteristics of facilitation as a basic starting point.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Regarding the two images you uploaded ==

I noticed that you removed all the content from [[:Image:Alaska.JPG]] and [[:Image:Alaskan photo by Rachel Brusseau.JPG]]. I also noticed that they are not being used in any Wikibooks pages. Did you want them deleted? --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 20:13, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

:Yes I would like you to delete these photos.  I was trying to have a picture on my page but the image uploaded way too big and basically I wanted the picture to be about 2 inches by 2 inches.  Since I couldn't get that to happen, I have opted not to use them.  Please if you know how to help me and make them that size, I would really appreciate it.

:: I could help you make those images that size. Before I do that, however, please consider browsing through [[commons:Category:Alaska]] and its sub-categories. There are many free excellent pictures there. One example I quickly found was [[:Image:Looking back to Little Port Walter - NOAA.jpg]]. To include a picture that is at Wikimedia Commons (http://commons.wikimedia.org/), all you need to do is include it as if you uploaded it yourself onto the Wikibooks servers. And note that even if an image is uploaded at a large size (which many images in that category at Wikimedia Commons are), you may down-size them for display on the module that you are working on by adding the text ''|20px'' after the filename (where ''20'' is replaced by the number of however large you want the image to be). You may learn more about image syntax on Wikibooks by reading [[w:Wikipedia:Extended image syntax]]. If you read through that page, I am confident that you will be able to include your picture in the page in the manner that you want to.
:: Finally, please consider reading [[Wikibooks:Image use policy]]. The policy is proposed, but is generally followed and enforced by administrators. Every image uploaded to Wikibooks '''must''' list a detailed source and copyright status on the image page. You do not have to re-upload the image to add this information. You can go to the image page, click &quot;edit this page&quot; at the top navigation bar, and then list the required information.
:: Finally, you can sign your posts using four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;)&lt;!-- Just copy the stuff within the parentheses and remove the &lt;nowiki&gt; and &lt;/nowiki&gt; tags --&gt; which the wiki software will expand into your username (Hammergk) with a link to your user page ([[User:Hammergk]]) and the UTC timestamp when you clicked &quot;Save page.&quot; Then other users can readily follow a discussion.
:: If you have any questions regarding images or anything, please feel free to leave me a message here or at my [[User talk:Iamunknown|talk page]]. Best, [[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 22:04, 10 February 2007 (UTC)
::: Thankyou for getting back to me.  I have given it consideration and just want to not have a picture on my page.  Thanks for all of your imput.

'''Instant Chocolate Mousse'''

==Ingredients==

* ½ [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] unsweetened [[Cookbook:Cocoa Powder|cocoa powder]]
* ¼ cup plus 2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] hot [[Cookbook:Coffee|coffee]]
* [[Cookbook:Pinch|Pinch]] of [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Pint|pint]] [[Cookbook:Heavy Cream|heavy cream]] (also called [[Cookbook:Whipped Cream|whipping cream]])
* ⅔ cup [[Cookbook:Powdered Sugar|powdered sugar]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Ounce|ounce]] kirsch (cherry brandy), chocolate brandy, or coffee liqueur
* 6 chocolate cups or shells
* Small [[Cookbook:Chocolate|chocolate bar]] (for [[Cookbook:Garnish|garnish]])
* 6 [[Cookbook:Cherry|maraschino cherries]]

==Procedure==

# In a medium bowl, [[Cookbook:Whisk|whisk]] together the cocoa powder, coffee, and salt. It should whisk easily and have the consistency of melted chocolate.
# If it is too thick, whisk in another tablespoon of coffee.
# Set aside.
# In a large bowl, use an [[Cookbook:Mixer|electric mixer]] on medium-high to whip the cream for 1 minute.
# Add the powdered sugar and whip for another minute.
# Add the kirsch and coffee-cocoa powder mixture.
# Whip on high until stiff peaks form, about another minute.
# Spoon the mousse into a medium plastic bag and twist the top closed.
# Use scissors to snip off one corner (about ½ inch up).
# Arrange the chocolate cups on serving plates.
# If the cups don't sit flat, place a dollop of mousse under them.
# Squeeze the bag to pipe the mousse into the chocolate cups.
# Use a [[Cookbook:Vegetable Peeler|vegetable peeler]] to shave the chocolate bar over the mousse-filled cups, letting some of the shavings scatter on the plate.
# Top each mousse with a cherry.

==Tips, Notes, and Variations==

* Refrigerate if not eating immediately.

== Goal ==

In this lesson, you will learn to greet people and ask how they are. The verb 'to be' is discussed and the formation of yes/no questions is introduced. You do not need any prior knowledge of Greek.  But you do need to be able to read it.

== Dialogue ==
: '''''Αντώνης''': Γεια σου!
: '''''Ανθή''': Γεια σου!
: '''''Αντώνης''': Πώς είσαι;
: '''''Ανθή''': Καλά είμαι! Εσύ πώς είσαι;
: '''''Αντώνης''' Καλά.
: '''''Ανθή''': Γεια σου!
: '''''Αντώνης''' Γεια σου!

'''Notes'''

* The answer to Πώς είσαι; could be είμαι καλά or it could simply be καλά. 
* Τί κάνεις; can be used instead of Πώς είσαι; and in this case, the longer form of the answer would be again είμαι καλά.
* The most formal way to greet is χαίρετε!

'''Examples'''

'''Example 1 (informal)''' 
* '''Α:''' Γεια! Τί κάνεις;
* '''Β:''' Πολύ καλά, εσύ;
* '''Α:''' Καλά!

'''Example 2 (informal)'''
* '''Α:''' Γεια σου! Eίσαι καλά;
: Hello! Are you well?
* '''Β:''' Ναι, είμαι καλά, εσύ;
: Yes, I'm well and you?
* '''Α:''' Είμαι πολύ καλά!
: I'm very well!

'''Example 3 (formal)'''
* '''Α:''' Γεια σας! Πώς είστε;
* '''Β:''' Είμαι αρκετά καλά, εσείς;
* '''Α:''' Καλά, ευχαριστώ!

==Explanations==

* You have probably already noticed the words είμαι, είσαι and είστε. These are three forms of 'to be', corresponding to I am; you are (singular) ; and you are (plural). The είμαι needs to be changed into different forms to reflect different meanings.  The verb είμαι is an irregular verb so the way it is conjugated (changed to mean something slightly different) does not follow any pattern.  So it needs to be learned by heart. But for the moment, all we need are these three forms.
* If we look at the second mini dialog in the above examples, we notice the είσαι καλά; question.  This illustrates how yes-no question are formed in Greek. They are formed simply by intonation with no word order change.  When we talk about yes-no question, we talk about questions of the form 'Are you' or 'Do you ' e.g. Are you hungry? or Do you like apples?. Further yes-no questions can be formed like this. For example: 'Είσαι εντάξει;'
* In this lesson, you might have noticed that other questions are formed with the words τί and πώς. These two words are used to form questions. They correspond to what and how in English.  In Greek, simple questions involving these two words are formed by placing the question word at the beginning of the sentence. For example, 'Πώς είστε;' and 'Τί κάνεις;'.
* You definitely must have noticed that in Greek the question mark is replaced by a semicolon.

== Summary ==

* We have learnt the ways to say hello. (Γεια σου! Γεια!)
* We now know how to ask how someone is. (Πώς είστε; Τί κάνεις;)
* We are able to answer how we are and ask in return. (καλά! Είμαι εντάξει.)
* We have introduced how to form yes-no questions. (Eίσαι καλά;)
* We can form simply questions with τί and πώς. (Τί κάνεις; Πώς είστε;)

== The next step ==

You should now do the exercise related to each section ([[Modern_Greek/A1/Exercises/Lesson 1|found here]]),  or if you're feeling very confident go to the next lesson, [[Modern_Greek/A1/Lesson 2|lesson 2]]. Alternatively, return to the [[Greek_language|contents]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The &quot;Black Box&quot; approach to problem-solving ==

In this book, all the problems you'll solve will be &quot;black-box&quot; problems. This means that we take a look at a unit operation ''from the outside'', looking at what goes into the system and what leaves, and extrapolating data about the properties of the entrance and exit streams from this. This type of analysis is important because it does not depend on the specific type of unit operation that is performed. ''When doing a black-box analysis, we don't care about how the unit operation is designed, only what the net result is.''  Let's look at an example: 

{{example|
Suppose that you pour 1L of water into the top end of a funnel, and that funnel leads into a large flask, and you measure that the entire liter of water enters the flask. If the funnel had no water in it to begin with, how much is left over after the process is completed?

'''Solution''' The answer, of course, is 0, because you only put 1L of water in, and 1L of water came out the other end. The answer to this does not depend on the how large the funnel is, the slope of the sides, or any other design aspect of the funnel, which is why it is a black-box problem.}}

=== Conservation equations ===

The formal mathematical way of describing the black-box approach is with '''conservation equations''' which explicitly state that what goes into the system must either come out of the system somewhere else, get used up or generated by the system, or remain in the system and '''accumulate'''. The relationship between these is simple:

# The streams entering the system cause an increase of the substance (mass, energy, momentum, etc.) in the system.
# The streams leaving the system decrease the amount of the substance in the system.
# Generating or consuming mechanisms (such as chemical reactions) can either increase or decrease the stuff in the system.
# What's left over is the amount of stuff in the system

With these four statements we can state the following very important general principle:

{{box|
&lt;math&gt; Accumulation = In-Out+Generation-Consumption &lt;/math&gt;}}

Its so important, in fact, that you'll see it a million times or so, including a few in this book, and it is used to derive a variety of forms of conservation equations.

=== Common assumptions on the conservation equation ===

The conservation equation is very general and applies to any property a system can have. However, it can also lead to complicated equations, and so in order to simplify calculations when appropriate, it is useful to apply assumptions to the problem.

*'''Closed system''': A closed system is one which does not have flows in or out of the substance. Almost always, when one refers to a closed system, it is implied that the system is closed to ''mass flow'' but not to other flows such as energy or momentum. The equation for a closed system is:
:&lt;math&gt; Accumulation = Generation &lt;/math&gt;
:The opposite of a closed system is an '''open system''' in which the substance is allowed to enter and/or leave the system. The funnel in the example was an open system because mass flowed in and out of it.
*'''No generation''': Certain quantities are always '''conserved''' in the strict sense that they are never created or destroyed. These are the most useful quantities to do balances on because then the model does not need to include a generation term:
:&lt;math&gt; Accumulation = In - Out &lt;/math&gt;
:The most commonly-used conserved quantities in this class are '''mass''' and '''energy''' (other conserved quantities include momentum and electric charge). However, it is important to note that though the ''total'' mass and ''total'' energy in a system are conserved, the mass of a single species is '''not''' (since it may be changed into something else in a reaction). Neither is the &quot;heat&quot; in a system if a so-called &quot;heat-balance&quot; is performed (since it may be transformed into other forms of energy. Therefore, one must be careful when deciding whether to discard the generation term).
*'''Steady State''': A system which does not accumulate a substance is said to be at steady-state. Often times, this allows the engineer to avoid having to solve differential equations and instead use algebra. 
: &lt;math&gt; In - Out + Generation - Consumption = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
:''All problems in this text assume steady state but it is not always a valid assumption''. It is mostly valid after a process has been running in a controlled manner for long enough that all the flow rates, temperatures, pressures, and other system parameters have reached reasonably constant values. It is not valid when a process is first warming up (or an operating condition is changed) and the system properties change significantly over time. How they change, and how long it takes to become close enough to steady state, is a subject for another course.

== Conservation of mass ==

TOTAL mass is a conserved quantity (except in nuclear reactions, let's not go there), as is the mass of any individual species if there is no chemical reaction occurring in the system. Let us write the conservation equation ''at steady state'' for such a case (with no reaction):

&lt;math&gt; In - Out = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

Now, there are two major ways in which mass can enter or leave a system: diffusion and convection. However, if the velocity entering the unit operations is fairly large and the concentration gradient is fairly small, diffusion can be neglected and the only mass entering or leaving the system is due to convective flow:

&lt;math&gt; Mass_{in}  = \dot{m}_{in} = \rho*v*A &lt;/math&gt;

A similar equation apply for the mass out. 

In this book, we generally use the symbol &lt;math&gt; \dot{m} &lt;/math&gt; to signify a convective mass flow rate, in units of &lt;math&gt; mass/time &lt;/math&gt;. Since the total flow in is the sum of individual flows, and the same with the flow out, the following '''steady state mass balance''' is obtained for the overall mass in the system:

{{box|
&lt;math&gt; \sum{\dot{m}_{out}}-\sum{\dot{m}_{in}}=0 &lt;/math&gt;}}

If it is a ''batch'' system, or if we're looking at how much has entered and left in a given period of time (rather than instantaneously), we can apply the same mass balance without the time component. In this book, a value without the dot signifies a value without a time component:

&lt;math&gt; \sum{m_{out}}-\sum{m_{in}} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

{{example|

Let's work out the previous example (the funnel), but explicitly state the mass balance. We're given the following information:
# &lt;math&gt; {m_{in}} = 1 L &lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt; {m_{out}} = 1 L &lt;/math&gt;

From the general balance equation,

&lt;math&gt; In - Out = Accumulation &lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, &lt;math&gt; Accumulation = 1L - 1L = 0 &lt;/math&gt;.

Since the accumulation is 0, the system is at steady state.}}

This is a fairly trivial example, but it gets the concepts of &quot;in&quot;, &quot;out&quot;, and &quot;accumulation&quot; on a physical basis, which is important for setting up problems. In the next section, it will be shown how to apply the mass balance to solve more complex problems with only one component.

# {{Note| Johnson-Lenz}}The term groupware was originally coined in 1981 by Peter and Trudy Johnson-Lenz,in &quot;Consider the Groupware: Design and Group Process Impacts on Communication in the Electronic Medium,&quot; In Hiltz, S.R. and Kerr, E (eds) (Studies of Computer-Mediated Communications Systems: A Synthesis of the Findings. Final Report to the Information Science and Technology Division, National Science Foundation (IST-8018077)\bold) East Orange, N.J., Upsala College, Chapter 5.) is helping facilitate communication in groups. Groupware acquired national popularity in the middle 1980’s in articles appearing in the popular press. . In one such article in Fortune, Louis Richman (2\Richman, Louis. 1987. &quot;Software Catches the Team Spirit,&quot; (Fortune\bold) Vol 115, 12, June 8,1987, pp. 125,131,132,136.) described the concept as follows: Software that will enable people to collaborate across barriers of space and time is one of today's hottest frontiers of computer research. Like an electronic sinew that binds teams together, the new &quot;groupware&quot; aims to place the computer squarely in the middle of communications among managers, technicians, and anyone else who interacts in groups, revolutionizing the way they work.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Beginning Of The End ==

By the start of the twentieth century, a major problem had become apparent in what is now referred to as 'classical physics'. The Rayleigh-Jeans Law of thermodynamics stated that as the wavelength of the light incident on a hot body, the total power reflected from the body would also increase. The problem with this was that as the wavelength increased towards zero, the power increased towards infinity. This peak occurred about the ultraviolet section on the EM spectrum so the problem became known as the Ultraviolet Catrastope. This marked the beginning of the end for classical physics.

However, in 1900, a physicist named Max Planck went before the German Physical Society and presented a groundbreaking new theory on thermal radiation. It was based on an idealised body called a blackbody - perfect absorber and emitter of radiation. The emission spectrum of this body is identical to that of classical theory until it reaches a specific wavelength, dependent on the temperature of the body, where it peaks and then drops to zero for the shortest wavelengths.

      <comment>Swimming</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Competative sports, as an extreme and seeming obvious example, should be avoided. Insecurities and other related &quot;flight&quot; instincts can corrupt a healthy attempt to return to or to even experience for the first time a healthful mindset. 

Apprehension can interfere with group exercise, although the task of entering into an exercise routine is up to an individual. Depression can sway a recovering person through extreme emotions related to apprehension at joining a group even for Yoga. Depending on the source of the depression, avoid group exercise until you are truly ready.

Sports or exercise is challenging for people experiencing depression primarily because of the engagement of mind, body and spirit. For example, persons depressed as a result of sexual trauma have spent an unknown length of time separated intellectually from their body(ies). One exercise that allows for a kind of autonomy while truly strengthening the body and connecting mind and body is lap swimming. Here an individual can focus on breathing as one would while engaged in meditation. There are also various kinds of disguises involved in swimming starting with swim goggles. The combination of the &quot;mask&quot; and the single swim lane results in a safe environment. 

Swimming requires regular participation. The outcomes (for me) are still being recognized, but the main effort to connect or to reconnect the mind and the body through a concentrated routine of swimming for exercise are being realized.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Gradients in Flash Professional 8 can be applied to fill objects as well as strokes. You can choose between a variety of gradients such as a linear gradients or radial gradients. These two gradients can be made up of either 2 colors or a whole bunch of colors (not just one color), and are dropped into the color pointers which can be dragged left or right for position on the gradient. In a radial gradient, the left color pointer controls the color of the radius center and the right color pointer controls the color of the radius edge. You can play around with the transparencies of each color you choose to put into your gradient and set it anywhere between 0% to 100%. In this manner, a gradient can then be used as a layer mask to create a feathered vignette or other effect.

The settings for gradients can be accessed from the Color Mixer panel, where they can also be saved and added to the Color Swatches panel as new palettes. The overflow styles popup controls how the gradient will respond at its edges. The three choices are: extend, reflect and repeat. Extend does just what it sounds like—the gradient will extend as far as needed to fill the area it is contained in. Reflect flips (or reflects) the original gradient edge to edge to fill the area. Repeat creates a repetition of the original gradient edge to edge until the area is filled.

Gradients in Flash Pro 8 have changed a bit from past Flash versions. In Flash Pro 8, the gradient transform tool lets you control the location of where the focal point can be placed. This is beneficial in creating realistic lighting effects. There are several handles on the gradient transform tool that allow for different types of modifications. The round center handle moves the center point and the center pointer moves the highlight. The round corner handle rotates the gradient whereas the round corner handle with a straight arrow will scale the gradient symmetrically. Finally, the square handles scale the gradient either vertically or horizontally.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;h2&gt;3. Auto-propagate&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;
'''Added:''' --[[User:Loek van Kooten|Loek van Kooten]] 18:19, 5 February 2007 (UTC)&lt;&lt;p&gt;
'''Version:''' 7.0.284&lt;p&gt;
'''System:''' Windows XP SP2&lt;p&gt;
'''Description:''' DVX gets confused by number conversion issues in translations from Japanese and therefore copies numbers of auto-propagated strings straight away without actually checking whether the numbers in the auto-propagated 'copy' are equal to the numbers in the auto-propagated 'original'.&lt;p&gt;
Example: &lt;p&gt;
平成19年2月2日 (The year Heisei 19, 2nd month, 2nd day) ''is translated as'' February 2nd 2007&lt;p&gt;
平成19年1月1日 (The year Heisei 19, 1st month, 1st day) ''is auto-propagated as'' February 2nd 2007 (it should be January 1st 2007)&lt;p&gt;
While it is understandable that DVX cannot come up with the right translation for the auto-propagated copy, the danger lies in the fact that DVX marks the copy as auto-propagated while in fact the source text is different. Turning auto-propagation off is the other extreme, as that also cancels auto-propagation of strings that would otherwise be propagated correctly.&lt;p&gt;
Solution: DVX should not auto-propagate strings if a) the source text is Japanese AND b) numbers in the auto-propagated copy are not equal to numbers in the auto-propagated original.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;h2&gt;4. Import from Microsoft Word&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;
'''Added:''' --[[User:Loek van Kooten|Loek van Kooten]] 15:54, 6 February 2007 (UTC)&lt;p&gt;
'''Version:''' 7.0.284&lt;p&gt;
'''System:''' Windows XP SP2&lt;p&gt;
'''Description:''' After importing Japanese Word documents, the text in DVX is infested with rogue codes. Japanese often features both Chinese ideograms (&lt;i&gt;kanji&lt;/i&gt;) and the Roman alphabet/Arabic numerals. Since standard Roman alphabet/Arabic numerals in Japanese fonts are quite ugly, most Japanese texts in Word use two different fonts (one for kanji and one for the Roman alphabet/Arabic numerals), which are constantly alternated. Each alternation results in a rogue code. &lt;p&gt;
The problem is that if the target text is a western language, these rogue codes make no sense at all, as the target text will not feature kanji and is therefore written in one font (the font used for the Roman alphabet/Arabic numerals). I.e. these rogue codes are completely superfluous in the target text, slow down the translation process and pollute your databases. &lt;p&gt;
When translating from Japanese to a western language, DVX should therefore ignore all font changes and opt for a standard font instead (like Arial, or maybe even user-defined). Automatic recognition of the fonts used in the Japanese source text seems very complicated, as &quot;font sets&quot; (consisting of a Japanese and a Roman font) might be used and &quot;paired&quot; inconsistently.&lt;p&gt;
It seems many rogue codes are actually not caused by alternating fonts, but by alternating code sets, as even Word documents that have been forced to use one font give inconsistent rogue codes in DVX:&lt;p&gt;
{\loch\af25\hich\af25\dbch\af25 \loch\af25\hich\af25\dbch\f25 平成}{\loch\af25\hich\af25\dbch\af25 \hich\af25\dbch\af25\loch\f25 18年12月19日}&lt;p&gt;
instead of merely 平成18年12月19日&lt;p&gt;
The rogue codes are inconsistent: if a code appears behind 平成 (Japanese changes from kanji to Arabic numerals), you'd expect a similar code behind 年, 月 or 日, but this is not the case.

Goat meat is preferred over mutton in most of India and Pakistan, who find the smell of sheep's meat to be objectionable.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;small&gt;''This 'Unicode/doc' template documentation is [[w:Wikipedia:Template doc page pattern|transcluded]] for all [[Template:Unicode/doc]] tagged templates'' [&lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[{{fullurl:Template:Unicode/doc|action=edit}} edit]&lt;/span&gt;].{{#ifeq:{{SITENAME}}|Wikipedia|&amp;nbsp;|[[W:template:Unicode/doc|Masterpage]]&amp;nbsp;
}}&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;

==Purpose==

This template was created to allow easy switching to unicode fonts.  This is useful for pages that require unicode to display correctly, such as those written in the International Phonetic Alphabet.  On some browsers, such as Microsoft Internet Explorer, unicode does not seem to be activated automatically, so this template lets you force it manually.

One might ask why bother to use a template for this.  Simply:
# The template code is easier to remember than the HTML font style specification, which must be entered fairly precisely for this to work.
# The template code, although not completely transparent, is more transparent than asking new editors to use inline HTML CSS style tags.  At least for many editors.
# Using the template allows us to change unicode display properties for all articles that employ the template at once.  This is useful as the prefered fonts for displaying unicode are somewhat disputable and will change as new, more complete unicode fonts continue to be developed.  The way font specification works, we can provide a whole list of suggested fonts and the first one that is active on the user's machine will be selected.

:When the page says Unicode, Internet Explorer will activate Unicode.
:However, when the page says Arial, Internet Explorer will display Arial. While Arial does include e. g. basic Greek and Cyrillic, it does not include e. g. IPA extensions. These are displayed in Arial anyway when the page says so – that is, they are displayed as the famous rectangles.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Excerpts from the online editions of the three Hebrew newspapers of widest circulation &lt;ref&gt;According to the Hebrew Wikipedia articles about these three newspapers. Note however, that this claim is not sourced in those articles.&lt;/ref&gt; appearing in Israel: Yediot Aharonot, Maariv and Haaretz. The excerpts are taken from articles written originally in Hebrew (not translated from Reuters, say) and published after the turn of the century. Only articles accessible to anonymous surfers have been utilized.

The excerpts are chosen as to illustrate grammatical constructs. Since the interest is in Media Hebrew, rather than colloquial Hebrew, verbatim quotations are disregarded. That is to say, if a news article says: ''The Prime Minister said: &quot;We must reach a resolution.&quot;'', whatever is in the quotation will not be excerpted, however had this sentence been phrased so: ''The Prime Minister said, that the government had to reach a conclusion.&quot;'', than the phrase &quot;the government had to reach a conclusion&quot; might well be used as an excerpt. The excerpt are taken only from the body of the article, not from its title or subtitle.

'''White Cheese''' - a particular variety of the increasingly-popular Greek [[Cookbook:Feta Cheese|Feta cheese]] now popular in many places. It originated on the Balkan Peninsula in a region called Trakia, which is the current day Southern Bulgaria. This Bulgarian sirene has much the same texture as the Greek feta. It is a brined cheese, produced from sheep or cows milk, and is both used on the table and as an essential part of other foods from [[Cookbook:Shopska Salata|Shopska Salata]] to [[Cookbook:Banitsa|Banitza]]. Feta Cheese is produced in many different countries, but Bulgarian-made Feta is generally held to be the best.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Catullus 7''' is one of Catullus's poems to his Lesbia. This seems to have been written at a particularly passionate stage of the affair, as the poem has no negative connotations, or doubts, as in others.

=Connotations of The Text=

===Line 3===

*'''''Libya - Africa'''''

This is not to be confused with the present day nation of Libya. The Romans called the continent of Africa ''Libya'' and our modern day nation of Libya was known as ''Africa''.

*'''''quam magnus numerus Libysae harenae - as great a number of the  Libyan sands'''''

A common metaphor for infinity, Catullus stresses his desire for Lesbia through this wish. The message here is, that no amount of kisses will be enough for Catullus. This is also a stereotypical way of expressing love which makes it original by naming the beach but it doesn't give it a romantic aspect but a learned aspect because of Lesbia

===Line 4===

*'''''lasarpiciferis - silphium bearing'''''

Libya was the centre of producing the plant ''lasarpicium'' of which is the gum ''asa foetida''. The gum was used as a cure for baldness and also as a contraceptive - it would be administered to a woman to terminate a pregnancy.

===Line 6===

*'''''Battus - the founder of Cyrene'''''

In 700 BC Battus founded of the city of Cyrene in what is now Libya. His tomb, mentioned here as ''sacrum sepulchrum'' [sacred tomb] was 300 miles away from the Oracle of Jupiter, and some Romans used to venture out into the desert in the hope of finding it, and receiving a vision.

Battus' father was Polymnestus, a descendant of the Argonaut Euphemus. After leaving Lemos for Lacedaemonia, they were forced to leave Lacedaemonia and settle in Thera. His mother was a native-born Cretan called Phronime. Battus' real name has come under dispute; some have said his real name was Aristaeus.

Ceyrene, futhermore, was connected to the poet Callimachus. Callimachus was considered chief of the elegiac poets; his elegies were highly esteemed by the Romans (see Neoterics), and imitated by Catullus. 

===Line 7===

*'''''aut quam sidera multa - or as many as are the stars'''''

The number of stars in the sky is how many kisses is enough for Catullus. This of course is infinite and the poetic reference serves to make his point within the metaphor.

===Line 8===

*'''''furtivos hominum vident amores - which see the secret love affairs of men'''''

Could this be a clear reference to Catullus himself?

===Line 11===

*'''''curiosi - inquiring men'''''

This is a reference to the gossip that was present at the time of Catullus' affair. He is thought to have been having an affair with a senator's wife, and as such the gossip in the Senate was potentially damaging.

===Line 12===

*'''''mala fascinare lingua - an evil tongue bewtich'''''

In witchcraft, it was believed that if the evil one had a specific number that was related to the victim, [in this case the number of kisses] then it would make the spell more effective. Catullus is urging Lesbia to kiss him so many times that any potential evil-doer would not be able to count them. This would also serve to quench Catullus' lust for Lesbia.

= From [[Wikipedia:Talk:Catullus 7]] =


I do NOT think this poem should be moved to wikisource because it is notable enough on its own (e.g., it is especially famous of catullus's poems and has inspired other poetry). I mark it as a stub. Please regard this. see also wikiproject catullus. [[User:Sophysduckling|Sophy&amp;#39;s Duckling]] 05:36, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</text>

===Line 10===

*'''''leuare curas...'''''

Here there is text that has been lost, as the poem clearly has a break in sense. We can only theorise what might have been after line 10. &quot;Some verb or neuter noun is as pleasing to Catullus as the golden apple was to Atalanta&quot; -  Daniel H. Garrison, The student's Catullus, University of Oklahoma Press, 2004, p. 94

===Line 11===

*'''''est/es'''''

Usually &quot;est&quot; but see a strong argument for it's being &quot;es&quot; in &quot;Sparrows and Apples: The Unity of Catullus 2&quot;, users.ox.ac.uk/~sjh/documents/cat2.doc.

===Lines 11-13===
This refers to the myth of the girl [[w:Atalanta|Atalanta]] a beautiful princess. She was warned about the dangers of marrying, so she set a task: For if any man could beat her in a foot race, he would be able to marry her. '''But''' if the man lost he would be killed.

One day, a hero called [[w:Melanion|Melanion]] (also known as [[w:Hippomenes|Hippomenes]]) came along to woo her. Atalanta fell in love with him and while running she stopped to pick up a golden apple thrown by Melanion. (This apple had been given to him by the goddess [[w:Venus|Venus]]). Atalanta stopped and picked up the apple and deliberately lost the race so she could marry him.

= From [[Wikipedia:Talk:Catullus 2]] =
&quot;Some also believe that the sparrow is a metaphor for Lesbia's sexual organs.&quot;
No. A 'passer' is also a colloquial expression, according to Pompeius Sextus, used in mimes when referring to the male genitalia. So, leave Lesbia alone, it's the poet going solo here. The people proposing this theory are: Iohannes Iovianus Pontanus, Angelus Politianus (latin transliterations both). Another theory (don't know whose) makes Passer a name of a person, who's showing too much affection to the Girl (don't forget it'll take a while untill Lesbia gets her name). And yet another theory makes the passer a small jewel the girl eventually loses. Nevertheless, these 2 last theories don't get much credibility.

What is a &quot;blue thrush&quot;? (mentioned as a candidate for the 'passer')  [[User:Vultur|Vultur]]  21:58, 17 July 2006

I think that the various theories on what the passer is should be added to the article. It being a textbook and all.--[[User:Bonaeludae|Bonaeludae]] 17:35, 20 April 2007 (UTC)</text>

=Connotations of the Text=

This is the poem Catullus himself chose as the 109th segment of his published set of poems. It is addressed to Catullus's mistress Lesbia. This poem joins the ranks of the many others that demonstrate his conflicting feelings for Lesbia.

===Line 1===

*'''''mea vita - lit. my life'''''

This translates literally to &quot;my life&quot; but a more natural English translation would be &quot;my love&quot; or &quot;my dear&quot;. It pertains to the common cliché that one's love becomes their whole life - and is as relevant today as in the time of Catullus.

=Vocabulary=

===Line 2===

*'''[[Wikt:fore|fore]]''' - the future infinitive of the verb to be, sometimes seen as &quot;futurunesse&quot; lit: to be about to be.

===Line 5===

*'''[[Wikt:liceat|liceat]]''' - an impersonal verb that requires a dative. &quot;liceat nobis&quot; literally translates as &quot;it may be permissable for us&quot;.

===Line 6===

*'''[[Wikt:foedus|foedus, -eris; ''n'']]''' - pact; bond; treaty

=Connotations of the Text=

Note the two tricolon crescendos in this poem; &quot;your household gods...old mother&quot; and &quot;places...tribes&quot; - these are particularly Alexandrian aspects of Catullus' poetry. This poem also expresses Catullus' Epicurean ideal through his friendship with Veranius.

===Line 1===

*'''''Verani'''''

Veranius was a friend of Catullus's who had just returned from serving with the governor of Spain.

=Connotations of The Text=
This poem concerns his love of [[w:Lesbia|Lesbia]]. This seems to have been written at a very passionate stage of the affair.
The poem is written in the [[w:hendecasyllable|hendecasyllable]] style.

===Lines 2-3===

*'''''rumoresque senum severiorum - rumours of severe old men'''''
This is a reference to the gossip going around the [[w:Senate|Senate]], as it was believed that Catullus was having an affair with a senator's wife, known as [[w:Clodia|Clodia]]. This is also thought to be the woman Lesbia in his poetry. Catullus is urging Clodia to disregard what people are saying about them, so she can spend more time with him.It also features a chiasmus. 

===Line 5===

*'''''brevis lux - brief light'''''

A pessimstic view of life, and the belief of no afterlife. This was a belief at odds with most Romans, who believed in the afterlife.

He also uses this view as an argument as to why Lesbia should spend lots of time with him.Here we find yet another chiasmus. 

===Line 5-6===

*'''''lux, nox'''''
The position of '''''lux''''' - light, and '''''nox''''' - night right next to each other serve to emphasise his two comparisons. Symbolically, the &quot;perpetual night&quot; represents death and the &quot;brief light&quot; represents life.

===Line 11===

*'''''conturbabimus illa - throw those accounts into confusion''''' 

This hopes that the evil ones will not know the specific numbers of kisses, therefore reducing the effectiveness of any potential spell and spurning ill will. [See Below].

===Line 12===

*'''''malus invidere possit -  [a person] casts the evil eye upon'''''

This is linked to the belief of witchcraft (the evil eye). In the practice of witchcraft (the casting of the evil eye) it was believed that if the evil one knew of certain numbers relevant to the victims (in this case the number of kisses) then the spell would be much more effective.

==Connotations of the Text==

This poem, which concerns the retirement of a well-traveled ship, borrows heavily from Ancient Greek vocabulary, and also uses Greek grammar in several sections, and makes numerous geographic references and elaborate litotic double negatives in a list-like manner. Catullus 4 has been viewed as everything from a parody of epic poetry to another piece of writing in which the Ship of State metaphor is used. The meter is iambic trimeter.

===Line 1===

*'''''phaselus''''' A ''phaselus'' was a small boat, derived from a Greek word meaning &quot;bean&quot; because of its similarity in shape to a bean-pod.

===Line 3===

*'''''trabis'''''

(&quot;timber&quot;, &quot;wooden beam&quot;) is here a poetic metonymy for &quot;boat&quot;.

===Line 4===

*'''''Palmulis''''' (diminutive of ''palma'', &quot;palm&quot; of a hand) is here a metaphor for &quot;oar&quot;.

===Line 9===

*'''''porpontida'''''

(&quot;in front of Pontus&quot;) was the ancient name for the Sea of Marmara.

*'''''Ponticum sinum''''' (&quot;Pontic sea&quot;) was the name for the Black Sea.

===Line 11===

*'''''Cytorio'''''

Mt. Cytorus was a mountain on the southern coast of the Black Sea, between the port cities of Amastris and Cytorus. Cytorus was famous as a source of boxwood.

===Line 14===

*'''''tibi'''''

Amastris and Cytorus are addressed in the singular (''tibi'' instead of ''vobis'') because the city of Cytorus was absorbed by Amastris as it expanded, forming a single city.

===Line 20===

*'''''Iuppiter'''''

Jupiter, king of the gods, is here used as metonymy for &quot;sky&quot; or &quot;wind&quot;.

===Line 21===

*'''''pedem'''''

(literally &quot;foot&quot;) is here used to mean &quot;sheet&quot;, a rope fastening the lower corners of a sail to the ship.

===Line 27===

The ''gemelle Castoris'' (&quot;twin of Castor&quot;) refers to Pollux, the other twin in the Castor and Pollux pair, who were also known as the Gemini (&quot;twins&quot;). The two twins were often referred to by only a single name, most commonly Castor, as though they were one, hence the ''tibi'' in line 26.

==Translation==
I'm a little worried about the current translation of &quot;phaesalus&quot;. It seems to me that &quot;yacht&quot; has more grand connotations than &quot;little boat&quot; might, and considering Catullus' affinity for diminutives in his epic parodies, &quot;yacht&quot; doesn't seem appropriate for the translation. Suggest changing it to &quot;little boat&quot;. Any complaints? --[[User:Blisters|Blisters]] 02:56, 11 October 2006 (UTC)

== Links ==

This poem is dotted with links to wikipedia. I have nothing personally against that, but it is incongruent with the other poems. Is there some general formatting rule to cover this? [[User:Storeye|Storeye]] 08:10, 20 May 2007 (UTC)</text>

=Connotations of the Text=

Elegiac couplets were mainly used for love poetry; however, Catullus uses them here to try to express how deep his love for his brother was.

This Poem was written while Catullus was on a sight-seeing journey on his way home from Bithynia. He went via Troad where his brother had died and wrote the poem addressed to him. This is one of several poems in which Catullus tries to cope with the loss of his brother, who had drowned.  The last words, &quot;Hail and Farewell&quot;, are among Catullus' most famous.

Alas, my brother,&lt;br /&gt;
You have been taken from me. You have been taken from me&lt;br /&gt;
And by cold hands turned to shadow, and my pain.&lt;br /&gt;
Here are the foods of the old ceremony appointed&lt;br /&gt;
Long ago for the starvelings under the earth.&lt;br /&gt;
Take them. Your brother's tears have made them wet. And take&lt;br /&gt;
Into eternity my hail and my farewell.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Taken from a speech given by Chris Hedges. I am not sure how to include, could someone add it if appropriate. 
If it is also in Chris Hedges book &quot;War is a force that gives us meaning&quot;, he might reference it.[[User:196.208.7.43|196.208.7.43]] 20:26, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

=Connotations of the Text=
This is traditionally arranged first among Catullus' poems, though it was not necessarily the first poem that he wrote. It is a dedication to [[w:Cornelius Nepos|Cornelius Nepos]], a historian and sometimes poet, though some consider Catullus' praise of Cornelius' history (''Chronica'') to have been sarcastic; Catullus attempts in many cases to do away with large-scale forms, focusing rather on small but elaborate constructions. Nepos' project, although &quot;doctus&quot; and &quot;laboriosus&quot; (not insignificant compliments from Catullus), is in the tradition of large, comprehensive works, which Catullus contrasts with his &quot;nugae.&quot;

The poem alternates between humility and self-confidence; Catullus calls his poetry &quot;trifles&quot;, but asks that it remain for more than one age. This understatement is deliberate; Catullus knows very well the quality of his poetry, and also the provocative form it has. He also calls his work &quot;new&quot;; the poems are recently made and therefore new, but they are also new as some of the first examples of [[w:neoteroi|Neoteric poetry]] in the Latin language.

The poem begins with a 2-line question followed by a 1-line answer.  The body of the poem, the middle 4 lines, is an explanation for the dedication; Catullus is dedicating the poems to Nepos because Nepos supported Catullus and because Catullus respects Nepos' work (and finds it similar to his own).  The next line affirms that Nepos should accept Catullus' &quot;whatever this is of a book,&quot; and the poem closes with a 2-line invocation of the Muse.

===Line 1===

*'''''dono'''''

We can understand 'cui dono...?' in one of two ways. 1) Taking the present tense literally: 'Who am I giving this booklet to (you may ask)?: well, the answer is Nepos'. 2) Taking the present tense as equivalent to a future, or a deliberative sujunctive: 'Who do I give this booklet to (I wonder)?: I know! Nepos' = 'who shall I give it to?', or 'who am I to give it to?'. In favour of (1) is the very similar opening of Meleager's dedicatory poem from his 'Garland' anthology (now preserved in the Greek Anthology, [http://www.archive.org/stream/greekanthology01newyuoft#page/110/mode/2up AP 4.1]): &quot;Dear muse, to whom to you bring this all-fruited song? Or who was it that made this garland of poets? Meleager made it, and he laboured at this gift as a keepsake for glorious Diocles&quot;. Either Catullus knew this poem, or knew of others like it, now lost: his own poem is a witty response. In favour of (2), Latin questions in the present tense sometimes have an urgent future, or deliberative, quality: [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/plautus/cas.shtml Plaut. Cas.] 384 ''Compressan palma an porrecta ferio?'', [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/cicero/att13.shtml#40 Cic. Att. 13.40] ''advolone an maneo?'', [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/vergil/aen4.shtml Verg. Aen. 4].534 ''en, quid ago?''. Furthermore, Ausonius seems to have taken it this way, as if Catullus, puzzled for a moment, plucked a name out of the air: 'inventoque/statim dedit Nepoti' = &quot;and on finding Nepos, gave it immediately to him&quot;. See Ausonius poem in full, in the note to line 3.&lt;br /&gt;
Through the light, bantering tone (here and elsewhere) Catullus wants us to know that he is Nepos' social equal -- not, for instance, a lickspittle poetaster in need of a patron. There's no-one he needs to impress, and these little gems are dedicated as lightly as they are rattled off. That's the pose, anyway...

*'''''libellum'''''

A &quot;papyrus roll&quot; (''[[wikt:liber|liber]]'', diminutive ''[[wikt:libellus|libellus]]'') was the standard ancient format for a body of writings and the ancient equivalent of a modern book. Likewise, &quot;papyrus sheets&quot; (''[[wikt:charta|cartae]]'') can refer to a &quot;volume&quot; of papyrus rolls.  Catullus' labeling of his poems as a &quot;libellum&quot; (as opposed to ''librum'') is an instance of the humble tone that pervades the poem.  It is perhaps a mock humility, considering Catullus' loftier statements present both here and in his other poems.

There has been much debate about what poems exactly composed the &quot;libellus,&quot; since the 116 poems (just shy of 2300 lines) that have come down to us are too many to fit onto a single papyrus.  It is mostly accepted now that the &quot;libellus&quot; was some selection of Catullus' poems, although which poems these were is unknown.

===Line 2===
* '''''arida'''''

Pumex is masculine, and the MSS give 'arido'. Servius ad Aeneid 12.587 remarks that 'Catullus said it in the feminine'; and in modern times most editors have followed Servius' hint, reading 'arida' here (Mynors in his OCT, Fordyce, Quinn;  but Riese (1884) and Merrill (1893) read 'arido'). But that's jumping the gun: Servius does not specifically quote this poem (though it's the only one we have where it makes a difference). Martial uses the masculine in 8.72.2, a poem which imitates Catullus (''Nondum murice cultus asperoque / morsu '''pumicis aridi''' politus / Arcanum properas sequi, libelle...''). See LCM 1986 p. 131 for the arguments against 'arida'.

*'''''modo'''''

The &quot;modo&quot; gives the impression of these poems being &quot;hot off the presses.&quot;

*'''''pumice'''''

Pumice was used to smooth off the ends of papyrus scrolls to prevent ragged edges.

*'''''expolitum'''''

The &quot;ex-&quot; has a sense of thoroughness. It refers literally to the papyrus, and figuratively to the poems contained therein. Quintilian, writing a century and a half later, used expolio in a literary sense (Inst. 8.3.42, warning against too great a polish in oratory), but the word was used metaphorically even as early as Plautus. The pumice-stone was soon to appear as an explicit literary metaphor in [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/prop3.html Propertius 3].1.8 ''exactus tenui pumice versus eat'').

===Line 3===

*'''''Corneli'''''

This Cornelius is identified as Nepos by Ausonius XXIII (= Ecl. 1 = Schenkl p.120 = 'Ausonius Drepanio filio'), itself an imitation of Catullus 1, which is quoted in full here, because it's by no means easy to track down:&lt;br /&gt;

«Cui dono lepidum novum libellum?»&lt;br /&gt;
Veronensis ait poeta quondam inventoque&lt;br /&gt;
'''dedit statim Nepoti'''. At nos inlepidum,&lt;br /&gt;
rudem libellum, burras quisquilias&lt;br /&gt;
ineptiasque, credemus gremio cui fovendum?&lt;br /&gt;
Inveni, trepidae silete nugae,&lt;br /&gt;
nec doctum minus et magis benignum,&lt;br /&gt;
quam '''quem Gallia praebuit Catullo'''.&lt;br /&gt;
Hoc nullus mihi carior meorum,&lt;br /&gt;
quem pluris faciunt novem sorores,&lt;br /&gt;
quam cunctos alios, Marone dempto.&lt;br /&gt;
«Pacatum haut dubie, poeta, dicis?»&lt;br /&gt;
Ipse est. Intrepide volate, versus,&lt;br /&gt;
et nidum in gremio fovete tuto.&lt;br /&gt;
Hic vos diligere, hic volet tueri:&lt;br /&gt;
ignoscenda teget, probata tradet:&lt;br /&gt;
post hunc iudicium timete nullum. Vale.&lt;br /&gt;
 

The allusion to Nepos' Gallic origins&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/pliny.nh3.html#127 Pliny N.H. 3.127], calling Nepos 'a dweller by the river Po', i.e. in Cisalpine Gaul&lt;/ref&gt; in line 8 is added confirmation that Catullus is addressing [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornelius_Nepos Cornelius Nepos] the historian and biographer. Catullus himself also came from Cisalpine Gaul -- hence 'Veronensis... poeta' (the poet from Verona) in line 2.

*'''''tu solebas'''''
The imperfect 'you used to think'&lt;ref&gt;Quinn (1970 ad loc.) suggests it may be an 'epistolary' past tense (see for instance [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9SrLPlZk5t4C&amp;pg=PA150&amp;lpg=PA150&amp;dq=epistolary+imperfect&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=EjvSB7hHJ7&amp;sig=Z5zSTaUt8gijRl_zUqlFKUJoq1M&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3rEiT-mBGcXV0QWDjq3OCg&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=epistolary%20imperfect&amp;f=false De Pretis 2004 p. 150]), i.e. Catullus chooses his tenses from the point of view of Nepos receiving this message in the future -- from which vantage point everything happening now will be in the past. If so: 'for you generally think...'. This view, however, sits oddly with the opening of the poem in the present tense ('dono'), and is hard to tie in with the later 'iam tum... cum' which clearly indicates a time in the past. So Rauk (1997) p. 327.&lt;/ref&gt; is evidence that Catullus' relationship with Nepos is long-standing. 
The emphatic 'tu' may imply 'you, at least, think something of my poems, even if no-one else does': Nepos has taste.

===Line 4===

*'''''aliquid'''''

The idea here is that Cornelius thought Catullus' trifles (&quot;nothings&quot;) to be ''something''.  

*'''''nugas'''''

Catullus again is being self-deprecating about his own poetry.  At the same time, the idea of creating these little &quot;nuggets&quot; was a point of pride for Catullus and the neoterics; they were creating a new genre of Latin poetry, quite distinct from weighty epics.

===Line 5===
*'''''ausus es unus Italorum'''''
Nepos' boldness and uniqueness are admirable qualities in an author; but the vocabulary also makes Nepos resemble a character from his own historical works -- adventurous, and the single man out of the multitude able to solve a crisis (like Horatius, Fabius Maximus, for instance), a point well made by [http://www.brynmawr.edu/archaeology/guesswho/johnston.html Johnston 1997].&lt;br /&gt;

===Line 6===

According to Ausonius Epist. 16 and [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2007.01.0071%3Abook%3D17 Aulus Gellius 17.21.3], Nepos wrote a work (now lost) entitled ''Chronica'', which is presumably what Catullus is alluding to here, rather than any of his biographical prose works (some of which survive). The ''Chronica'' need not have been a prose work (the usual assumption), but could have been in verse, like the ''Chronica'' by the Greek [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollodorus_of_Athens Apollodorus of Athens], which covered events from the fall of Troy to the poet's own time.

*'''''explicare''''' 
A standard word to denote the setting-out in order of a historical account, used indeed by Nepos himself in the [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/nepos/nepos.pr.shtml preface to his surviving work 'On excellent leaders of foreign races']; or any verbal description, written or spoken. At the same time its basic meaning 'to unroll' can literally be applied to the scrolls -- Nepos', and Catullus' own -- upon which the poet's eye dwells.

===Line 7===

*'''''Iuppiter'''''

An exclamation; Catullus is marveling at the quality of Nepos' work.

*'''''doctis et laboriosis'''''

Neoteric values; Catullus' poems are filled with &quot;learned&quot; references to mythology and are very finely crafted. Nepos' work is allegedly of similar quality.

===Line 8===

*'''''quidquid hoc libelli'''''

Self-deprecating, as is the &quot;qualecumque&quot; of the next line.

===Line 9===

*'''''o'''''

''O'' does not appear in any extant manuscripts, but is supplied by modern editors on the assumption that it was in the original, based on context and metrical concerns.

*'''''patrona virgo'''''

The &quot;virgin patron&quot; is either a muse or [[w: Athena|Pallas Athena]]. The invocation of a muse or inspiring deity is, of course, a common enough phenomenon in poetry -- Meleager addresses an unnamed Muse in his intro poem (see note on line 1). Notable here, however, is the Romanness of 'patrona': it's often the job of a dedication to define or enact the roles of poet and dedicatee as client and patron. Here, the job of patron is offered to the goddess.

===Line 10===

*'''''plus uno saeclo'''''

''[[wikt:saeclum|Saeclo]]'' (&quot;age&quot;, [[w:syncope|syncopated]] from ''[[wikt:saeculum|saeculum]]'') can more specifically mean &quot;lifetime&quot;, &quot;generation&quot;, or &quot;century&quot;; it does not necessarily refer to anything approaching the amount of time over which Catullus' poetry has survived. Notably, Catullus does not ask for many ages.  He merely asks that his &quot;quidquid hoc libelli&quot; remain for more than one. This is a touch of modesty, even in the middle of an invocation to the Muse (one of the more elevated activities of a poet).

*'''''maneat'''''

Optative subjunctive, not jussive subjunctive; one does not command the Muse.

==source text==

From what edition is the text taken? There are huge textual issues over the &quot;qualumcumque; quod, o patrona virgo&quot;- check the critical apparatus in the editions. It might be mentioned as a source. [[User:Reynaert-ad|Reynaert-ad]] 15:06, 28 May 2006 (UTC)

==Translation Argument==

[[User:71.195.206.227|71.195.206.227]] recently reverted a large number of my edits on this page; these edits are incorrect. Unfortunately this user is using an IP, not a username, so it is difficult to contact them. Hopefully, they will look here.

I have highlighted points that [[User:71.195.206.227|71.195.206.227]] appears to disagree with me over, and I will explain my decisions.

To whom do I give this new charming little book&lt;br&gt;
Just now smoothed with dry pumice?&lt;br&gt;
To you, Cornelius: For you were used to thinking&lt;br&gt;
My trifles to amount to something,&lt;br&gt;
For you alone dared '''''to unravel'''''&lt;br&gt;
the entire '''''history of the Italians''''' in three '''''scrolls''''',&lt;br&gt;
learned, (by Jupiter!), and '''''filled with labor'''''.&lt;br&gt;
Therefore have for yourself this '''''something,'''''&lt;br&gt;
This little book, and whatever it is worth; and let it, oh patron maiden,&lt;br&gt; 
remain for more than one '''''lasting''''' age.&lt;br&gt;

*The first point of contention appears to be &quot;unravel.&quot; [[User:71.195.206.227|71.195.206.227]] prefers the phrase &quot;set forth,&quot; yet this loses the theme of literature and unraveling that Catullus established. Throughout the poem, he uses phrases that have a secondary meaning related to literature and scrolls. In his exaltation of Cornelius he praises him for both liking Catullus's literature, and for Cornelius's great works. In short, literature is an essential theme of the poem. Using a phrase like &quot;set forth&quot; loses much of the beauty of the poetry here.

*Next, [[User:71.195.206.227|71.195.206.227]] prefers &quot;you alone of the Italians&quot; to &quot;the entire history of the Italians.&quot; However, in doing so [[User:71.195.206.227|71.195.206.227]] uses &quot;entire history of the world;&quot; the word &quot;world&quot; is not present in the Latin text, and [[User:71.195.206.227|71.195.206.227]] has no basis for this translation. Furthermore, there are other accounts of a man named Cornelius writing three major volumes on the history of Italy; while we don't have access to them any more we are quite certain they exist. Most likely, Catullus is referencing this person who wrote about Italy.

*[[User:71.195.206.227|71.195.206.227]] prefers &quot;volumes&quot; to &quot;scrolls.&quot; The justification for &quot;unraveling&quot; is the same as the justification for &quot;scrolls,&quot; but also Catullus uses word picture to establish a sort of unraveling of the line. Grammatically, the line proceeds in a spiral, from the center outwards, in an unraveling motion that implies a scroll. This sort of poetic technique is characteristic of Roman poetry, and is not to be discounted.

*[[User:71.195.206.227|71.195.206.227]] prefers &quot;laboriously wrought&quot; over &quot;filled with labor.&quot; There are three major problems with this. First, the verb &quot;wrought&quot; does not exist in the Latin text anywhere. Second, &quot;laboriosis&quot; has an ending that means literally &quot;Labor-filled,&quot; rather than just &quot;labor,&quot; which would be &quot;laboris.&quot; Third, &quot;laboriosis&quot; is a noun, not an adverb as [[User:71.195.206.227|71.195.206.227]] makes it.

*[[User:71.195.206.227|71.195.206.227]] would prefer &quot;such as it is&quot; to &quot;something,&quot; yet the Latin word &quot;quidquid&quot; specifically means &quot;something&quot; in English. There through the poem of Catullus's self-abasement; he calls his poems &quot;trifles&quot; earlier, and his reference to his poems as &quot;quidquids&quot; makes them seem small and not very valuable. [[User:71.195.206.227|71.195.206.227]]'s translation loses this meaning.

*Finally, [[User:71.195.206.227|71.195.206.227]] eliminates the word &quot;lasting,&quot; but this is completely baseless and ignores the word &quot;perenne&quot; in the original Latin text.

Hopefully, [[User:71.195.206.227|71.195.206.227]] will show up to respond to these arguments.--[[User:WoodenTaco|WoodenTaco]] 18:41, 13 February 2006 (UTC)

== December 19 Changes to the Catullus 1 wikibooks page ==


I've just deleted the comment on the &quot;italorum&quot; in line 5.  The comment said that &quot;italorum&quot; can be taken with &quot;omne aevum.&quot;  The &quot;literal translation&quot; and the English (and Spanish) on negenborn.net both take this reading as well.  I find it ''very'' hard to swallow.  Foremost is the fact that it is in the same line as &quot;unus.&quot;  I think the pull of the word order &quot;unus italorum&quot; is unavoidable.  &quot;Italorum/omne aevum&quot; is difficult not merely because of the line break, but also because &quot;omne aevum&quot; is certainly a unit.  From the workings of the poem, it seems to me that this is a hard reading.  If this reading were supported by meaning as [[User:WoodenTaco|WoodenTaco]] suggests, it could be a possibility.  But I think he certainly means &quot;you who alone of the Italians dared to unfurl every age&quot; rather than &quot;you who alone dared to unfurl every age of the Italians.&quot;  The crucial distinction here is:  was Nepos unique in being a Roman writing in such a way or was Nepos unique in writing about Italy?  We can quickly rule out the latter; Atticus, a friend of Nepos', wrote a Liber Annalis of Roman history.  Furthermore it is hardly daring (&quot;ausus es&quot;) to be a Roman writing on Rome.  On the other hand, Nepos' Chronica, the &quot;tricartite&quot; work to which Catullus is referring, was unique in that it was the first Roman attempt at a comprehensive history; Nepos apparently had a Greek model (Apollodorus' Χρονικά), but it is always a major event when a Roman adapts a Greek tradition to Roman means (cf. Horace:  &quot;princeps Aeolium carmen ad Italos deduxisse modos&quot;).  Further reasons for the reading &quot;unus Italorum&quot; are given in compelling article by W. Marshall Johnstone, Jr. found here: [http://www.brynmawr.edu/archaeology/guesswho/johnston.html].  So, for these reasons I've deleted the comment on &quot;italorum,&quot; for I think the reading in the given translation is right.  If someone wants to put it back, I think a discussion of both readings on the page itself would be necessary.  03:56, 20 December 2008 (UTC)Nathan  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/70.23.87.207|70.23.87.207]] ([[User talk:70.23.87.207|talk]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==More Translation==
*I am removing the word &quot;yourself&quot; from the English translation. &quot;Tu&quot; is just &quot;You.&quot; The &quot;tibi&quot; that might account for the &quot;you yourself&quot; is actually taken care of with &quot;To you, Cornelius&quot;.
*I am changing &quot;therefore&quot; to &quot;wherefore.&quot; Quare has a *slightly* different meaning from igitur and ergo, best conveyed with the use of the w. [[User:Sophysduckling|Sophy&amp;#39;s Duckling]] 03:09, 15 March 2006 (UTC)

:The ''tibi'' has nothing to do with the &quot;you yourself&quot;; it's not even in the same clause. The reason I translated ''namque tu solebas'' as &quot;for you yourself were accustomed&quot; is because ''namque'' means &quot;for&quot; or &quot;for indeed&quot; and ''solebas'' means &quot;you were accustomed&quot;, so your translation completely ignores the ''tu'' in the original Latin. In Latin, nominative pronouns (like ''ego'', &quot;I&quot;, and ''tu'', &quot;you&quot;) are typically a part of the verb, making it grammatically unnecessary to use them. As a result, almost all use of ''ego'' and ''tu'' is purely for emphasis (the only other alternative I can see here are metrical concerns). So, while ''tu solebas'' might ''literally'' mean exactly the same thing as ''solebas'' (&quot;you were accustomed&quot;), a more faithful rendition of the Latin would make the &quot;you&quot; more emphatic with something like &quot;for ''you'' were accustomed&quot; or &quot;for you yourself were accustomed&quot;, similar to the intensifying pronoun ''ipse''.
::Oh, right. I'll revert it. And it's important, anyway, because it singles him out to show his good taste: just as cornelius alone of the Italians dared to explain all history on three scrolls, he alone of all the Italians thought Catullus's nonsense was valuable. [[User:Sophysduckling|Sophy&amp;#39;s Duckling]] 21:50, 16 March 2006 (UTC)
:As for ''quare'': In modern English, &quot;wherefore&quot; is an archaic-sounding and rather obscure word; I'm pretty sure that most users won't understand the nuanced distinction between it and &quot;therefore&quot;, and some, sadly, may not even glean the basic information of its meaning. The dictionaries I have prefer &quot;therefore&quot;, &quot;whereby&quot; (significantly less obscure than &quot;wherefore&quot;, in my experience), and &quot;for which reason&quot; for ''quare''. -[[User:Silence|Silence]] 04:23, 15 March 2006 (UTC)
::How about I change it to &quot;For which reason&quot;? It avoids blurring the distinction between quare and ergo/igitur and it isn't obscure.[[User:Sophysduckling|Sophy&amp;#39;s Duckling]] 21:50, 16 March 2006 (UTC)

=Translation emendation=
Re 'omne aevum': it's an elementary error to assume that the singular of 'omnis' can't mean 'all/the whole'; but cf the famous opening of Caesar's Gallic Wars, &quot;Gallia est omnis divisa in partes tres&quot; = 'all Gaul [i.e. the whole of Gaul] is divided into three parts'. ''Pace'' Fordyce ad loc, I see no reason to imply that Cornelius is gathering separate periods of history into one book, but rather expounding the whole of time -- the whole of history -- seen as one overwhelmingly large chunk.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Okay everybody. What is Wikijunior? --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 19:37, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

:The cynic in me says that Wikijunior is the abandoned effort for fundraising by certain members of the WMF board of trustees in their attempt to try and kiss the behinds of a couple of wealthy benefactors who gave some money back elsewhen for a cool idea called &quot;Wikijunior&quot;, but has since been taken over by Wikibookians and changed to their own devices and goals.  The money collected was spent on some crazy party that seemed cool at the time, but nobody remembers what really happened.

:A more sincere and apologetic response would be that Wikijunior represents an attempt to create books that are oriented toward children, with an eye toward creating high quality content over starting a whole bunch of random stubs that are half-started.  The money raised in various fundraisers was used to finance the bandwidth and hosting costs of this project.

:There are many good intentions with Wikijunior, but I would have to say that this project needs to find a new focus and goal in many ways.  There is some incredible content that has been created under the &quot;Wikijunior&quot; brand, and it should also be noted that in many ways Wikijunior represents a completely seperate Wikimedia project that just happens to be using Wikibooks as an internet hosting service.

:That so many of the Wikijunior books have also achieved &quot;Book of the Month&quot; status shows something of the quality that this content has already reached, and that there may be some merit to the slow growth development style.  But this slow growth does have its own costs as well.

:For where to take this page, that is a good question.  I've been a long critic of Wikijunior being hosted on Wikibooks for the reason that such projects should be on something like the Incubator Wiki (that was finally created!)  Still, it is here on Wikibooks, and for now I can live with that.  There are areas of Wikijunior that need development and improvement, and this page may be a good place to start.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 01:21, 12 February 2007 (UTC)

::Before I started this recent effort I thought long and hard about whether moving Wikijunior forward was worth the effort. My eyes are wide open. I have seen what I perceive to be substantial indifference to this project from every quarter. But I believe in the idea that quality free content for kids makes the world a better place. This project has made a start on 14 useful open-content titles for kids. That's nothing to sneeze at. I am an idealist at heart. After careful deliberation, I believe that Wikijunior can accomplish important things, and this is step one. The community needs to decide what &lt;strike&gt;Wikibooks&lt;/strike&gt; Wikijunior ''should be''. Step two we can figure out once we know the outcome of step one. --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 03:44, 12 February 2007 (UTC)

My stance is the following: I am a casual contributor to the wiki* projects and I have only recently started contributing to Wikijunior which is why I do not have strong sentiments towards the relationship of wikibooks and wikijunior. My general feeling, however, is that it is of mutual benefit (I for one thing have found my way to junior through books). [[User:Sboehringer|Sboehringer]] 11:18, 2 May 2007 (UTC)

In my opinion, the policy is quite good. At the moment I don't see any ideas for improvements in it.

Speaking about Wikijunior - is there any sense in discussing here whether Wikijunior should be a part of Wikibooks? Such things are always decided on Meta Wiki. My personal view is that there is no reason for separating Wikijunior from Wikibooks. When Wikijunior and Wikibooks exist on the same wiki, there is a greater chance that users of one get involved in another. As a significantly smaller wikiprojekt, Wikijunior would only benefit from larger community of Wikibooks. Splitting projects is always an inconvenience: you have to register on another project and learn how to deal with a new community. Keeping dividing projects into small ones is a road to nowhere for me. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 20:11, 3 May 2007 (UTC)

I don't see any great advantage to splitting the projects apart. Personally I don't have the time or energy to launch a wikiproject. We do need to launch a separate child's portal that will be unlike anything else on any other mediawiki project (so far as I know), but I think we can do that and continue developing content here. --[[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:40, 4 May 2007 (UTC)

I like the proposed policy and believe that it pretty much encompasses the aims and spirit of the Wikijunior Project. If i may make a suggestion, though only a little one, could we change any instance of the word 'kid' to 'child' and 'kids' to 'children'. Just for consistencies sake and no other. However I am impressed by the policy proposed here. And i agree with you there Xixtas, we need to work on a portal for accessing the Wikjunior projects for children to use, something simple but striking. [[User:Urbane|&lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Urbane&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] [[User talk:Urbane|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Talk)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] [[Special:Contributions/Urbane|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Contributions)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] 17:32, 4 May 2007 (UTC)

To my mind &quot;kids&quot; and &quot;children&quot; are synonyms and that change doesn't change the meaning of the policy in any meaningful way. Go ahead and change it. If you want to note that you specifically favor that revision then you could just include the number of the revision you favor in your comments. I don't think anyone would object to such a change. --[[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:14, 5 May 2007 (UTC)

== Clarify &quot;Kid friendly&quot; ==

I think we should clarify the &quot;kid friendly&quot; part of this policy to show explicitly that WJ books are censored by the community for the protection of minors. Alternatively, this could be an addition to the bottom of the page or something. If we do say that WJ is censored, however, we have to make it clear that the censoring process is not immediate, nor is it a guarantee or a statement of liability. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 17:23, 21 November 2007 (UTC)

:I agree something needs to change if WJ is intended to be censored. I'm not so sure if a liability statement is needed specifically for WJ. I think the general disclaimer, and other disclaimers apply to WJ as much as it does to the rest of Wikibooks. I think if a statement about censoring WJ is added it also needs to be clear on what types of censoring is appropriate or not, or how its decided whether its appropriate to censor something. I'm in favor of adding it as an addition to the bottom of the page rather then changing the meaning of kid-friendly. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 18:09, 21 November 2007 (UTC)

::I think that we may be getting hung up on the word &quot;censored&quot;. The objective is to create kid friendly content (in every sense.) This means content that is inappropriate for kids should not be included and must be removed. What is inappropriate? well, offensive racist or intolerant hate speech, gratuitous or prurient sexual content, gratuitous violence, instructions for doing or making things which are very dangerous or widely illegal... Those are three off the top of my head. I'm not sure how much of this isn't already covered by [[WB:NPOV]] and the stipulation that Wikibooks doesn't allow fiction. I don't object to adding a stipulation that Wikijunior is censored (meaning doesn't allow certain types of content) for the protection of minors but I'm not convinced that it's necessary. Is there really confusion about this? --[[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:23, 22 November 2007 (UTC)

:::Well after your crude statement on VfD about censorship, and trying to put a stop to any suggestion of it being otherwise, yes I think clarification is needed. Different people have different views on whats appropriate for children or whats kid-friendly. I think kid-friendly basically says to write in a way that is understandable for children and will be enjoyed by children. The same issues of being dangerous and illegal that apply to Wikibooks as whole apply to children books, even more so because you not only have different laws which don't apply everywhere, but you also have different cultures and views on parenting. Children can be exposed to all the things you used as examples and may be something that some parents might feel ought to be discussed in a book here for children to read, rather then simply ignored or censored, and may be perfectly legal to do. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 01:02, 22 November 2007 (UTC)

::::I don't understand where you're coming from at all. So if someone starts a &quot;Wikijunior Illustrated Guide to Sexual Positions&quot; we shouldn't even be allowed to discuss whether it's appropriate? Because you assumed (incorrectly) that the phrase &quot;kid friendly&quot; only applied to style issues and not content? (even though content is discussed in the second sentence following that bullet point.) Again, I don't understand it. I still don't see the value in adding more legalistic verbiage to this policy. --[[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:08, 22 November 2007 (UTC)

::::Just to be absolutely clear, the policy already says that content in Wikijunior should be kid friendly. It's like you're not recognizing that it already says that. --[[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 04:46, 22 November 2007 (UTC)

== Relationship with Wikibooks ==

I disagree that a sub-project of Wikibooks should be able override the project-wide policy.  If that's desired, split the project out like was done with Wikiversity.  A more restrictive policy for a sub-project could be appropriate, but a less restrictive policy I feel goes against [[WB:INCUBATOR]] (though citing that wouldn't be relevant if we've already established that project-wide policies can be ignored). The policy's already been formulated, but I thought I'd put my opinion out there. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:31, 4 June 2010 (UTC)

: Wikijunior was started by a grant from the Beck Foundation, and was never intended to be a subproject. Wikijunior has its own domain name (http://www.wikijunior.org) which unfortunately redirects to [[Wikijunior]]. This is unfortunate because Wikijunior is not limited to English Wikibooks nor Wikibooks in general. Wikijunior exists on some language editions of Wikinews too for example. Wikijunior, like Wikiversity, predated the WB:INCUBATOR rule, and Wikimedia wide policy about incubations. Wikijunior is presumably an exception to the rules because of its history. I believe Wikijunior is a bit stuck. I believe it was intended to be moved as a separate project at some point and I'm not sure why that hasn't happened yet. I see Wikijunior as being an entirely independent project that unfortunately is still here. I must admit I have been inclined to enforce Wikibooks' rules on Wikijunior too, if only to try to force progression towards its intended independence. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 15:26, 4 June 2010 (UTC)

:* Wikijunior is most naturally a subproject of Wikibooks, so that whatever the ''specific'' historical events that led it here, this is always where it would tend to settle.  Wikijunior and Wikibooks both benefit form the association.  Their natural contributor bases blend seamlessly &amp;mdash; there is no distinct line between them &amp;mdash; and separating the projects would only create an artificial barrier to contributors roaming freely between, thereby reducing overall level of contribution on both sides of the artificial line.  That would destroy Wikijunior outright, and Wikibooks would have to invent a subproject as an outlet for the energies that its contributors want to direct toward a younger target audience.  And probably the first step of that would be to transwiki to this hypothetical Wikibooks subproject the books from the defunct separate project Wikijunior (much like the gradual absorption of simple Wikibooks that's going on now).  Leaving us all back pretty much where we are now, except for the lost time and effort spent getting there.

:* Concerning the relationship between policies in mainspace and Wikijunior.  I, at least, have never thought of Wikijunior as ''exempt'' from any of the Wikibooks policies; rather I see a few of those policies (and only a few of them) as being sufficiently articulated that they can accommodate variations in circumstances, including the circumstances of Wikijunior.  The policies have somewhat fractal boundaries anyway, with various specific kinds of works allowed or disallowed for specific practical reasons (the prohibition against computer game walkthroughs springs to mind), so I see nothing extraordinary about provisions for Wikijunior.  That doesn't mean everything is as well phrased as it could be.  The wording on this page could be taken to suggest that Wikijunior is a law unto unto itself (which I think it neither is nor should be).  If I had more time right now (maybe later), I'd go through the policies carefully to see that each one actually ''mentions'' the nuances for Wikijunior that, I'm claiming, are really integral to those policies rather than overriding them.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 19:28, 4 June 2010 (UTC)

:*: I disagree. Wikijunior is not naturally a subproject of Wikibooks. For example, Wikjunior is also intended to include a published magazine with articles of interest for children, and news stories revolving around current events in the world written by and for children. A magazine is not a book, and news stories are also not a book. Which is probably why Wikijunior expands across multiple wikimedia projects. Wikijunior's scope is broader than Wikibooks just like Wikiversity.
:*: I think most policies were written without Wikijunior in mind, precisely because they were never intended to apply to Wikijunior. Wikijunior needs its own independent community with its only independent policies. I think Wikibooks is more likely to crush, limit, and restrict Wikijunior, rather than allowing Wikijunior to mature and grow to its intended purpose. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 12:22, 5 June 2010 (UTC)

:::: I'll amend my position; I think most of the details of what I said earlier are not so much refuted as placed into a larger context that I was failing to take into account.  I have admittedly tended to simplify my view of Wikijunior (validly for some purposes, but not for this one) by dismissing the whole magazine-and-whatnot as grandiose plans that clearly won't ever happen.  It may be more accurate to say that they won't ever happen as long as Wikijunior is a wholly owned subsidiary (so to speak) of Wikibooks.  I stand by most of my earlier claims, ''given the current strong barriers between projects''.  As things are, separating WJ from WB would annihilate Wikijunior and create a Wikijunior-shaped hole in Wikibooks coverage.  As long as Wikijunior is here, the magazine isn't going to happen, and conversely, if the magazine were to happen, Wikijunior shouldn't be here.  As long as Wikijunior is here, I believe it is (recalling Adrignola's original question) appropriate and sufficient to view Wikijunior as a special case in the Wikibooks policies rather than an exception to them.

::::The difficulty is that right now the barriers between projects are too high.  If we had [[w:Wikipedia:Integrated watchlists|integrated watchlists]], Wikijunior and Wikibooks could be separated without diminishing either project (though there's no doubt which project can least afford to be diminished) &amp;mdash; although, if we had integrated watchlists, it would also cease to be a binary decision between keeping Wikijunior here and making it a separate project.  Conceivably, the best solution would then be to keep the Wikijunior ''books'' here, and make the ''other'' components of Wikijunior a separate project.  Once the inter-project barriers come down, the workable possibilities expand vastly.

::::In the past I've always been very skeptical about the usefulness of integrated watchlists, but I seem to have rather suddenly become a believer.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 16:20, 5 June 2010 (UTC)

:::::An aside, there is a [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Village_pump_%28proposals%29&amp;oldid=366199110#Integrated_watchlists discussion] on Wikipedia at this moment on integrated watchlists for trans-wiki collaboration. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:05, 5 June 2010 (UTC)

::::: I must admit I often find myself swaying back and forth between the bigger, the smaller, and the current picture of Wikijunior. I don't know if Wikijunior would be annihilated by becoming a separate project or not, I imagine that concern may have been raised for Wikiversity in the past as well. Creating a coverage hole is mainly why the situation is unfortunate. One possible solution to the coverage problem might be to allow some overlap. Wikibooks could have educational textbooks in the main namespace without any kind of organization other than by subject, and as is already the case, provide no assurance of appropriateness for children. Wikijunior could than be a lot like Wikisource in hosting more or less static texts. Wikijunior could host static texts of children's works from the other projects which have undergone a review by Wikijunior contributors. Wikijunior could also allow contributing to children's works in cases where there is no other place where the work is allowed, which could include things like the coloring book. Anyways that is one possible solution for Wikijunior as a separate project.
::::: Oh BTW, I meant that Wikijunior is an exception in the context of the rules regarding incubation. This policy is also an exception to Wikibooks' policies when there are contradictions. Most other things apply because Wikijunior hasn't made any other policies yet. I believe the deletion policy still applies to Wikijunior, for the most part for example. I think spam, nonsense, and copyright violations in Wikijunior can be deleted, while the general guideline about deleting modules that will never become educational doesn't apply because Wikijunior doesn't require books to be educational. I hope that clarifies my thinking some. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 16:31, 6 June 2010 (UTC)</text>

== Intervals ==
Interval-the distance between two notes

Intervals are an important part of music. Knowing them can make music easier, especially when learning scales. Firstly, intervals are the space between two notes on a staff. There are two kinds of intervals: melodic and harmonic. '''Melodic intervals''' are the intervals between two notes that are played at separate times. '''Harmonic intervals''' are the intervals between two notes that are played at the same time.

'''Unison''' comes from two Latin words, ''unus'' meaning ''one'', and ''son'' meaning ''sound''. Unison is when two notes play the same note. If you sit next to someone, and you both play C, you are in unison.

'''Minor seconds''' (m2) are one semi-tone (or half-step) apart. If you have a piano, two keys that are directly next to each other are a minor second apart. It is important to remember that B and C, as well as E and F, are minor seconds apart. This interval is considered the most disonant (lit. Bad sounding) interval. '''Major seconds''' (M2) are two half-steps apart, or one whole step.

'''Minor thirds''' (m3) are three half-steps apart, or a one-and-a-half step. In chords, this is what makes a minor triad &quot;minor.&quot; '''Major thirds''' (M3) are two whole steps apart. In chords, this is what makes a major triad &quot;major.&quot;

'''Perfect fourths''' are is a one-and-half step and a whole step apart (5 half-steps). This is very common in chant because of its unique sound. the first two notes in the wedding march are a perfect fourth apart. ''Tritones'' are three whole steps apart. This is a very uncommon interval, so practice it '''a lot'''. This will pay off in the future. ''Perfect fifths'' are seven half steps apart. Again, this is a very common interval in chant, and has a haunting sound.

'''Minor sixths''' are eight half-steps apart. If you've ever hear &quot;The Entertainer&quot; this interval is used. '''Major sixths''' are nine half-steps apart. There is a group of chords called sixth chords, which feature this interval. In ''The Phantom of the Opera'', this interval is used in the chords the organ plays.

'''Minor sevenths'' are ten half-steps apart. Minor sevenths are combined with minor triads to produce a brighter chord. '''Major sevenths''' are eleven half-steps apart. Major sevenths are combined with major triads to produce a &quot;jazzy&quot; chord.

'''Octaves''' are twelve half-steps apart.

There are two more concepts that are useful. '''Dimished''' and '''Augmented''' intervals. Diminished intervals are lowwered by one half step. Augmented intervals are hightened by one half step (e.g. Augmented unison is the &quot;same&quot; interval as a minor second).

At this point, melodic intervals are more important than harmonic intervals. However, if you ever want write music, direct an ensemble or play polyphonic instruments, harmonic intervals will become important.

== Intervals in scales ==

Scales are built from intervals. There are two paterns you should memorize for building scales. The first is for major scales: base, major second, major third, perfect fourth, perfect fifth, major sixth, major seventh, octave. For example C major scale is C, D (major second), E (major third), F (perfect fourth), G (perfect fifth), A (major sixth), B (major seventh), C (octave). The second pattern is for minor scales, and is as follows: Base, major second, minor third, perfect fourth, perfect fifth, minor sixth, minor seventh, octave. for example, C minor is: C, D (major second), Eb (minor third), F (perfect fourth), G (perfect fifth), Ab (minor sixth), Bb (minor seventh), C octave.

'''Royal Icing'''

==Ingredients==

* 2 large [[Cookbook:Egg White|egg whites]]
* ⅛ [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[cookbook:Cream of Tartar|cream of tartar]]
* 2½ [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] [[Cookbook:Confectioners' Sugar|confectioners' sugar]]
* liquid or paste food coloring

==Procedure==

# In the bowl of a [[Cookbook:Mixer|stand mixer]] fitted with the [[Cookbook:Whisk|whisk]] attachment, [[Cookbook:Beat|beat]]  the egg whites on low until they become loose, about 1 minute.
# Add the cream of tartar and continue mixing on low until the whites become frothy, about 2 minutes.
# Gradually add the confectioners' sugar with  the mixer on low.
# Continue to mix until the icing holds a stiff peak and is dull in appearance, about 2 minutes. The icing is ready to use for piping lines.

=====Flooding (filling in an icing outline)=====
* Add a small amount of [[Cookbook:Water|water]] to the frosting and mix until the icing reaches a looser consistency.

==Tips, Notes, and Variations==

* If concerned about food borne illness, use pastuerized eggs.
* If desired, divide the icing among smaller bowls and add coloring(s).
* To store icing for later use:
# Clean the inner sides of the bowl or container to remove any drips.
# Place a dampened paper towel directly on the surface of the icing and then cover the bowl very tightly with plastic wrap.
# Refrigerate up to 5 days.

==Uses==

* Use on top of [[Cookbook:Gingerbread|gingerbread]] or any other cookies.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A broad term referring to the gathering, analyzing and formatting of enterprise data to facilitate better and faster decisions.  BI is equivalent to the earlier term &quot;decision support system&quot;.  Although there is much overlap between Analytics and BI, BI is considered the more general, comprehensive term.

This book is about the properties of materials at the most fundamental level, with a particular bias on the application of these properties to electronic systems. This book forms the basis of the book on [[Semiconductors]]. This book starts from considering the electron as a particle in a material, and progresses to the properties of conductive and semiconductive materials.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This page introduces the basic properties of the '''electron''', the most important particle in electronic physics. This page introduces only what is necessary for the rest of this book to build on. for more detailed information, see the suggested [[#Further Reading|further reading]] at the end of the page.

==The Electron==

The electron is a subatomic particle with a negative charge, equal to –1.60217646×10&lt;sup&gt;-19&lt;/sup&gt; [[w:coulomb|''C'']]. Current, or the rate of flow of charge, is defined such that one coulomb, so 1/–1.60217646×10&lt;sup&gt;-19&lt;/sup&gt;, or 6.24150974×10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; electrons flowing past a point per second give a current of one [[w:ampere|ampere]]. The charge on an electron is often given as ''-e''. note that charge is always considered positive, so the charge of an electron is always negative.

The electron has a mass of 9.10938188×10&lt;sup&gt;-31&lt;/sup&gt; ''kg'', or about 1/1840 that of a proton. The mass of an electron is often written as ''m&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''.

When working, these values can usually be safely approximated to:

::''-e'' = -1.60×10&lt;sup&gt;-19&lt;/sup&gt; ''C''
::''m&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 9.11×10&lt;sup&gt;-31&lt;/sup&gt;''kg''

==Ingredients==

* [[Cookbook:Beans|dry beans]]
* [[Cookbook:Water|water]]
* [[Cookbook:Baking Soda|baking soda]] (if needed, see below)

==Procedure==

To soak beans, add 3 or 4 cups potable (drinking) water per half [[Cookbook:Pound|pound]], then [[Cookbook:Boil|boil]] 2 minutes, then set aside for an hour.&lt;br&gt;
Alternately (and more often done) let stand in same amount of water overnight.&lt;br&gt;
After either method, drain and rinse beans, then proceed cooking per recipe.

==Tips, Notes, and Variations==

* As beans are a natural product, pick over beans, discarding any stones, dirt particles, or discolored beans before soaking or cooking.
* If you have hard water in your area, adding ⅛ [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] baking soda will reduce the cooking time.
* [[Cookbook:Split Peas|Split peas]] and [[Cookbook:lentil|lentils]] are an exception to this method as they do not require soaking.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Humane Education: Creating a Compassionate Classroom'''

By Amy L. McNally

With the increased trend to establish standards of learning in the state of Virginia, we are moving towards a higher level of expected knowledge from students in the public school system.  I commend our state for creating a uniform standard of high-quality education that targets all students in the school system regardless of learning ability.  However, while we are standardizing the subjects taught, we have moved away from lessons that are peppered with messages relating to morality and compassion.  

This is not an issue of religion in the classroom.  This is an issue of teaching our children compassion, empathy, and tolerance through Humane Education.  

'''Humane Education'''

Humane Education promotes a compassionate attitude towards people, animals, and the environment.  While most parents and teachers have been teaching children humane principles for centuries, only a century ago did they have formalized programs designed for this purpose.  (Ascione, 2003).  Only now is the concept of Humane Education beginning to be considered by educators as an important facet of American Education.  

Humane Education teaches living ethically and peacefully by creating a curriculum with important information, inspiration, and methods for creating a safe world for all.  (wikipedia 2007).  Often, educators achieve a compassionate classroom by infusing the required SOL objectives with humane education principles.  For example, according to the eighth grade Virginia’s Standard of Learning, students are responsible for conducting an interview.  They also need to be able to write in different forms such as: informative, persuasive, and cause and effect.  A teacher who subscribes to the thought that Humane Education is important for a well-rounded student may assign the student to interview an individual that works with animals or relies on animals for their work.  This could include police officers that use dogs or mounted police, veterinarians, animal shelter employees, dog trainers, even people who rely on dogs for sight.  Once they gather their information, they could present the close relationship that these people have with the animals that they encounter by writing an informative essay.  

'''The Link'''
Most educators are very aware of the link between violence upon animals and violence against people.  There is a great deal of research correlating the two.  The “Boston Strangler’ was reported to have shot at dogs and cats as a child, Jeffrey Dahmer is said to have impaled dogs’ and cats’ heads on sticks. (Beirne, 1995)  While it is not assumed that if a curriculum of Humane Education were deeply ingrained in their formal education, they wouldn’t have committed such horrific acts; however, the principle of children having a decreased tolerance for cruelty certainly could only benefit the child and the society to which they live. 


'''Effects''' 
Measuring the effects of Humane Education has been a bit difficult for educators.  First, it is important that the children assessed represent a cross section of people representing the ethnic, economic, and cultural diversity present in the United States.  Then, it is important to evaluate the quality of Humane Education that is provided.  It is necessary to conduct longitudinal studies that follow children who are taught the principles of compassion through Humane Education in an attempt to determine the program’s level of effectiveness.  Humane Education “should also address general issues of moral education that are related to social problems like child maltreatment and delinquency.” (Angel, 1884)

T.A. Fitzgerald compared school-based interventions in fifth and sixth grade classrooms.  The four conditions were:  
1. repeated treatment where a humane educator presents lessons over a two month period
2. intensive treatment where the information is all given in one lengthy lesson
3. light treatment which provided reading material without any instruction
4. a control group where no humane education was provided

All groups were pre and post tested and his findings were that a focused classroom presentation by a master teacher would greatly affect the children’s humane attitudes.  (Fitzgerald, 1981) 

Malcarne also conducted studies to determine whether humane education was valuable in the classroom.  He assessed a small group of 33 students.  They were all in third and fourth grade.  What he looked at was the value of role play in creating empathy relating to human distress and mistreatment and animal abuse and distress.  His study strongly correlated the relationship between human empathy and animal empathy.  (1991)

'''Conclusion'''

The phrase, “It takes a village to raise a child” is a sentiment that many people strongly hold.  While we are moving away from infringing on people’s rights to educate their children with their own belief systems, I think it is imperative that we do not altogether abandon the mission to educate our children on basic humane principles.  In a world that is so politically correct, many educators worry about what little discretion they have regarding what is taught in the classroom.  Just because Humane Education isn’t explicitly listed in the Virginia’s Standards of Learning at the moment, doesn’t invalidate the benefits that our children receive by having exposure to this particular area of education.  I for one believe that raising children to have a decreased tolerance for cruelty while fostering an increased capacity for compassion is a ideology that will make the world a better place for generations to come.  Hopefully the educators that subscribe to the school of thought that Humane Education is mutually beneficial to both the children and to the society that they will become an active part in later years will pioneer legislation that not only permits humane principles being taught but requires it.  

'''Multiple Choice Questions''' 

1. When did the first formalized Humane Education program emerge?

'''Essay Question:'''

What is Humane Education and do you believe that it should be incorporated into the Virginia’s Standard of Learning?  Why or Why not?

'''Sample Response:'''

Humane education is a broad term that incorporates the principles of empathy, compassion, and tolerance.  Its objectives are to create people who value people, animals, and the environment.  This can be done in a variety of different ways such as informative lectures, role playing, and videos designed to create an awareness for all living things.  In theory, this also will make students more open to cultural and economic diversity by forging an unconditional acceptance for all things living.  

With a decreased tolerance for cruelty, a student may report another student who is abusing animals.  Since there is a proven link between animal abuse and violent crimes, perhaps this initial report may help direct a student to proper resources before their crimes become even more heinous.  

Without wanting to sound “tree-hugger-esque” I believe firmly in freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom to hold any beliefs as long as they don’t infringe upon the rights of others.  That being said, I don’t think there is a single soul that would not benefit from our future leaders being shaped with lessons that are layered with principles of human morality.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Current as a Flow of Electrons==

Current is defined as the flow of (positive) charge past a point per unit time:

::&lt;math&gt;I=\frac{Q}{t}&lt;/math&gt;

where
*I is current, in amperes
*Q is charge, in coulombs
*t is time, in seconds

Remember that since electrons hold a negative charge, a flow of electrons is in the opposite direction to the conventional current, I. In the diagram below, the conventional current flows from right to left in the conductive material (grey). The electron flow produces a current in the ''same direction'', but the particles themselves are moving the other way, from left to right.

[[image:Electron_flow_in_a_conductor.svg|centre]]

==Electrons in a Vacuum==

Consider an [[w:Electron gun|electron gun]] that produces a stream of electrons which are accelerated using a potential difference as below:

[[image:Electron gun.svg|centre]]

The kinetic energy of an electron from this electron gun is given by

::&lt;math&gt;T=\frac 1 2 m_e v^2&lt;/math&gt;

where
*T is the kinetic energy in ''J''
*m&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is the mass of an electron in ''kg''
*v is the velocity of the electron in ''m s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;''

Now, this is equal to the energy provided to the electron by the electric field, E, which is given by

::&lt;math&gt;T=QV \,&lt;/math&gt;

where
*t is the energy in ''J''
*Q is the charge in ''C''
*V is the voltage between the plates

Since Q=-e, we can write

::&lt;math&gt;\frac 1 2 m_e v^2=eV&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;v = \sqrt {{{2eV} \over {m_e }}}&lt;/math&gt;

==Electrons in a Resistive Medium==

This subsection will derive the drift velocity of an electron in a resistive medium, the conductivity (and therefore also resistivity) and provide a demonstration of the validity of Ohm's Law. It will also introduce mobility.

When electrons flow in a resistive medium, they collide with and scatter off the atoms that make up the medium:

[[Image:Electron flow in a resistive medium.svg|centre]]

These constant collisions means that, averaged over a length of time, the electrons do not accelerate because every time they collide the velocity is &quot;reset&quot; to, on average, zero. They travel instead at an average velocity, the drift velocity , ''v&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;''. We shall now derive the value of the drift velocity.

An electric field, ''E'' is set up across the medium by the applied voltage, ''V''. This field is given by:

::&lt;math&gt;E=\frac V L&lt;/math&gt;

From Newton's Second Law, we can say that the acceleration, ''a&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'', of the electron (when not in collision) due to the field is given by

::&lt;math&gt;a_f=\frac {F }{m_e},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''F'' is the force exerted by the electric field. This is given by &lt;math&gt;F=QE&lt;/math&gt;. This gives:

::&lt;math&gt;a_f=-\frac{eE}{m_e}&lt;/math&gt;

The negative sign comes about because of the negative charge on the electron. 

Every time the electron collides, it velocity returns to, on average, zero. Call the time between collisions ''&amp;tau;''. This means that the  acceleration due to the collisions, ''a&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'' is given by the change in velocity over ''&amp;tau;''. Since the electron can be said to be always travelling at the drift velocity (the average velocity), we have

::&lt;math&gt;a_c=\frac{-v_d}{\tau}&lt;/math&gt;

Since the electron travels at a net constant velocity, the acceleration due to the field and the acceleration due the collisions sum to zero:

::&lt;math&gt;a_f+a_c=0 \,&lt;/math&gt;

So,

::&lt;math&gt;-\frac{eE}{m_e}=\frac{v_d}{\tau}&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;v_d=-\frac{e \tau}{m_e}E&lt;/math&gt;

We now introduce a new term, '''electron mobility''', which is the velocity of the charge carrier per unit field. This has the symbol ''&amp;mu;&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' and is given by

::&lt;math&gt;\mu_e=\frac{v_d}{E}=-\frac{e \tau}{m_e}&lt;/math&gt;

Now, consider the equation

::&lt;math&gt;I=nAv_dq \,&lt;/math&gt;

where
*n is the charge carrier density in ''m&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;''
*a is the cross sectional area in ''m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''

Substituting for ''v&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''q'', we get

::&lt;math&gt;I=-enA\frac{-e \tau E}{m_e}&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting ''E''=''V/l'',

::&lt;math&gt;I=\frac{n A e^2 \tau}{m_e} \frac{V}{l}&lt;/math&gt;

Rearranging for convenience,

::&lt;math&gt;I=\frac{n e^2 \tau}{m_e} \frac{A}{l} V&lt;/math&gt;

We now have current, ''I'' as a function of the voltage, ''V'' and constants. Now, consider the definition of [[w:Electrical conductivity|conductivity]], &amp;sigma;:

::&lt;math&gt;\sigma=\frac {Il}{VA}&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting for I, and simplifying

::&lt;math&gt;\sigma=\frac{ne^2 \tau}{m_e}&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\sigma=\mu_e n e \,&lt;/math&gt;

Also, we can demonstrate Ohm's Law from here. Note that

::&lt;math&gt;I=\frac{n e^2 \tau}{m_e} \frac{A}{l} V&lt;/math&gt;

can be written as 

::&lt;math&gt;V=IR \,&lt;/math&gt;

where

::&lt;math&gt;\frac 1 R = \frac{n e^2 \tau}{m_e} \frac{A}{l}&lt;/math&gt;

This serves as a proof that in a conductor, so long as none of the other parameters change, voltage is proportional to current.

&lt;big&gt;'''Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation (PCI)'''&lt;/big&gt;

==Natural History==
*Risk of brain mets at 2 years is clinically ~50%, and ~80% in autopsy series. 


*'''Wisconsin, 1981''' (1974-1979) PMID 6268295 -- &quot;Risk of brain metastasis from small cell carcinoma of the lung related to length of survival and prophylactic irradiation.&quot; (Komaki R, Cancer Treat Rep. 1981 Sep-Oct;65(9-10):811-4.)
**Retrospective. 131 patients, 57 patients +PCI, 74 patients -PCI. Different periods of observation
**Calculated clinical failure: 12 months: +PCI 11% vs. -PCI 28%; 24 months +PCI 11% vs. -PCI 58% (SS)

*'''1979''' PMID 227582 -- &quot;CNS metastases in small cell bronchogenic carcinoma: increasing frequency and changing pattern with lengthening survival.&quot; (Nugent JL, Cancer. 1979 Nov;44(5):1885-93.)
**Autopsy series: 2-year CNS mets in 80% patients


==Treatment Overview==
*PCI was first proposed in 1973 due to high rate of developing brain mets, and their unsatisfactory control with whole brain RT
*Two meta-analyses showed benefit in terms of brain mets incidence (50% reduction) and survival (26% improvement) at 3 years
*PCI is currently recommended for patients with limited disease SCLC, who have complete response to systemic chemotherapy
*EORTC 08993 showed improved brain met control, improved DFS and OS in extensive stage disease patients with any response to chemotherapy
*RT dose 25/10 is standard (RTOG 0212) for limited stage, though 24-36 given in 2-3 Gy/day is used; RT dose 20/5 was used in extensive stage EORTC trial showing survival benefit
*Acute radiation toxicity is usually mild, and resolves within few months. Data on long-term neurotoxicity is lacking
*Concomittant chemotherapy can increase neurotoxicity, and should be avoided. 
*PCI should start as soon after completion of induction chemo as feasible based on meta-analysis results


'''Meta-Analysis'''
*'''Brussels, 2001''' (Belgium) PMID 11432756 -- &quot;Prophylactic cranial irradiation in small cell lung cancer: a systematic review of the literature with meta-analysis.&quot; (Meert AP, BMC Cancer. 2001;1:5. Epub 2001 Jun 19.)
**Meta-analysis. 12 randomized trials with 1547 patients, assigned to +/- PCI. (5 trials PCI initially with induction chemo, 2 trials PCI at end of induction chemo without checking response, 5 trials with CR only)
**Outcome: decrease in brain mets incidence HR 0.48 (SS) for all pts +PCI, improvement in OS HR 0.82 (SS) only for +PCI pts in CR
**Toxicity: long-term neurotoxicity not well described
**Conclusion: PCI can be recommended for patients with SCLC and CR documented by brain scan

*'''Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation Overview Collaborative Group; 1999''' PMID 10441603 -- &quot;Prophylactic cranial irradiation for patients with small-cell lung cancer in complete remission. Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation Overview Collaborative Group.&quot; (Auperin A, N Engl J Med. 1999 Aug 12;341(7):476-84.)
**Meta-analysis. Individual data of 987 patients from 7 randomized trials. Patients with complete remission. Extensive disease in 12-17%.
**Outcome: 3-year OS PCI+ 21% vs. PCI- 15% (absolute benefit 5%, SS). 3-year LC 33% vs. 59% (SS). DFS also improved
**RT dose: larger doses (8 Gy, 24-25 Gy, 30 Gy, 36-40 Gy) led to greater decrease in risk of mets, but no impact on survival
**Timing: decreased risk of mets with earlier administration after induction chemo
**Conclusion: PCI improves overall survival, DFS and control of brain metastases
**Critique: 4/7 trials had &lt;100 patients, ~14% had extensive disease, dose-fractionation not uniform


'''Randomized Trials'''
*'''EORTC 08993/22993''' (2001-2006) 
**Randomized. 286 patients. Extensive stage SCLC and any response to 4-6 cycles of chemo. No brain imaging was required prior to randomization but rather screened for symptoms of brain mets.  Treated with 1) PCI (20/5-30/12) vs. 2) no PCI. 
**'''1-year; 2007''' PMID 17699816 &amp;mdash; &quot;Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation in Extensive Small-Cell Lung Cancer.&quot; Slotman B et al. N Engl J Med. 2007 Aug 16;357(7):664-72. 
***1-year outcome: decreased symptomatic brain mets: PCI+ 15% vs. PCI- 40% (SS), improved OS PCI+ 27% vs. PCI- 13% (SS); extracranial progression of 90%
***Toxicity: PCI side effects, but clinically not significant
***RT dose: 60% received 20/5 with impressive benefit. Given short survival, authors suggest shorter courses
***Conclusion: PCI reduces risk of symptomatic brain mets, and improves DFS and OS in ED SCLC
***Critique:   Brian imaging not required prior to randomization or with followup.  Therefore, patients may have had subclinical brain mets (that would have been seen on MRI) in the radiation group and extensive stage group.   Applicability of this study to MRI negative extensive stage patients is difficult to interpret.  NCCN has PCI with extensive stage with response to chemotherapy and good PS as category 1.
**'''QoL; 2008''' PMID 19047288 -- &quot;Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation in Extensive Disease Small-Cell Lung Cancer: Short-Term Health-Related Quality of Life and Patient Reported Symptoms--Results of an International Phase III Randomized Controlled Trial by the EORTC Radiation Oncology and Lung Cancer Groups.&quot; (Slotman BJ, J Clin Oncol. 2008 Dec 1. [Epub ahead of print])
***Planned QoL analysis (C30 questionnaire and Brain Cancer module). Compliance 94% at baseline, 60% at 6 weeks, 55% at 3 months. 3-month cut-off used for short-term HRQOL
***Outcome: Mean global health status score higher in PCI group at 6 weeks (SS) and 3 months (p=0.06). Mean score for hair loss and fatigue worse with PCI (SS), trend to worsening with other symptoms (e.g. appetite, constipation, N/V, social functioning, H/A, motor dysfunction, and leg weakness). Severe HRQOL worsening PCI 35% vs. no PCI 22% (SS). 
***Conclusion: PCI should be offered for survival benefit, but patients should be informed of potential adverse effects from PCI
	
*'''Gustave-Roussy PCI-88, 1998''' (France) PMID 9857997 -- &quot;Controlled clinical trial of prophylactic cranial irradiation for patients with small-cell lung cancer in complete remission.&quot; (Laplanche A, Lung Cancer. 1998 Sep;21(3):193-201.)
**Randomized multi-institutional. 211 patients with SCLC in CR (goal 1100 patients). PCI protocol at discretion of each center (but RT 24-30 Gy, dose &lt;=3 Gy, in &lt;3 weeks). Mean F/U 5 years. Closed prematurely because results of PCI-85 convinced them to offer PCI to everyone.
**4-year OS: +PCI 22% vs. -PCI 16% (NS)
**4-year brain mets: +PCI 44% vs. -PCI 51% (NS)

*'''UKCCCR/EORTC, 1997''' PMID 9470828 -- &quot;Prophylactic cranial irradiation is indicated following complete response to induction therapy in small cell lung cancer: results of a multicentre randomised trial. United Kingdom Coordinating Committee for Cancer Research (UKCCCR) and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)&quot; (Gregor A, Eur J Cancer. 1997 Oct;33(11):1752-8.)
**Randomized. 314 patients. Limited stage SCLC with CR. Randomized to +PCI (36/18, 24/12, 30/10, 8/1, others as per treating MD) or -PCI
**Brain mets: +PCI better with HR 0.44. DFS +PCI with HR 0.75. RT dose 24/12 same as -PCI, but higher doses better.
**OS: no difference
**Toxicity: Impairment in both groups before PCI, additional impairment at 6 months and 1 year, but no difference between +PCI and -PCI
**Conclusion: PCI should be offered for CR. Dose should probably be &gt;24/12

**Original suggestion for PCI

==PCI dose regimens==
*There is insufficient data to make a recommendation
**Common fractionation scheme is 25/10 (this is also the &quot;standard&quot; arm in ongoing RTOG and EORTC trials)
**There is a suggestion that 30-36 Gy in 2-3 Gy/fx or BED equivalent produces good response (although RTOG 02-12 suggesting no benefit to increased dose)
**Doses below 24/12 are not effective
**Results of RTOG/EORTC studies should provide clarification; in abstract publication (ASCO 2008) 25/10 appears comparable in brain control but with better overall survival over higher doses


*'''Intergroup PCI99-01 / EORTC 00223-08004 / RTOG 02-12''' (1999-2005)
**Randomized. 720 pts with L-SCLC, in CR after chemo+thoracic RT. Arm 1) PCI with standard dose 25/10 vs Arm 2) PCI with high dose (36/18 QD or 36/24 1.5 Gy BID). All had brain imaging at baseline. Primary endpoint incidence of brain mets at 2 years

[Epub ahead of print]). Median F/U 39 months
***Outcome: 2-year incidence of brain mets standard 29% vs. high dose 23% (NS). 2-year OS 42% vs. 37% (p=0.05)
***Toxicity: fatigue 30/34%, headaches 24/28%, N/V 23/28%
***Conclusion: No significant reduction of brain mets after higher dose PCI, but significant increase in mortality. PCI at 25/10 should remain standard of care

**Retrospective. Registry review, 1417 SCLC, 244 limited stage.
**10-year cause-specific survival: 15%
**PCI: no difference in dosing schedule (range from 15/10 to 33/12)

**Meta-analysis. Analysis of brain relapse as a function of dose and time interval to PCI. &quot;Early&quot; PCI &lt;60 days of primary treatment, &quot;Late&quot; PCI &gt;60 days from treatment
**Early PCI: no dose effect, no threshold dose. Late PCI: dose threshold ~15-20 Gy
**Conclusion: For high probability of eliminating relapse, required dose 30-35 Gy in 2 Gy/fx

*'''Wisconsin, 1985''' (1974-1984) PMID 4083270 -- &quot;What is the lowest effective biologic dose for prophylactic cranial irradiation?&quot; (Komaki R, Am J Clin Oncol. 1985 Dec;8(6):523-7.)
**Retrospective. 327 patients treated with chemo (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and/or MTX). PCI during first week after diagnosis, concurrent with chemo #1. 
**Probability of brain mets at 1 year: similar for 25/10 or 30/10, ~10%. 
**Toxicity: No clinically apparent late neurotoxicity

==Neuro-toxicity==

{{recipesummary|Rice recipes|8|2 hours|2|}}

''Arroz con frijoles negros'' (rice with black beans) is one of the many rice and bean dishes that are extremely popular throughout Latin America, especially in the Caribbean. Most people serve meat or fish with rice and beans. However it also works well as a vegetarian or [[Cookbook:Vegan cuisine|vegan]] main course. 

Below is the Cuban version of this dish.

==Ingredients==
* 1 pound of dried [[Cookbook:Black Bean|black bean]]s 
* 1 large [[cookbook:Bell Pepper|green pepper]] (cut in half, seeds and stem removed) 
* 1/3 cup of [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
* 1 large [[cookbook:onion|onion]], chopped
* 4 cloves of [[Cookbook:garlic|garlic]], smashed and chopped
* 1 large [[Cookbook:green pepper|green pepper]] (seeds &amp; stem removed, then chopped)
* 4 teaspoons of [[cookbook:salt|salt]]
* 1/2 teaspoon of [[Cookbook:pepper|pepper]]
* 1 teaspoon of [[Cookbook:oregano|oregano]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Bay Leaf|bay leaf]]
* 2 tablespoons of [[Cookbook:sugar|sugar]] (or half a packet of low-calorie sweetener)
* 2 tablespoons of [[Cookbook:cider vinegar|cider vinegar]]
* 2 tablespoons dry of [[Cookbook:White Wine|white wine]] (cooking wine or dry sherry is fine)
* [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]] (see below for quantities)
* 2 cups of [[Cookbook:rice|converted rice]]

==Preparation==
# The night before you plan to cook, wash the beans and soak them in a large pot with 10 cups of water and one half of a green pepper.
# The next day, cook them in the same water until they are softer (a low [[Cookbook:boil|boil]], stirring occasionally, about an hour). 
# In a [[cookbook:Frying Pan|frying pan]], heat two tablespoons of oil and [[cookbook:sauté|sauté]] the chopped onion, garlic, and green pepper (this is called a sofrito) until soft (about 5-10 min.) 
# Take a cup of the soft black beans in some liquid and put in a [[cookbook:blender|blender]]. Liquefy the beans. Add this to the frying pan and mix the bean liquid with the sofrito. Then, add the contents of the frying pan to the big pot of beans. Add salt, pepper, oregano, bay leaf, and sugar. 
# Boil about another hour, stirring occasionally. Add vinegar and cooking wine. 
# Boil for about another hour to thicken. Add the two tablespoons of olive oil and serve.
# In another large sauce pan, combine rice, four and a half cups of water and two tablespoons of olive oil.
# Bring to a boil then reduce to simmer for about 20 minutes.
# Fluff the rice with a fork once the water has evaporated.

Note: If the beans are too watery, boil until the right consistency. They keep for about a week in the refrigerator – or they freeze well.

==How to serve==
*First option: place a serving of rice on each plate with a ladle full of beans on top. (This is the most common method.)
*Second option: place a serving of rice on each plate and a small side bowl holding a serving of beans for each diner.
*Third option: place a serving of rice on each plate and place the beans in a large serving bowl in the middle of the table.

Encourage your guests to thoroughly mix their individual servings of rice and beans.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The hole is a carrier of positive charge. It is named &quot;hole&quot; because it equivalent to an empty space in the lattice of the conductor where an electron could be. It has the same charge as the electron, but positive. Therefore, the holes move in the same direction as conventional current:

[[image:Hole flow in a conductor.svg|centre]]

Holes do, however, have a different mass, and a different time between colllions and therefore a different mobility, called the '''hole mobility''', ''&amp;mu;&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;''. This is given by:

::&lt;math&gt;\mu_h=\frac{e \tau_h}{m_h}&lt;/math&gt;

To properly model current flow, we should take both electron and hole flow into account:

::&lt;Math&gt;\sigma= e \left(n \mu_e + p \mu_h \right) &lt;/matH&gt;

where
*n is the electron density in ''m&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;''
*p is the hole density in ''m&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;''

::&lt;math&gt;\sigma  = n{{e^2 \tau _e } \over {m_e }} + p{{e^2 \tau _h } \over {m_h }}&lt;/math&gt;
where
*&amp;tau;&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is the electron scatering time in ''s''
*&amp;tau;&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; is the electron scatering time in ''s''
*m&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; is the mass of a hole in ''kg''

      <text xml:space="preserve">== A Typical Type of Problem ==

Most problems you will face are significantly more complicated than the previous problem and the following one. In the engineering world, problems are presented as so-called &quot;word problems&quot;, in which a system is described and the problem must be set up and solved (if possible) from the description. This section will attempt to illustrate through example, step by step, some common techniques and pitfalls in setting up mass balances. Some of the steps may seem somewhat excessive at this point, but if you follow them carefully on this relatively simple problem, you will certainly have an easier time following later steps.

== Single Component in Multiple Processes: a Steam Process ==

{{example| 

A feed stream of pure liquid water enters an evaporator at a rate of 0.5 kg/s. Three streams come from the evaporator: a vapor stream and two liquid streams. The flowrate of the vapor stream was measured to be 4*10^6 L/min and its density was 4 g/m^3. The vapor stream enters a turbine, where it loses enough energy to condense fully and leave as a single stream. One of the liquid streams is discharged as waste, the other is fed into a heat exchanger, where it is cooled. This stream leaves the heat exchanger at a rate of 1500 pounds per hour. Calculate the flow rate of the discharge and the efficiency of the evaporator.
}}

Note that one way to define efficiency is in terms of conversion, which is intended here:

{{box|&lt;math&gt; efficiency = \frac{\dot{m}_{vapor}}{\dot{m}_{feed}} &lt;/math&gt; }}

=== Step 1: Draw a Flowchart ===

The problem as it stands contains an awful lot of text, but it won't mean much until you ''draw what is given to you''. First, ask yourself, what processes are in use in this problem? '''Make a list''' of the processes in the problem:

# Evaporator (A)
# Heat Exchanger (B)
# Turbine    (C)

Once you have a list of all the processes, you need to '''find out how they are connected''' (it'll tell you something like &quot;the vapor stream enters a turbine&quot;). Draw a basic sketch of the processes and their connections, and label the processes. It should look something like this:
[[Image:FlowchartStep1.PNG]]

Remember, we don't care what the actual processes look like, or how they're designed. At this point, we only really label what they are so that we can go back to the problem and know which process they're talking about.

Once all your processes are connected, '''find any streams that are not yet accounted for'''. In this case, we have not drawn the feed stream into the evaporator, the waste stream from the evaporator, or the exit streams from the turbine and heat exchanger.

[[Image:FlowchartStep2.PNG]]

The third step is to '''Label all your flows'''. Label them with any information you are given. Any information you are not given, and even information you are given should be given a different variable. It is usually easiest to give them the same variable as is found in the equation you will be using (for example, if you have an unknown flow rate, call it &lt;math&gt; \dot{m} &lt;/math&gt; so it remains clear what the unknown value is physically. Give each a different subscript corresponding to the number of the feed stream (such as &lt;math&gt; \dot{m_1} &lt;/math&gt; for the feed stream that you call &quot;stream 1&quot;). Make sure you '''include all units''' on the given values!

In the example problem, the flowchart I drew with all flows labeled looked like this:

[[Image:FlowchartStep3.PNG]]

Notice that for one of the streams, a ''volume'' flow rate is given rather than a ''mass'' flow rate, so it is labeled as such. This is very important, so that you avoid using a value in an equation that isn't valid (for example, there's no such thing as &quot;conservation of volume&quot; for most cases)!

The final step in drawing the flowchart is to '''write down any additional given information in terms of the variables you have defined'''. In this problem, the density of the water in the vapor stream is given, so write this on the side for future reference.

Carefully drawn flowcharts and diagrams are half of the key to solving any mass balance, or really a lot of other types of engineering problems. They are just as important as having the right units to getting the right answer.

=== Step 2: Make sure your units are consistent ===

The second step is to make sure all your units are consistent and, if not, to convert everything so that it is. In this case, since the principle that we'll need to use to solve for the flow rate of the waste stream (&lt;math&gt; \dot{m_3} &lt;/math&gt;) is conservation of mass, everything will need to be on a mass-flow basis, and also in the ''same'' mass-flow units.

In this problem, since two of our flow rates are given in metric units (though one is a volumetric flow rate rather than a mass flow rate, so we'll need to change that) and only one in English units, it would save time and minimize mistakes to convert &lt;math&gt; \dot{V_2} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \dot{m_5} &lt;/math&gt; to kg/s.

From the previous section, the equation relating volumetric flowrate to mass flow rate is:

&lt;math&gt; \dot{V}_i*{\rho}_i = \dot{m}_i &lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, we need the density of water vapor in order to calculate the mass flow rate from the volumetric flow rate. Since the density is provided in the problem statement (if it wasn't, we'd need to calculate it with methods described later), the mass flow rate can be calculated:

&lt;math&gt; \dot{V_2} = \frac{4*10^6 \mbox{ L}}{1\mbox{ min}}*\frac{1\mbox{ m}^3}{1000\mbox{ L}}*\frac{1\mbox{ min}}{60 \mbox{ s}} = 66.67 \frac{m^3}{s} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \rho_2 = 4 \frac{g}{m^3} * \frac{1\mbox{ kg}}{1000\mbox{ g}} = 0.004 \frac{kg}{m^3} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \dot{m}_2 = 66.67\frac{m^3}{s} * 0.004 \frac{kg}{m^3} = 0.2666 \frac{kg}{s} &lt;/math&gt;

Note that since the density of a gas is so small, a huge volumetric flow rate is necessary to achieve any significant mass flow rate. This is fairly typical and is a practical problem when dealing with gas-phase processes.

The mass flow rate &lt;math&gt; \dot{m_5} &lt;/math&gt; can be changed in a similar manner, but since it is already in terms of mass (or weight technically), we don't need to apply a density:

&lt;math&gt; \dot{m_5} = 1500\frac{lb}{hr} * \frac{1kg}{2.2lb} * \frac{1hr}{3600s} = 0.1893 \frac{kg}{s} &lt;/math&gt;

Now that everything is in the same system of units, we can proceed to the next step.

=== Step 3: Relate your variables ===

Since we have the mass flow rate of the vapor stream we can calculate the efficiency of the evaporator directly:

&lt;math&gt; efficiency = \frac{\dot{m}_2}{\dot{m}_1} = \frac{0.2666 \frac{kg}{s}}{0.5 \frac{kg}{s}} = 53.3% &lt;/math&gt;

Finding &lt;math&gt; \dot{m_4} &lt;/math&gt;, as asked for in the problem, will be somewhat more difficult. One place to start is to write the mass balance on the evaporator, since that will certainly contain the unknown we seek. Assuming that the process is steady state we can write:

&lt;math&gt; In - Out = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \dot{m}_1 - \dot{m}_2 - \dot{m}_4 - \dot{m}_6 = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

Problem: we don't know &lt;math&gt; \dot{m}_6 &lt;/math&gt; so with only this equation we cannot solve for &lt;math&gt; \dot{m}_4 &lt;/math&gt;. Have no fear, however, because there is another way to figure out what &lt;math&gt; \dot{m}_6 &lt;/math&gt; is... can you figure it out? Try to do so before you move on.

=== So you want to check your guess? Alright then read on. ===

The way to find &lt;math&gt; \dot{m}_6 &lt;/math&gt; is to do a mass balance on the heat exchanger, because the mass balance for the heat exchanger is simply:

&lt;math&gt; \dot{m}_6 - \dot{m}_5 = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

Since we know &lt;math&gt; \dot{m}_5 &lt;/math&gt; we can calculate &lt;math&gt; \dot{m}_6 &lt;/math&gt; and thus the waste stream flowrate &lt;math&gt;\dot{m}_4 &lt;/math&gt;.

{{NOTE|Notice the strategy here: we first start with a balance on the operation containing the stream we need information about. Then we move to balances on other operations in order to garner additional information about the unknowns in the process. This takes '''practice''' to figure out when you have enough information to solve the problem or you need to do more balances or look up information.

It is also of note that '''any process has a limited number of independent balances you can perform'''. This is not as much of an issue with a relatively simple problem like this, but will become an issue with more complex problems. Therefore, a step-by-step method exists to tell you exactly how many independent mass balances you can write on any given process, and therefore how many total independent equations you can use to help you solve problems. }}

=== Step 4: Calculate your unknowns. ===

Carrying out the plan on this problem:

&lt;math&gt; \dot{m}_6 - 0.1893\frac{kg}{s} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \dot{m}_6 = 0.1893 \frac{kg}{s} &lt;/math&gt;

Hence, from the mass balance on the evaporator:

&lt;math&gt; \dot{m}_4 = \dot{m}_1 - \dot{m}_2 - \dot{m}_6 = (0.5 - 0.2666 - 0.1893)\frac{kg}{s} = 0.0441 \frac{kg}{s} &lt;/math&gt;

So the final answers are:

{{box|
&lt;math&gt;\mbox{Evaporator Efficiency} = 53.3% &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \mbox{Waste stream rate} = 0.0441\frac{kg}{s} &lt;/math&gt;}}

=== Step 5: Check your work. ===

Ask: Do these answers make sense? Check for things like negative flow rates, efficiencies higher than 100%, or other physically impossible happenings; if something like this happens (and it will), you did something wrong. Is your exit rate higher than the total inlet rate (since no water is created in the processes, it is impossible for this to occur)? 

In this case, the values make physical sense, so they may be right. It's always good to go back and check the math ''and'' the setup to make sure you didn't forget to convert any units or anything like that.

* 1 teaspoon (5 mL) [[cookbook:sugar|sugar]]
* 1 teaspoon (5 mL) [[cookbook:salt|salt]]
* These are estimates and you should mix the marinade ingredients to taste

== Procedure ==

# Mix vinegar, oil, salt and sugar for the marinade.
# Trim the ends from the cucumbers, peel them and slice them.
# Peel the onion and slice it as thinly as possible.
# Pour the marinade over the cucumbers and onions and mix well.
# Let it sit in a cool place or refrigerate for at least two hours, stirring occasionally.

Serve in a bowl, marinade and all, using salad tongs or a slotted spoon to dish out servings.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
* Any light salad oil may be used. Avoid olive oil as it congeals when refrigerated.
* The cucumber to onion ratio should be from 2:1 to 2.5:1.
* There should be just a hint of oil in the marinade and just enough sugar to take the edge off of the vinegar's tartness.
* For crisper pickles add a spoonful of oregano.

I have been very happy with the book ''Biology with Vernier'' using the same brand data loggers.  The book comes with a CD with teacher and student notes for the labs and are in word document so it's easy to edit them to make them OK for the IB Internal Assessment (namely not giving the students too much info).  The students get reasonable results and can do DCP and CE labs with the results.

&lt;small&gt;(This practical is placed here more as a bookmark than as a real example of work. I am still testing out this wiki idea. Steve). &lt;small&gt;


This simple practical is good in the early stages of the DP Bio course as an introduction to the IA methods and write-up procedure. Students are given a culture of yeast cells in sugar and water, a microscope and a haemocytometer. The method is given to them, so it is not suitable for Planning (a) or Planning (b). 


== Instructions == 


'''AIM:''' To produce a population growth curve of yeast cells in liquid nutrient medium. 


'''MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT:'''
* Activated yeast culture
* Microscope and haemocytometer
* Incubator 
* Dropping pipettes, distilled water, 1 x 100ml beaker. 


'''METHOD IN BRIEF:''' 
* Instruct students in use of the haemocytometer and calculations required. 
* Cell counts are made on a daily basis for 1 week, and recorded on a population growth curve.

== Teachers' Reflections ==

''Having tried this practical a number of times, I have found it useful for diagnosing new DP students' lab skills, approaches to the write-up procedure and graph-drawing skills. Naturally, as a first 'assessed' practical, it wouldn't normally be considered for moderation, though in some cases it has been completed to a high standard.''     Steve

See also the Wikibook [[Special relativity]] that contains an in-depth text on this subject.
===The principle of relativity===
If we use an [[wikipedia:Inertial frame of reference|''inertial system'']] (a.k.a. inertial coordinate system, inertial frame of reference, or inertial reference frame), then the components &lt;math&gt;x,y,z&lt;/math&gt; of the position of any freely moving classical object (&quot;point mass&quot;) change by equal amounts &lt;math&gt;\Delta x,\Delta y,\Delta z&lt;/math&gt; in equal time intervals&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\Delta t.&lt;/math&gt; Evidently, if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_1&lt;/math&gt; is an inertial frame then so is a reference frame &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_2&lt;/math&gt; that is, relative to&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_1,&lt;/math&gt;

# shifted (&quot;translated&quot;) in space by any distance and/or in any direction,
# translated in time by any interval,
# rotated by any angle about any axis, and/or
# moving with any constant velocity.

The ''principle of relativity'' states that all inertial systems are &quot;created equal&quot;: the laws of physics are the same as long as they are formulated with respect to an inertial frame — no matter which. (Describing the same physical event or state of affairs using different inertial systems is like saying the same thing in different languages.) The first three items tell us that one inertial frame is as good as any other frame as long as the other frame differs by a shift of the coordinate origin in space and/or time and/or by a rotation of the spatial coordinate axes. What matters in physics are ''relative'' positions (the positions of objects relative to each other), ''relative'' times (the times of events relative to each other), and ''relative'' orientations (the orientations of objects relative to each other), inasmuch as these are unaffected by translations in space and/or time and by rotations of the spatial axes. In the physical world, there are no absolute positions, absolute times, or absolute orientations.

The fourth item tells us, in addition, that one inertial frame is as good as any other frame as long as the two frames move with a constant velocity relative to each other. What matters are relative velocities (the velocities of objects relative to each other), inasmuch as these are unaffected by a coordinate ''boost'' — the switch from an inertial frame&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; to a frame moving with a constant velocity relative to&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}.&lt;/math&gt; In the physical world, there are no absolute velocities and, in particular, ''there is no absolute rest''.

It stands to reason. For one thing, positions are properties of objects, not things that exist even when they are not &quot;occupied&quot; or possessed. For another, the positions of objects are defined relative to the positions of other objects. In a universe containing a single object, there is no position that one could attribute to that object. By the same token, all physically meaningful times are the times of physical events, and they too are relatively defined, as the times ''between'' events. In a universe containing a single event, there is not time that one could attribute to that event. But if positions and times are relatively defined, then so are velocities.

That there is no such thing as absolute rest has not always been as obvious as it should have been. Two ideas were responsible for the erroneous notion that there is a special class of inertial frames defining &quot;rest&quot; in an absolute sense: the idea that electromagnetic effects are transmitted by waves, and the idea that these waves require a physical medium (dubbed &quot;ether&quot;) for their propagation. If there were such a medium, one could define absolute rest as equivalent to being at rest with respect to it.

== Overview ==

'''''Diffindo''''' is a destructive spell. It can be used to make seams rip and books separate from their bindings; its effects can be reversed by the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Reparo|Reparo]] charm.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] first uses this spell in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']] to separate [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cedric Diggory|Cedric Diggory]] from a clutch of his friends, by causing the seam on his bag to split. Cedric has to stop to collect his books, which gives Harry a chance to speak to him privately.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']], Harry uses this spell to keep his copy of the Half-Blood Prince's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Potions|Potions]] book. When his own copy of the book arrives from Flourish and Blotts, Harry uses the Diffindo charm to separate the covers from the text of both his new book and the Prince's book, swaps covers, and then uses Reparo to repair both. In this way he can return a book to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn]] that looks like the one he borrowed, but keep the incredibly useful marginal notes of the Prince.&lt;!-- Commented out pending check in the original text: Harry also uses this spell in the deathly hallows part 1 after misteriously finding the sword of Gryffindor in the bottem of a pond. He uses the spell to brake the ice so he can dive in and retreive the sword.--&gt;

== Analysis ==

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] is, of course, scandalized at any use of magic for destructive purposes; in particular, when this spell is used on a book, she is horrified.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Lorentz transformations (general form)===

We want to express the coordinates &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}=(x,y,z)&lt;/math&gt; of an inertial frame&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_1&lt;/math&gt; in terms of the coordinates &lt;math&gt;t'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}'=(x',y',z')&lt;/math&gt; of another inertial frame&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_2.&lt;/math&gt; We will assume that the two frames meet the following conditions:

&lt;br&gt;
# their spacetime coordinate origins coincide (&lt;math&gt;t'{=}0,\mathbf{r}'{=}0&lt;/math&gt; mark the same spacetime location as &lt;math&gt;t{=}0,\mathbf{r}{=}0&lt;/math&gt;),
# their space axes are parallel, and
# &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_2&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;moves with a constant velocity&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{w}&lt;/math&gt; relative to&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_1.&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;br&gt;What we know at this point is that whatever moves with a constant velocity in&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_1&lt;/math&gt; will do so in&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_2.&lt;/math&gt; It follows that the transformation &lt;math&gt;t,\mathbf{r}\rightarrow t',\mathbf{r}'&lt;/math&gt; maps straight lines in&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_1&lt;/math&gt; onto straight lines in&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_2.&lt;/math&gt; Coordinate lines of&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_1,&lt;/math&gt; in particular, will be mapped onto straight lines in&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_2.&lt;/math&gt; This tells us that the dashed coordinates are linear combinations of the undashed ones,

&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
t'=A\,t+\mathbf{B}\cdot\mathbf{r},\qquad \mathbf{r}'=C\,\mathbf{r}+(\mathbf{D}\cdot\mathbf{r})\mathbf{w}+\,t.&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;br&gt;We also know that the transformation from &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_1&lt;/math&gt; to&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_2&lt;/math&gt; can only depend on&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{w},&lt;/math&gt; so &lt;math&gt;A,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B},&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;C,&lt;/math&gt; and&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{D}&lt;/math&gt; are functions of&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{w}.&lt;/math&gt; Our task is to find these functions. The real-valued functions &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; actually can depend only on &lt;math&gt;w=|\mathbf{w}|={}_+\sqrt{\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{w}},&lt;/math&gt; so &lt;math&gt;A=a(w)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C=c(w).&lt;/math&gt; A vector function depending only on &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{w}&lt;/math&gt; must be parallel (or antiparallel) to&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{w},&lt;/math&gt; and its magnitude must be a function of&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;w.&lt;/math&gt; We can therefore write &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}=b(w)\,\mathbf{w},&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{D}=[d(w)/w^2]\mathbf{w},&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;=e(w)\,\mathbf{w}.&lt;/math&gt; (It will become clear in a moment why the factor &lt;math&gt;w^{-2}&lt;/math&gt; is included in the definition of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{D}.&lt;/math&gt;) So,

&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
t'=a(w)\,t+b(w)\,\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{r},\qquad \mathbf{r}'=\displaystyle c(w)\,\mathbf{r}+ d(w){\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{r}\over w^2}\mathbf{w}+e(w)\,\mathbf{w}\,t.&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;br&gt;Let's set &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; equal to &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{w} t.&lt;/math&gt; This implies that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}'=(c+d+e)\mathbf{w} t.&lt;/math&gt; As we are looking at the trajectory of an object at rest in&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_2,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}'&lt;/math&gt; must be constant. Hence,

:&lt;math&gt;
c+d+e=0.&lt;/math&gt;

Let's write down the inverse transformation. Since &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_1&lt;/math&gt; moves with velocity &lt;math&gt;-\mathbf{w}&lt;/math&gt; relative to &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_2,&lt;/math&gt; it is

&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
t=a(w)\,t'-b(w)\,\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{r}',\qquad \mathbf{r}=\displaystyle c(w)\,\mathbf{r}'+ d(w){\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{r}'\over w^2}\mathbf{w}-e(w)\,\mathbf{w}\,t'.&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;br&gt;To make life easier for us, we now chose the space axes so that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{w}=(w,0,0).&lt;/math&gt; Then the above two (mutually inverse) transformations simplify to

&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
t'=at+bwx,\quad x'=cx+dx+ewt,\quad y'=cy,\quad z'=cz,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
t=at'-bwx',\quad x=cx'+dx'-ewt',\quad y=cy',\quad z=cz'.&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;br&gt;Plugging the first transformation into the second, we obtain

&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
t=a(at+bwx)-bw(cx+dx+ewt)=(a^2-bew^2)t+(abw-bcw-bdw)x,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
x=c(cx+dx+ewt)+d(cx+dx+ewt)-ew(at+bwx)&lt;/math&gt;
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;=(c^2+2cd+d^2-bew^2)x+(cew+dew-aew)t,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
y=c^2y,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
z=c^2z.&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;br&gt;The first of these equations tells us that

:&lt;math&gt;
a^2-bew^2=1&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;abw-bcw-bdw=0.&lt;/math&gt;

The second tells us that

:&lt;math&gt;
c^2+2cd+d^2-bew^2=1&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;cew+dew-aew=0.&lt;/math&gt;

Combining &lt;math&gt;abw-bcw-bdw=0&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;c+d+e=0&lt;/math&gt; (and taking into account that &lt;math&gt;w\neq0&lt;/math&gt;), we obtain &lt;math&gt;b(a+e)=0.&lt;/math&gt;

Using &lt;math&gt;c+d+e=0&lt;/math&gt; to eliminate&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;d,&lt;/math&gt; we obtain &lt;math&gt;e^2-bew^2=1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;e(a+e)=0.&lt;/math&gt;

Since the first of the last two equations implies that &lt;math&gt;e\neq0,&lt;/math&gt; we gather from the second that &lt;math&gt;e=-a.&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;y=c^2y&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;tells us that &lt;math&gt;c^2=1.&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;must, in fact, be equal to&amp;nbsp;1, since we have assumed that the space axes of the two frames a parallel (rather than antiparallel).

With &lt;math&gt;c=1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;e=-a,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;c+d+e=0&lt;/math&gt; yields &lt;math&gt;d=a-1.&lt;/math&gt; Upon solving &lt;math&gt;e^2-bew^2=1&lt;/math&gt; for&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;b,&lt;/math&gt; we are left with expressions for &lt;math&gt;b, c, d,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; depending solely on&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;
b={1-a^2\over aw^2},\quad c=1,\quad d=a-1,\quad e=-a.&lt;/math&gt;

Quite an improvement!

To find the remaining function &lt;math&gt;a(w),&lt;/math&gt; we consider a third inertial frame&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_3,&lt;/math&gt; which moves with velocity &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}=(v,0,0)&lt;/math&gt; relative to&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_2. &lt;/math&gt; Combining the transformation from &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_1&lt;/math&gt; to&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_2,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
t'=a(w)\,t+{1-a^2(w)\over a(w)\,w}x,\qquad x'=a(w)\,x-a(w)\,wt,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;br&gt;with the transformation from &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_2&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_3,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
t''=a(v)\,t'+\frac{1-a^2(v)}{a(v)\,v}x',\qquad x''=a(v)\,x'-a(v)\,vt',&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;br&gt;we obtain the transformation from &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_1&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_3&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
t''=a(v)\left[a(w)\,t+{1-a^2(w)\over a(w)\,w}x\right]+{1-a^2(v)\over a(v)\,v} \Bigl[a(w)\,x-a(w)\,wt\Bigr]&lt;/math&gt;
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;
=\underbrace{\left[a(v)\,a(w)-{1-a^2(v)\over a(v)\,v}a(w)\,w\right]}_{\textstyle\star}t+ \Bigl[\dots\Bigr]\,x,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
x''=a(v)\Bigl[a(w)\,x-a(w)\,wt\Bigr]-a(v)\,v\left[a(w)\,t+{1-a^2(w)\over a(w)\,w}x\right]&lt;/math&gt;
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;
=\underbrace{\left[a(v)\,a(w)-a(v)\,v{1-a^2(w)\over a(w)\,w}\right]}_{\textstyle\star\,\star}x-\Bigl[\dots\Bigr]\,t.&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;br&gt;The direct transformation from &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_1&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_3&lt;/math&gt; must have the same form as the transformations from &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_1&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_2&lt;/math&gt; and from &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_2&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_3&lt;/math&gt;, namely

&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
t''=\underbrace{a(u)}_{\textstyle\star}t+{1-a^2(u)\over a(u)\,u}\,x,\qquad x''=\underbrace{a(u)}_{\textstyle\star\,\star}x-a(u)\,ut,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;br&gt;where &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is the speed of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_3&lt;/math&gt; relative to&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_1.&lt;/math&gt; Comparison of the coefficients marked with stars yields two expressions for&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;a(u),&lt;/math&gt; which of course must be equal:

&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
a(v)\,a(w)-{1-a^2(v)\over a(v)\,v}a(w)\,w=a(v)\,a(w)-a(v)\,v{1-a^2(w)\over a(w)\,w}.&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;br&gt;It follows that &lt;math&gt;\bigl[1-a^2(v)\bigr]\,a^2(w)w^2=\bigl[1-a^2(w)\bigr]\,a^2(v)v^2,&lt;/math&gt; and this tells us that

&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
K={1-a^2(w)\over a^2(w)\,w^2}={1-a^2(v)\over a^2(v)\,v^2}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;br&gt;is a universal constant. Solving the first equality for &lt;math&gt;a(w),&lt;/math&gt; we obtain

:&lt;math&gt;
a(w)=1/\sqrt{1+Kw^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

This allows us to cast the transformation

:&lt;math&gt;
t'=at+bwx,\quad x'=cx+dx+ewt,\quad y'=cy,\quad z'=cz,&lt;/math&gt;

into the form


:&lt;math&gt;
t'={t+Kwx\over\sqrt{1+Kw^2}},\quad x'={x-wt\over\sqrt{1+Kw^2}},\quad y'=y,\quad z'=z.&lt;/math&gt;


Trumpets, please! We have managed to reduce five unknown functions to a single constant.

[[w:make (software)|make]] is a utility for building applications. This tutorial will teach you how to use this utility with Makefiles. This tutorial is primarily focused on GNU make.

==Hand compilation==
Before we start talking about &quot;make&quot;, let's first describe the build process used long ago: &quot;hand compilation&quot;, aka &quot;manual build&quot;. That processes isn't too bad if you only have one or two source files. A simple compilation process would be by typing the following code by hand:
&lt;source lang=bash&gt;
 g++ -o file file.cpp
&lt;/source&gt;
For beginners, this might take a while to get used to. As an alternative, using make the command would be:&lt;source lang=bash&gt;
 make file&lt;/source&gt;
Both commands will do the same thing - take the file.cpp source file, compile it and then link it into an executable.
But where the problem comes in is where the user has to use more than one source file, or is dependent on libraries. Making an [[w:SDL|SDL]] application might consist of something like this:&lt;source lang=bash&gt;
 g++ `sdl-config --cflags` -o file file.cpp&lt;/source&gt;
This is getting harder to remember, isn't it?
Let's add some optimisation:&lt;source lang=bash&gt;
 g++ -O3 -fomit-frame-pointer `sdl-config --cflags` -o file file.cpp
&lt;/source&gt;
Do you really want to type that whole command line every time you make the tiniest edit to your source files?
This is where make comes in - it will save your time!

==Basics==
A make file works as a simple dependency tree - it does compile the stuff that is outdated and then links your software together. You will have to specify the compilation options, but they will not be as tough on you anymore.
A simple makefile for compiling your application:

'''Makefile'''
&lt;source lang=make&gt;
 default: myapp
 myapp:
 	g++ -o file file.cpp
&lt;/source&gt;
To compile your application, you may do:&lt;source lang=bash&gt;
 make&lt;/source&gt;
or:&lt;source lang=bash&gt;
 make myapp&lt;/source&gt;
Well, you may now ask, how much of use is this? I can make a shell script for this myself! So lets now work on multiple files and object files - your application is big enough to be linked now: it contains five files.
===The Test Case===
Globally, there are three functions present:
 int main(); (file1.cpp)
 void file2function(std::string from); (file2.cpp)
 void file3function(std::string from); (file3.cpp)
File2 and file3 have their header files, so they could be inter-linked. The actual application will look like this:

'''file1.cpp'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
 #include &quot;file2.h&quot;
 #include &quot;file3.h&quot;
 int main()
 {
 	file2function(&quot;main&quot;);
 	file3function(&quot;main&quot;);
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

'''file2.h'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
 #include &lt;string&gt;
 #include &lt;iostream&gt;
 #include &quot;file3.h&quot;
 void file2function(std::string source);
&lt;/source&gt;

'''file2.cpp'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
 #include &quot;file2.h&quot;
 void file2function(std::string from)
 {
 	std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;File 2 function was called from &quot; &lt;&lt; from &lt;&lt; std::endl;
 	file3function(&quot;file2&quot;);
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

'''file3.h'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
 #include &lt;string&gt;
 #include &lt;iostream&gt;
 #include &quot;file2.h&quot;
 void file3function(std::string source);
&lt;/source&gt;

'''file3.cpp'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
 #include &quot;file3.h&quot;
 void file3function(std::string from)
 {
 	std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;File 3 function was called from &quot; &lt;&lt; from &lt;&lt; std::endl;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

So, how would I link this all up? Well, the most basic way is to do it all by hand:&lt;source lang=bash&gt;
 g++ -c -o file2.o file2.cpp
 g++ -c -o file3.o file3.cpp
 g++ -o file1 file1.cpp file2.o file3.o&lt;/source&gt;
However, make would offer a simpler way, '''Makefile''':

'''Makefile'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;make&quot;&gt;
default: testcase
testcase: file2.o file3.o
	g++ -o file1 file1.cpp file2.o file3.o
&lt;/source&gt;

Pretty different, eh? There's a different approach to do this, which is what makes ''make'' so good:

'''Makefile'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;make&quot;&gt;
# Create the executable &quot;file1&quot; from all the source files.
COMPILER=g++
OBJS=file1.o file2.o file3.o
default: testcase
testcase: $(OBJS)
	$(COMPILER) -o file1 $(OBJS)
&lt;/source&gt;

How easy is it to expand now? Just add a file to the OBJS list and you're done!

This is a complete makefile that handles the complete process of converting several source files (and creating a bunch of &quot;.o&quot; files as an intermediate step) into the final &quot;file1&quot; executable.

Good programmers put human-readable comments (lines starting with the &quot;#&quot; character)
in the makefile
to describe
why the makefile was written and
what ''make'' is intended to do with this makefile
(which, alas, is not always what actually happens).

== Advanced make ==

=== Long Lines ===

Some statements in a makefile can be very long. To make them easier to read, some programmers break up long statements into
several shorter, easier-to-read physical lines. Many consoles displayed 80 characters across, which is the threshold some programmers use for breaking up lines and comments.

In short, a programmer may decide it looks nicer to writes several short physical lines that together compose one statement, like this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;make&quot;&gt;
some really long line \
with, like, \
a bajillion parameters and \
several file names \
and stuff
&lt;/source&gt;

Rather than the same statement, crammed into a single physical line:
&lt;source lang=&quot;make&quot;&gt;
some really long line with, like, a bajillion parameters and several file names and stuff
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Make Clean ===
When you type &quot;make clean&quot; from the command prompt, &quot;make&quot; deletes all the files that you specified were easily-replaceable files -- i.e., the intermediate and output files generated from your irreplaceable hand-written source files.

To tell &quot;make&quot; that some file is a easily-replaceable file, add it to the &quot;rm&quot; line of the &quot;clean&quot; section of your makefile, and that file will be deleted *every* time you type &quot;make clean&quot; at the command prompt.
(If you don't already have a &quot;clean&quot; section in your makefile, add a section to the end of your makefile that looks like the following):

&lt;source lang=&quot;make&quot;&gt;
.PHONY: clean
clean:
	rm *.o
	rm file
&lt;/source&gt;

In this example, we've told &quot;make&quot; that all intermediate object files (&quot;*.o&quot;) and the final executable (&quot;file&quot;) are safe-to-delete, easily-regenerated files.

Typically a programmer periodically runs &quot;make clean&quot;, then archives *every* file in the directory, and then runs &quot;make&quot; to regenerate every file.
Then he tests the program executable, confident that the program he is testing can be easily regenerated entirely from the files in the archive.

===Variables===

&quot;make&quot; accepts three ways of setting variables.
* ''Recursively expanded variables'' are defined by using &lt;code&gt;variable = value&lt;/code&gt;. This means if one variable 'x' contains references to another variable 'y', and 'y' changes after the 'x' being defined, 'y' will include the change made to 'x'.
&lt;source lang=&quot;make&quot;&gt;
x = abc
y = $(x)ghi
x = abcdef
# x will be abcdef, while y will be abcdefghi
&lt;/source&gt;

* ''Simply expanded variables'' are defined by using &lt;code&gt;variable := value&lt;/code&gt;. This means if one variable 'x' contains references to another variable 'y', the 'y' variable will be scanned for once and for all.
&lt;source lang=&quot;make&quot;&gt;
x := abc
y := $(x)ghi
# x is 'abc' at this time
x := abcdef
# x will be abcdef, while y will be abcghi
&lt;/source&gt;

* If you just want to make sure a variable is set, you can use &lt;code&gt;variable ?= value&lt;/code&gt;. If the variable is already set, then the definition will not be run; if not, then 'variable' will be set as 'value'.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/ &quot;GNU Make Manual&quot;]
section &quot;6.2 The Two Flavors of Variables&quot;.
&lt;/ref&gt;

== File Names With Special Characters ==

Many programmers recommend not creating files with spaces or dollar signs in them, in order to avoid the 'spaces in file names' error in &quot;make&quot; and many other utilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;graham&quot; &gt;
John Graham-Cumming.
[http://www.cmcrossroads.com/ask-mr-make/7859-gnu-make-meets-file-names-with-spaces-in-them &quot;GNU Make meets file names with spaces in them&quot;].
CM Crossroads 2007.
&lt;/ref&gt;

If you must deal with a file that has spaces or dollar signs in the file name (such as the file &quot;my $0.02 program.c&quot;),
sometimes you can escape the literal name of the file with double slashes and double dollar signs—in the Makefile, that filename can be represented as
&quot;my\\ $$0.02\\ program.c&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
John Graham-Cumming.
[http://www.cmcrossroads.com/ask-mr-make/8442-gnu-make-escaping-a-walk-on-the-wild-side &quot;GNU Make escaping: a walk on the wild side&quot;]
CM Crossroads 2007.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Alas, the double-slash escape doesn't work when &quot;make&quot; works with lists of files (which are internally represented as space-separated filenames).
One work-around is to refer to that file name using a space-free representation like &quot;my+$$0.02+program.c&quot;,
then later in the make file use the $(subst) function to convert that space-free representation back to the actual on-disk file name.&lt;ref name=&quot;graham&quot; /&gt;
Alas, this work-around can't handle filenames that include both spaces and plus-signs.

Perhaps it's simplest to avoid filenames with spaces in them as inputs or outputs of &quot;make&quot;.

== Name of the makefile ==

When creating a new makefile, give it the literal name &quot;&lt;code&gt;Makefile&lt;code&gt;&quot; (8 characters, no extension).

In principle, you could create a makefile with some other name,
such as &lt;code&gt;makefile&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;GNUmakefile&lt;/code&gt;,
which (like &lt;code&gt;Makefile&lt;/code&gt;) are automatically found by the GNU version of the &lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt; utility,
or some other name that you pass to the ''make'' utility with the &lt;code&gt;--file&lt;/code&gt; option.&lt;ref&gt;

The '''beet armyworm''' (''Spodoptera exigua'') is one of the most well-known agricultural pest insects. It is also known as the '''asparagus fern caterpillar''', and the adult moth is known in the UK (where it is an immigrant and not known to breed) as the '''small mottled willow'''. It is native to Asia, but has been introduced worldwide and is now found almost anywhere its many host crops are grown. 

The wide host range of the beet armyworm includes [[../asparagus/]], [[../bean/]]s and [[../pea/]]s, sugar and table [[../beet/]]s, [[../celery/]], [[../cole crops/]], [[../lettuce/]], [[../potato/]], tomato, cotton, cereals, oilseeds, tobacco, many flowers, and a multitude of weed species. The beet armyworm does not tolerate cold. It can overwinter in warm areas, such as Florida and Hawaii, but in colder areas it dies off during the winter and the region is reinvaded by the adult moth as the weather warms and crop plants sprout.

==Description==
The caterpillars are greenish-brown cutworms, soft and bulging caterpillars with dark longitudinal stripes. The adult is a drab brown or gray moth 2 to 3 cm in wingspan.

==Symptoms and Signs==
The larvae feed on the foliage of plants, and can completely defoliate small ones. Smaller larvae devour the parenchyma of leaves, so that all that remains is the thin epidermis and veins.  Larger larvae tend to burrow holes through thick areas of plants. For example, they will burrow straight into a head of lettuce rather than neatly removing tissue from one particular leaf. This renders the produce unmarketable. They attack buds and new growth on plants, preventing flowers from opening, new leaves from sprouting, and vegetables from developing. As the smaller larvae move about they leave strands of silk behind, netting the leaves with a silvery film.

==Ecology==
Overwinters only in warm climates, but migrates during the growing season.

The '''Japanese beetle''' is a scarab beetle which is present throughout much or North America as an invasive species. It can be a devastating pest of both crops and gardens, especially as they tend to occur in large numbers.

As the name suggests, the beetle is native to Japan, where it is a relatively minor pest due to the presence of natural predators. The insect was first found in the United States in 1916 in a nursery near Riverton, New Jersey.  It is thought that beetle larvae entered the United States in a shipment of Iris bulbs prior to 1912 when inspections of agricultural commodities entering the country began.

==Life cycle== 
The larvae live in the soil, where they feed on roots, particularly those of turfgrasses. Adults emerge in early summer, feeding on flowers and leaves. Eggs are laid in late summer, and larvae begin feeding, burrowing deep to overwinter.

==Description==
The '''Japanese beetle''' (''Popillia japonica'') is a beetle about 1.5 cm (0.6 inches) long and 1 cm (0.4 inches) wide, with shiny copper-colored elytra and a shiny green top of the thorax and head.  It is not very destructive in Japan, where it is controlled by natural enemies, but in America it is a serious pest to rose bushes, grapes, crape myrtles, and other plants. It is a weak flyer and drops several centimeters when it hits a wall. 

Japanese beetles have a curious, identifying defense; they lift their hind legs up in the air, even when simply approached. These hind legs are spiny, and the behavior is probably intended to ward off predators.

==Symptoms and Signs==
Adults skeletonize leaves and flower petals, leaving only the veins behind. Heavy infestations can completely denude even large trees.

Larvae eat the roots of grasses, causing dead patches in lawns as the tops die off.

==Ecology==
[[Image:Jbmap.gif|thumb|Map showing the parts of the United States currently infested by Japanese beetles.]]
The life cycle of the beetle is typically 1 year in most parts of the United States, but this can be extended in cooler climates; for instance, in its native Japan, the beetle's life cycle is 2 years long as a result of the higher latitudes of the grasslands required for the larval stage.

==Control==   
During the larval stage, the Japanese beetle lives in lawns and other grasslands, where it eats the roots of grasses.  During that stage, it is susceptible to a fatal disease called milky spore disease, caused by a bacterium called milky spore, ''[[../Bacillus popilliae/]].''  The USDA developed this biological control and it is commercially available in powder form for application to lawn areas.  Standard applications (low density across a broad area) take from 1 to 5 years to establish maximal protection against larval survival (depending on climate), expanding through the soil through repeated rounds of infection, in-host multiplication, release from killed host, and infection.  Typically proper application can lead to a 15-20 year period of protection.&lt;ref name=milkyspore&gt;Klein, Michael (August 1998). [http://www.entomology.wisc.edu/mbcn/fea508.html Japanese beetle: the continuing struggle to achieve successful biological control]. ''Midwest Biological Control News'', '''V'''(8). Retrieved July 11, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Soil-bound larvae are also susceptible to certain members of the nematode families ''Steinernematidae'' and ''Heterorhabditidae''.  As with milky spore, commercial preparations of these nematode varieties are available.

The primary natural predator found in Japan is the [[w:winsome fly]] (''[[Istocheta]] (or Hyperecteina) aldrichi''), a parasitic fly.  Attempts at establishing this predator in the United States have met with limited success, primarily in New England.  Alternative predators have shown some potential at serving as biological controls, such as the [[w:Spring tiphia]] (''Tiphia vernalis'') and [[w:Fall tiphia]] (''Tiphia popilliavora'') from China and Korea.  Also, certain birds (such as the meadowlark and cardinal) and small mammals are significant predators on the adult form.

On field crops such as eggplant, floating row covers can be used to exclude the beetles, however this may necessitate hand pollination of flowers. Kaolin sprays can also be used as barriers.

Research performed by many US extension service branches has shown that pheromone traps may attract more beetles than they catch, and so they have fallen out of favor.&lt;ref name=&quot;trap&quot;&gt;Japanese Beetle control strategies [http://www.pueblo.gsa.gov/cic_text/housing/japanese-beetle/jbeetle.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Natural repellents include [[../Nepeta|catnip]], [[../Allium schenophrasum|chives]], [[../Allium sativum|garlic]], and [[../Tanacetum vulgaris|tansy]]&lt;ref name=&quot;repellents&quot;&gt;http://www.selfsufficientish.com/pests.htm&lt;/ref&gt;, as well as the remains of dead beetles.

=== Anesthesia ===
;Local Anesthesia
*CNS Response usually biphasic - stimulation then depression.
*Cardiovascular effects are usually depression.
*'''Cocaine''': (esther) 3mg/kg toxicity or 200mg.  Causes htn, immediate onset with duration 45min
*'''Lidocaine''': (amide) 4mg/kg s epi, 7mg/kg with epi toxicity.  CNS depression then arrhythmia
*'''Epinephrine''': max 10cc of 1:100,000 over 10mins with halothane
*Most common complication of V3 block is cheek hematoma.

'''Halothane''': sensitizes myocardium to catecholamines (epi).  Caution.

'''Ecothiopates''': (for glaucoma), are cholinesterase inhibitiors. Don't use succinylcholine.

;Malignant Hyperthermia
*Triggers: succinylcholine, halthone, ethrane, forane
*1:50k adults, 1:15k kid
*Signs: increased CO2, HR, RR, temperature, muscle rigidity
*Pathophysiology: incr Ca++ release from sarcoplasm w/ incr excitation-contraction coupling
*Rx: '''dantrolene''', procainamide, O2, insulin, glucose, lasix, bicarbonate

=Connotations Of The Text=

One of Catullus' most famous and emotional poems he talks about the contrasting feelings of love that are tormenting him.

==='''Line 1'''===

*'''''odi et amo - I hate and I love'''''

This reveals the stark contrast in his relationship. The emphatic postion of ''odi'' makes it stand out to the reader.

==='''Line 2'''===

*'''''excrucior - i am tortured; tormented''''' 

This has various meanings and we can see the English derivative of it - excruciating. In fact the word is derived from the Latin '''''crux''''' meaning cross, and '''''ex''''' which means from, out of.
Literally it means ''a cross out of'' and came to mean ''crucify'' - the idea of pulling a person into the shape of a cross for torture.

*'''''fieri - it is done to me'''''

This is the passive of the verb to do. This means ''done to me'' and presents the idea of the loss of control in his life, and more importantly the relationship.

=Vocabulary=

===Line 1===

*'''[[wikt:odisse|odi]], odisse, osus sum''' - dislike intently; hate

*'''[[wikt:requirere|requiro]], -ere, requisi(v)i, requisitum''' - ask; enquire after

===Line 2===

*'''[[wikt:fio|fio]], fieri, factus sum''' - ''(pass. of facio)'' to be made; become; happen

*'''[[wikt:exruciare|excrucio]], -are, -avi, -atum - torture; distress; crucify

=Connotations Of The Text=

===Line 2===

*'''''si fas est - if it is right to say'''''

This is referring to the Gods, and trying to avoid blasphemy because [[w:Catullus|Catullus]] is indicating that the man in the poem is ''better'' than a god.

===Line 3===

*'''''identidem - again and again'''''

This conveys the poet's jealousy of the man being able to see and hear [[w:Lesbia|Lesbia]] over and over again.

*'''''sedens - sitting'''''

This shows just how much Catullus needs Lesbia to please him. Just sitting with her is enough to make him happy, rather than requiring closer contact.

===Line 4===

*'''''spectat et audit - seeing and hearing'''''

The two verbs are emphasised by their postions in the short line. The use of the two main senses, seeing and hearing indicates his wish to see and hear Lesbia.

===Line 12===

*'''''gemina nocte - twin night'''''

This is an original way of saying that he cannot see. I.E. blindness brought on by Lesbia's stunning beauty.

=Extra Notes=

===Line 7===

*'''''vocis in ore - of my voice remains in my mouth'''''

This line is a reconstructed line based on the metre, the original Sappho from which the poem is from and the sense of the last line. The language and grammar also fits. The person who suggested this was a German translator Döring.

===Lines 13-16===

*This is thought to be part of another poem as there is clearly a break in the sense. However, the ancient monk who was copying this, may have copied the beginning of another poem on to the end of this one, resulting in the confusion.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Electrons, although classically considered to be particles, can be shown to bahave like waves as well. This is extremely important as it allows a whole new apporach to analysiing the behaviour of electrons. The so-called two-slit experiment demonstrates the wave-like properties of the electron:

*[[/The Two-Slit Experiment|The Two-Slit Experiment]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">The two-slit experiment is an extremely important experiment as it demonstrates electrons behaving as waves, rather than as classical particles (like bullets or stones). It also reveals a very important property of the &quot;unknowable&quot; behaviour of quantum particles. 

We will start off by looking at the [[/Ideal|two slit experiment for an ideal wave]]. There is no &quot;quantum wierdness&quot; in this description - it is a classical wave superposition problem, and has been observed for light since about 1800, when Thomas Young performed the experiment.

Once you have seen how light behaves, move on to [[/Electrons|electron diffraction]].

=Connotations of The Text=

===Line 1===

*'''''Acme - prime; flower; zenith'''''

This implies that Acme is the best a man can get. The usage of the [[w:Greek|Greek]] word 'Akmen' which means top or best of serves only as flattery. Acme is probably most famous in the cartoon, Wylie Coyote, as Acme is the provider of his useless weapons. The name is directly from the Greek, and used, in this case for a comic effect.

===Line 22===

*'''''Syrias Britanniasque -  Syrians and Britains'''''

This could refer to the great campiagns of [[w:Crassus|Crassus]] and [[w:Caesar|Caesar]] in [[w:Syria|Syria]] and [[w:Britain|Britain]] respectively. Thousands of young men would sign up for the army for the chance of riches, in the form of plunder and even slaves that could be kept or sold. The invasions were of Britian in 55 and 54 BC and the campaigns of Crassus were in Syria in 80 BC. The context of the poem is indicating that Septimius is giving up a great opportunity to be with Acme.

'''Tofu bacon''' is easy to make.  It can be used interchangeably with bacon in most recipes.  Great with breakfast or in a B.L.T.

== Ingredients ==
* 1 block extra firm tofu
* 3 tbsp vegetable oil
* 3 tbsp soy sauce or tamari
* 3 tbsp nutritional yeast
* Liquid smoke (optional)

== Procedure ==

#Slice the tofu into thin strips (as bacon) and fry in a pan on medium, turning once, until crispy and gold brown on each side.
#Add soy sauce and one to two drops of liquid smoke (available in any large grocery store), toss with the tofu bacon slices, coat with nutritional yeast, and remove from heat.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This report contains one check for each supplier that is receiving payment.  Each check pays all or part of one or more invoices.  Each check consists of two parts: the negotiable portion and the remittance advice.  The negotiable portion includes the supplier's name, the amount of the check and the date as well as information identifying the bank and account on which the check is drawn.  The supplier presents it to their bank to begin the process of transferring funds from the enterprise's account to theirs.  The remittance advice lists every invoice that is being paid along with the amount that is being paid.  The supplier keeps this portion of the check for their records.

'''Apricot Wine'''

==Ingredients==

* 1 [[Cookbook:Pound|pound]] [[Cookbook:Apricot|dried apricots]]
* 4 [[Cookbook:Quart|quarts]] [[Cookbook:Water|warm water]]
* 6½ [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] [[Cookbook:Sugar|granulated sugar]]
* 2¼ cups brown sugar
* 1½ cups [[Cookbook:Raisin|raisins]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemons]], sliced thin
* 2 [[Cookbook:Orange|oranges]]
* ½ [[Cookbook:Yeast|yeast cake]]

==Directions==

# Wash the apricots in several changes of water, then dry and cut in halves.
# Place in a large crock and pour on the warm water, reserving ½ cup of water in which to dissolve the yeast cake.
# Stir in the sugars, fruit, raisins, and ginger.
# Add the dissolved yeast and mix well.
# Cover with the top of the crock and let stand.
# Stir every other day.
# After thirty days, strain the mixture and bottle it.

==Tips, Notes, and Variations==

* '''Be sure to check with national, regional, and municipal laws, to produce wine lawfully!'''
* '''Please drink alcoholic beverages responsibly, and have someone sober drive you, if you need to travel after imbibing.'''
* '''Please do not share with underage people.'''
* To jump start the yeast, dissolve in water with a pinch of the sugar the night before starting, and let stand covered with cloth or a paper towel in a warm place, like the top of the refrigerator.
* An actual wine yeast from a wine making store or supplier would also improve outcome.
* Extreme cleanliness will prevent spoiling due to bacteria or wild yeast.
* For best fermentation, keep in a temperature you are comfortable in. Too cool and it ferments slower, too warm and it will ferment bitter, too hot and the yeast will die. ''They are alive, you know!''

      <text xml:space="preserve">A few comments/corrections/clarifications:

2. I would suggest that the listing is an outdated view.  Instead, it should be 1) Dark Energy, 2) Gravity, 3) Electroweak, and 4) Strong Nuclear.  The electroweak is the unification of the weak and electromagnectic forces.  Comments submitted by Ted Fisher (sorry, I'm not logged in right now).

4. The latest estimates put the universe at 13.7 +-.1 billion years.

10. I see absolutely no reason to assume that medicine will not advance to the point where we no longer die from old age or most diseases.  Also, life can survive the extinction of the sun by travelling to other stars and by adapting to other energy sources.

[[User:Dgiroux|Dgiroux]] 18:13, 4 August 2007 (UTC) The 10 Basic Statements page in it's entirety is a waste of time and should be deleted altogether. It suggests that there is some sort of concensus among scientists about what are the most important discoveries above all other discoveries, and &quot;what we know&quot; and there is no such concensus. You might as well list the categories of studies. Get rid of this topic. It's preposterous. You don't need to decide &quot;what we know&quot; to discuss the philosophy of science. It's a method of viewing the world, not a specific set of facts about that world.

11. Do we not know how to spell &quot;matter&quot; on the image?</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">''Ischemic Stroke'' occurs when blood flow is blocked to a portion of the brain, resulting in the death (ischemia) of neurons in the brain.  A blood clot can interfere with blood flow in the brain, by cutting off blood flow beyond a certain point and result in ischemia of brain tissue dependant upon the blood flow that is downstream from the occluding clot.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Composition of velocities===

In fact, there are only three physically distinct possibilities. (If &lt;math&gt;K\neq0,&lt;/math&gt; the magnitude of &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; depends on the choice of units, and this tells us something about us rather than anything about the physical world.)

The possibility &lt;math&gt;K=0&lt;/math&gt; yields the ''Galilean transformations'' of Newtonian (&quot;non-relativistic&quot;) mechanics:

:&lt;math&gt;
t'=t,\quad \mathbf{r}'=\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{w} t,\quad u=v+w,\quad ds=dt.&lt;/math&gt;

(The common practice of calling theories with this transformation law &quot;non-relativistic&quot; is inappropriate, inasmuch as they too satisfy the principle of relativity.) In the remainder of this section we assume that &lt;math&gt;K\neq0.&lt;/math&gt;

Suppose that object &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; moves with speed&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; relative to object&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;B,&lt;/math&gt; and that this moves with speed&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; relative to object&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;A.&lt;/math&gt; If &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; and&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; move in the same direction, what is the speed&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; of&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; relative to&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;? In the previous section we found that

:&lt;math&gt;a(u)=a(v)\,a(w)-{1-a^2(v)\over a(v)\,v}a(w)\,w,&lt;/math&gt;

and that

:&lt;math&gt;K={1-a^2(v)\over a^2(v)\,v^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

This allows us to write

:&lt;math&gt;
a(u)=a(v)\,a(w)-{1-a^2(v)\over a^2(v)\,v^2}a(v)\,v\,a(w)\,w= a(v)\,a(w)(1-Kvw).&lt;/math&gt;

Expressing &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; in terms of &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; and the respective velocities, we obtain

:&lt;math&gt;
{1\over\sqrt{1+Ku^2}}={1-Kvw\over \sqrt{1+Kv^2}\sqrt{1+Kw^2}},&lt;/math&gt;

which implies that

:&lt;math&gt;
1+Ku^2={(1+Kv^2)(1+Kw^2)\over(1-Kvw)^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

We massage this into

:&lt;math&gt;
Ku^2={(1+Kv^2)(1+Kw^2)-(1-Kvw)^2\over(1-Kvw)^2}={K(v+w)^2\over(1-Kvw)^2},&lt;/math&gt;

divide by &lt;math&gt;K,&lt;/math&gt; and end up with:

&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
u={v+w\over1-Kvw}.&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;br&gt;Thus, unless &lt;math&gt;K=0,&lt;/math&gt; we don't get the speed of &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; relative to&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; by simply adding the speed of&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; relative to&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; to the speed of&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; relative to&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.

===Proper time===
Consider an infinitesimal segment&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;d\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; of a spacetime path&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}.&lt;/math&gt; In&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_1&lt;/math&gt; it has the components &lt;math&gt;(dt,dx,dy,dz),&lt;/math&gt; in&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_2&lt;/math&gt; it has the components &lt;math&gt;(dt',dx',dy',dz').&lt;/math&gt; Using the Lorentz transformation in its general form,

:&lt;math&gt;
t'={t+Kwx\over\sqrt{1+Kw^2}},\quad x'={x-wt\over\sqrt{1+Kw^2}},\quad y'=y,\quad z'=z,&lt;/math&gt;

it is readily shown that

:&lt;math&gt;
(dt')^2+K\,d\mathbf{r}'\cdot d\mathbf{r}'=dt^2+K\,d\mathbf{r}\cdot d\mathbf{r}.&lt;/math&gt;

We conclude that the expression

:&lt;math&gt;
ds^2=dt^2+K\,d\mathbf{r}\cdot d\mathbf{r}=dt^2+K(dx^2+dy^2+dz^2)&lt;/math&gt;

is invariant under this transformation. It is also invariant under rotations of the spatial axes (why?) and translations of the spacetime coordinate origin. This makes &lt;math&gt;ds&lt;/math&gt; a ''4-scalar''.

What is the physical significance of &lt;math&gt;ds&lt;/math&gt;?

A clock that travels along&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;d\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; is at rest in any frame in which &lt;math&gt;d\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; lacks spatial components. In such a frame, &lt;math&gt;ds^2=dt^2.&lt;/math&gt; Hence &lt;math&gt;ds&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;is the time it takes to travel along&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;d\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; as measured by a clock that travels along&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;d\mathcal{C}.&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;ds&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;is the ''proper time'' (or ''proper duration'') of&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;d\mathcal{C}.&lt;/math&gt; The proper time (or proper duration) of a finite spacetime path&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C},&lt;/math&gt; accordingly, is

:&lt;math&gt;
\int_\mathcal{C} ds=\int_\mathcal{C}\sqrt{dt^2+K\,d\mathbf{r}\cdot d\mathbf{r}}=\int_\mathcal{C} dt\sqrt{1+Kv^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

===An invariant speed===
If &lt;math&gt;K&lt;0,&lt;/math&gt; then there is a universal constant &lt;math&gt;c\equiv1/\sqrt{-K}&lt;/math&gt; with the dimension of a velocity, and we can cast &lt;math&gt;u=v+w/(1-Kvw)&lt;/math&gt; into the form

:&lt;math&gt;
u={v+w\over1+vw/c^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

If we plug in &lt;math&gt;v=w=c/2,&lt;/math&gt; then instead of the Galilean &lt;math&gt;u=v+w=c,&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;u={4\over5}c&lt;c.&lt;/math&gt; More intriguingly, if object&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt; moves with speed&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; relative to&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_2,&lt;/math&gt; and if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_2&lt;/math&gt; moves with speed&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; relative to&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_1,&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt; moves with the same speed&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; relative to&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_1&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;(w+c)/(1+wc/c^2)=c.&lt;/math&gt; The ''speed of light'' &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; thus is an ''invariant speed'': whatever travels with it in one inertial frame, travels with the same speed in ''every'' inertial frame.

Starting from

:&lt;math&gt;
ds^2=(dt')^2-d\mathbf{r}'\cdot d\mathbf{r}'/c^2=dt^2-d\mathbf{r}\cdot d\mathbf{r}/c^2,&lt;/math&gt;

we arrive at the same conclusion: if &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt; travels with &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; relative to&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_1,&lt;/math&gt; then it travels the distance &lt;math&gt;dr=c\,dt&lt;/math&gt; in the time&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;dt.&lt;/math&gt; Therefore &lt;math&gt;ds^2=dt^2-dr^2/c^2=0.&lt;/math&gt; But then &lt;math&gt;(dt')^2-(dr')^2/c^2=0,&lt;/math&gt; and this implies &lt;math&gt;dr'=c\,dt'.&lt;/math&gt; It follows that &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;travels with the same speed&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; relative to&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_2.&lt;/math&gt;

An invariant speed also exists if &lt;math&gt;K=0,&lt;/math&gt; but in this case it is infinite: whatever travels with infinite speed in ''one'' inertial frame — it takes no time to get from one place to another — does so in ''every'' inertial frame.

The existence of an invariant speed prevents objects from making U-turns in spacetime. If &lt;math&gt;K=0,&lt;/math&gt; it obviously takes an infinite amount of energy to reach &lt;math&gt;v=\infty.&lt;/math&gt; Since an infinite amount of energy isn't at our disposal, we cannot start vertically in a spacetime diagram and then make a U-turn (that is, we cannot reach, let alone &quot;exceed&quot;, a horizontal slope. (&quot;Exceeding&quot; a horizontal slope here means changing from a positive to a negative slope, or from going forward to going backward in time.)

If &lt;math&gt;K&lt;0,&lt;/math&gt; it takes an infinite amount of energy to reach even the finite speed of light. Imagine you spent a finite amount of fuel accelerating from 0 to &lt;math&gt;0.1\,c.&lt;/math&gt; In the frame in which you are now at rest, your speed is not a whit closer to the speed of light. And this remains true no matter how many times you repeat the procedure. Thus no finite amount of energy can make you reach, let alone &quot;exceed&quot;, a slope equal to&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;1/c.&lt;/math&gt; (&quot;Exceeding&quot; a slope equal to &lt;math&gt;1/c&lt;/math&gt; means attaining a smaller slope. As we will see, if we were to travel faster than light in any one frame, then there would be frames in which we travel backward in time.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">===The case against &lt;math&gt;K&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;===

In a hypothetical world with &lt;math&gt;K&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; we can define &lt;math&gt;k\equiv1/\sqrt K&lt;/math&gt; (a universal constant with the dimension of a velocity), and we can cast &lt;math&gt;u=v+w/(1-Kvw)&lt;/math&gt; into the form

:&lt;math&gt;
u={v+w\over 1-vw/k^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

If we plug in &lt;math&gt;v=w=k/2,&lt;/math&gt; then instead of the Galilean &lt;math&gt;u=v+w=k&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;u={4\over3}k&gt;k.&lt;/math&gt; Worse, if we plug in &lt;math&gt;v=w=k,&lt;/math&gt; we obtain &lt;math&gt;u=\infty&lt;/math&gt;: if object&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt; travels with speed &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; relative to&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_2,&lt;/math&gt; and if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_2&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;travels with speed &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; relative to&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_1&lt;/math&gt; (in the same direction), then &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;travels with an infinite speed relative to&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_1&lt;/math&gt;! And if &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt; travels with &lt;math&gt;2k&lt;/math&gt; relative to&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_2&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;travels with &lt;math&gt;2k&lt;/math&gt; relative to&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_1,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt;'s speed relative to&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_1&lt;/math&gt; is negative: &lt;math&gt;u=-{4\over3}k.&lt;/math&gt; 

If we use units in which &lt;math&gt;K=k=1,&lt;/math&gt; then the invariant proper time associated with an infinitesimal path segment is related to the segment's inertial components via

:&lt;math&gt;
ds^2=dt^2+dx^2+dy^2+dz^2.&lt;/math&gt;

This is the 4-dimensional version of the 3-scalar &lt;math&gt;dx^2+dy^2+dz^2, &lt;/math&gt; which is invariant under rotations in space. Hence if &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is positive, the transformations between inertial systems are rotations in spacetime. I guess you now see why in this hypothetical world the composition of two positive speeds can be a negative speed.

Let us confirm this conclusion by deriving the composition theorem (for &lt;math&gt;k{=}1&lt;/math&gt;) from the assumption that the &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;and &lt;math&gt;t'&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;axes are rotated relative to the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;and &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;axes.

&lt;br&gt;
[[image:Strot.png|400px]]

&lt;br&gt;The speed of an object&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt; following the dotted line is &lt;math&gt;w=\cot(\alpha+ta)&lt;/math&gt; relative to&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}',&lt;/math&gt; the speed of&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}'&lt;/math&gt; relative to&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;v=\tan\alpha,&lt;/math&gt; and the speed of&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt; relative to&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;u=\cot\beta.&lt;/math&gt; Invoking the trigonometric relation

:&lt;math&gt;
\tan(\alpha+\beta)={\tan\alpha+\tan\beta\over1-\tan\alpha\tan\beta},&lt;/math&gt;

we conclude that &lt;math&gt;{1\over w}={v+1/u\over1-v/u}.&lt;/math&gt; Solving for &lt;math&gt;u,&lt;/math&gt; we obtain &lt;math&gt;u={v+w\over 1-vw}.&lt;/math&gt;

How can we rule out the ''a priori'' possibility that &lt;math&gt;K&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;? As shown in the body of the book, the stability of matter — to be precise, the existence of stable objects that (i)&amp;nbsp;have spatial extent (they &quot;occupy&quot; space) and (ii)&amp;nbsp;are composed of a finite number of objects that lack spatial extent (they don't &quot;occupy&quot; space) — rests on the existence of relative positions that are (a)&amp;nbsp;more or less fuzzy and (b)&amp;nbsp;independent of time. Such relative positions are described by probability distributions that are (a)&amp;nbsp;''inhomogeneous'' in space and (b)&amp;nbsp;''homogeneous'' in time. Their objective existence thus requires an objective difference between spactime's temporal dimension and its spatial dimensions. This rules out the possibility that &lt;math&gt;K&gt;0.&lt;/math&gt;

How? If &lt;math&gt;K&lt;0,&lt;/math&gt; and if we use natural units, in which &lt;math&gt;c=1,&lt;/math&gt; we have that

:&lt;math&gt;
ds^2=+\,dt^2-dx^2-dy^2-dz^2.&lt;/math&gt;

As far as physics is concerned, the difference between the positive sign in front of &lt;math&gt;dt&lt;/math&gt; and the negative signs in front of &lt;math&gt;dx,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;dy,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;dz&lt;/math&gt; is the ''only'' objective difference between time and the spatial dimensions of spacetime. If &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; were positive, not even this difference would exist.

===The case against zero K===

And what argues against the possibility that &lt;math&gt;K=0&lt;/math&gt;?

Recall the propagator for a free and stable particle:

:&lt;math&gt;
\langle B|A\rangle =\int\mathcal{DC} e^{-ibs[\mathcal{C}]}.&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; were to vanish, we would have &lt;math&gt;ds^2=dt^2.&lt;/math&gt; There would be no difference between inertial time and proper time, and every spacetime path leading from &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; would contribute the same amplitude &lt;math&gt;e^{-ib(t_B-t_A)}&lt;/math&gt; to the propagator &lt;math&gt;\langle B|A\rangle,&lt;/math&gt; which would be hopelessly divergent as a result. Worse, &lt;math&gt;\langle B|A\rangle&lt;/math&gt; would be independent of the distance between &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;B.&lt;/math&gt; To obtain well-defined, finite probabilities, cancellations (&quot;destructive interference&quot;) must occur, and this rules out that&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;K=0.&lt;/math&gt;

===The actual Lorentz transformations===
In the real world, therefore, the Lorentz transformations take the form

:&lt;math&gt;
t'={t-wx/c^2\over\sqrt{1-w^2/c^2}},
\quad x'={x-wt\over\sqrt{1-w^2/c^2}},\quad y'=y,\quad z'=z.&lt;/math&gt;

Let's explore them diagrammatically, using natural units (&lt;math&gt;c=1&lt;/math&gt;). Setting &lt;math&gt;t'=0,&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;t=wx.&lt;/math&gt; This tells us that the slope of the &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;axis relative to the undashed frame is &lt;math&gt;w=\tan\alpha.&lt;/math&gt; Setting &lt;math&gt;x'=0,&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;t=x/w.&lt;/math&gt; This tells us that the slope of the &lt;math&gt;t'&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;axis is &lt;math&gt;1/w.&lt;/math&gt; The dashed axes are thus rotated by the same angle in ''opposite'' directions; if the &lt;math&gt;t'&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;axis is rotated clockwise relative to the &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;axis, then the &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;axis is rotated counterclockwise relative to the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;axis.

&lt;br&gt;
[[image:Stdiag.png|400px]]

&lt;br&gt;We arrive at the same conclusion if we think about the synchronization of clocks in motion. Consider three clocks (1,2,3) that travel with the same speed &lt;math&gt;w=\tan\alpha&lt;/math&gt; relative to&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}.&lt;/math&gt; To synchronize them, we must send signals from one clock to another. What kind of signals? If we want our synchronization procedure to be independent of the language we use (that is, independent of the reference frame), then we must use signals that travel with the invariant speed&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;c.&lt;/math&gt;

Here is how it's done:

&lt;br&gt;
[[image:Clocks.png|400px]]

&lt;br&gt;Light signals are sent from clock&amp;nbsp;2 (event&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;) and are reflected by clocks 1 and&amp;nbsp;3 (events &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; and&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;C,&lt;/math&gt; respectively). The distances between the clocks are adjusted so that the reflected signals arrive simultaneously at clock&amp;nbsp;2 (event&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;). This ensures that the distance between clocks 1 and&amp;nbsp;2 equals the distance between clocks 2 and&amp;nbsp;3, regardless of the inertial frame in which they are compared. In&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}',&lt;/math&gt; where the clocks are at rest, the signals from&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; have traveled equal distances when they reach the first and the third clock, respectively. Since they also have traveled with the same speed&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;c,&lt;/math&gt; they have traveled for equal times. Therefore the clocks must be synchronized so that &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; and&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; are simultaneous. We may use the ''worldline'' of clock&amp;nbsp;1 as the &lt;math&gt;t'&lt;/math&gt; axis and the straight line through &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; and&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; as the &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;axis. It is readily seen that the three angles&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;ta&lt;/math&gt; in the above diagram are equal. From this and the fact that the slope of the signal from &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; to&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; equals&amp;nbsp;1 (given that &lt;math&gt;c{=}1&lt;/math&gt;), the equality of the two angles &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; follows.

Simultaneity thus depends on the language — the inertial frame — that we use to describe a physical situation. If two events &lt;math&gt;E_1,E_2&lt;/math&gt; are simultaneous in one frame, then there are frames in which &lt;math&gt;E_1&lt;/math&gt; hapens after&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;E_2&lt;/math&gt; as well as frames in which &lt;math&gt;E_1&lt;/math&gt; hapens before&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;E_2.&lt;/math&gt; 

Where do we place the unit points on the space and time axes? The unit point of the time axis of&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}'&lt;/math&gt; has the coordinates &lt;math&gt;t'=1, x'=0&lt;/math&gt; and satisfies &lt;math&gt;t^2-x^2=1,&lt;/math&gt; as we gather from the version &lt;math&gt;(t')^2-(x')^2=t^2-x^2&lt;/math&gt; of (\ref{ds2}). The unit point of the &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;axis has the coordinates &lt;math&gt;t'=0, x'=1&lt;/math&gt; and satisfies &lt;math&gt;x^2-t^2=1.&lt;/math&gt; The loci of the unit points of the space and time axes are the hyperbolas that are defined by these equations:

Imagine a meter stick at rest in&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}'.&lt;/math&gt; At the time &lt;math&gt;t'=0,&lt;/math&gt; its ends are situated at the points &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt; and&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;C.&lt;/math&gt; At the time &lt;math&gt;t=0,&lt;/math&gt; they are situated at the points &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt; and&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;A,&lt;/math&gt; which are less than a meter apart. Now imagine a stick (not a ''meter'' stick) at rest in&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F},&lt;/math&gt; whose end points at the time &lt;math&gt;t'=0&lt;/math&gt; are O and&amp;nbsp;C. In&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}'&lt;/math&gt; they are a meter apart, but in the stick's rest-frame they are at &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt; and&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; and thus more than a meter apart. The bottom line: a moving object is contracted (shortened) in the direction in which it is moving.

&lt;br&gt;
[[image:Lctd.png|400px]]

&lt;br&gt;Next imagine two clocks, one (&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;) at rest in&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; and located at &lt;math&gt;x=0,&lt;/math&gt; and one (&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}'&lt;/math&gt;) at rest in&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}'&lt;/math&gt; and located at &lt;math&gt;x'=0.&lt;/math&gt; At&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;D,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}'&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;indicates that one second has passed, while at&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; (which in&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; is simultaneous with&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;), &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;indicates that more than a second has passed. On the other hand, at&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; (which in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}'&lt;/math&gt; is simultaneous with&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;), &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;indicates that less than a second has passed. The bottom line: a moving clock runs slower than a clock at rest.

Example: Muons (&lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;particles) are created near the top of the atmosphere, some ten kilometers up, when high-energy particles of cosmic origin hit the atmosphere. Since muons decay spontaneously after an average lifetime of 2.2 microseconds, they don't travel much farther than 600 meters. Yet many are found at sea level. How do they get that far?

The answer lies in the fact that most of them travel at close to the speed of light. While from its own point of view (that is, relative to the inertial system in which it is at rest), a muon only lives for about 2&amp;nbsp;microseconds, from our point of view (that is, relative to an inertial system in which it travels close to the speed of light), it lives much longer and has enough time to reach the Earth's surface.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===4-vectors===

3-vectors are triplets of real numbers that transform under rotations like the coordinates &lt;math&gt;x,y,z.&lt;/math&gt; ''4-vectors'' are quadruplets of real numbers that transform under Lorentz transformations like the coordinates of &lt;math&gt;\vec{x}=(ct,x,y,z).&lt;/math&gt; 

You will remember that the scalar product of two 3-vectors is invariant under rotations of the (spatial) coordinate axes; after all, this is why we call it a scalar. Similarly, the scalar product of two 4-vectors &lt;math&gt;\vec{a}=(a_t,\mathbf{a})=(a_0,a_1,a_2,a_3)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vec{b}= (b_t,\mathbf{b})=(b_0,b_1,b_2,b_3),&lt;/math&gt; defined by

:&lt;math&gt;
(\vec{a},\vec{b})=a_0b_0-a_1b_1-a_2b_2-a_3b_3,&lt;/math&gt;

is invariant under Lorentz transformations (as well as translations of the coordinate origin and rotations of the spatial axes). To demonstrate this, we consider the sum of two 4-vectors &lt;math&gt;\vec{c}=\vec{a}+\vec{b}&lt;/math&gt; and calculate

:&lt;math&gt;
(\vec{c},\vec{c})=(\vec{a}+\vec{b},\vec{a}+\vec{b})=
(\vec{a},\vec{a})+(\vec{b},\vec{b})+2(\vec{a},\vec{b}).&lt;/math&gt;

The products &lt;math&gt;(\vec{a},\vec{a}),&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;(\vec{b},\vec{b}),&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(\vec{c},\vec{c})&lt;/math&gt; are invariant 4-scalars. But if ''they'' are invariant under Lorentz transformations, then so is the scalar product &lt;math&gt;(\vec{a},\vec{b}).&lt;/math&gt;

One important 4-vector, apart from &lt;math&gt;\vec{x},&lt;/math&gt; is the ''4-velocity'' &lt;math&gt;\vec{u}=\frac{d\vec{x}}{ds},&lt;/math&gt; which is tangent on the worldline&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\vec{x}(s).&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\vec{u}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;is a 4-vector because &lt;math&gt;\vec{x}&lt;/math&gt; is one and because &lt;math&gt;ds&lt;/math&gt; is a scalar (to be precise, a 4-scalar).

The norm or &quot;magnitude&quot; of a 4-vector &lt;math&gt;\vec{a}&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{|(\vec{a},\vec{a})|}.&lt;/math&gt; It is readily shown that the norm of &lt;math&gt;\vec{u}&lt;/math&gt; equals&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; (exercise!).

Thus if we use natural units, the 4-velocity is a unit vector.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
''All information on this page is relevant only for Celestia 1.5.0 and later''.

Prior to v1.5.0, separate rotation statements were used. See the chapter on 
[[Celestia/SSC_File|SSC files]] for descriptions of those declarations.

== UniformRotation ==

Usage:

 '''UniformRotation'''
 {
    '''Period''' ''&lt;hours&gt;''
    '''Inclination''' ''&lt;degrees&gt;''
    '''AscendingNode''' ''&lt;degrees&gt;''
    '''MeridianAngle''' ''&lt;degrees&gt;''
    '''Epoch''' ''&lt;date&gt;''
 }

Period is the sidereal rotation period of the object; that is, the rotation with respect to some fixed background. Thus the rotation period for the Earth would be 23.93 rather than 24 hours.

== FixedRotation ==

Usage:

 '''FixedRotation'''
 {
    '''Inclination''' ''&lt;degrees&gt;''
    '''AscendingNode''' ''&lt;degrees&gt;''
    '''MeridianAngle''' ''&lt;degrees&gt;''
 }

An object with a FixedRotation will maintain a constant orientation within its reference frame. A fixed rotation has properties identical to UniformRotation except that a rotation period isn't required.

== PrecessingRotation ==

Usage:

 '''PrecessingRotation'''
 {
    '''Period''' ''&lt;hours&gt;''
    '''PrecessionPeriod''' ''&lt;years&gt;''
    '''Inclination''' ''&lt;degrees&gt;''
    '''AscendingNode''' ''&lt;degrees&gt;''
    '''MeridianAngle''' ''&lt;degrees&gt;''
    '''Epoch''' ''&lt;date&gt;''
 }

== SampledOrientation ==

Usage:

 '''SampledOrientation''' ''&lt;filename&gt;''

Where the filename is the name of a Celestia orientation file, which by convention has the extension .q (for quaternion.) The orientation file is a text file containing a time tagged list of quaternions. Times are Julian dates specified in Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB). Each record in the file has the form:
 &lt;double: Julian Date&gt; &lt;float: w&gt; &lt;float: x&gt; &lt;float: y&gt; &lt;float: z&gt;

where w is the real part, and x, y, and z the imaginary parts of a quaternion. A rotation of angle theta about the axis V is given by the quaternion: &lt;math&gt;( \cos{\frac{\theta} {2}}, \mathbf{V} \sin{\frac{\theta}{2}} )&lt;/math&gt;

== ScriptedRotation ==

A ScriptedRotation is used create rotation model where the orientation is given by a function in Lua script file.

Usage:

 '''ScriptedRotation'''
 {
     '''Module''' ''&lt;string&gt;''
     '''Function''' ''&lt;string&gt;''
 
     ''...additional properties...''
 }

Module gives the name of a package that will be loaded via Lua's require method. It searches a standard lists of paths for a script file with the specified name. Function is the name of a factory function that produces a table with the rotation model properties, including a function that returns the orientation at a particular time. All of the ScriptRotation properties other than Module and Function are passed on to the Lua function to create the rotation object. The function name is the only required parameter.

To create your own ScriptedRotation, you need to have some familiarity with the Lua scripting language use in Celestia's celx scripts. The Lua function specified in the ScriptedRotation definition is a factory function that gets called immediately after the ScriptedRotation is parsed.  The factory function accepts a single table parameter containing all the properties from the ScriptedRotation definition. The function must return a Lua rotation model object, which is just table with several standard fields. They are:

* period - A number giving the period of the rotation in days. If not present, the rotation is assumed to be aperiodic.
* beginDate, endDate - optional values that specify the time span over which the rotation model is valid. If not given, the rotation model is assumed to be usable at any time. A rotation model with end &lt; begin is not allowed.
* orientation(time) - The position function takes a time value as input (TDB Julian day) and returns four values which are the quaternion (w, x, y, z). This quaternion is related to the axis angle rotation (A, theta) by:
&lt;math&gt;w = \cos{\frac{\theta}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;x = A_x\sin{\frac{\theta}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;y = A_y\sin{\frac{\theta}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;z = A_z\sin{\frac{\theta}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

Here's an example of how to use a ScriptedRotation in an .ssc file:

 &quot;Scripted&quot; &quot;Sol/Earth&quot;
 {
     ScriptedRotation
     {
         Module &quot;rotations&quot;
         Function &quot;wobble&quot;
         Period 1
         Amplitude 180
     }
 }

The above ssc fragment tells Celestia to load a file called rotations.lua and invoke the function named wobble to create a new rotation model object. The rest of the properties will all be passed to the wobble function as fields of a table. Next, the contents of rotations.lua:

 -- prototype for the wobble scripted rotation has default values for
 -- any parameters that are omitted in the ssc file.
 wobbleproto =
 {
    Amplitude = 0,
    Period    = 1,
 }
 
 -- constructor method
 function wobbleproto:new(o)
    o = o or {}  -- create table if one not provided
    setmetatable(o, self)
    self.__index = self
 
    -- set the period to whatever value was specified in the ssc file;
    -- slightly confusing because Celestia is case sensitive--period must
    -- be lowercase, but the field from the ssc file is capitalized.
    o.period = o.Period
 
    return o
 end
 
 -- The orientation function. This implementation produces a back and forth
 -- wobble of Amplitude degrees about the z axis.
 function wobbleproto:orientation(tjd)
    local t = tjd - 2451545.0
    local theta = self.Amplitude * math.sin((t / self.Period + 0) * math.pi * 2);
 
    -- convert from degrees to radians
    theta = theta * math.pi / 180
 
    -- compute a quaternion representing the orientation
    return math.cos(theta / 2), 0, 0, math.sin(theta / 2)
 end
 
 function wobble(sscvals)
    -- create a new wobble rotation object
    return wobbleproto:new(sscvals)
 end

ScriptedRotations have a few limitations. The only allowed parameters are simple types: strings, numbers, and booleans. Complex types such as arrays and property lists will not be passed on to the Lua factory function. This limitation may disappear in a future version of Celestia. Also, Celestia expects that the orientation function will always return the same orientation for identical time values.

== SpiceRotation ==

{{Celx:v160}}

Usage:

 SpiceRotation
 {
     Kernel &lt;string|string array&gt;   # optional
     Frame &lt;string&gt;
     BaseFrame &lt;string&gt;             # optional (defaults to ecliptic)
     Period &lt;number&gt;                # optional (units are hours)
     Beginning &lt;number&gt;             # optional
     Ending &lt;number&gt;                # optional
 }

SpiceRotation is used to import a orientation information from NASA's SPICE system into Celestia. The orientation of a Celestia object will be locked to a SPICE frame.

Not all versions of Celestia are built with SPICE support. SpiceRotation is not support in versions of Celestia earlier than 1.6.0. 

The '''Kernel''' property can be used to specify the name of one or more SPICE kernel (SPK) files to load. It can be omitted if all required kernel files were listed in the definition of a previously loaded object.  Celestia expects the kernel file to reside in an add-on's  data directory. 

'''Frame''' and '''BaseFrame''' are strings that give SPICE names for the frames. The orientation of the SpiceRotation is the orientation of the frame relative to the base frame. If no base frame is specified, the default is eclipj2000. The base frame should be the SPICE equivalent of whatever the BodyFrame of the Celestia object is.

'''Beginning''' and '''Ending''' specify the valid time range of the SPICE rotation. If the Beginning and Ending are omitted, the rotation model is assumed to be valid at any time. It is an error to specify Beginning without Ending, and vice versa.

'''Period''' specifies the principal rotation period; it defaults to 0 indicating that the rotation is aperiodic. It is not essential to provide the rotation period; it is only used by Celestia for displaying object information such as sidereal day length.

Example:

 # Use the frame IAU_EARTH as defined by the constants in the SPICE text kernel pck00008.tpc
 SpiceRotation
 {
     Kernel              &quot;pck00008.tpc&quot;
     Frame               &quot;IAU_EARTH&quot;
     BaseFrame           &quot;eclipj2000&quot;
     Period              23.9344694
 }

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{JET:Navigation}}
{{JET:TOC}}
JET (along with its major application wrapper, Microsoft Access) is often blamed for having poor data integrity, but this is most often because few or none of the data integrity features of the database have been properly used. 

The JET database supports many of the standard data integrity functions that are expected of relational databases, including constraints, transactions, and locking. This support is something that has evolved over time, with only JET 4.0 supporting some features. 

There are also some locking and buffering problems associated with using JET databases in multi-user environments, and especially so over local area networks (LAN). Such problems may be the subject of another chapter, however.

==Constraints==

===Primary keys===

Primary keys help to define a set of columns for a table, that can be used to uniquely identify each row. No two rows can have the same values in the columns that make up the primary key, a constraint that the database enforces by refusing to insert a row when there already exists a row with those values in the primary key columns.

===Unique indexes and unique constraints===
JET supports both unique indexes and unique constraints, subtly different concepts that achieve essentially the same functionality. A unique index is an index that cannot have duplicate values for the columns in the index, whereas a unique constraint is a data integrity rule that prevents rows being inserted with the same values in the columns listed in the constraint. Both can can used to implement the logical data model concept of an ''alternate key''.

The JET engine implements the concept of the unique constraint by creating a unique index. A unique constraint can be added to a table in the &lt;code&gt;Create Table&lt;/code&gt; statement, or via an &lt;code&gt;Alter Table&lt;/code&gt; statement.

===Foreign keys===
JET supports the foreign key constraint, allowing entity-relationship data modelling rules to be enforced at the database level. A foreign key constraint prevents rows from being inserted when no corresponding row exists in a related table, and also prevents rows from being deleted when related tables have dependent rows referencing them.

The JET engine automatically creates an index on the columns that compose the foreign key. 

A foreign key constraint must reference all columns in a primary key, unique constraint, or unique index on the referenced table. The code below shows a foreign key referencing a unique constraint (e.g. an alternate key) on another table.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
Create Table F3 (
    id int identity(1, 1) not null,
    a int not null, 
    b varchar(20) not null,
    c varchar(20) not null,
    Constraint F3_pk Primary Key (id),
    Constraint F3_uc Unique (a, b)
)
go
Create Table F4 (
    i int not null,
    a int not null,
    b varchar(20) not null,
    Constraint F4_pk Primary Key (i),
    Constraint F4_fk1 Foreign Key (a, b) References F3 (a, b)
)
go
&lt;/source&gt;

JET 4.0 introduced cascading updates and deletes to foreign keys. When a foreign key is created with &lt;code&gt;Update Cascade&lt;/code&gt;, the foreign keys are updated if the referenced columns are changed. &lt;code&gt;Delete Cascade&lt;/code&gt; causes the referencing rows to be deleted if the referenced row is deleted, and &lt;code&gt;Delete Set Null&lt;/code&gt; sets the foreign keys to Null if the referenced row is deleted.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
Create Table F5 (
    i int not null,
    a int not null,
    b varchar(20) not null,
    Constraint F5_pk Primary Key (i),
    Constraint F5_fk1 Foreign Key (a, b) References F3 (a, b)
        On Update Cascade On Delete Set Null
)
go
&lt;/source&gt;

===Check constraints===

JET 4.0 introduced check constraints, which apply additional logic in the data integrity of the database. A check constraint is an expression that further constrains the allowable values in a column.  The expression can be a simple value bounding validation, or it can include a sub-query that references values in other tables.

Check constraints can be useful for more than just validating input values. The following example shows how a check constraint can ensure that a table contains only one row.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
Create Table Singleton (
    ID Char(1) Not Null,
    a varchar(20),
    ...
    Constraint Singleton_PK Primary Key (ID),
    Constraint Singleton_One_Row check(ID = 'A')
)
go
&lt;/source&gt;

==Transactions==
From JET 4.0, JET supports transactions for multiple statements, giving developers the ability to write robust code that updates the database without compromising logical consistency by, for example, allowing half an invoice to be created, or half a client's records to be updated. Thus, statements within a declared transaction will succeed or fail together.

A transaction must be explicitly created by issuing the &lt;code&gt;Begin Transaction&lt;/code&gt; statement. Subsequent statements will not be committed to the database until a &lt;code&gt;Commit&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Commit Transaction&lt;/code&gt; statement is issued. If a &lt;code&gt;Rollback&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Rollback Transaction&lt;/code&gt; statement is issued, all statements since the transaction began will fail, i.e. none of them will be committed to the database.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
Begin Transaction
go
Insert Into U1 (a, b, c) Values (1, 'First', 'Row')
go
Rollback Transaction
go
Select * From U1
go
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
(0 row(s) returned)
&lt;/pre&gt;

When using Microsoft's [[w:ActiveX Data Objects|ADO]] database components, transactions are typically managed through the BeginTrans / CommitTrans / RollbackTrans methods on those objects. However, they can just as easily be implemented through statement execution, as shown above.

==Locking==
JET supports read and write locks on the database, either through ''exclusive'' access, or ''shared'' access. Locks can be set at the row level, page level, or database level. 

From JET 4.0, Row level locks will be automatically promoted to page or table level when the number of rows locked reaches a threshold. This threshold is set in the Windows registry entry &lt;code&gt;PagesLockedToTableLock&lt;/code&gt; found under the key &lt;code&gt;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Jet\4.0\Engines\Jet 4.0&lt;/code&gt;

Locking can be configured by setting the isolation level on the database connection. For ADO, this is done with the &lt;code&gt;IsolationLevel&lt;code&gt; property on the &lt;code&gt;Connection&lt;/code&gt; object.

=Connotations Of The Text=

===Line 1===

*'''''nubere''''' (see vocabulary below) this literally means &quot;to wear the veil&quot; and is only used to describe a woman getting married. The masculine equivalent was uxorem ducere - lit. &quot;to lead as a wife&quot;.

===Line 2===

*'''''quam mihi - than me'''''

She is saying that she would prefer to remain celibate than be married to anyone other than [[w:Catullus|Catullus]]?

*'''''non si - not even if'''''

This is emphatic. [[w:Jupiter|Jupiter]] was well known for his 'collection' of marriages, and was also the hardest to refuse.

*'''''petat - should seek [her]'''''

This is an hypothetical subjunctive, that express the action as possible in the present time.

===Line 3===

'''''dicit: - she says: [supposedly is understood here]

Convey his doubts of Lesbia's loyalty to him.

'''''cupido - passionate; desirous; eager'''''

This is a direct reference to Catullus. The poet is showing how only the heart has been leading him up to this point, and as such, he has been 'blinded' by it. Lines 3-4 are a rational evaluation of the situation, as he steps back into a detached state.

===Line 4===

*'''''in vento... oportet aqua -  she ought to write on wind and fast-flowing water'''''

This is a metaphor for her declarations of love. Any writing that was written on wind or water would disintegrate immediately. Therefore, we understand that the poet regards Lesbia's statements as fleeting, said in the moments of passion; in truth they are unreliable and fickle.

=Vocabulary=

===Line 1===

*'''[[wikt:mulier|mulier]], mulieris, f.''' - a woman, married or not

*'''[[wikt:nubo|nubo]], -ere, -psi, -uptum''' - to be married to; to become the wife of

*'''[[wikt:malo|malo]], malle, malui''' - prefer

===Line 3===

*'''[[wikt:cupido|cupidus]], -a, -um''' - passionate; eager; desirous

===Line 4===

*'''oportet, oportuit''' - it is necessary; proper; reasonable

*'''rapidus, -a, -um''' - swift; rapid; fast-flowing; violent; overpowering

'''Reproduction:''' Can be reproduced. &lt;p&gt;
'''Workaround:''' Temporarily insert spaces between the phrase and the quotes, then reselect pair by selecting another pair first. The word will now show up.&lt;p&gt;

'''Comments from Atril Software:'''&lt;p&gt;
*Try it after checking all Autosearch Environment options except &quot;Hide embedded codes&quot;.&lt;br&gt;
 --[[User:Javier Arrizabalaga|Javier Arrizabalaga]] 09:25, 13 February 2007&lt;br&gt;
*If possible it should work without displaying &quot;Portions from Translation Memory&quot; and &quot;All subportions&quot; (note that both of these need to be enabled to display these kind of portions - just enabling one of them won't work).&lt;br&gt;
 --[[User:Loek van Kooten|Loek van Kooten]] 09:10, 13 February 2007 (UTC)
*I have tested it again and works if the portion is the text of a segment (without more text in the same segment). If the portion is part of a sentence, it does not appear in Autosearch.&lt;br&gt;
 --[[User:Javier Arrizabalaga|Javier Arrizabalaga]] 09:25, 14 February 2007&lt;br&gt;
*Said phrase was added to the TDB as &quot;Forgotten your password?&quot; (without quotes). Still it does not appear in the Portions Found window if the source text contains &quot;Forgotten your password?&quot; (with quotes). This seems to be inconsistent with your observations. Is this correct?&lt;br&gt;
--[[User:Loek van Kooten|Loek van Kooten]] 09:38, 14 February 2007 (UTC)
*That's correct. I was trying with the sentence &quot;Forgotten your password?&quot; (with quotes) in both the segments and the TDB. When I have removed the quotes in the segment, not suggestions are showed in the Autosearch Window.&lt;br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Actual wishes ==

For any problem and workaround see also the page [[CAT-Tools/MemoQ/Tips and Tricks]]. Please choose the appropriate section to add a wish.

=== General workflow===
* '''Editing the source''': Since there are often mistakes in source texts, it would be convenient to be able to correct the source on the fly. Otherwise, wrong source text is enshrined in the memory. It would also be good if tags could be deleted at the translator's discretion. As the software now stands, the translator is not given full credit as an intelligent participant. If it really is not possible to delete unwanted tags, it would be nice if they were hidden in the source text as soon as Alt + F8 is pressed. Then the translator can focus on what matters and not be bothered by what doesn't. (Rod Walters)

* '''Show which TBs and TMs are associated to projects''': When moving or deleting a TB or TM it would be convenient to know in which projects the TB or TM is used. (Carsten)

* The settings for '''auto-propagation''' should be specific to a project (instead of applying generally, as it is now) // [[user:tsca|tsca]] [[:meta:user talk:tsca|[re]]] 14:00, 18 July 2008 (UTC)

* '''Server Administrator, Server projects''': Would it be possible to add a status feature here? E.g. in the form of colours that can be given to projects by right-clicking them in the overview pane (for example like the categorize feature in Microsoft Outlook). This would help in the workflow. You could give a project which has been translated but is pending feedback and possible changes from the client the colour red, and then change it to green once the project was completely finanlised. Green would then indicate that project was ready for updating/sending segments to a final/proofread TM. I suspect the possibility to categorize projects according to five different colours would be sufficient. No need to define categories/statuses for each colour; in that way people can use the colours to fit their specific workflow. (ditbal)

* '''Reset format''': a command (and shortcut) to reset a format of segments (bold/italic/underlined)

* '''Confirm without propagation''': a command (and shortcut) to confirm a segment without propagation (if propagation is enabled)

=== Statistics ===
* '''Show statistics history in Statistics window''' - an option to view previous statistics reports in Statistics window
* '''Weighted word count''' 
* '''Automatic copy of statistics in project folder''' or at least a reminder/confirmation before closing the statistics' windows (T. Rox)
* '''Saving intermediate reports''' - an option to measure hourly productivity by comparing different reports
* '''Analysis percentages with decimal places''' - rounding everything down makes the percentages useless for character/word counts

=== Project management ===
* '''Different profiles for translation and proofreading''': an option to switch between proofreading and translating profile
* '''Automatically open the last project''': an option to open automatically the last project
* '''Grouping and labeling documents in Project Home''': an option to label and group document (creating folder structure) for batch tasks and filtering
* '''Prioritizing of documents''': an option to mark different priorities for processing
* '''Hide common file path''': an option to hide in Import/Export path column on Project Home tab file path which is common for all files
* '''Copying projects''': In most cases a new project is similar to an existing project: project manager, translator, source language, target language, client, etc. So copying a project makes sense (Carsten)
* '''Project dashboard''' to have an overview of running projects (T.Rox)
* '''Hide/unhide TM/TB/project''': an option to hide TM/TB/project having possibility to restore its visibility in resources
* '''Profiles for creating projects''': In general there are too many clicks necessary for creating a new server project. In a profile you could determine the source language, target languages, translator(s), project manager(s), etc. In a &quot;normal&quot; company the source language never changes, so why it has to be selected with every new project. There should also be a checkbox in order to use the file name as the project name, or it would be even better if the project name were defined through variables (project manager initials, date, running number, etc.). (Carsten)

=== Navigation ===
* '''Bookmarks''' in order to quickly mark entries (e.g. in order to return quickly to the last edited segment after scrolling up and down in the text) (TilovdB)

* '''Insert &quot;Rich&quot; Bookmarks in Translation file''' when several people do several tasks on the same document and on the same PC, allowing later review/proofreading of specific parts. Each BookMark could include information like : Who, did What (translation, proofreading, etc...), on Which part (X segments from A to B, representing Y source words), When, for How Long . This information could also be used later for project accounting purposes (on a larger project, who contributed in how many % to reach the goal) (MartinB)

* '''Being able to click on hyperlinks''' to webpages and be sent to the page directly instead of having to highlight the link and copy it into the browser (Anette)

* '''Go to original segment from translation results''': an option to go to the original segment within the same project from translation results (e. g. a translator notices some errors in translation results and need to go to the original segment to correct it). Such feature exists in SDL Passolo.

* '''Go to repetitions''': clicking on the repetition icon in the document view allows to filter other repetitions of this segment in the document/project.

* '''Jump to view''': an option that is opposite to &quot;jump to&quot; option in view (to go from document to view)

=== Communication ===
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Communication add-in for the translation manager&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br&gt;As a translation manager it would be nice to have a communication window always open and always on top. Or put it into the task bar.
&lt;br&gt;If there several projects with documents into several languages, I would like to get an instant notification of a new chat entry or a forum thread. So can answer immediately. (Carsten)&lt;/li&gt;
* &lt;b&gt;Communication add-in&lt;/b&gt;
** Email notification when somebody posts a message in the forum. Subscribe option for new messages. New posts will be sent to the user's email address which is stored in the user profile on the MemoQ server.
** Possibility to delete messages (Carsten)
* '''Comments function''': possibility to export all comments made to a document (or project) to a file that can be edited and e.g., submitted to the client as queries. (ditbal)
* '''Notepad''' to add notes for each project (in most cases to collect and forward them to the client) (T.Rox)
* '''Propagation for comments''': an option to propagate comments for repetitions so that a comment would be visible in all identical segments which were propagated
* '''Status for comment''': an option to set a status for comment (accepted, rejected, replied and user-defined lists with different statuses). An option for filter comments by its status
* '''Different level comments''': an option to add and &lt;b&gt;see&lt;/b&gt; comments on different levels (project, document, view and segment level) with &lt;b&gt;tree-like&lt;/b&gt; interface to check them
* '''See comments in QA results'''
* '''Export comments for TTX-files'''
* '''A flag for files with comments''' - a mark for files with comments to see in the file list which files have comments inside (without opening them) 
* '''Extra column for comments''' - a &quot;comment view&quot; - an option to see comments in a separate column
* '''Delete all comments in a file/view''' - an option to delete all comments with one button/menu item
* '''Navigation panel in Active comments tab''' - an option to go to the next commented segments
* '''Filter comments in Active comments tab''' - an option to filter comments by different attributes (user, date, category etc).
* '''Change font size in Active comments tab'''
* '''Filter comments by its category (error, warning, information, other)'''

=== Quality assurance ===
==== General QA ====
* '''Skipping segments which are identical to source in QA''': an option to skip segments which are identical to source during QA (except notice &quot;identical to source&quot;)
* '''Ctrl+Shift+L in QA tab''': an option to use a shortcut for lock/unlock segments in QA results tab
* '''Differences between translated segment and TM entry''': an option to see a differences between translated segment and TM entry. It is very useful when proofreading in memoQ translations which were made externally in other CAT. Some segments in TM could have &quot;approved status&quot; and they should not be changed in translation. This feature would help to track such &quot;illegal&quot; changes
* '''Check web-addresses''': an option to check web-addresses (and recognize them as non-translatable)
* '''Check ™, ®, ©, *, &gt;, &lt;, ≥, ±, +''': an option to check usage of these symbols in target
* '''Check acronyms''': an option to check acronyms (and recognize them as non-translatable)
* '''Save sort order in QA results''': memoQ always resets a sort order by table column in QA results when you change anything.
* '''Identification of duplicated punctuation marks''': double colon, double semicolon etc.
* '''Check words before sign ® and TM''': ensure that trademarks are not translated
* '''Recognize chemical formulas'''

==== Spellchecking ====
* '''Spellcheck all CAPS''': an option to check spelling of words which are in all caps.
* '''Skip the whole segment''': an option to skip not only one word but the whole segment during spellchecking. E. g. &quot;Skip segment&quot; button in spellchecker window.
* '''Skip identical to source segments''': an option '''not''' to check spelling in segments which are identical to source. Such segments are usually left in a source language and do not need to be checked.
* '''Tabular report for spellchecking''': spellchecking gives a tabular report with summary of errors. It could have a design similar to QA report and have different columns. It could be placed on a separate tab in QA results. It would save time when spellchecking a large document (doing it in a background)
* '''Improve speed of spell checker''' (TilovdB)

=== Filter/Sort/View === 
* '''Renaming of views''': an option to rename views rather then create them a new.
* '''Templates and history for filters''': an option to save templates and history for filters to use them by single click
* '''Filtering segments by formatting''': an option to filter segments by present of formatting (contain bold/italics)
* '''Filtering segments where target is identical to source''': an option to filter segments where target is identical to source (it would be a good complement for QA which could find such segments) 
* '''Filtering documents by its status in Project Home''': an option to filter documents by different status and properties (extension, degree of completeness, translated, proofed, size, name)
* '''Inverting filter''': an option to invert filter (to see hidden by filter segments and hide visible segments)
* '''Defining the order of documents when gluing them together''': an option to select an order of documents in a view composed of several documents (drag-n-drop would be fine).
* '''Creating view from selected segments''': an option to create view from segments selected in work area via right-click menu
* '''Refresh view status''': an option to refresh status of views (it is currently possible to refresh files only)
* '''Create view from view''': an option to create a view from other views rather than documents
* '''Filter all respective repetitions''' in the project (or file) by clicking on the repetition icon of segment

* '''Creating view from filtered segments''': an option to create view from segments filtered in work area via right-click menu (or button on filter panel)
* '''Filter/sort segments in view by file name''': memoQ 2013 now shows file names in views; it would be useful to filter/sort segments in view by file name

===Resources===
====Translation memory/Corpora====
* '''Ranking of TMs like TBs''': an option to rank TMs like TBs in memoQ 2013 R2
* '''Penalizing all TMs except primary one''': an option to add penalties to all TMs except primary one (it is easier than add penalties for each TM separately)
* '''Transferring context information between TM''': moving context data between TM to get 101% matches.
* '''Colour-coding''' to distinguish between exact and fuzzy matches in the Translation Results window and in the translation grid after e.g. pretranslation. (Grzegorz Harbaszewski)
* '''Merging 2 or more TMs''': an option to merge 2 or more TMs with one command taking into account meta-data (without import/export by mean of tmx)
* '''Locked segments in TM''': an option to protect some segments from editing in TM.
* '''Show penalties in meta-information area''': an option to show TM's penalties in meta-information area.
* '''Plug-in for using Trados TMs directly''': an option to connect to Trados TMs.

====Muses/Predictive typing====

* '''Turn off Predictive typing when typing in the middle of word''': if you need to correct a spelling error in the middle of word, predictive typing tries to insert the whole word. Such behavior is confusing.
* '''Time delay for predictive typing''': an option to set up a delay for displaying prompts
* '''Exclude from predictive typing words which are already typed in the segment'''
* '''Use content of active document/project for predictive typing''': it is strange that memoQ does not offer words from segments translated above.
* '''Turn off predictive typing when the word is mostly typed''': predictive typing is not required for short words or when 1-3 letters are left

====Term base====
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Remember selected languages when directly editing a term base&lt;/b&gt; - &lt;b&gt;Done in current memoQ version&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Source language should always be selected. The second language should be remember from the last editing session. (Carsten)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Term base: terms show up even if they don't have a translation&lt;/b&gt; - &lt;b&gt;Done in current memoQ version&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Scenario: The project manager defines new terms and releases them. During translation the terms show up as not yet translated. (Carsten) - memoQ 5.0 does it&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hide languages&lt;/b&gt; - &lt;b&gt;Done in current memoQ version&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;New projects:&lt;/b&gt; For us as a company, the source language never changes. The target languages are fixed. Only once in a while we will add a new target language. It would be nice if one could 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. prefill the fields&lt;/b&gt; when creating a new project (e.g. saved settings from last project, so the French translator is already selected when creating a French project)
&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Hide target languages you don't need;&lt;/b&gt; e.g., deselect languages in a global settings dialog so they don't show up when creating a new project, term base, etc. (See &lt;i&gt;Workarounds&lt;/i&gt; section)
&lt;br&gt;These I consider nice to have features. (Carsten)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Term base improvements:&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br&gt;1. A possibility to add extra columns
&lt;br&gt;2. A possibility to add pictures and to link pictures (pictures may exist in a media asset management system or on the web site of a company)
&lt;br&gt;3. An alignment function for importing word lists or adding a language
&lt;br&gt;4. Export functions
&lt;br&gt;a) Define the order of the columns (e.g. Subject &gt; column 3, Domain &gt; column 1, Note &gt; column 2, etc.)
&lt;br&gt;b) Save the export setting so the user doesn't have to select, deselect, order, select TXT or CVS, or whatever setting the next time she exports.
&lt;br&gt;5. Easy access to the term base for terminologists. In our case, terminologists are marketing people and developers. Neither of them is interested in foreign languages, translation memories, alignment functions, translation projects, etc. They just want to 
&lt;br&gt;- enter and/or release terms in the source language
&lt;br&gt;- look up and/or export terms of any language.
&lt;br&gt;6. Web based access to the terms (read-only would be sufficient for our needs). At the moment we use the Typo3 extension sg_dictionary which is enough. See http://www.rohloff.de/de/info/woerterbuch/english/index.html for an implementation at Rohloff (sorry, our dictionary access is password protected).
&lt;br&gt;(Carsten)&lt;br&gt;
7. Ignore accents (e.g. recognize &quot;categorie&quot; for TB entry &quot;catégorie&quot; and &quot;habitaciones&quot; for &quot;habitación&quot; (Torsten)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;b&gt;Ability to Quickly Add terms to specific term bases with customisable shortcuts.&lt;/b&gt; (wordbook.nl)
&lt;li&gt;A thing DéjàVu never offered, as an alternative for fuzzy term recognition: morphological reduction/recognition (language specific). First language to start with, (of course ;-)): German - So: Dictionary has 'Baum', in the text 'Baumes' (Genitiv), Baumes is recognized as Baum+es. (Transit offers this.) (Hans List)

&lt;li&gt;MemoQ now stores it's dictionaries in a text file (we've discussed this), should be moved to a MySQL or MS Jet. DéjàVu users speak of big mama when they talk about terminology databases of 100 000 entries or more. They all use '''large''' databases that should work fast. (Hans List)

&lt;li&gt;Context sensitive terminology recognition. Some kind of 3 dimensional terminology database. Example: If computer and Apple are in one segment, do not translate Apple (or: translate it with Apple). If Apple and Tree are in one segment, translate it with 'green fruit growing on a tree'. I know subject codes can help, but my suggestion is nicer. (Hans List)

&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Selecting TB entries to be exported&lt;/b&gt;. Instead of exporting the complete TB content, there could be a functionality to specify selected entries to be exported, for instance, all entries where the subject is &quot;Finances&quot; or &quot;Project management&quot;. Such a functionality could also be helpful to quickly create a glossary intended for clients. A termbase is mainly intended to assist translators, but all terms would not be useful in a glossary. If I can mark some entries as &quot;Glossary&quot; and extract these specific entries, the creation and update process of client glossaries would be greatly enhanced. (Ariane)

&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Saving the TB content to Word or PDF (or another format)&lt;b&gt;, to automate and speed up the creation of glossaries.(Ariane) - &lt;b&gt;Done in current memoQ version&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Ability to add &lt;b&gt;new fields&lt;/b&gt;, as for instance &quot;Source&quot; (F. Vidal)

&lt;li&gt; Possibility of viewing and changing all termbases during translation. Right-click on term in results pane and change destination of term. Edit term in termbase and see a list of all termbases to choose from. (Anette)

&lt;li&gt; '''Termbase compatibility to the TBX standard format'''. It will be nice, if MemoQ were able to import and export files with the TBX [http://www.lisa.org/Term-Base-eXchange.32.0.html]standard termbase exchange format. (Paul Bouvier) - &lt;b&gt;Done in current memoQ version&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;li&gt; Being able to quickly find double entries in the TB or just a function that prevents one or more terms from being added more than once to the same TB (A. Jakobsen)

&lt;li&gt; It would also be very useful to be able to &lt;b&gt;filter on things such as &quot;case sensitivity&quot; and &quot;prefix matching&quot; and &quot;domain&quot;&lt;/b&gt; ... so that we can fix things like double entries in our term bases, and edit/maintain them... That is, filtering on columns in the actual window that opens when we click on &quot;edit&quot; a term base, &lt;b&gt;like in a spreadsheet&lt;/b&gt;, rather than having to use the confusing: Term Base -&gt; Filter -&gt; Filter and sorting interface, which I find rather unintuitive. (wordbook.nl)

&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Shift+F3 in Add new term window&lt;/b&gt;: an option to change case in Add new term window by using shortcut Shift+F3

&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Preferred terms&lt;/b&gt;: an option to mark a term as preferred. It could have a special icon in translation results. A preferred term could hide all other variants.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Preferred TB&lt;/b&gt;: an option to mark TB as preferred. It could have a special icon and higher priority in translation results and QA (e. g. client's glossaries which should be strictly followed). - &lt;b&gt;Done in current memoQ version&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Delete term from TB via right click menu in translation results&lt;/b&gt;: currently one needs to do several steps for it. - &lt;b&gt;Done in current memoQ version&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Join 2 terms entries via right click menu in translation results&lt;/b&gt;: currently it is not possible.

=== GUI ===
==== Button panel ====
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Customization of buttons on panel&lt;/b&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ribon stretchable interface&lt;/b&gt; - aka MS Office 2010 ribon&lt;li&gt;

==== Tags ====
&lt;li&gt; &lt;b&gt;Option &quot;Omit embedded codes&quot;&lt;/b&gt; when retrieving fragments from &quot;Translation Results&quot; (TilovdB)
&lt;li&gt; &lt;b&gt;Switching between different tag view&lt;/b&gt;: an option to switch between different tag views (in-line/memoQ tags) while saving all segments intact without &quot;real&quot; re-import.

==== Preview ====
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Preview window&lt;/b&gt; should be able to &lt;b&gt;show ONLY source text&lt;/b&gt;, i.e., not both src + increasingly more trgt as you work your way down through the translation. (wordbook.nl)
&lt;li&gt; &lt;b&gt;Switch between source and target in file preview&lt;/b&gt;

==== Status bar ====
&lt;li&gt;Show the &lt;b&gt;number of locked segment&lt;/b&gt; in the status bar&lt;li&gt;

==== Others ====
&lt;li&gt; Ability to resize dialogues in the: Edit term base entry dialogue, such as: Definition, Usage, Notes. (Michael J.W. Beijer)

&lt;li&gt;It would be nice to have the number of words not started in the Project Status bar at the bottom of the screen. [Requested Nov 2007 by Karin Adamczyk]

&lt;li&gt; &quot;Projects&quot; button in &quot;Project Manager&quot; (under &quot;Settings&quot;) which gives direct access to other projects (TilovdB)

&lt;li&gt; &lt;b&gt;Display file extensions&lt;/b&gt; (and maybe Windows-file-type-icons) &lt;b&gt;in Project Manager&lt;/b&gt; (TilovdB)

&lt;li&gt; &lt;b&gt;Elimination of duplicates&lt;/b&gt; (same target, same source) from termbases and translation memory (David Turner)

&lt;li&gt; &lt;b&gt;Reduce clutter&lt;/b&gt; in Translation Results window (numbers, number of fuzzy matches, etc. (David Turner)

&lt;li&gt;Edit TUs directly in concordance window (T.Rox)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Add keyboard shortcuts for concordance window (for: Move hits up and down, insert selected) (T.Rox)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;b&gt;Move word(s) left/right&lt;/b&gt; keyboard shortcut as an editing workaround for MQ's lack of drag'n'drop (cut selection (word if insertion point), move left/right, paste, retain selection for next move). (David Turner, May 2008)

&lt;li&gt; Being able to use MemoQ on two screens (Anette) &lt;li&gt;

&lt;li&gt; Make &lt;b&gt;all the File Filter settings&lt;/b&gt; available via Tools &gt; Options (Thomas V.) &lt;li&gt;

&lt;li&gt; Provide a GUI to &lt;b&gt;edit the smart quote replacements&lt;/b&gt; (Thomas V.) &lt;li&gt;

&lt;li&gt; &lt;b&gt;Separate Translator editor area into 2 zones by horizontal bar&lt;/b&gt;: to see 2 different parts of document (like Adobe Reader or MS Word)

&lt;li&gt; Being able to &lt;b&gt;move a term from one termbase to another termbase&lt;/b&gt; in one click (Anette)

&lt;li&gt; &lt;b&gt;Show the number of repetitions next to the repetition icon&lt;/b&gt;

===Import/Export===
* '''Drag &amp; drop for folders''': an option to import files by drag &amp; drop of folders (it is now possible to drag &amp; drop files only)
* '''Import/Export of Transit files''', I think (when autoassemble/ebmt is covered) that this will be the crucial feature for MemoQ, the 'killer application thing'. Never understood why Atril doesn't offer this, I believe it's because of old ties. (Hans List)

* '''VBA-like macro language''' that allows us to communicate with the interace (pop-up dialogs etc.) and create our own goodies that we can share via this WIKI. My suggestion: Basic Script is Visual Basic for Application™ compatible language built on top of popular SAX Basic engine.  The Basic Script comes with powerful editor (features syntax highlighting, tool tips), debugger, dialog editor, language reference help and other tools necessary for comfortable scripts development.  Basic Script features more commands then native macro language and allows user to write more complex scripts: use OLE, DDE, create dialogs, use mathematical functions and much more. (Hans List)

* '''support for document formats:'''
** .odt / [[OpenOffice.org/Writer|Open Office Writer]] (workaround: save as doc)
** .ods / [[OpenOffice.org/Calc|OpenOffice.org Calc]] (workaround: save as xls)

* '''Set the language of exported documents to the target language''' (instead of leaving the original source language setting). Currently 100% of the text in exported doc files is underlined in red. (tsca)

* '''Would be great if you could just select all the TMs and TBs in one swift click (Anette, August 2010)

* '''Exclude from import number-only segments''': an option not to import number-only segments

* '''Import of files into Corpora via drug&amp;drop''': an option to add documents to Corpora by drug&amp;drop from Windows Explorer (or any other file manager)

===Others===

&lt;li&gt; Ability to &lt;b&gt;edit and delete portions and matches&lt;/b&gt; directly in the Translation Results window (David Turner)

&lt;li&gt; After running the &quot;Resolve errors and warnings function&quot;, you are still taken to a blank &quot;Resolve errors and warnings&quot; window even if there are no errors to correct. It would be better to have a &quot;No errors or warnings&quot; message. (David Turner)

&lt;li&gt; &lt;b&gt;Enable &quot;Add all&quot; button in &quot;Mark selected ranges&quot; (XLS-Import) to select multiple tab sheets subsequently&lt;/b&gt; (TilovdB)

&lt;li&gt;AutoAssemble and EBMT. (Hans List)

&lt;li&gt;Formatting/adding/inserting of bold, italics and underlined is fine (great), but for a technical translator '''supscript''' and '''superscript''' are necessary too (a lot of m², m³, m-1 etc. in technical texts). (Hans List)

&lt;li&gt;Find &amp; Replace - adding option with ability to find a source string only in confirmed/edited segments (T. Rox)

&lt;li&gt;'''Working area''' - moving windows from inside MemoQ (like translator's grip, automatic translation results or translation preview) out of MemoQ (for example to another screen) - Grzegorz Kowalski

&lt;li&gt; A shortcut key for Export Active Document (Anette)

&lt;li&gt; An &quot;Align from here&quot; function, that would align from a certain part of the text, ignoring previous text. Also being able to edit the text would be a great leap (Mat Holway)

&lt;li&gt; A vocabulary collecting all the file extensions and invented jargon that stand between user comprehension and effective utilization of the expensive product. For instance, I am still trying to discover the file extension used for memory files. (interpreter)

&lt;li&gt; &quot;SDL will connect all its translation tools through open APIs and enabling Translators using
Trados to easily connect to TDA and benefit from industry-wide sharing of TMs&quot;. (www.tausdata.org) I hope MemoQ will consider implementing something similar. (Rod Walters)

&lt;li&gt; Being able to export all translations in a project at the same time (actually a function that used to be there) (Anette and Tine)

== Solved issues or workarounds ==
For any problem and workaround see also the page [[CAT-Tools/MemoQ/Tips and Tricks]].
===Issues solved in current memoQ version===
* '''Identification of duplicated words''': like MS Word does it - &lt;b&gt;Done in current memoQ version&lt;/b&gt;
* '''Filter segments by change date and user''': an option to filter only those segments translated e.g. by user XY on 1/1/2012 so as to allow proofreading of segments actually translated by particular person - DONE in memoQ 2013
* '''Reply to comment''': an option to reply to comment (each comment should be signed by user name) - &lt;b&gt;Done in current memoQ version&lt;/b&gt;
* '''Add new words via right-click menu''': an option to add an unknown word to dictionary via right-click menu. - &lt;b&gt;Done in current memoQ version&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Import filter&lt;/b&gt; to import Trados(TM)-TMs in txt format. (T.Rox) - can be resolved with PlusToyz, XBench or Olifant.

&lt;li&gt; &lt;b&gt;Add sublanguages for Dutch&lt;/b&gt; (TilovdB) -  Version 2.2 does this job (Belgium and Netherlands).

&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Special characters&lt;/b&gt; - This function is available in the most recent version, see menu Edit → Insert symbol.

&lt;li&gt; &lt;b&gt;Include spaces&lt;/b&gt; in character count (Grzegorz Harbaszewski) - memoQ does it in the current version

&lt;li&gt; &lt;b&gt;View: All except locked rows&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;View: Locked rows&lt;/b&gt; (TilovdB) -  memoQ filter can do it in the current version
&lt;li&gt;''''Case sensitive term recognition''''. Some won't use it, but for languages like German it is very useful (the Verb 'schrauben' is translated different from the noun 'Schrauben' (plural)). (Transit offers this, but it's implementation has severe bugs.) (Hans List) - current memoQ version does it
&lt;li&gt;Larger or adjustable font for the Translation Results area. [Requested Nov 2007 by Karin Adamczyk] - current memoQ version does it

===Workarounds===

==== Allow keeping only the last translations for every segment. ====
&lt;li&gt;DVX cannot perform this trick (neither can Transit,  Trados does it, when re-importing an exporting TM). (Hans List) 
&lt;li&gt;See the solution Gábor Ugray provided under [[CAT-Tools/MemoQ/Tips and Tricks]]! 

==== Auto correct as you type. ==== 
&lt;li&gt;Current workaround is to use PhraseExpress, AutoHotkey or similar (Requested Nov 2007 by Karin Adamczyk) - done in current memoQ version

==== Automatic insertion of exact/best matches from TM ====
&lt;li&gt;Pretranslation should do the job (can be configured in different ways)  (Grzegorz Harbaszewski)

==== Hide target languages you don't need ==== 
&lt;li&gt; Edit the LangInfo.xml file and comment out or delete the languages you don't need. You can use Notepad or an XML editor, your choice. &lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; Be sure to save a copy of your edited file in a safe place, because a program update will overwrite it.
&lt;br&gt;- The file is found here: C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\MemoQ\LangInfo.xml
&lt;br&gt;Workaround by Gregory - confirmed by Gábor Ugray of Killgray on the MemoQ2 list: http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/MemoQ2/message/2009. 

==== Shortcut: delete entire contents in current translation segment ====
&lt;li&gt;Current workaround is to use PhraseExpress, AutoHotkey, or similar (TilovdB)

      <comment>/* Changing the serial number */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== The activation logic of MemoQ ==

In the activation logic of MemoQ a serial number is not the 'code', it is just your ID card. Every user can apply for a serial number either through MemoQ or via email.

Serial numbers carry licenses, i.e. specific time-limited permissions to use different products/product functionality. When you apply for a demo version, you get two licenses automatically, a never-expiring MemoQ 4Free license and a 90-day MemoQ Network license. If you buy a license, you get an additional license to your existing serial number. So if you suspect there is a new license for you, click '''Update licenses online''' in the '''Help / Activation''' dialog.

If a firewall prevents you from activating online, you can '''Retrieve activation data for sending in e-mail''' and send it to Kilgray's info address.

== Changing the serial number ==

If, for any reason, you entered the wrong serial number, you can still change it; however, this requires a bit of technical wizardry. 

To delete the serial number under version 3.x and 4.x, please do the following:

# Check whether you can see Hidden files and folders. If not, open the '''Control Panel''', select '''Folder options''' and on the '''View''' tab enable showing hidden files and folders.
# Under C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\MemoQ, delete '''License11.dat''', '''License12.dat''' and '''License13.dat'''. If you are using Windows Vista, these files are found under C:\ProgramData\MemoQ.
# Start MemoQ again, and enter your new serial number.

To delete the serial number under version 2.x, please do the following:

# Check whether you can see Hidden files and folders. If not, open the '''Control Panel''', select '''Folder options''' and on the '''View''' tab enable showing hidden files and folders.
# Under C:\Documents and Settings\''(your username)''\Application Data\MemoQ, delete '''License01.dat''' and '''License02.dat'''
# Start MemoQ again, and enter your new serial number.

'''Important note:''' If you have active licenses tied to your original serial number, make sure to copy and save the serial so you can revert to it later. MemoQ will not allow you to request a second serial number on the same computer.

== Using MemoQ on a different computer ==

MemoQ's activation scheme uses the serial number to tie licenses to a particular physical computer. This means that if you enter the same serial number after installing MemoQ on a different computer, the activation server will say ''No valid licenses'' when you hit '''Update licenses online'''.

But what happens if you buy a new PC? You can enter your existing serial number and update your licenses, provided that a certain amount of time has passed since you last updated your licenses on your original computer.

If you purchased a license, the activation scheme also allows you to install MemoQ on more than one computer (so that you can use it in the office and on your laptop as well). When installing MemoQ on the second computer, make sure that you change the extra number at the end when you type your serial number. By default, the extra number is &quot;1&quot;; on the second computer, use &quot;2&quot; instead.

'''''Brassica''''' is the type genus of the mustard family, [[../Brassicaceae/]]. The members of the genus may be collectively known either as cabbages, or as mustards.

This genus is remarkable for containing more important agricultural and horticultural crops than any other genus. It also includes a number of weeds, including both wild taxa and escapees from cultivation. It includes over 30 wild species and hybrids, and numerous additional cultivars and hybrids of cultivated origin. Most are annuals or biennials, but some are small shrubs.

The genus is native in the wild in western Europe, the Mediterranean and temperate regions of Asia. In addition to the cultivated species, which are grown worldwide, many of the wild species grow as invasive or naturalised weeds, especially in North America, South America, and Australia.

Almost all parts of some species or other have been developed for food, including the root ([[../Rutabaga/]], [[../Turnip/]]), stems ([[../kohlrabi/]]), leaves ([[../Cabbage/]], brussels sprouts), flowers ([[../cauliflower/]], [[../broccoli/]]), and seeds (many, including mustard seed, oilseed rape). Some forms with white or purple foliage or flowerheads, are also sometimes grown for ornament.

''Brassica'' species are sometimes used as food plants by the larvae of a number of Lepidoptera species - see [[w:List of Lepidoptera which feed on Brassicas]].

== Species ==
There is some disagreement among botanists on the classification and status of Brassica species and subspecies. The following is an abbreviated list, with an emphasis on economically important species.

The genus '''''Aster''''' (syn. ''Diplopappus'' Cass.) includes some 600 species of widely distributed flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. ''Aster'' comes from the Greek word for &quot;star&quot;, and refers to the shape of the flower head. Many species and a variety of hybrids and varieties are now popular as garden plants because of their showy flower heads. 

The genus ''Aster'' is now generally restricted to the Old World species, with ''Aster amellus'' being the type species of the genus (and of the family Asteraceae). The New World species have now been reclassified in the genera ''[[../Almutaster/]], [[../Canadanthus/]], [[../Doellingeria/]], [[../Eucephalus/]], [[../Eurybia/]], [[../Ionactis/]], [[../Oligoneuron/]], [[../Oreostemma/]], [[../Sericocarpus/]]'' and ''[[Symphyotrichum]]'' (see : [[w:List of Aster synonyms|List of Aster synonyms]] on Wikipedia), but are still widely referred to as &quot;Asters&quot; in the horticultural trade.

In the United Kingdom there are only two native members of the genus of which one, Goldilocks is very rare, the other being the Sea aster, ''[[../Aster tripolium/]]''.

==Description==
The flowers are heads, borne in generally large terminal clusters. Rays female and strap-shaped, disk flowers perfect, usually yellow. Involcure green and of several rows. The seeds are achenes with a bristly pappus.

The leaves are alternate and simple.

==Species==
Some common species are:
* ''[[../Aster alpinus/]]''
* ''[[../Aster amellus/]]'' ('European Michaelmas Daisy' or 'Italian Aster')
* ''[[../Aster cordifolius/]]'' ('Blue Wood Aster')
* ''[[../Aster divaricatus/]]'' ('White Wood Aster')

Single-cycle processors are what we have been studying so far: an instruction is fetched from memory, it is executed, and the results are stored all in a single clock cycle.

The benefits of single-cycle processors is that they tend to be the most simple in terms of hardware requirements, and they are easy to design. Unfortunately, they tend to have poor data throughput, and require long clock cycles (slow clock rate) in order to perform all the necessary computations in time.

== Cycle Times ==

The length of the cycle must be long enough to accommodate the longest possible propagation delay in the processor. This means that some instructions (typically the arithmetic instructions) will complete quickly, and time will be wasted each cycle. Other instructions (typically memory read or write instructions) will have a much longer propagation delay.

[[Image:Nopipeline.png|center|600px]]

As this image shows, an instruction is not over until all 5 components have acted. This means that the length of the cycle must be the length of the longest instruction. The longest path from one end of the processor to the other is called the '''critical path''' and is used to determine the cycle time.

== Redundant Hardware ==

Single cycle processors typically require a number of ALUs (or a single master ALU, and smaller ALUs) to handle the increment operations on the instruction pointer, and the memory address calculations for the data memory. When resources are at a premium, having multiple ALU units in your design can be costly and pointless. It requires nearly as many resources to construct an adder that adds a constant value as it does to construct a more general purpose adder unit.

== Single Cycle Designs ==

It is very rare, if not completely unheard of, for a modern processor unit to have a single-cycle design. The reasons for this are the long cycle times, the wasted resources, and the large amount of wasted time in each cycle. What the single-cycle lacks in timing and efficiency, it makes up for in simplicity and elegance. It is for this reason that single-cycle processors work as a good teaching tool, but are not often employed in actual designs.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Microprocessor Design}}

Single-cycle processors suffer from poor speed performance. Control and data signals must propagate completely through the processor in a single cycle, which means that cycle times need to be long, and many parts of the hardware tend to be dormant for much of the cycle. 

== Multi-Cycle Stages ==

Multi-cycle processors break up the instruction into its fundamental parts, and executes each part of the instruction in a different clock cycle. Since signals have less distance to travel in a single cycle, the cycle times can be sped up considerably.

Typically, an instruction is executed over at least 5 cycles, which are named as such:
;IF: Fetch the instruction from memory
;ID: Decode the instruction, and generate the necessary control signals
;EX: Feed the necessary control signals into the ALU and produce a result
;MEM: Read from memory, if specified
;WB: Write the result back to the register file or to memory.
This is just a textbook example, and modern processes tend to use many more steps than this to execute an instruction.

{{TextBox|'''Example: MicroChip PIC16 Microcontroller'''

The PIC Microcontroller, manufactured by MicroChip Technology Inc, is a family of embedded microcontrollers. The PIC units vary, but execute an instruction every 2-4 clock cycles. All instructions typically execute in the same number of cycles, except for branch instructions.}}

== Hardware Reuse ==

The primary benefit to a multicycle design is to be able to share hardware elements, specifically the ALU, among various tasks. In a multicycle processor, a single ALU can be used to update the instruction pointer (in the '''IF''' cycle), perform the operation (in the '''EX''' cycle), and calculate a necessary memory address (in the '''MEM''' cycle). Multicycle processors also allow computers that have a single memory unit, instead of the two separate instruction and data memory units of the traditional harvard machine. This is because the instructions are loaded on one cycle, and the data memory is interfaced on another cycle.

Multi-cycle processors are typically used in applications where resources are at a premium, and speed is not as important.</text>

In a superscalar design, the processor actually has multiple datapaths, and multiple instructions can be exectuted simultaneously, one in each datapath. It is not uncommon for a superscalar CPU to have multiple ALU and FPU units, for each datapath.

[[Image:Superscalarpipeline.png|center|600px]]

In this image, all the stages highlighted in green are executing simultaneously. As we can see from this image, there are two execution cores operating simultaneously.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Microprocessor Design}}

Vector processors, or SIMD processors are microprocessors that are specialized for operating on vector or matrix data elements. These processors have specialized hardware for performing vector operations such as vector addition, vector multiplication, and other operations.

Modern graphics processors and GPUs tend to be vector-based processors. Modern Intel-based chips also have SIMD capabilities known as SSE or MMX operations.

== Parallel Execution ==

Vector processors which perform an instruction on all data elements simultaneously are said to execute in parallel.

[[Image:Vliwpipeline.png|center|600px]]

Each EX in this image shows a separate execution core (typically an ALU) operating in parallel with one another.

== Non-Parallel Execution ==

Vector processors which reuse a single ALU for a vector operation look like this:

[[Image:Vectorsimdpipeline.png|center|600px]]

As this diagram shows, each EX stage is a new set of data from the first instruction being loaded into the execution core. The next instruction will not be fetched until all the data has been acted upon.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Scale Analysis==

In the chapter on [[Partial Differential Equations/Nondimensionalization|nondimensionalization]], variables (both independent and dependent) were nondimensionalized and at the same time scaled so that they ranged from something like &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;. &quot;Something like &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;&quot; is the mentality.

Scale analysis is a tool that uses nondimensionalization to:

:*Understand what's important in an equation and, more importantly, what's not.
:*Gain insight into the size of unknown variables, such as velocity or temperature, before (even without) actually solving.
:*Simplify solution process (nondimensional variables ranging for &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; are very amiable).
:*Reduce dependence of the solution on physical parameters.
:*Allow higher quality numeric solution since variables that are of the same range maintain accuracy better on a computer.

Scale analysis is very common sense driven and not too systematic. For this reason, and since it is somewhat unnatural and hard to describe without endless example, it may be difficult to learn.

Before going into the concept, we must discuss orders of magnitude.

===Orders of Magnitude and Big O Notation===

Suppose that there are two functions &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g(x)&lt;/math&gt;. It is said (and notated) that:

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) \ \mbox{ is } \ \mathcal{O}(g(x)) \ \mbox{ as } \ x \to a\ \quad \mbox{if} \quad \limsup_{x \to a} \left|\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\right| &lt; \infty\,&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:PDEBook0017.png|frame|Visualization of the limit superior and limit inferior of f(x) as x increases without bound.]]

It's worth understanding fully this possibly obscure definition. &lt;math&gt;\mbox{lim sup}&lt;/math&gt;, short for limit superior, is similar to the &quot;regular&quot; limit, only it is the limit of the upper bound. This concept, alongside limit inferior, is illustrated at right. This intuitive analysis will have to suffice here, as the precise definition and details of these special limits are rather complicated.

As a further example, the limits of the cosine function as &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; increases without bound are:

:&lt;math&gt;\limsup_{x \to \infty} \ \cos(x) = 1\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\liminf_{x \to \infty} \ \cos(x) = -1\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to \infty} \cos(x) \ \mbox{ does not exist}\,&lt;/math&gt;

With this somewhat off topic technicality hopefully understood, the statement that:

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) \ \mbox{ is } \ \mathcal{O}(g(x)) \ \mbox{ as } \ x \to a\,&lt;/math&gt;

Is saying that near &lt;math&gt;x = a&lt;/math&gt;, the '''o'''rder (or size, or magnitude) of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is bounded by &lt;math&gt;g(x)&lt;/math&gt;. It's saying that &lt;math&gt;|f(x)|&lt;/math&gt; isn't crazily bigger then &lt;math&gt;|g(x)|&lt;/math&gt; near &lt;math&gt;x = a&lt;/math&gt;, and this is precisely notated by saying that the limit superior is bounded (the &quot;regular&quot; limit wouldn't work since oscillations would ruin everything). The notation involving the big O is rather surprisingly called &quot;big O notation&quot;, it's also known as Landau notation.

Take, for example, &lt;math&gt;f(x) = 3 x^2 - 100 x + 2&lt;/math&gt; at different points:

:&lt;math&gt;3x^2 - 100 x + 2 \ \mbox{ is } \ \mathcal{O}(x^2) \ \mbox{ as } \ x \to \infty\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;3x^2 - 100 x + 2 \ \mbox{ is } \ \mathcal{O}(x^0) \ \mbox{ as } \ x \to 0\,&lt;/math&gt;

In the first case, the &lt;math&gt;x^2&lt;/math&gt; term will easily dominate for large &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. Even if the coefficient on that term is very near zero, for large enough x that term will dominate. Hence, the function is of order &lt;math&gt;x^2&lt;/math&gt; for large &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.

In the second case, near &lt;math&gt;x = 0&lt;/math&gt; the first two terms are limiting to zero while the constant term, &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt;, isn't changing at all. It is said to be of order &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;, notated as order &lt;math&gt;x^0&lt;/math&gt; above. Why O(1) and not O(2)? Both are correct, but O(1) is preferred since it is simpler and more similar to &lt;math&gt;x^0&lt;/math&gt;.

This may put forth an interesting question: what would happen if the constant term was dropped? Both of the remaining terms would limit to zero. Since we are looking at x ''near'' zero and not ''at'' zero,

:&lt;math&gt;3x^2 - 100 x \ \mbox{ is } \ \mathcal{O}(x) \ \mbox{ as } \ x \to 0\,&lt;/math&gt;

This is because as &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; approaches zero, the quadratic term gets smaller much faster then the linear term. It would also be correct, though kind of useless, to call the quantity O(1). It would be incorrect to state that the quantity is of order zero since the limit would not exist, not under any circumstance.

As implied above, &lt;math&gt;g(x)&lt;/math&gt; is by no means a unique function. All of the following statements are true, simply because the limit superior is bounded:

:&lt;math&gt;3x^2 - 100 x + 2 \ \mbox{ is } \ \mathcal{O}(\sinh(x)) \ \mbox{ as } \ x \to \infty\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;3x^2 - 100 x + 2 \ \mbox{ is } \ \mathcal{O}(500 \cdot 2^{2^x} - \sin(x)) \ \mbox{ as } \ x \to \infty\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;3x^2 - 100 x + 2 \ \mbox{ is } \ \mathcal{O}(x) \ \mbox{ as } \ x \to 0\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;3x^2 - 100 x + 2 \ \mbox{ is } \ \mathcal{O}(x^2) \ \mbox{ as } \ x \to 0\,&lt;/math&gt;

While technically correct, these are very misleading statements. Normally, the simplest, smallest magnitude function g(x) is selected.

Before ending the monotony, it should also be mentioned that it's not necessary for &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; to be ''smaller'' then &lt;math&gt;g(x)&lt;/math&gt; near &lt;math&gt;x = a&lt;/math&gt;, only the limit superior must exist. The following two statements are also true:

:&lt;math&gt;3x^2 - 100 x + 2 \ \mbox{ is } \ \mathcal{O}(0.00001) \ \mbox{ as } \ x \to 0\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;3x^2 - 100 x + 2 \ \mbox{ is } \ \mathcal{O}(1000000000) \ \mbox{ as } \ x \to 0\,&lt;/math&gt;

But again, these are misleading and it's most proper to state that:

:&lt;math&gt;3x^2 - 100 x + 2 \ \mbox{ is } \ \mathcal{O}(1) \ \mbox{ as } \ x \to 0\,&lt;/math&gt;

A relatively simple concept has been beaten to death, to the point of being confusing. It'll be more clear in context, and it'll be used more in later chapters for different purposes.

===Scale Analysis on a Two Term ODE===

Previously, the following BVP was considered:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2 u}{d y^2} = \frac{P_x}{\nu \rho}\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;u(0) = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;u(D) = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;

Wipe away any memory of solving this simple problem, the concepts of this chapter do not look at the actual solution. The variables are nondimensionalized by defining new variables:

:&lt;math&gt;u = u_s \hat u \ \mbox{ , } \ y = D \hat y\,&lt;/math&gt;

So that '''&lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is scaled by &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;''', and '''&lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is scaled by an unknown scale &lt;math&gt;u_s&lt;/math&gt;'''. Now note that, thanks to the scaling:

:&lt;math&gt;\hat y \ \mbox{ is } \ \mathcal{O}(1) \ \mbox{, and } \ \hat u \ \mbox{ is } \ \mathcal{O}(1)\,&lt;/math&gt;

These are both true near zero. &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; will be O(1) (this is read &quot;of order one&quot;) when its scale is properly chosen. Using the chain rule, the ODE was turned into the following:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{u_s}{D^2} \frac{d^2 \hat u}{d \hat y^2} = \frac{P_x}{\nu \rho}\,&lt;/math&gt;

Now, if both &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; are of order one, then it is reasonable to ''assume'' that, at least at some point in the domain of interest:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2 \hat u}{d \hat y^2} \ \mbox{ is } \ \mathcal{O}(1)\,&lt;/math&gt;

This is by no means guaranteed to be true, however it is reasonable.

To identify the velocity scale, we can set the derivative '''equal''' to one and solve. There is nothing &quot;illegal&quot; about purposely setting the derivative equal to one since all we need is ''some equation'' to specify an unknown constant, &lt;math&gt;u_s&lt;/math&gt;. There is much freedom in defining this scale, because ''what this constant is and how it's found has no effect on the validity of the solution of the BVP'' (as long as it's not something stupid like &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;).

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{u_s}{D^2} \cdot 1 = \frac{P_x}{\nu \rho} \Rightarrow u_s = \frac{D^2 P_x}{\nu \rho}\,&lt;/math&gt;

Since:

:&lt;math&gt;\hat u \ \mbox{ is } \ \mathcal{O}(1)\,&lt;/math&gt;

It follows that:

:&lt;math&gt;u \ \mbox{ is } \ \mathcal{O}(u_s) \Rightarrow u \ \mbox{ is } \ \mathcal{O}\left(\frac{D^2 P_x}{\nu \rho}\right)\,&lt;/math&gt;

This velocity scale may be thought of as a characteristic velocity. It's a number that shows us what to expect the velocity to be like. The velocity could actually be larger or smaller, but this gives a general idea. Furthermore, this scale tells us how chaging various physical parameters will affect the velocity; ''there are four of them summarized into one constant''.

Compare this result to the coefficient (underlined) on the complete solution, with u dimensional and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; nondimensional:

:&lt;math&gt;u(\hat y) = \underline{\frac{D^2 P_x}{2 \nu \rho}} (\hat y^2 - \hat y)\,&lt;/math&gt;

They differ by a factor of &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt;, but they are of the same order of magnitude. So, indeed, &lt;math&gt;u_s&lt;/math&gt; '''characterizes''' the velocity.

Words like &quot;reasonable&quot; and &quot;assume&quot; were used a few times, words that would normally lead to the uglier word &quot;approximate&quot;. Relax: the BVP itself hasn't been approximated or otherwise violated in any way. We just used scale analysis to ''pick'' a velocity scale that:

:*Turned the ODE into something very easy to look at: &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{d^2 \hat u}{d \hat y^2} = 1 \quad ; \quad u(0) = u(1) = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;
:*Gained good insight into what kind of velocity the solution will produce without finding the actual solution.

Note that a zero pressure gradient can no longer show itself in the ODE. This is by no means a restriction, since a zero pressure gradient would result in a zero velocity scale which would unconditionally result in zero velocity.

===Scale Analysis on a Three Term PDE===

The last section was still more of nondimensionalization then it was scale analysis. To just begin getting deeper into the subject, we'll consider the pressure driven transient parallel plate IBVP, identical to the above only with a time component:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \nu \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} - \frac{P_x}{\rho}\,\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;u(0, t) = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;u(D, t) = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;u(x, 0) = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;

See the [[Partial Differential Equations/Change of Variables|change of variables]] chapter to recall the origins of this problem. Scales are defined as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;u = u_s \hat u \ \mbox{ , } \ y = D \hat y \ \mbox{ , } \ t = t_s \hat t\,&lt;/math&gt;

Again, the scale on &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is picked to make it an order one quantity (based on the BCs), and the scales on &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; are just letters representing unknown quantities.

The chain rule has been used to define derivatives in terms of the new variables. Instead of taking this path, recall that, given variables &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; (for the sake of example) and their respective scales &lt;math&gt;x_s&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_s&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial^n y}{\partial x^n} = \frac{\partial^n \hat y}{\partial \hat x^n} \frac{y_s}{x_s^n} \qquad
; \quad x = x_s \hat x \ , \ y = y_s \hat y\,&lt;/math&gt;

So that makes things much easier. Performing the change of variables:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \hat u}{\partial \hat t} \frac{u_s}{t_s} = 
\nu \frac{\partial^2 \hat u}{\partial \hat y^2} \frac{u_s}{D^2} - \frac{P_x}{\rho}\,\,&lt;/math&gt;

In the previous section, there was one unknown scale and one equation, so the unknown scale could be easily and ''uniquely'' isolated. Now, there are two unknown scales but only one equation (no, the BCs/IC will not help). What to do?

The physical meaning of scales may be taken into consideration. Ask: &quot;What should the scales represent?&quot;

'''There is no unique answer''', but '''good''' answers for this problem are:

:*&lt;math&gt;u_s&lt;/math&gt; characterizes the steady state velocity.
:*&lt;math&gt;t_s&lt;/math&gt; characterizes the response time: the time to establish steady state.

Once again, these are '''picked''' (however, for this problem there really aren't any other choices). In order to determine the scales, the physics of each situation is considered. There may not be unique choices, but there are best choices, and these are the &quot;correct&quot; choices. An understanding of what each term in the PDE represents is vital to identifying these &quot;correct&quot; choices, and this is notated below:

:&lt;math&gt;\underbrace{\frac{\partial \hat u}{\partial \hat t} \frac{u_s}{t_s}}_{\text{acceleration}} = 
\underbrace{\nu \frac{\partial^2 \hat u}{\partial \hat y^2} \frac{u_s}{D^2}}_{\text{viscosity}} - 
\underbrace{\frac{P_x}{\rho}}_{
\begin{smallmatrix}
  \text{driving}\\
  \text{force}
\end{smallmatrix}
}\,&lt;/math&gt;

For the velocity scale, a steady state condition is required. In that case, the time derivate (acceleration) must ''small''. We could obtain the characteristic velocity associated with a steady state condition by ''requiring'' that the acceleration be something small (read: zero), stating that the second derivative is &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt;, and solving:

:&lt;math&gt;0 = \frac{u_s}{D^2} \cdot 1 - \frac{P_x}{\nu \rho} \Rightarrow u_s = \frac{D^2 P_x}{\nu \rho}\,&lt;/math&gt;

This is the same as the velocity scale found in the previous section. This is expected since both situations are describing the same steady state condition. The neglect of acceleration equates to what's called a '''balance between driving force and viscosity''' since driving force and viscosity are all that remain.

Getting the time scale may be a little more elusive. The time associated with achieving steady state is dictated by the acceleration and the viscosity, so it follows that the time scale may be obtained by considering '''a balance between acceleration and viscosity'''. Note that this statement has nothing to do with pressure, so it should apply to a variety of disturbances. To balance the terms, pretend that the derivatives are &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt; quantities and disregard the pressure:

:&lt;math&gt;1 \cdot \frac{u_s}{t_s} = \nu \cdot 1 \cdot \frac{u_s}{D^2} + 0 \Rightarrow t_s = \frac{D^2}{\nu}\,&lt;/math&gt;

This is a statement that:

:*The smaller the viscosity, the longer you wait for steady state to be achieved.
:*The smaller the separation distance, the less you wait for steady state to be achieved.

Hence, the scale describes what will affect the transient time and how. The results may seem counterintuitive, but they are verified by experiment if the pressure is truly a constant capable of combating possibly huge viscosity forces for a high viscosity fluid.

Compare these scales to constants seen in the full, dimensional solution:

:&lt;math&gt;u(y, t) = \frac{D^2 P_x}{2 \rho \nu} \left(\frac{y^2}{D^2} - \frac{y}{D} - \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} e^{-\frac{\nu (n \pi)^2}{D^2} \cdot t} \cdot \frac{4 (-1)^n - 4}{n^3 \pi^3} \sin(\frac{n \pi}{D} y) \right)\,&lt;/math&gt;

The velocity scales match in order of magnitude, nothing new there. But examine the time constant (extracted from the exponential factor) and compare to the time scale:

:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{time constant} = \frac{D^2}{\nu (n \pi)^2} \quad ; \quad t_s = \frac{D^2}{\nu}\,&lt;/math&gt;

They are of the same order with respect to the physical parameters, though they'll differ by nearly a factor of 10 when &lt;math&gt;n = 1&lt;/math&gt;. This result is more useful then it looks. Note that after determining the velocity scale, all three terms of the equation may have been considered to isolate a time scale. This would've been a poor choice that wouldn't have agreed with the time constant above since it wouldn't be describing the required settling between viscosity and acceleration.

Suppose that, for some problem, a time dependent PDE is too hard to solve, but the steady state version is easier and it is what you're interested in. A natural question would be: &quot;How long do I wait until steady state is achieved?&quot;

The time scale provided by a proper scale analysis will at least give an idea. In this case, assuming that the first term of the sum in the solution is dominant, the time scale will overestimate the response time by nearly a factor of 10, which is priceless information if you're otherwise clueless. This overestimate is actually a good (safe) overestimate, it's always better to wait longer and be certain of the steady state condition. Scales in general have a tendency to overestimate.

Before closing this section, consider the actual nondimensionalization of the PDE. During the scale analysis, the coefficients of the last two terms were equated and later the coefficients of the first two terms were equated. This implies that the nondimensionalized PDE will be:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \hat u}{\partial \hat t} = \frac{\partial^2 \hat u}{\partial \hat y^2} - 1\,\,&lt;/math&gt;

And this may be verified by substituting the expressions found for the scales into the PDE. This dimensionless PDE, too, turned out to be completely independent of the physical parameters involved, which is very convenient.

===Heat Flow Across a Thin Wall===

Now, an important utility of scale analysis will be introduced: determining what's important in an equation and, better yet, what's not.

As mentioned in the introduction to the [[Partial Differential Equations/The Laplacian and Laplace's Equation|Laplacian]], steady state heat flow in a homogeneous solid may be described by, in three dimensions:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla^2 = 0 \qquad \xrightarrow{\mathrm{It's \ 3D.}} \qquad \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial z^2} = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;

Now, suppose we're interested in the heat transfer inside a large, relatively '''thin''' wall, with differing temperatures (not necessarily uniform) on different sides of the wall. The word 'thin' is crucial, write it down on your palm right now. You should suspect that if the wall is indeed thin, the analysis could be simplified somehow, and that's what we'll do.

Not caring about what happens at the edges of the wall, a BVP may be written:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial z^2} = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;u(x, y, 0) = f(x, y)\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;u(x, y, D) = g(x, y)\,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the thickness of the wall (implication: &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; is the coordinate across the wall). Suppose that the wall is a boxy object with dimensions &lt;math&gt;s \times s \times D&lt;/math&gt;. Using the box dimensions as scales,

:&lt;math&gt;x = s \hat x \ , \quad y = s \hat y \ , \quad z = D \hat z \ , \quad u = u_s \hat u\,&lt;/math&gt;

Only the scale of &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is unknown. Substituting into the PDE,

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial^2 \hat u}{\partial \hat x^2} \frac{u_s}{s^2} + 
\frac{\partial^2 \hat u}{\partial \hat y^2} \frac{u_s}{s^2} + 
\frac{\partial^2 \hat u}{\partial \hat z^2} \frac{u_s}{D^2} = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\left(
\frac{\partial^2 \hat u}{\partial \hat x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 \hat u}{\partial \hat y^2} 
\right) \left(\frac{D}{s}\right)^2 + 
\frac{\partial^2 \hat u}{\partial \hat z^2} = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the scale on &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; divided out &amp;mdash; so a logical choice must be made for it's scale; in this case it'd be an extreme boundary value (ie, the maximum value of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{max}(f, g)&lt;/math&gt;), let's say it's chosen and taken care of. Thanks to this scaling and the rearrangement that followed, we may get a good idea of the ''magnitude'' of each term in the equation:

:&lt;math&gt;
\bigg(
\underbrace{\frac{\partial^2 \hat u}{\partial \hat x^2}}_{\mathcal{O}(1)} + 
\underbrace{\frac{\partial^2 \hat u}{\partial \hat y^2}}_{\mathcal{O}(1)}
\bigg) \cdot\underbrace{\left(\frac{D}{s}\right)^2}_{?} + 
\underbrace{\frac{\partial^2 \hat u}{\partial \hat z^2}}_{\mathcal{O}(1)} = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;

Each derivative is approximately &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt;. But what about the squared ratio of dimensions? This is called a ''dimensionless parameter''. Look at your palm now (the one you don't write with), recall the word &quot;thin&quot;. &quot;Thin&quot; in this case means exactly the same thing as:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{D}{s} \ll 1\,&lt;/math&gt;

And if the ratio above is much smaller then &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;, then the square of this ratio is even smaller. Our dimensionless parameter is called a ''small parameter''. When a parameter is small, there are many opportunities to simplify analysis; the simplest would be to state that it's too small to matter, so that:

:&lt;math&gt;
\bigg(
\underbrace{\frac{\partial^2 \hat u}{\partial \hat x^2}}_{\mathcal{O}(1)} + 
\underbrace{\frac{\partial^2 \hat u}{\partial \hat y^2}}_{\mathcal{O}(1)}
\bigg) \cdot \underbrace{\left(\frac{D}{s}\right)^2}_{
\begin{smallmatrix}
  \text{really}\\
  \text{small}
\end{smallmatrix}
} + 
\underbrace{\frac{\partial^2 \hat u}{\partial \hat z^2}}_{\mathcal{O}(1)} = 0
\quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{\partial^2 \hat u}{\partial \hat z^2} = 0
\,&lt;/math&gt;

What was just done couldn't have been justified without scaling variables so that their derivatives are (likely) &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt;, since you have no idea what order they are otherwise. We know that each derivative is hopefully &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt;, but some of these &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt; derivatives carry a very small factor. Only then can terms be righteously dropped. The dimensionless BVP becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial^2 \hat u}{\partial \hat z^2} = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\hat u(s \hat x, s \hat y, 0) = \hat f(s \hat x, s \hat y)\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\hat u(s \hat x, s \hat y, 1) = \hat g(s \hat x, s \hat y)\,&lt;/math&gt;

Note that it's still a partial differential equation (the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; varialbes haven't been made irrelevant &amp;ndash; look at the BCs). Also note that scaling on &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is undone since it cancels out anyway (the scale could've still been picked as, say, a maximum boundary value). This problem may be solved very simply by integrating the PDE twice with respect to &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;, and then considering the BCs:

:&lt;math&gt;\int \frac{\partial^2 \hat u}{\partial \hat z^2} \ d\hat z = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\int \frac{\partial \hat u}{\partial \hat z} \ d\hat z = C_1(s \hat x, s \hat y)\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\hat u(x, y, z) = z C_1(s \hat x, s \hat y) + C_2(s \hat x, s \hat y)\,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt; are integration &quot;constants&quot;. The first BC yields:

:&lt;math&gt;\hat u(x, y, 0) = \hat f(s \hat x, s \hat y)\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;0 \cdot C_1(s \hat x, s \hat y) + C_2(s \hat x, s \hat y) = \hat f(s \hat x, s \hat y)\quad 
\Rightarrow C_2(s \hat x, s \hat y) = \hat f(s \hat x, s \hat y)
\,&lt;/math&gt;

And the second:

:&lt;math&gt;\hat u(x, y, 1) = \hat g(s \hat x, s \hat y)\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;1 \cdot C_1(s \hat x, s \hat y) + \hat f(s \hat x, s \hat y) = \hat g(s \hat x, s \hat y)\quad 
\Rightarrow C_1(s \hat x, s \hat y) = \hat g(s \hat x, s \hat y) - \hat f(s \hat x, s \hat y)
\,&lt;/math&gt;

The solution is:

:&lt;math&gt;\hat u(x, y, z) = z \cdot (\hat g(s \hat x, s \hat y) - \hat f(s \hat x, s \hat y)) + \hat f(s \hat x, s \hat y)\,&lt;/math&gt;

It's just saying that the temperature varies linearly from one wall face to the other. It's worth noting that in practice, once scaling is complete, the hats on variables are &quot;dropped&quot; for neatness and to prevent carpal tunnel syndrome.

===Words of Caution===

[[Image:PDEBook0018.png|680px|frame|Failure of one dimensional flow approximation.]]

&quot;Extreme caution&quot; is more fitting.

In the wall heat transfer problem, we took the partial derivatives in &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; to be &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt;, and this was justified by the scaling: &lt;math&gt;\hat x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\hat y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat u&lt;/math&gt; are &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt;, so the derivatives must be so as well. Right?

Not necessarily. That they're &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt; is a ''linear approximation'', however if the function &lt;math&gt;u(x, y, z)&lt;/math&gt; is significantly nonlinear with respect to a variable of interest, then the derivatives may not be as &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt; as thought. In this problem, one way that this can happen is if the temperature at each wall face (the functions &lt;math&gt;f(x, y)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g(x, y)&lt;/math&gt;) have large and differing Laplacians. This '''will''' result in three dimensional heat conduction.

Examine carefully the image at right. Suppose that side length is ten times the wall thickness; &lt;math&gt;f(x, y)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g(x, y)&lt;/math&gt; have zero Laplacians everywhere except along circles where temperatures suddenly change. At these locations, the Laplacian can be huge (unbounded if the sudden changes are discontinuities). This will suggest that the derivatives in question are ''not'' O(1) but much greater, so that these terms become important even though in this case:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{D}{s} = 0.1 \Rightarrow \left(\frac{D}{s}\right)^2 = 0.01 \ll 1\,&lt;/math&gt;

Which is as required by the scale analysis: the wall is clearly thin. But apparently, the small thinness ratio multiplied by the large derivatives leads to significant quantities.

Both the exact solution and the solution to the problem approximated through scaling are shown at the location of a cutting plane. The exact solution shows at least two dimensional heat transfer, while the solution of the simplified solution shows only one dimensional heat transfer and is substantially different.

It's easy to see why the 1D approximation fails even without knowing what a Laplacian is: this is a heat transfer problem involving the diffusion of temperature, and the temperature will clearly need to diffuse along &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; near the sudden changes within the wall (can't say the same about the BCs since they're fixed).

The caption of the figure starts with the word &quot;failure&quot;. Is it really a failure? That depends on what you're looking for, it may or may not be. Note that if the wall were even thinner and the sudden jumps not discontinuities, the exact and 1D solutions could again eventually become indistinguishable.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Socio-emotional Messages=
==Introduction==
First, I focus on the human communication process as it relates to facilitation in collaborative learning environments. 
As a basis for this discussion, I focus on major variables in the group model of learning presented in the introduction of this guide. I focus on socio-emotional messages that help create a group context where collaborative learning can occur. Next I focus on task-oriented messages which support intra-personal and interpersonal learning. Finally, I focus on the role of feedback in the facilitation of collaborative on-line learning environments. 
==Building Group Context==
===Socio-emotional messages for building a group context where learning occurs===
Effective computer supported communication involves both the software and human interaction. It involves creating an environment with software interfaces which are easy to use and which match the collaborative needs of the learners. Just as in the physical classroom, much of the communication is directed toward creating an environment where people feel comfortable learning. It involves human interaction which creates a cohesive group in which members feel like they belong and can trust one another. 
In this section ,I stress two important aspects of socio-emotional messages i.e. messages that relate to concern for the person and emotional well being of the group. First, I discuss the importance of positive feelings about the context for long-term success in an electronically created environment. Second, I discuss trust as a critical variable which influences members' willingness to participate in the electronic environment. 
===Building and maintaining positive context is important for learning to occur.===
For groups to engage in learning together for any period of time, attention needs to be devoted to maintenance of a context that shows acceptance and concern for the individual well being of the members. Often in networked environments, when the &quot;clock is ticking&quot;, facilitation of context is ignored in favor of getting on with the task. Unfortunately, the task may be accomplished but the level of satisfaction with the media and group experience is perceived low. Individuals are consequently less willing to engage in similar networked experiences. Rice and Love in their study of &quot;Electronic Emotion” explain that it is perhaps the group norms, goals, and structure of the community of participants that influence the amount of context building. If, for example, network use were restricted or oriented to exchanging task-oriented information only, it's unlikely that a cohesive group would develop.  A number of CMC systems, either through Chat functions or Instant Messages make it easy to engage in personal exchange.   Dr. Andrew Feenberg, while at Western Behavior Science Institute noted early on  that different host software systems were designed to focus less on group dynamics and more on task dimensions of the work. For example, communication software that is completely topic-centered in organization while useful for short-term task accomplishment might make it difficult to exchange messages that contribute to building cohesive groups for long term collaboration. In a collaborative learning group, it is important to match the design of new software and the choice of existing software to the focus on building shared group context as well as task accomplishment. 
==Building trust and trusting behavior in learning groups==
===Mutual trust is conducive to learning.===
Participants share a certain degree of personal risk sending messages and providing feedback to one another. If members of the collaboration do not trust other members, they will be less willing to participate and express ideas. For example, if an individual is constantly attacked, put down or told that they are wrong, that person will be less likely to continue to participate. Computer based notes conference participants generally attempt to discourage personal attacks put downs, and unfair evaluations of others and their ideas. When this occurs in a networked group, members of the group will generally attempt to discourage the communication. When members feel that they do not trust one another, they will withhold the vital feedback necessary for all members to achieve understanding, higher task performance and greater productivity. 
Attention to creation of context will vary with the needs of the group. For example, in groups where participation is ad hoc or the group was created for limited information exchange, less attention to context building would be required then in an on-going collaborative learning group. In an on-going collaborative learning group, more time and energy are required to create and maintain a supportive context, which is critical to success and continued participation. 
===Creating group trust encourages the risk-taking necessary to form new concepts.===
The facilitator asks: &quot;what can be done to encourage and challenge the individual to risk reconstructing his/her thought processes.&quot; Not only does the facilitator attempt to foster a context where members trust one another, but the facilitator attempts to create an environment in which the learner is encouraged to explore new ideas and learn within the context of his/her work. 
As a measure of trust, members of a team are constantly asking and answering the question: &quot; If I were to openly express myself, will what I say be used against me.&quot; A member of a learning group will not test out hypotheses about new strategies or attempt to check out what has been understood, if another member is waiting for others to make a (mistake) so that s/he can correct. Trust and open participation would quickly deteriorate if this were to occur among a networked group of collaborators. 
===Mutual exchange of trusting and trustworthy messages are essential to building context.===
In the previous section, I examined the importance of building trust for collaborative learning to occur within the group. I now discuss how trust might be established and maintained in the context of a collaborative networked group. 
Johnson and Johnson view the development of trust through a mutual exchange of trusting and trustworthy messages. ‘’Trusting’’ behavior is defined as openly expressing thoughts, feelings, reactions, information, ideas and resources. ‘’Trustworthy’’ behavior is defined as expressions of acceptance and high regard for the participants, expressions of support for the capabilities of members, and expressions that you are going to work with the other members of the group to achieve the group goals. 
Trusting and trustworthy behaviors will build upon each other to increase the level of participation and commitment to the learning goals of the group. Without conscious attention to the development and maintenance of trust in a collaborative group, the learning goals of the participants will not be achieved or the group at best will on lower level learning or information exchange.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Task Oriented Messages: The human side of getting the job done.=
==Introduction==
Besides individual willingness and an overall supportive context, the facilitator can support the learning process directly with a number of specific strategies. Next I focus on task-oriented messages which support intra-personal and interpersonal learning.   In this section,I focus first on different messages which support intra-personal learning and then focus on interpersonal exchanges. 
==Messages which facilitate intra-personal communication==
===Encouraging representation and articulation of tentative constructs.===
Facilitation messages encourage formulation and representation of tentative constructs, based upon the current state of understanding. 
The facilitator would also encourage learners to look for patterns as well as support the individual as s/he attempts to formulate new patterns to encompass ‘’new’’ information which no longer fits previous understanding. The facilitator supports and encourages the learner to continue the intra-personal process. The individual learner may only feel comfortable representing these tentative understandings for himself. The facilitator can encourage the process without requesting that the learner engage in premature interpersonal communication. 
===Probing for additional examples or observations.===
A facilitator can support learners by helping them discover or experience additional information or instances of events within knowledge areas in which they are working. For example, if my only exposure to software tools utilized a directory and file structure, I might induce that this structure was the only way computers organized information. However, through exposure to other systems I might formulate a different tentative hypothesis and then continue to refine that hypothesis as part of my on-going learning process. 
===Encouraging use of representational tools.===
Oftentimes the individual can learn through the aid of a representational tool which allows them to map out their thoughts. Depending upon preference, the learner may use written words, pictures or spoken words, to formulate and communicate ideas for his/her own consumption before the ideas are ready for public consumption. 
Ideally in a collaborative network learning environment, the tools for self representation should feed directly into the shared network. Individuals would then have an opportunity to test out ideas with others. 
==Messages which facilitate interpersonal communication.==
The work of Dr. Mildred Shaw is useful in helping to understand the types of task-oriented messages that facilitate learning. As part of her work in personal construct psychology, Shaw has identified different behaviors to help individuals attempt to extend and understand their own thinking in networked groups. The messages which facilitate the learning processes, helps individuals to:
* see the relationship of their points of view to those of others;
* explore differing terminology for the same mental constructs; 
*become aware of differing constructs having the same terminology; 
*extend their own construct systems through interaction with others; 
*share with others constructs that they have found valuable; 
*and finally facilitate areas of disagreement or agreement among members of a group. 

Additionally, two specific types of task oriented messages can be discussed--(1)messages that facilitate individual meaning and sharing of meaning,(2) messages that lead to a shared meaning among all members, e.g. consensus or knowledge pooling. 
====Facilitating individual meaning or construct formation.==== 
The availability and accessibility of relevant examples is critical to the on-going learning process. However, the example must be of personal relevance. Relevance would result from one of  three conditions:   the facilitator understands the learner and the state of processing at the time well enough to provide relevant examples, the individual is aware of his current state and is able to request the required knowledge independently, or the individual and the facilitator negotiate a strategy for discovery or uncovering the required information. One key advantage of message sharing in a networked environment is that collaborators theoretically have the possibility to draw on relevant information and knowledge from a wide range of sources, either from other participants directly in a synchronous channel such as through audio or video networks or through asynchronous channels such as CMC or by accessing information stored in any database. 
====Creating shared meaning, knowledge in a team.====
Another important category of facilitation involves messages that create shared meaning among the group or work team. Rather than using the group as a &quot;sounding board&quot; or context for testing out their own meaning, members may attempt to create shared knowledge and understanding in a particular area. For example, a work group engaging in the process of design would ideally need to pool their individual knowledge in order to create a new product. They will eventually want to create a shared meaning, which would allow them to take action together to carry out the design. For example, the activities of groups who are using a combination of media  to share individual drawings, an audio conference to discuss their meaning, and electronic mail or conference to exchange on-going messages are engaging in group learning and knowledge creation. The final integrated design is new knowledge which the group created through their collaborative efforts. 
Reaching a shared meaning such as occurred in this example involves a process of differentiation and integration, according to Johnson and Johnson  (p.244). Differentiating messages proceed the integrating messages. ‘’’Differentiation’’’ involves seeking out and clarifying differences among members' ideas, information, conclusions, theories, and opinions. It involves highlighting the differences among members' reasoning and seeking to understand fully what the different positions and perspectives are. All different points of view must be presented and explored thoroughly before new, creative solutions are sought. ‘’’Integration’’’ involves combining the information, reasoning, theories, and conclusions of the various group members so that all members are satisfied. After differentiation the groups seeks a new, creative position that synthesizes the thinking of all the members.

==Paraphrasing Guidelines for Group Learning==
It is important to provide ways for checking the perception and understanding of the messages by all members of the group. Members often assume that they understand the intended meanings when in fact a shared meaning never occurs. Facilitating and the use of paraphrase is a vital part of collaborative networked learning. 

===Paraphrasing for confirmation of understanding.===
One useful strategy which facilitates the collaboration process is checking understanding through active paraphrase. Johnson and Johnson( p. 244) suggest that the use of paraphrase for perspective-taking can advance understanding and shared meaning in groups. This involves a process of constant checking and rechecking understanding of individuals and the members of the group as interaction progresses. Using messages such as &quot;Are you saying.....&quot; or &quot;Let me see if I can summarize, how I see your point of view,&quot; the group moves toward shared meaning. The strategy of paraphrasing is designed to promote understanding rather than debate. The following guidelines have proven useful for facilitation through paraphrase: 
* restate the other person's messages in your own words, 
*do not indicate disapproval or approval,
* do not offer advice, or blame until the other person has acknowledged the accuracy of your paraphrase, 
*wait for a confirming message from the other person before proceeding with discussion of the issue, 
*continue the paraphrasing process until confirmation is reached.

===Using summary paraphrase to advance understanding and show sense of group progress.=== 
Skilled summarizes messages and replies from members periodically as a way of moving progress along and reaching a shared consensus among the conference participants. Not only do the messages serve as a paraphrase, but since the messages are publicly displayed in the conference, they tend to serve as a documentation of group progress. Since each participant has an opportunity to confirm, reject, or modify the facilitator's paraphrase, the group can progress toward developing shared understanding and achieving its learning goals. 
While this strategy may add additional message traffic to the network, it is critical to processing the goal of shared understanding, necessary for group learning. Utilizing the strategy is generally easier in audio and video networks than asynchronous computer mediated messaging systems. In computer mediated communication systems the delay between message and feedback might tend to inhibit paraphrasing, nonetheless, the strategy is necessary and effective.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Eliciting and Contributing Feedback: How are we doing?=
''There is a need to elicit feedback.'' Feedback is crucial to the creation of meaning in a social context; it is the basic element of the process which allows learners to validate their knowledge with others. 
As part of a face-to-face group individuals are constantly reading the nonverbal communication such as gestures, facial express, voice tone,and change in body position. In essence, the communicators are monitoring the interaction looking for feedback that says: &quot;how things are going.&quot; These feedback messages are both verbal and non-verbal. Communicators become accustomed to 'reading' the nonverbal messages for level of understanding, agreement, or meaning that is shared among the participants in the interaction. In many collaborative networked environments, the non-verbal messages are reduced or non-existent. Participants develop special strategies for eliciting and sharing feedback in networked environments. For example, in an electronic network involving only text-based computer mediated communication (CMC) the feedback is more restricted than in other networks. The lack of feedback and replication of the conversational conditions that exist in other forms of collaboration is particularly disturbing to new users. However, early research conducted by Kerr and Hiltz  (1982) indicated that this changes over time and that experienced users are often annoyed by having to interact at a time and pace that someone else chooses.  To compensate for the lack of immediate feedback, collaborative networks have created special interaction (space) where participants can just chat or exchange instant messages in text, audio or video.  Some electronic learning network globally have created “lounges” where learners can see who is on-line and exchange messages with others on-line and receive immediate feedback.
===Contributing feedback is a shared responsibility.=== 
While any participant may assume responsibility for eliciting feedback and confirming meaning from other participants, all members of the learning group share the responsibility for clarification and confirmation. Each individual participates actively to let others know their current level of understanding or acceptance.  David and Roger Johnson (1987 pps.112,146, 156-158.) offer some general advice for providing feedback which will help create a group context which supports learning. Based on their research: 
* Effective feedback is as immediate as possible; rather than allowing misunderstandings to multiple and continue.  
* Through a series of exchanges, members check for understanding regularly.
* Effective feedback focuses on description and personal interpretations of messages rather than judgment or evaluation. 
* Effective feedback focuses on the particular message or behavior of the participant rather than imagined personality traits. 
* Effective feedback is personal such as '' '''I''' perceive...'' or '' '''I''' understand...'' rather than impersonal such as ''The general perception is.....'' or ''The level of understanding is ......'' 
* Effective feedback provides only the amount of information that can be understood or is meaningful at the time, rather than a dissertation. 
* Effective feedback is specific and focused rather than general and abstract. It is meaningful within the present context of the group communication. 
===Feedback about group process is important.===
One often neglected aspect of feedback is the collaborative process itself. The Johnsons suggest that members of a group who are attempting to engage in collaborative learning focus feedback on group process as well as the specific content of the group efforts. 
Note that research is currently on-going in this area. The unique characteristics of electronic mediated environments require special consideration of the effects of variables such as delay and the organization and display of feedback messages as part of a communication system. Additional research into the nature of feedback and interaction in networking learning groups is needed.) in collaborative group learning environments, they offer the following ground rules for providing effective feedback.  Furthermore, Elaine Kerr (1985, p. 16) has argued:
:&quot; Small task-oriented groups need to occasionally pause to talk about the process itself: participant rates, the tone of the conversation, conflicts, feelings about the process, impacts, observations and problems of using the system, equipment...&quot; Creating a special time or electronic space for this type of feedback is vital to the on-going success of the collaboration. 
If the team is to continue to collaborate and grow as a group, then it will need to focus on its own interaction as a group. Sharing observations about process in the group can help group members become aware of where the group is collectively and how individuals have contributed to that direction. Observation of this nature provides the feedback necessary for groups to improve their overall productivity and satisfaction.

      <comment>/* Copernicus' Model */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The modern '''heliocentric''' model of the universe was proposed by Nicolaus Copernicus in the mid 1500's in his work ''De revolutionibus orbium coelestium''. It addressed many of the problems associated with the geocentric model such as the multitude of epicycles required to describe planetary motion. Heliocentrism is the belief that the Sun is the center of the solar system or universe. While some of the ancient civilizations in India and the Middle East had proposed the heliocentric model before, Copernicus' discovery set the groundwork for the modern view of the universe. 
== Copernicus' Model ==
[[Image:Nikolaus_Kopernikus.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Nicolaus Copernicus, in many ways the &quot;father&quot; of the heliocentric model.]]
In Copernicus' heliocentric model, there are seven theories he presents:
# There exists more than one center of the universe.
# There is a center of the universe near the sun.
# The planet Earth is not the center of our universe.
# The scale of distances between the Earth and the Sun is miniscule compared with the astronomical distances between Earth and the stars in the sky.
# The Earth revolves around the sun, thus causing the annual cycles of the seasons that we witness.
# The Earth's own rotation causes the stars to appear to shift every night, rather than any motion of the stars themselves.
# Any retrograde motion, previously explained by epicycles, is in fact caused by the differing orbital velocities of planets around the sun.

Copernicus harbored his belief of heliocentrism for many years, and did not publish his work until 1542, a year before he died. Some speculate that Copernicus held onto his idea for a considerable time simply because he was fearful of the reception it would have among his peers and more importantly, the Church. Many consider the publication of ''De revolutionibus orbium coelestium'' (''On the Revolution of the Celestial Sphere'') to be the start of the Scientific Revolution. 

In the years that followed, Copernicus' theory was refined and independently verified by notable scientists, most promiently Galileo and Kepler. Specifically, Galileo noted that ''all'' phases of Venus occurred (similar to our moon), which cannot be adequately explained in a geocentric model. This contradicted the solely new and crescent phases predicted by the geocentric model.

== Acceptance by the Church ==

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Software Support for CNL--Intra-personal and interpersonal group support software=
==Introduction==
We are expanding our understanding of how much of the learning process can be facilitated on-line in an electronic environment. The more understanding we gain about the learning processes that occur in the individual and in conjunction with others, the more we can design systems that support the intra-personal and interpersonal processes critical to learning. Additional research regarding the intra-personal and interpersonal group processes will allow product developers to design more effective tools. 
In the previous section, I focused attention on critical aspects of facilitation that support learning in a collaborative networked environment. I directed attention to the particular communication variables of context, socio-emotional messages as well as intra-personal and interpersonal task-oriented messages, and discussed the role of feedback in relation to collaborative learning. 
In the next two sections of the guide, I discuss  software developments in order to highlight specific features of existing technology which might be used to facilitate aspects of collaborative learning. First, I focus on intra-personal learning support tools. Specifically, I describe the use of the following: ‘‘simple’’ personal construct display systems, which help learners sort out the meaning of their own ideas; personal information systems such as outliners, mind mapping  which help learners organize and represent ideas so they can see how their ideas fit together; and icon, graphic tools and simple simulation creation tools, which help the learner formulate mental ideas in some tangible form. Second, I focus on group software, interpersonal groupware  and discuss specific features of existing tools to demonstrate how they might support collaborative learning. 
I am not proposing software replacement for human facilitation in collaborative network learning. Rather, I demonstrate that there are software tools currently available which facilitate aspects of the learning process. Computer facilitation support tools can compliment, enhance, and at times provide new support functions in an on-line environment.

==Intra-personal support software==
===Helping Learners Sort Out the Meaning of Personal Constructs===
Often learners have not tried to sort out the meaning of the constructs that they are developing in their own mind. Often ideas do not get formulated until the learner tries to express them. Dr. Mildred Shaw, who works in the area of personal construct theory developed and continues to refine tools.  Shaw (1987) presented a software tool which provides individuals with an opportunity to formulate and re-formulate their own personal construct system. The software provides valuable knowledge to the learner in a safe environment, prior to sharing and comparing constructs with others. The system probes the learner to discover similarities and differences between elements (chunks of experience) much as a human facilitator might do. 
In her report, Dr. Shaw provides a simple example of how a learner might formulate knowledge about the construct of managerial effectiveness. The screens below help illustrate how the software would be used. 
First, the learner enters the specific purpose for the session, and is asked to keep the purpose in mind. The bottom half of the window will change as the elements and constructs are formulated. The next thing that the learner does is think of some managers and add these as elements of experience. The learner adds five managers to the elements window. The learner then engages in &quot;triadic elicitation&quot; in which s/he specifies in what way one of the three differs from the other two managers in the group of managers selected randomly by the system. The learner decides that AJ and BH are alike and different from VK. The learner types, ‘’needs supervision’’ as one pole of the construct. He would define the other end of the pole as the opposite, ‘’doesn't need supervision’’ The learner then rates all other elements on this scale. He can put the other managers anywhere on the scale. The learner has now created his first construct. He can now continue developing additional constructs using randomly generated triads from the five original managers. 
As a method to clarify his constructs, s/he can select the ‘’Highest Match box’’. This process takes him to a screen showing which constructs are matched. He can see from the display that when he is saying that a manager is a ‘’poor communicator’’, he is also saying that the manager has a ‘’narrow view’’. This situation could occur if the learner always associates ‘’poor communication’’ with having a ‘’narrow view.’’ The learner has the opportunity to further clarify this construct by adding another element to the list who is either a ‘’a poor communicator’’ and ‘’open minded’’ or ‘’a good communicator’’ and ‘’has a narrow view.’’ The learner can continue this process to externalize his/her own intra-personal knowledge structure, which is often out of his conscious awareness. When the learner becomes consciously aware of how s/he organizes his/her knowledge, s/he acquires valuable information which can support additional personal learning and construct reformulation. 
Shaw reports that learners generally respond favorably to the display and demonstrate a high degree of personal ownership. In contrast, messages supplied by an outside facilitator may not have the same degree of credibility and be dismissed. 
Once individual learners have formulated constructs individually they have an opportunity to share the constructs with others in their network. It is also possible to engage in ‘’perspective taking’’. To indicate his degree of understanding of other members constructs, the learner would complete a construct elicitation procedure on a scale created by another participant. The learner would complete the procedure as if he were the other individual. The system would then compare the degree of match. The results would indicate how closely the learner understood the other persons view of the selected aspect of the world.

===Helping Learners Organize Ideas===
‘’’Hyperinformation’’’ Much of the early process of concept formation consists of fragmented ideas, data, and pieces of information that may fit together only partially or possibly not at all. Some ideas may fit into a particular pattern while others may be in conflict. 
Hyperinformation systems provide a way for a learner to document and refine his/her own intra-personal communication process and eventually share that with other learners. According to Jeff Conklin  (1987) each node could be thought of as representing a single concept or idea. In his analogy to semantic nets, he explains that the nodes and the links between nodes reveal the conceived interrelationships among ideas. For example, using the old notecard 
metaphor, the learners could display their own personal concepts in notecard shapes and then link them to other cards. The learners could also select from a library of icons to create a visualization of their personal knowledge system. Eventually, the individual learner may want to share a representation with others in the network as part of the on-line collaborative learning process. 
'''Intelligent linkages for new connections between ideas.''' When one adds minimal intelligence to the above systems, the learner might possibly be prompted to see relationships or connections not previously contemplated. Personal information management tools provide for the formation of linkages between bits of information, not previously specified by the user. They look for similarities in the personal database and make connects or advise the user of conflicts. While limited in intelligence and available only in a local environment, they provide a flavor of how intelligent support tools might aid the learner in discovering construct not readily evident. Research is currently being conducted on intelligent information systems which could support the learner in a distributed environment through display of previously undefined relationships in graphic as well as text form. 
===Graphic Software Tools for Representing Ideas.=== 
====Visualization====
Easy graphic and iconic display exemplified by systems such as the early outlining tools in word processing software as well as mind-mapping can facilitate the intra-personal learning process. The ease with which users can create pictorial representations of internal concepts, manipulate, and then share them with others is worthy of exploration, particularly for the visually oriented learner. Work is currently underway to extend these display capabilities to distributed networks for collaborative dialog. 
====Modeling software====
Today, we are accustomed to working within the simulated environment of a desktop model of documents, an &quot;in and out&quot; tray, and &quot;trash bins.&quot;  The screen desktop has become the model of the world within which the user edits. A generic modeling tool of similar ease-of-use could help any learner formulate his/her current model of the world. The learner could share the model with others to test out hypotheses and understanding. 
A simple to use modeling tool has great potential. The learner would be able to externalize his intra-personal processes as they emerge. The learner could test out the validity of a construct system by making explicit his view of how properties would work together. Once constructed, other members of the learning group could &quot;step&quot; inside the simulated world to test out differences of opinion about the world, thus collecting data and verifying hunches as part of knowledge creation. The world could be a simulated business, or it could very well be the internals of new piece of hardware. 
These tools provide support for the intra-personal processes occurring within the learner. They help the learner sort out personal constructs, organize their own ideas and create graphic or simulated models of ideas. Ideally, one would expect the different intra-personal support tools to be sharable in a distributed networked configuration.
==Interpersonal Support and Groupware for collaborative learning== 
Purposeful communication in groups is one of the key features of effective learning. A class of software, called groupware, {{ref| Johnson-Lenz}} allows individuals to collaborate across barriers of space and time to change the way we work.  Not only is groupware revolutionizing the way people work, it also has great potential for supporting the learning progress in collaborative groups. In this section, I will highlight several different kinds of groupware and discuss how they can facilitate collaborative networked learning. In specific I will focus on general knowledge worker support tools, specific features of groupware which could help build positive context, different tools for providing feedback in CMC collaboration. I also describe software that allows learners to share their personal construct displays with one another. 
===Knowledge worker tools===
A number of tools are currently in use can be re-directed to support collaborative group work. Some of these have direct relevance to interpersonal aspects of group learning.  Meeting facilitation tools for knowledge workers, although originally designed for collaborative work, can be utilized in direct support of the learning process, in a least two ways: to document and make publicly accessible the pooled knowledge among a group, to aid the group in development of a commonly shared integration of their individual knowledge.  One seminal experiment with groupware, ‘’’Cognoter’’’ at Xexor PARC, provided for three distinct phases of group activity in support of a final presentation of a group idea (knowledge). The tool assisted the group in managing ideas to reach a shared consensus. In the process of working with the tools, members of the collaborating team engage in goal-directed behavior in three phases. Cognoter supported generation and sharing of ideas through group display, grouping ideas conceptually and linking ideas, consensus or final ordering of ideas into like categories for presentation of the group results. A critical feature of this software is the interface which provides for a graphic display of linkages between ideas. 

===Context building--Message structuring in interpersonal CMC===
Each computer based conferencing system has its own unique structure for participants to provide feedback. Different systems provide for different organization of messages and feedback. For example, messages may be organized in linear fashion with replies( feedback messages) following each topic (original message). Other systems organize messages into keyword categories so that feedback are automatically associated with pre-defined key ideas. Still in other systems, graphic tree structures are used to display the organization of messages and replies.  Messages and feedback structures can be in linked structures. Consequently, the learner would have extreme flexibility in structuring ideas and concepts and receiving feedback from others. While the communication richness of the system is vital to collaboration, the balance between variety of options and complexity of use will certainly influence acceptance of any system to support learning. 
===Interpersonal Tools for sharing feedback and refining ideas===
====Voting====
One useful feature for building shared group knowledge is the use of consensus assessment routines such as voting. Voting has been a popular feature of  system. It provides a mechanism for formal feedback. Systems  provide a wide variety of pre-defined,1-5 rating scales as well as techniques for rank ordering items. User have the capability of defining their own scales for eliciting feedback on their ideas from other participants. 
====Annotation==== 
‘’Annotation’’ is feedback which allows one learner to send a message and another to respond in either voice or written form at any particular point in the message. Collaborative authoring tools allow to prepare a final written group document. Annotation messages can provide feedback up to five levels, comments on comments on comments, etc, as the group continues to refine its knowledge. At the end of the process, the group can review a listing of the ideas that influenced the group decision process over time and version.  Not only is the group able to create knowledge together but they also have a record of feedback messages to on another to help them improve their overall group process. 
====Anonymous messaging==== 
One way that computer conferencing has developed for sharing ideas that are risky, is to provide for anonymous messaging. The message can be posted with the &quot;FROM&quot; portion of the message stripped off. When trust is low in a team, anonymous messaging can provide an opportunity for individuals to address sensitive issues. For instance, an anonymous message might help the group focus on its on 'process' at a time when no individual member felt comfortable owning the observation. 
====Private messaging==== 
Another strategy is for groups members to establish themselves as a private group. In an intact group which is private, participants know that any messages shared will only be available to members of the group. If I knew that only a trusted group of individuals would have access to my messages, then I would be more willing to express ideas openly. Restricted, closed groups and private messaging are useful for increasing level of trust, and open dialog. However, the possibility of learning which might occur from open exchange with a variety of divergent opinions is lost when the group restricts access to the outside world. Both options are available in all forms of non broadcast electronic exchange. The decision is made based upon the purpose and desired outcomes of the group. 
====Simultaneous sending and receiving of feedback.==== 
In two person conversational networks such as video or audio conferencing, users observe the turn taking rituals of face to face conversation. One person usually does not offer feedback until someone else stops speaking. In a group, however, individuals may break apart and speak in small units simultaneously. Usually, in CMC electronic systems the receiver would have to wait until the message had been sent to provide feedback. However, participant systems have been development which allow a group to display messages and provide feedback to each other without waiting for a replying. Each user has an assigned window in which his/her message is displayed.   Participants are free to structure their own interaction. Members of the group each have a window unique to the sender for display of text messages. Each can provide messages or feedback to the group as a whole or to individual members simultaneous. Each member of the group is able to compare the feedback from several participants at the same time. 


===Hyperinformation for group concept formation=== 
In the discussion of intra-personal tools, I explored how a hypermedia system might be used for manipulating ideas and concepts. The same software when distributed  can be profitably used in group collaboration. Not only do hypertext and hypericon systems provide a way for learners to group different symbols together as well as document their reason for the connection name the links. For example, a team of writers who have all gathered information about different products, might want to pool their different individual pieces of information into a number of shared concepts(topics) for a final report of their knowledge. For example, given information about objects such as tape, floppy disk, CD-ROM, and hard drive. One participants might link the tape, floppy disk and CD-ROM together with a link such as &quot;used with&quot; Personal Computers while another might link the CD-ROM, tape, and hard drive together as &quot;types of storage.’ Each writer could link any number of diverse pieces of information together to represent how s/he is organizing his/her knowledge. Once the structures are graphically revealed in a web-like structure of nodes and links, the different participants can now manipulate the structures through a graphic editor. 
By sharing their individual structures, members of the team would be able to form a new knowledge structure from which they could now all work together. Through the representation and sharing with this tool, each member has learned together through the collaborative efforts of the others. 
===Sharing personal constructs in a network===
It is desirable for learners to share ideas which they have formed and externalized as part of their intra-personal learning process. An electronic networked environment can facilitate interpersonal knowledge creation and sharing, as Dr. Mildred Shaw has developed over the years at the University of Calgary  Shaw has developed and demonstrated a working model of a networking participant system which provides for the sharing of knowledge about personal constructs. The system takes advantage of the graphic interface in a network    Instead of constructing personal construct displays just for one's own understanding, members of a group agree on an area of common knowledge to be explored. Each participant would then individually develop their construct display girds. The completed grids would be stored in a database for later manipulation. Each participant then calls up the completed original and makes two copies, omitting the ratings. The participant then completes the other member's construct grid for oneself and then as if s/he were the originator. The degree of match is computed and then all three grids are displayed together. The learner can now see where the knowledge of the world is the same as or different from that of other members of the group. The sharable graphic display allows one member to see how others view the world, and can help them understand and use the constructs of others.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Conclusion=
A collaborative networked learning environment is one promising response to the learning demands of the new age of connectivity. In this new age of connectivity, the human value-added is in the ability to learn quickly and constantly in the face of rapid change. 
Consequently, in this guide I have focused on how to facilitate and support the learning process in an on-line collaborative networked environment. I have focused on key characteristics of communication which go beyond simple data and information transmission to the symbolic communication necessary for value-added learning to occur in today's workplace. Value-added learning involves both intra-personal and interpersonal communication processes. In this guide, I discussed facilitation within the framework of a group communication model. The model and knowledge shared in this report can serve as the basis for developing guidelines for facilitators of collaborative networked learning. 
It is important to focus on the following summary statements as guidelines:  learners form concepts based on perceived similarities and differences among examples, e.g. data and information from the work environment, sufficiently rich data and information is available on-line from co-workers and external databases to aid learning and knowledge creation, socio-emotional messages can establish and maintain a context where members trust one another, mutual trust supports learning and encourages the personal risk taking necessary to share ideas, articulate tentative constructs, and test out hypotheses about the world, representational tools and strategies that facilitate intra-personal message formulation need to be available for on-line interpersonal communication in order for the learner to validate personal constructs. communication strategies and tools which facilitate interpersonal message sharing need also to create and provide access to a record of group messages, a group database, as an aid to memory and an additional source of examples for other learners from other networks, and communication norms and a messaging structure which elicit and process feedback from participants are necessary to validate learning in the real world. 
Finally, I highlighted key features of software that will support on-line collaborative learning, not as a substitute for effective human communication but as tools to enhance and augment human intelligence in the workplace. As a means of helping the reader visualize how learning might be supported, I sighted examples of the following categories of support tools: personal construct elicitation, personal information management tools such as hyperinformation and information management with intelligent linkages, and visualization and modeling tools to facilitate externalization of constructs. 
I also highlighted features of groupware which could be included as part of the on-line interpersonal communication learning support system. I discussed the following features: knowledge worker tools which help groups share ideas and compare conceptual linkages, context building features of groupware, sharing feedback and refining ideas such as voting and annotation and simultaneous sending and receiving of feedback, hyperinformation for group concept formation, and sharing personal constructs with others in a network. 
All of these features taken together help us visualize how to support learning in a collaborative networked environment. The knowledge about software support for intra-personal and group learning form the basis for design of present and future  electronic learning environments. Together they begin to call attention to design features which could enhance and support learning.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=New Age of pervasive connectivity=
A collaborative networked learning environment is one promising response to the learning demands of the new age of pervasive, wireless connectivity. In this new age of connectivity, the human value-added is in the ability to learn quickly and constantly in the face of rapid change. 

One might begin the journey by focusing on how to facilitate and support the learning process in an on-line collaborative networked environment. Not only does one need to turn the traditional model of learning upside down to construct a new model of collaboration but also a new model of learning as construction.  It is a model of drawing out and drawing together ideas and participants rather than a model of memory and recall of existing accepted knowledge to fill in the tabla rasa.

The key characteristics of communication go beyond simple data and information transmission to the symbolic communication necessary for value-added learning to occur in today's workplace and 
other physical and virtual learning space.  

Value-added learning involves both intra-personal and interpersonal communication processes.

Facilitation occurs within the framework of a group communication model. The model and knowledge shared can serve as the basis for developing guidelines for facilitators of collaborative networked learning. It is important to focus on the following summary statements as guidelines:  learners form concepts based on perceived similarities and differences among examples, e.g. data and information from the work environment, sufficiently rich data and information is available on-line from co-workers and co-learns and external databases to aid learning and knowledge creation, socio-emotional messages can establish and maintain a context where members trust one another, mutual trust supports learning and encourages the personal risk taking necessary to share ideas, articulate tentative constructs, and test out hypotheses about the world, representational tools and strategies that facilitate intra-personal message formulation need to be available for on-line interpersonal communication in order for the learner to validate personal constructs. 

Communication strategies and tools which facilitate interpersonal message sharing need also to create and provide access to a record of group messages, a group database, as an aid to memory and an additional source of examples for other learners from other networks, and communication norms and a messaging structure which elicit and process feedback from participants are necessary to validate learning in the real world. 

Performance platforms can be created to support on-line collaborative learning, not as a substitute for effective human communication but as tools to enhance and augment human intelligence in the workplace or adult learning spaces.  Learning platforms might be supported through tools in the following categories: personal construct elicitation, personal information management tools such as hyper information and information management with intelligent linkages, and visualization and modeling tools to facilitate externalization of constructs. 
Features of groupware might be used to support on-line interpersonal communication.  The features include: knowledge worker tools which help groups share ideas and compare conceptual linkages, context building features of groupware, sharing feedback and refining ideas such as voting and annotation and simultaneous sending and receiving of feedback, hyper information for group concept formation, and sharing personal constructs with others in a network. 

All of these features taken together help us visualize how to support learning in a collaborative networked environment. The knowledge about software support for intra-personal and group learning form the basis for design of present and future electronic learning environments. Together they begin to call attention to design features which could enhance and support learning. 
In the current age of wireless, pervasive connectivity, we challenge ourselves and our models to support just in time learning anywhere, anytime.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Collaborative Networked learning, therefore, would occur in the 
context of a group with a mission or agree-upon-purpose.  
The work involves the structuring and restructuring of
conceptual knowledge.  The final product is a message, an
external artifact of the group knowledge at a particular point
in time,which communicates the knowledge
of the group.  The message might take the form of a program,
a report, a strategy document, a diagram, a drawing etc.
Learning-work involves the cognitive processes 
of assimilation--intake of 
information from the environment, accommodation--restructuring
to fit new into the old, present structure,
and integration--directly fitting information into existing structure.
And most importantly it involves the resolution of conflict 
between old and new structures,which can lead to innovation.
&lt;p&gt;
Two communication processes or type of dialogs
are involved in learning-work: (1) Intra-personal
communication--integration, and accommodation--involves processing 
within the individual. (2) Interpersonal communication
involves assimilation-- the intake of information from the environment--and
representation of one's knowledge structure in a form and medium
that can be shared with another person.
As one person,shares ideas with another person,
the process becomes an on-going loop from assimilation through representation 
of knowledge structures.  
&lt;p&gt;
At any point the learner may represent his/her ideas in order to test out
hypotheses to gain agreement or validation.  When members of a mission oriented
group create shared knowledge structure and produce an artifact such as a 
written report or a software program, for example, 
they engage in learning to created a product which is their collective knowledge.

As you study the different parts of the guide, it may be useful to keep this model in mind and use it as a basis for developing your own insight and focusing your knowledge creation process.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Collaboration--Across Time and Distance: A Premier=



===Channel Selection===
Electronically networked group involves different communication channels than when working one to one.   Selecting an appropriate channel for the each tasks may accomplish the objectives.  Adler and Elmhost (2005) consider five important factors to help one decide when, where and how to communicate, such as the time required to receive feedback, amount of information conveyed, sender’s control over the message, control over receiver’s attention and effectiveness for detailed message.   In order to determine when to meet face-to-face or when to send e-mail or perhaps when to send a simple instant text message, consult Table 1.1 page 13 in Adler and Rodman, ''Understanding Human Communication'' 9th edition for guidance. 

===Feedback Strategy: Feedback messages without nonverbal clues=== 
As part of a face-to-face group individuals are constantly
reading the nonverbal communication such as gestures,
facial express, voice tone, and change in body position.  In essence, the communicators are monitoring the interaction looking for feedback that says &quot;how things are going.&quot;
These feedback messages are both verbal and non-verbal.  
Communicators become accustomed to reading the nonverbal messages for level of understanding, agreement, or meaning that is shared among the participants in the interaction.  In many collaborative
networked environments, the non-verbal messages are
reduced or non-existent. Participants develop special strategies
for eliciting and sharing feedback in networked environments.
For example, in an electronic network involving only text-based computer mediated communication (CMC) the feedback is more restricted than in other networks.  

===Eliciting and contributing Feedback=== 

====Process Facilitation—how are we doing as a group====


While any participant may assume responsibility for eliciting
feedback and confirming meaning from other participants, all
members of the learning group share the responsibility for
clarification and confirmation.  Each individual participates
actively to let others know their current level of understanding
or acceptance.  David and Roger Johnson (1994) offer some general advice for providing feedback which will help create a group context which supports group communication.  Based on their research in collaborative group learning environments, they offer the following ground rules for providing effective feedback:

Effective feedback is as immediate as possible; rather than
allowing misunderstandings to multiple and continue through
a series of exchanges, members check for understanding regularly.

Effective feedback focuses on description  and personal
interpretations of messages rather than judgment or 
evaluation. 

Effective feedback focuses on the particular message or
behavior of the participant rather than imagined
personality traits.

Effective feedback is personal such as 
I perceive...  or I understand
rather than impersonal such as 
The general perception is..... or The level of understanding is ......

Effective feedback provides only the amount of information
that can be understood or is meaningful at the time, rather
than a dissertation.

Effective feedback is specific and focused rather than
general and abstract. It is meaningful within the present
context of the group communication.

====Feedback about group process is important.====

One often neglected aspect of feedback is the collaborative
process itself.  The Johnsons suggest that members of a group
who are attempting to engage in collaborative group work 
focus feedback on group process as well as the specific content of 
the group efforts.  Elaine Kerr (1985,p.16) &quot; Small task-oriented
groups need to occasionally pause to talk about the process itself:
participant rates, the tone of the conversation, conflicts,
feelings about the process, impacts, observations and problems
of using the system, equipment...&quot;  Creating a special time or
electronic space for this type of feedback is vital to the on-going
success of the collaboration.

If the team is to continue to collaborate
and grow as a group, then it will need to 
focus on its own interaction as a group.  Sharing observations
about process in the group can help group members become aware
of where the group is collectively and how individuals 
have contributed to that direction.  Observation of this
nature provides the feedback necessary for groups to 
improve their overall productivity and satisfaction.



====Collaborative Group Productivity suggestions====

Get to Know the members	

	Review the background introduction profiles
	Share fears, success and concerns about collaborative team work
	
Group Memory

As part of the work process it is important to create a group memory or repository of content date.  

	Use the chat room with “record” selected to archive the decisions and discussion.
	Use the discussion forum conference to post and discuss ideas rather than sending individual attachment emails.
	
Project Management Hints
	Create time tables for different phases.

	Set expectations about individual and group deliverables.

	Follow-up discussion and meetings with summarized agreements and reminders of timelines.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Invention: ==
Determining the subject and focus of a writing project; the foundation upon which a composition is constructed.  Or, in two words or less: idea discovery.


==  Questions: ==


=== What do they want from me? ===
Many people begin college composition class assignments with this question, although not many will say it out loud. Well, what do they want from you? First, ask yourself, who is &quot;they&quot;? For many people the only possible &quot;they&quot; is the instructor, but that is not completely true. Behind that instructor is every writing teacher the instructor ever had; the university's general education goals for that class, which can be quite specific; writing theorists the instructor may have read; and of course, the other people in your class who will certainly be reading your writing in peer revision groups. In other words, instead of a single instructor to please, you have an audience.

Luckily, as spokesperson for this audience your instructor has given you a map of sorts -- the assignment sheet. Read this carefully. After reading it, read it again, only this time use a colored marker to highlight key points such as when it's due, page count, type of writing (genre), style (MLA, APA...), and most importantly, anything resembling an ingredients list. If your instructor has given you a bulleted list, you're home free. This is honestly what &quot;they&quot; want.

What if the assignment is vague or uses terms you find unfamiliar? That can happen. What you do then is ask questions, preferably in class when the instructor is going over the assignment for the first time. This may sound obvious, but some students enter college with remnants of the &quot;be cool&quot; attitude left over from high school where sometimes, not always, but sometimes, asking questions was seen as &quot;dumb&quot; or &quot;sucking up&quot; and greeted by eye-rolling or worse by other students. A university is different. Asking questions is what successful students do, and if you have thought of the question, chances are many others in the class have thought of it too and will be grateful that someone spoke up. The instructor will be glad too--questions mean you're paying attention and care whether or not the class goes well for you.

=== What do I know? ===
In anything that you choose to write about, you will have some sort of advanced knowledge. It may not be much, but it will give you a spring-board to a starting point in your research. For instance, if your topic is World War II, think about the key names of leaders and maybe some places involved: Winston Churchill, D-Day, Blitzkrieg. You don't have to know much about a topic, but you can get a start without opening a book if you just think about what you already know. You will probably not know specific statistics or dates at first, but you will know where to start.

=== What do I need to find out? ===
Once you have your general topic—like World War II (WWII), for instance—and you’ve established what you already know about it, then you need to determine what it is you would like to know ''more'' about it.  Because WWII is too vast a subject to read or write about with any detail for the purposes of your instructor’s assignment, you need to narrow your focus to something more specific about WWII.  For instance, you may have jotted down “symbols” when writing down what you already know about the topic.  Therefore, you might decide that you want to know more about what kind of symbols were used during WWII and, even more specifically, what kind of symbols were used by the Nazis to mark their enemies.  So you look through a book about WWII, or you google “WWII symbols,” and you learn that the colors and shapes determined what the wearer's offense was according to the Nazis.  If you decide at this point that you want this to be the specific subject of your paper, then you need to learn as much as you can about the symbols as it relates to WWII, but be wary still that even this topic may be too large for a short paper (i.e. 5-10 pages).  Your subsequent research can be narrowed, however, by asking yourself questions like some of the following: When and why were they designed? What was its function for the wearer and the Nazis? What were the different symbols used for? Which symbol was most used and why? and so on. From there you need to decide on a specific question that you wish to answer in your paper, do the necessary research for that question, and then begin the writing process.

=== What is the point of the paper? ===

Have you ever seen a preview for a movie that was misleading? You thought you were going to see a movie about guys having an adventure in the wilderness and how they survive only to discover the movie is really a documentary about a family of ants. The disappointment and misunderstanding that follows is what your audience will feel like if your topic is not specific, and if the rest of your paper does not make good on the promise of your introductory paragraph, which should give a clear preview of the rest of your paper. 

The point of your paper is to reveal to your audience the details and information about your particular topic. The specific question that you want to answer about your topic will therefore guide your entire paper. The answer is sometimes called a thesis, and much of the writing you will do in university classes is thesis-driven writing. Once you know what your thesis is, you can then make sure that everything in the paper connects to it in some way. The goal is for your paper to look and sound like a crystal stream instead of a muddy ocean. There may be many things that you are interested in discussing in your paper. However, a paper must have one focus (or thesis) to sound clear. 

Once you have your thesis, some of the following brainstorming ideas may be helpful to determine what best fits under your topic. Brainstorming will also help you expand the sub-points. Every topic has the option of a variety of sub-topics, but not all sub-topics go together. You need to decide which sub-topics answer the main question that you are trying to answer. Even if you are really attached to a particular sub-topic -- which at some point you will be -- cut it out! Think of it as the bad boyfriend or girlfriend that you can't seem to let go of, yet you know that letting go is the best choice for everyone involved. Break up with that sub-topic and never look back!

== Sources of Inspiration ==
Many times an instructor will give you the option of choosing your topic for an assignment. This can be a daunting task for anyone. Sometimes having a choice of everything is so big that you end up not being able to think of anything to write about! However, just look around. Something is bound to spark your interest and give you a good starting idea for your assignment.  Any of the following can be sources rich with inspiration for topics to write about:
* Media:
** Art
** Literature
** Music
** Movies
** Other Media (i.e. newspapers, magazines, television, internet-browsing, etc.)
* Dreams:
** Your dreams, whether real-life occupational/career goals, personal wishes/wants, or even those you have while sleeping or staring out the window while driving, can frequently contain topics or ideas worthy of writing about.
* Memories/Experiences:
** Thinking about who you are and the experiences that inform your identity can be a fruitful exercise for coming up with writing topics or ways to approach a particular topic.
* Journalling:
** Keep track of your ideas and emotions on a regular basis. These thoughts can be the starting point for an assignment or may provide those extra details needed to make the paper more effective. Through tons of research, keeping a journal has been proven to help your writing for personal or academic papers. Reflecting on things around you as well as things you read and talk about in class will point you in the direction you need to go to improve your writing skills. 
* Personal Interests
* Discussions with family, friends, colleagues, etc.
* Research
* Imagination
* Browsing:
** &quot;Staring down the Spines&quot;: Go to the library. Stand amongst the shelves of the topic you are going to write about. Staring at or reading the spines of these books can often initiate an inspiration or two.

== Use Pre-writing to: ==

* think more clearly
* establish the beginning of your paper
* keep track of your ideas
* organize your ideas into a conducive paper
* practice expressing yourself in writing

==Prewriting/Writing Activiites==
The following are techniques that can aid in the composition process, either in coming up with ideas or in working through various obstacles along the way:
* Listing:
** Listing allows the writer to accomplish several important tasks: 
*** Finding a topic
*** Determining whether you have enough information for a topic before proceeding: After narrowing down your topic, create a list with everything
*** Narrowing the topic: If writing about World War II, for example, the focus will need to be on a specific component of WWII or there will be too much information. Make a list of everything you know about WWII. Then decide which topic interests you the most by crossing of those topics that don't interest you as much. 
**** &lt;b&gt;Example&lt;/b&gt;: 

&lt;table width=&quot;400&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;2&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;WWII&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;table width=&quot;400&quot; cellspacing=&quot;2&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Hitler&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;concentration camps&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;D-Day&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;Jews&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;Churchill&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;yellow stars&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Axis and Allied forces&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;air raids&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;tanks: M4 tanks, Sherman tanks&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;Pearl Harbor&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;machine guns&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;atomic bomb&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;symbols&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Blitzkrieg&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

* Freewriting:
** Similar to listing, only in this case you simply start writing in sentence form literally anything that comes to mind in context of thinking about your topic and/or assignment.
* Napping:
** Seriously! Taking a 5-10 minute nap can help rejuvenate the mind and relax you enough to release the tension that comes with writing.
* Meditation:
** Finding a place where you can sit in silence for 5-10 minutes and simply focusing on nothing but your breathing can be a surprisingly effective means of &quot;silencing the noise&quot; in your mind prior to writing, allowing you to better focus on the task at hand without internal distractions.
* Mini-computer games:
** When stuck on a topic or during writing, playing simple but repetitive computer games like Minesweeper can help relax the mind (i.e. it serves as a kind of meditation). 
* Outline
** This form of prewriting is geared more toward organization. It groups your thoughts into a definite main point and the supporting detail. So using the topic of &quot;Badges,&quot; the outline would being as follows:
&lt;table width=&quot;400&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;2&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;table width=&quot;400&quot; cellspacing=&quot;2&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;100&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The thing to remember about outlining is that you can't have a support with only one compliment. If you have an &quot;A.&quot; then you have to have a &quot;B.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* Clustering/Brainstorming/Mapping
** Clustering is a primarily visual form of pre-writing. You start out with a central idea written in the middle of the page. You can then form main ideas which stem from the central idea. In this case, you've narrowed the topic down to &quot;Badges.&quot; The ideas stemming from that central idea are all having to do with the central idea, but different aspects of that idea. Once the main ideas contain enough information for you to write about, you can determine in what order you will present the ideas in your paper.

* Storyboarding:
** Storyboarding functions in much the same way as Clustering-Brainstorming. It has definite advantages, though. In storyboarding, the ideas are written on note cards in much the same way a Hollywood screenplay is organized. In this instance, you can write information you have gathered about World War II symbols/badges. For instance, say in your research, you find information on rebellions against badges. You can write all of that information on a note card, but make sure you make a note as to where the information came from so that you can easily go back and check your sources and cite them properly. The next note card will cover another topic, say, types of badges and the employment of those badges. The next card can cover the beginnings of their use, and so on.

== Why Prewrite? ==

Prewriting for even 5 to 20 minutes can help you establish what you already know about a paper topic, as well as aid you in discovering where you would like to go with a paper (i.e. what you want to know).  Doing so can often help prevent you from committing to superficial and/or mundane responses.  Prewriting can help you find strong, thoughtful, and clear answers to questions posed by either the assignment or by your consideration of it.  It can reveal to you those potential areas of personal interest within the writing task: in a manner of speaking, prewriting enables you to &quot;discover&quot; yourself within the context of your topic.  It can also help you nail down responses--to move ideas from short-term memory into long-term or written memory--so that you can get to the work of writing rather than trying to remember what it is you want to say.  That is, your thinking is often more clear and better focused when engaged in actual writing.  As such, prewriting can act as a tool to stave off or break through what is commonly called &quot;writer's block.&quot;

== Overview ==

'''''Canary Creams''''', a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes|Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes]] product, are trick pastries that turns the person eating them briefly into a canary.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

Canary Creams outwardly look like custard creams, but have a spell on them that causes the consumer to change into a large canary. The spell lasts only a few seconds, after which time the canary moults, and the victim returns to his normal shape. The first victim is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville Longbottom]], but he is by no means the last; these bewitched treats, sold by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred and George]] at seven [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Money|Sickles]] apiece, are used extensively in the month between the Triwizard Tournament's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 20|First Task]] and Christmas.

== Analysis ==

Canary Creams seem to play no important part in the story, except perhaps as a prelude to the Skiving Snackbox line that Fred and George will be perfecting in ''[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]''. On their own, they are an indication of the type and extent of the twins' magical abilities, and more specifically of the nature of the tricks that they are likely to play.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Definition==
'''Revising is re-vision--seeing your paper again'''.  Revising is more than correcting spelling errors, it's finding clarity of thought.  It could even be finding new thoughts you didn't have before you started the paper.  You might find yourself getting rid of extra fluff.  

'''As you were writing you were revising''' if you think about it. You had concerns about the paper as you were constructing it. Write those concerns down (make notes in the margin, highlight, make familiar marks) so that you can return to them. Identify what you think are strengths too and bring the rest of your paper to the level you are seeking.

Remember, &quot;A work of art is not a matter of thinking beautiful thoughts or experiencing tender emotions but of intelligence, skill, taste, proportion, knowledge, discipline and industry; especially discipline,&quot; according to Evelyn Waugh, 1903-1966, English novelist, travel writer, and biographer.

==When to Revise==
Your first draft shouldn't be your final draft.  No draft is ever perfect; there's always room for improvement.  You have to have content to work with before you revise.  You may want to allow yourself to finish a complete draft before you hamper the &quot;creative springs&quot; with revisions.  
After you have completed drafting your ideas and have established what you consider to be a complete product of the thoughts you intend to convey, then delve into the revision process.

==Steps==
'''Read carefully''' over your draft several times, with a different purpose in mind to check a specific problem each time (this is where it helps to know your common downfalls with writing).  Look first for content (what you said), then organization (your arrangement of ideas), and finally style (the way you use words).

'''Listen carefully''' to your paper aloud for confusing statements or awkward wording.  Listen for the paper's flow and pay attention to details one idea to the next.  Each idea should come to some sort of conclusion while introducing the next idea, and each idea should relate to the one before it and the one after it.

'''Take time''' between readings.  Allow yourself time to finish a paper (avoid procrastination if possible) so you can put it aside and read it fresh when you go back to it later, to be more objective.

'''Identify the specific problems''' with your weaker elements: ''content, organization, or style''.  Proofreading of mechanical errors, spelling, and punctuation will follow later. 

The '''essential components of content''' are the intended purpose, sufficient support, and that all the details are related to the main idea of your paper.

*Achieving the intended purpose--does it provide explanation, details, argument, or narration?
*Providing sufficient support--does it need more detail, facts, examples to support the topic?
*Including relevant details--do you need to cut any irrelevant &quot;fluff&quot; information?

The '''importance of organization''' is to arrange ideas and details to make the most effective order, and to connect ideas to show a clear logic of thought process.

*Ideas and details are arranged in the most effective order--ideas and details should make your meaning more clear.
*Ideas are logical and clear--use of appropriate transition words to relay the connection of thoughts (such as &quot;therefore&quot;, &quot;for example&quot;) and any use of sentence combining techniques.

The '''power of your style''' will make the meaning clear, interesting for the audience with purpose, and insure the sentences read smoothly.

*Is the meaning clear--did you use vague or general terms where you need to be precise?
*Is the language interesting, appropriate for audience and purpose--is the language to be formal or informal, did you avoid slang and cliches?
*Is it smooth--did you use a variety of sentence structures?

'''Four steps to revising''': add, cut, replace, and reorder. These are the words you can use in the margin of your paper as you read and make decisions to revise. If you know the standard editing marks you can make revision directly to the writing context.
[http://www.teenlit.com/workshop/editing.htm Standard Editing Marks] (with additional common writing errors)

Questions you might ask of your final paper: 
* Are you saying what you mean to say?
* Will your audience understand it? 
* Will it accomplish the purpose?

If you want to be more critical of your writing, judge its readability, clarity, and interest to its audience.

==The Recommended Exercises==
# As you write, keep notes of questionable areas.  An easy way to do this is to write the page number and a portion of the line of text that you find questionable.
# Read the paper aloud several times and listen for mistakes.  Once you are satisfied with your &quot;read aloud&quot; revisions, ask a couple of other people to read it.  You will be surprised by the feedback that you may receive.
# Divide your readings looking for content, organization, continuity, and style.  
# Mark your paper where you want to add, cut, replace, and reorder.  Sometimes it also helps to get out your scissors and literally cut up your paper into chunks so that you can rearrange at random to see what order looks and sounds best to you.
# Take time between readings.  This might mean a short break to eat or walk the dog, for instance, or it might mean a longer break such as returning to your paper in twenty-four hours.  Everyone is different.  Do what works for you.
# Take time while reading.  In other words, take time to reflect on your thoughts.  Read one paragraph at a time, envisioning what you intended to say while keeping your audience in mind.  Sometimes it is helpful to stare at a blank wall while reflecting instead of staring at your paper or computer screen.  This will give your brain a chance for little cat naps, giving it an escape from the chaos of words, information, and eyestrain caused by staring at a computer screen (assuming that you are revising electronically).

==Peer Revision==
Peer revision has added benefits over revising by yourself.  Other people can notice things in your paper that you didn't.  Some instructors set aside class time for peer review, but even if your instructor doesn't, it's a good idea to seek out feedback from a classmate, roommate, or anyone at all who can offer a fresh perspective.  

If you're the one who wrote the paper, make sure you tell your peer what your biggest concern with the paper is.  If you need help writing a conclusion, you don't want your peer to spend time circling grammatical mistakes in a paragraph you were thinking about deleting anyway.  Remember, your peer isn't just there to catch your mistakes, she might have some ideas about new material you can add to make your paper more exciting.

On the other hand, if you're the one who is reviewing your peer's paper, think about what you'd want in her place.  Ask if there's anything she's having trouble with.  Be nice, of course, but don't be so nice that you aren't helpful.  She may like to hear &quot;Good job,&quot; but make sure to explain what you liked about the paper and where you think it could be even better.  Remember, it's not about whether the paper is good or bad, it's about how it can be improved.

You have a responsibility to the student whose paper you are reading.  Be familiar with the qualities and requirements of the assignment.  Consider its merits and shortcomings to provide a complete evaluation and then ask those questions that ask the author about particular segments or certain evidence to support arguments to encourage discussion over the paper.

Possible list of peer revision questions:
# What is the writer's purpose?
# Does the writing include all the necessay characteristics of its particular type (cause-and-effect, narrative, research, etc.)?
# Is the writing organized logically?
# Has the writer used language that enhances her message?
# Is the writing unified/coherent?
# Did you point out the strength(s) or part(s) you found interesting?
# Is there any part that required more information?
# Is there any part that was irrelevant?
# Did you answer any questions the reader had about her writing?

Talking with someone else about your paper will always help you re-evaluate your content.  Sometimes it reassures you that you've got it right; sometimes it reveals to you the places that need work.  It is always a good idea to share your work before submitting the final draft.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What is editing? ==

Editing is sometimes confused with [[Basic_Writing/Revising|Revising]], or with [[Basic_Writing/Proofreading|Proofreading]]. After you feel you've revised the draft as much as is needed, editing comes into play. Editing involves a number of small changes in a draft that can make a big difference in the draft's readability and coherence. Editing can happen at several points in the drafting process--not just at the end to &quot;fix&quot; things that are wrong. When it comes to writing, it isn't so much about making mistakes that you have to correct. No, there is always an assortment of options, many of which are right. Experienced writers learn which choices fit together well for them, and luckily for you, the secret to becoming an experienced writer is to practice. You can do that.


So, what kinds of things happen when editing? Here are a few.

* word changes
* minor sentence rearrangement
* added transitions
* changes for clarity
* minor deletions

== What should I edit for? ==



Three main areas that should be addressed in editing are: Content, Structure, and Mechanics.

When editing the '''content''' of your writing, it is important to make sure your work has a clear focus or main idea.  By asking yourself a few questions, you can avoid incomplete thoughts and/or irrelevant material. The following is a checklist you can use in editing your content:

* I have discovered what is important about my topic.

* I have expressed the main idea clearly.

* I have removed material that is unnecessary, confusing, or irrelevant.



Editing for '''structure''' ensures that your ideas are presented in a logical order. A single idea should be represented in each paragraph. Transitions serve to make the relationships between ideas clear. The following checklist is helpful in editing structure:

* My ideas are logically connected to one another.

* Each paragraph deals with only one major idea.

* I have included appropriate transitional words or phrases.


Refining the '''mechanics''' in the editing phase prevents the reader from being distracted from your ideas. Grammar and usage errors may be avoided by keeping a dictionary or grammar handbook nearby.  A checklist can also help you catch these errors in your writing.

*I have used punctuation marks and capitalization correctly.

*I have checked the spelling of unfamiliar words.

*All subjects and verbs agree.

*I have corrected run-ons and sentence fragments.

*I have used words with the correct meanings in their proper context.



Let's look at a paragraph that is ready for editing.

== An editing example ==

=== Scrooge McDuck ''(pre-editing)''===

&lt;blockquote&gt;Scrooge McDuck is a rich and famous lucky duck that has it all: the luxurious
mansion, 3 intelligent and athletic nephews (and one niece that gets in the way), a global
industry in his name that sells anything and everything, and skyscraper sized vault of
gold coins, rubies, and iconic bags of money. Scrooge McDuck would have it all if it
weren’t for one minute problem. Every other day someone tries to steal his money.
People have moved it into the ocean and tried to claim salvage rights. They’ve moved it
away with magic, futuristic helicopters, and old-fashioned diesel trucks. Scrooge has
researched every possible idea to keep people out of his money bin. Now he needs to
solve that problem once and for all.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''This is a pretty good introduction to an essay that's about finding the best possible solution to a problem for a fictional character. However, taking a closer look and making a few small changes could make it even better.''

=== Scrooge McDuck: the Money and the Mayhem (''edited version'') ===
&lt;blockquote&gt;Scrooge McDuck is a rich and famous lucky duck that has it all: the luxurious mansion, '''three''' intelligent and athletic nephews''',''' and one niece that gets in the way'''. Owner of''' a global industry in his name that sells anything and everything '''as well as a''' skyscraper sized vault of gold coins, rubies, and iconic bags of money''','''  Scrooge McDuck would have it all if it weren’t for one '''tiny''' problem.  Every other day someone tries to steal his money.  People have moved it into the ocean and tried to claim salvage rights.  They’ve moved it away with magic, futuristic helicopters, and old-fashioned diesel trucks.  '''Viewers of ''Ducktales'' know that''' Scrooge has researched every possible idea to keep people out of his money bin. Now he needs to solve that problem once and for all.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==An editing exercise==

'''Word Choice'''

Sample Sentence: Technology is bad for people.

Edited Sentence: Technology harms our sense of community.

The edited sentence is an improvement because it uses more specific language. We learn that technology is not only harmful, but we also learn what it harms.

'''Transitions'''

Sample Sentence: I hated multiplication. I failed my math class.

Edited Sentence: I hated multiplication; therefore I failed my math class.

The transition &quot;therefore&quot; makes a connection between the two thoughts, making the reader see that failing the math class was a result of hating multiplication.

'''Sentence Structure'''

Sample Sentence: There was two boys in the hall.

Edited Sentence: There were two boys in the hall.

In the sample sentence, the subject and verb do not agree. In the edited sentence, the subject and the verb agree.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Editing and the Writing Process: ==


A major question that students will probably find themselves asking is this: How do I know when to edit a paper?  As a matter of fact, there is no simple answer to that question.  Writing is a process that involves several steps, and these steps do not always occur in a straight line.  Writing any sort of text is a circular rather than a linear process.  Writers are rarely completely finished with one step, even after they move onto the next.  

Most people tend to think that editing tends to happen sometime near the completion of the paper.  In fact, that is not always the case.  While the most important part of writing is simply the ability to express yourself and get ideas across, it can sometimes be helpful to take a quick break from drafting or revising and to spend some time editing.  Sometimes, playing with word choice, sentence structure, or transitions can help stimulate your mind, leading to new ideas.  Thus, it's important to realize that editing is not necessarily a one-step action, but rather something that can be done throughout the entire writing process.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Definition of Proofreading ==
Proofreading is the process of carefully reviewing a text for errors, especially surface errors such as spelling, punctuation, grammar, formatting, and typing errors.

== Proofreading vs. Editing ==
While the terms ''proofreading'' and ''editing'' are often used interchangeably, they do differ slightly.

[[Basic_Writing/Editing|Editing]] is typically completed throughout the writing process&amp;mdash;especially between drafts&amp;mdash;and often suggests contextual changes that affect the overall meaning and presentation. The focus is on changes that affect style, point-of-view, organization of content, audience, etc. 

Proofreading occurs later in the writing process, usually just after the final editing and before the final draft that will be presented for publication (or turned in to a professor). The focus is on correcting errors in spelling, syntax, grammar, punctuation, and formatting. 

While some editing will inevitably be done during the proofreading process and vice versa&amp;mdash;the writing process is not perfectly linear, after all&amp;mdash;focusing on proofreading too early in the writing process is often inefficient because with each revision new errors are introduced. In other words, one does not want to spend a lot of time correcting sentences and paragraphs that may soon be rewritten or even deleted completely.

== Examples of Common Errors ==

While many types of errors exist in writing, there are some that are more common and definitely more noticeable.  Some of these errors include spelling, capitalization, punctuation, grammar, subject\verb agreement, and word usage. 

A word processor's spell-checker will detect most '''spelling''' mistakes.  However, if you are writing a paper out longhand, using a good college-edition dictionary can help you prevent many of these mistakes (unless of course, you also can't guess which letter begins the word). If you lack a spelling-bone (I think it's near the funny bone because it is another bone that hurts when it bumps against something), a good strategy to use is to keep a notebook of problem words. You can add words to it each time you have to look a word up in the dictionary, and eventually you will have your own mini-dictionary of words to check more closely. Some people still prefer to do the old grade-school thing and write the word out in longhand twelve times, sounding it out as you write. For example, ''surprise''.  Sounded out, it is ''sǔr'' (as in Big Sur in California) ''prise'' (where the ''i'' sounds like a French ''ee'' vowel sound, and you can picture yourself being surprised while sipping espresso on the ''Rive Gauche'' in Paris. The sound and the image combined may help you remember the spelling.

Punctuation errors most often involve the '''comma''', which means knowing when and how to use one. Of course, that's easier said than done. The '''comma splice''' seems to be an especially common error among writers.  A ''comma splice'' is defined as a sentence that contains two or more complete sentences joined together by a comma. American university professors tend to see it as a major mechanical error. Rumor has it that once in the distant past there was a university in Colorado where any paper with even a single comma splice would receive an automatic F with no exceptions allowed. Hopefully, no extreme cases like that exist now, but avoid comma splices if you're writing for an American audience. If you are in Great Britain, that's another story&amp;mdash;comma splices are cheerfully ignored for the most part. Audience truly matters in writing, even on the grammatical/mechanical level. 

Although some style guides list nearly two dozen comma rules, there are basically five comma rules you need to know:

1. Use a comma with a coordinating conjunction to join two independent clauses.
In Layman's terms, fix a comma splice by adding one of the following: and, but, for, so, or, nor, or yet.

2. Use a comma to set off non-essential information in a sentence. 
Basically, put commas around extra information that is not part of the main idea. 

3. Use a comma in lists or items in a series.

4. Use commas in addresses and dates.

5. Use a comma between adjectives if they make sense with the order reversed or with &quot;and&quot; inserted in between them.


The Wildcard Rule: There are always exceptions to the rules, and often it is just a matter of personal preference and style. Think about your purpose and your audience; then decide whether or not a comma makes the sentence clearer or is just an extra mark on the page. Sometimes having too many commas is a worse problem than not having enough commas.

'''Verb tense''' and '''subject/verb agreement''' are also key errors that should be looked for when proofreading a paper.  The subject should always agree with the verb in tense and number.  These verb issues are often overlooked or unnoticed while writing an initial draft but can usually be caught with a good proofread. 

Methods on how to find these verb tense problems, among with other mistakes, will be discussed in the next section.

== Strategies for Finding Errors ==

It's often difficult to find your own errors.  In this section we will discuss how to look at your own work carefully to spot errors.

The first thing to do is to allow some time between writing and proofreading.   Some people recommend letting a text set as long as two weeks before looking over it for mistakes, but that is usually not practical. Instead, try to give yourself at least one full day between finishing your draft and proofreading. In other words, sleep on it. If the deadline is quickly approaching or it is due the next morning, take as much time as you can--an hour or two will do wonders. At minimum, try to take at least take fifteen minutes after the completion of the paper before going back and proofreading.  This allows you to look at the same piece of work with a clear eye and a fresh mind. 

Second, the paper should be read aloud. Can you make it through without stumbling over anything?  Many grammar or word usage errors are not picked up on until the piece is read aloud.  Also, have someone else read your work for you (aloud, if possible, so you can hear where the words or punctuation are leading the reader away from your intended meaning).  A peer or family member with some distance can also let you know if the progression of the paper needs help, or if something doesn't quite make sense. Do not be afraid to strike out a passage that you thought sounded great, but others are having a hard time understanding.

You can also read the work backwards, one sentence at a time.  This helps determine if each sentence, independent of anything else, makes sense.  Ask yourself these questions: Are the sentences complete? Does each sentence have a subject (who or what the sentence is about) and a predicate (what's happening in the sentence)?  Note which ones need to be changed and why.

Finally, get help!  If you're not sure about something, such as the use of a comma or spelling, find a resource or assistance.  You can use the writing center at your school, a tutor, the internet, or something as convenient and portable as a grammar book or dictionary!

== Common Errors and Correction Strategies ==

=== Spelling ===
 
Don't forget to use your word processor's spell-check feature to identify spelling mistakes.  Do a quick visual check for squiggly lines, run the actual spell-check function, and then do a closer check for misspellings or wrong word choices that the spell-checker missed. Although spell-checking is important and should not be skipped, a real-live human can often catch errors that computer software will miss because people are more capable of understanding words in context. For example, spell-check software can't always tell whether ''their'', ''there'', or ''they're'' fits in a specific sentence, but a person can always figure it out by looking at the definitions for these homonyms. 

Don't forget the low-tech solution: always use a dictionary to confirm any word you're unsure about. Although the built-in dictionary that comes with your word processor is a great time-saver, it falls far short of a college-edition dictionary in paper or CD form. So, if  spell-check suggests bizarre corrections for one of your words, it could be that you know a word it doesn't. When in doubt, check a dictionary to be sure.

===Punctuation===

This section will provide useful information on Standard American punctuation: its usage, pitfalls, etc.

=== Fragments ===

By definition, a fragment is a group of words that is punctuated like a sentence, but that lacks either a subject or a verb. For example: &quot;Full five year warranty and free oil changes!&quot;  People use fragments like this in advertisements all the time, but when you are writing for an academic audience, which is far less forgiving of purposeful fragments, your readers may assume that you just don't know the sentence is a fragment. They may conclude that if you got that wrong, you might be wrong about your content too. 

So, how can you do find fragments in your own writing? First, find the main verb.  Then, find the subject for that verb. 

You could correct the example sentence in the following way: 

* '''Original:''' Full five year warranty and free oil changes!
* '''Add verb:''' Receive a full five year warranty and free oil changes!
* '''Add subject and verb:''' New customers receive a full five year warranty and free oil changes!

Built-in grammar-checkers are fairly good at spotting fragments, but occasionally go overboard and mark a sentence as a fragment when it is not. Use your own judgment and read each one independently while asking the questions provided above.

=== Subject-Verb Agreement ===
Below are some examples of errors with subject/verb agreement.  Take some time and see if you can figure out what the error is in these sentences.  

'''Original:'''  The dog need to go on a walk.

'''Revised''':   The dog needs to go on a walk. 

--The subject in the original sentence (dog) is singular. The verb (need) is plural.  The verb needs to be changed from plural to singular form in order to agree with the subject.

'''Original:'''  Chris and Molly goes for walks often in the evening.

'''Revised:'''   Chris and Molly go for walks often in the evening.  

--In this case the verb started out as a singular form. It needed to be changed to plural to fit with Chris and Molly (plural subject).

A quick way to check for subject/verb agreement is to circle the verb and underline the subject of each sentence. Make sure that if the subject is plural, you use a plural form of the verb. If you can not identify subjects and verbs this method will not be practical, and you should seek guidance online, at your school's writing center, or from an instructor first. 

One last source for finding tips on correcting common errors is online tutors and workshops.  Use internet searches to help you with anything you might be struggling with!

== More ==

If it feels like you keep repeating the same words throughout your writing, pull out a thesaurus for ideas on different, more creative choices. A thesaurus can add just enough color and depth to a piece that otherwise seems mundane.  Be careful, though, that the word you substitute has the intended meaning.  Thesauruses provide words with similar meanings, not identical meanings--so if you are unsure look up the new word in the dictionary!

== Proofreading with a Word Processor ==
There are many word processing programs available, and probably the most popular and most commonly used one so far is Microsoft Word. However, with the advent of Microsoft Vista and the lack of easy back-compatibility between new Word and even past versions of Word (including Word from Office 2003), that may change and open source alternatives such as [http://openoffice.org/ Open Office] may gain popularity. That issue aside, one thing all word processors have in common is this: although a word processor is a great tool for writing and includes many special functions that can help a student check for errors such as spelling, punctuation, grammar, repeated words, formatting, and so on, it is not a perfect solution for all problems.  When students write, they should be especially aware of the errors the software does not find. This can be a real problem when an assignment is graded for all aspects of the writing process. One of the biggest mistakes a student can make is thinking, &quot;No problem, my word processor will catch all the mistakes for me.&quot;
 
There is no computer program written that can look at every word in context. As great as word processing software is, compared to the human mind it is still extremely limited when it comes to processing language. Even the simple task of spell-checking using a spell-checker tool is not error-free.  Although it can find misspelled or unrecognized words, it cannot always differentiate between homonyms. For example, it does not always distinguish between the words ''to'', ''too'', or ''two''.  Another problem can arise if your word processor is not set up to correct a certain error. For instance, many spell-checkers are set by default to disregard words in all capital letters because many people do not want it to spell check acronyms. In this case, the word PROOFREEDING would not be caught as a misspelled word because it is in all capital letters. 

Despite their many limitations, spelling and grammar-checkers, while not perfect, do help find common errors.  However, the best tool that you can use to spot errors is your own eye. Spend the time to look over your writing carefully to make an honest attempt at turning in that elusive error-free paper, AKA by editors as ''clean copy.''

== Proofreading Examples ==
In the earlier section about proofreading using a word processor, it was mentioned that although software can correct spelling errors or alert you to unrecognized words, it cannot distinguish between words that sound alike (homonyms). Take a look at the examples containing misspelled words below and see if you can find the wrong word in each sentence. Although there are no spelling mistakes, each sentence does contain a mistake in word usage.

#  What will today's students listen to when they are in their 40s? Is disco music in there future as well?
#  Coach Thompson's team won ten consecutive Big Twelve Conference crowns, and tied the NCAA record with nine consecutive NCAA champion from 1978-1986.  
#  Life experience sometimes plays an important roll in how and what a student may write about.  
#  During the parade, they band members marched in unison.
#  Do you think computers have changed are everyday life?  
#  The store at the end of the block does not except checks any longer.  
#  One study showed that of the countries 250 million people, almost 10% still smoke.  
#  As evidence has shone, the crime rate in the city has dropped in the last decade.  
#  If writing is such an important part of the school curriculum, than why are so many students having problems with the essay assignment.
#  I was raised in a home were rock and roll music was not allowed.  

By understanding that proofreading requires a slow, deliberate analysis of what you have written, you will be able to recognize the trouble with the sentences above, and be better prepared to recognize the same type of problems in the future.


== Corrections and commentary for the above examples ==


#  What will today's students listen to when they are in their 40s? Is disco music in '''their''' future as well? ''&quot;There&quot; should be &quot;their&quot; because the second form shows possession. It is their future because it belongs to them.'' 
#  Coach Thompson's team won ten consecutive Big Twelve Conference crowns, and tied the NCAA record with nine consecutive NCAA '''championships''' from 1978-1986. &quot;champion&quot; should be &quot;championships&quot; because champions win championships. The former refers to the players, the latter to the titles they hold.  
#  Life experience sometimes plays an important '''role''' in how and what a student may write about. ''&quot;Roll&quot; should be &quot;role.&quot; The first &quot;roll&quot; refers to the verb roll or the rolls you eat at Thanksgiving, someone's role is the part they play in something.''    
#  During the parade, '''the''' band members marched in unison. ''&quot;They&quot; should be &quot;the,&quot; and is a common typo--the type that suggests sloppiness on the part of the writer, nonetheless.'' 
#  Do you think computers have changed '''our''' everyday life?  ''&quot;Are&quot; should be &quot;our.&quot; Although some people pronounce them alike, &quot;are&quot; is a verb (a form of be) while &quot;our&quot; shows the possession of a group. (People are busy during the holidays. Our family still manages to get together.) '' 
#  The store at the end of the block does not '''accept''' checks any longer. ''&quot;except&quot; should be &quot;accept.&quot; &quot;Except&quot; forms the base for the word &quot;exception&quot; and shares a similar meaning; &quot;accept&quot; forms the base for the word &quot;acceptance&quot; and shares a similar meaning.''   
#  One study showed that of the '''country's''' 250 million people, almost 10% still smoke. ''&quot;Countries&quot; should be &quot;country's.&quot; &quot;Countries&quot; is the plural form (i.e., more than one country); &quot;country's&quot; is the possessive form and shows that something belongs to the country.''  
#  As evidence has '''shown''', the crime rate in the city has dropped in the last decade. ''&quot;shone&quot; should be &quot;shown.&quot; &quot;Shone&quot; is a form of the verb &quot;shine,&quot; while &quot;shown&quot; is a form of the verb &quot;show.&quot;'' 
#  If writing is such an important part of the school curriculum, '''then''' why are so many students having problems with the essay assignment? ''&quot;Than&quot; should be &quot;then.&quot; &quot;Than&quot; shows relationship when comparing two things, while &quot;then&quot; shows a time relationship. Ex: First I went to the store. Then, I went home.'' 
#  I was raised in a home '''where'''  rock and roll music was not allowed. ''&quot;Were&quot; should be &quot;where.&quot; Were is a form of the verb &quot;be,&quot; while &quot;where&quot; indicates a location or speech.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction to Drafting ==

'''Drafting''' is writing and drafting is a vital part of successful writing. The reason you will need to use drafting is that it can lay the fundamental framework of your final paper. If you lay the framework well, you'll have a good chance of writing a beautiful paper, however, if you do a poor job on the framework, success could be much more difficult to attain. The following section will take you through the drafting process(es) with instructions and handy tips. 
=== Nobody gets it right the first time ===

Whether a writer is the next Ernest Hemingway or a student at any level, drafting must be done as a part of successful writing. If a professional writer says that he/she never writes more than one draft you can pretty much bet they are joking or not telling the truth. Even when writers work to deadline and write at a single sitting, they return to parts of it again and again in order to get it just right. Also, a deadline doesn't always mean done; writers can and do return to an already published piece and revise to make it better. 

It does not matter whether the work is a research paper or a poem, all forms of writing need to be drafted. Since a professional writer almost never gets a piece of writing perfect in the first draft, don't feel bad if you need several drafts too. So, if you find yourself very unhappy about your first try at a paper think of it as just the start of something better, i.e. the rough draft. Another advantage to multiple drafts is that the more drafting you do the more chances you have of catching mistakes and improving the paper. This is why it is so important to make time for multiple drafts during the writing process. The time spent drafting will bring you closer to than ever to a more glorious version of your final draft.

=== The importance of just getting it on the page ===
Not much can be done for a piece of writing until it is on paper or computer screen. You may worry that the paper will not be very good or even think that it will be awful, yet you won't really know until you've actually written it. Not only will you and your reader(s) not be able to see what you have written, but there is no chance of working to fix what has not yet been written. For more ideas of how to actually get your words down look at the pre-writing section below.

== Pre-writing ==

=== Brainstorming ===
Brainstorming is one of the most effective pre-writing techniques you can use.  It’s virtually painless and can be pretty fun, if you let it!  Brainstorming is easy because there are NO RULES.  Let your mind wander and think about things that you would like to explore more.  Try to create a mental web of things you can connect to one another.  Let the lightning of ideas strike you as they may.  Ask yourself a few starter questions such as:

What interests me?

If I choose this subject can I meet the word/page requirements?

Are there other researchers out there thinking like me?

What topics are related to my topic of interest?  

What about the topic can I make into a thesis?

Where is there an arguable side of this topic?

Can I see and argue both sides?

What other topics interest me?

Is there anything in the media that I can make into a paper?

How might this affect my daily life?

What kind of examples can illustrate my point?

Is this a fresh/creative topic? Has it become too common?

These questions and others you might create will help you get started on your writing process.  Before you even put pen to paper or fingers to keys (If you do have a good idea, WRITE IT DOWN, that way you don’t forget it!).  Once you have a topic in mind then you’re ready to move on to the harder stuff.

=== Free writing ===
Free writing can also be pretty fun if you let it.  Once you have the main topic of your argument, then it is time to begin getting your ideas on paper.  The purpose of free writing is to do just that.  Again, with free writing, there are no set rules as to how to proceed.  Many teachers will use this technique as a way to jumpstart your creativity and get you thinking.  In doing free writing before your paper you will need to write for several (8-10) minutes about your topic.  Even if you jump off topic continue writing because you might come back around to the topic or discover a new way in which you might consider going with your topic.

You might want to begin by writing down all the ideas you have about your topic.  Write down things you think will eventually serve as your main points.  Think about how you would argue with someone who disagreed with your point of view.  What would you tell them?  Could you back it up with actual evidence? 
Note: at this point you won’t necessarily need actual evidence, but you will want to have a good idea of the kinds of things out there that you can use to back up your claim.

This is the point where your argument starts to pull together and you will probably find that you have more ideas and points than will ever fit into your argument, but then you can choose the best of the points and make your argument even stronger.

=== Outlines ===
Outlines and rough outlines are where you begin to form the skeleton of your paper.  They will be the pattern from which you write your argument.  The outline serves as a way to organize you thoughts into a comprehensive process that flows smoothly from one point to another.

The formatting of an outline also helps you to create organization within your paper.
Here is an example outline to help you learn the format and organization it will give your argument.  
I. This is your main topic.  It can also be your title.  What are you going to talk about?

A. This is your introductory paragraph.  Give your intro topic sentence.

1. State your thesis.  You should have a clear and developed thesis by now.

B.  This is the body of your argument.	

1. Main point #1

a. Supporting evidence for main point #1

b. More supporting evidence for point #1

c. Acknowledge and dismiss the other side of the argument

2. Main point #2

a. Supporting evidence for point #2

b. More supporting evidence for point #2

c. Acknowledge and dismiss other side of the argument

C. This is the conclusion of your argument

a. Restate your thesis

b. Summarize your argument

Note: you may have several more main points than this outline has, but they all follow the same basic structure.

== Types of Drafts ==

=== Rough draft ===
A rough draft is a very important step in the writing process. Writing more than one draft gives you the opportunity to catch problems and see where the paper may not be working. So, it is a very good idea to leave yourself with enough time to write at least two or three drafts of your paper. You may want to do an outline to plan your paper beforehand, but doing that is not always necessary. 
After you get your thoughts, any possible research and or sources needed in order you can begin actually writing. While you write your rough draft you may not feel completely satisfied about the paper, but that's okay because that is what a rough draft is for. You want to give yourself a chance to work to get to the best arrangement of ideas and find different ways of expressing them.

==== Form: intro, body, conclusion and paragraph ====
Start it, say it, finish it--that's an academic writing draft in its simplest form. 

Start it. The introduction starts it all. That's where you get the reader involved in what you are writing about and along the way, also get them interested in what you have to say. At the end of the introduction section, many forms of academic writing have a thesis--the main idea or claim.

Say it. Say what you have to say, and don't forget to set up a sequence of ideas that will eventually lead to the conclusion. Each idea or &quot;point&quot; needs room to breathe, so give it its own paragraph, at the very least. Supporting details and examples will also help.

Finish it. The conclusion wraps it all up in a way that doesn't just repeat the thesis--it makes it both bigger and more specific. The terminology for this kind of writing is &quot;synthesis.&quot; In synthesis, the whole is greater than its parts, and that is exactly what a good conclusion does.

Needless to say, each part involves using paragraphs, but it's helpful at the drafting stage to think more about &quot;sections.&quot; An introduction can be more than one paragraph. A body needs to be more than one paragraph. A conclusion can be one paragraph, but can be more. If your natural tendency when drafting is to move full-steam ahead in one long paragraph with the intention of breaking it up later, it's worth the effort to slow down a bit and make those paragraph breaks as you write. Your draft will be better organized in the long run, a good thing for you and your future reader.

==== Process: getting started, getting past writing blocks ====
All writers can suffer from those horrible writing blocks, but there are ways around them. 
If you are having a hard time with the beginning, work on other sections of the paper and come back to the beginning later. You do not have to write strictly from beginning to conclusion. If you have an idea for a certain section write it first.  Get that idea out of your head and onto the paper because in doing so, you just might think of a brilliant way to begin your paper.   
Also, depending on how much time you have to work you may want to take an hour or a day to get away from your paper. Sometimes a little time away from a project can help clear your head and give your ideas more definitions as well as clarity.

=== Process between drafts: Intermediate drafts, editing, MLA, etc. ===
Here the process between drafts is kind of overlapping with two of the other sections, they are, '''Revising''' and '''Editing'''. Actually, the intermediate drafts are a process of revising your former drafts again and again.   You need to look at what you think is not proper or good enough and think of ways that better explain your points to your readers. For more details, you may want to refer to the other two sections about how you could make better draft amendments step by step.

=== Final draft ===
Yes! You are coming to the final draft now! However, this is not the end of your final paper yet! The overall structure of the writing construction has already been done, so we could say that you've achieved a half-success! Still, you need to go beyond drafting to the further sections which will be sure to guide you to completion of your paper! Keep up the hard work and you will be glad you went through so many drafts, all that hard work just might eventually pay off in a big way!

There are several [[w:Integrated development environment|IDEs]] available for Python. A list can be found here: http://wiki.python.org/moin/IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironments

== Installing Python PyDEV Plug-in for Eclipse IDE ==

You can [[Using Eclipse|use the Eclipse IDE]] as your Python IDE. The only requirement is Eclipse and the Eclipse PyDEV Plug-in.

Go to http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/ and get the proper Eclipse IDE version for your OS platform. There are also updates on the site, but just look for the basic program, Download and install it. The install just requires you to unpack the downloaded Eclipse install file onto your system.

You can install PyDEV Plug-in two ways:
* '''Suggested:''' Use Eclipse's update manager, found in the tool bar under &quot;Help&quot; -&gt; &quot;install new Software&quot;. add http://pydev.org/updates/ in &quot;work with&quot; click add, and select PyDEV ,and click &quot;Next&quot; and let Eclipse do the rest.  Eclipse will now check for any updates to PyDEV when it searches for updates.
** If you get an error stating a requirement for the plugin &quot;org.eclipse.mylyn&quot;, expand the PyDEV tree, and deselect the optional mylyn components.
* Or install PyDEV manually, by going to http://pydev.sourceforge.net and get the latest PyDEV Plug-in version. Download it, and install it by unpacking it into the Eclipse base folder.

== Python Mode for Emacs ==

There is also a python mode for [[w:emacs|Emacs]] which provides features such as running pieces of code, and changing the tab level for blocks.  You can download the mode at https://launchpad.net/python-mode

== Installing new modules ==
Although many applications and modules have searchable webpages, there is a [http://www.python.org/pypi central repository] for searching packages for installation, known as the &quot;Cheese Shop&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Import of terminology from ANSI into DVX is vey slow. This is probably because of the checking for duplicates. There is a tool TDBImport.exe that imports terminology from ANSI files, without performing the duplicates check. Import speed with this tool is OK. Only Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Spanish, Swedisch are supported as languages.

== A few words about ERP systems ==
== Basic Ideas ==

ERP systems are quite complicated - they have to implement as much as possible the business logic of a company. ERP5 distinguish itself from other ERP systems (open and closed source) with its coherency from the lowest - theoretical - level. It is based on a well developed theoretical model and to understand the key concepts of ERP5 it is needed to understand briefly that model. Of course basic understanding of technical aspects is needed too.

=== Five classes - introduction ===

ERP5 defines an abstract model of business management. Thanks to a clean abstraction layer, new or specialised business modules can be implemented in a consistent way. This abstract business model can both be used to represent internal management activities as well as commercial and management activities across a group of companies

The ERP5 abstract model is based on 5 classes:

* '''Resource''': a resource describes an abstract resource in a business process (e.g. a skill of an individual, a currency, a raw material, a product). Relations between nodes allow to define BOM (Base Object Model) as well as prototypes.

* '''Node''': a node is a place which can receive amounts of resources and send amounts of resources. Nodes can relate to physical entities (e.g. a workshop which receives raw material, processes it and sends it) or abstract entities (e.g. a bank account which can receive money). Stocks are a kind of Node. Metanodes are nodes which contain other nodes. A company is a metanode. A project is both a resource and a node.

* '''Movements''': a movement describes the movement of an amount of resource between two nodes at a given time and for a given duration. For example, a movement may send raw material from a stock to a workshop, another movement may send money from one account to another.

* '''Path''': a path allows to define a way for a node to access a resource it may eventually need. Prices and commercial profiles may be attached to a path in order to define the default price for a given resource procured at a given maker. Path may also define the way a workshop gets its resource from a stock. Path have a start date and an end date. Path may be used to represent the assignment of an individual to a temporary project.

* '''Item''': an item describes a physical instance of a resource. A movement can be expanded into a series of trackable movements through items. items also allow to define how a given amount of resources was actually shipped (e.g. parcels, serial numbers of items in each container, etc.)

Those five classes are sufficient to represent business ranging from chemical plants to manufacturing, trading or services, and can model everything that goes on in an organisation. For example:

* a sale of goods is a movement of a certain quantity of a product (resource) from our company (node) to the buyer (node) at a given price (path)

* an accounting entry is a movement of some money (resource) between two accounts (nodes)

* an phone call is a movement of an employee's time (resource) between the two interlocutors

* a training is a movement of skill (resource) from nowhere (surprise!) to the trainee

It sounds very abstract, but that's exactly why it is so powerful...

Modelling reality like this, we use the same attributes to describe very different things: every movement has its source and destination, plus some variations of them (e.g. in sale transaction source is a physical location from which goods are shipped, while source_section is the owner who is selling the goods). And we can use standard, optimised API to calculate the results.

The key question is always: how much do we have of (this or that). In this model, a node doesn't really have &quot;content&quot;; when we want to know how much goods are there in a warehouse, or what is the amount on account, or how much time our support guy spent answering phone calls, we sum up quantities of all movements incoming to and outgoing from the node. For this, we use a standard &quot;getInventory&quot; method which serve every purpose of this kind.

=== Simulation model ===

Simulations are one of the most powerful features of ERP5, although they are entirely hidden from the user. The idea is that movements which are supposed to have an impact on the future - or, in other words, which are going to cause some other movements - are equipped with so-called &quot;rules&quot; which are used to generate &quot;simulation movements&quot;, which in turn can have their own rules and generate further simulation movements, thus &quot;simulating&quot; the future of our business. When the future becomes present and it's time to create real movements, we use simulation movements to check what, how much, for whom etc.

It is best explained on an example: if we accept a sale order, we know we'll sooner or later have to ship; and once we ship, we'd like to invoice; and once we invoice, we are going to get money. So a sale order is broken into lines, each line representing delivery of one product, and each line generates a simulation movement representing shipment. Shipment then generates simulated invoice line, etc.

The benefit of this is twofold:
* once we accepted an order, we can get a financial forecast straight from the system
* when we start packing, we can aggregate orders in any way we like - we don't have to pack order by order, instead we can generate a separate packing list for each product line, or combine all orders from the same customer into one big list, or even do both - create a separate packing list for products from the same product line ordered by the same customer over the last month, for instance. The point is to equip our ERP5 with appropriately configured &quot;builders&quot; which will do the job.

=== Affiliation between MySQL and ZODB ===

In ERP5 all objects are put into ZODB (Zope Object Database) and they are indexed in SQL database (run on MySQL RDBMS). Such attitude results in fast object searching and access, and from other side - easy object manipulation.

=== User interface - listboxes, views ===
=== Reporting and printing ===

Reports allow users to generate summaries and specifications for the data stored in modules. Reports can be generated in two forms: an '''OpenOffice.org document''' or a '''PDF form'''.

[[Image:Report_icon_snap.png|frame|A place on a form where icon appears.]]

Reports are attached to the specific module. If there are any reports defined for that module, then on the standard module view form, with a listbox containing that module's data, the report icon will appear in the toolbar. (if there's no data the icon will still appear :) )

Although reports are in this way associated with the module and one expects to find data related to the module, they may practically contain any kind of data.

The detailed HowTos on creating reports may be found on ERP5 Wiki pages, both for [http://www.erp5.org/HowToCreateOOReport OpenOffice reports] and [http://www.erp5.org/HowToCreatePdfForm PDF reports]. There is also a guide on [http://www.erp5.org/HowToAddAReport how to add created reports to ERP5 site].

=== Background process invocation - CMFActivity system ===
ERP system logic might be very complicated - any scripts can be attached to any object in the system. It is possible that on encumbered systems the server resources become overloaded. The advantage of this approach is that the consultant or application manager might want to have the ability to set up some scripts one by one, or to choose some special conditions which will happen before invoking some actions.

ERP5 provides a built-in background process invocation system called '''CMFActivity'''. With this the resource-consuming tasks can be prioritised and put into background. They will be invoked in whatever desired order, one at a time, such that resources of the machine won't be overconsumed. After invoking such tasks an icon appears on the user interfaces of objects which are directly related to this object, informing the user that this object is waiting to be processed by a pending activity.

On a properly configured system '''CMFActivity''' may send messages about failed tasks. Developers and consultants are able to attach a special console - from Zope, and even from a system shell - to observe, cancel or force invocation of activities.

In technical sense every task put into activity is a row in the SQL table. Here is described with each object what activity shall be run, what that activity is and other properties. '''CMFActivity''' supports clustering and load-balancing of task queues.

In depth background process invocation is described on the ERP5 wiki page [http://wiki.erp5.org/HowToUseTheCmfActivityTool HowToUseTheCmfActivityTool].

=== Categories ===

The ERP5 system is based on categories, they are used to define the categorization and descriptive relation between objects in the system. 

Categories are accessible and configurable through the Zope interface. To do this, go to:

[your_site]/portal_categories

(user &quot;zope&quot; can access if from the &quot;My favourites&quot; dropdown menu in the top left corner)

You will see a long list of &quot;Base Categories&quot;. Click on any of them, you'll see it has lots of fields which you don't need to know anything about at this stage. Under the Action dropdown menu there is an option with which you can create a sub-category. Then you can create sub-sub-categories, and for each of those sub-sub-sub-categories, and so on ''ad infinitum''.

Some base categories (region, site, group, function, skill...) are used for categorization, so you can build your trees within them; others (source, destination, subordination...) are used for setting relations between objects, and they don't need any subcategories.

The system accesses categories using special accessors, which makes categories translatable.

==== Categorization usage ====

By defining a tree in a given base category a consultant is able to set up categorization with required depth. Examples of categorization categories are:
* region - to tell where a Person lives or where the Organisation has its headquarters
* skill - to tell who can do what
* quantity_unit - for definitions of quantity units for resources
* delivery_mode - describes modes of transport for orders
* gap - used for General Accounting Plan

The beauty of this category mechanism in ERP5 is that you can assign an object to one or more categories at your discretion, and that the notion of &quot;category membership&quot; goes all the way up the base category tree (meaning that if an object belongs to category &quot;a/b/c&quot;, it belongs to category &quot;a/b&quot; and &quot;a&quot; too. That way, you can set up a category tree:

 skill/dance
 skill/dance/latino
 skill/dance/latino/samba
 skill/dance/latino/salsa
 skill/dance/latino/rumba
 skill/dance/classic
 skill/dance/classic/waltz
 skill/dance/classic/tango
 skill/dance/ballet
 skill/coding/c

Then assign persons to categories:

;Joan:skill/dance/latino/samba
:skill/dance/classic/tango

;Mary:skill/dance/latino

;Paul:skill/dance/ballet

;Peter:skill/coding/c

Now, if you ask the system who can dance samba - you get Joan, Latino - you get Mary and Joan, classic/tango - Joan, classic - Joan, too; ask who can dance anything - you get Mary, Joan and Paul; and if you want to know who can't dance at all, you can get it too. All by using auto-generated accessor methods, without any fuss. 

To see it in action, go to the &quot;Persons&quot; module and turn on the &quot;domain tree&quot; mode of the module's listbox; select &quot;skill&quot; from the dropdown, and you can browse your dancing resources.

If you plan to open a dance school, then the system is perfect for you.

Have a look at the [[ERP5_Handbook/Understanding_listboxes|Understanding listboxes]] section for more details, and some screenshots.

==== Relation usage ====

As opposed to categorization usage some categories are used for relation system. Lets say, that we have Organisation object '''ACME''' and Sale Order object '''SO-1'''. We can define a relation between '''SO-1''' and '''ACME''' using a '''source''' category. The sale system is implemented in such a way that the '''source''' category means that goods will be send from '''ACME'''.

Most popular relation categories are:
* source
* source_section
* destination
* destination_section
* parent

Using relations is described in detail here: http://wiki.erp5.org/HowToConfigureRelationField

=== Workflows ===

==== General introduction ====

[[Image:Example_publication_workflow.png]]

Workflows are one of the key concepts of ERP5. They are used everywhere, for everything. They are so important because a workflow represents a process - and everything that is done in a business is a process. A workflow can represent any process, e.g. editing and publishing an article, recruiting a person, receiving and processing a sale order, making an accounting entry etc.

* States and Transitions

When an object is managed by a workflow, it means that it is subject to a procedure which this workflow represents. A procedure consists of some '''states''' and '''transitions''' between the states, and can be nicely represented by a graph, where boxes represent states, and arrows represent transitions. The workflow has an '''initial state''', which the object assumes when it is created. If a transition is made, it changes its state to a destination state of the transition. Then another transition can be made, and so on until the object reaches a state from which there is no more transitions.

[[Image:Workflow_state.png]]

[[Image:Workflow_actions.png]]

ERP5 standard interface shows the object's workflow state in the main form, and available transitions in the &quot;Action&quot; dropdown.

* Security

An important thing a workflow does is managing access rights to an object. For example, an article which is in a &quot;draft&quot; state should be accessible only to its author (for read and write), while &quot;published&quot; article should be readable by everyone and writable by nobody. Access rights can be defined and set separately for every workflow state.

* Conditions

A transition can be made available only to users who have certain rights in the system - for example, you have to be a &quot;chief editor&quot; to be allowed to publish an article. If you are not, you won't see the &quot;Publish&quot; action in your action box. A transition can also depend or other object properties - an article can be submitted for publication only if it contains some text, or an accounting entry can be confirmed only if credit and debit are equal.

* Side effects

Workflow transitions can have &quot;side effects&quot; - actions to be executed when a transition is being made. Sticking to our publication workflow, when a document is being published, the system can send email notification to all subscribers. A more business-oriented example is that when a sale order is confirmed, the system generates a planned invoice.

* Interaction workflows

This is a different kind of a workflow - it has no states, and no transitions. Instead, it has &quot;interactions&quot;, which are triggered when a given action is being made on an object. Interaction workflows are basically a cleaner and more portable way of implementing side effects - if we want a notification send when a document is published, we can do it by tweaking publication workflow, but we can instead add an interaction workflow with a &quot;send notifications&quot; interaction hooked to the &quot;publish&quot; action of the publication workflow.

* Edit workflow

This is a special workflow, which is hooked to almost every object in ERP5. It is quite unusual because it has only one state - &quot;current&quot; - and one transition which goes back to the same state. This transition is executed every time an object is edited; the sole purpose of this workflow is recording the object's history.

==== How to implement ====

See http://wiki.erp5.org/HowToUseAndDefineWorkflows for detailed instruction and technical information.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Colour change associated with Ligand Exchange reactions:'''
When [[ligands]] are formed around a metal ion (e.g. [Fe(H2O)6]) it is known as a complex. The coordination number of a complex denotes how many ligands are attached to the central ion, it is usually 4 or 6. There are 3 types of shapes associated with complexes:

- Square Planar (coordination number, 4)

- Tetrahedral (coordination number, 4)

- Octahedral (coordination number, 6)

When complexes are formed the electrons delocalise within the molecule and this allows the complex to absorb certain frequencies of light. The frequency depends upon the type of central ion, the ligands and the shape of the complex. When the light is absorbed the electrons in the [[D-orbital]] split into 2 groups. This allows the light to be absorbed. If the frequency of the light absorbed is 450nm it means that red light is absorbed, if the red light is absorbed it means the blue light is reflected, and this is the colour seen to the human eye.

           array[i] = array[i-1];
           array[i-1] = tmp;
           --i;
           if(i == 0)
               i = 1;
       }

&lt;/source&gt;

         i = 1;
       }
     }
   }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

===C++ using bidirectional iterators===
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;algorithm&gt; // for std::iter_swap

template &lt;typename Iterator&gt;
void gnome_sort(Iterator begin, Iterator end)
{
    Iterator current = begin;
    Iterator before_current;

    while (current != end)
    {
        if (current == begin || *before_current &lt;= *current)
        {
            ++current;
        }
        else
        {
            std::iter_swap(before_current, current);
            --current;
        }
        before_current = current;
        --before_current;
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

===Optimized C++ using iterators===

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;algorithm&gt; // for std::iter_swap
#include &lt;iterator&gt; // for std::advance

template &lt;typename Iterator&gt;
void gnome_sort(Iterator begin, Iterator end)
{
    Iterator current = begin;
    Iterator before_current;
    size_t step = 1;

    while (current != end)
    {
        if (current == begin || *before_current &lt;= *current)
        {
            std::advance(current, step); // possible leap optimization
            step = 1;
        }
        else
        {
            std::iter_swap(before_current, current);
            --current;
            ++step;
        }
        before_current = current;
        --before_current;
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;
The optimized version makes the &quot;gnome&quot; (represented by the 'current' iterator here) leap back to the right i.e. to the place where it needed to swap the flower pots on its farthest reached position so far. This also avoids redundant comparisons. On average the optimization results in cutting the time by one/third on a modern x86 machine. (A wise gnome sort? :). However, the optimization works best if the iterators are random access iterators. Otherwise the algorithm works almost like the non-optimized version - it still avoids redundant comparisons though.

'''Tatarian Aster''' is a tall, upright perennial native to Asia but grown elsewhere in gardens. 

==Description==
The plant overall is coarse, with large leaves and thick stems. The flowers are borne in late autumn, with yellow disk florets and purple ray florets.

The species can grow up to 2.5m (8 ft) tall, but shorter cultivars are available.

==Growing conditions==
Does best in full sun. Plants tend to flop if grown in very rich soils. Hardy in USDA zones 3-8.

==Uses==
Generally grown as a &quot;back of the border&quot; plant, for its tall flowers in the fall. Excellent as a cut flower.

==Maintenance==
Cut back half-way in mid summer to encourage bushiness. The plant spreads aggressively, so will need to be reined in by digging out the outer crowns or dividing every two or three years.

The plant does not readily self-seed.

==Propagation==
Easily divided.

==Pests and diseases==
[[Image:Aster tataricus1.jpg|thumb|left|300px]]
Pest and disease issues are not common, though deer browsing can be a problem if deer populations are high. See [[../Aster/]] for discussion of pest and disease issues.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;h2&gt;Support for Segmentation Rules eXchange (SRX)&lt;/h2&gt;
Segmentation Rules eXchange (SRX) is an XML-based standard for description of the ways in which translation and other language-processing tools segment text for processing. It was created when it was realized that TMX leverage is lower than expected in certain instances due to differences in how tools segment text. SRX is intended to enhance the TMX standard so that translation memory (TM) data that is exchanged between applications can be used more effectively. Having the segmentation rules that were used when a TM was created will increase the leverage that can be achieved when deploying the TM data.

SRX version 1.0 was officially accepted as an OSCAR standard in April 2004.

Your best contact for low cost printing on Wikibooks is probably [[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] (See [[User_talk:Robert_Horning#Publishing.2C_etc| Publishing etc]].  Paperback prices are now surprisingly low, my company gets a 150 page manual with glossy cover printed for about £2.50 ($5) from a local printer if volumes are over 1000 copies.  It looks like a proper paperback, possibly better quality than most.  Have you thought of talking to a local printer and persuading him to do charitable printing for cost price?  I would guess that the cost price on our manuals is nearer $3 than $5.  You would need to supply the text &quot;print ready&quot; in Word or one of the Mac formats.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|What effects do inequities in school funding have on teaching and learning?}}

Before we can examine how school funding is inadequately disbursed amongst school districts we must first understand the complex nature of how schools receive there funding. When we break down the education system there is much more to learning than a teacher and a student. There is the money that budgeted for each program, teacher salaries, per student costs, field trips, and everything that a school operates on is designated and planned by the budget for that school. To break down the funding and budgetary system we must look at the influences from not only the federal level, but also the state and local levels, and how these funds contribute to our education system.

==School Funding==
To better understand the breakdown of school funding we must look at the three different governmental factors that contribute to raising the appropriate funds for the many school districts nationwide.
&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;25%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #c0c0c0; border: solid 1px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;“One current controversy stems much from the No Child Left Behind Act; this act gives the Department of Education the right to withhold funding if it believes the school, district, or even a state is not complying and is making no effort to comply.”&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

===Federal Level===
On a federal level, the government contributes roughly eight and a half percent of all funding that each district receives. This is broken down into grants and scholarships that the school qualifies for. Each School district can qualify for different grants depending on the nature of the funds that they are trying to receive. “Federal money under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act may be used to provide “assistive technology” for children with a variety of disabilities.” Each district is responsible for what grants, scholarships, and federal funds it qualifies for and receives. “The Department of Education may disperse awards, grants, and contracts to schools, school districts, researchers, and others to implement new methodologies, Research effective practice, implement educational reform, and provide the Department goods and services.”

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;25%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #c0c0c0; border: solid 1px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
“The Department of Education may disperse awards, grants, and contracts to schools, school districts, researchers, and others to implement new methodologies, Research effective practice, implement educational reform, and provide the Department goods and services.” .”&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

===State and Local Level===
The second part to school funding is more complex, because most of the funds for secondary and elementary education are from the State and local levels. According to a report published in 2005 by the National Center for Education Statistics there is splits between the state and local governments on average, 48.7 percent from the states and 42.8 from local sources contribute to the make up of school funding. There is still some margin of era, because this is an estimate and not every district follows this completely. When reviewing how funds are contributed to school districts on a state level we must look at the Education Reform that can vary state to state. Each state is responsible for budgeting a set amount for education; those funds are then disbursed evenly amongst the different school districts. This brings us to the local level of funding, because once funds are raised and disbursed it is up to the local districts for each school to decide how the money is divided. Other ways that schools can receive funding on the state and local level is property taxes. This is an ongoing debate amongst the various General Assemblies and the state senates because if the legislatures raise taxes to supplement the Education reform then this poses a strain on keeping local control while the state is increasing the states role in raising school funding. Another pit fall or down side to the tax issue is utilizing property tax, because if a particular district raises its property taxes to help with the funding for its particular school district, this in turn helps out the school, but poses a problem for those districts in low-income eras. Inner city schools would not raise as much additional funds by higher property tax, but if you raised say property taxes in New York City the school districts would potentially benefit due to the economic wealth in this particular era, so there are still so many questions and not enough answers on how to fix this problem.

==Disbursement==
===Districts===
Each School District is made up of a Board of Education, this committee is responsible for planning and budgeting of each school within that district. The Board of Education is responsible of making sure that each school receives the proper amount of funding to make sure that the school runs smoothly, without jeopardizing its educational need. In No Child Left Behind the Department of Education was given the right to withhold funding if it felt the state did not comply with its regulations, this controversial amendment affects not only the state and local government but each district as well. When planning the budget per fiscal year each district relies on the funds that they know are allotted to them, if by chance they do not follow the regulations outlined in No Child Left Behind, the federal government penalizes them by withholding the funds that were allotted to them. By doing so not only are the districts in jeopardy but also the schools themselves. When breaking down the budgetary sources of funding that are disbursed by district, we have to evaluate how the districts split there funds and base there budgets for each school. Most districts in the United States no matter where the schools are located allot the same amount equally when using the federal and state funds that it was allotted.

===Schools===
On the individual level of each school we can look at a wider area of disbursement, because funds are not evenly disbursed sometimes the school might have a budget for one thing and have to allot those particular funds to something else. A prime example of this is based on Teachers salaries, if the budget that was calculated say for the inner city school stated that the average salary for that school is $30,900 and the average per student cost is $450.00 if the budget only allotted for say a teacher salary of $29,000 then the money that was allotted for the per student cost or from other areas such as extra curricular activities or departments that might not need the funding. This thought process in turn only effects the Teachers and student, and the lasting result is an inadequate funding system.

==Effects==
After understanding the breakdown of how schools are funded and how the money disbursement can be skewed we must look at how this affects the teachers and students in those school districts. As we know there can be committees established to raise additional funds for schools, but depending on the geographical location of that particular school, the cards might be stacked against them on raising the money that they need. For example you might not get the peer or staff commitment in an inner city school to have a fund raiser to better there school, than say a school in New Your City or Orange County where there schools are in better neighborhoods, and the economic struggles that those students might face are not the same as an inner city student. 

===Teachers===
As teachers we are to mold the minds of young children who thrive to learn to the best of their ability while at the same time bettering themselves to develop the skill and mind set that will eventually lead them through life. Without the proper support from the community it makes it harder to help the next generation be the best of the best. With little funding allotted to books, supplies, technology, field trips, extra curricular activities it makes it harder for a teacher to teach there particular subject, an example would be you don’t want to teach a computer class with no computers. In today’s society there is a heightened push on the educator to make sure that the student is receiving the best education possible through the use of the tools that needed to adapt them to that way of thinking. With the federal government trying to push No Child Left Behind and to try to regulate what funds are allotted to states it makes it harder from the Teachers perspective to teach your class the way that you feel they should receive the information.

===Students===
Students can also be affected by the lack of funding allotted to a school or shall we say the disbursement of funds. Without the budget for computers, extra curricular activities, study program, adequately trained professionals, how is a student to learn. If a child wants to learn Math they need a math book. The lack of support from the federal government can hinder the experience that a child receives or even the guidance that is given to them in there classroom setting if the proper tools are not there to help them succeed. With Rising salary cost, gas prices, and other economic hardships that might impact the environment that the student is in makes it harder for that student to relate or understand the subject area that they might be taught.

== Conclusion ==
The Department of Education poses the right to withhold funding to schools that are not showing or complying with the rules and regulations of No Child Left Behind; but is this truly the answer. If a school district or even and individual school is not complying and the federal government withholds the 8% of funds that that schools district would have been allotted what does that prove. It penalizes those schools that were meeting the standards, jeopardizing the education of some for a few doesn’t seem worth it. We need to, as a nation, create ways to make the educational funding system better without jeopardizing those students that do what they need to. After much research there is still a need for some reform to better the educational funding system, so that all schools and school districts are on the same page, whether it is on a federal level to regulate the disbursement or to make sure that there are more grants established for low economic stricken areas that might not be able to prosper more through the community influences that other schools within the district might have to there advantage. There needs to be more rules and regulations on school funding so that as educators we can better provide for our pupils.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|What are various strategies that can be employed for meaningful learning?}}

When you walk into a classroom you encounter many students. It is essential to keep in mind that each of these students are unique, and have a distinctive learning style. There are three broad categories of learners: visual, auditory, and kinesthetic/tactile; all of these learners ascertain optimum knowledge in separate ways. Howard Gardner once said, “Children are best served by having opportunities to gain and demonstrate their understanding in a variety of ways.” Incorporating an assortment of teaching and learning strategies can have a noticeable affect on student engagement and achievement. When educators apply the use of varied teaching strategies, they are supporting a belief in individual learning styles and preferences, and they are more apt to engage students in the successful acquisition of knowledge.On the New Horizons for Learning website, Dee Dickinson points out the following, “Students who struggle in schools with curriculum and instruction based primarily on verbal proficiency, arts processes are extremely powerful” (1997). Teachers can use multiple strategies as a means of connecting with each group of students by teaching children through means of art, music, cooking, centers, and games.

== Art ==
{{Rquote|right|I do not want art for a few any more than education for a few, or freedom for a few.|William Morris}}

In Victoria Jacob's writing, Teaching Core Curriculum Content through the Arts, she states, “Arts in elementary schools have often been separated from the core curriculum and instead, offered as enrichment activities that are considered beneficial but not essential” (Jacobs, 1999, p. 2). The officials of the schools she refers to, in addition to other critics, pose the question, “Why should we have art in our schools?” One response to this question is that when the arts are well taught, they are able to engage the minds and hearts of young people by giving them the means to know and enjoy their world. The arts also help them to become literate in an increasingly visual world. 

Art encourages self-directed learning, and provides new challenges to students who are already considered successful. It shows improvement in discipline and academic achievement in students who may have had previous issues with traditional learning. The ability to create, interpret, and integrate visual messages is an essential component of literacy. Reports from the National Art Education Association (NAEA) showed that “Students in art study score higher on both their Verbal and Math SAT tests than those who are not enrolled in arts courses” (Guenter 2005). Art education helps children make sense of their world by providing them with motivational tools to reach a new level of understanding of their education, and make connections to the world of ideas. Integrating art into everyday learning gives students who are primarily visual and kinesthetic learners a better chance to learn, as well as giving every student the chance to learn more effectively. In this way, teaching art enables students to achieve their highest level of learning.

== Music ==
{{Rquote|right|Music is the electrical soil in which the spirit lives, thinks and invents.|Ludwig van Beethoven}}

Music is another essential component of the curriculum which, by many, is often over-looked and thought of as irrelevant to education. MENC 2002 shows that skills learned through the discipline of music are transferable to study skills, communication skills, and cognitive skills, which are useful in every part of any curriculum. Catchy tunes and phrases provide children with an easy way to recite and remember facts. For example, a kindergarten teacher at Greenbrier Primary School in Chesapeake, Virginia writes songs about the famous historical figures and the knowledge that kindergarteners are expected to know for the VA SOLs. She testifies that through her twenty-five years of teaching experience, her students are better able to retain the information that they had been taught when they put it in the form of a song. Not only does music make learning more fun, and facts easier to recall, but another significant feature of music is that it strengthens the right side of the brain. This is an important characteristic because studies have shown that the more parts of the brain that are used, the better the user’s synapses develop (Connell 2007). 

Several studies provide evidence that children who participate in music programs show improved spatial-temporal skills, enhanced academic performance, and better social skills (Prescott 2005). This is also true of just listening to music. Teachers know from the expressions on their students' faces that music promotes wonder and provides benefits far beyond what can be assessed by research. Students enjoy, gain nourishment, and build confidence through participation in music. A professor in the department of Psychobiology at the University of California, Irvine, Norman Weinberger, Ph.D., says that music “appears to really bring out the best in students, capitalizing on their natural curiosity and allowing it to flourish in a varied, stimulating environment” (Prescott 2005).

Integrating music into the everyday learning environment helps students improve themselves in many ways. The U.S. National Child Welfare Association states, &quot;Through music, a child enters a world of beauty, expresses his/her inmost self, tastes the joy of creating, widens his/her sympathies, develops the mind, soothes and refines the spirit, and adds grace to the body&quot; (Dickinson 1997).

== Cooking ==
{{Rquote|right|Cookery has become a noble art, a noble science.|Robert Burton}}

Although many restrictions have been placed on the allowance of food in the classroom, it is still permissible to cook with fresh, store bought ingredients and obtained office approval. Cooking can be incorporated into various lessons for each of the core subject areas. For example, produce can be sliced in a demonstration about fractions, or can also be used to study social studies and geography by investigating topics such as: where it originated, where it is grown now, who first ate it, and how. More involved cooking demonstrations give students the chance to explore the science of chemical changes as they see how foods differ when heated, frozen, or mixed (Giancoli 2007). The importance of following directions and doing things in a sequential order play a big role in cooking, and the value of organization is also demonstrated. Having students participate in cooking aids in the development of their fine motor coordination, and uses decision-making and problem-solving skills when something unexpected happens. Students also enhance their vocabulary while they are working in the classroom kitchen. They learn new units of measurement, as well as the names of foods, ingredients, and kitchen utensils. Lessons about basic nutrients, heat safety, and proper sanitation can also be linked into the curriculum (Giancoli 2007).

== Centers and Games ==
{{Rquote|right|Games have a far greater educational influence than most people are aware of.|Robert Coats}}

Group interaction has proven to be very useful for students of all ages. One form of group interaction for elementary students is obtained by working in centers. Centers offer motivation and flexibility to meet the diverse needs of today's students (Van Deusen-MacLeod 2000). Centers teach many valuable concepts, some of which are social aspects and others are more traditional educational values. Through centers, students are able to practice cooperation and learn to take turns. They are able to discuss with each other and develop more elaborate language. These opportunities for social collaboration allow student participation on a variety of levels and integrate success into each child’s experience (Van Deusen-MacLeod 2000). 

Children also gain the possibility of making choices about their learning. Some of the educational benefits of centers include the development of classification skills and number concepts, as well as problem-solving abilities. Additionally, students learn to make generalizations about the properties of various objects, organize and conceptualize the world, and follow a mental plan. They also further develop gross motor skills and hand-eye coordination. Another benefit of centers is that they provide a great opportunity for integrating technology into the classroom. 

While working in centers, students develop a positive self-concept as well as a positive attitude toward learning. The classroom structure provided allows teachers to assess students regularly while they are engaged in meaningful and purposeful activities. Teacher observation of center behaviors provides significant information regarding each student's level of independence, interdependence, and cooperative skills. (Van Deusen-MacLeod 2000).  Educational games also serve as a productive method for teaching students. Games can be used as a means of introducing material and gaining students’ interest, for more in-depth exploration of a subject, or as a review of content. Games sharpen students’ skills and encourage them to learn more, while making learning a fun experience. Popular game shows such as Jeopardy!, Who Wants to be a Millionaire?, and 1 vs. 100, serve as popular models for review games in the classroom and can be related to all subjects. Studies show that students who are involved in the learning process have more fun and better retain information than ones who are not.

== Conclusion ==
Exposing students to abstract learning by various forms of interaction will teach them logic and reasoning, and will help them to grasp what might not be represented on the surface. This is why teachers should use multiple strategies in order to produce meaningful learning results through use of art, music, cooking, centers, and games. The arts make a tremendous impact of the developmental growth of every child. Cooking can promote a better understanding of science and inforces the importance of following directions. Centers and games help children's social skills and also provide a fun method for discovery and learning. Each of these interactive, hands-on forms of educating encourages students to further engage themselves in the learning process, and helps them to retain greater knowledge. It is crucial that teachers use an assortment of instructional activities in order to entice all students and excite them about their education.

{{question-answer|question=Imagine that you are a second grade school teacher. Johnny Appleseed Day is coming up. Give an example of a lesson you could prepare which incorporates at least one of the multiple strategies for meaningful learning into your curriculum, and explain the importance of doing so.
|answer=There are many exciting ways for a second grade teacher to incorporate multiple learning strategies into the lesson in order to make it meaningful to the students. The first step that I’m going to take in my classroom will be to introduce the children to John Chapman, better known as “Johnny Appleseed” and share how he came to earn his nickname. Throughout the day, we will be making applesauce as a way of getting students involved and helping them to feel more connected to the lesson. As we are preparing the ingredients, I’ll familiarize students with the units of measurement that we use for cooking. I plan to do a short fractions lesson with the students while I’m carefully cutting the apples. Then children will be able to periodically watch as the applesauce cooks and they will write in a science journal about the changes that they observe. The applesauce takes a couple of hours to cook, so in the mean time, students will work in groups of three to create a short story about life with Johnny Appleseed. They will brainstorm about their story and then they will each write one page, trade their papers so that they are editing a new one, and then exchange papers again so that they can draw a picture; at this point everyone in the group should have a part in each of the three pages of the short story. Once the class completes the assignment, each group will present to the class. This group activity promotes collaboration, cooperation, and communication, so the students will be able to further develop their social skills. Toward the end of the day when the applesauce is ready, they will be able to enjoy their treat while participating in a class discussion to review what they’ve learned.}}

{{Rquote|right|These reforms express my deep belief in our public schools and their mission to build the mind and character of every child, from every background, in every part of America.|President George W. Bush|January 2001}}

According to Robert L. Linn, standards have played a prominent role in education during the past 50 years. In the 1950s, under the influence of James B. Conant, testing was used to select students for higher education and to identify students for gifted programs. In the 1960s, testing was used to measure the effectiveness of Title I and other federal programs. In the 1970s and early 1980s, state testing to measure basic skills was developed and became a graduation requirement in 34 states. This minimum competency testing continued into the late 1980s and early 1990s and was overlapped by a movement toward the use of standardized test results for accountability purposes (Linn,1).  

This use of standardized testing is still used in today's schools and has developed even greater emphasis with the passage of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001(NCLB). The NCLB Act is an education reform effort proposed by President George W. Bush passed into law by Congress on January 8, 2002. Two important areas of the NCLB Act directly affecting the role standards play in today's educational system include increased accountability for states, school districts, and schools and a greater choice for parents and students, particularly concerning which schools to attend. The role of education standards has became the primary tool for assessing implementation of these key principles of the act.

==A Closer Look at No Child Left Behind==
The role of standards is very evident in the assessment of the first principle of the NCLB Act: increased accountability for states, school districts, and schools. According to the Executive Summary of the NCLB Act, it is required that states implement an accountability system covering all public schools and students. These systems require state standards in reading and math and annual testing for students in grades 3-8. Schools failing to make yearly progress toward state goals will have to undergo corrective action to help them meet state standards. The bill prohibits any “national testing” or federally-controlled curricula. It is the responsibility of the states to design their own tests and to make sure their tests are aligned to their state curriculum standards. Federal funding is provided to states to develop their tests. The test results are required to be made public annually. The test results are divided and reported according to poverty, race, ethnicity, disability, and limited English proficiency. This process is known as “disaggregation of data” and is used to prevent the lumping of all students together to hide the achievement gaps within certain groups of students.

States had until the 2005-06 school year to develop and implement their tests. Schools and school districts are now required to show “adequate yearly progress” (A.Y.P.) toward demonstrating with their test scores that they are on course to reach 100 percent proficiency for all groups of students within 12 years. States decide what is acceptable for A.Y.P. Schools that fall behind may be subject to various “school improvement measures.” States will also have to compare their test results against an independent benchmark called the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), which will be given to a small sample of each state’s 4th and 8th grade students. The purpose of the NAEP is to insure that the state standards are not set too low (Executive,1). The role of standards are very important in insuring that states, school districts, and local schools are being held accountable for student performance.

Standards also play a very important role in deciding how Title I funds are spent. According to the Executive Summary, the NCLB act increases the choices available for parents and students. If a school is identified for improvement, corrective action, or restructuring, students must be given the opportunity to attend a better performing public school. The district must provide transportation to the school and use at least 5 percent of its Title I funds for this purpose. Schools that consistently fail to meet state standards for at least 3 of the 4 preceding years must use Title I funds to obtain supplemental services from the public or private sector. To help maintain standards, local educational agencies offer productive choices. NCLB requires districts to spend 20 percent of their Title I money to provide school choice and supplemental programs to eligible students. The school choice and supplemental program portion of NCLB provides incentives to poor performing schools to improve performance on state standards to prevent losing portions of their budgets (Executive,1-2).

Since the beginning of the NCLB act there has been some significant changes in the performance of students in America. Some of these high performances are: &quot;more progress had been made by nine-year-olds in the past five years than in the past 28 years combined, nine-year-olds have posted the best reading and math scores since the early seventies and thirteen-year-olds have posted the best math scores ever, math tests for African American and Hispanic 13-year-olds were at an all time high, and forty three states and D.C. either improved academically or held steady in all categories&quot; (wiki). However, even though there has been a change for the better in our nation's schools there is still backlash that NCLB is not the best act to help failing schools. Some people feel that there is not enough funding from the federal government, others feel that with the incentives set up and penalties given that test will be manipulated, and others feel that with standardized testing teachers will teach to take tests instead of learning for real world applications. However, NCLB has improved many schools and with the right administration and teachers it can help bridge the gap between top schools and Title I schools.

==Conclusion==
The role standards have played in education has always been a controversial one. Despite the 50-year history of standards in education, it is still not clear if they are a reliable source of indicating educational quality. The NCLB act has heightened this debate and has been highly criticized for its dependence on testing standards. According to K-8 principal and Vice-Chair of the Coalition of Essential Schools, Deborah Meier, “The current push for national and state-mandated standards is fundamentally misguided. It leads inevitably to standardization, which is the antithesis of real education. It will not help develop young minds, contribute to a robust democratic life, or aid the most vulnerable of our fellow citizens. By shifting the focus of authority to outside bodies, it undermines the capacity of schools to instruct by example in the qualities of mind that schools in a democracy should be fostering in kids—responsibility for one’s own ideas, tolerance for the ideas of others, and a capacity to negotiate differences. Standardization instead turns teachers and parents into the local instruments of externally imposed expert judgment. It thus decreases the chances of young people growing up in the midst of adults who are making hard decisions and exercising mature judgment in the face of disagreements. And it squeezes out those schools and educators with innovative ideas” (Meier,1).

Proponents of using standards in educational reform argue, however, that testing is a necessary way to maintain accountability. According to President George W. Bush, “How do you know if a child is learning if you don’t test?” (Marsha, 1).

Colleen Ruggieri, an English teacher-turned-consultant for the Ohio state department, believes that the current standards, while flawed, have motivated some critical changes. More than anything, she says, the emphasis on standards has pushed many teachers to do what they might never have done, collaborate: “While autonomy is a wonderful thing, it can be even greater when coupled with the gift of collaboration. Most high school teachers understand the feeling of isolation. Sadly, a career lacking in communication with colleagues can lead to burnout and loss of enthusiasm. With the evolution of the standards movement, I have watched teachers in my state strike up stimulating conversations with a sense of renewed enthusiasm” (Ruggieri 15).

Ruggieri also points out that the emphasis on standards has allowed teachers to focus less on the textbook for curriculum development. This, she says, frees teachers up to spend more time assessing what students know beforehand, and allows them to use their judgment more in deciding what to teach (Ruggieri 15-16).

Regardless of the controversy created by the use of standards in education, their role will continue to be an important one for all educators.

{{question-answer|question=Describe the two principles of the No Child Left Behind Act that have a direct impact on the role that standards play in education.
|answer=The No Child Left Behind Act is composed of two defining principles that directly correspond with the standards set in our current education system:  accountability of states, school districts, and schools and a greater choice of schools for parents and students.  The first principle of accountability has held students, teachers, and school systems more responsible for ensuring each grade level is learning age appropriate material.  Each state is responsible for creating their own state standards in reading and math for students in grades 3-8 and core content areas for high school students in grades 9-12.  Schools who fail to make yearly progress (AYP) must follow a corrective action plan in order to meet state standards.  Although this principle has met considerable ridicule, creating standards has allowed our schools to be sure they are meeting the basic needs of our students.  It is a teacher’s responsibility to push students past that standard to higher goals; the standard is nothing more than a bar for teachers and students to raise.  The second principle allows parents and students who are enrolled at a school that is identified as needing improvement to find a school that is better performing.  It is the responsibility of the school needing improvement to ensure that student gets to the better performing school.  This principle is yet another incentive for schools to meet the state standard.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|When should qualitative or quantitative assessments be used?}}
{{Rquote|right|Not everything that counts can be counted, and not everything that can be counted counts.|Albert Einstein}}

“Test day,” to most students, means studying, reviewing, and perhaps a bit of cramming to remember as much as possible. But to a teacher, a test gathers important information – does the student really get what I’ve been trying to teach him for the past few weeks?
Standardized tests, a big issue in modern education, are certainly not the only kind of test teachers use, and tests aren’t the only way teachers can assess what students have learned. But years before No Child Left Behind, educational researchers at the University of Utah predicted that American educators were going to be “increasingly required to provide evidence” that students are learning what they are supposed to learn. Consequently, teachers now and in the future will have to figure out how to measure whether students have learned the material or not – and just how much of it they’ve learned (Worthen, Borg, and White 1993). Out of this challenge have come many ways to study, classify, and apply different kinds of educational assessment.

==Quantitative Assessment==
Countless books and articles have been written on the subject of educational measurement, but one way in particular to classify methods of assessment is to categorize them as either quantitative or qualitative.

Quantitative assessment, as the name suggests, focuses on numbers, or quantities. Usually, something that is quantitative can be measured and expressed in units (Wikipedia 2007). For instance, a quantitative test might include multiple-choice questions or fill-in-the-blank questions – these types of questions can easily be classified as “right” or “wrong” and the results tallied to produce a grade. Each right or wrong answer is a unit, and the group of units makes a number that is supposed to show whether or not the student knows the material.

For example:
# Solve 5x + 4 = 24
# What is the name of the capital city of France? (Satterly 1984)

Quantitative tests, like multiple-choice or fill-in-the-blank, are often seen as merely encouraging rote memorization – and they often do. For instance, asking a student, “Which part of speech is used to describe a noun?” from a list of four choices does not necessarily require the student to fully understand adjectives and how to use them. On the other hand, well-constructed questions can measure learning on a variety of levels on Bloom’s Taxonomy, including application and synthesis, if they ask the student to do high-level thinking in order to come up with the best answer (Satterly 1989). A teacher might give the student a sentence and ask him to choose the word that functions as an adjective – giving him the opportunity to apply what he knows to a new situation (Bloom 1984?).

==Qualitative Assessment==
Qualitative assessment, on the other hand, is not based on numbers or units, but on observations that often can be subjective. Many kinds of essay questions (those asking for things like the student’s opinion on a controversial issue, an analysis of a situation, or a free-response interpretation of a literary work) are examples of qualitative assessments. Though essay tests are often graded on a scale of points, based on criteria, the teacher still has a lot of leeway in deciding what constitutes an acceptable response.

==Uses for both types in the classroom==
While either kind of assessment can be used for almost any set of material, in some cases a certain kind of test is especially useful. Some subjects seem to fit a certain kind of test more than others.

In math classes, for instance, quantitative assessments often come in handy to measure whether or not a student knows how to solve an equation. There is one correct answer to the problem, and each student’s answer either matches or doesn’t. Some teachers give points for each step completed correctly, while others simply mark the answer right or wrong, but each approach produces a quantitative, objective point amount that the student is awarded for that problem. An 80 on a math test shows that the student knew some of the material, or partially understood it, but didn’t know or understand all of it.

When testing students on English literature, however, qualitative methods of assessment sometimes work better – to test whether students are able to generate their own ideas about one of the novel’s themes, a teacher might give an essay test that asks students to analyze and discuss some aspect of the work at length. A student may earn an A because the teacher believes he has grasped the work at an appropriate level; or he may receive a lower grade if the teacher feels something important was missing. Even though points may be awarded for certain parts, no absolute standard applies in judging the overall quality of the essay.

==Gray Areas==
In his book Assessment in Schools, David Satterly discusses several major types of classroom assessment. For example, two major kinds are recall/completion and essay. There are many ways to construct each type of test, and a virtually limitless amount of questions that can be asked.

===Recall/Completion===
Recall/completion questions (like “In what city was the Declaration of Independence signed?”) and multiple-choice questions (like “Which number is the radius of the circle in the diagram?”) ask a student to remember a simple fact, and they are usually meant to be completely objective. There is only one “right” or “best” answer – for instance, “Philadelphia” or “4 inches.” This allows the teacher to page through a pile of tests, easily mark whether or not a student wrote the correct answer, and add that right or wrong mark to the tally of scores to produce a quantitative grade. However, few test questions can really remove teacher discretion from the grading process. The teacher may think there is a single “best” answer, but a question that asks where something occurred can, arguably, be answered to the specific city, state, country, or hemisphere. The Declaration of Independence was signed in Independence Hall, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and in North America; but specific questions – asking “what city” instead of “where” – can help make the answer more clear-cut (Satterly 1989).

===Essay===
More so than any other type of test, essay tests contain both qualitative and quantitative aspects in full array. Most essay questions require the student to connect ideas, apply concepts to new situations, and, in general, utilize more of the higher-level thinking skills at the top of the Bloom’s Taxonomy diagram. It is indeed difficult for a student to formulate a viable solution to a current political issue if he does not thoroughly understand the arguments on both sides. Of course, the more a question moves toward the qualitative realm – and away from simple rights and wrongs – the harder it is to grade, simply because there is no absolute standard of correctness for the teacher to measure it against.

Perhaps largely due to this workable balance between the qualitative and the quantitative, a well-constructed essay questions is considered by many an excellent way to assess whether a student has reached a “deep understanding” of the material, and is able to reorganize it and reapply it (Borich and Tombari 2004).

|answer=My subject, secondary English, deals more with qualitative assessment than many other subjects do. An English teacher probably devotes many of her tests to questions that ask students to take ideas from things they have read and apply creative thought to it. For instance, she probably includes essay questions, literary analyses, and oral/written interpretation. But English teachers also use quantitative assessments like multiple-choice and true-false. In my future classroom, I will probably try to use a mixture of qualitative and quantitative assessment: simple right/wrong questions to measure factual knowledge, whether students remember the parts of speech or all the characters’ names, and writing assignments to get students to interpret, create ideas, and think on a high cognitive level.  For instance, to test students on a novel they have just read, I might use a combination of 1) an oral class discussion of the novel’s ideas and themes, 2) simple recall quizzes covering plot, character, setting, etc., 3) a writing assignment asking students to create an interpretation of a passage from the novel, 4) some kind of creative project that takes an idea from the novel and builds on it visually.  Any combination of these ideas this would allow students to express their understanding in different ways and on different levels and help them really grasp what I’m trying to teach them.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|What are reward systems, and do they work?}} 

This is one of the many questions that teachers ask themselves when trying to design their own classroom.  Rewards are normally used as a type of motivational strategy designed to encourage students to complete a task efficiently.  However, with this notion comes a debate over two different types of rewards, intrinsic and extrinsic.  This article will take a look at both of these types of rewards and some of the issues that surround them.  In addition, guidelines in designing rewards will be discussed, and examples of common rewards will be given.   

==Reward Systems==
In order to apply a reward system to a classroom, a teacher must first understand what a reward system is and what the advantages and disadvantages are when using it.  The term reward is broadly defined as a tool that teachers use to try and reinforce a desired behavior (Witzel &amp; Mercer, 2003).  The elements that determine the effectiveness of a reward are how it is delivered by the teacher and how it is perceived by the student (Witzel &amp; Mercer).  If a teacher delivers a reward for good behavior, the student must make the connection between the right behavior and the reward.  If students think they were rewarded for a different behavior, then the given reward will not be effective, and the student will associate getting a reward with the wrong behavior (Witzel &amp; Mercer).  So, teachers need to make sure that when giving rewards, students understand why they received them.  

===Intrinsic Rewards===
Rewards can be broken down into two categories, intrinsic and extrinsic.  When a student receives an intrinsic reward, it is because they have completed an assignment or task due to internal motivation (Williams &amp; Stockdale, 2004).  Some common intrinsic rewards are “task completion, feedback or result, acquisition of knowledge or skills, and a sense of mastery” (Witzel &amp; Mercer).  In some cases, intrinsic rewards can be beneficial compared to extrinsic rewards, because they do not require an external stimulus, such as the teacher.  The student will stay on task because they are motivated by their own determination (Williams &amp; Stockdale).  However, intrinsic rewards will not always be satisfactory for students, since they may not have any internal motivation to complete a task.  If a student does not find sentence diagramming or multiplication tables satisfying, then they may never have the motivation to do them, in which case an extrinsic motivator or reward would be necessary to encourage them to complete the task.  This is where the advantages of extrinsic rewards are present.

Teachers or instructional assistants don't need to look far for ideas on motivating students in their classrooms. The Internet has many resources available that can aid teachers to aid their students. As stated previously, a student, at times, may have no motivation in a lesson; therefore, the intrinsic reward is meaningless. But, what about the students who just need a little push? One school in Canada created a page on their website solely dedicated to motivation and how to motivate students. On this site, http://members.shaw.ca/priscillatheroux/motivation.html, teachers can find 21 strategies, as well as other links, that can help enhance motivation.

===Extrinsic Rewards===
Extrinsic rewards are rewards given by someone outside of the individual, such as a teacher (Witzel &amp; Mercer).  Some common extrinsic rewards are “primary objects, tangible objects, token systems, social approval, and project activities” (Witzel &amp; Mercer).  In 1991, Newby found that new teachers use extrinsic rewards and motivation more than any other classroom strategy (Witzel &amp; Mercer).  Extrinsic rewards may motivate students to complete tasks that they would otherwise disregard.  However, extrinsic rewards can have a negative effect, where students grow dependent on them for motivation in completing their assignments (Williams &amp; Stockdale).  

In the classroom, most rewards will be a combination of extrinsic and intrinsic factors.  For instance, students may engage in an activity both because of what they will learn, and to earn a good grade (Williams &amp; Stockdale).  The information that they will learn will be the intrinsic reward, while the grade that they receive will be the extrinsic reward.

Once again, the world wide web is a wonderful tool for teachers. Just typing in the words &quot;extrinsic rewards&quot; returned over 400,000 hits on Google. Of course, many people don't search past the first 10 pages, and it is also likely that the other thousands of returns have nothing to do with what the teacher was originally searching for. One site from California State University's Department of Curriculum and Instruction Charter College of Education offers great feedback on extrinsic rewards. Extrinsic rewards are a slightly more delicate subject than intrinsic rewards. Extrinsic rewards have the possibility of getting out of hand. When extrinsic rewards get out of control the original purpose of the reward is gone and students will loose belief in any other future rewards. The website from Cal State, http://www.calstatela.edu/faculty/jshindl/cm/ExtrinsicRewards.htm, explains how to use &quot;extrinsic rewards more effectively and why to avoid them when you can.&quot; It also offers other possible solutions when extrinsic rewards hit a bump.

==Reward Guidelines==
So, what are some guidelines for new teachers in designing their own reward systems?  According to &lt;i&gt;The Savvy Teacher’s Guide:  Selected Ideas for Behavioral Intervention&lt;/i&gt;, there are three tests to determine if a reward will be effective.  

The first test is the “Acceptability Test.”  In this test, a teacher should answer the following questions, “Does the teacher approve of using the reinforcer [reward] with this child?  Are parent(s) likely to approve the use of the reinforcer with their child” (Wright)?  If the reward passes this test, then it should move on to the “Availability Test.”  

In the &quot;Availability Test,&quot; a teacher should ask, “Is the reinforcer typically available in a school setting?  If not, can it be obtained with little inconvenience and at a cost affordable to staff or parents” (Wright).  If the reward also passes this test, then it should move on to the final test, the “Motivation Test.”  

During the &quot;Motivation Test,&quot; teachers only have one question to answer, “Does the child find the reinforcer to be motivating” (Wright).  If a reward passes all three of these tests, it should be successful in the classroom in reinforcing positive behavior.  An alternative method for determining whether or not a reward is effective is one that was developed by Kohn in 1999.  Here Kohn suggests that “teachers need to (a) decide on the purpose of their activities, (b) put themselves in the shoes of the student, (c) determine if the reward drives the action, and (d) opt for more intrinsically motivating means over rewards” (Witzel &amp; Mercer).  Both of these reward tests are effective methods for determining whether or not a reward should be used.  

After determining if a single reward would be effective, then a teacher should start to develop a list of multiple rewards that can be used in the classroom.  One option for creating this list is using a technique known as a “Reward Deck.”  A “Reward Deck” is simply a stack of index cards with rewards that a teacher has approved of for their classroom.  Teachers can allow students to pick their own reward from this stack, making an individual reward list for each student in their class (Wright).  This technique will allow students to pick rewards that will motivate them to complete their work, which may help produce results that are more positive. 

==Classroom Rewards==

&lt;/table WIDTH=&quot;60%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;left&quot;&gt;

What exactly are some rewards that can be used in the classroom?  Some common rewards that teachers can consider are allowing students to, “be the line leader, pick a game at recess, take a homework pass, have the teacher make a positive phone call home, be the teacher’s helper for the day, sit at the teacher’s desk for the day, and use the teacher’s chair” (Bafile, 2003).  These are just a few of the many ideas for rewards that exist.  In order to encourage students to start taking responsibility for their own behavior, teachers often begin to increase the amount of work needed to earn a reward (Bafile, 2000).  This will help them see the link between doing their work, behaving, and getting good grades (Bafile, 2000).  Hopefully, students will carry the work ethics that they learn from reward systems with them as they progress through their education.  

==Rewards and Bullying==
There is no evidence to prove that  the use of praise and reward systems in a school will help reduce the level of bullying. However, most victims of bullying and some bullies suffer from low self-esteem (Mellor, 2000).  It is reasonable to assume that any system which helps young people feel better about themselves is likely to  help prevent bullying behavior.  Bullying is often a hidden activity so evidence can be difficult to gather (Mellor, 2000).  It may be difficult to determine if an incident is actually bullying, since there is a fine dividing line between unacceptable name-calling and social teasing.

==Problems With Rewards==
Studies over many years have found that behavior modification programs are rarely successful at producing lasting changes in attitudes or even behavior (Kohn, 1994). When the rewards stop, people usually return to the way they acted before the program began. A child promised a treat for learning or acting responsibly has been given every reason to stop doing so when there is no longer a reward to be gained. If the question is &quot;Do rewards motivate students?&quot;, the answer is, &quot;Absolutely: they motivate students to get rewards.&quot; Unfortunately, that sort of motivation often comes at the expense of interest in, and excellence at, whatever they are doing. At least ten studies have shown that people offered a reward generally choose the easiest possible task (Kohn, 1993). In the absence of rewards, by contrast, children are inclined to pick tasks that are just beyond their current level of ability.

Good values have to be grown from the inside out. Attempts to short-circuit this process by dangling rewards in front of children are at best ineffective, and at worst counterproductive (Kohn, 1994). Children are likely to become enthusiastic, lifelong learners as a result of being provided with an engaging curriculum; a safe, caring community in which to discover and create; and a significant degree of choice about what (and how and why) they are learning. Rewards become unnecessary when these things are present (Kohn, 1994).

==Culturally Sensitive Rewards==
Rewards and their value vary from culture to culture.  According to the U.S. Department of Education, 1/5 of our students come from language minority households.  Of that 20 percent, 10 to 15 percent is of an Asian descent.  Additionally, it is proven that language minority students have a higher drop out rate and take fewer courses.  Therefore, it is essential that the rewards that are used on native English speakers are not counterproductive to the Non-native speakers.  

Most Asian cultures do not value nor appreciate being singled out for a job well done.  They prefer to remain autonomous and part of the group.  If a Japanese student, for example, performs very well on a class assignment, presenting their work to the class or commenting on how well they did may not be received with the enthusiasm that a student from Mexico would. Of course this depends upon the student and their length of time in the classroom.  However, there are certain cultural norms that a teacher needs to be aware of before distributing their rewards.   The significance of rewards in the classroom is great; however, all students' needs and values need to be taken into consideration before those rewards are given.  Especially concerning different cultures and customs.  

==Issues==
Schools have identified several issues which need to be addressed if praise and reward systems are to be effective: (Mellor, 2000)
* The need for consistency among teachers in their use of sanctions and awards.
* Regular monitoring of how the system is working, looking at patterns of positive and negative referrals, investigating variation amongst departments or stages and taking steps to ensure consistency.
* Avoiding rewards which have monetary value or which signal that school work is not valued. (ex. being allowed to arrive late or being excused from homework)
* Ensuring that praise is genuine and deserved and not routine and meaningless.
* Keeping the system fresh and meaningful.

{{question-answer|question=Is student dependence on extrinsic rewards (tangible rewards from the teacher) a bad thing?
|answer=In my opinion, student dependence on extrinsic rewards is a bad thing.  Rewards do in fact motivate students.  They just fall short at achieving the motivation they were set out to accomplish.  Teachers use rewards in with the belief that it alter a student’s behavior.  When students are presented with something that they perceive to be valuable, they will do almost anything to obtain it. The problem rests in the fact that students who perform a task or exhibit a desired behavior only to get an extrinsic reward from a teacher often revert back to their original task and/or behavior once the reward is removed.  Extrinsic motivators do not alter the underlying behavior attached to why students under perform. Tangible rewards are little more than bribes aimed at controlling a students behavior.  Students are not taught the value of learning but rather how to imitate what someone else wants in order to get what they want.

In order to truly have an impact, we as teachers must find methods of increasing intrinsic value with our students.  We must help them to develop a passion for learning and to see each opportunity for learning as a step closer to achieving their own dreams. That way the behavior they portray is owned by them and not just an effort to get something. Therein lies the underlying issue, many students have no dreams so therefore their direction is confused.  The greatest reward that we can give to our students is a vision for life and then empower them to obtain it.
----
Giving rewards to children is a tricky art to master. Offering the reward before the task is done motivates the child, however, the child will most likely do only what was asked of them. This can be crippling because the child does what is asked and nothing more or different. The child can also become dependent on recieving awards and will only perform if a reward is offered. However, giving rewards is still necessary. After giving an assignment, if a particular child exceeds their own expectations or standards giving a random reward is very beneficial. Work that exceeds the average should always be acknowledged. Random rewards encourages students to always put forth all their efforts, not only for the chance of receiving and award or verbal acknowledgment but also for the great feeling that accompanies the hard work. 

Varying the style of rewards is also key in making sure children do not expect rewards for everything. Giving verbal acknowledgment is a wonderful form of rewarding a child. It creates a feeling of success and encourages superb performance. Other small rewards such as candy, privileges, etc. also motivates children; however, rewarding every single task average or above average minimizes the specialness of a reward. Loosing the specialness also reduces the child's motivation to constantly strive for better. &amp;mdash;Brittney O'Bryan
----
I do not think student dependence on extrinsic rewards is necessarily a bad thing.  At the elementary school level, every teacher uses some sort of reward to motivate students.  I have been substituting for the past seven months, and I have never come across a classroom that does not rely on some kind of extrinsic reward, whether it is candy, extra recess, a homework pass, or lunch bunch.  Rewards are used everyday, throughout the day for the whole entire school year.  It would be nice if every student would be intrinsically motivated, and find appreciation for knowledge alone, but that is not the case.  At the elementary level, students are children and they need a reward to get them motivated. 

Too many rewards, though, can get out of hand.  Teachers should not want their students to only want to learn in order to get something out of it.  If rewards are given moderately, then the student will not expect when a reward is given.  This will allow them to appreciate the reward more, and feel grateful when something like extra recess is given.  Rewards definitely serve a purpose in motivating students, but to prevent dependence, they should not be given out excessively. &amp;mdash;Adriana Krajcirovic
----
In my opinion, an extrinsic reward does not necessarily have to be a negative thing but, I do believe that we as educators should take caution when using this type of reward system in the classroom.  Most teachers use rewards such as grades and extra credit points for motivating students, these extra points can come from attendance, participation, and doing extra work.  When using this type of reward system the teacher might see a change in the student just for that task or just as long as the rewards last.  Using extrinsic rewards for a short period of time can be effective but ineffective for long periods of time.  As educators we must decide when will be the best time to use this type of reward and for what type of task or assignment, this way students will not expect the reward for ever assignment or behavior.   We do not want our students to learn with the impression that they will be rewarded for every assignment they are given throughout their educational endeavors.  This will only create a negative learning environment and overall a negative outcome.  The actually bottom line is that students should be motivated through intrinsic motivation. &amp;mdash;Chrysti Compton}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|How should parents be held accountable?}}

The National Public Radio conducted a telephone survey in 1999, which randomly interviewed 1,422 adults nationwide.  When the parents of school age children were asked: How often do you help your children do homework assignments — nearly every day, once or twice a week, or less often than that?  The answers in percentages were 59%, 27%, and 13% respectively.  When the parents of school-age children were asked: How often do you meet with your children's teachers —once a month, a few times a year, or only rarely? The answers in percentages were 35%, 50% and 12% respectively.  When half the sample of parents and non-parents were given a list of problems schools might face and asked to tell if it were a major problem, a minor problem or not a problem at all for the public schools in your community, 55% indicated that lack of parental involvement was a major problem in their public schools.  As you can see from this survey, the lack of parental involvement in children’s education is a problem for our nation.  In this article, I will present several things parents should do before their child enters school, what they should do at home and how they should be involved at their child’s school.  

==Preparation for School==
Parents should begin preparing their child for school as soon as the child is born.  Children go through many different levels of physical, emotional, social and intellectual development from the time they are born until they begin school.  [http://http://childdevelopmentinfo.com/development/devsequence.shtml Child Development Info] contains a chart that shows the various stages of development a child passes through from ages 2-5.  A parent is very important at each of these developments to ensure the child develops normally.  Parents should spend time everyday reading to their child and making reading fun and exciting.  Children need time to explore and develop their language skills.  Parents can do this by reading to the child and asking the child to repeat phrases, as well as teaching the child the alphabet and numbers (Child Development Institute, 2007).  It is also the parents’ responsibility to start socializing their child with other children at an early age.  This teaches children to get along with others, as a well as key concept such as sharing, learning to listen and take turns.  Parents should allow their children to explore their creative personalities by providing adequate time to paint, draw, scribble and color.  These artistic activities help children develop and express their personalities, as well as increasing their imaginations (U.S. Department of Education, 2005).  These are all things parents should work with and teach their child before the child starts kindergarten.  If the parents do not have enough time to work with their child developing his or her skills, then there are many preschool classes available at little or no cost.  

==Core Values to Success==
There are several core values a parent should teach their child at home other than learning academic and language skills.  One of the first things a parent should begin, even as the child is still an infant, is to get the child used to a schedule.  The child should have structured days with specific times for eating, playing, and napping.  As the child nears school age, the parents should try to structure the days similar to what the child will experience in school.  This will allow the child to be used to routines and the classroom will not come as such a shock to them.  It is also the parents’ responsibility to monitor what the child eats, the amount of sleep received, and what is watched on television or seen on the internet (Bippus, 2005).  Children need a proper balance of healthy foods and an adequate amount of sleep to properly function.  This will make learning much easier for the child during school so the child is not sleepy, hungry or lacking energy.  Children should also be assigned chores appropriate to their age level.  A preschooler is definitely old enough to help set the table for dinner, place the toys back in the toy box, and helping sorting the laundry.  This teaches children responsibility, how to follow directions and it improves their physical coordination (U.S. Department of Education, 2005).  One of the most important things parents can teach their children is discipline.  Parents should teach their children right from wrong and that their actions have consequences.  Children need to be punished fittingly for their misbehavior and they should be able to easily identify right from wrong before they enter school.

'''Homework Hints for Parents'''
* Assume that your children will have studying to do every night.
* Ask your children if they understand their homework. If they do not, work a few examples together.
* Ask your children to show you their homework after the teacher returns it, to learn where they're having trouble and where they're doing well. See if your children did the work correctly.
* Stay in touch with your children's teachers. Ask about their classes and what they are studying. Ask their teachers how you can support what they are studying (flash cards, spelling, etc.).
* Remember, you and their teachers want the same thing — to help your children learn.
* Don't be afraid to get in touch with the teacher if you and your child don't understand an assignment or if your child is having a great deal of trouble. Almost all parents run into these problems, and teachers are glad to help.
* Don't do your children's work for them. Help them learn how to do it themselves.
* Show your children that you think homework is important. If you are at work during homework time, ask to see their work when you get home.
* Praise your children for doing well. Make praise a habit.
* Maintain a portfolio of &quot;best pieces.&quot;
* Ask your school about tips or guides for helping your children develop good study habits.
* Help older students organize their assignments by recording them on calendars or planners, along with due dates, dates turned in, etc. [http://http://www.nea.org/parents/homework.html National Education Association]
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

==Parental Involvement at Home==
As important as it is for parents to be involved with their children at home, it is “Research has shown time and time again that family involvement in a child’s education leads to increased test scores, higher graduation rates, and more opportunities for higher education” (pbs.org, 2007).  This statement should be enough to encourage all parents to be actively involved with their child’s education.  Parents have to continue to monitor their child’s habits, especially on the content and amount of television watched and websites on the internet viewed.  These forms of entertainment can have a huge influence on your child’s life, so it is important the content is age appropriate.  Another thing to monitor, especially as your child gets older, is attendance.  Sometimes it is hard for schools to keep check on every student so it is easy for a student to skip out of his classes.  This is also a core value parents must instill in their children: the importance of being on time and attending classes.  The most important thing a parent needs to help their child with at home is homework.  The National Education Association says that teachers use homework to help students understand and retain the work covered from the day’s lessons, to see if the students understood what was covered in class, and to help students discover where to find and how to use additional information.  It is important for parents to help their children with homework to make sure they understand the material and they do their homework so they are prepared for the next day’s lesson.  

==Parental Involvement at School==
As important as it is for parents to be involved with their children at home, it is equally important that the parents stay involved at their children’s school and with their teachers.  One of the most significant things a parent should do is stay in constant contact with their child’s teachers.  This includes attending parent-teacher conferences, as well as regular phone calls or notes to ask about your child’s progress.  So often, parents think the only time they need to communicate with a teacher is if something is wrong, but a parent needs to stay informed of all progress.  Another key way to stay involved is for a parent to volunteer.  This way a parent knows things that are going on behind the scenes and can possibly better assess the situation at the school.  Volunteers can see first hand if a teacher is relaying the appropriate amount of content to the students; so if this is not the case, then parents know they need to spend extra time with their children at home.  Parents should also vote in school board elections and become a promoter for better education in the community or state (NEA, 2007).

==Conclusion==
Parents should be held accountable when it comes to certain aspects of their children’s education.  Parents have responsibilities to prepare their child for school, teach their child core values, and have a steady involvement at home and at school with their child’s education.  Parents have to nurture and guide their child’s physical, emotional, social and intellectual development before the child enters school.  Parents have to teach their child core values that will lead to success, such as discipline, healthy eating and sleeping habits, and how to follow a routine.  The most important thing for a parent to do at home is to help their child with homework in making sure the homework is completed and the child understands the homework.  Parents should have a open line of communication with their child’s teacher and spend as much time as possible at the child’s school by volunteering.  These are just some examples of how a parent can remain involved in their child’s education so they can help their child achieve success.

{{question-answer|question=In what ways are parents accountable for their elementary child’s education?
|answer=Parents are accountable for their elementary child’s education in many ways.  This is the most crucial time in a child’s life when he needs to master important skills such as reading, writing, forming letters correctly, and counting.  Most of learning is somehow based on these foundational skills.  Parents should begin working with their child before he starts kindergarten.  Reading to the child every day and asking him to repeat phrases will help the child with identifying sounds and letters.  During the time before the child starts school, it is also important to teach the child discipline.  The child should know to respect the teacher and the difference between right and wrong when it enters school.  The child should be familiar with routine and know there are set times when to play and have fun and other times when he needs to stop and pay attention.  This will avoid the child having problems in school if he were not used to a structured environment.  It is important for parents to stay involved with their child’s school so they will be aware of any problems or conflicts that are going on.  They need to talk with their child’s teacher regularly to receive updates on projects and progress.  One of the main things parents needs to do at home is to help their child with homework.  This does not mean give the child the answers, but make sure the homework is completed with the correct answers.  Also, make sure the child understands the questions and knows why the answers are the right ones.}}

Students look up to teachers as purveyors of knowledge.  They often accept their teachers’ words as facts, and will quote them as such for years to come.  I cannot count the number of times I have heard full grown adults say, “Well my professor said….”   This act puts a tremendous amount of responsibility on the educators.  They are the primary source of information to the students, so they must ensure the information is as accurate and unbiased as possible.  This feat is not possible with a four-year undergraduate degree alone.  Continued education for the teacher is essential to offer students the best education possible.  This should include workshops, consulting other faculty, reading recent textbooks and journals, and most importantly, learning from their pupils.

==Continued Professional Development==
{{Rquote|right|Teacher effectiveness is not forever fixed. Through [professional] development, teachers can build their effectiveness over time.&lt;ref&gt;Katie Haycock.  March 1999.  Good Teachers Matter... A lot.  ''Results'' http://www.nsdc.org/library/publications/results/res3-99haycock.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;
|Katie Haycock, the directior of the Education Trust}}

The Virginia Department of Education requires school faculty to participate in continued professional development.  These regulations provide many options for completion, including taking college courses, attending conferences and workshops, and observing the classrooms of fellow faculty.  This program is designed to “improve and increase teachers’ knowledge of the academic subjects the teachers teach, and enable teachers to become highly qualified.”&lt;ref&gt;Commonwealth of Virginia Department of Education.  April 2004.  High-Quality Professional Development Criteria.  http://www.pen.k12.va.us/VDOE/nclb/HQPDcriteria4-04.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the course material is constantly changing, this ensures faculty members stay up to date on the most recent developments in their field.

The requirements also designed to assist teachers in finding the best methods for educating their diverse classrooms.  Teachers are given the opportunity to witness many different teaching styles.  They are also provided with feedback from another trained professional on their own teaching method.  Over time they will be able to better develop their lesson plans in a manner that best provides for the advancement of all of their students.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Sandra Leaton Gray.  April 2005.  An Enquiry Into Continuing Professional Development for Teachers.  http://www.esmeefairbairn.org.uk/docs/Education-Rep.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Peer Assistance Beyond the Requirements==
{{Rquote|right|As a first-year teacher, I was mentored by the experienced teachers on my team without any of us realizing it.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Spark.  It All Comes Down to the Teacher.  ''Journal of Staff Development'', Fall 2000 (Vol. 21, No. 4). http://www.nsdc.org/library/publications/jsd/dozier214.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;|Terry Dozier, the senior adviser to former U.S. Secretary of Education Richard Riley and the 1985 National Teacher of the Year}}

Faculty should not consult each other only when the state mandates they do so.  Another article in this wikibook has mentioned the buddy program and mentoring.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Social_and_Cultural_Foundations_of_American_Education/Edition_3/6.3&lt;/ref&gt;  A comparison to the open professional conversations shared by lawyers and doctors has also been mentioned.  There is no reason that educators cannot have this same open environment, with or without mentoring or buddy programs.  Whenever a question arises with either the material or the method to teach it, another faculty member should be consulted.  An inadequate buddy or mentor assignment is no excuse to improperly educate the students.  There are plenty of other faculty members at the school, and if no one is willing to assist, the principal is always an option.

==Educational Resources==
{{Rquote|right|A smart student with Google is better than the best teacher from 100 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick O'Shea.  Skype classroom interview September 11, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;|Patrick O’Shea, project director of HARP}}

College professors have offices filled with textbooks.  When students ask questions that stump them, they often consult not only the textbook for that class, but dozens of other materials until they reach an answer.  These college professors are sent these textbooks by the publishers to persuade them to use these books in their classrooms.  This leaves k-12 educators at a distinct disadvantage, since textbooks are chosen by the school district and shared by students for many years.  This makes it unlikely for publishers to provide k-12 teachers with free books.
K-12 educators are still required to teach much of the same information, and must find some method to gather their own library.  The subject being taught is one they chose, so supplying some of their own materials is not much to ask.  The easiest method is saving their books from their own education.  These books can also be pooled with those of other faculty, and the administration can be campaigned to provide extra books for the faculty.

When these hard copy resources fall short, a plethora of scholarly resources are available over the internet.  These can actually be preferable to hardcopy resources because students will have just as much access as the teacher.  Extrinsic motivating techniques like extra credit can be offered to encourage students to obtain the information on their own.

==Learning From Students==
[[Image:BogdanovBelsky_UstnySchet.jpg|thumb|right|330px|]]
This is the most vital and most ignored method of teacher development.  Articles and books addressing this subject are in short supply.  A Google search for “teachers learning from students” results in only 797 links, compared with 34,400 links for “teachers as learners.”  This is a sad reality, because the students are a terrific resource available to the teacher.  Few teachers would claim to be experts their first year in the job, but most would claim significant improvement by their fourth year.  What is the difference between the first and fourth year?  Three years of experience, teaching students, and learning what teaching methods work best in the classroom.  

Many undergraduate educational courses mention the idea of learning from students, but this lesson seems quickly forgotten once in front of a classroom.  Even when mentioned, it is typically in reference to the technical prowess of today's youth.  There is no reason to limit learning from students to just teaching methods and technology.  Often students will ask follow up questions and inquire specifics that the teacher may not know.  There may not be time for answering all of these questions, but the “it is beyond the scope of this class” answer should still be avoided.  Instead the teacher may offer to look it up, or have him or her stay after class to help look it up.  With the new internet age, it can even be assigned as homework for all students to find out.

Admitting to students that even the teacher does not know everything is advantageous.  Giving them an opportunity to educate the teacher and the rest of the class is estimable.  It will provide the students with new found confidence.  It will inspire creativity and free thinking.  A new more open and active classroom will be born, and both student and teacher will benefit.

==Conclusion==
Albert Einstein, Johann Sebastian Bach, and Benjamin Franklin all had teachers.  Each one of these men proved to be more brilliant than any of those who taught them.  For this reason every educator must realize his or her fallibility, and not enter the classroom as the almighty teacher.  If we choose only to give the students the knowledge we already possess, then we choose to stifle the education of the children in our classroom.

We must, instead, guide them on their educational journey, often sitting and learning with them.  If students are allowed to speak freely, we may find they have ideas and solutions to problems that we have never considered.  This is why we should discourage the “purveyor of knowledge” title students so often grant their teachers.  Learning should be a process of problem solving and independent thinking, not regurgitation.

In the end we must recall what attracted us to teaching in the first place; a passion for learning.  This love and desire of knowledge makes the requirement of professional continued education seem more like a job perk than an obligation.  We have all chosen a career that not only encourages us to continue learning, but actually provides us with countless opportunities to do just that, what we love most.

{{question-answer|question=Think back throughout your history as a student.  How did your truly inspirational teachers manage their classroom?  How did they choose to continue their education?  Was this teaching method as effective for the other students in the classroom?  As an educator, what will you do to ensure you are effective?
|answer=Enthusiast instructors whose students know exactly what is expected or them, who exhibit consistency, and discipline in a positive manner, staying away from negative reinforcement are truly inspirational teachers. These teachers treat their students with respect by showing them that they can be responsible and they are needed in the classroom.  This helps the student feel  it is their classroom as well.  Educators who cultivate a welcoming  and inviting environment and take into consideration individual needs, personality, talents ,and weaknesses and get to know their students outside of the classroom are most effective in their profession.

These truly inspirational teachers chose to continue their education by attending conferences on classroom management, curriculum development, and technology integration.  Effective teachers also continue education by taking college courses to keep up with current methods of classroom management, technology, curriculum, etc.  Teacher education can also be continued by subscribing to journals for educators and peer mentoring and coaching with fellow educators.

This was effective for other students because these teachers were well rounded and engaging.  Teachers who are welcoming, understanding, enthusiastic, intuitive, and make learning fun are always the most inspirational and effective. Teachers who genuinely like children and are interested in the way a child learns and develops are the most effective.

As an educator, I hope to be able to deal with each student on an individual basis.  I plan to use as many methods of continuing education as possible and use innovative teaching methods.  I also think it is important to keep in mind what I enjoyed about school and past teachers who left a lasting impression on me. &amp;mdash;Mara Workman

My favorite teachers effectively held open discussion classrooms.  The class was expected to read the materials before the class period, and then we would talk about it the next day.  In U.S. Government, we would discuss the structure and policies of the government.  After we would debate the merit of different proposals offered by politicians, and compare the American system with that of other nations.  In Chemistry we’d often be given different reactants, and thumb through on our own to find what product would be made.  

Both teachers typically acted as participants in the discussion, only taking on the roll of a moderator when the discussion ran off topic or the class got stuck.  Both were often forced to, “go to the books” themselves.  The government teacher was politically active, and kept up on current events.  The chemistry teacher was active in the American Chemical Society and often brought in stories about new chemical advances and compounds available in the private sector.  

It was obvious both liked their jobs.  The class seemed to enjoy it too.  The Advanced Placement exam scores showed that it also managed to be effective.  Not all students passed, but the scores were much higher than those of any other AP classes in the school.

I would like to have an open discussion classroom as well.  I enjoyed it, and felt everyone in the classroom experienced a more active and constructive environment.  It tested and affirmed everyone’s knowledge, and led to better understanding of the material.  The challenge will be to motivate my students.  This type of classroom requires a proactive and interested class, and it will be my responsibility to create an atmosphere that allows for this.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|What can be done about the issue of bullying?}}

Bullying is defined in the literature as a repeated behavior that occurs over time in a relationships characterized by an imbalance of strength and power(Owens). With this imbalance of strength and power, it is difficult for the person being bullied to defend himself or herself. Bullying has become a major issue with today's growing society. It not only affects the child but it also cause issues within the home. The question however is, what might make someone turn into a bully or who becomes bullied? And what can parents and teachers do to help stop bulling before it gets to far.

== Who Becomes a Bully? ==
Studies have shown that those who become bullied have no same background. Anyone who may have a weakness in themselves tend to become a bully. They may come from a broken home, or they have have bad grades with a problems of alcohol,or even maybe they are the popular kid that earns good grades but they bully because they want to maintain their popularity.Some kids bully as a reaction to the punishing lessons they learn at home at the hands of their parents.Some bullying is almost cultural in nature, in the sense that it is a kind of tradition in the school.For example, hazing that exists in many boarding schools or maybe the &quot; traditional&quot; bullying of freshman by older students.
To understand the cause of bullying in a better light, two British researchers Peter Stephenson and David smith subdivided bullies into three different categories; dominating bullies, anxious bullies, and bully-victims.

; Dominating and Anxious: The dominating and anxious bullies seem to come from homes where the sibling interaction is more dominate then the child=parent relationships. These homes are where the child has the habit of telling their sibling what to do without any parent saying anything can trigger the role of bulling.
; Bully-Victims: &quot;About half of the bullies report to be victims as well.&quot;(Veenstra)  Bully-victims are those children who have been victims themselves, either by their own peers, or even parents. They are also children who come from a home where they are rarely supervised, the discipline is inconsistent, and there is lack of love from mom and dad. The bully-victims are known as to be a bigger danger because they have more potential to use a weapon or join a gain because the angry that they may have is to high for them to think logical.  Bully/victims demonstrate high levels of aggression and depression.  They also have poor self esteem, social acceptance, self-control, and academics.  Many are involved in alcohol abuse.  &quot;Bully/victims are among the most disliked members of a classroom.&quot; (Veenstra)
; Males Vs. Females: Males outnumber females at a ratio five to four. Male bullies have a more dominate behavioral problem in class,and are unable to concentrate. Females on the other hand tend to be more talkative and rude.  Bullying by boys is more aggressive than girls.  Boys tend to do more hitting and threatening than girls.  Girls tend to call each other names and/or kick someone out of their group by ignoring them.  Some girls will steal from other girls as a form of bullying.  

However, girl bullies are becoming frequently more common.  Throughout the 1990's bullying by girls has become increasingly more violent , although many girl bullies still resort to rumors, and socially outcasting other students.  &quot;Bullying tends to occur between girls (primarily girl on girl) with different levels of power, based on physical attributes, personality, social status, or academic skills. As it is with boys, girl bullying seems to be a display of relative strength versus weakness.&quot; (Prothrow-Stith and Spivak).  The movie &quot;Mean Girls&quot; is a prime example of the destructive nature of bullying.  

== Who Becomes a Victim? ==
So who becomes a victim of bullying? Most of use image those who are bullied as boys that are small with big glasses or girls who may not be up to the trends of today's society, or they may be of another race or culture. Stephenson and Smith yet again did another study on who gets bullied and found out that it goes deeper then gender, appearance or race.. These victims where classified into two groups, provocative victims and passive victims.

; Provocative Victims: Provocative victims seem to draw bullying responses to them through repeatedly pestering baiting, insulting, invading, an another child's personal space.(Sheas 52) This occurrence is brought about because they have yet to understand the correct social behavior.
; Passive Victims: Passive Victims are those who are shy or afraid. They have a weakness or they may seem to be weak in relationship with the bully. Passive victims may be smaller or are in a lower social standard and they are not willing to fight back.

== Signs That a Child May Be Being Bullied ==
;At School

Children who may be bullied may display one or more of the following signs: 1)They have been teased in a hateful manner, 2)they are made fun of and laughed at in a derisive and unfriendly way. 3) They are involved in fights where they are defenseless from which they try to with draw, 4) they have their books, money or other belongings taken, damaged or scattered around, and 5) they have bruises, injuries, cuts or torn clothing that cannot be given a natural explanation.(Olweus 54)

;At Home

Children who may be bullied may display one or more of the following signs:
1) They come home from school with torn or disordered clothing, with damaged books, 2) They have bruises, cuts, and stratches, 3) choose an &quot;illogical&quot; route for going to and from school, 4)appear unhappy, sad, depressed, or show unexpected mood shifts with irritability and sudden outbursts of temper, and 5) request or steal extra money from family so they can accommodate to the bullies. (Olweus 57)

== What Can Schools Do? ==
All members of a school community, young and/or old, have a responsibility to help people who are being harass by bullies and to speak out against bullying behavior.  There are many cooperative ways that schools can help with the issue of bullying and peer pressure.  These ideas help formulate where the issue is starting and how to resolve from it.  Such ideas are: 1.)  Carry out a survey which would show where bullying is happening and how many people are involved.  2.)  Set up a “bully box” for people that are too scared to talk about bullying.  Everything that is written and put in the box has to be true for it to work.  3.)  Becoming a “buddy” of a younger student by getting to know them so that they become comfortable talking to the older buddy if bullying is happening.  4.)  Have “Prevent Bullying Day.”  This will help inform the students on what bullying is and how to prevent it.   5.)  Put on a special play skit so the students know what it feels like to be bullied and what to do to stop it.  Last but not least, arrange Peer Support Groups where older students volunteer to talk to younger students about bullying and friendship.  
Schools around the world have started intervention programs to help educate those who would want to know more information about this on going issue. These interventions have been known to reduce both direct and indirect bully incidents, they have a more positive attitude toward social relationships, academic work and the school itself, and also had no increase in bullying in other away from school.

== What Can Parents Do? ==
The home plays the most important role because it helps form strong patterns of social interactions. Teaching children the core values can also help prevent bullying. Within the age of five a child should know that cruelty is unacceptable. If the child knows this then it is shown they that they are less likely to become a bully. Another way of to help your child to not become a bully is to show them how to handle pets and animals with care. This gives them and idea of compassion and empathy. But the most important thing is to give the child love. This helps them know that they are cared for and they will develop to become strong.

Dr. Prothrow-Stith suggests ways for parents to address and help to counter act bullying by girls.  She uses the acronym &quot;ART&quot; to describe the ways parents can prevent their daughters from becoming bullies.  

A: Act as a Role Model: By demonstrating appropriate ways to handle anger and handle self esteem issues can prevent girls from expressing their own personal anger and esteem issues on others.

R: Reach out to others: She also suggests that parents take an active role in getting to know the parents of their daughters friends.  &quot;Within the network of parents, share information in a way that allows you to understand the peer group's dynamics and prevent or respond effectively to any bullying.&quot; 

T: Talk and Listen- The key to knowing whats going on in a child's life is communication.  She suggests that parents ask regularly about problems that their daughter may be having in school (Prothrow-Stith and Spivak).

==Statistics and Figures on Bullying==
Several studies and surveys have been conducted with parents and students of various school districts and the results show just how much bullying there really is. Some of the statistics and facts are as follows:

* Studies have shown that 15-25% of US students are regularly bullied while 15-20% report that they bully others frequently. 
* After talking with 3rd-8th graders in several Massachusetts schools, it showed that more than half of the students that were normally bullied said that it had been going on for six months or longer
* Physical and verbal bullying still increases during the elementary years, and typically peaks in middle school, while verbal abuse seems to be ongoing.
* An estimated 160,000 US students miss school each day because they are intimidated by their peers and are scared of being attacked.

Just knowing some of the statistics about bullying is enough for any parent to realize they should always be a part of their child’s lives and always want to know what’s going on. Some students will go through bullying every day but be too scared to tell their parents but the clues are always there and bullying will never go away. 

== Conclusion ==
Bullying is serious and should not be ignored. The affects can last a life time and without the help of parents and teachers the end result could be dangerous. Interventions not only helps the bullies and victims but can also help those who may be headed in a dangerous path. With the right guidance an motivation bullying could become no more and children would not have to worry about the mental and physical abuse anymore. From my experience of being bullied as a child and teen I can say that it was the worst experience I could ever go through. I had my moments when I was weak and thought I could not go on. Then I thought to myself they would win if I had done something dramatic, and I never wanted them to see that. So instead of dwelling of the fact that I was being bullied, I looked to the positive side of that I had friends that loved me and that's all that mattered. Fortunately for me, all those who bullied from middle school to my first couple years of high school either moved, or I never saw them again because I was taken higher honor classes when they were not. Being bullied is a awful thing to go through and I wish on those who do bully stop and think about what you are doing. What if you had a little sister or brother who was bullied and you saw the tears and pain they go through. More then likely it would break your heart, not only because it hurts your family but you can witness first hand what affects it has on the victims. From being bullied I have become a stronger person, who speaks up for herself more and is not afraid of telling it like it is. In some ways being bullied as a child help me become the adult that I am now. So thank you to all those who made fun of me in the past. You have helped me become the person I am today.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|How should foreign languages be taught?}}
{{Rquote|right|A nation, like a person, has a mind…that must be kept informed and alert, that must know itself, that understands the hopes and needs of its neighbors-all the other nations that live within the narrowing circle of the world.|Franklin Roosevelt|[http://iew.state.gov/promotional.htm]}}

“I had two years of German in High School, but I don’t remember any of it”.  This is one of the statements I hear often from people, after I tell them that I teach German.  Growing up in Germany, it was common for people to speak fluently at least one other language.  The motivation to learn another language is mainly the close proximity to other European countries and the cultural influence through immigrants from all over the world.  Foremost, foreign languages are taught already in elementary school. 
American schools encounter many constraints when it comes to maintaining an effective foreign language program.  The motivation for instituting foreign language programs and learning a variety of languages are influenced by events throughout history, mainly World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Iraq wars, and the terrorism attack of 9/11.  In addition, the US government has set goals to improve global competitiveness in the world's markets by improving our foreign language education in the United States and our national security, especially after 9/11.

==Accomplishments==
===History===
Shrum and Glisan point out that in recent years foreign language education has made significant changes especially for &quot;language teachers in terms of standards for teacher candidates, beginning teachers, and more accomplished teachers. An interest in standards in the academic disciplines was sparked by an initiative of the George H. W. Bush administration and was continued under the Goals 2000 initiative of the Clinton Administration.  '''''Visionary Goals 2000 (1994)''''' described the competence that all students should demonstrate in challenging subject matter….including foreign languages.  With its inclusion in Goals 2000 foreign language was recognized as part of the K-12 core curriculum in the United States” which eventually resulted in the ''''' Standards for Foreign Language Learning in the 21st Century'''''.&quot;  (Shrum and Glisan, 44)

===Setting National Goals===
&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;60%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFF7F7;
border: solid 1px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;

'''''The NSLI has three broad goals:''''' 

*Expand the number of Americans mastering critical need languages and start at a younger age 

*Increase the number of advanced-level speakers of foreign languages, with an emphasis on critical needs languages

*Increase the number of foreign language teachers and the resources for them
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
According to these goals set by President Bush, the National Security Language Initiative (NSLI) will dramatically increase the number of Americans learning critical need foreign languages such as Arabic, Chinese, Russian, Hindi, Farsi, and others through new and expanded programs from kindergarten through university and into the workforce. An essential component of U.S. national security in the post-9/11 world is the ability to engage foreign governments and peoples, especially in critical regions, to encourage reform, promote understanding, convey respect for other cultures and provide an opportunity to learn more about our country and its citizens. To do this, we must be able to communicate in other languages, a challenge for which we are unprepared.  According to U.S. Secretary of Education Rod Paige, to the extent that foreign language learning improves a student’s cognitive and academic performance, it goes hand in glove with the ''No Child Left Behind'' goal of ensuring high student outcomes for all children… Foreign language should not be seen as an “add-on” but rather, foreign languages should be integrated into the curriculum. [http://www.pen.k12.va.us/VDOE/Instruction/Language/AbbotPaigeinterview.pdf]

===In Virginia===
Many studies confirm the benefits and effects of learning foreign languages, specifically on learning them '''''early''''' in the child’s development.

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;60%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFF7F7;
border: solid 1px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
'''Learning a second language at an early age...'''

*Has a positive effect on intellectual growth.
*Enriches and enhances a child's mental development.
*Leaves students with more flexibility in thinking, greater sensitivity to language, and a better ear for listening.
*Improves a child's understanding of his or her native language.
*Gives a child the ability to communicate with people he or she would otherwise not have had the chance to know.
*Opens the door to other cultures and helps the child understand and appreciate people from other countries.
*Gives the child a head start in language requirements for college.
*Increases job opportunities in many careers in which knowing another language is a real asset. [http://www.cal.org]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

'''''More on Language Instruction Models at''''' [[w:Language immersion|Language immersion]]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

Selected Virginia schools offer a variety of foreign language programs which are based on the most recent foreign language teaching methods.
For example, the Stafford County School Division offers two types of elementary school foreign language instruction. 

'''FLEX (Foreign Language Exploratory) program'''. Every elementary school offers an after-school language program.  While the majority of schools offer Spanish, some schools also offer French, German, Japanese or American Sign Language.   

'''FLES (Foreign Language in the Elementary School--Sequential study). ''' [http://www.pen.k12.va.us/Div/Stafford/Instruction/ForeignLanguage/shoesbrochure.html]

'''Partial immersion program''': a means of acquiring a foreign language through content matter instruction. The uniqueness of an immersion program is that the foreign language is not taught as a subject.  In Fairfax County Public Schools (FCPS), students learn mathematics, science, and health through the medium of a foreign language (French, German, Japanese or Spanish). Half the school day is spent learning in the foreign language.

'''Two-way immersion programs''' integrate language minority and language majority students, providing instruction in both English and the native language of the language minority students. [http://www.fcps.edu/DIS/OHSICS/forlang/partial.htm]

==A Long Way to Go== 
===Are we there yet?===
No.  Although foreign language instruction has made great strides in offering different models of instruction and approved assessment, we still need to develop higher proficiency goals to offer better teacher training, to improve K-12 articulation, and to offer more of a variety of languages. [http://www.govtilr.org/ILRPPTFinal2%5b1%5d.23.06_files/frame.htm]

The U.S. lacks the language resources (in languages other than English) to meet its various goals and many members of our society do not experience the benefits that proficiency in multiple languages and cultures can bring.  
Students enter U.S. schools with native-like proficiency in a language other than English (their heritage language) and are not encouraged to develop high levels of proficiency in their native language while also mastering English. [http://www.govtilr.org/ILRPPTFinal2%5b1%5d.23.06_files/frame.htm]

==Major problems==
===Lack of variety of Languages and Exposure===
More than 200 million children in China are studying English, a compulsory subject for all Chinese primary school students. By comparison, only about 24,000 of approximately 54 million elementary and secondary school children in the United States are studying Chinese. 
According to the Center for Applied Linguistics, only 44% of American high school students are enrolled in foreign language classes... Of those students, 69% are enrolled in Spanish and 18% in French. 
Less than 1% of American high school students combined study Arabic, Chinese, Farsi, Japanese, Korean, Russian or Urdu.
Less than 8% of United States undergraduates take foreign language courses, and less than 2% study abroad in any given year. Foreign language degrees account for only 1% of undergraduate degrees conferred in the United States. [http://www.ed.gov/news/pressreleases/2006/01/01052006.html]

===Unqualified Teachers===
Reagan and Osborn point out that it is somewhat puzzling to imagine a language being taught by someone who does not speak it well-and yet in all too many cases, that is in fact the case. &quot;Clearly one must know a subject in order to teach it effectively. In the context of foreign language education, this means that the foreign language teacher should have achieved a high degree of competence in the target language.&quot;(Reagan and Osborn, 19)

==What can be done?==
According to the Center of Applied Linguistics, the U.S. lags behind the rest of the world in foreign language instruction and speaking abilities.  
What can the U.S. learn from other countries? 

'''''Start language education early'''''. 

The United States needs a national commitment to elementary school language teaching for all children...
In particular, we need to look to countries like ours that have a single official or national language but that are nonetheless succeeding in developing citizens with bilingual or multilingual proficiency.

'''''Conduct long-term research.''''' 

The U.S. education system can benefit greatly from the development of a long-term research agenda that incorporates longitudinal studies of a variety of early language learning models of instruction. 

'''''Provide stronger leadership.''''' 

A stronger and more coherent government-wide effort is needed to create the atmosphere and opportunity to improve language education in the United States. 

'''''Identify how technology can improve language instruction.''''' 

We need specific research on how technology can best be used to increase students' proficiency in other languages. 

'''''Improve teacher education.'''''
 
The United States needs to conduct a more in-depth investigation into how some countries are recruiting high-caliber students into teaching and providing top quality in-service and pre-service training.
Develop appropriate language assessments. The effective assessment practices used in other countries are worth studying given the salience of assessment in U. S. education.

'''''Designate foreign language as a core subject.''''' 

In districts and schools in the United States where foreign language study is part of the core curriculum, there is a more rigorous approach to curriculum development, professional development, and assessment. Designating foreign language study as a core subject is essential for a successful program. 

'''''Take advantage of the sociolinguistic context.''''''

American educators need to take advantage of the sociolinguistic context in which we live by promoting the learning of languages spoken by indigenous groups and by immigrants and refugees in this country, as well as by our neighbors in Canada and Mexico. [http://www.cal.org/resources/digest/0106pufahl.html]

==Conclusion==
According to the Center of Applied Linguistics, compared to students in much of the world, U.S. students lag far behind in their foreign language capabilities….The United States can learn a great deal by studying these successes and using the information to implement practices and policies that will support the development of better foreign language education and a higher level of foreign language proficiency among our citizens. 

Deficits in foreign language learning and teaching negatively affect our national security, diplomacy, law enforcement, intelligence communities and cultural understanding. It prevents us from effectively communicating in foreign media environments, hurts counter-terrorism efforts, and hamstrings our capacity to work with people and governments in post-conflict zones and to promote mutual understanding. Our business competitiveness is hampered in making effective contacts and adding new markets overseas.  ''Fact Sheet Office of the Spokesman, Washington, DC, January 5, 2006 National Security Language Initiative''

==Essay Question==
Click to reveal a sample response.
{{question-answer|question=President Bush has proposed to accomplish his Foreign Language goals of greater global competitiveness and national security by increasing funding for study abroad, elementary language programs, teacher training etc. Where do you think governmental funding could make the most impact? Why? How?
|answer=Government funding would make the most impact in teacher training. If all teachers were trained in at least one more language and the cultures of several countries, it could benefit all students in the U.S. It is best to start already during the teacher training program and expand the training to accomplished teachers. Most teachers are confronted every day with issues of multiculturalism within their own class room. Therefore, I would think it would be necessary to train all teachers on how to deal with students from different countries. 
It should be mandatory for foreign language teachers to study abroad in order to get fully immersed into the culture. 

I discovered that some school systems hire unqualified teachers because they lack the resources to interview the candidate in the foreign language they teach, especially when it comes to languages which are not represented across the school system.  I have encountered German language teachers who teach five high school levels of German for years and can not hold a normal conversation in German.  Furthermore, one teacher had not visited a German-speaking country in 20 years. 

Teachers of Foreign Languages need constant training and opportunities to attend workshops or exchanges in foreign countries, where they can compare teaching strategies with teachers from other countries.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">===1.1 Basic Grammar===

1.1.1 Tenses

isiZulu has the same grammatical structure as English: subject, verb and object (SVO).  But this order changes in to SOV when 'prepositions' are used in a similar way to French.  Before explaining the tenses in Zulu, we need to introduce a few concepts.  The first of these concepts is the adjunct.  An adjunct is a sentence element that establishes the circumstances in which the action or state expressed by the verb take place.  For example in the sentence, &quot;'''Today''', I went shopping '''at the mall'''&quot;, all the words in bold are the adjuncts.  Those words tell where and when &quot;I went shopping&quot;.  In English, different subjects do not change the subsequent verb, except when moving from  singular to plural.  This is not the case in Zulu.  The governing noun of a sentence must always be indicated.  This is done with a system of concords/prefixes that show this reference.

1.1.1.1 The Present tense

Instead of pronouns and articles, isiZulu uses a system of concordial prefixes. 
A simple indicative positive statement in the present tense without an adjunct takes the general form of:

NP-NS SP-ya-VS-a

where:

NP = Noun Prefix
NS = Noun Stem
SP = Subjectival Prefix
VS = Verb Stem

An simple example is:

Umuntu uyahamba.    &quot;The person is walking.&quot;

Broken up into its parts according to the above mentioned pattern, this becomes:

Umu-ntu u-ya-hamb-a

1.1.1.2 The Future Tense

A simple indicative positive statement in the future tense without an adjunct takes the general form of:

NP-NS SP-zo-(ku)-NS-a

If the noun stem consists of only one syllable, then the &quot;ku&quot; prefix is included. Using the same example as before:

Umuntu uzohamba.      &quot;The person will walk(go).&quot; (Note: &quot;hamba&quot; means &quot;go&quot; as well as &quot;walk&quot;.

Broken up into its parts this becomes:

Umu-ntu u-zo-hamb-a

1.1.1.3 The Immediate Past Tense

A simple indicative positive statement in the past tense without an adjunct takes the general form of:

NP-NS SP-NS-ile

For example:

Umuntu uhambile.      &quot;The person went.&quot;

Broken up:

Umu-ntu u-hamb-ile

===1.2. Summary of Tenses===

The below table provides a summary of the tenses of the indicative in Zulu all in first person.

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt; '''um-''' replaces '''umu-''' before monosyllabic stems, eg. '''&lt;u&gt;umu&lt;/u&gt;ntu''' (man).

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt; '''aba-''' and '''imi-''' replace '''ab-''' and '''im-''' respectively before stems beginning in a vowel, eg. '''&lt;u&gt;ab&lt;/u&gt;ongameli''' (president).

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt; '''abe-''' occurs only in rare cases, eg. in '''abeSuthu''' (the Sotho) or '''abeLungu''' (the Whites, the Europeans).

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt; '''ame-''' occurs only in one instance, namely '''amehlo''' (eyes) the plural of '''iso''' (eye; originally: '''ihlo''').

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt; '''isi-''' and '''izi-''' replace '''is-''' and '''iz-''' respectively before stems beginning with a vowel, eg. '''&lt;u&gt;is&lt;/u&gt;andla/&lt;u&gt;iz&lt;/u&gt;andla''' (hand/hands).

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt; The placeholder '''N''' in the prefixes '''iN-''' and '''iziN-''' for '''m''', '''n''' or no letter at all, i.e. in classes 9 and 10 there are three different prefixes, though only one per noun stem. Examples:

 iN- = i-:  '''i'''mali (money)
 iN- = im-: '''im'''pela (truth)
 iN- = in-: '''in'''hlanzi (fish)

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt; Rare, see above.

===1.4 Subject prefixes ===

In Zulu, a subject prefix corresponds to the subjective case of English personal pronouns, such as ''I'' or ''he''. Unlike personal pronouns, however, Zulu subject prefix cannot stand alone, but must be attached to a verb. Zulu does possess a set of independent personal pronouns; however, these are only used to emphasise the subject to whom they refer. 

An example with the subject prefix '''si-''' and the personal pronoun '''thina''' (both meaning '''we'''):

{|
|'''Si'''hamba manje.
|'''We''' are going now.
|-
|'''Thina''' '''si'''hamba manje.
|'''''We''''' are going now.
|}

There is a unique subject prefix for each grammatical person and each noun class.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{Displaytitle|title=Comparing Objects}}
{{Java Programming/Navigation|previous=Collection Classes|next=Exceptions}}
{{Java Programming/CollectionsTopic/Nav}}
__NOTOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;
In Java, we can distinguish two kinds of equality. 
* Object reference equality : when two object references point to the same object.
* Object value equality : when two separate objects happen to have the same values/state.

== Comparing for reference equality ==
The &lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt; operator can be used to check if two object references point to the same object.

'''Listing 1.1: Reference equality.'''
{{Java|code=if (objRef1 == objRef2) {
    // The two object references point to the same object
}
}}
== Comparing for value equality ==
To be able to compare two Java objects of the same class the &lt;code&gt;{{java:boolean}} equals({{java:Object}} obj)&lt;/code&gt; method must be overriden and implemented by the class.

The implementor decides which values must be equal to consider two objects to be equal. For example in the below class, the &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;address&lt;/code&gt; must be equal but not the &lt;code&gt;description&lt;/code&gt;.

'''Listing 1.2: Method overriding.'''
{{Java|code=public class Customer {
    private String name;
    private String address;
    private String description;
    // ...
    public boolean equals(Object obj) {
        // if the two objects are equal in reference, they are equal
        if (this == obj) {
            return true;
        } else if (obj == null) {
            return false;
        } else if (obj instanceof Customer) {
            Customer cust = (Customer) obj;
            if ((cust.getName() == null &amp;&amp; name == null) ¦¦ 
                (cust.getName().equals(name) &amp;&amp; ((cust.getAddress() == null &amp;&amp; address == null)
                ¦¦ cust.getAddress().equals(address))) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }

}
}}
After the &lt;code&gt;equals()&lt;/code&gt; method is overriden, two objects from the same class can be compared like this:

'''Listing 1.3: Method usage.'''
{{Java|code=
Customer cust1 = new Customer();
Customer cust2 = new Customer();
//...
if (cust1.equals(cust2)) {
    // Two Customers are equal, by name and address
}
}}

Note that equal objects '''must''' have equal hash codes. Therefore, when overriding the &lt;code&gt;equals&lt;/code&gt; method, you must also override the &lt;code&gt;hashCode&lt;/code&gt; method. Failure to do so violates the general conract for the &lt;code&gt;hashCode&lt;/code&gt; method, and any classes that use the hash code, such as &lt;code&gt;HashMap&lt;/code&gt; will not function properly.

== Sorting/Ordering ==
To be able to sort objects from the same class, the class must implement the &lt;code&gt;Comparable&lt;/code&gt; interface. This imposes a total ordering on the objects of each class that implements it. This ordering is referred to as the class's natural ordering, and the class's compareTo method is referred to as its natural comparison method.

Since Java 5.0, the &lt;code&gt;Comparable&lt;/code&gt; interface is generic; that means when you implement it, you can specify what your class can be compared to. Usually, this is the same as your class.

'''Listing 1.4: Comparable class.'''
{{Java|code=
public class Customer implements Comparable&lt;Customer&gt; {
    private String name;
    private String address;
    private String description;
    // ...
    public int compareTo(Customer cust) {
        return (name + address).compareTo(cust.getName() + cust.getAddress());
    }

}
}}
In the above code the &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; class also implements the &lt;code&gt;Comparable&lt;String&gt;&lt;/code&gt; interface, so the &lt;code&gt;compareTo()&lt;/code&gt; method can be used to compare &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;address&lt;/code&gt;.

; {{java:int}} compareTo(T o) : Compares this object with the specified object for order. Returns a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer as this object is less than, equal to, or greater than the specified object.

Lists (and arrays) of objects that implement this interface can be sorted automatically by Collections.sort (and Arrays.sort). Objects that implement this interface can be used as keys in a sorted map or elements in a sorted set, without the need to specify a comparator.

The natural ordering for a class C is said to be consistent with equals if and only if &lt;code&gt;e1.compareTo((Object) e2) == 0&lt;/code&gt; has the same boolean value as &lt;code&gt;e1.equals((Object) e2)&lt;/code&gt; for every e1 and e2 of class C. Note that null is not an instance of any class, and &lt;code&gt;e.compareTo(null)&lt;/code&gt; should throw a NullPointerException even though &lt;code&gt;e.equals(null)&lt;/code&gt; returns false.

It is strongly recommended (though not required) that natural orderings be consistent with equals. This is so because sorted sets (and sorted maps) without explicit comparators behave &quot;strangely&quot; when they are used with elements (or keys) whose natural ordering is inconsistent with equals. In particular, such a sorted set (or sorted map) violates the general contract for set (or map), which is defined in terms of the equals method.

== Change Sorting/Ordering ==
Sometimes we may want to change the ordering of a collection of objects from the same class. We may want to order descending or ascending order. We may want to sort by &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; or by &lt;code&gt;address&lt;/code&gt;.

We need to create a class for each way of ordering. It has to implement the &lt;code&gt;Comparator&lt;/code&gt; interface.

Since Java 5.0, the &lt;code&gt;Comparator&lt;/code&gt; interface is generic; that means when you implement it, you can specify what type of objects your comparator can compare.

'''Listing 1.5: Comparator class.'''
{{Java|code=
public class CustomerComparator implements Comparator&lt;Customer&gt; {
    public int compare(Customer cust1, Customer cust2) {
        return cust1.getName().compareTo(cust2.getName());
    }
}
}}
The above class then can be associated with a SortedSet or other collections that support sorting.

'''Listing 1.6: Comparator usage.'''
{{Java|code=
Collection&lt;Customer&gt; orderedCustomers = new TreeSet&lt;Customer&gt;(new CustomerComparator());
}}
Using the Iterator the &lt;code&gt;orderedCustomers&lt;/code&gt; collection can be iterated in order of sorted by &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt;.

A List can be sorted by the &lt;code&gt;Collections&lt;/code&gt;' &lt;code&gt;sort&lt;/code&gt; method.

'''Listing 1.7: Customized comparison.'''
{{Java|code=
import java.util.Collections
//...
Collections.sort(custList, new CustomerComparator());
}}
Sorts the specified list according to the order induced by the specified comparator. All elements in the list must be mutually comparable using the specified comparator.

An array of objects can alsobe sorted with the help of a &lt;code&gt;Comparator&lt;/code&gt;.

'''Listing 1.8: Array sorting.'''
{{Java|code=
import java.util.Arrays;
//...
Arrays.sort(cust[], new CustomerComparator());
}}

Sorts the specified array of &lt;code&gt;Customer&lt;/code&gt; objects (the cust[] array) according to the order induced by the specified comparator. All elements in the array must be mutually comparable by the specified comparator.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Beer|Beer recipes]]

'''Oatmeal Stout Brownies''' This recipe, created by Joe Stutler, was a national finalist in the 2006 Cooking With Beer Challenge. The malt and oats in the beer enhance the flavor of the chocolate in these delicious brownies. Not overly cakey, not overly fudgey, the texture is nicely balanced. They're also decadently chocolate, and surprisingly light (thanks to the eggs). Great with a fruity beer, such as a lambic (Framboise, yum!).

==Ingredients==
* 1 cup all-purpose [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* ¾ cup unsweetened [[Cookbook:Cocoa|cocoa]] powder (Dutch-processed preferred)
* ¼ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 6 tablespoons unsalted room temperature [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]], cut into cubes
* 8 ounces dark bittersweet [[Cookbook:Chocolate|chocolate]], chopped
* ¾ cup white [[Cookbook:Chocolate|chocolate]] chips
* 5 large [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]], at room temperature (1 egg is for the topping)
* 1 cup [[Cookbook:Granulated sugar|granulated sugar]]
* 1¼ cups (10 ounces) oatmeal stout [[Cookbook:Beer|beer]](room temperature)
* 1 cup semi-sweet [[Cookbook:Chocolate|chocolate]] chips

* 1 package (8 ounces) [[Cookbook:Cream Cheese|cream cheese]], softened 
* ⅓ cup [[Cookbook:Granulated sugar|granulated sugar]]
* ½ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla]]

==Procedure==

# Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).
# Line a 9 x 13-inch baking pan with non-stick foil (or grease and flour - or parchment paper; your call).
# In a medium bowl, [[cookbook:whisk|whisk]] together flour, cocoa powder, and salt until evenly combined. Set aside.
#Melt butter, bittersweet chocolate, and white chocolate chips in a [[Cookbook:Double Boiler|double boiler]] over very low heat, stirring constantly until melted. Remove from heat.
#In a large [[Cookbook:Mixing Bowl|mixing bowl]], [[cookbook:beat|beat]] 4 of the eggs with the sugar on high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add melted chocolate mixture, beating until combined.
#Beat reserved flour mixture into melted chocolate mixture. Whisk in stout beer. The batter will seem a bit thin. Drop semisweet chocolate chips evenly on top of batter (some will sink in).
#Pour into prepared baking pan. 
#Beat cream cheese in medium bowl with [[Cookbook:Mixer|electric mixer]] on medium speed until smooth. Gradually beat in sugar. Beat in vanilla and the remaining egg just until blended.
#Pour cream cheese mixture over brownie batter in pan; cut through mixture with knife several times for marbled design.
#[[cookbook:Baking|Bake]] 25 to 35 minutes on center rack in the oven, until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out almost clean.
#Let brownies cool, uncovered, to room temperature. Dust with [[cookbook:confectioners' sugar|confectioners' sugar]] before serving if desired.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*Makes 18 (cut ~ 2x3 inch) to 24 (cut ~ 2x2 inch) if cut to dessert size. For finger-food/snack portions you could halve the above dimensions to get 36-48 brownies.
* Plating suggestion: swirl a raspberry lambic reduction sauce (12 oz lambic [reduced to half], 4-6 oz seedless raspberry purée, 2-4 oz turbinado sugar, ½-1 teaspoon corn starch) on the plate, garnish with mint leaves, raspberries, lemon zest.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Enterprises vary in size from tiny (2 people, &lt;$100,000 annual revenue) to gigantic (&gt;one hundred thousand people, &gt;$100B annual revenue).  In North America, 99% of enterprises have less than 50 people and less than $5M annual revenue.  With regard to ERP packages, one size does '''NOT''' fit all.  The bigger the enterprise, the more complex and comprehensive the ERP must be.  A large enterprise's ERP requires more functions and the functions must be more comprehensive.  On the other hand, the ERP ideally suited to a $1B enterprise is massive overkill for a $1M enterprise.  The generic ERP described in this document is a medium-sized ERP with accompanying notes about the changes for larger and smaller enterprises.

== Overview ==

The '''''Conjunctivitus curse''''' apparently causes temporary blindness.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] is required to get past a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dragon|Dragon]] in the First Task of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Triwizard Tournament|Triwizard Tournament]]. Dragonhide is nearly impervious to most spells – it takes several wizards working in concert to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Stupefy|Stun]] a dragon, for instance – so in order to disable a dragon single-handed, you must attack its only vulnerable area - its eyes. The Conjunctivitus curse is the one you use to do that.

We are told about this spell, but we do not see it actually executed, so we do not know the incantation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Numbers / ''Numeri''==
Italian mostly shares its way to identify numbers with the great majority of Romance languages, especially Spanish.
Italian cardinal numbers, of any length, may be written as a single, continuous word formed by concatenation; sometimes with the elision of double vowels:
:342 ''trecentoquarantadue''
:1984 ''millenovecentottantaquattro'', not *millenovecent'''o'''ottantaquattrovent

===Cardinal numbers up to 1000===
{{col-begin|width=90%}}
{{col-break|width=18%}}
:0 ''zero'' 
:1 ''uno''
:2 ''due''
:3 ''tre''
:4 ''quattro''
:5 ''cinque''
:6 ''sei''
:7 ''sette''
:8 ''otto''
:9 ''nove''
{{col-break|width=18%}}
:10 ''dieci''
:11 ''undici''

:15 ''quindici''
:16 ''sedici''
:17 ''diciassette''
:18 ''diciotto''
:19 ''diciannove''
{{col-break|width=18%}}
:20 ''venti''
:21 ''ventuno'', not *vent'''i'''uno
:22 ''ventidue''
:23 ''ventitré''
:24 ''ventiquattro''
:25 ''venticinque''
:26 ''ventisei''
:27 ''ventisette''
:28 ''ventotto'', not *vent'''i'''otto
:29 ''ventinove''
{{col-break|width=18%}}
:30 ''trenta''
:40 ''quaranta''
:50 ''cinquanta''
:60 ''sessanta''
:70 ''settanta''
:80 ''ottanta''
:90 ''novanta''
:99 ''novantanove''
:100 ''cento''
:{{col-break|width=18%}}
:101 ''centouno''
:199 ''centonovantanove''
:200 ''duecento''
:300 ''trecento''
:400 ''quattrocento''
:500 ''cinquecento''
:600 ''seicento''
:700 ''settecento''
:800 ''ottocento''
:900 ''novecento''
:1,000 ''mille''
{{col-end}}

Keep in mind that for numbers higher than 20 (venti) the last letter of the part describing tens is eliminated if 1 or 8 follows, e.g. '''vent'''uno (21), '''vent'''otto (28), '''trent'''uno (31), '''trent'''otto (38), '''quarant'''uno (41).

For other ending numbers than 1 and 8 you just use the normal word for tens, '''venti'''due (22), '''venti'''tré (23), '''venti'''quattro (24), '''quaranta'''due (42), '''quaranta'''tre (43), '''quaranta'''quattro (44).

===Cardinal numbers from 1000 higher===

The number ''mille'' becomes ''mila'' in the plural, e.g. ''duemila''.
The numbers ''milione'', ''miliardo'' and above are not adjectives; they take a preposition ''di'' when followed by a noun, e.g. ''miliardi di euro''.

:1,000 ''mille''
:2,000 ''duemila''
:3,000 ''tremila''
:10,000 ''diecimila''
:100,000 ''centomila''
:1,000,000 ''un milione''
:10,000,000 ''dieci milioni''
:1,000,000,000 ''un miliardo''
:1,000,000,000,000 ''mille miliardi'' or ''un bilione''

===Ordinal numbers===

First ten ordinal numbers have their proper words, the others are formed from the cardinal number by adding ''-esimo'' (see table).
The final &quot;o&quot; or &quot;e&quot; is dropped from the cardinal number, unless it is an ''é'' in which case it just loses the accent, e.g. ventitreesimo.
The ordinal numbers are used as adjectives and as fractions. When used as adjectives, they agree in gender and number with the nouns that they modify.

Some ordinal numbers have synonyms e.g. undecimo (ancient italian) and decimoprimo (ancient italian) for undicesimo (11th), centosesto for centoseiesimo (106th), centosettimo for centosettesimo (107th), centottavo for centottesimo (108th), centonono for centonovesimo (109th); 110th is centodecimo

===Fractions===
A combination of cardinal (1, 2, 3...) and ordinal (3rd, 4th...) numbers are used to form fractions. 

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

The word ''mezzo'' is used to represent a half.

:half — mezzo

===Decimals===

{{TODO|part on decimals: how to write them, how to read them...}}

===Arithmetic===

The word ''più'' is used for addition.
:2 + 2 = 4, two plus two equals four, ''due più due uguale a quattro''
The word ''meno'' is used for subtraction
:9 - 2 = 7, ''nove meno due uguale a sette'' 
The word ''per'' is used for multiplication
:3 x 7 = 21, ''tre per sette uguale ventuno''
The word ''diviso'' is used for division
:10 / 2 = 5,  ''dieci diviso due uguale cinque''

Chocolate-Jalapeño Truffles

==Ingredients==

* 1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] [[Cookbook:Coffee|instant coffee powder]]
* ¼ [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] boiling [[Cookbook:Water|water]]
* 10 [[Cookbook:Ounce|ounce]] best-quality semisweet [[Cookbook:Chocolate|chocolate]], in small pieces or chips
* 10 tablespoons (1¼ sticks) best-quality unsalted [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]], cold and cut into small pieces
* 2 or 3 [[Cookbook:Jalapeño|jalapeños]], roasted, peeled, seeded, and finely [[Cookbook:Chop|chopped]] (wear rubber gloves)
* ½ cup unsweetened [[Cookbook:Cocoa Powder|cocoa powder]], [[Cookbook:Sift|sift]] onto a plate

==Procedure==

# In a metal 1-[[Cookbook:Quart|quart]] mixing bowl, dissolve coffee in water.
# Add the chocolate and set on top of a pan of gently [[Cookbook:Simmer|simmering]] water.
# When the chocolate has softened completely but is not hot, remove from heat and stir until smooth.
# [[Cookbook:Beat|Beat]] in the cold butter a small piece at a time, adding a new piece as soon as the previous one is almost absorbed.
# Beat with a [[Cookbook:Mixer|hand-held electric mixer]] until creamy, about 10 minutes.
# Continue beating for a few minutes to cool. (This can also be done in a stand mixer, fitted with the whip attachment.)
# Add half of the jalapeños and taste. Add more jalapeño to your taste; remember that the heat will intensify with time. Try for a balance of sweet and heat.
# Scrape into a small, deep container, press a piece of plastic wrap on the surface, and chill overnight, until completely firm.
# Scoop out small balls and roll in the cocoa powder.
# Keep refrigerated until ready to serve.

==Tips, Notes, and Variations==

* Roll the balls in finely chopped pistachios, almonds or macadamia nuts.

[[Image:Romaine.jpg|thumb|Romaine lettuce]]
'''Romaine''' or '''Cos lettuce''' (often called simply '''Romaine''' or '''Cos''') (''Lactuca sativa'' L. var. ''longifolia'') is a variety of [[Cookbook:Lettuce|lettuce]] which grows in a long head of sturdy leaves with a firm rib down the center.  Unlike most lettuces, it is tolerant of heat.

==Origin and etymology==

The name 'Cos' probably does not come from the island of Cos, but from the Arabic word for 'lettuce', خس. It apparently reached the West via Rome, as in Italian, it is called 'lattuga romana', and in French, 'laitue romaine', hence its other English name. &lt;ref&gt;Alan Davidson (food writer), ''The Oxford Companion to Food'', ''s.v.'' lettuce. Oxford University Press 1999. ISBN 0-19-211579-0&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cuisine==

The thick ribs, especially on the older outer leaves, have a milky fluid which is unpleasant, so they should not be used.  Neither should the leaf-tips because those can be bitter.

Romaine is the standard lettuce used in Caesar salad.

'''Comments from other users:'''&lt;p&gt;
[[User:jwilcock|John Wilcock]]: Whether or not this works seems to depend on other factors - but which?

In the last week this has worked for me OK on a multi-file French to Serbian XML project and failed on a single-file French to German TTX project. I suspected a possible interaction with the suppress locked rows option but this doesn't seem to be the case. Further testing needed...

'''Version:''' 7.0.284&lt;p&gt;

'''Reproduction:''' Can the issue be reproduced? Yes. Can it be reproduced on different systems? Yes. &lt;p&gt;

Example 1:

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Old sentence:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The version is displayed.{code}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dutch translation of old sentence:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;De versie wordt weergegeven.{code}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;New sentence:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The version is displayed as follows.&lt;br&gt;
(the difference being no code at the end and &quot;as follows&quot; added)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Assembled result:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;De versie wordt weergegeven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assemble produces a fuzzy match, correctly removes the code, but fails to insert the
translation of &quot;as follows&quot; which is in the TDB.&lt;/p&gt;

----
&lt;p&gt;Example 2:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Old sentence:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{code}Precautions When Disposing of the Device&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Translation of old sentence:&lt;p&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{code}Voorzorgsmaatregelen wanneer u het apparaat afdankt&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;New sentence:&lt;i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Requirements when disposing of the device{code}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Auto-Assemble now produces the following fuzzy match:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voorzorgsmaatregelen wanneer u het apparaat afdankt{code}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note that both &quot;requirements&quot; and &quot;precautions&quot; are in the TDB
(both with mutiple translations). So in theory EBMT should &quot;repair&quot; this fuzzy match, but the existence of several terminological alternatives (multiple exact match) may be preventing this(?).&lt;/p&gt;

----
&lt;p&gt;Example 3:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Old sentence:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{code}Carefully guide the USB cable into the trench as shown below, following the trench around and toward the back of the machine.{code}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Translation of old sentence:&lt;p&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{code}Leid de USB-kabel voorzichtig door de goot zoals hieronder aangegeven naar de achterkant van de machine.{code}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;New sentence:&lt;i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{code}Carefully guide the network cable into the trench as shown below, following the trench around and toward the back of the machine.{code}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Auto-Assemble now produces the following fuzzy match:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{code}Leid de netwerk-kabel voorzichtig door de goot zoals hieronder aangegeven naar de achterkant van de machine.{code}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note that both &quot;USB-kabel&quot; and &quot;netwerkkabel&quot; are in the TDB. So in theory EBMT should &quot;repair&quot; this fuzzy match, yet the hyphen in one of the portions seems to be preventing this(?), i.e. it produces &quot;netwerk-kabel&quot; rather than &quot;netwerkkabel&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Self-Respect Effectiveness: 
Keeping and Building Respect for Yourself'''

The interpersonal effectiveness skill &quot;Self-Respect Effectiveness&quot; emphasizes asking for what you want or need while respecting your values and beliefs.  The objective is to build your self-respect by not &quot;selling out&quot; to get what you want and need.  

When you practice self-respect effectiveness, you feel better about yourself and increase your self-esteem.  Self-respect and self-esteem are related -- what you respect is what you consider worthy of esteem and what you esteem is what you respect. To build self-respect, you must have the conviction of your own value.  Value yourself as you would value other things you treat with care.  

Self-respect will get your opinions taken seriously by other people who matter to you.  You have to honor who you are, how you think and feel, and what is going on in your life to get your opinions taken seriously.  

Self-care and self-respect effectiveness go hand-in-hand.  Self-care supports your well-being, your most valuable asset.  Without self-respect, self-care won't happen.
 
Self-respect entails the expectation of friendship, love, and happiness as natural, as a result of who you are and what you do.  Self-respect includes the belief that you are good, worthwhile, and deserving the respect of others.

One way to remember self-respect effectiveness is FAST 
* be Fair
* no Apologies
* Stick to values    
* be Truthful

Be Fair

You are fair when you treat others nonjudgmentally.  In other words, to be fair don't judge others.  Judgment creates bias, prejudice, and preconceived notions; it gets in the way of the facts.  The skill, &quot;Nonjudgmentally&quot; focuses on the facts (who, what, when, where) rather than your opinion of the facts (why).  That is being fair.  Fairness is evenhanded and impartial as it deals with the facts of reality.  You are more likely to be respected if you are true to the facts of reality rather than give in to your bias.  

You are fair when you focus on effectively dealing with reality without favoritism, deception, or bias.  Trust is built upon fairness with others, mutual satisfaction, equality, and understanding.  Someone who is trustworthy will treat you fairly.  Solving a problem with a fair person is easy because you trust that they are not going to take advantage of you.  We should be able to expect people to treat us fairly, honestly, and be governed by the Golden rule.  

Being fair is a non-polarized way of being, it tends toward the middle.  Fairness creates a synthesis between extreme or polarized points of view.  All-or-nothing thinking tends to be unbalanced, and go to one side or the other like black-and-white, right and wrong, good and bad, idealized and devalued. Fairness finds a balance between the extreme points of view. 

No Apologies

Over-apologetic behavior erodes your self-respect.  Do not say I'm sorry if you have nothing for which to apologize.  Do not apologize for being alive, needing food to eat, water to drink, are going to the bathroom.  Do not apologize for making a request for what you want or need.  Do not apologize for having an opinion.  Do not apologize for having an honest disagreement.  Apologies imply you're wrong or made a mistake.  Unwarranted and inappropriate apologies reduce your sense of self-confidence over time.  But, recognize when apologies are warranted and appropriate.

The antidote to apologies is responsibility.  Take responsibility for being alive.  It is your responsibility to get food to eat and water to drink.  You need to go to the bathroom, do it without apology.  Take responsibility for making a request for what you want or need.  If you have an opinion, speak up and let others know your opinion.  If you have an honest disagreement, let the other party know what's on your mind.  Being respectful is a two-way street, you respect yourself by taking responsibility for your wants and needs and you respect the other persons wants and needs and responsibility for taking care of themselves.  


Stick to Values

Your values are the principles by which you live and the beliefs that guide your behavior.  Values and value-judgments are based upon your moral beliefs or what you believe is &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot;. Your values determine your correct course of action.  Your values are ideals that guide your thinking and behavior.

You act with integrity when your actions conform to your values.  Integrity is a holistic feeling you get when your actions are congruent with your values. Acting with integrity may not feel right, but your wise mind knows this is the proper course of action.  You might be tempted to compromise your integrity to get what you want: being a &quot;doormat&quot; to keep a person liking you, shoplifting to get what you want, or lying to stay out of trouble.  Acting in a way that you value will pay off with increased self-esteem and self-confidence.  

People who have a healthy self-respect feel proud of and satisfied with their moral choices. To turn right or left at a street corner is not a moral choice.  Keeping promises and following through on commitments are moral choices.  If you tell someone you are going to do something -- do it!  Following through on your word builds trust.  When you do it, feel good about your follow-through and know it will have a positive effect on your relationships. 

To build self-respect by sticking to your values requires mastering all the skills , because sticking to your values is the hardest thing you are ever going to do.  Sticking to your values requires assertiveness, self-control, effective stress management, and strong enough inner reserves to overcome adversity.  You can do it because, basically, it means being yourself.  Being yourself is living the life you value.

If you value standing up for yourself, you must practice this skill with others.  Start by asking for what you want or need.





Be Truthful

Truthfulness has a strong reality orientation.  A truthful person aligns himself or herself with reality.  To a truthful person, facts are more important than opinions, and the truth is more important than being right.  

Of course, lying, exaggeration, and dishonesty distort reality then opinions become more important than reality and being right trumps acknowledging the truth.

Many people have a problem saying no to unwanted requests.  Think about how truthfulness can be useful to decline something that is not manageable for you at this time.  Be gentle, yet firm as you explain the reality of your situation.

'''Putting It All Together'''

Self-respect is respecting yourself.  If you respect yourself you tend to act in ways that confirm and reinforce self-respect.  It is appropriate to require others to deal with you fairly, without apology, with integrity, and truthfully.

If you do not respect yourself, you will act in ways that lower your sense of your own value even further.  Without self-respect, you will let people treat you unfairly, irresponsibly, and dishonestly.

If you want to raise the level of your self-respect, you need to act in ways that will make it rise.  Increased self-respect begins with a commitment to the value of your own person which is then expressed through congruent behavior.  Treating others with fairness, without apologies, responsibly, with integrity, and truthfully.

When it comes to self-respect effectiveness, think of the Golden rule with this twist: expect others to treat you as you would treat them.  Treat others fairly and expect fairness in return.  Do not apologize for things that you would not expect others to apologize.  Expect others to treat you with respect, kindness, and patience consistent with your own values.  Finally, expect people to be truthful with you, as you are honest with them.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Guidelines for Objectives Effectiveness:
Getting What You Want

A way to remember these skills is the term “DEARMAN”

		


					DESCRIBE  

					EXPRESS  

					ASSERT  

					REINFORCE  



			(stay)	MINDFUL  

					APPEAR CONFIDENT  

					NEGOTIATE  

Describe	Describe the current SITUATION (if necessary).  Stick to the facts.

		Tell the person exactly to what you are reacting.  

Express	Express your FEELINGS and OPINIONS about the situation.

Assume that your feelings and opinions are not self-evident.  

Give a brief rationale.  Use phrases such as “I feel”, “I believe”, instead of “I need,”  “you should,” or “I can’t.”

Assert		Ask for exactly what you want.  Say no clearly.  

		Assume that others will not do what you want unless you specifically ask.

Make your request clear and understandable.  Others expect you to ask directly for what you want.  

Reinforce 	Tell the person the benefits of getting what you want or need.

Help the person feel good ahead of time for doing or accepting what you want.  

Explain the advantage of your request.  Explain the consequences of attaining your objective.  Tell him or her (if necessary) the negative effects of not getting it.

Reward him or her afterwards with a smile and thanks.
 



(stay)  Mindful	Keep you focus ON YOUR OBJECTIVES and what works.  Practice non-judgmentally.  Avoid being judgmental.   

Maintain your position.  Focus on your objective and return to it if distracted.

“Broken Record”	Calmly and firmly repeat a short, clear statement (asking, saying no, or expressing your opinion) over and over until the other person gets the message.

Ignore	If another person attacks, threatens, or tries to change the subject ignore the threats, comments, or attempts to divert you.  Don’t respond to attacks. Ignore distractions.  Just keep making your point. 
	
Appear Confident		Appear EFFECTIVE and competent.
				
Use a confident tone of voice and physical manner; make and hold eye contact.  No stammering, whispering, staring at the floor, retreating, saying “I’m not sure,” etc.

Negotiate		Be willing to GIVE to GET.  

Offer and request alternative solutions to the problem.  Reduce your request.  Maintain no, but offer to do something else or to solve the problem another way.  

Focus on what will work.  Stay away from “fair”, “unfair”, “right”, and “wrong”.  

Turn the tables	Turn the problem over to the other person.  

Ask for alternative  solutions:
“What do you think we should do?”  
“I’m not able to say yes, and you seem to really want me to.  What can we do here?”  
“How can we solve this problem?”
 

Asking for What I Want or Refusing a Request: “DEAR MAN”

Describe the troublesome situation.  Tell the person exactly what you are reacting to.  Stick to the facts.  No judgmental statements.  Be objective.  




Express your feelings and opinions about the situation.  Use “I” statements which show you take responsibility for your opinions and feelings.  




Assert yourself by asking for what you want or saying no clearly. Assume that others cannot read your mind or know what you want unless you tell them.  Don’t expect others to know how hard it is for you to ask directly for what you want.  




Reinforce the advantage of your request.  Tell the person the positive effects of getting what you want or need.  Help the person feel good ahead of time for doing what you want.  Reward him or her afterwards with a smile and thanks.  




Mindfully keep your focus on your objectives.  Maintain your position.  

Appear Confidant Use a confidant tone of voice; make eye contact.  Relax your body.  Stammering, whispering, staring at the floor, or saying “I’m not sure” undercut your message.  Focus on the objective, not the fear.  

Negotiate by being willing to give to get.  Offer and ask for alternative solutions to the problem.  What am I willing to “settle for” or “give up” in order to achieve what I want in the situation?

'''Junipers''' are coniferous evergreen trees and shrubs, belonging in the cypress family (Cupressaceae). Depending on taxonomic viewpoint, there are between 50-67 species of juniper, widely distributed throughout the northern hemisphere, from the Arctic, south to tropical Africa in the Old World, and to the mountains of Central America in the New World.

There are many species to choose from in the landscape, most of which are tough, and very drought tolerant. Some species are widely used as ground covers, others for hedging, but primarily they are used as evergreen &quot;anchoring&quot; plants in mixed borders and foundation plantings.

==Description==
[[Image:Jun com cones.jpg|left|thumb|Cones and leaves of ''Juniperus communis'']]
Junipers vary in size and shape from tall trees, 20-40 m tall, to columnar or low spreading shrubs with long trailing branches. They are evergreen with either needle-like and/or scale-like leaves. They can be either monoecious or dioecious. The female seed cones are very distinctive, with fleshy, fruit-like coalescing scales which fuse together to form a &quot;berry&quot;-like structure, 4-27 mm long, with 1-12 unwinged, hard-shelled seeds. In some species these &quot;berries&quot; are red-brown or orange but in most they are blue; they are often aromatic (for their use as a spice, see juniper berry). The seed maturation time varies between species from 6-18 months after pollination. The male cones yellow and catkin-like, with 6-20 scales; most shed their pollen in early spring, but some species pollinate in the autumn. 

[[Image:Jun chin close.jpg|left|thumb|Detail of ''Juniperus chinensis'' shoots, with juvenile (needle-like) leaves (left), and adult scale leaves and immature male cones (right)]]
Many junipers (e.g. ''J. chinensis'', ''J. virginiana'') have two types of leaves: seedlings and some twigs of older trees have needle-like leaves 5-25 mm long; and the leaves on mature plants are (mostly) tiny (2-4 mm long), overlapping and scale-like. When juvenile foliage occurs on mature plants, it is most often found on shaded shoots, with adult foliage in full sunlight. Leaves on fast-growing 'whip' shoots are often intermediate between juvenile and adult.

In some species (e.g. ''J. communis'', ''J. squamata''), all the foliage is of the juvenile needle-like type, with no scale leaves. In some of these (e.g. ''J. communis''), the needles are jointed at the base, in others (e.g. ''J. squamata''), the needles merge smoothly with the stem, not jointed.

The needle-leaves of junipers are hard and sharp, making the juvenile foliage very prickly to handle. This can be a valuable identification feature in seedlings, as the otherwise very similar juvenile foliage of cypresses (''[[../Cupressus/]], [[../Chamaecyparis/]]'') and other related genera is soft and not prickly.

==Growing conditions==
Most species prefer a well-drained soil (though at least one (''J. virginiana'') will grow in wet soils as well), and full sun to very light shade.

==Species==
The number of juniper species is disputed, with two recent studies giving very different totals, Farjon (2001) accepting 52 species, and Adams (2004) accepting 67 species. The junipers are divided into several sections, though (particularly among the scale-leaved species) which species belong to which sections is still far from clear, with research still on-going. The section ''Juniperus'' an obvious monophyletic group though.

*'''''Juniperus'' sect. ''Juniperus'':''' Needle-leaf junipers. The adult leaves are needle-like, in whorls of three, and jointed at the base (see below right).
**''Juniperus'' sect. ''Juniperus'' subsect. ''Juniperus'': Cones with 3 separate seeds; needles with one stomatal band.
***''[[../Juniperus communis/]]'' - Common Juniper
****''Juniperus communis'' subsp. ''alpina'' - Alpine Juniper
***''[[../Juniperus conferta/]]'' - Shore Juniper (syn. ''J. rigida'' var. ''conferta'')
***''[[../Juniperus rigida/]]'' - Temple Juniper or Needle Juniper

*'''''Juniperus'' sect. ''Sabina'':''' Scale-leaf junipers. The adult leaves are mostly scale-like, similar to those of ''[[../Cupressus/]]'' species, in opposite pairs or whorls of three, and the juvenile needle-like leaves are not jointed at the base (including in the few that have only needle-like leaves; see below right). Provisionally, all the other junipers are included here, though they form a paraphyletic group.

==Uses==
Many of the earliest prehistoric people lived in or near juniper forests which furnished them food, fuel, and wood for shelter or utensils. Many species, such as ''J. chinensis'' (Chinese Juniper) from eastern Asia, are extensively used in landscaping and horticulture, and as one of the most popular species for bonsai. It is also a symbol of longevity.

Juniper berries are used in the distillation of gin and Jenever and the brewing of sahti. Juniper was also occasionally used in gruit, a mix of herbs used for flavouring beer prior to the use of hops. 

The berries and needles are slightly poisonous and can cause irritation after ingestion or contact with the skin.

==Maintenance==
Persistent deadwood, rusts, and phomopsis blights can be troublesome for some species. Pruning is best done in winter or otherwise cool weather, as the sharp leaves and resin can cause an itchy rash if they brush exposed skin.

==Propagation==
Usually propagated by cuttings or grafting.

==Harvest==
Berries are harvested fresh.

= St. George Defence/Three Pawns Attack =
In this position, the pawn cannot take the knight as 6. Qxb7 would be deadly. Two options are offered to black according to the former author, but only one is alright:

:[[/5...Ra7/]] protects the bishop, allowing the pawn to take the knight, but hangs the pawn. Therefore, 5...Ra7 is out.
:[[/5...Nc6/]] is a good move, defending the b pawn and attacking the now undefended d pawn.

The proof that there are infinite many prime numbers p1,p2,...,pn can be done really elegant by
assuming that there are only a finite nunmer of primes, and thet construct a new number (p1*p2*...*pn +1)

 doesn't know what a proof by contradiction is, then they are certainly not going to understand what a topological space is.</text>

== Start of the League ==


The Boston Boys Fantasy Baseball League started during the year of 2004, during which several baseball fans and fantasy baseball addicts gathered around a lunch table to discuss creating a fantasy baseball league. The fanatics agreed on a 10 team, mixed league, with an annual league entry fee of five dollars (which has recently been raised to seven). Draft order was decided using slips of paper randomly selected from an unmarked lunch bag.

First Round Draft Selections through the years:

2004: 1B Albert Pujols, St. Louis Cardinals

2005: RP Joe Nathan', Minnesota Twins

2006: OF Hideki Matsui, New York Yankees

2007: SP Daisuke Matsuzaka, Boston Red Sox

2008: OF Nick Markakis, Baltimore Orioles

2009: 1B Chris Davis, Texas Rangers 

2010: RP Joe Nathan, Minnesota Twins (note he went down with season-ending surgery before the season even started

The Boston Boys Fantasy Baseball League is a keeper league, meaning that each team gets to choose eight of its players to keep from year to year. The annual Selection of the Keepers is essentially a draft party, held each February, roughly three weeks from Major League Baseball's opening day.

== Social Bedlam of the Boston Boys League ==
 

Throughout the lifespan of the League, several disputes between managers have lead to a number of prominent changes. Most notably was the elimination of a League member, Joe B. Reasons include, but are not limited to: No interest in team or the league in general, &quot;dumping&quot; players off to other teams, and also becoming angry when approached about the subject of Fantasy Baseball. Bill's life was in shambles when he was invited to join the League during the second season, and eventually wound up the replacement for Joe B.  He is now a mainstay in the Boston Boys Fantasy League, and society in general. after a highly heated dispute regarding who the rightful replacement should be. Let it be noted that Henry was originally slated to leave the league instead of Joe B, and did, but after a short time was allowed to rejoin after the elimination of the hated Joe B.

===The Lockdown and the Yarmouth Sprint===

Each summer in The Boston Boys Fantasy Baseball league, the league commissioner packs up and travels to Cape Cod with his family for the summer. Being without a computer, he was forced to turn the league over to Assistant Commissioner, Dan. During the summer of 2004, the first year of the Boston Boys League, Dan was acting commissioner when catastrophe broke out.  Chaos and cries of revolution could be heard throughout the league in the form of dozens of arguments and shouts of mutiny. Overwhelmed with a mixture of power and chaos, Dan could do nothing to stop it. League members were going mad, adding and dropping players like there was no tomorrow and causing more trouble than was wanted by anyone. One member went so far as to say they had given up and that he would accept any trade offered to him during a certain time frame. The replacement commissioner, Dan, had to act fast and decided to shut down the member’s ability to trade. Joe felt it was necessary that Josh be notified of the chaos in the league. He called him, and left a Princess Laea-esque message on his machine.  Joe actually recorded himself and sent a hologram message to Yarmouth, using his trusty robot R2D2.  The message is thought to have read something like this:

Joe: Josh...We need your h;elp...Dan is d;estroying the league...he is overwhelmed by his new pow;ers...you are our last hope...you need to save the league now. According to my radar, the nearest computer that has internet capabilities is located at the '''Yarmouth Library'''. *end transmission*

Once the real commissioner heard the news, he immediately sprinted to his bike, and got to the Yarmouth library as fast as possible in order to restore order to the league. It has been rumored that he actually reached terminal velocity on his bike, but it was never proven by scientific means. It is only a legend. The league was in total shock when they heard that nobody was allowed to add, drop, trade, or post messages on the message board. This lockdown went on for over two weeks. Once order was restored, the league returned to what was important.  However, many members of the league still have sour tastes in their mouths from this event, over 3 years later.


===The Jorge Sosa Incident===

It was during the dog days of August, year 2, that the Jorge Sosa Incident occured. With competition still raging throughout the league, and the playoff race well underway, something smelled awry.  Bill left for a 10 day vacation, leaving the commissioner in charge of his roster for the trip.  Bill left instructions as to adding and dropping players, with one main requirement: DO NOT DROP '''JORGE SOSA'''.  Two days into the vacation, Jorge Sosa was dropped, due to a loss in playing time, according to the league office.  This caused much outrage throughout the league, because an executive order of a fellow owner was violated.  In the end, nobody picked up Jorge Sosa, and no actions of retaliation were taken by Bill.  Though no big short term damage occurred, the incident left members with bad feelings toward the commisioner.  It would build into controversy, and help lead to the Near Complete Coup d'Etat.

===Rookies===

A problem throughout the years has been about minor league prospects. This became an issue when Greg had drafted prospect Delmon Young. Because he was not in the Yahoo database, Greg was forced to have an open roster spot until that player was available. Without any warning, Josh picked up said player. He was then dropped, but claimed off of waivers by Henry. Once Greg realized it was very unlikely that Young would be starting at any time this year for Tampa Bay, he decided to drop all charges.

However, the first incident of drafting minor league players occurred during the draft of year two.  Josh decided to draft '''Huston Street''', prospect for the Oakland Athletics.  Nobody in the league was aware of said player.  Many members in the league were angered by the pick.  Also, Josh had an imaginary spot on his roster until Street was called up.  This also angered other members.  Huston Street went on to win Rookie of the Year.

Several teams in the league are now scouting players in the Little League World Series, in hopes of creating a good crop of ultimate-minor league players. Tom was the first manager to recruit a LLWS star, claiming Dante Bichette Jr. in the 18th round of this year’s draft. History Buffs from the Catchphrase institute (a center for the study of Boston Boys Fantasy Baseball) speculate this could lead into the Dante Bichette Jr. Debacle, later down the road.

===The Jonny Gomes Fiasco===

The Jonny Gomes Fiasco is one of the more recent controversies in the Boston Boys Fantasy Baseball League.  It was year 3 of the Boston Boys Fantasy Baseball League.  Before the draft started, Jonny Gomes was sure to be a major sleeper for many teams. However, when one team tried to draft him (Joe) the League Commissioner told Joe that Jonny Gomes would not be playing at all this year, and that he would be warming the bench for the Devil Rays. Joe then drafted someone else. Next up, the Andrew took a risk on him anyways, since it was late in the draft. It turned out that there was no risk. Jonny Gomes was up on the Devil Rays' depth chart the whole time! The &quot;risk&quot; paid off for the Andrew. Jonny Gomes had 11 HR in the first month of the season.  Who should actually own Jonny Gomes is still disputed today.  Why  the Commish relayed false information, nobody knows.  This would set the stage for many things to come in the league.

===Illegal Projectiles and Member Property===

After the completion of the draft of Year 2, the members of the league decided to play a good game of taps on Greg's ultra-expensive basketball hoop. His hoop sounded great the whole game, until the incident occurred. Joe was playing very intensely throughout the whole game. Finally, it was Joe's turn at the foul line. The game was getting close, and Joe was ready to do anything to win. When the other members would take their turn at the foul line, they would softly toss the ball against the backboard. However, Joe actually took a crow hop and threw the basketball as hard as humanly possible. It is rumored that the ball actually traveled faster than the speed of sound. This is noted because some members of the league report seeing the ball hit the backboard before they heard it. However, this was never proven by scientific means. After that, the backboard began to make weird noises. Joe denied any foul play in throwing the ball, but the members of the league continued to tease him about it. Finally, Joe got so steamed that he snapped. At first, Joe walked away and was about to go home. However, he turned around mysteriously. The members said, &quot;what are you doing?&quot; Joe singled out Tim, saying &quot;I'm gonna kill Tim!!!!&quot; However, he never fought Tim, because the other members broke up the conflict. Joe and Tim had heated arguments soon after the conflict, but they now are back to having a good friendship.

However, this infamous event would start an on going conflict between Joe and Greg throughout all of year 2. Greg says that the board is broken, but Joe disagrees. The current state of the backboard is still disputed today.

===The Open Mic Night Catastrophe===

On a Friday night in the winter before the 3rd season, many members of the League were spending some time at the open mic night that their school was putting on. Most of the problems were put behind members this night. In the middle of the show, Joe had received a text message from the commissioner saying that he had to create a new league because of a rule about a trade deadline.  Joe decided not to come to the Open Mic Night.  Instead, he felt a duty to keep watch over the State of the League.  When he realized that Josh was about to kill their original League, he immediatley called for back up.  He called the first person he could think of- Andrew.  Andrew was enjoying the Open Mic Night when all of a sudden...

*Ring, Ring*

Andrew: Hello?

Joe: Its JOE!

Andrew: Ya, Whats up?

Joe: You need to get back to your house now! Josh is going crazy! He is trying to start a new league or something, I;m tr;ying to fight it but no one will listen to me. So far Mike is the only one to join! Get back here, now!! I need backup!

Andrew: I'm on it!

Andrew felt it was pivotal that he go home to try and see what was happening. He left the school and returned home in a record setting 1 minute and 32 seconds. He signed on to the League immediately and gave Joe the backup he needed. Unfortunately, he was too late. The old league was destroyed in favor of a new league. The reason for this decision is still disclosed to this date.  However, there is one clue.  When one member asked Josh why he destroyed the old league, he said: &quot;If I ever see that old message board again, I will throw up.  We need to start anew.&quot;  Although there was much controversy on the Message Board, it was probably not enough of a reason to start a new league.

Many people speculate that this was the &quot;straw the broke the camels back&quot;, in that the revolution tension was at its peak during this point. There was much tension during this time, and the coup d'etat was incredibly close to happening. The NARCs and the Loyalists went on to sign the Wildwood Accords (For more information, see The Wildwood Accords.)

The decision to destroy the old league page upset many members of the league because they had signed up early enough to get a very nice and low league number.   However, many members felt that this was not crucial for the league. Unfortunately, nothing could be done to save the old yahoo league.

===The Most Controversial Kid in the League=== 

Since day one, over 3 years ago, '''Joe''' has been the most controversial kid in the league. Because of him, many long and stressful arguments occurred. He in many ways was the real reason why the league was locked down for those two long and frustrating weeks. He believed that Dan (acting commissioner while The Josh was on vacation) was acting like a dictator, and was using his “powers” way over the limit. Joe believed that the only way to stop this madness was to call the real Commissioner. The Commissioner then locked down the whole league because of how poorly Dan ran the league.

The whole league believes he will never shut up. He always has to have his way. In year two, Greg and Joe were always at each other’s necks. Every time Greg posted something, Joe would always fight back. These fights would last for days on end. However these two teams have fixed things up, yet small disagreements occur every once in a while.

Probably the biggest reason why he is very controversial is because he always vetoed trades that he accepted already. During year one, he always accepted trades, and then realized he made a mistake. He always got help from his cousin that guided him on every decision. He also got a lot of help from an outside source. Since year one, vetoing trades have not been allowed because of this kid. He not only vetoed his own trades, he vetoed other kid’s trades. If the person he wanted very badly was traded to someone else’s team, he would veto the trade because he was upset that he could get the player(s) he wanted.
Many People also do not like how he won’t trade Manny Ramirez and Vladimir Guerrero**. He has had both of them since year two, and will not trade them. People have offered a lot, but he feels that they are his “'''Franchise Players'''”. Will he ever trade any of them? Only time will tell. However there have been reports that he was thinking of trading Vlad earlier this year, but has yet to trade him.

(**) It should be noted that Joe recently traded Vladimir Guerrero and CC Sabathia to Henry.  Joe received...Mark Buehrle, Carlos Beltran, and Ryan Zimmerman.

== The Politics of the League ==
'''Mike: Why do we need the politics of the league, anyways?'''

Current Style of Government: Totalitarian

''Factions: Loyalists, The NARCs, Neutralists''

(*)Note: During The Summer of Dan, the Government was of a '''Laissez Faire style'''.\

=== Political Spectrum of the League===
[[Image:Political Spectrum.JPG]]

----

===The Near Complete Coup d'Etat===

During the winter after completion the second season, the members of The League felt that a change in commissioner was essential to keep order in the league. All but two members believed this. The members felt they were being suppressed by an unfair dictatorship, and wanted a fairer democratic league. Other complaints included the changing of stat categories to remove losses as a stat. However, this revolution was not completed because the current commissioner said &quot;And I'm getting pretty sick of you guys complaining. If you all hate me and my rules and ideas so much, then I'll just quit.&quot; Nobody wanted him to quit, so the revolution never went through.

===Cries for Democracy===

Most of the members in the league were for a league where they got a say in every single decision that is made (for the people, by the people...) , rather than an autocratic style of government.  The league members made a compromise over what type of Political system they would follow.  The Commish still has absolute power, but the members of the league can have a say in what goes on all the time.  However, it was soon found out in the Winter heading into the 4th season that this &quot;new government system&quot; was actually based on a faulty foundation.  To this date, the Commissioner still holds absolute power over every decision in the league.  However, Peace Talks are slated to take place before the draft on March 10th.  The hope is that a happy medium will be found between Dictatorship and Democratic Extremism.  The NARCs have drafted an Entente that is waiting to be signed by every member of the league that will hopefully fix all Political problems.


===The Wildwood Accords===

The Wildwood Accords was thought to have been the most important document in League history up until the Winter heading into the 4th season. Following the league's outrage during the Impersonation Era, and events like the Jorge Sosa Incident, and the '''Dante Bichette Jr. Debacle''', the league resorted to a rebellious and chaotic state in the off-season between the 2nd and 3rd seasons, AKA The Near Complete Coup d'Etat.  People say that during this time, the League was incredibly close to dispersing.  There were times that the league came horrifically close to war.  Thanks to the Wildwood Accords, disaster was avoided ''for the time being''.  This single event divided the into three distinct factions and ideologies: The (then) Northern Alliance, led by Andrew, Joe, Tom, Dan, and Bill, held a meeting at a scenic, private, and undisclosed location on Wildwood Drive.  The Northern Alliance was opposed by the Loyalists, consisting of Josh and Mike.  Like Switzerland in World War II, Greg, Tim and Henry were all neutral during this time of heightened tension.  The NARCs set up negotiating terms for the Loyalists about stat categories, and administrative powers.  The two parties communicated and established the '''Wildwood Accords''', which stated that the Commissioner not do anything stupid, and the NARCs would shut up.  The style of government would forever change from an Oppressive Dictatorship to a Controlled Dictatorship, or so the NARCs thought.  The Wildwood Accord proved to be similar to the Armistice that ended World War I, in that it proved to be only a stopgap between controversies.  In reality, it solved nothing.  Historians speculate that the Wildwood Accords will be the primary reason for an even worse war down the road. (See '''Cries for Democracy''' for more information on the faulty politcs the Wildwood Accords were based upon.)

===The Mafia (Now Defunct) Coalition===

After Illegal Projectiles, Joe and Greg were at each other’s necks for almost all of the second season.  However, during the off-season leading up to season three, Joe and Greg came to an agreement.  They agreed that they would ally themselves as the Mafia (Now Defunct) within the league and they would return to having a strong esprit de corps.  Ever since the Alliance was signed by these members they have backed each other up throughout the third year.  This created a new faction within the league.  Although Joe will still always be apart of The NARCs, his true alliance now lies with The Mafia (Now Defunct).

===The Impersonation Age===

“When the Other GM's Were Left in the Dark”
--Anonymous

The ''Near Complete Coup d'Etat'' was a result of the commissioner abusing his powers in a series of incidents including the '''Jorge Sosa Incident''', during what is now called The Impersonation Era. The commissioner took over control of the team Henry, without the consent of the owner.  This led to trading players in deals not ratified by the owner of Henry.  This outraged the league, because the commissioner was abusing his powers.  This madness was eventually stopped, due to pushing from the league, and the breaking of the communication barrier between Henry and the rest of the league.  This subject of the commissioner’s powers and how they were to be used, and had been used was finally put to rest that winter following the Wildwood Accords.

Government Style: Democratic Extremism

Current Members: Andrew, Tom, Joe, Greg, Dan

Purpose of Faction: The purpose of this faction is and will always be to up hold and support a democratic style of government. The NARCs would do anything to protect democracy. They have been known to cause chaos in the league, because of their fight for justice, but they believe it is chaos for the right reasons.

History: When the Northern Alliance failed after the Near Complete Coup de’ Tat was toppled, its original members were devastated. Their leader, Andrew, proceeded to rally his troops to create a stronger, cohesive group that would become known as the Northern Alliance of Renegade Commonwealths.

====Neutralists====

Leader: None

Government Style: None

Current Members: Tim

Purpose of Faction: To not cause any controversy in the league, and not to step in the way of it as well.

How It Was Formed: Naturally. When everyone else was breaking up into different parties, these members decided to stay completely out of any controversy.

====The Mafia Coalition (Now Defunct)====

Leader: Joe

Government Style: Forget about it.

Past Members: Joe, Greg

Purpose of Faction: To do the league's dirty work. They ddod have some ties with The NARCs, but they mainly only rely on each other.

History: All past records of The Mafia Coalition have been shredded.  The history of this faction will be forever shrouded in mystery.  What is known, is that they merged with the NARCs after dispersing.

====Faction Wars====

So far, there has only been one war that was close to happening. It was between the NARCs and everybody else. The Mafia Coalition had merged with the NARCs by this time. This war was settled by The Wildwood Accords, or so the members thought. (See '''The Wildwood Accords''' for more information)

===Coup de' Two===

In the off-season between the 2006 and 2007 season, there were great discussions to overthrow the commissioner, led by the new NARCS. The current commissioner was off at school at was in very little contact with the rest of the league. These long and often heated lunch table discussions included who the new commissioner should be, how much power this person should have, and other topics about the league including possible stat changes. It was when the idea of overthrowing power was brought to the history buff Mr. Donnelly that the league realized revolution was not the answer. The league talked peacefully over the Internet to the commissioner and the league became much more democratic. The league was mutually able to agree on a change in statistics on the night of the draft and so far throughout the 2007 season, there have been no talks of revolution. However, the participation of a certain member is in debate, and will be until the start of the 2008 season.

I would suggest omiting the icing sugar for a less sweet taste, over all the coating is a little more bitter but it keeps people coming back for more. Also if you like the taste of orange in your chocolate you can add 2 tablespoons of orange zest and a tablespoon of orange juice to the chocolate mixture immediately after removal from heat, a splash of rum or Kahlua is exelent also immediately after removal from heat

== Truffel? Huh? It's truffle... ==

In any version of English, it's spelled 'truffle.'</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
Marketing campaigns generate leads.  If these leads are not existing customers, they are added to the Contact Master.  Otherwise, the information is added to the Customer Master.  The Call Center follows up on those leads in an attempt to convert them into qualified prospects for follow up by Sales.  The results of these telephone calls are posted to the Contact Master or the Customer Master.  Details of each contact with the customer including date, employee, contact person, and activity are stored in the Contact Master or the Customer Master.

If the enterprise in involved in direct marketing, the Call Center may be involved in creating orders using Order Processing.  Only large ERP packages have a Call Center module.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Time for a lesson in terminology. The methods by which a cell supplies and stores energy are quite complex, and there are many long, scary words involved, as well as many short, scary acronyms for them. Many students will look at a system such as the Krebs cycle and tell themselves &quot;There are way too many confusing words here, this is not for me!&quot; In reality, the basic ideas are not that complex, and once you familiarize yourself with several of the chemicals integral to the energy storing processes, both photosynthesis and respiration will stop being so scary.

==Major chemicals==

===ADP and ATP===
''Adenosine triphosphate'' (ATP), considered the universal energy currency of the cell, is a molecule with three phosphate groups attached to it. Though all three bonds contain stored chemical potential energy, the bond between the second and third phosphate groups are relatively easier to break apart, thus providing a means of energy storage for the cell. As a result, breaking this bond to release energy, and forming it again to store energy, is relatively easy for a cell to carry out.

When an ATP molecule is lacking it's third phosphate group, it is called ''adenosine diphospate'' (ADP). Here is a handy linguistic trick to remember which is which: a molecule of ATP has ''tied-in'' energy, but a molecule of ADP is ''drained'' of energy. If that doesn't work, just remember that chemical bonds ''store'' energy, so the molecule with another phosphate group ('tri-' (three) is one more than 'di-' (two)) bound to it will have more energy. Those are two strategies for differing the two.

The most important aspect of ATP is that it is used in all organisms as a universal currency of storing and transporting energy for immediate use. ATP is  simple and easy to form, as well as easily portable throughout cell and tissue alike.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The totality of humans is unthinkable without African people. Likewise, our modern understanding of the world is unthinkable without African science. Yet there seems to be proportionally fewer discussions alluding to African peoples' participation in modern scientific thought. This book explores what science is and to a greater extent what science ought to be, and asks what is meant by someone or something being &quot;scientific&quot;. The work of African philosophy of science discussed here is not so much of discovering new facts about African people. But rather it is coordinating indigenous thought for the purpose of guiding a contemporary coherent cognitive orientation in an African world.

'''''Digitalis''''' is a genus of about 20 species of herbaceous biennials, perennials and shrubs that was traditionally placed in the figwort family Scrophulariaceae, but following new genetic research has now been placed in the much enlarged family Plantaginaceae. The genus is native to Europe, western and central Asia and northwestern Africa.

The members of this genus are known in English as '''foxgloves'''. The scientific name means &quot;finger-like&quot;, and refers to the ease which a flower of ''Digitalis purpurea'' can be fitted over a human fingertip. &quot;Foxglove&quot; has a similar origin as a corruption of &quot;folk's glove&quot;, referring to the fairy folk.

Foxgloves are grown for their showy flowers and long period of bloom, but they are highly toxic, so care needs to be taken when growing where children or pets are present.

==Description==
The flowers are produced on a tall spikes or racemes, tubular with 2 lips, and vary in colour with species, from purple to pink, white and yellow. Leaves are in basal rosettes and also alternate on the stem, simple with slightly toothed margins.

==Growing conditions==
Full sun with a rich soil. Short-lived, but self seed readily in good soils.

==Species==
*''[[../Digitalis cariensis/]]''
*''[[../Digitalis ciliata/]]''
*''[[../Digitalis davisiana/]]''
*''[[../Digitalis dubia/]]''
*''[[../Digitalis ferruginea/]]''
*''[[../Digitalis grandiflora/]]''
*''[[../Digitalis laevigata/]]''
*''[[../Digitalis lanata/]]''
*''[[../Digitalis leucophaea/]]''
*''[[../Digitalis lutea/]]''
*''[[../Digitalis obscura/]]''
*''[[../Digitalis parviflora/]]''
*''[[../Digitalis purpurea/]]''
*''[[../Digitalis thapsi/]]''
*''[[../Digitalis trojana/]]''
*''[[../Digitalis viridiflora/]]''

==Uses==
Foxegloves can be used for cut flowers, however due to the toxicity this may be inappropriate for homes with cats or children.

Digitalis is also the name of a drug, which is a classic example of a drug derived from a plant formerly used by folklorists and herbalists: herbalists have largely abandoned its use because of its narrow therapeutic index and the difficulty of determining the amount of active drug in herbal preparations.  Once the usefulness of digitalis in regulating pulse was understood, it was employed for a variety of purposes, including the treatment of epilepsy and other seizure disorders, now considered inappropriate.

==Toxicity==
Depending on the species, the digitalis plant may contain several deadly physiological and chemically related cardiac and steroidal glycosides. Thus, the digitalis has earned several more sinister monikers: &quot;Dead Man’s Bells&quot;, and &quot;Witches’ Gloves&quot;. 

The entire plant is a poison (including the roots and seeds), although the leaves of the upper stem are particularly potent, with just a nibble being enough to potentially cause death. Early symptoms of ingestion include nausea, vomiting, anorexia, diarrhea, abdominal pain, wild hallucinations, delirium, and severe headache. Depending on the severity of the toxicosis the victim may later suffer irregular and slow pulse, tremors, various cerebral disturbances, especially of a visual nature (unusual color visions with objects appearing yellowish to green, and blue halos around lights), convulsions, and deadly disturbances of the heart.  

There have been instances of people confusing digitalis with the harmless ''[[../Symphytum/]]'' (comphrey) plant (which is often brewed into a tea) with fatal consequences. Other fatal accidents involve children drinking the water in a vase containing digitalis plants. Drying does not reduce the toxicity of the plant. The plant is toxic to animals including all classes of livestock, as well as cats and dogs.

==Maintenance==
&lt;!--discuss any special maintenance concerns, such as pruning, transplanting, monitoring, etc.--&gt;

==Propagation==
Plants tend to reseed prolifically in the garden, but are also easy in flats.

==Harvest==
Flowers are good for the vase, but water should be changed and disposed of regularly.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==HOW THE IDEA OF WRITING THIS BOOK CAME TO MY MIND== 

This book was started by [[User:Odhiambo|Odhiambo]] Siangla, February 2007. With [[Wikibooks]] in growth, you now have a place to help improve this one.

[[African Philosophy of Science]]

The idea of writing this book, particularly, with others, and now in the Wiki community came to me about ten years ago. I was then a student of visual communication focusing on ways of seeing. 

To my surprise, I found that my quest for knowledge rested heavily on my sense of purpose and direction. And more, my sense of purpose rested on my sense of identity. All boiled down to ways of seeing. 

Writing a Wikibook now allows other people's ways of seeing to be part of mine. Write with me and we will see together. I welcome discussions and editing of this book so that we can produce a useful text about African scientific thought. Hopefully, from this, there will be scientific reasoning and contributions ranging from ancient to present era. People across the globe have reasoned about nature. Now let us reason about African scientific thought. There are documents written by the ancients about science. I am well aware here, though, that the phenomena considered by science differ from our sensual experience. But when we analyze anything, we hardly exclude our senses. And reasoning about science can only give us broader leverage in understanding history of humans. We research and tabulate our findings and at times speak about mathematical reductionism in the findings. And even after that, there remains still other ways of experiencing life. 

It is my belief that with proper research more will be coordinated in this book on matters concerning philosophical thinking attributed to African people's contribution world wide.

[[User:Odhiambo|Odhiambo]] Siangla

==Suggestion== 

This is a great idea! Especially an interesting one to be left open to a community to research! I would like to see parts of this book contain the fact that Fractals and Chaotic Iterations were used as patterns in the textiles and architecture in African societies way before they were thought of by conventional mathematics. This is particularly interesting since many people see Chaos theory as a 20th Century feat of the &quot;New Physics&quot; unaware that infact elements of it had been known 3000 years before and developed in parallel to Arabic Mathematics!</text>

:The colloquial title of the dish is &quot;Macaroni and cheese&quot;, for which the ampersand is an abbreviation. We cannot call it &quot;Macaroni cheese&quot;, because that doesnt make alot of sense. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:02, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

Is this taken from http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/recipes/recipe/0,1977,FOOD_9936_18422,00.html or vice versa? It's identical I think... (EAi on wikipedia [[User:85.211.21.99|85.211.21.99]] 23:47, 15 November 2007 (UTC))

Not exactly identical-- this one includes tabasco sauce in the list of ingredients (but it isn't used) and calls for red instead of yellow onion...</text>

Unfortunately, what you have contributed thus far does not seem to be in line with the purpose of Wikibooks as a development platform for academic textbooks. For an original RPG system, may I suggest RPGnetWiki? [http://wiki.rpg.net/index.php/Main_Page]. Perhaps this would be a better home for your work, it seems to have a lot of RPG systems and you can post yours. If you'd like help with transwikiing your work let me know.

[[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] 03:46, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

Ah, sorry about that. I'll try to move this to RPG wiki as soon as possible.

It is no problem, thank you for considering us in any case!

      <text xml:space="preserve">MagiNinjA is...busy. To say the least.

I'm also a [[w:User:MagiNinjA|wikipedian reader]], but frankly, I don't do much editing over there, if at all. I've come over here because I think I can make a change, frankly, the [[Music Theory]] book.

Hopefully I will eventually be able to contribute to a number of subjects including Programming, Music, and/or Science.

Thanks.

# We don't know.
}}

{{miskito_comment|Most plural personal pronouns are simply formed by placing '''nani''' after the singular pronoun, as we have already seen in the case of '''witin''' ''she, he'', '''witin nani''' ''they''. Thus '''man''' ''you'' (talking to one person), '''man nani''' ''you'' (talking to more than one person).}}
{{miskito_comment|So also with '''yang''', but '''yang nani''' expresses &quot;we&quot; in the exclusive sense of &quot;I and these other people (but not you)&quot;. We have already learnt that inclusive &quot;we&quot;, i.e. when also including the person addressed, is '''yawan'''. In a sense, then, we may say that there are seven &quot;persons&quot; in Miskito, as follows:}}
{| cellspacing=0 cellpadding=6 align=&quot;center&quot;
|
| align=&quot;center&quot; | singular
|
| align=&quot;center&quot; | plural
|-
| align=&quot;right&quot; |
1 inclusive
| align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#ecf3f7&quot; |
—
|
| align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#ecf3f7&quot; |
'''yawan'''
|-
| align=&quot;right&quot; |
1 exclusive
| align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#ecf3f7&quot; |
'''yang'''
|

'''witin'''
|
| align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#ecf3f7&quot; |
'''witin nani'''
|}
{{miskito_note|In fact we also sometimes encounter '''yawan nani''', apparently to emphasise the notion of plurality, as in the sentence: '''Yawan nani sut ba Miskitu nani sa''' ''We are all Miskitos'' (i.e. including you).}}

{{miskito_comment|There are no special plural verb forms. The form for each singular person is also used for the corresponding plural person, e.g. in the present '''-isna''' for &quot;I&quot; and &quot;we (exc.)&quot;, '''-isma''' for &quot;you&quot; both singular and plural, and (as you already know) '''-isa''' for &quot;she, he&quot; or &quot;they&quot;. As you also already know, '''yawan''' takes the same verb form as the third person. So for example the full present tense of '''aisaia''' ''to speak'' is as follows:}}
{| cellspacing=0 cellpadding=6 align=&quot;center&quot;
|
| align=&quot;center&quot; | singular
|
| align=&quot;center&quot; | plural
|-
| align=&quot;right&quot; |

{{miskito_comment|Sometimes the subject is omitted in Miskito sentences, the person of the subject being indicated by the verb, e.g. '''Miskitu aisisna''' ''(I) speak Miskito''. In such cases it is possible to indicate that the subject is plural (e.g. &quot;we&quot;, not &quot;I&quot;) using a different procedure: the auxiliary verb '''banghwaia'''. This auxiliary serves simply to indicate that the subject of the main verb is plural. When thus used, '''banghwaia''' takes whatever ending you would expect the verb to take depending on the person, tense etc. The main verb precedes '''bangwaia''' and adopts the invariable ''i''-form. For example, the present tense of '''aisaia''' can also be given as follows (omitting the subject pronouns):}}
{| cellspacing=0 cellpadding=6 align=&quot;center&quot;
|
| align=&quot;center&quot; | singular
|
| align=&quot;center&quot; | plural

In the past (third person), '''-n''' is added to the stem (or the stem-final ''a'' merges into the ending '''-an''', if you prefer to look at it that way). The final ''i'' of ''i''-stems merges into endings that begin with an ''i'' (but the ''i'' is retained before other endings); in the past, '''-n''' (not '''-an''') is added to the stem.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;p&gt;There is probably a &lt;b&gt;code problem&lt;/b&gt;. You can check by adding a new target language, e.g. Zulu: if you do a Pseudotranslation of that language (menu Translation) and can export that pseudotranslation, the file is exportable (Pseudotranslation inserts the codes correctly). If your language isn't, there is a code problem. (trick added by Walter Weyne)

Use the command Check embedded codes - Ctrl + Shift + F8. When DV stops at a row with a code problem a description is given (in small print!) below left in the status bar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Checklist:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. The target segment must match the following possibilities with
the source segment:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a. source begins / does not begin with a code&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b. source ends / does not end with a code&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. Codes must appear in the same relative order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3. Codes that are adjacent in the source (no intervening characters)
must appear that way in the target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4. Codes that are separated by one or more characters in the source
must be separated by one or more characters in the target (not
necessarily the same characters).  (You can add a character such
as ~ or $$ to find that location in the exported document and
correct it if necessary.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5. The codes are bracketed by curly brackets, for example {0039}, with the code and curly brackets greyed out. Sometimes, though, a code will &quot;lose&quot; one of its curly brackets, and become attached to another code, for example [0039}0040}, with the entire unit greyed out and a stray { in regular black text somewhere in the section. The solution is to delete the entire unit, use F8 to reenter the correct codes, and then delete the stray black bracket. (DejaVu doesn't like &quot;{&quot; and &quot;}&quot; in the text.&lt;/p&gt;

      <comment>/* Translating a docx file (Word 2007) using MemoQ */ Hint that information is obsolete</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Establishing the backup procedure for MemoQ ==

=== MemoQ ===
You probably want to create regular back-ups of your resources (projects, translation memories, term bases, settings, etc.) for disaster recovery. As MemoQ stores resources as files, it is fairly easy to create backups by simply copying folders or files. The below instructions let you create backups that you can quickly restore if your resources become corrupted. The backups created this way are not meant for &quot;long term&quot; usage though: trying to restore a backup created in an older version might cause problems.

Before backing up or restoring any files, make sure that MemoQ is not running. MemoQ might hold some files open or may even be writing into one of them, which might prevent a successful backup or restore.

You need to back up the following folders:

* C:\Documents and Settings\All users\Application Data\MemoQ
(In Windows Vista: C:\ProgramData\MemoQ)
* C:\Documents and Settings\(your username)\Application Data\MemoQ
(In Windows Vista: C:\Users\(your username)\AppData\Roaming\MemoQ)
* My Documents\My MemoQ Projects

(The above assumes that C:\ is the system drive.) For projects, translation memories, term bases, and filter configurations, the default storage paths can be changed in MemoQ under Tools &gt; Options &gt; Appearance, Locations. If you have changed the default paths for any of the above, make a backup of your new paths.

=== MemoQ Server ===
If you are using a server solution, it is also advisable to regularly back up the SQL database that contains information about the users, groups, permissions and projects. By default, it is found in the following folder, which also contains the project folder and some configuration files that you may also want to back up:

* C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\MemoQ Server
(In Windows Vista: C:\ProgramData\MemoQ Server)

The SQL database file and the transaction log are stored under the names MemoQServer.mdf and MemoQServer_log.ldf. Both are needed for a successful backup and restore. During the server installation you might have changed the path where the server database is stored. If you did change it, make sure that you back up the new path as well. The folder where server project documents are stored can also be changed from the Server Administrator, so if you are not using the default folder, back up the actual project folder as well.

Before the backup or restore operation, you will need to stop the MemoQ Server service and the service of the SQL Server instance pertaining to the MemoQ Server (in that order). Failure to do so may stop you from successfully finishing the operation, or might even leave the server in an unworkable state. After the backup or restore operation, start the SQL instance service and the MemoQ Server service (in that order) again.

Never try to restore a database backup if you have upgraded your server to a newer version since the backup was taken. The database schema often gets modified between versions, and a database created by an older version might not work with the current version of the server. If you need to restore a database that was created in an older version of MemoQ Server, you first need to uninstall you current version of MemoQ Server, and install the version the database was created in. After this, you can restore the backup of the database, and install the current version. The installer will upgrade the restored database to the current version.

=== License files ===
By following the above instructions, your backups might contain the license files of MemoQ and/or MemoQ Server. However, if there are frequent licensing related changes (e.g. you are using mobile licenses or have acquired new licenses recently), it might not be a good idea to restore earlier versions of your license files when you restore a backup. In this case, do not include the license files in your backup packages. (Or, if they are already backed up, do not restore them.) License files are named LicenseNN.dat (where N is a digit, e.g. License11.dat, License02.dat etc.). They can be found in the following folders:

'''MemoQ:'''
* C:\Documents and Settings\All users\Application Data\MemoQ
(In Windows Vista: C:\ProgramData\MemoQ)

and/or

* C:\Documents and Settings\(your username)\Application Data\MemoQ
(In Windows Vista: C:\Users\(your username)\AppData\Roaming\MemoQ)

'''MemoQ Server:'''
* C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\MemoQ Server
(In Windows Vista: C:\ProgramData\MemoQ Server)


If you have licensing problems after restoring a backup, update your licenses online first. To do this, click Activation (or Server Activation for the server) in the Help menu, and click Update licenses online. If this does not solve the problem, turn to Kilgray support.

== Purge older (multiple) translations from the TM ==

'''Task:''' How to purge older translations in cases where there are multiple translations for a certain segment.

'''Solution:''' This is in fact possible in MemoQ, with or without a bit of trickery,
depending on the settings of your TM.

# By default, a TM only allows one entry for the same source segment; this is a setting you can specify when you create the TM. You can also configure which entries will be kept: again, by default, the translation you commit later will overwrite the previous one. In this case, then, the issue of multiple translations does not exist in the first place.
# If your TM allows multiple translations and you want to purge it, there is also a way. When you open the TM for editing, you can specify filtering/sorting criteria. If you sort by entry date&amp;time, and then export to TMX, the entries will be listed chronologically. Importing back into a TM that only allows a single translation will have the effect that only the most recent translations are kept.

This is perhaps not an extremely easy way; but again, perhaps if one chooses to allow multiple translations, this is also not what you want to do on a regular basis.

== Working with TTX files using MemoQ 2.0 - alternate workflow ==

Recent versions of MemoQ (2.1 and above) have full support for TTX files, but for older versions, there is still a solution to work on TTX files. Here is how to proceed.

First of all, you will need to download a doc file, '''PlusToyz''', containing Word macros
and freely available from the Wordfast Yahoo group (in the Files section, at
http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/wordfast/files). You have to join the group to be able
to download that file.

Using any Web search engine, you may find several links to direct downloads, but 99% of them
are old versions of this file and hence results wouldn't be guaranteed.

So, here is how to proceed:

* Open the PlusToyz.doc file using Word

* Use the bottom macro ('''TTX file to Trados-like segmented text''') to convert your TTX file to word &quot;Trados tagged&quot; bilingual doc

* Import the resulting tagged Word file using MemoQ, making sure to add '''tw4winMark''' as an excluded style (make sure you also check the ''External'' box)

* Translate '''every *second* segment''', leaving all &quot;source&quot; (first) ones blank

* Once translation if finished and you are sure all due segments are properly confirmed, select '''Copy source to target where empty'''... from the '''Translation''' menu

* Now that all segments are populated, press '''CTRL+SHIFT+A''' to select all segments and select '''Confirm without update''' from the '''Translation''' menu

* You now have a fully exportable doc file (and proper TM, without useless source=source stuff)!

* Export the document

* Open the PlusToyz.doc Word file again

* Select the '''Segmented text to TTX''' macro to convert your translated file back to TTX

* Open the resulting TTX file using TagEditor and see by yourself, a properly translated file !

'''Please note that, although split/join operations during translation should not and may not alter the end result, it is better to restrain playing with it too much till we get large and solid reports that it won't affect the final TTX.'''

'''You can import DOCX files directly in current versions of memoQ.'''

== Translating a docx file (Word 2007) using MemoQ ==
'''You can import a .docx file directly in current versions of memoQ.'''

* Rename your .docx file and add the .zip suffix.

* Open the new &quot;zip&quot; file, and you will see several folders. Browse to the Word folder and extract only the '''document.xml''' file, which contains the text of the document that you will need to translate

* Start MemoQ and create a new project

* Select '''Add document as''' and browse to the '''document.xml''' file

* In the '''Document import settings''' dialog, you will have the '''XML filter''' already selected

* We will now create an XML filter for DOCX documents. Later on, you'll just have to double click on it to select it

* Click '''Manage XML formats''' to display the '''XML Format administrator''' dialog

* Now select the '''Create new format''' option

* Give a name to this brand new custom XML filter. Let's call it '''DOCX(Word2007)'''

* Make sure '''Create from scratch''' is checked and click OK

* In the '''XML format settings''' dialog, click '''Add file''' and browse to the document.xml file

* Now select the '''Tags and attributes''' tab and click '''Populate'''. MemoQ will analyse the file and automatically cerate the proper tagging settings.

* Click '''OK'''. You now have a proper DOCX xml filter. Click '''Close''' to close this window.

* Now that you have an appropriate xml filter, double click on the custom '''DOCX(Word2007)''' filter.

* The file is imported. You can now safely translate it using MemoQ.

* Once translation is finished, just export the document.xml file

* Replace the old document.xml in the .zip archive with the translated one

* Rename the file to remove the .zip suffix and restore the former .docx extension

You now have a translated DOCX file!

== Changing a TTX file source/target language using MemoQ 2.x and above ==

Sometimes, when your client sends you a TM using a specific source language (ex. EN-CA), you may import your TTX files into a project using another regional language (ex. EN-GB) only to discover later that, when you export the resulting TTX, the source language has changed! This may lead to problems, as TagEditor refuses to edit a TTX using language settings different than the TM it is currently associated with.

In fact, MemoQ sets the source and target language of your TTX files to those chosen for the current project. You may sometimes want to turn that to your advantage and deliberately chose whatever source and target language you see fit.

To do that, proceed as follows:

* export the translated TTX file(s) from your current project as MBD (MemoQ bilingual document)

* create a new project using any source or target language you need. &lt;br /&gt;'''special note here''': MemoQ defaults to EN-US if you chose only &quot;English&quot; without specifying the locale

* import your MBD files into this new project

* select all segments and copy source text to target

* export those TTX files using either &quot;export selected&quot; or &quot;export all&quot;

And here you are, you now have fully working bilingual TTX files you can open using TagEditor with the source/target language you chose!

== Showing spaces and other special characters ==

MemoQ does not have a built-in switch to show or hide spaces and other non-printing characters. You can display them by using a specially adapted font. The font in question, Veronika, was developed by Endre Both, and with the author's kind permission it is also available from the Kilgray site at the links:

http://kilgray.com/memoq/VeronikaSans.ttf&lt;br /&gt;
http://kilgray.com/memoq/VeronikaSerif.ttf

Note: Both Veronika fonts display rectangles instead of extended CEE (Central &amp; Eastern Europe) characters.

Denis Hay created similar fonts based on Calibri; these are also available from the Kilgray site with his kind permission:

http://kilgray.com/memoq/CALIBRI_MQ.ttf
http://kilgray.com/memoq/CALIBRI_MQ2.ttf
http://kilgray.com/memoq/CALIBRI_MQ3.ttf

A description of the fonts by Denis:

Calibri MQ just adds a smallish triangle-shaped glyph to display 
unbreakable spaces.

Calibri MQ2 also adds to that a tiny-weeny dot to display ordinary 
spaces. This dot does not hinder reading, unlike the usual modified 
fonts, but it allows easy spotting of double spaces when looking at it 
closely. That's the one I prefer.

Calibri MQ3 is quite similar to MQ2, but with a larger dot glyph for 
ordinary spaces, for those who may prefer that.

To show spaces while translating in MemoQ, follow these steps:

# Download the fonts from the links above
# Go to '''Control Panel''' / '''Fonts''' and choose '''Install New Font...''' from the '''File''' menu
# Browse to the folder where you saved the fonts, select them from the list at the top, and click OK
# In MemoQ, open '''Tools''' / '''Options''' and go to the '''Appearance, locations''' category. In the '''Font family''' drop-down list, select any of the newly installed fonts

MemoQ will now show small dots for every space character in the translation grid.

== Entering non-breaking spaces ==

Although this is not a documented feature, MemoQ can enter non-breaking spaces useful e.g. in the case of French quotation marks. To enter a non-breaking space press ctrl+shift+space instead of space.

== Getting rid of &quot;rogue codes&quot; in Word documents ==

For certain Word documents, MemoQ will show superfluous tags that apparently serve no purpose. Once you import your document, there's no way to delete these tags; the best you can do is to insert them by pressing F8 or put them at the end of the target segment by hitting Alt+F8.

There are several possible ways to reduce such tags prior to importing:

* Select the whole document and set the right Language
* Accept all changes
* Turn off track changes
* Turn off smart tags
* Select the whole document and set character spacing - Scale 100%; Spacing: Normal; and Position: Normal
* Save as Open Office and then back to Word (this may result in some loss of formatting)
* Save doc as Word 6.0/95 (this may result in some loss of formatting)
* TRADOS segment and clean up

These and other methods are discussed here: http://www.necco.ca/dv/word.htm#Rogue_codes

Some of these pre-import tips and others have been automated in a set of macros that I've assembled in a Word template with a custom toolbar (CodeZapper_2.3). This template also includes a few other pre- and post-processing macros that may be useful. It was principally intended for use with Deja Vu but MemoQ users may also find it useful in some circumstances. You can find it in the files section (http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/MemoQ/files/). Dave Turner

&lt;u&gt;More ideas on removing rogue codes from Jim Wardell&lt;/u&gt;:

If Word files cause rogue codes in MemoQ, pre-edit them looking for the problems suggested above by Dave. Also:

Make sure autohypenation is deactivated in the entire Word file.

Use Find and Replace to remove all optional hyphens.

Make sure the Word setting &quot;Hyphenate words in CAPS&quot; is off.

Sometimes rogue codes are caused when the font size in the source PDF text hovers between two integer sizes. The OCR output (which even allows half-point sizes) then can contain embedded font size changes (e.g. 11 pt. --&gt; 11.5 pt. --&gt; 11 pt --&gt; 10.5 pt.). If you get a lot of these, and the Word file itself contains several font sizes that you want to retain, you may need to go through and select the continuous font-size passages and apply the font size you want to use (in the above case, for example, perhaps Arial 11 pt.). A slicker, more professional way to do this would be to apply a style definition to such passages. Your style definition would also include No Autohypenation and normal character spacing.

If your source document does not contain bold or italics, select the entire file and change all to Bold + Italics. Then select the entire file again and remove the bold and italics.

If you are scanning PDF files using OCR software (and therefore are the one who created the rogue codes in the first place!), take a close look at the detailed settings options that were in effect when you exported from OCR to Word. Only use those settings that you need, the others may be generating rogue codes.

The Arial Unicode font is installed by OmniPage. OmniPage inserts tags around umlauts in Word files. I've solved this problem by removing the Arial Unicode font from my system. It's also a good idea when using OCR software to use font matching to restrict the fonts that are allowed in OCR output, e.g. to Times New Roman and Arial.

If your client offers to convert PDF files to Word for you, consider that he/she may be using a cheap PDF converter program to do this and might not have the slightest clue what he/she is doing. In this case, you're better off getting the PDF file yourself and using high-quality OCR software to do the conversion yourself. Be aware that PDF converters, even the best ones, are likely to cause more problems with rogue codes and formatting than professional quality OCR software. You get what you pay for. There also are major differences between the two leading professional-grade OCR programs in their ability to reduce rogue codes and produce TM-friendly formatting. Test both carefully and see which gives the more TM-friendly results in your situation.

The suggestions offered by Dave and myself should help you eliminate nearly all rogue codes, however if you are still getting too many, open MQ and notice where a given rogue code occurs, then open the offending file in Word at the same time. Try selecting the characters around the offending location and check for any changes in settings. If you learn something useful, please register as a Wikibooks author and add them to this page.

== Disable case conversions in &quot;Translation Results&quot; ==

For some languages, you may want to disable the case conversions in the &quot;Translation Results&quot; pane.

* &quot;Tools&quot; &gt; &quot;Options&quot; &gt; &quot;TM defaults, user info&quot; 
* Disable &quot;Toggle all replacements&quot;

== Filter out unwanted languages ==

Having to scroll through the list of languages during project configuration is tedious. In a future build Kilgray are likely to make MemoQ remember a list of recently used languages and display those at the top of the list.

Meanwhile, users can eliminate unwanted languages using the following simple procedure (based on a suggest by Gregory in &lt;http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/MemoQ2/message/291&gt;).

If you don't have an XML editor you can download the free XML Marker software from here: &lt;http://symbolclick.com/&gt;

Open XML Marker and open the file LangInfo.xml. This is likely to be located at 'C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\MemoQ' or it may be somewhere else, depending on your installation options.

'''Note''': Under Windows 7, the file may well be located at &quot;C:\ProgramData\MemoQ&quot;. This is important to note, since a Windows Search will not commonly (?) find files in this special, hidden system folder. --[[User:Drawdenrubdarb|Drawdenrubdarb]] ([[User talk:Drawdenrubdarb|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Drawdenrubdarb|contribs]]) 08:14, 15 May 2012 (UTC)

In XML Marker highlight the language codes you don't require, right-click and select &quot;Comment out Selection&quot;. Once all unwanted languages have been commented out, save the file and live happily ever after :-)

== Reducing increased size of RTF files converted from DOC format containing images ==

MemoQ does not work with DOC files, instead, during import, it converts your files from DOC format to rich-text format (RTF) using your Microsoft&amp;reg; Office™ Word application.
When the DOC files contain images, the images are converted to a useless, but huge windows metafile. This ensures compatibility with ANCIENT word processors, but does nothing for you. In fact, a simple company logo can expand the size of a short letter from 20 KB, to 1,200 KB (or 1.2 MB).  And that is before you start adding text. The solution is a simple change in the registry for WORD on each machine. 
To keep Word from saving two copies of the graphic in your RTF file do the following: 


# Close Word (if it’s running.) 
# Click Start &gt; Run. The Run dialog box appears. 
# In the Open box, type regedit and click OK. The Registry Editor opens. 
# Navigate to HKEY_CURRENT_USER &gt; Software &gt; Microsoft &gt; Office &gt; Version &gt; Word &gt; Options. (Replace Version with the version of Word you are using.) 
# In the right pane of the window, right-click and choose New &gt; String Value. A new string is created called New Value #1. 
# Rename the value to ExportPictureWithMetafile. (To do this, you can choose Rename from the shortcut menu.) 
# Once the name is changed, right-click on the string and choose Modify. The Edit String dialog box appears. 
# In the Value data box, enter 0.
# Click OK. 

This method is discussed here:
&lt;http://hotdocstips.bashasys.info/index.php/hotdocs/automation/correcting_bloated_images_in_rtf_templates/&gt;

== Using MemoQ postcardware and MemoQ Translator Pro (full version) on the same computer ==

If you want to use MemoQ 2.0, but at the same time install the full or trial version of MemoQ on the same computer, please do the following:

# Install MemoQ 2.0.
# Copy everything under C:\Program Files\Kilgray\MemoQ into a different folder, and make a shortcut to MemoQ.exe.
# Install MemoQ Translator Pro.

Now you can use both programs at the same time - but make sure you use different resources.

== Avoiding hangs when copying large blocks of text from source to target ==

If you want to copy large blocks of text from the source to the target during the translation process, MemoQ may currently hang or crash if the Quality Assurance module is running in the background. 

Go to the Project QA Settings in the main settings area and make certain that none of the boxes above the tabs are checked. Wait until you really get to the point where you really want to start doing quality assurance checking before you actually start to run the QA features.

== Using auto-translatables for number format conversion ==

Among other things, the auto-translatables function in MemoQ can be used to convert numbers from one language format to another. For example, English uses the comma as a thousands separator, and the full stop as a decimal separator. Italian uses them the opposite way. With the proper auto-translatable rules set, MemoQ will provide the &quot;localized&quot; version of numbers found in the source segment. These localized numbers are shown in the Translation results list. These auto-translated hits can be inserted quickly into the translation just like hits from translation memories or term bases. Auto-translatables are also used by the fragment assembly function.

Auto-translatables can be set at the project level (in the settings page of the project) or the global level for every project with the same source and target languages (in Tools menu &gt; Options &gt; Auto-translatables).

=== English to Danish/Dutch/Croatian/German/Romanian/Slovenian/Spanish ===

Below are the rules to enter for a project translated from English to the above (and possibly other) languages. It will localize numbers containing decimal separators or thousands separators (not both). The rules need to be entered exactly as below in exactly the same order to ensure that they work correctly. For information on entering auto-translatable rules, see the MemoQ help topics under Language specific settings &gt; Auto-translations.

&lt;u&gt;Rule 1 (changes 1.234 to 1,234)&lt;/u&gt;

Auto-translatable rule:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;(\d+)\.(\d+)&lt;/code&gt;

Replace order rule:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$1,$2&lt;/code&gt;

Explanation: If a sequence of digits is followed by a full stop and another sequence of digits, this rule will replace the full stop with a comma.

&lt;u&gt;Rule 2 (changes 12,345,678 to 12.345.678)&lt;/u&gt;

Auto-translatable rule:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;([\d]{1,3}),?(\d\d\d),?(\d\d\d)&lt;/code&gt;

Replace order rule:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$1.$2.$3&lt;/code&gt;

Explanation: If a sequence consisting of 1 to 3 digits is followed by a comma, which is followed by three digits, another comma and thrre digits again, the rule will replace the commas with full stops.

&lt;u&gt;Rule 3 (changes 12,345 to 12.345)&lt;/u&gt;

Auto-translatable rule:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;([\d]{2,3}),?(\d\d\d)&lt;/code&gt;

Replace order rule:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$1.$2&lt;/code&gt;

Explanation: If a sequence consisting of 2 to 3 digits is followed by a comma, which is followed by three digits, the rule will replace the comma with a full stop.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Forewords ==
The following is just a simple example on how to connect a Bluetooth device, in this case a Nokia phone, in a Linux environment.

For the purpose of this article we assume to have installed Linux Mandrake 10.0 (Kernel 2.6.13, X86) on our computer.

== Configuration and Connection ==
First we need the Bluez protocol, usually available as a RPM package on your distribution, then we have to start bluetooth service:

 '''[user@domain.org user]# service bluetooth start'''

now it's necessary to setup the PIN code and (if you want) the local device name link, for that purpose we edit (e.g. using JOE) the file &lt;tt&gt;/etc/bluetooth/hcid.conf&lt;/tt&gt;:

 '''[user@domain.org user]# joe /etc/bluetooth/hcid.conf'''

modify the following excerpts:

excerpt for PIN:

 '''# PIN helper''' 
 '''pin_helper /etc/bluetooth/mypin.sh;'''  

where mypin.sh is a file created ad-hoc.

Excerpt for name:

 '''# Local device name'''
 '''# %d - device id''' 
 '''# %h - host name'''
 '''name &quot;userdomain (%d)&quot;;'''

N.B.: file &lt;tt&gt;mypin.sh&lt;/tt&gt; contains:

 '''#!/bin/bash'''
 '''echo &quot;PIN:XXX&quot;'''

where XXXX means your PIN.

Now it's time to search for devices:

 '''[user@domain.org user]# hcitool scan'''

that should returns something like:

 '''12:34:56:78:90:12 user1'''

in other words bdaddr (BT address) and device name, please take note of bdaddr, now it's time to discover available services an the remote device and on which channels:

 '''[utente@dominio.org utente]# sdptool records 12:34:56:78:90:12'''

depending on the type of device we are analysing the request returns a long list of profiles, in this case we are interested in the dialup one, so let see it available on channel 1:

 '''Service Name: Dial-Up Networking'''
 '''Service RecHandle: 0x10007'''
 '''Service Class ID List:'''
 '''  &quot;Dialup Networking&quot; (0x1103)'''
 '''Protocol Descriptor List:'''
 '''  &quot;L2CAP&quot; (0x0100)'''
 '''  &quot;RFCOMM&quot; (0x0003)'''
 '''    Channel: 1'''
 '''Language Base Attr List:'''
 '''  code_ISO639: 0x454e'''
 '''  encoding: 0x6a'''
 '''  base_offset: 0x100'''
 '''Profile Descriptor List:'''
 '''  &quot;Dialup Networking&quot; (0x1103)'''
 '''    Version: 0x0100'''

then:

 '''[user@domain.org user]# rfcomm bind 0 12:34:56:78:90:12 1'''

in other words I ''bind'' a virtual serial port, &lt;tt&gt;rfcomm0&lt;/tt&gt; (&lt;tt&gt;/dev/bluetooth/rfcomm/0&lt;/tt&gt;), by means of the tool rfcomm to the remote device modem, not connected yet but ready for software's requests, let see:

 '''[user@domain.org user]# rfcomm show 0'''

that results in:

 '''rfcomm0: 12:34:56:78:90:12 channel 1 clean'''

BT modem ready as serial peripheral at &lt;tt&gt;/dev/bluetooth/rfcomm/0&lt;/tt&gt;

No need to mention that you in the meantime have already accepted the connection on your remote device.

== Bluetooth device as a modem ==
To use this ''ready to use device'' as a modem I suggest as dialer the program '''wvdial''', for this purpose we need to edit it's configuration file &lt;tt&gt;/etc/wvdial.conf&lt;/tt&gt;, like this:

 '''[Dialer Defaults]'''
 '''Modem = /dev/bluetooth/rfcomm/0'''
 '''Baud = 460800'''
 '''Dial Attempts = 1'''
 '''Init1 = ATZ'''
 '''Init3 = AT+CGDCONT=1,&quot;IP&quot;,&quot;web.omnitel.it&quot;'''
 '''Phone = *99#'''
 '''Carrier Check = no'''
 '''Stupid Mode = yes'''
 '''Username = &quot;&quot;'''
 '''Password = &quot;&quot;'''

N.B.: this example is from a working configuration for Vodafone Italy on a Nokia phone, for different countries/operators/brand configuration, please google with keyword '''+CGDCONT''' and operator's name, mostly you need to modify just the string 

 '''Init3 = AT+CGDCONT=1,&quot;IP&quot;,&quot;web.omnitel.it&quot;'''

according to your operator's specifications, and

 '''Phone = *99#''' 

according to your phone's brand.

Dialup and connect...:

 '''[user@domain.org utente]# wvdial'''

Good Luck!!!

* hciconfig
* hcitool scan

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;p&gt;Filter on Selection is one of the best features of DVX.&lt;p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;By default, the Filter on Selection feature is only available from the Context menu in the translation grid. One drawback of this feature, that one easily forgets that it is activated, because there is no visual indication on-screen. By customizing the interface and adding the functions to the toolbar, you will always have a visual indication when the FoS feature is activated.&lt;/p&gt;

* Download the zip file containing the buttons created by Allessandra Muzzi: 
http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/dejavu-l/files/Miscellaneous/filter_buttons.zip
* Unzip the file and follow the instructions in the readme.txt file

&lt;p&gt;When you have activated the Filter on Source/Target button, simply clicking the button again will deactivate it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Space is flat. This is shown by the density of matter, and cosmic background radiation.

The radiation left over from the Big Bang is about 3 Kelvin.

The rate of expansion of the universe is greater in proportion to the distance.
==Other Cosmological Models==
Throughout history, astronomers have been seeking models of the universe. The three best known are those by Ptolemy, Newton, and Einstein. They all had an explanation why the universe didn't collapse.

Ptolemy's model had the Earth at the center, surrounded by an &quot;8th Sphere&quot; of stars. The sphere held up the stars, so the universe didn't collapse.

Newton's universe was infinitely large. He postulated a universe where the gravitational force was in balance. In an infinitely large area, there is no center of mass; therefore, the universe could not collapse. Like many of his time, Newton also believed in an infinitely old universe. Given an infinite amount of time, if the universe was going to collapse, it would've done it already.

Flaws with Newton's model were apparent even in his time. Heinrich Olbers wondered: If the universe is infinitely large and infinitely old, why isn't the night sky as bright as the sun? This question became known as Olbers' Paradox. Olbers' proposed solution was that the universe was filled with dust, obscuring some of the starlight. However, this only appeared to solve the problem. Dust absorbs and radiates energy, so that the light being obscured would be transmitted anyway.

Einstein's model for the universe was a constant size. He postulated a repulsive &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; (lambda) force that counterbalanced gravity and kept everything from collapsing.

Immanuel Kant, a philosopher, proposed a disc-shaped universe.

The Tajik language (sometimes written Tadjik or Tadzhik; тоҷикӣ, تاجیکی‎, tojikí [tɔːdʒɪˈki]) is a variant of the Persian language spoken in Central Asia. It is an Indo-European language, more specifically part of the Iranian language group. Speakers of Tajik live mostly in Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, and western Pakistan. Tajik is the official language of Tajikistan. It is written in the [[w:Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic alphabet]].

Knowledge of the Tajik language will let you fully appreciate a rich and diverse body of literature.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[w:eXist|eXist]] is a native XML database that has a full REST interface.  This allows you to use eXist to save form data without writing any middleware glue.

== eXist REST interface ==
eXist provides a full REST interface that is easy to call from an XForm.  You simply put the URL in the action of the submission.

== eXist WebDAV interface ==
eXist also provides a full WebDAV interface.  This allows you to do HTTP &quot;PUT&quot; operations directly from your forms.

== eXist Example ==
In this example, we will create a user named &quot;juser&quot; (Jane User) and setup a collection to read and write form data.

== Sample Program ==
To run this program, just install eXist from the [http://www.exist-db.org] web site.  use the eXist admin menu to create a user called &quot;juser&quot;.  Then create a home collection for juser at /db/home/juser.  Then login as juser and create a collection called &quot;test&quot;.  You will put a form and instance data into this file.

To read and write instance data into a form just use the following example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
   &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;xf:model&gt;
         &lt;xf:instance id=&quot;data-instance&quot; src=&quot;data.xml&quot; xmlns=&quot;&quot;/&gt;
         &lt;xf:submission id=&quot;read-from-file&quot;
            method=&quot;get&quot;
            action=&quot;http://localhost:8080/exist/rest/db/home/juser/test/data.xml&quot; 
            replace=&quot;instance&quot; instance=&quot;data-instance&quot;/&gt;
         &lt;xf:submission id=&quot;save-to-file&quot;
            method=&quot;put&quot;
            action=&quot;http://localhost:8080/exist/webdav/db/home/juser/test/data.xml&quot;
            replace=&quot;instance&quot; instance=&quot;data-instance&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;/xf:model&gt;
   &lt;/head&gt;
...
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that if the data is in the same collection as the form (not a good long term design) you can use a relative path reference.  Also note that we are doing an HTTP PUT operation to the '''webdav''' (not rest) interface to exist.

== Using eXist URLs ==

It is easy to load XML data directly into your XForms application.  In the instance statement in your model just add a '''src''' attribute and put a path name to the file you want to edit.  The key is to put the word &quot;rest&quot; in the URL when you are reading data into your form:

   &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;xf:instance id=&quot;my-form-data&quot; xmlns=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://localhost:8080/exist/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;b&gt;rest&lt;/b&gt;/db/home/juser/test/data.xml&quot;/&gt;

Always put the word &quot;webdav&quot; in the URL path when doing an HTTP PUT.

  &lt;nowiki&gt;http://localhost:8080/exist/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;b&gt;webdav&lt;/b&gt;/db/home/juser/test/data.xml

That is all there is to it!

For more information see the eXist manual on using the REST and WebDAV interfaces for eXist.

== Using XQuery to return Document IDs ==

When using an XML database, you sometimes wish to have the database receive an XML document and store it in the correct location based on business rules such as the content of an XML document and the date.  This can be done in relational databases using stored procedures.

XQuery can be thought of as an XML-oriented stored procedure.  eXist allows you to save directly to the URL of an XQuery and the XQuery can store the document based on a number of rules.

Here is an example eXist XQuery that that takes HTTP POST and creates a path name to a collection based on the county in  input document and the date.  After it saves the file and checks that the save has worked it increments a counter similar to the AUTOINCREMENT property of some relational databases.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;

(: Save-crv.xq Version 0.1, Dan McCreary, March 2nd 2007:)

declare namespace request=&quot;http://exist-db.org/xquery/request&quot;;
declare namespace xmldb=&quot;http://exist-db.org/xquery/xmldb&quot;;

declare namespace c=&quot;http://niem.gov/niem/common/1.0&quot; ;
declare namespace u=&quot;http://niem.gov/niem/universal/1.0&quot; ;
declare namespace mn=&quot;http://data.state.mn.us&quot; ;
declare namespace mnr=&quot;http://revenue.state.mn.us&quot; ;
declare namespace mnr-ptx=&quot;http://propertytax.state.mn.us&quot; ;

declare namespace xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot;;

(: to store a CRV into the right location in exist we need 1) the county ID, 2) the date, 3) the sequence number :)

(: get the data from an HTTP post :)
let $crv := request:get-data()
let $count := count($crv//node())
let $county-id := $crv//eCRVDocument/RealProperty/RealPropertyLegalDescriptions/mnr-ptx:MNCountyID/text()
(: let $county-id := '19' :)
let $current-year := substring(string(current-date()),1, 4)
let $current-year-2 := substring(string(current-date()),3, 2)

(: let $collection := xmldb:collection(concat('xmldb:exist:///db/crv/data', $county-id, '/', $current-year), &quot;dan&quot;, &quot;dan123&quot;) :)

let $county-name := doc('/db/crv/data/admin/next-county-crvid.xml')//County[CodeID=$county-id]/Code
(: get the next-id from the sequence counter :)
let $next-id := doc('/db/crv/data/admin/next-county-crvid.xml')//County[CodeID=$county-id]/NextID
let $file-name := concat($next-id, '.xml')

let $collection-string := concat('xmldb:exist:///db/crv/data/', $county-name, '/', $current-year)
let $full-path := concat($collection-string, '/', $file-name)

(: ready to login and store a file :)

let $collection := xmldb:collection($collection-string, &quot;login&quot;, &quot;password&quot;)
let $retStore := xmldb:store($collection-string, $file-name, &lt;eCRVDocument&gt;{$crv/*}&lt;/eCRVDocument&gt;)

(: If the file that we attempted to store does eXist, then now it is OK to increment the sequence counter for the next user :)
let $retCode1 :=  if (doc($full-path))
   then ( update replace doc(&quot;/db/crv/data/admin/next-county-crvid.xml&quot;)//County[CodeID=$county-id]/NextID with
            &lt;NextID&gt;{$next-id + 1}&lt;/NextID&gt; )
   else ()

return 
&lt;data&gt;
  &lt;county-id&gt;{$county-id}&lt;/county-id&gt;
  &lt;current-year&gt;{$current-year-2}&lt;/current-year&gt;
  &lt;sequence-id&gt;{$next-id - 1}&lt;/sequence-id&gt;
&lt;/data&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Processing the Results ==

This XQuery returns an XML message such as the following

&lt;code&gt;
  &lt;data&gt;
    &lt;county-id&gt;19&lt;/county-id&gt;
    &lt;current-year&gt;07&lt;/current-year&gt;
    &lt;sequence-id&gt;47&lt;/sequence-id&gt;
  &lt;/data&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;

Assuming you have a hostname, port and application-name variables are set up, the XForms application would contain the following code:

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;xf:model&gt;
...
   &lt;xf:submission id=&quot;submit-validate-a1&quot; method=&quot;post&quot; 
      action=&quot;http://{$hostname}:{$exist-port}/{$application-name}/submit&quot;
      replace=&quot;instance&quot; instance=&quot;submit-result&quot;&gt;
         &lt;xf:toggle case=&quot;case-busy&quot; ev:event=&quot;xforms-submit&quot; /&gt;
         &lt;xf:toggle case=&quot;case-submit-error&quot; ev:event=&quot;xforms-submit-error&quot; /&gt;
         &lt;xf:toggle case=&quot;case-done&quot; ev:event=&quot;xforms-submit-done&quot; /&gt;
   &lt;/xf:submission&gt;
...
&lt;/xf:model&gt;
...
&lt;body&gt;
...
&lt;xf:case id=&quot;case-done&quot;&gt;
   &lt;xf:group ref=&quot;instance('submit-result')&quot;&gt;
      &lt;h1 class=&quot;result-text&quot;&gt;Your ID is = 
      &lt;xf:output ref=&quot;county-id&quot;/&gt;-&lt;xf:output ref=&quot;current-year&quot;/&gt;-&lt;xf:output ref=&quot;sequence-id&quot;/&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
   &lt;/xf:group&gt;
...               
&lt;/xf:case&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Setting the mime type for XQuery Results ==
If you want your XQuery to return the correct mime type put the following in the preamble:
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare option exist:serialize &quot;method=xhtml media-type=text/xml indent=yes omit-xml-declaration=no&quot;;
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare namespace util=&quot;http://exist-db.org/xquery/util&quot;;
...
let $ret-code := util:declare-option(&quot;exist:serialize&quot;, &quot;media-type=text/xml&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

(This suggestion from Kurt Cagle)

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare option exist:serialize &quot;method=3Dxhtml indent=3Dyes
omit-xml-declaration=3Dno
doctype-public=3D-//W3C//DTD&amp;#160;XHTML&amp;#160;1.1//EN
doctype-system=3Dhttp://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/DTD/xhtml11.dtd&quot;;
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The [[w:Apache HTTP Server|Apache web server]] is the most popular web server on the Internet.  It provides high-performance web pages serving and is very secure.

By default, the out-of-the box Apache server does not allow users to write files to a web server.  This is done for security reasons.

&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;WARNING: The following should only be used on Intranet servers and should be reviewed by security professionals in your organizations.&lt;/font&gt;

== Steps to Configure Apache HTTP Server to Enable &quot;PUT&quot; Operations ==

# Download and install the HTTP Server from apache.org. I am using v2.2.4
# Verify that it is serving up regular xhtml files like you think it should
# Stop the service
# In your httpd.conf uncomment the LoadModule for dav_module and dav_fs_module also uncomment the line &quot;Include conf/extra/httpd-dav.conf&quot; so that the httpd-dav.conf is loaded
# edit conf/extras/httpd-dav.conf and change the 'uploads' alias and directory to be what you want them to be. They should match, of course.
# To authenticate users you can use the htpasswd command line program to create the password and put it in the uploads directory. Of course, you can also disable password protection during the testing phase of your project.

== Sample httpd-dav.conf file ==
This is what the beginning of my httpd-dav.conf looked like when it was done:

&lt;pre&gt;
   DavLockDB &quot;E:/httpd/Apache2.2/var/DavLock&quot;
   Alias /uploads &quot;C:/www/xforms/uploads&quot;

   &lt;Directory &quot;C:/www/xforms/uploads&quot;&gt;
   Dav On

   Order Allow,Deny
   Allow from all

#AuthType Digest

   AuthType Basic
   AuthName DAV-upload

# You can use the htdigest program to create the password database:
# htdigest -c &quot;E:/httpd/Apache2.2/user.passwd&quot; DAV-upload admin
# AR: I used htpasswd -&gt; htpasswd -c &quot;C:/www/xforms/uploads/user.passwd&quot; admin
#AuthUserFile &quot;E:/httpd/Apache2.2/user.passwd&quot;
   AuthUserFile &quot;C:/www/xforms/uploads/user.passwd&quot;

# Allow universal read-access, but writes are restricted
# to the admin user.
   &lt;LimitExcept GET OPTIONS&gt;
      require user admin
   &lt;/LimitExcept&gt;
   &lt;/Directory&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Restarting Apache ==

After you make any changes to the Apache config files you must restart Apache using the Apache restart command such as:

   apachectl restart

or

  apachectl stop
  apachectl start

If you have problems, make sure to check the Apache log file.  If you get errors you may not have the permissions set correctly for the folder that your form is writing to.

== Checking the Access Log File ==
If your forms do not save, you can also check the Apache access log files.  They are usually located in a directory such as:
   Windows: C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Apache2.2\logs\access.log

If you see a line such as:
&lt;pre&gt;
192.168.1.105 - - [08/Feb/2007:16:58:01 -0600] &quot;PUT /forms/data.xml HTTP/1.1&quot; 405 235
&lt;/pre&gt;

This indicates that you are getting a &lt;b&gt;HTTP 405 error&lt;/b&gt;: Method Not Allowed. A 405 status code is returned when the client has tried to use a &quot;request method&quot; such as PUT or POST that the server does not allow.  This means you don't yet have your configuration correct and that your XForms will not save its data.

== References ==
This example was suggested by Aaron Reed from IBM Corporation Austin TX.

[http://www.somacon.com/p126.php]

This example includes screen images of the IIS administration tool.

IIS also has an access log file that will put 405 errors in it if there are still problems.

Any contributions would be helpful.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The aim of this tutorial is to give you a quick introduction to basic Octave and to show that you know a lot of it already. If you should ever get stuck or need more information on an Octave function or command, type

 help command

at the Octave prompt. &lt;code&gt;command&lt;/code&gt; is the name of the Octave command or function on which to find help. Be warned though that the descriptions can sometimes be a bit technical and filled with jargon.

{{NOTE|When having trouble getting Octave working, the sites [http://femhub.com/octave NCLab] and [http://www.verbosus.com Verbosus] let you work with Octave on the cloud. Both systems have a free mode.}}

== Starting Octave ==
Type &lt;code&gt;octave&lt;/code&gt; in a terminal window to get started. You should see something like the following, depending on the version that you have installed:
 
 GNU Octave, version 3.6.4
 Copyright (C) 2013 John W. Eaton and others.
 This is free software; see the source code for copying conditions.
 There is ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; not even for MERCHANTIBILITY or
  FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  For details, type `warranty'.
 
 Additional information about Octave is available at http://www.octave.org.
 
 Please contribute if you find this software useful.

 Report bugs to &lt;bug@octave.org&gt; (but first, please read
 http://www.octave.org/bugs.html to learn how to write a helpful report).
 
 octave:1&gt;

== Entering commands ==
The last line above is known as the Octave prompt and, much like the prompt in Linux, this is where you type Octave commands. To do simple arithmetic, use &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; (addition), &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; (subtraction), &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; 
(multiplication), &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; (division), and &lt;code&gt;^&lt;/code&gt; (exponentiation).

Many mathematical functions are available and have obvious names (with many of those similar to other programming languages). For example, we have:

* trigonometric functions&lt;ref name=&quot;radians-as-arguments&quot;&gt;As usual in Mathematics, the trigonometric functions take their arguments in radians.&lt;/ref&gt;: &lt;code&gt;sin&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;cos&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;tan&lt;/code&gt;
* inverse trigonometric functions: &lt;code&gt;asin&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;acos&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;atan&lt;/code&gt;
* natural and base 10 logarithms: &lt;code&gt;log&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;log10&lt;/code&gt;
* exponentiation: &lt;code&gt;exp&lt;/code&gt;
* absolute value: &lt;code&gt;abs&lt;/code&gt;

Various constants are also pre-defined: &lt;code&gt;pi&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;e&lt;/code&gt; (Euler's number), &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;j&lt;/code&gt; (the imaginary number sqrt(-1)), &lt;code&gt;inf&lt;/code&gt; (Infinity), &lt;code&gt;NaN&lt;/code&gt; (Not a Number - resulting from undefined operations, such as &lt;code&gt;Inf/Inf&lt;/code&gt;.)

Here are some examples showing the input typed at the prompt and the output returned by Octave.

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt;2+3&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{\log_{10} 100}{\log_{10} 10}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt;\left\lfloor \frac{1 + \tan 1.2}{1.2} \right\rfloor&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{3^2 + 4^2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;
 octave:1&gt; 2 + 3
 ans = 5
 &lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;
 octave:2&gt; log10(100)/log10(10)
 ans = 2
 &lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;
 octave:3&gt; floor((1+tan(1.2)) / 1.2)
 ans = 2
 &lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;
 octave:4&gt; sqrt(3^2 + 4^2)
 ans = 5
 &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt;e^{i\cdot\pi}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
 octave:5&gt; e^(i*pi)
 ans = -1.0000e+00 + 1.2246e-16i
 octave:6&gt; # Comment: From Euler's famous formula
 octave:6&gt; # extremely close to the correct value of -1
 &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
Some things to note:
* Octave requires parentheses around the input of a function (so, &lt;code&gt;log(10)&lt;/code&gt; is fine, but (&lt;code&gt;log 10&lt;/code&gt;) is not).
* Any spacing before and after arithmetic operators is optional, but allowed.
* Not all Octave functions have obvious names (e.g. &lt;code&gt;sqrt&lt;/code&gt; above). Don't panic for now. You will get to know them as we go along.

== Plotting ==
You are going to plot the following pictures using Octave:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;table&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;[[Image:Octave_plot_sin.png]]&lt;br&gt;Figure 1&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;[[Image:Octave_plot_step.png]]&lt;br&gt;Figure 2&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;[[Image:Octave_plot_trigonometric.png]]&lt;br&gt;Figure 3&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;[[Image:Octave_plot_trigonometric_sum.png]]&lt;br&gt;Figure 4&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Figure 1 contains a plot of sin &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; vs &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; and is generated with the following commands. While this is a simple example, it is meant to illustrate the basic functionality. We will see more elaborate examples later.

 x = linspace(0, 2*pi, 100);
 y = sin(x);
 plot(x, y);

The command that actually generates the plot is, of course, &lt;code&gt;plot(x, y)&lt;/code&gt;. Before executing this command, we need to set up the variables, &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;plot&lt;/code&gt; function simply takes two vectors of equal length as input, interprets the values in the first as &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;-coordinates and the second as &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;-coordinates and draws a line connecting these coordinates.

The first command above, &lt;code&gt;x = linspace(0, 2*pi, 100)&lt;/code&gt;, uses the &lt;code&gt;linspace&lt;/code&gt; function to make a vector of equally spaced intervals (sometimes also called &quot;linearly spaced values&quot;). The first value in the vector is 0, the final value is 2&amp;pi; and the vector contains 100 values. This vector is assigned to the variable named &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;.

The second command computes the sin of &lt;em&gt;each&lt;/em&gt; value in the vector variable, &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;, and stores the resulting vector in the variable &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt;.

(As an aside: the &lt;i&gt;name of a variable&lt;/i&gt; can be any sequence of letters, digits and underscores that does not start with a digit. There is no maximum length for variable names, and the case of alphabetical characters is important, i.e. &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; are two different variable names.)

=== Exercise ===
Plot the function &lt;math&gt;y = \lfloor x\rfloor&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;x\in[0, 15]&lt;/math&gt;. (This is Figure 2).

=== More on commands ===
The following commands and functions are useful for setting up variables for plotting 2D graphs.

* &lt;code&gt;linspace&lt;/code&gt; creates a vector of evenly (linearly) spaced values.

Usage: &lt;code&gt;linspace(start, stop, length)&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;length&lt;/code&gt; parameter is optional and specifies the number of values in the returned vector. If you leave out this parameter, the vector will contain 100 elements with &lt;code&gt;start&lt;/code&gt; as the first value and stop as the last.

* &lt;code&gt;plot&lt;/code&gt; plots a 2-dimensional graph.

Usage: &lt;code&gt;plot(x, y)&lt;/code&gt; where &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; are vectors of equal length.

* &lt;code&gt;figure&lt;/code&gt; creates a new plotting window.

This is useful for when you want to plot multiple graphs in separate windows rather than replacing your previous graph or plotting on the same axes.

* &lt;code&gt;hold on&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;hold off&lt;/code&gt; sets whether you want successive plots to be drawn together on the same axes or to replace the previous plot.

=== Example ===
We are going to plot Figures 3 and 4. Figure 3 contains the 3 trigonometric functions
* &lt;math&gt;\cos 2x&lt;/math&gt;,
* &lt;math&gt;\sin 4x&lt;/math&gt;, and
* &lt;math&gt;2\sin x&lt;/math&gt;
on one set of axes. Figure 4 contains the sum of these 3 functions.

Firstly, we use &lt;code&gt;linspace&lt;/code&gt; to set up a vector of &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;-values.
 octave:1&gt; x = linspace(0, 2*pi);

Then, we compute the &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;-values of the 3 functions.
 octave:2&gt; a = cos(2*x);
 octave:3&gt; b = sin(4*x);
 octave:4&gt; c = 2*sin(x);

The following plots the first graph.
 octave:5&gt; figure;
 octave:6&gt; plot(x, a);
 octave:7&gt; hold on;
 octave:8&gt; plot(x, b);
 octave:9&gt; plot(x, c);

We use line 5 (&lt;code&gt;figure&lt;/code&gt;) to tell Octave that we want to plot on a new set of axes. It is good practice to use &lt;code&gt;figure&lt;/code&gt; before plotting any new graph. This prevents you from accidentally replacing a previous plot with the new one.

Note that on line 7, &lt;code&gt;hold on&lt;/code&gt; is used to tell Octave that we &lt;i&gt;don't&lt;/i&gt; want to replace the first plot (from line 6) with subsequent ones. Octave will plot everything after &lt;code&gt;hold on&lt;/code&gt; on the same axes, until the &lt;code&gt;hold off&lt;/code&gt; command is issued.

The figure you see shows all three plotted functions in the same color. To let Octave assign different colors automatically plot all functions in one step.
 octave:10&gt; plot(x, a, x, b, x, c);

Finally, we plot the second graph.
 octave:11&gt; figure;
 octave:12&gt; hold off;
 octave:13&gt; plot(x, a+b+c);

Line 11 creates a new graph window and line 12 tells Octave that any subsequent plots should simply replace previous ones. Line 13 generates the plot of the sum of the 3 trigonometric functions.
A small note for mac users, if plot figure commands do not work first use this command:
&gt; setenv (&quot;GNUTERM&quot;, &quot;x11&quot;)

== Exercises ==
* Plot the absolute value function for &lt;math&gt;x\in[-5, 5]&lt;/math&gt;.
* Plot a circle of radius 1, centered at the origin. (This is not so easy.)
* Plot your favourite function(s)

=== Warning ===
If you try (or have tried) to plot something like &lt;math&gt;x^2&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\sin x \times\cos x&lt;/math&gt;, you will run into trouble. The following error messages are common. In the case of &lt;code&gt;x^2&lt;/code&gt;:
 error: for A^b, A must be square
In the case of &lt;code&gt;sin(x)*cos(x)&lt;/code&gt;:
 error: operator *: nonconformant arguments (op1 is 1x100, op2 is 1x100)

This error occurs whenever you try multiply or divide two vector variables (remember that &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; are vectors). For now, you can do one of two things.
# use plot(sin(x).*cos(x)) - notice the '.' between sin(x) and *. For &lt;math&gt;x^2&lt;/math&gt; plot(x.*x)
# Read the section on [[Octave Programming Tutorial/Vectors and matrices|vectors and matrices]].

== Challenge ==
Since Octave is a numerical (and not symbolic) mathematics package, it does make numerical errors and does not handle some operations well. To confirm this, make a plot of tan &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;, for &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; between -&amp;pi; and &amp;pi;.
What is wrong with the resulting picture?

Your task is to generate the (much better looking) graph below using what you have learned so far and the &lt;code&gt;axis&lt;/code&gt; function. &lt;code&gt;axis&lt;/code&gt; can be used to adjust which part of the plot is actually displayed on screen. Use the command &lt;code&gt;help axis&lt;/code&gt; to determine how this function works.

&lt;center&gt;[[File:Octave_plot_tan.png]]&lt;/center&gt;

It might take some thinking to get the asymptote lines at &lt;math&gt;x = \pm\pi/2&lt;/math&gt; right. You can use &lt;code&gt;help plot&lt;/code&gt; to find out how to plot dotted lines. (Try to make the plot yourself before looking at the solution below.)

Following commands could be used to generate the plot shown above.

 octave:1&gt; x_part_left  = linspace(-pi,  -pi/2-0.001, 100);
 octave:2&gt; x_part_mid   = linspace(-pi/2, pi/2, 100);
 octave:3&gt; x_part_right = linspace( pi/2+0.001, pi,   100);
 octave:4&gt; plot(x_part_left, tan(x_part_left));
 octave:5&gt; hold on;
 octave:6&gt; plot(x_part_mid, tan(x_part_mid));
 octave:7&gt; plot(x_part_right, tan(x_part_right));
 octave:8&gt; y_limit = 4;
 octave:9&gt; axis([-pi, pi, -y_limit, y_limit]);
 octave:10&gt; plot(linspace(-pi/2, -pi/2, 100), linspace(-y_limit, y_limit, 100), '.');
 octave:11&gt; plot(linspace( pi/2,  pi/2, 100), linspace(-y_limit, y_limit, 100), '.');
 octave:12&gt; hold off;

The horizontal plot range -&amp;pi; to &amp;pi; is split into three vectors such that singular points are skipped for the plot. In lines 4-7 the separate parts of the tan function are plotted. Thereafter, in line 8, we choose a limit for the y-axis and use it to constrain the vertical plot range (using the &lt;code&gt;axis&lt;/code&gt; command [line 9]). Finally we add the asymptote lines at &lt;math&gt;x = \pm\pi/2&lt;/math&gt; in a dotted style (lines 10 &amp; 11).

== Script files ==
It is useful to be able to save Octave commands and rerun them later on. You might want to save your work or create code that can be reused (by yourself or somebody else). Such files are known as Octave script files. They should be saved with a &lt;code&gt;.m&lt;/code&gt; extension so that Octave can recognise them. (The &lt;code&gt;.m&lt;/code&gt; extension is used because MATLAB calls its script files M-files and Octave is based on MATLAB.)

To run an existing script in Octave, you have to be in the same directory as the script file and type in the name of the file '''without the''' &lt;code&gt;.m&lt;/code&gt;  in Octave. For example, if I have a script called &lt;code&gt;myscript.m&lt;/code&gt;  in an &lt;code&gt;octave&lt;/code&gt; directory, the following two commands will execute the script.

 chdir('~/octave'); % This changes to the octave directory
 myscript;

Note that the &lt;code&gt;chdir('~/octave')&lt;/code&gt; command is necessary only if you are not already inside that directory when running Octave.

In the following section you will be shown a number of new statements that you can use to make your Octave code much more powerful. A number of example script files are provided and you should save these into a directory for later use. A good idea is to create a directory called &lt;code&gt;octave&lt;/code&gt; in your home directory and store all your Octave files in there.

= Creating vectors and matrices =
Here is how we specify a row vector in Octave:
 octave:1&gt; x = [1, 3, 2]
 x =
 
   1  3  2

Note that
*the vector is enclosed in square brackets;
*each entry is separated by an optional comma.   &lt;code&gt;x = [1 3 2]&lt;/code&gt; results in the same row vector.

To specify a column vector, we simply replace the commas with semicolons:
 octave:2&gt; x = [1; 3; 2]
 x =
 
   1
   3
   2

From this you can see that we use a comma to go to the next column of a vector (or matrix) and a semicolon to go to the next row. So, to specify a matrix, type in the rows (separating each entry with a comma) and use a semicolon to go to the next row.
 octave:3&gt; A = [1, 1, 2; 3, 5, 8; 13, 21, 34]
 A =
 
    1   1   2
    3   5   8
   13  21  34

= Operators =
You can use the standard operators to
*add (&lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt;),
*subtract (&lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt;), and
*multiply (&lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;)
matrices, vectors and scalars with one another. Note that the matrices need to have matching dimensions (inner dimensions in the case of multiplication) for these operators to work.

* The transpose operator is the single quote: &lt;code&gt;'&lt;/code&gt;. To continue from the example in the previous section,
 octave:4&gt; A'
 ans =
 
    1   3  13
    1   5  21
    2   8  34
(Note: this is actually the complex conjugate transpose operator, but for real matrices this is the same as the transpose. To compute the transpose of a complex matrix, use the dot transpose (&lt;code&gt;.'&lt;/code&gt;) operator.)

* The power operator (&lt;code&gt;^&lt;/code&gt;) can also be used to compute real powers of square matrices.

== Element operations ==
When you have two matrices of the same size, you can perform element by element operations on them. For example, the following divides each element of &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt; by the corresponding element in &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;:
 octave:1&gt; A = [1, 6, 3; 2, 7, 4]
 A =
 
   1  6  3
   2  7  4
 
 octave:2&gt; B = [2, 7, 2; 7, 3, 9]
 B =
 
   2  7  2
   7  3  9
 
 octave:3&gt; A ./ B
 ans =
 
   0.50000  0.85714  1.50000
   0.28571  2.33333  0.44444
Note that you use the &lt;i&gt;dot divide&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;code&gt;./&lt;/code&gt;) operator to perform element by element division. There are similar operators for multiplication (&lt;code&gt;.*&lt;/code&gt;) and exponentiation (&lt;code&gt;.^&lt;/code&gt;).

Let's introduce a scalar for future use.

 a = 5;

The dot divide operators can also be used together with scalars in the following manner.
 C = a ./ B
returns a matrix, &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt; where each entry is defined by

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;C_{ij} = \frac{a}{B_{ij}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

i.e. &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; is divided by each entry in &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. Similarly
 C = a .^ B
return a matrix with

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;C_{ij} = a^{B_{ij}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

= Indexing =
You can work with parts of matrices and vectors by indexing into them. You use a vector of integers to tell Octave which elements of a vector or matrix to use. For example, we create a vector
 octave:1&gt; x = [1.2, 5, 7.6, 3, 8]
 x =
 
   1.2000  5.0000  7.6000  3.0000  8.0000
Now, to see the second element of &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;, type
 octave:2&gt; x(2)
 ans = 5
You can also view a list of elements as follows.
 octave:3&gt; x([1, 3, 4])
 ans =
 
   1.2000  7.6000  3.0000
This last command displays the 1st, 3rd and 4th elements of the vector &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;.

To select rows and columns from a matrix, we use the same principle. Let's define a matrix
 octave:4&gt; A = [1, 2, 3; 4, 5, 6; 7, 8, 9]
 A =
 
   1  2  3
   4  5  6
   7  8  9
and select the 1st and 3rd rows and 2nd and 3rd columns:
 octave:5&gt; A([1, 3], [2, 3])
 ans =
 
   2  3
   8  9

The colon operator (&lt;code&gt;:&lt;/code&gt;) can be used to select &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; rows or columns from a matrix. So, to select all the elements from the 2nd row, type
 octave:6&gt; A(2, :)
 ans =
 
   4  5  6

You can also use &lt;code&gt;:&lt;/code&gt; like this to select all Matrix elements:

 octave:7&gt; A(:,:)
 ans =
  
   1   2   3
   4   5   6
   7   8   9

== Ranges ==
We can also select a range of rows or columns from a matrix. We specify a range with
 start:step:stop

You can actually type ranges at the Octave prompt to see what the results are. For example,
 octave:3&gt; 1:3:10
 ans =
 
    1   4   7  10

The first number displayed was &lt;code&gt;start&lt;/code&gt;, the second was &lt;code&gt;start + step&lt;/code&gt;, the third, &lt;code&gt;start + (2 * step)&lt;/code&gt;. And the last number was less than or equal to &lt;code&gt;stop&lt;/code&gt;.

Often, you simply want the step size to be 1. In this case, you can leave out the step parameter and type
 octave:4&gt; 1:10
 ans =
 
    1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10

As you can see, the result of a range command is simply a vector of integers. We can now use this to index into a vector or matrix. To select the &lt;math&gt;2\times 2&lt;/math&gt; submatrix at the top left of &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;, use
 octave:4&gt; A(1:2, 1:2)
 ans =
 
   1  2
   4  5

Finally, there is a keyword called &lt;code&gt;end&lt;/code&gt; that can be used when indexing into a matrix or vector. It refers to the last element in the row or column. For example, to see the last column in a Matrix, you can use
 octave:5&gt; A(:,end)
 ans =
 
   3
   6
   9

= Functions =
The following functions can be used to create and manipulate matrices.

== Creating matrices ==
* &lt;code&gt;tril(A)&lt;/code&gt; returns the lower triangular part of &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;.

* &lt;code&gt;triu(A)&lt;/code&gt; returns the upper triangular part of &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;.

* &lt;code&gt;eye(n)&lt;/code&gt; returns the &lt;math&gt;n\times n&lt;/math&gt; identity matrix. You can also use &lt;code&gt;eye(m, n)&lt;/code&gt; to return &lt;math&gt;m\times n&lt;/math&gt; rectangular identity matrices.

* &lt;code&gt;ones(m, n)&lt;/code&gt; returns an &lt;math&gt;m\times n&lt;/math&gt; matrix filled with 1s.  Similarly, &lt;code&gt;ones(n)&lt;/code&gt; returns &lt;math&gt;n\times n&lt;/math&gt; square matrix.

* &lt;code&gt;zeros(m, n)&lt;/code&gt; returns an &lt;math&gt;m\times n&lt;/math&gt; matrix filled with 0s.  Similarly, &lt;code&gt;zeros(n)&lt;/code&gt; returns &lt;math&gt;n\times n&lt;/math&gt; square matrix.

* &lt;code&gt;rand(m, n)&lt;/code&gt; returns an &lt;math&gt;m\times n&lt;/math&gt; matrix filled with random elements drawn uniformly from &lt;math&gt;[0, 1)&lt;/math&gt;.  Similarly, &lt;code&gt;rand(n)&lt;/code&gt; returns &lt;math&gt;n\times n&lt;/math&gt; square matrix.

* &lt;code&gt;randn(m, n)&lt;/code&gt; returns an &lt;math&gt;m\times n&lt;/math&gt; matrix filled with normally distributed random elements.

* &lt;code&gt;randperm(n)&lt;/code&gt; returns a row vector containing a random permutation of the numbers &lt;math&gt;1, 2, \ldots, n&lt;/math&gt;.

* &lt;code&gt;diag(x)&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;diag(A)&lt;/code&gt;. For a vector, &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;, this returns a square matrix with the elements of &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; on the diagonal and 0s everywhere else. For a matrix, &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;, this returns a vector containing the diagonal elements of &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. For example,
 octave:16&gt; A = [1, 2, 3; 4, 5, 6; 7, 8, 9]
 A =
 
   1  2  3
   4  5  6
   7  8  9
 
 octave:17&gt; x = diag(A)
 ans =
 
   1
   5
   9
 
 octave:18&gt; diag(x)
 ans =
 
   1  0  0
   0  5  0

* &lt;code&gt;linspace(a, b, n)&lt;/code&gt; returns a vector with &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; values, such that the first element equals &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;, the last element equals &lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt; and the difference between consecutive elements is constant.

=== Other matrices ===
There are some more functions for creating special matrices. These are
*&lt;code&gt;hankel&lt;/code&gt; ([[w:Hankel matrix|Hankel matrix]]),
*&lt;code&gt;hilb&lt;/code&gt; ([[w:Hilbert matrix|Hilbert matrix]]),
*&lt;code&gt;invhilb&lt;/code&gt; (Inverse of a Hilbert matrix),
*&lt;code&gt;sylvester_matrix&lt;/code&gt; ([[w:Sylvester matrix|Sylvester matrix]]) - In v3.8.1 there is a warning: sylvester_matrix is obsolete and will be removed from a future version of Octave; please use hadamard(2^k) instead,
*&lt;code&gt;toeplitz&lt;/code&gt; ([[w:Toeplitz matrix|Toeplitz matrix]]),
*&lt;code&gt;vander&lt;/code&gt; ([[w:Vandermonde matrix|Vandermonde matrix]]).
Use &lt;code&gt;help&lt;/code&gt; to find out more about how to use these functions.

== Changing matrices ==
* &lt;code&gt;fliplr(A)&lt;/code&gt; returns a copy of matrix &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt; with the order of the columns reversed, for example,
 octave:49&gt; A = [1, 2, 3, 4; 5, 6, 7, 8; 9, 10, 11, 12] 
 A =
 
    1   2   3   4
    5   6   7   8
    9  10  11  12
 
 octave:50&gt; fliplr(A)
 ans =
 
    4   3   2   1
    8   7   6   5
   12  11  10   9

* &lt;code&gt;flipud(A)&lt;/code&gt; returns a copy of matrix &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt; with the order of the rows reversed, for example,
 octave:51&gt; flipud(A)
 ans =
 
    9  10  11  12
    5   6   7   8
    1   2   3   4

* &lt;code&gt;rot90(A, n)&lt;/code&gt; returns a copy of matrix &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt; that has been rotated by (90n)&amp;deg; counterclockwise. The second argument, &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, is optional with default value 1, and it may be negative.
 octave:52&gt; rot90(A)
 ans =
 
    4   8  12
    3   7  11
    2   6  10
    1   5   9

* &lt;code&gt;reshape(A, m, n)&lt;/code&gt; creates an &lt;math&gt;m\times n&lt;/math&gt; matrix with elements taken from &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. The number of elements in &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt; has to be equal to &lt;math&gt;mn&lt;/math&gt;. The elements are taken from &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt; in column major order, meaning that values in the first column (&lt;math&gt;A_{11}, \ldots, A_{m1}&lt;/math&gt;) are read first, then the second column (&lt;math&gt;A_{12}, \ldots, A_{m2}&lt;/math&gt;), etc.
 octave:53&gt; reshape(A, 2, 6)
 ans =
 
    1   9   6   3  11   8
    5   2  10   7   4  12

* &lt;code&gt;sort(x)&lt;/code&gt; returns a copy of the vector &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; with the elements sorted in increasing order.
 octave:54&gt; x = rand(1, 6)
 x =
 
   0.25500  0.33525  0.26586  0.92658  0.68799  0.69682
 
 octave:55&gt; sort(x)
 ans =
 
   0.25500  0.26586  0.33525  0.68799  0.69682  0.92658

      <text xml:space="preserve">__TOC__

= The &lt;code&gt;disp&lt;/code&gt; function =
The &lt;code&gt;disp&lt;/code&gt; function displays the value of a variable (scalar, vector, matrix, string, etc.) in the same way as simply typing the name of the variable does. For example,
 octave:1&gt; x = [1, 2, 3]
 x =
 
   1  2  3
 
 octave:2&gt; disp(x)
   1  2  3
The name of the variable is, however, not displayed. You can also display the result of a computation without the &lt;code&gt;ans&amp;nbsp;=&lt;/code&gt; that normally precedes it.
 octave:3&gt; log(10)
 ans = 2.3026
 octave:4&gt; disp(log(10))
 2.3026

The output of &lt;code&gt;disp&lt;/code&gt; depends on the &lt;code&gt;format&lt;/code&gt; command.
 octave:5&gt; format long
 octave:6&gt; disp(log(10))
 2.30258509299405

The displayed value can be printed to the screen, saved in a string or saved to a file using &lt;code&gt;fdisp&lt;/code&gt;.
 octave:7&gt; s = disp(log(10))
 s = 2.30258509299405
Note that &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; is a ''string'' containing the characters shown above.

== File output ==
The &lt;code&gt;fdisp&lt;/code&gt; function can be used to save values to a file. Before we can do this, we have to open a file. This is done using the &lt;code&gt;fopen&lt;/code&gt; command.
* &lt;code&gt;fopen(filename, mode)&lt;/code&gt; opens a file and returns an identifier for it. The &lt;code&gt;filename&lt;/code&gt; argument is a string and can be the name of any new or existing file in the current directory. The &lt;code&gt;mode&lt;/code&gt; argument is a string that specifies whether the file is opened for
* reading (&lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt;),
* writing (&lt;code&gt;w&lt;/code&gt;), or
* appending (&lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;).
When a file is opened for writing, ''its contents are erased and replaced with new data''. To keep the existing data in a file and add to the end thereof, use the append mode.
 octave:10&gt; file_id = fopen('mydata.txt', 'w');
Here, &lt;code&gt;file_id&lt;/code&gt; is simply the name of a variable that we use to tell Octave which file to write.
* &lt;code&gt;fdisp(file_id, value)&lt;/code&gt; writes &lt;code&gt;value&lt;/code&gt; to the file identified by &lt;code&gt;file_id&lt;/code&gt;.
The output written to the file will appear exactly the same as the output from the &lt;code&gt;disp&lt;/code&gt; command.

''It is important to close a file after all data has been written to it.'' Closing the file tells Octave to finalise any output that might still be pending and frees up the file so that it can be opened by other users or programmes.
* &lt;code&gt;fclose(file_id) closes the file identified by &lt;code&gt;file_id&lt;/code&gt;.

= The &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt; function =
The &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt; function is considerably more powerful than &lt;code&gt;disp&lt;/code&gt; and, consequently, a bit more complicated to use. With &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt;, you can define exactly what the output of a value should look like. This includes specifying
* the number of significant digits to display;
* the format of the number (integer, real, scientific, etc.);
* other output to display before or after the value.

Since there are so many different ways to format output using &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt;, we will discuss only the basics here using examples. For more complete information, type
 doc printf
in Octave and page through the help using the spacebar key.

== Outputting to screen, string or file ==
The &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt; function displays its output on the screen. Use the &lt;code&gt;sprintf&lt;/code&gt; to return the result in a string and &lt;code&gt;fprintf&lt;/code&gt; to write to a file. Note that the &lt;code&gt;fprintf&lt;/code&gt; requires one additional parameter to specify the file identifier.
* &lt;code&gt;printf(format, value, ...)&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;sprintf(format, value, ...)&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;fprintf(fid, format, value, ...)&lt;/code&gt;

Note that these functions can output more than one value at the same time--more on this in the next section.

== The format string ==
Let's look at an example.
 octave:18&gt; x = 10.1;
 octave:19&gt; y = 5.5;
 octave:20&gt; z = 'test';
 octave:21&gt; printf('An integer: %i. A real: %f. This is a %s.\n', x, y, z);
 An integer: 10. A real: 5.500000. This is a test.
The important part is the first argument to the &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt; function on line 21. It specifies what the output of &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt; should look like. Essentially, the precentage sign (&lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt;) indicates that a value should be placed at its position in the format string. In the format string
 'An integer: %i. A real: %f. This is a %s.\n'
the &lt;code&gt;%i&lt;/code&gt; is replaced with an integer, the &lt;code&gt;%f&lt;/code&gt; with a real (&lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; is for floating point) value, and the &lt;code&gt;%s&lt;/code&gt; with a string. The values of the integer, real and string are given as arguments to &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt; after the format string. Note that &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; in the example above equals 10.1, but the value displayed is 10 since we specified that &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt; should display an integer. Finally, the &lt;code&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt; at the end of the string tells Octave to move to a new line.

The next example demonstrates the following types:
* integer (&lt;code&gt;%i&lt;/code&gt;),
* real (&lt;code&gt;%f&lt;/code&gt;),
* scientific notation (&lt;code&gt;%e&lt;/code&gt;),
* percentage symbol (&lt;code&gt;%%&lt;/code&gt;).
For more types, see the Octave documentation.

 octave:22&gt; x = 10.34;
 octave:23&gt; printf(&quot;x is a real number: %f (%e in scientific notation).\n&quot;, x, x);
 x is a real number: 10.340000 (1.034000e+01 in scientific notation).
 octave:24&gt; printf(&quot;Write percentages as %i%%.\n&quot;, x);
 Write percentages as 10%.

Note that
* the &lt;code&gt;%e&lt;/code&gt; format outputs a value in the form &lt;math&gt;a\times10^b&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;1\le a&lt;10&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt; is an integer;
* the variable &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is passed to &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt; ''twice'' on line 23 since we want to output it twice (in different formats);
* the double percentage (&lt;code&gt;%%&lt;/code&gt;) on line 24 outputs a single percentage symbol.

We can customize the output of values even further by specifying
* the width of the output, and
* the precision of the output.

The width allows you to right align numbers and is specified between the percentage and the format specifier. For example,
 octave:36&gt; x = 10;
 octave:37&gt; y = pi;
 octave:38&gt; z = 'test';
 octave:39&gt; printf(&quot;%9i\n%9f\n%9s\n&quot;, x, y, z);
        10
  3.141593
      test
Note that in the &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt;, each format specifier contains an integer (9). This tells &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt; to use 9 columns to output the integer, real and string.

The effect of the precision parameter depends on the type of output. It's most obvious use is to specify the number of digits to display after the decimal point of a real number. The precision is specified after the width and is preceded by a dot (&lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt;).
 octave:40&gt; printf(&quot;%9.3f\n&quot;, pi);
     3.142
This displays &amp;pi; using 9 columns and to 3 digits after the decimal point. Note that the number is rounded. For other uses of the precision parameter (e.g. for integers and strings), see the Octave help.

== Outputting matrices ==
When the value passed to the &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt; function is a matrix or vector, all of the values in it are printed. If there is only one format specifier in the format string, it is used for each value in the matrix.
 octave:51&gt; A = [1, 2, 3; 4, 5, 6; 7, 8, 9];
 octave:52&gt; printf(&quot;%i\n&quot;, A)
 1
 4
 7
 2
 5
 8
 3
 6
 9
Note that the values are read from the matrix in column-major order, i.e. all the values from the first column are displayed first, then the second column, etc..

If there is more than one format specifier in the format string, &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt; cycles through them.
 octave:57&gt; printf(&quot;[%i, %.1f, %.2e]\n&quot;, A)
 [1, 4.0, 7.00e+00]
 [2, 5.0, 8.00e+00]
 [3, 6.0, 9.00e+00]
The values are still read in column-major order.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In Octave, a polynomial is represented by its coefficients (arranged in descending order). For example, the vector
 octave:1&gt; p = [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2];
represents the polynomial
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;-2x^4 - x^3 + x + 2.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
You can check this by displaying the polynomial with the function &lt;code&gt;polyout&lt;/code&gt;.
 octave:2&gt; polyout(p, 'x')
 -2*x^4 - 1*x^3 + 0*x^2 + 1*x^1 + 2
The function displays the polynomial in the variable specified (&lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; in this case). Note that the &lt;code&gt;^&lt;/code&gt; means &lt;i&gt;raised to the power of&lt;/i&gt; much like the Octave operator.

== Functions ==
* Evaluating a polynomial:
 y = polyval(p, x)
This returns &lt;math&gt;p(x)&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; is a vector or matrix, the polynomial is evaluated at each of the elements of &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;.

* Multiplication:
 r = conv(p, q)
Here, &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;q&lt;/code&gt; are vectors containing the coefficients of two polynomials and the result, &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt;, will contain the coefficients of their product.

(As an aside, the reason this function is called &lt;code&gt;conv&lt;/code&gt; is that we use vector convolution to do polynomial multiplication.)

* Division:
 [b, r] = deconv(y, a)
This returns the coefficients of the polynomials &lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; such that
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;y = ab + r.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

So, &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; contains the coefficients of the quotient and &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt; the coefficients of the remainder of &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; .

* Root finding:
 roots(p)
This returns a vector containing all the roots of the polynomial with coefficients in &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt;.

* Derivative:
 q = polyder(p)
This returns the coefficients of the derivative of the polynomial whose coefficients are given by vector &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt;.

* Integration:
 q = polyint(p)
This returns the coefficients of the integral of the polynomial whose coefficients are represented by the vector &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt;. The constant of integration is set to 0.

* Data fitting:
 p = polyfit(x, y, n)
This returns the coefficients of a polynomial &lt;math&gt;p(x)&lt;/math&gt; of degree &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; that best fits the data &lt;math&gt;(x_i, y_i)&lt;/math&gt; in the least squares sense.

=== Warning: Adding polynomials ===
Since polynomials are represented by vectors of their coefficients, adding polynomials is not straightforward in Octave. For example, we define the polynomials &lt;math&gt;p(x) = x^2 - 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q(x) = x + 1&lt;/math&gt;.
 octave:1&gt; p = [1, 0, -1];
 octave:2&gt; q = [1, 1];
If we try to add them, we get
 octave:3&gt; p + q
 error: operator +: nonconformant arguments (op1 is 1x3, op2 is 1x2)
 error: evaluating binary operator `+' near line 22, column 3
This happens because Octave is trying to add two vectors (&lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;q&lt;/code&gt;) of different lengths. This operation is not defined. To work around this, you have to add some leading zeroes to &lt;code&gt;q&lt;/code&gt;.
 octave:4&gt; q = [0, 1, 1];
Note that adding leading zeroes does not change the polynomial. Next, we add
 octave:5&gt; p + q
 ans =
 
   1  1  0
 
 octave:6&gt; polyout(ans, 'x')
 1*x^2 + 1*x^1 + 0

      <text xml:space="preserve">Octave can work with gnuplot, Grace, PLplot. Some people deem PLplot is a replacement of the traditional gnuplot in Octave.

== 2D plots ==

 plot(y)
If a single data argument is supplied, it is taken as the set of Y coordinates and the X coordinates are taken to be the indices of the elements, starting with 1.

 plot(x, y)
* If the first argument is a vector and the second is a matrix, the vector is plotted versus the columns (or rows) of the matrix.  (using whichever combination matches, with columns tried first.)
* If the first argument is a matrix and the second is a vector, the columns (or rows) of the matrix are plotted versus the vector.  (using whichever combination matches, with columns tried first.)
* If both arguments are vectors, the elements of Y are plotted versus the elements of X.
* If both arguments are matrices, the columns of Y are plotted versus the columns of X.  In this case, both matrices must have the same number of rows and columns and no attempt is made to transpose the arguments to make the number of rows match.

 linspace(b, l, n)
results in a vector with n linearly spaced numbers between b and l. It is often used to produce the vector X in the two-argument form of plot.

=== Example ===
[[File:Octave_plot_sin.png|thumb]]
&lt;source lang=&quot;matlab&quot;&gt;
x = linspace(0, 2*pi, 100);
y = sin(x);
plot(x, y);

contour

contour (Z)

contour (Z, VN)

contour (X, Y, Z)

contour (X, Y, Z, VN)

contour (..., STYLE)

contour (H, ...)

[C, H] = contour (...)

     Plot level curves (contour lines) of the matrix Z, using the
     contour matrix C computed by `contourc' from the same arguments;
     see the latter for their interpretation.  The set of contour
     levels, C, is only returned if requested.  For example:
          x = 0:2;
          y = x;
          z = x' * y;
          contour (x, y, z, 2:3)
     The style to use for the plot can be defined with a line style
     STYLE in a similar manner to the line styles used with the `plot'
     command.  Any markers defined by STYLE are ignored.
     The optional input and output argument H allows an axis handle to
     be passed to `contour' and the handles to the contour objects to  be returned.

'''contourc'''

[C, LEV] = contourc (X, Y, Z, VN)
     Compute isolines (contour lines) of the matrix Z.  Parameters X, Y
     and VN are optional.
     The return value LEV is a vector of the contour levels.  The
     return value C is a 2 by N matrix containing the contour lines in
     the following format
          C = [lev1, x1, x2, ..., levn, x1, x2, ...
               len1, y1, y2, ..., lenn, y1, y2, ...]
     in which contour line N has a level (height) of LEVN and length of
     LENN.
     If X and Y are omitted they are taken as the row/column index of
     Z.  VN is either a scalar denoting the number of lines to compute
     or a vector containing the values of the lines.  If only one value
     is wanted, set `VN = [val, val]'; If VN is omitted it defaults to
     10.

     For example,
          x = 0:2;
          y = x;
          z = x' * y;
          contourc (x, y, z, 2:3)
               =&gt;   2.0000   2.0000   1.0000   3.0000   1.5000   2.0000

      <comment>/* The for loop */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Loops are used to repeat a block of code for a known or unknown number of times, depending on the type of loop. Using loops, you will draw some nice pictures of fractals and shapes drawn with random dots.

== The &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loop ==
We use &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loops to repeat a block of code for a list of known values. As an example, we'll calculate the mean of a list of values. The mean is calculated from
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\overline{x} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n x_i.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

We set up a vector with some values
 octave:1&gt; x = [1.2, 6.3, 7.8, 3.6];
and calculate the mean with
 octave:2&gt; sum = 0;
 octave:3&gt; for entry = x,
 octave:4&gt;   sum = sum + entry;
 octave:5&gt; end;
 octave:6&gt; x_mean = sum / length(x)

Line 2: Set sum equal to 0.&lt;br /&gt;
Line 3: For each value in x, assign it to entry.&lt;br /&gt;
Line 4: Increment sum by entry.&lt;br /&gt;
Line 5: Ends the for loop when there are no more members of x.&lt;br /&gt;
Line 6: Assign the final value of sum divided by the length of x to x_mean.&lt;br /&gt;

TO DO: get a better example and explain the code.


In general, we write a &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loop as
 for variable = vector
    ...
 end

The &lt;code&gt;...&lt;/code&gt; represents the block of code that is executed exactly once for each value inside the &lt;code&gt;vector&lt;/code&gt;.

=== Example: The Sierpinski triangle ===
The Sierpinski triangle is a fractal that can be generated with a very simple algorithm.
# Start on a vertex of an equilateral triangle.
# Select a vertex of the triangle at random.
# Move to the point halfway between where you are now and the selected vertex.
# Repeat from step 2.

Plotting the points that you visit by following this procedure, generates the following picture.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:sierpinski_m100000.png|thumb|center|500px]]&lt;/center&gt;

You can download the code that generates this fractal from [[http://www.2shared.com/file/0NVALcnP/sierpinski.html 2shared.com]]. Note that this code uses one very simple for loop to generate the fractal:

 for i = 1:N
    ...
 end

=== Exercises ===
#Write a script that sums the first &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; integers. You can check your result with the formula &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}N(N+1)&lt;/math&gt;.
#Write a script that does the same thing as the &lt;code&gt;linspace&lt;/code&gt; function. It should start at some value, &lt;code&gt;xstart&lt;/code&gt;, stop at &lt;code&gt;xstop&lt;/code&gt; and create a vector that contains &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; values evenly spaced from &lt;code&gt;xstart&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;xstop&lt;/code&gt;. You can use the &lt;code&gt;zeros&lt;/code&gt; function to create a zero-filled vector of the right size. Use &lt;code&gt;help zeros&lt;/code&gt; to find out how the function works.

== The &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; loop ==

The while loop also executes a block of code more than once but stops based on a logical condition. For example
 x = 1.0;
 while x &lt; 1000
    disp(x);
    x = x*2;
 endwhile
will multiply &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; by 2 until its value exceeds 1000. Here, &lt;code&gt;x &lt; 1000&lt;/code&gt; is the condition of the loop. As long as the condition holds (is true), the loop will continue executing. As soon as it is false, the loop terminates and the first instruction after the loop is executed.

The general form of a while loop is

 while condition
    ...
 endwhile

=== Exercise ===
#Write a script that calculates the smallest positive integer, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;a^n \ge b&lt;/math&gt; for some real numbers &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;. (Meaning, find the smallest power of &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; that is at least &lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;.) Using the &lt;code&gt;log&lt;/code&gt; function is considered cheating.

=== Example: The Mandelbrot fractal ===

The Mandelbrot set is another fractal and is generated by checking how long it takes a complex number to become large. For each complex number, &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;,

#Start with &lt;math&gt;z_0 = 0&lt;/math&gt;.
#Let &lt;math&gt;z_i = z_{i-1}^2 + c \quad\forall i = 1, 2, \ldots&lt;/math&gt;
#Find the first &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;|z_i| &gt; 2&lt;/math&gt;.

We record all of these &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt; values and assign a colour to each of them. This is used to generate an image like this one.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Mandelbrot.png]]&lt;/center&gt;

You can download the code that generates this fractal from [[Mandelbrot.m]]. Note that there is a while loop (inside some for loops) that tests whether the complex number &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt; has modulus less than 2:

 while (count &lt; maxcount) &amp; (abs(z) &lt; 2)
    ...
 endwhile

The first condition in the while loop checks that we do not perform too many iterations. For some values of &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt; the iteration will go on forever if we let it.

==The &lt;code&gt;do...until&lt;/code&gt; statement==

These loops are very similar to while loops in that they keep executing based on whether a given condition is true or false. There are however some important difference between &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;do...until&lt;/code&gt; loops.
# &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; loops have their conditions at the beginning of the loop;&lt;br&gt;&lt;code&gt;do...until&lt;/code&gt; loops have theirs at the end.
# &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; loops repeat as long as the condition is true;&lt;br&gt;&lt;code&gt;do...until&lt;/code&gt; loops continue as long as theirs is false.
# &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; will execute 0 or more times (because the condition is at the beginning);&lt;br&gt;&lt;code&gt;do...until&lt;/code&gt; loops will execute 1 or more times (since the condition is at the end).

The general form of a &lt;code&gt;do...until&lt;/code&gt; loop is
 do
    ...
 until condition

=== Exercise ===
Write a script that calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive integers. You can do this using Euclid's algorithm.

=== Challenge ===
Write a script that generates random number pairs (a, b) that are distributed uniformly
#over the disc &lt;math&gt;\left\{(x, y) | x^2 + y^2 \le 1\right\}&lt;/math&gt; (the first image below);
#as in the second image below

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Octave_uniform_random_circle.png]] [[Image:Octave uniform random challenge.png]]&lt;/center&gt;

== The &lt;code&gt;break&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;continue&lt;/code&gt; statements ==

Sometimes it is necessary to stop a loop somewhere in the middle of its execution or to move on to the next value in a for loop without executing the rest of the loop code for the current value. This is where the &lt;code&gt;break&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;continue&lt;/code&gt; statements are useful.

The following code demonstrates how the break statement works.

 total = 0;
 while true
    x = input('Value to add (enter 0 to stop): ');
    if x == 0
       break;
    endif
    total = total+x;
    disp(['Total: ', num2str(total)]);
 endwhile

Without the &lt;code&gt;break&lt;/code&gt; statement, the loop would keep executing forever since the condition of the &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; loop is always true. The &lt;code&gt;break&lt;/code&gt; allows you to jump past the end of the loop (to the statement after the endwhile).

The &lt;code&gt;break&lt;/code&gt; statement can be used in any loop: &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;do...until&lt;/code&gt;.

The continue statement also jumps from the inside of a loop but returns to the beginning of the loop rather than going to the end. In a
# &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loop, the next value inside the vector will be assigned to the for variable (if there are any left) and the loop restarted with that value;
# &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; loop, the condition at the beginning of the loop will be retested and the loop continued if it is still true;
# &lt;code&gt;do...until&lt;/code&gt; loop, the condition at the end of the loop will be tested and the loop continued from the beginning if it is still false.

As an example, the following code will fill the lower triangular part of a square matrix with 1s and the rest with 0s.

 N = 5;
 A = zeros(N); % Create an N x N matrix filled with 0s
 
 for row = 1:N
    for column = 1:N
       if column &gt; row
          continue;
       endif
       A(row, column) = 1;
    endfor
 endfor
 
 disp(A);

Note that the inner &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; skips (continues) over the code that assigns a 1 to an entry of &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; whenever the column index is greater than the row index.

== The &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statement ==

The general form of the &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statement is

 if condition1
    ...
 elseif condition2
    ...
 else
    ...
 endif

If &lt;code&gt;condition1&lt;/code&gt; evaluates to true, the statements in the block immediately following the &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; are executed. If &lt;code&gt;condition1&lt;/code&gt; is false, the next condition (&lt;code&gt;condition2&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;elseif&lt;/code&gt;) is checked and its statements executed if it is true. You can have as many &lt;code&gt;elseif&lt;/code&gt; statements as you like. The final set of statements, after the &lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt;, is executed if all of the conditions evaluate to false. Note that the &lt;code&gt;elseif&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt; parts of the &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statement are optional.

The following are all valid &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statements:

 % Take the log of the absolute value of x
 if x &gt; 0
    y = log(x);
 elseif x &lt; 0
    y = log(-x);
 else
    disp(&quot;Cannot take the log of zero.&quot;);
 endif
 
 x = input(&quot;Enter a value: &quot;);
 if x &gt; 0
    disp(&quot;The number is positive&quot;);
 endif
 
 if x &lt; 0
    disp(&quot;The number is negative&quot;);
 endif
 
 if x == 0
    disp(&quot;The number is zero&quot;);
 endif

=== Example: The fractal fern ===

This algorithm is not quite complete. Have a look at the .m file available from http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/loadFile.do?objectId=4372&amp;objectType=file.

The image to the right can be generated with the following algorithm:

   1. Let x1 and y1 be random values between 0 and 1.
   2. Choose one of the linear transformations below to calculate (xi+1, yi+1) from (xi, yi):
         1. xi+1 = 0
            yi+1 = 0.16yi
         2. xi+1 = 0.20xi − 0.26yi
            yi+1 = 0.23xi + 0.22yi + 1.6
         3. xi+1 = −0.15xi + 0.28yi
            yi+1 = 0.26xi + 0.24yi + 0.44
         4. xi+1 = 0.85xi + 0.04yi
            yi+1 = −0.04xi + 0.85yi + 1.6
      The first transformation is chosen if probability 0.01, the second and third with probability 0.07 each and the fourth with probability 0.85.
   3. Calculate these values for i up to at least 10,000.

You can download the code that generates this fractal as fracfern.m (this is disabled for now).

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Syntax==

In Octave, function definitions use the following syntax:
 
 function [return value 1, return value 2, ...] = name( [arg1, arg2, ...] )
     body
 endfunction

==Examples==

The factorial function, which takes exactly one argument and returns one integer, is as follows.

 function result = factorial( n )
     if( n == 0 )
         result = 1;
         return;
     else
         result = prod( 1:n );
     endif
 endfunction


The following function, maxmin, returns the maximum and minimum value of two integers:

 function [max,min] = maxmin( a, b )
    if(a &gt;= b )
         max = a;
         min = b;
         return;
    else
         max = b;
         min = a;
         return;
    endif
 endfunction

To call a function with multiple arguments, you specify multiple variables to hold the results.  For example, one could write:

 [big,small] = maxmin(7,10);

After executing, the variable 'big' would store the value '10' and the variable 'small' would store '7'.  If fewer than two variables are used to hold the result then fewer outputs are returned.  Writing

 a = maxmin(13,5)

would store 13 in the variable 'a', and would discard the value of 5.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Similar to HTML form components, Flash's user interface components let you interact with the users that use your site and gather information.  Examples of such components would be buttons, checkboxes, text fields, and drop-down menus.  The user interface components that exist within Flash 8 are described below:  


'''Accordion:'''  This component is a clickable menu to display different Flash content in the same space-saving frame.  An example of a situation when you would use the accordion component, would be when creating a flash web site that needs various customer forms to process information in an organized way.  The forms would consist of 3 sections of contact information including billing address, personal information such as interests and hobbies, and other information for further descriptions about that specific user.  The accordion will display clickable tabs in which it will display a name that corresponds to that section/form.  So, there would be tabs tiled horizontally for our 3 sections of, contact information, personal information, and other information.  By clicking on the tab to that specific section, a form will display based on that specific link selected within the accordion component.  


'''Alert:'''  This component is similar to that of a JavaScript component that will display a popup window with a message of a detailed alert that usually functions within a form.  The alert component is a pop-up message to communicate to the specific user that is viewing your project.  This is often used as an error function to report invalid content within a form that needs to be changed or typed again. 


'''Button:'''  A button is a clickable region that processes information.  You will usually use the button component when using a form within flash.  If you wish to create a fancier button beyond what the default settings of flash provide, you can simply create a button symbol and modify it that way by using various stages of up, down, hit, and over.


'''Checkbox:'''  This is form component used to allow the user to select multiple options within a field or question.  For example if you were filling out a form at a Doctor's office that needed information on past illnesses and surgeries and a list was given to you of various things you could have went through.  The user would be able to check off the ones that apply to them.  


'''ComboBox:'''  This component is exactly the same as a drop down menu provided by most user interfaces when selecting one specific option out of a list of options.


'''DataGrid:'''  Think of this component as a table of rows and columns that displays data.  You would usually this component when you want to transfer data from your server and display it in a flash table form.  However, you could also use this to collect local data gathered by local forms within a flash project.  


'''DateChooser:'''  This component is basically a clickable calendar in which the user can select a date without guessing the format it should be in and type from scratch.  This saves all the time for date processing, wither its a news post, a date of an important event, or a birthday.  This component comes in hand when, for example, you’re putting together an online event scheduler and you want people to be able to click different dates to see a list of the vents scheduled for that date.  


'''DateField:'''  This is a combination of a the above component  of a &quot;Date Chooser&quot; and a &quot;text field&quot;, the Date Field component visually reinforces a person's choice by filling a text field with the date he/she selects.   For example, if a calendar is displayed with clickable links of the dates within that month, somewhere around that calendar will be text fields that will display the actually date you selected within that calendar.  


'''Label:'''  This component let you add a single line of no editable, no clickable text to your flash project.  This is commonly used as a short description tool to name fields or large bodies of text.  


'''List:'''  You would use the list component to create a clickable, scrollable list form which someone can &quot;Shift + Click&quot; to select multiple options.  This component is fairly close to the &quot;Combo Box&quot; component except the available options can be selected within a window instead of a drop down and multiple selections can be made.  


'''Loader:'''  A loader component is a no scrollable window that lets you display an animation or bitmap image along with your main animation.  By customizing the Loader component, you can show the animation or bitmap full-size or modify it to match the Loader dimensions you set.  


'''Menu:'''  This component is very useful if you’re creating a full-fledged program in flash and want to let your audience navigate your program by choosing from familiar drop-down menus.  The menus you create using the menu component are similar in style and function to the file and edit menus in flash , although you do have to have quite a bit of Action Script knowledge to customize and use them.  


'''MenuBar:'''  The menu bar component is a horizontal navigation bar of clickable buttons.  This component's handy if, for example, you're creating a complex web site in flash you want to display an identical, space-saving menu bar at the top of each page.  Basically it's a navigational component that you can customize and use in multiple instances.  


'''NumericStepper:'''  You would use this component to create clickable list of numbers.  This is a simpler way for people to use than a type-in-your-own-numbers text field.  This component makes it easy for you to limit your audience's choices to predefined set of valid numbers.  


'''ProgressBar:'''  The horizontal Progress Bar component is a visual indicator of how long flash expects to take to complete a process.  This can be used as a loader screen when loading your flash project and its various components.  This is a great component to create from scratch and customize with a loader bar animation.  


'''RadioButton:'''  This is a combination of a few components that have already been discussed such as the Combo Box and the Checkbox component.  A list of items or displayed in a list and a circular button is presented next to that data to select only one option within that list.  Its displayed like a Checkbox, but used like a Combo Box where only one selection can be made.  


'''ScrollPane:'''  Similar to the Loader component, the Scroll Pane component lets you include an additional animation or bitmap image in your main animation.  But, unlike the Loader component, the Scroll Pane component includes scrollbars that the user can use to control the content they see.  


'''TextArea:'''  The Text Area component is a multi-line, scrollable text field that's useful when you want your audience to be able to type a long comment, or any other information longer than a few words.  


'''TextInput:'''  This component lets you create a single-line text field.  Using this component lets you give your audience a freeform text field just long enough to type what you want them to type.  This is a good idea to use when making short input forms such as, name, phone, and email address.  


'''Tree:'''  Similar to the List component, the Tree component displays information in a hierarchical fashion.  This component’s useful if, for example, you're creating a complex web site and you want to add a site map option that shows your audience the categorical view of your site, from the home page down.  


'''UIScrollBar:'''  The UIScrollBar component is a fancy, color-customizable scrollbar you can add to a Text Input or Text Area field to make your text field’s math your overall color scheme.
 

'''Window:'''  The window component is a movable, titled window to display an animation or a bitmap file.  You might want to use this when you’re creating a tutorial in flash you want to display each how-to animation in separate windows so that your audience can reposition each window and close it easily when they're ready to move on to the next topic.

== The IO Library ==

The IO Library (available by &lt;tt&gt;'''import'''&lt;/tt&gt;ing the &lt;code&gt;System.IO&lt;/code&gt; module)
contains many definitions, the most commonly used of which are listed below:

&lt;pre&gt;
data IOMode  = ReadMode   | WriteMode
             | AppendMode | ReadWriteMode

openFile     :: FilePath -&gt; IOMode -&gt; IO Handle
hClose       :: Handle -&gt; IO ()

hIsEOF       :: Handle -&gt; IO Bool

hGetChar     :: Handle -&gt; IO Char
hGetLine     :: Handle -&gt; IO String
hGetContents :: Handle -&gt; IO String

getChar      :: IO Char
getLine      :: IO String
getContents  :: IO String

hPutChar     :: Handle -&gt; Char -&gt; IO ()
hPutStr      :: Handle -&gt; String -&gt; IO ()
hPutStrLn    :: Handle -&gt; String -&gt; IO ()

putChar      :: Char -&gt; IO ()
putStr       :: String -&gt; IO ()
putStrLn     :: String -&gt; IO ()

readFile     :: FilePath -&gt; IO String
writeFile    :: FilePath -&gt; String -&gt; IO ()

{- bracket must be imported from Control.Exception -}
bracket      ::
    IO a -&gt; (a -&gt; IO b) -&gt; (a -&gt; IO c) -&gt; IO c
&lt;/pre&gt;
{{body note|1=

The type &lt;code&gt;FilePath&lt;/code&gt; is a ''type synonym'' for &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;.  That is, there is no difference between &lt;code&gt;FilePath&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;.  So, for instance, the &lt;code&gt;readFile&lt;/code&gt; function takes a &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; (the file to read) and returns an action that, when run, produces the contents of that file.  See the section [[../../Type declarations/]] for more about type synonyms.
}}
Most of these functions are self-explanatory.  The &lt;code&gt;openFile&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;hClose&lt;/code&gt; functions open and close a file, respectively, using the &lt;code&gt;IOMode&lt;/code&gt; argument as the mode for opening the file.  &lt;code&gt;hIsEOF&lt;/code&gt; tests for end-of file.  &lt;code&gt;hGetChar&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;hGetLine&lt;/code&gt; read a character or line (respectively) from a file.  &lt;code&gt;hGetContents&lt;/code&gt; reads the entire file.  The &lt;code&gt;getChar&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;getLine&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;getContents&lt;/code&gt; variants read from standard input.  &lt;code&gt;hPutChar&lt;/code&gt; prints a character to a file; &lt;code&gt;hPutStr&lt;/code&gt; prints a string; and &lt;code&gt;hPutStrLn&lt;/code&gt; prints a string with a newline character at the end. The variants without the &lt;code&gt;h&lt;/code&gt; prefix work on standard output.  The &lt;code&gt;readFile&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;writeFile&lt;/code&gt; functions read and write an entire file without
having to open it first.

The &lt;code&gt;bracket&lt;/code&gt; function is used to perform actions safely.  Consider a function that opens a file, writes a character to it, and then closes the file.  When writing such a function, one needs to be
careful to ensure that, if there were an error at some point, the file is still successfully closed.  The &lt;code&gt;bracket&lt;/code&gt; function makes this easy.  It takes three arguments: The first is the action to perform at the beginning.  The second is the action to perform at the end, regardless of whether there's an error or not.  The third is the action to perform in the middle, which might result in an error.  For
instance, our character-writing function might look like:

&lt;pre&gt;
writeChar :: FilePath -&gt; Char -&gt; IO ()
writeChar fp c =
    bracket
      (openFile fp WriteMode)
      hClose
      (\h -&gt; hPutChar h c)
&lt;/pre&gt;
This will open the file, write the character and then close the file. However, if writing the character fails, &lt;code&gt;hClose&lt;/code&gt; will still be executed, and the exception will be reraised afterwards.  That way, you don't need to worry too much about catching the exceptions and about closing all of your handles.

== A File Reading Program ==

We can write a simple program that allows a user to read and write
files.  The interface is admittedly poor, and it does not catch all
errors (such as reading a non-existent file).  Nevertheless, it should
give a fairly complete example of how to use IO.  Enter the following
code into &quot;FileRead.hs,&quot; and compile/run:

&lt;pre&gt;
module Main
    where

import System.IO
import Control.Exception

main = doLoop

doLoop = do
  putStrLn &quot;Enter a command rFN wFN or q to quit:&quot;
  command &lt;- getLine
  case command of
    'q':_ -&gt; return ()
    'r':filename -&gt; do putStrLn (&quot;Reading &quot; ++ filename)
                       doRead filename
                       doLoop
    'w':filename -&gt; do putStrLn (&quot;Writing &quot; ++ filename)
                       doWrite filename
                       doLoop
    _            -&gt; doLoop

doRead filename =
    bracket (openFile filename ReadMode) hClose
            (\h -&gt; do contents &lt;- hGetContents h
                      putStrLn &quot;The first 100 chars:&quot;
                      putStrLn (take 100 contents))

doWrite filename = do
  putStrLn &quot;Enter text to go into the file:&quot;
  contents &lt;- getLine
  bracket (openFile filename WriteMode) hClose
          (\h -&gt; hPutStrLn h contents)
&lt;/pre&gt;
What does this program do?  First, it issues a short string of
instructions and reads a command.  It then performs a &lt;tt&gt;'''case'''&lt;/tt&gt; switch
on the command and checks first to see if the first character is a
`q.'  If it is, it returns a value of unit type.

{{body note|1=
The &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; function is a function that takes a value of type
&lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; and returns an action of type &lt;code&gt;IO a&lt;/code&gt;.  Thus, the type of
&lt;code&gt;return ()&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;IO ()&lt;/code&gt;.
}}
If the first character of the command wasn't a `q,' the program checks
to see if it was an 'r' followed by some string that is bound to the
variable &lt;code&gt;filename&lt;/code&gt;.  It then tells you that it's reading the file,
does the read and runs &lt;code&gt;doLoop&lt;/code&gt; again.  The check for `w' is
nearly identical.  Otherwise, it matches &lt;code&gt;_&lt;/code&gt;, the wildcard
character, and loops to &lt;code&gt;doLoop&lt;/code&gt;.

The &lt;code&gt;doRead&lt;/code&gt; function uses the &lt;code&gt;bracket&lt;/code&gt; function to make sure
there are no problems reading the file.  It opens a file in
&lt;code&gt;ReadMode&lt;/code&gt;, reads its contents and prints the first 100 characters
(the &lt;code&gt;take&lt;/code&gt; function takes an integer &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and a list and returns
the first &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; elements of the list).

The &lt;code&gt;doWrite&lt;/code&gt; function asks for some text, reads it from the
keyboard, and then writes it to the file specified.

{{body note|1=
Both &lt;code&gt;doRead&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;doWrite&lt;/code&gt; could have been made simpler by
using &lt;code&gt;readFile&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;writeFile&lt;/code&gt;, but they were written in the
extended fashion to show how the more complex functions are used.
}}
The only major problem with this program is that it will die if you
try to read a file that doesn't already exists or if you specify some
bad filename like &lt;code&gt;*\bs^#_@&lt;/code&gt;.  You may think that the calls
to &lt;code&gt;bracket&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;doRead&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;doWrite&lt;/code&gt; should take care of
this, but they don't.  They only catch exceptions within the main
body, not within the startup or shutdown functions (&lt;code&gt;openFile&lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;code&gt;hClose&lt;/code&gt;, in these cases).  We would need to catch exceptions raised
by &lt;code&gt;openFile&lt;/code&gt;, in order to make this complete.  We will do this
when we talk about exceptions in more detail in
the section on [[../Io advanced#Exceptions|Exceptions]].


{{Exercises|1=
Write a program that first asks whether the user wants to read from a
file, write to a file or quit.  If the user responds quit, the program
should exit.  If he responds read, the program should ask him for a
file name and print that file to the screen (if the file doesn't
exist, the program may crash).  If he responds write, it should ask
him for a file name and then ask him for text to write to the file,
with &quot;.&quot;  signaling completion.  All but the &quot;.&quot; should be written
to the file.

For example, running this program might produce:

&lt;pre&gt;
Do you want to [read] a file, [write] a file or [quit]?
read
Enter a file name to read:
foo
...contents of foo...
Do you want to [read] a file, [write] a file or [quit]?
write
Enter a file name to write:
foo
Enter text (dot on a line by itself to end):
this is some
text for
foo
.
Do you want to [read] a file, [write] a file or [quit]?
read
Enter a file name to read:
foo
this is some
text for
foo
Do you want to [read] a file, [write] a file or [quit]?
blech
I don't understand the command blech.
Do you want to [read] a file, [write] a file or [quit]?
quit
Goodbye!
&lt;/pre&gt;
}}

== Another way of reading files ==

Sometimes (for example in parsers) we need to open a file from command line, by typing &quot;program.exe input.in&quot; . Of course, we could just use &quot;&lt; &quot; to redirect standard input, but we can do it in more elegant way. We could do this like that:

&lt;pre&gt;
-- $ runghc program input
-- Input interpreted
{-# LANGUAGE ScopedTypeVariables #-}
module Main where

import System.IO
import System.Environment (getArgs)
import System.Exit 
import Data.List (isSuffixOf) 
import qualified Control.Exception as Err

parse fname str = str 

main :: IO()
main = do 
    arguments &lt;- getArgs
    if length arguments == 0 
    then putStrLn &quot;No input file given.\n Proper way of running program is: \n program input.in&quot;
    else do
        let suffix = if isSuffixOf &quot;.in&quot; (head arguments) then &quot;&quot; else &quot;.in&quot; 
-- Using this trick will allow users to type &quot;program input&quot; as well
        handle &lt;- Err.catch (openFile (head arguments ++ suffix) ReadMode) 
            (\(e::Err.IOException) -&gt; error $ show e)                                           
        readable &lt;- hIsReadable handle
        if not readable
        then error &quot;File is being used by another user or program&quot;
        else do
            unparsedString &lt;- hGetContents handle
            case parse (head arguments) unparsedString of
{-This is how it would look like, when our parser was based on Parsec
                Left err -&gt; error $ show err  
                Right program -&gt; do
                    outcome &lt;- interprete program
                    case outcome of 
                        Abort -&gt; do
                            putStrLn &quot;Program aborted&quot;
                            exitWith $ ExitFailure 1
                        _ -&gt; do 
                            putStrLn &quot;Input interpreted&quot;
                            exitWith ExitSuccess
But to make this example less complicated I replaced these lines with:-}
                        unparsedString -&gt; do
                            putStrLn &quot;Input interpreted&quot;
                            exitWith ExitSuccess                                          

&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Component Mass Balance ==

Most processes, of course, involve more than one input and/or output, and therefore it must be learned how to perform mass balances on . The basic idea remains the same though. We can write a mass balance in the same form as the overall balance for each component:

&lt;math&gt; In - Out + Generation = Accumulation &lt;/math&gt;

For '''steady state''' processes, this becomes:

&lt;math&gt; In - Out + generation = 0
 &lt;/math&gt;

The '''overall''' mass balance at steady state, recall, is:

&lt;math&gt; \Sigma\dot{m}_{in} - \Sigma\dot{m}_{out} + m_{gen} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

The mass of each component can be described by a similar balance.

&lt;math&gt; \Sigma\dot{m}_{A,in} - \Sigma\dot{m}_{A,out} + {m}_{A,gen} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

The biggest difference between these two equations is that ''' The total generation of mass &lt;math&gt; m_{gen} &lt;/math&gt; is zero due to conservation of mass, but since individual species can be consumed in a reaction, &lt;math&gt; {m}_{A,gen} \neq 0 &lt;/math&gt; for a reacting system'''

== Concentration Measurements ==

You may recall from general chemistry that a '''concentration''' is a measure of the amount of some species in a mixture relative to the total amount of material, or relative to the amount of another species. Several different measurements of concentration come up over and over, so they were given special names. 


=== Molarity ===

The first  major concentration unit is the '''molarity''' which relates the moles of one particular species to the total volume of the solution.

&lt;math&gt; Molarity(A)= [A] = \frac{n_A}{V_{sln}} &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; n \dot= mol, V \dot= L&lt;/math&gt;

A more useful definition for flow systems that is equally valid is:

{{box|
&lt;math&gt; [A] = \frac{\dot{n}_A}{\dot{V}_{n}} &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; \dot{n}_A \dot= mol/s, \dot{V}_{n} \dot= L/s &lt;/math&gt;
}}

Molarity is a useful measure of concentration because it takes into account the volumetric changes that can occur when one creates a mixture from pure substances. Thus it is a very practical unit of concentration. However, since it involves volume, it can change with temperature so ''molarity should always be given at a specific temperature''. Molarity of a gaseous mixture can also change with pressure, so it is not usually used for gasses.

=== Mole Fraction ===

The '''mole fraction''' is one of the most useful units of concentration, since it allows one to directly determine the molar flow rate of any component from the total flow rate. It also conveniently is ''always'' between 0 and 1, which is a good check on your work as well as an additional equation that you can always use to help you solve problems.

The mole fraction of a component A in a mixture is defined as:

&lt;math&gt; x_A = \frac{n_A}{n_{n}} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; n_A &lt;/math&gt; signifies moles of A. Like molarity, a definition in terms of flowrates is also possible:

{{box|'''Mole Fraction Definition''' &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt; x_A = \frac{\dot{n}_A}{\dot{n}_{n}} &lt;/math&gt; }}

If you add up all mole fractions in a mixture, you should always obtain 1 (within calculation and measurement error), because sum of individual component flow rates equals the total flow rate:

{{box|
&lt;math&gt; \Sigma x_i = 1 &lt;/math&gt;}}

Note that '''each stream has its own independent set of concentrations'''. This fact will become important when you are performing mass balances.

=== Mass Fraction ===

Since mass is a more practical property to measure than moles, flowrates are often given as ''mass'' flowrates rather than ''molar'' flowrates. When this occurs, it is convenient to express concentrations in terms of '''mass fractions''' defined similarly to mole fractions.

In most texts mass fraction is given the same notation as mole fraction, and which one is meant is explicitly stated in the equations that are used or the data given. 

{{NOTE|In this book, '''assume that a percent concentration has the same units as the total flowrate unless stated otherwise'''. So if a flowrate is given in kg/s, and a composition is given as &quot;30%&quot;, assume that it is 30% by mass.}}

The definition of a mass fraction is similar to that of moles:

&lt;math&gt; x_A = \frac{m_A}{m_{n}} &lt;/math&gt; for batch systems

{{box|'''Mass fraction of Continuous Systems''' &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt; x_A = \frac{\dot{m}_A}{\dot{m}_{n}} &lt;/math&gt;}}

where &lt;math&gt; m_A &lt;/math&gt; is the mass of A. It doesn't matter what the units of the mass are as long as they are the same as the units of the total mass of solution.

Like the mole fraction, the total mass fraction in any stream should always add up to 1.

{{box|
&lt;math&gt; \Sigma x_i = 1 &lt;/math&gt;}}

== Calculations on Multi-component streams ==

Various conversions must be done with multiple-component streams just as they must for single-component streams. This section shows some methods to combine the properties of single-component streams into something usable for multiple-component streams(with some assumptions).
 
=== Average Molecular Weight ===

The ''average molecular weight'' of a mixture (gas or liquid) is the multicomponent equivalent to the molecular weight of a pure species. It allows you to convert between the mass of a mixture and the number of moles, which is important for reacting systems especially because balances must usually be done in moles, but measurements are generally in grams.

To find the value of &lt;math&gt; \bar{MW}_n = \frac{g\mbox{ sln}}{mole\mbox{ sln}} &lt;/math&gt;, we split the solution up into its components as follows, for k components:

&lt;math&gt; \frac{g\mbox{ sln}}{mole\mbox{ sln}} = \frac{\Sigma{m_i}}{n_n} = \Sigma \frac{m_i}{n_n} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; = \Sigma(\frac{m_i}{n_i}*\frac{n_i}{n_n}) = \Sigma(MW_i*x_i)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; x_i &lt;/math&gt; is the '''mole fraction''' of component i in the mixture. Therefore, we have the following formula:

{{box|
&lt;math&gt; \bar{MW}_n = \Sigma(MW_i*x_i)_n &lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; x_i &lt;/math&gt; is the mole fraction of component i in the mixture.}}

This derivation only assumes that '''mass is additive''', which it is, so this equation is valid for ''any'' mixture.

=== Density of Liquid Mixtures ===

Let us attempt to calculate the density of a liquid mixture from the density of its components, similar to how we calculated the average molecular weight. This time, however, we will notice one critical difference in the assumptions we have to make. We'll also notice that there are '''two''' different equations we could come up with, depending on the assumptions we make.

==== First Equation ====

By definition, the density of a single component i is: &lt;math&gt; {\rho}_i = \frac{m_i}{V_i} &lt;/math&gt; The corresponding definition for a solution is &lt;math&gt; \rho = \frac{m\mbox{ sln}}{V\mbox{ sln}} &lt;/math&gt;. Following a similar derivation to the above for average molecular weight:

&lt;math&gt; \frac{m\mbox{ sln}}{V\mbox{ sln}} = \frac{\Sigma{m_i}}{V_{n}} = \Sigma \frac{m_i}{V_{n}} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; = \Sigma \frac{m_i}{V_i} * \frac{V_i}{V_n}  = \Sigma ({\rho}_i * \frac{V_i}{V_n}) &lt;/math&gt;

Now we make the assumption that '''The volume of the solution is proportional to the mass'''. This is true for any pure substance (the proportionality constant is the density), but it is further assumed that '''the proportionality constant is the same for both pure k and the solution'''. This equation is therefore useful for two substances with similar pure densities. If this is true then:

&lt;math&gt; \frac{V_i}{V} = \frac{m_i}{m_n} = x_i &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; x_i &lt;/math&gt; is the '''mass fraction''' of component i. Thus:

{{box|
&lt;math&gt; {\rho}_{n} = \Sigma{(x_i*{\rho}_i)}_n &lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; x_i &lt;/math&gt; is the '''mass fraction''' (not the mole fraction) of component i in the mixture.}}

==== Second Equation ====

This equation is easier to derive if we assume the equation will have a form similar to that of average molar mass. Since density is given in terms of mass, it makes sense to start by using the definition of '''mass fractions''':

&lt;math&gt; x_i = \frac{m_i}{m_{n}} &lt;/math&gt; 

To get this in terms of only ''solution'' properties (and not ''component'' properties), we need to get rid of &lt;math&gt; m_i &lt;/math&gt;. We do this first by dividing by the density:

&lt;math&gt; \frac{x_i}{{\rho}_i} = \frac{m_i}{m_{n}}*\frac{V_i}{m_i} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; = \frac{V_i}{m_{n}} &lt;/math&gt;

Now if we add all of these up we obtain:

&lt;math&gt; \Sigma(\frac{x_i}{{\rho}_i}) = \frac{\Sigma{V_i}}{m_{n}} &lt;/math&gt;

Now we have to make an assumption, and it's different from that in the first case. This time we assume that the '''Volumes are additive'''. This is true in two cases:

1. In an '''ideal solution'''. The idea of an ideal solution will be explained more later, but for now you need to know that ideal solutions:
* Tend to involve similar compounds in solution with each other, or when one component is so dilute that it doesn't effect the solution properties much.
* Include Ideal Gas mixtures at constant temperature and pressure.
2 In a '''Completely immiscible nonreacting mixture'''. In other words, if two substances don't mix at all (like oil and water, or if you throw a rock into a puddle), the total volume will not change when you mix them. And the total volume in this case will be sum of volume of individual components.

If the solution is ideal, then we can write:

&lt;math&gt; \frac{\Sigma \dot{V}_i}{\dot{m}_{n}} = \frac{\dot{V}_{n}}{\dot{m}_{n}} = \frac{1}{{\rho}_{n}} &lt;/math&gt;

Hence, for an ideal solution,

{{box|
&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{{\rho}_{n}} = \Sigma(\frac{x_i}{{\rho}_i})_n &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; x_i &lt;/math&gt; is the '''mass fraction''' of component i in the mixture.}}

Note that this is significantly different from the previous equation! This equation is more accurate for most cases. In all cases, however, it is most accurate to look up the value in a handbook such as Perry's Chemical Engineers Handbook if data is available on the solution of interest.

Edward VI

For more than a quarter century King Henry VIII had desperately wanted a son, and Edward's birth caused great rejoicing. The prince was baptized in a splendorous cermony in the chapel oh Hampton Court palace. But Queen Jane soon fell ill with childbed fever, and on Oct 24 she died.

Until the age of six Edward was raised by his nurse, Mother Jack, and other servants. During that time Henry took two wives in quick succession, but both marriages ended badly; Anne of Cleves was discarded because the King found her ugly, and Catherine Howard was executed for adultery. In 1543 Henry married Catherine Parr, who became a loving stepmother to Edward and his older half sisters, Mary and Elizabeth. She was a highly learned woman who personally oversaw Prince Edward's education.

Edward's tutors taught him geography, government, history, French, German, Greek, and Latin. He was also given lessons in etiquette, fencing, horseback riding, music and other gentlemanly pursuits. The King arranged for a privileged group of fourteen well-born children to share his education, and thus envolved an exclusive palace school. Edward´s companion included Henry Brandon, the young Duke of Suffolk; Henry, Lord Hastings; Robert Dudley; Henry Sidney; and possibly even another cousin, Lady Jane Grey. The Prince favorite companion seems to have been Barnaby Fitzpatick, a cousin of the Earl of Ormonde (when Edward became King Barnaby was appointed to the unenviable port of royal whipping boy, which meant that he had to suffer the punishments that their governors would not dare to administer to the Lord´s Anointed, their sovereign).

Although Edward was serious and studious, at times he displayed a savage temper. Reginald Pole, later Archbishop of Canterbury, heard from people that, in front of his tutors, the young King, in a fit of anger, tore a living falcon into four pieces.

Because Elizabeth was only four years his senior, Edward was naturally closer to her than to Mary. His letters to her were warm and affectionate.

Henry VIII died in 1547 and his nine-year-old son became King Edward VI. A council was appointed by his father to rule during his minority. But Edward's uncle, the Edward Seymour, lord Hertford (Jane Seymour's brother), wanted to be Protector of the country and the King.

He entrusted Sir William Paget with the safe-keeping of King Henry´s will, and had no intention of showing it to anyone else until he had taken possession of the person of the new King and brought him to London. Hertford wasted no time; he left Whitehall with Sir Anthony Browne and galloped to Ashdrige, where Edward was staying. They decided that it would be better to take the Prince to Enfield so that he could be with his sister Elizabeth when the news of their father´s death was broken to them. Hertford announced the death of their royal father in the presence chamber of Enfield, and made formal obeisance on his knees to Edward as King. Both children burst into uncontrollable sobs, which were so heart-rending that their servants were soon crying too. So long did their lamentations continue that the Earl and his attendants became concerned, but at lenght Edward and Elizabeth calmed themselves. Already a change was taking place, as both became conscious of their altered roles in life. Never again would they be so close.

On 17 Feb 1547 Edward VI was knighted by Hertford, who was himself created Duke of Somerset and Earl Marshall (an office vacant as a result of the Duke of Norfolk imprisonment). At the same time, John Dudley, Viscount Lisle, was created Earl of Warwick.

Somerset's brother, Lord High Admiral Thomas Seymour, was jealous of Somerset and schemed to put himself in power.

Edward had been easing the Admiral out of his life and when the Admiral tried for a late-night visit (armed with a pistol of all things) he shot the King's small dog.  That was it for Seymour.  Very few in the world would forgive the murder of a beloved pet.

Thomas Seymour played Edward VI for a fool, counting on the young king's continuing good will and the fact that he was a favoured uncle.  Edward was showing signs of becoming independent and more self-reliant; he was the King and he knew it.

Edward VI was moving from child to man, and was starting to see things in that light.  For Thomas' part, he was so busy trying to undermine his older brother that he never realized that the King himself would prove his undoing.

The Admiral was arrested and charged with treason. Somerset hesitated to sign his

See her at The Queen Gallery

Lady Jane's father was Henry Grey, third Marquess of Dorset, the son of Thomas Grey, second Marquess of Dorset. In 1530 he took possession of Bradgate, a mansion which combined the amenities of a hunting-palace with the comforts of a private villa. The birthplace of Jane and her sisters overlooked six miles of park and is situated five miles from the city of Leicester. A rather uncertain and hazardous existence at court and in the French wars, alternating with abortive intrigue for further favours, had given Dorset ambition without stability of purpose. He had competed for wealth and position with only moderate success. In these days of the rising &quot;new men&quot; he counted himself to the old nobility: for his grandfather, the first Marquess, was the son of Elizabeth Woodville and therefore the stepson of Edward IV, Henry VIII's maternal grandfather.

Three years after he succeeded, young Dorset married Frances Brandon in the chapel of his London house in Southwark. This lady's ancestry combined royal and middle-class blood and, from her husband's point of view, her kinship with the King was of incalculable value; its results were to prove fatal to every member of the family but herself.

Frances Brandon was the elder daughter of Charles Brandon Duke of Suffolk (a country gentleman ennobled by Henry VIII) and Henry's younger sister, Mary Tudor, formerly Queen of France, whose marriage to Louis XII lasted three months, leaving her free to give her hand to Suffolk as soon as her period of mourning was over. This young man, Lady Jane's maternal grandfather, was an extremely shady character. He had divorced two wives and buried a third before he married the Queen Dowager, by whom he had two daughters, Frances and Eleanor. In 1533 Mary died and about two years later, in 1535, Brandon married a fifth wife, Lady Catherine Willoughby, B. d'Eresby, by whom he had two sons.

By that time Frances and Henry Grey had been married two years and she had borne him a son who died a few months later; a daughter followed, who also died. Lady Jane was born in the same year and the same month - the exact date in Oct 1537 is not recorded - as Edward VI, Henry's son by his third wife, Jane Seymour. Although the Dorsets were disappointed at not having a son, they had important plans for Jane. From their point of view, the dynastic situation was promising, and they were bent on getting the most out of it.

Edward VI, who was to succeed Henry VIII in 1547 at the age of nine, was regarded by many and possibly by Henry himself as his only rightful heir; for his half-sisters, Mary and Elizabeth, had both been declared illegitimate. Some years before Henry died he caused Parliament to pass an Act which enabled him to leave the crown by will and thus, if he saw fit, to cut out his two daughters. In fact, he did not do so. In his will he left the crown to Edward, Mary and Elizabeth, in that order. In the event of none of them having any heirs the succession came to Frances Dorset and her children, and then to her younger sister Eleanor, and hers. So in 1547 Jane was, presumptively, fifth in line for the English throne. (Henry cut out the descendants of his elder sister, Margaret Queen of Scotland, for reasons that have never been explained. But his war with Scotland and the Franco-Scottish alliance may have been the cause).

Jane's parents brought her up, not only with the rather remote possibility of her becoming Queen Regnant in view, but also with the idea that she might marry her Cousin Prince Edward - for althoug Henry VIII was negociating a foreign alliance for him within a few months of his birth, none of these schemes materialized. And so, during the last years of Henry's reign, the Dorsets' hopes for Jane rose very high, and her education was conducted accordingly. Intellectually, she was trained as if she had been a boy; but her parents' treatement of her destroyed much of the happiness she might have derived from such a training; for Frances Dorset was a harsh, grasping, brutal woman who dominated her capricious husband. That these characteristics were shown comparatively early is proved by her attitude towards Jane and her sisters - Catherine was born in 1539 and Mary four years later - whose sex she could not forgive.

It was inevitable that such a woman should rule, even if discreetly, the husband whom his contemporaries described as &quot;young, lusty and poor...with little or no experience&quot; and &quot;a senseless creature&quot;, although others praised his love of learning, his generosity and his lack of pride. But Dorset was as casually selfish as his wife was cunning and predatory; and their care for their daughters' education sprang, not from aesthetic or intellectual standards, but from their obsession with material advantages and a desire to be in fashion. Frances ambitions were political, and her temperament was that of a restless, permanently dissatisfied schemer. She was constantly on the move, in order to keep in touch with

Kavrayskiy VII, according to [http://www.physics.drexel.edu/~goldberg/projections/ D. Goldberg]:

&lt;math&gt;x = \frac{3 \lambda}{2\pi} \sqrt{\frac{\pi^2}{3} - \phi^2}&lt;/math&gt;

You get to pick k, it's usually taken to be something like 1.2.

Mary Tudor was  the only surviving child of Henry VIII's first wife, Catalina De Aragon. Henry doted on Mary when she was little, calling her &quot;the greatest pearl in the kingdom.&quot; The princess received an excellent education, and was carefully sheltered.In 1522 Henry arranged Mary's betrothal to Holy Roman Emperor Carlos V. Carlos was an adult, and Mary was just six years old; the marriage would take place when she was twelve. Mary had met Carlos and liked the idea of marrying him. But in 1525 Carlos broke off the engagement so that he could marry Princess Isabella of Portugal. That same year Henry sent Princess Mary to live in Wales, as was traditional for the king's heir. But at the same time, her half brother, the bastard son of the King Henry Fitzroy, was created Duke of Richmond, a title that Henry had before he came to the throne.The year 1527 started off well for Princess Mary. She returned to live at her father's court and celebrated her engagement to a son of the King of France. But Henry VIII's attitude toward Mary and her mother had started to change. He had decided that God disapproved of his marriage to Catalina; why else had the Queen failed to produce healthy male children? And he was in love with the woman who was to become his second wife: Anne Boleyn. Soon Mary learned that Henry wanted to annul his marriage to her mother. For this, the King needed the pope's permission. While he waited, he continued to treat Catalina as his Queen and Mary as his heir. But Mary's legitimacy was now in doubt, making her less valuable on the marriage market. The French engagement was broken off and no other match was arranged for her, although her father's advisors considered marrying her to Henry's illegitimate son, Henry Fitzroy.Henry grew increasingly angry at Catalina for resisting his attempt to end their marriage. Finally, in 1531, he sent Catalina away from court. After being shuffled between various castles and palaces, the Queen ended up a prisoner at Kimbolton Castle, near Huntingdon. Realizing that the Pope would never grant his divorce, Henry split from the Catholic church, established the Church of England, had his marriage declared invalid, and married Anne Boleyn. Anne gave birth to a daughter, Princess Elizabeth, in 1533. Mary was now officially a bastard, called &quot;the lady Mary,&quot; but, like her mother, she refused to accept her change in status. Henry was infuriated by his daughter's defiance and threatened to have her executed if she did not stop referring to herself as a princess. When Mary was eighteen, her household was disbanded and she was sent to live in Princess Elizabeth's household, where she was treated badly. Henry refused to see her, but he was not completely indifferent to Mary. Once, glimpsing her at a window, he nodded and touched his hat politely.Catalina and Mary were not permitted to visit each other, and Catalina died in 1536 without seeing her daughter again. Now Mary was alone. Four months after Catalina's death, however, Mary's greatest enemy toppled from power when Anne Boleyn was arrested on false charges of adultery and executed. Anne had hated Mary and stated that she wanted her dead. With Anne gone, Henry treated his eldest daughter somewhat more kindly. His third, fourth, and sixth wives were all well-disposed toward Mary. (She got along less well with his teenaged fifth wife, Catherine Howard.) Although she never regained her former status or her father's affection, she was once again part of the royal family.

Elizabeth Tudor was born on 7 Sep 1533 at Greenwich to Henry VIII and his second wife, Anne Boleyn. Elizabeth's life was troubled from the moment she was born. Henry VIII had changed the course of his country's history in order to marry Anne, hoping that she would bear him the strong and healthy son that Catalina de Aragon never did.


After her christening, Elizabeth spent her first weeks in the royal nurseries, tended by her wet-nurse, her dry nurses the women who rocked her cradle and the women who did her laundry. When she was three months old, she was given her own household, as etiquette required, and on a cold, mid-december afternoon she was carried out to a richly decorated litter and taken in procession through the streets of London, escorted by her great-uncle, the Duke of Norfolk. They stopped at Lord Rutland´s house in Enfield for the night, and the next morning they went on to the palace of Hatfield, in Hertfordshire, which was to be her home.

As soon as he had seen the baby safely settled in her crimson satin cradle, Norfolk rode off to Essex on an embarassing mission. He was to fetch Princess Mary. Already deprived of her title of Princess of Wales and told that she was illegitimate, the resentful seventeen-year old was to go to Hatfield as one of her sister ladies in waiting. Mary´s unhappiness and her obstinancy were disturbing elements in Elizabeth´s early childhood. Whenever the household moved to a different location there was another embarassing scene.

These dramas apart, life in the household was carefully regulated. All major decisions had to be referred to Henry. Anne too kept a close watch to the nursery; she chose all Elizabeth´s clothes: her personal tailor, William Loke, made the princess´s germents. The girl was like her father in colouring, with golden-red hair and a very fair skin, and Anne ordered dresses of white damask, green satin and yellow satin for her. These details mattered, for clothing was an important indication of status.

Anne did eventually conceive a son, but he was stillborn. By that point, Henry had begun to grow tired of Anne and began to plot her downfall. Most, if not all, historians agree that Henry's charges of incest against Anne were false, but they were all he needed to sign her execution warrant. She was beheaded on the Tower Green in May, 1536, before Elizabeth was even three years old.

No one knows who told Elizabeth what happened, or what she felt. Her own household was thrown into a state of disarray. Henry was peoccupied with his new wife and now that Anne Boleyn was gone there was no one to give the necessary orders about the child´s clothing. To make matters worse, John Shelton, her mother´s uncle, was disrupting the daily routine by imprudently insisting that Elizabeth should take her meals with everyone else in the hall instead of eating

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Sound In The Time Domain===

Acoustically, sound is a variance in air pressure which is picked up by the human hearing system and converted into electrical impulses via [[w:Transduction|transduction]]. These signals are analysed by the brain and presented as audio information. Similarly, audio information in the digital domain is represented by a sequence of numbers (samples) which represents amplitude as a function of time, and as such describe the fluctuations in air pressure that sound creates.

''Fig. 1. Image of a waveform or suitable graphic''

Fig. 1 shows the most common way that audio is viewed on computers. This ''time-domain'' method displays each sample value in time, creating visual data which helps the user to see, primarily, the amplitude of the sound; this process benefits the editing and sequencing of audio in many cases. On the other hand, it typically does not reveal much about the [[w:Timbre|timbre]] or sound ''color'' of the incoming audio, which is better represented by a [[w:Spectrogram|spectrogram]].

''Fig. 2. Image of sound analysed using a spectrograph''

The spectrogram shows us frequency as a function of time and is typically referred to as a ''frequency-domain'' method of analysis (however, strictly speaking, the 'domain' is still time). We can discern far more about the timbral quality of the sound due to the fact that each individual frequency can be represented on the graph. An example of an application of this technique might be to understand the frequency content of a sound for synthesis; particularly techniques such as additive resynthesis. The processing power required to produce a spectrogram is much greater than a time-domain analysis due to the greater complexity of the underlying algorithms.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Flare effect in ioquake3 works poorly ==

//Another one that I've never been able to get working.
Because it's not supported in Q3.  :)
Modern versions of the Q3 engine such as IOQ3 implement flares, tho rather poorly.

--[[User:84.56.156.46|84.56.156.46]] 23:44, 15 February 2007 (UTC) Poorly? Why do you say that? It is implemented the way iD always intended them to be. The flare effect works just fine.

==Ingredients==

* Nonstick [[Cookbook:Cooking Spray|cooking spray]] for the pan
* 3 [[Cookbook:Ounce|ounce]] Ibarra or semisweet [[Cookbook:Chocolate|chocolate]]
* 3 ounces unsweetened chocolate
* 2 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] cake [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoons]] [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]
* ½ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]] (increase to 2 teaspoons if using the semisweet chocolate)
* 1 cup (2 sticks) [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]], softened
* 1 cup plus 2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla]]
* 4 large [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]
* 1 cup [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
* [[Cookbook:Mocha Buttercream|Mocha Buttercream]]
* Cinnamon, unsweetened [[Cookbook:Cocoa Powder|cocoa]], and confectioner's sugar, optional toppings

==Procedure==

# Preheat oven to [[Cookbook:Oven_temperatures|350°F]].
# Generously spray a deep 9-inch [[Cookbook:Springform Pan|springform pan]] with nonstick cooking spray.
# Melt the chocolates in a [[Cookbook:Double Boiler|double boiler]] or in a [[Cookbook:Microwave Oven|microwave oven]] at low power.
# Set aside to cool.
# [[Cookbook:Sift|Sift]] together the flour, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon into a medium-size bowl.
# Place the butter and sugar in a large mixing bowl and [[Cookbook:Cream|cream]] at high speed with an [[Cookbook:Mixer|electric mixer]].
# Add the vanilla and the eggs, one at a time, [[Cookbook:Beat|beating]] well after each.
# Pour in the cooled chocolate mixture, and beat well until everything is incorporated.
# Add ⅓ of the flour mixture, and stir until it is just barely incorporated, then pour in half the milk.
# Stir briefly, then repeat with another ⅓ of the flour and the remaining milk.
# Add the rest of the flour mixture and stir just enough to blend. ''Don't over mix, or the cake will toughen.''
# Spread into the prepared pan and [[Cookbook:Bake|bake]] for 55 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
# Cool completely before assembling and frosting.
# Cut the cake into 3 equal layers, using a long serrated knife and a gentle sawing motion.
# Spread Mocha Buttercream between the layers, and stack them evenly.
# Spread more buttercream on the sides and the top.
# Artfully sprinkle the top with extra cinnamon, cocoa, and confectioner's sugar, if desired.

# Pour chocolate mixture on top of red bell pepper layer, leaving ¾ inch at the top of pan.
# [[Cookbook:Baking|Bake]] for about 20 minutes. The center should be soft, similar to a pumpkin pie when it is done.
# Let cool before taking it out of the pan.
# Refrigerate overnight before cutting.

===Topping===

# Whip cream and confectioners' sugar until peaks are thick, then slowly whip in vodka.
# When vodka is completely mixed in, add melted white chocolate while whisking.
# Refrigerate for 4 hours.
# Top each piece with plenty of whipped cream, sprinkle lightly with nutmeg and enjoy.

      <comment>anon was correct, my bad. Fixing the final answer...</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== General Strategies for Multiple-Component Operations ==

The most important thing to remember about doing mass balances with multiple components is that ''for each component, you can write one independent mass balance.'' What do I mean by independent? Well, remember we can write the general, overall mass balance for any steady-state system:

&lt;math&gt; \Sigma\dot{m}_{in} - \Sigma\dot{m}_{out} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

And we can write a similar mass balance for any ''component'' of a stream:

&lt;math&gt; \Sigma\dot{m}_{a,in} - \Sigma\dot{m}_{a,out} + m_{a,gen} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

This looks like we have three equations here, but in reality only two of them are independent because:

# The sum of the masses of the components equals the total mass
# The total mass generation due to reaction is always zero (by the law of mass conservation)

Therefore, if we add up all of the mass balances for the ''components'' we obtain the ''overall'' mass balance. Therefore, '''we can choose any set of n equations we want, where n is the number of components, but if we choose the overall mass balance as one of them we cannot use the mass balance on one of the components'''.

The choice of which balances to use depends on two particular criteria:

# Which component(s) you have the most information on; if you don't have enough information you won't be able to solve the equations you write.
# Which component(s) you can make the most reasonable assumptions about. For example, if you have a process involving oxygen and water at low temperatures and pressures, you may say that there is no oxygen dissolved in a liquid flow stream, so it all leaves by another path. This will simplify the algebra a good deal if you write the mass balance on that component.

== Multiple Components in a Single Operation: Separation of Ethanol and Water ==

{{example|Suppose a stream containing ethanol and water (two fully miscible compounds) flows into a distillation column at 100 kg/s. Two streams leave the column: the vapor stream contains 80% ethanol by mass and the liquid bottoms has an ethanol concentration of 4M. The total liquid stream flowrate is 20 kg/s. Calculate the composition of the entrance stream.}}

Following the step-by-step method makes things easier.

=== Step 1: Draw a Flowchart ===

The first step as always is to draw the flowchart, as described previously. If you do that for this system, you may end up with something like this, where x signifies mass fraction, [A] signifies molarity of A, and numbers signify stream numbers.

[[Image:EtOH_H2O_Flowchart.PNG]]

=== Step 2: Convert Units ===
Now, we need to turn to converting the concentrations into appropriate units. Since the total flowrates are given in terms of mass, a unit that expresses the concentration in terms of mass of the components would be most useful. The vapor stream compositions are given as mass percents, which works well with the units of flow. However, the liquid phase concentration given in terms of a molarity is not useful for finding a mass flow rate of ethanol (or of water). Hence we must convert the concentration to something more useful.

{{NOTE|Converting between Concentration Measurements

The easiest way to convert between concentrations is to take a careful look at the ''units'' of both what you want and what you have, and ask what physical properties (i.e. molar mass, density) you could use to interchange them. In this example, we want to convert a molarity into a mass fraction. We have from the definitions that:

&lt;math&gt; [A] = \frac{mol_A}{L_{sln}} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; x_A = \frac{m_A}{m_{sln}} &lt;/math&gt;

To convert the numerators, we need to convert moles of A to mass of A, so we can use the molar mass for this purpose. Similarly, to convert the denominators we need to change Liters to Mass, which means we'll use a density. Hence, the conversion from molarity to mass fraction is:

&lt;math&gt; x_A = [A]*\frac{(MW)_A}{{\rho}_{SLN}} &lt;/math&gt;

Since we have ways to estimate &lt;math&gt; {\rho}_{SLN} &lt;/math&gt; (remember them?), we can inter-convert the conversions.}}

In order to convert the molarity into a mass fraction, then, we need the molecular weight of ethanol and the density of a 4M ethanol solution. The former is easy if you know the chemical formula of ethanol: &lt;math&gt; CH_3CH_2OH &lt;/math&gt;. Calculating the molecular weight (as you did in chem class) you should come up with about &lt;math&gt; 46 \frac{g}{mol} &lt;/math&gt;.

Calculating the density involves plugging in mass fractions in and of itself, so you'll end up with an implicit equation. Recall that one method of estimating a solution density is to assume that the solution is ideal (which it probably is not in this case, but if no data are available or we just want an estimate, assumptions like these are all we have, as long as we realize the values will not be exact):

&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{{\rho}_{SLN}} = \Sigma(\frac{x_k}{{\rho}_k}) &lt;/math&gt;

In this case, then,

&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{{\rho}_{SLN}} = \frac{x_{EtOH}}{{\rho}_{EtOH}} + \frac{x_{H2O}}{{\rho}_{H2O}} &lt;/math&gt;

We can look up the densities of pure water and pure ethanol, they are as follows (from Wikipedia's articles [[w:Ethanol]] and [[w:Water]]):

&lt;math&gt; {\rho}_{EtOH} = 0.789 \frac{g}{cm^3} = 789 \frac{g}{L} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; {\rho}_{H2O} = 1.00 \frac{g}{cm^3} = 1000 \frac{g}{L} &lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, since the mass fractions add to one, our equation for density becomes:

&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{{\rho}_{sln}} = \frac{x_{EtOH}}{789\frac{g}{L}} + \frac{1 - x_{EtOH}}{1000 \frac{g}{L}} &lt;/math&gt;

From the NOTE above, we can now finally convert the molarity into a mass fraction as:

&lt;math&gt; x_{EtOH} = [EtOH]*\frac{(MW)_{EtOH}}{{\rho}_{SLN}}

= 4\frac{mol}{L} * 46\frac{g}{mol}* (\frac{x_{EtOH}}{789\frac{g}{L}} + \frac{1 - x_{EtOH}}{1000 \frac{g}{L}})&lt;/math&gt;

Solving this equation yields:

&lt;math&gt; x_{EtOH} = 0.194 &lt;/math&gt; (unitless)

=== Step 3: Relate your Variables ===

Since we are seeking properties related to mass flow rates, we will need to relate our variables with mass balances.

Remember that we can do a mass balance on any of the N independent species and one on the overall mass, but since the sum of the individual masses equals the overall only &lt;math&gt; N-1 &lt;/math&gt; of these equations will be independent. It is often easiest mathematically to choose the overall mass balance and &lt;math&gt; N - 1 &lt;/math&gt; individual species balances, since you don't need to deal with concentrations for the overall measurements.

Since our concentrations are now in appropriate units, we can do any two mass balances we want. Lets choose the overall first:

&lt;math&gt; \dot{m}_1 - \dot{m}_2 - \dot{m}_3 = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

Plugging in known values:

&lt;math&gt; \dot{m}_2 = 100\frac{kg}{s} - 20\frac{kg}{s} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \dot{m}_2 = 80\frac{kg}{s} &lt;/math&gt;

Now that we know &lt;math&gt; \dot{m}_2 &lt;/math&gt; we can do a mass balance on either ethanol or water to find the composition of the input stream. Lets choose ethanol (A):

&lt;math&gt; \dot{m}_{A1} = \dot{m}_{A2} + \dot{m}_{A3} &lt;/math&gt;

Written in terms of mass fractions this becomes:

&lt;math&gt; x_{A1}*\dot{m}_1 = x_{A2} * \dot{m}_2 + x_{A3}*\dot{m}_3 &lt;/math&gt;

Plugging in what we know:

&lt;math&gt; x_{A1}*100\frac{kg}{s} = 0.8*80\frac{kg}{s} + 0.194*20\frac{kg}{s} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; x_{A1} = 0.68 &lt;/math&gt;

Hence, '''the feed is 68% Ethanol and 34% Water'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Form-based Authentication in ASP.NET 

by: juliet 

It is a common need for a web site to have membership and login system, particularly when part of the web site is restricted in access by non-members. This tutorial will guide you through how to create such a form-based authentication in ASP.NET using C#. 

There are totally four things you need to create in order to make a form-based authentication. 

1. A database (Access 2000 or SQL server, or any RDBMS with a .NET ODBC driver) with a membership table. 

2. A login web control 

3. web.config file 

4. The actual login page 

The membership table 

At least you should have a table to store member information. The table can be as simple as having only the MemberID, strUserName and strPassword fields:

'''Create Excel'''


INTRODUCTION:

The Interoperability services make it very easy to work with COM Capable Applications such as Word and Excel. This article reveals using Excel from a managed application. Excel is the spreadsheet component of Microsoft Office 2000. The majority of Excel programmatic functionality is exposed through Automation via the type library Excel9.olb. The intention of this article is to express that a managed application can interrelate with Excel as a COM server. 

The first step is to create a reference in our project to Excel 9.0 Objects Library.

By using Tlbimp tool we can generate Excel.dll. 

TlbImp Excel9.olb Excel.dll

By adding Excel.dll to our program we can use the functionality of the Excel.

Now let us see in detail how to create an Excel Spreadsheet? &amp; Set values to the cell using C#. The codes for Creating, make visible, add a new workbook and to set a value for cell in the Excel file is shown below. 

1. CREATING NEW EXCEL.APPLICATION:

Application exc = new Application();
if (exc == null) {
Console.WriteLine(&quot;ERROR: EXCEL couldn't be started&quot;);
return 0;
}

2. TO MAKE APPLICATION VISIBLE:

exc.set_Visible(0, true);

3. TO GET THE WORKBOOKS COLLECTION:

Workbooks workbooks = exc.Workbooks;
_Workbook workbook = workbooks.Add(XlWBATemplate.xlWBATWorksheet, 0);

4. TO GET THE WORKSHEETS COLLECTION:

_Worksheet worksheet = (_Worksheet) sheets.get_Item(1);
if (worksheet == null) {
Console.WriteLine (&quot;ERROR in worksheet == null&quot;);
}

5. TO SET THE VALUE FOR CELL:

Range range1 = worksheet.get_Range(&quot;C1&quot;, Missing.Value);
if (range1 == null) {
Console.WriteLine (&quot;ERROR: range == null&quot;);
}
const int nCells = 1;
Object[] args1 = new Object[1];
args1[0] = nCells;
range1.GetType().InvokeMember(&quot;Value&quot;, BindingFlags.SetProperty, null, range1, args1);

The Example:

using System;
using System.Reflection; // For Missing.Value and BindingFlags
using System.Runtime.InteropServices; // For COMException
using Excel;
class AutoExcel 
{
public static int Main() 
{
Application exc = new Application();
if (exc == null) 
{
Console.WriteLine(&quot;ERROR: EXCEL couldn't be started!&quot;);
return 0;
}
exc.set_Visible(0, true); 
Workbooks workbooks = exc.Workbooks;
_Workbook workbook = workbooks.Add(XlWBATemplate.xlWBATWorksheet, 0); 
Sheets sheets = workbook.Worksheets;
_Worksheet worksheet = (_Worksheet) sheets.get_Item(1);
if (worksheet == null) 
{
Console.WriteLine (&quot;ERROR: worksheet == null&quot;);
}
Range range1 = worksheet.get_Range(&quot;C1&quot;, Missing.Value);
if (range1 == null) 
{
Console.WriteLine (&quot;ERROR: range == null&quot;);
}
const int nCells = 1;
Object[] args1 = new Object[1];
args1[0] = nCells;
range1.GetType().InvokeMember(&quot;Value&quot;, BindingFlags.SetProperty, null,range1, args1);
return 100;
}
} 

Now let us observe how to send a single dimension array to Excel:
It is similar to set the value for the cell. Only change is we use array as args2[0] = array2.

const int nCell = 5;
Range range2 = worksheet.get_Range(&quot;A1&quot;, &quot;E1&quot;);
int[] array2 = new int [nCell];
for (int i=0; i &lt; array2.GetLength(0); i++) {
array2[i] = i+1;
}
Object[] args2 = new Object[1];
args2[0] = array2;
range2.GetType().InvokeMember(&quot;Value&quot;, BindingFlags.SetProperty, null, range2, args2);

The OutPut:

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction to Investigative Writing ==

=== Definition ===
'''Investigative writing''' is writing that is meant to defend a thesis while exploring various areas of a topic. 

Investigative writing sets out to investigate a topic and report the findings to the reader. It is an extremely versatile form of writing that can span all kinds of topics and genres. It can be anything from a newspaper article to an entire book based on one specific research subject. Investigative writing provides a chance to help answer questions for the readers and the writer. 

=== Well known examples ===
Investigative writing is the basis of some very intriguing works in many genres including books, film, television, and other media.

Investigative reporting on television programs, like ''60 Minutes'' or ''20/20'', features some of the most obvious examples of investigative writing. Although viewers do not physically read the shows' scripts for themselves, the writing done to prepare for each show is investigative writing nonetheless.  	

Truman Capote's ''In Cold Blood'' is an example of book-length investigative nonfiction. Capote investigated the murder of a family in Kansas. There have also been a few film versions, like the recent ''Capote''.

Many documentaries on film or television are investigative as well. The documentary ''Super Size Me'' was a way for documentarian Morgan Spurlock to explore the correlation between obesity and fast food in the United States. The film sought after the answer to the question: What would happen if someone ate nothing but McDonald's for a month?

=== Oh, the possibilities ===
Many students dread the assignment of a research project or paper, but there is great potential for such an assignment to involve your own interest and still satisfy the teachers' requirements.

Every single field has the need for research and for questions to be asked. Whether you are interested in math, military, literature, history, or something you saw in the media, you can let your questions about the topic lead you to an interesting research project.

== Forming Your Question ==
If you read the previous section, you know that investigative writing can play an important role in all fields, yet you may not be certain how to begin your own assignment. The simple way to begin is with a question or preferably many questions. 

=== Those all important wh- words, and how! ===
What, who, when, where, why, and how are key words that can help you get started. Your initial question may be, &quot;What political factors would have influenced Dickens depiction of London in ''David Copperfield''?&quot; You could also ask when, where, why, how, or even more what questions based on that topic. The key is to ask many questions and keep an eye out for a question that could lead you to a solid thesis.

=== Inspiration for finding the question ===
It depends on how wide a variety of subjects your teacher allows, but in general, questions can come from your class reading or something you observe in your daily life. If you have the chance it is best to get your questions written down as soon as possible--a bit of a brainstorming session can be a good way to get your ideas down so you do not forget them! You could compile a list of the questions or map out your questions and ideas to see other possible links. 

You do not necessarily need to know the answer to any of the questions when you begin, but the question you choose to answer should be something that you find interesting and that you could answer after a little research and reflection.

Also, try to ask open-ended questions or questions that are going to require some explanation.

SIMPLE: Who was the first president of the United States?

SIMPLE: When did George Washington serve as president of the United States?

EXPLORATORY: Why was George Washington chosen to be the first president of the United States?
 
Note: While all of the wh- questions probably need to be answered, &quot;why&quot; or &quot;how&quot; questions are often the best questions on which to base your entire paper.

=== Questions in all fields of study ===

What do people use that gives off the most carbon emissions? (Science: Ecology)

Who caused the Great Chicago Fire? (History)

When did blues music first start in America? (Music)

Where is gasoline sold at the cheapest price to the public? (Economics)

Why is Italy the setting for so many of Shakespeare's plays? (Literature)

How did cavemen make their cave paintings? (Art)

== Research ==

'''Why Perform Research?'''

During research, you often discover new information. 

You probably perform some type of research more often than you realize.  When you make a decision to take a class for college, you might look through the college catalog to find out information on the class description.  When you decide to purchase a car, you will probably want to review information related to different models.  When you are assigned a paper on a specific topic in one of your classes, you will perform research to obtain as much information on the subject as possible. 

==== Credibility ====
After you have obtained the necessary information through your research, you need to decide which sources of information are credible enough to use in your paper. You may have sifted through an enormous amount of data, and now it is time to put everything together--but is that article from &quot;Reader's Digest&quot; as credible as the one from &quot;The Journal of the American Medical Association&quot;?  The latter information would probably be more credible for your piece than the other.  

One good rule of thumb to use when deciding on credibility is to ask yourself: &quot;Does this information come from a peer-reviewed journal or other peer-reviewed text?&quot;  Peer-reviewed simply means experts in that field of study have read the article and approved its publication. If you are investigating an article that deals with contamination in the Ozarks' ground water supply and one source is the Springfield News-letter and the other is the peer-reviewed &quot;Scientific Journal,&quot; the journal article probably holds more credibility because it is peer-reviewed.  This is not to say that the contents of the newspaper article are incorrect, but it helps your own article seem more reliable if you have researched information that is considered first-class in its field.

Also beware of information garnished from websites, blogs, forums, and other types of internet sources that are written by people with complete autonomy. Much of the information found on the internet is based on unqualified opinions or misinterpretations of facts. Information on the internet runs the risk of being highly biased and outright inaccurate.

=== Sources ===

==== Primary Sources ====

Determining if your sources are primary or secondary means determining what is first-hand information and what is merely the re-telling of that information through a third party of some type.

First, let's look at primary sources.  Primary sources present first-hand knowledge about a certain topic. In other words, these sources are presented by someone who experienced something first hand. Elie Wiesel's ''Night'' and the diary of Anne Frank are both first-hand accounts of the horrors of the Holocaust. On the other hand, a play based on Anne Frank's life written by someone who read her diary and an encyclopedia article about Nazi death camps written by a historian not present at the time they existed would be considered secondary sources. 

First-hand documents might include court records, original interviews, diaries giving first-hand accounts of information, journals, etc.  You can also say that primary sources keep records of events as they have been described--without the use of interpretation or commentary by someone else.  They can also include information gathered from data that has not been manipulated or interpreted by someone else.

==== Secondary Sources ====

Secondary sources are an analysis of the primary source through a restatement, restructuring, or re-interpretation.  All subsequent material, such as interpretations or studies that are based on the primary source, are considered secondary sources. Primary sources are often used as a base for secondary sources in order to argue a point or persuade an audience towards a certain outcome or opinion.  Examples of secondary sources might include encyclopedias, textbooks, dictionaries, and books and articles whose main purpose is to interpret or review work done in the field of research.
Examples of primary and secondary sources:

'''Primary Source''' 
                             
Art:                                      Original artwork,               
History:                                  &quot;The Diary of Anne Franke,&quot;      
Literature:                               An original poem,                
Political Science Original:               &quot;The Bill of Rights,&quot; 
Theatre:                                  A taping of a live play production.          
                                    
'''Secondary Source'''

Art:                                       An article reviewing the original work,
History:                                   A Book about Jews escaping Nazi terrorism,
Literature:                                A critique of the original poetry, 
Political Science:                         An essay on the founding fathers' work on the Bill,
Theatre:                                   An article about the author of the play.

'''Citation and documentation'''

Although citations and documentation can be confusing, it is not as complicated as one might think.  The best thing to remember is: If you use a statement, piece of an article, or basically more than three consecutive words that have been written, taped, or stated by anyone other than you in your paper or article, then it needs to be placed inside quotation marks and given a parenthetical citation. However, even if you put the information into your own words, if it is someone else's idea or it is information from another source, you must use a parenthetical citation. A parenthetical citation means you include the authors name and page number in parenthesis within the text.  This form may differ between the Modern Language Association (MLA) and the American Psychological Association (APA), and this is covered in other sections of this text, but the rules are hard-fast and set so that you do not find yourself committing plagiarism (see the next topic for more).

'''Plagiarism''' 

The definition of plagiarism is very simple: if you use information from a source other than yourself in your investigative writing, YOU MUST GIVE THE SOURCE CREDIT!  There is no way around this, and not doing so is cheating, and if detected by your instructor will likely result in harsh consequences. Because of its etymology, many people think of plagiarism in terms of kidnapping the offspring of another person's mind.   

In order to avoid plagiarism, you must give credit to the source whenever any of the following are used:

#An idea, opinion, or theory that belongs to someone else. 
#Anything that falls beyond the realm of common knowledge, such as statistics, facts, graphs, charts, or drawings that you include in your paper but did not design or calculate yourself. 
#Quotations that have been taken from another person's written, taped or spoken words, or any paraphrasing of these words.

In short, if you use information in your paper that you did not come up with on your own, make sure you give proper credit or you will be plagiarizing. 
 


'''Types of documentation: MLA, APA, etc.''' 

The two most popular forms of documenting sources and creating citations are outlined by the Modern Language Association (MLA) and the American Psychological Association (APA).  These organizations publish manuals that provide clear instructions on how to cite sources and how to embed citations.  However, keep in mind that since these are separate organizations, their rules of documentation are slightly different.  The information contained in their manuals is too voluminous to include here, but you can purchase an MLA or APA style guide for use as reference, or you can visit many websites on the Internet that explain the guidelines of the MLA and APA in detail.  One that I highly recommend is [http://owl.english.purdue.edu/ The OWL ](The Online Writing Laboratory) at Purdue University.  You can also find help on documentation at many more sites.  Here are just a few you may want to check out.

''' Ways to take notes: 3x5 cards, etc.''' 

When you are doing your investigative paper, you will almost certainly find a need to keep notes.  This can be done in many ways.  The simplest is to keep a notebook or journal of information and interviews that you may want to include in your paper.  Another is to use note cards to organize your  notes.  You may also find that videotaping or use of a tape recorder can be handy tools that allow you to ask questions at any time and then transcribe the notes later.  Just remember that note-taking should be performed as the investigative process is taking place.  It is easy to forget or lose track of information if it is not recorded in a timely and organized fashion.

== Thesis/Topic Sentence ==
A thesis statement is a statement that expresses the main idea of your paper. It is usually one sentence, but it can be longer if necessary. Think of a thesis statement as a topic sentence for your entire paper.

=== Form and place ===
A good thesis statement needs to establish a purpose (to analyze, to explain, to persuade, etc.)
and state as clearly as possible the terms of your argument. Everything in your paper should serve to support your thesis statement.

A thesis statement is usually the last sentence of the first paragraph of a paper. However, a thesis can appear anywhere in your paper: it can be the first sentence, the very last sentence, or anywhere in between. It is uncommon in academic writing, however, to find a thesis beyond the first page of a paper. Nonetheless, some writers feel that the thesis should be presented later in the paper (such as  at the end of a persuasive argument that builds up to a sort of grand finale). Still, unless you have an extremely good reason for withholding the thesis, it is a good idea to present it as soon as possible to the reader, so they understand exactly what it is you are trying to say about your topic. It is also customary to restate the main idea of your paper in the conclusion, so that your paper leaves a clear impression on the reader.

=== General v. specific ===

Naturally, you want your thesis to be very specific in the sense that it exactly states your main idea. However, how specific or general you make that idea can be very important to the outcome of the paper. A thesis that is too broad will not provide enough direction, and a thesis that is to narrow may keep you from discussing some key issues related to the topic.


Example A:
Television has had a negative impact on American society.

Example B:
Violent television has caused some teenagers to change the way they perceive violence in real life.

Example C:
South Park has influenced some teenagers to commit violent acts.

Unless you are planning on writing a book, Example A simply covers too much territory. Example B is probably ideal for a longer research paper. Example C, on the other hand, might be too restrictive if you were aiming to write a longer paper because it only allows you to discuss one negative effect of one specific television program, but just right for a short essay. Essentially, there is no such thing as &quot;too general&quot; or &quot;too specific.&quot; It is simply a matter of matching the thesis to the ideal length. 

If the scope changes or your focus shifts (or even if you change your mind completely) while you are researching or writing, it is fine to change your thesis statement so it better reflects what you want to say about the topic, but you must be sure that all the information in the final draft supports the new thesis.

=== Examples from various disciplines ===
It is probably worth noting that the above examples are probably a bit too simple to be reppresentative of actual thesis statements, but the following are examples of reasonable thesis statements one might use to address a wide variety of topics and for a variety of purposes:

1. Math/Natural Science (to explain):
Although Fibonacci sequences are most often applied to mathematical contexts, the sequences play an interesting role in nature as well.

2. Art (to explain): 
Pablo Picasso's innovative approach to art led to a new movement, not only in art, but in music and literature as well.

3. Psychology/Criminal Justice (to persuade):
It is unethical to sentence serial killers to the death penalty because they are essentially mentally ill.

4. Literature (to analyze):
A different aspect of the American dream motivates each of the main characters in John Stienbeck's ''Of Mice and Men''.

5. Agriculture (to persuade): 
The USDA's current procedure for detecting mad cow disease in cattle earmarked for human consumption is grossly inadequate. 

6. Astronomy (to analyze):
There are valid arguments on both side of the controversy regarding the recent reclassification of Pluto.

7. Business (to explain):
The quantity theory of money emphasizes the positive relationship of overall prices with the quantity of money.

=== Introduction ===
The introduction is important because it sets the tone for the rest of the piece and gives the reader an idea about where your writing is going and what points you will make along the way.  In short, your introduction is your time to ease your readers into your topic and let them know what it is you are going to tell them about it.  The introduction is also important because you will give the reader your thesis, the sentence on which your entire paper will be based.



==== Thesis ====
A thesis, in its most basic form, is the topic sentence of the entire paper.  It serves as the compass for what is to come within a given work.  You will need a specific thesis statement because you are setting up the argument that will be supported within your paper.

==== Good and bad beginnings ====
It takes time to develop a thesis, but the thesis should be well-developed (if not completely developed) before you begin writing your paper.  A fully developed thesis can help you maintain a sense of direction within your paper.  It will help you to develop your main topic and remind you which points you are going to use to support the argument you are making.     

A thesis by a beginning writer will usually contain a general statement such as:
In Greek mythology Zeus was portrayed as a god with many human qualities.  

While this is a very good topic statement which lets the reader know that you are going to be discussing, the fact that Zeus possesses “human characteristics,” it does not provide a sense of the specific direction that will guide the entire paper.

In order to give your paper more direction and the reader more of an idea of what types of “human qualities” might be discussed, you should expand your thesis into something more specific, like:
In Greek mythology Zeus was portrayed as a god, however he had many human qualities such as: his creation from parents, his lust for women, his displays of anger, an ego which he did not like to have bruised, the ability to show compassion, and on occasion he was known to be disloyal.  

The second thesis is more clear, indicating to the reader that Zeus was a god who had many human qualities, and that the paper will be discussing at least six of those qualities.  By actually listing the human qualities of Zeus, the writer has set up an expectation for the argument which is to follow and indicated the basic organization for their paper in an easy to follow manner to which the reader can now refer.

=== Body/middle ===
The body of your paper is where you will get to support the argument that you made in your thesis, and it is the largest and most laborious part of the paper.  In the body of your paper you will support your thesis by stating the main points and then supporting them with the factual evidence which you have found.  Each of your main points should be clear to the reader and support your thesis argument. Your supporting evidence should also be clear and used with the correct main point in order to form a cohesive and organized essay body.  

==== Main points ====
The main points of your argument will be contained in the body of your paper.  There can be as few as two main points or as many as are needed to complete the argument depending on complexity of the subject, word or page limits, and the thesis itself.  The main points serve as a more specific overview of the ways in which you will begin to support your thesis claim.  They act as a further filter for your evidence and will keep your paper organized and comprehensive.

In the thesis statement above you already have your main points organized and set up for the reader within the thesis.  You points are:

1)	Zeus had parents, he did not always exist

2)	Zeus is lusty and often pursues women

3)	Zeus gets angry and exhibits his anger through behavior

4)	Zeus has an ego

5)	Zeus has the ability to show compassion

6)	Zeus can be disloyal   

Your job now is to discuss each of your points in more detail and use contextual evidence to support the main points.

==== Supporting evidence ====
Supporting evidence is the key to successfully making the argument set forth in your thesis.  You will need to use several different sources within your supporting evidence to keep the paper from being too monotonous.  Having several different sources as supporting evidence for any given point assures the reader that there are others out there who are researching the same topic as you and finding similar conclusions.

Supporting evidence can be found in a number of sources and arranged in just as many ways.  For any given main point you might find a quote from a researcher, some statistics, or textual evidence which you can use as supporting evidence for your main point. 

For example in the main points above you might look at some of the Greek myths and use specific incidents within a myth to support your claim that Zeus had parents.  In fact, you could site an entire story as your evidence, however DO NOT place the story in your paper.  Simply state briefly the idea of the story and in what book you found it, you do not need to completely retell the reader about the birth of Zeus.  The fact that there is an entire myth based on his birth should be proof enough.

You will also need to find some quotes from authors who have credibility (see credibility section) and who have researched on the same subject which you are arguing.  For example, in main point number 4 of the Zeus argument you will want to find quotes from psychologists or possibly myth scholars who are familiar with the idea of an ego.  A quote from Sigmund Freud or supporting evidence of his studies of the id, ego, and superego, will serve as a basis for the idea that an ego is a human quality.  Freud can offer some context within your argument, then you can use texts from myths to provide some further evidence of Zeus’ ego.

==== Other side of the argument and your argument against it ====
Within your argument you want to, at some point, acknowledge that there is another side to your subject.  You are only arguing one side of the thesis, however there is always another way to approach the subject which you are arguing.  A good writer will acknowledge the other side (or sides) of the argument and then dismiss them with his or her evidence.  It is hard to do within a paper that is so strongly placed in the argument of just one side of a subject, but when acknowledgement and dismissal are executed correctly they will actually enhance the argument of the writer.  

For example, if you are giving supporting evidence for the main point number 6 in the Zeus argument, you might want to acknowledge that some scholars (if in fact, you have found it to be true in your research) contend that Zeus’ “disloyalty” is not a function of his humanness, but rather a function of the way people might feel about his actions, you will want to refute that statement in your argument.  

Simply acknowledge that someone has said this (give them proper credit) and then show another scholar who has argued against it.  Your argument should look something like this:
Professor Z of Such and Such University has written an article titled “Loyal Zeus” in which he argues that Zeus was not disloyal, but humans see his actions as disloyal, however Dr. X, argues that Zeus is in fact disloyal because….” 

Thus you have successfully acknowledged and dismissed a counterpoint of your argument.  However, do not try to counter all arguments against your thesis, because it will prove to be exhausting, non productive, and can possibly confuse readers as to which side you are actually arguing.

=== Conclusion ===
The conclusion of your paper is what ties everything together.  You want the reader to see what it is you set out to do, how you proved it and what it all means to them.  The reader should know, at this point, where you stand on your argument and should be winding down from reading your paper.  You can let your reader know that you are ready to end the paper by using some of the following words as signposts for your conclusion:
1)	In retrospect
2)	In conclusion
3)	As can be seen

You are letting your reader know that the end of the paper is near and that you are about to give them a quick overview of what they have just finished reading to remind them of what it is you want them to take away form the paper.


==== Restating of the thesis ====
In your conclusion you want to restate your thesis in order to remind the reader of what it is you were arguing.  You can restate your thesis exactly as it is in the introduction of you may choose to alter it slightly.  In any case, do not alter it so much that it becomes unrecognizable as the thesis of your paper, or the reader may lose sight of what is was that you set out to argue to begin with.

==== Summarizing ====
After you have restated your thesis you will summarize your main points briefly in order to remind your reader of the basic outline of your argument. You do not need to go into supporting evidence in your conclusion because you will have thoroughly explained it already within the body of the paper.  The summarization of your paper will mentally guide the reader back through your argument so they may begin to think about their own ideas on the subject and form a conclusion of their own.

==== Example Assignment ====

Genealogy Project

You choose a family member or family event that you want to write about and learn more about the person or situation. You interview at least three of your family members about the person or event you chose. You should also try to collect any mementos or documents about your subject as additional sources. Then you report your findings into a paper in third person narrative.

The following is a similar essay on family history which won the 2005 &quot;My Turn&quot; contest sponsored by Newsweek Education Program: [http://www.newsweekeducation.com/myturn2005/sung.php &quot;Family Tree&quot;] by By Nami Sung
of Stuyvesant High School in New York, New York.

{{Closed|1=&lt;span style=&quot;background:red; color:white&quot;&gt;closed&lt;/span&gt; as '''Delete''' --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 13:00, 8 February 2007 (UTC)}}

It may well be me but I guess I view this as something less than serious all in all.  It has been around and not found a home for 6 months now.  Looking through my local bookshop would suggest either a market for this kind of textbook or more likely a complete absence of demand! --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 13:19, 12 January 2007 (UTC)
*'''Comment''' - this survived a previous VfD with the comment '''Keep on the condition that it can be merged, because it can't stand on it's own.'''  If for no other reason I believe this should be '''delete''' --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 14:13, 12 January 2007 (UTC)
* '''Delete''' as it has obviously not been merged and is quite bad and probably should have been deleted at WP instead of transwikied here based upon quality. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:22, 12 January 2007 (UTC)
* '''Delete''' doesn't appear to be a useful book in its present form. [[User:Xania|Xania]] [[Image:Flag_of_Poland_2.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 15:01, 12 January 2007 (UTC)
* &lt;s&gt;'''Keep'''. There is no timeframe for moving a page out of the transwiki space. Also, whether you find this book to be &quot;serious&quot; or not is irrelevant: the subject of art appreciation (and by extension, &quot;architectural appreciation&quot;) is a subject of academic study and amateur hobbyism. A quick move to [[Building Watching]] should be sufficient to quell most of the criticisms here so far. Once it is in it's new home, it will be a stub, but stubs are acceptable. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:54, 12 January 2007 (UTC)&lt;s&gt;
:*'''Comment''' - the comment I quoted was your's Whiteknight! --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 20:51, 12 January 2007 (UTC)
::*I knew that comment looked familiar! I've commented on so many VfDs in my time, it's hard for me to remember what all I've said, and what opinions I've had about all pages. In fact, as a fun historical note, one of the reasons why i was voted in as an admin originally was because of my activity on this very page. Unfortunately (or fortunately, depending) my opinions tend to evolve over time, and I am not always likely to vote the same way on the same page under the same circumstances. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 03:40, 22 January 2007 (UTC)
* '''Keep''' - the topic is perhaps not so silly, in light of [[w:The Architecture of Happiness|this book]] and it's accompanying [[w:The Perfect Home|TV doco]]. Sure, it's pretty light-on at present, but perhaps some architecture types could build upon it (no pun intended!) [[User:Webaware|Webaware]] 23:44, 12 January 2007 (UTC)
* '''Keep''' --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 23:59, 12 January 2007 (UTC)
* '''Delete''' or '''merge''' with a wikibook on tourism. The current version is mostly incomprehensible, and doesn't say anything. [[wikipedia:user:pcu123456789|PCU123456789]] ([[wikipedia:user_talk:pcu123456789|talk]]) 03:43, 27 January 2007 (UTC)
* '''Delete'''. I've had a change of heart, and looking at this page again (for the millionth time, it seems), it is hard for me to find much that is worth keeping, or much that would be a benefit to a future book on this subject. When dealing with stubs and proto-books, it is difficult to determine what should be kept, and what should not be. Even erring on the side of caution, this page has been far too useless for far too long. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:29, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* If you're a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* If you're a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

== Hello ==
Welcome Chi Sigma, thanks for your contribution already to the Nc6 Sicilian. [[User:ChessCreator|ChessCreator]] ([[User talk:ChessCreator|talk]]) 10:49, 17 February 2008 (UTC)
:[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/User_talk:ChessCreator replied]
:I also noticed your use of font statements in theory tables. I personally remove them whenever I edit as they add nothing and make editing theory tables tedious and they are tedious enough without it. [[User:ChessCreator|ChessCreator]] ([[User talk:ChessCreator|talk]]) 23:05, 17 February 2008 (UTC)
==Your invited!==
&lt;div class=&quot;boilerplate metadata&quot; id=&quot;stub&quot;&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#cef2e0;&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;
Hello,&lt;br&gt;
As a previous contributor to Chess topics, I'd like inform you of the creation of a new project called [[Wikibooks:Chess]]&lt;br&gt; 
Recently this project page has been created and it is hoped that you will join.&lt;br&gt;
To overcome issues of communicating, the project has it's own central page and talk area along with navigation system of useful pages and many new features to make communication among users much slicker and easier, including a [[Special:RecentChangesLinked/Chess/Index_of_chess_topics|public chess watchlist]]. No need to have your own watchlist anymore, one click and you can see all recent Chess edits!&lt;br&gt;
Also added recently is a new opening navigator(See below), a chess diagram upgrade(looks nice), and a chess stub category. All the [[Opening theory in chess]] pages now have this built in, that's over 500 pages upgraded.&lt;br&gt;

Hope to hear from you.
Regards
[[User:ChessCreator|ChessCreator]] ([[User talk:ChessCreator|talk]]) 19:47, 2 April 2008 (UTC)

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

== Ahoy ==

Yes, still here :) [[User:SunCreator|SunCreator]] ([[User talk:SunCreator|talk]]) 22:01, 2 October 2008 (UTC)</text>

== [[A Researcher's Guide to Local History Terminology]] ==

I know it's been mentioned twice before, on [[Talk:A Researcher's Guide to Local History Terminology]], but this really is outside the [[WB:WIW|scope of Wikibooks]]. Please make an effort with the rest of the contributors to make sure that this gets turned into something other than a dictionary or glossary, as these are not what Wikibooks is for. If something isn't done to turn it into a textbook, someone will eventually put it up for deletion. ''' &amp;ndash; [[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]''' | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:55, 5 September 2007 (UTC)

: I helped move the article here after I nomination it for deletion at [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Local history glossary|Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Local history glossary]] the main contributer here and on Wikipedia is [[User:Rosser1954]]. [[User:Jeepday|Jeepday]] 07:00, 15 September 2007 (UTC)

::Well I'm glad the content wasn't lost, but the fact remains that standalone glossaries are [[WB:WIW#Wikibooks is not a dictionary|outside project scope]]. The exception is that if you have a textbook, you may have a glossary which is &quot;secondary and auxiliary to a  main text&quot;. That's clearly not the case here, as the glossary outweighs the rest of the textbook. Please continue to develop the textbook, ensuring that the glossary part of it becomes ''auxiliary and secondary''.

Hello Jeepday. Thanks for the info. Much appreciated. ATB. [[User:Rosser1954|Rosser1954]] ([[User talk:Rosser1954|talk]]) 14:03, 19 January 2008 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Turkish/Navigation|place=top|1=Pronunciation and Alphabet/İ-R|2=Contributions to this Wikibook|up=Pronunciation and Alphabet}}

The alphabet in Turkish is based on the Latin alphabet. However, the pronunciations of the letters are a little different from English, and there are also some perhaps unfamiliar letters included, too. So, let's start learning the Turkish alphabet!

===A===
{| style=&quot;padding:0px width: 30%&quot;
|style=&quot;padding: 0em 1em 0em 0.5em&quot;|/{{IPA|ɑ}}/||{{audio|Open back unrounded vowel.ogg|Click for sound}}||{{inline player|Open back unrounded vowel.ogg|width=50px}}
|}
Letter is named as 'a'. Pronounced like the '''a''' in '''a'''rm, but shorter. It's the most common letter in Turkish. Considered as a 'back vowel'.

For example:
*{{tr/word|Ankara|(Capital city of Turkey)}} /{{IPA|ˈɑnkɑɾɑ}}/
*{{tr/word|akvaryum|aquarium}} /{{IPA|ɑkˈvɑɾjum}}/
*{{tr/word|aktif|active}} /{{IPA|ɑkˈtif}}/
*{{tr/word|Asya|Asia}} /{{IPA|ˈɑsjɑ}}/
*{{tr/word|Avrupa|Europe}} /{{IPA|ɑvɾupɑ}}/
*{{tr/word|Amerika Birleşik Devletleri|United States of America}} /{{IPA|ɑmeɾiˈkɑ biɾleˈʃic devletleˈɾi}}/

===B===
{| style=&quot;padding:0px width: 30%&quot;
|style=&quot;padding: 0em 1em 0em 0.5em&quot;|/{{IPA|b}}/||{{audio|Voiced bilabial plosive.ogg|Click for sound}}||{{inline player|Voiced bilabial plosive.ogg|width=50px}}
|}

Named as ''be''. Pronounced like the '''b''' in '''b'''ig. Detones to 'p' in end of the word.

For example:
*{{tr/word|bar|bar}} /{{IPA|bɑɾ}}/
*{{tr/word|baba|father}} /{{IPA|bɑˈbɑ}}/
*{{tr/word|başarı|success (noun)}} /{{IPA|bɑʃɑˈɾɯ}}/
*{{tr/word|bir|one}} /{{IPA|biɾ}}/

===C===
{| style=&quot;padding:0px width: 30%&quot;
|style=&quot;padding: 0em 1em 0em 0.5em&quot;|/{{IPA|dʒ}}/||{{audio|Voiced_palato-alveolar_affricate.ogg|Click for sound}}||{{inline player|Voiced_palato-alveolar_affricate.ogg|width=50px}}
|}
Named as ''ce''. Now things have started to go different, here! Be careful, in Turkish, '''c''' is pronounced sort of like the j in '''j'''elly. Detones to 'ç' in the end of word.

For example:
*{{tr/word|cep telefonu|mobile phone (literally pocket phone)}} /{{IPA|dʒep telefonu}}/
*{{tr/word|cam|glass}} /{{IPA|dʒɑm}}/ 
*{{tr/word|cin|genie}} /{{IPA|dʒin}}/

===Ç ===
{| style=&quot;padding:0px width: 30%&quot;
|style=&quot;padding: 0em 1em 0em 0.5em&quot;|/{{IPA|tʃ}}/||{{audio|Voiceless_palato-alveolar_affricate.ogg|Click for sound}}||{{inline player|Voiceless_palato-alveolar_affricate.ogg|width=50px}}
|}
Named as ''çe''. This is pronounced like the ch in '''ch'''ocolate.

For example:
*{{tr/word|çan|bell}} /{{IPA|tʃɑn}}/
*{{tr/word|çam|pine (tree)}} /{{IPA|tʃɑm}}/
*{{tr/word|çene|chin}} /{{IPA|tʃeˈne}}/
*{{tr/word|çay|tea}} /{{IPA|tʃɑj}}/
*{{tr/word|çocuk|child}} /{{IPA|tʃoˈdʒuk}}/
*{{tr/word|Çin|China}} /{{IPA|tʃin}}/

===D===
{| style=&quot;padding:0px width: 30%&quot;
|style=&quot;padding: 0em 1em 0em 0.5em&quot;|/{{IPA|d}}/||{{audio|Voiced alveolar plosive.ogg|Click for sound}}||{{inline player|Voiced alveolar plosive.ogg|width=50px}}
|}
Named as ''de''. This is pronounced like the '''d''' in '''d'''elight. Detones to 't' in the end of the word.

For example:
*{{tr/word|Danimarka|Denmark}} /{{IPA|dɑniˈmɑɾkɑ}}/
*{{tr/word|deniz|sea}} /{{IPA|deˈniz}}/
*{{tr/word|dergi|magazine}} /{{IPA|deɾˈɟi}}/
*{{tr/word|dün|yesterday}} /{{IPA|dyn}}/

===E===
{| style=&quot;padding:0px width: 30%&quot;
|style=&quot;padding: 0em 1em 0em 0.5em&quot;|/{{IPA|e}}/||{{audio|Close-mid front unrounded vowel.ogg|Click for sound}}||{{inline player|Close-mid front unrounded vowel.ogg|width=50px}}
|-
|style=&quot;padding: 0em 1em 0em 0.5em&quot;|/{{IPA|ɛ}}/||{{audio|Open-mid front unrounded vowel.ogg|Click for sound}}||{{inline player|Open-mid front unrounded vowel.ogg|width=50px}}
|-
|style=&quot;padding: 0em 1em 0em 0.5em&quot;|/{{IPA|æ}}/||{{audio|Near-open front unrounded vowel.ogg|Click for sound}}||{{inline player|Near-open front unrounded vowel.ogg|width=50px}}
|}

Named as ''e''. This letter has three allophones (i.e. this letter can be pronunced as three different sounds under different conditions.). All of the sounds are similar sounds. The first one is more like '''{{Turkish/Letter|i}}''' (i.e. it is ''closer''), the second one is a bit like {{turkish/Letter|a}} and the last one is more like {{turkish/Letter|a}} (i.e. it is ''more open''). Although it never changes the meaning of the word if pronounced wrongly, it is very important to pronunce /{{IPA|e}}/ and /{{IPA|æ}}/ correctly, in order to have a native-like pronunciation. /{{IPA|ɛ}}/ is a sound between (closer to /{{IPA|e}}/) them and it is not distinguished generally.
*/{{IPA|æ}}/ sound occurs before {{Turkish/Letter|l}}, {{Turkish/Letter|m}}, {{Turkish/Letter|n}}, {{Turkish/Letter|r}} in situations where the sequences ''er'', ''em'', ''en'' and ''el'' are ''not followed by a vowel''. It is similar to ''a'' in h'''a'''nd.  For example: {{tr/word|belki|maybe}} /{{IPA|bælcʰi}}/ {{audio|Tr-belki.ogg|listen}}, {{tr/word|pergel|pair of compasses}} /{{IPA|pæɾɟæl}}/ [http://www.veridepo.name.tr/sound/p1045.wav ''listen''].
*/{{IPA|ɛ}}/ occurs in ''wordfinal'' position. For example, {{tr/word|metre|meter or metre}} /{{IPA|metrɛ}}/ {{audio|metre.ogg|listen}} (compare /e/ and /ɛ/ while listening this audio file, they are very similar sounds, but /æ/ and /e/ are not). 
*/{{IPA|e}}/ occurs elsewhere {{tr/word|erk{{turkish/c|e}}k|male}} /{{IPA|æɾcʰecʰ}}/ {{audio|Tr_tr_erkek.ogg|listen}}.  All three occur in words such as {{tr/word|gezegende|on the planet}} /{{IPA|gezegændɛ}}/, {{tr/word|defterde|in the notebook}} /{{IPA|deftʰæɾdɛ}}/ . 

Examples:
*{{tr/word|egzersiz|exercise}} /{{IPA|eɟzæɾˈsiz}}/
*{{tr/word|ekmek|exercise}} /{{IPA|ecˈmecʰ}}/
*{{tr/word|elma|apple}} /{{IPA|elˈmɑ}}/
*{{tr/word|enerji|energy}} /{{IPA|enæɾˈʒi}}/
*{{tr/word|ev|house}} /{{IPA|ˈev}}/ 
*{{tr/word|el|hand}} /{{IPA|ˈæl}}/ some people pronunce it as /{{IPA|ˈel}}/

===F===
{| style=&quot;padding:0px width: 30%&quot;
|style=&quot;padding: 0em 1em 0em 0.5em&quot;|/{{IPA|f}}/||{{audio|Voiceless labiodental fricative.ogg|Click for sound}}||{{inline player|Voiceless labiodental fricative.ogg|width=50px}}
|}
Named as ''fe''. This is pronounced like the f in '''f'''orget. It's a rare sound and only in loanwords (mostly Arabic).

For example:
*{{tr/word|fakir|poor}} /{{IPA|fɑˈciɾ}}/
*{{tr/word|faks|fax}} /{{IPA|ˈfɑks}}/
*{{tr/word|fare|mouse}} /{{IPA|fɑːˈɾɛ}}/
*{{tr/word|fikir|idea}} /{{IPA|fiˈciɾ}}/
*{{tr/word|Finlandiya|Finland}} /{{IPA|finˈlɑndijɑ}}/
*{{tr/word|Fransa|France}} /{{IPA|ˈfɾɑnsɑ}}/
*{{tr/word|futbol|football}} /{{IPA|ˈfutboɫ}}/

===G===
{| style=&quot;padding:0px width: 30%&quot;
|style=&quot;padding: 0em 1em 0em 0.5em&quot;|/{{IPA|g}}/ (with back vowels, i.e. {{Turkish/Letter|a}}, {{Turkish/Letter|ı}}, {{Turkish/Letter|o}} and {{Turkish/Letter|u}})||{{audio|Voiced velar plosive.ogg|Click for sound}}||{{inline player|Voiced velar plosive.ogg|width=50px}}
|-
|style=&quot;padding: 0em 1em 0em 0.5em&quot;|/{{IPA|ɟ}}/ (with front vowels i.e. {{Turkish/Letter|e}}, {{Turkish/Letter|i}}, {{Turkish/Letter|ö}} and {{Turkish/Letter|ü}})||{{audio|Voiced palatal plosive.ogg|Click for sound}}||{{inline player|Voiced palatal plosive.ogg|width=50px}}
|}

Or ''ge''. This is pronounced like the '''g''' in '''g'''o with back vowels and like the '''g''' in '''g'''uitar with front vowels. Detones to 'k' in end of the word.

For example:
*{{tr/word|gazete|newspaper}}
*{{tr/word|gece|night}}
*{{tr/word|göz|eye}}

===Ğ===
In Turkish, this is referred to as ''yumuşak &quot;g&quot;'' (''soft &quot;g&quot;''), because technically that's what it is! It can never be used at the beginning of a word, but simply lengthens the previous vowel. Think of it as the Turkish equivalent of the '''gh''' in ''through''.

For example:
*{{tr/word|dağ|mountain}}
*{{tr/word|ağaç|tree}}
*{{tr/word|doğum|birth}}
*{{tr/word|yoğurt|yoghurt}}

===H===
{| style=&quot;padding:0px width: 30%&quot;
|style=&quot;padding: 0em 1em 0em 0.5em&quot;|/{{IPA|h}}/||{{audio|Voiceless glottal fricative.ogg|Click for sound}}||{{inline player|Voiceless glottal fricative.ogg|width=50px}}
|}
Or ''he''. This is pronounced like the h in '''h'''eaven.

For example:
*{{tr/word|hafta|week}}
*{{tr/word|hayır|no}}
*{{tr/word|hata|mistake}}

===I===
{| style=&quot;padding:0px width: 30%&quot;
|style=&quot;padding: 0em 1em 0em 0.5em&quot;|/{{IPA|ɯ}}/||{{audio|Close back unrounded vowel.ogg|Click for sound}}||{{inline player|Close back unrounded vowel.ogg|width=50px}}
|}
This is another one to watch out for! It's not pronounced like an {{Turkish/Letter|i}}! As a matter of fact, the lowercase version of this is a dotless i ({{Turkish/Letter|ı}}). It has no exact English equivalent, but is pronounced like the e in leg'''e'''nd or i in cous'''i'''n. The exact pronunciation is made by shaping your lips to say '''e''' (as in br'''ea'''d), but trying to say '''u''' (as in y'''ou''') instead. It's hard, but no harm in trying!

For example:
*{{tr/word|ılık|warm}} /{{IPA|ɯˈɫɯk}}/

Try and learn those off by heart, particularly c, ç, ğ and ı!

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Parkour}}
The push-up (or press-up) is a basic upper body exercise that targets many muscles in your arms and chest.

== Steps ==
# Lie down flat on the floor on your stomach
# Place your palms (hands) on the floor near your ears
# Place your toes on the floor
# Look straight ahead
# Use your arms to lift your whole body up [try to keep your back as '''straight''' as possible]
# Once arms are straight pause
# Bend arms and return down
# Stop when chest almost ''touches the ground''
# Repeat lifting and lowering

== Tips ==
* Practice. Practice everyday, doing a little more and more consecutive push-ups.
* If you feel you're too weak to perform a proper push-up, bend your knees so they touch the floor and preform a push-up in that form.
* Keep your back straight, don't arch your back up and down, use your elbows.
* Perform the exercise slowly. Don't rush, pause once you've reached the floor and slowly go back up.

== Variations ==
* '''Narrow grip push-up''': Place your palms closer together, instead of the usual shoulder-width apart. Perform a regular push-up.
* '''Wide grip push-up''': Place your palms farther apart, instead of the usual shoulder-width apart. Perform a regular push-up.
* '''One handed push-up''': Use only one hand and keep the other hand behind your back. Angle yourself, so you're weight is on that one hand but not too much or any benefit from the exercise will be ruined. Perform a regular push-up.
* '''Jump push-up''': Perform a regular push-up but when coming up, explode pushing the ground fiercely such that you perform a small jump.
* '''Diamond push-up''': Place your palms even closer than the Narrow Grip. Make a diamond with your index fingers touching and your thumbs touching. Perform a regular push-up.
* '''Military push-up''': Place your palms underneath your shoulders. Perform a regular push-up while keeping your arms pressed against your sides.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Parkour}}
The squat is a workout exercise focusing on the posterior chain, but can exercise the whole body. It doesn't require any equipment, but can be done with weights to add resistance and there are many variations.

== Steps ==
# Stand straight up, with your feet apart. The angle your feet are forming together can vary from 45 to 90 degrees. Always keep your weight on your heels.
# Lower your rear end downwards while maintaining your lower back is curved, with your butt and shoulders pointing backwards.
# Go down as far as you can, your thighs must go beyond parallel, but make sure you maintain a lumbar curve. Don't let your butt &quot;wink&quot; inwards.
# Lift yourself up, keeping your back curved.

== Tips ==
* At the beginning, use something to lift your heels higher, in order to make your squat deeper. This, however, can increase the pressure on the patella and the patellar tendon.
* Use a mirror, a video-camera, or a friend to check your form.
* You can lift your arms in front of you or over you to help your form.

Know c, ç, ğ and ı off by heart? Good, now let's move on.

===İ===
{| style=&quot;padding:0px width: 30%&quot;
|style=&quot;padding: 0em 1em 0em 0.5em&quot;|/{{IPA|i}}/||{{audio|Close front unrounded vowel.ogg|Click for sound}}||{{inline player|Close front unrounded vowel.ogg|width=50px}}
|}

This is the opposite of an {{Turkish/Letter|I}}, it's an İ! The lowercase version is a dotted i, just like in English. It's pronounced like the ee in s'''ee''', but shorter.

For example:
*{{tr/word|iyi|good}} /{{IPA|iˈji}}/
*{{tr/word|inanç|belief}} /{{IPA|iˈnɑntʃ}}/
*{{tr/word|iğne|needle}} /{{IPA|iːˈnɛ}}/

===J===
{| style=&quot;padding:0px width: 30%&quot;
|style=&quot;padding: 0em 1em 0em 0.5em&quot;|/{{IPA|ʒ}}/||{{audio|Voiced palato-alveolar sibilant.ogg|Click for sound}}||{{inline player|Voiced palato-alveolar sibilant.ogg|width=50px}}
|}
Or ''je''. Pronounced like the s in plea'''s'''ure, but a more accurate equivalent of it would be the j in the [[French]] word, '''j'''our. This letter is used in Turkish words of ''foreign origin''.

For example:
*'''jeton''' - token
*'''jilet''' - razor blade
*'''jenerik''' - (film) credits

===K===
{| style=&quot;padding:0px width: 30%&quot;
|style=&quot;padding: 0em 1em 0em 0.5em&quot;|/{{IPA|k}}/||{{audio|Voiceless velar plosive.ogg|Click for sound}}||{{inline player|Voiceless velar plosive.ogg|width=50px}}
|-
|style=&quot;padding: 0em 1em 0em 0.5em&quot;|/{{IPA|c}}/||{{audio|Voiceless palatal plosive.ogg|Click for sound}}||{{inline player|Voiceless palatal plosive.ogg|width=50px}}
|}

Or ''ke''. Pronounced like the c in '''c'''ar generally before {{Turkish/Letter|a}}, {{Turkish/Letter|ı}}, {{Turkish/Letter|o}} and {{Turkish/Letter|u}} (back vowels). Before {{Turkish/Letter|e}}, {{Turkish/Letter|i}}, {{Turkish/Letter|ö}}, {{Turkish/Letter|ü}} (front vowels) like '''K''' in Kate. But of course there some exceptions. In ''some'' words of foreign origin, even if the letter comes before {{Turkish/Letter|a}}, {{Turkish/Letter|ı}}, {{Turkish/Letter|o}} and {{Turkish/Letter|u}}, it is pronunced like '''k''' in '''K'''ate. As you will see, Turkish has no '''Q''', and therefore '''K''' is used instead of it. 

For example:
*'''kurt''' - wolf
*'''kalem''' - pencil 
*'''kağıt''' - paper - This word is of foreign origin, and '''k''' in this word is pronunced like '''K''' in '''K'''ate. Notice the pronunciation difference between ''kalem'' and ''kağıt'', ([http://translate.google.com/#tr|tr|Kalem+ve+ka%C4%9F%C4%B1t listen Google Translate pronunciation of these words])
*'''kahvaltı''' - breakfast

===L===
{| style=&quot;padding:0px width: 30%&quot;
|style=&quot;padding: 0em 1em 0em 0.5em&quot;|/{{IPA|ɫ}}/||{{audio|Velarized_alveolar_lateral_approximant.ogg|Click for sound}}||{{inline player|Velarized_alveolar_lateral_approximant.ogg|width=50px}}
|-
|style=&quot;padding: 0em 1em 0em 0.5em&quot;|/{{IPA|l}}/||{{audio|alveolar_lateral_approximant.ogg|Click for sound}}||{{inline player|alveolar_lateral_approximant.ogg|width=50px}}
|}

Or ''le''. Pronunced '''l''' in '''l'''et (clear l, {{audio|Alveolar_lateral_approximant.ogg|listen}}) before {{Turkish/Letter|e}}, {{Turkish/Letter|i}}, {{Turkish/Letter|ö}} and {{Turkish/Letter|ü}}. Before {{Turkish/Letter|a}}, {{Turkish/Letter|ı}}, {{Turkish/Letter|o}} and {{Turkish/Letter|u}} it is ''generally'' pronunced like '''l''' in '''l'''uck ([[w:dark l|dark l]], {{audio|Velarized_alveolar_lateral_approximant.ogg|listen}}). But of course there some exceptions as there are in the letter '''k'''. In some words of foreign origin, even if the letter comes before {{Turkish/Letter|a}}, {{Turkish/Letter|ı}}, {{Turkish/Letter|o}} and {{Turkish/Letter|u}}, it may be pronunced like '''l''' in '''l'''et.
*'''Did you know?''' In Turkish, words of Turkish origin doesn't start with the letter ''l''. All words ''starting'' with ''l'' are of foreign origin.

For example:
*'''lale''' (tulip) {{audio|Tur-lale.ogg|listen}}: This word is of Persian origin. Both '''l'''s in this word pronunced like '''l''' in '''l'''et
*'''kol''' (arm): '''l''' in this word is pronunced like '''l''' in '''l'''uck.
*'''lanet''' (curse): This word is of foreign origin. '''L''' in this word pronunced like '''l''' in '''l'''et.

===M===
{| style=&quot;padding:0px width: 30%&quot;
|style=&quot;padding: 0em 1em 0em 0.5em&quot;|/{{IPA|m}}/||{{audio|Bilabial nasal.ogg|Click for sound}}||{{inline player|Bilabial nasal.ogg|width=50px}}
|}
Or ''me''. Pronounced like the m in '''m'''an.

For example:
*'''masa''' - table
*'''mutfak''' - kitchen
*'''mektup''' - letter

===N===
{| style=&quot;padding:0px width: 30%&quot;
|style=&quot;padding: 0em 1em 0em 0.5em&quot;|/{{IPA|n}}/||{{audio|Alveolar nasal.ogg|Click for sound}}||{{inline player|Alveolar nasal.ogg|width=50px}}
|}
Or ''ne''. Pronounced like the n in '''n'''ow.

For example:
*'''ne''' - what
*'''nane''' - mint
*'''namus''' - honour

===O===
{| style=&quot;padding:0px width: 30%&quot;
|style=&quot;padding: 0em 1em 0em 0.5em&quot;|/{{IPA|o}}/||{{audio|Close-mid back rounded vowel.ogg|Click for sound}}||{{inline player|Close-mid back rounded vowel.ogg|width=50px}}
|}
Pronounced like the o in '''o'''h.

For example:
*'''o''' - he/she/it
*'''otobüs''' - bus
*'''oda''' - room

===Ö===
{| style=&quot;padding:0px width: 30%&quot;
|style=&quot;padding: 0em 1em 0em 0.5em&quot;|/{{IPA|ø̞}}/||{{audio|Open-mid front rounded vowel.ogg|Click for sound}}||{{inline player|Open-mid front rounded vowel.ogg|width=50px}}
|}
Pronounced like the eu in the [[French]] word s'''eu'''l, or the ö in the [[German]] word sch'''ö'''n. There is no English equivalent, but the closest one I can think of is the i in b'''i'''rd. The exact pronounciation is made by shaping your lips to say '''o''' (as in '''o'''rgan), but saying '''e''' (as in br'''ea'''d) instead.

For example:
*'''öğle''' - noon
*'''öğretmen''' - teacher
*'''ölçü''' - measurement

===P===
{| style=&quot;padding:0px width: 30%&quot;
|style=&quot;padding: 0em 1em 0em 0.5em&quot;|/{{IPA|p}}/||{{audio|Voiceless_bilabial_plosive.ogg|Click for sound}}||{{inline player|Voiceless_bilabial_plosive.ogg|width=50px}}
|}
Or ''pe''. Pronounced like the p in '''p'''et.

For example:
*'''parça''' - piece
*'''peynir''' - cheese
*'''para''' - money

===R===
{| style=&quot;padding:0px width: 30%&quot;
|style=&quot;padding: 0em 1em 0em 0.5em&quot;|/{{IPA|ɾ}}/||{{audio|Alveolar_tap.ogg|Click for sound}}||{{inline player|Alveolar_tap.ogg|width=50px}}
|}
Or ''re''. If you're wondering, &quot;Where's Q?&quot;, in Turkish there is no letter Q.

This one's simple, just pronounce it like the [[Spanish]] and the [[Italian]]s do (roll the R), but a bit shorter.

For example:
*'''rahat''' - peaceful
*'''rakam''' - digit
*'''rakı''' - Raki (yup, the alcoholic drink)

This time it might be a good idea to learn '''i''', '''j''', and '''ö''' off by heart.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Paint.NET allows you to use layers and blending modes as the foundation for composing images.

==Layers==
You may think of &quot;layers&quot; as a stack of transparency slides that, when viewed together, form a complete image. Paint.NET displays this stack as if you were viewing it from the top and with no perspective (layers do not get &quot;smaller&quot; when they are closer to the bottom of the stack, which would place them &quot;farther away&quot;).

==Pixels and Transparency==
Every layer in Paint.NET is composed of pixels which are stored in the RGBA format. The RGB part stands for red-green-blue, and is used to store traditional color intensity. The &quot;A&quot; is for alpha and is used to store information about the transparency of a pixel. This alpha value may range from 0 (completely transparent) to 255 (completely opaque). (Other software may refer to this as ranging from 0% to 100%.) If a pixel is transparent, then pixels from the layers below will show through. Paint.NET uses a technique called alpha compositing to be able to display a layered image on a standard computer monitor.

However, transparent pixels cannot be displayed on a computer monitor. In order to simulate this Paint.NET uses a checkerboard pattern.

If you see this then it means that part of your image is transparent -- the checkerboard pattern is not actually part of the image. You may think of the checkerboard pattern as a virtual background layer, or &quot;layer zero,&quot; which is always below all layers that are shown in the Layers window. However, as previously mentioned, it is not actually part of the image. If you save the image and then view or load it with other software then the checkerboard pattern will not be there (unless, of course, if that other software also uses a checkerboard pattern to simulate transparency).

==Layers and Opacity==
While every pixel has transparency information associated with it, every layer also has an associated opacity value. The two terms are similar and in most cases can be treated as the same. You may think of a layer's opacity value as a &quot;dimmer&quot; for the alpha values of every pixel in the layer.

==Blend Modes==
A layer's blend mode specifies how it is blended with the layers below it. To change a layer's blend mode, click on the respective layer and then open its Properties (via the Layers menu, the Properties button, or by double clicking the layer).

Not all blend modes are easy to understand in classic or intuitive terms, and because of this we recommend that you experiment and make use of the forum for asking questions and getting tips. Each blend mode is described below along with an image composed of the two layers discussed previously, but with the respective blend mode selected and the opacity set to 255.

In the discussions below, the term composition will be used. This refers to the result of blending all of the layers below the current layer which is being discussed. The &quot;final&quot; composition is what you see on the screen while working with the image. However, for this discussion we need to refer to the composition as it is being composed, layer by layer.

;Normal
This is the default and standard blend mode. Each pixel in the layer is blended with the composition depending on its alpha value.

;Multiply
Each pixel component's intensity is multiplied with the pixel value in the composition. The result of using this blend mode is always pixels that are darker than the original. White pixels have no effect and are thus effectively transparent. 

;Additive
Each pixel's color intensity is added to the intensity of the pixel values in the composition. This will always brighten pixels in the composition, except for pixels that are completely black which will be effectively transparent.

;Color Burn
:This blend mode has the effect such that dark pixels are made darker. Lighter pixels must be blended with other lighter pixels in order to remain bright.

;Color Dodge
:This can be thought of as the opposite of Color Burn. Lighter pixels are kept light, whereas darker pixels must be blended with other dark pixels in order to remain dark.

;Reflect
:This blend mode can be used for adding shiny objects or areas of light. 

;Glow
This is the reverse of the Reflect mode: it works the same as swapping the layer positions and using Reflect.

;Overlay
This is a combination of Screen and Multiply depending on the intensity of the layer pixel. For darker colors, this acts like Multiply. For lighter colors, this acts like Screen.

;Difference
The counterpart to Additive. The layer pixel's intensity is subtracted from the composition pixel's intensity resulting in darker colors. Since this can produce a negative intensity, which is not possible to display, the absolute value is used. Thus, both &quot;white minus black&quot; and &quot;black minus white&quot; will both produce white. This is quite often useful when using the Clouds effect.

;Negation
:At first glance this seems similar to Difference, but it actually produces the opposite effect. Instead of making colors darker, it will make them brighter.

;Lighten
:The lighter pixel of either the layer or the composition is used.

;Darken
:The darker pixel of either the layer or the composition is used.

;Screen
&quot;This can be thought of as the opposite of the Multiply blend mode. It is used to make pixels brighter, with black being effectively transparent. 

;Xor
:This is short for &quot;exclusive OR&quot;, which is an advanced blending mode that is primarily used for image analysis and not for drawing or image composition.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Turkish/Navigation|Pronunciation and Alphabet/Vowel Classifications and Harmony|Pronunciation and Alphabet/İ-R|up=Pronunciation and Alphabet}}
Now that you've learnt everything up to and including r, let's learn the rest of the alphabet:

===S===
{| style=&quot;padding:0px width: 30%&quot;
|style=&quot;padding: 0em 1em 0em 0.5em&quot;|/{{IPA|s}}/||{{audio|Voiceless alveolar sibilant.ogg|Click for sound}}||{{inline player|Voiceless alveolar sibilant.ogg|width=50px}}
|}
Or ''se''. Pronounced like the s in '''s'''ee.

For example:
*'''soğan''' - onion
*'''salam''' - salami (a Turkish delicacy)
*'''sel''' - flood

===Ş===
{| style=&quot;padding:0px width: 30%&quot;
|style=&quot;padding: 0em 1em 0em 0.5em&quot;|/{{IPA|ʃ}}/||{{audio|Voiceless_palato-alveolar_sibilant.ogg|Click for sound}}||{{inline player|Voiceless_palato-alveolar_sibilant.ogg|width=50px}}
|}
Or ''şe''. Pronounced like the sh in '''sh'''out.

For example:
*'''şey''' - thing
*'''şarap''' - wine
*'''şişe''' - bottle

===T===
{| style=&quot;padding:0px width: 30%&quot;
|style=&quot;padding: 0em 1em 0em 0.5em&quot;|/{{IPA|t}}/||{{audio|Voiceless_alveolar_plosive.ogg|Click for sound}}||{{inline player|Voiceless_alveolar_plosive.ogg|width=50px}}

===U===
{| style=&quot;padding:0px width: 30%&quot;
|style=&quot;padding: 0em 1em 0em 0.5em&quot;|/{{IPA|u}}/||{{audio|Close back rounded vowel.ogg|Click for sound}}||{{inline player|Close back rounded vowel.ogg|width=50px}}

For example:
*'''uçak''' - plane
*'''ucuz''' - cheap
*'''ufak''' - small

===Ü===
{| style=&quot;padding:0px width: 30%&quot;
|style=&quot;padding: 0em 1em 0em 0.5em&quot;|/{{IPA|y}}/||{{audio|Close front rounded vowel.ogg|Click for sound}}||{{inline player|Close front rounded vowel.ogg|width=50px}}

Pronounced just like the [[German]] ü, or the u in the [[French]] expression, &quot;j'ai perd'''u'''&quot;.

For example:
*'''ürün''' - product

|}
Pronounced like the v in '''v'''ase.

For example:

Where's the w and x? Turkish also doesn't have these letters. Y is pronounced like the y in in '''y'''ou.

For example:
*'''yarın''' - tomorrow
*'''yarım''' - half
*'''yukarı''' - above

===Z===

|}
The final letter of the Turkish alphabet. Pronounced like the z in '''z'''oo.

For example:
*'''zeytin''' - olive
*'''zil''' - bell
*'''zehir''' - poison

So, you've managed to learn the alphabet! Well done! Before you move on to the real lessons, though, please take a look at a useful grammatical note by clicking &quot;'''next'''&quot; below.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&quot;That would be his &quot;style&quot; - to hide a horcrux right under Dumbledore's nose.&quot; It would? I don't recall Voldy hiding things in plain sight. [[User:PrePressChris|PrePressChris]] 20:54, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

:Not in plain sight, no... but more bearding your enemy by making a hiding place in his house, and hiding it there, believing that it will not be found. Defiance, as in &quot;I know your home even better than you do.&quot; [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 22:46, 13 August 2007 (UTC)

== Analysis first paragraph ==

Is the first paragraph of the analysis section perhaps a bit to revealing in that it pushes very hard in the direction of spoilers?  This is just a personal opinion and I would like to hear other people's thoughts. [[User:RunningBlind|RunningBlind]] ([[User talk:RunningBlind|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/RunningBlind|contribs]]) 05:17, 28 November 2011 (UTC)
:A very good question. Likely I put that in there some few years back; quite possibly I was showboating, showing off how much I knew about the story. I would not be averse to having that moved to GP and combined with the appropriate paragraph of the greater picture. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 07:09, 28 November 2011 (UTC)
::Maybe just making it less openly revealing rather than completely removing it from the section would be better because it is still appropriate to mention it in analysis just not to the extent that it is almost giving away a major plot point. [[User:RunningBlind|RunningBlind]] ([[User talk:RunningBlind|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/RunningBlind|contribs]]) 01:52, 29 November 2011 (UTC)
:::I'm going to tweak the paragraph to make the spoilers less apparent and rather just reference the relevant information found so far in the book. [[User:RunningBlind|RunningBlind]] ([[User talk:RunningBlind|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/RunningBlind|contribs]]) 00:37, 2 December 2011 (UTC)
::::That's actually the overall plan of attack. Analysis should be the current chapter in light of what has gone before; Greater Picture is for the chapter in the light of the entire book and the entire story arc. The specific issues you mentioned should be kept, but moved to Greater Picture, merged with what is already there.

Launched in 2004 as a replacement for the [[Used Car Buyer's Guide/Chevrolet Metro]], which was axed in 2000, this was Chevrolet's
&quot;supermini&quot;. Based on the Daewoo Kalos sold elsewhere in the world (in Europe it's a Daewoo and a Chevrolet!), it was European-styled,
and Euro-designed too, but was built in South Korea.

Unlike its predecessor, it was a five-door hatchback only, but a four-door saloon was available as well.

==Trim levels==
The Aveo came in base and + trim levels. The base trim level was plain, and rather spartan, so avoid this version.

==Engines==
One engine was available, a 1.6-litre/103hp 4-cylinder. It's OK, and not as thrashy for a car this size.

==Other variants==
*[[Used Car Buyer's Guide/Suzuki Swift +|Suzuki Swift+]]
*[[Used Car Buyer's Guide/Pontiac Wave|Pontiac Wave]]

[[Image:Tadpoles 10 days.jpg|190px|thumb||10 days: Tadpoles]]
[[Image:Frog-Zhe.jpg||190px|thumb|8&amp;ndash;12 weeks: Froglet]]
[[Image:Green-leopard-frog-in-swamp.jpg||190px|thumb|12&amp;ndash;16 weeks: Adult frog]]
The life cycle of frogs, like that of other amphibians, consists of four main stages: egg, tadpole, metamorphosis and adult. The reliance of frogs on an aquatic environment for the egg and tadpole stages gives rise to a variety of breeding behaviours that include the well-known mating calls used by the males of most species to attract females to the bodies of water that they have chosen for breeding. Some frogs also look after their eggs—and in some cases even the tadpoles—for some time after laying.

The life cycle of a frog starts with an egg. Eggs are generally laid in water, and an individual female may lay egg masses containing thousands of eggs.  While the length of the egg stage depends on the species and environmental conditions, aquatic eggs generally hatch within one week.

Some frogs do not have the tadpole stage going from egg to adult shape e.g. New Zealand's native frogs (pepeketua) belong to the genus Leiopelma.
Eggs hatch and continue life as tadpoles (occasionally known as polliwogs). Tadpoles are aquatic, lack front and hind legs, and have gills for brething and tails with fins for swimming. Tadpoles are typically herbivorous, feeding mostly on algae, including diatoms that are filtered from the water through the gills. Some species are carnivorous at the tadpole stage, eating insects, smaller tadpoles and fish. The tadpole stage may be as short as a week, or tadpoles may overwinter and metamorphosis the following year in some species, such as the Midwife toad (''Alytes obstetricans'') and the Common Spadefoot (''Pelobates fuscus'').

At the end of the tadpole stage, frogs undergo metamorphosis, in which they transition into adult form. Metamorphosis involves a dramatic transformation of body shape and function, as tadpoles develop hind legs and then front legs, lose their gills and develop lungs.  Their intestines shorten as they shift from an herbivorous to a carnivorous diet. The final stage of development from froglet to adult frog involves the loss of the tail.

After metamorphosis, young adults may leave the water and disperse into terrestrial habitats, or continue to live in the aquatic habitat as adults. Almost all species of frogs are carnivores as adults, eating invertebrates such as spiders, insects, snails, and slugs.  A few of the larger species may eat prey such as small mammals, fish and smaller frogs. Some frogs use their sticky tongues to catch fast-moving prey, while others capture their prey and force it into their mouths with their hands. However, there are a very few species of frogs that primarily eat plants. Adult frogs are themselves preyed upon by birds, large fish, snakes, otters, foxes, badgers, coatis, and other animals.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''When most first-time visitors think of the Lone Star State, their heads are filled with visions straight out of old spaghetti-western movies, complete with rolling tumbleweeds, cacti, scrub brush and hot, sandy plains that stretch for miles. If that’s the kind of Texas you’re looking for, then the Big Bend Country region is the perfect place.'''
----
Most of this area’s landscape is covered by the Chihuahuan Desert, filled with the aforementioned landscape. But, this remarkable area can also blossom with startling beauty after just a little rain. The desert is populated with mountains, valleys and plains, so it has a variety of terrain and climates, and its rugged beauty must be seen to be truly admired.
----
The region is bordered by Mexico to the south, and New Mexico to the west, and stretches as far as Midland-Odessa to the northeast and Del Rio to the southeast. And just like its rich scenery, the Big Bend region is filled with history, culture and, perhaps, even a bit of infamy. It’s been home to two presidents, at least one famous musician, one of the world’s largest telescopes, a comic character, Texas’ highest peak, Texas’ oldest mission, the world’s largest jackrabbit statue and so much more.
----
This is the place to get away from it all. Embrace the great outdoors and get lost in the wide open spaces and mountains. With almost 1,170,000 acres of wilderness terrain, Big Bend Country beckons nature lovers who are looking for an epic experience. Opportunities abound to hike, bike, ride, bird, swim, raft, camp, photograph, paint and just relax in the desert wilderness.
----
Plan to spend time exploring Guadalupe Mountains National Park, home of the state’s highest point and one of the state’s most beautiful spots - McKittrick Canyon. Expect to make an extended visit or several trips to Texas’ first national park - Big Bend National Park - because it is about the size of Rhode Island and there is too much to see in a single day or on a short trip. See rolling sand dunes and one of the nation’s largest oak forests, which is not readily apparent because the mature trees seldom show more than three feet above ground, at Monahans Sandhills State Park. Visit Balmorhea State Park to take a dip in one of the largest man-made pools in the United States.
----
Big Bend Country is also a place to learn more about how life was lived on the open frontier and in the Old West. More than 100 years ago pioneers, cowboys and gold seekers traversed this area. The sometimes hostile conditions led to the need for such sites as Fort Bliss, Fort Davis and Fort Stockton to protect pioneers and travelers. Visit the forts and seek out other monuments to the past that helped shape the frontier. Numerous museums throughout the region are dedicated to preserving the heritage and history of life on the frontier.
----
This region hosted its share of gunfights, bank robberies, saloons and boom towns. It became the final resting place for many a gunfighter. Langtry is home to the rustic saloon, courtroom, billiard hall and opera house of Judge Roy Bean, the “Law West of the Pecos.” However, if you want to see Bean’s final resting place, you have to travel to the grounds of the Whitehead Memorial Museum in Del Rio.
----
El Paso, the largest United States city on the Mexican border, combines the past with the future and some of the best of both sides of the border. Tour historic sites, visit the Tigua Indian Reservation at Ysleta, hear a concert or watch a performance at the Chamizal National Memorial, take a trip across the border to Ciudad Juarez, or enjoy any of the multitude of activities available here.
----
This region is also home to unique experiences like seeing the unexplained Marfa Lights, enjoying the Terlingua chili cook-offs, seeing Shakespeare productions at the Globe of the Great Southwest theater in Odessa, eating a Pecos cantaloupe, hunting precious minerals at Woodward Agate Ranch in Alpine, and celebrating the music of Roy Orbison in his hometown of Wink.
----
One thing to remember before heading into this region: People can drive for miles with only the desert landscape for company. To help plan your adventure, use the information on the cities/towns, and their respective attractions. And, once you choose your destination and schedule your trip, you’re sure to be awed and inspired with the overwhelming appeal of the Big Bend Country!

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

This book is for anyone who is interested in some of the basic principles behind what chemical engineers do and how they can use powerful tools from physics to solve problems involving steady-state processes. It starts with a knowledge of algebra, chemistry, and some physics, and builds on current knowledge towards more practical problems. The ultimate goal is to obtain a book containing information about all of the major processes a chemical engineer may encounter as well as some insight into their analysis, which is essential for design.

The book is designed as an introduction to the subject and therefore tends to stay away from the more complicated mathematics, as the relatively steady-state black box analysis can be difficult enough for students (and teachers!) to solve.

== Invitation to Contribute ==

As this is a Wiki, anyone who wants to (and who is willing to have their work released under GFDL) is more than welcomed to contribute what they know towards the betterment of the book, or to make suggestions on the talk pages. 

== Suggested Format of this book ==

This book attempts to make liberal use of examples, and uses some images (flowcharts) to illustrate the processes described, as a standard against which the student can compare their own. This is essential since drawing flowcharts is a fundamental skill for any engineer, not just a chemical engineer. Unit conversions of various types, and use of a variety of information from a variety of sources will also be stressed.

Example problems (but usually not solutions except for simple problems) are set off with the template &lt;nowiki&gt; {{example| [problem goes here]}} &lt;/nowiki&gt;, which looks like this:

{{example|The production of ethanol is an example of a process that uses multiple unit operations. Sugar, water and nutrient are fed into a fermenter, and the resulting liquid is then distilled to produce alcohol. The fermenter must be cooled in order to maintain the correct temperature for fermentation.}}

If it seems like one of the pages is missing something, use the &lt;nowiki&gt; {{todo| [stuff to do]}} &lt;/nowiki&gt; template, which looks like this:

{{todo|Draw a process flow diagram that describes the system, clearly defining the system boundary.

How many inputs and outputs does the system contain based on the information above?}}

Notes about something special that someone must know to solve problems can be set aside using the template &lt;nowiki&gt; {{NOTE| [things to note] }} &lt;/nowiki&gt; which looks like this:

{{NOTE|Is this system and open or closed system?}}

Final results for examples as well as the results of derivations should be boxed using the &lt;nowiki&gt; {{box| [equation]}} &lt;/nowiki&gt; template, which looks like this:

{{box|[equation]}}

Finally, if you want to write a problem for the student to work out on their own, use the &lt;nowiki&gt; {{problem|'''#.''' [Problem Statement]}} &lt;/nowiki&gt; template which looks like this:

{{problem|'''#.''' [Problem Statement]}}

Using these to set the parts of the book apart, it is hoped that the experience will be easier to follow for the student.

      <comment>/* For Each loop */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">
There are several kinds of looping structures in VB.NET.

Loops allow you to repeat an action for a number of times or until a specified condition is reached.

==Do...Loop Until loop==

A Do...Loop Until loop is a loop that runs until the loop's condition is true, the condition being checked after each iteration of the loop.


'''Sample:'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
 Do 
      ' Loop code here
 Loop Until condition
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

==Do...Loop While loop==
A Do...Loop While loop runs until the loop's condition becomes false. Its condition is checked after each iteration of the loop.

'''Sample:'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
 Do
      ' Loop code here
 Loop While condition
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
==Do Until...Loop loop==
A Do Until...Loop loop is almost the same as a Do...Loop Until loop. The only difference is that it has the condition's check at the beginning of each iteration of the loop. 

'''Sample:'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
 Do Until condition
      ' Loop code here
 Loop
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
==Do While...Loop loop==
Likewise, a Do While...Loop loop is almost the same as a Do...Loop While loop. And like the Do Until...Loop loop, the condition's check is at the beginning of each iteration.

'''Sample:'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
 Do While condition
      ' Loop code here
 Loop
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
==For loop==
A For loop iterates a certain number of times, the value of the counter variable changing each iteration.  The For loop is the most well-known looping statement and useful in many programs.
A For loop looks like this this:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
 For a = 1 To 10
      ' Loop code here
 Next
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
will loop 10 times, since on the first iteration, a would equal 1, the second iteration 2, etc.

A For loop such as this one:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
 For a = 10 To 1 Step -1
      ' Loop code here
 Next
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
will loop 10 times, but the counter starts at 10 and goes down to 1.

A For loop like this one:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
 For a = 11 To 20
      ' Loop code here
 Next
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
will also loop 10 times. The counter would start at 11 then stops when it reaches 20 .

==For Each loop==
A For Each loop iterates over every index of an array or other iterable object. It requires an object to iterate through, and a variable to hold an index's contents. The object to iterate must implement the &lt;code&gt;IEnumerable&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;IEnumerator&lt;/code&gt; interfaces. The implementation of &lt;code&gt;IList&lt;/code&gt; by &lt;code&gt;Array&lt;/code&gt; allows arrays to be used as an object, because &lt;code&gt;IList&lt;/code&gt; inherits from &lt;code&gt;IEnumerable&lt;/code&gt;.

'''Sample:'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
 Dim arr As Integer() = { 1, 2, 3 }
 Dim i As Integer
 For Each i In arr
      ' During each iteration of the For Each loop, i will assume one of three values:
      ' 1, 2, or 3 as integers.
 Next i
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">With a single reed instrument, double tonguing is very hard to do efficiently. That includes that clarinet. With that said, double tonguing is a skill that will not work well on the clarinet. However, it does have its benefits. . If you are up to the challenge of double tonguing, here is how to do it. 

*Just like you can demonstrate tonguing by saying &quot;ta-ta-ta-ta-ta&quot;, etc., yo can demonstrate double tonguing by saying &quot;tu-gu-tuh-ga-tuh-ga-tuh-ga-tuh-ga&quot;, etc.
*Go back in forth between saying tuh and guh. Do it enough to get used to it. &quot;tuh kuh tuh kuh tuh kuh tuh kuh&quot; 
*Just put you instrument up to your mouth and blow saying &quot;tuh kuh tuh kuh tuh kuh&quot;. 
*This might take some practice.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Ask your self, what is the most important part of the clarinet? The answer, your brain. Even though it is not part of the instrument, it is where all the music happens. If there is nothing going on inside your brain, then you are not going to be playing anything. Music is inside you, not your instrument. Your instrument is just a megaphone on what music you are thinking of in your brain. Apart from your brain, your mouthpiece is a microphone that distributes your music into the instrument; therefore, you need a good mouth piece to get the music out of your head and into the instrument. You need a clean, crisp, and clear sounding mouthpiece. Mouthpieces are made out of plastic, hard rubber, wood, and even quartz crystal.

*The plastic ones are of lower quality, and produce an amateur clarinet sound. They are at the cheapest price (around $20.00) and are good for beginners (from year 1-4). Most plastic clarinets come with a plastic mouth piece when purchased. On the plastic mouth piece, the hole is smaller than of a better mouth piece. The bigger the hole, the more air can go through it, and the more air, the better your sound quality is.

*Next up is a rubber mouth piece. They have a much better tone quality then a plastic mouth piece, and have a bigger hole. (WARNING, NEVER WASH A RUBBER MOUTH PIECE UNDER HOT WATER. IT WILL TURN GREEN, AND TASTE LIKE YOU JUST LICKED A CAR TIRE!) They can range from $50-whatever you want to pay for. If you are looking into becoming a great clarinet player, invest into a good mouth piece.

If you  have a plastic mouth piece, and a very good instrument, that is like buying a cheesy microphone, and buying a very expensive speaker system. It does not make sense. For the instrument to work to its full extent, invest into a good mouth piece. If you feel that your instrument is not producing a good enough tone, it may be because of the mouth piece. Or it could be your ligature, or how your clarinet is positioned, or your mouth.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Smalltalk has one of the simpler syntaxes of any computer language. There are 3 different types of method call - unary, binary, and n-way keyword. The rules for precedence scan from left to right for each of those 3 flavors of method calling. Precedence can be overridden with parenthesis, as usual.

1. Unary method. Can be as simple as '''display redrawEverything.''' ; the object '''display''' looks up it's method to do an unqualified redraw, and does it. Unary methods and the object they act on are both alphanumeric words that don't end in a colon. Whenever you see multiple such words in a row, the one on the left is the object, the rest are a gauntlet of method calls. 

2. Binary method. In '''myNumber + 5.''', the object '''myNumber''' is told to look up the method '''+''', and run it with 5 as the argument. Here, the argument is being discarded, the ''':=''' assignment will come later. Binary method names are 1 or 2 special characters; they only exist for the usual set of suspects in math and logic equations. There is no special precedence for math operators, you must either state them in the order wanted, or use parenthesis.

3. Keyword method. This is where smalltalk diverges from most other programming languages. In '''display drawFromX:1 fromY:1 toX:50 toY:100.''', display is being called with one method and 4 arguments. The method's name is '''drawFromX:fromY:toX:toY:''', and the arguments are positionally passed into the method. If you want to call another keyword method without the two blending together, you can use the comma operator, parenthesis, or just carry the result to a new statement.

A statement optionally starts with an assignment, has at least an opening object, and sends at least one method to that object. The statement ends with a period.

A '''[block]''' is a bracketed set of statements that are bundled together as a single object, which could be triggered by flow-control style methods. In '''4 &lt; 5 ifTrue: [ Transcript print:'4 is less than 5!' ].''' , 4&lt;5 evaluates into the boolean object '''True''', who always executes a block passed through the '''ifTrue:''' method.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Smalltalk uses variables in the usual Object Oriented way, you move around pointers to data more often than the actual data. A variable is a pointer to an object, through which you could ask that object to report its data, change its data, or perform an action. Care must be taken when altering an object, it may affect other variables pointing to that object elsewhere. 

There are different degrees of variable at the system, object, and method levels. 

The  SystemDictionary '''Smalltalk''' holds onto the globally accessible variables. These can be easily called upon anywhere, common singleton objects like '''transcript''' are named here.

In their class definition, objects have a given set of variables defined. Any object instance can look at its own variables within a method (subclass methods too). If a variable needs to be altered externally, the object may have methods to get the variable in and out. 

Smalltalk variable names are declared in the beginning of a method or block separated by the pipe &quot;|&quot; symbol.
Example: &lt;code&gt;| t1 t2 t3 |&lt;/code&gt; declares three variables named t1, t2, and t3.

To assign a value to a variable, use this format: &lt;code&gt;variableName := value&lt;/code&gt; or this format: &lt;code&gt;variableName _ value&lt;/code&gt;.

Arrays also can be variables. Arrays can hold any type of value. An array if defined like this: &lt;code&gt;#('Put array items here')&lt;/code&gt;. Example: &lt;code&gt;#('string' $C 6)&lt;/code&gt; Makes an array with three values that contain a the string &quot;string&quot;, the character 'C', and the number 6.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Program flow within a method is managed with [blocks]. A block is an object containing some smalltalk code, and it can be sent methods to accomplish any program flow needed. Outside of a single method body, program flow is decided  in sending the same method to dissimilar objects; the classic example is to send a circle to either to a monitor, printer, or X/Y plotter.

Please feel free to replace the following examples with something less..pointless. 

'''1 to: 5 do: [num| transcript print:num].''' - putting a flow control method like '''to:do:''' inside a '''Number''' class may seem a little funny, but it makes this easy to express.

'''num &gt; 5 ifTrue: [num:=1] ifFalse: [num:=num+1].''' - feel free to split the ifTrues and ifFalses across different lines.

'''[num &lt; 5 ] whileTrue: [num:=num+1. transcript print:'embiggen!'].''' Yes, a block can be the opening object in a statement.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Rarely an issue. Like any honest Object Oriented language, Smalltalk is garbage collected, so many types of memory leaks just can't happen. Inappropriately excessive and unkempt cross referencing can lead to memory becoming unfreeable, and runaway loops can exhaust memory as usual.

'''''Chamaecyparis''''' is genus of conifers in the family Cupressaceae, native to eastern Asia and western and eastern North America. It is one of several genera within the Cupressaceae that have the common name '''cypress'''. Synonyms include ''Retinispora'' Siebold &amp; Zucc. and ''Retinospora'' Carr.

There are a great number of cultivars available among the species with a wide range of shapes, sizes, and leaf colors.

==Description==
They are medium-sized to large evergreen trees growing to 20-70 m tall, with foliage in flat sprays. The leaves are of two types, needle-like juvenile leaves on young seedlings up to a year old, and scale-like adult leaves. The cones are globose to oval, with 8-14 scales arranged in opposite decussate pairs; each scale bears 2-4 small seeds.

==Growing conditions==
Four species (''C. lawsoniana, C. obtusa, C. pisifera'', and ''C. thyoides'') are of considerable importance as ornamental trees in horticulture; several hundred cultivars have been selected for various traits, including dwarf size, yellow, blue, silvery or variegated foliage, permanent retention of juvenile leaves, and thread-like shoots with reduced branching. In some areas, cultivation is limited by ''[[../Phytophthora/]]'' root rot diseases, with ''C. lawsoniana'' being particularly susceptible to ''[[../Phytophthora lateralis/]]''.

==Species==
There are five or six species, depending on taxonomic opinion:
*''[[../Chamaecyparis formosensis/]]''. Taiwan.
*''[[../Chamaecyparis lawsoniana/]]''. Western North America.
*''[[../Chamaecyparis obtusa/]]''. Japan.
*''[[../Chamaecyparis pisifera/]]''. Japan.
*''[[../Chamaecyparis taiwanensis/]]''. Taiwan.
*''[[../Chamaecyparis thyoides/]]''. Eastern North America.

''C. taiwanensis'' is treated by many authors as a variety of ''C. obtusa'' (as ''C. obtusa'' var. ''formosana''). 

Another species which used to be included in this genus, as ''Chamaecyparis nootkatensis'', has now been transferred on the basis of strong genetic and morphological evidence to the separate genus ''[[../Callitropsis/]]'' as ''[[../Callitropsis nootkatensis/]]'', or back to ''Cupressus nootkatensis'' (the name it was originally described under in 1824).

==Uses==
The wood is scented, and is highly valued, particularly in Japan, where it is used for temple construction.

==Maintenance==
Pruning can be done in winter. Most species tolerate shearing and can be grown as hedges or topiaries.

==Propagation==
Cuttings, grafting, or seed.

==Pests and diseases==
'''[[../Blight/]]:'''
*''[[../Phomopsis juniperovora/]]''
*Seiridium or Coryneum Blight and Canker: ''[[../Seiridium cardinale/]]''
'''[[../Root Rot/]]'''
*''[[../Phytophthora lateralis/]]'' Problem in Pacific Northwest.
*''[[../Phytophthora cinnamomi/]]''
'''[[../Rusts/]]'''
*Witches Broom (Rust): ''[[../Gymnosporangium ellisii/]]'', Alternate hosts in ''[[../Myrica/]]'' and ''[[../Comptonia/]]''
*Spindle Burl Gall (Rust): ''[[../Gymnosporangium biseptatum/]]'', Alternate host in ''[[../Amalanchier/]]''
'''[[../Scales/]]'''
*Juniper Scale: ''[[../Carulaspis juniperi/]]''
'''[[../Weevils/]]'''
*Arborvitae Weevil: ''[[../Phyllobius intruscus/]]''
'''[[../Caterpillars/]]'''
*Imperial Moth: ''[[../Eacles imperiales/]]''
*Bagworm: ''[[../Thyridopterix ephemeraeformis/]]''
'''[[../Mites/]]'''
*Spruce Spider Mite: ''[[../Oligonychus ununguis/]]''
''Chamaecyparis'' species are used as food plants by the larva of some Lepidoptera species including [[w:Juniper Pug]] and [[w:Pine Beauty]].

== Catullus ==

Hi! Thanks for your warm welcome on my talk page. I am mainly at Wikipedia (under the same username) but I have (very occasionally) edited pages here. That's cool that we study the same courses. Hope to see you round, [[User:Storeye|Storeye]] 08:12, 11 May 2007 (UTC)

== hey, can I help? ==

Hi there:

I teach AP Latin and would love (over the summer, when I have more time) to help out with translations, commentary, whatever.  What d'ya say?

I am wiki-stupid, so if you'd like my help, please contact me at colegrover@yahoo.com.

Vale!
Catherine

== not wiki-mad, wiki-stupid! ==

Hey again:

Right.  When I said &quot;stupid&quot; I meant stupid (isn't that a Beastie Boys lyric?).  Like I wouldn't have figured out how to contact you if my b/f hadn't helped me.  That stupid.  But I am Latin-smart.

Anyway, it'll take me a while how to figure out (and by that I mean it'll take the b/f a while to teach me) how to put what you need in a format that you can use, but I'm happy to add what I can.  Again, I won't be able to do much of anything till summer (after June 26).  

Here's how I found your stuff:  I was making up my AP audit syllabus (I'd be happy to rant on that topic sometime if you'd like - although I have no idea why anyone outside the wretched process would want to hear about it) and needed to know how many lines were in each poem, so I just googled that and found you.  

I don't IM, but you can contact me via email at colegrover@yahoo.com.

Ciao for now,
Catherine

== Poetry Book ==

I've been reading your Catullus book, and i'm very impressed! it's a very good book, and one of immediate educational value. You are right that it is well on it's way to being a featured book around here, and once the majority of poems are uploaded (people dont like red links) and annotated, we can nominate it to be featured. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] ([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) 22:08, 14 May 2007 (UTC)

:I watch the RC feed here, looking for vandalism. It would take a blind person not to notice all the activity on your book. I've added it to a bookshelf: [[Wikibooks:Language_and_literature_bookshelf#Fiction_annotations|HERE]]. 
:I took Latin in highschool for a few years, and we read some catullus. I'll keep track of the page myself, so you don't need to go out of your way to update me. If you need any help with Wikibooks in general, i'm a good resource. 
:PS. your signature points to [[Usertalk:Alakazam38]], not [[User talk:Alakazam38]] (notice the space between &quot;User&quot; and &quot;talk&quot;. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] ([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) 22:26, 14 May 2007 (UTC)

== Preview ==

I wrote an intro in the preview red link, but I'm afraid I really didn't know what you intended to put there. I've said the purpose of the book and a bit about Catullus's writing and added a few pictures. Please delete anything that isn't meant to be there and add anything that is. Cheers!

On another note, are the &quot;Connotations of the Text&quot; sections supposed to contain grammar notes? [[User:Storeye|Storeye]] 08:09, 17 May 2007 (UTC)
==Joining the Project==
Hi there! I'd love to sign on to help out with Catullus. If there are any poems that you feel are a priority to complete, please feel free to drop me a line. I will most likely start off adding Wiktionary entries for any glossed words. [[User:Medellia|Medellia]] 17:39, 18 May 2007 (UTC)
: I'm excited to get to work! A quick question first, though: would you like scansion for every poem? It would be easy enough to go through and take care of that. [[User:Medellia|Medellia]] 23:56, 19 May 2007 (UTC)
== Poem 64, scansion, &amp;c. ==
''Carmen'' 64 is composed in hexameters, so it's actually one of his more boring poems - metrically speaking. (I can't recall any spondaic lines, but they would certainly be worth noting.) I think one of the easiest things to do would be to make mention of the type of meter used in each poem as your meter page does an excellent job of explaining those. Would you find it appropriate to simply include that in the same place as the scansion notes? [[User:Medellia|Medellia]] 20:37, 20 May 2007 (UTC)

==Bonaeludae: I would love to Join==
Alakazam38. I am sorry it has taken me so long to respond but I have just now returned to school. I would absolutely love to become a more permanent part of the project. If you will still have me that is. I have a passion for the poetry of Catullus. This year I was unable to schedule any form of Latin into my class roster. I would love to contribute and work some more on this book. It would give me a chance to immerse myself in Latin. Respond to me when you can. --[[User:Bonaeludae|Bonaeludae]] 06:01, 8 October 2007 (UTC)

== Bonaeludae: Thank you. ==

I would appreciate being added as a permanent contributer :)
I am still working on it every other day. College applications are, of course, a lot of fun. :P
--[[User:Bonaeludae|Bonaeludae]] 03:54, 16 October 2007 (UTC)

== *finally* getting back to Catullus ==

Hi again:

As per the subject line, I'd like to start contributing to the project with the help of some of my advanced students. We'll have a lot of time this week to do some commentary, etc. and I'd like to focus on poems 36 and 40 if that's okay with you. I chose those two since it seemed a manageable amount, they haven't been done at all so far and they are two that my students have read. I'll assume it's okay if I don't hear from you otherwise.

I'm in Ft. Wayne Indiana USA btw. Where in England are you?

Also, thanks for the tips on formatting, that's probably going to be the toughest thing for us to get used to.

Well, here's hoping that we can be of some use to the project!

Best, Catherine

== new contributor? ==

Hello,

I'm a freshman in college with 5 years of Latin.  As you can see, I've done quite a bit of work (at least it felt like it was a lot of work) on Catullus 1, and at least by the criteria on your page, that poem is finished. (please let me know how the commentary is).  I'd like to help out regularly on this project, but from a glance at the project news, it seems like things aren't happening anymore...  Is this still going?  If so, I'd love to help.  To respond, I suppose you can go to my (as yet unwritten-on) talk page.  I'm just now figuring out wiki (&quot;wiki-stupid?&quot;), so there will be a bit of a learning curve, I expect, with my contributions.

[http://periodic.lanl.gov/default.htm Periodic Table (Los Alamos National Laboratory)]

[http://www.ualberta.ca/~jplambec/che/data/index.htm Chemical Sciences Data Tables]: Has a fair amount of useful data, including a fairly comprehensive List of Standard Entropies, and Gibbs Energies at 25oC (also a list for ions), a chart with molar masses of the elements, acid equilibrium constants, solubility products, and electric potentials. Definitely one to check out.

[http://webbook.nist.gov/chemistry/fluid/ NIST properties]: You can look up properties of many common substances, including water, many light hydrocarbons, and many gases. Data available can include density, enthalpy, entropy, Pitzer accentric factor, surface tension, Joule-Thompson coefficients, and several other variables depending on the substance and conditions selected. To see the data in tabular form, once you enter the temperature and pressure ranges you want, click &quot;view table&quot; and then select the property you want from the pull-down menu. It'll tell you acceptable ranges.

[http://www3.me.iastate.edu/me330_colver/new_page_2.htm Generalized compressibility chart]: This is very useful in the section on gases and liquids, and you should be able to find a copy of this chart in any thermodynamics book or in Perry's handbook. I've linked here so you have some clue what I'm talking about when I write about it.

Hi - could you bear in mind that Wikibooks are textbooks intended to be read as stand alone content - as such pages that essentially consist of links are not really within the project scope and may be deleted - thanks --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 18:23, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</text>

What should be done about the example of &quot;proper&quot; use of gotos... I've cleaned it up a bit so that it's actually valid C++ (explicit pointer casts), but...

* The code uses malloc/free and fprintf/stderr instead of new/delete and cerr, so it's not very sensible in a C++ wikibook.
* exceptions might be more &quot;proper&quot; in the case of C++ for that. (Admittedly, I'm not all that fond of exceptions, but meh.)
* If I recall correctly, the current standard has new throw an exception anyway instead of returning NULL, so cleaning it to be in C++-style makes the example wrong.
* Isn't it convention to just say 0 instead of NULL in C++? Not sure about that, as my native language is actually C. --[[User:Dnas|Dnas]] 03:40, 18 February 2007 (UTC)
** I've fixed it to use new/delete and cerr. I've made it use the nothrow form of new so that it returns NULL. That deals with two of the problems. While it may be true that exceptions are generally preferred over using goto, goto is allowed in C++ and so an example is still needed. IIRC, NULL is defined as being 0 in C++ and people use it for some level of compatibility with C and to make it clear that the variable is a pointer without having to search for where the variable is declared. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 15:12, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

Please move the fork example to someother section as it is UNIX specific and not part of standard C/C++.
[[User:Jayaram Ganapathy|Jayaram Ganapathy]]

:I think  malloc/free and fprintf/stderr  should have a section before the goto explaining what they are since we can use them as part of the C++ (and point reasons why you shouldn't), take a look into the C Programming book and see if we can use something from it, we already have given attribution from content from there so we can copy anything we can use.
:Add info to take a look to the exception information and point to the page.
:You we should avoid NULL but some take an exception on the &quot;avoid macros&quot; on null because it is easier to remember (visually) why you used a NULL (if you do it as a rule), I myself turn every NULLs into 0s :)  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 17:39, 12 April 2007 (UTC)

:Jayaram Ganapathy, fork is the same as split it has noting to do with Unix on that context, I think you are referring to the if information.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 17:41, 12 April 2007 (UTC)

== Duplication ==
I noticed a bit of duplication: [[C Programming/Control]].  Both this page and the link share significant scope and content, but in my opinion this version seemed to skip some content.  Should we copy/paste to bring them back together, or should be work on this page to make it better? --[[User:Sigma 7|Sigma 7]] ([[User talk:Sigma 7|talk]]) 01:25, 17 January 2009 (UTC)

:It is no duplication, the pages belong to distinct books/languages, you can merge useful content into this one (we already acknowledge the C Programming book for some content) you can also take a look into the java book and other programming languages for useful content, if you do copy from them in quantity add an acknowledgment to the authors page or if creating a new page ask an administrator to merge the the edit history (similar to a transwiki request).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 19:11, 17 January 2009 (UTC)

== Clarity ==
I feel a little strange just marching in and changing text here, so would rather offer an idea for others to consider..

The text &quot;There is likely no meaningful program written in which a computer does not demonstrate basic decision-making skills.&quot; I find a bit difficult to understand as it combines negatives.  The subsequent &quot;It can actually be argued that there is no meaningful human activity in which no decision-making, instinctual or otherwise, takes place.&quot; suffers from the same.  May I suggest the boiled down: &quot;Like human activity, a computer program is arguably useless unless it exercises its ability to make decisions based upon certain conditions and, hopefully, bring some value to the world in which it exists.&quot;  --[[User:K1mgy|K1mgy]] ([[User talk:K1mgy|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/K1mgy|contribs]]) 22:05, 25 December 2011 (UTC)

:See if you are satisfied by the little change that was inspired by you more complex phrase. Note that the idea is not to show that the capability exists, but that it is mostly prevalent.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 23:25, 25 December 2011 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Topics to think about in John 6:'''
* How does the narrative relate to its Synoptic counterparts?
* Is this a part of the Gospel in its original form or an addition to the &quot;second edition&quot;?
* What is the importance of the Eucharistic background and imagery?
* What is the role of the background in Scripture of the imagery used?
* What is the significance of the fact that it is followers of Jesus who turn away because of his words in this chapter?

The timeframe between Chapter 5 and Chapter 6 is about 6 months. During this interim time, many events have occurred as recorded in Matthew and Luke, and to lesser degree in Mark:
* The 12 Apostles are chosen (Mark 3; Luke 6)
* Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5; Luke 6)
* Many miracles are performed by Jesus including healing those who are lame, blind or otherwise afflicted. (Matt 8,9,12; 
Mark 1,2; Luke 4,5,7)
* Casting out demons (Matt 8; Mark 5; Luke 8)
* Parables about the Kingdom (Matt 13; Mark 4; Luke 8)
* Calming a storm (Matt 8; Mark 4; Luke 8)
* Apostles commissioned and sent out (Matt 11; Mark 6; Luke 9)
* Beheading of John the Baptist (Matt 14; Mark 6)
 
Chapter 6 is a continuation of the ministry in which Jesus performs miracles in the communities surrounding the shores of the Sea of Galilee. The crowds passing through Galilee have increased as it is the Spring and the upcoming Passover Festival attracts large numbers of people from all over Palestine on pilgrimage to Jerusalem.
  
==The Feeding of the Five Thousand==
 The crowds in the area have heard about or witnessed His miracles, and bring Him many afflicted people to be healed. It is the end of the day and the people are all hungry with little chance of getting food in the towns. Jesus takes two fish and five loaves of bread and feeds five thousand people who have come to Jesus and his disciples.

Despite Jesus' power, John 6:6 notes that Jesus questions Philip &quot;only to test him.&quot;  The purpose of such a test could be for the reason of showing Philip where he stands in his faith, or perhaps for Jesus to lead Philip toward a greater understanding of His power.  This authority over nature shown through this miracle could have been meant as an illustration of Christ's divine power and that his abilities are one with God the Father's own.

Jesus, who in previous passages of John kept his ministry low profile, continues to escalate his works in order for more people to believe.  However, rather than taking in all of the glory with pride, he simply performs his work to lead people to God, and then parallels his previous actions (see John 5:13) of removing himself from the situation, this time taking time for Himself by a mountain (6:15). In these instances, Jesus withdrew from the crowds because His time for fully revealing Himself as Messiah had not yet come (see John 7:6). The crowds, having been fully fed, now see Jesus as a Prophet who will take David's throne and press upon Him to forcefully make Him king. (6:14-15). Jesus refrains from becoming a crowned king and withdraws. The people do not see the prophesied Suffering Messiah, but only a king who will take His coming kingdom as a literal kingdom on Earth.

Although some have speculated, due primarily because John gives no explanation for Jesus having left Jerusalem and now all of sudden being in Galilee, that chapters 5 and 6 may be out of order. However, cross-referencing the events of the other Gospels show that the early events of Chapter 6 were indeed in Galilee at the end of the Galilean ministry and that Jesus was in Galilee because of the persecution and threats to kill him that existed in Judea.  This miracle takes place in Galilee and is the only one that is recounted in all four gospels. It is interesting however that in the other three accounts of this miracle it is Jesus' disciples that are concerned about feeding the people while in Johns Gospel, Jesus is the one who inquires about their food supply and as mentioned before does it to test Philip. However this is consistent with John being an eye-witness of these events and being close enough to Jesus to see His involvement more than the disciples involvement. The boy who provides the food is also only mentioned in John, as is the fact that the bread is the &quot;bread of the poor&quot; or barley which could perhaps be a reference to 2 Kings 4 in which Elisha feeds 100 people with 20 loaves of barley (Smith pg. 147).  It might also be of importance that the bread is the primary concern of John's recounting and the fish is more of an afterthought as is evidenced by verse 13 in which the fish are not even mentioned; the explanation for this is probably that John was setting up the words of Jesus that follow this miracle pertaining to the bread of life.       

==The Crossing of the Sea==
Jesus walks on water. He didn’t leave in the boat with his disciples; instead, he walks out to meet them and joins them in the boat. Although his disciples are initially afraid of the feat that Jesus is performing, they let him in the boat and begin to realize that Jesus is not bound by the binds that hold men firmly in this world.

Jesus' walking on water is an interesting place of relationship of John with the Synoptics.  Though Luke doesn't record this miracle, Mark and Matthew both do.  The narrative of John follows Mark more closely, as it does not include any reference to Peter walking out to meet Jesus on the water.  Other than the destination of the disciples' boat, the accounts in Mark and John are quite similar, except for another sign of Jesus' power: as soon as Jesus gets into the boat in John's story, the boat reached the destination. When Jesus was walking on water toward the boat he says, &quot;It is I, do not be afraid.&quot;

In verse 16 it says; &quot;Now when evening came, His disciples went down to the sea,...&quot; (NAS) Here, we have another example of Jesus and disciples going somewhere together which inadvertently foreshadows a miracle. For instance we can look in John 2 and see the same thing in verse 2 when they were both invited to the wedding. This verse also parallels chapter 2 in that it states it was &quot;evening&quot; when His disciples came. In the same way, Nicodemus is seen coming to Jesus at night for wisdom. 
Verse 17 &quot;...and after getting into a boat, they started to cross the sea to Capernaum. And it had already become dark, and Jesus had not yet come to them.&quot;(NAS) These references to &quot;dark,&quot; &quot;evening,&quot; and &quot;night&quot; are all parallels to the other references of light and dark throughout John. Light is said to be Jesus or salvation and wisdom. Darkness seems to symbolize ignorance, doubt, satan and/or life without Jesus. This miracle of Jesus walking on water can then be another foretelling of Jesus’ soon to be glorification. Some believe that this passage is just that. When it says that Jesus had not yet come to them, this could be an allusion to Jesus being glorified through his persecution, death, resurrection, and ascension. However, most see this event as a demonstration to the apostles that Jesus is indeed the Son of God with the full authority given to Him by the Father. 

This section lends symbolism to a possibly bigger lesson.    It is also important to recognize the differences in John.  In John, the boat that the disciples are in is near the land which is unique to John.  &quot;John could be saying that with Jesus' arrival they got to land with unusual speed.  On the other hand, rationalist critics once saw here the key to the &quot;miracle&quot;&quot; Jesus was actually walking in the shallows, (Smith). However, the other Gospels do not follow this rationale making it clear that Peter would have sank and drowned in the water had Jesus not saved him from the deep.

These miracles (signs) clearly reveal Jesus as ruler over the forces of nature. In his teaching that follows and the debate it arouses, we learn that he is the foundation of eternal life (v. 22-59).

==The Bread of Life Discourse==
The way Jesus chooses to deliver this discourse is similar to the tradition of Jewish sermons.  In traditional Jewish sermons, the Rabbi would relate two different texts to each other.  Jesus does just this when some of the things he says are reminiscent of Old Testament text.  For example, Jesus says in John 6:35 &quot;Jesus said to them, 'I am the bread of life; whoever comes to me will never hunger and whoever believes in me will never thirst.'&quot;  This language of the giving of food is much like Isaiah 55:1, which states, &quot;All who are thirsty, come to the water!  You who have no money, come, receive grain, and eat; Come, without paying, and without cost, drink wine and milk!&quot;  Another similarity between Isaiah and John is between John 6:37-38 which state, &quot;Everything that the Father gives me will come to me, and I will not reject anyone who comes to me, because I came down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of the one who sent me&quot; and Isaiah 55:10-11, which state, &quot;For just as from the heavens the rain and snow come down and do not return there till they have watered the earth, making it fertile and fruitful, giving seed to him who sows and bread to him who eats, so shall my word be that goes forth from my mouth; it shall not return to me void, but shall do my will, achieving the end for which I sent it.&quot;  Furthermore, the talk of manna in John 6:31 is similar to Deuteronomy 8:3.  John 6:31 states, &quot;Our ancestors ate manna in the desert, as it is written: 'He gave them bread from heaven to eat.'&quot;  Deuteronomy 8:3 says, &quot;He humbled you and let you be hungry, and fed you with manna which you did not know, nor did your fathers know, that He might make you understand that man does not live by manna alone, but man lives by everything that proceeds out of the mouth of Yahweh.&quot;  Another important similarity is that the people in John 6:41 &quot;grumble&quot; (because Jesus said he was the bread that came down from heaven) just as the people &quot;grumbled&quot; after being fed in old Jewish scriptures when they were in the desert.  All of these similarities work together to show the readers of the Gospel of John that Jesus is continuing the work that his Father talked about earlier, and one of the only differences between this &quot;new&quot; discourse is that it is quite surprising and confusing to the people listening in John 6 that Jesus is calling ''himself'' the bread of life.  These words (vv.32,33,35,50-51, 54-58)were so extraordinary that even Christ's followers said: &quot;This is a hard saying; who can hear it?&quot; And many of them &quot;went back and walked no more with Him&quot; (vv. 60-66).  Still it is important to note that those that would &quot;walk no more&quot; were not chosen disciples.  None of the Chosen Twelve were included in this group for they still believed that He, Jesus, held the words of eternal life. This was affirmed by Peter who said of Jesus (6:69) &quot;We believe and know that you are the Holy One of God&quot;. They still believed, despite the fact that one among them was considered a devil by Jesus, meaning Judas Iscariot, the one who would betray him later.

After the people come back to find Jesus he questions them to see if they fully understand why he performed the miracle of the feeding of them.  When the people show they do not fully understand what it means to believe, Jesus explains to them what the Bread of Life is and how the people can only receive the bread of Life if they believe in the Son who is sent by the Father.  By receiving the bread in vv 51-58, ,they can eat his flesh and drink his blood, the food that has come down from heaven to nourish all of those who believe. Some see this as an allusion to the Eucharist. Jesus tells the people his wisdom (gospel) is the bread of Life they seek. This results in an argument among the people because some do not understand the meaning of (6:53) &quot;eating my flesh and drinking my blood&quot; and others previously claimed Jesus is the son of Joseph, who is known to them, and so could not be the Son of God.

In John Chapter 6, one can see the difficulty that Christ caused for the Jewish ruling council. They ignorantly thought he  advocated the consumption of His flesh (verse 53), a concept very much in conflict with the strict Jewish laws that regulated what a person could eat.  Cannibalism was definitely not condoned.  Christ used this radical example, though, to reveal the true meaning of the Law and Prophets to the Jews, a fulfillment of the law that would ultimately supersede all the previous law. He hearkened back to the Israelites as they ate manna in the desert while they followed Moses  and they died (verse 58), and used the Jews’ sense of history and tradition to further His cause.  He knew that the Jews would be familiar with the notion of ‘manna of life,’ as they had been saved by manna from heaven, and so His own example of eternally nourishing bread (His teaching).

[[Help:Welcome, newcomers|Welcome to Wikibooks]], a collection of open-content textbooks! You don't have to [[Special:Userlogin|log in]] to read or edit articles on Wikibooks, but creating an account is quick, free and non-intrusive, requires no personal information, and gives you many benefits, including:
*The use of a username of your choice
*The ability to view all your contributions via a &quot;My contributions&quot; link 
*Your own [[wikipedia:user page|user page]] 
*Your own talk page which, if you choose, also allows users to send you messages without knowing your e-mail address
*The use of your own personal [[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]] to which you can add articles that interest you
*The ability to rename pages.
*The ability to [[Special:Upload|upload images]] 
*The ability to customize the appearance and behavior of the website
*The eligibility to become an [[Help:Administrators|administrator]] 
*The right to be heard in votes and elections
*Your IP address will no longer be visible to other users.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikibookian and '''[[Special:Userlogin|create an account]]'''. Feel free to ask me any questions you may have on my talk page. By the way, make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes ('''&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;'''), which will let others know who left it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* If you're a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

Original author never really layed out a point for the book. Others have cleaned up the stuff he created a bit, but the book seems to have no point. I discussed the lack of direction in detail on the [[Talk:21am|talk page]] and have gotten no response. The author seems to have left for other ambitions. Either way, if a book on arts management needs to be created, then let it be created. But this definitely isn't it; this book is an aimless few paragraphs that I think should be scrapped. -[[User:Monk|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Monk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:Monk|talk]]&lt;/sub&gt; 07:27, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' - Quite old, going nowhere. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 01:43, 29 January 2007 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''. I agree. The book is poorly defined, doesnt have any substantial content, and it is highly unlikely that people looking for a book on this subject are going to search for the term &quot;21am&quot;. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 01:56, 29 January 2007 (UTC)
*'''Comment.''' The book has two serious problems:
*#the front page has wording that could scare away talented people -- &quot;If you're a boring arts manager with a degree, don't spoil the party.&quot; -- and
*# the name 21am is confusing. 
:These are both easily fixed. That said, there's hardly anything here. I'm no fan of this book, and I wonder whether deleting it might make it more likely that we would get a much better arts management book in the future. But this would survive a VFD no problem if not for its silly diatribe at the top. --Brian Brondel 20:17, 29 January 2007 (UTC)
*&lt;strike&gt;'''Delete''' - wrong name, POV, bugger all content, inflamatory to target readership. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:02, 30 January 2007 (UTC)&lt;/strike&gt;
**'''Keep''' - Brian Brondel's changes address my main concerns (had previously voted based on what I saw earlier, not his recent changes). Let's hope someone now addresses the lack of content. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:37, 30 January 2007 (UTC)
*'''Comment''' Aside from the introduction, I don't understand why the community has so much distaste for this particular book. I fixed the problems I mentioned earlier to illustrate the point. Why must this book go, but not, for example, [[Voter's Guide:Australia]]? Brian Brondel 02:00, 30 January 2007 (UTC)
*&lt;s&gt;While I don't think that the existence of one book can be used to justify or refute reasons for another book's existence, I too am unsure whether or not this book should be deleted. We have to ask ourselves: are we doing a potential reader ''an injustice'' by keeping this book live for anyone to see? I argue that we are not. It is not factually incorrect. It is not misleading in any other way. By leaving it here, it can improve. If someone who wants to flesh out a full arts management book, then they can certainly overhaul this one and ignore the text that is currently there, or they could just start a new one and otherwise disregard this text in its current state.&lt;/s&gt;
*&lt;s&gt;Furthermore, I think that age, relative amount of substantial content, and demand are not appropriate metrics for whether or not a book should be deleted. A book is old; so what? We don't routinely delete books by the virtue of their age. A book is a stub; so what? Someone else can develop it. A book is not in demand; so what? Just let it lie in case it ever is in demand. The name has been fixed, the POV turned NPOV, and it is now less inflammatory. If it degrades further and cannot be fixed by active contributors, i.e. ''us'', then I would argue for its deletion. In its current state, however, where the main currently relevant arguments point out its age, stubiness, and lack of demand, I argue that it should be '''kept'''. --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 02:16, 30 January 2007 (UTC)&lt;/s&gt;
**The name change, and the rewording of the introductory paragraph are nice changes, but they are only indicative of a last-ditch effort to keep this book when it is on the brink of deletion, not a display of the book's quality or potential. Most of the things that we delete around here, with enough spit and polish, could be made temporarily acceptable (or at least be made to avoid the most dire criticisms), but I don't see why we should keep those books either. Books are a big project, much larger then a wikipedia article, or most other types of wikimedia content. Books require vision and direction, and all too often book stubs are created that reflect a particular person's vision, but that don't make any sense to future contributors. Do we keep stubs? yes, we generally do. However, I think it's prudent for us to consider the potential for the stub to become something more, or to attract new people to the project. A stub that never becomes anything more, and never attracts any interest (at least any positive interest, with VfD nominations counting as &quot;negative interest&quot;) is an ''eternal stub'', which is in policy as being perfectly deletable. I would say that this book is an ''eternal stub'', unlikely to draw attention from any further contributors. It also has a distinct dearth of meaningful content (although I will admit that there is some) and nearly as many red links as there is written content. The original author has been absent from this project for over a year now, and without him to at least answer some questions about what he had in mind, I can't imagine that this book will ever amount to anything. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:44, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

*'''Delete'''  I have been avoiding this page and many others &lt;s&gt;&amp; will continue to do so&lt;/s&gt;.  However this is a very poor stub indeed - as was pointed out in the previous VFD on the page with content it is a plug for software and without that there really is very little to it.  I have no idea how that page survived the last vote - inertia and indifference to quality as usual I imagine --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 18:23, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

*'''Keep''' Can't see a reason to delete this book.  The name has been changed and the humourous comment about history graduates has been removed.  The book has purpose and potential. [[User:Xania|Xania]] [[Image:Flag_of_Poland_2.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 22:08, 4 February 2007 (UTC)

*I've changed my mind. Whiteknight, you convinced me. This book is still not going anywhere despite Brian's excellent &quot;boringfy&quot; (straight from the edit summary :D) of the introduction and reviving of sorts. The book has purpose and potential, yes, but in its current state is a stub with no willing contributors. It should be deleted because: (1) it is in nowise helpful to the reader and (2) I would imagine that any person who wants to contribute a free &quot;as in free speech&quot; textbook or reference guide related to arts management would totally disregard the current structure. Furthermore, it would be unhelpful and possibly detrminetal to any further development by any interested parties. Thus I argue to '''delete'''. --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 07:17, 7 February 2007 (UTC)
**'''Delete.''' Great comments from both WK and Unknown. [[User:Brian Brondel|Brian]] 00:27, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Around 3.9 to 4.6 billion years ago, the beginning stages of our solar system formation were set in motion. Over the course of the next 100 million years, all the planets and moons in our solar system as we know it were created, including our Earth and orbiting Moon. The early years of the Earth are referred to as the &quot;Pre-Cambrian&quot; era, and extend until about 500 million years ago. This era includes the Hadaen Eon, the Archean Eon, and the Proterozoic Eon.

== The Hadaen Eon==
[[Image:Volcano q.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Volcanic eruptions and extreme heat were an ongoing trend during the Hadaen Eon.]]
The first time period that the Earth proceeded through was the Hadaen Eon, which extended from approximately 4.6 to 3.8 billion years ago. The Earth at this time was very unlike the Earth today - lacking almost all oxygen and water filled oceans, the heat from the solar system formation as well as internal gravitational energy heating coupled with collisions with leftover planetary bodies made the Earth quite uninhabitable. In fact, the Earth began as mostly molten, and the resulting heat from this material as well as the extreme heat released from the settling of the planetary crusts made any atmosphere unattainable. The Earth's atmosphere was quite unlike what we see today - it comprised mainly of dust leftover from the solar nebula and also of lighter elements such as hydrogen and helium, and later water vapor and gases. During the Archaen eon is when a substantial atmosphere begins to form from the volcanic activity on Earth.

==Archean Eon ==
During the Archean Era, which began 2.5 billion years ago, many of the patterns seen in the Hadaen Eon persisted - namely, the large amounts of heat being radiated due to the solar system formation, the increased tectonic activity and crustal upheaval and recycling, as well as the lack of any significant atmosphere.[[Image:Anabaena_sperica1.jpg|100px|frame|right|Cyanobacteria, part of the prokaryote family and thought to have evolved in the Archean Eon]]
However, despite the alien image presented to us, the precursors of life were already in place. For starters, by the end of the Archean Eon, continents had begun to form, as well as water deposits resulting from cooling sedimentary rock. Furthermore, gas was expelled from volcanoes and released from the planets core had established an atmosphere of sorts, consisting of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and water.  It is thought that life developed at this time, with ample fossil evidence attributing to its existence. Members of the Bacteria and Archean families have been discovered preserved in fossils from this time. It should also be noted that rock from the Archean time period is the earliest rock discovered on Earth.

== Proterozoic Eon ==
The Proterozoic Eon is the last eon of the Pre-Cambrian era, as well as the last period before complex forms of life became common on Earth. It extends from 2.5 billion years ago to around 500 million years ago, and is comprised of three geological eras: Paleoproterozoic, Mesoproterozoic, and Neoproterozoic. 
One of the more notable changes in the Proterozoic era was the buildup up of oxygen in our environment. Due to the biological process of photosynthesis, oxygen had been produced throughout the Archean era, but had been reabsorbed by natural &quot;sinks&quot; in the environment. Such sinks were unoxidized sulfur and iron, which had until this era absorbed most of the oxygen produced. 
During this eon, the expansion of Prokaryotic life continued, but a new development was seen as well - Eukaryotic life. Both of these life forms continued to flourish, setting the stage for the even more advanced life forms that were soon to evolve.

Fair use is a legal categorization for copyrighted material, where that material can be used in certain ways without obtaining prior permission from the copyright holder. Historically, it has been the policy of Wikibooks to allow fair use images and text, so long as good, free alternatives were not available. However, in light of certain legal and licensing issues, Wikibooks no longer allows images, text, or other media that may only have been used under the &quot;Fair Use&quot; laws.

Fair use images and text currently on the site are to be phased out, where free alternatives are available, and deleted after a period of time when alternatives are not available. New images, text, or other media uploaded to Wikibooks that are categorized as Fair Use may be speedily deleted as violations of [[Wikibooks:Copyright]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Geophysical fluid dynamics''' is the study of the atmosphere and oceans using the machinery of general fluid dynamics. Much of the interest and novelty of geophysical flows derives from the fact that they take place in a rotating reference frame.  The Coriolis Force, for example, is a result of this rotation, and is a very prominent feature of large scale flows.  Other factors contributing to the unique character of geophysical flows include the (thermodynamical) interaction between the atmosphere and oceans and the fact that the systems under investigation are vertically arranged in stable layers (vertical density stratification).

      <comment>/* Method 2.2 Multicut for 2.6? */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Doors ==

Another way to build'em without messing up your mesh:

Select the top edges where you want the doors and multicut them twice ('''KKEY''') from the frontview ('''NUM1'''). Then move the newly created edges down and towards the sides.


==Fgon==
what exactly is an Fgon?  It doesn't seem to truely merge the faces, as now in face select mode the 'square' that designates a face is off-center.)


It is a fake-gon, which is a way to hide triangles and quads on flat faces. This is not same thing as NGON because it is only a visual tool. [[User:Pearts|Pearts]] ([[User talk:Pearts|talk]]) 18:52, 23 July 2010 (UTC)

== Trouble with merging Fgon or adjacent faces ==

Whatever I tried (with or without FGon, on cubes, on planes, etc.), when I type Ctrl+JKEY, Blender complains with.
 This data does not support joining in editmode

I don't find info about this error on the Internet.
Help?

if the face is not flat, or it has a vertex share with another face it will not merge, what you need to do then is just remove the face, and any edges you dont want to have, select three or four vertexes and hit fkey to make a new face in the way you want. [[User:Pearts|Pearts]] ([[User talk:Pearts|talk]]) 01:31, 7 October 2010 (UTC)

== Respectful Request about &quot;Noob Note&quot; and &quot;Readers Comments&quot; ==

If you don't understand something please use the discussion page to make comments or requests. It is impolite and a waste of another readers time to mark up the tutorial with things like &quot;Noob Note&quot; and &quot;Readers Comment.&quot; While one instance is insignificant multiply each inappropriate little note by the time it takes to read them, by the number of tutorials done, and it adds up.

I agree with what your saying [[User:Pearts|Pearts]] ([[User talk:Pearts|talk]]) 01:49, 20 July 2010 (UTC)

== Clarification Request on cab and flatbed section==

It would be helpful if the above paragraph specified WHICH 2 vertices. Perhaps someone who has completed this tutorial can make it more clear. &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:66.177.151.66|66.177.151.66]] ([[User talk:66.177.151.66|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/66.177.151.66|contribs]]) {{{2|}}}.&lt;/small&gt;


I don't understand the paragraph explaining how to create the cab and flatbed, that one starting with:
&quot;Delete the proper edge along the top of the mesh where you want the cab and flatbed to be (XKEY).&quot; I don't know which edge the statement is talking about. I can't continue this tutorial because I can't complete this step. Can anyone who has completed this tutorial(or this step at least) explain what the author means in this whole paragraph?


I agree it's confusing, and will attempt to add some pictures [[User:Pearts|Pearts]] ([[User talk:Pearts|talk]]) 03:44, 20 July 2010 (UTC)

== Alternate methods plus user comments are COMPLETELY CONFUSING ==

I'm not sure where the comments begin the alternate method ends etc. please clean up this article, port the alternate method to a new article. as it is I see atleast two if not three different methods all smashed together and sorting through it all is a PITA. as it is you got two methods for the bed, and the pictures alone are mixed up so I see 3 different things involving the doors.

I agree and will sort it all out [[User:Pearts|Pearts]] ([[User talk:Pearts|talk]]) 01:49, 20 July 2010 (UTC)

==Adding an Engine Hood - Method 1==

I'm having trouble here. When I try to add a loop it gives me an error that reads &quot;could not order loop&quot; and then subdivides the face I tried to add the loop to.''

I had the same problem. For me it was because I changed the jeep design too much so I had deleted and made several faces. Therefore the faces weren't attached to each other so a loop couldn't be made. If that happened then just subdivide the face twice to give you the lines you need and delete all the extra ones and remake the faces. It's more work but I don't know another way to do it.''

I have no idea what the heck this paragraph is talking about, and the  pictures don't help, someone really needs to rewrite this that actually understands what is going on. I advise skipping the hood part because it is hard to understand and doesn't look like it changes much.&lt;br&gt;

I hope he talks about shaping the hood with the lines from the Loop Subdivide, and then extruding that profile.&lt;br&gt;

If you don't know, press e to extrude, then type the letter of the axis.&lt;br&gt;

You're basically &quot;drawing&quot; a trapezoid on the hood and extruding it up. Loop 
divide works parallel to the axes so you'll have a square on the hood after the two loop-divides. Pulling the two vertices that are on the front edge of the hood inwards (along the edge) will create the desired trapezoid. Now just select the face (Ctrl+Tab Faces) and extrude it (EKEY).


==Subsurf==
If you subsurf the result from this tutorial, you will get a bad looking result, please try not to subsurf the jeep.

Don't subsurf unless you want to edge crease with Shift-EKEY''



==Resizing the bed and windshield==
'''Noob, 20th Oct 2008:''' I found ''Mesh ==&gt; Vertices ==&gt; Remove doubles'' is just as good when you bring one or more vertices into contact with one another, like he's done with the tailgate/wheelarch here.

== Method 2.2 Multicut for 2.6? ==

Hi,

I belive multicut doesnt work for 2.6 - is it possible to fix the method?[[User:Adam.Elenktik|Adam.Elenktik]] ([[User talk:Adam.Elenktik|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Adam.Elenktik|contribs]]) 15:09, 20 May 2013 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Organization of the Mammalian Nervous System==

The neurons can all be placed in one of two systems, the central nervous system or the peripheral nervous system.

===Central Nervous System===

The central nervous system has a fundamental role in the control of behavior.
It contains the brain and the spinal cord which are both encased in bone which shows their importance.
Both the brain and spinal cord receive signals from the afferent neurons and send signals to muscles and glands through efferent neurons.

====Structure and Function====

The brain is split up into three major layers, the [[w:hindbrain|hindbrain]] is the first, the second is the [[w:midbrain|midbrain]], and the [[w:forebrain|forebrain]] is last.

=====Hindbrain=====

The hindbrain is a well protected central core of the brain and includes the [[w:cerebellum|cerebellum]], [[w:reticular formation|reticular formation]], and the [[w:brain stem|brain stem]].
The cerebellum plays an important role in the integration of sensory perception and motor output.
It utilizes constant feedback on body position to fine-tune motor movements.
The brain stem contains the pons, and the medulla oblongata.
The pons relays sensory information between the cerebellum and [[v:School:Psychology/Psy_1001/Key_words_for_chapter_three#Cerebrum|cerebrum]].
The medulla oblongata is the lower portion of the brainstem.
It controls autonomic functions such as breathing and vomiting, and relays nerve signals between the brain and spinal cord.
The reticular formation is a part of the brain which is involved in stereotypical actions, such as walking, sleeping, and lying down.

=====Midbrain=====

This part of the brain is located between the forebrain and the hindbrain making up part of the brain stem.
All sensory and motor information going to and from the fore brain and the spinal cord must pass through the midbrain.

=====Forebrain=====

The [[w:Anterior#Usage_in_human_anatomy|anteriormost]] division of the developing vertebrate brain that contains the most complex neural network in the CNS. The forebrain has two major divisions, the lower diencephalon, which contains the thalamus and the hypothalmus, and the upper telencephalon, which contains the cerebrum.

====Methods for observing or evaluating brain activity====

In the past only two methods of observation were available. 
The first was observing individuals who have received brain damage and assume that the part of the brain that was damaged controlled the behavior or sense that had changed.
The second was connecting electrodes to the outside of someones head and recording the readings.

Newer methods include computed tomography (CT scan), positron emission tomography (PET scan), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and superconduction quantum interference devices (SQUID).

===Peripheral Nervous System===

Any part of the nervous system that is not part of the central nervous system is part of the peripheral nervous system.
The nerves in the peripheral nervous system is split up into the autonomic and somatic.
The somatic connect the central nervous system to sensory organs (such as the eye and ear) and muscles, while the autonomic connect other organs of the body, blood vessels and glands.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Neuroscience==
Neuroscience, the scientific study of central and peripheral nervous systems in biological organisms, aims to explain behavior in terms of the activities of the brain. It explores how the activity of millions of individual nerve cells produce behavior, consciousness and the mental processes by which we perceive, act, learn, and remember. Individual subdisciplines may focus on the structure, function, evolutionary history, development, genetics, biochemistry, physiology, pharmacology, and pathology of the brain.

===Metabolic Cost===
Nervous structures carry a high metabolic demand. A human brain, although accounting for only around 2% of body weight, requires 15% of the body’s oxygen and 20% of its energy.

===Organization of the Mammalian Nervous System===

The neurons can all be placed in one of two systems, the central nervous system or the peripheral nervous system.

====Central Nervous System====

The central nervous system has a fundamental role in the control of behavior.
It contains the brain and the spinal cord which are both incased in bone that protects them from mechanical injury. Both the brain and spinal cord receive signals from the afferent neurons and send signals to muscles and glands through efferent neurons.

=====Structure and Function=====

The CNS consists of brain and spinal cord. The brain is split up into three major sections.

======Forebrain======

The [[w:Anterior#Usage_in_human_anatomy|anteriormost]] division of the developing vertebrate brain that contains the most complex neural network in the CNS. The forebrain has two major divisions, the lower diencephalon, which contains the thalamus and the hypothalmus, and the upper telencephalon, which contains the cerebrum.

======Midbrain======

This part of the brain is located between the forebrain and the hindbrain making up part of the brain stem.
All sensory and motor information going to and from the fore brain and the spinal cord must pass through the midbrain.

======Hindbrain======

The hindbrain is a well protected central core of the brain and includes the [[w:cerebellum|cerebellum]], [[w:reticular formation|reticular formation]], and the [[w:brain stem|brain stem]].
The cerebellum plays an important role in the integration of sensory perception and motor output.
It utilizes constant feedback on body position to fine-tune motor movements.
The brain stem contains the pons, and the medulla oblongata.
The pons relays sensory information between the cerebellum and [[v:School:Psychology/Psy_1001/Key_words_for_chapter_three#Cerebrum|cerebrum]].
The medulla oblongata is the lower portion of the brainstem.
It controls autonomic functions such as breathing and vomiting, and relays nerve signals between the brain and spinal cord.
The reticular formation is a part of the brain which is involved in stereotypical actions, such as walking, sleeping, and lying down.

======Spinal Cord======

=====Brain Activity=====

In the past only two methods of observation were available. The first was observing individuals who have received brain damage and assume that the part of the brain that was damaged controlled the behavior or sense that had changed. The second was connecting electrodes to the outside of someones head and recording the readings.

Newer methods include computed tomography (CT scan), positron emission tomography (PET scan), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and superconduction quantum interference devices (SQUID).

====Peripheral Nervous System====

Any part of the nervous system that is not part of the central nervous system is part of the peripheral nervous system.
The nerves in the peripheral nervous system is split up into the autonomic and somatic.
The somatic connect the central nervous system to sensory organs (such as the eye and ear) and muscles, while the autonomic connect other organs of the body, blood vessels and glands.

===Neurons===

The basic functional unit of the nervous system are neurons, i.e., cells that are specialized for processing and communicating information. Neurons have a basic structure of:
* The '''cell body''' (or soma) is the bulbous end of a neuron, containing the cell nucleus and much of the cells metabolic machinery.
* The '''axon''' carries information away from the cell body and may range in size from several microns to as long as several meters in giraffes and whales. Axons may branch into terminal buttons (designated sites of communication) at its end.
* '''Dendrites''' receive neurotransmitter secreted by the axon of other neurons.
* '''Synapse''' is a specialized junction between cells of the nervous system which permits signalling between them.

===Neurophysiology===
Neurons are able to conduct and process signals that involve small changes in electrical voltage generated across the neuronal membrane. At rest, the inside of the neuron is negative relative to the cell surround - the '''resting membrane potential'''. Individual signals are integrated across different regions of the neuron and throughout sets of neuronal networks in order to determine each unit's response and output. A special type of such voltage changes features a rapid spike in voltage resulting from changes in ion conductances - the '''action potential'''. Such signals are predominantly transmitted along axonal lines where neurons interact with other cellular entities over greater distances. 

====Ohm's Law====
Basic familiarity with key concepts in electricity is essential in order to appreciate the neuronal mechanisms active during such integration. Ohm's law holds that the rate at which electric charges flow (i.e., '''Current''' or I) depends on the force and its direction exerted onto the charged particle (i.e., '''Potential''', V) and the ease with which the flow can occur (i.e., '''Conductance''', g). The latter can also be expressed as the reciprocal of the conductance, namely as the degree to which the conductor obstructs the flow of charges (i.e., '''Resistance''', R). The flow of electricity is defined as flowing from negative to positive.
&lt;center&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Ohm's Law: &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;I = g * V&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

====Electrical Properties of Neurons====

&lt;b&gt;d.&lt;/b&gt;[[Image:Neur_1d.gif]]&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;The electric properties of the neuronal membrane can be expressed as a circuit diagram. &lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt;. Golgi-stained neuron with long axonal process. &lt;b&gt;b&lt;/b&gt;. Circuit diagram of neuronal membrane combining membrane resistance (Rm), membrane capacitance (Cm) and internal or axial resistance (Ri). &lt;b&gt;c&lt;/b&gt;. Decay in signal size over distance with Space Constant. &lt;b&gt;d&lt;/b&gt;. Change along the axon in Voltage response to the injection of a single square current pulse due to membrane capacitance&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

The voltage present across the cell's membrane can be measured between a reference electrode and a conducting glass capillary tube drawn out to a very fine point, and inserted into the cell. At rest the neuronal interior is negative relative to the outside at between -60 to -80mV, while most non-neuronal cells feature a potential of about -30 mV. The current is carried by ions moving across the membrane at ion conductances when specific channels allow them to pass. Ignoring its active properties, the axon can in electrical terms be viewed as an insulated cable. An electric potential is able to spread passively along any stretch of membrane. In the process its strength decays and the slope of on- and offsets becomes less steep with distance due to the passive cable properties of the membrane. The latter include resistance along its length and both a resistance and a capacitance component across it. Signals will spread fastest when longitudinal resistance is low (e.g., via increased axonal diameter) and they will spread furthest when resistance across the membrane is high (e.g., with layers of myelin for added electrical insulation).

====Resting Potential====
A neuron is at rest when it has not been activated for some time. At that state it exhibits a negatively charged inside relative to the surrounding environment.

=====Ionic Basis=====
The '''Resting Potential''' emerges from an&lt;b&gt; unequal distribution&lt;/b&gt; of ions across the cell's membrane. An excess of K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and of various Anions&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; exists on the inside while Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; exist in higher concentrations on the outside. The membrane is dotted with proteins that permit the flow of ions (i.e., ion pores) or control their flow (i.e., ion channels) across it. In a cell at rest only potassium ions (K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) are able to flow freely between the two compartments. Initially we observe a net flow of positively charged potassium ions from the inside where they are more numerous to the outside where their concentration is much lower (i.e., '''concentration gradient'''). With a net flow of positively charged ions from the inside across the membrane, the inside becomes increasingly negative relative to the outside (i.e., '''charge gradient'''). The resting potential settles into an equilibrium when as many potassium ions are pushed out of the cell along their concentration gradient, as will enter the cell along the accompanying electrical gradient. This equilibrium potential for potassium can be calculated using the &lt;b&gt;Nernst potential&lt;/b&gt; for known inside and outside concentrations of any given ion
&lt;center&gt;&lt;table width=&quot;450&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;2&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Nernst Potential (E) = &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2.303 * &lt;sup&gt;RT&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;zF&lt;/sub&gt; * log(&lt;sup&gt;[ion]out&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;[ion]in&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
where R = the gas constant (8.3143 joules/mole-degree); T = absolute temperature in degrees Kelvin (310 degrees); z = ionic valence; F = Faraday's constant (96,487 coulombs/mole). 

Depending on their respective inside and outside concentrations at the particular cell, different ions will produce different equilibrium potentials (reversal potentials). The ion concentrations are usually similar to those listed:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;table width=&quot;450&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;2&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;[ion]&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;[ion]&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;E&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;400&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;20&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-75mV&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;50&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;440&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;+55mV&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&quot;&gt;Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.0001&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;125&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;+155mV&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;9&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;100&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-65mV&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The Nernst potential for potassium thus can be simplified to the following formula. [[Image:NernstK.gif]]
and for sodium is: [[Image:NernstNa.gif]]

The cell's resting membrane potential combines all relevant ion currents with K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions figuring most prominently due to their high resting conductance. In addition a small number of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions leak into the cell. The resulting resting membrane potential is thus slightly lower compared to the E&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt;+ at around -65mV. To maintain the concentration gradient across the membrane of resting neurons, ATP continually supplies energy to the Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ATPase (ion pump) as ions leak across the axomembrane.

====Action potential====
An '''Action potential''' represents a transient inward current of cations (Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;). It is generated when the graded membrane potential rises above threshold either spontaneously or because of depolarizing input. 

=====Ionic Basis=====
During the action potential, '''voltage-gated sodium channels''' are opened when the potential rises (i.e., depolarizes) from resting potential (-65mV) to the cells threshold (-55mV). These channels close again when the potential further rises to +10mV. As sodium ions spread to neighboring areas of axonal membrane, they open sodium channels there via depolarization and the signal runs the entire length of the cell (i.e., the ''all-or-none-principle''). 

A '''Refractory period''' follows the action potential during which time the neuron reestablishes its normal resting potential. At the beginning of this period it is impossible for another signal to be transmitted, this is called ''absolute refractory phase''. This is followed by the ''relative refractory phase'' where it is possible to send another signal but more exitation than normal is needed.

The Duration of an action potential is 1-2ms in Vertebrates and 1-100ms in Invertebrates. Frequency of firing ranges from &lt;1 to about 100/sec (100Hz). The Amplitude ranges between 70-80mV when recorded intracellularly and 5-200µV when recorded extracellularly.

=====Tetrodotoxin=====
{{Animal Behavior Example stub}}

====Synapse====
=====Electrotonic Junctions=====
Two electrically excitable cells, such as neurons or muscle cells, may be electrically coupled where an action potential in one cell moves directly into the other via arrays of gap junctions. Electrical synapses are fast but cannot be modulated. They are mostly used in neuronal circuits for escape behaviors where speed of conduction is essential. Electrical synapses (gap junctions, electrotonic junctions) allow current to flow between separate neurons when ions pass through gap junctions. Connexons (where 6 connexin proteins form a hemi-channel) are the actual pores that allow ions to flow past the two membranes. A connexon in the presynaptic membrane lines up precisely with its respective equivalent in the postsynaptic membrane, forming a continuous channel from one neuron to another. With a pore diameter of about 1.5m-9 many small molecules can pass through efficiently. Intracellular Ca2+ concentration, pH, or phosphorylation of connexins can profoundly alter the easy with which ions annd proteins may pass through the pore. As there is no synaptic delay in transmission of current from cell to another, the conduction of potential changes is considerably faster than through chemical synapses. Although electrical synapses are often bi-directional, some synapses pass current better in one direction than the other (i.e., rectifying synapse) Electrical synapses are commonly used in time-critical processes (escape behaviors), when rapid synchronization of many cells is needed (e.g., vertebrate cardiac muscle), between glial cells, or early in development.

=====Chemical Junctions=====
Cells are also able to communicate chemically across a gap  (i.e., '''synapse'''), which forms a directional connection from one neuron to another cell.
The neurotransmitter is emitted from the terminal endings of one cell's axon onto a dendrite or body of a second cell. The arrival of a signal leads to the release of a neurotransmitter from the presynaptic terminal, diffusion across the synaptic cleft, and binding to receptors in the postsynaptic membrane. '''Ionotropic or metabotropic receptors''' are binding proteins which alter ion conductances at the postsynaptic cell membrane (e.g., increase in Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conductance depolarizes and is excitatory, CL&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; hyperpolarizes and is thus inhibitory). When excitatory, the postsynaptic cell is depolarized with an excitatory post-synaptic potential (EPSP) and an action potential is elicited if the threshold is reached; in inhibitory connections, the postsynaptic cell is hyperpolarized with an inhibitory post-synaptic potential (IPSP) and it will thus be harder for other inputs to drive the cell towards an action potential. A single input is rarely sufficient to lead to an action potential in the post-synaptic cell. Multiple EPSPs may add and reach the threshold when a series of action potentials arrive at high rate. Chemical synapses are capable of integrating a complex scenario of inputs:

'''Neurotransmitter''' refers to a compound that is released at a synapse and diffuses across the synaptic cleft to act on a receptor located on the membrane of a postsynaptic cell, which may be another neurone, a muscle cell or a specialized gland cell. A wide range of chemicals are used as neurotransmitters in the nervous system. Stored in synaptic vesicles. they are released during the arrival of an action potential and produce changes in the excitability of the postsynaptic membrane. Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx at the axon terminus is required for synaptic release.

'''Neuromodulator''' refers to a compound that is released within a localized region of CNS, the receptor for which is not necessarily sited on an anatomically apposed postsynaptic cell. Thus a neuromodulator may affect several postsynaptic cells with specificity conferred mainly by the distribution of receptors. Main action is on second messenger systems, e.g. cAMP or inositole triphosphate, presumably affecting protein phosphorylation

Sometimes the same neurochemical may have rapid transmitter type effects, followed by longer modulatory influences. This suggests that neurotransmitter and neuromodulator effects may be most effectively classified at the receptor level. Activation of receptors on a protein structure directly incorporating an ion channel (a ionophore) are defined as neurotransmission while activation of receptors coupled indirectly to ion channels (e.g. via second messenger systems) are defined as neuromodulation.

=====Signal Strength=====
For the signal to be passed from one neuron to the next it must have enough energy to break a point called the threshold.
Once the threshold is broken the signal is transmitted. The neuron fires at the same strength every time. The strength of a signal is decided by how many different neurons are being fired and at what frequency they are being fired.

=====Glial cells=====
The amount of' glial cells to every neuron in the nervous system is disputed. Glial cells function as support for the neurons; they produce the myelin sheath which surrounds some neurons and also form part of the ''blood-brain'' barrier. 
The blood-brain barrier is a structure that prevents certain substances in the bloodstream from reaching the brain. Many axons are sheathed with tubes of myelin, which is a fatty material. Myelin is produced by the ''glial'' cells. The myelin sheaths on axons have gaps, which are called the nodes of Ranvier. Myelinated sheaths help transmit information quickly and efficiently.

=====Synaptic Integration=====
Activity in any presynaptic neuron alone is rarely sufficient to elicit an action potential in the postsynaptic neuron. Summation of synaptic inputs, however, can occur when a neuron receives multiple exitatory inputs in short order. Synaptic processing describes the ways in which the electrical events in different neurons may interact through interactions at their synapses. Synaptic inputs are mostly located on the dendritic tree of a neuron, while axonal action potentials represent the neuron's output. In order to drive a neuron the integrated influence of the electrical events generated by the synapses must be sufficient to spread through the dendrites to the soma and into the initial segment of the axon (i.e., the axon hillock, trigger zone). The latter is the site of action potential generation. Synaptic integration is thus key to understanding the contribution of individual neurons to information processing within neural networks.

In '''spatial summation''' the cell responds when activity from multiple inputs arrives at the same time. If the combined excitation brings the cell to threshold, an actionpotential is initiated. The arrival of a spike train in a presynaptic neuron may produce multiple EPSPs. If these inputs begin to build on each other, the postsynaptic cell may reach threshold and produce an action potential.

Passive membrane properties are important. Long time constants increase the chances for temporal summation. Large space constants determine the likelihood of spatial integration. The size of the postsynaptic cell counts, as a synaptic current delivered into a small neuron will produce a much greater effect than in a large postsynaptic cell.

Location of synapses is important. Control of the cell's activity usually driven by excitatory synapses on dendrites. Inhibitory synapses located on the cell body are able to shut down activity. Synapses at presynaptic release sites are modulatorym controlling the amount of neurotransmitters released.

===Glial Cells===

Glial cells function as support for the neurons; they produce the myelin sheath which surrounds some neurons and also form part of the ''blood-brain'' barrier. The ratio of glial cells to neurons in the nervous system is disputed. The blood-brain barrier is a structure that prevents certain substances in the bloodstream from reaching the brain.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Sensory Biology==
Behavior requires that an animal obtains information about its environment. Thus, to understand behavior we need to understand how organisms perceive their environment (i.e., sensory systems biology, sensory biology). By understanding how your senses gather information, we gain a better and more thorough understanding of our behavior. Common research questions in sensory biology focus on:

*What is the stimulus (modality of information)? Is it mechanical, chemical, etc.
*How does the sensory system encode the stimulus? Sensory filtering, transformation, transduction, amplification
*Where is this information processed? Neural anatomy, network connections, etc.

A '''stimulus''' is any form of energy pattern that can be detected and registered by the senses. Its '''Dynamic range''' is the ratio between the highest and lowest values of a stimulus intensity, such as for sound or light. A '''signal''' is the physical coding of information (e.g., a message) capable of transmission through environment. '''Sensory processing''' includes all central acts of information processing, which link the initial stages of sensory reception with the creation of a subjective sensory precept. '''Sensation''' is the neuronal activity resulting from the transduction of stimulus energy into electrical activity (also Sensory processing). A '''sensory cue''' is a statistic or signal from sensory input that measures the state of some property of the world that the perceiver is interested in.

The signal's '''Signal-to-noise ratio''' refers to the power of a particular signal relative to the level of background noise.

==Sensory Stimuli==
There are three main forms of '''Stimulus Energy''' that can alter cellular processes and thereby activate sensory systems. A stimulus may be on for some time as a '''steady-state stimulus''' or may come on and go off again shortly afterwards as a '''transient stimulus'''.
 
===Mechanical===
(particle movement - near field, pressure waves - far field, compressional vs. transverse waves): Hearing, Vestibular, Touch (via hair cells in cochlea, statocyst, or semicircular canals) via hair cells in acoustic, equilibrium and lateral-line systems are responsible for the transduction process from cilia that respond to shearing forces and end with processes that depolarize the cell membrane of afferent neurons. Stimulus specificity is provided through Accessory Structures (e.g. tectal mebrane, statolith, and cupula). Touch: routing response in babies, lordosis, grooming. Sound and Vibration: mechanoreception, proprioreceptors, sound window, transmission in water vs. air, boundaries (surface waves), complex content (frequency modulation, amplitude modulation), Example: bird and whale songs, human speech, echolocation in bats and whales, long-distance communication in elephants and whales. Movement of particles: Example: spiders
===Electromagnetic===
(waves): Light, Heat, Electrical, Magnetic (e.g., Phototransduction, heat sensors). Radiant Heat: thermoreception, Example: Detection of prey in rattlesnakes; Electric Fields: electroreception, Examples: Detection of prey in sharks, communication in electric fish; Light: perception of absolute light levels, color balance, polarization, Examples: fireflies

====Pheromones====
One of the many ways in which organisms can communicate with each other is through the use of pheromones.  An organism generates and emits these hormonal chemicals in order to relay a message to another member of the same species.  Ants and bees demonstrate two prominent examples of pheromone usage, which acknowledges their incredible capability to organize the behaviors of the whole colony.
Ants produce numerous different pheromones, each with its own distinct purpose.  Ants secrete pheromones to attract mates, to signal danger to the colony, or to give directions about a location.  Other pheromones act as deterrents keeping out unwanted ants from foreign colonies or preying insectivores.  Still other pheromones communicate ants to congregate.  This explains how assiduous ants exercise remarkable cooperation in building a colony.  Pheromones maintain the cohesiveness and organization of the complex ant communities.
Certain types, such as alarm pheromones, produce a “releaser effect”, which induces a quick response and may be used to tell other ants to evacuate a dangerous area such as an approaching lawnmower.  For example, when a spider approaches an ant will release alarm pheromones that alert all the other ants.  Ants may also discharge alarm pheromones as a result from being diverted from their work, e.g. heavy human steps.  Releaser pheromones are also used to mark territory.  As the chemical deposited dries, it signals to other species members of the territory’s occupant.  
Other pheromones create a “primer effect” that entices other ants for actions.  Such pheromones are useful in mating rituals and only affect ants of the opposite sex.  Primer pheromones can send signals to the endocrine system, to make appropriate changes, for instance ovulation required for successful mating.  
Biologist E.O. Wilson discovered in the 1960’s that the organic chemical for each pheromone varies tremendously depending on what signal it entails.  Ants taste and smell a substance that evaporates off the chemical laid down by another ant.  Wilson observed in slow motion films that ants do this by moving their antennae from side to side.  For example, alarm pheromones are discharged into the air, and expand in a circle of smell.  Ants can determine the concentration of the pheromone, and thus determine the proximity of the source of danger.
Bees are also well known for communicating through the use of pheromones.  Like ants, bees have a variety of purposes associated with the pheromones, such as marking and behavior.  Honeybees release chemical signals for marking food sources, marking their hive, in scenting potential hive sites, and in assembling swarms for flight.  Although each hive has a particular scent, different colonies can be easily integrated during times when honey flow is heavy since the colony’s odor is inundated with the scent of nectar. Virgin queen bees emit a behavioral pheromone released with their feces.  When the new queen feels threatened by the workers she uses this pheromone as a repellent.  

Another widely identified chemical signal in bees is the Queen Mandibular Pheromone (QMP).  This pheromone ensures that the queen is the only reproductive female in the hive by compromising the reproductive systems of worker bees.  It also provides an attractant signal to the drones.

===Stimulus Properties===
&lt;b&gt;Table summarizes the types of information encoded by different stimulus energies. &lt;/b&gt;Some types of stimuli are better suited for some types of information. It is important to consider  limits to information, communication, or stimulus use. In this table a + indicate how well that stimulus functions for that information.&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot; cellspacing=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Signal, Sensory Chanel&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;odor molecules - smell, taste, &lt;b&gt;olfactory &lt;/b&gt;and&lt;b&gt; gustatory chemoreceptors&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;works in both dark and light scenarios, long and short distance, travels around or through obstacles, persists, efficient production&lt;b&gt;, &lt;/b&gt;slow, little directionality, cannot be turned off quickly, presence/absence (low complexity), low resolution&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;compressional waves - hearing, &lt;b&gt;mechanoreceptors&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;60%&quot;&gt;dark/light, complex content, fast at short distances&lt;b&gt;, &lt;/b&gt;slow at long distances, resolution (frequency dependent), may travel far and around obstacles (low frequency), attenuates quickly (high frequency), directionality&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;substrate vibration - &lt;b&gt;mechanoreceptors, proprioreceptors&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;dark/light, complex content (frequency modulation, amplitude modulation), fast at short distances&lt;b&gt;, &lt;/b&gt;slow at long distances, resolution (frequency dependent), travels far/around obstacles, directionality&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;movement of particles - wind, &lt;b&gt;mechanoreceptors&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;dark/light, short-range only, directionality&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;touch, &lt;b&gt;proprioreceptors&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;dark/light, contact necessary, complex content (perception of size, shape, texture, movement across skin)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;electric fields - active and passive electroreception, &lt;b&gt;electroreceptors&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;dark/light, short range, spatial resolution, travels around and through most objects&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;light energy - vision, &lt;b&gt;photoreceptors&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;light necessary, direct line of sight, immediate and precise localisation, fine resolution, complex content, visual displays,&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;thermal energy - detection of radiant heat, infrared vision &lt;b&gt;thermoreceptors&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;dark/light, short range, does not travel around and through objects, spatial resolution&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

===Electroreception===
[[Image:Electroreceptors in a sharks head.svg|right|300px|thumb|Electroreceptors (Ampullae of Lorenzini) and lateral line canals in the head of a shark.]]Electroreception refers to the biological ability to sense electrical impulses. As water is a better conductor than air, electroreception is more common in aquatic creatures. Individuals utilize this sense to locate living organisms as sources of electrical energy.
===Umwelt===
[[Image:CaveCricket.jpg|left|300px|thumb|Blind cave crickets of Mammoth Caves, KY, featuring long, tactile antennae.]]Species specific differences in sensory reception. Human perception utilizes 5 sensory modalities: sight, hearing, touch, taste, and smell. Receptors are classified based on the source of the stimulus. Interoreceptors convey information from within the organism; Proprioreceptors report on the spatial position of body parts relative to one another; Exteroreceptors obtain information about the outside. Subcategories of the latter include Somatoreceptors that capture events on the body's surface and Teloreceptors which monitor stimuli at a distance fro the body. Sensory selectivity: refers to the subset of stimuli, which an animal detects and responds to; the '''Umwelt''': Sensory World. Subjective set of stimuli to which an animal is responsive in a given motivational state. Each species has evolved responses only to those stimuli that prove relevant. It is this simpler world that actually falls within the animal's perception at any particular moment. (Jakob von Uexküll). &lt;Psychophysics&gt;: uses behavioral assays to establish sensory abilities of organisms.

==Sensory Systems==
Sensory systems allow us to form internal representations of our surrounding world, by transducing stimulus energy into trains of neural signals which are conveyed along specific neural pathways. Consider the following example using Jelly Beans. Hawaiian punch and Cherry flavored beans have the same color. Visual information about jelly beans is incomplete. By blocking your nose while eating a jelly bean, you prevent smell from providing information. Taste does not allow you to determine which bean is punch and which is cherry. With olfactory information added, this decision becomes easy. If you allow air to flow through your nose while you taste the jelly beans, the cinnamon bean activates your trigeminal system providing critical information independent of taste and smell. 

*'''Reception''' the ability of a cell to respond when matter or a specific form of energy acts upon a &lt;Sensory Receptor&gt;: A cell endowed with the ability to absorb a specific kind of stimulus energy. Stimulus filtering (also stimulus tuning): A receptors responds only to a narrow cocktail of (physical) characteristics. 
*'''Sensory Transduction''' chain of physiological reactions which convert sensory input into electrical impulses. This process translates the amount of stimulus energy into changes in membrane permeability (e.g., opening sodium channels towards the production of an action potential). Initial receptor responses are often graded and proportional to the strength of the input signal (e.g. membrane permeability of stretch receptors to ions is proportional to the force applied to the receptor).
*'''Amplification''' when weak sensory inputs are intensified
*'''Transmission''' as input signals are conveyed to the nervous system. The intensity of the graded response determines the frequency of generated action potentials. The rapid depolarisation and hyper-polarisation of an all-or-nothing action potential spike is fairly uniform in amplitude and duration (&lt; 2 msec). '''Frequency code''': Information transfer based on the rate of action potentials of up to 500AP/s for intense stimuli. Sensory receptors may be neurons who themselves project axons to the CNS or non-neuronal receptors which activate neurons via synaptic (i.e., neurotransmitter) signals
*'''Integration''': Processing of information begins as soon as stimuli are received (e.g. Sensory adaptation). Summation of multiple graded responses influences frequency of action potentials.

===Sensory Receptors===
Sensory receptors are able to respond to a particular stimulus energy (i.e., sensory modality) and transduce it into neural impulses. '''Neuronal tuning''' describes a neuron's property to selectively represent a particular kind of sensory information. For example, an auditory system neuron which responds best to the sound of particular frequency is said to be tuned to that frequency. In the visual system, neurons are tuned to particular objects, for example edges of a particular orientation. The receptor's '''dynamic range''' refers to the stimulus intensities which a given sensory receptor is able to represent in quantitative fashion. At its '''operating point''' the stimulus elicits a 50% response. '''Tonic receptors''' respond with a constant rate of firing as long as stimulus is applied (e.g., pain). In contrast, '''phasic receptors''' produce a burst of activity during the onset of the stimulus but quickly reduce their firing rate if the stimulus is maintained (e.g., odor, touch, &amp; temperature). With sensory adaptation, the organism ceases to pay attention to a constant stimuli. The adequate stimulus for a particular receptor is the one that requires the least amount of energy to activate the receptor.

====Mechanoreceptors====
:*'''Hair Cells''': Hair cells are sensory receptors that transduce physical forces into changes in electrical activity. Their name derives from a bundle of cilia on the apical surface of the cell. Embedded bundles of cross-linked actin filaments are anchored to the top of the cell membrane, where they control ion currents across a set of channels. Shearing of the tuft of cilia towards one side or the other, changes the conductance of ions across a set of stretch-activated ion channels (i.e., tip links).
:*'''Stretch receptors''' (MRO): The muscle receptor organ spans the joint between two adjacent abdominal segments in crayfish. These are sensory organs that provide information about posture and movement of the individual. Each MRO has a thin muscle fiber that runs in parallel to a muscle bundle used by the animal to maintain the position of its abdomen. When the muscles contract or are stretched they cause the MRO to change its firing pattern, providing information to the nervous system regarding the relative position of the abdominal segments. There are two kinds of MROs. Tonic MROs respond to chronic stretch with continuous firing and habituate slowly. Phasic MROs respond to rapid changes in posture, but habituate quickly when the posture is maintained for more than a few moments.

====Electro-Magnetic Receptors====
:*'''Light-sensitive neurons''': rods (B/W) and cones (color) in the mammalian retina contain dense stacks of membrane with large numbers of light-sensitive pigments. The latter consist of a protein (opsin) and a bound chromophore (retinal). Retinal is able to capture photons, induce a conformational change in opsin, and thereby activate a G protein coupled second messenger cascade.
:*'''Electroreceptors''': Electric fish, Sharks, Platypus: Some animal possess specialized sensory cells that enable them to detect changes in the electromagnetic field around them. These organs can be used by predators to locate prey by the electrical activity of their nervous systems and muscles, or in some cases as a means of communication (when coupled with the ability to produce pulses of electricity as seen in some electric fish).
:*'''Thermoreceptors''': Snakes: Some snakes hunt their prey using body heat. Heat travels through the the atmosphere as infra-red (long wavelength) electromagnetic radiation, and is detected by cells sensitive to changes in temperature.

====Chemical Receptors====
{{Animal Behavior Example stub}}

===Accessory Structures===
[[Image:Statocyst.jpg|left|300px|thumb|Interior of a statocyst gravity receptor, an equilibrium organ of invertebrates, such as a crayfish. A fluid-filled vesicle is lined with mechanoreceptors (hair cells). It contains one of more dense objects (e.g. sandy or stone-like elements) - the statoliths. As gravity pulls these objects down, activity of sensory cells below them increases when their cilia are sheared. From this, the central nervous system can extract information about the direction of gravitational pull. When the animal molts it loses the lining of the statocyst and with it the sand grains. After molting the animal rebuilds the otoliths with materials from its surrounding.]]
{{Animal Behavior Example stub}}

===Sensory Processing===
The '''receptive field''' of a sensory neuron is the specific region of a sensory surface (e.g., area on the retina) that, when stimulated, causes a change in activity of a neuron. The spatial organisation of receptors within a sensory surface is generally maintained throughout processing in the form of '''somatotopic maps'''. For example, sensory information maintains its structure (i.e. sensory information on the hand remains next to sensory information on the arm) throughout the spinal cord and brain.

====Neural Filtering====
{{Animal Behavior Example stub}}

====Temporal Integration====
{{Animal Behavior Example stub}}

====Feature Extraction====
Logical gates can be created by driving an action potential in the postsynaptic cell only if e.g., multiple input sources are active concurrently (i.e., '''spatial summation''')

*'''Coincidence detection''': Activity in any presynaptic neuron alone is usually not sufficient to produce and action potential in the postsynaptic neuron. Summation of synaptic inputs can occur, however, when a neuron receives multiple exitatory inputs in short order. Spatial summation allows a cell to fire if two inputs are active at the very same time. The window of opportunity during which concurrent events must occur depends on the time constant of the neuronal membrane. For coincidence detectors the time constant must be short; if the cell works as a temporal integrator, it must be long.

When '''localizing a stimulus source''', systems for the discrimination of left vs. right are often based on two sub-systems. These are often mirror-images of each other and located to the left and the right of the midline (i.e., Omega neurons in crickets). They are tightly coupled through lateral inhibition, where activation of one side automatically shuts off its contralateral (i.e., opposite side) opponent. Such a design is uniquely able to allow resolution of extremely small time differences in when a sound signal arrives at the ear facing the source than in the one facing away.

*'''Contrast enhancement''': Lateral Inhibition: Multiple units with similar characteristics are wired to inhibit each other's activity. The unit that fires first/strongest will prevent all others from firing. (e.g., Discrimination of left vs. right in auditory signals using a pair of Omega neurons in crickets).

*'''Measure time-delay between two inputs''': Delay Lines: Action potentials (AP) travel along axons at a defined speed. They thus take longer to arrive at the target the further the AP needs to travel. Multiple neurons with similar characteristics are laid out in a longitudinal array. They receive input from two sources one fed in from one side of the array, the other from the other side. Acting as coincidence detectors they respond best when the signals on both inputs match. Each member of the array is most sensitive to a particular time difference. (e.g., Spatial localization of auditory signals in the laminaro nucleus of Owls).

====Example: Vision====

=====Physics of the Eye=====

The resolution of the retina varies between different regions. A sensitive, b/w, high resolution central region (i.e., fovea) is surrounded by a peripheral field with poor resolution and color reception. No photoreceptors are present at the location (i.e., blind spot)) where ganglion cell axons leave the eyeball to project to the brain via the optic nerve.

=====Visual Processing=====

Systems for the processing of visual information extract features from the visual field at multiple hierarchical levels. The photoreceptor cells in the retina detect points of light (image). The retinal '''ganglion cells''' respond to point contrast (form and color). The '''lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN)''' provides a first rapid analysis of high-contrast, black and white features. The '''primary visual cortex (V1)''' provides a slower but more in-depth analysis with an emphasis on linear contrast, color, depth, object vs. background motion.

'''Retinal receptor cells''' (i.e., cones for color and rods for black and white) feed into bipolar on or off cells in the retina. '''Retinal ganglion neurons'''  and '''LGN Neurons''' have center-surround characteristics and thus respond to spots of light of a particular size and in specific places of the visual field. Their receptive fields are circular and monocular. Many axons cross to the opposite side as they project towards the lateral geniculate nucleus and the primary visual cortex. At these stages, binocular information is brought together as information from the corresponding visual fields from the two eyes projects to neighboring places.

The '''visual cortex''' is arranged in multiple horizontal layers with outer layers focused on the processing of simpler features. Most neurons respond best to oriented bar stimulus, sensitive to motion, monocular or binocular. As the information proceeds further into the structure, features at increasing levels of abstraction are analyzed. Vertical columns across these layers primarily respond to input from one specific eye and respond to a particular feature orientation. '''Simple cells''' respond best to bars of given orientation at given location within receptive field. These oriented edge detection neurons feed their output into motion-sensitive neurons. '''Complex cells''' are less sensitive to stimulus position within the receptive field and more sensitive to stimulus motion. '''Hypercomplex cells''' respond like complex cells, but feature in addition an inhibitory region at one end. Some neurons at the highest-level receptive fields are quite specific i.e. a neuron that only responds to faces, faces with particular expressions, or belonging to one particular individual (i.e., grandmother neuron).
Flicker-fusion frequency, the lateral geniculate body and dyslexia

The visual parts of the brain strive for hypotheses about the contents of the outside world working in essence with an image of rather poor quality and thereby is able to produce our rich everyday visual experience

===Sensory Perception===
'''Sensory perception''' is the interpretation of sensory signals within the CNS where it produces an internal representation of electrical activity from sensory organs. Specificity of sensory impulses derives from transmission via labelled lines, perception for a particular modality depends on which part of the brain receives the signals.

Most human senses have very high dynamic range. A human is capable of hearing (and usefully discerning) anything from a quiet murmur in a soundproofed room to the sound of the loudest heavy metal concert. Such a difference can exceed 100 dB which represents a factor of 100,000 in amplitude and a factor 10,000,000,000 in power. We can see objects in starlight or in bright sunlight, even though on a moonless night objects receive 1/1,000,000,000 of the illumination they would on a bright sunny day: that is a dynamic range of 90 dB. A human cannot perform these feats of perception at both extremes of the scale at the same time as the eyes take time to adjust the dynamic range to different light levels.

This page outlines a proposed policy for granting and revoking tools.

== Granting administration tools ==
'''Administrators''' are active and experienced community members trusted to perform specific &quot;administrative&quot; tasks (delete pages, block users, etc.), provide timely assistance when needed or requested, maintain a general understanding of the current environment and accepted practices at Wikibooks, and follow all official policies and guidelines to the best of their knowledge and ability. Administrators are not authoritative or infallible. Community members may either [[Wikibooks:Requests for permissions|request permission]] themselves or be nominated by another member. Nominees '''must''' be informed on their discussion page and '''must''' state acceptance of their nominations (next to the nomination) before any ''final decision'' is acted on.

Granting administrator tools is not a big deal and have no specific requirements. However, keep in mind when requesting, accepting, or supporting the new responsibilities that administrators are expected to:

# '''Follow and understand all official policies and guidelines''' as they are frequently responsible for their enforcement.
# '''Use the tools to benefit the community''' in accordance with policies, guidelines, and community consensus.
# '''Use good judgment and caution'''. Seek the opinions of other community members, and delegate administrative actions that might be perceived as imposing personal views or interests to others. Administrative activity is not an area where anyone should '''[[WB:BOLD|be bold]]''' or '''[[WB:CIVIL|be uncivil]]'''.
# '''Be available''' through the wiki, email, the textbook-l mailing list, or by some other means listed on their user page, such as another Wikimedia project.
# '''Be active and alert to changes in the community'''. Only through activity can community members demonstrate a need to have administrative tools and continue to meet expectations. Administrators are active and alert when they a) have at least 1 edit within the past month and 20 edits within the past year, or b) have done at least one administrative related activity within the past year and respond to messages left on their user discussion page within 30 days.

Bureaucrats must determine when and if discussion reaches a consensus according to the '''high-impact''' [[Wikibooks:Decision making|decision making]] rules and may decide not to act either way. Only when no active bureaucrats are available may a request be made to [[Meta:Requests for permissions]] with a link to the local discussion.

== Granting bureaucrat tools ==
'''Bureaucrats''' are active and experienced administrators trusted to perform additional tasks such as change usernames, create new administrators, and flag accounts as bots. Granting bureaucrat tools is a more weighty decision than the granting of administration tools, and therefore community members should take it more seriously. The same rules and manner for granting administration tools apply to granting bureaucrat tools, except only those with administration tools can be granted bureaucrat tools and candidates ''must'' be advertised in the [[WB:RR|Reading Room]] and the [[WB:BB|Bulletin Board]].

Prospective candidates should be:

# Experienced administrators who understand the expectations of the community,
# Well-respected and trusted by the community and other administrators, and
# Able to keep a cool head under pressure

== Granting checkuser tools ==
'''Checkusers''' are active and experienced Administrators trusted to perform additional tasks such as identify sockpuppets and repeat vandalism offenders. Granting Checkuser tools, like Bureaucrat tools, is a more weighty decision that should be taken more seriously. Prospective candidates must already have Administrator or Bureaucrat tools, must be announced in the [[WB:RR|Reading room]] and on the [[WB:BB|Bulletin Board]], and must demonstrate a consensus at [[Wikibooks:Requests for permissions]]. After consensus is established, a request must be made to [[Meta:Requests for permissions]]. See [[Meta:CheckUser policy]] for other requirements that may apply.

== Removing tools ==
Community members can request immediate removal of their own tools at [[Meta:Requests for permissions#Removal_of_access]], automatically qualify by not meeting activity expectations (as previously defined) without need for discussion or consensus, or be nominated by another member at [[Wikibooks:Requests for permissions]]. Nominees '''must''' be contacted both on their discussion page and by email (when available) to be given a reasonable chance to contest the nomination. All reasons for a nomination should be stated clearly to give everyone a fair and reasonable understanding of why a decision on the matter is called for. All nominations must be advertised in the [[WB:RR|Reading room]] and the [[WB:BB|Bulletin Board]]. If a decision to remove the tools is reached, a request must be made at [[Meta:Requests for permissions#Removal_of_access]]. Anyone may reapply at a later date without prejudice.

=Alternative Removal Proposal=

== Removal of Administrator Rights Due to Low Activity ==

As helpful members of the community, Wikibooks administrators are expected to provide the community with timely assistance when needed or requested and maintain a general understanding of the current Wikibooks environment and policies. In order to meet these expectations an administrator needs to be active. 

If the activity expectations defined below are not met then any autoconfirmed Wikibooks user can propose the removal of administrator rights at [[Wikibooks:Requests for permissions]]. It is a requirement that the proposer notifies the administrator on both their talk page and via the &quot;E-mail this user&quot; function that a de-admin proposal has been started.

Low activity is defined as follows. The administrator:

#Has not performed an administrative function (see [http://toolserver.org/~vvv/adminstats.php?wiki=enwikibooks_p&amp;tlimit=31536000 here]) in the last six months.
#Has performed less than five administrative functions in the last year
#Has made less than 20 edits to Wikibooks in the last year
#Has made no edits to Wikibooks in the last six months

Inactivity based de-admin proposals may be closed immediately as unsuccessful by any uninvolved administrator if at least one of the criteria defined above is met by the administrator being proposed for de-admin.

As the appointment and removal of administrators is a decision for the Wikibooks community, only the opinions of logged in autoconfirmed editors will be considered. Comments from editors who are not logged in or are not autoconfirmed will be removed from the discussion.

If after one month if there is no objection to the removal (including from the administrator being discussed) then a Bureaucrat will close the discussion and raise a request for a [[meta:Steward_requests/Permissions#Removal_of_access|Steward]] to complete the de-admin.

If after one month there are any objections raised (including from the administrator being discussed) then a Bureaucrat will judge the consensus and determine whether to close the proposal as unsuccessful or raise a request to complete the de-admin.

In the event of a proposal being unsuccessful then no further de-admin request for low activity may be made for three months from the closing date of the previous request except where the administrator meets the criteria for removal due to inactivity defined below.

==Removal of Administrator Rights Due to Inactivity==

Any administrator who is completely inactive, as defined below, can have their administrator rights removed without discussion. Removal for inactivity is a requirement to protect Wikibooks against the risk of inactive privileged accounts being compromised.

An administrator is considered inactive if:

* There has been no use of the administrator flag in one year.
* There has been no edit to any Wikibooks page in one year.

In the case of an inactive administrator a notification will be placed at [[Wikibooks:Requests for permissions]]. It is a requirement that the proposer notifies the administrator on both their talk page and via the &quot;E-mail this user&quot; function that a de-admin proposal has been started.

No discussion will take place for an inactive administrator de-admin. If the inactive administrator does not become active within the one month notice period then any user may request a [[meta:Steward_requests/Permissions#Removal_of_access|Steward]] to complete the de-admin.

==Reinstatement when Activity Resumes==

Any administrator removed for inactivity can within a six month period following the removal request the return of the administrator flag. A request must be raised at [[Wikibooks:Requests for permissions]] to give other editors the opportunity to raise any concerns. 

==Removal of Bureaucrat and Checkuser Rights==

The low level of Bureaucrat and Checkuser activity required at Wikibooks means there is no activity requirement in order to retain these rights. However, any Bureaucrat or Checkuser who has their administrator rights removed for low activity or inactivity will also have their Bureaucrat and Checkuser rights removed.

== Bold &amp; unblocking ==

I'll read more as soon as I have time BUT as it stands I would have an issue with that bit.  A couple of times I have unblocked an ip or vandal account blocked by another admin in order to block for longer (possibly after having looked at the equivalent WP page).  It is not something I would do lightly but I would certainly do it.  I stress I am referring to vandalism (by IP or registered user) blocks.  I have also seen other admins do the same and have merely considered it interesting &amp; instructive --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 17:22, 19 February 2007 (UTC)

:We can put in an exception for blocked accounts which are later discovered to to be repeat vandals or something simialar.

I think one year of inactivity is too long to wait before removing the tools. A lot can and does happen around here in shorter periods of time. Having the tools should be about having a current need for the tools to the benefit of the community and a current understanding of the community, rather than for ones own benefit. I'm thinking rules should be more tight, while at the same time being a little bit more forgiving.

Perhaps 3 months of complete inactivity, no contributions or involvement in any discussions on talk pages, IRC, the mailing list, Wikimania, local chapters, etc. and no use of the administrative tools, in other words, a complete halt of any dealings with Wikibooks, should be enough to have the tools removed. Since there not around to use them, its not benefiting the community for them to continue to have them, so they should be removed. I also think an upper limit would also be useful, such as 6 months or more of not having used the administration tools at least a few times, even if there active in other ways, should be enough to have the tools removed. Again because its not benefiting the community for them to continue to have them, when there not being used.

However I think the bureaucrats, in there best judgment, should be able to give the tools again to anyone whose had the tools removed this way without much hassle and without the person having to repeat the entire RFA process over again, provided they demonstrate a need for the tools again to the benefit of the community and nobody objects. This principal of having a need to the benefit of the community should be emphasized more in the policy. On a somewhat related side note, I don't like how &quot;trusted members of the community&quot; was removed and think it should be reintroduced. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:59, 8 August 2007 (UTC)

:Put the &quot;trusted&quot; bit back DL - it is an important aspect of admin for me (can't see where it came out).  My views are pretty much the same as yours I think.  On &quot;getting it back&quot; I'm fine with those who give up voluntarily (just worked ok on Commons with a request and a quick 24 straw poll) not sure about those who have been de-admin'd though.  It's not top of my list but I'll look at the page some more though I'm sure the protesters will arrive.  They've just sent out the news to the inactive ones on Commons - some are coming back and saying &quot;when did that happen, where etc etc&quot; - I've resisted the temptation to point out had they been active they would have seen it so far! --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 15:20, 8 August 2007 (UTC)

:I like what you've said but would like the limits to go to 6m/1y instead of 3m/6m since we're not overburdened with admin tasks here and some people really do disappear for more than three months at a time. Having the &quot;easy in&quot; for a later RFA could solve almost all these activity issues should a user return but I still like the buffer being bigger so it's not a common occurrence. Disagreements? I also agree that trust should have some stance here. An admin doesn't always have to be very well-rounded either, at least if they're experienced. The situation I want to avoid is having people become admins that are brand new and have only worked on their book. If they can spread out just a little bit over a longer period of time I'm more comfortable. Many of us tend to have personal projects and live in our own worlds, something that shouldn't be discouraged but admins should know to take a few walks around the block from time to time. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 16:47, 8 August 2007 (UTC)

::I understand the concern with new users becoming administrators. The reason for suggesting 3m/6m is for a similar reason. After being gone for that long they can be much like new users, disconnected with the community and what the community will accept or disapprove of. That could possibly puts them in a position of not knowing any more what benefits the community. I think anyone who is infrequently involved with Wikibooks is better off finding other ways to help Wikibooks rather than having administration tools. I don't think infrequent Wikibookians with the tools benefits the community. I think its a good thing that many of the administrators have personal projects that they work on. I think someone who just pops in every once in awhile just to use the administrator tools, is not a good thing, since there not around to answer questions, which can discourage users. Administrators should be reliable, which is a part of trust. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 18:15, 8 August 2007 (UTC)

:::I kinda agree -I kinda don't!  (not about new users, about those with projects).  Take Az &amp; I, no projects but we have some of the highest admin action counts.  Not saying anyone is better than anyone else just that we all need to be part of a team (almost exactly the same lines as I  used on Commons earlier today).  Wiki experience is important, cross wiki experience may be good.

:: How about 3 months of complete inactivity unless the person mentions on there user page that there going on a hiatus from Wikibooks for more then 3 months with intentions to come back? I notice a few of the admins already do mention when there going to be away for awhile, and perhaps this practice should be encouraged? So perhaps then 3 months from that time if they have not returned remove the tools? Something like when-will-return + 3 months with some upper limit on how long someone can be on hiatus without removing the tools? Maybe also encourage people to give up the tools if they know there going to be gone awhile but unsure for how long. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 11:44, 17 August 2007 (UTC)

:::I'm with Withinfocus, 3 months is just far too short a time for this. Nothing is going to change, policy-wise, in 3 months. We dont need to worry that after a 3 month vacation that somebody is going to be completely out of the loop. When the de-adminship policy had first been introduced, Wikibooks policy had gone through some very substantial chagnes. However, nothing has really changed here on the policy front in a long while (at least no substantial changes that would disorient an admin). 
:::6 months is better but still not enough. Wikibooks policy does not change substantially in a 6 month period. I think that instead of making the timelimit 6 months, we keep it at a year and we require all admins to register a valid email address. If there is an emergency where an extra admin is needed, they should be contactable via email. If an admin is completely inactive ''and cannot be contacted via email or any other method'', then we can talk about desysopping them when we are inable to get in contact with them. A sysop who is generally inactive but available &quot;on call&quot; is far better then an admin who is absent and unreachable. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 12:24, 17 August 2007 (UTC)

:::: Its not about policy changes, or changes in the community which can happen more frequently, but about alertness and a continued need for the tools. Sure we're all volunteers and need a break from time to time, but I think it should be kept in mind that everyone whose got the tools accepted the extra volunteer work. If someone doesn't have enough time to do the extra work, its better to find someone who does, then having to wait for someone to try to track down someone by email to take care of vandalism or some other issue, because there inactive on the project. 3 months is a long time to me to be completely inactive without any indication that they intent to be part of the project still and 6 months an even longer time to be unresponsive to users. While in some ways I believe inactive should only include activity on the wiki, I did include in my earlier suggestion that email, IRC, the mailing list, etc. be included in determining inactivity. So if someone is contacted by email and responds they would not be considered inactive. So in that way I'm also broadening what it takes to be considered inactive, even if I don't completely like it, because I figured it would be a good compromise that people could live with. People would have to basically ''drop off the face of the planet with no means of communication'' for 3 months and having not indicated any intent to continue being part of the project, before being considered inactive. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 12:51, 17 August 2007 (UTC)

:::::3 months is a short summer, and it's not inconceivable that an admin could take a 3 month tour of europe, or do volunteer work in an area with no internet connectivity for a year. It's also not inconceivable that a school student could not find a time to stop in and say &quot;hello&quot; for the last 3 months of a busy semester. There's a difference between having to be active and having to &quot;check in&quot;. A person can be absent for 3 months, not missed a thing, and have every intention to return at the earliest possible convenience. A year is different, things can change in a year and what is important to you one day (ie Wikibooks) might not be important to you on that same day next year. A person who has been absent for a year has had plenty of opportunity, and has demonstrated no intention to return. A person who is inactive for 3 months is just busy and can still be back. 
:::::Hecktic reorganziation at work, a tough semester, a long vacation, moving cross-country (or even internationally), having children, etc. These are all things that could easily cause a person to miss 3 months of work. If you get temporarily swept up in your life, that doesnt mean that you are neglecting your duties here. People should be allowed to take some time off without having to inconvenience them when they return. 3 months is too short for this. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 13:31, 17 August 2007 (UTC)

A year is to long and 3 moths is also to small, some people may have problems in their personal life or unable to get any activity on the project (we also shouldn't force symbolic activity just to be kept alive). I have added a new expectation the '''be available''' this will solve most cases were we need to verify that the Wikibookian still wishes and intends in using the toolset.

I think 4 moths  would be acceptable and 6 moths to a year if a good reason is given/stated on the user/talk page. By being available we can get in touch with the Wikibookians if a priority event needs participation (like voting on policies and guidelines (probably any high impact decisions in general would warrant an effort to contact them).

As for {{User|Lord_Voldemort}}, {{User|Kernigh}} and {{User|Guanaco}} don't have an active email I was going to contact them since they have been absent of the project for to a long time.

== Changes ==

I've made a few!  Having been working on Commons admin policy I thought I would review ours again.  Others may disagree (of course) but these are &quot;rights&quot; not &quot;privileges&quot; for example and, in my view, admins '''must''' follow policy and set an example for instance.  On Commons you will not get to be an admin without email being enabled and this seems sensible to allow folk to make contact that way and wish to say something &quot;off wiki&quot;.

The &quot;Activity&quot; expectations confuse me.  If they refer to activity '''after''' becoming an admin then we have policy for de-admin that specifies activity there.  If it is a requirement prior to being considered for admin then the minimum is frankly laughable and should either be removed made more realistic.  I'm out of time now but will return to this again I think - cheers --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 11:57, 6 August 2007 (UTC)

:I threw in a change or two myself, mostly just copyediting. I'm not exactly sure what you're saying about activity, but I don't see the activity requirement as being applicable to the pre-sysop period since that gets evaluated when the user is up for voting on RFA. After RFA we need to set an activity standard since there's no periodic evaluation period and so this provides that evaluation ability. Yes, it is a very long time for inactivity but that was the best the community could agree to at the time. I might not mind a shorter period myself, but would still like six months or so as a window of return. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 12:27, 6 August 2007 (UTC)

I did some changes, but I personally think that this should be a guideline rather then a policy. Couldn't it go into the admin policy entirely anyway? Thanks, [[User:Laleena|Laleena]] ([[User talk:Laleena|talk]]) 18:04, 5 January 2008 (UTC)

:I think you misunderstood the intent of this page. This is a proposal to update the current admin policy, rather then complement it. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 21:47, 5 January 2008 (UTC)

== Admistrators not recently working ==

the list ''Wikibookians with extra tools'' need to be reviewed.[[User:Ricardoramalho|Ricardoramalho]] ([[User talk:Ricardoramalho|talk]]) 17:16, 20 April 2009 (UTC)

: This is an unstable branch and as such people tend to overlook it. You should be looking at [[Wikibooks:Administrators#List of administrators]] or [[Special:ListAdmins]] instead. However I went ahead and updated the list for the unstable branch, since its been awhile since that list was last updated. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 18:23, 21 April 2009 (UTC)

== Declaration of concurrent positions... ==
I have talked at least two times about the benefits and help to determine the commitment one can give to the project as he is ushered into a new function, there are several aspects of the issue that have come into the talks:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A. Should there be a limit to functions a person may accumulate on at least Wikimedia projects? How far is too far?
:Logic dictates that if a scarce resource (time) is to be split across several interests as the number of interest increase the time alloted will also decrease (even if we wish to be as participative as possible), there is no way one may create more time unless reducing the level of commitments. In fact this may be a important aspect on determining if a person will have the time to commit to the project or how efficient one can be on some functions (since projects aren't just different but the rules that guide some of the functions are very distinct across projects). 
B. Should we benefit from an obligation to disclose/state this information?
:It seems that the information is already public but not easily centralized or standardized, making it a requirement to state the occupied positions in some standard way would not only help consider A) but permit to establish a better collaboration to other projects, for a little more work as a downside some real benefits can be extracted.
I put this forward so we bring this point to the table on this proposal, it is uncontested that experience in a position across projects can be beneficial but having people going after functions as a sort of title and in position just to do the bare minimum shouldn't be what we aim for but this considerations should be studied or have an impact given the status of minimum requirements. This isn't a pressing issue, not considering the numbers of admins we have on the project (the other positions are somewhat dependent and mostly in scale), but is a pertinent topic to bring to this discussion.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 20:41, 21 April 2009 (UTC)

: I see neither the necessity nor usefulness of such a limit. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 05:24, 22 April 2009 (UTC)

:And... (In this process I'm not after your commitment to the concept, but just your input or valid objections on such requirements/considerations, the above line doesn't provide any insight or advances the issue)
:The points used above were taken from previous discussions on the issue. But I can provide you further examples. Like the use of checkusers across Wikimedia projects, this can be seen as colliding with the presumable privacy of users, we all have right to some level of privacy, if we so desire it. Since the projects don't force a common login, users do presume to have some independence across projects, having checkuser on more than on project does pose some issues in that regard, without disregarding all parties well intentions (I confess I don't know all the checks and balances that are available to that toolset, but from previous discussions assume that not much exists or is logged except in cases of blatant abuse of power, there isn't any requirement that prevents a checkuser to share that user x on project y is the same as z on project w).
:Another consideration that has an impact on the availability of this information is that if a user loses some flags in other projects (due to abuse, wrong doing) shouldn't we consider removing the flags here also ? I'm against blocking users across projects (we do it for open proxys) but rogue admins+ flags is a different thing the use of the toolsets are extremely similar across all projects, and in this case all seem to fall down to very simple common moral grounds.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 06:10, 22 April 2009 (UTC)

:: My previous comment was not intended to show the level of my commitment to any concept. It ''is'' a valid input as it states my view that you've failed to argue for the necessity or usefulness of limiting the number of tools that users may have across projects, and requiring users to disclose their other obligations.
:: Users are free to ask questions to users nominated for Checkuser tools, and nominees are free to answer or not. Community members then decided whether they feel happy about granting the nominee the tools. As far as I know, this natural process has served us well enough so far and I haven't heard of a single case of abuse. We don't need a policy for this. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 20:01, 22 April 2009 (UTC)

::: So you are saying that having multiple commitments to several somewhat similar projects should have no barring on the level of commitment one can expect to bring as he/she steps into functions ? 
::: I don't agree with that nor that it shouldn't be important on the attribution of the tools. The tools are given to be used not as a matter of title or achievement, this would be a simple way of elevating the level participation on those performing the functions, as long as the user is willing to perform them, not reduce the positions the something like a statute badge that requires a minimum of work to be maintained (this community expectation is already stated in several texts) and I have seen several times (not on Wikibook) users criticize other users that seem to aspire to accumulate such functions.
::: What I'm asking is if should there be a limit on the level of commitments for people that are put forward to perform such functions (not as a block to a need to use basis, but as a protection to keep people centered on this project and on the job).
::: A clear information on the functions of key personal on other projects IS useful and for the normal Wikibookians can be hard to establish, unless they are involved in the other projects too. Having the information that is somewhat public (most users on those functions share the login across project) centralized and structured would be important to coordination of work across projects, so things can be done more efficiently. Having people with tools across projects is often of great benefit.
::: Should the number of positions one has be somehow limited in number ?
::: I see some benefits on keeping people committed and interested to this project and to the functions they are expected to perform here. I'm not arguing for a ban (except in the checkuser case), but for the benefits to this project of reducing admin+ commitments elsewhere.  
::: Some of the questions I'm putting on the table are similar to proposal to increase the minimum requirements of participation to keep the tools. In any case this issues aren't very pertinent to our present situation (mostly due to number of people in function) but are issues that should be considered before this draft is put for adoption.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 02:39, 23 April 2009 (UTC)

== &quot;Only the opinions of logged in autoconfirmed editors will be considered&quot; ==
This is not required since the process is not a vote. Any unlogged participant will have the same burden of providing a good reason for the objection to the removal, I do not particularly see how the identification is important (of course the CU can still be used in cases of grave allegations or clear misbehavior but asside from that since numbers are inrelevant what is the point of excluding anyone.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 22:22, 10 April 2012 (UTC)
:I put it in purely as a proposal following a talk page discussion with Pi zero. Broadly it comes down to whether we want to make this a &quot;community&quot; decision, which essentially means those with some edits here who are logged in, or an &quot;anyone&quot; decision which would include IPs. For Checkuser elections the Stewards were questioning whether editors with a small number of edits were &quot;valid&quot; votes (and for CUs it is a vote) so somewhere we should have something (even if it is just for CUs) that defines what valid means. On the removal part I do feel that proposals for removal of rights for &quot;misconduct&quot; should be restricted to logged in users with autoconfirmed accounts to avoid abuse by vandals. The alternative is a situation where all five active admins all get a &quot;de-admin&quot; proposal put up by a vandal operating multiple IPs or accounts which all have to be left to run their course... &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 22:31, 10 April 2012 (UTC)

::Wouldn't it suffice to only validate processes that have at least one registered user support (autoconfirmed will not make any difference, and there may be valid reasons for a unregistered user to initiate the process) But why protect only admins to this risk?
::CU voting participation is a bit distinct since the process is not defined here but at meta (any requirements should point to the relevant meta rules of vote), since we can't change the process here...
::I note that for instance Darklama is not autoconfirmed (nor do I see it as a needed requirement for admin). This is interesting because reviewers today need to be autoconfirmed and we may have several that are not. Beyond the ease of contact I do not see a special interest in requiring autoconfirmation (it is hardly a security feature). There are advantages but should it be an obligation ? CU and Burucrasts are distinct in this because of outside requirements and they are few in numbers.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 22:46, 10 April 2012 (UTC)</text>

== [[Wikibooks:Resolving disputes]] ==

I'd like to bring to everyone's attention to [[Wikibooks:Resolving disputes]] which I'd like to make an official policy as soon as possible. The page's style reflects common procedures on Wikimedia sites. Please make changes if you wish or leave comments on the talk page. Thanks. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 21:45, 20 January 2007 (UTC)

== Arbitration Policy ==

There are a number of discussions, and policy proposals swirling around concerning the topic of arbitration. &quot;Arbitration&quot; in this instance is the act of one group of wikibookians imposing a binding solution onto a dispute among other wikibookians. In general, People who advocate for the existance of such an arbitration process say that it should be reserved as a &quot;last resort&quot;.

I would like to take a basic straw poll among the community on this issue, to gauge where everybody stands (not just the people who are most vocal on the policy discussion pages). I am asking that people vote '''support''' or '''oppose''' in the space below, and reserve any comments for the space below the polls. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 05:14, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

===Question 1: Should Wikibooks use formal (specified in policy) arbitration to settle disputes?===

* Yes.  If it is requested by the defendent of the dispute and if a neutral arbitrator can be found. [[User:Xania|Xania]] [[Image:Flag_of_Poland_2.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 16:29, 5 February 2007 (UTC)
* '''Oppose''' There should be a formal policy to settle disputes when [[Wikibooks:Decision making]] fails, but not in the form of arbitration. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 17:00, 5 February 2007 (UTC)
* '''Absolutely''' having an effective policy to handle disputes between users without dragging the whole community into the minutia of the argument is critically important. -- [[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 18:33, 5 February 2007 (UTC)
* '''Support'''. With a process for this outlined, and a set of requirements in place that must be satisfied before arbitration can begin, we can avoid things like vigilante arbitration, or ad hoc arbitration, which may turn out to be problems. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:21, 6 February 2007 (UTC)
* '''Support'''. But it must be used very rarely. A &quot;final word&quot; arbitration must be settled somehow, and once the rules are nicely laid out, we should be fine. It will be a difficult job of making a good arbitration process, but I feel that in the long run, it would be worth it. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 07:24, 7 February 2007 (UTC)
* '''Support''' [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 14:57, 14 February 2007 (UTC)
* '''Support''' - Don't know if I can vote but this is important to me.  I can see being involved in this process myself as I try to stand up against the ed establishment [[User:Harriska2|Harriska2]] 15:43, 14 February 2007 (UTC) 

===Question 2: Is arbitration, or other intervention, an acceptable way to resolve disputes concerning book content?===

* Ideally no.  Disputes concerning content should preferably be kept confined to the talk pages of the book concerned. [[User:Xania|Xania]] [[Image:Flag_of_Poland_2.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 16:29, 5 February 2007 (UTC)
* '''Oppose''' I agree with Xania, content disputes should ideally be settled through discussion on the talk pages of the book it concerns. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 17:00, 5 February 2007 (UTC)
* '''Support''' - Content disagreement should generally be solved by the authors. However a process needs to be created to avoid home grown processes. -- [[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 18:33, 5 February 2007 (UTC)
*'''Support'''. The current [[Wikibooks:Decision making|decision making process]] is geared specifically towards matters of book content, and not towards behavior or policy violations. There comes a point when intervention is required in a dispute (hopefully most disputes don't get that far). We also need to have some kind of &quot;final say&quot; so that situations don't get out of hand with endless appeals and bickering. A decision is worthless if it is second-guessed and over-turned repeatedly, and we need to be able to make decisions and stand by them. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:23, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

*'''No''', however, should these disputes evolve into edit wars, flaming, and so forth, arbitration may be seen as an option. But book content should be settled by the authors, and again, only used as a last resort. Personally; I'd rather see the book forked than arbitration used. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 07:26, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

* '''Yes, but...''', not arbitration except in extreme battles such as darwinists vs creationists in a biology book or galilean relativity vs modern relativity in a physics book etc. [[Wikibooks:Dispute resolution|dispute resolution]] looks like the right way to go. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 14:59, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

* '''Support''' - again, I can see this happening - try the instructivist vs. constructivist approaches to teaching subjects. [[User:Harriska2|Harriska2]] 15:43, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

===Question 3: Should Wikibooks have a standing &quot;Arbitration Committee&quot; to handle arbitration cases?===

* With such a small community it wouldn't be possible for a permanent committee to remain neutral so committee members should be chosen and agreed upon by the concerned parties for each dispute. [[User:Xania|Xania]] [[Image:Flag_of_Poland_2.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 16:29, 5 February 2007 (UTC)
* '''Oppose''' Wikibooks has a small community and its not been well established yet by the community through experience how best to handle such situations. I believe its too soon to be suggesting an &quot;arbitration committee&quot;. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 17:00, 5 February 2007 (UTC)
* &lt;strike&gt;'''Oppose'''&lt;/strike&gt; - I agree with Xania. There is no need for a standing arbitration committee. Arbiters can self-identify at the time arbitration commences. -- [[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 18:33, 5 February 2007 (UTC)
:'''Neutral''' - if others see a standing arbitration committee as being beneficial, I will not stand in the way. -- [[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:08, 20 February 2007 (UTC)
* '''Support'''. At the very least we need to have a list of people qualified to act as arbitrators, and we should specify that an arbitration case must be overseen by more then one arbiter. In this way we can prevent allegations of &quot;abuse of power&quot;, and we can also prevent situations where an arbitration case is stalled because of arbiter inactivity. A standing committee may be too much, but the spirit of the idea is a valuable one. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:26, 6 February 2007 (UTC)
* '''Neutral''' : With the current scheme, some sort of arbitration committee seems like it could work. Then again, it could easily work against us. If the committee is seen to be powerful, then it would be seen as corrupt, especially when this community gets larger. It would probably work now with this small community, but we may outgrow it in the future. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 07:27, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

* '''Support''' An arbitration committee clarifies procedures.  Without an established process that has a definite termination point we will end up with the anarchy of admins fighting wheel wars! Sensible &quot;laws&quot; and procedures protect the community. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 15:01, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

* '''Support''' [[User:Harriska2|Harriska2]] 15:43, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

===Question 4: Should informal or ad hoc binding arbitration be allowed to settle disputes on Wikibooks, with or without the existence of a formal policy on Arbitration?===

* No. [[User:Xania|Xania]] [[Image:Flag_of_Poland_2.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 16:29, 5 February 2007 (UTC)
* '''Neutral''' I'm still a bit undecided on this point. I think perhaps maybe a balance between formal and informa might be best. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 17:00, 5 February 2007 (UTC)
* '''Yes.''' If explicitly agreed to in advance by all parties. -- [[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 18:33, 5 February 2007 (UTC)
*'''Oppose'''. Ad hoc or informal arbitration should not have the authority to impose binding decisions, especially on important subjects. An ad hoc arbiter should not be able to block or unblock a user, protect pages, etc. Also, we should discourage people from trying to take a situation onto their own shoulders, as arbitration can be a nasty and dirty process. Arbitration without proper community backing can turn into a disaster, for both the parties involved and the arbiter. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:30, 6 February 2007 (UTC)
* '''Support''' if the ad hoc committee were composed of admins who obey the rules in [[Wikibooks:Arbitration Committee| Arbitration Committee]] [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 15:08, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

* '''Support''' [[User:Harriska2|Harriska2]] 15:43, 14 February 2007 (UTC)
===Comments:===
* Regarding the current arbitration I'd prefer to see the original arbitrator make his decision.  Arbitration may not have been decided by everyone here but it started without much voiced opposition and should be allowed to continue.  Punishments should reflect the ''crime''.  Remember this is just a Wiki and banning people for 6 months is utter nonsense - work with all parties to reach a compromise rather than punishing!  [[User:Xania|Xania]] [[Image:Flag_of_Poland_2.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 16:29, 5 February 2007 (UTC)
:I am puzzled, [[User:Xania|Xania]], you opposed a standing arbitration committee by saying admins could come together on an ad hoc basis then you opposed the ad hoc committee. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 15:05, 14 February 2007 (UTC)
* I believe until the community has more experience with finding ways to end disputes and finds a way that works to the satisfaction of the majority of community that this matter won't end. I think the community needs to be involved in making any decision and in trying out different methods to try to solve the problem, until something is found that the majority of the community prefers. I think since everything up to mediation seems to be undisputed that mediation should perhaps be the last formal step for now, with a less formal method for a final decision, such as suggesting how best to handle it and make a decision will be discussed beforehand on an individual bases. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 17:00, 5 February 2007 (UTC) 
:: '''Strongly oppose''' maintaining the status quo as suggested by Darklama. -- [[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 18:33, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

::: '''Comment''' [[Wikibooks:Decision making]] already exists as a process to avoid &quot;home grown&quot; processes for content and policy decisions, so there is no need to create one. There is a need however for establishing what to do when that doesn't work, such as using mediation. I don't consider a community decision to be maintaining the status quo. Through discussion and a desire for change by the community, changes are made. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 19:01, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

*I think that we need to have some formalized method for putting a final end to disputes involving behavior problems or policy violations. This will reduce the endless process of appeals, and it will also prevent admins from feeling that they need to &quot;step in&quot; and take over when things get really out of hand. Some formal method is needed, although I won't say it ''must be'' an arbitration committee. Keep in mind that if we had such a policy (be it a pool of qualified arbiters, or a standing committee) we could then be very strict in the cases that the arbiters are allowed to hear, thus preventing any such group from being too pervasive or too powerful. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:37, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

== Taming the elephant in the room... ==

The &quot;arbitration&quot; involving a problematic user ([[User:Panic2k4]])has not been well accepted by some, and I'm still interested in seeing if we can't find a way to keep him part of the project, while at trhe same time avoiding future conflicts. I'm hoping to have a constructive dialog with him about the issues involved, and I think it would be helpful if the community voiced their support for this. My approach will be to lead him through the following steps, in the hopes that this will lead to his re-integration into the community as a positive contributor:
#He should think back on all of this and express his understanding of why people find him so hard to work with.
#He should come up with a strategy to avoid this problem in the future
#He should make a commitment in writing to get along with his fellow contributors
#He should agree to having a moderator (or a panel of moderators), and to expect further blocks if he goes back on his commitments or comes up with novel ways of making other people miserable (indefinite blocks that will involve going through steps 1-3 again, with additions to step 3 if appropriate). 

I know this guy a bit now, and while I'm not confident this will work, I think it's worth a try. You can follow the process [[User_talk:Panic2k4#Trying_to_explain|here]], but I ask that uninvolved parties not comment there for now. Please indicate your support or opposition! --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:51, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

&lt;strike&gt;* '''Support''' - I'm in favour provided this is agreed to by Panic, provided indefinate blocks are not used and Panic is unblocked once this is agreed.

* '''Comment''' I can no longer support this proposal.  Reading comments by some users here and the wording of this proposal leads me to the conclusion that many Wikibooks members have some sort of personal vendetta against Panic.  He has done wrong but so have other editors of the concerned project.  My opinion now is that Panic should be unblocked completely with no punishment as this is out of hand and people seem to want some blood for what they believe was wrongdoing.  Grow up everyone, unblock Panic and get on with your lives.  [[User:Xania|Xania]] [[Image:Flag_of_Poland_2.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 12:31, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

* &lt;s&gt;'''Comment''' Some of the terminology here makes panic sound more like an untamed animal, or some kind of science experiment.

*'''Comment''' - I think we all need to step back for at least two weeks... disengage. Panic feels wronged and I think I understand why. I know that I would feel wronged if I were in a similar situation. There is a wide range of opinions here about the terms of Panic's return and despite the tally of support, support, support everyone seems to have different stipulations. Instead, I say let things stand for a couple weeks and then revisit this with calm reasoned thinking and together decide what steps are most likely to achieve the desired outcome. --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 03:43, 6 February 2007 (UTC)
*'''Comment''' - I'm not at all involved in this and don't feel qualified to have a vote in it one way or the other.

[[User:Chazz|Chazz]] 09:00, 6 February 2007 (UTC)
*'''Oppose''' - I think that first of all, Johnny is perhaps one of the least qualified to help out here.  Mainly because he is percieved (rightly or wrongly) as an &quot;enemy&quot; to Panic and openly hostle.  At the very least he needs to step back and leave this alone for awhile.  While I will admit that Panic does have an abraisive personality, I fail to see where that is against Wikibooks policies.  Doing on-line collaborative writing takes people of all sorts of personalities and this is something that simply needs to be dealt with socially, not through arbitrary technical approaches.  User blocks are not working here anyway, and is not the solution.  Let's let the current two-week user block for Panic stay here, and have everybody take a &quot;chill pill&quot; for the next two weeks and not even worry about this issue at all.  When the two weeks are over, then we can come back and try to &quot;restart&quot; the arbitration so far as to find a final solution to this whole thing.  And to think that my &quot;two weeks&quot; of feet dragging was considered excessive here.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 13:29, 6 February 2007 (UTC)
:: '''Comment''' I disagree that Johnny is not qualified. I agree that he faces an uphill battle that will make it hard to succeed. But he is willing and able which may be a unique combination of qualifications in this circumstance. I suspect my position that the ban is too harsh is well known, but I do not support making any changes to the ban at this time, or calling it a two week ban. It's a six month ban until (when and if) the community in open discussion develops consensus to change it. Two weeks is February 20th. Let's revisit then. --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 14:12, 6 February 2007 (UTC)
*'''Comment''' - The events of the past several hours have been, uh, rather odd. First just to set the record straight, &quot;Elephant in the Room&quot; is an expression meaning &quot;the obvious thing we're not talking about&quot;, and I did not mean to imply anything about Panic's animal nature, large nose, or the lack of either. It was an unfortunate play on words, and I offer my apologies to any who misunderstood it. On another record-straightening note, the wheel-warring last night is a very dangerous game, and Xania and Withinfocus should both bear in mind that Robert ''did'' discuss undoing my block of Panic before he did it, and I made it clear that whether or not Panic was blocked was up to him, since he had taken over.
:My original blocks of Panic were meant to simply stop him in his tracks, in order to discuss things with him before things got re-heated, which became a lot easier to do after bug 8001 (which allows blocked users to edit their pages... I had originally pushed for that in order to prevent unintended collateral blockings of IPs using autoblock, but it works well for this too). I've said before and I'll say again, Panic is a human being who obviously cares deeply about the book he's contributed to, and I'd rather see him here than gone. However, he has a long history of not getting along with other contributors, which has been a detriment not only to the book he cares so much about, but to the wikibooks community as a whole because it's just hard for us to deal with this sort of thing (Wikipedia, for example, would have just banned him long ago and moved on to the next problem). 
:My offer is still open, and I still think it's a good approach. If it's decided that I'm not the right guy to do this, that's fine, but I think it would be a good idea if ''someone'' talked him through this, because whether he indends to or not Panic seems to attract and/or cause trouble, and at the moment he insists that it's everyone's fault but his own. 
:My intent in bring this up here on the staff lounge was to get some discussion of this &quot;on the record and in the open&quot;, since words like &quot;consensus&quot;, &quot;unilateralism&quot;, and &quot;conspiracy&quot; are being thrown around lately in a rather meaningless fashion. For now I think it's reasonable to just try to keep talking to him. Above all else, let's please try to keep a lid on the drama. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:17, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

===Proposition 2.0===
While I understand that the events of the past 24 hours might be discouraging to say the least, I think we should not not let the angry words and actions of a few rule us... in fact I think what has happened should only serve as evidence for making a solution now, so we don't have to go through this again. 

While my particular style might be a bit off-putting to those who aren't used to it, I assure you that my only interest is to try and get this thing settled so that we can move on to other things (which might or might not be bigger and/or better, depending on your point of view). 

I want full community support, so that I can talk to Panic as the community's representative. I need to feel free to use the block tool in this endeavor, but I will not use it punitively or unfairly. I'm asking for a leap of faith now, with the assurance that I will stop if there is an objection. We've talked about 2 weeks... give me that much time, and if it looks unfair after that, I will withdraw. 

I will do my best not to disappoint you, but it's not going to work unless I have your support. This can't wait... it won't go away if we ignore it, and some wounds will fester if not treated. Please assume my good faith, and give me a chance to prove my competence. My sole objective in this will be to get [[User:Panic2k4]] to ''try'' to be a positive part of this community.

Let's get this done. I need two weeks to do my job without review or comment, and I'm confident that there will be no need for review or comment after the 2 weeks are up. Please indicate your support or opposition. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:24, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

:{{support}} I think it's better for them to try and work it out than just arguing over what to do, and Johnny seems to know more about it than most of us. I do not think that Johnny's intent is to just go after him and look for an excuse to block him again, and I feel that if they can talk and reconcile their differences (which may be difficult but would be necessary before anything could be accomplished as far as what is expected of him and what is expected of us in our relations to him and other contributors) then the whole situation will be much improved. 
:I'd suggest though, and hope, that Johnny only block based on something Panic says or does outside the negotiation, we're all a little heated lately and Panic, I'm sure, isn't the only one who's violated civility policies in the midst of discussions, especially as this drags on. Johnny has been patient, to be sure, and I think will use the tool wisely.
:We can discuss actual arbirtation policy separately, as the previous attempt has clearly fallen apart and IMO there's no use trying to run it through another formal process (or trying to continue this one) until we have some sort of agreement on what the process should be, what the roles of the arbitrators and the involved parties would be, and so on, and that won't occur until we've all cooled off a little bit and looked at things more objectively.  [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] 18:39, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

Ok, I hope I'm interreting the support for this correctly, so here's how I want to proceed:
#I've asked [[User:Herbythyme]] to provide oversight for this process. He's not been involved in this so far, and can act as a moderating force if I'm seen to be too pushy (though I hope I won't be seen that way).
#I'd like Panic's block to remain in effect until he makes it clear that he understands ''his part'' of why he's gotten into so many overheated disputes, and agrees not to play that part any more. This isn't a punitive block, it's intended rather to provide some space and time for this conversation to take place without new conflicts arising (or old ones continuing).
#I'd like him to agree to something like a contract, where he commits to try to avoid these conflicts in the future, and agrees to ask for help from a neutral party if a heated conflict comes about again dispite his efforts to avoid it.
Herby has some conditions he wants met too, but I'll leave that to him to lay out. For my part I just want to get back to working with Panic so that it can be resolved quickly and satisfactorily. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:10, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

You will not succeed if you keep Panic blocked and continue to treat him as some kind of rehabilitation case.  By all means discuss the problem but an indefinite block (which is what it is) is not right and against Wiki policy.  I note that you have support from a majority of users who've voted so that means you can proceed but it's unlikely to get us anywhere.  My advice to Panic would be to seek help from the stewards as I think his block is against policy and this is his only way to return to the project.

:Xania, please just give it the benefit of the doubt for now.... it might not work, but then again it might. This sort of block is not against wikimedia policies, and Panic has already gone to the stewards twice: that's not an answer (and if you had made only a bit of effort to look into the situation, you would have known this... you're assuming an awful lot of bad faith here, and you really should do some research before doing that! I'm not an immoral person, and neither is Herbythyme, and you should be ashamed of youself for suggesting otherwise). If you have a better idea and/or are willing to get involved in working towards a solution, then please put your ideas on the table and do the work. If you're not willing to invest the time and effort, then please just let those who are willing give it a try. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:20, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

:What we have above is clear community support for these actions, and I find the proposition that Panic should ask for the stewards to overturn this decision to be pretty offensive! What is the community worth if we can just ignore clear concensus? Blocking a problem user is not against wikimedia policy, but ignoring community concensus ''is against our policy''. Decisions here are made by concensus, and attempts to undermine that, or to ignore it, or to abuse it, show very poor judgement on your part. I'm pretty disappointed in this last comment, Xania. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:51, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

::No offense was intended but Panic is not a vandal and therefore does not deserve to be indefinitely blocked from editing.  I was happy to support SBJohnny's proposal but the threat of a permanent block was completely inappropriate.  He was blocked for 2 weeks for the original offense.  He appealed this block and this then went to arbitration (which was subsequently abandoned) and instead a decision was taken by one Wikibooks user that Panic should be blocked for 6 months.  No clear reasoning was given.  The result of the arbitration should have been ever unblocking, a reduced block or the original block reinstated.  Users should not be punished just because they decide to object to their punishment.

::The actions and language used against Panic recently remind me of Wikipedia and they are the sort of thing that turn people away from Wiki sites.  Everyone needs to think about their actions and realise that this is not some major crime but instead someone who has disagreements about editing a book.

::I see that activity on Panic's talk page has died down over the past week suggesting that he's taking a break.  I also intend to leave the Wikibooks project for the timebeing as the atmosphere here has turned very sour and the whole project is being ruined.

::::What you are calling the &quot;original offense&quot; was Panic's 3rd block. Panic was a repeat offender with a history of not getting along with other contributors. While Johnny did block Panic for 2 weeks, it's become commonplace now for admins to second-guess each other, and to adjust the time of blocks imposed by other admins. The idea behind this last block is to ''fix the problem'', not to ignore that it ever happened, or to be particularly mean. This block is only nominally indefinite, it is the plan of everybody involved that Panic be blocked as soon as everybody reaches agreement on the issue. Panic's talk page has been lonely because panic has stated he was taking a wikibreak for 2 weeks to &quot;cool down&quot;, which is an excellent first step for him to take (and a good indication that the block will not last much longer then 2 weeks). The only sourness that I see is from the few people who insist that community is unimportant, and that concensus is not necessary. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:24, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

::: Panic is not a vandal and should not be banned. But the community at large has clear and valid grievances, including his confrontational editorial style and agressive talk page refactoring.

I find your recent actions of bringing Herby in dangerous. I haven't commented on this issue for some time but by bringing in another user to &quot;head&quot; the process you are just prolonging this and by how I see it sending this right back to the beginning again.

=== HT's bit! ===
I have stayed out of the dispute by and large.  However I do see it as very necessary to resolve it for the community's benefit.  I agree with much of what Johnny says and it seems the community feel the same.  As there seems to be few folk active and uninvolved I am prepared to get involved BUT there are conditions.
# I see this as trying to find a way to get Panic to be part of the community on the community's terms.  I am not interested in investigating or passing judgment of Johnny's actions.  With 20:20 hindsight I have no idea what else could have been done or if anything could have been done differently.  My understanding of Johnny's final block was that it was to buy time to come up with a way of resolving the situation - [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Administrative Assistance/Archives/2007/January#Block_review_needed]] does not imply a fixed block but one that in Johnny's words needed review.
# Panic should remain blocked until we get agreement from him on how he will work with the community in future.
# I'm not keen on saying this but in view of what has happened in the past the community need to agree that my view will be final and binding.  Frankly I will not waste my time otherwise and I am not at all tolerant of knife wounds in the back.
I understand this seems rather strongly worded however the history of all this seems to suggest anything less may not resolve the situation and might lead to difficulty - '''I will help but only with full community support''' --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 17:08, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

:{{Comment}}I don't understand why we need Herby to provide over site. For better or for worse the community is already involved and already 'overseeing' this process. I will not object to reasonable moderate remedies&lt;strike&gt; that I agree with&lt;/strike&gt;. However, I will object to extreme remedies without substantial justification. This applies whether the remedies are from SB Johnny, Rob, Within Focus, Xania, Herbythyme or anyone else. My view is that someone who's back is &quot;sensitive to knife wounds&quot; is bound to have problems in this process. One of the reasons I support handing this back to SB Johnny is that he keeps getting stabbed over and over and is still coming back for more. A friend of mine used to say on occasion &quot;Don't invite a preacher to a street fight.&quot;

== [[Wikibooks:Editorial board]] ==

I've been writing up a proposal for a new &quot;editorial board&quot; here on Wikibooks. The basic gist of the proposal is that we would have a standing editorial board whose job it would be to edit and revise some of our better books, and prepare them for distribution.

Such an editorial board would not have any additional authority per se, but they would represent a concerted effort to move some of our books to the next level of &quot;goodness&quot; in an organized way. 

Some of the specifics of the proposal might definitely need to be changed, but I think the idea of such a board is sufficiently valuable that we should find a way to make it work.  All comments or suggestions on this would be highly appreciated. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 15:31, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

== Arbitration, my role, and the Wikibooks &quot;community&quot; ==

I would like to point out that I did not feel that the arbitration process I laid out necessarily needed to be agreed upon &quot;by the community&quot;.  Darklama, SB Johnny, and the rest were welcome to join in if they felt that they needed to say their piece, but I set the whole thing up mainly to deal with Panic and provide a forum for him to express his concerns.  And to let him know clearly the gravity of what he is being accused of.  This really was mainly an agreement between myself and Panic on how to shed light on what really happened, and to try and do some real fact finding.  As I also tried to point out on several occasions (unsuccessful it seems), I was also trying to insulate Panic from abuses that would normally put an administrator at a huge advantage over an ordinary registered user.

That admins do from time to time, perhaps even inadvertently, throw quite a bit more &quot;weight&quot; around is a fairly documented fact, and one of the reasons why some individuals seek adminship if only to have that status and to avoid getting pushed around.

While I admit that what I was doing did set a certain preceedence here on Wikibooks, I also said repeatedly that this was a single unique situation where apparently many previous forms of informal arbitration had simply failed.  That there was a group of people who were seething with anger about what Panic had done could also be seen, and perhaps that is what I also failed to take into account.  If the wording of the various parts of the arbitration platform were offensive or seemed in appropriate (such as &quot;plaintiff&quot; and &quot;defendant&quot;), I did ask on several occasions, both on IRC when I first set it up, on Textbook-l, and other places that it was a Wiki and that anybody was free to change the terms.  And I pleaded strongly that somebody might come and &quot;soften&quot; them down if they didn't like those terms.  Since this is something comparatively new, I just made an initial framework using the form of a traditional debate.  Even now (other than the fact that the pages have now been protected from editing) there is no reason to presume that I intended this to be the absolute final format or the way it would always be done here on Wikibooks.  I should note especially that I was not the one who protected these pages from either being edited, or being renamed.  I wasn't even sure that I wanted to put Johnny's name on the case name, but used his name merely to try and scare Panic a little bit into realizing that this was a very serious matter.

What I was trying to accomplish here was to seperate the comments made by Panic and the others who wanted to also say their piece.  As happens quite often on Wikimedia discussion pages, threads can be jumbled together where arguments go flying and it soon becomes very difficult to even follow a conversation.  By setting it up into a traditional debate format, it made trying to follow the arguments much easier, and it allowed a more elaborated response by everybody involved.  

One thing I absolutely did not want to have was a discussion page that would go back and forth endlessly with point and counter point and rebuttals going back and forth on and on ad nausium.  Particularly given the nature of the arguments, and the fact that just on [[User talk:Panic2k4]] this sort of discussion has been going on for many months, I didn't see that starting another page using that format would necessarily even have an end at all.  I guess I succeeded on this point beyond my wildest dreams because it soon became very apparent when the discussion finally ended.

I should note that Panic did not question the &quot;hiatus&quot; that I had taken which was apparently part of the whole misunderstanding here.  What I was trying to do was to write an opinion of fact to try and determine what exactly Panic had done that had necessarily been against Wikibooks policy.  With all of the personal attacks going on (on both sides!) and the absolutely huge number of edits that were involved, it was going to take more than a quick glance and write a reply in a few quick minutes.

I didn't expect the viseral attacks that were being made against me personally about even trying to set up an arbitration in this particular format.  That there were people who didn't like the format and even the idea of having a formal abritration at all here on Wikibooks was quite apparent.  I pleaded patience, and got instead heated words and warnings on my user talk page urging me to abandon the whole process.

I should also note that I had hoped that any sort of decision on what sort of action to take should have been a consensual decision, and a process that would have also included Panic and those who were sympathetic to his side of the issues as well.  It certainly would not have been a unilateral decision that was made seemingly in the dark by those who were completely unsympathetic to Panic.  It is very unfortunate that this portion of the arbitration process I laid out was never even tried, or given the opportunity to succeed.

Two basic fundimental editing/admin philosophies that I do have worked against me here as well:  I will not engage in an edit war with anybody.  If you revert content that I have added to a module/article/entry, I will not try to put it back.  But you should be prepared to hear from me on the talk page where I will try as hard as I can to defend why I added the content and force the person who made the revert to defend exactly why they removed my content.

I will also not engage in wheel warring at all, ever.  While there are a few times in the logs that might appear as wheel warring on the part of my account, I would suggest that you look quite a bit deeper and try to put them into context.  As for my unblocking of Panic, I did that when I had achieved a general agreement from the user who put the block on there in the first place.  And while SB Johnny wasn't too happy with the format of the arbitration, he was willing to give it a go and did concent to allowing Panic to be unblocked.  Perhaps I should have insisted that he do the unblocking instead, and that may have been a mistake on my part to give the appearance of wheel warring.  That was not my intention, ever.

At this point, I don't know what to do here at all.  SB Johnny has decided that he wants to restart the arbitration along a completely different set of lines, and is trying to gain concensus, somehow, for a set of rules to allow Panic back into the Wikibooks community.  There are several others including some very notable administrators who don't want me to go back to the arbitration process I started and try to finish the thing.

Fine.  If that is the general opinion of the general Wikibooks community, I can live with that.  Unfortunately, for what I felt could have been something resolved in the next couple of weeks at most, I feel is going to be a persistant and long running problem on Wikibooks, and this situation unfortunately is quickly moving to the point that it will merely be unresolvable.

I also have been pushed to become a staunch defender of Panic instead of being a neutral abitrator, mainly because I think he is being bullied.  I'm not trying to use that word in a derrogotory fashion against any particular user here, but I do feel that the actions of several individuals are now conspiring to push Panic completely out of Wikibooks entirely with no chance for any redemption.  I also feel that allowing this sort of behavior here or anywhere is something that should always be fought against.  Panic is not the first nor will he be the last &quot;problem user&quot; that will pop up here on Wikibooks, and there has been far too much blood letting here on Wikibooks anyway that has pushed out major sections of our community.

User blocks are to be used to protect the community from blatant vandals who deliberately try to change content and put obscene pictures, words, or other completely unrelated content into prominent pages of the Wiki.  This is a very powerful tool, which is one of the reasons why we are generally very careful about who we even allow the opportunity to have the tool as an option.  Attempting to silence a &quot;problem user&quot; is an easy way out of what really is a social problem, and something that requires education and leadership.

Besides, in spite of other new tools such as the &quot;checkuser&quot; privileges and other things to combat sock puppetry, I don't see a legitimate way to completely remove somebody from Wikibooks.  Blocking an account is only going to get somebody angry and pissed off, perhaps to the point that they are willing to engage in blatant vandalism with the added advantage that they know some of the soft spots of our Wiki here.  This is not something we need in general.  Even if you link IP addresses with user blocks, you still aren't going to be able to stop somebody determined to cause real harm, if that is what you are trying to prevent.  I know I can access the internet through at least six completely different IP address ranges by completely different ISPs.  It just turns into a fun game to try and piss off the admins instead, and try to find new ways to cause aggrivation.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 23:31, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

:I don't understand why this is on the Staff Lounge. I'd like it moved since I find it essentially entirely about someone's personal opinion and quite soapbox-like. This should be on your user page. If the community would like your stance on the issue or your rationalizations about how you were involved in this, they can inquire on an individual level. Having this on our most prominent Wikibooks page is inappropriate. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 01:50, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

::I disagree. This comment is certainly more verbose then the average staff-lounge post, and people do already complain about the length of the staff lounge as it is. However, considering recent events, the negative attitudes that have consumed many of us, and the unfortunate propensity we have all shown as a community to assume bad faith when the going gets tough (even if we do assume good faith when everything is perfectly fine), such a clam and collected explanation of one part of the events is likely the catalyst that we need to begin the healing process. I never doubted Rob's intentions, although I will certainly admit my (rabid) disagreement with the whole process from the beginning. I also would like to post a public apology to Rob, while I have time on this little soapbox because some of my comments to him, while not intentionally so, did come across as overly hostile and even threatening. It was certainly not my intention to be viewed like that, and perhaps I took for granted that everybody here should go to great lengths to assume good faith in all my posts. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:04, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

:::Staff Lounge is not meant for personal essays but community discussion. If someone wants to justify their actions then they can do so in a more private place. We're not supposed to have soapboxes anywhere in Wikibooks although we usually don't mind on User pages. This can be done somewhere else, even on the Arbitration talk page if we have to. Besides being plainly against our policies here, this can be a very argumentative issue (as in I and others could criticize several statements in this &quot;essay&quot;) and should not be brought up on a page totally meant for community discussion. Opinions like this could be argued for some time, something I don't want to see any more of since this talks largely of past issues. The community does not need sob stories and apologies; you can do that personally. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 03:45, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

::::I think a good bit of what happened on Tuesday had to do with conflicting personalities and misunderstandings of intent, and while I agree that soapboxing is in general not a good idea, those conflicting personalities and misunderstandings of intent ''did'' become a community issue, and so some discussion along these lines is perhaps appropriate in this particular situation. The lack of more public discussion before a number of actions (including Robert's, Xania's, and my own) is pretty much what got us here in the first place, so &quot;better late than never&quot; might also apply. The one main advantage I can see to having a &quot;standing arbitration commitee&quot; would be to keep this sort of thing off the Staff Lounge altogether, but since we don't have one (and perhaps shouldn't have one), here seems a good place to discuss it. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:52, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

:::::Maybe Staff Lounge isn't the best place for this kind of discussion but given recent events I think this can be forgiven.  I would like to also say that although I have opposed SBJohnny's recent proposal that shouldn't stop the rest of the community from voting (which now seems to have stalled).  The decision shouldn't need to be unanimous and I will support SBJohnny if he gets a sizeable number of favourable votes (which appears to be the case).  Also does anyone know of a quick way to sign posts because Italian keyboards don't have the tilde key!

::::::While Staff Lounge tends to be more a a short question/response (aka more like the help desk) or a short announcement, it is also one of the few places that tends to have the full attention of Wikibooks users.  I don't know where else to realistically post this.  Textbook-l doesn't get nearly the same coverage either, and perhaps it should have been there.  Posting something like this on my user talk page (while many people to for some reason or another read that nearly as a public forum) wouldn't simply show the hows and whys of what happened.  And this, for whatever reason, seems to have become such a huge issue that it has nearly shut down the rest of Wikibooks altogether.  There are much bigger issues here than trying to smooth down the feathers of a few users, and this is something that clearly got way out of hand.  I also tend to be rather wordy (I know that!), but there was some huge misunderstanding in part because some people didn't get all of the fine details when instead they jumped to conclusions... including myself.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 00:16, 11 February 2007 (UTC)
:For all intents and purposes, the textbook-l is basically a dead medium. Efforts in the past to advertise the mailing list (including posts on the staff lounge, and a note in the newsletter) were failures. While it does get used on occasion, I dont think it's reasonable to expect any messages to be posted to the mailing list, or to expect that a message so posted will be read by anybody. ---[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:37, 12 February 2007 (UTC)

:::I certainly will discuss things as they come to my inbox, but if you are starting a discussion and it is your intent for a large number of people to read/respond, then textbook-l is not the place to do it. I could probably count on two hands the number of active wikibookians that make use of that list.

== My thoughts on Arbitration Committee proposal ==

It's a good idea, but for now we don't need it, maybe in the future.
A mediation group would be a good idea, though, I'd be able to help out with that. Does anyone else agree?? --[[User:SunStar Net|SunStar Net]] 23:45, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

:There has been a dispute that has upset several of the best people in Wikibooks (on both sides of the dispute).  A formal procedure would allow everyone involved in a dispute to know where they stand. The previous dispute was worse than it might have been because there was no formal procedure, people fell out with each other when any procedures were operated and started warring over procedure as much as the original dispute.  So, I dont agree, we need an arbitration procedure now, before the next dispute. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 12:13, 17 February 2007 (UTC)

::Not being involved in the dispute, I'm a bit blind to that action, but I think that as soon as a formal procedure is in place, people will start to use it, which is a bad thing. In our 4&amp;frac12; years, we've had only a handful of disputes that would be considered serious. All other times, we've been able to work through the issues and come to a consensus. If we establish a formal tribunal, some of the worktogetherness will be lost. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 23:54, 17 February 2007 (UTC)

:::What actually happened is that the admins who were trying to deal with the dispute started on each other because there was no procedure. This is crazy and has led to the demoralisation of some excellent Wikibookians.  If we avoid this issue of creating proper procedures we will find that whenever a fierce dispute occurs it will damage the whole project again. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 10:45, 18 February 2007 (UTC)

::::So many good points here, it's unfortunate that we are in our current position. [[User:Gentgeen]] is right, that people will likely turn to a formal arbitration committee immediately, rather then working through the full [[Wikibooks:Dispute resolution]] proceedure. Who will want to take the time to get community concensus when an arbitration hearing will do the work immediately? On the other hand, [[User:RobinH]] is right that without a formal proceedure, everybody will have their own opinions on how to handle the &quot;serious&quot; issues, and those differing opinions will lead to new disputes between people trying to solve the old disputes. I think, unfortunately, that formal arbitration is a necessary evil, and the effects of over-use of the system are insignificant compared to the problems it will solve. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:48, 19 February 2007 (UTC)

:::::A stipulation for arbitration should be that everything in dispute resolution has been tried and failed to produce a resolution. Arbitration is not generally over-used on our sister projects, and I do not believe it would be over-used here either. I think Wikinews has had an arbitration process in place for about a year and only ever used it twice. -- [[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:16, 19 February 2007 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">This tutorial is a simple, but effective way to make a realistic fire.

Make a new image with dimensions 1000x500

Draw a gradient like so (with white at the bottom and black at the top):

[[Image:Layer1firetut.png]]

Make a new layer.

Double-click Layer 2 to edit its properties

Set the Blending Mode to 'Overlay', then hit OK.

[[Image:Firetutforpdnscreenshot1.png]]

Go to the 'Effects' menu under 'Render' and choose 'Clouds'. Change the blending mode to 'Difference', then hit OK.

[[Image:Anotherscreenshotforthepdnfiretut.png]]

Push CTRL+F to repeat the effect. Do this about a dozen times.

On the 'Image' menu, choose 'Flatten'. This will give you a single layer with some nice black-and-white clouds.

On the 'Adjustments' menu, choose 'Curves...'.

Choose 'RGB' under 'Transfer map', then uncheck the 'Red' and 'Green' checkboxes so you're only modifying the blue channel, add a control point as shown below. Do the same for the green channel so you have the curves shown below.

[[Image:Yetanotherscreenshotforthefiretut.png]]

Viola!

==Other things to try==
*Use different shapes for the Layer 1 Gradient. Round gradients make neat looking explosions
*Tweak with the Curves, the general shape of them should be preserved to keep good saturation, but the channels don't need to go in the above order. *Try Green, Red, Blue (instead of Red, Green, Blue) for a copper flame (copper burns green).
*Play with the 'scale' setting of Clouds for finer or Coarser clouds
*Play with the Roughness setting for clouds for softer or sharper fire
*Just try things out, you never know what you'll get.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Low Chicago is a home-game variant of Seven Card Stud. Like High Chicago it is a split-pot game with 1/2 of the pot being awarded based on a concealed Spade, in this case to the player who's hand contains the lowest Spade. The lowest Spade is subject to interpretation however, and it should be confirmed prior to dealing if the Ace or Deuce of Spades is the lowest card.

{{Electric Circuits}} 

This Wikibook is about analogue electronics. It will begin by examining the bipolar junction transistor (BJT) and the field effect transistor (FET). The two classes of device are used in the vast majority of electronic devices, and form a stepping stone to more complex circuits. We will begin by examining the diode and operational amplifier, look at the BJT and FET as simple amplifiers and switches, and we will move on to more complex circuits after that.

==Prerequisites==
This book relies heavily on results shown in the [[Semiconductors]] Wikibook - we will not spend much time in this book re-deriving characteristic equations of the devices. A detailed knowledge of semiconductor physics is not required, and basic results will be derived here. A knowledge of basic circuit theory is essential, and can be found in [[Circuit Theory]].

The [[Circuit Idea]] book provides many alternative methods of viewing the results found in this book in an intuitive, rather than formal, context.

This page quickly recapitulates the concepts of a ''pn'' junction, and its basic behaviour. For a more detailed analysis, see the [[Semiconductors]] Wikibook and the [[Materials in Electronics]] Wikibook.

==Electron States and Doping==

Electrons in a solid lattice must exist in certain '''electron states'''. Due to interaction between the atoms in the lattice, these states are grouped into '''energy bands''', separated by '''energy gaps''', in which no states exist. Therefore electrons cannot exist in these energy gaps.

[[image:Semiconductor Bands 0K.svg|right|frame|Semiconductor at absolute zero (0K) has no electrons in the conduction band and no holes in the valence band.]]
In a semiconductor, at absolute zero (0K) bands up to and including the '''valence band''' are completely full of electrons. The '''conduction band''' - the next band above the energy gap above the valence band (called the '''band gap''')- is completely devoid of electrons. The same goes for all bands higher than the conduction band.

[[image:Semiconductor Bands Hot.svg|right|frame|Thermal energy causes electrons to jump to the conduction band from the valence band, leaving positive charges called holes behind.]]
Electrons in bands which are either completely full or completely empty cannot contribute towards a current, so a semiconductor at 0K is a perfect insulator. At higher temperatures, thermal energy causes some electrons to jump the band gap and exist in the conduction band. These electrons, along with the '''holes''' that were left when the electron departed the conduction band can now contribute to carrying a current. As the temperature rises, more and more electrons can make this jump and the semiconductor becomes more conductive.

Semiconductors can have impurities added to introduce more electrons or holes to make ''p''-type or ''n''-type semiconductors. These conduct predominantly with one kind of carrier:

{|align=&quot;center&quot;
|'''n-Type Material'''
|'''p-Type Material'''
|-
|[[Image:N-Type Semiconductor Bands.svg|centre|frame|Conduction predominantly by electrons in conduction band]]
|[[Image:P-Type Semiconductor Bands.svg|centre|frame|Conduction predominantly by holes in valence band]]
|}

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;

==The ''pn'' Junction==

When a ''p''-type semiconductor is joined to an ''n''-type semiconductor, the interface between the two is called a ''pn'' junction.

Because the electron concentration in the ''n''-type material is much higher than in the ''p''-type material, electrons will tend to '''diffuse''' across the junction into the ''p''-type material. Likewise, holes will tend to diffuse from the ''p''-type to the ''n''-type material.

Since the materials had, on their own, no net charge, this diffusion sets up a charge imbalance. The ''n''-type material, which has lost electrons and gained holes now has a net positive charge, and the ''p''-type material, which has lost holes and gained electrons, has a net negative charge. This creates a potential difference between the two types of material, which will act ''against'' the diffusion of holes and electrons, pulling them back to where they started. This opposing flow of charge under a potential difference is called '''drift'''.

[[image:pn Junction Diffusion and Drift.svg|centre]]


At equilibrium, these two effects will balance out, and no net current will flow:

*Hole diffusion from ''p''-type to ''n''-type equals hole drift from ''n''-type to ''p''-type
*Electron diffusion from ''n''-type to ''p''-type equals electron drift from ''p''-type to ''n''-type

A region near the junction will have no charge carriers present, as they have recombined with their counterparts from the other type of material. This area is called the '''depletion zone''', or sometime the '''space-charge region'''. Charged particles still exist here, but they are the nuclei of the atoms in the lattice, and cannot move. 

At equilibrium, a potential still exists between the two materials and it is referred to as the '''built-in voltage''' or '''potential barrier'''. An electric field, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}_0&lt;/math&gt; is set up across the depletion zone by the presence of the unbalanced charges left in the depletion zone by the departure of the charge carriers. In the depletion zone's ''n''-type material side, the atoms left have a net positive charge (they are missing one electron), and on the ''p''-type side, they have a net negative charge, due to the extra electron acquired.

The electric field therefore is directed from the ''n''-type material to the ''p''-type material:

[[image:Un-Biased pn Junction Bands.svg|centre]]

As shown in this figure, the remaining electrons in the ''n''-type material have to overcome the potential barrier (and move against the electric field) in order to move across the junction (from right to left), and similarly, the holes need to overcome it to move from left to right. Remember that there are ''very few'' free holes in the ''n''-type material, and ''very few'' electrons in the ''p''-type material, so no current can possibly flow this way.

In order to overcome the potential barrier, an external potential can be applied across the junction.

==Biased ''pn'' Junctions==

The first thing to note when considering the action of an external electric field is that the semiconductor that is outside the depletion region is highly conductive comapared to the depletion region. This means that any potential difference applied to the device will be concentrated across the depletion region, and will not manifest itself as an electric field in the un-depleted semiconductor.

===Forward Biased Junction===

Imagine connecting the ''pn'' junction to a voltage source so that the ''n''-type material is at a lower potential than the ''p''-type. The electric field from the external potential difference, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}_{ext}&lt;/math&gt;, acts against the internal electric field, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}_0&lt;/math&gt;. This gives a total electric field of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}_0-\mathcal{E}_{ext}&lt;/math&gt;:

[[image:Forward-Biased pn Junction.svg|centre]]

This means that the electric field opposing the flow of charge carriers is also reduced, and so some carriers will diffuse across. The reduced electric field will bring the junction to equilibrium again, but the depletion zone will be shorter. The band diagram for this situation is shown below:

[[image:Forward-Biased pn Junction Bands.svg|centre]]

The reduced potential barrier also means the some electrons and holes with thermal energy can &quot;jump&quot; across the depletion zone, whereupon they will be swept out of the semiconductor by the applied voltage. If the external potential is greater than the internal potential, the barrier is reversed, and electrons and holes can flow virtually unimpeded through the junction - once the barrier voltage is exceeded, a very large current can flow.

===Reverse-Biased ''pn'' Junction===

Now, consider connecting the junction so the ''n''-type material is at a higher potential than the ''p''-type material. The electric field induced by the external potential will reinforce the internal potential and make it &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}_0+\mathcal{E}_{ext}&lt;/math&gt;:

[[image:Reverse-Biased pn Junction.svg|centre]]

This will force more charge carriers out of the area around the junction, making the depletion zone larger. The increased potential barrier means that charge carriers need more energy to jump the depletion zone, and the external field is acting against them anyway:

[[image:Reverse-Biased pn Junction Bands.svg|centre]]

This means that no current due to majority carriers (electrons in the ''n''-type and holes in the ''p''-type) will flow across the junction.

The only current that can possibly flow in this situation is a tiny '''leakage current''', composed of minority carriers (holes in the ''n''-type material and electrons in the ''p''-type). As these are very sparse, this current is very small (usually only a few nanoamps).

==''IV'' Characteristics of a ''pn'' Junction==

Careful consideration of the above effects leads, as demonstrated in [[Semiconductors]], to the following equation describing the ''pn'' junction:

{{eqn|Ebers-Moll Equation}}
::&lt;math&gt;I = I_S \left( {\exp \left( {{V \over {V_T }}} \right) - 1} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

where
*''I&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the reverse saturation current (caused by thermal activity - generally on the order of 20nA for &quot;normal&quot; voltages)
*''V&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the thermal voltage (about 25mV at room temperature)
*''V'' is the applied voltage
*''I'' is the current across the junction

This is called the &quot;Ebers-Moll&quot; model of a ''pn'' junction.

A diode following this model exactly has very extreme characteristics - the current becomes huge after the potential barrier is exceeded, and is tiny in reverse bias. The plot below exaggerates the reverse current and lessens the growth of the forward current for clarity.

[[image:pn Junction IV Characteristic.svg|centre]]

When V is not very close to 0, we can approximate, to a good degree of accuracy, the current as follow:

For forward bias,

::&lt;math&gt;I \approx I_S \exp \left( {{V \over {V_T }}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

For reverse bias,

::&lt;math&gt;I \approx -I_S&lt;/math&gt;

Generally, the value of ''V&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' is taken to be about 0.7V. This is when the junction begins to provide extremely little resistance to the current flowing. Even though current flows before this value, it is small (much smaller than shown on the diagram).

__TOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

==Introduction==
Another good point of LaTeX is that you can easily reference almost anything that is numbered (sections, figures, formulas), and LaTeX will take care of numbering, updating it whenever necessary. The commands to be used do not depend on what you are referencing, and they are:
;&lt;code&gt;\label{''marker''}&lt;/code&gt;
:you give the object you want to reference a ''marker'', you can see it like a name.
;&lt;code&gt;\ref{''marker''}&lt;/code&gt;
:you can reference the object you have ''marked'' before. This prints the number that was assigned to the object.
;&lt;code&gt;\pageref{''marker''}&lt;/code&gt;
:It will print the number of the page where the object is.

LaTeX will calculate the right numbering for the objects in the document; the ''marker'' you have used to label the object will not be shown anywhere in the document. Then LaTeX will replace the string &quot;&lt;code&gt;\ref{''marker''}&lt;/code&gt;&quot; with the right number that was assigned to the object. If you reference a ''marker'' that does not exist, the compilation of the document will be successful but LaTeX will return a warning:
 LaTeX Warning: There were undefined references.
and it will replace &quot;&lt;code&gt;\ref{''unknown-marker''}&lt;/code&gt;&quot; with &quot;??&quot; (so it will be easy to find in the document).

As you may have noticed reading how it works, it is a two-step process: first the compiler has to store the labels with the right number to be used for referencing, then it has to replace the &lt;code&gt;\ref&lt;/code&gt; with the right number. That is why, when you use references, you have to compile your document twice to see the proper output. If you compile it only once, LaTeX will use the older information it collected in previous compilations (that might be outdated), but the compiler will inform you printing on the screen at the end of the compilation:
:&lt;tt&gt;LaTeX Warning: Label(s) may have changed. Rerun to get cross-references right.&lt;/tt&gt;
Using the command &lt;code&gt;\pageref{}&lt;/code&gt; you can help the reader to find the referenced object by providing also the page number where it can be found. You could write something like:
&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
See figure~\ref{fig:test} on page~\pageref{fig:test}.
&lt;/source&gt;

Since you can use exactly the same commands to reference almost anything, you might get a bit confused after you have introduced a lot of references. It is common practice among LaTeX users to add a few letters to the label to describe ''what'' you are referencing. Some packages, such as &lt;code&gt;fancyref&lt;/code&gt;, rely on this meta information. Here is an example:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|'''&lt;tt&gt;chap:&lt;/tt&gt;'''
|chapter
|-
|'''&lt;tt&gt;sec:&lt;/tt&gt;'''
|section
|-
|'''&lt;tt&gt;subsec:&lt;/tt&gt;'''
|subsection
|-
|'''&lt;tt&gt;fig:&lt;/tt&gt;'''
|figure
|-
|'''&lt;tt&gt;tab:&lt;/tt&gt;'''
|table
|-
|'''&lt;tt&gt;eq:&lt;/tt&gt;'''
|equation
|-
|'''&lt;tt&gt;lst:&lt;/tt&gt;'''
|code listing
|-
|'''&lt;tt&gt;itm:&lt;/tt&gt;'''
|enumerated list item
|-
|'''&lt;tt&gt;app:&lt;/tt&gt;'''
|appendix subsection
|-
|}

Following this convention, the label of a figure will look like &lt;code&gt;\label{fig:''my_figure''}&lt;/code&gt;, etc. You are not obligated to use these prefixes. You can use any string as argument of &lt;code&gt;\label{...}&lt;/code&gt;, but these prefixes become increasingly useful as your document grows in size.

Another suggestion: try to avoid using numbers within labels. You are better off describing ''what'' the object is about. This way, if you change the order of the objects, you will not have to rename all your labels and their references.

If you want to be able to see the markers you are using in the output document as well, you can use the &lt;code&gt;showkeys&lt;/code&gt; package; this can be very useful while developing your document. For more information see the [[LaTeX/Packages|Packages]] section.

==Examples==

Here are some practical examples, but you will notice that they are all the same because they all use the same commands.

===Sections===

&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\section{Greetings}
\label{sec:greetings}

Hello!

\section{Referencing}

I greeted in section~\ref{sec:greetings}.
&lt;/source&gt;

[[Image:Latex example referencing section.png|150px]]

You could place the label anywhere in the section; however, in order to avoid confusion, it is better to place it immediately after the beginning of the section. Note how the marker starts with ''sec:'', as suggested before. The label is then referenced in a different section. The tilde (~) indicates a [[w:non-breaking space|non-breaking space]].

===Pictures===

You can reference a picture by inserting it in the &lt;tt&gt;figure&lt;/tt&gt; floating environment.

&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\begin{figure}
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{gull}
  \caption{Close-up of a gull}
  \label{fig:gull}
\end{figure}
Figure~\ref{fig:gull} shows a photograph of a gull.
&lt;/source&gt;

[[Image:Latex example figure referencing.png|center|300px]]

When a label is declared within a float environment, the &lt;code&gt;\ref{...}&lt;/code&gt; will return the respective fig/table number, but it must occur '''after''' the caption. When declared outside, it will give the section number. To be completely safe, the label for any picture or table can go within the &lt;code&gt;\caption{}&lt;/code&gt; command, as in
&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\caption{Close-up of a gull\label{fig:gull}}
&lt;/source&gt;

See the [[LaTeX/Floats, Figures and Captions|Floats, Figures and Captions]] section for more about the &lt;code&gt;figure&lt;/code&gt; and related environments.

==== Fixing wrong labels ====

The command &lt;code&gt;\label&lt;/code&gt; must appear after (or inside) &lt;code&gt;\caption&lt;/code&gt;. Otherwise, it will pick up the current section or list number instead of what you intended.

&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\begin{figure}

&lt;/source&gt;

====Issues with links to tables and figures handled by [[LaTeX/Packages/Hyperref|hyperref]]====

In case you use the package &lt;code&gt;hyperref&lt;/code&gt; to create a PDF, the links to tables or figures will point to the caption of the table or figure, which is always below the table or figure itself&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/hyperref/README&lt;/ref&gt;. Therefore the table or figure will not be visible, if it is above the pointer and one has to scroll up in order to see it. If you want the link point to the top of the image you can give the option &lt;code&gt;hypcap&lt;/code&gt; to the &lt;code&gt;caption&lt;/code&gt; package:
&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\usepackage[hypcap]{caption}
&lt;/source&gt;

===Formulae===

Here is an example showing how to reference formulae:

&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\begin{equation} \label{eq:solve}
x^2 - 5 x + 6 = 0
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
x_1 = \frac{5 + \sqrt{25 - 4 \times 6}}{2} = 3
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
x_2 = \frac{5 - \sqrt{25 - 4 \times 6}}{2} = 2
\end{equation}

and so we have solved equation ~\ref{eq:solve}
&lt;/source&gt;

[[Image:Latex example math referencing.png|350px]]

As you can see, the label is placed soon after the beginning of the math mode. In order to reference a formula, you have to use an environment that adds numbers. Most of the times you will be using the &lt;code&gt;equation&lt;/code&gt; environment; that is the best choice for one-line formulae, whether you are using &lt;code&gt;amsmath&lt;/code&gt; or not. Note also the ''eq:'' prefix in the label.

====&lt;tt&gt;eqref&lt;/tt&gt;====

The &lt;code&gt;amsmath&lt;/code&gt; package adds a new command for referencing formulae; it is &lt;code&gt;\eqref{}&lt;/code&gt;. It works exactly like &lt;code&gt;\ref{}&lt;/code&gt;, but it adds parentheses so that, instead of printing a plain number as ''5'', it will print ''(5)''. This can be useful to help the reader distinguish between formulae and other things, without the need to repeat the word &quot;formula&quot; before any reference. Its output can be changed as desired; for more information see the &lt;code&gt;amsmath&lt;/code&gt; documentation.

====&lt;tt&gt;tag&lt;/tt&gt;====

The &lt;code&gt;\tag{eqnno}&lt;/code&gt; command is used to manually set equation numbers where ''eqnno'' is the arbitrary text string you want to appear in the document.  It is normally better to use labels, but sometimes hard-coded equation numbers might offer a useful work-around.

====&lt;tt&gt;numberwithin&lt;/tt&gt;====
The &lt;code&gt;amsmath&lt;/code&gt; package adds the &lt;code&gt;\numberwithin{countera}{counterb}&lt;/code&gt; command which replaces the simple &lt;code&gt;countera&lt;/code&gt; by a more sophisticated
&lt;code&gt;counterb.countera&lt;/code&gt;.  For example &lt;code&gt;\numberwithin{equation}{section}&lt;/code&gt; in the preamble will prepend the section number to all equation numbers.

====&lt;tt&gt;cases&lt;/tt&gt;====
The &lt;code&gt;cases&lt;/code&gt; package adds the &lt;code&gt;\numcases&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;\subnumcases&lt;/code&gt; commands, which produce multi-case equations with a separate equation number and a separate equation number plus a letter, respectively, for each case.

==The &lt;tt&gt;varioref&lt;/tt&gt; package==

The &lt;code&gt;varioref&lt;/code&gt; package introduces a new command called &lt;code&gt;\vref{}&lt;/code&gt;. This command is used exactly like the basic &lt;code&gt;\ref&lt;/code&gt;, but it has a different output according to the context. If the object to be referenced is in the same page, it works just like &lt;code&gt;\ref&lt;/code&gt;; if the object is far away it will print something like &quot;5 on page 25&quot;, i.e. it adds the page number automatically. If the object is close, it can use more refined sentences like &quot;on the next page&quot; or &quot;on the facing page&quot; automatically, according to the context and the document class.

This command has to be used very carefully. It outputs more than one word, so it may happen its output falls on two different pages. In this case, the algorithm can get confused and cause a loop. Let's make an example. You label an object on page 23 and the &lt;code&gt;\vref&lt;/code&gt; output happens to stay between page 23 and 24. If it were on page 23, it would print like the basic &lt;code&gt;ref&lt;/code&gt;, if it were on page 24, it would print &quot;on the previous page&quot;, but it is on both, and this may cause some strange errors at compiling time that are very hard to be fixed. You could think that this happens very rarely; unfortunately, if you write a long document it is not uncommon to have hundreds of references, so situations like these are likely to happen. One way to avoid problems during development is to use the standard &lt;code&gt;ref&lt;/code&gt; all the time, and convert it to &lt;code&gt;vref&lt;/code&gt; when the document is close to its final version, and then making adjustments to fix possible problems.

== The &lt;tt&gt;hyperref&lt;/tt&gt; package ==

=== &lt;tt&gt;autoref&lt;/tt&gt; ===

The &lt;code&gt;[[LaTeX/Packages/Hyperref|hyperref]]&lt;/code&gt; package introduces another useful command; &lt;code&gt;\autoref{}&lt;/code&gt;. This command creates a reference with additional text corresponding to the target's type, all of which will be a hyperlink.  For example, the command &lt;code&gt;\autoref{sec:intro}&lt;/code&gt; would create a hyperlink to the &lt;code&gt;\label{sec:intro}&lt;/code&gt; command, wherever it is. Assuming that this label is pointing to a section, the hyperlink would contain the text &quot;section 3.4&quot;, or similar (the full list of default names can be found [http://www.tug.org/applications/hyperref/manual.html#TBL-24 here]). Note that, while there's an &lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;\autoref*&lt;/source&gt; command that produces an unlinked prefix (useful if the label is on the same page as the reference), no alternative &lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;\Autoref&lt;/source&gt; command is defined to produce capitalized versions (useful, for instance, when starting sentences); but since the capitalization of autoref names was chosen by the package author, you can customize the prefixed text by redefining &lt;code&gt;\''type''autorefname&lt;/code&gt; to the prefix you want, as in:
&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\def\sectionautorefname{Section}
&lt;/source&gt;
This renaming trick can, of course, be used for other purposes as well.

* If you would like a hyperlink reference, but do not want the predefined text that &lt;code&gt;\autoref{}&lt;/code&gt; provides, you can do this with a command such as &lt;code&gt;\hyperref[sec:intro]{Appendix~\ref*{sec:intro}}&lt;/code&gt;. Note that you can disable the creation of hyperlinks in &lt;code&gt;hyperref&lt;/code&gt;, and just use these commands for automatic text.

* Keep in mind that the \label '''must''' be placed inside an environment with a counter, such as a table or a figure. Otherwise, not only the number will refer to the current section, as mentioned [[#Fixing wrong labels|above]], but the name will refer to the previous environment with a counter. For example, if you put a label after closing a figure, the label will still say &quot;figure n&quot;, on which n is the current section number.

=== &lt;tt&gt;nameref&lt;/tt&gt; ===

The &lt;code&gt;hyperref&lt;/code&gt; package also automatically includes the &lt;code&gt;nameref&lt;/code&gt; package, and a similarly named command.  It is similar to &lt;code&gt;\autoref{}&lt;/code&gt;, but inserts text corresponding to the section name, for example.

Input:
&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\section{MyFirstSection} \label{sec:marker}
\section{MySecondSection}
In section~\nameref{sec:marker} we defined...
&lt;/source&gt;

Output:

In section MyFirstSection we defined...

=== Anchor manual positioning ===

When you define a &lt;code&gt;\label&lt;/code&gt; outside a figure, a table, or other floating objects, the label points to the current section. In some cases, this behavior is
not what you'd like and you'd prefer the generated link to point to the line where the &lt;code&gt;\label&lt;/code&gt; is defined. This can be achieved with the command
&lt;code&gt;\phantomsection&lt;/code&gt; as in this example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
%The link location will be placed on the line below.
\phantomsection
\label{the_label}
&lt;/source&gt;

== The &lt;tt&gt;cleveref&lt;/tt&gt; package ==

The &lt;code&gt;cleveref&lt;/code&gt; package introduces the new command &lt;code&gt;\cref{}&lt;/code&gt; which includes the type of referenced object like &lt;code&gt;\autoref{}&lt;/code&gt; does. The alternate &lt;code&gt;\labelcref{}&lt;/code&gt; command works more like standard &lt;code&gt;\ref{}&lt;/code&gt;. References to pages are handled by the &lt;code&gt;\cpageref{}&lt;/code&gt; command.

The &lt;code&gt;\crefrange{}{}&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;\cpagerefrange{}&lt;/code&gt; commands expect a start and end label in either order and provide a natural language (&lt;code&gt;babel&lt;/code&gt; enabled) range. If labels are enumerated as a comma-separated list with the usual &lt;code&gt;\cref{}&lt;/code&gt; command, it will sort them and group into ranges automatically.

The format can be specified in the preamble.

Millions of dollars are spent every year on textbooks by educational institutions at the primary and secondary level, money perhaps better spent elsewhere. Wikibooks could, in concept at least, help to relieve that burden. However, the creation of classroom-usable texts is complex, involving adherence to standards, writing with language and syntax appropriate to the age of children in question, and the inclusion with the text of instructional activities aimed at the explicit teaching of vocabulary and reading strategies. The vast majority of Wikibooks texts are written in such a way as to only be useful at a collegiate level of instruction, and most would fail any textbook approval process in their current state. There is a need for a WikiProject to coordinate efforts to meet the goal of classroom usable texts.

==Goal==

This WikiProject takes as its goal the creation of a series of texts that can replace or improve upon traditional corporate-produced instructional textbooks for primary and secondary schools.

==How to Write Usable Classroom Texts==

Educators speak of the importance of creating kid-friendly text for their students. In practice, this is very difficult. In any given classroom, you may have students reading at a very broad range of reading levels. Most teachers, however, use a basic text pegged to the average assumed reading level of students they teach.

For a book to be kid-friendly at a specific reading level, its grammar, vocabulary, syntax, and the difficulty of ideas contained within it need to be accessible for students with an approximate level of skill in reading comprehension. Educators worldwide use many different systems to measure the level of skill required to read and understand a particular text. In the United States, one of the most common systems is called the lexile system. An external link with more explanation is located [http://www.lexile.com/EntrancePageFlash.html?1|here].

More information about writing usable classroom texts will arrive soon. Or you can write it yourself. Be bold in your editing.

==Links to Standards on Specific Topics==

In the United States, the California state content standards become the basis for most textbooks, simply because of the size of the California market.

Hello, Welcome to Wikibooks!

I've seen your efforts on this project, and they are commendable! This is a great idea, and something that we definately need to get to work on. I would like to help out with this project, but I dont quite have the time right now to list myself as a &quot;member&quot;. If you have any questions at all, don't hesitate to ask me. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 01:44, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</text>

==What does it look like?==
[[Image:Fugleedderkop_%28Acanthoscurria_geniculata%29.jpg|thumb|right|300px|White Knee Tarantula in its web.]] 
These fierce-looking spiders belong to the Family ''Theraphosidae''. They are the largest spiders in the world, with about 750 species worldwide. Tarantulas have been on earth for more than 150 million years. 

Most tarantulas are black or brown. Those of North America are usually brown. In other parts of the world, they are more colorful with blue, orange, or yellow markings. The Indian ornamental tarantula has yellow fangs. Its legs are grey-and-black striped on top and yellow-and-black striped underneath. The Pink-toed Tarantula has a dark grey body with pink at the ends of the legs. The Mexican Red-Knee Tarantula has patches of orange and red on its legs. The Steely-Blue Tarantula is an iridescent purple.

Some tarantulas are only 1 inch long. Others are as long as 4 inches. In North America, they reach about 3 inches. Leg span varies from 3 to 12 inches. Each leg has 2 claws at the tip. Arboreal (tree-dwelling) tarantulas have thick brushes of hair at the end of each leg, so they can climb on smooth leaf surfaces. The Goliath bird-eating spider (''Theraphosa blondi'') is the largest tarantula species of all. It can have an 11-inch leg span and weigh as much as  6 ounces.

Tarantulas have two major body parts—the prosoma and the abdomen. A waist-like connection (pedicle) allows the two parts to move independently. They have a thick covering of hair and tiny bristles on the abdomen. 

There are 8 closely grouped eyes—2 large round eyes in the middle surrounded by 3 eyes on each side.

Most spiders are divided into 2 groups—the ''Araneomorphae'' (true spiders) and the ''Mygalomorphae'' (tarantulas and their relatives). True spiders have fangs that point sideways. Tarantulas are not true spiders because their fangs point straight down like those of a snake.

==Where does it live?==

Tarantulas of North America, South America, and Australia are called New World tarantulas. Those of Europe, Asia, and Africa are called Old World tarantulas. The rainforests of French Guiana, just north of the equator, are home to about a dozen species of tarantulas.
  
Many tarantula species live in tropical regions. Others live in warm, dry desert areas. Their natural habitat varies, ranging from savannas and grasslands to rainforests and mountains. In rainforests, tarantulas build burrows in spreading tree roots and bromeliads. Some types of tarantulas live in burrows beneath the ground and some live in tented treetop shelters.

The Goliath Bird-eater is found in North America. It is native to the rain forests of northern South America. It makes its home inside deep burrows in marshland or swamps.

The Pink-toed Tarantula is found in the Amazon Basin and on Caribbean islands. It climbs banana trees to nest in folded leaves. It sometimes makes a home in a palm- thatched roof or the hollow center of a pineapple plant.

==What does it eat?==

Tarantulas eat insects and other arthropods. Arboreal tarantulas hunt for food above ground. Ground-dwelling tarantulas hunt on or near the ground. Instead of spinning webs to catch prey, tarantulas use ambush as their primary method of capture. They grind up their food with teeth behind their fangs.  

The Pink-toed Tarantula eats insects and tree frogs. The Western Desert Tarantula preys on lizards, crickets, beetles, grasshoppers, cicadas, and caterpillars. Very big tarantulas kill mice and lizards and even birds.

Despite its name, the Goliath bird-eating spider prefers small lizards, frogs, and insects to birds.

==How does it defend itself?==

Tarantulas have many enemies. They are food for birds, reptiles, amphibians, and other tarantulas. The hairs covering their body alert them to vibrations. If disturbed, tarantulas adopt a “threat” posture. They raise the front half of the body, hold the legs high in the air, and ready the jaws for action. 

Since they are arthropods, they rely on an exoskeleton for protection. They are most vulnerable while molting because they are fragile and cannot move. A smaller insect can easily kill a tarantula while it is molting. 

Snakes and birds are enemies of the Western Desert Tarantula. In Eurasia, mongooses dig tarantulas from burrows.
Tarantulas can release stinging hairs from their legs to irritate the skin of an attacker. New World tarantulas use urticating (hooked or barbed) hairs as a defense. When threatened, some species kick these tiny, sharp hairs off their back end. Each hair is covered with tiny barbs and is light enough to float on air. Other species deliver the hairs through direct contact. The hairs cause an animal’s skin to become itchy and sore. Old World tarantulas do not have urticating hairs.
When threatened, the Goliath Bird-eater makes a hissing sound with its back legs by rubbing the bristles together. It flicks urticating hairs from its abdomen. The hairs cause painful rashes on humans. The bite is not very toxic but it causes pain, nausea, and sweating.   

The most vicious predator of tarantulas is the female tarantula hawk.  Its body can be up to 2 inches long and its stinger can be 1/3 of an inch long. Upon entering the burrow, the tarantula hawk paralizes the female tarantula with its sting, then drags her away to be used as food for larvae. There is no defence against this enemy.

==What stages of metamorphosis does it go through?==

The Mexican Red-Knee Tarantula grows extremely slowly. A female has a life span of around twenty years. She lays a clutch of 100 to 600 eggs. After hatching, the spiderlings molt every 2 weeks for the first few months. Molting is less frequent as they mature. They reach maturity at around 5 years of age. When fully grown they molt about once a year.

The Western Desert Tarantula may take 10 years to reach maturity. A female lives a long time, but a male usually lives only 2 to 3 months. Eggs hatch in about 7 weeks. The young spiderlings cut holes in the silk covering and disperse right away to escape being eaten by their mother. Most spiderlings fail to reach maturity because they are eaten by predators or cannot find enough food. 

The female Goliath Bird-eater always mates, but eventually kills her mate. She lays a clutch of 100 to 200 eggs. The eggs are stored in the burrow for about 6 weeks. Spiderlings hatch in about 2 months. They stay in the nest at first, then molt and disperse. Females mature in 3 to 4 years and have an average life span of 15 to 25 years. Males die soon after maturing and have a life span of about 3 to 6 years.

==What special behavior does it exhibit?==

Tarantulas are active at night and hide in dark cavities or burrows during the day. They emerge to hunt in the dark. They use their sense of touch to find prey. 

Urticating hairs are used to mark territory and to protect burrow entrances, cocoons, and egg sacs.  

Tarantulas have their sense of smell in their feet and use special hairs on their feet and legs to taste things. 

They can re-grow lost legs. Sometimes they will pull off an inured leg and eat it.

==How does this bug affect people?==

Tarantulas attack humans only if provoked. They would rather hide. The bite of a North American tarantula is not very dangerous. People report it is similar to the sting of a wasp or bee. However, the bite can be fatal to a person who is allergic to the venom. Some South American species have deadly venom. The venom of the Indian ornamental tarantula is among the most dangerous to humans. 

Some people roast tarantulas to burn the hairs off, then enjoy them as a snack. Sometimes the cooked leftover fangs are used after the meal as a tooth pick.

The Mexican Red-Knee Tarantula is native to parts of Central America. It has become endangered due to habitat destruction and pet-trade collection. It is one of the few arthropods protected under CITES laws (International Convention of Trade in Endangered Species).

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Analogue Electronics Page}}
BJTs are very versatile and very simple devices. They can be used for amplification and switching in a variety of configuratons, each with uses and drawbacks.

==Structure==

BJTs are so named because they consist of junctions between the two kinds of semiconductor (''n'' and ''p'' type) and have one ''pn'' junction and one ''np'' junction (i.e. the other way around). Compare this to a unipolar junction transistor,which has only one junction. The construction of a BJT is very simple - it is three alternating layers of semiconductor. The diagram below show the basic construction, but they are not to scale.

===NPN Transistors===

The '''NPN''' transistor is made of layers in that order:

[[image:NPN BJT.svg|centre]]

[[image:BJT symbol NPN.svg|right|75px]]It is equivalent to two back-to-back diodes, but connecting two diodes like this will not work, as the thicknesses and geometry of each layer is important, as are effects from the interaction of the two outer layers.

The symbol for this kind of transistor is shown to the right. It can be drawn with or without the circle. With is technically more correct, but it is not necessary. A useful mnemonic for remembering which way the arrow points on an NPN transistor is:

::&quot;'''N'''ot '''P'''ointing i'''N'''&quot;.

The arrow is always drawn on the emitter - it actually means which way (conventional) current flows in the emitter.

===PNP Transistors===

The '''PNP''' transistor is the same, except the order of the layers is reversed:

[[image:PNP BJT.svg|centre]]

[[image:BJT symbol PNP.svg|right|75px]]It is equivalent to two nose-to-nose diodes, but as before, just connecting two diodes will not work. Generally, a PNP transistor is identical to an NPN transistor, but with all currents reversed.

The symbol is the same, but with the arrow reversed. Note that the emitter of PNP transistors often face upwards.

We will not really consider the PNP transistor at first - it is essentially the same as the more common NPN transistor, but reversed. We will look at applications for it later.

==Operating Modes==

How the BJT works depends on the bias of each junction. Each junction is like a diode, and in some ways behaves accoridngly. Since there are two junctions, each of which can be biased in two ways (forward or reverse), there are four possible modes for the BJT. The following table lists them. The modes are the same for NPN and PNP.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
!Operating Mode!!EBJ!!CBJ
|-
|'''Cut-Off'''||Reverse||Reverse
|-
|'''Active'''||Forward||Reverse
|-
|'''Saturation'''||Forward||Forward
|-
|'''Reverse-Active'''||Reverse||Forward
|}

The Active mode is generally used for amplification, and the Cut-Off and Saturation modes are used for switching and binary logic (when you just want 1 or 0).

The working of a BJT will be explained on the next page, [[/Active Mode|BJTs in Active Mode]].</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Lists ==

Any language needs a way to handle collections of objects and prolog is no exception. A list in prolog can look like this:

 [a, b, c, d, e]

The brackets are the beginning and the end of the list, and the commas separate the various elements. Here all the elements are atoms, but a list can contain all sorts of elements, and different types of element can occur in the same list. The following are examples of valid lists:

 [a, A, B, C, D]
 [p(A,V), p(a, V)]
 [[a1,a2,a3],[b1,b2,b3],[c1,c2,c3]]
 [[A,B], [B,C], quu([a,b,c],[a,b,d,e,f],_), c, m, D]

Most prolog code will not define a list explicitly, like these examples, but rather handle lists of any length, with many possible elements. To handle lists without knowing what's inside them or how long they are, you use the bar notation:

 [Head|Tail]

In this notation the variable '''Head''' represents the leftmost element of the list and the variable '''Tail''' represents the rest of the list represented as another list. A head can be anything, from a predicate to another list, but the tail is always another list.

Some default library rules are provided, e.g., ''length'', ''reverse'', ''append'' (also, these can be defined easily, as shown at the bottom of this page). To see how these works, try the following codes:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
 ?- length([1, 3, 6], What).
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
Prolog will answer 3.

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
 ?- append([a], b, Z).
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
 ?- append([a], [b], Z).
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
Observe the difference here.


&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
 ?- append(X, [1, 2], [1, 1, 2]).
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
 ?- reverse([1,2], What).
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;


The following program shows how to use this.

 listsplit([H|T], H, T).

Here, '''[H|T]''' is a list, '''H''' is the head, and '''T''' is the tail.
For the query
 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
 ?- listsplit([a,b,c,d,e], a, [b,c,d,e]).
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 

Prolog will answer yes. For the query 

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt; 
 ?- listsplit([a,b,c,d,e], A, B).
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
Prolog will answer:

 A = a
 B = [b, c, d, e] ;

The program can even be used to 'create' a list:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
 ?- listsplit(List, a, [b,c,d,e]).
 List = [a, b, c, d, e] ;
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
here are some examples of lists, and what heads and tails they result in:

&lt;center&gt;

{| celpadding=&quot;3&quot;
|-
! List
! Head 
! Tail
|-
| &lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[a,b,c,d,e]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
| &lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;a&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
| &lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[b,c,d,e]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
|-
| &lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[a]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; ||  &lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;a&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
| &lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[] (an empty list)&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
|-
| &lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[a,b,c],a,b,[a,b]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
| &lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[a,b,c]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
| &lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[a,b,[a,b]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

Note that the empty list '''[ ]''' cannot be split up and therefore will not [[Programming:Prolog Unification|unify]] with '''[H|T]'''.

Splitting up lists can be done with more than two heads:

 [H1, H2, H3|Tail]

This will split a list up into the first three elements, and the rest of the list. Note, however that this will fail if the list has less than three elements.

Now consider the following program:

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
 last([Elem], Elem).
 last([_|Tail], Elem) :- last(Tail, Elem).
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

This relation defines the last element of a list. It can be used as a program to find a list's last element:

 ?- last([a,b,c,d,e],X).
 X = e

First, there is the stop predicate, that says that the last element of a list with one element, is that element.
The second line says that the last element ('''Elem''') of a list '''[_|Tail]''' is the last element of its tail ('''Tail'''). Since we don't care about the head, we use the anonymous variable, '''_''', for it.

== Examples ==

=== The '''member''' predicate ===

Normally, you would use builtin predicates for these list operations, instead of writing them yourself. Builtin predicates are defined by your prolog implementation, but can be used in any program. These implementations are shown here to illustrate how to modify lists.

'''Member''' is a standard prolog [[Programming: Built-in predicates|built-in]] predicate.
You use it like this:

 member(Element, List).

Where List is any prolog list, and Element is any element in that list.
The following, for instance, succeeds (returns 'Yes'):
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
 ?- member(a, [a, b, c]).
 ?- member(b, [a, b, c]). 	
 ?- member(c, [a, b, c]).
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
This query:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
 ?- member(Element, [a, b, c]).
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
Will return the following values for Element:
 Element = a;
 Element = b;
 Element = c;
The member predicate is defined like this:
 member(X, [X|_]).        % member(X, [Head|Tail]) is true if X = Head 
                          % that is, if X is the head of the list
 member(X, [_|Tail]) :-   % or if X is a member of Tail,
   member(X, Tail).       % ie. if member(X, Tail) is true.

=== The '''append''' predicate ===

The built-in predicate append/3 attaches a list to the back of another, in other words, it concatenates two lists. It's used like this:
 append(Xs, Ys, Zs)
Where Zs is Ys appended to Xs. The following succeed:
 append([a, b, c], [1, 2, 3], [a, b, c, 1, 2, 3]).
 append([], [a, b, c], [a, b, c]).
 append([A, B, C], [1, 2, 3], [A, B, C, 1, 2, 3]).
You can use it to append two lists:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
 ?- append([a, b, c], [d, e, f], Result).

 Result = [a, b, c, d, e, f]
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
Or to split a list into left and right parts,
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
 ?- append(ListLeft, ListRight, [a, b, c]).
 
 ListLeft  = []
 ListRight = [a, b, c] ;
 
 ListLeft  = [a]
 ListRight = [b, c] ;
 
 ListLeft  = [a, b]
 ListRight = [c] ;
 
 ListLeft  = [a, b, c]
 ListRight = [] ;
 
 No
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
You can even use it with three variables. (Try this for yourself to see what the result looks like).

The append predicate can be defined like this:

 append([], Ys, Ys).
 append([X|Xs], Ys, [X|Zs]) :- append(Xs, Ys, Zs).

The first line simply unifies the last two lists, it succeeds for queries like: append([], [a,b,c], [a,b,c]). or append([], X, [e]). in which case it would bind X = [e].
The second line (the recursive clause) declares that, given append(A,B,C) the head of A is equal to the head of C, and appending the tail of A, with B, gives the tail of C. 

Due to the nondeterminism of Prolog, append/3 has many uses. It can be used as another way to implement last/2 which was defined earlier.

 last(List, Last) :- append(_, [Last], List).

Many more definitions are possible,

 split(List, Pivot, Left, Right) :- append(Left, [Pivot|Right], List).

 ?- split([o,o,x,e,e,e], x, L, R).
 L = [o, o],
 R = [e, e, e] ;

 ?- split(A, -, [o,o], [u,u,u]).
 A = [o, o, -, u, u, u].

=== Reversing a list ===

We will look at two ways to reverse a list, first of all the naive way is to simply keep taking the head off and appending it onto the end,

 reverse([],[]).
 reverse([X|Xs],YsX) :- reverse(Xs,Ys), append(Ys,[X],YsX).

Executing it means that you traverse the list over and over again appending each time,
A more efficient version can be created by taking the definition of append:

 append([], Ys, Ys).
 append([X|Xs], Ys, [X|Zs]) :- append(Xs, Ys, Zs).

and changing it slightly,

 revappend([], Ys, Ys).
 revappend([X|Xs], Ys, Zs) :- revappend(Xs, [X|Ys], Zs).

then,

 reverse(Xs,Ys) :- revappend(Xs,[],Ys).

The strategy used in revappend is called an accumulating parameter.

== Exercises ==

(1) The built in predicate length() can be used to find the length of a list. For example:
 ?- length([a,b,95,[1,1,1,1]],X).
 X = 4 .
 ?- length([a,XYZ,59,1,1,1,1],X).
 X = 7 .
How might this predicate be defined?

== Answers to Exercises ==

(1) As you probably guessed, we will use recursion.
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
len([], 0).
len([_ | Tail], Length) :-
    len(Tail, Length1),
    Length is Length1 + 1.
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
Another solution which uses tail recursion optimisation and Prolog's arithmetic (And therefore uses less stack space):
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
% 0 - Calling Rule
cl(List, Out) :-
	call(List, 0 , Out).

% 1 - Terminating condition
call([], Count, Count).

% 2 - Recursive rule
call([H|T], Count, Out) :-
	Count1 is Count + 1,
	call(T, Count1, Out).
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

== Overview ==

The '''''Waddiwasi''''' charm apparently causes violent removal of chewing gum (possibly among other things) from the place that it is currently stuck.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Professor Lupin]] uses this spell when he encounters [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peeves|Peeves]] stuffing chewing gum into a lock. He says that this is a very useful little spell, before he uses it; and it is interesting, because the effect is to fire the chewing gum up Peeves' nostril and send him away, something that many teachers had been unable to do. As to its usefulness, though, it does not seem to be used anywhere else in the books.

==Active Mode==

===In the Emitter===

Recall from the [[Analogue Electronics/BJTs|previous page]] that a BJT in active mode has its emitter-base junction in forward bias and its collector-base junction (CBJ) in reverse. This means, for an NPN device, that the emitter is at a lower potential than the base, which is lower than the collector. Generally, the voltage between the collector and base is larger than the voltage between the emitter and base.

[[Image:NPN BJT Basic Operation (Active).svg|centre|]]

The EBJ is forward biased, so electrons will be injected from the emitter into the base. Also, some holes will be injected into the emitter ''from'' the base, but the emitter is much more heavily doped than the base, so this current is small (this is the preferable situation, so transistors are designed and made like this).

The electrons flowing out of the emitter and the holes flowing in together constitute the emitter current, ''i&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;'', which is defined to be &quot;out of&quot; the emitter lead. As we said before, this current is dominated by the electron flow.

We might expect the electrons to be either &quot;stuck&quot; in the base, or to be removed via the base, as the CBJ is reverse biased, and therefore we do not expect it to be conducting. However, recall that when a ''pn'' junction is reverse biased like this, all that it means is that holes cannot travel from left to right, and electrons cannot go from right to left. Normally, this results in no current, as there are no electrons present in ''p''-type material.

===In the Base===

[[Image:NPN BJT Minority Carrier Profiles (Active mode).svg|center]]

Let us now look at what happens to the electrons injected into the base. Because the base is made of ''p''-type silicon, the electrons are '''minority carriers'''. The base is very thin (the diagram above is not to scale), so the electron concentration, ''n&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'', will have a linear characteristic. This is explained in [[Semiconductors]], and we will not try to prove it here. The electron concentration will be highest at the emitter side of the base, and will be zero at the collector side. It is zero here because the CBJ is in reverse bias, causing all minority carriers to be attracted to and swept across to the collector (by the same token, majority carriers, holes, are repelled from the junction). We will term the electron concentration at the EBJ ''n&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''(0).

The EBJ is in forward bias, so the concentration at the emitter side of the base ''n&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''(0) will be proportional to ''e&lt;sup&gt;v&lt;sub&gt;BE&lt;/sub&gt;/v&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;'':

{{eqn|Electron Concentration at EBJ side of Base}}
::&lt;math&gt;n_p \left( 0 \right) = n_{p0} \exp \left( {\frac{{v_{BE} }}
{{V_T }}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

where
*''n&lt;sup&gt;p0&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the thermal equilibrium concentration of electrons in the base
*''v&lt;sub&gt;BE&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the forward voltage across the EBJ
*''V&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the thermal voltage (about 25 mV at room temperature - 300K)

The decreasing concentration of electrons in the base as we move toward the collector causes a diffusion current in this direction (electrons try to diffuse to lower concentrations). This diffusion current, ''I&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is proportional to the gradient of the electron concentration:

{{eqn|Electron current in the Base}}
::&lt;math&gt;I_n  = A_E qD_n \frac{{d\left( {n_p \left( x \right)} \right)}}{{dx}}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;I_n  = A_E qD_n \left( { - \frac{{n_p \left( 0 \right)}}{W}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

where
*''x'' is the distance of a point from the EBJ 
*''A&lt;sup&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the cross sectional area of the EBJ
*''q'' is the magnitude charge on an electron (a positive quantity)
*''D&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the electron diffusivity in the base
*''W'' is the effective width of the base (taking into account reduction due to depletion zones)

For more information on exactly why this is, see [[Semiconductors]].

Due to the negative slope of the electron concentration, we get a negative current (with respect to ''x''), which means that it flows right-left. This is not surprising, as electrons are negatively charged, so a diffusion form left to right leads to a current from right to left.

Because the electrons here are in a ''p''-type material populated with holes, some will recombine with the holes in the base. Due to the base being very thin, this is a small proportion of the total number of electrons. This effect causes the electron concentration in the base to be slightly non linear (dashed line in the above diagram). Because the concentration is higher near the EBJ, we expect a larger number of electrons to recombine per unit length than we do at the CBJ, so the line is steeper at the EBJ, leading the &quot;dished&quot; shape shown in the diagram.

In summary so far, we are injecting electrons into the base from the emitter, and these are readily swept up by the electric field across the CBJ. The base is made very thin to allow just this to occur. A small number of electrons will recombine with the holes (which are the majority carriers) in the base layer. However, the base is very thin, so the electrons are usually swept up before they can recombine. This means that a large current will flow through the transistor from emitter to base. A smaller current, made up of the holes flowing into the emitter and the recombining holes makes up the base current.

This is why the emitter and collector are so named - the emitter ''emits'' electrons into the base, and the collector ''collects'' them from the base.

===Collector Current===

In the sections above, we saw that the majority of the electrons diffusing across the base make it to the CBJ, whereupon they are swept up by the electric field across the CBJ, which is in reverse bias. These &quot;swept-up&quot; electrons constitute the collector current, ''i&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;'' Therefore, we can say that:

::&lt;math&gt;i_C=I_n \,&lt;/math&gt;.

Since ''I&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is negative, this implies that the collector current is negative too, with respect to our direction of increasing ''x''. This means a current from right to left, so flowing ''into'' the collector lead. In the equations below, we will remove the negative sign, and work with the magnitude of the current.

Thus:

::&lt;math&gt;i_C  = A_E qD_n \left( {\frac{{n_p \left( 0 \right)}}{W}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting for ''n&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''(0) from above, we get:

::&lt;math&gt;I_n  = A_E qD_n \frac{{n_{p0} \exp \left( {v_{BE} /V_T } \right)}}{W}&lt;/math&gt;

We now define a quantity called the '''saturation current''' as follows:

::&lt;math&gt;I_S  = \frac{{A_E qD_n n_{p0} }}{W}&lt;/math&gt;,

leading to:

{{eqn|Collector Current}}
::&lt;math&gt;i_C = I_S \exp \left( \frac{v_{BE}} {V_T } \right)&lt;/math&gt;.

We can also substitute ''n&lt;sub&gt;p0&lt;/sub&gt;=n&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;'' into our expression for ''I&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;'':

{{eqn|Saturation Current}}
::&lt;math&gt;I_S  = \frac{{A_E qD_n n_i^2 }}
{{N_A W}}&lt;/math&gt;

Note here that the collector current does not depend on the voltage across the CBJ, ''v&lt;sub&gt;CB&lt;/sub&gt;''. So long as the CBJ is in reverse bias, the electrons that reach the CBJ will be removed into the collector.

Our newly defined saturation current, '''I&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;'' is inversely proportional to the width of the base, ''W'', and directly proportional to the area of the EBJ. The saturation current can generally be expected to lie in the range of 10&lt;sup&gt;-18&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;-12&lt;/sup&gt; A. It is very much affected by temperature as it proportional to the square intrinsic electron concentration. Therefore, it is also proportional to the cube of the absolute temperature. This is explained in [[Semiconductors]]. For an actual transistor, the saturation current will be given by the manufacturer on the [[w:datasheet|datasheet]].

As the saturation current is related to the ratio of the EBJ area and the width of the base, it is also known as the '''scale current'''. This is a frequently-used principle in the field of IC design, as two transistors that are identical except for EBJ area will have, for the same ''v&lt;sub&gt;BE&lt;/sub&gt;'', collector currents differing by a factor equal to the ratio of the EBJ areas. 

===Base Current===

We have already seen that there are two components to the base current: the holes injected into the emitter (''i&lt;sub&gt;B1&lt;/sub&gt;'') and the holes that are supplied (via diffusion) to replace those lost by recombination with electrons in transit from emitter to collector. This is ''i&lt;sub&gt;B2&lt;/sub&gt;.

''i&lt;sub&gt;B1&lt;/sub&gt;'' is given by the equation for a forward-biased ''pn''-junction, similar to that used earlier:

&lt;math&gt;i_{B1}  = \frac{{A_E qD_p n_i^2 }}{{N_D L_p }}\exp \left( {\frac{{v_{BE} }}
{{V_T }}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

where:
*''A&lt;sup&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the cross sectional area of the EBJ
*''L&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the hole diffusion length
*''D&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the hole diffusivity in the base
*''N&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the doping concentration of the emitter

Note that because the emitter is very long (as opposed to the very short base), we do not use the emitter length, but rather ''L&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'', the diffusion length of the holes.

''i&lt;sub&gt;B2&lt;/sub&gt;'' can be evaluated by looking at the average time that it takes for an electron in the base to recombine. This time, called the '''minority-carrier lifetime''', is denoted by ''&amp;tau;&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;''. In this case, in this time, all the electrons in the base (constituting a charge ''Q&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'') will have recombined.

In a steady state, this charge will be constantly replenished by the electrons flowing in from the emitter. in order for the electrons to be replenished to maintain a steady state, the injected current must supply the base with a (positive) charge of:

{{eqn|Base Recombination Current related to Minority-Carrier Lifetime}}
::&lt;math&gt;i_{B2}=\frac{Q_n}{\tau_b}&lt;/math&gt;

The minority carrier charge stored in the base in steady-state is related to the area under the triangle formed by the electron-concentration curve (which is a straight line), which can be seen in the diagram above. Multiplying by the volume of the base, electronic charge and the maximum concentration, ''n&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''(0), we get the total charge to be:

::&lt;math&gt;Q_n = A_EWq \times \frac{1}{2} n_p\left( 0 \right).&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting for ''n&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''(0) and then for ''n&lt;sub&gt;p0&lt;/sub&gt;'' gives:

::&lt;math&gt;Q_n  = \frac{1}{2}\frac{{A_E Wqn_i^2 }}{{N_A }}\exp \left( {\frac{{v_{BE} }}{{V_T }}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting from the equation relating ''i&lt;sub&gt;B2&lt;/sub&gt;'' to ''&amp;tau;&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;'', we get:

::&lt;math&gt;i_{B2}  = \frac{1}{2}\frac{{A_E Wqn_i^2 }}{{\tau_b N_A }}\exp \left( {\frac{{v_{BE} }}{{V_T }}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Now, the total base current is given by:

::&lt;math&gt;i_B  = i_{B1}  + i_{B2}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;i_B  = \frac{{A_E qD_p n_i^2 }}
{{N_D L_p }}\exp \left( {\frac{{v_{BE} }}
{{V_T }}} \right) + \frac{1}
{2}\frac{{A_E Wqn_i^2 }}
{{N_A \tau_b}}\exp \left( {\frac{{v_{BE} }}
{{V_T }}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

This unwieldy form can be simplified somewhat by applying the expression for the saturation current and factoring out the exponential part:

::&lt;math&gt;i_B  = I_S \left( {\frac{{D_p N_A W}}
{{D_n N_D L_p }} + \frac{1}
{2}\frac{{W^2 }}
{{D_n \tau _b }}} \right)\exp \left( {\frac{{v_{BE} }}
{{V_T }}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

As an aside here, notice that the part given by ''i&lt;sub&gt;B1&lt;/sub&gt;'' is related to the following ratios:
*Hole to electron diffusivity
*Acceptor to donor doping concentration
*Base width the hole diffusion length in the emitter

We now define a quantity called ''&amp;beta;'' as follows:

::&lt;math&gt;\beta  = 1 \bigg/\left( {\frac{{D_p N_A W}}
{{D_n N_D L_p }} + \frac{1}
{2}\frac{{W^2 }}
{{D_n \tau _b }}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

''&amp;beta;'' is a scalar quantity (see [[/ß dimensional Analysis|here]] for confirmation) that is defined entirely by the physical properties of the transistor. We can see that it relates the base and collector current:

::&lt;math&gt;i_B=\frac{i_C}{\beta}&lt;/math&gt;.

''&amp;beta;'' generally takes a value of between 50 and 300 for &quot;normal&quot; transistors, but for more expensive devices (especially those sold in IC form such as the SSM2210), it can reach 1000. ''&amp;beta;'' is often called the '''common-emitter current gain'''. It is also often called ''h&lt;sub&gt;FE&lt;/sub&gt;''. This is due to convention in circuit theory. To see why, see [[Circuit theory/Transistors|this page]].
 
We can see that ''&amp;beta;'' is influence by some parameter related to the production process rather than the physical properties of the semiconductor. In order to obtain high ''&amp;beta;'', we can make the base width, ''W'', very small and dope the emitter very heavily compared to the base. Also, note that so far, we have assumed that ''&amp;beta;'' is constant for a given transistor. We shall see soon that this is not necessarily the case, but it is frequently a useful approximation.

===Emitter Current===

From [[Circuit theory/Kirchhoff's Laws#Kirchhoff's Current Law|Kirchhoff's Current Law]], we know that all current entering the transistor must also leave the transistor. Given the &quot;default&quot; current direction for each of the terminals of the device, we see that:

::&lt;math&gt;i_E=i_B+i_C&lt;/math&gt;

Using the relationship between ''i&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''i&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;'', we have

::&lt;math&gt;i_E = i_C + \frac{i_C}{\beta}=\frac{\beta+1}{\beta}i_C &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;i_E = I_S \frac{\beta }
{{\beta  + 1}}\exp \left( {\frac{{v_{BE} }}
{{V_T }}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

We can also define ''&amp;alpha;'' such that:

::&lt;math&gt;i_C=\alpha i_E&lt;/math&gt;.

''&amp;alpha;'' is therefore:

::&lt;math&gt;\alpha=\frac{\beta}{\beta+1}&lt;/math&gt;

We can easily see from this that ''&amp;alpha;'' is less than, but close to, unity. Substituting with ''&amp;alpha;'' in the expression for ''i&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;, gives

::&lt;math&gt;i_E  = \left( {\frac{{I_S }}
{\alpha }} \right)\exp \left( {\frac{{v_{BE} }}
{{V_T }}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Rearranging the expression for ''&amp;alpha;'', we also have:

::&lt;math&gt;\beta = \frac{\alpha}{\alpha-1}&lt;/math&gt;

''&amp;alpha;'' is termed the '''common-base current gain'''. ''&amp;alpha;'' and ''&amp;beta;'' describe the transistor in forward-active mode only (reverse active operation is different). Sometimes it may be necessary to explicitly show this, by writing ''&amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''&amp;beta;&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;''. These can be used interchangeably with ''&amp;alpha;'' and ''&amp;beta;''.

It is also possible to consider the action of a BJT in active mode using energy band diagrams. This explanation can be found on [[/Band Diagrams|this page]].

==Large Signal Models==

In the previous section, we saw how the NPN BJT behaves in the forward-active mode. That is, the base is at a higher potential than the emitter and the collector is at a higher potential than the base. We can use the properties to &quot;convert&quot; a BJT to simpler components for analysis. The models will work for all signals, and so are called '''large-signal equivalent models''', or LSEMs.

===The Common-Base LSEM===

The forward biased EBJ causes a current to flow in the collector that is exponential with base-emitter voltage, ''v&lt;sub&gt;BE&lt;/sub&gt;''. This current is not related to the voltage of the collector, as long as it is greater than that of the base (so the CBJ is in reverse bias). The BJT thus behaves like a (non-linear) voltage-controlled current source, controlled by ''v&lt;sub&gt;BE&lt;/sub&gt;''.

The base current is a fraction, given by the emitter current divided by ''&amp;beta;'', and the emitter current is the sum of the collector and base currents. Generally, ''&amp;beta;'' is large, so the base current is small, and emitter current is approximately equal to the collector current.

From the above description of an NPN BJT, we can derive an equivalent circuit model that describes the BJT in terms of simpler components:

[[image:NPN BJT Active LSEM.svg|right]]

Diode ''D&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;'' has a current of ''i&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;'' in it. From above, we have:

::&lt;math&gt;i_E  = \left( {\frac{{I_S }}
{\alpha }} \right)\exp \left( {\frac{{v_{BE} }}
{{V_T }}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

We can call &lt;math&gt;I_S/\alpha&lt;/math&gt; the saturation current for the diode, ''I_{SE}''. The current in the collector was previously established to be given by:

::&lt;math&gt;i_C  = i_S \exp \left( {\frac{{v_{BE} }}
{{V_T }}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, we can see that ''i&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;'' is related to ''i&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;'' by dividing by ''&amp;alpha;''. We also saw this previously in the section where ''&amp;alpha;'' was derived. 

We now have a BJT model that describes all the currents in terms of ''v&lt;sub&gt;BE&lt;/sub&gt;'', and is reference to the base voltage. Let us now consider this model as a two-port network, with the input port being between the emitter and the base, and the output port between the collector and the base. The base is therefore common. As we can see, the current gain is equal to ''&amp;alpha;'', hence the naming of ''&amp;alpha;'' the common-base current gain:

&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot; /&gt;
[[image:NPN BJT Active LSEM 2-Port Network.svg|center]]

===The Common-Emitter LSEM===

We can also have a BJT model referenced to a common emitter:

[[image:NPN BJT LSEM CE.svg|right]]

The collector current is given, just as for the common-base configuration, by:

::&lt;math&gt;i_C = I_S \exp \left( \frac{v_{be}}{V_T} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

We know that the base current is given by the collector current divided by ''&amp;beta;'':

::&lt;math&gt;i_B = \frac{I_S}{\beta} \exp \left( \frac{v_{be}}{V_T} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

We can therefore easily see that the collector current is related to the base current by:

::&lt;math&gt;i_C=\beta i_B&lt;/math&gt;.

As before, we consider the current from base to emitter to flow through an internal diode. This time, we call it ''D&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;'', but now its saturation current is given by:

::&lt;math&gt;I_{SB}=I_S / \beta&lt;/math&gt;</text>

{{Exercises|1=
* Explain how GHCi evaluates &lt;code&gt;quadruple 5&lt;/code&gt;.
* Define a function that subtracts 12 from half its argument.}}

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
quadruple x = double (double x)
quadruple 5 = double (double 5)
quadruple 5 = double 10
quadruple 5 = 20
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
subtractHalf x = (half x) - 12
&lt;/source&gt;


{{Exercises|1=
* Write a function to calculate the volume of a box.
* Approximately how many stones are the famous pyramids at Giza made up of? Use GHCi for your calculations.
}}

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
volumeBox w h d = w * h * d
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

One approach for the Giza problem is starting from the pyramid volume and the estimated stone volume. Using general functions for the task, that might look like this in GHCi:

&lt;pre&gt;
Prelude&gt; let volumeBox w h d = w * h * d -- Just as above.
Prelude&gt; let volumeSquarePyramid b h = b * b * h / 3
Prelude&gt; volumeSquarePyramid 230.4 146.5 / volumeBox 1 1 1
2592276.48
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
volumeCylinder r h = h * area r

      <comment>/* Building lists */ Added the sample with 8 at the end of the list</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{Haskell solution}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

====Building lists====

{{Exercises|1=
# Would the following piece of Haskell work: &lt;code&gt;3:[True,False]&lt;/code&gt;? Why or why not?
# Write a function &lt;code&gt;cons8&lt;/code&gt; that takes a list and conses &lt;code&gt;8&lt;/code&gt; on to it. Test it out on the following lists by doing:
## &lt;code&gt;cons8 []&lt;/code&gt;
## &lt;code&gt;cons8 [1,2,3]&lt;/code&gt;
## &lt;code&gt;cons8 [True,False]&lt;/code&gt;
## &lt;code&gt;let foo = cons8 [1,2,3]&lt;/code&gt;
## &lt;code&gt;cons8 foo&lt;/code&gt;
# Adapt the above function in a way that 8 is at the end of the list
# Write a function that takes two arguments, a list and a thing, and conses the thing onto the list. You should start out with:
&amp;#8195;&amp;#8195;&amp;#8195;&amp;#8195;&amp;#8195;&lt;code&gt;let myCons list thing =&lt;/code&gt;
}}

# This won't work. &lt;tt&gt;[True, False]&lt;/tt&gt; is a list of booleans, &lt;tt&gt;3&lt;/tt&gt; is an integer.
# &lt;code&gt;let cons8 list = 8:list&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;let cons8 = (:) 8&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;let cons8 list = (:) 8 list&lt;/code&gt; are all valid functions.
## &lt;code&gt;cons8 []&lt;/code&gt; returns &lt;code&gt;[8]&lt;/code&gt;
## &lt;code&gt;cons8 [1,2,3]&lt;/code&gt; returns &lt;code&gt;[8,1,2,3]&lt;/code&gt;
## &lt;code&gt;cons8 [True,False]&lt;/code&gt; gives a type error. This is the same mistake as in exercise 1.
## &lt;code&gt;let foo = cons8 [1,2,3]&lt;/code&gt; gives no output message, but foo is &lt;code&gt;[8,1,2,3]&lt;/code&gt;. Try it!
## &lt;code&gt;cons8 foo&lt;/code&gt; (assuming you did 2.4) returns &lt;code&gt;[8,8,1,2,3]&lt;/code&gt;
# As recognized &lt;code&gt;let cons8 list = list:8&lt;/code&gt; does not work, cause 8 is not a list, but &lt;code&gt;let cons8 list = list:[8]&lt;/code&gt; will work
# &lt;code&gt;let myCons list thing = thing : list&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;let myCons list thing = (:) thing list&lt;/code&gt; are both valid functions.

====Lists within lists====

{{Exercises|1=
#Which of these are valid Haskell and which are not? Rewrite in cons notation.
## &lt;code&gt;[1,2,3,[]]&lt;/code&gt;
## &lt;code&gt;[1,[2,3],4]&lt;/code&gt;
## &lt;code&gt;[[1,2,3],[]]&lt;/code&gt;
#Which of these are valid Haskell, and which are not? Rewrite in comma and bracket notation.
## &lt;code&gt;[]:[[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]&lt;/code&gt;
## &lt;code&gt;[]:[]&lt;/code&gt;
## &lt;code&gt;[]:[]:[]&lt;/code&gt;
## &lt;code&gt;[1]:[]:[]&lt;/code&gt;
## &lt;code&gt;[&quot;hi&quot;]:[1]:[]&lt;/code&gt;
#Can Haskell have lists of lists of lists? Why or why not?
#Why is the following list invalid in Haskell? Don't worry too much if you don't get this one yet.
## &lt;code&gt;[[1,2],3,[4,5]]&lt;/code&gt;
}}

# 1 and 2 aren't valid Haskell, 3 is valid:
## &lt;code&gt;1:2:3:[]:[]&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;2&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;3&lt;/code&gt; are integers, while &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt; is a list.
## &lt;code&gt;1:(2:3:[]):4:[]&lt;/code&gt;. Again, &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;4&lt;/code&gt; are integers, and &lt;code&gt;2:3:[]&lt;/code&gt; is a list of integers.
## &lt;code&gt;(1:2:3:[]):[]:[]&lt;/code&gt;. This is valid Haskell, as &lt;code&gt;1:2:3:[]&lt;/code&gt; is a list of integers, and &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt; is an empty list (of any type).
# The first four are valid Haskell. The fifth is not.
## &lt;code&gt;[[],[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]&lt;/code&gt;. Both &lt;code&gt;[1,2,3]&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;[4,5,6]&lt;/code&gt; are lists of integers. The whole list is a list of lists of integers. We can cons an empty list (of any type) in front of it.
## &lt;code&gt;[[]]&lt;/code&gt;. ''Not the empty list!''. This is a list containing an empty list. The list itself is not empty, because it has one element!
## &lt;code&gt;[[],[]]&lt;/code&gt;. This is a list containing two empty lists.
## &lt;code&gt;[[1],[]]&lt;/code&gt;. This is the same list as the previous, but with a &lt;code&gt;[1]&lt;/code&gt; as the first element instead of &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt;. Since the list was a lists of lists, it now has become a list of integers.
## &lt;code&gt;[[&quot;hi&quot;], [1]]&lt;/code&gt;. [&quot;hi&quot;] is a list of Chars while [1] is a list of integers.
# Yes, this is possible. For example: &lt;code&gt;[[[1],[2],[3]],[[4],[5],[6]],[[7],[8],[9]]]&lt;/code&gt;. Why? You can make a list of ''anything''! If you already have a list of some type, then you can make a list of lists of that type. The example list would be written as: &lt;code&gt;((1:[]):(2:[]):(3:[]):[]):((4:[]):(5:[]):(6:[]):[]):((7:[]):(8:[]):(9:[]):[]):[]&lt;/code&gt;
# The list &lt;code&gt;[[1,2],3,[4,5]]&lt;/code&gt; is not valid because it is equivalent to &lt;code&gt;(1:2:[]):3:(4:5:[]):[]&lt;/code&gt;, where we try to cons elements that have different types (i.e. list and numeric). Lists in Haskell must be type-homogeneous. A valid list would be &lt;code&gt;[[1,2],[3],[4,5]]&lt;/code&gt;, equivalent to &lt;code&gt;(1:2:[]):(3:[]):(4:5:[]):[]&lt;/code&gt;.

====A different notion of many====

{{Exercises|
# Write down the 3-tuple whose first element is 4, second element is &quot;hello&quot; and third element is True.
# Which of the following are valid tuples ?
## &lt;code&gt;(4, 4)&lt;/code&gt;
## &lt;code&gt;(4, &quot;hello&quot;)&lt;/code&gt;
## &lt;code&gt;(True, &quot;Blah&quot;, &quot;foo&quot;)&lt;/code&gt;
# Lists can be built by consing new elements onto them: you cons a number onto a list of numbers, and get back a list of numbers. It turns out that there is no such way to build up tuples.
## Why do you think that is?
## Say for the sake of argument, that there was such a function. What would you get if you &quot;consed&quot; something on a tuple?
}}

# &lt;code&gt;(4,&quot;hello&quot;,True)&lt;/code&gt;
# They all are! Tuples aren't restricted to types.
## A tuple of two integers.
## A tuple of an integer and a string.
## A tuple of a boolean and two strings.
# 
## A tuple like &lt;code&gt;(&quot;hello&quot;,True)&lt;/code&gt; is fundamentally different from a tuple like &lt;code&gt;(3,&quot;hello&quot;,True)&lt;/code&gt;. A list with two elements is a list, just like a list with three elements.
## Unlike lists, we would obtain a tuple with a different type, because the tuple size would be bigger.

====Tuples within lists and other combinations====

{{Exercises|1=
# Which of these are valid Haskell, and why?
#* &lt;code&gt;1:(2,3)&lt;/code&gt;
#* &lt;code&gt;(2,4):(2,3)&lt;/code&gt;
#* &lt;code&gt;(2,4):[]&lt;/code&gt;
#* &lt;code&gt;[(2,4),(5,5),('a','b')]&lt;/code&gt;
#* &lt;code&gt;([2,4],[2,2])&lt;/code&gt;
}}

#
#* Not valid. &lt;code&gt;(2,3)&lt;/code&gt; is a tuple, and cons, &lt;code&gt;(:)&lt;/code&gt;, only works with lists.
#* Not valid. &lt;code&gt;(2,3)&lt;/code&gt; is a tuple, and cons, &lt;code&gt;(:)&lt;/code&gt;, only works with lists.
#* Valid. You'll get a list of tuples of an integer and an integer: &lt;code&gt;[(2,4)]&lt;/code&gt;
#* Not valid. All elements of a list must be of the same type. &lt;code&gt;(2,4)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;(5,5)&lt;/code&gt; are tuples of an integer and an integer, but &lt;code&gt;('a','b')&lt;/code&gt; is a tuple of a character and a character.
#* Valid. This is a tuple of a list of integers and a list of integers.

====Retrieving values====

{{Exercises|
# Use a combination of &lt;code&gt;fst&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;snd&lt;/code&gt; to extract the 4 from the tuple &lt;code&gt;((&quot;Hello&quot;, 4), True)&lt;/code&gt;.
# Normal chess notation is somewhat different to ours: it numbers the rows from 1-8 and the columns a-h; and the column label is customarily given first. Could we label a specific point with a character and a number, like &lt;code&gt;('a', 4)&lt;/code&gt;? What important difference with lists does this illustrate?
# Write a function which returns the head and the tail of a list as the first and second elements of a tuple.
# Use &lt;code&gt;head&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;tail&lt;/code&gt; to write a function which gives the fifth element of a list. Then, make a critique of it, pointing out any annoyances and pitfalls you can identify.
}}

# &lt;code&gt;snd (fst ((&quot;Hello&quot;, 4), True))&lt;/code&gt; returns &lt;code&gt;4&lt;/code&gt;.
# Yes, we can! The difference between a tuple and a list is that all elements of a list must be of the same type (integers, booleans, etc.), but you can add elements to the list. The elements of a tuple can be of any type you want, like a tuple of an integer and a character in &lt;code&gt;(4, 'a')&lt;/code&gt;, but you can't change its size.
# &lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
headAndTail list = (head list, tail list)
&lt;/source&gt;
# &lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
fifthElement list = head (tail (tail (tail (tail list))))
&lt;/source&gt; Inconveniences of this implementation include the clunkiness of the definition, its lack of generality (what if we wanted to get the fourth or the sixth or the ''nineteenth'' element?), and the fact it will cause the program to crash whenever it is passed a list with less than five elements.

== Polymorphic types ==

{{Exercises|
Give type signatures for the following functions:
# The solution to the third exercise of the previous section (&quot;... a function which returns the head and the tail of a list as the first and second elements of a tuple&quot;).
# The solution to the fourth exercise of the previous section (&quot;... a function which gives the fifth element of a list&quot;).
# &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;h x y z = chr (x - 2)&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; (remember we discussed chr in the previous chapter).
}}

# &lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
headAndTail :: [a] -&gt; (a, [a])
&lt;/source&gt;
# &lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
fifthElement :: [a] -&gt; a
&lt;/source&gt;
# &lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
h x y z :: Int -&gt; a -&gt; b -&gt; Char -- y and z are not actually used, so their types could be anything
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">We have usually used cartesian co-ordinates(x,y).Polar coordinates are an alternative system which can describe position of a point.In polar co-ordinates any point can be described in terms of its distance and direction from a fixed point O.

Each point ''P'' in the plane is assigned polar coordinationates according to the following rules:&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'''r''' is the directed distance from ''O'' to ''P''.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'''θ''' is the directed angle between the polar axis (usually a ray from point ''O'' to the east) to the line ''OP''.

== Introducing pattern matching ==

{{Exercises|1=
We cheated a little when moving from the second version of &lt;code&gt;pts&lt;/code&gt; to the third one: they do not do exactly the same thing. Can you spot what the difference is?
}}

The difference is what happens when the argument is smaller than &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;. In both the second and the third versions, they will be matched only on the final cases (by the catch-all patterns &lt;code&gt;_&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;, respectively). In the second version, the final case evaluates to &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; at once. In the third version, however, there is also the &lt;code&gt;x &lt;= 6&lt;/code&gt; guard, which is evidently true when the argument is less than &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;; and thus the result will be &lt;code&gt;7 - x&lt;/code&gt;. Thus, &lt;code&gt;pts (-4)&lt;/code&gt; for instance evaluates to &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; with the second version but to &lt;code&gt;11&lt;/code&gt; with the third version. 

N.B.: In a footnote to the text we claimed that for this example we wouldn't be too worried about what should happen if &lt;code&gt;pts&lt;/code&gt; was given nonsensical inputs; still, corner cases like this are the sort of issue that tends to trip us up when writing &quot;real&quot; code. In other words: it might make a difference in ''your'' program, so stay alert.

Here is a variation of the third version which is exactly equivalent to the second one:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
pts :: Int -&gt; Int
pts 1 = 10
pts 2 = 6
pts x
    | x &lt; 1 || x &gt; 7 = 0
    | otherwise      = 7 - x
&lt;/source&gt;

# Try using &lt;code&gt;:type&lt;/code&gt; on the literal value &lt;code&gt;&quot;H&quot;&lt;/code&gt; (notice the double quotes). What happens? Why?
# Try using &lt;code&gt;:type&lt;/code&gt; on the literal value &lt;code&gt;'Hello World'&lt;/code&gt; (notice the single quotes). What happens? Why?}}

# &quot;H&quot; is a &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; with just one element.
# 'Hello World' is invalid because &lt;code&gt;Char&lt;/code&gt;s consist of only one character.

{{Exercises|
Finding types for functions is a basic Haskell skill that you should become very familiar with. What are the types of the following functions?

# The &lt;code&gt;negate&lt;/code&gt; function, which takes an Int and returns that Int with its sign swapped. For example, &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;negate 4 = -4&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;negate (-2) = 2&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; &lt;!-- work around buggy MediaWiki parsing --&gt;
# The &lt;code&gt;({{!}}{{!}})&lt;/code&gt; function, pronounced 'or', that takes two Bools and returns a third Bool which is True if either of the arguments are True, and False otherwise. &lt;!-- more MediaWiki badness --&gt;
# A &lt;code&gt;monthLength&lt;/code&gt; function which takes a Bool which is True if we are considering a leap year and False otherwise, and an Int which is the number of a month; and returns another Int which is the number of days in that month.

For any functions hereafter involving numbers, you can just assume the numbers are Ints.

# &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;f x y = not x &amp;&amp; y&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
# &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;g x = (2*x - 1)^2&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
}}

# &lt;code&gt;negate :: Int -&gt; Int&lt;/code&gt;
# &lt;code&gt;{{!}}{{!}} :: Bool -&gt; Bool -&gt; Bool&lt;/code&gt;
# &lt;code&gt;monthLength :: Bool -&gt; Int -&gt; Int&lt;/code&gt;

And in the second round:

# &lt;code&gt;f :: Bool -&gt; Bool -&gt; Bool&lt;/code&gt;
# &lt;code&gt;g :: Int -&gt; Int&lt;/code&gt;

====The factorial function====

{{Exercises|1=
# Type the factorial function into a Haskell source file and load it into GHCi.
#* Try examples like &lt;code&gt;factorial 5&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;factorial 1000&lt;/code&gt;.
#* What about &lt;code&gt;factorial (-1)&lt;/code&gt;?  Why does this happen?
# The ''double factorial'' of a number n is the product of ''every other'' number from 1 (or 2) up to n.  For example, the double factorial of 8 is 8 × 6 × 4 × 2 = 384, and the double factorial of 7 is 7 × 5 × 3 × 1 = 105.  Define a &lt;code&gt;doublefactorial&lt;/code&gt; function in Haskell.
}}

# Typing &lt;code&gt;factorial (-1)&lt;/code&gt; should yield the message &lt;code&gt;*** Exception: stack overflow&lt;/code&gt;.  This is because, according to the definition, &lt;code&gt;factorial (-1)&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;(-1) * factorial (-2)&lt;/code&gt;, which is &lt;code&gt;(-1) * (-2) * factorial (-3)&lt;/code&gt;, which is... obviously, this never stops, so it will keep going until it runs out of memory.
# &lt;code&gt;doublefactorial&lt;/code&gt; can be defined as follows:
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
doublefactorial 0 = 1
doublefactorial 1 = 1
doublefactorial n = n * doublefactorial (n-2)
&lt;/source&gt;

====Other recursive functions====

{{Exercises|1=
# Expand out the multiplication 5 × 4 similarly to the expansion we used above for &lt;code&gt;factorial 3&lt;/code&gt;.
# Define a recursive function &lt;code&gt;power&lt;/code&gt; such that &lt;code&gt;power x y&lt;/code&gt; raises &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; to the &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; power.
# You are given a function &lt;code&gt;plusOne x = x + 1&lt;/code&gt;.  Without using any other &lt;code&gt;(+)&lt;/code&gt;s, define a recursive function &lt;code&gt;addition&lt;/code&gt; such that &lt;code&gt;addition x y&lt;/code&gt; adds &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; together.
# (Harder) Implement the function &lt;code&gt;log2&lt;/code&gt;, which computes the integer log (base 2) of its argument.  That is, &lt;code&gt;log2&lt;/code&gt; computes the exponent of the largest power of 2 which is less than or equal to its argument.  For example, &lt;code&gt;log2 16 = 4&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;log2 11 = 3&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;log2 1 = 0&lt;/code&gt;. (Small hint: read the last phrase of the paragraph immediately preceding these exercises.)
}}

1. 5 × 4:
:* 4 isn't 1, so we recurse: work out 5 × 3
::* 3 isn't 1, so we recurse
:::* 2 isn't 1, so we recurse
::::* 1 is 1, so we return 5
:::* We add the current number, 5, to the result of the recursion, 5. We get 10
::* We add the current number, 5, to the result of the recursion, 10. We get 15
:* We add the current number, 5, to the result of the recursion, 15. We get 20.

2.
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
power x 0 = 1
power x y = x * power x (y-1)
&lt;/source&gt;

3.
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
addition x 0 = x
addition x y = plusOne (addition x (y-1))
&lt;/source&gt;

4.
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
log2 1 = 0
log2 n = 1 + log2 (n `div` 2) -- the &quot;`&quot; make div into infix notation
&lt;/source&gt;

====List-based recursion====

{{Exercises|1=
Give recursive definitions for the following list-based functions. In each case, think what the base case would be, then think what the general case would look like, in terms of everything smaller than it.
# &lt;code&gt;replicate :: Int -&gt; a -&gt; [a]&lt;/code&gt;, which takes an element and a count and returns the list which is that element repeated that many times. E.g. &lt;code&gt;replicat 3 'a' = &quot;aaa&quot;&lt;/code&gt;. (Hint: think about what replicate of anything with a count of 0 should be; a count of 0 is your 'base case'.)
# &lt;code&gt;(!!) :: [a] -&gt; Int -&gt; a&lt;/code&gt;, which returns the element at the given 'index'. The first element is at index 0, the second at index 1, and so on. Note that with this function, you're recurring ''both'' numerically and down a list.
# (A bit harder.) &lt;code&gt;zip :: [a] -&gt; [b] -&gt; [(a, b)]&lt;/code&gt;, which takes two lists and 'zips' them together, so that the first pair in the resulting list is the first two elements of the two lists, and so on. E.g. &lt;code&gt;zip [1,2,3] &quot;abc&quot; = [(1, 'a'), (2, 'b'), (3, 'c')]&lt;/code&gt;. If either of the lists is shorter than the other, you can stop once either list runs out. E.g. &lt;code&gt;zip [1,2] &quot;abc&quot; = [(1, 'a'), (2, 'b')]&lt;/code&gt;.
}}

The answers, in one block of code:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
replicat 0 _     = []
replicat n thing = thing : replicat (n-1) thing

[]     !! _ = error &quot;Index too large&quot; -- An empty list has no elements.
(x:_)  !! 0 = x
(x:xs) !! n = xs !! (n-1)

zip []     _      = []
zip _      []     = []
zip (x:xs) (y:ys) = (x,y) : zip xs ys
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;(x:xs)&lt;/code&gt; does not match on an empty list so you can also have

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
zip (x:xs) (y:ys) = (x,y) : zip xs ys
zip _      _      = []
&lt;/source&gt;

'''Kipspek''', which literally translates into &quot;chickenbacon&quot; is a very easy snack that they used to make in the restaurant my mother managed.

==Ingredients==

* 1 or 2 [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken breasts]] (cubed)
* [[Cookbook:Bacon|bacon]] (in strips)
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* [[Cookbook:Pepper|black pepper]]
* 1 or 2 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]
* [[Cookbook:Bread Crumb|breadcrumbs]] (These breadcrumbs should be very fine, almost like a powder)
* Toothpicks
* [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]]

==Procedure==
# Put some salt and black pepper on the chicken so that it has some flavor.
# Take the strips of bacon and wrap the each cube of chicken into a separate strip.
# To make sure the bacon doesn't roll of the chicken, stick a toothpick from one end to the other.
# Roll the kipspek in the breadcrumbs.
# Whisk the egg(s) and for every kipspek, drop it in the egg quickly and take it out.
# Roll the kipspek through the breadcrumbs once again.
# leave them for about half an hour.
# heat the oil in a frying pot.
# Fry the kipspeks until they're golden brown. 
# Serve with ketchup or mustard

Don't forget to remove the toothpick before taking a bite.

Enjoy

      <comment>more random ranting. Am I getting ahead of myself, talking about stuff that really needs to go in some other chapter?</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Microprocessor Design}}

= Performance Metrics =

Performance metrics are measurements of a microprocessor that help to determine how well a microprocessor performs.

For many years, computers were excruciatingly slow.
Much time and effort were dedicated to finding ways of getting typical batch programs to run faster -- to reduce runtime or, in other words, to improve throughput.
In the process, many other things were sacrificed.

== Runtime ==

Runtime is the time it takes to run a program.

We will discuss some of the subtleties of accurately measuring runtime in a later [[Microprocessor Design/Benchmarking|Benchmarking]] section.

For now, let us note that, for any program running on any computer,

time per program = clock period * cycles per instruction * instructions executed per program

You see there are 3 different factors involved in the total time.
If you can reduce any one of those factors, then the time will be shorter, making your users happier.

Alas, all too often attempts at making one factor shorter result in making some other factor larger.
Sometimes a CPU designer will focusing on only one factor, trying to make it as small as possible, and hoping that the resulting increases in the other factors will be small enough that there is still a net improvement.

=== Clock rate ===

Clock rate (often called &quot;clock speed&quot;) is one of the easiest to measure performance metrics, and the most over-emphasized.

As of 2008, clock rate of most CPUs is measured in MHz.
A typical FPGA soft processor runs at about 10 MHz (a clock period of 100 ns), but later in this book we will explain techniques for increasing the clock rate of a FPGA soft processor to over 100 MHz (a clock period of less than 10 ns).

=== Cycles per Instruction ===

Historically, all early computers used many clock cycles during the execution of even the simplest instruction.
During the RISC revolution, many designers focused on reducing this factor closer to the apparent minimum of 1 cycle per instruction.
We will discuss some of the techniques used later in this book.
Since then, CPUs that use techniques such as superscalar execution and multicore computing have reduced this even further.
Such CPUs can (on average) use less than 1 cycle per instruction.

&quot;CPI&quot; is a throughput measure of how many instructions are completed (on average) for a given number of clocks.
A CPU that can complete, on average, 2 instructions per cycle (a CPI of 0.5) may have a 20 stage pipeline, which inevitably causes a 20 cycle latency between an instruction fetch to the completion of that instruction.
We ignore those 20 cycles when we calculate CPI.

=== instructions executed per program ===

If the program you need to run is a binary executable, this number can't be changed.

However, some CPU designers have the freedom of designing a new instruction set (or at least adding a few instructions to an old instruction set).

Early CPU designers attempted to reduce this number by adding new, more complicated instructions, that did more work. (Later this idea was retroactively called &quot;CISC&quot;).
When a given program (perhaps a benchmark program) is re-compiled for this new instruction set and executed, it requires fewer total executed instructions to finish.
Alas, these more complicated instructions often require more cycles to execute -- or worse, a longer clock period, which slows down every instruction -- so the net benefit was not as great as was hoped.
In a surprising number of cases, such &quot;RICH&quot; instructions actually made the runtime worse (longer).
Benchmarking is required to see if such changes to the instruction set are worthwhile.

Some examples where it did turn out to be worthwhile:

More complicated instructions that do more work include the &quot;load multiple&quot; and &quot;store multiple&quot; instructions of the ARM processors, the &quot;multimedia extensions&quot; of other processors, the MAC instructions used by most DSPs, etc.

Sometimes a CPU can be tweaked in ways that fewer instructions need to be executed in a program, without adding complexity -- the &quot;every instruction is conditional&quot; technique used by ARM processors (the &quot;conditional logic&quot; was needed anyway for conditional branches); the &quot;add more registers&quot; and &quot;register windowing&quot; ideas, each of which attempts to reduce the number of register spill/reload instructions; widening the width of the data bus, so more data can be transferred per &quot;load&quot; or &quot;store&quot; instruction (also enabling wider instructions); etc.

There are a few chips that do things in a few cycles of a single &quot;instruction&quot; that any von Neumann CPU would require hundreds of cycles to implement -- such as content-addressible RAM.

== Processor Time ==

== MIPS/$ ==

When building a computer cluster, the raw MIPS of any one chip is irrelevant.
When someone needs a teraflop of performance, no one chip can do it.
The person is forced to keep adding CPUs until he gets the performance he wants.
There are many tricks (that we will discuss later) that slightly reduce the runtime of one program on one CPU, but make that CPU much more expensive.
Rather than build a teraflop system out of a few of the lowest-runtime chips, usually people build such a system out of CPUs that take slightly longer to perform any particular task, but then these people simply use a lot more of them.

In such systems is useful if the CPUs are specifically designed to coordinate their work and synchronize rapidly.

== Latency ==

In hard real-time systems, low latency is critical.

== MIPS/mW ==

&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.ifp.uiuc.edu/~jones/RISCvCISCvDSP.pdf &quot;CISC, RISC, and DSP Microprocessors&quot;]
by Douglas L. Jones 2000
&quot;Most quoted numbers for DSP uPs not MIPS, but MIPS/$$, MIPS/mW&quot;
&quot;Why have RISC/CISC converged?&quot;
&lt;/ref&gt;

Most CPUs in mobile electronics -- PDAs, cell phones, laptops, wireless keyboards, MP3 players, etc. -- are underclocked.

Why do people deliberately clock them at a rate far below their potential runtime performance?
Because clocking them any faster squanders battery life.

Every clock tick to a particular CPU uses up (approximately) some fixed amount of energy.
If it takes (hypothetically) 900,000 clock ticks on that CPU to decode one second worth of MP3, then we maximize battery life by clocking the CPU at 0.9 MHz while playing MP3s.

Say we have some other CPU that requires 4,000,000 clock ticks to decode one second worth of MP3.
Which CPU should we use?
The absolute fastest MIPS rating at the maximum speed is irrelevant. The &quot;clock ticks required to decode one second worth of MP3&quot; is irrelevant.
The better CPU for a MP3 player is the one that gives the maximum battery life, assuming we are smart enough to underclock each CPU to give its maximum battery life.
Or in other words (since the amount of &quot;work&quot; done decoding an MP3 is fixed, and the amount of energy stored in a battery is fixed), the better CPU is the one with more MIPS/mW.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Summary ==
Illustration of a statocystgravity receptor, a common equilibrium organ of invertebrates. A fluid-filled vesicle lined with mechanoreceptors (hair cells) encloses one of more dense objects (eg. sandy or stone-like elements) - the statoliths. As gravity pulls these objects down, activity of sensory cells below them increases when their cilia are sheared. From this, the central nervous system can extract information about the direction of gravitational pull. When the animal molts it loses the lining of the statocyst and with it the sand grains. After molting the animal rebuilds the otoliths with surrounding materials.

Team members can comment on this page about daily learning experiences.  
*[[/Final Cut Pro now does blending effect just like Photoshop!/]]

This is an example of what Don Eland learned today.  Leave your comments along with mine.  Explain what you learned, why it's important to you and, perhaps some suggestion s about how classmates can use what you've learned.

== Restructuring ==

As a follow-up to the [[WB:RFD|RFD]], which this book survived, I wanted to make a few quick comments about how to make this a proper textbook. You need to make sure that this book has no [[WB:OR|original research]] - that is, you can't have opinions; everything must be [[Wikibooks:Original research#Verifiable information|verifiable]]. Be careful not to [[WB:BLOG|blog]].
Finally, I'd like to remind you that images must have the appropriate license template(s), or they will be deleted. If you want expansion on any of these issues, just ask at my talk page.

Hi there, and welcome to Wikibooks! Thanks for your recent interest in the Astronomy book. I hope I'll see a lot of you around. I'm happy to help if you have any questions. [[User:Brian Brondel|Brian]] 06:21, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

:By the way, please use &lt;nowiki&gt;===subsections===&lt;/nowiki&gt; rather than &lt;nowiki&gt;==sections==&lt;/nowiki&gt; when writing in [[Astronomy]]. The chapter views (such as [[Astronomy/The Modern View of the Cosmos|The Modern View of the Cosmos]]) are generated automatically from the individual sections (such as [[Astronomy/The Big Picture|The Big Picture]]). Using &lt;nowiki&gt;==sections==&lt;/nowiki&gt; within an individual section module will break the formatting. Thanks! [[User:Brian Brondel|Brian]] 06:44, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</text>

Hi AiClassEland,

I saw your message to Mike and figured I'd give a crack at answering this. There is a tool called &quot;recentchangeslinked&quot; which may be useful to you, it lists all the recent edits on a particular wikibook, [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Special:Recentchangeslinked/Future_Media this one is for Future Media] and [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Special:Recentchangeslinked/Advanced_Interactive_Media this one for Advanced Interactive Media]. Hope this helps!

Oh, and it's helpful to us if you sign your posts with four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt; like this: ~~~~ &lt;/nowiki&gt;) so we see your username. Regards. [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] &lt;small&gt; ([[User talk:Mattb112885|talk to me]]) &lt;/small&gt; 22:19, 10 February 2008 (UTC)

Hello, I'm interested in contributing to this topic. 

I am very new to editing on both Wikipedia and WikiBooks, so perhaps I'll stick with Wikipedia for awhile. However, I will have some theory or opinion and I wonder if it might be appropriate to express that here rather than there. 

I am right now specifically interested in the history of web series, viral video and interactive creative collaboration used in connection with that, since 1996.

For now, I'll read policies, but if you can give me any steering as regards to topics or whether I should start a new one or contribute to this one, I'd be grateful.

== What is Free Direct Instruction Science K (Free DI Science K) File:25%.svg ==

Free DI Science K is the parent or teacher's guide for teaching science at the kindergarten level depending on ability of learner and state standards.

Each section is numbered and can be taught in one day. Each section also contains scripted instructions for the teacher. Most sections contain workbook pages, images, and/and video clips.

Short video clips {{ref|WindowsonScience Windows on Science}} (5 to 20 seconds) can be added to integrate current events into the curriculum.  For instance, the idea of science is to  ask questions and get answers.  Could there be life on Mars?  To answer that we sent rockets and rovers to Mars to get pictures and samples of the surface.  You can show video clips, often free from NASA, a government agency, that shows rover taking samples.

Also, pictures can be added to enhance and describe scientific ideas, experiments, or events.
 
== What order do I teach this in? ==
Each state has different standards that include subject matter to be taught at specific times.  This makes teaching this science module more difficult. It might be a good idea to align your state standards to this curriculum and make some modifications.  Please make a note of your state standards and it's alignment to this program in the talk section (discussion tab).

== What is Free Direct Instruction Science 2 (Free DI Science 2) Image:25%.svg ==

Free DI Science 2 is the teacher's guide for teaching science at the second or third grade level depending on ability of learner and state standards.

Each section is numbered and can be taught in one day. Each section also contains scripted instructions for the teacher. Most sections contain workbook pages, images, and/and video clips.

Short video clips (5 to 20 seconds) can be added to integrate current events into the curriculum.  For instance, the idea of science is to  ask questions and get answers.

It might be a good idea to align your state standards to this curriculum and make some modifications.  Please make a note of your state standards and it's alignment to this program in the talk section (discussion tab).

==Physical Science==
===Understand structure and properties of matter.===
*Texture and weight of objects

===Chemical &amp; Physical Changes===
*Changes to shapes of objects
*Water can be liquid or sold.  Same amount of water whether liquid or ice.

===Force===
*Understand that a push or pull is needed to change the motion of an object - activities where getting things to move or not to move and in changing the direction or speed of things that are already in motion
*Magnets can be used to make things move without touching them (homemade compass?)

===Energy - interactions &amp; transformations===
*Energy forms of heat, light electricity, magnetic, chemical energies
*Sun warms land, air, water (arctic vs equator, tilt of sun, more plants at equator)

==Life Sciences==
===Organisms: Understand the characteristics, structure, and functions of organisms===
*Sort and classify objects according to their physical characteristics (hairy, smooth, with a nose, hard)
*Know that the senses can warn the individuals about danger; muscles help them to fight, hide, or get out of danger. (2061 says good luck getting them to understand)
*Understand that the human body has parts that help it seek, find, and take in food when it feels hunger (eyes &amp; nose for finding food, legs to get there, arms to carry it away, mouth to eat)
*Living vs nonliving things
*Living things have structures to help them survive

===Heredity: traits in living things, things are passed on===
*Variations within same population
*Living things have life cycles
*Order and label parts of a cycle

===Diversity/interdependence===
*Animals eat plants and animals
*Animals may even use plants or animals for shelter or nesting
*External features of plants and animals might help them survive or thrive in different places

==Earth Science==
===Earth materials===
*Rocks are in different shapes and sizes (boulder, sand, smaller (sediment?))
*Materials can be used again (recycled)
*Water can be liquid or solid and go back and forth (video of melting mountain snow, glaciers melting)
*Seasons with different temperatures, sky cover, and rains

==Space Science==
===Earth in solar system &amp; universe - Earth, sun, moon, and solar system===
*Things far away in the sky look like they move slow
*Moon cycle - looks different each day but every 28 days it is full (calendar with moon phases)

==Scientific Inquiry==
===Ask questions and get answers based on observations - hypothesis===
*Raise questions about the world around the students, try to get answers with observations
*Make prediction
*Describe things in terms of their number, shape, size, color, texture, weight, motion
*Make observations

===Design investigation to answer question===
*Help design steps to answer question (worksheets with scenarios - if I heat up some water in a pan for too long, what will happen to the water?)

===Collect and present data===
*Observe changes in world
*Describe or draw simple observations
*Record data on form
*Transfer from form to simple graphs

===Analyze and interpret data===
*Look at graph and describe what happened
*Answer questions from looking at a chart or graph
*Summarize data from chart or graph

==Concepts==
*May not work if parts are missing (batteries)
*Models might be different but can help learn about the real thing
*Observe and make note of change over time
*Predict events - some can be predicted.  Variables might change things so it might be hard to predict

==Math Facts Worksheets==
*[[/Addition/]]
*[[/Multiplication/]]

==Directions==
[[Image:Information icon.svg|15px]] '''Info:'''Present one to three lines as follows:
&quot;When I give a problem, you give me the answer.  One times two.  What's the answer?&quot;  
If you hear any student give the wrong answer, immediately correct the answer and repeat the question. Then go back 2 and start again.

Present the worksheet.  

One student has the worksheet and another has the answers.  

Ensure students can write 40 answers per minute.  If a student is suspected of having motor issues, test the student's handwriting.  Ensure the student can write 40 numbers (one and two digit) in one minute. If not, it might be better to have students practice by saying the entire problem and answer.  

Have students work for 2 minutes or until they have finished the practice session.  Then do the timing for one minute (40 correct problems).  If students are able to do the practice without many mistakes but are unable to do 40 problems in one minute, then break up the timings into 15 second sessions.  Do 15 second sessions until student is able to do 30 second sessions, then build to 45 second sessions, then one minute.  Build slowly.  Do not repeat the same timings in one session more than twice.  If the student is able to pass all four subsections with 15 second timings, test for the 30 second timing.  If the student cannot pass the 30 second timing, move on and consider it passed.  Don't bore the student.  Students should be able to pass within 1 or 2 test tries.  If the student continues to fail the test, go back to the practice and ensure the correction procedures are being done.  The student might be learning one or math facts wrong by practicing those wrong.

During practice, ensure the correction procedure is done fully.  Correction procedure involves:
#The teacher or partner giving the correct answer
#The student repeating the full problem and answer correctly
#The student going back 1-3 problems
#If another incorrect answer is given during the correction procedure, start at number 1 and go back another 1-3 problems</text>

Have students work for 2 minutes or until they have finished the practice session.  Then do the timing for one minute (40 correct problems).  If students are able to do the practice without many mistakes but are unable to do 40 problems in one minute, then break up the timings into 15 second sessions.  Do 15 second sessions until student is able to do 30 second sessions, then build to 45 second sessions, then one minute.  Build slowly.  Do not repeat the same timings in one session more than twice.  If the student is able to pass all four subsections with 15 second timings, test for the 30 second timing.  If the student cannot pass the 30 second timing, move on and consider it passed.  Don't bore the student.  Students should be able to pass within 1 or 2 test tries.  If the student continues to fail the test, go back to the practice and ensure the correction procedures are being done.  The student might be learning one or math facts wrong by practicing those wrong.

During practice, ensure the correction procedure is done fully.  Correction procedure involves:
#The teacher or partner giving the correct answer
#The student repeating the full problem and answer correctly
#The student going back 1-3 problems
#If another incorrect answer is given during the correction procedure, do #1-3 and keep going.  It might feel

[[Image:Information icon.svg|15px]] '''Info:'''Present one to three lines as follows:
&quot;When I give a problem, you give me the answer.  One times two.  What's the answer?&quot;  
If you hear any student give the wrong answer, immediately correct the answer and repeat the question. Then go back 2 and start again.

Present the worksheet.  

One student has the worksheet and another has the answers.  

Ensure students can write 40 answers per minute.  If a student is suspected of having motor issues, test the student's handwriting.  Ensure the student can write 40 numbers (one and two digit) in one minute. If not, it might be better to have students practice by saying the entire problem and answer.  

Have students work for 2 minutes or until they have finished the practice session.  Then do the timing for one minute (40 correct problems).  If students are able to do the practice without many mistakes but are unable to do 40 problems in one minute, then break up the timings into 15 second sessions.  Do 15 second sessions until student is able to do 30 second sessions, then build to 45 second sessions, then one minute.  Build slowly.  Do not repeat the same timings in one session more than twice.  If the student is able to pass all four subsections with 15 second timings, test for the 30 second timing.  If the student cannot pass the 30 second timing, move on and consider it passed.  Don't bore the student.  Students should be able to pass within 1 or 2 test tries.  If the student continues to fail the test, go back to the practice and ensure the correction procedures are being done.  The student might be learning one or math facts wrong by practicing those wrong.

During practice, ensure the correction procedure is done fully.  Correction procedure involves:
#The teacher or partner giving the correct answer
#The student repeating the full problem and answer correctly
#The student going back 1-3 problems
#If another incorrect answer is given during the correction procedure, start at number 1 and go back another 1-3 problems

Astrobiology is a relatively young approach to the study of life in the universe, with earth forming the basis of our knowledge and investigation. Astrobiology seeks to address many questions, including:

1. Are there other forms of life in the universe?

2. Are we alone in the universe?

Very importantly, astrobiology transcends many scientific field boundaries and creates an amalgam of interdisciplinary topics, ranging from biology, geology, astronomy, chemistry to planetary sciences, paleontology and physics. Astrobiology covers a huge breadth of knowledge; therefore, only a selected overview of the difficulties of extraterrestrial life and of the possibility and search for life beyond earth is given below. Many of the postulations are inconclusive.

== '''Expected Restrictions &amp; Prerequisites for Both Terrestrial and Extraterrestrial Life''' ==


'''“Life-support”'''

- A source of energy such as from a nearby star is needed to drive endothermic, or energy-absorbing, reactions. 

- Raw materials, predominantly carbon, build and form organic molecules. Other important elements for life on earth include hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur (comprising the acronym SPONCH).

- Life requires some form of shielding from damaging radiation, implying the presence of an atmosphere. 

- Also indispensable is the presence of a liquid or very dense gas as a solvent for biochemical reactions to occur quickly and stably. Liquid water, the life-sustaining universal solvent (at least on earth), entails certain atmospheric composition and temperatures. 

- The characteristics of stars can also determine the capacity for life on surrounding, orbiting planetary bodies, namely through the location of the habitable zone. The habitable zone in a solar system is defined as the region around a star that is conducive to life, which usually implies regions with temperatures high enough to maintain liquid water. Earth falls under the habitable zone in our solar system. As the mass of a star increases, so does the distance of the habitable zone from the star. Also, stars hotter than the sun have habitable zones farther out while cooler stars have them closer in, but hotter stars produce excessively harmful ionizing UV radiation while cooler stars may “tidally lock” planets that are too close, meaning these planets will always show the same &quot;face&quot; to the star and hence have a very cold side and a very hot side. Stars both hotter and cooler than the sun therefore possess conditions hostile to life. The properties of a solar system’s star determine the likelihood of life’s existence on planets and/or moons. In turn, the planets and their moons' positioning relative to the habitable zone and to their star also influence their conduciveness to life. Locating habitable zones in the universe leads to discovering the possibility of life. However, the later-discussed planet Mars and moons in our solar system may shelter life even though they do not fall into the generally accepted habitable zone. 

The difficulty of life on other celestial bodies is marked by several conditions. The atmospheric pressure and composition vary immensely and gravity is altered across different regions in space; for instance, Mars has only a tenth of earth’s atmosphere, its atmosphere is mainly constituted of carbon dioxide, and its gravity is only a third of earth’s. All the planets and moons currently being explored for life also face different solar and cosmic radiation systems than the earth since the bodies are farther out in the solar system. Though they are farther from the sun and so experience less solar radiation, none has an ozone layer to protect against life-damaging radiation although some do have an adequate atmosphere to offer some protection. Moreover, oxidants such as iron oxide made by UV radiation acting on mineral surfaces in the presence of atmospheric oxygen and extremely dry conditions are chemically hostile to many organic compounds. Space is overall a very inhospitable, bleak place for life. It includes a space vacuum, solar winds with protons, electrons, and alpha particles floating around, radiation, solar flares, cosmic radiation, and low temperatures, factors counter to the nourishing conditions on earth. [1]

== '''Extremophiles and Their Role in Life Exploration''' ==


[[Image:Bacillus Subtilis.jpg|frame|Bacillus subtilis is one of the bacterial species that survived space exposure (in its resilient spore-form). ''Image courtesy of NASA.'']]
Though life seems only possible under specific conditions, extremophiles such as bacteria that live in high temperature, toxic, deep-sea hydrothermal volcanic vents on earth offer insight into life that could have developed on other planets that mostly share such extreme, inhospitable environments, which also can include freezing temperatures and minimal sun exposure. The range of conditions life here on earth has managed to flourish in reveals more outer space milieus as possible breeding grounds for life. A few species of halophilic or salt-loving bacteria have also been experimentally proven to survive exposure to the extreme space environment for about two weeks. This evidence inspires hope that life similar to earth’s extremophile microbes can exist in outer space on other planets or moons despite harsh conditions.

== '''Other Solar System Candidates for Life''' ==


'''Mars'''

In 1976, a search for microbial life on the red planet was performed. Two Viking landers conducted three experiments on Martian soil to test for bacteria presence through: 1) detecting the fixation of carbon dioxide, 2) observing possible metabolic processes through radiorespirometry, and 3) measuring the production and uptake of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, methane, hydrogen, and oxygen. Some tests yielded positive results: one experiment demonstrated that carbon was indeed converted to some organic matter by Martian soil, but the materials were not necessarily living or biological and the matter was not confirmed as organic. The 1997 Pathfinder mission discovered magnesium, aluminum, iron, and phosphate in Martian rocks, which are all possible life-supporting materials. Methane was also discovered in Mars’ atmosphere. Methane is important because it is a building block molecule for compounds such as hydrogen cyanide, which are important for amino acids, which are vital for life. However, no conclusive organic matter has been found on Mars’ terrain. 

Mars could have once had water but does not have any liquid water now because its air pressure is too low. Mars is also small, reducing its ability to retain a hold on its atmosphere and increasing the rate of heat loss, resulting in cold temperatures at -63 degrees Celsius, which further decreases the likelihood of surface liquid water significantly. [[Image:Mars_surface.gif|frame|Older landscape on Mars with numerous impact craters. Small channels indicate the possible presence of water in the past, which may have smoothed out the surface. ''Image courtesy of NASA.'']] Some tentative evidence for the presence of water (and consequently maybe even life) possibly hidden under ice exists. Ancient craters that seem to have been eroded by water dot Mars’ landscape. The presence of craters suggests low to nil tectonic activity; however, some areas on Mars were smoothed over, therefore suggesting water activity. Dry, river-like features on Mars may have also been carved out by running water over long periods of time. The same water in the form of huge floods may have caused the broad channels observable on the dry planet. 

Mars’ huge volcanoes such as Olympus Mons could contribute internal heat to sustain subsurface water. According to Bruce Jakosky, “there’s a possibility of hydrothermal vents [due to these volcanoes reminiscent of terrestrial extremophilic living conditions].” [2] Though carbon mostly as carbon dioxide, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen were also found in the Martian atmosphere, increasing the possibility of life on the planet, still, no definite life forms have been uncovered.

''Image courtesy of Cosmic Ancestry at panspermia.org'']]--&gt;The confirmed Martian Meteorite ALH84001 that hit and was recovered from Antarctica in 1984 could also shed light on the possibility of life on Mars. The meteorite consists of young, volcanic rocks with partially dissolved carbonate globules that indicate the infiltration of liquid water and with ancient fossilized bacteria-like objects about the size of viruses identified as nanobes. Nanobes have been hypothesized as the smallest life form and are filamental structures usually found in certain rocks and sediments. Magnetite and iron sulfide particles discovered in the meteorite could have been left behind by the bacteria, but compelling abiotic explanations do not allow them to coexist with partially dissolved carbonates. Furthermore, the apparent life forms may be contaminations from life on earth. All conclusions are tentative and heavily contested. 




'''Europa''' [[Image:Europa moon Voyager 2 closest approach.jpg|thumb|Photo of Europa's ice floes resembling those of earth's polar oceans taken by ''Galileo'' in 1996. ''Image courtesy of NASA.'']]

Europa is one of the four largest Jovian (Jupiter) moons found to be covered by a smooth layer of water-ice, suggesting a life-nurturing liquid ocean underneath global in extent. 
Though temperatures are a nippy -145 degrees Celsius, some possible factors may have kept the water from freezing. Tidal heating from friction due to Europa’s eccentric orbit around Jupiter has been proposed. The planet’s gravity pulls stronger on the near side than the far, creating tidal bulges that can crack the icy crust surface and heat the interior. Approximately 5-25 km thick ice sheets could also insulate the water beneath. Volcanoes deep down may harbor hydrothermal vents that provide an energy source to heat and maintain liquid water.  

Europa has a very smooth surface and very few craters, which could not be the result of an atmosphere burning up or the weathering of the craters since Europa’s atmosphere is very thin, so the tentative explanation is ice covering an ocean that evens out the surface. Some parts of its surface show blocks of ice that are separated but seem to fit together like a puzzle; these icebergs could have been shifted by slushy or liquid water beneath. Ridges in Europa’s landscape suggest existent water seeping up the ice cracks, refreezing, and then forming higher and higher ridges. In 1996, the Galileo spacecraft detected a magnetic field on the planet’s surface, indicating that there must be some electrical conduction likely to derive from a salty ocean. The previously mentioned hydrothermal vents may be spewing and mixing energy, heat, and chemicals into Europa’s ocean, possibly fostering life. The aforementioned tides on Europa created by Jupiter’s pull on its surface could also mix life-supporting substances together in the ocean.[[Image:PIA01295_modest.jpg‎|frame|Natural (left) and enhanced (right) images of Europa taken by ''Galileo'' in 1997. The whitish and bluish areas are thought to contain water ice. The brownish parts may be hydrated salts. The dark lines coursing across the moon's surface may be ice crust fractures. ''Image courtesy of NASA.'']]

About the possibility of life on Europa, when Jupiter strongly irradiates Europa’s ice, which is shown by the Galileo spacecraft’s observations to contain carbon dioxide, the irradiated carbon dioxide can produce simple organic molecules such as formaldehyde that are steps towards life. As one of the fundamental preconditions for life is a source of energy, tidal heating and the decay of radioactive elements could provide such energy for underwater life near the volcanic vents. Life-supporting energy can also be supplied by high-energy particles from Jupiter’s magnetic field breaking apart molecules in the ice to produce hydrogen peroxide, oxygen molecules and hydrogen. Finally, in Europa’s water-immersed rocks, there is evidence of life-forming elements like those on other solar system candidates for life.


'''Titan'''

Hazy, orange Titan is Saturn’s largest moon and is the only moon in the solar system that possesses clouds and a thick, dense atmosphere that is about 1.5 times the pressure of earth’s atmosphere. It also contains many organic gases such as methane, ethane, nitrogen, and hydrocarbons, and possesses conditions that resemble those of early earth four billion years ago that allowed life to develop. Extremely tall mountains cap Titan’s landscape and have been recently found to contain methane as well. Dark spots on the moon’s surface may reveal lakes of liquid organic materials including methane and/or ethane. [[Image:Titan_lake.jpg|frame|A supposed lake (dark splotches) on Titan's surface. Bright, white areas represent methane clouds. ''Image courtesy of NASA.'']]
The sun’s radiation reacts with atmospheric nitrogen and methane on the moon to produce the orange haze and a steady stream of organic substances such as black ethane that rains down from the sky, supplying more carbon-rich molecules that could generate life. The presence of methane gas in the air suggests that a localized reservoir of liquid methane and ethane slowly evaporates into gaseous form in the atmosphere. NASA Ames Research Center scientists believe that methane-producing microbes, methanogens, may flourish on Titan since the moon’s atmosphere and surrounding are so heavily saturated with the compound. However, liquid methane and ethane are much colder than liquid water by some 200 degrees Celsius and biochemical reactions would occur at painstakingly slow rates. These compounds are also far less capable as solvents compared to water and therefore much less life-inducing. Water is also missing from the picture due to freezing temperatures of -178 degrees Celsius. Long ago, Titan could have been warmer and had water and maybe even life. Water may still be under the presently icy and rocky surface, concealing signs of life.


'''Enceladus'''

Enceladus, another one of Saturn’s satellites, is currently the “search for life” priority hot-spot. Like Jupiter’s Europa, Enceladus has a very smooth, almost crater-free surface but which is caused by constant geological activities, which is characteristic of a relatively young planet or in this case, a moon associated with a planet. This inner, tiny moon of Saturn has a water vapor-based atmosphere and contains liquid water reservoirs approximately only a half kilometer beneath its icy south pole, implying a heat source originating from the south pole of the moon. Though general temperatures are well below freezing at -203 degrees Celsius, this south pole is actually a relative “hot spot” at -183 degrees Celsius. The south pole also has “tiger stripe” regions or cracks that are warmer spaces, signifying geothermal activity. 

Water vapor and ice crystal plumes also from the moon's south pole were found to contain organic materials such as carbon dioxide, methane, and propane. Such plumes also suggest an organic soup in the oceanic reservoir. Like Earth, Enceladus could have underwater hydrothermal vents near its water reservoirs that produce energy to heat the water. However, how this small moon can generate so much heat is still puzzling. Perhaps an insulating shell containing water ice with gas particles could aid the retention of heat. The pressurized liquid water could also fuel the geysers that spew icy water matter into space that dissociates into hydrogen and oxygen. [[File:Fountains of Enceladus PIA07758.jpg|250px|thumb|Enceladus' geysers spewing out icy material. It's incredibly macroscopic! ''Image courtesy of NASA.'']]
These geysers may be erupting from superficial liquid-water pockets at above 0 degrees Celsius. Liquid water so near the surface rarely occurs on the moon, introducing more questions and speculations about life on the mysterious, distant moon. Currently, the NASA Cassini spacecraft has been taking high resolution photographs of Enceladus and confirming numerous theories interpreting radical findings on Enceladus. The spacecraft is scheduled to fly close enough for observations of the geysers in October of 2008.


There may be many more planets and moons light-years away that are toeholds for life since we are turning up evidence for life on many planets and moons in our own neighborhood! Many of the diverse and often harsh planetary features discussed above that seem to suggest the existence of life broaden the conceptions and prospects of finding environments suitable for life throughout the universe, life not in the form of humanoid green-skinned Martians but of microbes perhaps distantly related to earth's extremophiles.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Overview==
Use the MATLAB Compiler to convert MATLAB programs to applications and libraries that you can distribute to end users who do not have MATLAB installed. You can compile M-files, MEX-files, or other MATLAB code. MATLAB Compiler supports all the features of MATLAB, including objects, private functions, and methods. Using MATLAB Compiler version before 3 you can generate

* Standalone C and C++ applications on UNIX, Windows, and Macintosh platforms.
* C and C++ shared libraries (dynamically linked libraries, or DLLs, on Microsoft Windows).

MATLAB Compiler version 4 no longer provides these capabilities on Windows and Linux and you can generate

* Standalone application on Linux and Windows based on Java/JIT methods
* Shared libraries on Linux and DLLs on Microsoft Windows

== How to Use ==

==Known Problems==
Matlab Compiler version 4.1, distributed with Matlab 7 (R14SP1) for Solaris has a bug in the buildmcr function.  This can be fixed by following these instructions:
* Quit MATLAB.

* Rename the following M-file:
   $MATLAB\toolbox\compiler\buildmcr.m
   (where $MATLAB is the MATLAB root directory on your machine, as returned by typing
   matlabroot
   at the MATLAB command prompt.)

Rename the file to buildmcr.m.old

* Download the following files from the MATLAB website:
**[http://www.mathworks.com/support/solutions/files/s1-SASO5/buildmcr.m buildmcr.m]
**[http://www.mathworks.com/support/solutions/files/s1-SASO5/ctfcreatezip.mexsol cftcreatezip.mexsol]

If for some reason you can't get the se files, get this fixed version of Buildmcr.m and this fixed version of ctfcreatezip.mexsol available as text and uuencoded text, respectively.

Place the new files in $MATLAB\toolbox\compiler.

* Restart MATLAB.

[[Category:{{FULLBOOKNAME}}|{{FULLCHAPTERNAME}}]]

Geo Trackers are exactly like Suzuki Sidekicks.  Repair is not difficult as there is ample room in the engine bay. A level B mechanic could shoot through these cars no problem.  The only maintenance that is necessary that is not listed is to inspect the ladder frame as some have a tendency to develop heavy rust at the welds.</text>

# Add a checkbox control. It doesn't have to do anything yet, just make sure it appears next to the staticText and the button when using row-layout, or below them when using column layout. &lt;tt&gt;text&lt;/tt&gt; is also an attribute of the checkbox.

# Can you figure out how the radiobox control works? Take the layout of the previous exercise and add a radiobox with two (or more) options below the checkbox, staticText and button. Use the documentation!
# Use the &lt;tt&gt;boxed&lt;/tt&gt; combinator to create a nice looking border around the four controls, and another one around the staticText and the button. (''Note: the &lt;tt&gt;boxed&lt;/tt&gt; combinator might not be working on MacOS X - you might get widgets that can't be interacted with.  This is likely just a bug in wxhaskell.'')}}


1. &lt;tt&gt;gui&lt;/tt&gt;-function with a checkbox, row layout. (replace &lt;tt&gt;row&lt;/tt&gt; with &lt;tt&gt;column&lt;/tt&gt; to get column layout)

 gui :: IO ()
 gui = do
   f &lt;- frame [ text := &quot;Hello World!&quot; ]
   st &lt;- staticText f [ text := &quot;Hello StaticText!&quot; ]
   b &lt;- button f [ text := &quot;Hello Button!&quot; ]
   cb &lt;- checkBox f [ text :=  &quot;Hello Checkbox!&quot; ]
   set f [ layout := row 5 [ widget st, widget b, widget cb ] ]

2. &lt;tt&gt;gui&lt;/tt&gt;-function with nested layout-combinators.

 gui :: IO ()
 gui = do
   f &lt;- frame [ text := &quot;Hello World!&quot; ]
   st &lt;- staticText f [ text := &quot;Hello StaticText!&quot; ]
   b &lt;- button f [ text := &quot;Hello Button!&quot; ]
   cb &lt;- checkBox f [ text := &quot;Hello Checkbox!&quot; ]
   set f [ layout := row 5
           [ widget cb
           , column 25
             [ widget st
             , widget b
             ]
           ]
         ]

3. &lt;tt&gt;gui&lt;/tt&gt;-function with a radiobox control. The documentation of the &lt;tt&gt;radioBox&lt;/tt&gt; function says ''Create a new radio button group with an initial orientation and a list of labels''. As can be seen on the documentation of &lt;tt&gt;Orientation&lt;/tt&gt;, it is either &lt;tt&gt;Horizontal&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;Vertical&lt;/tt&gt;. I'm using &lt;tt&gt;Vertical&lt;/tt&gt; here, but it doesn't matter.

 gui :: IO ()
 gui = do
   f &lt;- frame [ text := &quot;Hello World!&quot; ]
   st &lt;- staticText f [ text := &quot;Hello StaticText!&quot; ]
   b &lt;- button f [ text := &quot;Hello Button!&quot; ]
   cb &lt;- checkBox f [ text :=  &quot;Hello Checkbox!&quot; ]
   rb &lt;- radioBox f Vertical [&quot;Hello Option 1!&quot;, &quot;Hello Option 2!&quot; ] [ text := &quot;Hello Radiobox!&quot; ]
   set f [ layout := column 5
           [ row 5
             [ widget cb
             , column 25
               [ widget st
               , widget b
               ]
             ]
           , widget rb
           ]
         ]
   return ()

4. &lt;tt&gt;gui&lt;/tt&gt;-function for the complete layout as in the screenshot: [[Image:WxHaskell6_winxp.png|thumb|Final result (winxp)]]

 gui :: IO ()
 gui = do
   f &lt;- frame [ text := &quot;Hello World!&quot; ]
   st &lt;- staticText f [ text := &quot;Hello StaticText!&quot; ]
   b &lt;- button f [ text := &quot;Hello Button!&quot; ]
   cb &lt;- checkBox f [ text := &quot;Hello Checkbox!&quot; ]
   rb &lt;- radioBox f Vertical [&quot;Hello Option 1!&quot;, &quot;Hello Option 2!&quot; ] [ text := &quot;Hello Radiobox!&quot; ]
   set f [ layout := boxed &quot;Hello Box 1&quot; $ column 5
           [ row 5
             [ widget cb
             , boxed &quot;Hello Box 2&quot; $ column 25
               [ widget st
               , widget b
               ]
             ]
           , widget rb
           ]
         ]
   return ()</text>

The if-within-do problem has tripped up so many Haskellers, that one programmer has posted a [http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/haskell-prime/ticket/23 proposal] to the Haskell prime initiative to add optional semicolons between &lt;code&gt;if then else&lt;/code&gt;.  How would that fix the problem?}}

Then {if expr; then code; else other_code}, or

 if expr

* Lambdas are a nice way to avoid defining unnecessary separate functions. Convert the following let- or where-bindings to lambdas:
** &lt;code&gt;map f xs where f x = x * 2 + 3&lt;/code&gt;
** &lt;code&gt;let f x y = read x + y in foldr f 1 xs&lt;/code&gt;
* Sections are just syntactic sugar for lambda operations. I.e. &lt;code&gt;(+2)&lt;/code&gt; is equivalent to &lt;code&gt;\x -&gt; x + 2&lt;/code&gt;. What would the following sections 'desugar' to? What would be their types?
** &lt;code&gt;(4+)&lt;/code&gt;

==Folds==

{{Exercises|1=
#Define the following functions recursively (like the definitions for &lt;code&gt;sum&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;product&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;concat&lt;/code&gt; above), then turn them into a fold:
#* &lt;code&gt;and :: [Bool] -&gt; Bool&lt;/code&gt;, which returns True if a list of Bools are all True, and False otherwise.
#* &lt;code&gt;or :: [Bool] -&gt; Bool&lt;/code&gt;, which returns True if any of a list of Bools are True, and False otherwise.
#Define the following functions using &lt;code&gt;foldl1&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;foldr1&lt;/code&gt;:
#* &lt;code&gt;maximum :: Ord a =&gt; [a] -&gt; a&lt;/code&gt;, which returns the maximum element of a list (hint: &lt;code&gt;max :: Ord a =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a&lt;/code&gt; returns the maximum of two values).
#* &lt;code&gt;minimum :: Ord a =&gt; [a] -&gt; a&lt;/code&gt;, which returns the minimum element of a list (hint: &lt;code&gt;min :: Ord a =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a&lt;/code&gt; returns the minimum of two values).
#Use a fold (''which one?'') to define &lt;code&gt;reverse :: [a] -&gt; [a]&lt;/code&gt;, which returns a list with the elements in reverse order.

:Note that all of these are Prelude functions, so they will be always close at hand when you need them. (Also, that means you will want to use slightly different names for testing your answers in GHCi.) 
}}

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
and [] = True
and (x:xs) = x &amp;&amp; and xs

--As a fold
and = foldr (&amp;&amp;) True

or [] = False
or (x:xs) = x || or xs

--As a fold
or = foldr (||) False

maximum :: Ord a =&gt; [a] -&gt; a  -- omitting type declaration results in &quot;Ambiguous type variable&quot; error
maximum = foldr1 max --foldl1 also works, but not if you want infinite lists. Not that you can ever be sure of the maximum of an infinite list.
minimum :: Ord a =&gt; [a] -&gt; a
minimum = foldr1 min --Same as above.

--Using foldl'; you will want to import Data.List in order to do the same.
reverse :: [a] -&gt; [a]
reverse = foldl' flippedCons []
    where
    flippedCons xs x = x : xs 
&lt;/source&gt;

==Scans==
{{Exercises|1=
Write your own definition of &lt;code&gt;scanr&lt;/code&gt;, first using recursion, and then using &lt;code&gt;foldr&lt;/code&gt;. Do the same for &lt;code&gt;scanl&lt;/code&gt; first using recursion then &lt;code&gt;foldl&lt;/code&gt;. }}
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
-- with recursion
scanr2 step zero [] = [zero]
scanr2 step zero (x:xs) = (step x (head prev)):prev
  where prev = scanr2 step zero xs

scanl2 step zero [] = [zero]
scanl2 step zero (x:xs) = zero : scanl2 step (step zero x) xs

-- An alternative scanl with poorer performance. The problem is that
-- last and init, unlike head and tail, must run through the entire
-- list, and (++) does the same with its first argument.
scanl2Slow step zero [] = [zero]
scanl2Slow step zero xs = prev ++ (step (last prev) (last xs)):[]
  where prev = scanl2Slow step zero (init xs)

--with fold
scanr3 step zero xs = foldr step' [zero] xs
  where step' x xs = (step x (head xs)):xs

-- This implementation has poor performance due to (++), as explained
-- for scanl2Slow. In general, using (++) to append to a list
-- repeatdely is not a good idea.  
scanl3Slow step zero xs = foldl step' [zero] xs
  where step' xs x = xs ++ (step (last xs) x):[]
&lt;/source&gt;

{{Exercises|1=
Define the following functions:
*&lt;code&gt;factList :: Integer -&gt; [Integer]&lt;/code&gt;, which returns a list of factorials from 1 up to its argument.  For example, &lt;code&gt;facList 4 = [1,2,6,24]&lt;/code&gt;.
''More to be added''}}
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
factList n = scanl1 (*) [1..n]
factList' n = scanl (*) 1 [2..n]
&lt;/source&gt;

==filter and list comprehension==

{{Exercises|
Write a &lt;code&gt;returnDivisible :: Int -&gt; [Int] -&gt; [Int]&lt;/code&gt; function which filters a list of integers retaining only the numbers divisible by the integer passed as first argument. For integers x and n, x is divisible by n if &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;(mod x n) == 0&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; (note that the test for evenness is a specific case of that).
}}  
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
returnDivisible :: Int -&gt; [Int] -&gt; [Int]
returnDivisible n xs = [ x | x&lt;-xs , (mod x n) == 0 ]

--or, if you prefer to use filter...
returnDivisible :: Int -&gt; [Int] -&gt; [Int]
returnDivisible n = filter (\x -&gt; (mod x n) == 0)
&lt;/source&gt;

{{Exercises|
* Write - using list comprehension syntax, a single function definition (with ''no'' &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;case&lt;/tt&gt;, or similar constructs) a &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Int]] -&gt; [[Int]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; function which, takes a list of lists of &lt;tt&gt;Int&lt;/tt&gt; and returns a list of the tails of those lists using, as filtering condition, that the head of each &lt;tt&gt;[Int]&lt;/tt&gt; must be larger than 5. Also, your function must not trigger an error when it meets an empty &lt;tt&gt;[Int]&lt;/tt&gt;, so you'll need to add an additional test to detect emptiness.
* Does order matter when listing the conditions for list comprehension? (You can find it out by playing with the function you wrote for the first part of the exercise.)
}}

The extraneous constraints of the exercise lead to a solution which uses &lt;tt&gt;head&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;tail&lt;/tt&gt; instead of pattern matching.  

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
choosingTails :: [[Int]] -&gt; [[Int]]
choosingTails ls = [ tail l | l &lt;- ls, not (l == []), head l &gt; 5 ] 
&lt;/source&gt;
 
The boolean conditions in a list comprehension are evaluated in order, so if you swapped the conditions like this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt; 
choosingTails ls = [ tail l | l &lt;- ls, head l &gt; 5, not (l == []) ]
&lt;/source&gt;

if one of the &lt;tt&gt;l&lt;/tt&gt; turned out to be an empty list the program would try to apply head on it, which would cause an error. Putting &lt;tt&gt;not (l == [])&lt;/tt&gt; first causes the program to, when it meets an empty list, to short-circuit the conditional - that is, ignore the second condition since the first one being false is enough for rejecting the list - thus avoiding doing head [] and the error that follows.

{{Exercises|
Over this section we've seen how list comprehensions are essentially syntactic sugar for &lt;tt&gt;filter&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;map&lt;/tt&gt;. Now work in the opposite direction and define alternative versions of the &lt;tt&gt;filter&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;map&lt;/tt&gt; using the list comprehension syntax.
}}

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
alternativeFilter :: (a -&gt; Bool) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a]
alternativeFilter cond xs = [ x | x&lt;-xs, cond x ]

alternativeMap :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [b]
alternativeMap f xs = [ f x | x&lt;-xs ]
--no need for any condition, as all x will be accepted
&lt;/source&gt;

{{Exercises|
Rewrite &lt;tt&gt;doubleOfFirstForEvenSeconds&lt;/tt&gt; using &lt;tt&gt;filter&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;map&lt;/tt&gt; instead of list comprehension.
}}

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
doubleOfFirstForEvenSeconds' :: [(Int, Int)] -&gt; [Int]
doubleOfFirstForEvenSeconds ps =
    let f pair = 2 * (fst pair)
        g pair = isEven (snd pair)
    in map f (filter g ps)

--isEven, naturally, remains the same.
isEven :: Int -&gt; Bool
isEven n = (mod n 2 == 0)

-- a small teaser - using the (.) function composition operator which will be formally introduced on &quot;More on functions&quot;.
doubleOfFirstForEvenSeconds' :: [(Int, Int)] -&gt; [Int]
doubleOfFirstForEvenSeconds' ps = map ((2*) . fst) (filter (isEven . snd) ps)

==Rebuilding lists==

{{Exercises|1=
Write the following functions and test them out.  Don't forget the type signatures. 

# takeInt returns the first ''n'' items in a list.  So takeInt 4 [11,21,31,41,51,61] returns [11,21,31,41].
# dropInt drops the first ''n'' items in a list and returns the rest.  So dropInt 3 [11,21,31,41,51] returns [41,51].
# sumInt returns the sum of the items in a list.
# scanSum adds the items in a list and returns a list of the running totals.  So scanSum [2,3,4,5] returns [2,5,9,14].
# diffs returns a list of the differences between adjacent items.  So diffs [3,5,6,8] returns [2,1,2]. (Hints: one solution involves writing an auxiliary function which takes two lists and calculates the difference between corresponding elements. Alternatively, you might explore the fact that for lists with at least two elements can be matched to a &lt;code&gt;(x:y:ys)&lt;/code&gt; pattern.)
The first three functions are in Prelude, under the names &lt;code&gt;take&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;drop&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;sum&lt;/code&gt;.
}}

1. &lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;

dropInt _ []     = []
dropInt n (x:xs) = dropInt (n-1) xs
&lt;/source&gt;

3. &lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;

&lt;/source&gt;

==The &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; function==

{{Exercises|1=
# Use &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; to build functions that, given a list xs of Ints, return:
#* A list that is the element-wise negation of xs.
#* A list of lists of Ints xss that, for each element of xs, contains the divisors of xs. You can use the following function to get the divisors: &lt;pre&gt;divisors p = [ f | f &lt;- [1..p], p `mod` f == 0 ]&lt;/pre&gt;
#* The element-wise negation of xss.
# Implement a Run Length Encoding (RLE) encoder and decoder.
#* The idea of RLE is simple; given some input:&lt;pre&gt;&quot;aaaabbaaa&quot;&lt;/pre&gt; compress it by taking the length of each run of characters:&lt;code&gt;(4,'a'), (2, 'b'), (3, 'a')&lt;/code&gt;
#* The &lt;code&gt;concat&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;group&lt;/code&gt; functions might be helpful.  In order to use &lt;code&gt;group&lt;/code&gt;, you will need to import the Data.List module.  You can access this by typing &lt;code&gt;:m Data.List&lt;/code&gt; at the ghci prompt, or by adding &lt;code&gt;import Data.List&lt;/code&gt; to your Haskell source code file.
#* What is the type of your &lt;code&gt;encode&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;decode&lt;/code&gt; functions?
#* How would you convert the list of tuples (e.g. &lt;code&gt;[(4,'a'), (6,'b')]&lt;/code&gt;) into a string (e.g. &quot;4a6b&quot;)?
#* (bonus) Assuming numeric characters are forbidden in the original string, how would you parse that string back into a list of tuples?
}}

1.

In one block of code. In addition to the variations here, you can also replace &lt;tt&gt;Int&lt;/tt&gt; by &lt;tt&gt;Integer&lt;/tt&gt;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
negateList, negateList2 :: [Int] -&gt; [Int]
negateList = map negate
negateList2 list = map negate list

factorList, factorList2 :: [Int] -&gt; [[Int]]
factorList = map factors
factorList2 list = map factors list

-- There are a few possible variations for this one. If yours is different, check with a Haskell interpreter to see if it's correct.
-- The dots are just another higher-order trick. (g . f) x = g(f(x)) 
negateFactorList, negateFactorList2, negateFactorList3, negateFactorList4 :: [Int] -&gt; [[Int]]
negateFactorList = map (negateList . factors)
negateFactorList2 = map negateList . factorList
negateFactorList3 list = map (negateList . factors) list
negateFactorList4 list = map (map negate) (map factors list)
&lt;/source&gt;

2.

Here's my Run Length Encoding, although I don't see how I'm supposed to use &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt;. (Maybe if the text explained &lt;code&gt;group&lt;/code&gt;?)

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
encode :: Eq a =&gt; [a] -&gt; [(Int,a)]
encode [] = []
encode [x] = [(1,x)]
encode (x:y:xs) | x == y = succHead (encode (y:xs))
                | otherwise = (1,x) : encode (y:xs)

succHead :: [(Int,a)] -&gt; [(Int,a)]
succHead [] = [] -- this should never be called by encode on any input
succHead ((n,x):ps) = (n+1,x):ps

decode :: [(Int,a)] -&gt; [a]
decode [] = []
decode ((n,x):ps) = (repetition n x) ++ decode ps

repetition :: Int -&gt; a -&gt; [a]
repetition 0 _ = [] -- this should never be called by decode on a properly formatted input
repetition n x = x:(repetition (n-1) x)
&lt;/source&gt;

And here is mine using &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt;.  To understand what the &lt;code&gt;group&lt;/code&gt; command did, I visited [http://holumbus.fh-wedel.de/hayoo/hayoo.html hayoo].  If you aren't familiar with hayoo yet, take a couple of minutes to try it now.  It's very useful.

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
import Data.List

lenwhat :: [Char] -&gt; (Int, Char)
lenwhat x = (length x, head x)

encode :: [Char] -&gt; [(Int, Char)]
encode &quot;&quot; = []
encode x = map lenwhat (group x)

decode :: [(Int, Char)] -&gt; [Char]
decode [] = &quot;&quot;
decode ((l, w):xs) = (replicate l w) ++ decode xs

toRleString :: [(Int, Char)] -&gt; [Char]
toRleString [] = &quot;&quot;
toRleString ((l, w):xs) = show l ++ w : rlestring xs
&lt;/source&gt;

This is a version I made to learn to use map and group.

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
import Data.List

count_tuple (x:xs) = (length (x:xs) , x)

map count_tuple (group &quot;aaaaaabbbbbcccccccaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

Here's my (Zevras) solution:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
import Data.List

encode :: (Eq a) =&gt; [a] -&gt; [(Int, a)]
encode x = map helper $ group x
	where
		helper x = (length x, head x)

decode :: [(Int, a)] -&gt; [a]
decode xs = concat $ map rep xs
	where
		rep (n, x) = take n $ repeat x
&lt;/source&gt;

N.B., the RLE example is inspired from [http://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/blog/2007/07/31#rle a blog post] by Don Stewart on the same subject.  See Don's post for a more elegant solution (which might not be immediately understandable; see [[Haskell/Understanding arrows]] for a discussion on &lt;code&gt;&amp;&amp;&amp;&lt;/code&gt;).

Here’s my solution to the “bonus” problem. The function is called &lt;code&gt;extract&lt;/code&gt; here.
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
-- Takes a string like &quot;2a4c11b&quot; and turns it into its encoded
-- counterpart; in this case: [(2, 'a'), (4, 'c'), (11, 'b')].
extract :: String -&gt; [(Int, Char)]
extract [] = []
extract (x:xs) = extract' [x] xs

-- helper function to keep track of the numbers.
-- ns : List of digits (&quot;1234&quot;).
extract' :: String -&gt; String -&gt; [(Int, Char)]
extract' _ [] = []
extract' ns [x] = [(read ns, x)] -- the last element of the string
                                 -- is assumed to be a non-digit.
extract' ns (y:z:zs) = 
  if y `elem` ['0','1','2','3','4','5','6','7','8','9']
    then extract' (ns ++ [y]) (z:zs)
    else (read ns, y) : extract' [z] zs
&lt;/source&gt;

A possible answer to the question &quot;How would you convert the list of tuples (e.g. [(4,'a'), (6,'b')]) into a string (e.g. &quot;4a6b&quot;)?&quot;

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
-- Convert a list of tuples into a string.
-- For example, [(4, 'a'), (6, 'b')] becomes &quot;4a6b&quot;.

-- I begin with a function that converts a single tuple into a string two characters long.
-- The intToDigit function converts a interger into a character. For example: intToDigit 1 = '1'.
-- If intToDigit isn't used, GHCi will throw a type error.

import Data.Char

tupleToString :: (Int, Char) -&gt; [Char]
tupleToString x = (intToDigit.fst) x:(snd x):[]

-- Now we'll map this function to a list of tuples. We get back a list of strings.
-- For example: tuplesToStrings [(1, 'a'), (2, 'b')] = [&quot;1a&quot;, &quot;2b&quot;].

tuplesToStrings [] = []
tuplesToStrings (x:xs) = tupleToString x : tuplesToStrings xs

-- A little concat and we're done.

tuplesToString xs = (concat . tuplesToStrings) xs

Test with the function call
tuplesToString [(4,'a'), (6,'b')] ==&gt; &quot;4a6b&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

==Tips and tricks==

{{Exercises|1=
#With respect to your solutions to the first set of exercises in this chapter, is there any difference between &lt;code&gt;scanSum (takeInt 10 [1..])&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;takeInt 10 (scanSum [1..])&lt;/code&gt;?
#In the final block of exercises of the previous chapter you implemented the (!!) operator. Redo it, but this time using head and tail. (If by any chance you did it with head and tail back then, redo it with pattern matching.)
#Write functions that when applied to lists give the ''last'' element of the list and the list with the last element dropped. That can be done either with pattern matching or by using head and tail only. We suggest you to try, and compare, both approaches. (Note that this functionality is provided by Prelude through the &lt;tt&gt;last&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;init&lt;/tt&gt; functions.)
}}

1. Both &lt;code&gt;scanSum (takeInt 10 [1..])&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;takeInt 10 (scanSum [1..])&lt;/code&gt; have the same value. This is possible because Haskell is a lazy language, thus in both cases the result is only evaluated as needed.

2. &lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
getElemAt :: Int -&gt; [a] -&gt; a
getElemAt _ [] = error &quot;Index too large&quot; -- a custom error message, just for extra &quot;sugar&quot;
getElemAt 0 ls = head ls
getElemAt n ls = getElemAt (n-1) (tail ls)
&lt;/source&gt;

3. &lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
-- this is just like the Prelude function last
lastOf :: [a] -&gt; a
lastOf [] = error &quot;Empty list&quot;
lastOf (x:[]) = x
lastOf (_:xs) = lastOf (xs)

-- somewhat more complicated alternative with no pattern matching
lastOf :: [a] -&gt; a
lastOf [] = error &quot;Empty list&quot;
lastOf ls =
  if (null (tail ls))
     then head ls
     else lastOf (tail ls)
 
-- this is just like the Prelude init
dropLast :: [a] -&gt; [a]
dropLast [] = error &quot;Empty list&quot;
dropLast (x:[]) = []
dropLast (x:xs) = x : (dropLast xs)

-- again, the head/tail alternative
dropLast :: [a] -&gt; [a]
dropLast [] = error &quot;Empty list&quot;
dropLast ls =
  if (null (tail ls))
     then []
     else ((head ls) : dropLast (tail ls))
&lt;/source&gt;

== Actions ==

{{Exercises|1=
Write a program which asks the user for the base and height of a
right angled triangle, calculates its area and prints it to the screen.  The
interaction should look something like:
&lt;pre&gt;
The base?
3.3
The height?
5.4
The area of that triangle is 8.91
&lt;/pre&gt;
Hint: you can use the function &lt;code&gt;read&lt;/code&gt; to convert user strings like &quot;3.3&quot; into numbers like 3.3 and function &lt;code&gt;show&lt;/code&gt; to convert a number into string.
}}

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
main = do
  putStrLn &quot;The base?&quot;
  base &lt;- getLine
  putStrLn &quot;The height?&quot;
  height &lt;- getLine
  putStrLn (&quot;The area of that triangle is &quot; ++ show (0.5 * read base * read height))
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Controlling Actions ===

{{Exercises|1=
Write a program that asks the user for his or her name.  If the name is
one of Simon, John or Phil, tell the user that you think Haskell is a
great programming language.  If the name is Koen, tell them that you
think debugging Haskell is fun (Koen Classen is one of the people who
works on Haskell debugging); otherwise, tell the user that you don't
know who he or she is.
(As far as syntax goes there are a few different ways to do it; write at least a version using &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; / &lt;code&gt;then&lt;/code&gt; / &lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt;.)
}}

With &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt;-statements:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
main = do
  putStrLn &quot;Hello, what is your name?&quot;
  name &lt;- getLine
  if name == &quot;Simon&quot; || name == &quot;John&quot; || name == &quot;Phil&quot;
     then putStrLn &quot;I think Haskell is a great programming language.&quot;
     else if name == &quot;Koen&quot;
             then putStrLn &quot;I think debugging Haskell is fun.&quot;
             else putStrLn &quot;Sorry, I don't know you.&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

An alternative using a &lt;code&gt;where&lt;/code&gt; block:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
main = do
  putStrLn &quot;Hello, what is your name?&quot;
  name &lt;- getLine
  putStrLn (message name)
    where
    greatlanguage   = &quot;I think Haskell is a great programming language.&quot;
    message &quot;Simon&quot; = greatlanguage
    message &quot;John&quot;  = greatlanguage
    message &quot;Phil&quot;  = greatlanguage
    message &quot;Koen&quot;  = &quot;I think debugging Haskell is fun.&quot;
    message _       = &quot;Sorry, I don't know you.&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Actions under the microscope ==

{{Exercises|
# Why does the unsweet version of the let binding require an extra &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; keyword?
# Do you always need the extra &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt;?
# (extra credit) Curiously, &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; without &lt;code&gt;in&lt;/code&gt; is exactly how we wrote things when we were playing with the interpreter at the beginning of this book.  Why can you omit the &lt;code&gt;in&lt;/code&gt; keyword in the interpreter, when you'd have to put it in when typing up a source file?
}}

# A &lt;tt&gt;let ''name'' = ''value'' in ''thing''&lt;/tt&gt; binding has the same type as &lt;tt&gt;''thing''&lt;/tt&gt;. Because we want the binding to be an IO action, the &lt;tt&gt;''thing''&lt;/tt&gt; needs to be an IO action, so we need a &lt;tt&gt;do&lt;/tt&gt; keyword.
# No, not always. Just as in &quot;normal&quot; code, you can omit the &lt;tt&gt;do&lt;/tt&gt; keyword if there's only one IO action following it.
# The GHCi interpreter is like one big do-block with some extra magic, so that it converts normal expressions to IO-actions. As in any do-block, you can omit the &lt;code&gt;in&lt;/code&gt; keyword.

Ok, so you have started Kdenlive for the first time and want to dive straight into creating your own video. This quick start guide will take you from start to finish of making your own video.
&lt;/p&gt;

==Meeting the Kdenlive interface==
When you first start Kdenlive, you will have a window looking something like this :

[[File:Kdenlive Init.png|700px|The Kdenlive main window]]

In the default layout, there are five docks in the main window. Whilst all docks in Kdenlive are fully configurable, it is assumed for this tutorial that you are using the default layout.

===The Project Panel===
&lt;!-- TO DO: Link the mentions to each tab to the respective anchors in the Kdenlive/Interface page. --&gt;
The panel to the top left holds various informational and editing tabs about the current project:

The first one is the '''Project Tree''' tab. The Project Tree shows the video clips, images, slideshows, colour clips and title clips that belong to your project.

Second tab is the '''Effect Stack''' tab. If you have different effects applied to your clips, in this tab you will be able to define the order in which they are applied and also parametrise them.

Third tab is the '''Transition''' tab. On this tab, you can change different parameters for a transition.

===Effect List Panel===

The '''Effect List''' panel shows you available audio, video and custom effects for your project. Note the drop down selector that allows you to show on the the video, audio or custom effects.

===The Monitor Panel===

The third panel from the left, holds the [[Kdenlive/Interface#The Monitors|monitors]] that Kdenlive has.
 
The '''Clip monitor''' is used to preview clips, and to select a section of a clip to add to the timeline.

The '''Project monitor''' displays the final video - what your final edit will look like. 

The '''Capture monitor''' allows you to directly [[Kdenlive/Capture|capture]] video from a number of sources: A camera connected to your computer Firewire port, a Video4Linux source, such as an webcam or tvcard, or a screen capture.
&lt;!-- provided your camera allows, you'll be able also to control it from the monitor (Play, Stop, FF, ...), preview your video and capture any part of it as a DV file.--&gt;

===The Undo Panel===

The last panel in the top row is the '''Undo History''' panel, which shows your editing history and allows you to undo/redo any editing action.

===The Timeline===

The panel at the bottom of the window holds the [[Kdenlive/Interface#The Timeline|timeline]]. The timeline gives you a visual representation of your project, and shows when clips start, when they end, and in the case of overlapping clips, which one will actually be used. The timeline can contain multiple tracks. You can add video clips, sound clips, and other fancy stuffs to the tracks.

A status bar is located at the bottom of the timeline. This bar provides information about your project and also holds some useful icons ([[Image:Kdenlive_070_statusbar.png]]). You can use it to select the update or razor tool, zoom the timeline, toggle on/off the thumbnails for video and audio, and show markers and snappoints. It also displays the timeline time of your cursor.

==Now, to the video!==

Now that you know what all those sections and buttons in the window are, we will do a basic configuration for a project, add pieces of video and sound to it, move those pieces around and so on.

===Project Settings &amp; Preferences===

Before starting your first project, you are asked for a name, a working directory and a video size. You are always able to change this latter at the ''Project -&gt; Configure Project'' menu option.

For detailed information about project settings and preferences, take a look at [[Kdenlive/Preferences|this page]].

===Using clips in your project===

It goes without saying that to get any further, you will need to have some clips on your computer that you can use. To get some clips, you could go to 'YouTube', or capture them directly using either your video camera or TV-capture-device. For this section we assume that you already have some files available that are supported by Kdenlive (see supported formats in the [[Kdenlive/What Kdenlive is#Features|features]] page). 

Now that you have some clips, you can add them to your project. Select the Project List tab on the project pane, and then click on the &quot;Add clip&quot; icon ([[Image:Add_clip_icon.jpg]]) in the top right to bring up the context menu. From here, select &quot;Add Clips&quot; to bring up a standard KDE open dialog. Find your clips, select as many as you want to add (select more than one by holding the Ctrl key), and they will be added!

Your added clips will now appear in the project list, along with their duration and a few other pieces of information (like a thumbnail).

For the purpose of this Quickstart guide, and in order to show you the basic '''Kdenlive''' functionalities, we'll work with two of your clips, adding a title at the beginning, a video transition between them and a video effect to a part of one clip. Finally, we'll render the project to obtain a nice DVD ready to be burned and played on our TV.

===Creating a title===

Firstly, we are going to create a title clip for your project. Kdenlive is able to create simple titles. We can also work with external image editors (like GIMP) to create more sophisticated titles and then add them to the project list as explained above.

To create a title clip, select &quot;Add clip&quot; icon ([[Image:Add_clip_icon.jpg]]) and, in the context menu, select &quot;Create Text Clip&quot;. A new window like this will be presented: 

[[Image:Create_tittle_clip.png | 700px | none | Kdenlive creating a title clip]]

In this window, you can give a name to your clip, define the duration, the letter type, size and colour. You'll also have the following icons:

[[Image:Add_text_icon.jpg]] To enter the text

[[Image:Add_box_icon.jpg]] To draw a box

[[Image:Up_down_icons.jpg]] To bring to front / send back the text or the box

You can now select the &quot;Enter text&quot; icon, write the title and click &quot;OK&quot;. The text will appear in the window and you can drag and drop it wherever you want on the screen. To improve your title, click the &quot;Draw box&quot; icon and, with the left mouse button pressed, draw a box on the screen. Before doing so, you need to change the box colour in the same way as you did for the text. If the box and the text have the same colour, they may interfere!

Don't worry if you can't see your text now! Select the box and try with the &quot;Bring to front/send back&quot; icons. Better now, huh? 

By dragging and dropping the box and the text and by playing with the movement icons, you can obtain quite nice titles!

===Dragging clips to the timeline===

Now that you have some clips in your project, it is time to start editing them together into your dream video. There are two basic ways to add a clip to the timeline.

You can '''drag a clip directly from the project list'''. Select one of the clips that you have added to the project list, and drag it to the timeline. As soon as the mouse reaches a track, the clip will appear on the track. With this kind of drag, the entire duration of the clip is placed on the timeline. You can then edit the clip from the timeline.

The other way is to '''select a segment of a clip and then add this segment to the timeline'''. When you click on a clip in the project list, the Clip Monitor will automatically load the clip. You can then press Play on the Clip Monitor and get an idea of which bits of the clip you actually want on the timeline. Then, position the seek marker ([[Image:Seek_marker.jpg]]) to where you want your clip to start and click the &quot;inpoint&quot; button ([[Image:Inpoint.jpg]]). Move the cursor to where you want the clip to end, and click the &quot;outpoint&quot; button ([[Image:Outpoint.jpg]]). Finally, you can move this cut-down clip to the timeline by clicking the video screen on the Clip Monitor and, holding down the left mouse button, placing it in the desired point of the timeline. The selected zone between the in and out point will then appear there as a clip (to be more precise, a subclip as we've selected only a part of the original clip). 

Choose your way and, to continue with the quickstart guide, be sure to move two clips (or subclips) to the timeline. One to Track #1 and the other to Track #2.

===Moving and resizing clips on the timeline===

Moving the selected clips around on the timeline is as simple as clicking on them with the left mouse button and dragging them around. You can resize clips directly from the timeline. Simply move the mouse cursor to the beginning or end of the clip you want to resize. Now, click and drag with the left mouse button to resize the clip.

Resizing a clip changes its in and out points. If you reselect the clip and look in the clip monitor, you will see that the in and out points on the monitor show the new positions. It is not possible to resize an audio or video clip past their length - if a clip is 30 seconds in length, then you will not be able to resize the clip so that it finishes playing 35 seconds into the clip! -. On the other hand, you can resize text, image or color clips to increase or reduce their length as you want.

When you are resizing and moving clips, there is a handy &quot;snap to&quot; feature, which will snap the edges of clips to other clips and the current seek position. This is useful for quickly lining clips up with each other, but in some cases may not be what you want. You can turn this behaviour on and off using the &quot;Snap to&quot; icons: [[Image:Snap_to_icons.jpg]]

To move multiple clips, hold down shift, then drag a selection box on the timeline. You should click then with the mouse outside a clip to start doing the selection box. Test this on an empty timeline, should be clear. Combine with zoom (ctrl+mousewheel) to be able to select a large portion of the timeline.

===Removing clips from the timeline===

There are some ways to remove a clip from the timeline. Maybe the easier one is to select the clip or clips that you want to delete, and press the &quot;Delete&quot; button on your keyboard.

Another way is to select the clips that you want to delete, press the right mouse button and in the context menu select option ''Delete Clip''.

By this, you'll remove the clip from the timeline but it still appears in the &quot;Project Tree&quot; list. If you select the clip here and proceed as above, you'll remove it also from the project. But do not worry, it still remains physically on your disk!

===Splitting clips in the timeline===

Sometimes you may need to delete (maybe because you let your video-camera or TV-capture-device run too long) or maybe to apply a video effect to only a part of a clip. '''Kdenlive''' allows you to do so by splitting the original clip.

To split a clip, the normal way is to place the timeline cursor at the splitting point (you can adjust the exact position by playing with the &quot;Next frame&quot; [[Image:Next_frame.jpg]] and &quot;Previous frame&quot; [[Image:Previous_frame.jpg]] buttons in the &quot;Timeline Monitor&quot;). Then press the right mouse button and in the context menu select option ''Razor Clip''. (The razor cuts ''before'' the current frame, so the ''right strip'' will contain the frame you're standing on.) With this option only the clip in the current track will be split. 

You can split all clips at that position selecting the option ''Razor All Clips'' in the edit menu.
&lt;!-- this option does not works, please, could someone check/confirm?
If you repeat this action, you can create different subclips that will appear in the &quot;Project Tree&quot; list. Then you can move, delete or resize these clips as you want.
--&gt;

===Adding a transition===

We are going now to add a transition between two clips. Transitions are normally used to smoothly change from one clip to another (or from one scene to another). Some transitions can be used also as video effects (Picture in Picture, for example). These powerful features are explained in detail in [[Kdenlive/Transitions|this page]], but for the purpose of this quickstart guide, we'll focus on an easy one, the crossfade transition (but see the warning at the top of this page!)

Before start, be sure that you have your two videoclips in tracks #1 and #2. Also, move (as explained before) the title clip that we've created previously to the start of track #0.

If we want to apply a transition, we need to overlap the required clips in different tracks. So first thing to do is to move the clip in track #1 to overlap with the title in track #0, let say by 2 seconds. 

To better control this overlap you can change the timeline zoom using the viewer tool [[Image:Timeline_scale.jpg]]. Click on the magnifying glass and select a small scale or click on the ruler and drag left.

Once done, click on the title clip and press the right mouse button. In the context menu select ''Add transition -&gt; Crossfade''. A yellow bar will appear between the clips in tracks #0 and #1 indicating your transition has been added to the project.

At this point your screen should look like this one:

[[Image:Transition.png| 700px | none | Kdenlive: transition example]]


To have a real time view of how your transition works, you can click the seek marker [[Image:Seek_marker.jpg]] and drag it over the transition area. If everything is OK, you should see in the &quot;Timeline Monitor&quot; how the title clip disappears at the same time the video clip is displayed.

To edit a transition and change parameters, you can double click on it (the yellow bar). In this way, it will become red and the focus in the &quot;Project Panel&quot; will change to the &quot;Transition tab&quot;. In this tab you'll be able to change the transition parameters if needed.

As the Crossfade is an easy transition, the only parameters you can change are the transition direction and the track where it applies.

If the ''Invert direction'' parameter is selected, the upper track clip is shown first and the transition is applied until the view changes to the lower track clip. If the parameter is not selected, then the direction is the other way round.

The track to apply the transition is normally the next track after the one where we created the transition. But you can change this behaviour by selecting others in the ''Track Selection List''. This is a powerful feature for advanced transitions, but for the moment we'll not use, so be sure your selection is ''Automatic – Use next video track''.

You can play now creating a new transition between clips in tracks #1 and #2 in the same way as explained above.

===Adding effects===

Now you know how to create a transition between clips, is time to experiment with another feature in '''Kdenlive''': The effects.

Effects are ways to change your original clip. Kdenlive comes with different effects that can be applied to the audio and others that can be applied to the video. The small number of standard audio effects can be easily increased if you use the Ladspa plug-ins (see [[Kdenlive/Audio effects|this page]] to know how to load them).

To know in detail all effects and how they works, you can have a look at [[Kdenlive/Effects|this page]]. 

In this guide we'll know how to apply a &quot;Greyscale&quot; effect to a clip. This effect, as the name indicates, will take out colors from the video and display it in black &amp; white (well, really using black, white and different grey tones! ).

Normally, except some of them, the effects apply to a full clip so, if you want to limit the effect to just a part, you need to create &quot;subclips&quot; as explained before in this page.

So let's go to clip in track #2. Select it and click the right mouse button. In the context menu select ''Add Video Effect -&gt; Greyscale''. You'll see immediatly how the colours in your clip dissapear and are replaced by grey tones!

In the same way as transitions, you can also edit the effect parameters. To do so, select the &quot;Effect Stack&quot; tab in the Project Panel. Unfortunately, the Greyscale effect is so easy that has no parameters!   

But in this tab, you can also find some useful icons to organize the effects:

[[Image:Effect_up.jpg]] to move the effect up in the list (that means it will be applied first to the clip)

[[Image:Effect_down.jpg]] to move the effect down in the list

[[Image:Reset_parm.jpg]] to reset all effect parameters to the default values

[[Image:Remove_effect.jpg]] to remove the effect from the clip

You can see also that behind the effect name there's a checkbox. If you uncheck it, the effect will not be applied but still remains in the effect list with the selected parameters (if any!). This is useful if you want to use it later on.

And behind the &quot;Parameters&quot; tab, you'll notice another one titled &quot;Keyframes&quot;. For some effects, you can select as many keyframes as you need in the clip and for each keyframe you can define different parameters. This is useful if you want, for example, mute a part of a clip. You can do so in two ways:

- Creating a subclip and applying the &quot;Mute&quot; audio effect to this subclip
- Or using the &quot;Volume&quot; effect. This can be applied to the full clip and, by defining different keyframes you can adjust the volume, for example, to start muted, then increase progressively, then continue at normal level, then decrease progressively and become muted, continue muted for a time and start again progressively ...

To know more about keyframes and how to work with them see [[Kdenlive/Working with keyframes|this page]]

===Rendering your work===

At this point we are ready to render our project and see how it looks on our TV, PC, ... If you've followed the steps until now, your screen should look like this one:

[[File:Kdenlive Effects.png|700px]]

You have a title clip in track #0 with a crossfade transition between it and the other clip in track #1. Another transition (this one made by you!) between this clip and the one in track #2 and a greyscale effect applied to this clip.

Now follow some steps to create a DVD with this project. With Kdenlive you'll be able to easily create a DVD video structure and burn it (if you have installed the program [http://sourceforge.net/projects/k3b/ k3b]). You will also add a simple menu with chapters and even with an intro movie if you like.

To create a DVD video, you can follow these steps:

- Select the menu option ''Render -&gt; Export to DVD''.
- You'll be presented with a window to enter export details:

[[File:Kdenlive Create_DVD_1.png]]

- In this screen you should enter the folder name where the DVD structure should be created and the DVD format (PAL/NTSC). Be sure that the option &quot;Render file now&quot; is selected.

As you can see, in this screen it's also possible to define the DVD chapters and also to create the DVD from an existing video file (.VOB), but for the moment we are not going to use these options. For further details see [[Kdenlive/Render#Exporting to DVD|this page]].

- Press the &quot;Next&quot; button. In the following dialog you can select to create a DVD menu or not. If you want to, check the &quot;Create Menu&quot; option and the rest of the data will be accessible.

[[File:Kdenlive Create_DVD_2.png]]

You can choose to use a plain colored screen for your menu (click on the color box to select it), an image file or even a movie file (enter the path and name if selected). Also, you can define a pause between chapters if you have created such.

In the &quot;Buttons&quot; tab you can define the title text, font and size and the different colors for the button depending on status (not selected, selected, pressed).

In the &quot;Intro&quot; tab you can indicate a video file to be presented before the menu appears in the screen (like an introduction video).

- When you've entered data, press again the &quot;Next&quot; button. '''Kdenlive''' is now ready to generate the DVD using the program [http://dvdauthor.sourceforge.net/ DvdAuthor]. Click on &quot;Generate DVD&quot; to do so.

[[Image:Create_DVD_4.png]]

A message will appear telling you to continue working while the video is generated. You can see progress in the &quot;Status Bar&quot;.

When the process is finished, you may choose to work with the generated DVD externally (you'll find the Audio &amp; Video directories in the specified path) or return again to this screen by selecting menu option ''Render -&gt; Export to DVD''. If you decided to go on with Kdenlive, you'll have options to directly burn your video (using [http://sourceforge.net/projects/k3b/ k3b]), preview it (using [http://xinehq.de Xine]) or edit again the structure (using [http://qdvdauthor.sourceforge.net/ QDvdAuthor]).

Congratulations! You've created your first video with '''Kdenlive'''. Enjoy it and continue reading to know more about this program and its advanced features.

==Tutorials in video==

Sometimes it is much more easier to understand something by watching how it is done, than by reading about it. Some video tutorials were made for simple tasks in '''Kdenlive'''. Ensure that you have a media player capable of playing .OGG videos:

=Chapter 3. Using Kdenlive=

==The Project List==

The project list shows all of the clips that are available for this project.

You can see the number of times that a particular clip is in use. This includes all usage of the clip - for instance, if a clip is being displayed in the clip monitor, then that counts as one usage for the clip. 

===Adding clips to the project===

If you drag a clip onto the timeline that is not in the project (for instance, if you drag a dv straight from konqueror to Kdenlive), then it will be automatically added to the project for you.

You can add clips to the projectlist yourself. Either use the project list context menu (right click on the window), or the Project menu on the menu bar. Select 'Add Clips' to bring up a file dialog in which you can select the clip you wish to add to this project. As long as the clips are valid, they will appear in the project list.

===Deleting clips via the project list===

You can delete clips from your project by selecting 'Delete Clip' via the clip context menu (right click) or from the Project menu.  When you delete a clip from the project list this will also remove any clips on the timeline that are using it.


Examining Clip Properties

===Clip Properties===

===Clean Project - removing unused clips===

Use clean project to remove any clips from your project that are currently unused. This is great if your project list has become cluttered and you want to get a concise view of which clips exist. Cleaning a project will not alter your final edit in any way - the only clips that are removed are those that are no longer in use anywhere.

==Transitions==

Transitions are probably one of the most interesting features of non-linear video edition. They are used between two clips and they allow a soft, or a sophisticated way of passing from one scene to the other. This is a contrast with the &quot;hard&quot; or &quot;dry&quot; cut between scenes -- which, prior to the computer adoption, were very hard to make or required special equipment.

For using a transition effect in Kdenlive, you must place the two clips you want to join in different video tracks, in such a way that they &quot;overlap&quot; each other a little bit --- exactly in the points you want to place the transition. Then, right-click the mouse over the first clip (the &quot;outgoing&quot; one), then select '''Add transition''' in the context menu, and point the mouse towards the arrow for seeing the transition types available. Then you will see a yellow rectangle placed between the video tracks, representing the transition. For having a live preview of how the transition will look like, simply drag the timeline cursor from left to right over the transition area.

You can modify the transition effect, or the way it works, by left-clicking the mouse twice over this yellow rectangle. This will turn it into red and cause the &quot;Transition&quot; tab in the top-left panel to pop and show the properties you can set for the currently selected transition effect --- and, if you want, you can choose another type of transition, clicking at the icons at the left of this panel. We will call this operation as &quot;entering in edit mode&quot; for the transition.

At the time of version 0.4, Kdenlive provides four major kinds of transitions, which are expected to be expanded and more stable in version 0.5.

=== Crossfade ===
This is the most known and used transition effect --- the scenes are softly blended, the second scene becoming bolder until the first scene is completely over. This effect can also be used for the widely known '''fade-in/fade-out''' effect.

For creating the fade in/out, you can create a [[color clip]] with any desired color and use it as the first or second scene of the transition. If you simply want to use the default &quot;fade to/from black&quot;, you can simply enter in edit mode and, at the top-left panel, click in the combobox ''Perform transition with:'' and choose &quot;Background track (black)&quot;.

=== Push ===
This transition does not blend the clips --- instead, the &quot;outgoing&quot; clip is &quot;pushed out&quot; the screen by the incoming clip.

In the edit mode for the ''Push'' transition, you must use the ''Start'' and ''End'' radiobuttons to define, respectively, where the first scene will be &quot;positioned&quot; in the screen during the transition --- in other words, you set the push direction. For that, just click in the rectangles of the 3x3 matrix shown. Usually you will click in the central rectangle for &quot;Start&quot;; you will certainly see no transition effect if you choose another start position.

The Transparency control allows you to set, well, transparency to the clip which is going out the screen. It is applied also according to the &quot;Start&quot; and &quot;End&quot; buttons. You will normally want the outgoing clip to vanish during the movement, so you will set 0 or a low value for transparency at &quot;Start&quot;, and a higher value at &quot;End&quot;.

Anyway, you might want the second clip to &quot;come into the screen&quot; --- so you can use the &quot;Invert direction&quot; checkbutton, and use  accordingly inverted values and directions for &quot;Start&quot; and &quot;End&quot;. Play around with the options until you get the desired effect.

=== PIP ===
PIP stands for '''Picture in picture''', and this transition effect causes the impression that the second clip is growing from a point, or the first clip is shrinking to a certain point. 

=== Wipe ===

==The Effect List==

The effect list contains different audio and video effects. An effect can modify the video or the sound clip, like change the color balance of a video clip, or add extra gain to the sound clip.

=== Kdenlive audio effects ===

These audio effects are available in Kdenlive 0.4:

* '''Mute'''(MLT effect) hides audio from a clip
* '''Volume'''(MLT effect) adjust clip audio volume with keyframes

* '''Declipper'''([http://plugin.org.uk/ LADSPA effect ]) remove clicks from the soundtrack
* '''Vinyl'''([http://plugin.org.uk/ LADSPA effect ]) emulate the sound of a vinyl record player
* '''Limiter'''([http://plugin.org.uk/ LADSPA effect ]) limit the audio volume
* '''Equalizer'''([http://plugin.org.uk/ LADSPA effect ]) stereo equalizer
* '''Phaser'''([http://plugin.org.uk/ LADSPA effect ]) phaser effect
* '''Pitch Scaler'''([http://plugin.org.uk/ LADSPA effect ])
* '''Pitch Shifter'''([http://plugin.org.uk/ LADSPA effect ]) 
* '''Rate Scaler'''([http://plugin.org.uk/ LADSPA effect ]) 
* '''Reverb'''([http://plugin.org.uk/ LADSPA effect ])
* '''Room Reverb'''([http://plugin.org.uk/ LADSPA effect ]) 

Ladspa audio effects '''will only be available''' if you have the required dependencies installed:
* Ladspa (ladspa-sdk)
* libJack (libjack-dev)
* Ladspa plugins (swh-plugins)

=== Kdenlive video effects ===

These video effects are available in Kdenlive 0.4:

* '''Brightness'''
* '''Charcoal'''
* '''Gamma'''
* '''Greyscale'''
* '''Invert'''
* '''Mirror'''
* '''Obscure''' allows you to mask a portion of screen with keyframable mosaic effect.
* '''Sepia'''
* '''Speed''' allows you to slow down, speed up, reverse play and make stroboscope effect (*)
* '''Freeze''' allows you to freeze the clip at, after or before a user defined frame (*)

(*) Needs latest MLT cvs development version

==The Effect Stack==

The effect stack contains the effects used for the selected track element.

==The Timeline==

===Using Virtual Clips===

Virtual clips work in Kdenlive differently than in other editing software.
In Kdenlive, a virtual clip is the dynamic duplicate of a section of
your timeline. It means that you can apply transitions, filters and
everything, they will reflect in the virtual clip. One of
the use of this is when you make a movie with chapters and want the same
background for your titles, you can create a virtual clip for this, and
then put the virtual clip as background of your titles. Then, changing
the virtual zone will update all your chapters background.

==The Clip Monitor==

==The Workspace Monitor==

The workspace monitor shows the video that is the result of the current timeline. It works in a similar way to the clip monitor.

Inpoints and outpoints on the workspace monitor achieve the same purpose as they do on the clip monitor. You can choose a part of the current timeline, and drag a clip of it back to the timeline. You will get a &quot;project clip&quot;, which is a clip that contains all of the clips on the timeline in the state when you made it. It is useful for grouping together a number of clips when you have finished editing them and want to be able to treat them as a single clip. 

==Rendering your project==

When you have finished editing, you can render your project via the Render-&gt;Export Timeline menu. This brings up a dialog, which allows you to choose your export format, export options, and filename to save as. 

==Loading and saving your project==

Load your project via the File-&gt;open menu. Save your project via the File-&gt;save-as menu. 

==Setup the renderer==

With this dialogbox, you can configre all parameters for the renderer program.

=Chapter 1. Introduction=

Kdenlive is a non-linear video editor for KDE. Please report any problems or feature requests to &lt;jasonwood@blueyonder.co.uk&gt; or use the kdenlive-devel mailing list at [http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_id=9048|sourceforge.net]

==What is a video editor?==

A video editor is an application that allows you to create a new video out of various scenes from one or more other videos. 

==What is the difference between linear editing and non-linear editing?==

Before editing video on computer was possible, most editing was done on linear editors - these work by having essentially, two video recorders. The first would hold the video that you are editing together, and the second would be used to find the next clip that you want to record. Find a clip, record it, find the next clip, record it. This is called linear editing because the medium of tape forced things to be edited sequentially. If you have edited 10 minutes worth of footage together, and decide that you made a mistake after five minutes, you can't just &quot;push&quot; the last five minutes around to add space for new clips.

Non-linear editing is by far a more flexible way of editing. You can place clips anywhere within your final video (in Kdenlive, this is represented via the timeline), and you can move them around as much as you want, rearrange them in a completely different order. Best of all, at any point during this you can press play and (with a sufficiently powerful computer) watch back what you have done there and then.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Kdenlive should compile on most recent GNU/Linux and FreeBSD systems, including x86 and AMD64 architectures. Also, it is already compiled and ready to install in binary packages for a number of distros.

The current version (0.7) of Kdenlive is a KDE4 program. This means that you will need some KDE4 support on your system to compile or use Kdenlive. But, you do not need to actually run KDE4 for this. You can build/install and run under KDE3, Gnome, and other desktop environments. This is similar to running KDE3 apps from Gnome, or Gnome apps from KDE.

Many '''distros''' already offer Kdenlive for easy installation. Check http://www.kdenlive.org/content/2008-09-26-download-kdenlive

== Gentoo ==
Gentoo offers ebuilds for kdenlive 0.7. You'll need a basic install of KDE 4, then 

 # emerge kdenlive
and you're done.

If you're running only KDE 3.5, you'll have to use kdenlive-0.5 or install from sources: svn revision 1825 is reported to work decently (see below).

= Compiling libraries =

Warning : for Kdenlive for KDE4 version, please read : http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Kdenlive/KDE4_Porting

== Installing from SVN ==

Make sure you install all listed libraries before attempting to compile Kdenlive!!!
Install libraries in the order listed on that page.
Most libraries and header files should be packaged in your GNU/Linux distribution.
Just install the requested packages:

* QT and KDE development files (KDE &gt;= 3.4 required)
Provided with most distributions (usually named qt-devel and kdelibs-devel. For debian users, see debian-desktop.org for a recent KDE environment).

* SDL
Provided with most distributions. Install the devel package: SDL-dev and SDL-image-dev. 

* Audio / video and other libraries (you should be able to find binary packages for all of them in your distro):
** Gdk-Pixbuf (gdk-pixbuf, gdk-pixbuf-dev) (not needed anymore)
** libsamplerate (libsamplerate, libsamplerate-dev)
** OGG (libogg, libogg-dev)
** Vorbis (libvorbis, libvorbis-dev)
** libdv (libdv, libdv-dev)
** Ladspa (ladspa-sdk)
** libJack (libjack-dev)
** Ladspa plugins (swh-plugins)
** SOX (sox, sox-dev)
** libXML2 (libxml2, libxml2-dev)
** libmad (libmad-dev)

* Optional:
** Libquicktime (libquicktime, libquicktime-dev)
** Theora (libtheora, libtheora-dev)
* FFMPEG (libavformat development files, recent version + libswscale, libswscale-dev):
If you cannot find a recent package for libavformat-dev or libswcale-dev (hint: for Ubuntu try http://ubuntu.tonio.homelinux.org), download the development svn version:
 svn checkout svn://svn.mplayerhq.hu/ffmpeg/trunk ffmpeg
ffmpeg recommended config option: 
 ./configure --enable-gpl --enable-shared --enable-libvorbis --enable-libogg --enable-pp --enable-swscaler

''(update 4.4.2008 by espinosa_cz: in recent ffmpeg from SVN names of some parameters changed use --enable-postproc --enable-swscale instead of --enable-pp --enable-swscaler)''
----

For (K)Ubuntu 7.10 (Gutsy) :

You can install all needed packages for the SVN building by installing (sudo apt-get install or from Synaptic) the following packages:
## NOTE this may install the KDE Desktop onto Ubuntu!  That's a lot of sweet software!
## NOTE2 this list is growing; if you're aware of something that can be removed, please do!
## NOTE3 I've cleaned the list and, in case of doubt, I've mention it but keep the file just in case. If somebody can test and clean even more this will be appreciated (herrej01)

 kde-devel (not sure) qt4-dev-tools kdelibs4-dev 
 libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-image1.2-dev (not sure) libgdk-pixbuf-dev 
 libsamplerate0 (not sure) libsamplerate0-dev ladspa-sdk libjack-dev
 swh-plugins sox (not sure) sox-dev libxml2-dev libmad0-dev 
 libcgicc1-dev checkinstall build-essential subversion python2.4 
 libx264-dev cmake libgsm1-dev autotools-dev g++ autoconf 
 automake1.9 xdialog ccache debhelper html2text libsndfile1-dev 
 intltool-debian (not sure) po-debconf (not sure)

The following libs will be needed depending on the type of file you want to render 

 libsmpeg-dev libquicktime-dev libogg-dev libvorbis-dev libdv4-dev 
 liblame-dev libfaad2-dev libfaac-dev libxvidcore4-dev
 liba52-0.7.4 (not sure) liba52-0.7.4-dev

I think the following libs are not needed assuming you've already installed dvgrab

 libavc1394-dev libiec61883-dev 

And finally, following libs are not needed if you are going to install ffmpeg, mlt and mlt++ from source

 libavformat-dev libmlt++-dev libmlt-dev libswscale-dev 

----

* [http://www.dennedy.org/mlt/twiki/bin/view/MLT/WebHome MLT] ([http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=96039 version 0.2.4 or greater]):



mlt 0.2.4 stable release is required for Kdenlive 0.5.

You can install mlt 0.2.4 or checkout MLT from SVN:
 svn co https://mlt.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/mlt/trunk/mlt mlt

Recommended config option for MLT: 
 ./configure --prefix=/usr --enable-gpl --disable-mmx --avformat-swscale --enable-motion-est

All other MLT configure options are enabled by default.

You might need --avformat-ldextra if your ffmpeg/libavcodec is built against 
some external libs like libmp3lame or libvorbis. My ld.so does not require 
this, but it seems some systems/environments require it.

NOTE 1:Make sure that the configure output gives no error for modules/avformat, since it means FFMpeg was not correctly installed. Make sure swh-plugins and ladspa-sdk packages are installed. These packages provide sound effects. MLT has many dependencies, but you will be warned at ./configure time

NOTE 2: 
When you are on (K)Ubuntu and the ./configure... step ends in errors like:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;./configure: 37: function: not found&lt;br&gt;
./configure: 93: function: not found&lt;br&gt;
./configure: 174: build_config: not found&lt;br&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;...&lt;br&gt;
./configure: 191: build_pkgconfig: not found&lt;/code&gt;

Either edit the ./configure file and replace on the first line &quot;#!/bin/sh&quot; to &quot;#!/bin/bash&quot; and run again, or simply type: bash ./configure .....
This problem is caused due to the fact that (K)Ubuntu Edgy defaults to the dash shell instead of the bash shell. Dash is currently known for being less compatible with scripting.


* [http://www.dennedy.org/mlt/twiki/bin/view/MLT/WebHome MLT++] ([http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=96039 version 0.2.2 or greater])
Checkout MLT++ from SVN:
 svn co https://mlt.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/mlt/trunk/mlt++ mlt++

== Debian Unstable ==

Debian binary packages are provided by Christian Marillat. Packages include the latest ffmpeg developments are usually very well up-to-date. For example, mlt includes kdenlive module and avformat-swscale.

Add the following line to your /etc/apt/sources.list file:

 # Experimental
 deb http://www.debian-multimedia.org experimental main
 deb-src http://www.debian-multimedia.org experimental main
 # Unstable
 deb http://www.debian-multimedia.org sid main
 deb-src http://www.debian-multimedia.org sid main
 # Testing
 deb http://www.debian-multimedia.org testing main
 deb-src http://www.debian-multimedia.org testing main

If you haven't done so yet, import Marillat's key:

 gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --recv-keys 1F41B907
 gpg --armor --export 1F41B907 &gt; key.asc
 sudo apt-key add key.asc

Then, simply type
sudo apt-get build-dep kdenlive

Although as of March 2010, on some Debian systems, even after running apt-get update, you will still be told &quot;E: Unable to find a source package for kdenlive&quot;.  It seems that the structure of these file sites have changed greatly since this document was written.

When compiling Kdenlive 0.5 svn from source, you will also need:
sudo apt-get install mlt libmlt0.2.3 libmlt-dev libmlt++0.2.3 libmlt++-dev

== Debian Unstable &amp; SVN KDEnlive 0.6 ==

Make sure to have the above repositories available

sudo apt-get build-dep kdenlive mlt mlt++ ffmpeg

sudo apt-get install kde-devel qt4-dev-tools kdelibs4-dev libsdl1.2-dev
libsdl-image1.2-dev libgdk-pixbuf-dev libsamplerate0 libsamplerate0-dev
ladspa-sdk libjack-dev swh-plugins sox libsox-dev libxml2-dev libmad0-dev
libcgicc5-dev checkinstall build-essential subversion python2.4 libx264-dev
cmake libgsm1-dev autotools-dev g++ autoconf automake1.9 xdialog ccache
debhelper html2text libsndfile1-dev intltool-debian po-debconf libsmpeg-dev
libquicktime-dev libogg-dev libvorbis-dev libdv4-dev liblame-dev libfaad-dev
libfaac-dev libxvidcore4-dev liba52-0.7.4 liba52-0.7.4-dev libavformat-dev

Then use the Easy Script Installer v3.1 available in the Forums

== Red Hat Enterprise ==

* *NOTE* This only lets me compile so far.  Upon running, I get a crash.  Hopefully you will get further than I did.  This may be a red herring but in the past I've seen issues with Redhat and threaded libraries.

 Edit src/modules/sox/filter_sox.c, change #include &lt;st.h&gt; to #include &lt;sox/st.h&gt;
 Edit src/modules/avformat/Makefile and comment out the &quot;LDFLAGS+=-lswscale$(AVFORMAT_SUFFIX)&quot; line inside ifdef SWSCALE stanza
 Edit src/modules/qimage/Makefile and add &quot;CFLAGS+=-I/usr/include/kde&quot; inside ifdef USE_KDE stanza
 make/make install

* mlt++: didn't have any problems with standard configure/make/make install

* unsermake
 svn co svn://anonsvn.kde.org/home/kde/tags/unmaintained/3/unsermake
 export PATH=$PATH:path-to-unsermake-&quot;binary&quot;

* once you've installed mlt, mlt++, and unsermake, you can &quot;make&quot; inside kdenlive directory

= Compiling kdenlive =

Checkout Kdenlive from SVN:
 svn co https://kdenlive.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/kdenlive/trunk/kdenlive kdenlive

''NOTE: Once you have dowloaded the complete svn package, you can update your local svn source by only downloading the updated parts.''
''Say you have downloaded the svn into ~/kdenlive. Simply cd into ~/kdenlive and type: svn update.''


Configure Kdenlive, compile and install (NOTE: This is for the SVN version only. If you have downloaded a release version, follow the instructions in kdenlive/INSTALL).:
 
 cd kdenlive ; \
 cmake . ;\
 make ; \
 sudo make install

Be aware of the dot (.) after cmake command. It's important !

You are now ready to use Kdenlive. Have fun !

= Compiling kdenlive &amp; ffmpeg &amp; mlt together - the easy way =

Best option for testers is to get updated SVN versions of ffmpeg and mlt libs when updating kdenlive. Because it is not so simple task, I have created a simple bash script to do the repeative and tricky business for you.

Download the updated version of the builder script from the forum:

* [http://www.kdenlive.org/bbforum/download/file.php?id=96 kdenlive_builder script version 3.1]

Download it, save it in your root source directory (/home/espinosa/src in my case), name it as kdenlive_builder.sh (preferably), in console change directory to you root source directory and use :

  ./bash kdenlive_builder.sh

An XDialog box will appear.

Choose the first option (GET) to make clean previous installations and get new sources from SVN. Program will ask where do you want to place the sources.

Choose the second option (INSTALL) to compile and install your previously downloaded sources. You'll be prompted where do you want to install the programs. If you choose in /usr, a warning message will appear and you'll be requested during installation to give your root password. This will not happen if you choose another directory in your /home path. With this option, you can select also if you want support for some audio/video types. Be sure to have necessary libs installed if you choose any of these options. 

Choose the third option (FULL) to do both steps (GET &amp; INSTALL) together.

Choose the fourth option (INFO) to obtain information about currently downloaded SVN versions.

Then run kdenlive from chosen destination directory. 

This script is especially useful for testers as it supports multiple versions installed in any directory (home, opt, or local) including multiple ffmpeg and mtl. Plus, this is the way to get the right set of up-to-date main libraries, to avoid problem with outdated or failing distribution versions of mlt and ffmpeg.

If you experience an issue with the script check the forum board for discussion first.

There is also an alternative version of this script [[../Kdenlive builder classic script/]] which is a branch of original non-GUI, non-interactive version. Use this variant if the former does not work for you, if you prefer true batch processing, if you expect repeative calling etc.  

''NOTE: the script does not provide any check of libraries or header files required by kdenlive &amp; ffmpeg &amp; mlt, like SDL, liblame, libx264 etc.''
''Read carefully the requirements section to have everything installed (all -dev packages)''

= Compiling kdenlive &amp; ffmpeg &amp; mlt together - the even easier way =

I (Mads Bondo Dydensborg) have created a GUI Wizard, that can build the KDE4 (or KDE3) version of Kdenlive from current development sources. It is available from [http://www.kde-apps.org/content/show.php?content=85826] and is suited both for one-shot builds, or automated nightly builds (the later requires obtaining the sources, available from the page).

&lt;/p&gt;
--&gt;

This is a list of questions/answers that can be useful for users. Feel free to add your own tips.
&lt;!-- This page really needs some update to the new structure; we can create links pointing to the manual pages, and transfer some of those questions to them. --&gt;
='''General'''=
==Does Kdenlive support .ogv from Recordmydesktop?==
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BenpuyoV_ck It's not in the list of supported files.]

==Can I import .dv files from kino?==
Yes, it should work without problem. Due to a small bug, the .dv clips don't show up in the &quot;Add Clip&quot; dialog of Kdenlive 0.3. You can just enter an asterisk (*) in the filter line of the dialog and all files will be shown. Or simply drag and drop the dv file into Kdenlive's project view.

==I am told/I have read that I can add more luma file transitions. How do I do that?==
All users can add new transitions into Kdenlive by using the new &quot;download new luma file&quot; feature. (Settings-&gt;Get new luma transition)

==How can I create luma transitions/wipes?==
Create a pgm file (it is just a grayscale image with size 720x576 (PAL) or 720x486 (NTSC) with gradients. Gimp or Inkscape, for example, are quite good for creating the images.&lt;br&gt;
When ready simply put them in the folder ~/.kde/share/apps/kdenlive/pgm/PAL (create the folder if necessary).&lt;br&gt;
To test the luma files just start Kdenlive, and your new transition will automatically appear in the list.&lt;br&gt;
'''OR'''&lt;br&gt;
use a string like this in a terminal window for a real quick preview:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;inigo /path/to/clip1 -track -blank 10 /path/to/clip2 -transition luma:square.pgm softness=0 in=10 out=35 a_track=0 b_track=1&lt;/tt&gt;

==How can I share my luma transitions with other kdenlive users?==
Using the KNewstuff technology you can now share your luma files through the internet. Simply upload your luma file to [http://www.kde-files.org http://www.kde-files.org]. You need to create a free account, then go to Add Content and upload your image file into the category Kdenlive. You can also create a tar.gz archive containing several pgm images. Please add a comment to say if the transition is PAL or NTSC, add a small jpeg preview and that's it.&lt;br&gt;
You could also send your cool luma files to Jean-Baptiste so that he can upload them.

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;!-- Add some empty lines to create some extra whitespace to separate sections --&gt;

='''Capturing'''=
==How do I get video captured from recordmydesktop to play/render in .75?==

==I get a 'read permission' error when trying to capture video (as normal user)==
In order to use Firewire DV camcorders you must have read/write permission to /dev/raw1394, which is not enabled by default. You can use Kdenlive with sudo or kdesu (better within KDE), having root authorisations, to overcome this. If you want to be able to use Kdenlive as a normal user, you can also change the file describing the rules for this.
In a terminal windows do as follows:  &lt;tt&gt;$ sudo &lt;your_favorite_editor&gt;''' /etc/udev/rules.d/40-permissions.rules'''&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Find the line that says:
 KERNEL==&quot;raw1394&quot;,                      GROUP=&quot;disk&quot;
and change it to:
 KERNEL==&quot;raw1394&quot;,                      GROUP=&quot;video&quot;

* This is a security risk, but only when you have firewire storage via the raw1394 module. If you accept this risk, just do it.
* Check also that your user is member of the group &quot;video&quot;
* You might need to reboot.

==Camcorder control seems to work fine, but no video is really captured==
Kdenlive uses dvgrab to capture video. Make sure that you have at least dvgrab version 2.0. You can determine your version by issueing the command &quot;&lt;tt&gt;dvgrab --version&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;  in a terminal window.


&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;!-- Add some empty lines to create some extra whitespace to separate sections --&gt;

='''Video Editing'''=
==How can I copy a clip from the timeline ?==
This can be done by selecting the clip and then drag and drop from the clip monitor into the timeline.&lt;br&gt;
Since Kdenlive 0.4, just use standard copy/paste action.

==How can I split the audio from the video in a clip?==
Since Kdenlive 0.4, right click on a clip and choose &quot;Split audio from selected clip&quot;.&lt;br&gt;
(You can also put a copy of the video clip in an audio track, and then mute (in the effects) the video clip. That way you can de-synchronise audio and video.)

==How do I create a transition?==
[http://kdenlive.sourceforge.net/videos/transitions.ogg Watch this transition tutorial]
(What version of Kdenlive was used in this video clip?)

==How can I create a virtual clip?==
[http://captorials.com/index.php?cmd=showRecording&amp;rec=24 Watch this video tutorial] (You'll need an ogg-enabled mediaplayer)

==What are Guides and Markers and how do I use them?==
[http://kdenlive.sourceforge.net/videos/markers.ogg Watch this video tutorial] (You'll need an ogg-enabled mediaplayer)

==How to work with 16:9 format?==
Make a new project &quot;File / New&quot; and set &quot;Video format&quot; to &quot;PAL 16:9 (720x576)&quot;. It is different than in kino, because kino works only with one track.

==Getting more indices for Volume Effects?==
Volume effect works with keyframes. You can add more keyframes by doing 
Ctrl-click in the clip at the point where you want to add a keyframe. 
Then you can move this keyframe by dragging it with your mouse.
=General=
Where is the kdenlive log of errors?

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Lists==
The truth is that in Coldfusion a list is nothing more than a string separated by a delimiter.  The default delimiter is a comma.  Any delimiter can be used though.For example, ColdFusion Lists:ColdFusion Arrays:ColdFusion Structures is no less a list than the comma delimited list.

'''Creating a list'''
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;cfset newlist = &quot;IL,MO,IA,MN&quot;&gt;
&lt;cfoutput&gt;#newlist#&lt;/cfoutput&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
Output: IL,MO,IA,MN

'''Changing a list'''

LISTAPPEND

Note that these functions do not change the original list but rather their return value is the modified list that must be set to a variable which can be the same one that you began with.
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;cfset newlist = listappend(newlist, &quot;IN&quot;)&gt;
&lt;cfoutput&gt;#newlist#&lt;/cfoutput&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
Output: IL,MO,IA,MN,IN

LISTGETAT
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;cfoutput&gt;#ListGetAt(newlist, 4)#&lt;/cfoutput&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
Output: MN

LISTLEN
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;cfoutput&gt;#ListLen(newlist)#&lt;/cfoutput&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
Output: 5

LISTSETAT
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;cfset newlist = ListSetAt(newlist, 3, &quot;HI&quot;)&gt;
&lt;cfoutput&gt;#newlist#&lt;/cfoutput&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
Output: IL,MO,HI,MN,IN

LISTINSERTAT
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;cfset newlist = ListInsertAt(newlist, 3, &quot;AL&quot;)&gt;
&lt;cfoutput&gt;#newlist#&lt;/cfoutput&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
Output: IL,MO,AL,HI,MN,IN

LISTDELETEAT
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;cfset newlist = ListDeleteAt(newlist, 4)&gt;
&lt;cfoutput&gt;#newlist#&lt;/cfoutput&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
Output: IL,MO,AL,MN,IN

LISTSORT
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;cfset newlist = ListSort(newlist, text)&gt;
&lt;cfoutput&gt;#newlist#&lt;/cfoutput&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
Output: AL,IL,IN,MN,MO

==Arrays==

ColdFusion Arrays are very different than lists and provide many more utilities for manipulation. Arrays are collections of objects all linked together front-to-back.

To create an array, do the following:

&lt;pre&gt;

&lt;cfset myArray = ArrayNew(1)&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;

There are many functions to manipulate Arrays. For instance, to add an item to &lt;i&gt;myArray&lt;/i&gt; you may use the function ArrayAppend().

&lt;pre&gt;

&lt;cfset ArrayAppend(myArray(1), &quot;my first array item&quot;)&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;


===Multi-dimensional Arrays===

==Structures==

ColdFusion structures are similar in many regards to other programming languages. 

&lt;pre&gt;

&lt;cfset picnic = StructNew()&gt;
&lt;cfset picnic.fruits = &quot;apples, oranges, pears&quot;&gt;
&lt;cfset picnic.drinks = &quot;wine, water&quot;&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;

==Queries==

In ColdFusion Queries are a datatype.

&lt;pre&gt;

&lt;cfquery datasource=&quot;mydatabase&quot; name=&quot;myDataQuery&quot;&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;

==CFDUMP==
When working with structures one of the most powerful tools available to you to help debug and solve programming issues is the Cfdump tag.  The Cfdump tag allows you to visually display any variable regardless of its structure type even when you have nested structures.

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;cfdump var=&quot;#mystruct#&quot; expand=&quot;yes&quot;&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
where mystruct is the name of the variable to be displayed.  Take note that mystruct is surrounded by pound signs.  This tag does not take the name of the variable but rather the variable itself.  So if we create code like:
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;cfdump var=&quot;mystruct&quot; expand=&quot;yes&quot;&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
the output would be the string: mystruct
not the values within mystruct.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This policy is rather simplistic, but at the same time it is easily understandable, broadly interpretable, and incredibly forgiving. I don't think we need to get much more specific then this. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:15, 12 July 2006 (UTC)

== Purpose of this policy ==

This policy has been designed to replace the text of several other policies:

*[[Wikibooks:No offensive usernames]]
*[[Wikibooks:No personal attacks]]
*[[Wikibooks:No legal threats]]
*[[Wikibooks:Assume good faith]]
*[[Wikibooks:Profanity]]
*[[Wikibooks:Please do not bite the newcomers]]

Acceptance of this policy does not necessarily constitute a vote to reject any of these other policies. Because there is no contradiction between these policies, it would be perfectly acceptable to enforce this policy in addition to these other policies. Each policy proposal will be judged individually. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 14:48, 11 September 2006 (UTC)

== Move to Enforce ==

I would like to move to enforce the current text of this policy. Under [[Wikibooks:Decision making]], If there are no dissenting opinions by Sunday sept 17th, I would like to move this one to {{tl|enforced}}. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 14:50, 11 September 2006 (UTC)

Johnny wonders...:
#Do we really need this policy? I personally haven't seen much in the way of uncivil behavior on wikibooks :). 
#Is there any reason we can't be civil instead? (No difference really, just more ear-pleasing IMO.)
#Can this really substitute for the above? No legal threats is a foundation thing. No personal attacks really ''is'' one of those things that needs to be clearly spelled out (because the kind of people who make personal attacks are likely the kind of people who are going to say &quot;well, he wasn't nice to me, so why can't I call an ---hole an ---hole (how the f--- did we end up with a profanity rule??? :)). AGF and BITE are good things to be able to refer to when needed (i.e., &quot; Johnny, try not to [[WB:BITE|bite the newbies]], would ya?&quot;), etc. 
#Is making a deadline a good idea? If it's by consensus, then there shouldn't be much reason to cal for a vote. (Though in this case, I'd say it should just be immediately made into a guideline, since ('''Policy violation &amp;rarr;''') only a big jerk would object to this rule ('''&amp;larr; Policy violation'''), ya know :)? IOW, I like the &quot;policy of the week&quot; idea in general, but I don't think a deadline's a great idea, except when it is, like in this case. 
--[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:43, 11 September 2006 (UTC)

::Excellent comments, all. 
:#Do we really need this policy? Well, maybe we don't. However, whether we need it or not, this policy is ''proposed'', and it has been here, undecided upon for some time now. At the very least, this policy deserves a decision one way or the other, and we shouldn't just leave unfinished business sitting around. If you don't think we need this policy, (and hopefully other people will agree with you), then we can move this to '''rejected''', and never have to worry about it again. 
:#The specific wording, so long as the meaning is the same, is irrelevant to me.
:#Can this subsitute for the other policies i listed? Maybe it doesnt, although I like to think that if interpreted broadly enough, it probably can. Keep in mind that the &quot;No legal threats&quot; policy that i listed above has already been ''rejected'', so I don't think it's a &quot;foundation thing&quot;. At least, we don't have a standing version of that policy here on wikibooks. Not biting the newcomers could definately be construde as &quot;being nice&quot; to the newcomers. I pointed out above that acceptance of this policy doesn't necessarily constitute a rejection of any of the others.
:#I instituted this deadline as per my post on staff lounge: I am going to focus my attention on one policy matter per week. If the issue can be decided (and I hope it can be), then we will have our decision without wasting much time. If the issue cannot be decided, it will stay ''proposed'', and I will simply shift my attention to the next proposal in the line. We have alot of unfinished business and undecided proposals sitting around here and there that deserve (a) our full attention and (b) to be decided within a reasonable amount of time. Worst case scenario: We don't make any decisions on any of these policies within the next few weeks, and then we are just back where we started. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:21, 11 September 2006 (UTC)

== name change ==

''&quot;Is there any reason we can't be civil instead? (No difference really, just more ear-pleasing IMO.)&quot;''

:::Like Johnny, I prefer the term civil - otherwise I think it's fine. --[[User:Singkong2005|Singkong2005]] 07:06, 12 September 2006 (UTC)

Okay, i changed the text of the policy to say &quot;civil&quot; instead of &quot;nice&quot;. I am not going to rename the page yet, until a decision is reached. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 12:56, 12 September 2006 (UTC)

By the way, I realize that this is a proposed ''guideline'', not a proposed ''policy''. That distinction may affect some votes. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 12:58, 12 September 2006 (UTC)

There haven't really been enough comments on this one to make it into a guideline quite yet. I am going to leave this one &quot;proposed&quot; for now, and shift my attention to the next &quot;policy of the week&quot;. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:49, 18 September 2006 (UTC)

: Well, I prefer &quot;nice&quot; over &quot;civil&quot;. Where I live, I hear people say &quot;be nice&quot; fairly frequently, but I can't remember the last time I heard anyone say &quot;be civil&quot;.
: How about &quot;Be friendly&quot; ? Or does &quot;Be friendly&quot; need to be an entirely different policy? --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 14:03, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

::I think civil has a more &quot;realistic&quot; ring to it. &quot;Be friendly&quot; sort of reminds me of my (very short lived) stint at a fast-food restautant as a teenager. (Same thing with &quot;be nice&quot;... reminds me too much of the customer service mantra of &quot;hava-nice-day&quot;). We're a community of intellectual volunteers, and we should feel free to disagree vehemently with ideas we disagree with (even to the point of reverting someone's presumably well-thought out contribution), but even when we're tearing each others ideas apart (which isn't nice, and would only be considered friendly when it's among pretty good friends), we can still be civil. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:18, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

=== Keep some of the old policies ===
I generally don't like rules we don't need, so Johnny's point number one above struck a tone. It is, however, quite slim and would be great to have in need. It does, furthermore, replace a number of pretty big ones which I like ... except for [[Wikibooks:Assume good faith]] and [[Wikibooks:Please do not bite the newcomers]]. Neither falls excplicitly under civil behaviour (you can be civil while criminally suspicious, and civility doesn't ask editors to be as caring of newcomers as I find WB:BITE to do) though I'd love to see the former trimmed down. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 02:58, 23 September 2006 (UTC)

=== Guideline vs. Policy ===
I'd like this to be a policy rather than a guideline. I don't see ''any'' scenario at all where one is justified in being uncivil! --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 02:58, 23 September 2006 (UTC)

:You know, that does make a good amount of sense to me. There are no situations where a person should be mean (or not nice, or uncivil) to another person. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 22:56, 24 September 2006 (UTC)

== Name Changed, Enforce? ==

I would like to propose that we make this page an official guideline. I don't think there is support to make it into a policy, although I can't see the harm in doing so. Enforcing this guideline does not represent an endorsement, nor a condemnation of any other policy proposal. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:54, 8 October 2006 (UTC)

: Hmmm ... really? Has there been any opposition to making it a policy? --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 16:22, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

::No particular opposition that I have seen. This mostly represents a final call for people to express opposition before I make this an official guideline. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 16:32, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

::: OK. Consider this an expression of opposition: I'd like it to be a policy. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 16:44, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

*'''Support''' -- as policy. If people are violating this, they should be blocked for a day or two to cool off. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:32, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

Okay, there appears to be support to make this into a policy, and I have seen no dissenting opinions on it whatsoever. I even advertised this on staff lounge, and nobody came in to dissent. I am going to make this one official. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:00, 12 October 2006 (UTC)

== Formatting ==

I just did a formatting edit, splitting a couple of paragraphs and sentences up for (what I consider) readability. I also changed the bold '''Be civil''' to an italic ''Be civil''. I find the latter less of a shouting emphasis. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 06:19, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</text>

Hello, Welcome to Wikibooks!

I see that you've already done some work on the [[Wikibooks:Be civil]] policy, and I think it's great that new users are taking such an interest in pages like this. Typically, new users don't get involved in policy right away. Do you have any experience with other wikimedia projects? If you used to be a wikipedian, we have the [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for wikipedians]] page which can help to explain some of our rules and guidelines for you. If you are not a wikipedian, we don't have a fancy page for you, but we will certainly help nonetheless. If you have any questions, or if you need any help, please don't hesitate to ask me [[User talk:Whiteknight|on my user talk page]]. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:46, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

:I couldn't help but overhear your request to [[User:Xixtas]] (his talk page is on my watchlist). The [[Wikibooks:Be civil]] policy was officially adopted on 12 October 2006. I was the one who actually made the switch, as can be seen from the history page [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks%3ABe_civil&amp;diff=609790&amp;oldid=607649 here]. Prior to accepting this single policy, there were a number of other standing rules and guidelines that were not written down, including some &quot;policy&quot; pages that were actually in the help namespace! This new policy has been a big help in keeping things organized. I hope this answers your question. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:52, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

::I will also take a look into [[Special:Whatlinkshere/Wikibooks:Be_civil]] and will be examining all the circumstances it being referred to.  There are a great many areas to work on with Wikibooks, and this is but one of those areas. Thanks for your help. --[[User:NoJonny|NoJonny]] 23:06, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

I don't have anything ready to share as far as the essay I am working on. When I do, I'll be sure to let you know. As far as the ongoing dispute, I recommend staying as far away from it as possible. --[[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 04:11, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</text>

{{essay}}
{{TOC right}}
General decisions and global policies on Wikibooks can only be decided by the community in a specific and recognized way that is by &quot;Community consensus&quot;, this requires only that no state of objection is expressed, it supports abstention and may include comments by users that may even chose not to express their agreement or disagreement with a specific proposal that is put forward for community discussion and approval, with some punctual exception that are illustrated below.

This method of making decisions and the right of equal participation are the political basis of the Wikibooks project.

== Community consensus ==
Community consensus is an integral part and the core of the decision process on Wikibooks as stated in the  [[Wikibooks:Decision making]] guideline (there is an unstable version still to be finalized, feel free to participate) and defined [[Wikibooks:Decision_making#Community_consensus|there]].

Community consensus or &quot;the expression of the community will&quot; is open to any Wikibook's user (Wikibookian) and even unregistered users, except blocked users (due to the nature of the effect of the block action, not by stated policy/guideline). There are also subjects that the [[Wikibooks:Decision making]] states as being outside of a consensus decision making process, they are expressly defined as part (but not all) of the [[Wikibooks:Decision_making#Low_impact_decisions|Low impact decisions]] section of the policy.

Community consensus is by default the way any decision is made on the Wikibooks project and is what Wikibookias should expect on any non regulated process of decision-making any other way to pass decisions is a direct violation of the [[Wikibooks:Decision making]] policy. We should be careful to note that a provision is given to '''be bold''', but any action taken on that exception should be reverted if anyone raises objections.

=== [http://www.answers.com/main/ntquery?s=consensus&amp;go_button.x=0&amp;go_button.y=0 Consensus] ===

The problem with the word '''consensus''' has been discussed several times before on Wikibooks. The good aspect of Wikibooks not being a democracy is that it it would turn Wikibooks into a project dominated by the active and powerful, being them an active minority or a voting majority since participation is voluntary, and only a fraction of all registered users are active at a given time, due to this facts, the best procedure for closing decisions should be based on the quality of arguments resulting in no active opposition. In any case what is important to understand is that the decision process should not consist only in applying a voting (or a substitute) mechanism. In reality, voting even if needed to establish positions, is one of the least significant parts of the process of consensus, the task of finding a common ground is, that can only be obtained by making everyone work together in good faith to achieve a desirable outcome for the group (see [[Wikibooks:Assume good faith]]). There are many ways consensus decision-making may be applied it can even have  different guidelines and frameworks (see Wikipedia article on [[w:Consensus decision-making|Consensus relating to decision-making]]), due to historical reasons and from the text of the approved policy that defines it, the Consensus decision-making on Wikibooks is a process that not only seeks the agreement of most participants, but also try to resolve or mitigate the objections of the minority to achieve the most agreeable decision by compromise, even if the policy text gives an escape route that can cause confusion and is at times contradictory, the process has (as I will demonstrate) reasons to be strictly followed and restarted if consensus cannot be reached. 

[[Image:Consensus-flowchart.png|300px|center|Flowchart of basic consensus decision-making process.]]

Any deviation or objection that prevents the reaching of consensus can only have two outcomes, a block or a breaking of the consensus process that will result in majority rule voting (the first can be resolved with dialog and is fostered by the Wikibook project, the last should be highly contested as it results in an illegitimate decision on the eyes of the community, unless the core rules are changed or state an exception that in itself was agreed by consensus that the opposition can be dismissed if the majority doesn't feel the opposing point as well defined or argued for, this view has somewhat redefined consensus on Wikibooks and the pure form has been re-branded &quot;strict&quot; consensus, not to be confused with unanimous consent).

There are many ways to run a decision-making process and consensus has his faults. It may be a very time consuming process but the goal is near Utopian, in the end all parties will be satisfied or at least appeased. I note also the consensus and unanimity aren't contradictory (they aren't the same), there can be unanimity under a consensual decision. Consensus does not mean 100% expressed or implied agreement on a specific point, but an acceptance to decision without open objections (a 0% expression of opposition to the decision), a vote by majority is defined from a 51% to 99% expression of agreement to a decision and supports active objections up to 1% to the result, more important no compromise is needed to bypass any opposition below 51% to pass (50% is a tie) in the end consensus is inclusive, majority is exclusive to participants.

:''' ''It takes too long...'' '''
Consensus can get delayed and be attacked as a way to reach decisions. Since the process will always be slower that any alternative, for instance in a vote for majority, opposing positions are generally discarded. In a process for consensus time has to be used to discuss minority positions, in fact slow speed in the process demonstrates the will to reach a compromise.

If the objective is to clear thing out and let contradictory views on a subject to reach unanimity or to permit compromise in consensus, attacks or exclusion of participants claiming time constrains should be addressed by proposing that a consensus on a resolution is of utmost importance even if there are disagreements, most reasonable persons would agree to abstain if shown that continued objection will result in a greater loss to all.

:''' ''then long term blocks are disruptive...'' '''
{{SAMPLE|sampletext=
''...stubborn insistence on an eccentric position, with refusal to consider other viewpoints in good faith, is not justified under Wikipedia's consensus practice.''|caption=from [[w:Consensus|Wikipedia:Consensus]]}}

Disruptive behavior can be observed in regards to the use of consensus, but if participants are really willing to compromise and work for a greater objective than to just abuse of the block power they have, rewards can be greater than the problems, you will get a less accommodating participation and raise interest to the core issues, diversity can be a strength, if the time is granted for everyone to express their views, more information is shared, and better solutions can be found. 

A user that is only blocking a decision only because he can will not really be willing to participate in the greater good of the overall project, with time he will tire and lose arguments. If his position is not justifiable and can be acted upon to progress in the decision process, it becomes clear that he intents a permanent block, only by power of argumentation and by how the process is run, how fair it is, can the block be bypassed (&quot;the good of the many outweighing the good of a few&quot;).

{{TODO|other problems with consensus and possible solutions if any ...&lt;br&gt;Add suspension or cooling-off period is another potential as an possible outcome to a block decision - idea advanced by Xixtas}}

:''' ''but then... but if...'' '''
In no way a decision blocking user should have his opinion dismissed without the others voters stating at least justifiable reasons to do so based on the facts that would press the closing of the decision-making process, solutions should always be found before excluding a user from the process, for instance votes on sub-sections of the proposal, elaborating for instance a guiding rule that after a given timeframe of block the majority would have his way, a specific ratio of votes in favor/against, exclusion of the objecting and in favor users from a number future discussions, etc...

As should be clear the changing of the decision-making process on Wikibooks should be objected to, as it will have a very high degree of impact on users that have joined the project under a different set of rules and expectations, this second to the license used on the Wikibooks project, should be heavily protected and any changes to this policy or the decision-making process will have to be reached by consensus, it is up to you (Wikibookian) to protect your rights and the community expectations.

:''' ''people are pressing me...  ''...for information...'' ''...to change position...''  '''
Any decision process is a political processes (even monarchies and dictatorships) involve some sort of negotiation as it attempts to establish common ground, to change view points and influence others, any of this actions will require a good level of mutual understanding. People are not pressuring, they are attempting to be understood and understand each-others positions.

To formulate an opinion everyone requires a reason, an augmentation that they can understand. Only then can they chose among alternatives.

In a process where ones view is a minority there are tree routes:
*Establish that the minority view has grater value and gather support for it.
*Attempt to reach a compromise at middle ground.
*Concede to a move to non-opposition.
 
Stating that one is being pressed is a evasion, since in our project no-one has any power over the other, the value is on the arguments. It does in fact demonstrate that others are willing to address your position, the alternative would be to ignore it or a permanent block on the discussion.

==== [http://www.answers.com/main/ntquery?s=rough+consensus&amp;go_button.x=0&amp;go_button.y=0 Rough consensus] and other redefinitions ====
Recently we are witnessing the increasingly utilization of words not due to the positive value of the idea or concept a word represents but only because of the varnish or implication it can provide to the context it is used in, this is a result of increasing levels o marketing, publicity and public relations campaigns we now face everyday, appearance is everything. Take for example the use of consensus in this new world of sharing, equality and participation, words are used not to express facts but to sweeten or to soften otherwise more hash or compromising phrases, that was mostly known as twisting the words in the past and now is more to be ''politically correct'' or ''to give a spin on the subject'', for example take the flowing &quot;some areas are becoming consensual among most writers&quot; (is a contradiction of terms, I can only see this as an attempt to be obtuse since it transmits an idea of general agreement, and impart a wrong conclusion, an exact variation but not so pleasant would be &quot;some writes are starting to agree in some areas&quot;, but this will give emphasis to the split that exists).

Recently (in terms of the time the word is used), IETF coined the term &quot;rough consensus&quot;, it is an erosion of the word to permit a politically correct way to impart the &quot;sense of the group&quot; on the &quot;dominant view&quot;, the terms is yet to be adopted into general use, the results of this type of erosion gives place to the appearance to sub/supra definitions like &quot;genuine consensus&quot; or &quot;strict consensus&quot; as a way to show a difference to the various interpretations, basically there is only a form of consensus that can exist and function from discussions from 1 to 1 to other more complex implementations (a French philosopher postulated that a limit exist, he stipulated that to be the size of a city's population, but with technology and the evolution of city sizes things have indeed changed, so who can say until it is tried), any attempt to give a level to the word can't work as the meaning is absolute, participation of all on a common accepted solution, restrictions or instructions  on how we make that happen are &quot;not included&quot;, it originally was meant to be used by people with good intentions.

Take for example a very common phrase, &quot;consensual sex&quot; can it survive the substitution for a decision by rough consensus? I think not, since the result to bypassing the objection would be disastrous to the objector. By eroding the use of the word the final objective is only to keep the appearance of consensus but in reality another process is used. Since sole justification by numbers is not relevant (not even on the Wikibooks context, as it should be the process that guides even user to user discussions), ultimately this kind of solution should be avoided. 

===== Participation ===== 
By taking look at [[Special:Statistics]] (read counter is turned off) we should also take into consideration the number of users vs the number of voters there is no direct representation, sock puppets (in many guises) do exist, by using consensus we are escaping the &quot;tyranny of the majority&quot;, how we proceed to escape the will of the minority is by strength of arguments as we already have the strength in numbers.

No one or even any group can claim to know the understanding or will of the community, as an example administrators can't call themselves representatives of that will or views.

{{SAMPLE|sampletext=
''Wikipedia's decisions are based not on the numerical fact of how many people showed up and voted a particular way. It is based on a system of good reasons.''|caption=from [[w:Consensus|Wikipedia:Consensus]]}}

====== Dodging the &quot;vote&quot; option ======
When not expressly required by policy, polling (voting) on a subject should be avoided, using it is accepting that consensus has failed...

*Polling discourages consensus
*Polling encourages false dichotomy
*Polling encourages group-think
*Polling isn't fair, either

The clear propose of asking for votes on a subject is to create a divide, build and establish a power position, majority versus minority opinion and ultimately is an attempt force an issue even if that was not the intention the result would be the creation of another barrier to the freedom of expressing divergent opinions.
The best option is to clarify were you stand and what you propose and ask for objection, non constructive support will be as bad as objecting without any valid reason.

The Abilene paradox (Wikipedia article on [[w:Abilene paradox|the Abilene paradox on consensus decision]]) deserves a special mention on this essay, due to the specificity of the Wikibooks project, its objectives and the expectations that Wikibookians have more than other project's users (i.e., Wikipedia).

== Decisions ==
a Wikibookian personal judgment shouldn't be the base for the application of the rules on Wikibooks, decisions must be consistent and shared by all and this is impossible on that a basic level, it should be the last way we implement and enforce policies and if contested open to reevaluation.

; Best practices to employ on a discussion:
*'''Remove obstacles so you can be understood'''
** Be prepared, research, by pointing to old posts, archives, articles or web sites or even guidelines or policies you advance and reinforce your view point without restating what can be obvious to same and unknown to others, try to find inconsistencies that give credit to you challenge. You must remember that users may not share your knowledge or the history behind the problem.
*'''Try to be exact and complete on the point or proposal you advance'''
** If you fail to state your point correctly, other users may disagree with you due to misinterpretation.
*'''Give options, don't be intransigent'''
** If you provide several solution to a given problem, you will be showing you openness to compromise even if you state the weaknesses of that options, this will make it easier for others to reach a common ground with you.
*'''Give a direction to the discussion'''
** Avoid that participation on the discussion goes in directions beyond the intended scope, even if positive ideas are advanced stay on the topic, it is common to get news ideas from a discussion but you shouldn't try to cover all issues at once, propose that another discussion should be started on that topic (don't kill ideas without proposing to address them), this is even more important if you were not the one generating them.
*'''Do no make assumptions, ask'''
**Try to avoid assuming you can read the minds of the participants, even worse state what you think others feel on the subject, this can get you in a lot of trouble and extend the discussion further, just ask and get a statement you can point to.
*'''Build consensus, don't split the discussion between &quot;us&quot; and &quot;them&quot;'''
**Try to get what participants agree and disagree without creating groups, if groups form, getting to a common ground is harder because a group tend to support its members even beyond logic, try to get the accepted points about the topic and build bridges on what people don't agree with.
*'''State who you are'''
**Make your intentions clear, most people don't know each other and is pretty common to have users that never interacted before on a discussion, do not try to validate your points by intentionally hide information (if found out the value of your opinion will be affected), do not expect other to recognize you as a more important participant on the decission (even if you think you know more about the subject), who you are in not as important as what you write on the discussion.
*'''Do not be picky'''
**Don't attack participants on spelling or harass others because they disagree with you, ask them to validate their points don't overanalyze every statement or word, you must take things into context and people are prone to commit errors. In doubt ask but you must give some consideration to the questions you make, in doubt try to research the subject.
*'''Be consistent'''
**If you change your mind you should point it out, if you committed an error correct it as soon as you detect it and admit to it, remember that people if informed will also validate your opinion based on previous discussions or actions you took, what you write and do is the best introduction you can bring with you to a new discussion and to be understood, if you go from 8 to 80 and back again without any visible reason it will make it difficult for people to take you seriously. 

; Proposals
Any proposal must be stated on Wikibooks, public knowledge to Wikibokians and should stand for at least 7 days to give a chance to get input from users, no timelimit should be assumed if not stated on the text (and validated as urgent) of the same proposal or as a clear part of the discussion to all participants.

=== Types of discussions ===
There are many types of discussions going around on Wikibooks at the same time, it hard to try to participate in all, so you must select what are the points that &lt;u&gt;can&lt;/u&gt; and &lt;u&gt;need&lt;/u&gt; to be defended, if you can't get involved a simple word of support to  a person that is defending a similar point can do a lot of good, most people tend to forget that all pages are publicly accessible and referenced.

Discussions can vary in numbers of participations and on the importance of the discussion, one thing to avoid is having discussions of specific points on the wrong forum, if that happens don't forget to point it out to participants and make a post on the best location informing of what his happening this will serve as a reference to future discussions and prevent rehashing some points by using references. (Wikibookians are selective on what pages they monitor using the [[Special:Watchlist|Watchlist page]], see also the [[Help:Tracking changes]] for more resources). 

Most common discussion occur between single users on the various talk pages, on the staff lounge (or sub modules) and on specific policy/guidelines or (draft) talk pages, books with a significant participation of contributors also may have active debates (but it is not very common) there are policies that request participation on the decision process from all Wikibookinas  as a way to have an better understanding of the community will on specific subjects, examples are: 

; Examples (may not be a complete list)
* [[Wikibooks:Featured books/Nominations]]
**to make decision regarding books which are considered among the best of what has been written in an effort to raise standards
* [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion]]
**to make decision regarding pages/books/modules marked with for deletion.
* [[Wikibooks:Requests for adminship]]
**to make decision regarding granting administrator status to Wikibookians.
{{NOTE|Most of the above pages have a specific and formal way to validate participation and opinions, they may even state restrictions on decision by consensus, if so they should also be listed on [[Wikibooks:Decision making]] as exceptions to the default}}

; What distinguishes guidelines from policies ?

Guidelines are things that people ''should'' do, policies are things that people ''must'' do. Guidelines are not enforcible, but that isn't expressly written anywhere, if we take in consideration [[Template:Enforced]] it makes more clear as does [[Template:guideline]], that is the intention expressed on the voting for the proposals at least so far...

People can break guidelines if they have good reasons to but bad behavior is not a valid justification to ignore a guideline (just because you can it doesn't mean you do), by breaking a guideline you could be almost certain that someone will object to the action, if you must be clear on why you did it.

Should doesn't give enforcible power to punish or revert actions or impose the fallowing of the text in general terms it is merely a guide, if we take the text of [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines]] it only defines policies as enforcible it even states them as essential (no similar regard is given to guidelines) in '''Enforcing policies''', I think we also do this for historical purposes I never saw no one defend that guidelines should be enforced or that they have, if a guideline has the need to be it is voted as a policy.

[[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines]] also state:&lt;br&gt;
*'''Must''' This word, or the terms &quot;required&quot; or &quot;shall&quot;, mean that the definition is an absolute requirement of the policy or guideline.&lt;br&gt;(this gives the community the authority to enforce)&lt;br&gt;
*'''Should''' This word, or the adjective &quot;recommended&quot;, mean that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore a particular guideline, but the full implications must be understood and carefully weighed before choosing a different course.&lt;br&gt;(this gives the burden of the evaluation to the one that is performing action against what is stated, the user is even given the power to ignore it and is asked to perform a good assessment of his action, and any one in the community are asked to consider any violations in light of the results being positive or not)
All consider the a state of good intention from the operator.

Policies and Guidelines have been under discussion since at least February 2005 and no stated challenge was given to this interpretation and the concept has popped up on discussion along the way, so, this is commonly accepted distinction we use.

==== Guidelines ====
A guideline by definition is a guide that has the intention to express or indicate a course of action or guidance to appropriate behavior or a common base of interpretation, it is only targeted to the user seeking information on how to proceed (in the case of Wikibooks this information is first agreed upon by Wikibookians as valid). If a guideline has the need to be enforcible it is proposed as policy or is turned into one.

Guidelines shall not be summarily dismissed or be considered irrelevant, intentionally breaking a guideline should constitute a show of bad faith and an attempt to stress the community. If a guideline is broken even if unintentionally it entitles any  Wikibookians to act as to correct the issue (even if the same that originated the transgression) to initiate a community decision process to establish the validity of the action, the best location to do this is the relevant guideline talk page, and should require at least an opposition or supporting position by another Wikibookian, to give validation to the process, so to prevent unilateral redefinition of the guideline text or abuse of the same.

==== Policies ====
A policy is a rule or regulation set by Wikibookians to be enforced by all, it gives indeed power of action to all in its defense.

Well that is a specific case, but lets examine it carefully, should even a specific block be decided by community decision, it is my view that it should be actively avoided, for instance you don't have in your country laws that specifically apply to an single individual, and even targeting specific groups is done with some care, there are also separation of powers, executive from judiciary etc. and a trial is moved outside of a jurisdiction if justice can't be assured and other cases that address the same problem of mob justice and abuse of power. Policies on wikibooks should be generic and even avoid specific groups of users or cause differentiation among them (in reasonable cases, some specific uses are and need to be used, like, policies that only apply to administrators etc), by all means specify arbitrations or study groups, but having community decisions of very specific points doesn't help and is misleading and will only provide fodder for conflicts. (if you know how decisions are being made in the last months you would understand my objections more deeply but consider what I have said)

About reaching consensus taking to long, we can't do much about it (if we intend to stick with it) due to technical limitations and the social structure that is the best way decisions can be made on wikibooks (and other wikimedia projects) any alteration (as has been going around) to this method will only provide and erode the legitimacy of the decision, time is essential to reach consensus the only acceptable way to step outside of it is in rare cases that indecision would be by acceptable by majority (we could even use also consensus on a specific point on urgency or priority) due to time constraint that would cause grave harm to the project, works or users. (I have even read somewhere that objection to the majority could be reason to block a person on the ground of incivility due to allegation of bad faith, this is how by seeming &quot;politically correct&quot; decisions and use of policies is being justified)

In relation to the puppeteer or sock puppets, since you by now understand that is impossible to determine who are the puppets (we can even be talking about human puppets, lets say a group of users that work in coordination to reach a given goal), as we can't do anything why define a policy that is enforcible and will probably cause more problems than it could possible address, I would agree if you changed the text to the specific case of a blocked user, but you should have realized also by now, that this &lt;s&gt;also&lt;/s&gt; can't be prevented (only if the puppeteer identifies his puppets) and as you have seen, no attempt to require a entire process of reaching consensus for each of the sock puppets was taken or allowed (what in my view is also wrong, as for instance how would you be able to protect innocents ?), in specific due to use of dynamic IPs by some ISPs if you block a user or a range  you will be not only targeting that user but several &quot;possible&quot; users.

== Trademark discussion ==

Hi, apologies for posting this in English, but I wanted to alert your community to a discussion on Meta about potential changes to the Wikimedia Trademark Policy. Please translate this statement if you can. We hope that you will all participate in the discussion; we also welcome translations of the legal team’s statement into as many languages as possible and encourage you to voice your thoughts there. Please see the [[:m:Trademark practices discussion|Trademark practices discussion (on Meta-Wiki)]] for more information.

== Call for comments on draft trademark policy ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hi all, 

The Wikimedia legal team invites you to participate in the development of the new Wikimedia trademark policy.

The [[:wmf:Trademark policy|current trademark policy]] was introduced in 2009 to protect the [[:wmf:Wikimedia trademarks|Wikimedia marks]]. We are now updating this policy to better balance permissive use of the marks with the legal requirements for preserving them for the community. The new draft trademark policy is ready for your review [[:m:Trademark policy|here]], and we encourage you to discuss it [[:m:Talk:Trademark policy|here]].

We would appreciate if someone would translate this message into your language so more members of your community can contribute to the conversation.

Thanks, &lt;br /&gt;

== Universal Language Selector will be enabled by default again on this wiki by 21 February 2014 ==

&lt;div class=&quot;mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
On January 21 2014 the MediaWiki extension [[mw:Universal Language Selector|Universal Language Selector]] (ULS) was [[mw:Universal Language Selector/Announcement Jan2014|disabled]] on this wiki. A new preference was added for logged-in users to turn on ULS. This was done to prevent slow loading of pages due to ULS webfonts, a behaviour that had been observed by the Wikimedia Technical Operations team on some wikis. 

We are now ready to enable ULS again. The temporary preference to enable ULS will be removed. A [[commons:File:ULS-font-checkbox.png|new checkbox]] has been added to the Language Panel to enable/disable font delivery. This will be unchecked by default for this wiki, but can be selected at any time by the users to enable webfonts. This is an interim solution while we improve the feature of webfonts delivery.

You can read the [[mw:Universal Language Selector/Announcement Feb2014|announcement]] and the [[mw:Universal Language Selector/Upcoming Development Plan|development plan]] for more information. Apologies for writing this message only in English. Thank you. [[m:User_talk:Runab WMF|Runa]]

''I apologize if this message is not in your language. Please help translate it.''

Do you have an idea for a project that could improve your community? [[m:Grants:IEG|Individual Engagement Grants]] from the Wikimedia Foundation help support individuals and small teams to organize experiments for 6 months. You can get funding to try out your idea for online community organizing, outreach, tool-building, or research to help make {{SITENAME}} better. In March, we’re looking for new project proposals. 

Examples of past Individual Engagement Grant projects:
*[[m:Grants:IEG/Build_an_effective_method_of_publicity_in_PRChina|Organizing social media for Chinese Wikipedia]] ($350 for materials) 
*[[m:Grants:IEG/Visual_editor-_gadgets_compatibility|Improving gadgets for Visual Editor]] ($4500 for developers)
*[[m:Grants:IEG/The_Wikipedia_Library|Coordinating access to reliable sources for Wikipedians]] ($7500 for project management, consultants and materials)
*[[m:Grants:IEG/Elaborate_Wikisource_strategic_vision|Building community and strategy for Wikisource]] (€10000 for organizing and travel)

'''[[m:Grants:IEG#ieg-applying|Proposals]] are due by 31 March 2014.''' There are a number of ways to [[m:Grants:IEG|get involved]]! 

Hope to have your participation,

In response to the message asking me to introduce myself: Elizabeth Penrose. I've had a few of my [SF/Fantasy/Genre] poems published, and you can find some of them on the web.

== Automatic PDF/ePUB download links (or collection shortcut) ==

At the moment, generating an ePUB ebook can only be done by manually adding each page of the book to a collection (which can be an error-prone process if you miss subpages) and downloading the resulting ePUB file from the collection manager.

For PDF files, some books seem to have had their PDF generated and uploaded as a static file (I gather this from the URL of said files). Which would mean that the PDF file becomes obsolete after the first edition of the book.

What would be the technical difficulty of having at least a link that gets the user to the collection manager pre-filled with the pages? Also, a few links for the most obvious choices in options would be great, at least 1-column PDF and ePUB.

--[[User:Nowhere man|Nowhere man]] ([[User talk:Nowhere man|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Nowhere man|contribs]]) 13:15, 14 March 2014 (UTC)

I'm a little confused by your question. When I look at, for example, the [[German]] Wikibook,
all the way at the bottom on the right side it says &quot;This book has a collection&quot;
that already has &quot;a link that gets the user to the collection pre-filled with the pages&quot;.

== Changes to the default site typography coming soon ==

&lt;div lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot; class=&quot;mw-content-ltr&quot;&gt; 
This week, the typography on Wikimedia sites will be updated for all readers and editors who use the default &quot;Vector&quot; skin. This change will involve new serif fonts for some headings, small tweaks to body content fonts, text size, text color, and spacing between elements. The schedule is: 

* '''April 1st''': non-Wikipedia projects will see this change live
* '''April 3rd''': Wikipedias will see this change live

This change is very similar to the &quot;Typography Update&quot; Beta Feature that has been available on Wikimedia projects since November 2013. After several rounds of testing and with feedback from the community, this Beta Feature will be disabled and successful aspects enabled in the default site appearance. Users who are logged in may still choose to use another skin, or alter their [[Special:MyPage/vector.css|personal CSS]], if they prefer a different appearance. Local [[MediaWiki:Common.css|common CSS]] styles will also apply as normal, for issues with local styles and scripts that impact all users. 

For more information:

* [[mw:Talk:Typography refresh|Discussion page]] for feedback or questions

== Tagging Other Pages ==

Sorry I'm quite new to Wikibooks and I apologise if this is a stupid question.

Basically we are doing a page for Technological Determinism. We are the only group doing this and thus we have been asked to engage with other groups.

I was wondering if there was a way in which we can hyperlink our page from pages that can be attributed to Technological Determinism.

Does anyone know if this can be done?

I'd be grateful of any help.

:Looking at what you've just written on [[North Carolina/History]] seems like the way to go.  One extra thing might be to put the years in brackets, e.g. Civil War (1860-1865).

I come from the English Wikipedia, though I am also active on Commons.  I've been adding a few things to the Bartending guide.

Welcome to the '''Projects reading room'''. On this page, Wikibookians can talk about subjects related to books, book projects, and other tasks here on Wikibooks that require discussion and organization.

== Rrion ==

The their route was disconnected near Rion. The range of the Reps is limited, over 50. They might cooperate, but only if we provide the support for them, this is not possible at this level, but if we rebuild NEW Atlantis (beta), it's a different story, otherwise they will probably retaliate to cover their own ass. I believe they have done this 5 times. Also the reps are based at spio, they can not leave the base, but they have access to the tech, it is their source code.

== New guy here; apparently here is where I say what interests me ==

Well, this is weird; my interests appear to be the same as Daddou einstein's (below).  I'm a college student double majoring in Computer Science and Near Eastern Languages and Civilization (mainly studying Arabic).  I love both topics and I really dig free information on the internet, so I'm mainly here to add what I can to flesh out the Arabic wikibook.

&lt;br /&gt;

Import of a public domain text, from archive.org, rebuild formatting of 'academic stuff'; ie.see https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Snakes_of_Europe/Habits, this should be fully legible, but it is not now formatted for printing.

Import all species info from Wikipedia, with photos and ID tips.
ie. https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Snakes_of_Europe/Species/Typhlops_vermicularis

Here we have a new 'field guide', info book, or academic refence text. Then we can work on updating the academic work of Boulenger

== Good title for a book on a Perl (CPAN) package? ==

I’m working towards a possible release of my command-line MediaWiki tools, and given that there are also other such tools which I may also decide to document at some later point, I’ve decided to broaden the topic a bit, and tentatively entitled it [[User:Ivan Shmakov/Command-line MediaWiki tools|Command-line MediaWiki tools.]]

Now, however, these tools rely on the yet to be released MediaWiki::API2 [[w:CPAN|CPAN]] package, which I wish to document on Wikibooks just as well.  The difference is that, however, I have no plans on documenting any other similar packages for Perl (especially given that they seem to already have a decent documentation on their own), and thus would prefer a wikibook dedicated to this particular package only.  (At the least until someone else chooses to cover the others.)

The question is: what’d be a good title for such a book?  Apparently, ''MediaWiki::API2 Perl module'' is not considered a valid title by the software, ''MediaWiki-API2 CPAN distribution'' looks a bit cryptic, and something like ''Interfacing MediaWiki with MediaWiki::API2 from Perl'' is probably way too verbose.

Any suggestions?

TIA.

Hello! I am very unexperienced with wikipedia and I have little to no knowledge on how to do things here. I'm mainly interested in science, mathematics, and philosphy, and I contribute to wikipedia in my free time. I'm here mainly because I like contributing and learning. So if I'm doing something wrong, please let me know.  [[User:MisterRogors|MisterRogors]] ([[User talk:MisterRogors|discuss]])

: Hi, [[User:MisterRogors|MisterRogors]].
: A tip that may help you make sense out of things.  The word you actually want there is ''wikimedia'' rather than ''wikipedia''.  That's because wikipedia is just one of several sister projects in the wikimedia family.  This sister here, where we are now, is Wikibooks; we write textbooks here.  Wikipedia, [[w:|over there]], writes encyclopedia articles.  And there are other sisters too, of course:  [[wikt:|Wiktionary]] is a dictionary (not just of English words &amp;mdash; it gives definitions of words in all the world's languages.  [[wikt:|Wikinews]] writes news articles (with its own unique challenges and rewards).  And so on.
: Knowing that will probably help you make more sense out of the welcome messages of the different sisters:  each sister has a different welcome message, that tells you stuff about that sister, but may be a little different, or sometimes a lot different, from how things work on the other sisters.  (I see you've already gotten a welcome on your user talk page here at Wikibooks.  Welcome!).
: (A trick to keep in mind, btw:  if you sign your message with three tildes (&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;) it'll sign just your name, like your sig above; four tildes will produce your name and the time and date when you signed.)  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 10:53, 5 April 2014 (UTC)

:Unfortunately the majority of people at Wikibooks find themselves working alone. You will get help in terms of copy-editing, etc., but in terms of new content creation you are unlikely to find someone to help out with substantial contributions. Typically they want to work on their own book. One option to get you started is to identify articles on Wikipedia that can be incorporated with some revision into your book. These can then be imported (via a request at [[WB:RFI]], do not just copy / paste the material). The best example of a book started like this recently is [[Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant: The WikiBook]] where we imported about 50 articles to create the base material.

==Enhancing a Published Bibliography through Social Editing: is this the right place?==


May I seek your opinion on the appropriateness of creating a Wikibooks edition of an academic research work we are about to publish?

''In the Lands of the Romanovs''  by Anthony Cross is a large annotated bibliography of over 1200 English-language accounts of the Russian Empire written during the period 1613-1917. The title is published by Open Book Publishers under a CC BY license, is freely available to read and download (in HTML format) from the OBP website, and will also be made freely available from outlets such as Google Books, [http://www.worldreader.org/ Worldreader] etc. The book is also available in printed hardback and paperback editions and in various e-book formats, all of which will be retailed from our own and other sites (e.g. Amazon).

We (Open Book Publishers) would like to create a socially enhanced version of the book, and encourage readers to add new entries and create links to existing resources. In this way we believe that the content of this wide-ranging and ambitious work could be made even more comprehensive and useful for the scholarly community. We see Wikibooks as the perfect place for an edition of this kind, following in the footsteps of other social editing projects like ''[[The Devonshire Manuscript]]''.

Before loading the work onto Wikibooks, however, we want to seek your feedback, and know whether you feel this is appropriate. In alternative, we are planning to create a private wiki on our own website, but we would much prefer to host the title here!

If you wish to have a look at the book, you can visit [http://www.openbookpublishers.com/wiki/index.php?title=In_the_Lands_of_the_Romanovs_by_Anthony_Cross  this page]. Please note that this is just a prototype, provisionally built to test conversion into [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki_markup wiki markup], and that some minor parts of the book are still missing (front matters, introduction, bibliography and index). The HTML edition of the complete work can also be viewed from [http://openbookpublishers.com/htmlreader/978-1-78374-057-4/main.html our website].

Lastly, some background about Open Book Publishers. We are a non-profit, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access Open Access] publisher, committed to making high-quality research freely available to readers around the world. Founded by academics we have now published over 40 titles in the humanities and social sciences – all of which are free to read and download from our website. We have already loaded [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Oral_Literature_in_the_Digital_Age:_Archiving_Orality_and_Connecting_with_Communities one of our books] onto [https://en.wikisource.org Wikisource], which however does not allow social editing of texts.

== Teach me how to write equations ==

I have recently started contributing to a text here and would like to add some mathematical equations. I am not sure exactly how to do that though. Should I do the equations in microsoft word's equation software and then save it as a jpg, then upload it. Or is there a better way?

== Wikitext ==

Hi, I'm new to wikibooks and was wondering if there is something anyone would be able to link me to that would give me an overall summary of how 'wikitext' works. I'm catching on to little bits, such as how to make a sub-heading and how to sign my username but just need a little bit of help with how the rest of it works! Thank you.

== Images to links ==

Quick question, I hope.  I have a gallery of images on [[Wikijunior:Europe]].  I would like it so that if somebody clicks on the image it will take them to the page for that country rather than the image itself.  So if you were to click on the Eiffel Tower image you'd end up on the France page.  Is this easy to do?--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 00:47, 1 May 2014 (UTC)

'''Treatment of patients with pacemakers and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs)'''

==AAPM Task Group 34==
AAPM Report No. 45 ([http://www.aapm.org/pubs/reports/rpt_45.pdf PDF]) - &quot;Management of Radiation Oncology Patients with Implanted Cardiac Pacemakers&quot; (Reprinted from Medical Physics, Vol. 21, Issue 1) (1994)

Recommendations:
# Pacemaker implanted patients should not be treated with a betatron (''okay...'')
# Pacemakers should not be placed in the direct (unshielded) therapy beam. Some accelerator beams can cause transient malfunction.
# The absorbed dose to be received by the pacemaker should be estimated before treatment. 
# If the total estimated dose to the pacemaker might &gt; 2 gray, the pacemaker function should be checked prior to therapy and possibly at the start of each following week of therapy. Since total and abrupt failure of pacemakers has been seen at cumulative doses between 10 - 30 Gy and significant functional changes have been observed between 2 - 10 Gy, early changes in pacemaker parameters could signal a failure in the 2-10 Gy region.
# Although transient malfunction from electromagnetic interference is unlikely from contemporary therapy accelerators and cobalt irradiators, the patient should be closely observed during the first treatment with a linear accelerator and during subsequent treatments if magnetron or klystron misfiring (sparking) occurs.
# Studies to date have dealt with linear accelerators, betatrons, and cobalt irradiators only. Use of other radiation therapy machines should be evaluated on an individual basis and approached with caution.

{{wikipedia|Turkish language#Vowel harmony}}
Like [[Hungarian]], [[Finnish]], and the Turkic languages (of which Turkish is a part), the Turkish language makes use of a concept called vowel harmony. The vowels in most, if not all Turkish grammatical constructs are selected depending on the type of vowel that precedes the construct. There are three distinctions that classify Turkish vowels. First they are either rounded or unrounded, reflecting the shape of the lips when speaking them. Second, vowels may be closed or open, depending on the position of the mouth. Finally, they may be classified as back or front vowels, based on the placement of the sound in the mouth. The vowel classifications are summarized below.

{| {{Turkish/Table|columns=5}}
|-
! rowspan=2| || colspan=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center; font-weight: bold&quot;| Front || colspan=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center; font-weight: bold&quot;| Back

|-
! style=&quot;text-align: center; font-weight: bold&quot;| Close
| {{Turkish/Letter|i}} || {{Turkish/Letter|ü}} || {{Turkish/Letter|ı}} || {{Turkish/Letter|u}} 
|-
|}

== Vowel harmony ==
Turkish has a two-dimensional, vowel-harmony system. Vowels are characterised by two features, or rules. These rules do not apply to all Turkish words. You should, however, know the rules in order to add suffixes properly, which is based on the vowels in the word.
=== Front/back harmony ===
{{Turkish/Box|In short:|Front vowels ({{Turkish/Letter|e}}, {{Turkish/Letter|i}}, {{Turkish/Letter|ö}}, {{Turkish/Letter|ü}}) are followed by front vowels, back vowels ({{Turkish/Letter|a}}, {{Turkish/Letter|ı}}, {{Turkish/Letter|o}}, {{Turkish/Letter|u}}) are followed by back vowels|header style=color:black; font-weight: normal}}
According to this harmony, if a syllable contains a front vowel, the following syllable should have front vowel, too. And similarly, if a syllable contains a back vowel, the following syllable should have back vowel. Most of the Turkish words follow this rule but there are some exceptions, of course.
*For example, let's say you want to add {{Turkish/Suffix|in}} suffix to the word {{tr/word|kan|blood}}. Last syllable of the word contains the vowel '''{{Turkish/Letter|a}}''', which is a back vowel. Thus {{Turkish/Suffix|in}} changes to '''{{tr/word|{{font color|darkred|ı}}n}}''' when it is added to the word, because '''{{Turkish/Letter|i}}''' is a front vowel and '''{{Turkish/Letter|ı}}''' is the back version of it. For this reason, {{tr/word|kan|blood}} + {{Turkish/Suffix|in}} should be {{tr/word|kan{{font color|darkred|ı}}n|which means of-the-blood}}

=== Rounded/unrounded harmony ===
{{Turkish/Box|In short:|Rounded vowels ({{Turkish/Letter|o}}, {{Turkish/Letter|ö}}, {{Turkish/Letter|u}}, {{Turkish/Letter|ü}}) are followed by closed rounded ({{Turkish/Letter|u}}, {{Turkish/Letter|ü}}) or open unrounded ({{Turkish/Letter|a}}, {{Turkish/Letter|e}}) vowels, and unrounded vowels ({{Turkish/Letter|a}}, {{Turkish/Letter|e}}, {{Turkish/Letter|ı}}, {{Turkish/Letter|i}}) are followed by unrounded vowels.|header style=font-weight: normal; color: black;}}
According to this harmony,
# If a syllable contains {{Turkish/Letter|a}}, {{Turkish/Letter|e}}, {{Turkish/Letter|ı}} or {{Turkish/Letter|i}}; next syllable should contain {{Turkish/Letter|a}}, {{Turkish/Letter|e}}, {{Turkish/Letter|ı}} or {{Turkish/Letter|i}} (unrounded &amp;rarr; unrounded)
# If a syllable contains {{Turkish/Letter|o}}, {{Turkish/Letter|ö}}, {{Turkish/Letter|u}} or {{Turkish/Letter|ü}}; next syllable should contain '''{{Turkish/Letter|a}}''', '''{{Turkish/Letter|e}}''', {{Turkish/Letter|u}} or {{Turkish/Letter|ü}} (rounded &amp;rarr; ''open'' unrounded and ''close'' rounded)
*For example, let's say you want to add {{Turkish/Suffix|di}} suffix to the verb {{tr/word|ol-|happen, be}}. {{tr/word|ol-|Happen, be}} contains only one syllable and that syllable contains '''{{Turkish/Letter|o}}''', thus the suffix {{Turkish/Suffix|di}} should change to {{Turkish/Suffix|du}}. Because '''{{Turkish/Letter|i}}''' is front unrounded, its back rounded version is '''{{Turkish/Letter|u}}''' and this should be used according to the vowel harmony rules. Hence {{tr/word|ol-|happen, be}} + {{Turkish/Suffix|di}} should be {{tr/word|old{{tr/c|u|darkred}}|(it) happened}}.

===How to change vowels in suffixes according to the vowel harmony rules===
In Turkish vowels can be,
* ''open'' or ''closed''
* ''front'' or  ''back''
* ''rounded'' or ''unrounded''

These properties together determine the vowel. For example, open front unrounded vowel is ''a'', closed front rounded vowel is ''ü''. When changing vowels according to the vowel harmony rules, you change their frontness/backness and roundedness/unroundedness features, not openness/closedness. This feature remains the same. ''i'' can change into ''ı'', ''u'' or ''ü'' but it cannot change into ''a'', ''ö'' or ''o'' for example.

{{Turkish/Box|||To sum up,
*All &quot;''{{Turkish/Letter|i}}''&quot;s in a suffix can change to ''{{Turkish/Letter|ı}}'', ''{{Turkish/Letter|u}}'' or ''{{Turkish/Letter|ü}}'' according to the rules above. You can find the rule for that as they are written above, but here is an explanation for those who haven't understoond these rules clearly, yet. It becomes;
**''{{Turkish/Letter|ı}}'' after ''{{Turkish/Letter|a}}'' or ''{{Turkish/Letter|ı}}'' (back-unrounded vowels)
**''{{Turkish/Letter|u}}'' after ''{{Turkish/Letter|u}}'' or ''{{Turkish/Letter|o}}'' (back-rounded vowels)
**''{{Turkish/Letter|ü}}'' after ''{{Turkish/Letter|ü}}'' or ''{{Turkish/Letter|ö}}'' (front-rounded vowels)
*All &quot;''{{Turkish/Letter|e}}''&quot;s in a suffix can change to ''{{Turkish/Letter|a}}'' according to the rules above, it becomes {{Turkish/Letter|a}} after (a, ı, o, u). (Where is ''o'' and ''ö''? According to the roundedness/unroundedness harmony, rounded vowels may be preceded by a, e, u or ü. It can be observed that as a result of this rule, they can only occur in first syllables.) 

So, we can talk about two types of suffixes: '''e type''' and '''i type'''. &quot;e type&quot; suffixes are twofold, i.e. they have two possible forms. &quot;i type&quot; suffixes are fourfold, they have four possible forms. The convention followed in this book is to refer to suffixes in their e or i forms ({{Turkish/Suffix|dir}}, {{Turkish/Suffix|di}}, {{Turkish/Suffix|me}}, {{Turkish/Suffix|ecek}} etc.).|header style=font-weight:normal; color: black;}}

== Invariable suffixes ==
There are some suffixes which don't follow the vowel harmony rules. In this book, invariable vowels in suffixes are shown in {{font color|#222|this color}}. These suffixes are:
* {{Turkish/Suffix|ki}}
* {{Turkish/Suffix|ken}}
* {{Turkish/Suffix|leyin}}
* {{Turkish/Suffix|imtrak}}
* {{Turkish/Suffix|daş}}

You don't need to know what these suffixes are used for, for now. Only the first two suffix is actively used on many words. The others are just used in certain words to give certain meanings.

      <comment>/* Bad Sockpuppets */ Even when votes are not involved, this can be disruptive.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{draft|WB:SOCK}}

'''Sockpuppets''' are multiple user accounts created by a single person, for a variety of reasons. The primary account of the user is often referred to as the ''puppet master''. There are a number of legitimate uses for sockpuppet accounts, and several Wikibookians maintain sockpuppet accounts for some purpose. 

== Good Sockpuppets ==

Some legitimate uses of sockpuppetry include:
*Creating a second account to act as a &quot;bot&quot; account.
*Reserving account names that look similar, to prevent '''dopplegangers'''.
*Creating a second account to &quot;escape&quot; from hassles and stress.
*Testing automated functions,[[w:graphical user interfaces]]'s, bots, user preferences and piping.

== Bad Sockpuppets ==

There are, however, several uses of sockpuppets that are not allowed. This is a partial list:
*Creating a secondary account to circumvent a user block.
*Creating multiple puppet accounts to cast additional votes in discussions.
*Leaving multiple comments in a discussion and thereby giving the appearance more users are involved.
*Using multiple accounts to be uncivil, disruptive, or abusive in any way.

== Violations ==

Sockpuppets that are created or used in bad faith can be permanently blocked, and the owner of those accounts can be seen as violating [[Wikibooks:Be civil]], which may come with some penalties.</text>

|image = Barred Plymouth Rock Rooster.jpg
|description = The Plymouth Rock is a chicken breed that originated in the United States in the 19th century and is still popular to this day. John C. Bennett (1804-1867) has been credited with either creating or popularizing the breed. They were developed in New England in the early 1800's by crossing Dominiques and Black Javas. It was bred as a dual-purpose fowl, meaning that it was valued both for its meat and the hens' egg-laying ability. A hen will lay between 50 and 100 eggs per year.  It is a cold-hardy bird and therefore makes a great breed for the small farm or backyard flock owner. There are seven varieties of Plymouth Rock chickens: barred, blue, buff, Columbian, partridge, silver-penciled and white.

| description = Its feathers are a Mahogany dark red/brown lustre, bordering on black. Some have purple spots or green stripes. They have red/orange eyes and yellow feet. Chicks are a light red to tan color with two dark brown bars running down their backs.  Rhode Island Reds are tough birds, resistant to illness, good at foraging and free ranging, and are typically docile, quiet and friendly. Though males can be considerably aggressive.  Rhode Island Reds are excellent egg layers, producing up to 250 to 300 large, light brown eggs per year.  Rhode Island Reds are also bred for meat, with Cockerels weighing in at around four kilograms, and Hens slightly less.

| name =Orpington
| image =Orpington chicken 2.jpg
| description =The Orpington is a large bird from the English class of chickens. It is a bold, upright breed with a wide chest, broad back, and smallish head and tail. The Orpington was bred as a dual-purpose breed (meat production and eggs), but its popularity grew as a show bird rather than a utility breed. Their large size and soft appearance together with their rich color and gentle contours make them very attractive.  Orpingtons lay between 110 and 160 eggs a year. They do not stop laying in the winter. The eggs are tinted and range from small to large depending on the heredity of the breed.

| image =Leghorn chicken.jpeg
| description =Leghorns, and leghorn crossbreeds, are one of the most popular commercial breeds of chicken worldwide, and while the majority are white, a number of colored breeds also exist.  Leghorns are excellent layers of white eggs (around 300 per year), but they can be noisy, flighty, easily excited, and aggressive. Because of their aggression, they are not recommended for backyard-operations. Leghorns mature quickly, but are generally neither considered to be large birds nor suitable for meat.

| name =Pekin duck
| image =Hausente.jpg
| description =A Pekin duck is a breed of domesticated duck used primarily for egg and meat production. Bred from the Mallard in China, nine ducks were imported to the United States in 1873. It is the most popular commercial duck breed in the United States.  These ducks are ready for butchering at 6 to 8 weeks of age and produce more meat that is desirable for eating than other breeds of duck. Its meat is very tender and mild and well-suited for many menu options.  The eggs are slightly larger than a large chicken egg, and tend to have a more durable shell and stronger membrane which makes them harder to crack open than a chicken egg. Duck eggs have more protein, calcium and many vitamins, as well as more fat and cholesterol, per gram than a chicken egg.  Duck eggs are very similar in flavor and texture to a chicken egg. They can usually be substituted for large or jumbo eggs in recipes.  The mascot of the insurance company Aflac is a Pekin duck.

| name =Mammoth Bronze turkey
| image =
| description = The Mammoth Bronze is similar to the wild turkey, but it is quite a bit larger. Its feathers are an iridescent black with hints of green.  The feathers of the rump have bronze coloring (thus the name), while the feathers in the front have hints of red and green.

It is calmer than most other breeds which makes them quite a bit easier to handle.  Some people even use them as pets, though it is more common for them to be used for meat production.  Toms weigh between 25 and 40 pounds, while hens weigh between 14 and 26 pounds.  

The broad-breasted is more common than the &quot;unimproved&quot; variety.  The large breast interferes with natural mating, so they must be artificially inseminated.

| name =Toulouse goose
| image =Gans zoo 2004.jpg
| description = The Toulouse goose has greyish-brown feathers on top, with white feathers underneath.  The most distinguishing characteristic is a pronounced ''dewlap'', which is a flap of loose skin beneath the chin.  The bird is of a very trusting nature and has a very placid disposition, with the consequence that these birds do not thrive in flocks of mixed breeds. The more active and aggressive breeds will greatly distress the bird, putting them of mating and sometimes resulting in them losing out at the feeding trough. They are very domestic birds and will easily be bewildered by more active breeds if mixed. They do not need water or a pond and the geese never mate in water. They rarely have problems producing fertile eggs, although problems can occur during severe weather in the winter and spring, which is the case with most breeds of geese. The breed is a good layer of eggs and will equal the best of any goose breed. A good goose will lay up to 100 eggs a year. However the birds are not good sitters, the sitting habit having been breed out of some birds. The breed makes an excellent table bird. The geese are not great wanderers and preferring to stay close to home making them ideal for a large garden or an orchard where the birds will thrive.

==Prognostic Factors==
*Depth of stromal invasion (measured from base membrane of cervical epithelium)
**&lt;3 mm (IA1): Parametrial invasion rate 0 - 2.3%, LN mets rate 0 - 5.3%
**&gt;3 mm (IA2): Parametrial invasion rate 0 - 3.3%, LN mets rate 1.3 - 13.8% (average ~8%)
*Lymphovascular space invasion
**Clinical significance is controversial
**Strong correlation with depth of invasion and tumor volume; literature unclear if it is an independent prognostic factor
**Nevertheless, many GYN/ONC do not consider patients with LVSI+ to be Stage IA (including SGO and JSOG definitions)
*Tumor volume
**Clinical significance is controversial in IA
**Some data support volumetric measurement, but technique is slow and imprecise
*Confluence of invasive foci
**There appears to be no difference (FIGO vs. JSOG data)
*Grade
**Four studies did not find grade an independent prognostic variable


==Treatment Overview==
*IA1 and LVSI-
**Historically total hysterectomy a gold standard
**Demonstration of minimal risk of parametrial spread and LN+, with significant morbidity, resulted in shift to conization
**Cervical conization primary treatment today
**Brachytherapy alone probably a reasonable option in non-surgical candidates, based on the 2 series below
**NCCN.org: 
***Extrafascial hysterectomy &lt;u&gt;or&lt;/u&gt; 
***Cone + observe if negative margins &lt;u&gt;or&lt;/u&gt; 
***Modified radical + PLND if LVSI+
*IA2 or LVSI+
**Some form of hysterectomy to evaluate parametrial space and LNs
**NCCN.org: 
***Radical hysterectomy + PLND +/- aortic LN dissection &lt;u&gt;or&lt;/u&gt; 
***Pelvic RT + brachytherapy (75-80 Gy to Point A)
***Radical trachelectomy + LND if fertility preservation desired

==Surgical Series==

**Retrospective. 67 patients with IA1 treated with conization. Mean F/U 10 years
**Invasive recurrences: 4 patients (6%)
**Predictive factors: LVSI+, cone apical margin distance &lt;10mm

*'''Italian CTF, 2003''' (Italy) PMID 14658592 -- &quot;The clinical outcome of patients with stage Ia1 and Ia2 squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix: a Cooperation Task Force (CTF) study.&quot; (Gadducci A, Eur J Gynaecol Oncol. 2003;24(6):513-6.)
**Retrospective, multi-institutional. 166 patients with IA (143 patients IA1, 23 patients IA2), treated with conization alone (18%, all IA1), total hysterectomy (49%), or radical hysterectomy (33%). 
**Pelvic LN status: 0/67 LN+
**Recurrence: 5% intraepithelial and 2% invasive. IA1 recurrence 6%, IA2 recurrence 13%. Cone alone 10% (but none invasive), total hysterectomy 5%, radical hysterectomy 9%
**Conclusion: Conization can be a definitive treatement for Stage IA1. For Stage IA2, extrafascial hysterectomy might be adequate, need for LN dissection is questionable

**Retrospective. 643 patients with IA. Follow up 3-17 years
**Surgery: recurrence 15/496 (3%). All salvaged with further surgery
**Brachytherapy alone: recurrence 0/136 (0%)

**Retrospective. 21 patients with CIS and 34 patients with IA. 
**RT for IA: BT alone (13 patients) to average 55 Gy to Point A, BT + Whole Pelvis (21 patients) to 14 Gy WP + 23.5 Gy parametrial boost with midline block + BT to 52 Gy to Point A
**Recurrence: 0/21 CIS, 1/34 IA in pelvis. No DM. 
**Toxicity: severe complications 6%, in those getting WPRT + BT
**Conclusion: BT alone excellent treatment for both CIS and IA

      <text xml:space="preserve">An inclusive definition for interactive media is illusive if not impossible.  Perhaps it can be defined by degree, but never in an all-encompassing way.  Any format (print, web, disc, video, audio, etc.) that is created in a way that allows for user interaction could be called interactive media (hereafter referred to as &quot;IM&quot;).  Turning the pages of a book requires minimal involvement, while high-end video games might be called highly interactive multimedia.


Interaction with others can give our lives meaning, while total isolation from human contact or other stimuli has been described as one of the most effective forms of torture.  These facts help define the significance of multimedia that can respond to user interactions.  Just as there seems to be a craving for virtual experiences that increasingly resemble the real world, perhaps it is possible that the requirement for interaction is at the core of all human needs.

[[Image:2_26_F.jpg|right|400px]]

When human (person to person) interaction is impractical, unlikely or impossible, the ultimate experience requires interactive, immersive, multi-sensoral, IM.  It follows that the most effective interactive experience should consider each of these issues.  Until now, the technology to generate these kinds of experiences has been restricted to the holodeck of the starship Enterprise.  With the advent of powerful/affordable personal computer workstations and the rapid development of user-friendly multimedia software, almost anyone can get into the game.  


Among all the choices of hardware and software available to create IM, it is a challenge to students to identify those that are the most effective and accessible for creating IM.  Once identified, learning to use these hardware/software tools can seem overwhelming, but this may be the least of all problems to be conquered.  Judging by the general lack of success of IM thus far, the greatest challenge seems to be that of creating a product of significance.


Addictive blockbuster video games are the essence of IM, but what is their lasting sifnificance?  The power of interactive, immersive, multi-sensorial, IM has been unleashed, but to what end?

      <text xml:space="preserve">The ultimate frustration for interactive producers is loss of work due to hardware or software failure.  The question is not if it will fail, but when.  Backups at regular intervals are essential.  How often?  How much is your editing time worth?  When you can't afford to loose work hours, it's time for another backup.

==Overview==
The immune system is a complex system that is responsible for protecting us against infections and foreign substances. There are three lines of defense: the first is to keep invaders out (through skin, mucus membranes, etc), the second line of defense consists of non-specific ways to defend against pathogens that have broken through the first line of defense (such as with inflammatory response and fever). The third line of defense is mounted against specific pathogens that are causing disease (B cells produce antibodies against bacteria or viruses in the extracellular fluid, while T cells kill cells that have become infected). The immune system is closely tied to the lymphatic system, with B and T lymphocytes being found primarily within lymph nodes. Tonsils and the thymus gland are also considered lymph organs and are involved in immunity. We often don't realize how effective the immune system is until it fails or malfunctions, such as when the lymphocytes are attacked by HIV in an AIDS patient.

==The Immune System as a Castle==

The immune system is a silent wonder. While we are very aware of our heart beating and the breaths we take, we are much less aware of our immune system that protects us from thousands of potentially deadly attacks every day. 

In this chapter we will discuss the immune system we each possess that is working around the clock, protecting us from disease and death.
[[Image:Suecia 3-126 ; Tavastehus slott.png|right]]
A good way to start understanding the immune system is to liken it to a castle. A castle, like our bodies, is a fortress. A castle has three lines of defense: 
* ''First'',  A moat and drawbridge. The first line of defense in our bodies are physical and chemical barriers - our skin, stomach acids, mucous, tears, vaginal opening, of which the last three mostly produce lysozyme to destroy harmful incoming pathogens. 
* ''Second'', Sentries and archers who stand on the castle wall. In our bodies the second line of defense is non-specific immune responses - marcrophages, neutrophils, interferons, and complement proteins. This line of defense also includes fever and inflammatory response as nonspecific defenses.
* ''Third'',  Soldiers within the castle.Our third line of defense is specific immune responses - T Cells and B Cells. There are many types of each which work like a close knit team to destroy pathogens.


If pathogens (invaders) try and succeed in penetrating the first line of defense, then the second line of defense is ready to act. If both the first and second line of defense fail, then the third line of defense will act. It is when all three lines of defense are breached that we get sick and are subject to disease.

So what we are trying to say is that the immune system is a set of mechanisms of defense, protecting an organism from infection by identifying and attacking pathogens. This is a difficult task, since pathogens range from viruses to parasitic worms and must be detected with absolute specificity as they are &quot;hidden&quot; amongst normal cells and tissues. Pathogens are also constantly changing themselves to avoid detection and successfully infect and destroy their hosts.

== Lymphatic System ==
[[Image:Lymphatic system.png|right|framed|200px|The human lymphatic system]]

The lymphatic system and the immune system are terms that are used interchangeably to refer to the body's ability to defend against pathogens. The lymphatic system is comprised of three interrelated functions: (1) Removal of excess fluids, lymph, from body tissues, (2) Absorption of fatty acids and subsequent transport of fat, chyle, to the circulatory system and (3) Formation of white blood cells (WBCs), and initiation of immunity through the formation of antibodies, lending specific resistance to pathogens.
=== Lymphatic Pathways ===
The lymphatic system acts as a secondary circulatory system, except it collaborates with white blood cells in lymph nodes to protect the body from being infected by cancer cells, fungi, viruses or bacteria. Unlike the circulatory system, the lymphatic system is not closed and has no central pump; the lymph moves slowly and under low pressure due to peristalsis, the operation of semilunar valves in the lymph veins, and the milking action of skeletal muscles. Like veins, lymph vessels have one-way, semilunar valves and depend mainly on the movement of skeletal muscles to squeeze fluid through them. Rhythmic contraction of the vessel walls may also help draw fluid into the lymphatic capillaries. This fluid is then transported to progressively larger lymphatic vessels culminating in the right lymphatic duct (for lymph from the right upper body) and the thoracic duct (for the rest of the body); these ducts drain into the circulatory system at the right and left subclavian veins.

[[image:Illu_lymph_capillary.png|thumb|left]]

=== Lymph ===

Lymph originates as blood plasma that leaks from the capillaries of the circulatory system, becoming interstitial fluid, filling the space between individual cells of tissue. Plasma is forced out of the capillaries by hydrostatic pressure, and as it mixes with the interstitial fluid, the volume of fluid accumulates slowly. Most of the fluid is returned to the capillaries by osmosis. The proportion of interstitial fluid that is returned to the circulatory system by osmosis is about 90% of the former plasma, with about 10% accumulating as overfill. The excess interstitial fluid is collected by the lymphatic system by diffusion into lymph capillaries, and is processed by lymph nodes prior to being returned to the circulatory system. Once within the lymphatic system the fluid is called lymph, and has almost the same composition as the original interstitial fluid.

=== Oedema ===
Oedema is the swelling that forms when too much tissue fluid forms or not enough taken away. It can be caused by a variety of conditions such as allergic responses (too much vasodilation), starvation (lack of albumin in blood lowers osmotic pressure and decreases amount of fluid returning to capillaries), and lymphatic disorders (e.g. blockage due to parasite in elephantiasis, or removal of lymph nodes due to a radical mastectomy). Edema is common in the lower extremities when people spend a lot of time sitting, because the fluid return is based largely on the massaging action of skeletal muscles.

=== Lymphatic Vessels and Ducts ===
The lymphatic vessels are similar in structure to the cardiovascular veins, meaning they also have valves. They are dependent upon the contraction of skeletal muscle, respiratory movements and valves that do not allow backward flow. The vessels merge before entering one of two ducts.
* Thoracic Duct: This duct is much larger than the lymphatic duct. It serves the abdomen, lower extremities and the left side of the upper body (head, neck, and arm)
* Right Lymphatic Duct: This duct serves all of the right side of the upper body and thoracic area (head, neck).

== Organs, Tissues and Cells of the Immune System ==
The immune system consists of a network of lymphatic organs, tissues, and cells. These structures are supported by the reticuloendothelial system: loose connective tissue with a network of reticular fibers. Phagocytic cells, including monocytes and macrophages, are located in the reticular connective tissue. When micro-organisms invade the body, or the body encounters antigens (such as pollen), antigens are transported to the lymph. Lymph is carried through the lymph vessels to regional lymph nodes. In the lymph nodes, the macrophages and dendritic cells phagocytose the antigens, process them, and present the antigens to lymphocytes, which can then start producing antibodies or serve as memory cells. The function of memory cells is to recognize specific antigens in the future.

'''Primary Lymphatic Organs''' 
The primary lymphatic organs are the red bone marrow and the thymus. They are the site of production and maturation of lymphocytes, the type of white blood cell that carries out the most important work of the immune system.

*'''Red Bone Marrow''' Red bone marrow, the soft, spongy, nutrient rich tissue in the cavities of certain long bones, is the organ that is the site of blood cell production.  
Some of the white blood cells produced in the marrow are: neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes. Lymphocytes differentiate into B lymphocytes and T lymphocytes. Red bone marrow is also the site of maturation of B lymphocytes. T lymphocytes mature in the thymus.
[[image:Gray1217.png|thumb|Side of thorax, showing surface markings for bones, lungs (purple), pleura (blue), and spleen (green)]].
*'''Thymus Gland''' The thymus gland is located in the upper thoracic cavity posterior to the sternum and anterior to the ascending aorta. The thymus is an organ that is more active in children, and shrinks as we get older. Connective tissue separates the thymus into lobules, which contain lymphocytes. Thymic hormones such as thymosin are produced in the thymus gland. Thymosin is thought to aid in the maturation of T lymphocytes. '''The Thymus''' is critical to the immune system. Without a thymus, a person has no ability to reject foreign substances, blood lymphocyte level is very poor, and the body’s response to most antigens is either absent or very weak

Immature T lymphocytes travel from the bone marrow through the bloodstream to reach the thymus. Here they mature and for the most part, stay in the thymus. Only 5% of T lymphocytes ever leave the thymus. They only leave if they are able to pass the test: if they react with “self” cells, they die. If they have the potential to attack a foreign cell, they leave the thymus. 

'''Secondary Lymphatic Organs'''The secondary lymphatic organs also play an important role in the immune system as they are places where lymphocytes find and bind with antigens This is followed by the proliferation and activation of lymphocytes. The secondary organs include the spleen, lymph nodes, tonsils, Peyer’s patches, and the appendix.

*'''The spleen''',  The spleen is a ductless, vertebrate gland that is closely associated with the circulatory system, where it functions in the destruction of old red blood cells in holding a reservoir of blood. Located in the upper left region of the abdominal cavity, it is divided into partial compartments. Each compartment contains tissue known as white pulp and red pulp. The white pulp contains lymphocytes and the red pulp acts in blood filtration. When blood enters the spleen and flows through the sinuses for filtration, lymphocytes react to pathogens , macrophages engulf debris, and also remove old, worn out red blood cells. A person without a spleen is more susceptible to infections and may need supplementary antibiotic therapy for the rest of their life.

*'''Lymph Nodes''' are small oval shaped structures located along the lymphatic vessels. They are about 1-25 mm in diameter. Lymph nodes act as filters, with an internal honeycomb of connective tissue filled with lymphocytes that collect and destroy bacteria and viruses. They are divided into compartments, each packed with B lymphocytes and a sinus. As lymph flows through the sinuses, it is filtered by macrophages whose function is to engulf pathogens and debris. Also present in the sinuses are T lymphocytes, whose functions are to fight infections and attack cancer cells. Lymph nodes are in each cavity of the body except the dorsal cavity. Physicians can often detect the body’s reaction to infection by feeling for swollen, tender lymph nodes under the arm pits and in the neck, because when the body is fighting an infection, these lymphocytes multiply rapidly and produce a characteristic swelling of the lymph nodes.

*'''Tonsils''' are often the first organs to encounter pathogens and antigens that come into the body by mouth or nose. There are 3 pairs of tonsils in a ring about the pharynx.

*'''Peyer’s patches''', located in the wall of the intestine and the appendix, attached to the cecum of the large intestine, intercept pathogens that come into the body through the intestinal tract.

==Leukocytes==

The primary cells of the immune system are the ''leukocytes'' or white blood cells(WBC). Most leukocytes are much larger then red blood cells, but they are not nearly as numerous. A microliter of whole blood contains about 5 million red blood cells but only about 7000 leukocytes.

Although most leukocytes circulate through the blood, they usually leave the capillaries and function extravascularly (outside the vessels). Some types of leukocytes can live out in the tissue for several months, but others may live for only hours or days. Leukocytes can be distinguished from one another in stained tissue samples by the shape and size of the nucleus, the staining characterisitcs of the cytoplasm and the cytoplasmic inclusions, and the regularity of the cell border.

Leukocytes are are divided into six basic types eosinophils, basophils, neutrophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, and dendritic cells. 

One functional group of leukocytes is the '''phagocytes''', WBC that engulf and ingest their targets by phagocytosis. This group includes the neutrophils, macrophages, monocytes (which are macrophage precursors), and eosinophils.
A second functional group is the '''cytotoxic cells''', so named because they kill the cells they attack. This group includes eosinophils and some types of lymphocytes. 

Lets take a closer look at the six basic types of leukocytes.

'''Eosinophils'''

Eosinophils fight parasites and contribute to allergic reactions. They are easily recognized by the bright pink staining granules in their cytoplasm. Normally, there are only a few eosinophils found in the peripheral circulatory. They account for only 1-3% of all leukocytes. The life span of a typical eosinophil in the blood is about 6-12 hours. Eosinophils are known to attach to large parasites and release substances from their granules that damage or kill the parasite. Because eosinophils kill pathogens, they are classified as cytotoxic cells. Eosinophils also participate in allergic reactions, by contributing to inflammation and tissue damage by releasing toxic enzymes.

'''Basophils'''

Basophils release histamine and other chemicals.  (Histamine is also secreted by other cells called MAST cells.)  Basophils are rare in circulation but are easily recognized in a stained blood smear by the large, dark blue granules in their cytoplasm. They also release mediators that contribute to inflammation. The granules contain histamine, heparin(an anticoagulant), cytokines, and other chemicals involved in allergic and immune responses. 
[[Image:Phagocytosis.png|thumb|left|Illistration of a cell during phagocytosis.]]
'''Neutrophils'''

Neutrophils &quot;eat&quot; bacteria and release cytokines. Neutrophils are the most abundant WBC, 50-70% of the total. They are easily identified by a segmented nucleus. Neutrophils, like other leukocytes are formed in the bone marrow. They are phagocytic cells that typically ingest and kill bacteria. Most neutrophils remain in the blood but can leave the circulation if attracted to an extravascular site of damage or infection. In addition to ingesting bacteria and foreign particles, neutrophils release a variety of cytokines.
 
'''Monocytes'''

Monocytes are the precursor cells of tissue macrophages. Monocytes are not that common in the blood 1-6% of WBC. Once out of the blood, monocytes enlarge and differentiate into macrophages. Some tissue macrophages patrol the tissues, creeping along by amoeboid motion. Others find a location and remain fixed in place. Macrophages are the primary scavengers within tissues. Macrophages also remove larger particles, such as old RBC and dead neutrophils. Macrophages play an important role in the development of acquired immunity. After they ingest and digest molecular or cellular antigens, fragments of processed antigen are inserted into the macrophage membrane as part of surface protein complexes.

'''Lymphocytes'''

Lymphocytes are the key cells that mediate the acquired immune response of the body. Only about 5% of lymphocytes are found in circulation. They constitute 20-30% of all WBC. Most lymphocytes are found in lymphoid tissues, where they are more likely to encounter invaders. By one estimate,the adult body contains a trillion lymphocytes at any one time.

'''Dendritic Cells'''

Dendritic cells activate lymphocytes. They are antigen-presenting cells characterized by long, thin processes that resemble neuronal dendrites. Dendritic cells are found in the skin called Langerhans cells and also in various organs. When dendritic cells recognize and capture antigens, they migrate to secondary lymphoid tissues, where they present the antigens to lymphocytes.

== Defenses Against Infection ==

===Innate Defense – first line of defense===

Physical and chemical barriers are the body's first line of defense.

'''Physical or Mechanical barriers'''
*'''Skin'''
One of the bodies first line of defenses against bacteria and other harmful organisms is the skin.  Our skin is a barrier which stops infection from entering the body. Millions of microorganisms live harmlessly on the skin and in the air around us.  Sebaceous glands in the skin produce sweat and sebum, which, combined help to protect the skin.  Both substances contain antiseptic molecules, primarily lysozyme which breaks down bacterial cell walls.  Although our skin is a good defense, it isn’t perfect. The skin itself can also become infected by bacteria, viruses, fungi or tiny parasites.  Some examples of these are: boils, impetigo; ringworm, athletes foot; cold sore, wart, verucca; and scabies.

*'''Mucus membranes'''
Another very important first line of defense is our mucus membranes.  The mucous membranes (or mucosae; singular: mucosa) line various body cavities that are exposed to the external environment and internal organs. It is at several places continuous with skin: at the nostrils, the lips, the ears, the genital area, and the anus.  The nose and mouth serve as passageways for air going to and from the lungs.  As we inhale and exhale, the mucus membranes that line these passageways warm and humidify the air.  It has been said that there is more bacteria contained in a human mouth than the the sum of all the people that have ever lived on the earth.  Mucus membranes serve different functions, however, their more important job is to secrete mucus that traps bacteria and other foreign debris that irritates the lining of the respiratory tract.  This mucus is produced and stored in the sinuses by other mucus membranes.  We get congested when there is excessive fluid in the sinus cavities.  This is a result of an increase in mucus secretions, as well as an increase in the amount of fluids that passes across the blood vessels of the mucus membranes that line the nose and sinus. There are also many chemicals, such as pesticides and anthrax that are absorbed through the skin.
Some mucous membranes are ciliated.  ''Cilia'' are thin, tail-like projections extending approximately 5–10 micrometers outwards from the cell body.  Their main function is to move things across their surface.
 
*'''Mucociliary escalator'''
The mucociliary clearance of the respiratory tract is an important defense mechanism against foreign debris and inhaled pathogens. The cilia that lines the upper and lower airways are lined with a thin layer of mucus. These beat rapidly to propel particles that are trapped in the mucus layer to the pharynx. Defective mucociliary clearance predisposes our respiratory tracts to recurrent infections. These cilial defects may be either congenital or acquired by infection, toxins or drugs.

'''Chemical Defenses'''
*'''Tears, saliva''' 
Tears and saliva contain ''lysozyme'', an antiseptic enzyme that attacks cell walls of bacteria and breaks them down.
*'''Stomach acids''' 
Glands in the stomach lining produce hydrocloric acid.  This acid kills most invading organisms that are swallowed and take up residence there.

===Non-specific responses to infection - 2nd line of defense===

We are born with built in nonspecific defenses that all respond in the same way to invading pathogens. The outermost defense our body has is our skin.  The sebaceous glands produce sweat and sebum, which contain antiseptic properties which protect.  This bacteria-killing substance called lyzosome is also found in tears and saliva.  
Acidic urine in the urinary tract and friendly bacteria in the genital tract prevent the multiplying of harmful organisms in these areas.  Most invading organisms in the stomach are killed by gland production of hydrochloric acid.
These are a few examples of how the outer defenses protect us.  All outer defenses work together as the body's first line of defense. 

====Inflammatory response====
Any break in the skin will allow bacteria to enter the body.  These foreign microbes will cause swelling and reddening at the site of injury.  This reaction by the body is called an ''inflammatory reaction'' or ''inflammatory response''.
*Swelling, redness, heat, and pain
Inflammation is characterized by the following quintet: swelling (tumor), redness (rubor), heat (calor), pain (dolor) and dysfunction of the organs involved (functio laesa).
When an injury occurs, a capillary and several tissue cells are apt to rupture, releasing histamine and kinins.  These cause the capillaries to dilate, become more permeable, and leak fluid into these tissues.  Dilation and fluid leaking into the tissues causes swelling, redness, and heat.
The swelling and kinins stimulate nerve endings, causing pain.  If there has been a break in the skin due to the injury, invading microbes may enter.        
A common cause of inflammation after surgery is serous fluid.  This is a mixture of plasma, lymph and interstitial fluids seeping from the damaged cells and vessels.  If enough serous fluid accumulates a mass called a seroma may form. Treatment of a seroma may involve the removal of the fluid with a needle into a syringe, a process called aspiration.
*Phagocytosis by neutrophils and macrophages
In the event of a break in the skin, neutrophils, monocytes (and macrophages) arrive and attempt to engulf and destroy the invaders. Phagocytosis is receptor-mediated event, which ensures that only unwanted particles are ingested. Stimulated macrophages can bring about an explosive increase in the number of leukocytes by producing Colony Stimulating Factors (CSFs).  The CSFs pass by way of the blood to the bone marrow, where they stimulate the production and the release of white blood cells (WBCs), primarily neutrophils.  
Lymphocytes in nearby lymph nodes produce specific antibodies to attack the microbes.  During the conflict, some neutrophils die and become mixed with dead tissue, bacteria, living white cells, etc.  This thick yellow-white fluid is called ''pus''.  When a person has an illness, an examination of the numbers and types of WBC's in their blood can be very useful.

====Complement System====
[[Image:Complement_death.PNG|thumb|right|Complement protein attacking a cell membrane.]]
The complement system is a biochemical cascade of the immune system that helps clear pathogens from an organism, and promote healing. It is derived from many small plasma proteins that work together to form the primary end result of cytolysis by disrupting the target cell's plasma membrane. 

Complement is activated by antigen-antibody complexes and causes holes to form in the plasma membrane of foreign microbes or cells (lysis). The complement system is considered a nonspecific defense, but it can be activated against specific microbes that have been marked with antibodies. Hemolytic transfusion reactions are caused by complement activation after a person expresses antibodies against the antigens found on the inappropriately donated blood. Hemolytic Disease of the Newborn (HDN) is due to maternal antibodies against the Rh factor crossing the placenta, binding to the baby's red blood cells, and stimulating the baby's own complement system to lyse its red blood cells.

====Interferon in response to viral infection====
Interferon (IFNs) are naturally occurring glycoproteins involved in non-specific immune responses. Interferons do just as their name states they &quot;interfere&quot; with viral growth.   Interferons are initiated from a cell that has been infected by a virus. When a cell has been infected by a virus the virus will then cause the cell to make viral nucleic acid.  This nucleic acid acts as a signal and it causes the cell to realize that it has been infected with a virus. So the cell will start making and sending out interferons.  The IFN's that the cell sends out go to nearby healthy cells and warns them of a virus.  The healthy cells then start intracellular changes that help the cells to be more resistant to the virus.

===	Adaptive Defense (Specific Defense--third line of defense)===
This part of the immune system directly targets invading microbes.  Our specific immune defenses respond to ''antigens''.  An antigen is a protein (or polysaccharide) molecule, typically on the cell membrane, that the body recognizes as ''nonself''.  They are found on microbes, foreign cells, or on cancer cells.  Normally our immune system does not respond to our own antigens (if it does, then this is an autoimmune disease). Sometimes we develop an immune response to a harmless antigen, such as pollen or cat dander (this is an allergic response).
====Lymphocytes====
Specific immunity is dependent upon two types of lymphocytes, the B cells and the T cells.  Their names are based on where in the body they mature.  B cells mature in the bone marrow, and T cells mature in the thymus gland.  In comparison, both B and T cells can recognize and target antigen-bearing cells, although they go about this in different ways.
B and T cell lymphocytes are capable of recognizing an antigen because they have specific receptor molecules on their surface which exactly fit individual antigens (like a lock and a key). Any B or T cell can only respond to one type of antigen. The body does not know ahead of time which antigens it will encounter, but rather makes receptor sites for a huge number of possible antigens. It is estimated that for the million or so antigens we encounter in our lifetime we have an equal number of specific lymphocytes for each possible antigen.
=====B Cells Produce Antibodies=====
''B cell'' lymphocytes are responsible for antibody-mediated immunity (humoral immunity).  They produce antibodies, which are proteins that bind with and neutralize specific antigens.  Antibodies do not directly kill bacteria, but mark them for destruction. When antibodies bind to viruses they can prevent the viruses from infecting cells. When antibodies bind to toxins they can neutralize the toxin (why we get immunized against the tetanus toxin). Humoral immunity works best fighting against target viruses, bacteria, and foreign molecules that are soluble in blood and lymph ''before'' the bacteria or viruses have entered into cells (extracellular bacteria and extracellular viruses). 

B cells produce two different types of cells: 
*plasma cells
*memory cells
  
'''Plasma cells'''

As B cells mature during embryonic development, they develop surface receptors that allow them to recognize specific antigens.  Then they travel in the bloodstream, distributing throughout the lymph nodes, spleen, and tonsils.  Once B cells reach their destination, they remain inactive until they encounter a foreign cell with an antigen that matches their particular receptor site (most B cells remain inactive for your entire life).  The foreign antigen can be presented to the B cell directly, but usually macrophages and T cell lymphocytes (helper T cells) interact with B cells as Antigen Presenting Cells to bring about antibody production. Upon such an encounter, the B cell's receptors will bind to the antigen.  The appropriate B cell is ''turned on'' or stimulated.  It then grows bigger, and rapidly multiplies into a large homogenous group (clone).  Most of these cells are ''plasma cells'', which actively secrete antibody that will bind with the original stimulating antigen .  While most of the B cells remain in the lymphatic system, the antibodies are secreted into the lymph fluid which then enters into the blood plasma to circulate throughout the body. Although the clone cells only live a few days, their antibodies remain and circulate in the blood and lymph, gradually decreasing in number.

'''Antibody Structure and Function'''

There are different classes of antibodies, or immunoglobulins (Ig), such as IgA, IgG, IgE, and IgM. They can attach to the surface of a microbe and make it more easily phagocytized by neutrophils, monocytes and macrophages. Anything that simplifies phagocytosis is called an ''opsonin.'' The process of antibodies attaching to invaders can be termed 'opsonization.' Some antibodies can bind and inactivate certain poisons or toxins and are called ''antitoxins'' (tetanus immunizations stimulate your body to produce antibodies against the tetanus toxin rather than against the bacteria that produces the toxin).  Still other antibodies can bind to the surface of microbes and prevent their attachment to the body's cells (thus preventing viruses from entering host cells).  Also, some of them can stimulate nine proteins found in plasma, called ''complement''.

'''Memory B cells'''

At the time of activation some of the clones become memory B cells.  These cells are long lived and have recorded the information about the foreign antigen so antibodies can be made more quickly, and in greater amount, in case a second exposure should occur. Since the second response is much stronger than the first and puts more antibodies into circulation, we often receive &quot;booster shots&quot; for immunizations.

=====T Cells Attack Infected Cells=====
[[image:Antigen_presentation.svg|thumb|250px]]
Defending the body against intracellular pathogens is the role of T lymphocytes, which carry out ''cell-mediated immunity''(CMI). Macrophages phagocytize invading microbes and present parts of the microbe (antigens) to the T cell lymphocytes.  The appropriate T cell is ''turned on'' or stimulated.  The activated T cell rapidly multiplies into a large homogenous group (clone) of ''cytotoxic T cells'' (Tc cells).  
*(a)	Attack organisms directly, Also kill infected cells
These cytotoxic T cells migrate to the site of infection (or disease) and produce chemicals which directly kill the invader.  Cytotoxic T cells release “perforin” that causes pores to form in the plasma membrane of the target cell, resulting in lysis.
*(b)	T cells develop in the thymus gland from immature precursor cells that migrate there from the bone marrow.
*(c)	Killer and helper T cells
*(d)	Memory T Cells
A portion of these activated T cells become ''memory'' T cells (Tm). These cells record the information about the foreign antigen so T cells can respond more quickly, and more strongly, if a second exposure occurs.
A portion of the T cells become ''T helper cells'' (TH) or ''T suppressor cells'' (Ts). 
TH cell stimulate other T cells and B cells by releasing ''cytokines'' and other stimulatory chemicals.
Ts cells suppress the immune response.
Experience has shown that cell mediated immunity is most useful to the body by:
Protecting against microbes which exist inside of our body's cells (intracellular bacteria and intracellular viruses).
Protecting against fungal infections.
Protecting against protozoan parasites.
Protecting against cancer cells.

==Immune Response Pathways== 
The innate response starts first, and it is reinforced by the more specific acquired response. The two pathways are interconnected, so cooperation and communication is essential.


===Inflammation===
What happens when bacteria invade? If the first line of defense fails, bacteria can reach the extracellular fluid. There they usually cause an inflammatory response. This response coats antigens on the bacterial surface, with antibodies. Then in return the antibodies will ingest the antigens with phagocytic cells. This is characterized by a red, swollen warm area that is tender or painful. In addition to the nonspecific inflammatory response, lymphocytes attracted to the area produce antibodies keyed to the specific type of bacteria. If the infection continues it will produce a fever.
*What causes a fever?
During an infection macrophages may release ''cytokines'' (see glossary), such as interleukin-1, that travel to the hypothalamus and induce a change in the ''thermostat'' setting. When the thermostat is raised to a new normal temperature, the previous body temperature now registers as too cold. To increase the temperature to the new level, our body shunts blood away from the skin (leaving it feeling cold and clammy), the heart rate increases, and we shiver to generate heat until we reach the new set point. The hypothalamus may subsequently lower the thermostat, in which case we suddenly feel hot and start to sweat as our body attempts to cool off. A person may cycle between chills and sweats during the course of an infection. While a fever can be dangerous if it gets too high, or if a patient is weak or has heart trouble, there is some evidence suggesting that the body may overcome an infection faster if a fever is allowed to run its course.

===Intracellular Defense===

What happens when virus's invade the body?

First they encounter an extracellular phase just like the bacteria did. In the early stages of a viral infection, innate immune responses and antibodies can help control the invasion of the virus. Once the virus enters the body's host cells cytotoxic T lymphocytes are the main defense against intracellular viruses. These cells look for infected host cells, then destroy them.

===Acquired Immunity: Antigen-specific Responses===

Acquired immunity responses are antigen-specific responses in which the body recognizes a foreign substance and selectively reacts to it. This is mediated primarily by lymphocytes. Acquired immunity overlaps with the process of innate immunity. Acquired immunity can be subdivided into active immunity and passive immunity.

'''Active Immunity''' occurs when the body is exposed to a pathogen and produces its own antibodies. Active immunity is active because it is the &quot;activation&quot; of your immune system.  Active immunity can occur naturally, when a pathogen invades the body, or artificially, like when we are given vaccinations containing disabled or killed pathogens. The body does require prior exposure to an antigen to develop an active immunity. Some parents expose their children to some antigens so they will have immunity to these diseases later in life.

'''Passive Immunity''' occurs when we acquire antibodies made by another human or animal. Passive immunity is passive because it requires no response from the person's immune system. In passive immunity you are not presenting the body with foreign antigens.  Therefore your immune system will not need to use B cells, and we know that if the B cells are never introduced your body isn't making antibodies and it isn't making memory B cells. The transfer of antibodies from mother to fetus across the placenta is one example. Injections containing antibodies are another. Sometimes travelers going abroad may be injected with gamma globulin, but this passive immunity last only about three months. Passive immunizations are used to protect people who have been exposed to infections or toxins, like snake venom or tetanus.

===Allergic Responses/Inflammatory Responses===

An allergy is an inflammatory immune response to a nonpathogenic antigen. Left alone, the antigen is not harmful to the body, but if someone is sensitive to the antigen, the body produces an inflammatory response designed to get rid of it. Allergic inflammatory responses can range from from mild tissue damage to fatal reactions.
The immune response in allergies is called ''sensitivity'' or ''hypersensitivity'' to the antigen. '''Immediate hypersensitivity reactions''' are mediated (immune destruction) by antibodies and occur within minutes of exposure to antigens, which are called allergens. '''Delayed hypersensitivity reactions''' are mediated by helper T cells and macrophages and may take several days to develop.
[[Image:Antigens presentation.svg]]
What happens during a immediate hypersensitivity reaction?
:1-Foreign protein or antigen is introduced
:2-Macrophage cell ingests (phagocytosis)
:3- Activation of Th lymphocyte
:4-Th (helper) lymphocyte
:5-Foreign protein bound by membrane antibodies
:6-B lymphocyte
:7-Antigen processing (MHC II type)
:8-Antigen-MHC II complex (antigen presentation)
:9-Production of antigen-specific antibodies
:10-Activation of B lymphocyte with active Th

2. Upon reexposure, the body reacts more strongly and rapidly. The allergen binds to IgE already present on mast cells, triggering the immediate release of histamine, cytokines, and other mediators that cause allergic symptoms. The severity of the reaction varies, ranging from localized reactions near the site of where the allergen entered, such as a rash. To the most severe allergic reaction called ''anaphylaxis''. In an anaphylactic reaction, massive release of histamine and other cytokines cause widespread vasodilation, circulatory collapse, and severe bronchoconstriction. Unless treated promptly, anaphylaxis can result in death.

Skin tests for allergies of certain allergens can be injected into the skin. This is a good way to find out what one might be allergic to so they can eliminate further exposure. Allergens that can cause immediate hypersensitivity include bee stings, pollen and certain foods. Allergies that cause chronic allergic rhinitis and asthma are highly due to dust mites (dermatophgoides). It is not their bodies that cause the reaction, but rather it's feces. Allergic attacks usually stop when the histamine has been depleted. This can be stopped faster with an antihistamine drug or nasal spray.

What happens in a delayed hypersensitivity?
It could take hours or days for symptoms to occur in a delayed hypersensitivity. Delayed hypersensitivity is cell mediated with a T lymphocyte response. Secretion of lymphokines, instead of histamine, happens in a delayed hypersensitivity. So, the treatment would be a corticosteroid instead of an antihistamine. Examples of a delayed hypersensitivity would be, poison sumac, poison oak and poison ivy. Skin tests for certain diseases are also considered examples like TB test and the Mantoux test.

==Infectious Organisms and Immunization==

''' Beneficial Organisms'''
'''Intestinal bacteria'''
*Bacteria are prokaryotic (before nucleus) cells that we see usually as bacilli (rods) or cocci (spheres). While they are the major cause of many diseases both fatal and mild, bacteria are also our friends and can be of great service to us. Many bacteria in our bodies help prevent pathogens from becoming established. &quot;Good bacteria&quot; helps protect us from &quot;bad bacteria&quot;. The large intestine is packed with ''normal microflora'' that digest substances otherwise indigestible. This process provides our bodies with additional vitamins, fatty acids and nutrients. Another example is the microflora that is in the vagina that helps maintain an acidic pH, which discourages the growth of infectious organisms. These are examples of our immune system's first line of defense.

''' Harmful Organisms''' 

'''Viruses'''
*Viruses are non-living particles consisting of protein and nucleic acid that infect cells in biological organisms. They can reproduce only by invading and taking over other cells as they lack the cellular machinery for self reproduction. A virus is about ten times smaller than a bacteria. Some viruses you will recognize are: ''influenza, herpes, measles, and the common cold''. Some viruses are particularly dangerous because they can undergo a period of latency, during which they are hidden in the cell and do not reproduce. ''Influenza'' and ''HIV'' are examples of viruses that frequently mutate, thus making it nearly impossible to achieve a long-lasting immunity.

'''Bacteria'''
*Bacteria can be deadly. They are the major cause of preventable infections and death. Some well known illnesses are caused by bacteria: ''staph infections, strep infections, tuberculosis, food poisoning, tetanus, leprosy, and pneumonia''. Because bacterial cells are different from human cells, compounds can be found that can kill specific bacterial targets while leaving the human patient unharmed. Antibacterial agents can be successful in wiping out a bacterial infection. The problem with antibiotics is that many strains of bacteria are growing resistant to them. Plus, our bodies are not getting the chance to develop immunity to certain bacteria. It may be better to use probiotics (new supplements that promote the growth of healthy and helpful bacteria) rather than depend on antibiotics so much.

'''Protozoans'''
*The protozoans are mostly eukaryotic unicellular organisms with organelles and a nucleus.
*''Malaria'' is the most dangerous disease caused by protozoans and is endemic in about 50% of the populations on Earth. Two to four million people die each year from malaria, a million of these are under the age of five. malaria is caused by one of the ''Plasmodium'' species of mosquitoes.

'''Fungi'''
* Fungi are more like animals and humans than they are like bacteria because of their eukaryotic cells. Though they produce large, visible colonies on old bread, molds and yeasts are in the category of microscopic fungi. Yeasts are one-celled and reproduce by budding. Molds exist as cell chains, called hyphae.
*''Mycoses'' are diseases caused by fungi. Because of the similarity between human cells and fungal cells, it has been difficult for scientists to design antibiotics that are effective against fungi and do not harm humans. Some of the diseases caused by fungi are: ''tineas'', ''vaginal infection'' (candidiasis), and ''histoplasmosis''.

''' Diagnosis''' 
Infectious diseases are diagnosed by laboratory techniques such as microscopy and culture. Since many bacteria have no color, scientists have developed special staining procedures to more accurately diagnose. 
*	Culture
Bacteria and fungi can be identified by growing them on plates until colonies are visible. Viruses are cultured on eggs or live cells.
*	Antibiotic sensitivity
After colonies of bacteria are grown on plates, discs are placed on the plates that contain different antibiotics. Bacteria will not grow around the most effective antibiotic.
*	Tests for viruses
Since viruses are too small to be seen with a light microscope, viral infections can be diagnosed indirectly by their effects on cells. Some viruses cause changes to the surface of cultured cells, causing them to stick together.

''' Immunization'''
While some infectious diseases are common and can occur many times in the same person, others can only occur once in a lifetime thanks to the immune system and it's ability to remember the organism and prevent following infections. To avoid an epidemic of a grave disease such as polio, before the disease can be acquired, an immunization can create a man-made &quot;memory&quot;.
*	Active immunization
A person receives an injection (vaccine) that contains dead or harmless living forms of an organism. The vaccine stimulates the immune system to produce antibodies and memorize the organism. If there is a later exposure to this organism and subsequent infection, the antibodies will stop the infection.
*	Passive immunization
Blood containing antibodies is taken from animals or humans who have recently had an infection. Blood serum is made that contains the antibodies, and then injected into the person. The antibodies either attack an infection that is present or provide short-term protection.
*	Genetically engineered viruses
Genetic engineering is a technique that alters or changes the DNA of a plant or animal by inserting new genetic information from another organism. After these organisms replicate, vaccines and hormones are made that can help fight disease.
*	Hepatitis B vaccine
The gene of the surface antigen of Hepatitis B virus is implanted into the DNA of a single bacterium. The bacteria produces viral antigens which are then implanted to stimulate the immune system.

==Immune System Disorders==

The immune system is a very complex and highly developed system, yet it has a very simple mission, seek and destroy invaders. When the immune system does not function properly it leaves the body open for attacks from an array of diseases. We classify these into three broad categories; autoimmunity, immunodeficiencies, and hypersensitivities.

Anything that can trigger the immune response is called an antigen. An antigen can be a microbe such as a virus, or even a part of a microbe. Tissues of cells from another person also carry nonself markers and act as antigens. This explains why tissue transplants can be rejected. In abnormal situations, the immune system can mistake self for nonself and launch an attack against the body's own cells or tissues. The result is called an autoimmune disease. Some forms of arthritis and diabetes are autoimmune diseases. In other cases, the immune system responds to a seemingly harmless foreign substance such as a dust mite. The result is allergy, and this kind of antigen is called an allergen.



==The Allergic response==

Type 1 hypersensitivity is an allergic reaction provoked by reexposure to a specific antigen. Exposure may be by ingestion, inhalation, injection, or direct contact. The reaction is mediated by IgE antibodies and produced by the immediate release of histamine, tryptase, arachidonate and derivatives by basophils and mast cells. This causes an inflammatory response leading to an immediate (within seconds to minutes) reaction.

The reaction may be either local or systemic. Symptoms vary from mild irritation to sudden death from anaphylactic shock. Treatment usually involves epinephrine, antihistamines, and corticosteroids.

*    '''Hay Fever'''
Hay fever involves an allergic reaction to pollen and results in allergic rhinitis (inflammation of the nasal mucosa). It is most common in the haying season, which is why the ailment was named hay fever. A virtually identical reaction occurs with allergy to mold, animal dander, dust, and similar inhaled allergens. Particulate matter in polluted air and chemicals such as chlorine and detergents, which can normally be tolerated, can greatly aggravate the condition. The pollens that cause hay fever vary from person to person and from region to region; generally speaking, the tiny, hardly visible pollens of wind-pollinated plants are the predominant culprits.


==Autoimmune Disorders==
For reasons we do not fully understand, sometimes the immune system attacks the body the way it normally would attack a germ or foreign substance. The genes some people inherit can contribute to their susceptibility to develop an autoimmune disease. Most autoimmune diseases affect woman more than men. 

*In '''Juvenile-onset diabetes''' the immune system starts attacking and eliminating the cells in the pancreas that make insulin. 

*'''Multiple Sclerosis''' is a chronic degenerative disorder of the central nervous system where the immune system starts attacking and destroying vital myelin in the brain and spinal cord. This causes multiple sclerosis (scars) on the myelin sheath resulting in loss of nerve function. 

*Another fairly known disorder is '''Rheumatoid Arthritis''' this is when the immune system starts attacking the tissue inside your joints. 

*There is another disorder, '''Organ and Tissue Transplants''', that is classified under immuno-deficiencies but in reality is not a failure of the immune system. In transplants, foreign tissue is placed inside the body. These tissues do not perfectly match the surrounding cells. The body sees this as something that should not be there and sends messages to attack and kill it. This can make transplanting nearly impossible. This problem can not be completely prevented but it can be diminished by making sure the donor tissue is a close match to the recipient tissue. In addition, the recipient is placed on immuno-suppressing drugs to try and prevent the immune system from attacking and rejecting the new organ or tissue.

*'''Vitiligo''' is an autoimmune disorder in which the immune system destroys pigment-making cells called melanocytes. This results in irregularly shaped milky-white patches of skin on different parts of the body. This is the condition which Michael Jackson claims to have had.

==Immunodeficiency Diseases==
When the immune system is presented with foreign antigens in association with dendritic cells, a vigorous immune response ensues. (Antigens are the molecules on the surface of invader cells that announce them as different from the body's cells.). Alternatively, dendritic cells can be exploited during the development of many immune based diseases.

*'''AIDS and HIV'''
Acquired immunodeficiency disease (AIDS) is a well-known immune system disease. Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome or Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS or Aids) is a collection of symptoms and infections resulting from the specific damage to the immune system caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).The late stage of the condition leaves individuals prone to opportunistic infections and tumors. Although treatments for AIDS and HIV exist to slow the virus's progression, there is no known cure. HIV is transmitted through direct contact of a mucous membrane or the bloodstream with a bodily fluid containing HIV, such as blood, semen, vaginal fluid, preseminal fluid, and breast milk.This transmission can come in the form of anal, vaginal or oral sex, blood transfusion, contaminated hypodermic needles, exchange between mother and baby during pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding, or other exposure to one of the above bodily fluids. AIDS is the most severe manifestation of infection with HIV. HIV is a retrovirus that primarily infects vital components of the human immune system such as CD4+ T cells (a subset of T cells), macrophages and dendritic cells. It directly and indirectly destroys CD4+ T cells. CD4+ T cells are required for the proper functioning of the immune system. When HIV kills CD4+ T cells so that there are fewer than 200 CD4+ T cells per microliter (µL) of blood, cellular immunity is lost, leading to the condition known as AIDS. Acute HIV infection progresses over time to clinical latent HIV infection and then to early symptomatic HIV infection and later to AIDS, which is identified on the basis of the amount of CD4+ T cells in the blood and the presence of certain infections.

In the absence of antiretroviral therapy, the median time of progression from HIV infection to AIDS is nine to ten years, and the median survival time after developing AIDS is only 9.2 months. However, the rate of clinical disease progression varies widely between individuals, from two weeks up to 20 years. Many factors affect the rate of progression. These include factors that influence the body's ability to defend against HIV such as the infected person's general immune function. Older people have weaker immune systems, and therefore have a greater risk of rapid disease progression than younger people. Poor access to health care and the existence of coexisting infections such as tuberculosis also may predispose people to faster disease progression. The infected person's genetic inheritance plays an important role and some people are resistant to certain strains of HIV.

==Different Types of T Lymphocyte Cells==
Several different subsets of T cells have been described, each with a distinct function.

'''''Cytotoxic T cells''''' (Tc cells) destroy virally infected cells and tumor cells, and are also implicated in transplant rejection. These cells are also known as CD8+ T cells, since they express the CD8 glycoprotein at their surface. 

'''''Helper T cells''''', (Th cells) are the &quot;middlemen&quot; of the adaptive immune system. Once activated, they divide rapidly and secrete small proteins called cytokines that regulate or &quot;help&quot; the immune response. These cells (also called CD4+ T cells) are a target of HIV infection; the virus infects the cell by using the CD4 protein to gain entry. The loss of Th cells as a result of HIV infection leads to the symptoms of AIDS. 

'''''Memory T cells''''' are a subset of antigen-specific T cells that persist long-term after an infection has resolved. They quickly expand to large numbers of effector T cells upon re-exposure to their cognate antigen, thus providing the immune system with &quot;memory&quot; against past infections.  Memory cells may be either CD4+ or CD8+. 

'''''Regulatory T cells''''' (Treg cells), formerly known as suppressor T cells, are crucial for the maintenance of immunological tolerance. Their major role is to shut down T cell mediated immunity towards the end of an immune reaction and to suppress auto-reactive T cells that escaped the process of negative selection in the thymus. Two major classes of regulatory T cells have been described, including the naturally occurring Treg cells and the adaptive Treg cells. 


'''''Treg cells''''' (also known as CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ Treg cells) arise in the thymus, whereas the adaptive Treg cells (also known as Tr1 cells or Th3 cells) may originate during a normal immune response. Naturally occurring Treg cells can be distinguished from other T cells by the presence of an intracellular molecule called FoxP3. Mutations of the FOXP3 gene can prevent regulatory T cell development, causing the fatal autoimmune disease IPEX. 

''''''Natural''' '''''Killer T cells'''''''' (NKT cells) are a special kind of lymphocyte that bridges the adaptive immune system with the innate immune system. Unlike conventional T cells that recognize peptide antigen presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, NKT cells recognize glycolipid antigen presented by a molecule called CD1d. Once activated, these cells can perform functions ascribed to both Th and Tc cells (i.e. cytokine production and release of cytolytic/cell killing molecules).

'''THE FUNCTIONS OF T LYMPHOCYTES'''
T lymphocytes cells help with all components of the immune system, including cell elimination by killer T cells and maintaining roles by helper and suppressor T cells. Although the specific mechanisms of activation vary slightly between different types of T cells, the &quot;two-signal model&quot; in CD4+ T cells holds true for most.

==The Immune System Pioneers==

	 
*Ilya Mechnikov and the Phagocyte Cells
	
In 1882, a Russian scientist named Ilya Mechnikov was experimenting with the larvae of the sea star. He stuck a thorn in the larvae and then he noticed that something really weird happened. Strange cells started gathering near the point of insertion. The cells that were surrounding the thorn were eating any foreign substance that was entering through the ruptured skin. Mechnikov decided to name these new cells &quot;phagocytes&quot;, in Greek meaning &quot;devouring cells.&quot;

This discovery was very important since it helped scientists understand how the body defends itself against disease. If the phagocyte encountered anything foreign, they attack/arrest or destroy it; all dependent on the foreign substance. Phagocytes also play an important part in activating the immune response in the rest of the body. 	

  	  	
*Paul Ehrlich and the Side-chain Theory
Ehrlich supposed that living cells have side-chains. These side chains can link with a particular toxin, just as Emil Fisher said enzymes must bind to their receptors &quot;like a key in a lock.&quot;

He theorized that a cell under threat grew additional side-chains to bind the toxin, and that these additional side chains broke off to become the antibodies that circulate through the body. It was these antibodies that Ehrlich first described as &quot;magic bullets&quot; in search of toxins.

Ehrlich figured that if a compound could be made that selectively targeted a disease causing organism, then a toxin for that organism could be delivered along with the agent of selectivity. Hence, a &quot;magic bullet&quot; would be created that killed only the organism targeted.

Ehrlich predicted autoimmunity calling it &quot;horror autotoxicus&quot;.

In 1908, Ehrlich and Mechnikov received the Nobel Prize.

Stephanie,

Glad to see you jumping right in and making some changes. Keep it up! [[User:Provophys|Provophys]] 03:45, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

== Very Active! ==

Stephanie,

It seems like whenever I am browsing new changes I see your name! I appreciate the time you are putting into this project. Are you finding it to be educational? Do you have any suggestions for others? ~Kevin [[User:Provophys|Provophys]] 22:24, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

== Your table of hormones ==

I thought the hormone table looked good--am I missing something, or did you figure it out, or did someone else figure it out? I found it a bit confusing to have the blue headings for pituitary gland, adrenal gland and gonads. At first I liked it, but then I thought it made it seems like there were three groups of glands with subgroups (made it seem like thyroid was part of pituitary). So I deleted those rows and I bolded the gland names. Let me know if there is some specific formatting you are trying to accomplish with the table and I can try to help.

The formatting in the enzyme table above was messed up because you did not include the | for the blank cells. I fixed it for Carbohydrate digestion and Protein digestion but left it for the others so you can compare.

Thanks for all the good work you are doing!

I think that a full policy proposal page is unnecessary. Thus far this is a one-time event. It is really blown out of proportion to expand it into an over-arching policy. We don't even know how the current process will turn out &amp;mdash; [[User:Iamunknown|User:Iamunknown]] 04:35, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

:Unfortunately a preceedent is being set here.  I am open to suggestions on how to improve this whole process, or perhaps to find a way to avoid having something blow up like this.  Indeed, I want to point out that in the past, instead of trying to seek arbitration as would be covered under this policy, several users instead sought out explicitly to bring in [[User:Jimbo Wales]] into the discussion.  Often this met with disasterous results, in terms of ill will flowing through the Wikibooks community.  I don't need to go into details, but my talk page alone is plenty sufficient to show some of the issues that have occured in the past.

:We need to come up with some reasonable policies on when it is legitimate to block a long-time user who has shown some substantial quality edits in the past, but is causing some current problems in terms of editorial control of pages that other users resent.  That seems to be the largest issue at the moment, and how to resolve these issues when it goes beyond the module talk pages.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:30, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

== Arbitration Procedures ==

Let's discuss what we like and what we hate about arbitration here, including specific steps we'd like to take when arbitrating. I'd also like to hear what people think on who should be the arbitrators. A rotating group of admins? Bureaucrats maybe? -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 02:11, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

Perhaps arbitration should fit the problem:

* If someone continually reverts text or violates no personal attacks then there is a behavioural dispute - a disciplinary procedure should be used.

* If two editors vehemently disagree about content the solution might be to offer some sort of ad hoc editorial board to resolve the issue or, if this is refused, enforce a discussion period mediated by an admin and, if this doesnt work, include both views in the book. Both views would only be included in a final, published edition of the book if permitted by the editorial board that reviews that edition.

* If two editors vehemently disagree about presentation an ad hoc editorial board should give binding arbitration (you cant really have 2 presentations).

So, suppose there is a disagreement about how to structure a Programming book.  

1 Someone involved in the dispute should complain to an admin.

2 The admin should decide that this is a presentation issue.  

3 If there are reverts going on then an admin should stop the reverts and warn contributors that this is a quick way to be banned.

4. The admin should approach three [[Wikibooks:Volunteer editors|volunteer editors]] in the appropriate field.

5. The [[Wikibooks:Editorial board|editorial board]] should approve one or other presentations or suggest a third way.

6. The editors should vote and produce a binding solution.

7. If the disputants re-open the dispute then the party who is at fault (reverting the board's decision) should be warned that this is now a behaviour issue.

In the case of a content dispute the disputants can agree to include both points of view or can call in an editorial board for a binding decision (once invoked the board's decision would need to be binding to prevent time wasting). If both points of view are included then any published edition will take the point of view favoured by the editorial board that reviews the book at that stage.

It should be the responsibility of the admin who begins the procedure to follow it through to the end.
[[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 12:51, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

:I think the fourth step should be removed and the editorial board immediately contacted through the arbitration page (all members of the board will need to watch the Arbitration page) by one of the editors, an involved mentor or admin. Furthermore, I don't think everyone who considers him/herself to be on this board should be allowed to be an arbitrator. Either something like admins on the board be the only possible arbitrators or there is a voting process to choose who is on the board. Some members may not have the appropriate skills to be an arbitrator. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 19:47, 27 January 2007 (UTC)

::The admin would need to chair the proceedings. Perhaps the admin could act as the communication channel between the disputants and the board. The admin could present the editorial board's view, then feed back the disputant's reactions then present the final board opinion. If the dispute is about content the disputants can always agree to have both points of view in the book. It is only on the presentational issues that fireworks could occur. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 15:05, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

:::Having a middle-man admin just wastes time as I see it. With a properly-chosen editorial board, this doesn't need to happen. Volunteer editors shouldn't have anything to do with this. When binding decisions are made, you can't have possibly inexperienced users threatening the decision process because that then weakens the strength of the decision and the power of the board's actions. Disputants can talk directly with the board in a subpage of the Arbitration page. I don't think content or other small-impact decisions should be discussed in arbitration since they can be handled with the previous three steps of dispute resolution. Only large-impact issues will be dealt with here. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 19:54, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

:This I think can be divided into two separate problems:
:#Disputes over module content, between two well-meaning users
:#Disputes involving policy violations, including abuse of power by admins.
:I would say that in the first place, mediation would be the solution the two sides would contact a neutral mediator (we could maintain a list of people willing to play this role) who would in turn decide the matter one way or the other. People who enter into mediation, and violate the final decision, could be subject to some kind of discipline. I would say that for disputes involving module content, an editorial board could serve as the third-party entity for purposes of mediation. This would require, of course, the existance of a standing editorial board (or the ability to create an ad hoc board for the purposes of the mediation). For the second case, we would use an arbitration hearing, where a standing board of arbiters (an &quot;arbcom&quot;, if we may recycle that term for our own uses) who would hear dispute cases and pass verdict. People on such an arbcom should be well-versed in wikibooks policy matters, they should be trusted, and they should be active. I think it is a serious misuse of arbitration to handle matters of book content. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:02, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

::Well said. Content disputes should involve experts. Behaviour disputes should involve admins.  When disputes get to arbitration they have become serious and the disputants have lost patience with each other.  As you point out, the next step is a hearing and judgement.

::If the disputants are behaving well but have a serious dispute about content or presentation then the possibility of editorial judgement may actually stop the dispute from becoming a behaviour problem. 
::[[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 09:41, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

:::This is the kind of thing that should make it into the text of the dispute resolution proposal. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 15:14, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

::::I've made some changes over at [[Wikibooks:Resolving disputes]]. I think we need to restructure the Editorial board somewhat so that it's more of a policy than a Wikiproject maybe? I think a voted set of editors in various categories should form this board. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 00:39, 30 January 2007 (UTC)
:(reset)I would agree that something so important as an editorial board, especially if it is a prescribed step in the official dispute resolution process, should be more then just a mere wikiproject. However, an editorial board requires readers here to volunteer their expertise, and many situations may arise in which there simply are no people knowledgable in a subject on which there is a dispute. It seems likely to me that for many subjects, all the people who are knowledgable are going to be involved already in the dispute over the book content. I don't mean to completely contradict my previous statements on the matter, i'm just trying to think critically (and do the thinking out loud) before we go rushing to make all sorts of new policy proposals, and insert new wordings into existing proposals. We have two options, as i see it, and both come with inherent drawbacks:
:#Editors are picked from a pool of volunteers, as needed, depending on expertise. In this situation, we run the risk of not having any candidates for such a board (or a woefully insufficient amount), or having people on the board who know their subject well, but are relatively new to wikibooks (and therefore unlikely to make great decisions).
:#Editors are predetermined (elected by the community, volunteer for certain &quot;terms&quot;, or something). We would always have enough people for such a board, but the people might not always be knowledgable on the subject at hand.
:There are also some hybrid approaches we could try (some established wikibookians, and some topical experts). Either way, if we are going to make it more then an informal wikiproject, we are going to need to hammer out alot of details. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:54, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

::I've left some comments at [[Wikibooks talk:Editorial board]] regarding this approach which I agree with. I'd prefer two boards that work within their own &quot;spheres of influence&quot; since these two dispute issues are quite different and require different approaches. Also, I prefer the second approach of a general board of several all-around knowledgeable editors. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 22:33, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

== Arbitration Committee ==

I think that we should use this page as a policy proposal to establish a standing arbitration committee. We could create such a committee either by a vote (as is done at wikipedia), or through some other mechanism. I feel strongly that such a committee should be very limited: it should only hear cases that worked through and failed at the previous three steps in the [[Wikibooks:Dispute resolution]] policy (proposal). With proposals being created currently to establish an editorial board, we need to ask ourselves a few questions:
#Should it be possible for any member to simultanously be a member of both editorial board and ArbCom?
#How will the arbcom be composed? What qualifications should members have (if anything in particular).
#What authority should the arbcom have?
If we can answer these questions, I think we will be well on our way to having a good policy here. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:13, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

:I'm sure the third will require a large response and I'm not quite ready to provide one, but for one I think that being on both committees will be fine and for two I figure we will have a long-standing vote for three or so users. We don't have enough action here that a user could not serve both groups by how I see it. If the user is active enough and voted in with the necessary substantial support, I think it's fine. Perhaps every year we will choose a new committee of active, experienced users. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 03:32, 31 January 2007 (UTC)

::A yearly basis may be a bit too long, considering the small community and frequent changing of the guard. However, if we make it more frequent, it will become tedious. We could alleviate some of the problems by staggering the vote: elect a small portion at regular intervals (a quarter of the board every 3 months) so that nothing was stagnant. Ignoring the first question, we are only left with the question of authority, and you are right in thinking it will be a long discussion before we get that hammered out. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 04:02, 31 January 2007 (UTC)

:::Staggering the users seems like an acceptable plan. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 22:45, 31 January 2007 (UTC)

::::I'm going to take the few ideas that we've discussed here, and draft a quick proposal for this issue. I'll keep this page the same, and instead create a page at [[Wikibooks:Arbitration Committee]]. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:52, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello, welcome to Wikibooks!

I saw your note on the [[Podcasting]] book. The last substantial contributions were made to that book in June 2006, and since then it has been completely abandoned. That makes you the &quot;author&quot; of the book, if you choose to take that job. So, in answer to your question, you get to make the decisions, and take the book in any direction that you see fit. 

I don't know anything about podcasting, so i can't help write the content, but if you have any other questions, or if you need any other help, dont hesitate to ask me [[User talk:Whiteknight|on my user talk page]].

== monitor pros and cons ==

I was very careful to only list advantages, because ''everything'' can be listed as both an advantage and as a disadvantage. A more negative way would be to list only disadvantages. I think it is best to just go back to only listing advantages, but I can fill in the numerous CRT disadvantages...

Going to a table is another way to deal with things.

                  old    analogLCD    digitalLCD
               --------- -----------  -----------
 weight           high       low         low
 shipping cost    high        low        low
 purchase cost    low      medium       high
 etc.              blah      blah        blah

BTW, I can supply test images that show just how horrible a CRT is. Here:
http://www.cs.uml.edu/~acahalan/lcd/

:I get the point. LCDs don't have certain flaws. The link is just a test pattern. In actual use, I've never had the problem, but the problem does display on my screen. I won't be switching anytime, unless they can replicate the glow of phosphors. Something about the glow is just the right intensity and everything. The backlighting on many of them washes out the color. Maybe OLED will do the trick. But I doubt that OLED will be able to display more than one resolution.
::Ah yes. Tube amps and vinyl LPs, right? I find colors to be much better on an LCD, but that's with an all-digital system of course. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 00:29, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:Either way, why are anlog and digital LCDs seprate. Isn't the only diffrence, that the analog has to put the video signal through a DAC? And could you please make it a little more NPOV than it's current state.[[User:Reub2000|Reub2000]] 21:56, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)
::That difference is huge. An analog connection will cause a monitor to fail the test pattern. (not as badly as a CRT though) An analog connection will cause an unsteady image, about as bad as you get with a CRT. An analog connection will allow crosstalk (blue leaks into red, etc.) in the cable. Half the reason to own an LCD is discarded if you connect it to an analog port.
::Go into a store some time and look for an [[w:Apple_Cinema_Display|Apple Cinema Display]] (20&quot; or 23&quot;, about 1920x1280) or Apple Cinema Display HD (30&quot;, 2560x1600). The quality is stunning. Even the cheap Apple displays are high quality, though smaller.
::As for NPOV, I think the article is more than fair to the obsolete dead-end technology. It isn't right to suggest that normal people buy such displays. It's like telling people to buy turntables instead of CD players. Soon it will be time to just delete the CRT info, because CRTs won't be sold. It's happening already.
:::A little info on the NPOV policy: [[w:Wikipedia:Neutral point of view]]. In your current form, it is your bias against CRT monitors.
::::First of all, that's not wikibooks. Second of all, there was no bias. I simply listed the flaws. I take it that you would rather cover this up. Why? The old version was horribly biased, by failing to present all the flaws of CRTs. It made CRTs look almost as good as LCDs, which is simply not factual.
:::::OK, so [[Wikibooks:NPOV dispute|this]] is wikibooks. It doesn't change the facts that wikipedia and wikibooks use the same npov policy. The article can't blatently show bias against CRTs. Neither can it show bias against LCD panels. The article does say that if you don't need the speed of CRTs, that you should use an LCD. IMO pretty fair, and doesn't attack either, but tells who should get each type of display.

OK, I listed all the facts. If the facts look better for one type, oh well. That '''is not bias''' at all. Bias would be any suggestion that this is a fairly even choice, in direct contradiction to the facts.

Check this out:
*92.6 pounds, 1920x1200, 22.5&quot; viewable, $1999, SONY GDM-FW900
*15.5 pounds, 1920x1200, 23.0&quot; viewable, $1799, Apple Cinema HD Display
*27.5 pounds, 2560x1600, 29.7&quot; viewable, $2999, Apple Cinema HD Display

So... the CRT is 0.5 inch smaller, 6x the weight ('''Geeez! 92.6 pounds!'''), and just shy of 2 feet deep. It even costs more, and that's not counting the shipping. What a deal! [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 16:16, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:Your comparing it to a sony display, which explains that. My Mitsubishi Dimond Pro 930SB is 51.5lb, has a max resolution of 1920x1440, and only cost me $300. My NEC Multisysc FE991SB, has a slightly lower max res, has a horizonatal refresh of 96hz (1600x1200@75Hz or 1280x1024@85hz) and costed me $270, and weighs 50.1lb. Both of them had only $25 shipping each, much less than the diffence between it and an LCD. Only once have I had to move them, when I got them. The weight would definitly be a problem if I frequented LAN parties, but I don't. 2 19&quot; monitors for less than your super big LCD display. [[User:Reub2000|Reub2000]] 17:41, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)

::I think Sony is pretty much the standard. I didn't go searching for the worst case. I just picked the first name-brand CRT I found that was about the same size as the 23&quot; (mid-size) Apple display. Note that the Sony is advertised as a 24&quot; display; I made sure the viewable area was similar. I listed the 30&quot; Apple display too because the Sony is both heavier and more expensive than the 23&quot; Apple display. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 19:56, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:::Sony is not the standard, lol. No, their stuff is known as overpriced.

::::First, I didn't happen to see anything else decent sized. Second, I really do think Sony is the standard. That's what I've mostly seen in the USA in business use. Mitsubishi does not exist. I have seen NEC being used.

Most LCD displays will scale an image properly. Sometimes the fancy digital ones won't bother to try, and sometimes the crappy ones won't do a good job, but the typical LCD will do just fine.

If you think your CRT display is perfectly flat, please, put a ruler to it. Do this both vertically and horizontally. In case you somehow have a &quot;flat&quot; display, take a good look at the thickness of the glass. It's not the glass that matters, but where the image is floating. Thick glass around the edges is cheating. Hint: a Trinitron display is cylindrical.

CRTs are known for causing seizures. True, you have to be susceptable, so &quot;commonly&quot; refers to such people.

Moire defects are '''not''' only on a test pattern. The test pattern is not some magic image. Heck, I've seen moire effects on a CRT when using the '''default X background'''. (From the Linux console, type &quot;X&quot; to start up X without GNOME or KDE. Use Alt-Ctrl-Backspace to exit.)

Who are you to say that the X-ray radiation is &quot;low&quot;? Compared to what? Surely not any other display technology.
This is a NPOV problem.

The same for dust. Factual: &quot;yes&quot;. POV: &quot;a little&quot;.

Apreture grill displays are cylindrical. They are usually flat in the vertical direction.

Evidence for being fragile... well, what do you think the support wires are for? Try dropping your display on the table a few times. You'll knock the apreture grill out of alignment.

:It's a test pattern, besides for the few things you have brought up, I've never had repeating vertical lines displayed like that. And the x-ray radioation is compared to what is safe. I've spent most of my life infront of a CRT with no ill effect. I made it more NPOV, but then you reverted what you didn't like. [[User:Reub2000|Reub2000]] 17:44, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:PS. when would a monitor be dropped on a table?

::Lots of people have trouble being gentle when trying to set down a bulky object that weighs 50 to 100 pounds.


===commonly disputed issues===

*flatness
*:If you can't lay a ruler against it in any direction w/o any gap, it's '''not flat'''. Also, &quot;spherical&quot; and &quot;cylindrical&quot; are hard for most people to understand. It's better to just say &quot;curvy&quot;, which actually sounds not as bad. (See? I try not to make the CRT look worse than the facts require.)
*::If I put a ruler up against my monitor, it wouldn't curve. It's perectly flat. But I won't do that because I don't want to scratch my screen.[[User:Reub2000|Reub2000]] 01:46, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)
*:::I'll have to try this test in a computer store some time, because so far I've never seen a truly flat CRT. I've seen plenty of curved ones that were claimed to be flat though. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 02:54, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)
*:::: Just thought I would add a very belated comment that the screen of my elderly CRT -- an NEC MultiSync FE950+ -- IS totally flat. (Yes, I tried putting a (non-flexible) ruler up against it and there are no gaps, not even at the edges.) I got it in 2002 and it sure has been an excellent display and (knock on wood) is still working great seven years later. For someone putting together a system cheaply, a used one of these could be a good buy if from a local source so you could check it out thoroughly &amp; wouldnt have to pay shipping --wichienmaat 

*trinitron support wires
*:They are easy to see. Obviously they don't show up on black. Fill the screen with light grey though, and there they are, plain as could be. (not white, because blooming -- another CRT defect -- may hide the problem)
*::Still barely visable. It's a fraction of a millimeter, and barely any darker than the screen. [[User:Reub2000|Reub2000]] 01:46, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)
*air conditioning cost
*:This is real, well-known, and obvious. Feel the top of your CRT. Compare the watt rating. Providing actual numbers is fairly useless because air conditioning cost varies with the temperature setting, outside temperature, and many other factors. If you really want numbers though, NEC provides some numbers that combine both direct power consumption and AC power consumption. NEC claims that 4 years of operation with AC efficiency of 1.2 will cost $8696 for 500 15&quot; LCDs and $36560 for 500 17&quot; CRTs, for a savings of $27864.
*::$18/Year/CRT monitor. Not very much. [[User:Reub2000|Reub2000]]
*:::Well, how many years do you keep a display? Your average monitor cost was $285, but I don't know what that would cost you today. If you keep a monitor for 5 years, a $13.93 per year difference comes to $70. So you could buy a $355 monitor for the same end cost. You have 19&quot; monitors though, meaning the savings with LCDs would be bigger for you. (perhaps allowing for $400 LCDs) [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 02:54, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)
*::::But can this $400 LCD display UT2K4 at 1600x1200 and my desktop at 1280x1024 and starcraft at 640x480? [[User:Reub2000|Reub2000]] 14:59, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)
*:::::It looks like nobody wants such a display. You have to move up to 20&quot; viewable to get 1600x1200. Dell had such a screen on sale for $507. If 1280x1024 is fine though, you can get a 12 ms (83 redraws per second) display for $209 and an 8 ms (125 redraws per second) display for $235.
*resolutions
*:This is a gamer thing, and only because most games fail to scale as desired by the user. It would be highly unusual to run desktop apps at non-native resolution. Hopefully, with the increasing usage of non-4:3 displays, this problem will soon be behind us.
*::No this is not just a gamer thing. My granny has a 19&quot; 1280x1024 LCD screen. Her eyesight is poor, so she runs her desktop at 800x600. This makes the screen blurry. Many 17&quot; LCD screens run at 1280x1024. IMO, a more appropriate resolution for 17&quot; is 1024x768. And 16:9 screens for computers makes no sense at all. Watching movies in 2.35:1 on a 16:9 screen makes perfect sense, but most computer documents are are long, but not wide, making a 4:3 screen better suited for the task. And the gaming issue is not about aspect ratios. I'm a StarCraft addict, a game that only plays in 640x480. Also, many computers may not even be capable of playing games at the computers resolution. My computer can only play half-life 2 at 1280x1024. Good thing I wasn't playing it on your apple cinima display. [[User:Reub2000|Reub2000]] 01:46, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)
*:::That's truly sad. Your granny needs help with system settings. Go adjust the DPI setting or set a &quot;large fonts&quot; mode for her. She'll like that a lot better, because the letters have better shapes when they have more pixels. Probably a projector would have been better though, allowing for a nice 50&quot; display. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 02:54, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)
*:::StarCraft is a crummy old game. What else is there to say? Someday you might run it in an emulator that does nice scaling, just as people do with old game cartridge ROM images in arcade machine emulators. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 02:54, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)
*::::I like it, it's a nice game. I don't see windows or the x86 architechetue going anywhere, so I'll be playing it nativly on Windows. [[User:Reub2000|Reub2000]]
*:::::Windows will be gone in a decade or two, possibly a tad less. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 16:47, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)
*::::::What makes you say so? [[User:Reub2000|Reub2000]]
*:::::::Lots of reasons. First, look back two decades in the other direction. People thought DOS would be forever, and they were pretty much wrong. (WinXP may have cmd.exe, but that isn't really DOS) Second, worldwide economics and politics don't really support Windows. China, India, Brazil... all prefer Linux at government level. Many smaller places do too, totalling a big portion of the world population. Places where a salary is $2000/year are unable to support the legal use of Windows. As these places become more developed, their choices will exert a pull on the rest of the world. Third, even in the developed world things are slowly changing. Given enough time, that change will amount to something. A decade or two is very long for the computer industry, but not all that long for society. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 01:22, 16 Apr 2005 (UTC)
*:::16:9 screens are great for documents. Your work habits change. I put 2 or 3 documents side by side. Well, it's like having a dual-monitor setup without the seam down the middle. (presuming you don't do an over-under dual-monitor setup, which would be really unusual) [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 02:54, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)
*::::The split doesn't bother me, because I never spread a window over both monitors. I noticed that you mentioned poor support for dual monitors. I've had a few dialog boxes in between the monitors, but nothing major. No major problems with linux, with xinerama. BTW, I could have gotten a 21 inch CRT for a litte less than the price as my monitors, but I wanted dual-monitors. But 4:3 makes more sense that 16:9. The only point of 16:9 is because most people thing it's better.[[User:Reub2000|Reub2000]]
*:::::A 21&quot; CRT would be about 19&quot; viewable. I found a 20&quot; viewable LCD (bigger), analog+digital, 1600x1200, for $592. Shipping was free of course, plus there is the power savings. Sale prices go as low as $507. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 16:47, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)
*::::::2 of those would be sweet. 3200x1200 is such a perfect resolution. But a 21&quot; CRT has a 20&quot; veiwable area.
*X-ray radiation vs. X-ray emmision
*:In this case, ''emmision'' is a euphemism. X-rays are ionizing radiation. They are mutagenic and carcinagenic. Perhaps &quot;cancer-causing electromagnetic waves&quot; would be better? :-)
*::I think you should not get on an airplane, get a dental x-ray, because you'll be exposed to radiation. Seriously, don't use the word radiation unless you mean gamma radation, what most people associate the word radiation with.[[User:Reub2000|Reub2000]] 01:46, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)
*:::As far as heath goes, what does this matter? Both gamma and X-ray radiation are ionizing. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 02:54, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)
*::::The word radiation will just scare people. Everywhere I've seen says it's withing safe levels. [[User:Reub2000|Reub2000]]
*eyestrain-causing image wiggle when near large motors
*:This is caused by the electron beam being bent, so it applies to all CRTs. If the grid/grill thing ever moves enough to matter, you should get your office out of the elevator shaft.
*::Get you office outta therr anyways. [[User:Reub2000|Reub2000]]
*:::My former landlord, living upstairs from me, had a washing machine that would make my CRT image wiggle enough to give an instant headache. I could always tell when she was washing clothes. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 02:54, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)
*bad small white-on-black text
*:This is caused by an interaction between non-linear (not 1.0) gamma and the frequency limitation of an analog system. Consider the '+' character, which can look somewhat like a '-' character. The analog signal, on the cable or in the form of an electron beam, must respond abruptly by going from 0% to 100% to 0% as the character is scanned from one side to the other. (you can see why the analog LCD would be half-way bad) Consider a whole row of text, and the desired voltage as a square wave. A true square wave is impossible; you'll get some blurring. This would be moderatly bad if 50% voltage indicated 50% brightness. Because of the gamma equation though, 50% brightness requires about 75% voltage. When the square wave is getting blurred, ''voltage'' is being averaged out. An even cycle of white and black turns into dark grey, not 50% grey. Getting back to the '+' character now, the horizontal bar will be mostly OK. The points come out a bit dark, but that matters little. The vertical bar is terrible, because the beam intensity never gets very high. Note that black-on-white text is decent, with stuff like the center of an '@' coming out a bit dark instead of pure white.
*::Looks OK to me. Though text does get blurred in the corners of my screen, while your plus sign is in the center.[[User:Reub2000|Reub2000]] 01:46, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)
*:::In the standard 6x13 &quot;fixed&quot; font, I usually couldn't tell a '+' from a '-' when running white-on-black with 1152x864 on a 16&quot; CRT with a decent refresh rate. I had to switch to a 10x20 font, which made the vertical bar be 2 pixels wide. The 21&quot; Sony CRTs commonly given to software developers are a bit better, with things being readable (slowly) at 1600x1200. (again, with a decent refresh rate) [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 02:54, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)
*Backlight causes colors to be washed out
*:This is not generally true. Maybe eMachines still sells stuff with that problem, but I'd also expect them to ship CRTs that don't come close to showing black. LCD displays have been certified by printing press and graphics organizations for pre-press proofing usage. This means that the colors are good enough to rely on for printing up sales flyers and such. [http://images.apple.com/displays/pdf/Displays_TO_06282004.pdf more info here]
*::On plenty of LCD displays, I've seen the issue. My granny's LCD from Dell does it. My cell phone and clie do it. [[User:Reub2000|Reub2000]] 01:46, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)
*:::I'll count the Dell display if it is a recent desktop display. The others are not computers. Laptop LCDs are purposely designed to mangle colors for extra-low power consumption. I'll insist that you count my old CRT though, which looks grey when it is off. In other words, this is not an LCD-vs.-CRT issue. It's just a matter of buying old display tech. FYI, I've never seen a CRT that could produce colors as well as my LCD. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 02:54, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)
*makes faint high-pitched noise
*:Yes, really. CRTs make some people want to climb the walls. My mom can hear them just fine. The noise comes from the horizontal refresh. As the magnets bend the electron bean (at 15 kHz for example - it varies), they also vibrate. Humans sense vibrations as sound, so there you go.
*::Must be masked by the sound of my computers. There are 3 of them in my office.[[User:Reub2000|Reub2000]]
*:::More likely, you don't have ears that can pick up the sound. It's often a ''really'' high pitch. People who detect the sound can often hear it through walls and over all sorts of background noice. It's piercing, if you have the ears to pick it up. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 02:54, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)
*::::I'm only 17. I think my ears should pick up pretty high sound. But louder noises will mask softer noises. Lossy audio codecs take advantage of this. [[User:Reub2000|Reub2000]] 22:47, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)
*:::::I suppose you got unlucky. Probably you are male, which would go against you. At age 17 or 18, I was able to hear the noise very well for one computer at school, and on a few other computers if I really tried. Some people can hear any normal TV set tube.

*makes noise when turning on or changing resolution
*:This is very uncool. It's like having exposed screw heads on the outside of your car, tape on your glasses, a floor that groans and squeaks, duct tape patching mouse holes in your walls, an elevator that makes loud clattering noises...

I think we'll both agree that CRT and LCD displays have their place. I like CRTs. You obviously like LCDs. Nothing is going to change that. (I do think that OLED will eventually replace LCDs, and maybe even CRTs.)

We have the development section to allow you to work on big things without disrupting the flow of the book.  This is a case of flow, and the table disrupted it.

******A few highlights from Albert's new section that he decided was better than the old:
*******&quot;Modern computer displays use a thin flat LCD panel with the DVI-D digital connector.&quot;
*******&quot;Just as some people love tube amps and vinyl LP records, some people love the older monitor technology based on the CRT. Most people will want to avoid this dying technology.&quot;
******[[User:Reub2000|Reub2000]]
*******Yes. Both are true. VGA, with the 15-pin connector, is a 1987 standard. It is being (slowly) replaced. DVI-D is the replacement. Some people do indeed love the old CRT technology, believe it or not. Most likely they are not aware of how good a modern LCD can be, but some seem to be more motivated by nostalgia. LCD sales are higher than CRT sales, with the difference increasing every day. CRT owners will be stuck paying fees to dispose of their CRTs, or illegally dumping their CRTs to avoid the fees. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 19:06, 17 Apr 2005 (UTC)
********More likely they are aware of how much LCDs '''SUCK'''. Why would I spend more money on a screen that can only do one resolution. Maybe they want the versatility of a CRT that can do any resolution from 640x480 to 2056x1536. Or maybe they just want a dirt cheap shadow mask display. LCDs have their place in portable electronics, but they don't have a place on my desk.[[User:Reub2000|Reub2000]] 20:08, 17 Apr 2005 (UTC)

**CRTs do not have &quot;generally superior response times&quot; anymore. A low-end LCD has a 25 ms refresh. This allows for 40 '''full''' updates per second; many more updates can be done if simply changing the shade of grey instead of going full-scale between black and white. Most LCDs today have a 12 ms refresh, which allows for 83 full updates per second. I've seen 8 ms too, which allows for 125 full updates per second. Now, how many do you think a CRT can do? About the same. At best you have the refresh rate, but the CRT also has a bit of a lag in the phosphors. Lots of people run CRTs with 72 Hz (13.9 ms) or 75 Hz (13.3 ms) refresh. I've never heard of anyone claiming that a high refresh rate was critical for low-latency game play. So this whole point is looking like FUD to me. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 16:01, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)
*** If you read what I said regarding game-play refresh, I say that &quot;25ms response is usually enough for general gaming&quot;.  As for the Low-latency gaming, I have heard many arguments to support it - gamers generally prefer CRTs - this is a very hard to ignore fact.  As for the commonly used refresh rates, I would be struggling to find a high-end gamer who runs at 75Hz during games.  I run my CRT on 65Hz when using normal desktop stuff, and bump it up to 100 for gaming.  Most LCDs that would fall under a reasonable price for most people run between 12 and 15ms response, which is good enough for many purposes, but will fail for high-level gaming.  
**A year or two ago it was definitely true that &quot;the best response times can often come at a vastly increased price&quot;. (40 ms was common) Now, a 12 ms display is very affordable. I suppose you could change your idea of &quot;the best&quot; to 8 ms, but anything much below 25 ms is overkill already. You might be needing an eyeball upgrade to appreciate it. Remember that NTSC video (US TV standard) is only 16.7 ms, PAL video (Euro TV standard) is only 20 ms, and the LCD response numbers are for full black-white transitions that don't usually happen in FPS games.

***A 12ms response-time analog LCD will still cost 2-and-a-half times that of a 100Hz, same-sized CRT - that seems to be vastly increased to me.  And, if you want to go down to 8ms, then you will be paying between 3.5 - 4 times as much.  --[[User:Noogz|Noogz]] 10:51, 19 Apr 2005 (UTC)
**You left out: annoying sounds, X-ray radiation, hadardous waste disposal fee, adjustment if you even move a big CRT to face a different direction (north vs. west), [http://www.cs.uml.edu/~acahalan/lcd/ moire patterns] commonly seen on desktop wallpaper and web page backgrounds, large motors causing a wiggly image that leads to headaches even if you are not conscious of the motion, operating costs (both financial and to the environment), and the general problem of tiny white-on-black text being difficult to read at high resolution. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 16:01, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)
*** The annoying sounds that you mentioned in your original article only occur when the screen is deactivated (loud &quot;boings&quot;), and the high-pitched noises can only be heard in a completely silent room - when you add fan noise and speakers they are both ignored.  Those Moire patterns generally only happen in the worst of circumstances - Most wallpapers and backgrounds don't use such intricate patterns anymore.  Yes they can happen, but they won't occur in normal usage - Test patterns generally force the worse.  --[[User:Noogz|Noogz]] 10:51, 19 Apr 2005 (UTC)
**You also left out information on an LCDs Native Resolution. Not only is it usful information for someone deciding between a CRT and an LCD, but it usful for someone deciding between diffrent LCD screens. [[User:Reub2000|Reub2000]] 16:44, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)
***I think &quot;Especially when running at the native resolution, this gives you the sharpest and most stable image.&quot; covers that fairly well. Running at non-native resolution is kind of crummy, but usually no worse than you'd get from a CRT. Modern LCD scaling is quite good. One might mention that vision problems are best handled by changing the system's dpi and font settings, allowing for characters with much better shapes. Using a 6x12 font made big on a CRT or scaled up to be 10x20 on an LCD is nowhere near as nice as a real 10x20 font on an LCD. Often these changes are as simple as picking a different theme. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 17:59, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)
**** I have run my own, and my friends' LCDs at lower resolutions, and have definitely experienced scaling problems, that are definitely much worse than those of CRTS.  CRT scaling is generally MUCH BETTER than that of an LCD.  --[[User:Noogz|Noogz]] 10:51, 19 Apr 2005 (UTC)

* One thing I highly want to stress here is that both of you are displaying a highly biased view of your own choice of monitor.  When you edit the article, do try to keep in mind a general consumer - weigh up what a normal consumer would use, as normal consumers are who we are targetting.  --[[User:Noogz|Noogz]] 10:51, 19 Apr 2005 (UTC)</text>

|description =The Bourbon Red is a handsome breed of turkey with white feathers at its wing tips and tail, and brownish burgundy feathers covering most of the rest of its body. It has a bluish wattle, a black beard, and pink shanks and toes.  The Red Bourbon is named for Bourbon County, Kentucky where the breed was developed in the late 1800's by J. F. Barbee. Recognized by the American Poultry Association in 1909, it became a commercially important breed in the 1930's and 1940's. Its decline is attributed to the popularity of broad-breasted varieties such as the Broad-breasted White.

For more images of the Bourbon Red, see

== Enthnomedicine ==

Hi - I'm guessing as an original contributor to this you may be interested in looking at the comments (constructive ones!) made on the VfD page for your book.  Certainly there are some issues there that you should be aware of and maybe they will help to improve the book and the grades [[Wikibooks:Votes_for_deletion#Ethnomedicine]] - regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 08:26, 6 March 2007 (UTC)

The VfD did offer some good ideas, disclaimer etc. The book should probably be divided up into sections. There has been an increase in references and a re-framing of the intended use. A learning experience all around. --[[User:Paul James|Paul James]] 08:38, 6 March 2007 (UTC)

:That is great - there was no way it should have been deleted but some of the comments looked useful - regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 08:40, 6 March 2007 (UTC)

== Pilgrimage ==
I have had difficulties with all the coding and steps. Thank you for your help editing. 

I have added my content but forgot to not it in the summary section when i submitted. I hope that you look to my contributions page as a proof that I did indeed contribute. Thank you! [[User talk:peterson9949|talk]]

== Abbreviations ==

Hi, IMO = in my opinion, sorry about the confusion! I probably shouldn't use abbreviations like that but that one slipped. Have a good day! Regards, [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Mattb112885|talk]]) &lt;/small&gt; 15:21, 6 March 2007 (UTC)

Hi Paul James,

Just in case you hadn't noticed, I wanted to bring a comment I left at [[Talk:Cultural Anthropology#Welcomes and help]] to your attention. Happy editing! --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 23:08, 20 February 2009 (UTC)

== Editor and Approval of Revisions ==

Hello, I've replied to your question on Swift's talk page. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''Unusual? Quite''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 22:59, 11 March 2009 (UTC)


I am not happy with the gestures, haptics and sports section of the symbolism and communication, but i can't find the talk for the students who wrote the sections.  in general I feel that it gets off topic, and might be a little inappropriate, so I will edit it a little. [[User talk:Malina|'''Malina ''']]

== Re: Ticker ==

Hello Paul, The ticker was an attempt by me to get page hit data about wikibooks posted here on the wiki. I wrote a bot to scrape data from an external hit counter website and post the results on that wiki page. The hit counter website I was using has since gone offline and the source code to my bot has been lost to the sands of time. The best source for hitcount data is now located here: http://wikistics.falsikon.de/latest/wikibooks/en/. I have no plans to try and update the ticker using this new website, however. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 20:03, 29 September 2009 (UTC)

== Question ==
How final is the work [[Cultural Anthropology]], is it a class project that is still ongoing ?
I have taken notice of the section relating to [[Cultural Anthropology/Human Rights#Cultural_Imperialism]], and I strongly disagree with the view point expressed there (as expressed in my post at [[Talk:Cultural Anthropology/Human Rights]]).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 18:13, 25 July 2011 (UTC)

::Hi [[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] the book still needs significant editing and I have not had students work on it for about a year. I agree with your concern over the lack of clarity of the cultural imperialism paragraphs but at the same time I am not sure what you are proposing as an alternative. 

Cultural imperialism occurs when one, often more powerful, culture imposes itself on another culture. It is tied to theories of ethnocentrism, power and hegemony and is somewhat important in an introduction to cultural anthropology. If you want to learn more maybe check out the google books page for Tomlinson, J., 2001. Cultural imperialism: a critical introduction, Continuum International Publishing Group. p22 He puts together a compelling argument about cultural imperialism as it relates to Western media imperialism. To understand how it relates to globalization check out Kearney, M., 1995. The Local and the Global: The Anthropology of Globalization and Transnationalism. Annual Review of Anthropology, 24, pp.547-565. http://www.uam-antropologia.info/texto_kerney.pdf


Feel free to give a shot at improving any of the book just try and back it up with citations from recent anthropological literature.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Definition==
A conjunction is a word or words used to show the relationship between one notion and another notion. There are two main types of conjunction: the ''coordinative'' conjunction, which joins phrases of equal importance and rank, and the ''subordinative'' conjunction, which joins a phrase with another phrase that is dependant on it.

==Coordinative Conjunctions==
A coordinative conjunction joins two sentences together that do not rely on each other for meaning. 
We can split the co-ordinative conjunctions into four smaller groups: the cumulative, the alternative, the adversative, and the illative.

===Cumulative===
A ''cumulative'' conjunction is used to add one thought to another. Examples of cumulative conjunctions include
*and
*both...and
*not only
*but also
*as well as                       takes singular verb

===Alternative===
Used to indicate a choice between one notion and another. For example:
*or
*either...or
*else
*otherwise
*neither...nor

===Adversative===
Used to contrast one notion and another.
*but
*yet
*however
*nonetheless
*despite
*still

===Illative===
These show that one notion is implied, inferred or proved by another.
*then
*thus
*therefore
*so
*for
==Subordinating conjunctions==
Subordinating conjunctions express relationships of time, manner, cause or reason, comparison, condition, or purpose. They are used to introduce subordinate clauses that are not complete

==Conjunctive adverbs==

''Vous retrouverez le texte entier des ''Rêveries du promeneur solitaire'' sur Wikisource''

Me voici donc seul sur la terre, n'ayant plus de frère, de prochain, d'ami, de société que moi-même Le plus sociable et le plus aimant des humains en a été proscrit. Par un accord unanime ils ont cherché dans les raffinements de leur haine quel tourment pouvait être le plus cruel à mon âme sensible, et ils ont brisé violemment tous les liens qui m'attachaient à eux. J'aurais aimé les hommes en dépit d'eux-mêmes. Ils n'ont pu qu'en cessant de l'être se dérober à mon affection. Les voilà donc étrangers, inconnus, nuls enfin pour moi puisqu'ils l'ont voulu. Mais moi, détaché d'eux et de tout, que suis-je moi-même ? Voilà ce qui me reste à chercher. Malheureusement cette recherche doit être précédée d'un coup d'œil sur ma position. C'est une idée par laquelle il faut nécessairement que je passe pour arriver d'eux à moi.

      <comment>[[WP:AWB/T|Typo fixing]], typos fixed: extentions → extensions using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">* A new entry in the context menu that appears after right-clicking on a file in the File Navigator: Open. Obviously, the Open function should open the selected file. (I know this is essentially the same as simply double-clicking the file, but I thought adding this entry to the context menu may improve GUI logic) (Rob Laumen)
* A new entry in the context menu that appears after right-clicking on a file in the File Navigator: Export to External View. (Rob Laumen)
* A new entry in the context menu that appears after right-clicking on a file in the File Navigator: Import from External View. (Rob Laumen)
* Intelligent drag and drop in target cells - by which is meant that the function should ignore codes as well. (Paul Cowan)
* Being able to create new projects without using the mouse (i.e. ensuring that all commands have accelerator keys) (Lorenzo Martinelli)
* Highlighting of (source/target) filter string after performing a Filter On Selection operation. (Rob Laumen)
* DownArrow alone in grid editing mode should never go to next row. (Gudmund Areskoug)
* More predictable results when moving cursor around in rows. i.e., in a multi-line row, when the cursor is after the  space at the end of the line before last, when pressing Down arrow, the cursor should jump to the last line in the same row, and not to the next row. Similarly, when the cursor is after the space at the end of the first line in a multi-line row, when pressing Up arrow, the cursor should jump to the previous row, and not get stuck as it is now. (Alessandra Muzzi)
* Retain original locked vertical scrolling position when returning/unfiltering after filter on selection. (Gudmund Areskoug)
* Give the status and indications column of the translation grid a pop-up menu of its own, and move corresponding menu entries there from the other grid popups, e. g. status indication, comments etc. (Gudmund Areskoug)
* If cursor is in the source cell when term pair is sent to TDB, return cursor to the target cell. (Hans Leander)
* In a project, an option to set a &quot;fake&quot; bottom of the window at any row in the actual window, so that one would always be able to see a number of rows below the one in which one is working. (Hans Leander)
* GUI: Smart selecting with mouse (dragging over words) (??)
* GUI: Smart cut and paste (adding and removing spaces and managing punctuation) - by which is meant that the function should ignore codes as well. (Paul Cowan)
* GUI: Delete from cursor position to end of segment (with code-handling) (??)
* GUI: Place the cursor in the target box (split edit area) after ctrl+a, ctrl+down, alt+down, F5, Join and Split, shift+f11. (??)
* GUI: Allow single tab to go from target box to source box (split edit area) and back (??)
* &quot;Rearrange Windows&quot; function offering several layout options, similar to the function offered by DV3 (Herbert Eppel)
* F2 to edit segments in alignment and project windows. (Johan Kok)
* GUI: Having the options &quot;Close all open files&quot; and &quot;Close all open files except this&quot; when you right-click on the name of an individual file or the project file in the grey bar underneath the working grid. (Dave Turner / Rob Laumen)
* Project: In the project &quot;File Navigator window&quot; select which files to open using Ctrl and Shft. (Johan Kok)
* Keyboard shorcut for sending term pairs straight to TDB without context and promptings, but including client, subject and perhaps project info. (Gudmund Areskoug)
* Alignment project: Alignment project is not one of &quot;All Déjà vu X files&quot; file extensions when selecting File Open. (Johan Kok)
* An indication in the Autosearch Sentences window (possibly background colour) of source text i.e. so that it is immediately clear which of the two elements in the 'sentence found' pair is the source and which is the target.  This would be nice too in &quot;Portions found, but less crucial imho. (Jeroen Vanlaer - Sophronius).
* configurable colour- or other attribute settings for stuff from MDB, from TDB, from Lexicon, copied from source or, most important, for typed text. That way you can first edit the whole sentence for correct context, and then check if something must still be sent to a TDB/TM/Lexicon (Leo te Braake)
* A way to see the FileID of the files. Not in Access, but e.g. in File Navigator. A print of the files and their path would be the easiest to use AND to implement. Meant for reference in filtering on more than one file using SQL, when the file structure is complicated. (Leo te Braake)
* Wysiwyg for bold, underline and italics (like MemoQ!). (Dave Turner)
* Highlight the portions in the grid (grey background?) corresponding to the portions in AutoSearch used for (Auto)Assemble. (Dave Turner)
* Display such terms as a tool-tip (whole term and its component words to reflect mouse pointer position). (Dave Turner)
* Insertion of tool-tip terms in target by a double click. (Dave Turner)
* Reduce AutoSearch clutter by not displaying terms duplicated in the TDB, MDB and/or lexicon and not displaying fuzzy portions when exact portion found. (Dave Turner)
* Option to open the exported file (Walter Weyne)
* Provide a command to jump to the next row meeting a specified condition. E.g. You want to step through all rows with comments in a project, but still be able to see neighboring rows, so you don't want to use the row selector, but rather jump from one row to the next like you do with bookmarks. Ideally, there should be a new command under Edit, i.e. Go to..., and then the same selection of rows as in the row selector (SQL included). Once you select a type of row there, you are then able to jump to that type of row by using a single keyboard shortcut (always the same shortcut for any row type selected). (Alessandra Muzzi)
* After clicking on a AutoSearch portion to insert a term or phrase, the cursor should return to the target cell after the insertion, plus one space to resume typing directly or insert another term. At present it stays in the AutoSearch box. (Dave Turner)
* Insert a space automatically after a portion inserted in target using control+1, control+2, etc. to allow several terms to be inserted without having to press the space bar in between. (Dave Turner)
* Strip (filter out) leading and trailing white spaces from segments and provide a white space management option to insert single spaces between sentences if source double-spaced, and vice versa. (David Turner)

==Invitation of a Wikibook study ==
Hi Unnikrishnan Vijayan, 

I read your Wikijunior Bug book. I'm very impressed and interested to know more about your experience related to this particular book project (Wikijunior Bug) I'm current a doctoral student at Indiana University (US). My advisor and I, we are starting a Wikibook study regarding to online authors' beliefs and perceptions (motivation to write a Wikibook, beliefs about the knowledge of the topic, previous experience and success in writing a Wikibook, and ability to help coordinate the Wikibook project and interact with other authors).

We would love to invite you to participate in this study. If you agree to participate, please leave me a message or send me an email. (My email is cl17@indiana.edu.) We'll send 14 open-ended questions by email (email interview). Your input to this study will be greatly appreciated. Thank you so much again. Inkeys</text>

Very little content, no progress since October 2006. Generally, I think that this book is very vague, from the title to its goals: &quot;But I feel many who claim who are programmers, are not programmers. (...) This book is to train any person (including non programmers) to become programmers&quot;. I'm afraid the book was ment to be more a personal essay than a book based on sources and maintaining NPOV. As there is not much written in this book, deleting it won't be a big loss. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 16:56, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' - very little real content at all --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 17:06, 8 February 2007 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' - sounds like a book on programming written by a project manager. Oh, wait, it is! [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:06, 8 February 2007 (UTC)
*While I am not opposed to wikibooks written in a more personal style, I think that they require a more significant amount of dedication in order to finish them such that they can be useful. This book in its current state is not useful for two reason: There is little pertinent information that would aid a student of programming or anyone interested in programming; and a potential contributor may or may not share the same sentiments as the founder of the book, and thus would be forced to disregard the content or totally rewrite it. Thus I argue that the text should be '''deleted'''. --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 23:21, 8 February 2007 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' - I too am not opposed to Wikibooks being written in a personal tone.  However, when a personal style of writing is used the author should be careful as to not state any opinions as facts.  This particular Wikibook rides the line in that sense.  Apart from the style of writing though, this Wikibook does not contain much content what-so-ever. --[[User:Bhensley|BHensley]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Bhensley|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:32, [[February 14]], [[2007]]

Nice intentions, but I agree with Bhensley - the introductory paragraph feels like I'm listening to someone unfurl a yarn of a story by a fireside: &quot;now there are programmers, but a lot of them ain't really programmers, and I tell you most people wouldn't know one if they saw one, a ''real'' programmer worth his salt has...&quot; But seriously, for a minute: a heavily convivial or opinionated tone alone isn't on its own justification for deletion,   but that combined with lack of content, direction, the gigantic scope of the book, and the pre-existence of multiple books on programming, I don't see what purpose this is serving. --[[User:Monk|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Monk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:Monk|talk]]&lt;/sub&gt; 04:13, 18 February 2007 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Operating systems ==

=== Does MemoQ run on Vista? ===

Yes, MemoQ 2.0 and later is a .NET based application and will run just fine
under any Windows version provided that the .NET Framework 2.0 is installed.

=== Does MemoQ run on MacOS X? ===

Yes, you can safely run MemoQ (all versions) using the Parallels Desktop for Mac
on all new Intel-based Macs. Note that you can also run it on a virtual machine
(using VMWare, Virtual PC, Xen or any other virtualization solution) under almost
any OS, as the activation feature doesn't require any dongle.

=== Does MemoQ run on GNU/Linux? ===

Not directly, but you can run it in a virtual machine.

=== I get an &quot;access denied&quot; message on Vista Home, what do I need to do? ===

While MemoQ works fine with all versions of Windows Vista, there is a known installer issue under '''Vista Home'''. If you receive an &quot;access denied&quot; type of error message when registering or creating a translation memory or a term base, follow the steps below.

First, make hidden and protected files visible:

# Log on to Windows as an administrator.
# Open Control Panel.
# Switch to Classic view (click the link at the top left).
# Double-click the Folder Options icon, then, on the Folder Options dialog box, click the View tab.
# Find and click (select) the &quot;Show hidden files and folders&quot; radio button. Do not click OK or Apply.
# Find and clear (unselect) the &quot;Hide protected operating system files&quot; check box. When Windows asks for confirmation, click Yes.
# Click OK.

Second, set appropriate permissions for the MemoQ folder under All Users:

# Click the Start button, then, in the Start menu, click Computer.
# Double-click Drive C.
# Double-click the Users, and then the All Users folder.
# Right-click the MemoQ folder, then choose Properties from the shortcut menu.
# In the MemoQ Properties dialog box, click the Security folder.
# Under the Group or user names list (towards the middle of the dialog box), click Edit.
# When Windows asks for confirmation, click Continue. (It does not ask on every configuration.)
# In the Permissions for MemoQ dialog box, on the Group or user names list, click the Users item.
# In the Permissions for Users list (at the bottom of the dialog box), under Allow, select the first check box (next to Full Control).
# Click Apply, then OK.
# In the MemoQ Properties dialog box, click OK.
# Close the folder window.

Now you can start MemoQ and check if the problem has been resolved.

== File formats ==

=== Is MemoQ capable of translating documents of format X? ===

Probably, if the file format is XML based. You need to create an XML format configuration for the file format, and use this configuration to import any document of the same type. This involves getting familiar with the basics of XML: elements, tags, attributes, etc.

=== MemoQ does not import my PowerPoint presentation ===

Most of the time, this happens when PowerPoint 2007 is installed. Actually, this problem is not file format related: the same PPT file would probably import if PowerPoint 2003 or 2000 was installed on the same machine instead of the 2007 version. The reason is that MemoQ needs to interoperate with PowerPoint when importing the document, and the methods of this interoperation have changed significantly with PowerPoint 2007. Since MemoQ 3.5, PowerPoint 2007 is supported through the XML based PPTX format. PPTX is directly supported by MemoQ, not requiring Microsoft Office to be installed. If your machine has PowerPoint 2007 installed, and you receive a PPT file for translation, you can save the file as PPTX in PowerPoint, or have MemoQ process it as PPTX after clicking &quot;Add document as&quot;.

=== If review mode is activated in a PPT file, MemoQ won't import it ===

* Open the file in PowerPoint
* Change anything in the file - to make the change invisible you should add a space somewhere
* Save the file in PowerPoint, and when the review dialog appears, click No
* Import the file in MemoQ

=== Does MemoQ handle the new Word 2007 docx format? ===

Full support isn't official yet, but you can safely rename your docx document
into .zip, as you will notice, the actual content is stored into XML files:
the DOCX format is very close to the now standard ODF (Open Document Format),
and MemoQ does support XML files.

=== I've been sent a TTX file (TagEditor), will I be able to translate it using MemoQ? ===

If you want to work with file formats supported by SDL Trados but not supported by MemoQ, you can do that through TagEditor's native format, TTX. However, to enable SDL Trados to export the file back to the original format you have to pre-segment the file and work on an already segmented TTX file.

To pre-segment the file you need to do the following:

* Open SDL Trados Translator's Workbench

* Create an empty translation memory by choosing ''File''/''New''. Click ''Create'', and give a name to the translation memory

* Click ''Tools''/''Translate''

* In the ''Translate Files'' dialog box, enable the ''Segment unknown sentences'' check box

* Add the files you want to segment by clicking ''Add...''

* Click ''Translate''

Now import the pre-segmented TTX files into MemoQ, and you can start working.

'''Note:''' MemoQ 2.1 and later have full TTX support, but there is a workaround method
to work on TTX files using MemoQ 2.0. For more info, see the [[CAT-Tools/MemoQ/Tips and Tricks#Working with TTX files using MemoQ 2.0 - alternate workflow|Working with TTX files using MemoQ 2.0 - alternate workflow]] in the Tips and Tricks chapter.

=== My Trados-compatible bilingual DOC/RTF document does not import ===

A likely cause is that the document contains footnotes, which are currently not supported by MemoQ for bilingual DOC/RTF. A possible workaround is to temporarily remove footnotes, footnote markers, and the surrounding subsegment markers (purple markers like {1&gt; and &lt;1} inside segments) from the document before importing to MemoQ. Make sure you remove these items from both the (hidden) source segments and the target segments. This way, footnotes can be translated separately, and restored at the original location after the translated document has been exported by MemoQ.

You can quickly find the footnotes by opening the document in Microsoft Word, starting a search, and typing ^f in the Find what box. This will take you to the next footnote mark. If you delete the mark on both sides, the footnote itself will be deleted as well.

Markus Henseler also created a Word macro that may help you get around this issue. The macro works by pre-processing documents to make them suitable for importing into MemoQ and restoring their original format after translation. The macro can be found in the Files section of the Yahoo! Groups mailing list for MemoQ:

http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/MemoQ/files/

=== External cross-references in MIF files do not work after export ===

When translation is complete, the cross-references to external files need to be updated in FrameMaker. Do the following:

*When you have exported your translated .MIF files, save all of them as .FM files in FrameMaker. Be sure to use the original filenames used when the FM files were created, because cross-references are based on the filenames, and FrameMaker will not find the referenced files if their filenames have been changed.
*Open all of these FM files in FrameMaker.
*After this, in the Edit menu, click ''Update references''. Check the ''All cross references'' checkbox. Click the ''Update'' button.

'''Note:'''
For this cross-reference update to work, the translated FM files have to be in the same positions (relative to each other) as before translation. E.g. if all of the files were in the ''c:\work\source'' directory originally, you can put them in the ''c:\work\translation'' directory. But if some of them originally resided in a sufolder, like the ''c:\work\source\other'' directory, put their translated versions in the ''c:\work\translation\other'' directory.

== Installation issues ==

=== I get an error installing MemoQ 2.0 over MemoQ 1.0 ===

The error is: ''Exception ocurred while initializing the installation: System.BadImage Format Exception: The Format of the File 'MemoQLiteSetup.CustomInstaller.dll' is invalid.”''

This is because of a conflict between the different versions of the .NET Framework. The procedure below is guaranteed to work:

# Uninstall MemoQ 1.0 manually (under Control Panel / Add/Remove Programs)
# Install the .NET Framework 2.0 (run '''dotnetfx.exe''' included in the ZIP file of the MemoQ 2.0 installer)
# Install MemoQ 2.0 (run setup.exe)

=== Can I use MemoQ on multiple computers? ===

Yes. See [[CAT-Tools/MemoQ/Activation#Using MemoQ on a different computer|Using MemoQ on a different computer]] in the Activation chapter.

=== How can I change my serial number if I typed the wrong one? ===

See [[CAT-Tools/MemoQ/Activation#Changing the serial number|Changing the serial number]] in the Activation chapter.

=== How can I manually remove MemoQ from my computer? ===

'''Note:''' This information applies to MemoQ version 2.3 and the Windows Vista operating system.

If the installation fails when you try upgrading or updating your copy of MemoQ, or uninstallation fails when you attempt to remove MemoQ from your computer, you can remove MemoQ manually by following the steps below:

'''Important:''' This procedure will not harm your data (projects, documents, translation memories, term bases or settings). Your activation data (licenses) will also remain intact.

# Log on to your computer as an administrator.
# Open the Start menu (click the Start button), then type C:\Program Files\Kilgray in the search box at the bottom of the menu, then press Enter. Windows will display the folder where the Kilgray applications are installed.  In this folder window, you should see a MemoQ folder icon.
# To delete the MemoQ folder, click the MemoQ folder icon, then press the Shift+Delete key shortcut. 
# In most cases, Windows Vista will display the User Account Control (UAC) dialog box. You need to confirm that you are indeed an administrator, and that you really want to remove the folder. You will need to click Yes, then Continue to delete the folder.
# Once the folder is deleted, you need to remove the MemoQ-related entries from the Windows registry (the database where all configuration data are stored). Click the Start button to open the Start menu, then, in the search box at the bottom, type ’regedit’, then press Enter. 
# Before starting the program, Windows displays the User Account Control dialog box again. Here, you need to click Continue to confirm that you want to start the program. Then the Registry Editor program will start.
# Press the Home key to move to the top of the list of registry keys.  Double-click the following key names to get to MemoQ’s configuration: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, SOFTWARE. When you click a key name, a new list of keys will appear below it. If a list of keys are already there, you do not need to double-click the key name.
# You should now see  a list of keys with the name ’Kilgray’ included. If you do not see the ’Kilgray’ name, scroll down to make it visible. Click the ’Kilgray’ key name, then press the Delete key to delete it.
# Then, you need to go to the following key (double-click each name as they appear): HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, SOFTWARE, Microsoft, Windows, CurrentVersion, Uninstall. Below the ’Uninstall’ key name, a list of numbers in curly brackets should appear.
# Press the Ctrl+F key shortcut to search for a word in the registry. The Find dialog box appears. In the Find what box, type ’MemoQ’. Make sure that the Keys, Values and the Data check boxes are all turned on.
# Click Find Next button to perform the search. When ready, the Registry Editor displays a list of data with ’DisplayName: MemoQ’ included. 
# Press the Tab key to highlight the name of the key where this list of data appeared. Press the Delete key to delete it.
# MemoQ is now removed from your computer. When you open Control Panel, and go to Programs and Features, it should no longer be listed. Now you should be able to install a new version or new copy of MemoQ.

=== I get error 2869 when I attempt installing MemoQ on Windows Vista ===

'''Note''': This information applies to MemoQ version 2.3 and Windows Vista (Home Editions)

# Log on to your computer as an administrator.
# Download the MemoQ installation package and save it to a folder of your choice. The default folder for downloading programs is Public Downloads (C:\Users\Public\Downloads). Further on, we will assume that you download the MemoQ installation package into this folder.
# Unzip the MemoQ installation package (right-click the icon of the zip file, then choose Extract all) using the default settings (click Next or Finish in every wizard page).
# Click the Start button, then All Programs, then Accessories. Under Accessories, find the Command Prompt item. Right-click Command Prompt, then choose Run as administrator from the pop-up menu.
# The User Account Control dialog box appears. Click Continue to open the command prompt.
# In the command prompt window, type '''cd \Users\Public\Downloads\MemoQSetup.2.3.'''''nn'' where ''nn'' is the last number of the version number of MemoQ; then press Enter. If you have downloaded the setup package as MemoQSetup.2.3.zip, you do not have to type this number.
# Again, in the command prompt window, type '''msiexec /i &quot;MemoQSetup.msi&quot;''', then press Enter. The MemoQ setup program starts. Use the wizard to install MemoQ with the normal procedure.
# The installation might still fail with Error 2869. In that case, type '''msiexec /a &quot;MemoQSetup.msi&quot;''', then press Enter. The MemoQ Setup program starts again, and performs a normal installation, reporting that a network package has been created.
# MemoQ is installed now, but the necessary permissions are not set on the computer. Follow the procedure under [[CAT-Tools/MemoQ/FAQ#I get an &quot;access denied&quot; message on Vista Home, what do I need to do?|I get an &quot;access denied&quot; message on Vista Home, what do I need to do?]] to set these permissions.

'''IMPORTANT''': This information does not apply to version 3.0 and up because these versions have a new setup program that solves the above problems.

=== When re-starting the computer, the MemoQ Server does not start ===

Sometimes you get an error message when restarting the computer that hosts a MemoQ Server. The cause of the problem is that SQL Server takes more time to start up than the MemoQ Server, and the MemoQ Server does not wait for it – instead, it reports an error and stops.
 
It is an annoyance to have to start MemoQ Server manually every time, so here is a workaround:
 
# Start the Services console: the easiest way is to go to Start -&gt; Run, then type &quot;services.msc&quot;, then press Enter. In Vista, you simply open the Start menu, and type &quot;services.msc&quot; in the search bar at the bottom.
# The Services console appears. In the list, find the service called &quot;MemoQ server service&quot;. Right-click the service name, then choose Properties. (BTW if you left-click the service name, and then click the Play button at the top of the window (in the toolbar), that will start the service right away.)
# In the MemoQ Server service Properties dialog box, click the Recovery tab (the third from the left).  Then, set the First failure, Second failure, and Subsequent failures drop-down lists to Restart the Service. Then click OK.

== Compatibility with other software ==

=== Interoperability ===
Kilgray is committed to open standards and interoperability.  MemoQ does not entail the use of any proprietary files specific to the tool, and memoQ can work with many file formats standard to the translation industry and common office software tools.  With memoQ, it does not matter what translation environments or CAT software clients or collaborators use, one can exchange databases and files, take jobs to be treated or delivered in another tool, and share work with translators using other tools.

=== Microsoft Office 2007 and Office versions below 2000 ===

To understand some of the potential issues with Office 2007, one must understand how MemoQ interoperates with Office. When working with Office formats (importing documents) or using the Office spell-checker, MemoQ delegates some tasks to the Office applications. When an Office document is imported into MemoQ, MemoQ launches a hidden instance of Word, PowerPoint or Excel to support the import process. Similarly, using the Office spell-checker inside MemoQ launches a hidden instance of Word. Because of this, the version of Office installed on the MemoQ user's computer is just as important as the version of the Office document. The section below describes compatibility with versions of Office installed on the user's computer (as opposed to the version of the Office document to be imported).

Versions of Office earlier than Office 2000 SR2 are not supported. Office 2007 is partially supported: there are some compatibility issues with Word 2007 (see below). PowerPoint 2007 is not supported. There are no known issues with Excel 2007.

==== Description ====
With Word 2007, a new template format was introduced. The new template type is called a macro-enabled template and has the .dotm file extension. Some applications like SDL Trados install macro-enabled templates into the Office Startup directory, causing the templates to load every time Word is launched. The issue with these new templates is that when a second instance of Word is started, the templates cause file access problems. Normally, this only means that a dialog is displayed to the user, who needs to accept that Word will open the template as read-only. However, if the Word instance runs hidden (as in the case when a Word document is imported into MemoQ or the office spell-cheker is used in MemoQ), this dialog can remain hidden as well, preventing MemoQ from finishing. Recent versions of MemoQ (3.0.31 or later) deal with this by making the hidden Word window temporarily visible. This way, the user can let the import process finish by switching to the Word window and accepting that the template will be opened as read-only.  On the other hand, this may not always work correctly for spell-checking: MemoQ currently might have issues starting Office 2007 for spell-checking if an active macro-enabled template is in the Startup folder of Word (that is, automatically started with Word). This does not affect the new alternate spell-checker of MemoQ 3.0: the new Hunspell spell-checker works independent of Office. If you are having problems with the Office spell-checker, switching to the alternate spell-checker is recommended. See the MemoQ help for more information.

==== Resolution ====
A possible workaround for any such template-related problem or annoyance is to delete the templates from the Word Startup folder, and load them only when they are actually needed. By default, the Startup folder resides at one of the following locations:

Windows Vista :
      c:\Users\[your username]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Word\STARTUP

Microsoft Windows Server 2003 or Microsoft Windows XP:
      c:\Documents and Settings\[your username]\Application Data\Microsoft\Word\STARTUP

If the location of the Startup folder has changed, you can find it by doing the following:

# Click the Microsoft Office Button, and then click Word Options.
# Click Advanced.
# Under General, click File Locations. The path to the Startup folder is displayed in the list. (If the path is too long and thus only partially displayed, select the Startup item and click Modify. In the dialog that appears, the Startup folder will be highlighted in the Folders list. Right-click the folder, and click Properties. The full path will be displayed. Note the path and Click Cancel to exit the dialog.)

To stop the templates from automatically loading with Word, locate the template files (files with .dotm extension) inside the Startup folder, and move them to another folder. After this, MemoQ should have no problems interoperating with Word 2007. If you need the templates to automatically load again, move them back into the Startup folder.

To load the templates manually when you need them, do the following:

# In Word, click the Office button.
# Click the Word Options button.
# Choose the Add-Ins category.
# In the Manage list at the bottom of the window, choose Word add-ins. Click the Go button.
# If the template you need is not on the list of loaded items, click the Add button. Locate the template file and click OK (or in Vista, Open). Now your template is loaded and ready to use. Click OK.

=== Virtual desktop software ===

When using virtual desktop software like VirtuaWin, desktop switching can cause dialogs of MemoQ to close without warning. Fortunately, there is a workaround for recent versions of VirtuaWin.

# Open the file tricky.cfg contained in the VirtuaWin settings folder: [user profile]\Application Data\VirtuaWin.
# Add this line: cr:WindowsForms10.*
# Restart VirtuaWin.

This will cause VirtuaWin to handle MemoQ dialogs differently, avoiding the problem of abruptly closed dialogs. It is not yet known whether similar fixes are possible for other virtual desktop managers like Microsoft Virtual Desktop Manager.

== Miscellaneous ==

=== Can I spell-check my translations in MemoQ? ===

Yes. MemoQ uses the spell checker of Microsoft Office for this in the background. If you are using a language version of Microsoft Office 2000 that does not provide built-in support for the language you are translating into, you can simply copy the required files and Office will support that language as well. However, this is not enough when you try to use MemoQ spell checking. Because Microsoft Office does not automatically install some elements, you need the original installation CD to proceed.

This is not an issue with Microsoft Office 2003 or newer.

=== Central/Eastern European characters get corrupted ===

Some users have experienced the following issue. When they confirm a translated segment, some of the Central/Eastern European diacritical characters get corrupt. For example in Czech &quot;ř&quot; changes to &quot;ø&quot;, &quot;č&quot; changes to &quot;è&quot;. This happens on computers that ever had an early version of Trados installed (any version before 6.5). Uninstalling or updating Trados does not solve the problem. Trados used to have a problem with displaying special characters of Central/Eastern European languages. For a long time, Trados did not issue a fix for this problem, but advised their users to work around it by changing a setting in the registry. This made the problem go away in Trados, but it is still causing problems in other applications like MemoQ. The solution is to change this registry setting back to the original value.

1. From the Start menu, select Run.

2. Type in &quot;regedit&quot; (as shown, without the quotes). The Registry Editor opens.

3. Locate the following key:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Nls\CodePage

4. In this key, highlight the string 1252 (on the right-hand side in the registry editor).

5. Right-click on the string, and select Modify.

6. In the Edit String dialog, check Value Data. If it is set to anything other than c_1252.nls, change it to c_1252.nls. This is the original Windows setting before the Trados workaround.

7. Click OK to accept the change, and exit the Registry Editor.

8. Restart the system.

=== Can I make spaces and other special characters visible? ===

Yes, this is possible by using a special font for editing your translations in MemoQ. For details, see [[CAT-Tools/MemoQ/Tips and Tricks#Showing spaces and other special characters|Showing spaces and other special characters]] in the Tips and Tricks chapter.

=== Can I reorder or omit tags (codes) in my translation? ===

No, that is not possible. The way {tags} work in MemoQ is, they stand for something that constitutes the structure of the original document (the &quot;skeleton&quot;). Without that skeleton, there is simply no way MemoQ can restore a correct document at export. Not copying tags and allowing export would simply result in a file with DOC extension (for Word DOC's) that can do one thing: crash Word when you open them...

However, Word documents will sometimes show tags that clearly do not stand for anything sensible (especially if the DOC was created from a PDF file). Such tags are also called ''rogue codes''. For some ideas on how to get rid of them, see [[CAT-Tools/MemoQ/Tips and Tricks#Getting rid of codes in Word documents|Getting rid of codes in Word documents]] in the Tips and Tricks chapter.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Things to look for in John 8'''
* The textual issue of whether the first 11 verses are original and what connection there is between them and the rest of the narrative.
* The meaning of &quot;I am&quot; on the lips of Jesus, and how (if it represents the divine name) this fits with the emphasis on obedience throughout John in General and in this chapter in particular.


==The Woman Caught in Adultery (John 7:59-8:11)==

The '''Pericope de Adultera''' (or Pericope Adulterae) means &quot;the story of the adulteress&quot;.   It is the name given to versus 7:53- 8:11 of the Gospel of John in scholarly literature.  

It is the story of woman who was either married or was with a married man  and the angry mob wanting to stone her in the name of Moses. Jesus tells them that the one without sin may cast the first stone, and since nobody throws a stone, Jesus does not judge her either at this time, but tells her to leave her life of sin. Many people attribute this scene to Mary Magdalene, but there is no  evidence to this belief. 

The forgiveness of an adulteress is not the kind of thing you would expect the early church to create.  The debate about forgiveness was a major one in the 2nd and 3rd CE.[citation needed] 

Its purpose was to provide a portrait of Jesus' words in John 8:15, “You judge according to the flesh, but I judge no one”.  

This narrative is a reminder that no individual is without sin. We aren’t capable of passing judgment on an individual only God is capable of passing judgment. Jesus ends capital punishment with this story. Each one of us needs the forgiveness of God and we need to forgive the sinner.  Forgiveness, not executions, is God's expectation from us.

Jesus was presented with a question designed to trap him -- the Jewish leaders brought to Jesus a woman who had been caught in adultery.  They reminded Jesus, that according to the Law a woman should be stoned to death (see Leviticus 20:10; conveniently, the leaders seem to have forgotten that the Law called for the same penalty for the male partner in the adulterous relationship, but interestingly the Pharisees bring only the woman and not the man, which means the man set the woman up to be caught and brought to Jesus.) 

This caused a dilemma:  If Jesus deferred to the Romans, He discredited Himself as a Teacher of the Law.  If he said, &quot;no&quot; he would be going against Mosaic code; if he said, &quot;yes&quot;, he condoned the stoning and the Romans would consider him a rioter and arrest him.  Either way, they thought, Jesus couldn't win. 

Jesus brought to their attention a third option.  This option invited his opponents to comply with the ancient codes, but in order for them to do so they themselves had to be without sin and guilt.  

Jesus shows in this instance that he knows and understands what he is going up against with the Jewish leaders of his time.  When they present Jesus with what they believe is an unwinnable situation for Jesus, he responds to their trap with a wise answer that they did not expect or know how to respond to.  By answering their challenge in this way Jesus showed those with him that he had a knowledge and understanding much greater than they could have imagined.

When approached about the interaction with the woman, Jesus confronts the Jewish authorities on their questioning.

==Textual Evidence for 7:53-8:11==

The first story in this chapter is not found in the two earliest surviving Egyptian papyri (P66 and P75).  It is also absent from the two famous 4th century bibles prepared for Ecclesiastical use (apparently by Eusebius for Emperor Constantine), Codex Vaticanus and Sinaiticus.

Most 'modern' translations (produced in the 1960s to 1980s) include the passage but enclose it in brackets, with a note to the effect that it is &quot;not found in the oldest and best manuscripts&quot;, or a similar statement.

However, this statement is extremely misleading on its own, since the passage was known to exist in some manuscripts of John long before Codex Vaticanus and Sinaiticus were made (St. Jerome, circa 382 A.D. tells us that he found the passage &quot;in many copies, both Greek and Latin&quot;, which shows it was popular long before his time.)

Secondly, although the four oldest manuscripts omit the passage, none of them does so without acknowledging their existence by a set of critical marks in their texts. 
(see [http://adultera.awardspace.com/TEXT/MSS-top10.html]The Top Ten Early MSS for John )


'''Smith''' even mentions in his commentary on John that &quot;there is no question it was not a part of the original Gospel.  In fact, a few manuscripts place it elsewhere, for example, at the end of the Gospel, or after Luke 21:38&quot; (179).

In one 'ancient' manuscript (12th cent. A.D.) the story even appears in Luke, just after Luke 21:38. This placement does seem more natural and fitting for the story than it's placement in John.

However,this Lukan placement only exists in about a half dozen late manuscripts (Family 13 circa 12th century). It is unlikely that Luke's Gospel was its original place. The story's inclusion in Luke merely reveals that this story has been battled over for centuries.



What should we conclude about John 7:59 – 8:11?  Some feel it was not originally a part of this gospel.

==Internal Evidence for 7:53-8:11==

Although, it does not imply that these verses are fraudulent, these verses interrupt the flow of the Feast of Tabernacles dialogs from v7:52 to 8:12. 

However, many scholars (e.g. Bultmann,J.P. Heil, A.W. Wilson, A. Pink) take the opposite view, and find that omitting the verses creates a difficult seam that cannot be original. 

Most likely, this was a well circulated story among the first century Christians which was told orally.[citation needed]  

Most of the early Christians would not have been able to read Greek or even Aramaic, so everything they knew about Jesus was due to oral tradition. [citation needed]

This story was probably very popular, but it had no home in any of the canonical gospels; this is why later on the scribes decided to begin including it here in John's Gospel. [evidence needed]

Even the language of the story, some scholars have suggested, is closer to that of Luke, but no new work in this area has been done since the early 1900s.  For instance, Cadbury(1917)was the last scholar to attempt to assemble a case for Lukan authorship.  The current consensus is that there is more evidence generally for later scribes 'standardizing' the text to a general Greek style than there is for the passage being composed by Luke.

&quot;The obviously later insertion of this pericope [in John] makes a certain sense, however, for it provides an episode, an encounter of Jesus with a sinful woman and Jewish authorities, which can be viewed as a springboard for the ensuing discussion,&quot; (Smith 179).

== John 8:12-59 ==
Jesus, still in the temple area, begins to testify about himself and the one who sent him.  Throughout the rest of the chapter Jesus will use the phrase &quot;I am he. He tells the Jews I am he (the Messiah) He tells the Jews in the temple that they are the sons of Satan and they will die in their sins if they don't receive him as the Messiah. They claim that Abraham is their father and Jesus says he rejoice to see the day of Jesus. He is referring to Abraham seeing him prophetically in the future. The Jews misunderstand him and think he is saying he saw Abraham. What he says is I was already in God plan and chosen to be the Messiah before Abraham was born. To be consistent the translators should have translated  the line &quot;Before Abraham was I am he&quot;. By leaving of the word &quot;he&quot; meaning the  Messiah, they give the impression that Jesus is saying &quot;I am.&quot;(John 8:58) 

In the 4th Century Jerome mistranslated the conversation between God and Moses where Abraham asks for God's name and he says EHYEH ASHER EHYEH (I will be what I will be Yah is my name. Jerome translated it SUM QUI SUM I am what I am. 

Down through the ages commentators have thought God's name was &quot;I AM&quot; and that Jesus was claiming to be God. It is all based on a bad translation.  When Jesus said before Abraham was I am he the  temple crowd picked-up stones to execute him but Jesus escaped.  They were furious for being called sons of the devil and they thought he was now worthy of death for claiming to have seen Abraham and claiming to thousands of years old. Naturally they wanted to kill him for being a false prophet.

An interesting point to consider is Jesus' statement in verse 15b: &quot;I judge no one.&quot; This seems like a contradiction to not only later verses in this chapter (such as verse 26), but also in 5:22, where Jesus tells us that the Father gives all judgment to the Son. Later he explains that the words he speaks will judge everyone. That's why you must learn his words and obey them in a loving manner.

Throughout John, there has been quite an emphasis on obedience.  After Jesus says &quot;I am he&quot; in verse 28 he says &quot;I do nothing on my own, but I speak these things as the Father has instructed me.&quot;  If we take &quot;I am&quot; to mean &quot;I am God,&quot; then it wouldn't make sense for the full verse to read, &quot;I am God and do as I'm told.&quot; 

Some believe that this phrase would simply mean &quot;I am, right now, and forever will be, better than Abraham.&quot; Then the word &quot;before&quot; just simply refers to Abraham's lack of importance when compared to Jesus. The Jews thought there was no greater father than Abraham so this is why they become hostile with misunderstanding in verse 59 with intentions to stone Jesus then.  In addition to this Jesus was the promised descendant of Abraham. With that said, God's promise to Abraham would not be fulfilled if Jesus existed before him. (Gen.17:17) So in conclusion, some believed that Jesus was not physically present in the time of Abraham, but that God did plan Jesus before the creation of the world and was now made flesh. (John 1:13)



'''I Am the Light of the World'''
We all know that when Jesus refers to himself being the &quot;Light of the World&quot; he is saying that he is the savior.  If people turn to him they will come out of the dark and walk in the light.  &quot;Thus the typical Johannine dualism is invoked&quot;(Smith, 180).  Also, this idea of light works well with the Festival of Hanukkah because it was a winter solstice festival and celebrated the light in the temple that burned for 8 days when the oil was gone.(180). 

'''The Mystery of &quot;The Jews&quot; in John Chapter 8'''   The phrase “the Jews” appears many times in the Johannine text, something that distinguishes the Gospel of John from the synoptic gospels. It should be noted that many Jews believed in Jesus and became disciples so it is best to translated , or paraphrase it as certain rogues among the Jews.

== Previously strong verbs that are now irregular ==

Added (in brackets) the older forms of verbs that used to be strong, because I believe that helps in understanding why today's forms look the way they do, and why some irregular verbs have the ''-it'' suffix that is usually the sign of a strong verb.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Summary of Chapter 7 ==

Setting: As with many Johanine passages, the chapter begins with a vague transition, &quot;after this&quot;.  The chapter is set at the Hanukkah Festival (The Maccabeans had moved the festival of Booths or Tabernacles to December in violation of the Torah).   &quot;Only John mentions a visit by Jesus to Jerusalem at a time other than Passover,&quot; (Smith 166).  

In this chapter, Jesus goes up to the temple at the feast of tabernacles and begins to teach those assembled. Many are astonished with the way in which Jesus can teach even though he has never had formal temple education. Jesus gives the credit to God the father. He then addresses the crowd and asks them why so many people are trying to kill him when not one of them is without sin. The crowd believes he is demon possessed, and Jesus answer back that he is not and that miracles come from the father working through him via the indwelling angel/logos. He tells them the reason they reject him is that the Father's logos has found no place in their hearts.  He also talks about the Sabbath and basically tells the crowd that if they are willing to make exceptions on the Sabbath for work (such as circumcision) that he should be able to use his own judgment in such situations (such as healing the man at the pool). Jesus’ straight forward logic doesn’t sit very well with everyone in attendance. 

There are some accusations by the Jews when Jesus begins teaching, as Jesus has never been formally educated himself. This puts Jesus' social status in question; however, many people address him as &quot;Rabbi,&quot; so at least those people believe he knows what he is talking about, regardless of whether or not he has studied under a Rabbi. Jesus tells the crowd that his teaching is not his own, but rather comes from the one who sent him.  He further says that those who work for God are working in truth and not for themselves, and this is a good thing.  This is the right way to do things.  There is honor in this.  As the people are trying to figure out if he is the real Messiah or not, many are putting their faith into him, and believing.  Jesus then talks about the fact that he will soon go somewhere that they will not be able to find him, and where he will go, they cannot come.  Obviously he is referencing Heaven at this point.  Days later in the festival he makes a call for people to come to him, if they are thirsting, that is thirsting for eternal life.  For if they believe, they will receive and their thirst will be quenched.  After hearing this, the temple guards go back to the main authorities to discuss him, and at this time it is Nicodemus who sticks up for Jesus and his teachings.  In the end, nothing is done and everyone goes their separate ways.

The first thirteen verses of chapter 7 describe the discussion about and the action of Jesus' return to Jerusalem.  The Feast of Hanukkah occurs during this journey to Jerusalem.    One argument was the issue of healing the man at the pool.  Jesus defends his healing of the man as part of the will of God. His argument is an outstanding example of the Jewish way of arguing from a lesser concern to a greater concern.  The Jews circumcise a baby boy on the Sabbath to fulfill the will of God. If the Sabbath can be broken to cut away such a small part of an individual, how much greater it would be to heal a whole individual!  This act would be an even greater example of fulfilling the will of God even if it is done on the Sabbath.

7:15 Questioning Jesus' Education: How does he know letters...?  The people listened to Jesus' teaching and were amazed.  His mastery of Scriptures were undeniable and the people wondered how he could teach like a rabbi, yet he had been trained by none of the great rabbis.

7:16-19 Jesus answers the questioning: Jesus tells those who are questioning his teaching and his education he is not teaching his own ideas.  Jesus tells the people and the religious leaders he is teaching the ideas of God who sent Jesus to them.  Jesus then explains how the people will know his teachings are from God.  He also instructs on how one's intentions can honor God along with the actions.

== Questions to Consider == 
'''Why the Pharisees in Verse 32?'''  John 7: 32 states, &quot;The Pharisees heard the crowd muttering such things about him, and the chief priests and Pharisees sent temple police to arrest him.&quot;  This is very interesting considering at the time these events were actually happening (during Jesus' life), the Pharisees wouldn't have had much, if any, authority in the Temple.  Prior to the destruction of the Jewish Temple (which occurred in 70) by the Romans, the Pharisees definitely had opinions about how things should be done and how Jewish law should be interpreted, but weren't really acknowledged.  Therefore, when considering the motives of the author of John to say it was the Pharisees that sent the temple police to arrest Jesus, two things must be considered: 1) Did the author have any historical context?  If he didn't, then he was logically going off of the only thing he knew about, his time's issues.  Maybe he thought it would have been the Pharisees to send the temple police to arrest Jesus.  OR 2) Was the author of John simply retelling the story with his &quot;modern&quot; twist?  A lot of times, depictions of historical events reflect concerns of the time in which the story is being told as opposed to the time in which they are meant to represent.  If so, maybe the author of John was using his creative license to make the story more understandable for people who would read it in the time he was writing it.

At multiple points in Chapter 7 (verse 13, verse 44) the citizens of Galilee are caught divided where Jesus is concerned.  Since Christ was in poor standing with the Jewish ruling council, average citizens were afraid to talk about Him for fear of conflict with the authorities.  In verse 44, we see that some of the people wanted to apprehend Christ, but no one made a move.  Several questions can be drawn from this.  First, were the people divided because some of them thought that Christ was the Messiah and some did not?  Second, why did none of them attempt to apprehend Him?  They were aware that they probably would have had the support of the authorities had they attempted to do so, so the fact that they didn’t speaks more for the mystery of Christ’s person.  Things should have happened one way, but they didn’t!

How does His time have any effect on the attempts of men to seize him?  Verse 30 points out the attempt on Jesus being seized.  However, does this mean a physical seizure?  If so, Jesus must have done something to escape.  Yet the text has no mention of how he escaped - just that &quot;His time had not yet come.&quot;  Perhaps the &quot;attempt&quot; to seize Jesus was more of a plot.  But the plan didn't quite work at that point, because God prevented such a thing from happening, because &quot;His time had not yet come.&quot;

Another division in the crowd occurs at this point: Where some attempt so seize Him, others &quot;put their faith in Him&quot; (31).  However, these believers only believed in the signs of Jesus, rather than for non-tangible reasons.  In other words, the faith in question here is faith strictly based on sight, rather than whole-hearted faith (faith that would not require such sights and miracles).

The crowd is divided on Jesus throughout the text of Chapter 7.  On the last day of the feast Jesus told the people about living water and how they could have living water.  Some people believed and others did not and said a prophet could not come from Galilee.  Also, the religious leaders believed that Jesus was not the Messiah because he came from Galilee and they believed a prophet could not come from Galilee.

==Were Jesus' brothers also disciples?==

It is pretty clear, not only from the early passages of Chapter 7, but also from the synoptic gospels that the brothers of Jesus were not in fact his disciples.  In Mark 3:21, &quot;When his family heard it, they went out to restrain him, for people were saying, 'He has gone out of his mind.'&quot;  and again in Mark 6:4, &quot;Prophets are not without honor, except in their hometown, and among their own kin.&quot;  This idea is paralleled, as previously mentioned, in Chapter 7:5, &quot;For not even his brothers believed in him.&quot;  The brothers were &quot;going up to Jerusalem to celebrate Hanukkah. To go up meant to dress in festive clothing play musical instrument and sing and dance. They mocked Jesus for refusing to &quot;Go up.&quot; He refused to go up because it was a military celebration created by the wicked Maccabeans who usurped the priesthood and the throne.

==No Prophet arises out of Galilee?==

In verses 41-52 there is a division amongst the people here because in Psalm 89:4 and Micah 5:2 these verses say that Christ would come from Bethlehem where David lives. (v.42)Because these scriptures were law, there were many who wanted to seize Him, however because of the way He spoke (and because it was not yet His hour John 7:30 Matthew 21:46) no one would touch Him. However, some believe that these men were wrong. There was a prophet that came out of Galilee and he was Jonah. Here are some characteristics that are similar to the likeness of Jonah and Jesus. First, both of these men had a larger goal, for example, Jonah wanted to save the rest of the sailors and Jesus came to save the world. Next, both had the symbolic three days and three nights in common (Matt. 12:38-41) as well as converting Gentiles. However, the most significant of their similarities is that they were both from Galilee. (2 Kings 14:25)

Actually, Jonah, Elijah, Nahum and Hosea were from the Galil. These men were all highly esteemed in Yahshuah’s day and they all had ministries to gentiles as well as the Jews.

The three other prophets from the Galilee:

Elijah, the Tishbite, (El is Yah) was rejected by Israel and was sent by Yah to Phoenicia (that’s where we get our Alphabet) where he dwelled in the house of a gentile widow in the town of Zarephatho. Later, when he was hiding in a cave on Mount Sinai in the Horeb mountains, it says the logos of Elohim (the word of God) the Logos spoke to him. The logos Elohim is identified as the Angel of Yah and speaks for Yah. (1 Kings 19). Traditionally it is believed Elijah went bodily to heaven in a fiery chariot, but since Yahshuah said no one, but he, had ever been to heaven we must assume that Elijah’s fiery ride ended in death before he left the planet.

Nahum, the Elkoshite, lived in Capernaum (Kefer Nahum) in 615 BC his book also is a message to the gentiles in Nineveh. 
Hosea (a nickname for Jesus), the son of Beeri,  lived  in the 8th Century BC in the Northern Kingdom. Hosea is told by Yah to marry a woman who has left Yah to become a temple prostitute of the Bull cult. Her name is Gomer (destruction to Idolaters), her children Jezreel (seed of Yah), Lo Ruamah (disgraced) and Lo Ammi (You are no longer my people). Clearly Hosea’s message is a warning that if the Hebrews continue in the Bull cult, they will lose the kingdom of Yah. Which they did. They continue as a race, but since they rejected the Messiah, they are not Yah’s people.

      <comment>Removed superfluous section (cosmology/nationality doesn't have a place in calculus).</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Most people seem to struggle with this fact when first introduced to calculus, and in particular limits.  

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to 0^+} \frac{1}{x} = \infin . &lt;/math&gt;

But &lt;math&gt;\infin&lt;/math&gt; is different.  &lt;math&gt;\infin&lt;/math&gt; is not a number.  

Mathematics is based on formal rules that govern the subject.  When a list of formal rules applies to a type of object (e.g., &quot;a number&quot;) those rules must ''always'' apply — no exceptions!

What makes &lt;math&gt;\infin&lt;/math&gt; different is this: &quot;there is no number greater than infinity&quot;.  You can write down the formula in a lot of different ways, but here's one way: &lt;math&gt;1 +\infin = \infin&lt;/math&gt;.  If you add one to infinity, you still have infinity; you don't have a bigger number.  If you believe that, then infinity is not a number.

Since &lt;math&gt;\infin&lt;/math&gt; does not follow the rules laid down for numbers, it cannot be a number.  Every time you use the symbol &lt;math&gt;\infin&lt;/math&gt; in a formula where you would normally use a number, you have to interpret the formula differently.  Let's look at how &lt;math&gt;\infin&lt;/math&gt; does not follow the rules that every actual number does:

==Addition Breaks==
Every number has a negative, and addition is associative.   For &lt;math&gt;\infin&lt;/math&gt; we could write &lt;math&gt;-\infin&lt;/math&gt; and note that &lt;math&gt;\infin - \infin = 0&lt;/math&gt;. This is a good thing, since 
it means we can prove if you take one away from infinity, you still have infinity: &lt;math&gt;\infin -1 = (\infin +1) - 1 = \infin + (1 - 1) = \infin + 0 = \infin &lt;/math&gt;. But it also means we can prove 1 = 0, which is not so good.

:&lt;math&gt;1+ \infin = \infin&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(1+ \infin) - \infin= \infin - \infin&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;1+ (\infin - \infin)= \infin - \infin&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;1 = 0\!&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, &lt;math&gt;\infin - \infin = \mathrm{indeterminate}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Reinterpret Formulas that Use &lt;math&gt;\infin&lt;/math&gt;==

We started off with a formula that does &quot;mean&quot; something, even though it used &lt;math&gt;\infin&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\infin&lt;/math&gt; is not a number.

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to 0^+} \frac{1}{x} = \infin . &lt;/math&gt;

What does this mean, compared to what it means when we have a regular number instead of an infinity symbol:

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to 2} \frac{1}{x} = \frac1{2} . &lt;/math&gt;

This formula says that I can make sure the values of &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{x}&lt;/math&gt; don't differ very much from &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, so long as I can control how much ''x'' varies away from 2.  I don't have to make &lt;math&gt;\frac1{x}&lt;/math&gt; exactly equal to &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, but I also can't control ''x'' too tightly.  I have to give you a range to vary ''x'' within.  It's just going to be very, very small (probably) if you want to make &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{x}&lt;/math&gt; very very close to &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;. And by the way, it doesn't matter at all what happens when &lt;math&gt;x=2&lt;/math&gt;.

If we could use the same paragraph as a template for my original formula, we'll see some problems.  Let's substitute 0 for 2, and &lt;math&gt;\infin&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to 0^+} \frac{1}{x} = \infin . &lt;/math&gt;

This formula says that I can make sure the values of &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{x}&lt;/math&gt; '''don't differ  very much from &lt;math&gt;\infin&lt;/math&gt;''', so long as I can control how much ''x'' varies away from 0.  I don't have to make &lt;math&gt;\frac1{x}&lt;/math&gt; '''exactly equal to &lt;math&gt;\infin&lt;/math&gt;''', but I also can't control ''x'' too tightly.  I have to give you a range to vary ''x'' within.  It's just going to be very, very small (probably) if you want to see that  &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{x}&lt;/math&gt; gets very, very '''close to &lt;math&gt;\infin&lt;/math&gt;'''. And by the way, it doesn't matter at all what happens when &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt;.

It's close to making sense, but it isn't quite there.  It doesn't make sense to say that some real number is really &quot;close&quot; to &lt;math&gt;\infin&lt;/math&gt;.  For example, when &lt;math&gt;x = .001&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac 1 {x} = 1000&lt;/math&gt; does it really makes sense to say 1000 is closer to &lt;math&gt;\infin&lt;/math&gt; than 1 is?  Solve the following equations for δ:

:&lt;math&gt;1000 + \delta = \infin&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\delta = \infin-1000&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\delta = \infin&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;1 + \delta = \infin&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \delta = \infin - 1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \delta = \infin&lt;/math&gt;

No real number is very close to &lt;math&gt;\infin&lt;/math&gt;; that's what makes &lt;math&gt;\infin&lt;/math&gt; so special!   So we have to rephrase the paragraph:

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to 0^+} \frac{1}{x} = \infin . &lt;/math&gt;

This formula says that I can make sure the values of &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{x}&lt;/math&gt; '''get as big as any number you pick''', so long as I can control how much ''x'' varies away from 0.  I don't have to make &lt;math&gt;\frac1{x}&lt;/math&gt; '''bigger than every number''', but I also can't control ''x'' too tightly.  I have to give you a range to vary ''x'' within.  It's just going to be very, very small (probably) if you want to see that &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{x}&lt;/math&gt; gets very, very '''large'''.  And by the way, it doesn't matter at all what happens when &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt;.

You can see that the essential nature of the formula hasn't changed, but the exact details require some human interpretation.  While rigorous definitions and clear distinctions are essential to the study of mathematics, sometimes a bit of casual rewording is okay.  You just have to make sure you understand what a formula really means so you can draw conclusions correctly.

==Exercises==
Write out an explanatory paragraph for the following limits that include &lt;math&gt;\infin&lt;/math&gt;.  Remember that you will have to change any comparison of magnitude between a real number and &lt;math&gt;\infin&lt;/math&gt; to a different phrase. In the second case, you will have to work out for yourself what the formula means.

{{question-answer|question=1. &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to \infin} \frac{1}{x^2} = 0&lt;/math&gt;|answer={{noprint|This formula says that I can make the values of &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{x^2}&lt;/math&gt; as close as I would like to 0, so long as I make x sufficiently large.}}}}

'''Sawflies''' make up the suborder '''Symphyta''', a group of largely herbivorous insects in the order Hymenoptera. This group is an artificial assemblage of superfamilies that are essentially the most primitive taxa within the Hymenoptera (some going back 200 million years).

Sawflies are distinguishable from most other Hymenoptera by the broad connection between the abdomen and the thorax ''(see image)'', and the caterpillar-like larvae (below).  The common name comes from the appearance of the ovipositor, which looks much like the blade of a saw.  This ovipositor, which is modified into a &quot;stinger&quot; in some members of the Apocrita, is not used as a weapon.  Females use the ovipositor to cut into plants where they lay their eggs. A few species have long thin ovipositors used to drill holes deep into wood. Large populations can cause economic damage in cultivated areas and forests.

The larvae look like caterpillars (the larvae of moths and butterflies), with two notable exceptions; (1) they have five or more prolegs on the abdomen (caterpillars have five or fewer), and (2) they have two ocelli (eyes), instead of the caterpillar's six. Typical sawfly larvae are herbivorous, the group feeding on a wide range of plants.  Individual species, however, are often quite specific in their choice of plants used for food. The larvae of various species exhibit leaf-mining, leaf-rolling, or gall formation. The larvae that do not feed externally on plants are grub-like, without prolegs.

Adult sawflies, except for those in the family Cephidae, have structures that latch onto the underside of the forewings to help hold the wings in place when the insect is at rest.  These &quot;cenchri&quot;, which are absent in the suborder Apocrita, are located behind the scutellum on the thorax. Adults of some species are carnivorous, eating other insects, but many also feed on nectar.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What is a status item? ==
A status item is an icon that's installed in the menu bar, near the clock and other MacOS common icons, such as Volume, Spotlight, etc.
These icons provide a place to keep, for example, important shortcuts for your application, or just an icon that identify the current application status; often they are associated with menus. In this document I'll explain how to build a status item, rather than explain all the class reference which is included with your Xcode, and available on the ADC site.

== Building a status item application ==

'''The code'''

First of all you have to remember that your status item it's a separate application: when you close the application, the status item is deallocated.
Generally status items are used to control and monitor a process that the end user doesn't see, or are theirself a controller of something (see &quot;QuickTunes&quot;).

We create a new class called &quot;myStatusItem&quot;. The status item class is NSStatusItem, you have to instantiate it in your header, together with all you need:

 &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;#&lt;/nowiki&gt;import &lt;Cocoa/Cocoa.h&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;@interface myStatusItem : NSObject {&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IBOutlet NSMenu *myMenu;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NSStatusItem *statusItem;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NSImage *statusImage;&lt;br /&gt;NSImage *statusAltImage;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;br /&gt;@end&lt;/code&gt;
How can you see we have introduced two images which are the main and the alternate icons for our status item, these images are 18x18.

The next step is that of writing the true program, the &quot;.m&quot; file:
we have to tell MacOS that we want to install a status item. This is made by this line of code
 &lt;code&gt;statusItem = [[[NSStatusBar systemStatusBar] statusItemWithLength: NSSquareStatusItemLength] retain];&lt;/code&gt;
Next we can allocate the two images with
 &lt;code&gt;NSBundle *bundle = [NSBundle mainBundle];&lt;br /&gt;statusImage = [[NSImage alloc] initWithContentsOfFile: [bundle pathForResource: @&quot;statusIcon&quot; ofType: @&quot;png&quot;]];&lt;br /&gt;statusAltImage = [[NSImage alloc] initWithContentsOfFile: [bundle pathForResource: @&quot;statusAltIcon&quot; ofType: @&quot;png&quot;]];&lt;/code&gt;
Then the last lines, customize our status item:
 &lt;code&gt;[statusItem setImage: statusImage];&lt;br /&gt;[statusItem setAlternateImage: statusAltImage];&lt;br /&gt;[statusItem setMenu: myMenu];&lt;br /&gt;[statusItem setToolTip: @&quot;A tooltip&quot;];&lt;br /&gt;[statusItem setHighlightMode: YES];&lt;/code&gt;

It'd be nice to write also another method, the &lt;code&gt;dealloc&lt;/code&gt; method, after the &lt;code&gt;- (void) awakeFromNib&lt;/code&gt;, which is the main method called after the application has started. With the dealloc we help the memory management by release some things that we don't need, in fact when this happens, our app has already terminated. With this code we want to release the images that make the icon:
 &lt;code&gt;- (void) dealloc {&lt;br /&gt;[statusImage release];&lt;br /&gt;[statusAltImage release];&lt;br /&gt;[super dealloc];&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;/code&gt;


'''The interface'''

When we created our application, using the &quot;cocoa application&quot; template, Xcode made also a NIB file, that consist in our program's UI and resources. Double click the NIB for adding the interface.
Since we've already written our code and specified some outlets and our classes, we can refresh the NIB standard contents by moving in the Classes view (in the main window of Interface builder) and select &quot;Read files...&quot; from the classes menu; we select our &quot;.h&quot;. The myStatusItem class will be selected, right click it and Instantiate.
Next drop in the instace view a NSMenu item and name it like you did in the code, in this case &quot;myMenu&quot;. You can add NSMenuItem (s) under your menu and add actions to them.


'''Connecting code and interface'''

Cocoa uses the outlets to connect code and interface. If you remember we defined an outlet, NSMenu: let's connect it!
go to the Instances view and select the &quot;blue box&quot;, your app's instance. Open the Inspector and go to the Connections panel. As you can see there's listed &quot;myMenu&quot;. Control-drag from the app instance to the NSMenu icon &quot;myMenu&quot; and then hit the &quot;Connect&quot; button. That's all. Now if you press the build and go button you'll see a NSStatusItem in your status bar.
(You have to add the two images to your active target in your project).

Is the peanut butter version I see floating around another Thai recipe, or merely a misinterpration of real Pad Thai?

Pad Thai is often served covered in coarse peanut grindings around here.

''Trialeurodes vaporariorum'', commonly known as the glasshouse or '''greenhouse whitefly''' inhabits the world’s temperate regions. It is a primary insect pest of many fruit, vegetable and ornamental crops, frequently being found in glasshouses and other protected horticultural environments. Adults are 1-2 mm in length, with yellowish bodies and four wax-coated wings held near parallel to the leaf surface.

==Symptoms and Signs==
All life-stages apart from eggs and pupae cause crop damage through direct feeding, inserting their stylet into leaf veins and extracting nourishment from the phloem sap. As a by-product of feeding, honeydew is excreted and that alone can be a second, major source of damage. The third and potentially most harmful characteristic is the ability of adults to transmit several plant viruses. The crop hosts principally affected are vegetables such as cucurbits, potatoes and tomatoes, although a range of other crop and non-crop plants including weed species are susceptible, and can therefore harbour the infection.

==Ecology==
Females are capable of mating less than 24 hours after emergence and most frequently lay their eggs on the undersides of leaves. Eggs are pale yellow in colour, before turning grey prior to hatching. Newly hatched larvae, often known as crawlers, are the only mobile immature life-stage. During the first and second larval instars, the appearance is that of a pale yellow/translucent, flat scale which can be difficult to distinguish with the naked eye. During the fourth and final immature life-stage (the pupa), compound eyes and other body tissues become visible as the larvae thicken and rise from the leaf-surface.

==Host plants==
[[Image:Trialeurodes vaporariorum02.jpg|thumb|300px|Nymphs and damage on a leaf]]
Greenhouse whiteflies feed on a wide range of plants, including plants in the following genera:
*[[../Aster/]]
*[[../Brassica/]]
*[[../Camellia/]]
*[[../Cercis/]]
*[[../Cucumis/]]
*[[../Dahlia/]]
*[[../Hydrangea/]]
*[[../Ilex/]] (Holly)
*[[../Ipomoea/]]
*[[../Lactuca/]] (Lettuce)
*[[../Lilium/]]
*[[../Lonicera/]]
*[[../Lycopersicon/]]
*[[../Ocimum/]]
*[[../Rhododendron/]] (Rhododendron, Azalea)
*[[../Salvia/]] (Sage)
*[[../Verbena/]]

==Control==  
Effective control has been provided for many years through the release of beneficial insects, such as the [[w:aphelinid]] parasitoid, ''[[../Encarsia formosa/]]''. If required, integrated pest management strategies can incorporate applications of selective chemical insecticides that complement these natural enemies. For the majority of outdoor crops chemicals are still the most widely used method of control.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''selectivity''' of pesticides (including herbicides) refers to how narrow a range of organisms it kills. For example, some herbicides only affect broadleaf plants or grasses, while while others kill all plants (the latter type is called '''unselective''').

'''''Asteraceae''''' (formerly and often still referred to as '''''Compositae''''') is a large family of broadleaf plants known for their distinctive inflorescences, called '''heads'''. 

Most members of this family are excellent nectar sources, and thus help play a part in attracting predatory insects and pollinators to the garden.

==Genera and species==

It appears you have posted on may talk page.  Please sign your posts as shown above.  If you posted from an IP prior to that please confirm that on my talk page - it was not a civil posting --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 19:24, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

I don't agree with you on that, on what bases do you call it uncivil ? (It can indeed be considered uncivil to wrongly claim incivility without proper reason) --Cinap(se) 19:25, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

== Further ==

Reading you post it seems you are stating that you are a sock puppet and are &quot;contesting&quot; another Wikibookian - your confirmation of that would be appreciated.  I am not like some of the people here --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 19:28, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

Humm, do you have any particular reasons to hate sock puppets, I love them, I do prefer Chinese Shadow's.&lt;br&gt;
What would you do with such confirmation is there a policy that disallows them ? I read something on the block page about a user having several of them (with two hands) he can only use a few see if you can, resolve is dilemma...
Haa and what about bots aren't bot accounts are they similar to sock puppets ? --Cinap(se) 19:35, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</text>

The {{C sharp|goto}} keyword returns the flow of operation to the label which follows it. Labels can be created by putting a colon after any word. e.g.

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
thelabel:       // This is a label
 System.Console.WriteLine(&quot;Blah blah blah&quot;);
 goto thelabel; // Program flow returns to thelabel
&lt;/source&gt;

The use of goto is very controversial, because, when used frivolously, it creates code that jumps from place to place and is disorganized and hard to read. It is rarely even necessary because the same thing can often be accomplished with a more organized [[C Sharp Programming/Control#for loop|{{C sharp|for}} loop]] or [[C Sharp Programming/Control#while loop|{{C sharp|while}} loop]] loop.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction to Problem Solving with Multiple Components and Processes ==

In the vast majority of chemical processes, in which some raw materials are processed to yield a desired end product or set of end products, there will be more than one raw material entering the system and more than one unit operation through which the product must pass in order to achieve the desired result. The calculations for such processes, as you can probably guess, are considerably more complicated than those either for only a single component, or for a single-operation process. Therefore, several techniques have been developed to aid engineers in their analyses. This section describes these techniques and how to apply them to an example problem.

== Degree of Freedom Analysis ==

For more complex problems than the single-component or single-operation problems that have been explored, it is essential that you have a method of determining if a problem is even solvable given the information that you have. There are three ways to describe a problem in terms of its solvability:

# If the problem has a finite (not necessarily unique!) set of solutions then it is called '''well-defined'''.
# The problem can be '''overdetermined''' (also known as '''overspecified'''), which means that you have too much information and it is either redundant or inconsistent. This could possibly be fixed by consolidating multiple data into a single function or, in extreme cases, a single value (such as a slope of a linear correlation), or it could be fixed by removing an assumption about the system that one had made.
# The problem can be '''underdetermined''' (or '''underspecified'''), which means that you don't have enough information to solve for all your unknowns. There are several ways of dealing with this. The most obvious is to gather additional information, such as measuring additional temperatures, flow rates, and so on until you have a well-defined problem. Another way is to use additional equations or information about what we want out of a process, such as how much conversion you obtain in a reaction, how efficient a separation process is, and so on. Finally, we can '''make assumptions''' in order to simplify the equations, and perhaps they will simplify enough that they become solvable.

The method of analyzing systems to see whether they are over or under-specified, or if they are well-defined, is called a '''degree of freedom analysis'''. It works as follows for mass balances on a '''single process''':

# From your flowchart, determine the number of '''unknowns''' in the process. What qualifies as an unknown depends on what you're looking for, but in a material balance calculation, masses and concentrations are the most common. In equilibrium and energy balance calculations, temperature and pressure also become important unknowns. In a reactor, you should include the conversion as an unknown unless it is given OR you are doing an atom balance.
# Subtract the number of '''Equations''' you can write on the process. This can include mass balances, energy balances, equilibrium relationships, relations between concentrations, and any equations derived from additional information about the process.
# The number you are left with is the degrees of freedom of the process.

If the degrees of freedom are '''negative''' that means the unit operation is '''overspecified'''.
If it is '''positive''', the operation is '''underspecified'''.
If it is '''zero''' then the unit operation is '''well-defined''', meaning that it is theoretically possible to solve for the unknowns with a finite set of solutions.

=== Degrees of Freedom in Multiple-Process Systems ===

Multiple-process systems are tougher but not undoable. Here is how to analyze them to ''see if a problem is uniquely solvable'':

# Label a flowchart completely with all the relevant unknowns.
# Perform a degree of freedom analysis on each unit operation, as described above.
# Add the degrees of freedom for each of the operations.
# Subtract the number of variables in ''intermediate streams'', i.e. streams between two unit operations. This is because each of these was counted twice, once for the operation it leaves and once for the one it enters.

The number you are left with is the '''process degrees of freedom''', and this is what will tell you if the process as a ''whole'' is overspecified, underspecified, or well-defined.

{{NOTE|If any single process is overspecified, and is found to be inconsistent, then the problem as a whole cannot be solved, regardless of whether the process as a whole is well-defined or not.}}

== Using Degrees of Freedom to Make a Plan ==

Once you have determined that your problem is solvable, you still need to figure out how you'll solve for your variables. This is the suggested method.

# Find a unit operation or combination of unit operations for which the degrees of freedom are zero.
# Calculate all of the unknowns involved in this combination.
# '''Recalculate''' the degrees of freedom for each process, treating the calculated values as known rather than as variables.
# Repeat these steps until everything is calculated (or at least that which you seek)

{{NOTE|You must be careful when recalculating the degrees of freedom in a process. You have to be aware of the '''sandwich effect''', in which calculations from one unit operation can trivialize balances on another operation. For example, suppose you have three processes lined up like this:

-&gt; A -&gt; B -&gt; C -&gt;

Suppose also that through mass balances on operations A and C, you calculate the exit composition of A and the inlet composition of C. Once these are performed, ''the mass balances on B are already completely defined''. The moral of the story is that '''before you claim that you can write an equation to solve an unknown, write the equation and make sure that it contains an unknown'''. Do not count equations that have no unknowns in your degree of freedom analysis.}}

== Multiple Components and Multiple Processes: Orange Juice Production ==

{{example|Consider a process in which raw oranges are processed into orange juice. A possible process description follows:

# The oranges enter a crusher, in which all of the water contained within the oranges is released.
# The now-crushed oranges enter a strainer. The strainer is able to capture 90% of the solids, the remainder exit with the orange juice as pulp.

The velocity of the orange juice stream was measured to be &lt;math&gt; 30 \frac{m}{s} &lt;/math&gt; and the radius of the piping was 8 inches. Calculate:

a) The mass flow rate of the orange juice product.
b) The number of oranges per year that can be processed with this process if it is run 8 hours a day and 360 days a year. Ignore changes due to unsteady state at startup.

Use the following data:
Mass of an orange: 0.4 kg
Water content of an orange: 80%
Density of the solids: Since its mostly sugars, its about the density of glucose, which is &lt;math&gt; 1.540 \frac{g}{cm^3} &lt;/math&gt;}}

=== Step 1: Draw a Flowchart ===

This time we have multiple processes so it's especially important to label each one as its given in the problem.

[[Image:OrangeJuiceFlowchart.PNG]]

Notice how I changed the 90% capture of solids into an algebraic equation relating the mass of solids in the solid waste to the mass in the feed. This will be important later, because ''it is an additional piece of information that is necessary to solve the problem''.

Also note that from here in, &quot;solids&quot; are referred to as S and &quot;water&quot; as W.

=== Step 2: Degree of Freedom analysis ===

Recall that for each stream there are C independent unknowns, where C is the number of components in the individual stream. These generally are '''concentrations''' of C-1 species and the '''total mass flow rate''', since with C-1 concentrations we can find the last one, but we cannot obtain the total mass flow rate from only concentration.

Let us apply the previously described algorithm to determining if the problem is well-defined.

'''On the strainer''':
* There are '''6''' unknowns: m2, xS3, m3, xS3, m4, and xS4
* We can write '''2''' independent mass balances on the overall system (one for each component).
* We are given a conversion and enough information to write the mass flow rate in the product in terms of only concentration of one component (which eliminates one unknown). Thus we have '''2''' additional pieces of information.
* Thus the degrees of freedom of the strainer are 6-2-2 = '''2 DOF'''

{{NOTE|We are given the mass of an individual orange, but since we cannot use that information alone to find a total mass flow rate of oranges in the feed, and we already have used up our allotment of C-1 independent concentrations, we cannot count this as &quot;given information&quot;. If, however, we were told the number of oranges produced per year, then we could use the two pieces of information in tandem to eliminate a single unknown (because then we can find the mass flow rate)}}

'''On the crusher''':
* There are '''3''' unknowns (m1, m2, and xS2).
* We can write '''2''' independent mass balances.
* Thus the crusher has 3-2 = '''1 DOF'''

Therefore for the '''system as a whole''':
* Sum of DOF for unit operations = 2 + 1 = 3 DOF
* Number of intermediate variables = 2 (m2 and xS2)
* Total DOF = 3 - 2 = '''1 DOF'''.

Hence the problem is '''underspecified'''.

=== So how to we solve it? ===

In order to solve an underspecified problem, one way we can obtain an additional specification is to '''make an assumption'''. What assumptions could we make that would reduce the number of unknowns (or equivalently, increase the number of variables we do know)?

'''The most common type of assumption is to assume that something that is relatively insignificant is zero'''.

In this case, one could ask: will the solid stream from the strainer contain any water? It might, of course, but this amount is probably very small compared to both the amount of solids that are captured and how much is strained, provided that it is cleaned regularly and designed well. If we make this assumption, then ''this specifies that the mass fraction of water in the waste stream is zero'' (or equivalently, that the mass fraction of solids is one). Therefore, we know one additional piece of information and the degrees of freedom for the overall system become zero.

=== Step 3: Convert Units ===

This step should be done ''after'' the degree of freedom analysis, because that analysis is independent of your unit system, and if you don't have enough information to solve a problem (or worse, you have too much), you shouldn't waste time converting units and should instead spend your time defining the problem more precisely and/or seeking out appropriate assumptions to make.

Here, the most sensible choice is either to convert everything to the cgs system or to the m-kg-s system, since most values are already in metric. Here, the latter route is taken.

&lt;math&gt; r_4 = 8\mbox{ in} * \frac{2.54 \mbox{ cm}}{in} * \frac{1 \mbox{ m}}{100 \mbox{ cm}} = 0.2032 \mbox{ m}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; {\rho}_S = 1.54\frac{g}{cm^3} = 1540 \frac{kg}{m^3} &lt;/math&gt;

Now that everything is in the same system, we can move on to the next step.

=== Step 4: Relate your variables ===

First we have to relate the velocity and area given to us to the mass flowrate of stream 4, so that we can actually use that information in a mass balance. From chapter 2, we can start with the equation:

&lt;math&gt; {\rho}_n*v_n*A_n = \dot{m}_n &lt;/math&gt;

Since the pipe is circular and the area of a circle is &lt;math&gt; \pi *r^2 &lt;/math&gt;, we have:

&lt;math&gt; A_4 = \pi * 0.2032^2 = 0.1297 \mbox{ m}^2 &lt;/math&gt;

So we have that:

&lt;math&gt; {\rho}_4 * 30 * 0.1297 = 3.8915*{\rho}_4 = \dot{m}_4 &lt;/math&gt;

Now to find the density of stream 4 we assume that volumes are additive, since the solids and water are essentially immiscible (does an orange dissolve when you wash it?). Hence we can use the ideal-fluid model for density:

&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{\rho_4} = \frac{x_{S4}}{\rho_S} + \frac{x_{W4}}{\rho_W} = \frac{x_{S4}}{\rho_S} + \frac{1-x_{S4}}{\rho_W }&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; = \frac{x_{S4}}{1540} + \frac{1-x_{S4}}{1000} &lt;/math&gt;

Hence, we have the equation we need with only concentrations and mass flowrates:

{{box|EQUATION 1: &lt;math&gt;\frac{x_{S4}}{1540} + \frac{1-x_{S4}}{1000}=\frac{3.8915}{\dot{m}_4} &lt;/math&gt;}}

Now we have an equation but we haven't used either of our two (why two?) independent mass balances yet. We of course have a choice on which two to use.

In this particular problem, since we are directly given information concerning the amount of ''solid'' in stream 4 (the product stream), it seems to make more sense to do the balance on this component. Since we don't have information on stream 2, and finding it would be pointless in this case (all parts of it are the same as those of stream 1), lets do an overall-system balance on the solids:

&lt;math&gt; \Sigma \dot{m}_{S,in}  - \Sigma \dot{m}_{S,out} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

{{NOTE|Since there is no reaction, the generation term is 0 even for individual-species balances.}}

Expanding the mass balance in terms of mass fractions gives:

&lt;math&gt; \dot{m}_1*x_{S1} = \dot{m}_3*x_{S3} + \dot{m}_4*x_{S4} &lt;/math&gt;

Plugging in the known values, '''with the assumption that stream 3 is pure solids (no water)''' and hence &lt;math&gt; x_{S3} = 1 &lt;/math&gt;:

{{box|EQUATION 2: &lt;math&gt; 0.2*\dot{m}_1 = (0.9*0.2*\dot{m}_1) * 1 + x_{S4}*\dot{m}_4 &lt;/math&gt;}}

Finally, we can utilize one further mass balance, so let's use the easiest one: the overall mass balance. This one again assumes that the total flowrate of stream 3 is equal to the solids flowrate.

{{box|EQUATION 3: &lt;math&gt; \dot{m}_1 = 0.9*0.2*\dot{m}_1 + \dot{m}_4 &lt;/math&gt;}}

We now have three equations in three unknowns &lt;math&gt; (\dot{m}_1, \dot{m}_4, x_{S4}) &lt;/math&gt; so the problem is solvable. This is where all those system-solving skills will come in handy.

If you don't like solving by hand, there are numerous computer programs out there to help you solve equations like this, such as [[MATLAB]], POLYMATH, and many others. You'll probably want to learn how to use the one your school prefers eventually so why not now?

Using either method, the results are:

{{box|&lt;math&gt; \dot{m}_1 = 4786\frac{kg}{s} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \dot{m}_4 = 3925.07 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; x_{S4} = 0.0244 &lt;/math&gt;}}

We're almost done here, now we just have to calculate the number of oranges per year.

&lt;math&gt; 4786\frac{kg}{s} * 1\frac{orange}{0.4\mbox{ kg}} * 3600 \frac{s}{hr} * 8 \frac{wk\mbox{ hr}}{day}* 360\frac{\mbox{wk day}}{year}&lt;/math&gt;

{{box|Yearly Production: &lt;math&gt;1.24*10^{11} \frac{oranges}{year}&lt;/math&gt;}}

'''''Asparagus''''' is the name of a genus of plants, a member of the family Asparagaceae (formerly placed in the [[../Liliaceae/]]). There are up to 300 species, all from the Old World, introduced in many countries in both hemispheres and throughout temperate and tropical regions. Many species from Africa are now included in the genera ''Protasparagus'' and ''Myrsiphyllum''.  However, recent studies have shown that the taxonomic level genera may not be appropriate; instead, division into subgenera or no division at all may be more appropriate.

==Description==
They range from herbs to somewhat woody climbers. Most species have flattened stems (phylloclades), that serve the function of leaves. Three species (''[[../Asparagus officinalis/]], &quot;[[../Asparagus schoberioides/]]'' and ''[[../Asparagus cochinchinensis/]]'') are dioecious species, i.e. with male and female flowers on separate plants. The others may or may not be hermaphroditic.

==Growing conditions==
&lt;!--sun, soil, etc.--&gt;

*''[[../Asparagus umbellatus/]]''
*''[[../Asparagus virgatus/]]''

==Uses==
The best known member of the genus is the vegetable asparagus (''[[../Asparagus officinalis/]]''). Other species of asparagus are grown as ornamental plants. Some species such as ''[[../Asparagus setaceus/]]'' have branches that resemble 'ferns', hence they are often called &quot;Asparagus fern&quot; (though they are not true ferns). They are often used for foliage display, and as houseplants. Commonly-grown ornamental species are ''[[../Asparagus plumosus/]]'', ''[[../Asparagus densiflorus/]]'', and ''[[../Asparagus sprengeri/]]''.  Some other species have been introduced as weeds,  such as '''Bridal Creeper''', ''[[../Asparagus asparagoides/]]'', which is a major weed species in southern Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.weeds.crc.org.au/main/wom_bridal_creeper.html |accessdate=2006-04-30 |work=weed of the month |title=bridal creeper |publisher=CRC weed management}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ento.csiro.au/biocontrol/bridal.html |title=Bridal creeper, ''Asparagus asparagoides''|publisher=CSIRO Division of Entomology |accessdate=2006-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{:uim/Navigation}}

== Set environment variables ==

To use uim, you need to set a few environment variables, and optionally start some of the bridges (&lt;code&gt;uim-xim&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;uim-fep&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;[http://code.google.com/p/uim/wiki/UIMSystemConfiguration System Configuration for uim]&lt;/ref&gt;

In your X session initiation script (this may be &lt;code&gt;~/.xinitrc&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;~/.xsession&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;~/.gnomerc&lt;/code&gt; depending on your system), set
  export GTK_IM_MODULE='uim'  # Instructs the GTK immodule to use uim
  export QT_IM_MODULE='uim'   # Instructs the Qt immodule to use uim
  export XMODIFIERS='@im=uim' # Instructs XIM to use uim
and you should be able to use ''uim'' in all GTK+ and Qt applications.

{{:uim/todo|Can UIM_CANDWIN_PROG be set in the config files?}}

== Select a default input method ==

By default, ''uim'' starts up the direct input method (that passes everything unmodified back to the application). To change this you will need to specify a default input method.

=== Configuration file ===
Put
  (define default-im-name '&lt;im-name&gt;)
in your &lt;code&gt;~/.uim&lt;/code&gt; configuration file. You can get a list of allowed &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;im-name&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;s by running
  uim-xim --list

=== Graphical configuration tool ===
[[Image:Uim-pref-default im.png|right|thumb|300px|Selection of a default input method in &lt;code&gt;uim-pref-gtk&lt;/code&gt;]]

# Run &lt;code&gt;uim-pref-gtk&lt;code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;uim-pref-qt&lt;/code&gt;.
# Select the &quot;Global settings&quot; group.
# In the &quot;Input method deployment&quot; section, check &quot;Specify default IM&quot; and choose the one you want from the list.

The list includes only ''enabled'' IMs. If the the one you want isn't in the list, you may need to press the &quot;Edit&quot; button in by the &quot;Enabled input methods&quot; field in the &quot;Input method deployment&quot; section.

If you cannot find your favorite IM in the list of enabled input methods, please check that you have it installed.

== The XIM (X Input Method) protocol ==

For non-GTK/Qt applications (through the XIM protocol) run
  uim-xim &amp;
from your X session initiation script so that you have an instance running when you enter the X windows system.

:''For further details, refer to [[UIM_2dXIM|uim-xim]] documentation.''
:''Freedesktop.org site: http://uim.freedesktop.org/wiki/UIM_2dXIM.''

== Virtual terminals ==

If you choose not to run &lt;code&gt;uim-xim&lt;/code&gt; (the GTK and Qt bridges should work for most every application available in X) or need it in console, you can use the ''uim'' Front End Processor (FEP) bridge. Start it by running
  uim-fep
You will see an indicator in the bottom line of the terminal showing which ''[[Uim/Glossary#Input Method|input method]]'' is in use and which mode it is in.

:''For more, see: [[uim/uim-fep|uim-fep]]''
:''Freedesktop.org site: http://uim.freedesktop.org/wiki/UIM_2dFEP.''

== Emacs ==

{{:uim/todo|This will have to be written by an emacs man. I've never touched that beast.}}

:''For more, see: [[uim/uim-el|uim-el]].''
:''Freedesktop.org site: http://uim.freedesktop.org/wiki/UIM_2dEL.''

== Toolbars ==

''Uim'' comes with a few tools to control the active conversion engine and some of its options. These are on toolbars that you may just be able to integrate into your desktop environment.

[[Image:Uim-toolbar-gtk.png|right|thumb|165px|&lt;code&gt;uim-toolbar-gtk&lt;/code&gt; with Anthy enabled]]
The tools are:
* &lt;code&gt;uim-toolbar-gtk&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;uim-toolbar-gtk-systray&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;uim-toolbar-qt&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;uim-toolbar-qt4&lt;/code&gt; (&gt;= uim 1.5.7)

If you use GNOME, you should probably use the ones with &quot;gtk&quot; in the name, and KDE users would be advised to use the &quot;qt&quot; or &quot;qt4&quot; one. GTK+ and Qt are the widget toolkits that GNOME and KDE are written in, so this will ensure a consistent look and feel). Aside from that, the toolbars should be environment independent and you can use them regardless of which graphical environment you use.

As for now, you just have to play around with these as there is no further documentation for these (sorry).

: ''A useful resource is the [http://uimwikija.mw.cmssquare.com/index.php/Uim-toolbar Uim-toolbar] page on the Japanese Anthy/Uim wiki.''

You can pass a positional argument to &lt;code&gt;uim-toolbar-gtk&lt;/code&gt;.
 uim-toolbar-gtk +200-100
will place the toolbar at 200 pixels from the left and 100 pixels from the bottom. Change the sign to change from which edge the pixels count.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Usage ==

Include the archive box in the article by adding
&lt;pre&gt;{{Archive box|[[/Archive]]}}&lt;/pre&gt;
to where you want the archive box to appear. Make sure to add the forward slash '/' to the archive name to make it a subpage of the page where the archive box is placed. How you present a list of archive pages is up to you. You can separate them with commas, pipes (vertical lines: '|') or as lists. See [[#Examples]] below.

=== Placement ===

The box uses a style that makes it float to the right. This means that where it appears in the page it will be aligned to the right edge of the page (more accurately: the containing box, but that is an unnecessary detail) and all following content will flow around it.

=== Automatic links ===

If all the archives of a talk page are numbered (&lt;tt&gt;/Archive 1&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;/Archive 2&lt;/tt&gt; etc.), you can the &lt;tt&gt;auto&lt;/tt&gt; parameter to display links to them all automatically:
&lt;pre&gt;{{archive box|auto=yes}}&lt;/pre&gt;
The list will update itself when new archives are added. If there are also named archives, you can add links to these as well.

If there are less than 20 archive pages, and you prefer a larger two-column output, set the &lt;tt&gt;auto&lt;/tt&gt; parameter to &quot;long&quot;, all other parameter values will trigger the above format, so if you want longer and more visible links, try:
&lt;pre&gt;{{archive box|auto=long}}&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Box width and image ===

The box and image widths can be set by passing their widths as parameters:
&lt;pre&gt;{{Archive box|box-width=13em|image-width=35px|[[/Archive]]}}&lt;/pre&gt;

The image can also be changed from the default, [[:Image:Vista-file-manager.png]], for example:
&lt;pre&gt;{{Archive box|image=[[Image:Crystal Clear app file-manager.png]]}}&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Examples ===

For actual examples of the use of this template, use the [[Special:Whatlinkshere/Template:Archive_box|what links here]] link in the toolbox on the sidebar, near the top on the left side of this page (unless you are using an unconventional skin ... in which case you probably know what you are doing).

== Wrong description of hyperthreading technology ==

The hyperthreading cpus are described as being multicore. This is not the case - see the wikipedia article on hyperthreading for example. Sorry, can't fix it right now. [[User:134.214.103.196|134.214.103.196]] 18:49, 18 August 2005 (UTC)

== Editing Problems ==

Sectional editing has remained unfixed for quite some time.  The links for the editing does not direct to where it's supposed to, it jumps approximately two sections down from every edit link's original position.
:The problem seems to be that the edit links in the Table of Contents point to the Choosing the Parts section, so everything is off by two.  I'm not sure how to fix it though. [[User:129.55.200.20|129.55.200.20]] 18:21, 10 August 2005 (UTC)

== Need updates on Technology ==

Due to recent development in new technology... could someone please add details to the new
* PCI-Express 1x
* PCI-Express 16x
* Serial ATA
* 5.1, 6.1, 7.1 sound cards
* USB 2.0
* IEEE 1394 Firewire
* New Intel CPU Numbers for Core Duo and Core 2 Duo
* Graphics Cards

Thanks...

== What's considered primary, secondary, perephrial? ==

I don't think a computer could quite work without a video card. So why is it secondary? I'd say it's more neccisary than RAM. (However, good luck finding an OS to fit on your CPU's cache.) Also, a computer can be run without a hard drive using a live CD like knoppix. However, try using it without a monitor. So how exactly where hardware component categorized into their categories? [[User:Reub2000|Reub2000]] 21:51, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:You need RAM. You certainly don't need a video card. Sometimes a low-quality BIOS will demand one. It is common to run servers without a video card. (real server operating systems like Linux and Solaris don't need a GUI) A good BIOS can even be configured over the serial port, network, or management connection. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 05:09, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:Video card should be listed as primary - Our section on video cards mention On-board cards - remember that this is trying to aim at non-technical users - I can't see people who are new to Computer design wanting to make a server, they will want a game machine or similar.  Primary parts should be everything that needs to be considered to make the computer work - You need a Graphics card in this case.  --[[User:Noogz|Noogz]] 04:35, 17 Apr 2005 (UTC)

::I think that is the wrong audience to aim for. Non-technical users should not be building computers. Most of them will know enough to avoid doing so. A few will press ahead and damage things. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 04:48, 17 Apr 2005 (UTC)

::: You miss what I mean by Non-technical - I mean people who won't use it for Servers and the like - I mean it's aiming at people who want to try to make a computer, and aiming too high will mean that the book's target is missed.  You are missing the point by aiming the bar way too high - don't assume that people who are not technically-minded will botch building a computer.--[[User:150.101.110.203|150.101.110.203]] 10:28, 19 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:::the previous poster hit it on the head, the difference between a primary device and secondary device is usually a matter of user need.  The general readership of this article is a mixed audience, from the newb to the techie, so there will be different levels of needs.[[User:4.245.113.84|4.245.113.84]] 23:41, 3 June 2006 (UTC)

::::On the topic of our audience, don't you think someone that is planning on building a computer will likely already know what a keyboard, mouse, and monitor are? --[[User:Bpogi|Bpogi]] 00:59, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

== quiet operation ==

Please stop deleting info about noise reduction. Noise reduction is one of the major reasons to build a PC. If one merely wants a fast computer, there are plenty of ready-made ones to choose from. The [http://www.newisys.com/products/4300.html Newisys 4300] and [http://www.sun.com/servers/entry/v40z/index.jsp Sun v40z] are good examples. For a ready-made quiet computer... well you could get a Mac I guess, if you like MacOS or Debian. That's not really a PC though.

Continuous noise is proven to be harmful to both hearing and mental state. A quiet computer can run all night long on a stand beside the head of your bed. A noisy one must be turned off just so you can have a peaceful dinner in the next room.

I found the info about getting 7 volts from 12 and 5 to be interesting. (note that I didn't write it originally) Please put it back.

Future things to add:

*dryer exhaust tube over the exhaust fan
*remove, via hacksaw if necessary, the fan guards
*automotive sound insulation (sticky tar-like goo in a paper sandwich)
*concrete
*USB audio, removing a heat source from the case
*external FireWire hard disk, removing a heat source from the case
*chimney
*solid-state &quot;disks&quot; have no moving parts (usually flash-based)
*LCD displays are silent
*underclocking and CPU voltage reduction
*graphics card underclocking
*hard disk settings to reduce head motion noise

: What user base is this article aimed at? From the writing it appears to be aimed at a more basic user. One handy enough to install windows, but it unlikely that modders would be reading an article like this. [[User:PPGMD|PPGMD]] 14:27, 7 May 2005 (UTC)

:: I don't know what userbase, but the far less useful overclocking info is included. If the noise reduction info goes, then all mention of overclocking should go as well. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 19:43, 7 May 2005 (UTC)

::: I actually agree. Other than basic overclocking that is semi safe OCing like the video card, OCing should not be mentioned. Now basic design for quiet cooling should also be mentioned but other attempts should not be mentioned as they should only be done with expert consultation to people new to cooling and computers. [[User:PPGMD|PPGMD]] 01:18, 8 May 2005 (UTC)

:::: Well, whether or not these go depends on the userbase. Maybe both should stay. Maybe both should go. Maybe just OCing should go. Both are real reasons to build your own computer, with silent operation being the more important of the two. I would think that video card OCing is fairly unsafe; at least an Intel CPU comes with some overtemperature protection. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 02:36, 8 May 2005 (UTC)

::::: Actually they both come with Thermal protection. AMD added it in with the Athlon 64s because of the negative publicity that they got from the video on Tom's Hardware. I think that mentioning the basics of both is the best way to go, but getting too indepth with either (which the fan voltage is one example) can be dangerous based on the aimed userbase of this book. [[User:PPGMD|PPGMD]] 02:51, 8 May 2005 (UTC)

::This article doesn't have an intended audience that I know of. If you think it is something that could harm components or the reader, please put a warning in all caps and bolded. But I don't see why you consider anything too advanced, should not be included for readers who are more advanced. [[User:Reub2000|Reub2000]] 18:48, 8 May 2005 (UTC)

::: Every book or article has an intended audience, unless it's simply a place for you to write how smart you are. Now one way we can segment it, is to create a section of advanced topics. The Overclocking and Optimization section would be a great place for it, since it says nothing about Optimization ATM. We then can change the part selection page with some basics, and tell them to reference that section. [[User:PPGMD|PPGMD]] 21:30, 8 May 2005 (UTC)

:::: What I meant was this book is intended for anyone building a computer. I don't see why this book can't target a wide audiance. I think a simple notice saying that something advanced would do IMO. And the optimization section is in development untill more work is done on it. [[User:Reub2000|Reub2000]] 00:17, 9 May 2005 (UTC)

:::::This is guide not a novel. You aren't supposed to read it cover to cover, you just read what concerns you. -CarbonUnit

:::::: I added a reference to &quot;silencing&quot; section of the &quot;optimization&quot; page, as [[User:PPGMD|PPGMD]] suggested. --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 16:32, 28 December 2005 (UTC)

:::::: The article currently says

''Some components, like hard disk drives and CD drives, produce noise, especially the higher speed drives.  ... Note: If you have any older hard drives, the slower the drive spins the noisier it becomes.''

:::::: This is contradictory: faster drives are noisier, and also slower drives are noisier? Huh?</text>

This is a call for comment (open to anyone who wishes to participate) on what your view is on the subject. Both [[User:Darklama|darklama]] and [[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] agree that what is needed is clarification and the opinion of others to help resolve this issue, and depending on the outcome a guideline or policy may need to be created or existing ones clarified to help prevent future confusion and similar disputes.

Below is a summary of what we agree and disagree on along with a each of our views on what we disagree on.

== Summary ==
Both [[User:Darklama|darklama]] and [[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] agree that anyone is free to contribute to any wikibook and that no one individual owns a wikibook and controls its contents and all opinions are welcomed and should be taken in consideration.

Both [[User:Darklama|darklama]] and [[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] disagree with each other's interpretation of the GFDL, author status, weight of contributors on a book community discussion and whether or not [[Wikibooks:Decision making]] also addresses decision making of book contributions in addition to general wikibook decisions.

== External information provided ==

*A copy of the GFDL exists below every wikibook page but a full and probably more complete version is available in (http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html ).
*In reference to moral rights and authors it was pointed out (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright#Moral_rights).
*References to law were given (http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ1.html#wnp) and a not so clear (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_copyright_law) and it is believed that since Wikimedia Foundation is registered in the US that those are the bases we work under.

== Darklama point of view ==
[[User:Darklama|darklama]] Defends that the GFDL states anyone who make any modifications can add to the authors section, his or her name and that the GFDL does not state what or how many modifications are required to do so. Wikibooks policy AFAIK, only makes an exception to this in the case of anonymous, unregistered users who have contributed. Wikibooks does not favor contributors based on the weight of their contributions to a book in the decision making process, only in the number of participating registered users who vote for or against a decision in the case of a straw vote. Discussion between book contributors who disagree is also managed through the use of the [[Wikibooks:Decision making]] process.

== Panic point of view ==
[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] Defends that the GFDL does a distinction from editor to authors, based on their changes to the work (it doesn't define author [[w:Per se|per se]] so the legal meaning is implied). So that  punctual changes on content, content deletion, page moves and reformatting of the structure, book rename and determining who has the right to be included as an author (ie: spell checking will not grant you a place as an author), or for instance choosing of a book cover should fall or be managed (discussed, approved or be dismissed) only by the book authors or recognized contributors (the [[w:De facto|de facto]] book community). Wikimedia does also provide guidelines that places a distinction on users/contributors for example in voting and any wikibook or community working on them HAVE to be guided primarily by the GFDL. It is his opinion that if any one has the same decision rights, a book will stall, generate needless discussions (probably by people that will not or have not contributed content to it) and only generate chaos without producing content (for instance a group of spammers could aggregate and freely vandalize a book if only numbers would allow it) or even become a copyright violation (Panic doesn't like IP, or copyright laws but has anyone must obied by them).

==Comments ==
===Comments by [[User:SBJohnny]]===

I've been watching this with some concern, and I'm afraid Panic is getting out of hand at this point. You write:

:&quot;''I, at this moment, will not recognize you as part of the C++ Programming community, as in author or by having contributed content to the book, I recognize and value your work in correcting spelling, the motivation of trying to change the words of phrases so it could be easier to understand to beginners and a will to try to better the work nothing more.''&quot;

When it seems that you have in the past &quot;shot down&quot; any changes darklama wants to make. Going by this approach, you would be the only &quot;recognised author&quot; here, and can simply make sure it stays that way be repeatedly reverting another contributor's edits.

:Not so...--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 16:29, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

Your interpretation of the GFDL is deeply mistaken: the GFDL has nothing to say about &quot;author lists&quot; or disputes between authors, except that all authors (including those who spellcheck, etc.) are credited in any copy made of this book on another project or in print (in the edit histories of each page). Your misuse of the GFDL to justify ownership of this book is truly appaling.

:Ho not, not you to, gezz...

:&quot;''this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others.''&quot;

::Yes, but this doesn't say anything about &quot;who gets to edit&quot;. -SBJ

:::Yup it doesn't but Wikibooks provide the framework, anyone can edit, but as wikibooks policies takes only votes for a user  within 20 edit rule, books contribution should fallow book communities decissions or are you saing that there is no designing or controling body on a work that it's only vote by numbers? If so is there a structure or is it chaotic edit and never ending reformating of a work? If it exist who does have a place in deciding the evolution of a work ?--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 16:38, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

:&quot;''List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement.''&quot;

::This refers to either print versions or forks. It has nothing to do with creative control (except that it gives full control to anyone making a fork). -SBJ

:&quot;''Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document. (the author section is one)''&quot; - SBJ

::&quot;Author section&quot; = &quot;page history&quot;.

:::Nope, &quot;Author section&quot; is a copyright declaration and a substitute to the authors list that should be in the title page, &quot;page history&quot; is the section refered in GFDL Entitled &quot;History&quot;--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 16:46, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

:As we are in wikibooks and not in a dead tree book a broader use of &quot;title page&quot; is used, heck even the ugly invariant sections  are made impossible as they must be listed with the license. But if we accept &quot;Secondary Section&quot;  ans every linked page that has to do with the title and is evident that that particular &quot;Secondary Section&quot; gives a list o copyright holders not only to authors but from works that where merged.&lt;br&gt;
:But my point is that a list exist on the GFDL, even if you consider not to be that particular list. So you are plainly wrong.
:Again you must use the US law definition of author as there isn't a redefinition on the GFDL, those who spellcheck are not authors under any law (not mine nor the US law), and yes the &quot;history&quot; section is preserved in wikibooks so a correct list of authors can be asserted.--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 16:29, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

&lt;nowiki&gt;
Your misuse of the GFDL to justify ownership of this book is truly appaling.
&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:Don't put words on my mouth, I don't claim ownership of the work the GFDL prevents me of doing that, I claim creative control (here) and a place on authors list and refuse to grant that same rights to anyone that doesn't contribute content to the work as an author. We could even conceive that is if a list of authors in a book is adulterated by someone that is not an author, legal action could be lunched against him (the non author) and the publisher (wikimedia) as he will be violating the copyright law by claiming authorship of a work he didn't produce.

We don't have a lot of policy pages on wikibooks that apply to your behavior here (this is the first case I personally have seen where they would come in handy), but on en.wp your actions here would fal under [[w:WP:OWN|WP:OWN]] and [[w:WP:WL|WP:WL]]. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 10:34, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

The author's page, like the to-do list and other pages often appended to large books don't need to be printed or copied onto printed versions or forks. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:07, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

=== Comment by [[User:Whiteknight]] ===

I've been trying to keep away from this discussion for some time now, but I have been specially invited by [[User:Panic2k4]] to give some opinions on this matter. First off, I'm reasonably sure that the version of the GFDL in use here at wikibooks is located at [[GFDL]]. Outside versions of the license, and new revisions of that license are (as is my understanding) not the versions that should be invoked here. I may be wrong on that point, but luckily I don't think different versions of the license make much difference in this matter.

To the matter at hand: There is no official distinction between contributors in a page, but it is my opinion that certain people rise above the crowd in terms of contributions and dedication to a particular project. I refer to these people as &quot;primary contributors&quot;. I would like to note here specifically that the term &quot;primary contributors&quot; is a slippery topic, and I will refuse to define it nor quantify it in any way at this time. Wikibooks grants a large amount of latitude to the first person who creates a book: That person can mandate the naming scheme, the navigational structure, the scope, the target audience, etc of the book. Once the book has been created and is established, frequently there is left only one or two dedicated editors whos contributions make up the majority of all contributions to that book (the &quot;vast majority&quot;, not 50% majority). These users, by virtue  of being both dedicated and unopposed in making decisions, again have a large amount of freedom to do with the book as they please. This only extends so far as the primary contributor is unopposed in making such decisions. If a new user comes to the book and begins making contributions and making decisions, then neither user can act unilaterally, and [[Wikibooks:Decision making|Decision making rules]] must be followed to guide the direction of the book.

In this case, as is my understanding, [[User:Panic2k4]] has been a &quot;primary contributor&quot; to this book for some time, and has had nearly unilateral control in the direction of the book (or at least parts of the book) for some time now. [[User:darklama]] is a relative newcomer who made some changes to the book that panic did not necessarily agree with. In this situation, neither user has unilateral control of the book (Panic2k4 is no longer unopposed in making decisions). In this situation, decisions regarding the direction of this book need to be made ''by concensus'' between the active authors of this book (Panic and Darklama). When there are only 2 people, &quot;concensus&quot; can only really be obtained through agreement of both authors (50%, or a 1-1 tie is not &quot;consensus&quot;, ever). Changes to the following facets of the book then require agreement from both members, or they should not be made:
*Changes in the scope of the book (material that is or is not included)
*Changes in the voice or the target audience (Changes to the level of presented material, the difficulty, the use of language, etc)
*Changes in the navigational structure of the book (page moves, page deletions, new navigational templates, edits to existing navigational templates)
The addition of new material, or alterations to the existing material by either member, so long as they don't alter the book in one of the ways I have listed above are acceptable, and don't require agreement from both members. Should an edit war or a wheel war occur from such changes, then agreement must be reached. 

These are just my opinions, take them for what they are worth. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:40, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

To Clarify: [[User:darklama]] should have consulted Panic before deleting content, changing the book structure, and moving pages. However, Panic doesnt get a &quot;veto&quot; on the contributions of other authors, but he does get equal say. Again, if there are only two people in the discussion, both people are going to need to agree on all substantial changes before they can be made. The addition of content can be done by either author, but the deletion of content (especially if it was written by the other author) should not be performed without agreement. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:59, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

::Humm so in a 1:1 stand off you say that if no agreement is reacher the status quo is to be kept ?
::And the use of the word author do you recognize its definition as in the GFDL (as difened on the copyright law) or any edit grants that status (in violation of copyright law)?
::You seem to share [[User:darklama]] that any kind of contribution to a work does provide a place in decisions regarding its evolution, that can be extrapulated from the rules that are defined on wikibooks but it was not my understanding and I claim that it could be dangerous, I can implement a proof of concept that will show just that, without breaking any rules that are in place at the moment, by using other users as ghosts or even taking the time to surround me with allies I could turn any vote in favor of a particular view... --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 22:16, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

:::I do agree that any active, well-meaning users should get a say in the direction of the books in which they are active. I say this because people who have had few contributions in the past may very well grow to become leading contributors in the future. New contributors are allowed to be part of the editorial process, and I would remind you that it is official policy that we don't bite the newcomers. Saying that new editors are not &quot;part of the community&quot;, and that they are not allowed to edit a book certainly seems like biteing to me.

::::Well in my view wikibooks are communities inside communities, contributors all are part of the general community but people that submit content (by definition authors as stated by the copyright law should be the ones on a specific book community and have a prevalent say, it is my view that allowing a non author to be named as author of a book and signing as one is an infringement of the GFDL and my personal rights if I'm one of the authors as it erodes my contribution to a work)--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 23:12, 9 October 2006 (UTC)
 
:::In a 1-1 standoff, there is no concensus, and the status quo is kept. In this type of system, making drastic changes to a book (which it seems you dont want anyway) is more difficult.)
 
:::I also am trying not to use the word &quot;author&quot;, but instead generalize to use the word &quot;contributor&quot;. Whether you are an &quot;author&quot; or not according to this license or that copyright law is insignificant to me: you are a contributor, and darklama is a contributor.

::::Do you recognize authorship of a work to any contributor ? (as allowing its name to be placed on the book as author, this part has noting to do with communities but general rights).--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 23:12, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

:::According to [[Wikibooks:Decision making]], the use of clones is not allowed for making decisions. If you want to make a change, instead of trying to overpower your opponent, you are encouraged to discuss and reach compromise. You can't always get everything your way, and sometimes you need to give a little to get a little. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 22:51, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

:::: This can be easily be circumvented (but by being a dick as [[User:SBJohnny]] colorfully puts it) and is in fact impossible to police, even the simple example of alliances with other users would do it.--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 23:12, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

:::::I am not saying whether darklama is an author or not. I am saying, however, that he is a contributor. The two terms are different, and I am only going to talk about the latter. If you insist on talking about authors, then we are comparing apples and oranges, and this discussion has reached a standstill. 
:::::As to your second point, It is irrelevant whether I recognize &quot;authors&quot;, because the legal distinctions about that are already well-defined in the GFDL and relevant legal texts on the subject. If people are listing their names in the book in a method extraneous to the page history, then those listings fall in the domain of &quot;page content&quot;, and the page content can be decided upon by the contributors to the book. 
:::::And to your third point, [[Wikibooks:Decision making]] is a very general policy, but the text of it was drafted to prevent circumvention. The idea behind the decisionmaking policy is that the quality of an argument is far more important then the quantity of the arguments. If you have a network of clones, or if you have a weak alliance, it is unlikely that the arguments of the many will be any more provocative. Notice also that [[Wikibooks:Decision making]] disallows the use of majority voting, so large amounts of allies can't force a decision to be made: an effort must be made to appease the dissenters, if any. This is &quot;impossible to police&quot;, but since it is site policy, it is unwise to ignore it. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:37, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

''(reset tabs)'' -- I see your points  but it seems I'm not the only working on a vacuum the contributors and authors mess created by the wiki framework and a confusing statement of the law, we in wikibooks need a clear policy that will clear all the points we don't see eye to eye in, a simple search on google (http://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Aen.wikibooks.org%20authors) proves my point, we can even take the extreme that is the [[:Wikijunior_Solar_System/Authors]] and a myriad of interpretation and spooling of guidelines and rules, I will try to create one (or more) policy proposals with the bases we have discussed here.--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 23:55, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

:A policy proposal on this topic would certainly help matters, I think, but proposals are a can of worms. Getting people to discuss a proposal, and getting people to agree on a proposal are very difficult tasks, and consume alot of time. I will certainly help you draft such a proposal if you want. 
:My advice to you in this time, if you care to heed it, is to find a way to see darklama as an ally, not an enemy. Both of you are active, and both of you want the C++ book to improve, even if you both have different ideas about how that improvement should take place. I had asked darklama to take some time to back away and cool off, and he respectfully has followed that suggestion. Everyone knows that you have contributed alot to that book, your name is all over the page histories, so I wouldn't worry too much about your attribution as a valuable contributor. However, there was a time when you were new to this project, and you have gradually grown to reach the position that you are at now. You wouldn't have had many contributions if everything you wrote was reverted. Because your contributions were not reverted when you were new, I ask that you don't revert darklama's contributions now either.
:I understand all your objections, and I know the frustration that you must have felt. There are a number of books that I am the primary contributor on, and I can be a little protective when people start making lots of changes without discussing them. I would like to see this situation be resolved, and I would like to see you and darklama work together to improve our C++ book. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:08, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

=== Comments by [[User:Swift]] ===

I've been sitting on the sidelines reading through this as it has been coming in, gathering my thoughs and debating whether to join this little bag of fun. Since I find it difficult to respond to Panic's request for comments on my talk page in the discussion above, I'll state some of my views on the matter here.

&lt;small&gt;Please add your comments at the bottom of mine since in-the-middle comments makes the discussion hard for others to follow and join (this isn't quite email). For context, simply quote the relevant sections.&lt;/small&gt;

; Author status and weight of contributors
An important thing to remember is that when you modify a Wikibook, you become the author of it (the so called Modified Version). Essentially, Panic is the author of [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=C%2B%2B_Programming&amp;oldid=596843 this version] while Darklama is the author of [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=C%2B%2B_Programming&amp;direction=next&amp;oldid=596843 this one] (65.91.254.98 is then the author of [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=C%2B%2B_Programming&amp;direction=next&amp;oldid=602186 the current one]) as of this writing. Wikibooks is simply a &quot;temporally linearized fork repository&quot; &amp;mdash; each version is preserved in the history along with a list of past contributions on which the work is based on with the most recent version presented as the ''Wikibook'' module.

No author has ''any'' rights to future revisions. As the GFDL does not restrict authors of Modified Versions to consult the Document authors or principle authors on how he wishes to modify it, this would allow for trolling, spamming, vandalising etc. (if done within the restrictions of the GFDL). Wikibooks policies, guidelines and accpeted behaviour are an added layer on top of this to create a productive working environment for a community of interested partners.

So far the Wikibooks community has opted for consensus rather than giving established contributors greater weight in decision making. A common reasoning being that any disagreement should be settled by the quality of the arguements for each view, not the amount of material that an editor has contributed.

; Author pages and authors vs. contributors
The [http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html GFDL] states that Modified Versions must...
&lt;blockquote&gt;B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As the GFDL applies to any medium, this indicates that the Title Page must have the name of the most recent contributor (even if this was only minor spell checking) along with up to five of the principle authors. I could not find a definition for &quot;principle author&quot; so this becomes a slippery little sucker.

Furthermore, given that this electronic forum doesn't really have conventional &quot;title pages&quot; I'm not quite sure how to implement this. Personally, I like SB Johnny's understanding of the author list as a project members list. Those who consider themselves active contributors to the Wikibook rather than occational contributors may sign themselves on those lists at their own discretion. This may be more of a sign of intent than past contributions.

Also, this doesn't really fit well to the method of writing Wikibooks since it is all done on page basis and not in complete page form. I can see the page history as an accpeptible solution to this which I don't think GNUs would object to harshly as long as print-like versions adhere to it.

I'm reluctant to comment further on the Author pages. I'd advise everyone to evalueate their priorities to see if this is really the most important topic to invest their time in. If not, move on with more pressing matters. If someone is really a trivial editor, his mentioning can always be removed later. Remember people, there is never any need for urgency in editing these books. Any version can be reverted to.

; Book community
I agree that the book community should have a certain amount of &quot;sovereignty&quot; in matters dealing with the development of the book. Issues to this extent, such as book specific manuals of style, have been discussed in the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]]. The wiki premise, however, allows anyone to join this community and contribute.

Panic stated in [[#Panic point of view]] that &quot;''It is his opinion that if any one has the same decision rights, a book will stall, generate needless discussions [...] and only generate chaos without producing content''&quot;. Well, experience shows otherwise. With policies like [[Wikibooks:Be civil]] and [[Wikibooks:Assume good faith]] and a common interest in a successful outcome, wiki communities have been able to overcome differences and settle disputes. These same objections were raised against Wikipedia in its rise by its detractors. Granted; a single example won't prove a case, Wikipedia is young and still in active growth so the ultimate verdict isn't in yet, and there are notable differences between the two venues. Still, the concept of a consensus based community has withstood some pretty difficult tests and in that process assumed certain rules of behaviour to ensure cooperation. We will be wise to learn from those lessons.

; Consensus
The last concrete item that I can weed out of the statement of views sections is the matter of decision making. Though entwined with the subjects already discussed, it is important enough that I want to elaborate on it seperately. And important matters deserve brevity:

The decision making process has nothing to do with the GFDL. It falls under the practices of the Wikibooks community. The current practice is to seek consensus through argument based debates. In that, quality of arguments, not seniority, is paramount.

; Summary
Essentially, the important distinction that I find that needs to be made is that between the GFDL and the Wikibooks community. The former determines how to accredit past contributions, while the latter how to organize future work.

The GFDL is out of our hands, but we can mold the Wikibooks [[WB:PAG|Best Current Practices]] to our needs. Again; [[Wikibooks:Be civil]], [[Wikibooks:Assume good faith]] and a commitment to achieve progress through consensus have served us well in the past and, I believe, will continue to do so in the future. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 08:16, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

*8. Relevance isn't derived from your location.
*9. Technology is the means, not the end.
*10. Quality comes from experience and constant improvement.
*11. Relevance is what the reader is searching for to expand his own knowledge.
*12. Learning from others is the key to success.

= You are blocked, again. =

You have been blocked from editing for 2 weeks, for among other things [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ADarklama&amp;diff=680794&amp;oldid=680734 this comment], and more specifically for saying &quot;I did not demand, I gave him a time frame to complete it&quot;. 

You are not in a position to assign time frames. This is a wiki, and we work ''together'' to create content. We do not work because someone said it was OK to do so. 

Should you choose to rejoin the project after two weeks, please keep in mind that the next block will be even longer... the only reason I refrained from making it an indefinite block is because of your long history here and your obvious desire to make a good C++ book. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:11, 10 December 2006 (UTC)



== Yet another warning, and a response ==
Don't be paranoid, it's unbecoming. We might discuss you from time to time on &quot;other channels&quot;, but the decision to block you was mine and mine alone. The IRC channel is free to all, BTW, and the only administrator I talk to on the phone is not particularly interested in discussing this... you are not the most pressing issue in our lives, or on wikibooks for that matter. 

: ''&quot;Ah... don't forget there's a lot discussed on the IRC channel too (I prefer realtime discussion to talk pages).&quot;''

: I'm not paranoid, you implied that you were discussing on another channel, I only said that I really can't see that as positive since the only involved parties on the debate we are having is you and me...

Wikibooks is a community that writes books. The GFDL is the licence we use, not the definition of our community. As far as your rights under the GFDL, they will be protected even if I or someone else blocks you indefinitely... it's apples and oranges (&quot;apples and oranges&quot; means &quot;two completely different things&quot;... let me know if I'm using unfamiliar idioms).

: Herr, I disagree the GFDL (with limitations) is the bases of the community all else stands on top of it, it is not the &quot;definition&quot; but it's the root from what everything else must evolve from. I strongly disagree that it is like apples and oranges, it is more like trying to build a roof before you have walls. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 04:16, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

There are a lot of &quot;implied&quot; rules on wikibooks that everyone else seems to understand well enough. 

: &quot;Implied&quot; rules are bad and are open for personal interpretations and abuse, if one seeks to have any rules they must be written down and open to public scrutiny, last time I checked we didn't have a secret handshake, herr do we ? --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 04:16, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

Darklama knows quite well how &quot;stuff&quot; works around here. And I'm &quot;picking on you&quot; because you requested moderation. I gave you the benefit of the doubt with Darklama, but when you started doing the same to another contributor the day he arrived, you gave up your benefit of the doubt.

: Humm well I regret that you fell that by &quot;picking on me&quot; you are moderating the discussion, it would be better if you just enforced the rules we have (or tried to prove that I'm wrong or I'm acting badly) lets examine your first post on this problem again...

'''Comment by [[User:SBJohnny]]'''

I've been watching this with some concern, and I'm afraid Panic is getting out of hand at this point. You write:

:&quot;''I, at this moment, will not recognize you as part of the C++ Programming community, as in author or by having contributed content to the book, I recognize and value your work in correcting spelling, the motivation of trying to change the words of phrases so it could be easier to understand to beginners and a will to try to better the work nothing more.''&quot;

When it seems that you have in the past &quot;shot down&quot; any changes darklama wants to make. Going by this approach, you would be the only &quot;recognised author&quot; here, and can simply make sure it stays that way be repeatedly reverting another contributor's edits.

Your interpretation of the GFDL is deeply mistaken: the GFDL has nothing to say about &quot;author lists&quot; or disputes between authors, except that all authors (including those who spellcheck, etc.) are credited in any copy made of this book on another project or in print (in the edit histories of each page). Your misuse of the GFDL to justify ownership of this book is truly appaling.

We don't have a lot of policy pages on wikibooks that apply to your behavior here (this is the first case I personally have seen where they would come in handy), but on en.wp your actions here would fal under [[w:WP:OWN|WP:OWN]] and [[w:WP:WL|WP:WL]]. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 10:34, 9 October 2006 (UTC)
&lt;/div&gt;

:#''Concern'' and ''out of hand'' demonstrates that you are from the start refuting that I'm in good faith and saying that I'm abusive, which is false.
:#My phrase can be considered a bit aggressive here but it was after a bit of other posting between me and darklama and I still consider it valid, since darklama did star to change format without contributing to the text book. These are against the &quot;written&quot; rules and you took no action to correct it, not then not ever, even after a dispute was evident. (btw I don't contest any addition of content to the book done by darklama, I can't remember one but by now he must have written a few lines).
:#You refer that I have herr &quot;shot down&quot; any changes, that is correct and on the point it is my right to contest changes to the book I'm working on, it is your &quot;job&quot; as administrator that failing to obtain a consensus, things remain as before the dispute arose (notice that I didn't revert any changes, or moved pages back), so the rest of your point is not correct.
:#It seems by now if not completely correct my interpretation of the GFDL is better than yours, it is now proven and debated (see WB:OWN that the GFDL does indeed refer to &quot;author lists&quot;) more you could also check the lines it defines derivative work but I will do it later as the OWN still misses the author definition). As for the rest, I hoped that you should have gotten this by now, ''I do not and never did claim control on any book'' (even more using GFDL to support a similar claim is just nonsense)
:#My behavior up to this time has been clear, non destructive and I claim, not even obstructive to the Wikibooks project, if you can base you accusations you should do so), by using vague terms and personal interpretation you are always failing to provide me a base to contest/correct and to advance the discussion over any misconception you or I may have. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 04:16, 30 December 2006 (UTC)   

Forking is not a problem (the GFDL is, essentially, a guarantee of the right to fork). Forking ''is'' a problem on wikibooks, because there's a long-standing consensus that there shouldn't be 2 books on one topic without good reason, and your inability to collabotate is not a good reason. What's the point of doing this on a wiki if not to collaborate?

: I don't agree, forking is not a problem not even on Wikibooks (do you want me to define what forking is?) as I said before forking using the GFDL is very good and productive, content is provided and it should increase the rate of contribution if both projects are really evolving as it fosters competition, it gives freedom to the authors and later on, the community can do what it likes without forcing views or preferences on the contributors, the books will exist long after the authors/contributors are gone.
: And as I said before and this is an important point, ''&quot;strangely enough after the fork the previous version stagnated and only my fork evolved&quot;'', this should settle any more references to the problem that I had with Paddu (it is similar to the actual one but not the same and a solution was found by doing the fork as a last resort) this is not the problem we are addressing now and to me is closed and resolved, if Paddu still needs any satisfaction or feels that it was treated wrongly as you state, I'll be happy now, to spend all the time he wants on that topic. I have said that at that time to him and it is still true, that I hate to debate every point or be dragged to this sort of discussions. I now seem unable to avoid, not only to defend my POV, but the work I have done and even the future of Wikibooks, so I have now created some time to address this issues. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 04:16, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

Panic, your practice of moving around and reorganizing talk pages makes it rather difficult to look into the history. Your are not my full time job.

: There are more administrators that could help if you feel it is that important, I see the matter of the fork and even the ''forced'' merge closed, I have and even Paddu have some grievances not with each other (at least I don't have regarding him, as I'm almost on is shoes now)  but by the ways the subject was treated at the time by the Wikibooks community and I with the administrator that ''forced'' the merge. But if you really need more info I can try to dig it out. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 04:16, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

There are other books that have communities around them (the cookbook being a prime example, but also wikijunior, the muggles guide, etc.). They didn't need policies or guidelines, just the implicit policy of collaboration, cooperation, and fellowship that comes naturally to a project where &quot;anyone can edit&quot;. You don't collaborate, you impose. You don't cooperate, you argue. You treat your fellow contributors badly, and then point out proudly that you didn't just revert their contributions as &quot;spam&quot; (I take it you actually mean vandalism?)

: There isn't a book community in the sense that they are not defined nor have the proper bases to reduce the scope of participation on decision that only and directly affect them (I think this should be stated in a policy), as I said before and I will say again ''implicit'' policies are bad, people aren't mind readers and probably just don't care to get the &quot;feel&quot; or &quot;mindset&quot; of the community as a whole, I didn't and that has caused me much trouble, my first intention was doing one or more books, not be involved in debates nor policy building.
: Can you concretely state an instance that I have herr &quot;impose&quot;d my edit over anyone? That would help, txs...
: if you understand that [cooperate == submit and go along with the flow] and [argue == defend my POV, where I or the work I've done here is involved] then expect less cooperation and more argues, if the rules for decisions here are to be trusted I can object to anything I don't agree to and I will do just that.
: As for collaboration I have no problem with it, I have been collaborating with many users for  most of the time I've spent here, if you wish to make a point do it...
: You probably misunderstood the problem with the other user, I will copy form the other talk page just to same my time and yours...

&lt;div style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black;&quot;&gt;
''part of the post I made in WB:OWN in 19:26, 28 December 2006 (UTC)''
The problem with the other user and the reason you blocked me and I again say '''wrongly''' doesn't have directly to do with reformatting or big changes, the problem was that the user in question made some changes that corrupted the logic of the text on that particular page, I recognized that the user was participating on the book (for some time) and did not want to interpret is actions as &quot;spam&quot; and asked him to correct the problem in a time frame or I would do it. (The validity or imposition is like saying to you; please call me in 10 minutes or I'll call you back), for this I was blocked for 2 weeks. (Well I was blocked twice for the same event)

''« You shouldn't try to impose &quot;deadlines&quot; on your fellow contributors. You are an equal partner, not a &quot;chief editor&quot; »'''

*Under no active policy is giving a user a time frame to complete an action before one takes action/reaction a violation... 

If you had done some group work or had a need to synchronize stuff under a collaborative framework (probably I as a programmer know this more that you) you need a way to check if you have control of a structure before you make changes to it.

The problem is bigger yet as the blocking action resulted on the [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ADarklama&amp;diff=680794&amp;oldid=680734 monitor of a different conversation (on another unrelated user page) were I was explaining this problem], this violates my freedom of expression and even if your interpretation was correct, my point of view had the same value as yours, since I was talking to a third party on a private page, that is, by your action any person that disagrees with any policy can't talk about it or express the wish for changes (not the problem here but the final result is that).

Policies exists to be challenged and updated and express the community views on it and as it stands not even a majority has control on general policies. Users are all equal, you personal views, even if divergent from mine shouldn't influence your actions as an administrator.

More I have been an active contributor and participative on votes, policy creation/building and in the community in general, by being blocked I did not only become unable to continue working on the books I normally do, but could not express my vote on other subjects, and [[User:Darklama|Darklama]] took that chance to impose his views on the book in question, the other user changed my signed posts on the talk page, etc...
&lt;/div&gt;

: If you can please address those points... --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 04:16, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

You know Panic, I'd take your position on the &quot;Author's Page&quot; more seriously if you bothered to name the other authors. Last time I saw it, it was &quot;Panic, and others...&quot;, which as far as I'm concerned was/is a rather more serious GFDL violation.

: The insertion of ones name/alias as a book authors is defined on the GFDL no author should be included against their will, I have respected the GFDL. I can assure you that to my best knowledge this is not a violation, the (not seen) request (see source) could be a violation of other authors rights and is not based in any active policy on Wikibooks (at least not until book communities are defined), but that is another can of worm. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 04:16, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

: I try to expect that you and Darklama are really working in good faith but the list of problems just keeps accumulating.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 17:57, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

If you want to give people weblinks to the book, you'll either have to deal with the fact that it might be under construction, or just copy it to another site and give them that link instead...the GFDL gives you the right to do just that. Maybe some of the people you gave the links to will eventually come here and work on the book a bit, and if they do, I'll make sure that their contributions are welcomed and respected...even if that means blocking you again.

: At this point in time I couldn't in good faith point Wikibooks for any constructive work and I would probably refrain to place it in evidence (I'm not obliged to do it, see Wikibooks GFDL Limitations) or to even point to Wikibooks. I sincerely hope that this discussion and the policies that are in the works would change my view, but if I don't feel good working on books as this are so I don't think that I would indicate it to anyone (at this point). --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 04:16, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

:You are incorrect, you have so far failed to correct any action that violated the GFDL and were pointed out by me, or tried to force darklame and me to reach a consensus or even expressed you opinion even om behalf of darklama point of view (I even pointed out that consensus obtained on this bases are problematic).

::Where, exactly, did he violate the GFDL?

::: Again ? see that page logs (print version of the herr alternative TOC) --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 17:57, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

You seem to see consensus as &quot;your way&quot;. You might want to consider the possibility that since everyone seems to disagree with you, you might not be completely in the right.

:No I don't see consensus on my side, it is sufficient to have you in disagreement with me to have that clear, but that doesn't resolve the situation as stated in the policies in case off failing to reach a consensus the status quo (before the changes under dispute) should be protected.

:It is clear to me and should be to you that at least before the last changes darklama made to the book taking advantage of the block (I was expecting better from him), I and him were resolving the problems mostly OK (with some pending issues) until you intervened on a complete unrelated point and wrongly so, and you probably know it. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 17:57, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

You were blocked for the same reason in both cases: insisting that it is your right to tell others what to do. If you want to be welcomed and listened to as a member of the community, you're going to have to get over yourself and assume both the good faith and the competence of your fellows. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:03, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

: Try to read the above transcript on that point (the blocking), as for the welcome I sincerely don't particularly need and don't have time to build a contact network here (I know it makes life easier but that should not be a requirement to be able to work here) as for the to be listened part, it only suffices to have an account to have a voice. The good faith I had in you and darklama after the last actions it is running very low.--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 04:16, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

The only way it's going to get resolved is if you talk to your fellow contributors, ''addressing them as equals''. If you are unable to do that, then staying out of it is probably a good idea. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:30, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

= C++ Wikibook and other related issues =

I will admit that I didn't get involved with the decision making process of the C++ fork/merger that happened.  In some ways, I felt kinda pushed to the side and didn't want to get caught in the middle of a brawl that I knew instinctively was going to get ugly before it got resolved.

: I share your views, I don't particularly like to be involved in discussions and I'm only doing so because the same thing seems to happen time and time again, against policies or without them, based only in personal interpretations and leaving no solution opened to the normal user. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 01:43, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

BTW, I think you had some valid points in the discussions, and perhaps I should have taken a stronger interest in what was going on.

: Well I may have expressed something in not the exact way I intended to, but most of my action are with good intentions I refute any and all accusations to the contrary, it was my respect for Paddu POV and even lets call it by their right names here, editorial control he was not contributing to the book at the time (content) but he did write some at the beginning so my action that lead to the creation of another book on C++ was mostly a result of the inability for Paddu to compromise with my POV an no moderation came to clarify thing, I was relatively new at Wikibooks and as I said before I never contributed directly to Wikipedia, the solution at the time solved the problem, didn't break any existing rules and did enable me to continue to provide content on a book that was  as continued stale.--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 01:43, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

I do hold that the GFDL in this situation (particularly for forking policies and such) is irrelevant and damaging to the conversation.  This has nothing to do with the GFDL, but instead is about a surprisingly arbitrary &quot;forking policy&quot; that exists here on Wikibooks.  And for the record, this is one that I don't agree with 100%, particularly as I do believe that you can write some very substantially different &quot;books&quot; about the same topic.  You can still maintain an NPOV but writing from two different (or more) approaches to the topic.  This is indeed why most scholarly papers require multiple sources, because there isn't always one way to approach a topic to completely understand it.

: I don't think it is irrelevant, there are thing one must comply to, like naming the original work (I see many page moves between book that fail to do even that), this is a imposition of the GFDL, and the GFDL lets us as a community after the &quot;forks&quot; or other similar work are created to merge them in the future without conflict if they stop to evolve. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 01:43, 31 December 2006 (UTC) 

As it is, I'm getting ready to fork one particular Wikibooks precisely because there is a very different viewpoint and attitude toward how to approach the topic ([[AP Computer Science]]) than what the main group of authors want to do with it.  Imagine, forking a stub.....

: I believe that this should be acceptable, it may be confusing to the readers but some rules can be crafted that would reduce it, the ratio of readers and authors is very unbalanced, we should  foster author in any case. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 01:43, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

You and I aren't really as far apart on these issues as you seemed to try and indicate on [[Wikibooks talk:Ownership]].  And you are completely correct that Wikipedia and Wikibooks are two very different sorts of projects where the rationale for doing things on Wikipedia doesn't always seem to apply here.

: I think we are in accord in the major points, one the ones that I don't agree strongly is anonymous authors and the need to protect authors moral right but a clear fork policy would solve the later. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 01:43, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

I would also like to point to a discussion I had some time ago on [[Talk:Serial Programming#related Wikibooks]] where I got into a heated discussion by one user who thought I was exerting too much editorial control over a book I started and created.  In some ways I think that book writing really is restricted to just a small handful of people who have some sort of demon inside of them that demands that the book be written.  This is precisely why Wikibooks has a much smaller community than Wikipedia, IMHO.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 21:45, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

I merely fixed what I considered to be damage that you have caused by trying to force a rigged and unnatural method from which discussions normally take place and others people seem to welcome the changes. You may have the right to make changes and voice your opinion, but as you seem to keep forgetting, you don't have the right to prevent others from contributing changes and continiousally attempting to do things in an attempt to have your way with everything. Everyone is not simply editors working under your approval. You have not given me any reason to expect better than this from you. Your actions seem to always be an attempt to delay any progress that could be made and a constant attempt to get everyone nowhere. I agree with both SB_Johnny's previous decisions and current decision to block you.

: To fix something something must be broken, it is my view that it wasn't, it is your right to propose changes (not impose them) besides that point the structures that you seem to disagree with weren't created by me, with my agreement it was an imposition of an adminitrator at the time of the merge, I merely continue its use and have extended it a little bit... but I don't see the changes you made as a better solution and you knew that.

May I suggest that we get at least one neutral arbitrator (not from the arbitrators from [[w:WP:RFAR]] as they are too busy) in here from Wikipedia?

Panic, you are blocked because you started moving talk pages around (actually it was more like &quot;re-moving&quot; them), as you were warned not to do. I left notice of the block on [[WB:AN]] and on Robert's page, so everyone knows. You'll have your review, and I'll abide by any decision made by the next arbitrator. I'm not happy about this either, but until another arbitrator steps up, we're stuck with each other. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:47, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

Alright, I think everyone needs to take a break for the evening so that people don't write angrily.

I've largely stayed out of this fight, and for now, I'm willing to act as a mediator if you, Panic, are willing to have me review this situation.  I'm willing to try and dig up a few otherwise neutral admins to act as a &quot;tribunal&quot; if you don't want to have me do this explicitly.

Unfortunately it has gone to this point where a very formal procedure must be invoked to get this to work out, and that means essentially all of the BS that involves something akin to a court trial or arbitration case on Wikipedia.  While there is no &quot;policy&quot; on doing this, I think we have reached the point that this is going to establish a preceedent here on Wikibooks on how to resolve these seemingly intractable problems.

If you don't like the decision that we have made after this whole process, you are certainly free to send it up for &quot;appeal&quot; to the WMF board of trustees or a group of stewards for final review.  In the past, [[User:Jimbo Wales]] has usually been the ultimate authority in situations like this.  Trust me when I say this, but you don't want that to happen except as a very last resort, Panic.  Don't force this issue that far, as you are very likely to lose and be permaently blocked from all Wikimedia projects.

What I'm suggesting here is that a full airing of all of the issues be brought out, including by those who have become involved.  Be very specific and explicit.  While I've seen some talk about this, the &quot;warnings&quot; listed above are not IMHO sufficient information to really come to a conclusion about what has happened.

It should also be noted that this is going to take some time to completely air all of the issues out, including a forum for Panic here to offer rebuttals.  What I don't want to see happen here is a drag out mess that will not see an end.  Here is my strong suggestion, and invoking my administrator hat, I may even force it here:

There will be a four part discussion/airing of the issues.  Those discussions will happen in the following format:

#Plaintiff charges of improper conduct on the part of Panic with regards to Wikibooks.  Be very specific and cite examples.  Since [[User:SB Johnny]] has gone through the effort to perform the user block, I'm going to encourage him and those who feel the same way that Panic has been abusive on Wikibooks to join into that discussion.  Panic is not allowed to comment directly on the pages where these &quot;charges&quot; are found.
#Defendant reply.  Panic is invited to respond to the charges and try to explain his position, and defend his actions on Wikibooks.  This is not intended to be a free-for-all discussion, but rather a clear defense situation that only those who are sympathetic to Panic are generally permitted to add content with this reply.
#Plaintiff rebuttal. - This is a response to the discussion done by the defendant.
#Defendant rebuttal. - A final thought and word by the defendant.

Each of these steps will happen in successive order.  Generally speaking, they shouldn't last more than a few days each, but I'm willing to extend them a few days, particularly giving the defendant the benefit of the doubt.  The whole point of formalizing this is to avoid the 16-level deep intented discussions commonly found on places like the VfD pages, and to give a chance to air out all of the issues in a calm manner.

Until one step has been completed, the next step can't begin.

When all of this is done, a similar series of discussions will occur regarding what sorts of actions ought to be done, including perhaps as Panic has said, the deadmining of SB Johnny.  We can air out that issue within Wikibooks, but it certainly may be something in this case.  Or you, Panic, may be permanetly blocked from Wikibooks including sock puppets.

If you don't want to get this formal, fine.  But at that point I can wash my hands of this whole thing.  And I promise to everybody involved that this is going to get ugly unless we do a formal process like this.  In addition, if this process isn't done properly, people from outside of Wikibooks will decide our fate.  I don't want that, and I certainly hope that you, Panic, don't want to see that happen either.  While I can't &quot;force&quot; this to happen, I hope this will be a reasonable solution before we block your account permanently.  I don't want to do that, nor do I think most of those involved here with Wikibooks want to see that either.  

I've started an arbitration page for Wikibooks here:  [[Wikibooks:Arbitration]]

Obviously for now, Panic is going to be restricted to this user talk page.  I'm willing to even &quot;unblock&quot; you if you promise to keep a comparatively low profile for the next couple of weeks and not try to edit in pages that are currently under conflict.  Let's try to cool down the pot and try to see exactly what has been going on.  This can be rationally done, and the reason why I've listed the steps is to let you know how I would be willing to moderate this issue.  I know this isn't policy, but please try to follow this process, as I think it will help everybody involved, including yourself.  

The next step is yours, Panic.  Do you acccept this procedure for mediation, or do we take it up to the next level?  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 18:38, 4 January 2007 (UTC)
----
I agree that doing that would probably resolve for a time any misconception, wrong doing, policy violations and other things that has been performed or acted upon by me and others involved,.

But your proposal is in my view excessive and overcomplicated, and will probably not address the problem in the table and take too long, and basically we don't have no written policies or guidelines to some of the previous issues, but I'm wiling to get into a similar procedure as described if we (as in me and [[User:SBJohnny]]) agree in a by point decision on the various problems.

The problem that must be address now is:
# Was this a valid block ?
*Who? - [[User:SBJohnny]] and [[User:Panic2k4]])
*How? - [[User:SBJohnny]] blocked [[User:Panic2k4]], [[User:Panic2k4]] also indicates that the block reason was not properly stated to him at the time and on the block log registry. 
*Why? - User [[User:SBJohnny]] alleges that in sequence of a previous warning not to do so, [[User:Panic2k4]] did perform a violation of policy or guideline, in specific by restoring pages to their previous locations due to changes made by another user, [[User:Panic2k4]] in sequence of the block requested that the same would be lifted, if [[User:SBJohnny]] doesn't provide a valid reason to justify his actions.

: No more no less there aren't any more involved parties, as they say [[User:SBJohnny]] has the ball.

: If [[User:SBJohnny]] is unable to justify his actions I don't see how complicating the problem will help.

: Any other standing problems should only be analyzed if used as a justification for the block, but I'm pretty sure that even the now present reason for the block and the existence of the warning would by themselves invalidate the block, the next problem to be addressed is my proposal to remove the users administrative rights and I can prove that as an administrator he should have performed better (maybe not to the point to remove his administrative flag, but at least for the cleanup of my blocking log and an admonition to him and probably some limitation to his involvement in blocking other users without a second administrator agreement, something on those lines), but this is not the time to debate those issues.

As for the block, if it is lifted I give my word that I will not not move or edit or in any way alter to the now indicated pages on that specific book namespace, but I ask that the other users are also requested for the same restrictions for the same amount of time, and that this time should be as short as possible. (This will of course have to include [[User:Darklama]] as he was the reason behind the restoration I performed). --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 19:30, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

:What I don't want to do is turn this into further wheel warring and worse.  Action has been taken here, and it is in part to resolve these actions that I want to go through this process.  I know this seems abusive and complicated, and some of this is to remind people that we are taking extraordinary steps here.  This is also to put you, Panic, on an equal footing with SB Johnny and not have to face an imbalance due to dealing with an administrator.

:I'll try to make the appropriate announcements at various places to let people in general know what is going on.

:I think that this whole process is going to set a very bad precedent, and the longer I think about it, the angrier I become. The fact is that an administrator (a long-time, trusted admin with a long record of being helpful) took action to solve a problem, and I don't think that we should get into the habit of second-guessing the decisions of our admins, especially if it isn't blatant abuse. What Johnny did was to block a problem user after multiple complaints, and multiple warnings. The dispute between Panic and Darklama has already been through an arbitration-like discussion process on this very talk page, and still Panic was unable or unwilling to collaborate. How many times to we need to dredge up the dirt? How many times to we need to make a decision on this? Johnny took the action that he thought appropriate, and Panic is lucky that Johnny did the blocking, because there are other admins here who would gladly have blocked Panic for a much longer span of time if they had to. I think that it is a bad precedent to second-guess our trusted admins (barring flagrant abuse, which this is not), and I also think it's a bad idea to drag out all our decisions into a long &quot;judicial&quot; process. Admins on wikibooks have traditionally been encouraged to be bold, and to take action for the betterment of the project. Johnny did this, and I dont think we should punish him for it. I would like to see this arbitration process ended, I would like to see Panic reblocked to serve out the rest of his term, or else warrned strongly that the next abuse on his part will lead to an infinite block from this project without hope of return. This whole process is a very bad idea, and I think it's going to get much more ugly then if we had stood by the original decision of the blocking admin. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:21, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

:: I don't think we should put such trust in administrators, like you seem to propose, since the rules to get the administrative rights at this moment are set &quot;to low&quot; as result of the lack of interested users (probably by the lack or experience and heavy use of unclear policies to define their action, I would like to be one at present, and there is a definition mistake most administrator aren't particularly interested in administrating the users, and most avoid actively to do so), for instance the other dispute I have with darklama (he is an administrator to) is on the simple interpretation of the GFDL (I think I have by now proven some point on that) and on the evolution of future policies (stuff that is not yet written but a significant part of the community seems to agree as it is a unwritten rule/policy, we have a collision of lets say interests). --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 00:57, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

:: I personally am getting involved on giving a more clear definition (other users should also) to the actual policies and in open dialog to get approval or an evolution on my POV, I'm sorry it is in my nature to give word and defend my ideals, most users prefer to avoid confusion and conflict, while  I don't like the later I will gladly get my hand dirty if the general community gets a benefit and in the long run it will. -[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 00:57, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

:: This block thing can be resolved and as I said is pretty easy, the blocking administrator is asked to provide validation for the block if he can't, it is removed (we aren't idiots here, if a clear warning was given like it is stated, I wouldn't have gone about blocking myself), as for the relations you establish and seem to use to justify the last block they aren't relevant, you can count on me to continue to put my finger where it hurts if I see something that should be improved/changed or deviated (I will not go after it actively but if I notice it I will point it out), what we do now will set a precedent (I already have done one of those, in the fork, sadly it didn't create nothing useful and it is still a time bomb we must defuse, but at least people are aware of it now) if it is bad or not will only depend on the community as a whole don't put that burden on me to. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 01:07, 5 January 2007 (UTC)


:::My point was that the issue already was resolved, there is no further resolution needed. You were blocked as a result of discussion and warning, and that is a resolution. That we have to suffer a whole arbitration process, and possibly the permanent establishment of a grand arbitration committee is considerably worse for the community then the loss of a single user who, through &quot;confusion and conflict&quot; has upset a number of people. &quot;Conflict&quot; is much less valuable in all respects then &quot;collaboration&quot; is. 
:::As to your last point, you were given a number of warnings about your behavior from a number of sources (myself included), that you chose to ignore. you were blocked because you continued your behavior in spite of those warnings.  --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 01:14, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

:::: I would like to point out that it was SB Johnny who notified me on my user talk page that this issue had even come up, and sought me out to help arbitrate this situation.  What is going on now is that I laid out some ground rules regarding how I would be willing to handle the situation if I was requested to step into the dispute.  I will also note that I have had a very difficult time trying to see specific points that everybody seems to be complaining about, which is another reason I have put together this arbitration in the current format.  Having avoided the C++ Programming Wikibooks completely with all of the issues that have surrounded it, I have been perhaps ignorant of all of the issues involved here.  Reading talk pages (even archived talk pages), looking over recent history edits and page move logs, I see at first glance on the part of Panic to be normal editing with the usual friction with people who all have large egos.  Now that was what I saw at first glance, but since Johnny certainly has been respected from my opinion as well, it seemed to be a drastic step to try and block this account.  Apparently the issues are qutie deep, but I want them aired out.  There is no way possible for an outside arbitrator like Anthere to come here and be able to sort this out if I can't do that.... knowing Wikibooks policies and trying to find out the background on this.

:::: BTW, I'm trying to also maintain some sembalence of impartiality here.  It is hardly easy given this context, and I have turned down requests that would have IMHO destroyed that impartiality.  I have tried to defend '''''why''''' I decided to lay down this course of action in this current format, but I'm trying hard not to comment on specifics here, or to form an opinion until all of the information is out in the open.  I'll also point out that one of the reasons why this whole thing is going on is in part because not everybody is 100% correct and 100% innocent for all that transpired.  Just like normal civil judicial proceedings, BTW.  I don't know how my uncle deals with all that BS, as he is a judge in California dealing with this stuff every day.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 20:15, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

I agree with you that over complicating thing will serve no purpose, I'll ask again to have [[User:SBJohnny]] present us the specific warning I broke, and to base the blocking in any policy, I will gladly suffer the block if it was supported on those bases or if it would benefit the community. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 01:29, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

Hi Panic. What I ''thought'' Robert was going to do was just take over for me in mediating between you and your fellow C++ editors. I'm not exactly sure what he has in mind now, though it seems a bit complicated. We'll see where it goes, eh? --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:49, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

: As I see it, he is addressing the disputed block, as you statements deal with a more complex sequence of events/actions as base for that last block, all your related actions will be reviewed as the ones I performed that you think were justification for the blocks.

: Since other users took the chance to also vent some of their views, it is my wish he/we would after be able to address the other users comments and the still existing disputes with me and Darklama so to speed thing up.

: I will address your views/declarations of the dispute after the closing of that part of the argumentation. If you have already stated you views on the block(s) subject please state as closed at end of your comment so he can pass the ball to me and I may reply. If you can ask directly or propose that Robert asks to the other users that placed supporting comments to close also, so thing may proceed.

: As the for the result it is my view that we may expect it to lead to at least the renewal of my block or even a permanent ban if my actions are perceived by him as granting such solution, on the other hand if I prove that you were in error I expect my block log to be clean and a proper action to be performed to you, I will not propose that your rights as an administrator to be taken as it is to hash and in general you do perform a useful task at Wikibooks, but it is my view and I will try to prove that your performance on this subject in particular was not proper for an administrator or based in a clean and due process.

: I don't know if we should be talking outside of the proceedings but I don't see that as a problem, but to avoid any more confusion you should address Robert on this subject until things are resolved. This is all as new to me as to you, we (the whole community) should not mess this up as in the future, if we do it right, it will serve as example to resolve similar problems. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 02:21, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

: If you think something must be altered on the way things are proceeding you should ask for a clarification to be posted on our Arbitration page or even you may propose any change that you and me will have to agree upon and be seen as acceptable by Robert. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 02:34, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

::OK, I &quot;closed&quot; it. I talked to Robert about it a bit on his talk, but I think the current structure is &quot;all we have&quot; for now, and I agree it's better to just get it done quickly.

'''Argh!!!''' -- Panic, please stop insisting that people &quot;close&quot; their comments. This sort of thing is '''''exactly''''' what got you into trouble. Don't worry about what other people have to say or whether they're going to say more. If they want to say more, they will. You're already making me regret &quot;formally closing&quot; my comments, because there's really no reason for formally closing. Just say what you have to say, and if more stuff is brought up, you can edit to include a response to the new stuff. The thing that people don't like about your behavior is that you have a tendency to tell people how to behave. Relax!

Really: just say what you have to say. I (as in me, SB_Johnny) don't think you're a bad guy, you just have trouble understanding how your actions are seen by others. I've &quot;known&quot; you long enough that I understand that you don't mean to be offensive, and that you don't like being told that you're being offensive. Robert might not want to be bothered with that.

The '''first''' time I blocked you was for exactly this reason: telling other people what to do. In that case it was &quot;if you dont do X, I will do Y&quot;. Now, you're essentially saying &quot;if everyone doesn't do A (A=&quot;close comments&quot;), I won't do B (B=&quot;respond&quot;). I understand that the structure that's been set up seems very formal and &quot;court-like&quot;, but it's really not. I (as in me, SB_Johnny) genuinely want to hear what you have to say (I probably won't agree with it, but that's not your problem). 

Say what you have to say. I'm not &quot;out to get you&quot;... quite the contrary. Get it done, so we can move on. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:45, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

: No sir, I can't provide my counter argumentation without the Arbiter recognizes that the first step is closed (as there was no indication of a time frame), the other users have now signed and if the last remaining open comment is closed their contribution the page will be blocked from editing if the arbiter so decides and I will then have the chance to reply, in any case you seem to have a problem differentiating between I asking and I forcing or making you do something (even if I did the last, I had no power to enforce it), you are responsible for all your actions, other people can't make you do things, they can trick you into doing things but ultimately the responsibility is yours, that's life. Since I  see this last remark as counterproductive and as a new invitation to conflict, I'll ask you that you restrain your comments on how I behave or what I do for the examination that will fallow, you are free to edit the page until the arbiter closes the page and I'm informed that I can proceed.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 22:50, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

Panic, you misunderstood me. This is partly my fault, because in the past few months one thing I've learned about you is that you frequently misunderstand people. Here's the scoop:
*I am no longer involved in mediating your disputes with other users, and therefore you have nothing to fear from me.
*You stated above that you are no longer interested in opening a &quot;request for de-adminship&quot; for me, and therefore I have nothing to fear from you.
So, what I said above was offered as advice... from one wikibookian to another. You've said (or at least hinted) that you're worried about maybe being permanently blocked. I'm worried about that too, because as much as you get on my nerves sometimes, I'd rather see this thing worked out to everyone's satisfaction rather than just having you &quot;kicked out&quot;. 

So, despite the name of the arbitration (&quot;Panic vs. SB_Johnny&quot;, which should really be &quot;Panic vs. other parties, previously mediated by SB_Johnny&quot;), let's just bury the hatchets and talk to each other once in a while. I can't be &quot;on your side&quot; as far as your dispute with the other editors goes (in fact I disagree with you totally), but I can be someone you can look to for advice as a neutral party. Again, I don't think you mean to come off the way you do: maybe in a cool moment you can explain it to me, and maybe I can help you explain it to others. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:44, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

: I don't think I  misunderstood you and I'm not particularly worried from the outcome but even after I modified my wish to request for your de-adminship, it still is up for the Arbiter to decide how it will end. I'm sorry if I did cause you some feeling of hunger or any kind of personal feeling toward me, it was not my intention and I think I never engaged you in any personal attack and never tried to &quot;pick on you&quot; nor other users, the only personal felling I have are only reserved for Darklama, and are more despair and mistrust and probably I did get into a moment of hunger that even during my problems with Paddu were kept in check, but I will vent it all out soon, I hope. As for the Arbitration, what is on the table is only my request for the removal of the block, it is up to the Arbiter to see if the other accusations are interlinked and must be addressed on this process, I will try to give some kind of response to the other users but some of the allegations are probably outside of the scope. I do have the feeling that it would be more useful if the Arbiter also provided some mediation for the other problems, I will request it but the other parties must first agree to be moderated on those topics. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 00:12, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

: On a specific point, I never did agree in your particular mediation on my divergences with Darklama, I and Darklama agreed and asked for comments from several administrators, some at the time some did state they weren't comfortable in discussing parts of the problem and most provided some gidelines and advises and even made requests and indicated some solutions. Before the first block and the copyvio problem you never indicated that you were taking personal responsibility to solve or address the problem and I see many of your action as single sided (but I will address them later). --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 00:43, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

:Well as I said I'm not interested in getting involved in debates in general nor other Wiki projects, I did contribute to Wikibooks as a way to advance the C++ Project and start the P2P book, since I'm doing some personal development/research on those areas since 2001 and it was a way not only to share  some knowledge but at the same time learn and get a broader information on the same issues, as a way not only to share any research but to get my own thoughts written down, that's why I chose the eng.wikibooks as the language makes it more useful to others, this are the limits of my wish to get involved, but txs for the offer. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 00:08, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

Hi Panic - seems like Rob Horning is not around at present.  I'm sure you would agree that this needs sorting for all concerned.

:Yup but the statement that validates that assertions is on the arbitrage page and it is not very clear the '''I'm done'''  post, since other users did post comments on the accusation first part, they may still want to respond and I have placed several questions that they may wish to respond publicly and on the arbitration log, if it takes more than the time I have take to respond or was used on the first step we should contact Rob (I think I saw at least one post from him in the last days), it is only proper to give people some time, lets wait a bit more. Anyway Johnny can state more clear that he is finished and ask, since he is on the same side, if the others have anything to add (even you may ask, it wouldn't be proper for me to do that after Johnny post after I did it on the first round).--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 17:25, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

:::As an aside you should check your definition of arbitration, I saw your post on another page and an arbitration doesn't need to have community agreement or consensus nor even permission, an arbitration is started as soon as agreed by the parts involved.

:::More and to let me know, did SBJohnny agreed with your actions and the six months time frame? Why not more or less ? What do you feel will/would change in that time frame ? What did you expect to &quot;gain&quot; or had as a goal by performing the block ?

Panic, let me say from the start that I'm only replying here because I don't want one of your comments to go unanswered. Niether Whiteknight nor Withinfocus consulted me on this decision, and as far as I know it was not discussed on IRC. I made it clear a month ago that I wasn't going to be involved, and I haven't been, except for relating my understanding of the history of your problems with fellow editors, and prodding it along a bit because it was going on for too long (which wouldn't have been my problem if your friend Robert hadn't insisted on keeping me involved against my expressed wishes). 

I don't necessarily agree with the block or the length of the block, but I trust Matt's judgment (and no, I ''don't'' talk to him outside of talk pages). I think you got into trouble because you just couldn't help but let your acerbic, sarcastic tendencies take over your comments on the arbitration (please remember that I had tried to point this out to you when I was offering to help you compose your &quot;defendant's reply&quot;). 

I know you're sincere, and I know you think you're in the right. The problem is that you don't do a good job expressing what you're sincere and (possibly) right about, and you're quite frankly abusive to your fellow contributors, whether you mean to be or not. I spent a lot of time and energy trying to help you understand how you were making other people so angry at you, but you didn't take it to heart. You say you respect your fellow conrtibutors, but just saying that doesn't mean much when you otherwise behave the way you do. 

I really, sincerely wish there was some way of working this out that would involve your inclusion in the Wikibooks project as an active member. I will not (now or ever) volunteer to be an advocate for you, but if you can think of another way I can help you, please do. Just keep in mind that Matt is in charge, and he's a level-headed guy, and a guy who (in my experience) doesn't have a lot of tolerance for bullshit. Unblocking you merely requires the press of a button, but I don't think anyone will press that button unless '''you''' make a good solid case for doing so. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:16, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

:I know that I said I would no longer comment here, but Johnny's comment has inspired me to extend a single path for a solution that I believe will be to your benefit. The above comment pretty effectively summarizes the main problem with your actions here: disrespect. So here's the process I'd like for you (and the community) to do:

::Well, to SBJohnny post I have already stated what I think happened and extracted many suppositions to justify it's actions and the why of all this mess this are all on the &quot;arbitration log&quot;, I understand we (me and SBJohnny) don't share many views on too many subjects and I'm pretty sure I could list them all with a very low level of error but the one that brought us (the &quot;active&quot; part of the community) to this situation is that administrative actions were taken without proper proceedings and regards to the damage it caused, no more no less, this is not even about if I have or not broken any policy, it is plain to anyone that has spent a second fallowing what has been happening that no try has been made to solve any of the so called abuses or justifications for action with dialog, this of course not taking in consideration that the actions used to justify the blocks are not the ones the block action addressed), I have in the past given SBJohnny the chance to discuss or point out my errors or admit his own errors, the third block that drove me to here shows how the block decission is being abused and the taking over of the arbitration by another and non approved arbiter and his final &quot;solution&quot; just reinforces that abusive use and establish a very dangerous precedent on Wikibooks.
 
::As for the tone of the first part of my contribution to the arbitration I grant you that some of it may have sarcastic nuances but I have been very careful not to be caustic or disrespectful, I can only face this mess with a sense of humor and taking some personal enjoyment on the time I may be wasting, but taking in consideration your comment on your response I stopped it, no more puns were used on the second part, in no way can my attempt on providing the readers (and the writer) with a more creative text an attempt to disrespect you or the proceeding, and I have clearly stated so on the same text.

::If I don't take this all with a grain of salt and happy face and hoping the best of others, I would have left or been indeed uncivilized regarding some actions.

::I also now share many of Xixtas dreads in regard to the existence of a clique of administrators and I know that ANY solution that will be reached will not fully address my aspirations. There is an uncommon and annoying coincidence of actions and timings and positions that goes beyond a free flow of information and decisions on a social network, even all well intentions of the world can't justify some of the events we have witnessed. Well, I'm a bit paranoid my nick is Panic...

::To [[User talk:Withinfocus]], I must only repeat what I have said to Whiteknight and point yet again to the first reply to your solution as is stated in &lt;s&gt;[[Wikibooks:Arbitration/Panic2k4 vs. SBJohnny/Arbitrator Actions]]&lt;/s&gt; (moved to) [[Wikibooks talk:Arbitration/Panic2k4 vs. SBJohnny/Arbitrator Actions]], as I have said in response for the first attempt of Whiteknight to end the arbitration [[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks_talk:Arbitration/Panic2k4_vs._SBJohnny#Can_we_call_this_to_an_end.3F here]], and as I stated somewhere above I don't recognize to you [[User talk:Withinfocus]] the right to judge me or the capability to cast an independent analysis starting by pointing out the unlawful action that has gotten me again blocked under a unjustified claim since you could not under any circumstance have substituted the original arbiter, you are free and able to provide any of your interpretation of the events as are all users, but I find it strange that no one uses facts to base the claims they make...

::What I'm aiming is clear, I want to understand what I did wrong and if not found guilty I want my block log cleared, you are free to analise the now clear and finished argumentation on the arbitration, but it would be a show of fairness to 1) remove this last block 2) remove the same block from my log 3) enable the first arbiter if he wishes so to finish his analysis and then comment on it as was intended, this would indeed be constructive and address the community problems, I will respect any decision taken on those terms, failing that, may next move if I so decide is to request the unblock of your last block and I think it is clear to you now that you will have no justification to it.

::I must ask you one other thing as you have refused to reply in the past I will understand if you also don't reply now. Did I ever been uncivil to you ?

:::You being uncivil to me is not part of the block, but your writing has been as stubborn and disrespectful as always. However, you were not nearly as offensive to me as you were to the C++ book-writers. I've read what you wrote and found it to be the same old soapbox, going nowhere and saying the same things over and over again about how you think you didn't really violate any policies here when I can't believe how you don't realize how in the wrong you are. My stance is exactly the same and I KNOW from FACTS that you acted in an uncivil manner. Nothing has changed! I can't get trapped into another round of semantics with you though (you're repeating yourself when nothing new has been brought to the table), so the chance to solve some of this has been revoked and the block will stay for six months.

The burden of prof is with the accusation, I don't have to admit to anything as I'm innocent until proven guilty this is a core rule to any proceedings to attribute blame.

Facts:
#Withinfocus violated the decision policy, the block policy and in interfering on the arbitration and with his final comments he made on the proceedings the be civil policy, his actions did not only aggravated a perceived problem to the community they were against the spirit of the project. (if you want a by point analysis I will provide but not on my talk page)
#SBJohnny broke the block policy several times and came very near to performing personal attacks, and engaged in actions that caused great harm to another user of Wikibooks (facts are stated on the arbitration logs, no further info is needed)

Both users are administrators that should have a better understanding of the rules and needs of the Wikibooks project, at this moment I have no problems with any other user, there are still some disputed edits of Darklama that I will address later if indeed possible, they also broke policy as they were an abuse of the be bold guideline as several administrators have agreed.

The time for you to have addressed your actions SBJohnny has passed and is part of the arbitration logs.

Indeed our talk is over as clearly stated in the past, and if we are here is because of your refusal to address policy violation by another user and probably having misconceptions about me. I clearly refuse your assessment of the problem until you yourself admit to wrong doing [[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Withinfocus&amp;curid=36133&amp;diff=744894&amp;oldid=744891#A_suggestion Your suggestion]] does't have any value as all the burden is given to me for actions I was not responsible, and doesn't address the  above stated violations, or corrects my block logs and restores my reputation.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 21:45, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

:Panic, I'm not interested in addressing my actions, and I'm not concerned whether or not you agree to what I've suggested. My suggestion to Matt (and everyone else) is nothing more than common sense: you must acknolwedge how you have gotten yourself into this situation, agree to stop doing the things that you do that have been causing so many problems over the years, and understand that if you continue to cause problems, you won't be given the opportunity to cause them further.

You have requested that your block be lifted.  I would happily do this as I believe the blocking was unfair but if I did this I'm sure such a move would just be reversed.

*reset 

You just said that I wasn't the problem, the problem is what other people think of me, right? You, yourself engaged in actions to further promote that view but, you say you have no facts, isn't that also correct? What the problem was is or will be is this people fail to address the subject matter, this last block is unquestionable abusive, no one can even claim otherwise with a strait face, the block the SBJohnny performed were also abusive and badly formalized but, as you said, this is now part of the arbitration logs.

I (or anyone else) are not required to be nice, they are required to be civil, I shouldn't have to be a yes man to be able to participate, I'm not here to please ALL the people and I have found myself able to work and contribute to the project for years without problems, I'm not a dictator nor I try to force my will on others, I only request that others respect the rules they have agreed on as a way to contribute to the project, it is clear that if you refuse to find facts that prove that I have broken policies the reverse can't be said, as policies have been broken on the actions performed to me.

I don't want the community to be lenient on me, I want justice and my name cleared or that accusations are based and addressed, how can I admit to be convicted if I don't know of my crime, your post above clearly states it all. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 20:55, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

:What i'm trying to do is help you in this current situation, to return to wikibooks as a productive and helpful member of this community. I'm saying that ''you are the problem'', and because of this, other people ''do not like you''. You don't want to admit any wrong doing whatsoever, instead placing the blame for this whole situation on other people. There is a behavioral problem here that needs to be corrected, and ''I don't care if you fix it or not''. If you do not fix the problem that got you here, you won't be coming back to wikibooks.

== A Proposal ==

Panic, as you know there are arguements concerning whether you should have been banned and the length of any ban imposed.  I don't know you personally and have had few dealings with you on Wikibooks but I have followed the arbitration and have talked with SBJohnny and other administrators on Wikibooks and IRC.

As you know, I'm not very happy with the ban.  I think that you were probably in the wrong with this issue and that you should allow other people to get involved in the CProgramming book.  I don't think a 6 month ban is at all appropriate and you should continue to be part of this project if you can work with the community again.  In order to unban you though we need you to agree to '''respect other users, acknowledge some kind of wrong doing and promise to work with other people on the project'''.  If you can do this then I will propose that you be unbanned immediately.  Nothing I have said here is a promise as I am only an administrator but I hope others would agree for the sake of Wikibooks.

Please respond here or on my userpage.

Xania, I comprehend your hopes and even understand that you further see me as a cause of problems, I don't have any disagreements with people on the book, nor did I exclude anyone from participating or engaged on actions perceived as uncivil.

I still have pending questions on moves and content deletion performed by Darklama as is expressly defined as violations because
:1) He didn't propose the changes to the existing book community (page moves, [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Panic2k4&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=606842  here is a post of User:Whiteknight 18:59, 9 October 2006 (UTC) on that regard])  
:2) He performed more changes he knew I didn't agree with during the second block and after being asked not to continue by an administrator ([http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Panic2k4&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=607068  here is a post of User:Whiteknight 00:08, 10 October 2006 (UTC)] stating ''&quot;I had asked darklama to take some time to back away and cool off, and he respectfully has followed that suggestion.&quot;'')
SBJohnny did not only ignore it ([http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=C%2B%2B_Programming&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history example of changes during the block]) but punished me for &quot;similar&quot; action after excluding himself from dialog. (dates and posts indicated are only relevant taking in consideration [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Panic2k4 my block log])

More, it is also evident that I have not been contributing to the book since Darklama raised problems nor have I taken any action on his changes up until the time as I saw the clear use of double standards and an active effort to demonize my actions.

I was and agree to respect others and will continue to work with others, but I can't acknowledge something I didn't commit, can you provide some idea where I did commit those acts you think I must repent on ?

I also ask you to remove the proposal on the Staff lounge, proposal that I strongly disagree and see as an attempt to withe wash abusive action that did not have approval or complete understanding by the community. I have responded to the proposal of SBJohnny in a [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3APanic2k4&amp;diff=744929&amp;oldid=744873 post above and he seems to have ignored that I strongly objected to it].

If indeed people are willing to address the perceived problems, it is foremost important to regulate the action that in itself is unlawful, that is, the recent taking over of an orderly process and the resulting block, the block has not only punished me but limited the way I can defend myself in a clear and understandable way, from the formal presentation of views we had during the arbitration, we are now reduced to this mess.

If a proposal needs to be considered, we must analise the events in a reverse order and provide with fairness the facts to the community. 

I think it is clear that the last block did not address any new facts and that I was respecting all users intervening, I was not causing any damage and was participating in a constructive process, the block was not performed because I was breaking any news policy or being uncivil to others, what the block seems to have provided is a way to terminate a fair evaluation of facts, and in a clear way. The interpretations or why some selected to do so is beyond me and it seems to other users also ([http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Withinfocus&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=743738 post of Xixtas 15:12, 4 February 2007 (UTC)], [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Robert_Horning&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=744775 post of Rob Horning 19:06, 5 February 2007 (UTC)]), including yourself. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 00:29, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

:I want to point out here, publicly (since this page and my own user talk page have become substantial forii about this issue), that I was insisting that some sort of accomodations be made to discuss and come to a concensus about what sort of conclusion to this whole thing should be.  It has not been overtly stated, but I believe that the &quot;concensus&quot; for this current 6-month block is something that was decided on the IRC channel with a few of the Wikibooks admins and others who are semi-regular there.   That was not my goal with the arbitration, but rather to have everybody, including yourself here (I don't think you agreed to the six month block) come to a reasonable accomodation... or at least something of a compromise.
:I do want you to continue to work here on Wikibooks, as I think that many of the contributions you have made here are simply outstanding.  You also provide a very different viewpoint to all of what we do here than seems to be common, which I believe is also one of the reasons why there seems to be conflict between yourself and some of the other people who are regular contributors to Wikibooks.  This, I believe, to be a very good thing and something that should be encouraged... within reason.
:This cycle of finger pointing and complaining needs to end somehow.  One of the &quot;reasons&quot; why I stayed away from the arbitration for the &quot;two weeks&quot; that was percieved to be an incompetince on my part was in part to get a little perspetive on this whole thing and try to avoid getting all worked up over everything.  I also did not see you, Panic, as an immediate danger to Wikibooks as you were not doing anything based on your user contribution log that was unreasonable or from what I could see as being even controvercial, except for perhaps those edits that were directly tied to the arbitration pages and your responses on your own user page.  For this reason alone, I think that the user block you recieved was completely out of line.
:I should also note that I have a couple of pre-teens and a teenager who has been taking up a bunch of my time lately, am starting a brand new business (competely unrelated to Wikibooks), trying to finish off a couple of other programming contracts to get a little more money, taking a college class, dealing with my wife, and have a group of Boy Scouts that is also demanding my attention.  Frankly I'm surprised that I have any time left over to deal with anything on Wikibooks at all, and to top it off I got side-tracked with an image fair-use issue on Wikipedia that has long-term consequences to Wikibooks as well.
:I don't object to the other admins trying to try and resolve or end the arbitration.  That was not the problem.  But I do think that what happened here was not the best possible solution and indeed was the worst possible outcome, and the most harsh possible &quot;sentance&quot; that might have been imposed.  This does not help Wikibooks out at all, and indeed sets a preceedence that Wikibooks users can arbitrarily get rid of people that don't have the same philosophical background as the rest of &quot;us&quot;.  You were not a vandal, nor spamming Wikibooks with meaningless links and other garbage, which IMHO is the only reason to have an account to be blocked as yours was.  There certainly was no real substantial effort to gain community concensus here, or to try and find an impartial outside observer to this whole thing.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 13:06, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

== You are now blocked for 2 weeks ==

Panic2k4 I have removed your 6 month block and reblocked you for 2 weeks.  I have done this because 2 weeks was your original block and I believe that this was probably fair and that SBJohnny was probably acting in good faith.  There was no need for a longer block and the outcome of the arbitration is viewed with suspicion by many people and not generally agreed to.  It's possible that other administrators will not like my actions and that you will be reblocked for 6 months (and likely I will also be blocked) but I hope for the sake of community compromise this does not happen.  Please make a special effort to get along with the other users and make sure you involve everyone in your work on the C Programming book.  If you fail to do this then you will have little sympathy and support if another administrator decides to block you in future (and it'll make me look like a complete idiot if I don't already).

== to SB_Johnny ONLY&lt;br&gt;(please don't comment or add to this thread if you aren't SB_Johnny) ==

SB_Johnny, I request that you remove all proposals and stop any other action on the subject that lead us to this stage, there is no need for anyone involvement on this until a discussion on how to act on facts, I still continue to object that you still attempt to pass me as an being a threat to the community, further more I will '''strongly object''' to have to address you directly on this subject matter (I'll haply collaborate and address any other subjects in the future with you), due to the present situation it is of no benefit to you or to me to try to make the problem personal or bigger as it may still be a simple error on perceptions and on the applicability of Wikibooks policies. I will respect the now 2 weeks block as you wished in the first place, for the good of the community to try to defuse the discussion that was indeed taking a turn to the worst with the indisputable unlawful action taken (we should address that to, and probably first, but lets cool down first, for my benefit and withinfocus, he should have his say also), more, I also don't like this new block as I see no need for it, but will respect it under the stated reasons and as respect for the perceived reasons of some, that would have me blocked for six moths or permanently, at least it is a reduction of the &quot;sentence&quot;, I can concede that much and see it as a step in the right direction and I'm lead to believe that at least you would also take it as done in accord to the last block you initiated.

I hope you do the same (wait) and let's see what Xania or Robert will do after block, not all that has passed was bad, a possible outcome would be some clear and useful alteration to some of the policies that were used as justification for the actions, no one should be excluded from the process but as was evident having some ground rules helps to avoid confusion and prevents that things get out of control.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 02:52, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

:Panic, this isn't a personal conflict between you and me. Despite all of your efforts, I am still here, at your side, hoping to help you. I don't hate you, I'm not angry at you, and I'm not your enemy. There's only 2 ways forward now -- me or the stewards -- and I don't think the stewards will be as understanding as I am. We can work this out, but it's going to take some effort on your part (and mine). --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:29, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

:::Panic, I'm sorry if I've misunderstood you, but it's seemed to me over the past few weeks that you've been trying to push me out of the conversation.

::::It is sad that we can't yet read each others minds (well it may depend on possible outcome) that at least would make things easier, one way or the other, but probably the greatest problem I have when reading some of your posts is that you seem to add just a little of disinformation that has a perceivable negative impact on me. As a concrete example I call your attention to the &quot;'''few weeks'''&quot; and that was I that broke communications in the first place, I don't know if you do that with conscious or not but it seems to be a recurring problem on almost every post or word you write about the events related to me (I will avoid providing endless links to were I state this peculiarity and to similar situations it is most evident), I hope you don't take this a personal attack (it is only a remark that I have tried to impart to you in the past and you never acknowledged or tried to correct), as you may take this in a bad way, I'll state also that I to have some quirks or even personal problems that can sometime pass along or be misdirected especially as I have a harder time elaborating my replies and in general am dealing with time constrains or doing multitasking in several languages and I do like to be creative when I write, but even in my worst moments nothing of what I wrote so far, could have a meaning as removed from my stated intentions. Well, we will see, it may even be possible that is the core of the problem, I'm off, I'll be back after the block, humm, you may go to the bank with it. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 04:21, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

Agreed, and I do believe that you are often misread (I assume this is what you mean by &quot;misdirected&quot;?), and that you also sometimes misread others too. The problem lies in the fact that most other editors seem not to have this problem as often as you do, and as a matter of courtesey towards your fellow Wikibookians you need to try to find some way of making yourself understood better, and conversely working on understanding others too. The place we need to start is for you to just try and understand why people react to you the way they do. From there we need to come up with an alternative approach for you to take when dealing with other contributors. 

If you want to take a break and think for a couple weeks that's fine, but your ''final'' unblocking will probably not happen until you can commit to this. If you can make that commitment in 2 days, you'll be unblocked in 2 days. If it takes longer, then the block will last longer. This block is not a punishment, it's just a hurdle that you need to overcome. I (and hopefully some others as time goes on) will help you as we can, but the job of understanding the issue and commiting to a resolution is your responsibility. 

So again, here's the first question you need to consider, which you can answer in your own time. '''What is it about the way you interact with other Wikibookians that creates such strong, negative reactions?''' A few points to keep in mind:
*As I said above, I'm not asking for an admission of guilt. I believe you when you say you are misunderstood, so this isn't about right or wrong, it's just that you are misunderstood so often, and you need to find a way to avoid this in the future.
*I'm also not asking you to apologize. There has plenty of bad decisions made by plenty of good people (on my part too), but dealing with what's been done and said in the past is not thie issue now, because there will be no way to reconcile those past problems until we can prevent future ones. The only thing we're going to address about the past situations is as examples, where we'll try to find where the misunderstanding started. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:44, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

== Can we finish this ==

Whether there's consensus or not is a bit unclear, but I'm pretty sure you won't be ''permanently'' unblocked if you don't make a commitment to try to get along with your fellow contributors. As things stand now, you will be blocked until you do, by me, so please just work with me here and get this resolved by answering my questions.

For the record, you are blocked for violating [[WB:CIVIL]]. Being civil doesn't just mean &quot;not intentionally making people upset&quot;, but also &quot;seeing and respecting the other's point of view&quot;, and given the long history involved here, I feel I am fully justified in blocking you until you show some understanding of why people have such a hard time interacting with you. You must answer the question I have asked you as a path towards complying with this policy. At the risk of repeating myself, I'll ask again: why do your fellow wikibookians have such a hard time getting along with you? --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:13, 19 February 2007 (UTC)

:BTW: I have redone your block to fall on Sunday, since that's an easier day for me to keep track of. You are blocked for 2 weeks, but I will unblock you as soon as you commit to a plan for getting along with your fellow contributors. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:30, 19 February 2007 (UTC)

:That was no threat a block on the way you are applying it is only possible, or I should say, will only serve your purposes because I'm not a threat and I play along, if I was to actively contest or object to it you would be hard pressed to make it work or even having any policy that would validate action against my options to react to it, this block works because I allow it to be so...

Let's try again. ''&quot;No wikibookians (other than you) have expressed problems getting along with me&quot;'' is a very silly thing to say, especially after all that was written on the Arbitration pages. I won't have any trouble with you once you make a commitment not to be involved in the kind problems mentioned there.

As for the author's page problem, here are the other aspects that need to be addressed:
#You have only listed yourself as an author, despite the fact that others have contributed, and perhaps even more importantly because at least some of the stuff you put into the book was from other, non-GFDL source materials (acccording to one of the people you've been warring with). What the GFDL says is to list the top 5 authors, not to ask the top 5 authors if they would like to be listed.
#You have insisted that any changes to be made to the book be approved by the &quot;book community&quot;, but you insist that this only includes &quot;active authors&quot;, and after previous disputes, the only active author is you, so you are the book community. 

So please discuss ways in which you can avoid this in the future. Also think about your unusual approach to talk pages, such as rewording other contributors' comments, refactoring, etc. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:09, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

[[User:SBJohnny]], [[User:Jokes Free4Me]] does make a point, participation on the arbitration was after the fact, that is, after the blocks, and some of the facts you stated were incorrect, to say the least, and an attempt to validate your actions and to involve others, like for example Paddu, that alone in the terms that was performed clearly indicates bad faith of your part [[User:SBJohnny]] (I don't need more information on that, I know perfectly well how, when and why) and participation on the arbitration was requested of any one with any aggravation with me or just to provide evidence, like WK did, he didn't have any direct or active complain.&lt;br&gt;At this moment I don't know why I'm blocked as you didn't state in accord to the block policy a specific reason, as I say is a violation of the block policy.&lt;br&gt;

This is false, it is my right to include myself as author (as I'm an author of the book), I take personal and legal responsibility for the work (that is what an author does as he signs a work) in any case of problems I have in my possession emails for all the works I have included on the book from the original authors.&lt;br&gt;I wasn't warring with anyone.&lt;br&gt;The number five is a limit not an obligation, authors can't be added to the list they can/should only add themselves to the list if they so decide.&lt;br&gt;I know that my definition of author is not subscribed by you but it is the legal definition, not all contributors are automatically authors even if the GFDL doesn't define what a author is in it self a pretty good understanding can be extracted on the wording of what constitutes derivative works.

:''You have insisted that any changes to be made to the book be approved by the &quot;book community&quot;, but you insist that this only includes &quot;active authors&quot;, and after previous disputes, the only active author is you, so you are the book community.''

This is also incorrect, it is '''my view''' that it should be so, that is only people adding content to a book should decide upon it's evolution, as there is no &quot;book community&quot; definition at present (lets say imposing a limit on contributions to a work), it is my impression that the majority of the Wikibooks community sees as any user that makes '''any edit''' is part of the said &quot;book community&quot;, I don't agree with it and will work to provide a better definition, I had no disputes on that base, what you perceived as such was that another user made actions against policy and I as an active (but never claiming  to be the only) member of the targeted book requested (did not revert) him to correct his actions, no more no less.

As a note, I must point that all actions that broke policy by that particular user are still active (and under objection by me), more, I take personal offense to the recent change of wording done to the authors page, those changes can only be driven by bad intentions due to the wording used and not only add further implications of bad practices to me but also about the work and seem in conformity with your bad assumptions probably based on bad information, it is clear that people are again spreading insinuations about matters that they don't directly address to the proper channel...
Also FYI removing other books that were used on the work even if they are no longer present on Wikibooks is also a violation of GFDL. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 03:58, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

:Please keep in mind that the C++ pages are not on my watchlist at the moment, and people don't need to ask me to approve changes to it any more than they need to ask for your approval. If you have a concern about something, please provide a diff and a (calm, civil) explnation of your concern. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:44, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

::Will do. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 23:39, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

Ha-ha, funny :). Panic, your technical skills have never been in doubt, and you have nothing to prove. If you'd rather go around the problem than deal with it &quot;as yourself&quot;, that's fine... as I'm sure you know we have no policy on sockpuppets. If you want to fix this the honorable way, I'm here. 

(''adding after edit conflict'':) Thanks... let me know about that, I will help you make your case.  --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:43, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

Dhhooo ?!?! I'm clueless here... :) And I invoke the 5th :). Anyway I will in any event address the &quot;problems&quot;, I have been doing so but I wish you would also acknowledge several problem on your part. As you seem invested on also working around the real problems I will play along. On the other hand I do seem to have something to prove and I will do it in a non destructive and even productive and honorable way without breaking policy since it seems perception is of foremost importance above the facts. (against what you claim, I do seem to have a good understanding of the Wikibooks policies)
As I said please state the event were I have broken the [[WB:CIVIL]] policy and try to speed thing up if you really wish to resolve this problem, we all have better things to do. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 00:09, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

:Taking the 5th is wise, and I'm glad we're on &quot;playing terms&quot; again :). For the record, your original block (the one that Robert undid) was for setting back the clock on the talk pages without seeking input of discussion from those who spent a lot of time, thought, and effort into undoing what you had done. The current block is for insisting that you're &quot;innocent&quot;, and asserting your right to keep on doing things as you've been doing them, which wouldn't be a problem except that &quot;doing things as you've been doing them&quot; has really hurt some people. 

:I know you don't mean to hurt people, and I respect your sense of humor and irony. The only reason I'm willing to spend time and effort on this is because I know you're for real, and I want you to be part of the project (aside from your insights on policy issues, I think you might have some skills needed by those of us who believe in the cause of [[meta:WP:OP]]). 

:So to get back to the conversation: If you could edit outside your userpage (using this account, of course), what would your response be to the edit you mentioned above? (I'm still not sure what edit you mean... I really do need a diff!) I'd like to talk about that, rather than what's gone before. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:07, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

::Dude, cut it out with the sockpuppets. That sort of joke is only funny until someone gets it, and &quot;the audience&quot; will turn against you in a way you don't deserve :). --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:11, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

:::Sockpuppets exist, the community only doesn't know who most are (there is no single solution to this, a statistical analysis on the interaction of users or participation/edits/contributions could help identify who they are but even that would be easily bypassed, ips can't be trusted for identity purposes, this was the first time I took such an action and just to prove a point and I think not only you have noticed it :), no harm is done or is intended, but I now come to see a purpose or even a usefulness to them, they can be a great tool to avoid and redirect conflicts or at least deflate them. Also this proves that way that WK is using the decision by consensus, to what I do also object to, can be abused), another one is that if no restriction is given to &quot;outsiders&quot; or people that have no invested interest on the project disruption will be easy and unavoidable, this is why a definition of a book community should exist.
:::I have [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASBJohnny&amp;diff=763340&amp;oldid=762932 posted the diff on your talkpage]. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 01:23, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

Again you are incorrect, just before, during the 5 blocks and up to now, I never removed, altered or subverted any other users talk page, or even the book's talk pages. I only removed my post on a single talk in relation to Darklama as I was lured to a debate of the use of the We (as we Wikibookians) in front of another user that didn't have a knowledge of what was going on, James).
The restructuring of the book talk pages (as they were before Darklama took upon himself to change while I was blocked) was done in 2004/2005 on the forked work, it is also ''my view'' (not contested by any policy or guideline) that Books are not wikipedia articles, centralization of the content discussion is vital to get users involved and aware of what is going on in the structure or the flow of the book, as it is, most users use a single page talk to post a problem and if lucky they remember to watch it, the probability that a significant number of other users is monitoring the same page is very low, even more if a book is under heavy evolution and restructuring, then it will be indeed very small, on the forked work I (without any objection), and as I do monitor every single page of the book, started to reply to users on a specific talk page and at the same time informing that the post and reply would be moved to the proper place (giving the link) and after the move redirecting the talk page, this is useful to all, after the merge the structure continued to evolve on those terms, even other admins helped moving them as they were. After you ended conversation I was forced to ''restore'' the pages to their proper place, giving warning that I would do it, no more no less.

My primary problem was and is with Darklama and I was addressing it in a civil way until you performed the blocks and validated his abuse (I will list all the problems I have on your talk page one by one for you to correct, had you done that at the time we could have avoided all this). The problems or divergences are stated on the top of the page they are more about general policy not on the specific edits and you were called to comment on them at the time, the other problems is that Darklama insists on reformatting, alter (the logic or flow) and remove content, even corrupting history logs of the book this without adding any content to it or requesting input from the people working on it (most of the time, we were doing more or less well up to your first block). --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 02:30, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

:Well, the puppet tricks have raised hairs... congratulations. I'll post more later. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:16, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

:I hope we can continue our conversation, but you (and your socks) will be hardblocked now. That was really poor judgement on your part, and at least in the near term I can't unblock you. 

:BTW, I looked into those diffs... I'll ask herby about the first one, not sure what the problem is with the second. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:08, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

Hardblock doesn't work, what I said is still valid blocks only work if the user allows them. I don't see any problem on that, you can say I didn't respect your block if you wish, but as things are, I have been blocked for to long and your social experiment is flawed as I say I didn't commit any violation and it is now evident that you took actions without understanding the problem. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 16:53, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

:Panic, what's become evident is that you're perfectly willing to disrupt the Wikibooks project, which is far from civil. Your continued creation of puppets only serves to reinforce this, and there's no chance of you being unblocked while you do this. 
:BTW, the first diff you gave me was the wrong one... that was Darklama, not Herbythyme. I'm still not clear what the problem is with his edit. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:07, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

::Another BTW: while I wish you'd cut it out, please just try not to use names that someone might want later (maybe check on wikipedia first... if they're permablocked vandals then feel free). Given the names you've used so far, I'm guessing you've already thought of that, but I thought I'd mention it just in case. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:41, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</text>

They are fast growing birds and will quickly reach about 20lb for the Goose, and 30lb for the Gander. The Embden's legs are fairly short. The head is oval-shaped and they have a long and graceful neck. The eyes are blue. The body is bulky and well rounded, having a long back and a short tail. The wings are very strong and of a good length. The feathers are close and very hard. The breed’s habits are to forage for tidbits in the grass and water.  They are a very hardy breed. The adult bird will commence laying eggs fairly early in the year, in February as a rule, laying 30 to 40 eggs. The bird is an excellent table bird.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Narrative and Memoir'''




=Creative Writing=
While other forms of writing ask that you to find research in external source before you begin, creative writing does not require this of you. More often than not, creative writing projects only require you to use your memory and imagination to tackle your project.  This ability to just sit down and write without having to perform research allows you to practice writing whenever you want. You can try writing a poem on your coffee break or during a bus or subway ride. You can spend an afternoon writing a memoir about your favorite childhood pet, or you could begin to keep a journal where describe the events of your day, the weather,  the books you are reading, or television shows you like to watch. For creative and personal writing, the possibilities are endless.

Now you may be asking yourself if you have anything worth writing about, and the simple answers is yes you do! Every day provides an infinite number of topics to write about, whether that be having dinner with a friend, the taste of your coffee, or the beauty of a painting you saw in a museum. The activities in this section will help you jump-start your creativity, and before you know it you will have written some great poems, short stories, and memoirs.

== Poetry ==
More so than any other form of writing, poetry is known for its ability to express ideas and emotions or tell stories using very few words. Though some poems can be long, in general the best poems are those that help us appreciate mankind and nature by condensing  a scene or event into short poem full of specific details. With these poetry exercises, you will attempt to write poems that are short but specific. Like every other kind of writing, the most successful pieces of poetry help us clearly imagine what the poet is talking about by using concrete images or facts. The following exercises will also help you practice writing clear sentences, think about grammar, and practice using punctuation, but most of all have fun writing.

===Poetry Without Punctuation===
Have you ever got tired of having to use punctuation and wish you could write without having to worry about periods, commas, and quotations? Well many poets have become famous for writing pieces that do not use any punctuation to make their sentences clear. However do not be fooled, writing without punctuation can be just as difficult as writing with it. For this exercise, read Lucille Clifton's [http://www.poetryfoundation.org/archive/poem.html?id=176011 &quot;the garden of delight&quot;] and then write a poem about a garden or park you like to visit without using any punctuation. Keep in mind that you want the reader to be able to easily understand the poem, so like Clifton insert line breaks or spaces to help the reader understand how to read the poem.

Then on a separate piece of paper, try writing the same poem again, but this time use punctuation. Notice how the poem changes and the punctuation can help you. After you have written the second version of the poem, spend a few moments and journal about writing both poems. Which poem was easier to write? What made it easier to write? Do you like this poem better and why? Which do you think is easier for the reader to understand? Why? Be sure to have both poems in front of you when you journal so that you can easily compare them, noticing where you used punctuation in the second poem and how that might or might have clarified what you wrote in the first poem.

==Narrative and Memoir==
=== Defining ''Narrative'' and ''Memoir''===

* Narrative:
1.ACTION
2.REACTION
3.DIALOGUE 
this three must be needed when writing a memoir ---(narrative lead)---

&lt;blockquote&gt;Simply stated, narrative is a style of writing that tells a story.  It can be fiction or nonfiction and is typically told from a first- or third-person point of view.  Narratives can be in the form of short stories, poetry, personal essays, novels, monologues, folktales, fables, legends, etc.  The characteristic hallmark of narrative is that there is a character or voice telling the reader or viewer &quot;what happened,&quot; as with the &quot;narrators&quot; of most novels and short stories, and many movies or television programs.  Well-known and popular TV examples of this would include the late 1980s/early 1990s drama, ''[http://imdb.com/title/tt0094582/ The Wonder Years],'' or more recently the prime-time shows ''[http://imdb.com/title/tt0285403/ Scrubs]'', and ''[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0410975/ Desperate Housewives]''. A narrative may or may not have dialogue, depending on whether or not the event or action taking place is simply an observation from a distance (like the narrator of a nature documentary) or, for instance, a kind of ''I said'' or ''he/she said'' situation (like J.D. Salinger's ''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher_in_the_rye The Catcher in the Rye]'' and F. Scott Fitzgerald's ''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Gatsby The Great Gatsby]'').  Some narratives have multiple narrators, or more than one character/voice, each of whom is responsible for either telling one part of a larger story, or who tell different versions of the same story.  Several narrative examples of the use of multiple narrators can be found in William Faulkner's novel ''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sound_and_the_Fury The Sound and the Fury],'' Ernest J. Gaines's novel ''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Gathering_of_Old_Men A Gathering of Old Men],'' and Akira Kurosawa's film ''[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0042876/ Rashomon].'' &lt;/blockquote&gt;
* Memoir:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Memoir is a specific type of narrative.  It is autobiographical in nature but it is not meant to be as comprehensive as biography (which tells the ''entire'' life story of a person).  Instead, a memoir is usually only a specific &quot;slice&quot; of one's life.  The time span within a memoir is thus frequently limited to a single memorable event or moment, though it can also be used to tell about a longer series of events that make up a particular period of one's life (as in Cameron Crowe's film memoir ''[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0181875/ Almost Famous]'').  It is narrative in structure, usually describing people and events that ultimately focuses on the emotional significance of the story to the one telling it.  Generally, this emotional significance is the result of a resolution from the conflict within the story.  Though a memoir is the retelling of a true account, it is not usually regarded as being completely true.  After all, no one can faithfully recall every detail or bit of dialogue from an event that took place many years ago.  Consequently, some creative license is granted by the reader to the memoirist recounting, say, a significant moment or events from his childhood some thirty years or more earlier.  (However, the memoirist who assumes too much creative license without disclosing that fact is vulnerable to censure and public ridicule if his deception is found out, as recently happend with James Frey and his alleged memoir, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Million_Little_Pieces A Million Little Pieces].'') Furthermore, names of people and places are often changed in a memoir to protect those who were either directly or indirectly involved in the lives and/or event(s) being described.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Common Approaches ===

Below you will find some typical writing prompts that will allow you to begin writing a narrative or memoir. Remember to stay focused and to tell a story when writing in this genre. 

* &quot;Write about someone significant in your life.&quot;

* &quot;Write about the worst/best, most significant/exciting/boring day of your life.&quot;

* &quot;If you had a chance to talk with a historical/famous/legendary/etc. person, what would you talk about? Explain why.&quot;

=== Sample Assignment ===

There is not one right or best way to write a narrative or memoir. However, there are certainly better ways to write in this genre than others. Read the following short samples of an &quot;excellent,&quot; &quot;needs a little work,&quot; and &quot;needs a lot of work&quot; narrative writing assignment! Because it should be a narrative, remember that the writer should be telling a story. All grammar, spelling, and punctuation errors should be cleared up when editing. See [[Basic Writing/Editing]] for more help. So the focus will be on content.

Assignment: &quot;Write about someone significant in your life.&quot; 

'''Needs a lot of work:'''
&lt;blockquote&gt; My mom is a significant person in my life. She has always taken good care of me. She looks after my family and does a lot of hard work. My family couldn't make it without my mom. I really love my mom a lot because of all she has done for me. She's a great person. I tell my mom everything. She is probably my closest friend. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;*&lt;/b&gt;&lt;font color=#555555&gt;&lt;em&gt;This narrative needs a lot of work. There are very few specific details. Questions that need to be answered are: How does she take good care of you? What kind of hard work does she do? Why is she a great person? What kind of a person is she? What does she do with the information you give her? What kind of sacrifices has she made for the family? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font color=#555555&gt;&lt;em&gt;Answering these questions will really improve the writing. The audience wants to know as much interesting information as you can tell them about this topic. Think about all the details you see and hear in a movie or really good book. You don't need to reach that level, but that should be your goal. Giving some specific, personal examples will help the audience understand the writing and enjoy reading it. See the next example for a better response to this assignment. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Needs a little work:'''
&lt;blockquote&gt; When I was young, I didn't get along very well with my mom. We used to fight a lot and I just didn't understand her. She always seemed to be in my business and trying to snoop around. I've always had really dry eyes. Sometimes they water to compensate or get really red because they're so dry. My mom used to think I'd been crying and bug me to death asking me if someone had hurt my feelings at school! I was a teenager! &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;But now me and my mom are best friends. I tell her everything and she tells me everything. Sometimes we still disagree, but we've learned to understand and repsect each other. We're very different people, but I don't know what I'd do without my mom. She has always supported me and stood behind whatever I've wanted to do or be. She's my biggest fan. In my mom's eyes, I could be the next great world leader, or a famous ballerina, or the first astronaut to live on Mars. It took me a while to realize just how significant my mom is to me, but now that I know, nothing will ever change the way I feel about her. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;*&lt;/b&gt;&lt;font color=#555555&gt;&lt;em&gt;This narrative is better than the first one because it has more details and gives some specific examples regarding the writer's relationship to her mom. However, it still needs a little work because even more details could be provided to give the reader a clearer picture of their relationship.  For example, the reader doesn't know what has changed in this relationship that led to the two of them becoming like &quot;best friends.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Excellent:'''
&lt;blockquote&gt; When I was a teenager, I didn't get along very well with my mom.  It seemed like we fought on a daily basis and we rarely if ever understood where the other was coming from.  I felt so seperate from her and it was impossible to tell her about my problems because all she would ever do is freak out.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I remember one particular fight in perfect clarity.  We were having one of our good days - that should've been the first warning sign.  I was helping her weed the flower beds, telling her about a conversation that I had had with my boyfriend's mom the previous night.  When I was finished telling her about the advice that Janice shared with me about how to reconcile with a friend of mine, my mom grew very quiet.  I asked her if something was wrong but she continued to stare at a stubborn dandelion in the middle of her peony bed.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Finally, she looked up at me.  Frustration and anger filled her face and tears spilled down her cheeks.  &quot;How come you never come to me anymore?&quot; she spat.  &quot;Why do you have to go to other moms to talk about your problems?  Am I not good enough?&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I didn't really know what to say.  I tried to reason with her, explaining that it's normal for teenagers to talk to other parents about personal problems, but all she did was storm off.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
That was the day that I realized how much my mom actually meant to me.  I knew from her reaction that she felt devalued and even though we had our issues, I also knew that I had a great mom.  She had always taken care of me, provided for me, and as a young child, she was my best friend. I wanted that back and from that day on, the two of us worked on communcating better and getting to know each other all over again.    &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;*&lt;/b&gt;&lt;font color=#555555&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is an excellent example of a narrative because it provides necessary details to help the reader understand the relationship between the mother and daughter. In the &quot;needs a little work&quot; example, the writer did not explain how the mom and daughter became &quot;best friends.&quot; This is an important and significant detail. It is important to explain the important details as much as possible in a story. To continue this writing, the writer will probably give another example of how things were after they began to understand each other better. This will give the audience a clear picture of the progress of the relationship.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Examples: ===
The following are example compositions written for an assignment where students were asked to write narrative descriptions about a day they consider to be one of their worst.  (Note:  Even though two of the following three examples have death as a theme, personal narratives and memoirs can just as easily be written about smaller, less dramatic events from one's life.)

'''Example 1:''' 
&lt;blockquote&gt;It was the worst day of my life, and it was only 10:00am. Sitting in my dorm room sobbing into the phone, my mom tried to calm me down. But she couldn't erase the pain and misery, hurt and disappointment I was currently feeling. What had gone wrong? Why was everyone against me? How would I get through the rest of the day... the week with my injuries? Let me start from the beginning.&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;
It was a cold, blustery day at Evangel University. I had spent the last few days preparing for a presentation for my Children's Literature class, and I would soon go to the preschool just down the road to teach a lesson for the preschoolers. I had made beautiful little magnetic snowflakes that the students could take home with them. The snowflakes went along with the story I'd be reading in about an hour.&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;
I was completely prepared and had spent a lot of time thinking through the lesson and carefully paying attention to detail. As I was about to leave, I recognized how miserably cold it was outside and wondered if I could find a ride, even though the preschool was actually on campus. I asked my roommate if I could borrow her car, knowing there was little chance since it was a leased vehicle and her dad had forbidden her to let anyone drive it. But I thought it wouldn't hurt to ask. She turned me down. She also wasn't able to take me because she had to go to class herself. She apologized, but didn't seem too sympathetic. (What really irked me was that I found out later that she had let her boyfriend borrow her car for a much longer drive than the one I needed to take! I've since forgiven her... I think.)&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;
Next I tried to call my brother, but couldn't get a hold of him. He was probably in class as well. Due to the early hour, most everyone was in class, so no one else was around to ask either. So I bundled up in my warmest, flannel-lined overalls and fur coat and trekked down to the preschool. The snow swirled around me in fury and I was near to tears with my own inner-fury at my roommate who could have helped me avoid this situation.&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;
Gladly arriving at the preschool, I barged in ready to teach my well-prepared lesson, only to discover that another classmate was there teaching her lesson. I couldn't believe it! I knew I had written down the correct date, but something went wrong. The regular teachers didn't have time to fill me in that day, so instead of teaching my beautifully created lesson, I left to trudge back up the hill in the angry snow. Tears streaming down my face, I arrived back at the dorm. I was wearing my clunky wooden clogs and ran up the stairs as I had done a thousand times before. But I slipped... &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;*&lt;/b&gt;&lt;font color=#555555&gt;&lt;em&gt;This example is a memoir because it's a slice of life as opposed to a complete autobiography. It shows a picture of one day in the life of this person. It is the emotional retelling of a story from the narrator's perspective. Notice that the narrator does not focus on relationships or events surrounding this one event, but just on the event itself. The focus is all of the details that caused this day to be the worst of this person's life. If other threads such as the relationship with the roommate or details about the Children's Literature class had been added, the focus would have been lost in the muddle of too many details. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font color=#555555&gt;&lt;em&gt;In a memoir, the focus must stay tight. Think of taking a picture with a camera. Think about what you want to be in the picture and what would distract from the picture. Have you ever taken a picture where there was a lot of white space at the top and what was supposed to be the focus: the people, are just tiny dots at the bottom? This is what happens to a story when the focus is too broad. See the [[Basic Writing/Invention]] section of this book wikitext for help on narrowing your topic. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Example 2:'''
&lt;blockquote&gt;On my worst day I was supposed to get up early so I could get out to my folks’ house on account that my mama needed me to help her take our old dog to the vet.  My mama needed my help because she’s not a very big person and our dog is really big.  She also has a bad knee.  My mama, I mean, not the dog.  Well anyway our dog is one of them Great Pyrenees, a great big white monster of a thing, and she’s got arthritis in her hips and spine something bad.  So my mama had to make an appointment to have her put down because our dog couldn’t even stand to eat or pee anymore.  That’s how bad off she was, you see.&lt;br&gt;  
&lt;br&gt;
So here I was supposed to get up early to help my mama load the dog into her car and my alarm doesn’t go off.  Luckily I wake up on my own and I’m not all that late yet so I hurry up and get dressed and run out of the house to my truck.  Then I take off towards my folks’ house kind of fast because I’m already behind schedule and I’m about half way there when all of a sudden I get a flat tire.  Making matters worse is the fact that it’s raining outside, been raining all night in fact and I guess that’s why my alarm didn’t work.  So I pull half into the ditch because the road doesn’t have a shoulder and of course the flat tire is on the passenger side which means that I have to work in the mud.  Even worse my little bottle jack won’t lift the truck on account it keeps sinking into the ground.  Well lately I’d had some bricks in the bed of my pick-up but when I go to get them out they aren’t there.  Now I’m pissed because I’m late, I’ve got a flat tire, I can’t get the jack to work because it’s raining and the ground is too soft, and some jackass has stolen a handful of worthless bricks from the bed of my truck.  This on top of the fact that our old dog’s got to be put down and my mama needs me to be there.  Still determined to make it, I root around in the ditch till I find a couple of rocks I can put under the jack.  I finally get my tire changed but by then I’m soaked to the bone and covered in mud, which means that I get my seat all wet and muddy too.&lt;br&gt;  
&lt;br&gt;
Finally I make it out to my folks’ place and my mama is sitting in the front yard with our dog and holding an umbrella over her.  I can plainly see that she’s in pretty bad shape, worse than the last time I saw her.  The dog, I mean, not my mama, although she’s looking pretty down herself.  She doesn’t bother to ask why I’m all wet and muddy, so I know things are bad for sure.  When I try to pick our old dog up to put her in the back of my mama’s Jimmy she yelps real loud and snaps at me.  I decided then and there that getting her to the vet wasn’t going to work.  She was too heavy and in too much pain to be messing with.  So I went and got my old red wagon out of my dad’s shop and carefully my mama and me lifted her onto it.&lt;br&gt;  
&lt;br&gt;
My mama knew what had to be done and so she says her goodbyes to our old dog.  Then I roll her slowly around the house to where we’ve buried other pets in the past and I dig a fairly large hole.  When I am finished I sit on the ground beside the old red wagon and talk to our dog for a bit, tell her what she’s meant to me all these years and that I am going to miss her.  I’d rather not say what happened after that other than I like to believe she understood it all and that it came as a relief to her.&lt;br&gt;  
&lt;br&gt;
When I get back to my place later I realize that I’d left in such a hurry earlier that I’d locked myself out of the house.  It had stopped raining by then, though, so I just sit for a while in a lawn chair there on my porch.  Then I look over and see the bricks still lying there where I’d stacked them a few days before and forgotten.  Suddenly I start laughing then and can’t stop, keep laughing till tears run down my cheeks.  Looking back on it now that seems pretty weird since it had been such a terrible day. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;*&lt;/b&gt;&lt;font color=#555555&gt;&lt;em&gt;This example, like the one above it, is also memoir.  It is similar in that it also describes a day in the writer's life and is necessarily limited only to those details that are relevant to the story and that move the narrative forward.  A good exercise, though, might be to examine how these two samples from the same genre are different.  Do both sound as if they are spoken by the same &quot;voice&quot;?  What details from each might you use to argue the speakers' gender?  Does either &quot;sound&quot; female/male?  Also note that Example 2 reads much more like spoken language--is that appropriate for this genre, or should the writer have written in a more academic or formal manner?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  

'''Example 3:'''

&lt;blockquote&gt;I was standing in the middle of Dollar Tree, leaning on my cart, when I said, &quot;What?&quot; to my mom telling me about my little black cat, Baby, being found dead a few days earlier.  &quot;Baby's dead, honey.&quot;  I couldn't say anything.  What could I say?  I had been the one to take her to the farm thinking that she would adjust and be happier as a farm cat.  Besides, I had too many cats, six actually, and Baby and Ginger had been the most logical choices to relocate. Both of them were unhappy living in such a small environment with four other cats.  Baby suffered from anxiety problems and Ginger just wanted more territory.  She was always so bitchy, hissing like she owned everything and everyone.  Adorable, yes, but incredibly bitchy.  Baby just wanted to be alone, or with me.  The only way I could get her to come out of hiding is if I'd sing to her - any song with her name in it.  Her favorite one was the one from the movie ''Dirty Dancing'' &quot;Ba-byyy, ohh-ohhh ba-byyy, my sweet ba-byyy, you're the one. . .&quot;  When I'd sing it to her, she'd roll 'on the floor and rub against me as if to say, &quot;I reeeaaallly love you!&quot;  I'll never be able to listen to that song without missing her now.  &lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
&quot;Honey, are you alright?&quot; my mom asked quietly.  No, I'm not alright.  I knew something was wrong.  I had a feeling several days ago - one of those feelings that tell you something is wrong, but I chose to ignore it.  &quot;How did she die?&quot;  I ask, trying to keep my emotions under control.  It's no use though, tears start streaking my face and Dollar Tree customers are beginning to stare.  &quot;They found her dead in the cabin,&quot; mom said, her voice choking, &quot;I'm so sorry, hon.&quot;  &quot;She was still in the cabin?!&quot; I practically shout into the phone.  &quot;I thought Laura picked her up to take her to her house.&quot;  Mom grew quiet.
After a few moments she said, &quot;They never could catch her.  Dad said that they looked for her every day.  They moved the furniture and everything but they couldn't find her.  Now they think that maybe she might have climbed behind the fridge to hide.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I was livid, but I knew it would just kill mom and dad if I blamed them for this.  Despite this fact, I had to ask one last question, &quot;Mom, why didn't you guys call me and tell me that you were having problems with her?  I could've come home to take care of her.  I told you that I smelled natural gas or something on the day that we dropped her off at the cabin.  Why didn't someone call me?!&quot;  At this point I was hysterical and customers were steering their shopping carts way around me.  When my mom finally answered her comforting voice was gone. Replacing it was one of defense and insensitivity.  &quot;We did the best we could!  Dad's been so depressed lately and this almost pushed him over the edge.  He knows how much you love your cats and he's blaming himself.  It's not his fault and it's not yours either!  Do you hear me?&quot; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
All I could do was cry.  I didn't want to hurt them, but I just couldn't understand why they chose not to call me.  And I do blame myself.  I knew that something was wrong, and knowing that she was alone in that cabin for two weeks, going through god knows what, thinking god knows what, well it just killed me inside.  I was filled with guilt.  I had rescued her as a baby, beaten and left for dead and now, seven years later I just pawn her off on someone else and she dies alone?  I don't even want to know how much pain she may have been in.  How in the world will I deal with the guilt of knowing that all of this could've been avoided?  How?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;*&lt;/b&gt;&lt;font color=#555555&gt;&lt;em&gt;This example is also similar to the above examples so the same comments apply.  It is a narrative memoir, however there are two elements within this memoir that set it apart from the above examples.  First of all, it includes dialogue which is somewhat tricky when writing.  The most important thing to remember is that dialogue should sound natural - like the voice of the person speaking.  Practice saying it out loud as if reading a script for an audition.  Also, when using dialogue make sure the reader can understand who is saying what.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Another element that was included in this example was a specific use of stylized writing during the recitation of Baby's favorite song and her response to that song.  This style of writing is becoming more popular in mainstream writing - especially comedic novels.  An example of this style of writing can be found throughout the novel, &lt;U&gt;The Nanny Diaries&lt;/U&gt;, by Emma McLaughlin and Nicola Kraus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">A common form of writing is a basic reading response paper. Short of an essay or longer thesis analyzing text, the '''summary''' and '''critique''' are often employed to identify details or provide support to a more lengthy assignment to the reading. Teachers assign summaries to ensure students' understanding of the reading material or build a composite of background knowledge for future assignment. When teachers assign critique, they are looking for a reaction to the reading material that involves specific detail.  Summary and critique are common elements in many assignments other than formal papers, including reading response journals, book reports, and essay exams.

==Summary==
;A basic report on a reading is a summary.
A summary is generally a shorter paper, detailing the action of a text. Summaries are used in order for you to prove you have read the text and have thought about the content. Since summaries are generally shorter works, they may be a part of a larger project in the course.

Students sometimes write summaries with their teacher in mind as the audience, although the teacher has read the text several times. However, when you write a summary, assume you are writing the paper for someone who has not read the book you are describing.

;Think about the type of text you are reading and take notes.
Make highlights. If you are reading a story, you will want to keep track of the order of events. If you are reading a persuasive article, you will want to keep track of main ideas and arguments.  These notes will make quick reference when it is time to write the summary.

;Assignment sheets can be helpful.
If you have an assignment sheet, look over the content carefully to see what the teacher expects. Your instructor may have listed a specific question that you need to answer or some specific issue for focus. If the instructor hasn't provided an assignment sheet, don't be afraid to ask questions to better understand what is expected of you.  Don’t go into the writing assignment without understanding of the expectations or guidelines (always ask!).

===Format===
In the summary, name or make reference to the text and the focus of your writing. For instance, if you are writing a paper summarizing the ''Odyssey'' with a focus on the conflict between Poseidon and Odysseus, consider this opening sentence:

:In the ''Odyssey'', Odysseus struggles against Poseidon in order to get back home.

This sentence makes direct reference to the assignment and the reading. The following summary will detail the action with a focus on the conflict of Odysseus and Poseidon. The teacher is aware of the focus since the topic is outlined in the opening sentence. The rest of the essay will be a summary of the action with reference to the opening sentence.

Here's an example of a complete (very brief) reading summary responding to the prompt, “Summarize the conflict between Odysseus and Poseidon in the ''Odyssey''.”

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the ''Odyssey'', Odysseus struggles against Poseidon to return to Ithaca. Zeus, at the request of Athena, calls for a consensus among the gods to allow Odysseus to return home safely.  Missing from the meeting atop Mt. Olympus is Poseidon who is still angry with Odysseus for blinding his son Polyphemus.  As Odysseus sails from the shores of the Cyclops Polyphemus prays to his father to bestow the curse that if Odysseus is to return home that it be many darks years before it happens.  Polyphemus curse is granted by Poseidon, his father, and the consequence for Odysseus’ action is to suffer wind, wave, and storm on his every return to sea for ten long years.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Always use specific names of places, people, and references in your writing as evidence to your teacher that you have read the material closely.  If you have time, it is never a bad idea to work through drafts to use more precise terms and language.  Develop your sentences by using sentence combining techniques to connect more ideas and details to your thoughts.

==Critique==
'''Critique is also called evaluation, analysis, or interpretation.''' Teachers will often ask for a response to a reading assignment which goes beyond summary, one which analyzes a text and explains why it works (or doesn't).  A summary is assigned to make sure you understand the reading, but for a critique you are showing your ability to think critically and make judgments about the assigned reading using details, support, evidence.

===Literary critique===
A literary critique is an analysis of a story or poem.

Sample assignment: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Critique Homer's presentation of courage in the ''Odyssey''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Format===

A good way to approach your critique is to begin with a thesis in order to layout your argument.  

Sample thesis: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;In Homer's ''Odyssey'', courage is the risk of self for ideals.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This thesis works as a statement that can be supported.  The sentence is put forward as a statement of argument to move forward with elaboration.  Notice this claim of courage can be supported by examples from the reading.

Supporting the thesis requires finding those details that support your claim.  Finding details can includes using notes, rereading the text, or class discussion to provide evidence to the claim of the thesis.  Any details should serve as direct evidence: quotes, summary, paraphrase in direct support to the thesis statement.

Samples of evidence: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;In direct reaction to Eurylochus's objection of possibly being consumed by Circe and saving themselves, Odysseus charges up to save his men who have been turned to pigs by the witch. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;To allow his men to escape the Sirens, he has his men tie him to the mast and endures the Siren song.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Even so, evidence by itself is insufficient.  Show how it fits together by providing explanation of your evidence to the thesis statement. 

Sample paragraph:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In Homer's ''Odyssey'', courage is the risk of self for ideals.   Odysseus puts the life of his crew before the concern for self in his actions.  In Eurylochus's return from the witch Circe, where twenty-three men have been lost to her sorcery, he reasons they should put out to sea in order to avoid further loss. Odysseus, without reservation, goes after his men (book 10).  His thought is for his men and not his self, similar to his selfless action of exposure to the Sirens' song.  As his men safely row past the harpies with beeswax in their ears, Odysseus endures the torturous song until they have gone a safe distance (book 12).  Homer presents Odysseus's courage as sacrifice for those important to him. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is a good practice to use quotations where the exact words are necessary.  Do not rely too heavily upon direct quotation, pure summary, or paraphrase - use explanation to show relationship between ideas.  This is where an assignment sheet or discussion with your teacher may be helpful to clarify the expectation.

===Argument critique===
In the academic world, argument doesn't mean fighting--it means making a point using reasoning.  The example above of the ''Odyssey'' analyzes literature rather than an argument.  Literary analysis may be familiar from high school assignments, but college assignments more frequently require you to analyze an argument--to critique someone's reasoning.  Instead of looking at plot, characters, and setting, you'll look at the author's reasons, evidence, and how it supports her main point.  Besides this, the process of analysis is much the same: you will need a thesis about the author's argument and supporting details drawn from their reasons and evidence.  

Although a good critique often starts with a relevant summary, keep in mind your goal--making your own point about the author's argument.  Also ask your professor whether you are supposed to take a side on the issue the author is arguing about.  Unless your instructor asks you to take a stance, concentrate on the author's presentation of the issue, not whether you agree with the stance he or she takes.  Remember, a person may have bad reasons for believing right things or good reasons for believing wrong things.  

Some elements to focus on:
*The writer's credibility: Does the writer seem reasonable?  Is she an expert in the field?
*Underlying assumptions: Does the writer seem to assume everyone holds her viewpoint?
*Emotional appeals: Does the author play on the reader's emotions?  Does that work?
*Evidence: Does the author have good reasons and examples to support her conclusion?
*Room for improvement: What would have made the argument more convincing?

Sample assignment: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Analyze one of the articles we read for this unit and explain whether or not the author does a good job making his or her case.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sample thesis: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Martin Luther King successfully defends himself against the criticisms of white clergymen through sensitivity to his audience.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Samples of evidence: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;King builds credibility by referring to the Bible.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;King concedes that his audience has good points.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sample paragraph:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In &quot;Letter from Birmingham Jail,&quot; Martin Luther King successfully defends himself against the criticisms of white clergymen through sensitivity to his audience.  He does this first by building his credibility as a fellow clergyman, quoting and alluding to the Bible throughout the letter.  He also avoids making his audience confrontational by conceding his reader's most reasonable points: King admits that negotiation is a better approach than protest, but he argues that negotiation isn't possible until people are willing to listen.  By setting himself up as a reasonable, Godly man, King does his best to gain the sympathy of the white clergy who opposed his methods.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Notice how the critique focuses on how King argues rather than whether he was right or wrong.  It also does more than simply summarize the letter--it makes a specific point about it and backs that point up with examples from the text.

==Conclusion==
After a whole process of content-writing, you still need to draw a natural and complete conclusion of what you've already written down to restate and strengthen your points of view with which the readers could get a better understanding of the  central idea of your paper.
Just make it a beautiful final stroke on your paper!

==Essay exams==
In many courses, you may find yourself asked to write an in-class essay, or essay exam.  An essay exam will often ask for a summary or critique of readings for the class, so the major techniques are the same.  The common &quot;five paragraph essay&quot; is at its most useful in the essay exam: write an introduction with a clear thesis, about three subpoints which prove or illustrate your point, and a conclusion that ties it all together.  This doesn't mean you can't be creative, but an essay exam is most different from take-home essays in the amount of time you have to work on it.  You can't do anything too complicated.  There are a few tips we can share with you to get through an essay exam:

*Many instructors will give you a list of possible questions on the test.  Study them!  There is no substitute for understanding the assigned reading.
*Find out if you are allowed to use your reading material or notes during the exam.  
**If you are allowed to use notes and the instructor has shared questions that may appear on the exam, write an outline for each question ahead of time.  You don't want to waste time during the actual exam trying to think of good examples.
**If you are not allowed to use notes, write outlines anyway.  Study them at home and review them before the exam.  You can write them down as soon as you begin the exam. (Even if the exam begins with multiple choice, you can turn it over and write it down before you forget.)
*Prewrite.  Think about the question and figure out what you want to say.
**If you already know the questions that will be on the exam, do your prewriting at home so you can spend more time writing during the exam.
**If you didn't know the questions ahead of time, read the question carefully and prewrite on a piece of scrap paper or on the exam itself.  (You can erase it afterward.)  Write an outline.
*Don't ramble.  Have a clear structure in mind before you start writing.  Stick to this outline.  
*After you finish, check to make sure your main point is clear and stays the same throughout the essay.  Remember, even a summary has a main point.
*If you are writing a critique, check to make sure your line of reasoning is clear and makes sense.  
*Fix major errors, but don't spend all your time on grammar--your instructor wants you to show you understand the material.

==Citations==
Don't forget about [http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/557/01/ citations]. When your writing refers to texts written by others, citations help the readers of your paper to locate the information from your source. When you don't cite your source, your reader assumes that everything you wrote came out our your own mind.  A basic rule of thumb with citations is that if the idea is not your own, you should cite the source. This will help protect you from plagiarism.  Consequences for plagiarism can be quite severe, so always ask your instructor for advice if you're not sure when or how to cite.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I cut this paragraph from the article:

:The ARM processor is a 32-bit RISC design. (Recent cores can dynamically switch between their 32-bit instruction set and an alternative 16-bit instruction set, which enables higher code density and therefore lower cost memory).

The Thumb instruction set is a &quot;32-bit design&quot; (even though it uses 16 bit instructions), in the same way that the Microchip PIC 16F877 is a &quot;8 bit design&quot;, even though it uses 14 bit instructions.

So Thumb mode has higher &quot;code density&quot; than native ARM mode?
I *suspect* that is true, but has anyone actually measured it?
And how does that measured code density compare to the code density of, say, the Freescale [[w:68k|68k]] or the Freescale PowerPC or the Freescale the Atmel AVR or the Microchip dsPIC ?
(Or, for that matter, using direct-threaded [[Forth]] or [[w:ARM_architecture#Jazelle | Jazelle]] or [[w:P-Code machine| p-code]] on top of native ARM code ?)

| name = Chinese Goose
| image = Anser cygnoides.jpg
| description = The Chinese Goose is a domesticated version of the Swan Goose.  Sexes are similar, although the male is larger. The voice is a loud honking. It grazes on sedges, and rarely swims. It forms small flocks outside the breeding season.  Some domesticated, introduced, or feral populations may be completely white. Some variations have a &quot;bump&quot; or &quot;knob&quot; at the top of the beak, which is more prominent on males than females. By 6–8 weeks of age, the knob is already pronounced enough that it can be used for sexing. A female goose usually lays 50–60 eggs over the course of the breeding season (February through June), although there are reports of Chinese geese laying up to 100 eggs during that time.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Rubik's cubes ==

Rubik's cubes are permutation puzzles. The design was originally invented by Ernő Rubik. The cube has 6 colored faces and the goal is to get the same color on each face. The Rubik's cube (3x3x3) was the best selling toy of the 20th century.

A permutation puzzle is a puzzle that has to be solved by changing its configuration or position by interchanging elements. Usually there are several ways to get to the solution.

| image =White Sebastopol Goose.jpg
| description = The Sebastopol is a medium-sized goose with long, white curly feathers. The feathers of the neck are greyish-brown and smooth. Feathers on the breast may be curly or smooth. It is best to avoid breeding two specimens both having curly breast feathers, as they will develop abnormal wings. The gander weighs 12-14 lbs while the goose weighs 10-12 lbs. The legs and shanks are orange and the eyes bright blue. The breed was developed in Europe along the Danube and the Black Sea. Sebastopols cannot fly well due to the curliness of their feathers. They need plenty of water in order to keep themselves clean.  For photos, see the following:

| name = Cape Barren Goose
| image = Cereopsis novaehollandiae1.jpg
| description = The Cape Barren Goose is a large goose resident in southern Australia.  These are bulky geese and their almost uniformly grey plumage, bearing rounded black spots, is unique. The tail and flight feathers are blackish and the legs are pink with black feet. The short, decurved black bill and green cere gives it a very peculiar expression.

The Cape Barren Goose is 75-100 cm long, and has a 150-190 cm wingspan; males are somewhat larger than females. The male weighs on average 5.29 kg and the female 3.77 kg.

This bird feeds by grazing and rarely swims. It forms small flocks outside the breeding season, when it wanders more widely.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Dealing with color in Flash is similar to dealing with color in other screen based applications. To begin, let's review some color basics. Color can be referred to as either reflective or transmissive. Reflective color is also known as subtractive color and can be described as red, yellow, and blue for the primary pigment colors, and green, orange and purple for the secondary pigment colors. These colors mix to produce black, or, more likely, a neutral gray or brown. Transmissive color is known as additive color. It is made up of red, green and blue, the three colors of transmissive light, which when mixed together create white light. The secondary additive colors are cyan, magenta and yellow, which, along with black, make up the process printing colors. An example of how transmissive light works would be to consider how we see grass as green, even though actually green is the channel of white light that gets retransmitted to our eye, and the red and blue light gets absorbed.

Flash, being a screen based application, uses transmissive light with the three additive primaries of red, green and blue. Since Flash is primarily a web creation tool, it must adhere to some standards for color usage on the web. For instance, monitors display color in RGB in an array of pixels in a grid. Each pixel has an address and can be made up of red, green and blue colored dots, or a mixture thereof. Each color channel, red, green or blue, can range in value from 0, completely off, to 255, completely on. Black is created from all channels being completely off; white is created from all channels being completely on. Each channel can have 256 different values creating almost unlimited color choices for the designer.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{WikiProject Languages}} 

can't you use the definite article with the plural in english? eg. &quot;I ate the oranges?&quot;

As for the link-verb &quot;to be&quot;.

1. It exists in present tense but it is not used. The only use is for emphasis (hardly ever), and even in this case usually it is formulated with verb &quot;''являться''&quot; (&quot;to be&quot;, but without meaning &quot;to be located at&quot;) followed by the Instrumental case: &quot;''Это является неприемлемым''&quot; (&quot;It is unacceptable&quot;). Sounds very bookish and even official, though :)
The verb &quot;''быть''&quot;(to be) itself has only one form for all persons in contemporary russian, and it is &quot;''есть''&quot; (sadly, the same as &quot;to eat&quot; infinitive in Russian). May be used in veeeery special cases, and I mean cases when the pure fact of its presenсe makes the text sound different.
 
It is not used in natural speech/text. Nevertheless, it should be kept in mind that people know this verb and this form in particluar, so it's not that it simply vanished. If you use this form, you will sound strange/old/master Yoda/evil lord came to conquer our world , but it won't be like &quot;I (strange verb) a student&quot;. If you see infinitive of the verb &quot;to eat&quot; in strange position, then perhaps it is someone speaking strange Russian with verb &quot;to be&quot; and food consuming has nothing to do with it :)))

And the articles simply do not exist. While &quot;to be&quot; just disappears in present tense, the concept of &quot;articles&quot; before words is not here at all. In fact, it is quite a tough part of Western-European languages for Russians, along with the tense systems common to these languages (while use of &quot;am/are/is/suis/es/est/...bin/bist....&quot; is no problem for even 7-8 year old kids at school).

2. While it is thought to be rule by many people, writing &quot;—&quot; between nouns in sentences like &quot;A is B&quot; is optional. It is important to stress that Russian rules concerning the dash in different positions and for different purposes have this &quot;intonation&quot; clause, i.e. it may be used to make accented &quot;pause&quot; in the sentence. And the rule on dash between subject and noun predicate is optional (&quot;...The dash also may be put between...&quot;) So in case you need a pause and some &quot;power&quot; in your statement or, perhaps, the sentence just looks messed up and not readable enough - then use it to separate subject (that in noun) from predicate (that is also noun). Usually it is 50/50, i.e. some people usually write dash, some prefer not to do it, some write and don't write depending on what they want... and some write simply because they forgot that dash is not obligatory ;)  --[[Special:Contributions/217.150.49.205|217.150.49.205]] ([[User talk:217.150.49.205|talk]]) 10:30, 7 October 2008 (UTC)

How could I forget...;) Also &quot;to be&quot; &lt;u&gt;is used (widely)&lt;/u&gt; in Russian in &quot;there is&quot;  sentences(&quot;''Здесь кто-то есть''&quot;, There is someone here) and in usual construction of posession. In Russian sentences similar to English, German etc. &quot;I have ...&quot; do exist, but are not usually used for this purpose. Even though the verb &quot;to have&quot; also is in language, the common model states posesion without this verb. Instead &quot;''У'' + genitive+ ''есть'' + smth&quot; is used. So &quot;I have a book&quot; would literally be something like &quot;There is a book at me&quot;: &quot;''У меня есть книга''&quot; (formed as a statement that something exists &quot;close to its owner&quot;).  --[[Special:Contributions/217.150.49.205|217.150.49.205]] ([[User talk:217.150.49.205|talk]]) 12:19, 7 October 2008 (UTC)

Dash in &quot;A is B&quot; has never been optional! Read the rules. http://www.gramota.ru/spravka/rules/?rub=tire</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{book title|An Open Source Handbook of Web Science}}

A new academic field in computer science has emerged called 
[[w:Web_science | ''Web Science'']] with its first text published by Philip Tetlow in 2007&lt;ref name=&quot;firstArt&quot;&gt;
Philip D. Tetlow,
''The Webs Awake (An Introduction to the Field of Web Science and the Concept of Web Life)'', 
[[http://www.thewebsawake.com]].
&lt;/ref&gt;. It now has its own journal and an inaugural article about the field by
Tim Berners-Lee, Wendy Hall, James A. Hendler, Kieron O'Hara,
Nigel Shadbolt  and Daniel J. Weitzner
&lt;ref name=&quot;secondArt&quot;&gt;
Tim Berners-Lee, Wendy Hall, James A. Hendler, Kieron O'Hara,
Nigel Shadbolt  and Daniel J. Weitzner,
''Foundations and Trends in Web Science'',
Volume 1 Issue 1, 
[[http://www.nowpublishers.com/product.aspx?product=WEB&amp;doi=1800000001&amp;section=xstart]].
&lt;/ref&gt;

It is thought that as the field is so new an interesting project would be to 
develop an open source text book here as the field emerges so that there will be free access
to information and techniques from the beginning.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{LaTeX/Top}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;
Especially useful in printed books, an index is an alphabetical list of words and expressions with the pages of the book upon which they are to be found. LaTeX supports the creation of indices with its package {{LaTeX/Package|makeidx}}, and its support program &lt;code&gt;makeindex&lt;/code&gt;, called on some systems &lt;code&gt;makeidx&lt;/code&gt;.

== Using &lt;tt&gt;makeidx&lt;/tt&gt; ==
To enable the indexing feature of LaTeX, the {{LaTeX/Package|makeidx}} package must be loaded in the [[LaTeX/Document Structure#Preamble|preamble]] with:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage{makeidx}
}}

and the special indexing commands must be enabled by putting the
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\makeindex
}}

command into the input file preamble. This should be done within the preamble, since it tells LaTeX to create the files needed for indexing. To tell LaTeX what to index, use
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\index{key}
}}

where ''key'' is the index entry and does not appear in the final layout. You enter the index commands at the points in the text that you want to be referenced in the index, likely near the reason for the ''key''. For example, the text
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
To solve various problems in physics, it can be advantageous
to express any arbitrary piecewise-smooth function as a
Fourier Series composed of multiples of sine and cosine functions.
}}
can be re-written as
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
To solve various problems in physics, it can be advantageous
to express any arbitrary piecewise-smooth function as a Fourier Series
\index{Fourier Series}
composed of multiples of sine and cosine functions.
}}
to create an entry called 'Fourier Series' with a reference to the target page. Multiple uses of ''\index'' with the same ''key'' on different pages will add those target pages to the same index entry.


To show the index within the document, merely use the command
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\printindex
}}
It is common to place it at the end of the document. The default index format is two columns.


The {{LaTeX/Package|showidx}} package that comes with LaTeX prints out all index entries in the right margin of the text. This is quite useful for proofreading a document and verifying the index.

=== Compiling indices ===
When the input file is processed with LaTeX, each {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\index}} command writes an appropriate index entry, together with the current page number, to a special file. The file has the same name as the LaTeX input file, but a different extension (&lt;code&gt;.idx&lt;/code&gt;). This &lt;code&gt;.idx&lt;/code&gt; file can then be processed with the &lt;code&gt;makeindex&lt;/code&gt; program. Type in the command line:

 &lt;tt&gt;makeindex&lt;/tt&gt; ''filename''

Note that ''filename'' is without extension: the program will look for ''filename.idx'' and use that. You can optionally pass ''filename.idx'' directly to the program as an argument. The &lt;code&gt;makeindex&lt;/code&gt; program generates a sorted index with the same base file name, but this time with the extension &lt;code&gt;.ind&lt;/code&gt;. If now the LaTeX input file is processed again, this sorted index gets included into the document at the point where LaTeX finds {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\printindex}}.

The index created by latex with the default options may not look as nice or as suitable as you would like it. To improve the looks of the index &lt;code&gt;makeindex&lt;/code&gt; comes with a set of style files, usually located somewhere in the tex directory structure, usually below the &lt;code&gt;makeindex&lt;/code&gt; subdirectory. To tell &lt;tt&gt;makeindex&lt;/tt&gt; to use a specific style file, run it with the command line option:

  &lt;tt&gt;makeindex&lt;/tt&gt; -s &lt;style file&gt; ''filename''

If you use a GUI for compiling latex and index files, you may have to set this in the options. Here are some configuration tips for typical tools:
==== MakeIndex settings in WinEdt  ====
Say you want to add an index style file named &lt;code&gt;simpleidx.ist&lt;/code&gt;
* Texify/PDFTexify: Options→Execution Modes→Accessories→PDFTeXify, add to the Switches: &lt;code&gt;--mkidx-option=&quot;-s simpleidx.ist&quot;&lt;/code&gt;
* MakeIndex alone: Options→Execution Modes→Accessories→MakeIndex, add to command line: &lt;code&gt;-s simpleidx.ist&lt;/code&gt;

=== Sophisticated indexing ===
Below are examples of {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\index}} entries:

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!Example
!Index Entry
!Comment
|-
|{{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\index{hello}&lt;!----&gt;}}
|hello, 1
|Plain entry
|-
|{{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\index{hello!Peter}&lt;!----&gt;}}
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Peter, 3
|Subentry under 'hello'
|-
|{{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\index{hello!Sam@\textsl{Sam}&lt;!----&gt;}&lt;!----&gt;}}
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''Sam'', 2
|Subentry formatted and sorted
|-
|{{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\index{Sam@\textsl{Sam}&lt;!----&gt;}&lt;!----&gt;}}
|''Sam'', 2
|Formatted entry
|-
|{{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\index{Lin@\textbf{Lin}&lt;!----&gt;}&lt;!----&gt;}}
|'''Lin''', 7
|Same as above
|-
|{{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\index{Jenny{{!}}textbf}&lt;!----&gt;}}

|école, 4

|{{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\index{Peter{{!}}see {hello}&lt;!----&gt;}&lt;!----&gt;}}
|Peter, ''see'' hello
|Cross-references
|-
|{{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\index{Jen{{!}}seealso{Jenny}&lt;!----&gt;}&lt;!----&gt;}}
|Jen, ''see also'' Jenny
|Same as above
|}

==== Subentries ====
If some entry has subsections, these can be marked off with &lt;code&gt;!&lt;/code&gt;. For example,
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\index{encodings!input!cp850}
}}
would create an index entry with 'cp850' categorized under 'input' (which itself is categorized into 'encodings'). These are called subsubentries and subentries in makeidx terminology.

==== Controlling sorting ====
In order to determine how an index key is sorted, place a value to sort by before the key with the &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt; as a separator. This is useful if there is any formatting or math mode, so one example may be
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\index{F@$\vec{F}$}
}}
so that the entry in the index will show as '&lt;math&gt;\vec{F}&lt;/math&gt;' but be sorted as 'F'.

To combine with the above feature for subentries, you should style the appropriate component(s):
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\index{bug reports!In re code@\emph{In re} code}

\index{LaTeX@\LaTeX!Typesetting engine}
}}

==== Changing page number style ====
To change the formatting of a page number, append a &lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt; and the name of some command which does the formatting. This command should only accept one argument.

For example, if on page 3 of a book you introduce bulldogs and include the command
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\index{bulldog}
}}
and on page 10 of the same book you wish to show the main section on bulldogs with a bold page number, use
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\index{bulldog{{!}}textbf}
}}
This will appear in the index as
bulldog, 3, '''10'''

If you use &lt;code&gt;texindy&lt;/code&gt; in place of &lt;code&gt;makeindex&lt;/code&gt;, the classified entries will be sorted too, such that all the bolded entries will be placed before all others by default.

==== Multiple pages ====
To perform multi-page indexing, add a &lt;code&gt;|(&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;|)&lt;/code&gt; to the end of the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\index}} command, as in
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\index{Quantum Mechanics!History{{!}}(}
In 1901, Max Planck released his theory of radiation dependant on quantized energy.
While this explained the ultraviolet catastrophe in the spectrum of 
blackbody radiation, this had far larger consequences as the beginnings of quantum mechanics.
...
\index{Quantum Mechanics!History{{!}})}
}}
The entry in the index for the subentry 'History' will be the range of pages between the two {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\index}} commands.

==== Using special characters ====
In order to place values with &lt;code&gt;!&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt;, which are otherwise escape characters, in the index, one must quote these characters in the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\index}} command by putting a double quotation mark (&lt;code&gt;&quot;&lt;/code&gt;) in front of them, and one can only place a &lt;code&gt;&quot;&lt;/code&gt; in the index by quoting it (i.e., a key for &quot; would be {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\index{&quot;&quot;}&lt;!----&gt;}}).

This rule does not hold for \&quot;, so to put the letter ä in the index, one may still use {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\index{a@\&quot;{a}&lt;!----&gt;}&lt;!----&gt;}}.

== Abbreviation list ==

You can make a list of abbreviations with the package {{LaTeX/Package|nomencl}} [http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/nomencl/].
You may also be interested in using the {{LaTeX/Package|glossaries}} package described in the [[LaTeX/Glossary|Glossary]] chapter.

To enable the Nomenclature feature of LaTeX, the {{LaTeX/Package|nomencl}} package must be loaded in the preamble with:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage[⟨options ⟩]{nomencl}
\makenomenclature
}}

Issue the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\nomenclature[⟨preﬁx⟩]{⟨symbol⟩}{⟨description⟩}&lt;!----&gt;}} command for each symbol you want to have included in the nomenclature list. The best place for this command is immediately after you introduce the symbol for the ﬁrst time. Put {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\printnomenclature}} at the place you want to have your nomenclature list. 

Run LaTeX 2 times then

 &lt;tt&gt;makeindex&lt;/tt&gt; ''filename.nlo''  -s nomencl.ist -o ''filename.nls''

followed by running LaTeX once again.

To add the abbreviation list to the table of content, {{LaTeX/Parameter|intoc}} option can be used when declare the {{LaTeX/Package|nomencl}} package,  i.e. {{LaTeX/Usage|code=\usepackage[intoc]{nomencl} }} instead of using the code in [[#Adding Index to Table Of Contents|Adding Index to Table Of Contents]] section.

The title of the list can be changed using the following command:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=\renewcommand{\nomname}{List of Abbreviations}
}}

== Multiple indices ==

If you need multiple indices you can use the package {{LaTeX/Package|multind}} [http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=multind]. 

This package provides the same commands as {{LaTeX/Package|makeidx}}, but now you also have to pass a name as the first argument to every command.
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage{multind}
\makeindex{books}
\makeindex{authors}
...
\index{books}{A book to index}
\index{authors}{Put this author in the index}
...
\printindex{books}{The Books index}
\printindex{authors}{The Authors index}
}}

== Adding index to table of contents ==

By default, Index won't show in Table Of Contents, so you have to add it manually.

To add index as a chapter, use these commands:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\clearpage
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Index}
\printindex
}}

If you use the book class, you may want to start it on an odd page by using {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\cleardoublepage}}.

== International indices ==
If you want to sort entries that have international characters (such as ő, ą, ó, ç, etc.) you may find that the sorting &quot;is not quite right&quot;. In most cases the characters are treated as special characters and end up in the same group as @, ¶ or µ. In most languages that use Latin alphabet it's not correct.

=== Generating index ===
&lt;small&gt;Unfortunately, current version of &lt;code&gt;xindy&lt;/code&gt; and {{LaTeX/Package|hyperref}} are incompatible. When you use {{LaTeX/Parameter|textbf}} or {{LaTeX/Parameter|textit}} modifiers, &lt;code&gt;texindy&lt;/code&gt; will print error message:&lt;code&gt;unknown cross-reference-class `hyperindexformat'! (ignored)&lt;/code&gt; and won't add those pages to index. Work-around for this bug is described on the [[Talk:LaTeX/Indexing#Texindy, hyperref and textbf, textit modifiers|talk page]].&lt;/small&gt;

To generate international index file you have to use &lt;code&gt;texindy&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;makeindex&lt;/code&gt;.

[http://xindy.sourceforge.net/ xindy] is a much more extensible and robust indexing system than the &lt;code&gt;makeindex&lt;/code&gt; system.

For example, one does not need to write:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\index{Lin@\textbf{Lin}&lt;!----&gt;}&lt;!----&gt;}}
to get the &lt;tt&gt;Lin&lt;/tt&gt; entry after &lt;tt&gt;LAN&lt;/tt&gt; and before &lt;tt&gt;LZA&lt;/tt&gt;, instead, it's enough to write
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\index{\textbf{Lin}&lt;!----&gt;}
}}

But what is much more important, it can properly sort index files in many languages, not only English. 

Unfortunately, generating indices ready to use by &lt;tt&gt;LaTeX&lt;/tt&gt; using &lt;code&gt;xindy&lt;/code&gt; is a bit more complicated than with &lt;code&gt;makeindex&lt;/code&gt;.

First, we need to know in what encoding the &lt;tt&gt;.tex&lt;/tt&gt; project file is saved. In most cases it will be UTF-8 or ISO-8859-1, though if you live, for example in Poland it may be ISO-8859-2 or CP-1250. Check the parameter to the &lt;code&gt;inputenc&lt;/code&gt; package.

Second, we need to know which language is prominently used in our document. &lt;tt&gt;xindy&lt;/tt&gt; can natively sort indices in Albanian, Belarusian, Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Esperanto, Estonian, Finnish, French, Georgian, German, Greek, Gypsy, Hausa, Hebrew, Hungarian, Icelandic, Italian, Klingon, Kurdish, Latin, Latvian, Lithuanian, Macedonian, Mongolian, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbian Slovak, Slovenian, Sorbian, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish, Ukrainian and Vietnamese,

I don't know if other languages have similar problems, but with Polish, if your &lt;code&gt;.tex&lt;/code&gt; is saved using UTF-8, the &lt;code&gt;.ind&lt;/code&gt; produced by texindy will be encoded in ISO-8859-2 if you use only &lt;code&gt;-L polish&lt;/code&gt;.
While it's not a problem for entries containing polish letters, as LaTeX internally encodes all letters to plain ASCII, it is for accented letters at beginning of words, they create new index entry groups, if you have, for example an &quot;średnia&quot; entry, you'll get a &quot;Ś&quot; encoded in ISO-8859-2 &lt;code&gt;.ind&lt;/code&gt; file.
LaTeX doesn't like if part of the file is in UTF-8 and part is in IS-8859-2.
The obvious solution (adding &lt;code&gt;-C utf8&lt;/code&gt;) doesn't work, &lt;code&gt;texindy&lt;/code&gt; stops with
 ERROR: Could not find file &quot;tex/inputenc/utf8.xdy&quot;
error.
The fix this, you have to load the definiton style for the headings using &lt;code&gt;-M switch&lt;/code&gt;:
 -M lang/polish/utf8

In the end we have to run such command:
 texindy -L polish -M lang/polish/utf8 ''filename.idx''

Additional way to fix this problem is use &quot;iconv&quot; to create utf8.xdy from latin2.xdy 
 &lt;code&gt; iconv -f latin2 -t utf8 latin2.xdy &gt;utf8.xdy &lt;/code&gt;
in folder 
 &lt;code&gt;  /usr/share/xindy/tex/inputenc &lt;/code&gt;
(You must have root privileges)


==== xindy in kile ====
To use &lt;code&gt;texindy&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;makeindex&lt;/code&gt; in kile, you have to either redefine the MakeIndex tool in Settings → Configure Kile... → Tools → Build, or define new tool and redefine other tools to use it (for example by adding it to QuickBuild).

The &lt;code&gt;xindy&lt;/code&gt; definition should look similar to this:
 General:
  Command: texindy
  Options: -L polish -M lang/polish/utf8 -I latex '%S.idx'
 Advanced:
  Type: Run Outside of Kile
  Class: Compile
  Source extension: idx
  Target extension: ind
  Target file: &lt;empty&gt;
  Relative dir: &lt;empty&gt;
  State: Editor
 Menu:
  Add tool to Build menu: Compile
  Icon: the one you like

'''Character Palette''' is an applet that displays a set of special characters in the panel, to allow characters which are missing from the currently configured keyboard to be inserted wherever text may be typed.

To insert a character, click on the desired character in the panel. This will copy the character into the clipboard. It may then be pasted into the text being typed (by CTRL-V, or the middle mouse button, for example).

To change the characters available for insertion, click on the caret (^)&amp;nbsp;— or caron (v), if the applet is on the upper panel&amp;nbsp;— at the start of the list and pick another palette of characters from those displayed. 

To configure the applet, right-click on that part of the panel, and select Properties. This will allow new palettes of characters to be added, and existing palettes to be edited or removed. There is no special method for entering characters into these palettes; you will have to paste them from somewhere, or know the keyboard shortcut for the relevant Unicode or ASCII character.

As of version 2.14.3, there is no mechanism to change the order in which the palettes of characters are shown in the pull-down list.  The configuration file, called &lt;code&gt;%gconf.xml&lt;/code&gt;, is stored in &lt;code&gt;~/.gconf/apps/panel/applets/applet_X/prefs&lt;/code&gt;, where X is the index of the applet.  The file can be edited with a text editor to move character palettes up or down the list.  Each entry is contained within XML list tags (&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;li&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;).  Initially, the file will not be populated with the complete list of palette entries, until at least one entry is edited through the Properties dialog, as described above.  After moving the palette entry and saving the XML file, it is necessary to exit and restart one's GNOME session, or restart the machine before the change becomes visible in the Character Palette pop-up list.

If the Character Palette applet is removed from the panel, upon re-installation on the panel it will be reset to the default palettes and previous customizations will be lost.  It is also likely that the configuration file will appear in a different path under &lt;code&gt;.../applets/&lt;/code&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|Why do we need health and physical education in our schools?}}

In an age where video games, the Internet, television, and fast food hamburgers permeate every tier of American society, it becomes increasingly more important for Americans to be aware of their food choices and to make a concerted effort to incorporate more physical activity in their day-to-day lives.  However, the increasing numbers of obese men, women, and children in our society suggest that Americans are unaware of how unhealthy habits will affect them or perhaps Americans lack the motivation or know-how to fix these habits.   We, as educators, are in a unique position.  Our schools can provide health knowledge and exposure to physical activity by integrating them into the curriculum.  The benefits will not only help our students maintain a healthy lifestyle but also help them academically.

==The Facts of Life…==
The benefits of a healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise, reach well beyond maintaining a healthy weight.  The very workings of our body, both physical and mental, are affected by the diet and exercise choices we make everyday.  The organization, Trust for America’s Health, determined in their 2007 report that, “Twenty-two states experienced an increase [in adult obesity rates] for the second year in a row; no states decreased.  A new public opinion survey featured in the report finds 85 percent of Americans believe that obesity is an epidemic.” (Trust for America’s Health, 2007, paragraph 1)  How do we address this problem as teachers?  What can be done to keep America healthy?

By teaching our children about their health and exposing them to physical activity, educators may hold an important key to changing the future health of America.  Forty-one million kids participate in organized, extracurricular youth sports like soccer, basketball, and lacrosse. (Trickey, 2006)  These kids help to balance the rate of obesity in American children but the rate is still alarmingly high.  “The rates of overweight children (ages 10 to 17) ranged from a high of 22.8 percent in Washington, D.C. to a low of 8.5 percent in Utah.” (Trust for America’s Health, 2007, paragraph 3)  However, organized sports can be expensive to play and therefore, a number of parents cannot afford for their children to participate.  This is one reason why it is essential that schools incorporate physical activity in the curriculum.

==Let’s Get Physical (Education, that is!)==
Physical activity is important.  Schools have a vested interest and responsibility to provide for the well-being of their students.  The following list includes a few of the most important physical reasons why we as educators should be concerned about the health of our students:

* “Regular physical activity is associated with enhanced health and reduced risk for all-cause mortality.” (CDC, 2001, paragraph 2)
* “Lack of physical activity, as well as dietary factors contribute to an estimated 300,000 deaths in the United States each year.” (Seefeldt, 1998, p.117)
* “Beyond the effects on mortality, physical activity has multiple health benefits, including reducing the risk for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, selected cancers, and musculoskeletal conditions.” (CDC, 2001, paragraph 2)

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;50%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFF7F7;
border: solid 1px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;[http://youtube.com/watch?v=yvTN9jWFy9A  Cool YouTube video on why we need physical education in school!]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

Our job as educators is to teach our students knowledge and life skills that will help them in the future.  Teachers should be alarmed at the increase in the number of obese children.  “First, overweight and obese students will inevitably miss more school days for medical reasons. These absences will mean that the students will have to catch up on material, increasing their risk of not fully understanding it and slowing down the speed at which teachers can advance to new topics. Second, when these students are in class, many will lack the energy to sustain the concentration needed to process new information.” (Yaussi, 2005, p. 1)  Teaching, encouraging, and promoting physical activity is not outside the realm of the classroom.  

As educators we are providing a service for the American public.  As a result, we should be aware of what parents want their children to gain from their education.  “Not surprisingly, nearly all (99%) adults with children in the household (aged 6-17) feel that it is important for the child to be physically fit, with 80% believing this to be extremely important.” (National Association for Sport and Physical Education, 2000, p. 5)  The National Parent Teacher Organization (PTA) has a Resolution posted on their website urging local PTAs to “… support daily physical education programs as an integral part of children’s education.” (PTA, n.d.)  Parents not only want their children to be physically fit but they want them to engage in physical activity at school.  

This shared concern for student well-being among parents and educators serves as the basis for a collaboration to provide physical education for students at school.  There are professionals within in a school, including physical educators, school nurses, and guidance counselors, that can help ensure that students’ physical education objectives are being met. 
 
&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;50%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFF7F7;

If effective physical education is achieved in our schools, the benefits can span not only a student’s physical health but also their academics.  “Research indicates that physical activity enhances brain function and produces many cognitive and physiological benefits.” (Tremarche, Robinson, Graham, 2001, paragraph 4)  Researchers created a study in two Massachusetts elementary schools to measure the impact of increased quality Physical Education time on Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System (MCAS) standardized scores.  They gave the MCAS test to 311 fourth graders in two comparable Southeastern Massachusetts communities below the state’s average per pupil expenditure within a two month period between April and May 2001. The participants were tested in Math and English and Language Arts (ELA).  “Results of the study revealed that the mean ELA MCAS score for School 1 and the mean ELA MCAS score for School 2 were significantly different…In conclusion, students who received more hours of quality physical education per school year scored higher in the ELA subject area of the MCAS standardized test.” (Tremarche, Robinson, Graham, 2001, paragraph 1)  If the results of this study are true and apply to other schools in other areas, then physical education has the added benefit of increasing the important standardized tests scores associated with No Child Left Behind.  

Another study conducted in the state of Virginia explored the hypothesis that reducing the amount of time in related arts periods (art, music, P.E., etc.) would raise standardized test scores.  Researchers collected data from 547 Virginia elementary school principals who completed a survey indicating the time specialists taught art, music, and physical education in their schools. After controlling for cultural and social differences between the schools, “… findings from the study do not support the notion that a reduced time allocation to art, music, and physical education is related to higher test scores.” (Wilkins, Graham, Westfall, Fraser, Tembo, 2003)  Therefore, reducing the amount of time students spend in related arts, classes that according to brain-based research are believed to enhance a student’s academics, does not produce higher test scores.

==Health is Academic==
Physical education is just a part of the larger health curriculum that should be present within our schools.  The two work hand-in-hand when they include both the health benefits of physical activity and behavioral skills such as decision making, planning, problem solving, as well as enhancing student self esteem and confidence. (Seefeldt, 1998, p.128)  Also, providing students with the knowledge to obtain healthy eating habits helps in promoting a future filled with physically fit youth in America.  

Another important aspect of health comes in recognizing who influences children’s eating behaviors.  It is a common misconception that parents have powerful influence over children’s development of food preference.  Very little correlation exists between parent and child preferences.  However, parents do control what foods are available in the cupboards, and should make an effort to promote healthy foods by making them easily accessible and readily available for children.
If children are not inheriting their tastes from their family members, then where are they learning their food preferences?  The answer:  from their peers.  Evolutionary biology makes two suggestions as to why peer influence is more powerful than adult influence in shaping food preference (Cooke, Wardle, &amp;Bigson, 2003).
1.)	“Young children’s reluctance to sample new foods, most notably vegetables, is biologically wired” (Lumeng 76).  This is linked to the concept that it is advantageous for human species’ survival for the young to be reluctant to eat unfamiliar plant life, due to the fact that plants can often be poisonous.  Therefore, children determine what to eat by observing others around them.
2.)	“Modeling eating behavior after peers may provide young children with some survival advantage” (Lumeng 76).  Nutritional needs of young children are more similar to those of others in the same age group than to those of full-grown adults.  An example of this comes from recognizing that children’s bodies are smaller and are less able to protect against infection, such as in the case of consuming iron; quantities which are essential for adults are toxic for children.

Health contributes to a student’s academics.  “An optimally healthy student is more likely than a less healthy student to succeed in school.” (Wooley and Rubin, 2006, p.63)  School health programs promote healthy eating, getting sufficient sleep, and engaging in physical activity to achieve optimal health and thus good grades.  Wooley and Rubin also suggest that physical fitness, social-emotional health, and academics are inseparable.  Teaching students to be emotionally healthy allows students to “… express a wide range of feelings in culturally acceptable and effective ways and thus[,] function well in the classroom and in life.” (Wooley and Rubin, 2006, p.63)  With an estimated one in four students in the United States ages 10-17 at extreme risk for drug use, engaging in early, unprotected intercourse, participating in dangerous and criminal activities, experiencing depression or post-traumatic stress, or dropping out of school, it becomes apparent that health education is needed to inform our students of the risks and hopefully deter them from becoming a statistic. (Wooley and Rubin, 2006, p.64)  The optimal result of effective health education should be healthy students that are functional, well-behaved adults in the future.

==What Can We Do?==
We, as educators, can help to promote a healthy student body that will result in healthy, future adults.  It is through the cooperation of parents, teachers, administrators, school boards, and politicians that we can provide successful physical and health education.  By providing a quality curriculum through all levels of schooling, students can benefit physically, emotionally, socially, and academically.  

But providing for the health and physical fitness of our youth is not just the job of the Health and P.E. teachers.  Sarah Yaussi in her article, The Obesity Epidemic: How Non-P.E. Teachers Can Improve the Health of Their Students, suggests that regular classroom teachers can also help directly in the creation of healthy students within their classroom.  
We, as teachers, should serve as a role model for our students and exhibit healthy habits to our students.  This includes using our classrooms as a place to “… simultaneously promote hands-on learning and physical activity.” (Yaussi, 2005, p. 1)  Hiba Shublak, a fitness expert, has shown teachers an activity that can be used at the middle school and high school level to teach math skills through hip hop moves.  Students create dance moves in different multiple counts or beats, thus utilizing math skills, and then show their dance to the class.  The students then participate in a writing activity to reflect on the activity. (Yaussi, 2005, p. 1)  Physical activity and academic material then occur simultaneously within a classroom.  Through our creativity, we can create our own activities that involve our students getting out of their chairs to learn as well as keeping our students healthy.

Some students may not care about physical education, or even their physical well being. As their educators, we need to explain why physical education is important. Many high school students come to believe that becoming a physical education teacher is a joke. They think that since P.E. classes never have a text book, they aren’t learning anything important. They don’t realize that the period they spend in P.E. could be the only thing keeping them from being extremely overweight or obese. Physical education classes might even be the only physical activity that some children get. It seems that the “education” part of these classes is often forgotten. If the educators would explain to the students why they are doing jumping jacks and that jogging around the track regularly could save their lives, the students might be more likely to participate. In an article regarding youth fitness, pro football player Eli Manning was quoted as saying “It amazes me that physical education isn’t a requirement in some schools. These kids need physical activity in their lives for health reasons” (Crouse). Maybe if more students heard this type of thing from their teachers, there wouldn’t be as much of an obesity epidemic.

{{question-answer|question=How would you promote physical activity in your classroom?  How would this benefit the students?
|answer=I would promote physical activity in my classroom by incorporating activities that required movement throughout the school day.  First thing in the morning after my students have arrived and announcements are over, I want my students to do some light aerobic exercise.  When I worked as a teacher in an elementary school in South Carolina, the school district provided each school with a DVD that contained a kids' exercise program on it.  It had different aerobics workouts that lasted about five minutes each.  It really helped the kids wake up their bodies so they were more alert and ready to learn.  

I would also use filler activities, for when my class had to wait for another class to move out of a classroom or wait for an assembly to start, that would require some movement.  We would play Simon Says or a game that required some quiet movements.  This will not only keep my kids occupied and out of trouble but also keep their brains working while doing something fun.

Also, I want to include some physical activity into my curriculum if possible.  An example of this would be having the kids create a dance to remember the different parts of the body or a game that required the students to point to the correct body part called out by the teacher.  This would not only meet SOLs but also give the students a different way to remember the information while encouraging physical activity.
----
First, to promote physical activity in the classroom, I would begin each day with some form of physical activity for the students to perform for about five minutes.  This could include stretching, jumping jacks, or dancing; basically anything to make sure students are all alert, awake, and ready for the day.  Then I would include physical activity throughout the day by taking five-minute breaks between lessons or at five minutes to the hour, whichever came first.  This would give the students a nice, but short break to help refresh everyone’s minds.  This would be similar to the morning activity, such as jumping jacks, marching around the classroom, or stretching.  I would also try and incorporate physical activity into other lessons, such as math.  For example, if the math lesson was about measuring units, students could do a physical activity relating to the units.  For example, if the teacher asked how many quarts equaled a gallon, students would do four jumping jacks.

By promoting physical activity in the classroom, students are able to stay focused and alert during school hours.  This not only benefits the learning capacity of students, but it benefits teachers as well.  Teachers are able to cover more material because students are able to pay closer attention.  Students also learn the importance of physical activity and will hopefully continue to stay active throughout their lives.  By staying active, students receive the short-term benefits during school and also acquire long-term benefits as well.  These include a reduced risk of chronic disease, such as heart disease, Type II diabetes, lower cholesterol and a reduced risk of hypertension. &amp;mdash;Katie Irby}}

== Merge Mesh Modeling with Learn to Model? ==

I think the &quot;Mesh Modeling&quot; content is useful, but shouldn't we be introducing new Blender users to the basics of mesh modeling and the terms associated with it ''before'' giving them the first exercise that uses them? Right now, this &quot;Learn to Model&quot; section has little to no content and it's right before the first modeling exercise, I think the Mesh Modeling page's content would be a better fit here then where it is now. --[[User:Null Point|Null Point]] ([[User talk:Null Point|talk]]) 10:01, 9 February 2009 (UTC)</text>

What exactly is the Shift+E doing? Is there a button equivalent? [[User:70.53.43.119|70.53.43.119]] 17:30, 29 April 2007 (UTC)

I am sorry, but I don't understand how to select the cube in the New empty scene.

Where do I find the &quot;Select Mesh → Edges → Crease SubSurf.&quot; controls?
:The article reads create a crease subsurf by *either* using Shift+E or &quot;Select Mesh -&gt; Edges -&gt; Crease SubSurf&quot;... I'm using Blender 2.43 and I hit space to bring up the menu Edit-&gt;Edges-&gt;Create SubSurf...

&quot;First, select the cube by clicking RMB (right mouse button) on the cube in the 3D window (pink outlines indicate the selected objects). In other versions of Linux you accomplish this by clicking LMB (left mouse button)&quot;

[[User:Rhettro|Rhettro]] ([[User talk:Rhettro|talk]]) 21:52, 10 June 2010 (UTC)As a tutorial, I think it is fine, just a little advanced for an entry level modeling exercise.  Why introduce the concept of SubSurf modeling so early?  A simple chair model, by using extrude, subdiving faces and adding and subtracting vertices from edges would serve to reinforce the use of the basic modeling tools.  

== Rendering tips section ==

Why are these here?

First off, &quot;Set your render level&quot; to....? to ?  oh just set it? well it has a default setting, so does that mean I have to change it from the default? Why not make that the new default? What are the levels? What do they do? is higher Better (clearer)? Is it a bad idea to go very high?

Second, &quot;Also, double check that the &quot;Enable modifier during rendering&quot; toggle is on (dark) as it should be by default. &quot;

This setting can be found where? I'd triple check it if I had any idea where to look.  It sounds like the stuff I do might not show up in the render unless this is on. 

If these render comments are actually in any way useful, they should probably be referenced in the render section of the guide. As a noob, reading this from start to finish, I'm almost in amazement that someone thought this would somehow be useful at this point, especially without providing information on what/why the point of these actions are, and where to find these settings.   

As a noob, I'm not going to be able to retain this information until I need it, because it's gobbley-gook.. it's too vague, and a little stressfull because I'm wondering why I don't even remotely &quot;get that&quot; and is it in the wrong place, or am I?

Here, we'll be dealing with a Physics-correct planet in a universe with very similar physics laws.

If you want to drastically change the laws of physics, see [[Conplanet/Space/Different physics|some tips on different physics]].

If you want to change ''some'' laws of physics (like having warp drives - which are theoretically possible in our universe), read on, but take a peek at [[Conplanet/Space/Tweaking physics|tweaking and nudging physics into shape]].

We'll touch on the basic things on space and what can, can't and maybe possible for you to do with your universe.

''Our sun is a star. So everything touched on about stars apply to suns as well.''

== Stars ==

''Twinkle Twinkle Little Star...''

=== Celestial Sphere ===
[[Image:Celestial_sphere(in_Japanese).png|thumb|A diagram of the [[w:celestial sphere|celestial sphere]]. The 4 small circles represent the sun. The center is the Earth.]]

If you ever notice, astronomers talk about the &quot;[[w:Celestial sphere|Celestial sphere]]&quot;, which is basically the illusion that all the stars in the sky (excluding the sun) all seem to be in a sphere that surrounds the Earth.

In using ''seem to be'', I also note that the stars are actually of different distances from the Earth, and from different constellations at different points of the universe. This means that you should '''''not''''' use terms like ''&lt;Insert Constellation name here&gt; Sector''. Also, don't try something like ''Lost in space's'' constellation finder (probably why it didn't work in the first place). Place names like ''Alpha Centauri Space'' may be possible though, for something referring to 2 light-years within ''Alpha Centauri''.

The Earth's celestial sphere rotates just over once a day - once a day because the Earth is spinning, the just over because it orbits the Sun. The time just over is = length of the day divided by the length of the year.

== Sun Specifics ==

One star, or a star system? You decide...

=== Multiple Suns ===

''As I watched the two suns set in sequence, I had to squint my eyes to see three blazin' fireballs rise from the East. Oh, what else can go wrong.''

A tip: Don't.

# Systems that have more than one sun have very great fluctuations in temperature. Little to no life can survive.
# You'll end up with the problem of fives:
#* You'll need to be five times further away from one sun than the other.
# There are Lagrange Points where such bodies can exist, but the stable points require that the difference in the mass of the two suns has to be greater than 25 times. A red giant and a white dwarf? Not a good idea.
# There are other problems, such as the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-body_problem N-body problem]

If you still insist, read this to figure out more: [http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/m_mm/ob_techorbit1.html]

Excellent articles: [[w:Binary star]], [[w:Star system]], [http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/050517_binary_stars.html.]

Note that there are very few planets found orbiting star systems. If a planet isn't in the right spot, one of three things can happen:
# It gets flung out of the system.
# It gets adjusted till it orbits properly.
# It gets swallowed by one of the stars.

One example of a planet orbiting a star system (with three stars) is [[w:HD_188753_Ab|HD_188753_Ab]].

One thing to note is that star systems &gt; two usually are combos of binaries + single stars, like this:

Typical three star system:
* Star A and B form a binary star system.
* Star C is another star.
* The AB binary system forms another binary star system with star C.

It has been noted that Earth-like planets in binary systems need the two stars to be seven AU apart, while the planet orbits one of the stars. It is not known whether planets can orbit two stars at once, as in the planet Tatooine in Star Wars, in which the stars were less than one AU apart.

Also note that in star systems like Alpha Centauri, one of the stars may prevent planets farther than a certain distance away from forming (much like how [[w:Jupiter|Jupiter]] does).

=== A single sun ===

''Tat blazin' fireball in the sky, providin' life...''

Now that's better. One sun simplifies things a lot.

First decide on the type of sun you want. A spectral type G2, like our Sun?

A [http://www.astronomynotes.com/starprop/s13.htm graph] shows that Luminosity = Mass^3.5 in solar units.

=== Properties to think about ===
&lt;!-- Requires Expansion --&gt;

=== But be creative ===

Ultimately, when writing creatively, you need not concern yourself with the limitations of science in the creation of your Conplanet. Consider Terry Pratchett’s very popular Discworld series in which the flat circle of Discworld rests atop the backs of four elephants riding an enormous turtle. There's plenty of room for mythological exploration and parody when Conplanet creating.

== Distance approximation formulas ==
You have 2 to choose from. Take your pick.
=== Titius-Bode law ===

[[w:Titius-Bode law|Wikipedia Article]]

Refers the distance of the planets from the sun.

&lt;math&gt;R_i = 0.4 + 0.3 \times 2^{i - 2}&lt;/math&gt;

with the exception of &lt;math&gt;i=1&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;R_1 = 0.4&lt;/math&gt;

The distance of the i-th planet is given by this formula.

Relative to our [[w:solar system|solar system]]:

The law works on the fact that planets settle in relative ratios to each other, however, the problem with Neptune has discredited this formula.

=== Dermott's Law ===
The little-known Dermott's Law. I can only quote Wikipedia, one of the few web references on the subject (all other references are essensially repetitions of the same text):

====Wikipedia Entry on Dermott's Law, accessed on 24th Feb 2007====
'''Dermott's Law''' is an empirical formula for the [[w:sidereal period|sidereal period]] of major [[w:Natural_satellite |satellites]] orbiting planets in the [[w:solar system|solar system]].  It was identified by the [[w:celestial mechanics|celestial mechanics]] researcher [[w:Stanley Dermott|Stanley Dermott]] in the 1960s and takes the form:

''T(n) = T(0).C&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;sup/&gt;''

where ''T(n)'' is the sidereal period of the n&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; satellite, ''T(0)'' is of the order 0.46 and ''C'' is a constant of the planetary system. Specific values are:

*''Jovian system'': &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; T(0) = 0.444;    C = 2.03
*''Saturnian system'': T(0) = 0.462;    C = 1.59
*''Uranian system'': &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; T(0) = 0.488;    C = 2.24

Such power-laws may be a consequence of collapsing-cloud models of planetary and satellite systems possessing various symmetries; see [[w:Titius-Bode Law|Titius-Bode Law]]. They may also reflect the effect of [[w:resonance]]-driven [[w:Commensurability (astronomy)|commensurabilities]] in the various systems.

== Orbital period ==
One option.
=== Kepler's third law ===
''T&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ∝ R&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;''

Basically: Period is proportional to distance from sun to the power of 1.5, or: 

&lt;math&gt;Period \propto \sqrt{Distance^3}&lt;/math&gt;

== Tweaking to make more physics-compatible ==
Okay, so you have your basic numbers now. Tweakin' time!

==== Preventing Orbital Disturbance ====
First off, we'll need to prevent one planet's orbit from disturbing another planet's orbit (so it'll remain stable for more than a few years after its birth).

This means that ...

''Section is U/C''. &lt;!-- Under Construction --&gt;

== External Links ==
* http://www.reference.com/browse/wiki/Orbital_resonance : A very good page on ratios between planets - use these in your solar system!
* [[w:Titius-Bode law]]
* [[w:Dermott's Law]] : Hardly any information, includes 4 useful ratios for 4 systems (including our own) though.
* Non-titius but regular spacing of moons: http://www.floridastars.org/9605cohe.html
* [[w:Orbital period]] : Skim through this, you'll pick something up.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Rational Expressions==
A rational expression has a polynomial in the numerator and a polynomial in the denominator: &lt;math&gt;\frac{f\left(x\right)}{g\left(x\right)}&lt;/math&gt;. In some cases rational functions can be simplified, which can make differentiation, integration and just solving the equation easier. There is a simple procedure to follow if you want to simplify a fraction.
#Fully factor the numerator and denominator.
#:&lt;math&gt;\frac{ax^3+bx^2+cx+d}{ax^2+bx+c}=\frac{(ex+f)(x+g)(x+h)}{(ix+j)(x+g)(x+h)}&lt;/math&gt;
#If the same factor is in both the numerator and denominator you can cancel them out.
#:&lt;math&gt;\frac{(ex+f)\cancel{(x + g)}\cancel{(x +h)}}
{(ix+j)\cancel{(x+g)}\cancel{(x+h)}}=\frac{(ex+f)}{(ix+j)}&lt;/math&gt;
#If there multiple factors left you can recombine based on the situation.

===Example===
Simplify the following expression:&lt;math&gt;\frac{5x^3+40x^2+75x}{x^2+12x+35}&lt;/math&gt;.
#Factor both the numerator and the denominator notice that a 5x can be removed in the numerator.
#:&lt;math&gt;\frac{5x(x^2+8x+15)}{(x+5)(x+7)}=\frac{5x(x+5)(x+3)}{(x+5)(x+7)}&lt;/math&gt;
#Cancel out the same factors
#:&lt;math&gt;\frac{5x(x+5)(x+3)}{(x+5)(x+7)}=\frac{5x(x+3)}{(x+7)}&lt;/math&gt;
#Recombine the factors
#:&lt;math&gt;\frac{5x(x+3)}{(x+7)}=\frac{5x^2+15x}{x+7}&lt;/math&gt;

==Division of Polynomials==
In core four you will be expected to divide polynomials of up to the fourth degree by either a linear or quadratic polynomial. This only works if the numerator is greater than the denominator. The resultant will always be in the form;&lt;math&gt;\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}=q(x) + \frac{r(x)}{g(x)}&lt;/math&gt; where q(x)is the resulting polynomial and &lt;math&gt;\frac{r(x)}{g(x)}&lt;/math&gt; is the remainder.

===Long Division===
Long division of polynomials is very similar to regular long division. I will use a problem to demonstrate how long division works.&lt;p&gt;
Divide &lt;math&gt;x^3 + 8x^2 - 4x + 10&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;x^2 + 3x -1&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;p&gt;
The first step is to set up the equation. Make sure that it is in order from highest power of x to lowest power of x.&lt;p&gt;
[[Image:Longdiv1.png]]&lt;p&gt;
Then we divide the first term of the dividend by the first term of the divisor.&lt;p&gt;
[[Image:Longdiv2.png]]&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac {x^3}{x^2} = x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
We place this resultant on top.&lt;p&gt;
[[Image:Longdiv3.png]]&lt;p&gt;
Then we multiply the resultant by the divisor and subtract it from the dividend.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;x \left ( x^2 + 3x -1 \right )= x^3 + 3x^2 -x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
[[Image:Longdiv4.png]]&lt;p&gt;
What is left becomes the new dividend and we repeat the process again. We continue to do this until the first term has a degree less than the first term of the divisor. What is left is the remainder.&lt;p&gt;
[[Image:Longdiv.png]]

===Synthetic Division===


====Example One====
Divide &lt;math&gt;2x^5 + 5x^2 - 10x^3 -30x - 171&lt;/math&gt; by x-3.&lt;p&gt;
The divisor is c. So in this case it will be 3.&lt;p&gt;
Then we need to arrange our divisor in order from highest to lowest degree, if a degree is missing replace it with zero.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;2x^5 + 0x^4 - 10x^3 + 5x^2 -30x - 171&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
We then only look at the coefficients.&lt;p&gt;
2 + 0 - 10 + 5 - 30 - 171&lt;p&gt;
Now we set up our division equation.&lt;p&gt;
[[Image:synthdiv1.png]]&lt;p&gt;
Next we carry up the first term of the divisior.&lt;p&gt;
[[Image:Synthdiv2.png]]&lt;p&gt;
Then we multiply the resultant by the divisor and add it to the next term.&lt;p&gt;
[[Image:Synthdiv3.png]]&lt;p&gt;
We continue to do this until we reach the end.&lt;p&gt;
[[Image:Synthdiv4.PNG]]&lt;p&gt;
Now we need to read the variables. When we read the variables we go from highest degree -1 to lowest degree. The last number is the remainder.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;2x^4 + 6x^3 + 8x^2 + 29x +57&lt;/math&gt; remainder 0.&lt;p&gt;
This is the answer to the problem.

==Partial Fractions==
Only proper fractions can be made into partial fractions. A proper fraction is a fraction where the numerator is of a smaller degree than the denominator. Partial Fractions can used to make differentiation, integration or work with series easier. The goal of partial fractions is to take a complex polynomial and make it several simpler polynomials. To create a partial fraction equation you need to:
#Factor the denominator and the numerator.
#:&lt;math&gt;\frac{ax^2+bx+c}{ax^3+bx^2+cx+d}\equiv\frac{(ix+j)(kx+l)}{(ax+b)(cx+d)(ex+f)}&lt;/math&gt;
#Create the partial fraction by making each factor the denominator, with a unique variable for the numerator.
#:&lt;math&gt;\frac{(ix+j)(kx+l)}{(ax+b)(cx+d)(ex+f)}\equiv\frac{A}{(ax+b)}+\frac{B}{(cx+d)}+\frac{C}{(ex+f)}&lt;/math&gt;
#Multiply every fraction by the denominator of original fraction.
#:&lt;math&gt;\frac{(ix+j)(kx+l)(ax+b)(cx+d)(ex+f)}{(ax+b)(cx+d)(ex+f)}\equiv&lt;/math&gt;
#:&lt;math&gt;\frac{A(ax+b)(cx+d)(ex+f)}{(ax+b)}+\frac{B(ax+b)(cx+d)(ex+f)}{(cx+d)}+\frac{C(ax+b)(cx+d)(ex+f)}{(ex+f)}&lt;/math&gt;
#Cancel all out all factors that are the same.
#:&lt;math&gt;(ix+j)(kx+l)\equiv A(cx+d)(ex+f)+B(ax+b)(ex+f)+C(ax+b)(cx+d)&lt;/math&gt;
#Multiply all factors together.
#:&lt;math&gt;ikx^2+ilx+jlx+jl \equiv&lt;/math&gt;
#:&lt;math&gt;(Acex^2+Acfx+Adex+Adf)+(Baex^2+Bafx+Bbex+Bbf)+(Cacx^2+Cadx+Cbdx+Cbd)\,&lt;/math&gt;
#Group all terms with x to the same index together.
#:&lt;math&gt;ikx^2+(il+kj)x+jl\equiv&lt;/math&gt;
#:&lt;math&gt;(Ace+Bae+Cac)x^2+\left(Acf+Ade+Baf+Bbe+Cad+Cbd\right)x+\left(Adf+Bbf+Cbd\right)&lt;/math&gt;
#The co-efficient of x raised to the same index is the same on both sides of the identity. Using this fact solve for the variables in the numerator, using simultaneous equations. This is known as equating coefficients.
#:&lt;math&gt;ik\equiv\left(Ace+Bae+Cac\right)&lt;/math&gt;
#:&lt;math&gt;\left(il+kj\right)\equiv\left(Acf+Ade+Baf+Bbe+Cad+Cbd\right)&lt;/math&gt;
#:&lt;math&gt;jl\equiv\left(Adf+Bbf+Cbd\right)&lt;/math&gt;
#In step 2 replace the variables A, B, C with the value of the variable obtained from the previous step.
===Example One===
Rewrite as a partial fraction the following expression: &lt;math&gt;\frac{x^2+13x+40}{2x^3+27x^2+111x+140}&lt;/math&gt;.
#Using the knowledge from [[A-level Mathematics/FP1/Roots of Polynomial Equations|Further Pure 1: Roots of Polynomial Equations]]. We can factor the denominator as such.
#:&lt;math&gt;\frac{x^2+13x+40}{2x^3+27x^2+111x+140} \equiv \frac{(x+5)(x+8)}{(2x+5)(x+7)(x+4)}&lt;/math&gt;
#Now we start making the partial fraction.
#:&lt;math&gt;\frac{x^2+13x+40}{(2x+5)(x+7)(x+4)}\equiv\frac{A}{(2x+5)}+\frac{B}{(x+7)}+\frac{C}{(x+4)}&lt;/math&gt;
#Next we multiply everything by the denominator of the original expression.
#:&lt;math&gt;\frac{x^2+13x+40(2x+5)(x+7)(x+4)}{(2x+5)(x+7)(x+4)}\equiv&lt;/math&gt;
#:&lt;math&gt;\frac{A(2x+5)(x+7)(x+4)}{(2x+5)}+\frac{B(2x+5)(x+7)(x+4)}{(x+7}+\frac{C(2x+5)(x+7)(x+4)}{(x+4)}&lt;/math&gt;
#Now we cancel out terms.
#:&lt;math&gt;(x+7)(x+8)\equiv A(x+7)(x+4)+B(2x+5)(x+4)+C(2x+5)(x+7)&lt;/math&gt;
#Then multiply all the factors together.
#:&lt;math&gt;x^2+13x+40=Ax^2+11Ax+28A+2Bx^2+13Bx+20B+2Cx^2+19Cx+35C\,&lt;/math&gt;
#We then group the terms together.
#:&lt;math&gt;x^2+13x+40=(A+2B+2C)x^2+(11A+13B+19C)x+(28A+20B+35C)\,&lt;/math&gt;
#Now we equate coefficients. Then we need to solve the simultaneous equations.
#:&lt;math&gt;1\equiv(A+2B+2C)\equiv\,&lt;/math&gt;
#:&lt;math&gt;13\equiv(11A+13B+19C)\,&lt;/math&gt;
#:&lt;math&gt;40\equiv(28A+20B+35C)\,&lt;/math&gt;
##First we equate A
##:&lt;math&gt;1\equiv(A+2B+2C)\equiv A=1-2B-2C\,&lt;/math&gt;
##:Then
##:&lt;math&gt;13\equiv11(1-2B-2C)+13B+19C\equiv11-22B-22C+13B+19C\equiv11-9B-3C&lt;/math&gt;
##:&lt;math&gt;9B\equiv3C+2&lt;/math&gt;
##:&lt;math&gt;B\equiv-\frac{3C+2}{9}&lt;/math&gt;
##We can further equate A to
##:&lt;math&gt;A\equiv1-2(-\frac{3C+2}{9})-2C&lt;/math&gt;
##:&lt;math&gt;A\equiv\frac{13-12C}{9}&lt;/math&gt;
##Now we can solve for C
##:&lt;math&gt;40\equiv(28(\frac{13-12C}{9})+20(-\frac{3C+2}{9})+35C)\,&lt;/math&gt;
##:&lt;math&gt;40\equiv((\frac{364-336C}{9})+(-\frac{60C+40}{9})+35C)\,&lt;/math&gt;
##:&lt;math&gt;40=36-9C\,&lt;/math&gt;
##:&lt;math&gt;C=\frac{-4}{9}&lt;/math&gt;
##Now we can solve for the rest
##:&lt;math&gt;A\equiv\frac{13-12\frac{-4}{9}}{9}=\frac{55}{27}&lt;/math&gt;
##:&lt;math&gt;B\equiv-\frac{3C+2}{9}=\frac{-2}{27}&lt;/math&gt;
##:&lt;math&gt;C\equiv\frac{-4}{9}&lt;/math&gt;
#Now we can write out our partial fraction:
#:&lt;math&gt;\frac{x^2+13x+40}{(2x+5)(x+7)(x+4)}\equiv\frac{55}{27(2x+5)}-\frac{2}{27(x+7)}-\frac{4}{9(x+4)}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Nutritional yeast''' is a versatile inactive type of [[Cookbook:Yeast|yeast]] (unlike brewer's active yeast) usually grown on sugar beets and sugar cane. It is a dry, brownish powder that is not quite coarsely ground but not fine either. When used in vegan &quot;cheeses&quot;, it gives a good texture and somewhat cheesy-earthy taste. It can also be added to foods as a vitamin supplement as it naturally contains many trace nutrients including magnesium and copper. However, some brands of nutritional yeast are fortified with extra vitamins, including [[w:Vitamin B12|vitamin B12]].

Important things to remember are 
# Nutritional yeast is not the same as brewer's yeast, though Brewer's Yeast Flakes is a brand of nutritional yeast
# The recommended daily value of nutritional yeast is two heaping tablespoons and no more.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Mean and Standard Deviation ==

A lot of the time, when you're conducting an experiment, you will run it more than once, especially if it is inexpensive. Scientists run experiments more than once so that the ''random errors'' that result from taking measurements, such as having to guess a length between two hash marks on a ruler, cancel themselves out and leave them with a more precise measurement. However, the question remains: how should you consolidate all of the data into something that's more managable to use?

=== Mean ===

Suppose you have n data points taken '''under the same conditions''' and you wish to consolidate them to as few as feasibly possible. One thing which could help is is to use some centralized value, which is in some way &quot;between&quot; all of the original data points. This, in fact, is called the '''mean'''  of the data set.

There are many ways of computing the mean of a data set depending on how it is believed to be distributed. One of the most common methods is to use the ''arithmetic mean'', which is defined as:

{{box|&lt;math&gt; \bar{x} = \frac{\Sigma \hat{x}_k}{n}&lt;/math&gt;}}

Other types of mean include the [[w:Geometric mean]], which should be used when the data are very widely distributed (ex. an exponential distribution) and the &quot;log-mean&quot; which occurs often in transport phenomena.

=== Standard Deviation ===

Having a value for the mean tells you what value the data points &quot;cluster&quot; around but it does not tell you how spread out they are from the center. A second statistical variable called the '''standard deviation''' is used for that. The standard deviation is essentially ''the average distance between the data points and their mean''. The distance is expressed as a squared distance in order to prevent negative deviations from lessoning the effect of positive deviations.

The mathematical formulation for the standard deviation &lt;math&gt; \sigma &lt;/math&gt; is:

{{box|&lt;math&gt; \sigma^2 = \frac{\Sigma (\hat{x}_k - \bar{x})^2}{n-1} &lt;/math&gt; }}

The denominator is n-1 instead of n because statisticians found that it gives better results for small numbers of experiments; see [[w:Standard deviation]] for a more thorough explanation of this.

=== Putting it together ===

'''The standard deviation of a data set measured under constant conditions is a measure of how precise the data set is.''' Because this is true, the standard deviation of a data set is often used in conjunction with the mean in order to report experimental results. Typically, results are reported as:

&lt;math&gt; \bar{x} \pm \sigma &lt;/math&gt;

If a distribution is assumed, knowing both the mean and standard deviation can help us to estimate the probability that the actual value of the variable is within a certain range, ''if there is no systematic bias in the data''. If there is (such as use of broken equipment, negligence, and so on) then no statistics could predict the effects of that.

== Linear Regression ==

Suppose you have a set of data points (&lt;math&gt; \hat{x}_k, \hat{y}_k &lt;/math&gt;) taken '''under differing conditions''' which you suspect, from a graph, can be reasonably estimated by drawing a line through the points. Any line that you could draw will have (or can be written in) the following form:

&lt;math&gt; y = mx + b &lt;/math&gt; where m is the slope of the line and b is the y-intercept.

We seek the ''best'' line that we could possibly use to estimate the pattern of the data. This line will be most useful for both interpolating between points that we know, and extrapolating to unknown values (as long as they're close to measured values). In the most usual measure, how &quot;good&quot; the fit is is determined by the vertical distance between the line and the data points (&lt;math&gt; R_k &lt;/math&gt;), which is called the '''residual''':

&lt;math&gt; R_k = (m\hat{x}_k + b) - \hat{y}_k &lt;/math&gt;

In order to normalize the residuals so that they don't cancel when one's positive and one's negative (and thus helping to avoid statistical bias), we are usually concerned with the ''square'' of &lt;math&gt; R_k &lt;/math&gt; when doing least-squares regression. We use squared terms and not absolute values so that the function is [[w:differentiable|differentiable]], don't worry about this if you haven't taken calculus yet.

In order to take into account ''all'' of the data points, we simply seek to minimize the sum of the squared residuals:

&lt;math&gt; \mbox{ minimize }\Sigma {R_k}^2 &lt;/math&gt;

Using calculus, we can take the derivative of this with respect to m and with respect to b and solve the equations to come up with the values of m and b that minimize the sum of squares (hence the alternate name of this technique: '''least-squares regression'''. The formulas are as follows, where n is the total number of data points you are regressing[1]:

{{box|&lt;math&gt; m^* = \frac{n*\Sigma(\hat{x}_k*\hat{y}_k)-\Sigma(\hat{x}_k)*\Sigma(\hat{y}_k)} {n*\Sigma(\hat{x_k}^2) - (\Sigma(\hat{x}_k))^2} &lt;/math&gt;}}

{{box|&lt;math&gt; b^* = \frac{\Sigma(\hat{y}_k) - m^{*}*\Sigma(\hat{x}_k)} {n} &lt;/math&gt;}}

=== Example of linear regression ===

{{example|Suppose you wanted to measure how fast you got to school by a less direct route than looking at the speedometer of your car. Instead, you look at a map and read the distances between each intersection, and then you measure how long it takes to go each distance. Suppose the results were as shown in the table below. How far from home did you start, and what is the best estimate for your average speed?}}

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! t(min) !! D (yards)
|-
| 1.1 || 559.5
|-
| 1.9 || 759.5
|-
| 3.0 || 898.2
|-
| 3.8 || 1116.3
|-
| 5.3 || 1308.7
|}

The first thing we should do with any data like this is to graph it and see if a linear fit would be reasonable. Plotting this data, we can see by inspection that a linear fit appears to be reasonable.

[[Image:RegressionData.png]]

Now we need to compute all of the values in our regression formulas, and to do this (by hand) we set up a table:

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Trial !! t !! t^2 !! D !! D^2 !! t*D
|-
| 1 || 1.1 || 1.21 || 559.5 || 313040 || 615.45
|-
| 2 || 1.9 || 3.61 || 759.5 || 576840 || 1443.05
|-
| 3 || 3.0 || 9.00 || 898.2 || 806763 || 2694.6
|-
| 4 || 3.8 || 14.44 || 1116.3 || 1246126 || 4241.94
|-
| 5 || 5.3 || 28.09 || 1308.7 || 1712695 || 6936.11
|-
| TOTAL || 15.1 || 56.35 || 4642.2 || 4655464 || 15931.15
|}


Now that we have this data we can plug it into our linear regression equation:

&lt;math&gt;  m^* = \frac{n*\Sigma(\hat{x}_k*\hat{y}_k)-\Sigma(\hat{x}_k)*\Sigma(\hat{y}_k)} {n*\Sigma(\hat{x_k}^2) - (\Sigma(\hat{x}_k))^2} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; = \frac{5* 15931.13 - 15.1*4642.2}{5*56.35 - (15.1)^2} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; = 177.9 \mbox{ } \frac{yard}{min} &lt;/math&gt;

So &lt;math&gt; b = \frac{\Sigma(\hat{y}_k) - m^{*}*\Sigma(\hat{x}_k)} {n} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; = \frac{4642.2 - 177.9*15.1}{5} = 391.2 \mbox{ yards} &lt;/math&gt;

Hence the equation for the line of best fit is:

{{box|&lt;math&gt;D=177.9*t+391.2 &lt;/math&gt;}}

The graph of this plotted against the data looks like this:

=== How to tell how good your regression is ===

In the previous example, we visually determined if it would be reasonable to perform a linear fit, but it is certainly possible to have a less clear-cut case! If there is some slight curve to the data, is it still &quot;close enough&quot; to be useful? Though it will always come down to your own judgment after seeing the fit line graph against the data, there is a mathematical tool to help you called a '''correlation coefficient''', r, which can be defined in several different ways. One of them is as follows [1]:

{{box|&lt;math&gt; r = \frac{n*\Sigma( \hat{x}_k * \hat{y}_k ) - \Sigma(\hat{x}_k)*\Sigma(\hat{y}_k)}
{\sqrt{n*\Sigma({\hat{x}_k}^2) - (\Sigma \hat{x}_k)^2} * \sqrt{n*\Sigma({\hat{y}_k}^2) - (\Sigma \hat{y}_k)^2}}&lt;/math&gt;}}

It can be shown that this value always lies between -1 and 1. The closer it is to 1 (or -1), the more reasonable the linear fit. In general, the more data points you have, the smaller r needs to be before it's a good fit, but a good rule of thumb is to look for high (higher than 0.85 or 0.9) values and then graph to see if the graph makes sense. Sometimes it will, sometimes it won't, the method is not foolproof.

In the above example we have:

&lt;math&gt; r = \frac{5*15931.13 - 15.1*4642.2}{\sqrt{5*56.35-(15.1)^2}*\sqrt{5*4655464-(4642.2)^2}} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; r = 0.992 &lt;/math&gt;

Hence the data correlates very well with a linear model.

== Linearization ==

=== In general ===

Whenever you have to fit a parameter or multiple parameters to data, it is a good idea to try to '''linearize''' the function first, because linear regression is much less intensive and more accurate than nonlinear regression. The goal with any linearization is to reduce the function to the form:

&lt;math&gt; Variable\mbox{ 1} = constant + constant*\mbox{ Variable 2} &lt;/math&gt;

The difference between this and &quot;standard&quot; linear regression is that Variable 1 and Variable 2 can be ''any functions'' of x and y, as long as they are not combined in any way (i.e. you can't have &lt;math&gt;ln(x + y) &lt;/math&gt; as one variable). The technique can be extended to more than two variables using a method called [[w:multiple linear regression]] but as that's more difficult to perform, this section will focus on two-dimensional regression.

=== Power Law ===

To see some of the power of linearization, let's suppose that we have two variables, x and y, related by a power law:

&lt;math&gt; y = A*x^b &lt;/math&gt;

where A and b are constants. If we have data connecting changes in y to changes in x, we would like to know the values of a and b. This is difficult to do if the equation is in its current form but we can change it into a linear-type function!

The trick here is we need to get rid of the exponent b, so in order to do that we take the natural log of both sides:

&lt;math&gt; ln\mbox{ y} = ln\mbox{ (A*x}^b) &lt;/math&gt;

Using laws of logarithms we can simplify the right-hand side to obtain the following:

{{box|&lt;math&gt; y = A*x^b &lt;-&gt; ln\mbox{ y} = ln\mbox{ A} + b*ln\mbox{ x} &lt;/math&gt;}}

The beauty of this equation is that it is, in a sense, linear. '''If we graph ln(y) vs. ln(x) obtain a straight line with slope b and y-intercept ln(A)'''. 

=== Exponentials ===

Another common use of linearization is with exponentials, where x and y are related by an expression of the form:

&lt;math&gt; y = A*b^x &lt;/math&gt;

This works for any base but the most common base encountered in practice is Euler's constant, e. Again, we take the natural log of both sides, in order to get rid of the exponent: 

{{box|&lt;math&gt; y = A*b^x &lt;-&gt; ln \mbox{ y} = \ln{ A} + x* \ln{ b} &lt;/math&gt;}}

This time, '''Graph ln y vs. x to obtain a line with slope ln(b) and y-intercept ln(A)'''.

== Linear Interpolation ==

Often, when you look up properties on a chart, you will be looking them up at conditions in ''between'' two charted conditions. For example, if you were looking up the specific enthalpy of steam at '''10 MPa''' and 430oC you would look in the steam tables and see something like this: [2]

&lt;center&gt;
{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! T (oC) !! H &lt;math&gt; (\frac{kJ}{kg}) &lt;/math&gt;
|-
| 400 || 2832.4
|-
| 450 || 2943.4
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

How can you figure out the intermediate value for this? We can't exactly but we can '''assume that H(T) is a linear function'''. If we assume that it is linear, then we can easily find the intermediate value. First, we set up a table, including the unknown value like this:

&lt;center&gt;
{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! T (oC) !! H &lt;math&gt; (\frac{kJ}{kg}) &lt;/math&gt;
|-
| 400 || 2832.4
|-
| 430 || x
|-
| 450 || 2943.4
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

Then since we're assuming the relationship between T and H is linear, and the slope of a line is a constant ''the slope between points 3 and 2 has to equal the slope between points 3 and 1''. 

Therefore, we can write that:

&lt;math&gt; \frac{2943.4-x}{450-430} = \frac{2943.4-2832.4}{450-400} &lt;/math&gt;

Solving gives '''x = 2899 kJ/kg '''

The same method can be used to find an unknown T for a given H between two tabulated values.

=== General formula ===

To derive a more general formula (though I always derive it from scratch anyways, it's nice to have a formula), lets replace the numbers by variables ad give them more generic symbols:

&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! x !! y
|-
| &lt;math&gt; x_1 &lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt; y_1 &lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt; x^* &lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt; y^* &lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt; x_2 &lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt; y_2 &lt;/math&gt;
|}

&lt;/center&gt;

Setting the slope between points 3 and 2 equal to that between 3 and 1 yields:

{{box|&lt;math&gt; \frac{y2-y1}{x2-x1} = \frac{y2 - y^*}{x2 - x^*} &lt;/math&gt;}}

This equation can then be solved for x* or y* as appropriate.  

=== Limitations of Linear Interpolation ===

It is important to remember that ''linear interpolation is not exact''. How inexact it is depends on two major factors:

# What the real relationship between x and y is (the more curved it is, the worse the linear approximation)
# The difference between consecutive x values on the table (the smaller the distance, the closer almost any function will resemble a line)

Therefore, it is not recommended to use linear interpolation if the spaces are very widely separated. However, if no other method of approximation is available, linear interpolation is often the only option, or other forms of interpolation (which may be just as inaccurate, depending on what the actual function is).

===Phonology===

====Syllable structure====
Maximal syllable is CVC. Maximal consonant cluster is -CC- medially. Initial and final consonant clusters do not occur. Affixes have two forms, one before/after a vowel, and one before/after a consonant.

====Consonant mutations====
: ''l'' + ''tl'' &gt; ''ll'' (''cal-'' &quot;house&quot; +  ''-tli'' Absolutive suffix = ''calli'' &quot;house (Abs.)&quot;)
: ''l'' + ''y'' &gt;/ ''ll'' (''cual-'' &quot;good thing&quot; + ''-yōtl'' abstract suffix = ''cuallōtl'' &quot;goodness&quot;)
: ''n'' + ''p'' &gt; ''mp'' (''on'' &quot;deictic particle&quot; +  ''pa'' &quot;locative&quot; = ''ompa'' &quot;there&quot;)
: ''y'' wordfinally &gt; ''x'' (''nicchīya'' &quot;I observed it&quot; + past tense loss of final vowel = ''nicchīx'' &quot;I observed it&quot;)

===Morphology===
The words of Nahuatl can be divided into three basic functional classes: verbs, nouns and particles. Adjectives exist, but they generally behave like nouns and there are very few adjectives that are not derived from either verbal or nominal roots. The few adverbs that can be said to exist fall into the class of particles.

====The Noun==== 
Nouns belong to one of two classes: animates or inanimates. Originally the grammatical distinction between these were that inanimate nouns had no plural forms, but in most modern dialects both animate and inanimate nouns are pluralizable. The noun is inflected for two basic contrasting categories: plural and possessedness. Nominal morphology is mostly suffixing. Some irregular formations exist. 

In Nahuatl, nouns take a [[Affix|suffix]] called the &quot;absolutive&quot;. This suffix takes the form ''-tl'' after vowels (''ā-tl'', &quot;water&quot;) and ''-tli'' after consonants, which [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilates]] to a final /l/ (''tōch-tli'', &quot;rabbit&quot;, but ''cal-li'', &quot;house&quot;). Some nouns have an irregular form in ''-in'' (''mich-in'', fish). These suffixes are dropped in most derived forms: ''tōch-calli'', &quot;rabbit-hole&quot;, ''mich-matlatl'', &quot;fishing net&quot;.

*The absolutive singular suffix has three basic forms: ''-tl/tli, -lin/-in'', and some irregular nouns with no suffix.
*The absolutive plural suffix has three basic forms: ''-tin'', ''-meh'', or just a final glottal stop ''-h''. Some plurals are formed also with reduplication of the noun's first syllable.
*The possessive singular suffix has two basic forms: ''-uh'' (on stems ending in a vowel) or -Ø (on stems ending in a consonant).
*The possessive plural suffix has the form ''-huān''. 

The table below present some common nouns conjugated as examples.

====Plural forms====
Only animate nouns can take a plural form. These include most animate living beings, but also words like ''tēpetl'' (&quot;mountain&quot;), ''citlalli'' (&quot;star&quot;) and some other phenomena. Plurals are formed in several ways:
*The absolutive suffix is replaced with ''-h'' ([[glottal stop]]), ''-tin'' or ''-meh''
*Some nouns may have a [[reduplication]] of their first consonant and vowel, with the reduplicated vowel [[vowel length|long]].

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+Possible plurals combination
|-
!
!-h
!-tin

|-
!With&lt;br /&gt;reduplication

|Never occurs
|-
!Without&lt;br /&gt;reduplication
|cīhuatl, cīhuah
|oquichtli, oquichtin
|michin, michmeh
|}

The plural isn't totally stable and in many cases several different forms are attested.

====Noun Inflection====
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!Absolutive singular
|''cīhuatl'' &quot;woman&quot;

|-
|-
!Possessed Singular
|''nocīhuauh'' &quot;my woman&quot;
|''noquich'' &quot;my man&quot;
|''nototōl'' &quot;my turkey&quot;

|-
|-
!Possessed Plural
|''nocīhuahuān'' &quot;my women&quot;
|''noquichhuān'' &quot;my men&quot;
|''nototōlhuān'' &quot;my turkeys&quot;
|''notlācahuān'' &quot;my persons&quot;
|-
|}

====Possessor prefixes====
* 1st Person Singular: ''no-'' 
''nocal'' &quot;my house&quot;
*2nd Person Singular: ''mo-''
''mocal'' &quot;your house&quot;
*3rd Person Singular: ''ī-''
''īcal'' &quot;his/her/its house&quot;
*1st Person Plural: ''to-'' '
'tocal'' &quot;our house&quot;
*2nd Person Plural: ''anmo-''
''anmocal'' &quot;Your house (pl.)&quot;
*3rd Person Plural: ''īn-'' 
''īncal'' &quot;their house&quot;
* Unknown owner: ''tē-''
''tēcal'' &quot;someone's house&quot;

Some other categories can be inflected on the noun such as: 
: Honorific formed with the suffix ''-tzin''. 
: cīhua &quot;woman&quot; + ''tzin''+ ''tli'' absolutive = ''cīhuatzintli'' &quot;woman (said with respect)&quot;

====Derivational Morphology====
*''-tia'' derives from noun X a verb with an approximate meaning of &quot;to provide with X &quot; or &quot;to become X&quot;.
*''-huia'' derives from noun X a verb with an approximate meaning of &quot;to use X &quot; or &quot;to provide with X&quot;.
*''-yōtl'' derives from a noun X  a noun with an abstract meaning of x-hood or x-ness.
*''-yoh'' derives from a noun X a noun with a meaning of &quot;thing full of X&quot; or &quot;thing with a lot of X&quot;

===The Verb=== 
The uses prefices that mark the person and number of the subject and object. The object included with the verb,

The verb is marked with prefixes in order to agree with the person and number of the subject and the object of the sentence; additionally, verbs inflect for tense and aspect. &lt;!--Apart from the participants of the verbal action, direct arguments of the verb (which are obligatorily marked on the verb) other categories can be optionally marked. For example direction of the action. Also verbal compounds of two verbal roots can be formed. Two inflections increasing the valency of the verb is found: the applicative and the causative. SOMEONE PLEASE REWRITE THIS PASSAGE. PREFERABLY THE ORIGINAL AUTHOR COULD MAKE IT MORE EASILY UNDERSTOOD. --&gt;

====Subject prefixes and suffix====
This set of prefixes are used to express the subject of transitive and intransitive verbs . They can also be prefixed to a noun, X, to make a predicative construction with the meaning &quot;is X&quot;.
*1st Person Singular: ''ni-'' 
''nitlācatl'' I am a man&quot;, ''nicochi'' &quot;I sleep&quot;, 
*2nd Person Singular: ''ti-''  
''titlācatl'' &quot;you are a man&quot;, ''ticochi'' &quot;you sleep&quot;
*3rd Person Singular: ''Ø- (none)''
''tlācatl'' &quot;he/she/it is a man&quot;, ''cochi'' &quot;he/she/it sleeps&quot; 
*1st Person Plural: ''ti + plural -h/-queh''
''titlatlācah'' &quot;we are men&quot;, ''ticochih''&quot;we sleep&quot;
*2nd Person Plural: ''an + plural -h/-queh'' 
''antlatlācah'' &quot;You are men&quot;, ''ancochih'' &quot;You sleep&quot;
*3rd Person Plural: ''Ø- (none) + plural -h/-queh'' 
''tlatlācah'' &quot;they are men&quot;, ''cochih'' &quot;they sleep&quot;

====Object prefixes====
This set of prefixes is used to express the direct object of transitive verbs.
*1st Person Singular: ''nēch'' 
''nēchitta'' &quot;he/she/it sees me&quot;, ''tinēchitta'' &quot;you see me&quot;
*2nd Person Singular:''mitz''
''mitzitta'' &quot;he/she/it sees you&quot;, ''nimitzitta'' &quot;I see you&quot;
*3rd Person Singular: ''qui'' 
''quitta'' &quot;he/she/it sees him/her/it&quot;
*1st Person Plural: ''tēch'' 
''tēchitta'' &quot;he/she/it sees us&quot;
*2ndPerson Plural: ''amēch'' 
''amēchitta'' &quot;he/she/it sees You (pl.)&quot;
*3rd Person Plural: ''quim''
''quimitta'' &quot;he/she/it sees them&quot;
* unknown animate object: ''tē'' 
''tēitta'' &quot;he/she/it sees someone&quot;
*unknown inanimate object: ''tla''
''tlatta'' &quot;he/she/it sees something&quot;

====Temporal and aspectual suffixes====
*Present: has no suffix.
*Perfect: ''-c/h/?/Ø''  ''niquittac'' &quot;I saw him/her/it (preterit aspect) &quot; 
*Future: ''-z''  ''niquittāz'' &quot;I will see him/her/it &quot; 
*Imperfect: ''-ya'' ''niquittāya'' &quot;I saw him/her/it (imperfect aspect) &quot;
*Irrealis: ''-zquiya'' ''niquittāzquiya'' &quot;I would have seen him/her/it&quot;

====Applicative====
The applicative construction adds an argument to the verb. The role of the added argument can be benefactive, malefactive, indirect object or similar. It is formed by the suffix ''-lia''.
*''niquittilia'' &quot;I see it for him&quot;

====Causative====
The applicative construction adds an argument to the verb. This argument is an agent causing the object to undertake the action of the verb. It is formed by the suffix ''-tia''.
*''niquittatia''  &quot;I make him see it/I show it to him&quot;

====Unspecified Subject/Passive====
The construction called &quot;passive&quot; by some grammarians and &quot;unspecified subject construction&quot; by others removes the subject from the valency of the verb, substituting it with a null reference, and promoting the argument marked by object prefixes to subject. The passive or unspecified subject construction uses one of two suffixes: ''-lo'' or ''-hua''.
*quitta &quot;he sees it&quot;+ ''-lo''= ''quittalo'' &quot;it is seen (by someone)&quot;
*miqui &quot;he dies&quot; + hua = ''micohua'' &quot;there is dying/people are dying&quot;

====Directional Affixes====
Deixis:
*''-on-''  &quot;away from the speaker&quot;
*''on''+ ''tlahtoa'' &quot;to speak&quot; = ''ontlahtoa'' &quot;he/she/it speaks towards there&quot;
*''-huāl-'' &quot; towards the speaker&quot; 
*''huāl''+ ''tlahtoa'' &quot;to speak&quot; =  ''huāllahtoa'' &quot;he/she/it speaks towards here&quot;

Introvert: 
Imperfective: ''-qui '' &quot;comes towards the speaker in order to X&quot;
''qui'' + ''itta'' &quot;to see&quot; + qui =&quot;''quittaqui'' &quot;he/she/it will come here to see it&quot; 
Perfective: ''-co''  &quot;has come towards the speaker in order to X&quot;
''qui'' + ''itta'' &quot;to see&quot; + ''co'' =''quittaco'' &quot;he/she/it has come here to see it&quot;

Extrovert:
Imperfective: ''-tīuh'' &quot;goes away from the speaker in order to X&quot;
''qui'' + ''itta'' &quot;to see&quot; + tīuh =&quot;''quittatīuh'' &quot;he/she/it will go there to see it&quot; 
Perfective: ''-to'' &quot; has gone away from the speaker in order to X&quot;
''qui'' + ''itta'' &quot;to see&quot; + ''to'' =''quittato'' &quot;he/she/it has gone there to see it&quot;

====Derivational====
A number of different suffixes exist to derive nouns from verbs:

*''-lli'' used to derive passivized nouns from verbs.
''tla'' &quot;something&quot; + ''ixca'' &quot;roast&quot; + ''l'' + ''tli'' = ''tlaxcalli'' &quot;something roasted/ a tortilla&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
''tla'' + ''ihcuiloa'' &quot;write/draw&quot; + ''l'' - ''tli'' = ''tlahcuilolli'' &quot;scripture/ a drawing&quot;

*''-liztli''  used to derive abstract nouns from verbs.
''miqui'' &quot;to die&quot; + ''liztli'' = ''miquiliztli'' &quot;death&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
''tlahcuiloa'' &quot;to write something&quot; +'' liztli ''= ''tlahcuiloliztli'' &quot;the concept of writing or being a scribe&quot;

*''-qui'' used to derive agentive nouns from verbs.
''ichtequi'' &quot;to steal&quot; + ''qui'' = ''ichtecqui'' &quot;a thief&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
''tlahuāna'' &quot;to become drunk&quot; + ''qui'' = ''tlahuānqui'' &quot;a drunkard&quot;

*''-ni'' used to derive habitual nouns from verbs.
''miqui'' &quot;to die&quot; +''ni'' = ''miquīni'' &quot;a mortal&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
''cuacua'' &quot;to bite&quot; + ''ni'' = ''cuacuāni'' &quot;someone that is known to be capable of or to habitually bite&quot;

====Verbal compounds====
Two verbs can be compounded with the &lt;!--ligature--&gt; morpheme ''-ti-''. &lt;!-- Ligature morpheme?! Ligatures apply to orthography--&gt; 

====Relational Nouns and Locatives====
Spatial and other relations are expressd with relational nouns. Some locative suffixes also exist.

====Noun Incorporation====
Noun [[Incorporation (linguistics)|incorporation]] is productive in Classical Nahuatl and different kinds of material can be incorporated.
*Bodyparts
*Instruments.
*Objects.

===Syntax===
The particle ''in'' is important in Nahuatl syntax and is used as a kind of [[definite article]] and also as a subordinating particle and a deictic particle, in addition to having other functions.

====Non-configurationality====
Classical Nahuatl can be classiefied as a non-configurational language, allowing many different kinds of word orders, even splitting noun phrases.
 
====VSO basic wordorder====
The basic word order of Classical Nahuatl is verb initial and often considered to be VSO, although some scholars have argued for it being VOS. However, being non-configurational, all wordorders are allowed and are used to express different kinds of pragmatic relations, such as thematization and focus.

===Numeral System===
Classical nahuatl has a [[vigesimal]] numeral system.

==== Numbers ====
*cē -1
*ōme -2
*yei -3
*nāhui - 4
*macuilli  -5
*chicuacēn - 6
*chicuōme - 7
*chicueyi - 8
*chicunāhui - 9
*matlactli - 10
*caxtolli 15
*cēmpōhualli - 20

===Colour Terminology===
The Nahuatl colour system lacks a separate term for blue, and instead uses a single term to cover both blue and green nuances&lt;!--, thus representing a lvl--&gt;. It has been argued that Nahuatl has no basic colour terms, (in the [[Berlin &amp; Kay]] sense of the word) because they are all derived with a'' -tic'' suffix from verbs or nouns.

====Basic Colour terms====
*īstac - white
*tlīltic - black
*chichiltic - red
*costic - yellow
*xoxoctic- green and blue
*quiltic - green
*tlilectic - dark

===Kinshsip Terminology===
The kinship system of Classical Nahuatl distinguishes older and younger siblings.

'''Mápó dòufu''' (麻婆豆腐) is a classic spicy tofu and meat dish from Szechuan province in China. It is a very flavourful, easy to prepare, and spicy dish.

==Ingredients==

* 1 [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], sliced
* small piece of [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]], minced (about 2 tsp)
* 1-2 tsp crushed dried [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chili]] pepper

* 200g (7 oz) [[Cookbook:Mincing|minced]] [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]], [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]]
* 4 cloves of [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], minced

* 500g (1 lb) [[Cookbook:Tofu|silken tofu]], cubed
* 2 tbsp chili bean paste (Doubanjiang)
* 1 tbsp [[Cookbook:Szechuan Pepper|Szechuan pepper]], roasted and ground
* 1 tbsp [[Cookbook:Soy Sauce|soy sauce]]
* 1 tbsp rice wine
* 3-4 [[Cookbook:Green onion|green onions]], cut into 2cm (1&quot;) pieces
* 2-3 [[Cookbook:Mushroom|mushrooms]] &amp;ndash; tree ears preferred (optional)

==Procedure==

# If adding dried mushrooms, soak these in hot water for 10 minutes while preparing the rest of the ingredients, then slice before adding later.
# [[Cookbook:Sautéing|Sauté]] onion with ginger and crushed chili.
# Add minced meat and garlic, and fry until brown.
# Mix in other ingredients (including sliced mushrooms), lower heat, and simmer for 5-10 minutes.

Serve over steamed [[Cookbook:Rice|jasmine rice]].

==Notes, tips and variations==
* Some extra chili pepper can be substituted for Szechuan pepper, but the taste and feeling will be different. Szechuan pepper has a numbing flavour, not a hot flavour.
* A little ground [[Cookbook:Coriander|coriander]] and [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin]] is very nice in this dish, especially if you cannot find Szechuan pepper easily.
* A [[Cookbook:Bell Pepper|red bell pepper]], a tomato, and fresh [[Cookbook:Cilantro|coriander leaves]] are all welcome additions, though not traditional.
* The meal is just as good with whole [[Cookbook:Legume|beans]] instead of tofu.
* A vegetarian version of this meal can be made by substituting the meat with [[Cookbook:Ground_Tofu|ground tofu]] (e.g. [http://shiokfood.com/notes/archives/000016.html Shiok Food's Vegetarian Ma Po Tofu])

'''Szechuan Pepper''' is a peppery spice used frequently in food from Sichuan provence, [[Cookbook:Cuisine of China|China]], but also in the cuisines of [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Japan|Japan]], [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Tibet|Tibet]], and other countries in [[Cookbook:Asian Cuisine|Asia]]. It has a slightly lemony aroma, and has a reputation for creating numbness in the mouth (very useful when eating really spicy foods like [[Cookbook:Mapo Doufu|Mapo Doufu]]).

The flavour and spice are in the husks of the seed, not the seed itself. The seeds are hard like little stones, and are discarded before roasting and grinding the husks.

Szechuan pepper is one the ingredients in [[Cookbook:Five Spice Powder|Chinese five spice]].

      <comment>fixed the boolean issue</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">ISSUE:  The pronunciation of Boolean is correctly given; then, a statement is made that an alternative pronunciation has been heard.

PROBLEM:  Simply because one has &quot;heard&quot; an improper pronunciation does not mean that one should adopt the incorrect pronunciation.

ANALOGY:  Let's concentrate on base 10 arithmetic.  In that system, 2 + 2 = 4 (but -- once or twice -- I've also seen that 2 + 2 = 5)

DISCUSSION:  As a tutor, one need not (and I would stress that one SHOULD not) confuse a student by introducing erroneous alternatives.  The fact that I may have seen (perhaps when correcting homework of another student) the answer to our equation given as &quot;5&quot; instead of &quot;4&quot; does not reasonably obligate me (as a tutor) to share what I know to be incorrect information.

== Either/left/right exercise very unclear ==

I don't think you're giving the student enough information to know how to do the exercise where you want either a value, a pair, a triple, etc back.  Looking at the solution doesn't help either (it also doesn't help in the PDF that the solution goes off to the right and you can't see it all).

It says something about how you will need to use the Either type to represent it, but you don't have to directly mention Either (unless you are entering the function's type signature), but you do have to somehow guess that every time you use alternation, you get something that is addressable with Left and Right.  Nothing in the text prepares the reader for this.  Either is introduced earlier as &quot;another useful type&quot;, not something that is going to automatically apply every time I define a type with the | symbol.  Is that what the | symbol means?  That I'm using Either?  I don't get it.

: I agree, and I've fixed the problem.

== How do I display my type? ==


I'm brand new to haskell, and after reading this page and the &quot;advanced type&quot; page, I can't figure out how to tell GHCI to display my new type.

How do I make my new data type a member of class Show?</text>
